About the Author

Manuel  C.  Molles  Jr.  is  an  emeritus  Professor  of  Biology  at  the 
 University of New Mexico, where he has been a member of the faculty and curator in 
the Museum of Southwestern Biology since 1975 and where he continues to write and 
conduct ecological research. He received his B.S. from Humboldt State University and 
his Ph.D. from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University 
of Arizona. Seeking to broaden his geographic perspective, he has taught and conducted 
ecological research in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe. He was awarded a 
Fulbright Research Fellowship to conduct research on river ecology in Portugal and has 
held visiting professor appointments in the Department of Zoology at the University 
of Coimbra, Portugal, in the Laboratory of Hydrology at the Polytechnic University of 
Madrid, Spain, and at the University of Montana’s Flathead Lake Biological Station. 

Originally  trained  as  a  marine  ecologist  and  fisheries  biologist,  the  author  has 
worked  mainly  on  river  and  riparian  ecology  at  the  University  of  New  Mexico.  His 
research has covered a wide range of ecological levels, including behavioral ecology, 
population biology, community ecology, ecosystem ecology, biogeography of stream 
insects, and the influence of a large-scale climate system (El Niño) on the dynamics 
of southwestern river and riparian ecosystems. His current research concerns the influ-
ence  of  climate  change  and  climatic  variability  on  the  dynamics  of  populations  and 
 communities  along  steep  gradients  of  temperature  and  moisture  in  the  mountains  of 
the Southwest. Throughout his career, Dr. Molles has attempted to combine research, 
teaching, and service, involving undergraduate as well as graduate students in his ongo-
ing projects. At the University of New Mexico, he has taught a broad range of lower 
division, upper division, and graduate courses, including Principles of Biology, Evolu-
tion and Ecology, Stream Ecology, Limnology and Oceanography, Marine Biology, and 
Community and Ecosystem Ecology. He has taught courses in Global Change and River 
Ecology at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, and General Ecology and Groundwater 
and Riparian Ecology at the Flathead Lake Biological Station. Dr. Manuel Molles was 
named Teacher of the Year by the University of New Mexico for 1995–1996 and Potter 
Chair in Plant Ecology in 2000. In 2014, he received the Eugene P. Odum Award from 
the Ecological Society of America based on his “ability to relate basic ecological prin-
ciples to human affairs through teaching, outreach and mentoring activities.”

This book was written for students taking their first under-
graduate  course  in  ecology.  I  have  assumed  that  students 
in  this  one-semester  course  have  some  knowledge  of  basic 
chemistry and mathematics and have had a course in general 
biology, which included introductions to physiology, biologi-
cal diversity, and evolution.

Organization of the Book
An  evolutionary  perspective  forms  the  foundation  of  the 
entire  textbook,  as  it  is  needed  to  support  understanding 
of major concepts. The textbook begins with a brief intro-
duction to the nature and history of the discipline of ecol-
ogy, followed by section I, which includes two chapters on 
natural history—life on land and life in water and a chapter 
on  population  genetics  and  natural  selection.   Sections  II 
through  VI  build  a  hierarchical  perspective  through  the 
traditional  subdisciplines  of  ecology:  section  II  concerns 
adaptations  to  the  environment;  section  III  focuses  on 
population  ecology;  section  IV  presents  the  ecology  of 
interactions; section V summarizes community and ecosys-
tem  ecology;  and  finally,  section VI  discusses  large-scale 
ecology  and  includes  chapters  on  landscape,  geographic, 
and  global  ecology. These  topics  were  first  introduced  in 
section I within a natural history context. In summary, the 
book begins with the natural history of the planet, consid-
ers portions of the whole in the middle chapters, and ends 
with  another  perspective  of  the  entire  planet  in  the  con-
cluding  chapter.  The  features  of  this  textbook  were  care-
fully  planned  to  enhance  the  students’  comprehension  of 
the broad discipline of ecology.

Features Designed with the 
Student in Mind
All chapters are based on a distinctive learning system, fea-
turing the following key components:

Student  Learning  Outcomes:  Educators  are  being  asked 
increasingly to develop concrete student learning outcomes 
for courses across the curriculum. In response to this need 
and to help focus student progress through the content, all 
sections of each chapter in the seventh edition begin with a 
list of detailed student learning outcomes.

Introduction: The introduction to each chapter presents 
the student with the flavor of the subject and important 
background  information.  Some  introductions  include 
historical  events  related  to  the  subject;  others  pre-
sent an example of an ecological process. All attempt

Preface

to engage students and draw them into the discussion that 
follows.

Concepts: The goal of this book is to build a foundation of 
ecological knowledge around key concepts. I have found that 
while  beginning  ecology  students  can  absorb  a  few  central 
concepts well, they can easily get lost in a sea of details. The 
key  concepts  are  listed  at  the  beginning  of  each  chapter  to 
alert the student to the major topics to follow and to provide a 
place where the student can find a list of the important points 
covered in each chapter. The sections in which concepts are 
discussed focus on published studies and, wherever possible, 
the scientists who did the research are introduced. This case-
study  approach  supports  the  concepts  with  evidence,  and 
introduces students to the methods and people that have cre-
ated the discipline of ecology. Each concept discussion ends 
with  a  series  of  concept  review  questions  to  help  students 
test their knowledge and to reinforce key points made in the 
discussion.

Preface

Illustrations: A great deal of effort has been put into the devel-
opment of illustrations, both photographs and line art. The goal 
has  been  to  create  more  effective  pedagogical  tools  through 
skillful design and use of color, and to rearrange the traditional 
presentation of information in figures and 
captions.  Much  explanatory  material  is 
located within the illustrations, providing 
students with key information where they 
need it most. The approach also provides 
an  ongoing  tutorial  on  graph  interpreta-
tion, a skill with which many introductory 
students need practice.

“Investigating the Evidence” Boxes: These readings offer 
“mini-lessons” on the scientific method, emphasizing statis-
tics and study design. They are intended to present a broad 
outline of the process of science, while also providing step-
by-step explanations. The series of boxes begins in chapter 1 
with an overview of the scientific method, which establishes 
a  conceptual  context  for  more  specific  material  in  the  next 
21 chapters. The last reading wraps up the series with a dis-
cussion of electronic literature searches. Each Evidence box 
ends with one or more questions, under the heading “Critiqu-
ing the Evidence.” This feature is intended to stimulate criti-
cal thinking about the box content.

Applications:  Many  undergraduate  students  want  to  know 
how abstract ideas and general relationships can be applied to 
the ecological problems we face in the contemporary world. 
They  are  concerned  with  the  practical  side  of  ecology  and 
want  to  know  more  about  how  the  tools  of  science  can  be 
applied. Including a discussion of applications in each chapter 
motivates students to learn more of the underlying principles 
of ecology. In addition, it seems that environmental problems 
are now so numerous and so pressing that they have erased a 
once easy distinction between general and applied ecology.

End-of-Chapter Material:

 •  Summary  The  chapter  summary  reviews  the  main 
points  of  the  content. The  concepts  around  which  each 

chapter  is  organized  are  boldfaced  and  redefined  in  the 
summary to reemphasize the main points of the chapter.
 •  Key Terms  The listing of key terms provides page num-

bers for easy reference in each chapter.

 •  Review  Questions  The  review  questions  are  designed 
to  help  students  think  more  deeply  about  each  concept 
and  to  reflect  on  alternative  views.  They  also  provide 
a place to fill in any remaining gaps in the information 
presented and take students beyond the foundation estab-
lished in the main body of the chapter.

End-of-Book Material:

 •  Appendixes  One  appendix,  “Statistical  Tables,”  is 
available to the student for reference. Answers to Con-
cept  Review  questions  and  answers  to  Critiquing  the 
Evidence  are  now  available  with  the  book’s  instructor 
resources.

 •  Glossary  List of all key terms and their definitions.
 •  References  References  are  an  important  part  of  any 
scientific work. However, many undergraduates are dis-
tracted by a large number of references within the text. 
One of the goals of a general ecology course should be to 
introduce these students to the primary literature without 
burying  them  in  citations.  The  number  of  citations  has 
been reduced to those necessary to support detailed dis-
cussions of particular research projects.

Section II    Adaptations to the Environment 
 Investigating the Evidence  5 
 Laboratory Experiments 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:
 5.12  Describe the basic design of a laboratory experiment.
 5.13  Discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of 
laboratory experiments and field observations in 
ecological studies.

 One of the most powerful ways to test a hypothesis is through 
an experiment. Experiments used by ecologists generally fall 
into  one  of  two  categories—field  experiments  and  labora-
tory experiments. Field and laboratory experiments generally 
 provide complementary information or evidence, and  differ 
somewhat  in  their  design.  Here  we  discuss  the  design  of 
 laboratory experiments. 
 In a laboratory experiment, the researcher attempts to keep 
all factors relatively constant except one. The one factor that is 
not kept constant is the one of interest to the experimenter and 
it is the one that the experimenter varies across experimental 
conditions. Let’s draw an example of a laboratory experiment 
discussed in this chapter (see p. 000). Based upon published 
studies, Michael Angilletta (2001) concluded that geographi-
cally separated populations of the eastern fence lizard,  Scelo-
porus undulatus,  may differ physiologically or behaviorally. 
 Angilletta designed a laboratory experiment to test the 
hypothesis that populations of  S. undulatus  from regions with 
significantly  different  climates  differ  in  how  temperature 
affects their rates of metabolizable energy intake. The results 
of that experiment are summarized by  figure 5.10 . What we 
want to consider here is the design of the experiment that pro-
duced those results. What factors do you think Angilletta may 
have attempted to control in this experiment? First, he used 
similar numbers of lizards from the two populations. He tested 
20 lizards from both populations at 33 8 C, 13 from New Jersey 
at 30 8  and 36 8 C, and 14 from South Carolina at 30 8  and 36 8 C. A 
second factor that Angilletta controlled was lizard size. Lizards 
the United States, living in a broad diversity of climatic zones 
( fig. 5.9 ). Taking advantage of this wide range of environmental 
conditions, Michael Angilletta (2001) studied the temperature 
relations of  S. undulatus  over a portion of its range. In one of 
his studies, Angilletta determined how temperature influences 
metabolizable energy intake, or MEI. He measured MEI as the 
amount of energy consumed (C) minus energy lost in feces (F) 
and uric acid (U), which is the nitrogen waste product produced 
by lizards. We can summarize MEI in equation form as:   
 Angilletta  studied  two  populations  from  New  Jersey  and 
South Carolina, regions with substantially different climates. 

MEI 5 C 2 F 2 U  

from both populations used in the experiments had an average 
body mass of approximately 5.4 g. Since males and females 
may differ physiologically, Angilletta included approximately 
equal numbers of males and females in his experiments. He 
also was careful to expose all the lizards to the same quality 
of light and to the same numbers of hours of light and dark-
ness and he maintained them in the same kinds of experimental 
enclosures. Angilletta also fed all the lizards in his experiment 
the same type of food: live crickets. The list could go on but 
these are the major factors controlled in this experiment. 
 Now, what factors did Angilletta vary in that experiment? 
For each study population, New Jersey or South Carolina, he 
varied a single factor: temperature. In the experiment, Angil-
letta maintained lizards from New Jersey and South Carolina at 
three temperatures: 30 8 , 33 8 , and 36 8 C and estimated their rates 
of  metabolizable energy intake at these three temperatures. 
Angilletta’s experiment revealed that lizards from both popula-
tions have a maximum metabolizable energy intake at 33 8 C. 
This result suggests, contrary to the study’s hypothesis, that the 
optimum temperature for feeding does not differ for the two 
populations. However, the experiment also showed that at 33 8 C 
 S. undulatus  from South Carolina have a higher metabolizable 
energy intake compared to lizards from New Jersey. This result 
provides evidence of the geographic differences that Angilletta 
thought might exist across the range of  S. undulatus.  The power 
of this experiment to reveal the influence of temperature on liz-
ard performance resulted from the ability of the researcher to 
control all significant factors but the one of interest. In this case 
the main factor of interest was temperature.

He collected a sample of lizards from both populations and 
maintained portions of his samples from both populations at 
30 8 , 33 8 , and 36 8 C. Angilletta kept his study lizards in sepa-
rate enclosures and provided them with crickets that he had 
weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg as food. Since he had deter-
mined the energy content of an average cricket, Angilletta was 
able to determine the energy intake by each lizard by count-
ing the number of crickets they ate and calculating the energy 
content of that number. He determined the energy lost as feces 
(F) and uric acid (U) by collecting all the feces and uric acid 
produced by each lizard and then drying and weighing this 
material. He estimated the average energy content of feces 
and uric acid using a bomb calorimeter.

 Local Extinction of a Land Snail 

in an Urban Heat Island 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:
 5.21  Outline changes in the distribution of the snail 
Arianta arbustorum around Basel, Switzerland, 
between 1900 and 1990.
 5.22  Explain how urbanization generally creates a “heat 
island.”
 5.23  Review the evidence that temperature changes 
around the city of Basel are responsible for local 
extinctions of the snail Arianta arbustorum.
 Between 1906 and 1908, a Ph.D. candidate named G. Bollinger 
(1909) studied land snails in the vicinity of Basel, Switzerland. 
Eighty-five years later, Bruno and Anette Baur (1993) carefully 
resurveyed Bollinger’s study sites near Basel for the presence of 
land snails. In the process, they found that at least one snail spe-
cies,  Arianta arbustorum,  had disappeared from several of the 
sites. This discovery led the Baurs to explore the mechanisms 
that may have produced extinction of these local populations. 
A. arbustorum  is a common land snail in meadows, for-
ests, and other moist, vegetated habitats in northwestern and 
central Europe. The species lives at altitudes up to 2,700 m 
in the Alps. The Baurs report that the snail is sexually mature 
at 2 to 4 years and may live up to 14 years. Adult snails have 
shell diameters of 16 to 20 mm. The species is hermaphro-
ditic. Though individuals generally mate with other  A. arbus-
torum,  they can fertilize their own eggs. Adults produce one 
to three batches of 20 to 80 eggs each year. They deposit their 
eggs in moss, under plant litter, or in the soil. Eggs generally 
hatch in 2 to 4 weeks, depending upon temperature. The egg 
is an especially sensitive stage in the life cycle of land snails. 
A. arbustorum  often lives alongside  Cepea nemoralis,  a land 
snail with a broader geographic distribution that extends from 
southern Scandinavia to the Iberian peninsula. 
 How  did  the  Baurs  document  local  extinctions  of 
A. arbustorum?  If you think about it a bit, you will probably 
realize that it is usually easier to determine the presence of a 
species than its absence. If you do not encounter a species dur-
ing a survey, it may be that you just didn’t look hard enough. 
Fortunately, the Baurs had over 13 years of experience doing 
fieldwork on  A. arbustorum  and knew its natural history well. 
For instance, they knew that it is best to search for the snails 
after rainstorms, when up to 70% of the adult population is 
active.  Consequently,  the  Baurs  searched  Bollinger’s  study 
sites  after  heavy  rains. They  concluded  that  the  snail  was 
absent at a site only after two 2-hour surveys failed to turn up 
either a living individual or an empty shell of the species. 
 The Baurs found  A. arbustorum  still living at 13 of the 
29 sites surveyed by Bollinger near Basel. Eleven of these 
remaining populations lived in deciduous forests and the other 
two lived on grassy riverbanks. However, the Baurs could not 

find the snail at 16 sites. Eight of these sites had been urban-
ized, which made the habitat unsuitable for any land snails 
because natural vegetation had been removed. Between 1900 
and 1990 the urbanized area of Basel had increased by 500%. 
However, the eight other sites where  A. arbustorum  had dis-
appeared were still covered by vegetation that appeared suit-
able. Four of these sites were covered by deciduous forest, 
three were on riverbanks, and one was on a railway embank-
ment. These vegetated sites also supported populations of five 
other land snail species, including  C. nemoralis.  
 What caused the extinction of  A. arbustorum  at sites that 
still supported other snails? The Baurs compared the charac-
teristics of these sites with those of the sites where  A. arbus-
torum  had persisted. They found no difference between these 
two groups of sites in regard to slope, percent plant cover, 
height of vegetation, distance from water, or number of other 
land snail species present. The first major difference the Baurs 
uncovered was in altitude. The sites where  A. arbustorum  was 
extinct had an average altitude of 274 m. The places where it 
survived had an average altitude of 420 m. The places where 
the snail had survived were also cooler. 
 A thermal image of the landscape taken from a satellite 
showed that surface temperatures in summer around Basel 
ranged from about 17 8  to 32.5 8 C. Surface temperatures where 
A. arbustorum  had survived averaged approximately 22 8 C, 
while the sites where the species had gone extinct had surface 
temperatures  that  averaged  approximately  25 8 C.  The  sites 
where the snail was extinct were also much closer to very 
hot areas with temperatures greater than 29 8 C.   Figure 5.34  is 
based on the Baurs’ thermal image of the area around Basel 
and shows where the snail was extinct and where it persisted. 
 The Baurs attributed the higher temperatures at the eight 
sites where the snail is extinct to heating by thermal radiation 
from the urbanized areas of the city. Buildings and pavement 
store more heat than vegetation. In addition, the cooling effect 
of evaporation from vegetation is lost when an area is built 
over. Increased heat storage and reduced cooling make urban-
ized landscapes thermal islands. Heat energy stored in urban 
centers is transferred to the surrounding landscape through 
thermal radiation, H r  . 
 The Baurs documented higher temperatures at the sites 
near Basel where  A. arbustorum  is extinct and identified a 
well-studied mechanism that could produce the higher tem-
peratures of these sites. However, are the temperature differ-
ences they observed sufficient to exclude  A. arbustorum  from 
the warmer sites? The researchers compared the temperature 
relations of  A. arbustorum  and  C. nemoralis  to find some 
clues. They concentrated their studies on the influence of tem-
perature on reproduction by these two snail species. 
 The  eggs  of  each  species  were  incubated  at  four 
temperatures—19 8 , 22 8 , 25 8 , and 29 8 C. Notice that these tem-
peratures fall within the range measured by the satellite image 
(see  fig. 5.34 ). The eggs of both species hatched at a high rate at 
19 8 C. However, at higher temperatures, their eggs hatched at sig-
nificantly lower rates. At 22 8 C, less than 50% of  A. arbustorum
eggs hatched, while the eggs of  C. nemoralis  continued to hatch 
at a high rate. At 25 8 C, no  A. arbustorum  eggs hatched, while 
approximately 50% of the  C. nemoralis  eggs hatched. At 29 8 C,

Preface

New to the Seventh Edition
The seventh edition expands the pedagogy by beginning 
all sections of every chapter with a list of student learn-
ing  outcomes—over 450 student learning outcomes in all. 
These  outcomes  are  largely  based  on  fundamental  learning 
outcomes for material covered in the text:

  1.  Define key terms.
  2.  Explain the main concepts.
  3.  Evaluate the strength of research presented in support of 

main concepts, including a critique of study design.

  4.  Interpret  statistical  evidence  bearing  on  concepts, 

expressed in graphical and numerical form.

  5.  Apply  the  main  concepts  to  interpretation  of  new 

situations.

A  content  thread  focused  on  global  change  has  been 
developed  and  distributed  across  chapters,  emphasizing 
global  climate  change.  Students  and  instructors  increasingly 
look for ways to connect the concepts and practice of ecologi-
cal science to environmental issues arising from global climate 
change. The present edition explores how species are adjusting 
their  distributions  and  their  critical  life  history  events  as  cli-
mate changes. The final chapter ends with a review of projected 
impacts  of  climate  change  on  ecosystems  and  human  popula-
tions, infrastructure, and economic systems.

This  edition  also  builds  on  previous  discussions  of 
human disturbance of ecosystems to consider how damaged 
ecosystems can be restored. The extent and intensity of human 
impact on the biosphere grows with our population and expand-
ing global economy. While climate change is the most promi-
nent aspect of contemporary global change, other facets, such as 
damage or destruction of ecosystems, also call for solutions. As 
a result, there is greater need to restore damaged communities 
and ecosystems. In this context, the new edition adds an intro-
duction to the practice of ecological restoration, focusing on how 
the process of restoring ecosystems can benefit from concepts 
developed  in  academic  studies  of  community  and  ecosystem 
succession.

The  relationship  between  biodiversity  and  ecosystem 
function is introduced through the positive influence of pri-
mary  producer  diversity  on  rates  of  primary  production. 
Studies of biodiversity and ecosystem function are key elements 
in ecology’s foundation. Connecting these elements helps create 
conceptual coherence across the discipline. A growing body of 
recent research does just that. Therefore, this edition includes a 
new section on the connection between biodiversity and ecosys-
tem function.

The seventh edition introduces developments in trophic 
ecology that build on classical models of predator-prey inter-
actions.  The  early  to  middle  twentieth  century  was  a  golden 
age for theoretical ecology. However, those developments have 
not stopped. Contemporary ecologists continue to build on that 
legacy, improving our representation and understanding of eco-
logical systems as they do so. The seventh edition updates the 
discussion of consumer functional response by introducing alter-
native  models  based  on  the  ratio  of  prey  to  predator  numbers 

rather than prey density per se. This discussion is coupled with 
reviews of experimental and field studies that support the ratio-
dependent models.

The present edition connects ratio-dependent models 
of functional response to patterns of consumer abundance 
and secondary production in ecosystems. Previous editions 
have  provided  thorough  coverage  of  the  ecology  of  primary 
production in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but second-
ary production has received much less attention. This seventh 
edition  addresses  this  deficiency  by  including  a  section  that 
covers the fundamentals of secondary production. The intro-
duction  to  secondary  production  in  this  edition  is  presented 
in the context of consumer responses to variations in primary 
production.

New supplementary materials are placed online. Materi-
als cut from the sixth edition and those previously cut from the 
fifth  and  fourth  editions  are  available  online.  Suggested  read-
ings have been updated and placed online, along with answers to 
Concept Review and Critiquing the Evidence questions.

Significant Chapter-by-Chapter Changes
In  chapters  1  to  23,  numbered  learning  outcomes  were 
added to all concept discussions and Evaluating the Evidence 
and Applications  features.  The  average  number  of  learning 
outcomes added to each chapter is 20.

In  chapter  10,  a  new  Applications  feature  explores  evi-
dence that plant and animal ranges have shifted northward and 
to higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere during the recent 
period  of  rapid  global  warming.  This  is  the  beginning  of  the 
global climate change thread in the seventh edition. However, the 
presentation builds on earlier content in chapter 1 on population 
responses to climate change, including evolutionary responses, 
and in  chapter 4 on temperature relations of organisms.

In chapter 12, a new Applications feature reviews studies 
that have shown shifts in the timing of flowering in plants and 
of migration in birds in response to climate warming. The dis-
cussion complements the earlier discussion of shifts in species 
ranges in chapter 10 by demonstrating that climate warming is 
not just inducing organisms to move in response to global warm-
ing but also adjusting their life histories.

In  chapter  13,  the  Lotka-Volterra  equations  have  been 
modified from previous editions to make them more standard, 
less cluttered, and easier for students to follow, which is essen-
tial, since these equations are the foundation of the mathematical 
ecology covered in the text.

In  chapter  14,  we  revisit  predator  functional  responses 
first introduced in chapter 7 by evaluating alternatives to those 
models. The Lotka-Volterra models of predator-prey interactions 
published in the early twentieth century stimulated a long line 
of research. More recently, researchers have offered alternatives 
that  help  identify  where  those  classical  mathematical  models, 
with their simplifying assumptions, apply and where alternative 
formulations  better  account  for  aspects  of   predator-prey  inter-
actions,  particularly  at  larger  spatial  and  longer  temporal 
scales. The discussion in this chapter reviews how recent ratio-
dependent  functional  response  models  better  predict  predator

functional  responses  in  experimental  and  natural  settings.  The 
discussion  helps  to  dispel  the  idea  that  mathematical  ecology 
ceased to develop in the mid-twentieth century and reinforces the 
complementary roles of theoretical, experimental, and observa-
tional studies.

In  chapter  18,  a  new  concept  connects  primary  producer 
diversity to higher levels of primary production. The chapter also 
includes a new concept featuring the relationship between levels 
of primary production and secondary production. This discussion 
provides a basis for introducing the fundamentals of secondary 
production. This addition also revisits the ratio-dependent func-
tional responses introduced in chapter 14 by extending the impli-
cations of those models beyond predator functional response to 
the trophic structure of ecosystems. The treatment also formally 
introduces secondary production, filling a conceptual gap in pre-
vious editions.

In  chapter  20,  the  fields  of  ecological  restoration  and 
restoration  ecology  are  introduced  for  the  first  time.  Human 
impact on the environment has altered ecological communities 
and ecosystems in nearly every corner of the planet. Restoring 

structure and function to these systems emerges as one of the 
great contemporary ecological challenges. Increasingly ecolo-
gists  addressing  this  challenge  are  turning  to  the  conceptual 
framework of ecological succession to guide their work. Exam-
ples of such work are included in this chapter to help bridge 
the historical divide between ecological theory and restoration 
practice.

In chapter 23, the discussion of the Antarctic ozone hole 
has been updated to 2013, including 35 years of data from NASA 
on the size of the ozone hole. The pattern shows that the maxi-
mum size of the Antarctic ozone hole has stabilized, signaling 
a  basis  for  ozone  recovery  predicted  by  atmospheric  scientists 
over the next 50 years, providing a bit of good planetary news. 
The growing body of climate change research, published since 
the earlier editions of  Ecology Concepts and Applications, has 
greatly improved understanding of how earth’s changing climate 
will impact ecosystems and human populations, if not stabilized. 
A discussion of these impacts concludes this edition, underscor-
ing the relevance of ecological knowledge to sustaining natural 
as well as human-centered systems.

Acknowledgments
A complete list of the people who have helped me with this 
project would be impossibly long. However, during the devel-
opment  of  this  seventh  edition,  several  colleagues  freely 
shared  their  ideas  and  expertise,  reviewed  new  sections,  or 
offered  the  encouragement  a  project  like  this  needs  to  keep 
it going: Scott Collins, Cliff Dahm, Arturo Elosegi, Manuel 
Graça, Tom Kennedy, Tim Lowrey, Sam Loker, Rob Miller, 
Will  Pockman,  Steve  Poe,  Bob  Sinsabaugh, Alain  Thomas, 
Tom Turner, Lawrence Walker, Chris Witt, Blair Wolf. I wish 
to  offer  special  thanks  to  Roger  Arditi  and  Lev  Ginzburg 
for  their  time  and  patience  in  helping  me  develop  sections 
on  ratio-dependent  models  of  functional  response  and  their 
potential  contributions  to  better  understanding  of  predator-
prey interactions and the trophic structure of ecosystems. I am 
also  grateful  to Art  Benke  for  helping  me  develop  an  over-
view of secondary production for this edition and for helping 
integrate  it  with  discussion  of  the  effects  of  enrichment  on 
ecosystem trophic structure. John and Leah Vucetich helped 
bring their long-term research on wolf-moose interactions on 
Isle Royale to life by graciously allowing use of one of their 
many photos of interactions in this model predator and prey 
system. In addition, I am indebted to the many students and 
instructors who have helped by contacting me with questions 
and suggestions for improvements.

I also wish to acknowledge the skillful guidance and work 
throughout  the  publishing  process  given  by  many  profession-
als associated with McGraw-Hill during this project, including 
Becky Olson, Patrick Reidy, Carrie Burger, Fran Simon, April 
Southwood, Lynn Breithaupt, Mary Reeg, Angie Sigwarth, Tara 
McDermott, and Sheila Frank.

Finally,  I  wish  to  thank  all  my  family  for  support  given 
throughout the project, especially Paulette Dompeling, Mary Ann 
Esparza, Dan Esparza, Hani Molles, Anders Molles, Mary Anne 
Nelson, and Keena.

I gratefully acknowledge the many reviewers who, over the 
course of the last several revisions, have given of their time and 
expertise to help this textbook evolve to its present seventh edi-
tion. Their depth and breadth of knowledge and experience, both 
as  researchers  and  teachers,  are  humbling.  They  continue  my 
education, for which I am grateful, and I honestly could not have 
continued the improvement of this textbook without them.

 Historical Foundations 

and Developing Frontiers 

LEARNING OUTCOME
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 1.1  Discuss the concept of environment as it pertains to 

the science of ecology. 

W hat  is  ecology?     Ecology    ,   the  study  of  relation-

ships  between  organisms  and  the  environment, 
has been a focus for human study for as long as 
we have existed as a species. Our survival has depended upon 
how well we could observe variations in the environment and 
predict  the  responses  of  organisms  to  those  variations.  The 
earliest hunters and gatherers had to know the habits of their 
animal prey and where to find food plants. Later, agricultur-
ists had to be aware of variations in weather and soils and of 
how such variation might affect crops and livestock. 

 Today, most of earth’s human population live in cities and 
most of us have little direct contact with nature. More than ever 
before, though, the future of our species depends on how well we 
understand the relationships between organisms and the environ-
ment. Our species is rapidly changing earth’s environment, yet 
we do not fully understand the consequences of these changes. 
For instance, human activity has increased the quantity of nitro-
gen  cycling  through  the  biosphere,  changed  land  cover  across 
the globe, and increased the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 . 
Changes such as these threaten the diversity of life on earth and 
may endanger our life support system. Because of the rapid pace 
of environmental change at the dawn of the twenty-first century, 
it is imperative that we continue as ardent students of ecology.

Introduction to Ecology

 Behind the simple definition of ecology lies a broad sci-
entific discipline. Ecologists may study individual organisms, 
entire  forests  or  lakes,  or  even  the  whole  earth.  The  mea-
surements  made  by  ecologists  include  counts  of  individual 
organisms,  rates  of  reproduction,  or  rates  of  processes  such 
as photosynthesis and decomposition. Ecologists often spend 
as  much  time  studying  nonbiological  components  of  the 
environment,  such  as  temperature  or  soil  chemistry,  as  they 
spend studying organisms. Meanwhile, the “environment” of 
organisms in some ecological studies are other species. While 
you may think of ecologists as typically studying in the field, 
some of the most important conceptual advances in ecology 
have  come  from  ecologists  who  build  theoretical  models  or 
do ecological research in the laboratory. Clearly, our simple 
definition of  ecology  does not communicate the great breadth 
of the discipline or the diversity of its practitioners. To get a 
better idea of what ecology is, let’s briefly review the scope 
of the discipline. 

1.1  Overview of Ecology 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 1.2  Describe the levels of ecological organization, for 

example, population, studied by ecologists. 
 1.3  Distinguish between the types of questions 

addressed by ecologists working at different levels of 
organization.

 1.4  Explain how knowledge of one level of ecological 

organization can help guide research at another 
level of organization.

  Ecologists  study  environmental  relationships  ranging 
from those of individual organisms to factors influencing 
global-scale  processes.   This  broad  range  of  subjects  can 
be  organized  by  arranging  them  as  levels  in  a  hierarchy  of 
ecological  organization,  such  as  that  imbedded  in  the  brief 
table  of  contents  and  the  sections  of  this  book.   Figure  1.1  
attempts to display such a hierarchy graphically. 

 Historically, the ecology of individuals, which is presented 
at the base of  figure 1.1 , has been the domain of physiological 
ecology and behavioral ecology. Physiological ecologists have 
emphasized  the     evolution     (a  process  by  which  populations 
change over time) of physiological and anatomical mechanisms 
by  which  organisms  solve  problems  posed  by  physical  and 
chemical  variation  in  the  environment.  Meanwhile,  behavioral 
ecologists  have  focused  principally  on  evolution  of  behaviors 
that allow animals to survive and reproduce in the face of envi-
ronmental  variation.  Physiological  and  behavioral  ecology  are 
informed by evolutionary theory, as are all other areas of ecology. 
 There is a strong conceptual linkage between ecological 
studies  of  individuals  and  of  populations  particularly  where 
they  concern  evolutionary  processes.  Population  ecology  is 
centered on the factors influencing population structure and 
process, where a population is a group of individuals of a sin-
gle species inhabiting a defined area. The processes studied 
by  population  ecologists  include  adaptation,  extinction,  the

distribution and abundance of species, population growth and 
regulation, and variation in the reproductive ecology of spe-
cies. Population ecologists are particularly interested in how 
these processes are influenced by nonbiological and biologi-
cal components of the environment. 

 Bringing biological components of the environment into 
the picture takes us to the next level of organization, the ecol-
ogy  of  interactions  such  as  predation,  parasitism,  and  com-
petition.  Ecologists  who  study  interactions  between  species 
have  often  emphasized  the  evolutionary  effects  of  the  inter-
action on the species involved. Other approaches explore the 
effect of interactions on population structure or on properties 
of ecological communities. 

 The definition of an ecological community as an associa-
tion  of  interacting  species  links  community  ecology  with  the 
ecology  of  interactions.  Community  and  ecosystem  ecology 
have a great deal in common, since both are concerned with the 
factors controlling multispecies systems. However, the objects 
of their study differ. While community ecologists concentrate on 
the organisms inhabiting an area, ecosystem ecologists include 
the  physical  and  chemical  factors  influencing  the  community 
and focus on processes such as energy flow and decomposition. 
 To simplify their studies, ecologists have long attempted 
to  identify  and  study  isolated  communities  and  ecosystems. 
However, all communities and ecosystems on earth are open 
systems subject to exchanges of materials, energy, and organ-
isms  with  other  communities  and  ecosystems. The  study  of 
these  exchanges,  especially  among  ecosystems,  is  the  intel-
lectual  territory  of  landscape  ecology.  However,  landscapes 
are not isolated either but part of geographical regions sub-
ject  to  large-scale  and  long-term  regional  processes.  These 
regional  processes  are  the  subjects  of  geographic  ecology. 
Geographic ecology in turn leads us to the largest spatial scale 
and highest level of ecological organization—the    biosphere    ,
the portions of the earth that support life, including the land, 
waters, and atmosphere. 

 While this description of ecology provides a brief preview 
of the material covered in this book, it is a rough sketch and 
highly abstract. To move beyond the abstraction represented 
by  figure 1.1 , we need to connect it to the work of the scien-
tists who have created the discipline of ecology. To do so, let’s 
briefly review the research of ecologists working at a broad 
range of ecological levels emphasizing links between histori-
cal foundations and some developing frontiers ( fig. 1.2 ). 

 Concept 1.1 Review 

1.  How does the level of ecological organization an ecolo-

gist studies influence the questions he or she poses?  

2.  While  an  ecologist  may  focus  on  a  particular  level  of 
ecological organization shown in  figure 1.1 , might other 
levels of organization be relevant, for example, does an 
ecologist studying factors limiting numbers in a popula-
tion of zebras need to consider the influences of interac-
tions with other species or the influences of food on the 
survival of individuals?

  Figure 1.2   Two rapidly developing frontiers in ecology. 
(a) Aeroecology: the interdisciplinary study of the ecology of the earth-
atmosphere boundary (Kunz et al. 2008). New tools, such as the Indigo/
FLIR Merlin mid thermal camera that took this thermal infrared image 
of flying Brazilian free-tailed bats, Tadarida braziliensis, have opened 
this developing frontier in ecology. This image depicts variation in the 
surface temperature of these bats. Thermal infrared technology makes 
it possible not only to detect and record the presence of free-ranging 
nocturnal organisms, but also to investigate their physiology and ecology 
in a noninvasive manner (see chapter 5, p. 114). (b) Urban ecology: the 
study of urban areas as complex, dynamic ecological systems, influenced 
by interconnected, biological, physical, and social components. As ecolo-
gists focus their research on the environment where most members of our 
species live, they have made unexpected discoveries about the ecology of 
urban centers such as the city of Baltimore (see chapter 19, p. 432).

Chapter 1 

 

Introduction to Ecology

  Ecologists  design  their  studies  based  on  their  research 
 questions, the temporal and spatial scale of their studies, and 
available research tools.  Because the discipline is so broad, 
ecological research can draw from all the physical and biologi-
cal sciences. The following section of this chapter provides a 
sample of ecological questions and approaches to research.  

  The Ecology of Forest Birds: 
Old Tools and New 
 Robert  MacArthur  gazed  intently  through  his  binoculars.  He 
was  watching  a  small  bird,  called  a  warbler,  searching  for 
insects in the top of a spruce tree. To the casual observer it might 
have seemed that MacArthur was a weekend bird-watcher. Yes, 
he was intensely interested in the birds he was watching, but he 
was just as interested in testing ecological theory. 

 The  year  was  1955,  and  MacArthur  was  studying  the 
ecology  of  five  species  of  warblers  that  live  together  in  the 
spruce forests of northeastern North America. All five  warbler 
species,  Cape  May  ( Dendroica  tigrina ),  yellow-rumped 
( D.  coronata ),  black-throated  green  ( D.  virens ),  blackbur-
nian  ( D.  fusca ),  and  bay-breasted  ( D.  castanea ),  are  about 
the same size and shape and all feed on insects. Theory pre-
dicted that two species with identical ecological requirements 
would compete with each other and that, as a consequence, 
they could not live in the same environment indefinitely. Mac-
Arthur wanted to understand how several warbler species with 
apparently similar ecological requirements could live together 
in the same forest. 

 The  warblers  fed  mainly  by  gleaning  insects  from  the 
bark  and  foliage  of  trees.  MacArthur  predicted  that  these 

warblers might be able to coexist and not compete with each 
other if they fed on the insects living in different zones within 
trees. To map where the warblers fed, he subdivided trees into 
vertical and horizontal zones. He then carefully recorded the 
amount of time warblers spent feeding in each. 

 MacArthur’s prediction proved to be correct. His quan-
titative observations demonstrated that the five warbler spe-
cies in his study area fed in different zones in spruce trees. As 
 figure  1.3   shows,  the  Cape  May  warbler  fed  mainly  among 
new needles and buds at the tops of trees. The feeding zone 
of the blackburnian warbler overlapped broadly with that of 
the Cape May warbler but extended farther down the tree. The 
black-throated green warbler fed toward the trees’ interiors. 
The bay-breasted warbler concentrated its feeding in the inte-
rior of trees. Finally, the yellow-rumped warbler fed mostly 
on the ground and low in the trees. MacArthur’s observations 
showed  that  though  these  warblers  live  in  the  same  forest, 
they extract food from different parts of that forest. He con-
cluded that feeding in different zones may reduce competition 
among the warblers of spruce forests. 

 MacArthur’s  study  (1958)  of  foraging  by  warblers  is 
a  true  classic  in  the  history  of  ecology.  However,  like  most 
studies it raised as many questions as it answered. Scientific 
research is important both for what it teaches us directly about 
nature  and  for  how  it  stimulates  other  studies  that  improve 
our  understanding.  MacArthur’s  work  stimulated  numerous 
studies  of  competition  among  many  groups  of  organisms, 
including  warblers.  Some  of  these  studies  produced  results 
that supported his work and others produced different results. 
All added to our knowledge of competition between species 
and of warbler ecology.

American redstarts breed across
much of North America, preferring
forests with abundant shrubs.

American redstarts winter

islands and the surrounding
mainland.

  Figure 1.4  
Mature male American redstarts are highly territorial, dominating 
high-quality feeding territories in their tropical wintering grounds, 
pushing most female redstarts and young males into poorer-quality 
feeding habitats.  

 Nearly  half  a  century  after  Robert  MacArthur  studied  the 
feeding  ecology  of  warblers  through  the  lenses  of  his  binocu-
lars, a team of Canadian and U.S. scientists led by Ryan Norris 
(Norris  et  al.  2005)  worked  to  develop  tools  capable  of  pen-
etrating  the  feeding  habitats  of  wide-ranging  migratory  birds. 
The object of their study was the American redstart ( Setophaga 
ruticilla ), another colorful member of the warbler family Paru-
lidae ( fig. 1.4 ). American redstarts, like the warblers studied by 
MacArthur,  are  long-distance  migrants,  nesting  in  temperate 
North America but spending their winters mainly in tropical Cen-
tral America, northern South America, and the Caribbean islands. 
 Historically, studies of wide-ranging bird species, such 
as the American redstart, have focused mainly on their tem-
perate  breeding  grounds.  However,  observations  by  ecolo-
gists  had  long  suggested  that  the  success  of  an  individual 
migratory bird during the breeding season may depend criti-
cally on the environmental conditions it experienced on its 
tropical  wintering  grounds.  For  example,  it  has  been  well 
established that male migratory birds, arriving early on the 
breeding grounds, are generally in better physical condition 
compared  to  those  arriving  later.  Early  arrivals  also  gen-
erally  obtain  the  best  breeding  territories  and  have  higher 
reproductive success. 

 Variation in arrival times and physical condition led ecol-
ogists to ponder the connection between events on the win-
tering  grounds  and  subsequent  reproductive  success  among 
birds  in  their  breeding  habitats. To  answer  such  a  question, 
we  need  a  great  deal  of  information,  including  where  indi-
vidual  birds  live  on  the  wintering  grounds,  how  the  winter 
habitat  correlates  with  physical  condition  during  migration, 
how winter habitat influences time of arrival on the breeding 
grounds, and whether winter habitat correlates with reproduc-
tive success on the breeding grounds. Clearly, the amount of 
information  required  to  answer  such  questions,  concerning 
environments separated by thousands of kilometers ( fig. 1.5 ), 
exceeds  what  one  person,  or  even  a  large  team,  can  learn 
through the lenses of binoculars.

 Often, ecologists have pioneered the use of more power-
ful research tools, as the complexity of their questions have 
increased.  A  tool  to  which  ecologists  turn  increasingly  to 
understand the ecology of migratory birds is    stable isotope 
analysis    (see chapter 6, p. 145). Isotopes of a chemical ele-
ment, for example, isotopes of carbon, have different atomic 
masses  as  a  result  of  having  different  numbers  of  neutrons. 
Carbon,  for  instance,  has  three  isotopes  (listed  in  order  of 
increasing mass):  12 C,  13 C, and  14 C. Of these three,  12 C and 
 13 C are stable isotopes because they do not undergo radioac-
tive decay, whereas  14 C decays radioactively and is therefore 
unstable. Stable isotopes have proven useful in the study of 
ecological processes—for example, identifying food sources, 
because the proportions of various isotopes differ across the 
environment. 

 Stable  isotope  analysis  provides  ecologists  with  a  new 
type of “lens” capable of revealing ecological relationships 
that  would  otherwise  remain  invisible.  For  example,  ecolo-
gists  using  stable  isotope  analysis  can  track  habitat  use  by 
American  redstarts  on  their  wintering  grounds.  In  Jamaica, 
older  male  American  redstarts,  along  with  some  females, 
spend the winter in higher-productivity mangrove forest hab-
itats, pushing most females and younger males into poorer-
quality, dry scrub habitat. The dominant plants in these two 
habitats  and  the  insects  that  feed  on  them  contain  different 
proportions  of  the  carbon  isotopes   12 C  and   13 C.  Therefore, 
the tissues of the birds spending their winters in the produc-
tive  mangrove  habitat  (lower   13 C)  and  those  spending  the 
winters  in  the  poor  scrub  habitat  (higher   13 C)  are  in  effect 
chemically tagged. As a consequence, today’s ecologist can 
analyze a very small sample of blood from an American red-
start  when  it  arrives  on  its  temperate  breeding  ground  and 

6

Introduction to Ecology

know the habitat where it spent the winter. When Ryan Nor-
ris  and  his  research  team  made  such  measurements,  they 
found  that  male  redstarts  that  had  spent  the  winter  in  the 
more  productive  mangrove  habitat  arrived  on  the  breeding 
grounds earlier and produced significantly more young birds 
that survived to fledging. 

 Stable isotope analysis and the role that it has played in 
elucidating the ecology of a diversity of organisms will thread 
its way through the text. As is often the case in science, new 
tools create new research frontiers. Another of those frontiers 
is to be found in the canopies of forests.  

 Forest Canopy Research: 
A Physical and Scientific Frontier 
 Studies  of  warblers  showcase  how  ecologists  approach 
studies of one or a few species. Other ecologists have been 
concerned  with  the  ecology  of  entire  forests,  lakes,  or 
grasslands,  which  they  treat  as  ecosystems. An     ecosystem    
includes all the organisms that live in an area and the physi-
cal environment with which those organisms interact. Many 
ecosystem studies have focused on    nutrients    ,  the raw mate-
rials  that  an  organism  must  acquire  from  the  environment 
to live. 

 For ecologists who study the budgets of nutrients such as 
nitrogen, phosphorus, or calcium, one of the first steps is to 
inventory their distribution within an ecosystem. Inventories 
by Nalini Nadkarni (1981, 1984a, 1984b) changed our ideas 
of  how  tropical  and  temperate  rain  forests  are  structured 
and how they function. With the aid of mountain-climbing 
equipment, Nadkarni slowly made her first ascent into the 
canopy of the Costa Rican rain forest, a world explored by 
few others and where she was to become a pioneer ( fig. 1.6 ). 
She stood on the rain forest floor and wondered about the 
diversity  of  organisms  and  ecological  relationships  that 
might be hidden in the canopy high above. Her wonder soon 
gave  way  to  determination,  and  Nadkarni  not  only  visited 
the canopy but was among the first to explore the ecology of 
this unseen world. 

 Because  of  leaching  by  heavy  rains,  many  rain  forest 
soils are poor in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. 
The low availability of nutrients in many rain forest soils has 
produced one of ecology’s puzzles. How can the prodigious 
life of rain forests be maintained on such nutrient-poor soils? 
Many  factors  contribute  to  the  maintenance  of  this  intense 
biological activity. Nadkarni’s research in the treetops uncov-
ered one of those factors, a significant store of nutrients in the 
rain forest canopy. 

 The nutrient stores in the rain forest canopy are associ-
ated  with  epiphytes.     Epiphytes     are  plants,  such  as  many 
orchids and ferns, that live on the branches and trunks of other 
plants.  Epiphytes  are  not  parasitic:  they  do  not  derive  their 
nutrition  from  the  plant  they  grow  on. As  they  grow  on  the 
branches  of  a  tree  they  begin  to  trap  organic  matter,  which 
eventually forms a mat. Epiphyte mats increase in thickness 
up  to  30  cm,  providing  a  complex  structure  that  supports  a 
diverse community of plants and animals. 

  Figure 1.6  
discovered helped solve an ecological puzzle.  

 Exploring the rain forest canopy. What Nalini Nadkarni 

 Epiphyte mats contain significant quantities of nutrients. 
Nadkarni estimated that these quantities in some tropical rain 
forests are equal to about half the nutrient content of the foli-
age of the canopy trees. In the temperate rain forests of the 
Olympic  Peninsula  in Washington,  the  mass  of  epiphytes  is 
four times the mass of leaves on their host trees. 

 Nadkarni’s  research  showed  that  in  both  temperate  and 
tropical rain forests, trees access these nutrient stores by send-
ing out roots from their trunks and branches high above the 
ground. These roots grow into the epiphyte mats and extract 
nutrients  from  them. As  a  consequence  of  this  research,  we 
now know that to understand the nutrient economy of rain for-
ests the ecologist must venture into the treetops. 

 Easier means of working in the rain forest canopy have 
been developed, and this research is no longer limited to the 
adventurous and agile. New ways to access the forest canopy 
range from hot air balloons and aerial trams to large cranes. 
The Wind River Canopy Crane offers scientists access to any 
level within a 70 m tall coniferous forest in a 2.3 ha area near 
the Columbia River Gorge in Washington ( fig. 1.7 ). Research 
projects supported—and made far easier—by this crane and 
others  have  included  the  ecology  of  migratory  birds  in  the 
forest  canopy,  photosynthesis  by  epiphytes  living  at  differ-
ent  canopy  heights,  and  vertical  stratification  of  habitat  use 
by bats and beetles (Ozanne et al. 2003). By 2006, there were 
12  canopy  cranes  facilitating  canopy  research  in  temperate 
and tropical forests worldwide (Stork 2007). Nadkarni points

out, in response to these developments, that the canopy as a 
physical frontier may be closing, but its exploration as a sci-
entific frontier is just beginning, particularly as we attempt to 
predict the ecological consequences of climate change. 

 Climatic and Ecological Change: 
Past and Future 
 The  earth  and  its  life  are  always  changing.  However,  many 
of the most important changes occur over such long periods 
of  time  or  at  such  large  spatial  scales  that  they  are  difficult 
to study. Two approaches that provide insights into long-term 
and  large-scale  processes  are  studies  of  pollen  preserved  in 
lake sediments and evolutionary studies. 

 Margaret Davis (1983, 1989) carefully searched through 
a  sample  of  lake  sediments  for  pollen.  The  sediments  had 
come  from  a  lake  in  the  Appalachian  Mountains,  and  the 
pollen  they  contained  would  help  her  document  changes  in 
the community of plants living near the lake during the past 
several  thousand  years.  Davis  is  a  paleoecologist  trained  to 
think at very large spatial scales and over very long periods of 
time. She has spent much of her professional career studying 
changes in the distributions of plants during the Quaternary 
period, particularly during the most recent 20,000 years. 

 Some of the pollen produced by plants that live near a 
lake falls on the lake surface, sinks, and becomes trapped in 

lake sediments. As lake sediments build up over the centu-
ries, this pollen is preserved and forms a historical record 
of the kinds of plants that lived nearby. As the lakeside veg-
etation  changes,  the  mix  of  pollen  preserved  in  the  lake’s 
sediments also changes. In the example shown in  figure 1.8 , 
pollen  from  spruce  trees,   Picea   spp.,  first  appears  in  lake 
sediments about 12,000 years ago then pollen from beech, 
 Fagus  grandifolia,   occurs  in  the  sediments  beginning 
about  8,000  years  ago.  Chestnut  pollen  does  not  appear 
in  the  sediments  until  about  2,000  years  ago.  The  pollen 
from all three tree species continues in the sediment record 
until  about  1920,  when  chestnut  blight  killed  most  of  the 
chestnut  trees  in  the  vicinity  of  the  lake. Thus,  the  pollen 
preserved  in  the  sediments  of  lakes  can  be  used  to  recon-
struct  the  history  of  vegetation  in  the  area.  Margaret  B. 
Davis, Ruth G. Shaw, and Julie R. Etterson review extensive 
evidence that during climate change, plants evolve, as well 
as disperse (Davis and Shaw 2001; Davis, Shaw, and Etter-
son 2005). As climate changes, plant populations simultane-
ously change their geographic distributions and undergo the 
evolutionary  process  of     adaptation    ,   which  increases  their 
ability to live in the new climatic regime. Meanwhile, evi-
dence of evolutionary responses to climate change is being 
discovered among many animal groups. William Bradshaw 
and  Christina  Holzapfel  (2006)  summarized  several  stud-
ies documenting evolutionary change in northern animals,

by Davis and her colleagues will be essential to predicting 
and  understanding  ecological  responses  to  global  climate 
change. 

 In the remainder of this book we will fill in the details 
of the sketch of ecology presented in this chapter. This brief 
survey has only hinted at the conceptual basis for the research 
described. Throughout  this  book  we  emphasize  the  concep-
tual  foundations  of  ecology.  Each  chapter  focuses  on  a  few 
 ecological concepts. We also explore some of the applications 
associated with the concepts introduced. Of course, the most 
important conceptual tool used by ecologists is the scientific 
method, which is introduced on page 9. 

 We continue our exploration of ecology in section I with 
natural history and evolution. Natural history is the founda-
tion on which ecologists build modern ecology for which evo-
lution provides a conceptual framework. A major premise of 
this book is that knowledge of natural history and evolution 
improves our understanding of ecological relationships.

 Investigating the Evidence 1 

 The Scientific Method—Questions and Hypotheses 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 1.8  Distinguish between questions and hypotheses in the 

scientific process.

 1.9  Discuss the scientific method, emphasizing hypoth-

esis testing.

 Ecologists  explore  the  relationships  between  organisms  and 
environment using the methods of science. The series of boxes 
called “Investigating the Evidence” that are found throughout 
the  chapters  of  this  book  discuss  various  aspects  of  the  sci-
entific method and its application to ecology. While each box 
describes only a small part of science, taken together, they rep-
resent a substantial introduction to the philosophy, techniques, 
and practice of ecological science. 

 Let  us  begin  this  distributed  discussion  with  the  most 
basic point. What is science? The word  science  comes from a 
Latin word meaning “to know.” Broadly speaking, science is 
a way of obtaining knowledge about the natural world using 
certain formal procedures. Those procedures, which make up 
what we call “the scientific method,” are outlined in  figure 1 . 
Despite  a  great  diversity  of  approaches  to  doing  science, 
sound  scientific  studies  have  many  methodological  charac-
teristics in common. The most universal and critical aspects 
of the scientific method are: asking interesting questions and 
forming testable hypotheses. 

Question

Hypotheses

  Questions and Hypotheses 
 What do scientists do? Simply put, scientists ask and attempt 
to  find  answers  to  questions  about  the  natural  world.  Ques-
tions  are  the  guiding  lights  of  the  scientific  process.  With-
out  them,  exploration  of  nature  lacks  focus  and  yields  little 
understanding of the world. Let’s consider a question asked 
by  an  ecologist  discussed  in  this  chapter.  The  main  ques-
tion  asked  by  Robert  MacArthur  in  his  studies  of  warblers 
(p.  4)  was  something  like  the  following:  “How  can  several 
species of insect-eating warblers live in the same forest with-
out one species eventually excluding the others through com-
petition?” While this focus on questions may seem obvious, 
one of the most common questions asked of scientists at semi-
nars and professional meetings is, “What is your question?” 

 If  scientists  are  in  the  business  of  asking  questions 
about  nature,  where  does  a  hypothesis  enter  the  process?

 Graphic summary of the scientific method. The scien-
tific method centers on the use of information to propose and test 
hypotheses through observation, experiment, and modeling.  

A hypothesis is a possible answer to a question. MacArthur’s 
main hypothesis (possible answer to his question) was: “Sev-
eral warbler species are able to coexist because each species 
feeds on insects living in different zones within trees.” 

 Once a scientist or team of scientists proposes a hypoth-
esis (or multiple alternative hypotheses), the next step in the 
scientific method is to determine its validity by testing predic-
tions that follow from the hypothesis. Three fundamental ways 
to test hypotheses are through observation, experiments, and 
modeling. These approaches, which are all represented in  fig-
ure 1 , will be discussed in detail in the “Investigating the Evi-
dence” boxes and in the research discussed in later chapters. 

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  1 
     1.  How does the development of new research tools, such as 
canopy cranes and stable isotope analysis, affect the pro-
cess of science as outlined by  figure 1  of this “Investigat-

Introduction to Ecology

  Summary 

  Ecologists study environmental relationships ranging from 
those of individual organisms to factors influencing global-
scale processes.  The research focus and questions posed by 
ecologists  differ  across  the  levels  of  ecological  organization 
studied.  

  Ecologists design their studies based on their research 
questions,  the  temporal  and  spatial  scale  of  their  stud-
ies,  and  available  research  tools.   With  this  brief  review 
of  research  approaches  and  topics,  we  return  to  the  question 
asked at the beginning of the chapter: What is ecology? Ecol-
ogy  is  indeed  the  study  of  relationships  between  organisms 
and the environment. However, as you can see from the studies 

reviewed,  ecologists  study  those  relationships  over  a  large 
range  of  temporal  and  spatial  scales  using  a  wide  variety  of 
approaches.  Ecology  includes  Davis’s  studies  of  vegetation 
moving  across  the  North American  continent  over  a  span  of 
thousands  of  years.  Ecology  also  includes  the  observational 
studies of birds in contemporary forests by MacArthur. Ecolo-
gists may study processes on plots measured in square centime-
ters or, like those studying the ecology of migratory birds, study 
areas may span thousands of kilometers. Important ecological 
discoveries have come from Nadkarni’s probing of the rain for-
est  canopy  and  from  traces  of  stable  isotopes  in  a  droplet  of 
blood. Ecology includes all these approaches and many more.

 Review Questions 

    1.  Faced with the complexity of nature, ecologists have divided the 
field of ecology into subdisciplines, each of which focuses on 
one of the levels of organization pictured in  figure 1.1 . What is 
the advantage of developing such subdisciplines within ecology?  
    2.  What are the pitfalls of subdividing nature in the way it is repre-
sented in  figure 1.1 ? In what ways does  figure 1.1  misrepresent 
nature?  

    3.  What  could  you  do  to  verify  that  the  distinct  feeding  zones 
used  by  the  warblers  studied  by  MacArthur  (see   fig.  1.3 )  are 
the result of ongoing competition between the different species 
of warblers? How might you examine the role of competition 
in keeping some American redstarts out of the most productive 
feeding areas on their wintering grounds?  

    4.  Although  Nalini  Nadkarni’s  studies  of  the  rain  forest  canopy 
addressed a question related to ecosystem structure, the patterns

of nutrient storage in rain forest canopy resulted from the biol-
ogy  of  individual  organisms,  populations  of  organisms,  and 
communities of species. Explain.  

    5.  What do the studies of Margaret Davis tell us about the compo-
sition of forests in the Appalachian Mountains during the past 
12,000 years (see  fig. 1.8 )? Based on this research, what pre-
dictions might you make about the future composition of these 
forests?  

    6.  During the course of the studies reviewed in this chapter, each 
scientist or team of scientists measured certain variables. What 
major  variable  studied  by  Margaret  Davis  and  her  research 
team  distinguishes  their  work  from  that  of  the  other  research 
reviewed in the chapter?

  D etailed  knowledge  of  natural  history  is  proving 

invaluable  to  restoration  of  natural  ecosystems 
across  the  globe.  One  of  the  most  dramatic  resto-
ration  successes  that  incorporated  natural  history  into  its 
approach comes from Costa Rica. Daniel Janzen’s goal was 
to restore tropical dry forest, a forest nearly as rich in species 
as  tropical  rain  forest,  to  Guanacaste  National  Park,  Costa

  Tigers,  Panthera   tigris,  live in several biomes. Despite a huge historic 
range extending from Turkey through the rain forests of southern Asia

3,000–5,000 in just 100 years (data from IUCN Redlist).

  Natural History and Evolution

  Figure 2.1    A guanacaste tree,  Enterolobium cyclocarpum,  growing 
in Costa Rica. Guanacaste trees, which produce large amounts of edible 
fruit, require large herbivores to disperse their seeds.  

Rica. As he studied the guanacaste tree,  Enterolobium cyclo-
carpum  ( fig. 2.1 ), however, he realized that something was 
missing from the present-day forest. The guanacaste tree, a 
member of the pea family, produces disk-shaped fruit about 
10 cm in diameter and 4 to 10 mm thick. Each year, a large 
tree  produces  up  to  5,000  of  these  fruits,  which  fall  to  the 
ground when ripe. Janzen asked, Why does the guanacaste 
tree produce so much fruit? His answer to this question was 
that  the  fruit  of  the  tree  should  promote  seed  dispersal  by 
animals. 

 Janzen,  however,  knew  of  no  living  native  animals  of 
the size and behavior that would make them dependable dis-
persers of guanacaste seeds. Dependable dispersers would be 
necessary  to  speed  restoration  of  tropical  dry  forest  across 
Guanacaste  National  Park.  True,  some  large  herbivores  fed 
on guanacaste fruits and dispersed the seeds with their feces. 
But  most  of  these  dispersers  were  cattle  and  horses,  which 
were introduced during the Spanish colonial period. Had the 
guanacaste tree evolved an elaborate fruit and produced thou-
sands of them each year in the absence of native dispersers? 
On the surface, it appeared so. 

 Janzen’s  restoration  of  tropical  dry  forest  was  guided 
by  his  knowledge  of      natural  history    ,   the  study  of  how 
organisms  in  a  particular  area  are  influenced  by  factors 
such  as  climate,  soils,  predators,  competitors,  and  evolu-
tionary history. Natural history eventually led Janzen to an 
understanding of the fruiting biology of the guanacaste tree. 
As he considered the long-term natural history of Central 
American dry forest, he found what he was looking for: a 
whole host of large herbivorous animals, including ground 
sloths,  camels,  and  horses.  The  dry  forest  had  once  sup-
ported  plenty  of  potential  dispersers  of  guanacaste  seeds. 
However,  all  these  large  animals  became  extinct  about 
10,000 years ago; overhunting by humans may have been a 
contributory factor. For thousands of years following these 
extinctions the guanacaste tree prepared its annual feast of 
fruits, but there were few large animals to consume them. 
Then  about  500  years  ago,  Europeans  introduced  horses 
and cattle, which ate the fruits of the guanacaste tree and 

dispersed its seeds around the landscape ( fig. 2.2 ). Janzen 
recognized the practical value of livestock as seed dispers-
ers  and  included  them  in  his  plan  for  tropical  dry  forest 
restoration. 

 Janzen  first  tested  the  hypothesis  that  contemporary 
horses can act as effective seed dispersers for the guanacaste 
tree. After this test, he applied his knowledge by incorporat-
ing horses into the management plan for Guanacaste National 
Park. The guanacaste tree and other trees in a similar predica-
ment would have their dispersers, and restoration of tropical 
dry forest would be accelerated. 

 Janzen’s  natural  history  of  tropical  dry  forest  also 
includes  people,  unlike  most  natural  histories.  He  worked 
closely  with  people  from  all  parts  of  Costa  Rican  society, 
from  the  president  of  the  country  to  local  schoolchildren. 
He realized that long-term support for Guanacaste National 
Park  depended  upon  its  contribution  to  the  economic 
and  cultural  well-being  of  local  people.  It’s  the  people  in 
 Janzen’s  natural  history  that  stand  guard  over  the  Guana-
caste  project.  Janzen  calls  his  approach  “biocultural  res-
toration,”  an  approach  that  seeks  to  preserve  tropical  dry 
forest for its own sake and as a place that provides a host of 
human benefits, ranging from drinking water to intellectual 
stimulation. Using natural history as their guide, Janzen and 
the people of Costa Rica are restoring tropical dry forest in 
Guanacaste National Park. 

 Janzen’s work (1981a, 1981b) shows how natural history 
can  be  used  to  address  a  practical  problem.  Natural  history 
also formed the foundation upon which modern ecology devel-
oped. Because ecological studies continue to be built upon a 
solid foundation of natural history, we devote  chapters 2 and 3 
to the natural history of the biosphere. In chapter 2, we exam-
ine the natural history of life on land. Before we begin that 
discussion, we need to introduce terrestrial biomes, the con-
cept around which this chapter is built. We also discuss the 
development and structure of soils, the foundation supporting 
terrestrial biomes. 

   Terrestrial Biomes 
 Chapter 2 focuses on major divisions of the terrestrial envi-
ronment  called      biomes    .   Biomes  are  distinguished  primarily 
by their predominant plants and are associated with particular 
climates. They consist of distinctive plant formations such as 
the tropical rain forest biome and the desert biome. Because 
tropical rain forest and desert are characterized by very differ-
ent types of plants and animals and occur in regions with very 
different climates, the natural histories of these biomes differ 
a great deal. The student of ecology should be aware of the 
major features of those differences. 

 The  main  goal  of  chapter  2  is  to  take  a  large-scale 
perspective  of  nature  before  delving,  in  later  chapters, 
into finer details of structure and process. We pay particu-
lar  attention  to  the  geographic  distributions  of  the  major 
biomes, the climate associated with each, their soils, their 
salient  biological  relationships,  and  the  extent  of  human 
influences.

  2.1  Large-Scale Patterns 
of Climatic Variation 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 2.3  Diagram the position of the sun relative to the 

 equator and tropics of Capricorn and Cancer, during 
the equinoxes and solstices.

 2.4  Describe how solar driven air circulation produces 

regional differences in precipitation.
Interpret a climate diagram.

 2.5 
 2.6  Explain the influence of the Coriolis effect on wind 

direction.

Uneven heating of the earth’s spherical surface by the sun 
and the tilt of the earth on its axis combine to produce pre-
dictable  latitudinal  and  seasonal  variation  in  climate.   In 
chapter 1, ecology was defined as the study of the relationships 
between  organisms  and  the  environment.  Consequently,  geo-
graphic and seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation 
are fundamental aspects of terrestrial ecology and natural his-
tory. Several attributes of climate vary predictably over the earth. 
For instance, average temperatures are lower and more seasonal 
at middle and high latitudes. Temperature generally shows little 

seasonality  near  the  equator,  while  rainfall  may  be  markedly 
seasonal. Deserts, which are concentrated in a narrow band of 
latitudes  around  the  globe,  receive  little  precipitation,  which 
generally falls unpredictably in time and space. What mecha-
nisms produce these and other patterns of climatic variation?  

   Temperature, Atmospheric Circulation, 
and Precipitation 
 Much of earth’s climatic variation is caused by uneven heat-
ing of its surface by the sun. This uneven heating results from 
the spherical shape of the earth and the angle at which the 
earth rotates on its axis as it orbits the sun. Because the earth 
is a sphere, the sun’s rays are most concentrated where the 
sun is directly overhead. However, the latitude at which the 
sun is directly overhead changes with the seasons. This sea-
sonal change occurs because the earth’s axis of rotation is not 
perpendicular to its plane of orbit about the sun but is tilted 
approximately 23.5 8  away from the perpendicular ( fig. 2.3 ). 
 Because  this  tilted  angle  of  rotation  is  maintained 
throughout  earth’s  orbit  about  the  sun,  the  amount  of  solar 
energy received by the Northern and Southern Hemispheres 
changes seasonally. During the northern summer the Northern 
Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun and receives more solar 
energy  than  the  Southern  Hemisphere.  During  the  northern

summer solstice on approximately June 21, the sun is directly 
overhead at the tropic of Cancer, at 23.5 8  N latitude. During 
the northern winter solstice, on approximately  December 21, 
the  sun  is  directly  overhead  at  the  tropic  of  Capricorn,  at 
23.5 8   S  latitude.  During  the  northern  winter,  the  Northern 
Hemisphere  is  tilted  away  from  the  sun  and  the  Southern 
Hemisphere  receives  more  solar  energy. The  sun  is  directly 
overhead at the equator during the spring and autumnal equi-
noxes, on approximately March 21 and September 22 or 23. 
On  those  dates,  the  Northern  and  Southern  Hemispheres 
receive approximately equal amounts of solar radiation. 

 This seasonal shift in the latitude at which the sun is directly 
overhead drives the march of the seasons. At high latitudes, in 
both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, seasonal shifts in 
input of solar energy produce winters with low average temper-
atures and shorter day lengths and summers with high average 
temperatures and longer day lengths. In many areas at middle 
to high latitudes there are also significant seasonal changes in 
precipitation.  Meanwhile,  between  the  tropics  of  Cancer  and 
Capricorn,  seasonal  variations  in  temperature  and  day  length 
are slight, while precipitation may vary a great deal. What pro-
duces spatial and temporal variation in precipitation? 

 Heating  of  the  earth’s  surface  and  atmosphere  drives 
circulation of the atmosphere and influences patterns of pre-
cipitation. As  shown  in   figure  2.4  a,   the  sun  heats  air  at  the 
equator, causing it to expand and rise. This warm, moist air 
cools  as  it  rises.  Since  cool  air  holds  less  water  vapor  than 
warm air, the water vapor carried by this rising air mass con-
denses  and  forms  clouds,  which  produce  the  heavy  rainfall 
associated with tropical environments. 

 Eventually,  this  equatorial  air  mass  ceases  to  rise  and 
spreads north and south. This high-altitude air is dry, since the 
moisture it once held fell as tropical rains. As this air mass flows 
north and south, it cools, which increases its density. Eventu-
ally, it sinks back to the earth’s surface at about 30 8  latitude and

spreads north and south. This dry air draws moisture from the 
lands over which it flows and creates deserts in the process. 

 Air moving from 30 8  latitude toward the equator com-
pletes  an  atmospheric  circulation  cell  at  low  latitudes.  As 
  figure 2.4  b  shows, there are three such cells on either side of 
the equator. Air moving from 30 8  latitude toward the poles is 
part of the atmospheric circulation cell at middle latitudes. 
This warm air flowing from the south rises as it meets cold 
polar air flowing from the north. As this air mass rises, mois-
ture picked up at lower latitudes condenses to form the clouds 
that produce the abundant precipitation of temperate regions. 
The air rising over temperate regions spreads northward and 
southward  at  a  high  altitude,  completing  the  middle-  and 
high-latitude cells of general atmospheric circulation. 

 The  patterns  of  atmospheric  circulation  shown  in 
  figure  2.4  b   suggest  that  air  movement  is  directly  north  and 
south. However, this does not reflect what we observe from 
the earth’s surface as the earth rotates from west to east. An 
observer at tropical latitudes observes winds that blow from 
the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the south-
east  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  ( fig.  2.5 ).  These  are  the 
 northeast   and   southeast  trades.   Someone  studying  winds 
within the temperate belt between 30 8  and 60 8  latitude would 
observe  that  winds  blow  mainly  from  the  west.  These  are 
the   westerlies   of  temperate  latitudes. At  high  latitudes,  our 
observer  would  find  that  the  predominant  wind  direction  is 
from the east. These are the  polar easterlies.  

 Why don’t winds move directly north to south? The pre-
vailing winds do not move in a straight north–south direction 
because of the     Coriolis effect    .  In the Northern Hemisphere, the 
Coriolis effect causes an apparent deflection of winds to the right 
of their direction of travel and to the left in the Southern Hemi-
sphere. We say “apparent” deflection because we see this deflec-
tion only if we make our observations from the surface of the 
earth. To an observer in space, it would appear that winds move

them. However, we need to keep in mind that the perspective 
from the earth’s surface is the ecologically relevant perspective. 
The biomes that we discuss in chapter 2 are as earthbound as 
our hypothetical observer. Their distributions across the globe 
are substantially influenced by global climate, particularly geo-
graphic variations in temperature and precipitation. 

 Geographic  variation  in  temperature  and  precipitation  is 
very  complex.  How  can  we  study  and  represent  geographic 
variation in these climatic variables without being overwhelmed 
by a mass of numbers? This practical problem is addressed by 
a visual device called a climate diagram.  

  Climate Diagrams 
     Climate diagrams    were developed by Heinrich Walter (1985) 
as a tool to explore the relationship between the distribution of 
terrestrial vegetation and climate. Climate diagrams summarize 
a great deal of useful climatic information, including seasonal 
variation in temperature and precipitation, the length and inten-
sity of wet and dry seasons, and the portion of the year during 
which average minimum temperature is above and below 0 8 C. 
 As shown in  figure 2.6 , climate diagrams summarize cli-
matic information using a standardized structure. The months 
of the year are plotted on the horizontal axis, beginning with

ern Hemisphere and beginning with July and ending with June 
in  the  Southern  Hemisphere.  Temperature  is  plotted  on  the 
left  vertical  axis  and  precipitation  on  the  right  vertical  axis. 
Temperature and precipitation are plotted on different scales 
so that 10 8 C is equivalent to 20 mm of precipitation. Climate 
diagrams for wet areas such as tropical rain forest compress 
the  precipitation  scale  for  precipitation  above  100  mm  so 
that 10 8 C is equivalent to 200 mm of precipitation. With this 
change in scale, rainfall data from very wet climates can be 
fit on a graph of convenient size. This change in scale is rep-
resented by darker shading in the climate diagram for Kuala 
Lumpur, Malaysia ( fig. 2.7  a ). Notice that the precipitation at 
Kuala Lumpur exceeds 100 mm during all months of the year. 
 Because the temperature and precipitation scales are con-
structed so that 10 8 C equals 20 mm of precipitation, the rela-
tive positions of the temperature and precipitation lines reflect 
water  availability.  Theoretically,  adequate  moisture  for  plant 
growth exists when the precipitation line lies above the tem-
perature line. These moist periods are indicated in the figure 
by blue shading. When the temperature line lies above the pre-
cipitation line, potential evaporation rate exceeds precipitation. 
These dry periods are indicated by gold shading in the climate 
diagram. Notice that gold shading of the climate diagram for 
Yuma, Arizona ( fig. 2.7  b ), indicates year-round drought, while 
the blue shading of the climate diagram for Kuala Lumpur ( see 
fig. 2.7  a ) indicates moist conditions year-round. 

 The  climate  diagram  for  Dzamiin  Uuded,  Mongolia 
( fig. 2.7  c ), is much more complex than those of either the rain 

forest  or  hot  desert. This  complexity  results  from  the  much 
greater seasonal change in the cold desert climate. Dzamiin 
Uuded  is  moist  from  October  to April. These  moist  periods 
are separated by the months of May to September, when the 
temperature line rises above the precipitation line, indicating 
drought. During October to April, the mean  minimum  temper-
ature at Dzamiin Uuded is below freezing (0 8 C). The months 
when the mean minimum temperature is above freezing are 
May through September. 

 Climate diagrams also include the mean annual tempera-
ture, which is presented in the upper left corner (e.g., 27.5 8 C 
at  Kuala  Lumpur).  The  mean  annual  precipitation  (e.g., 
86 mm at Yuma, Arizona) is presented in the upper right cor-
ner  of  each  climate  diagram.  The  elevation  of  each  site,  in 
meters above sea level (e.g., 962 m at Dzamiin Uuded), is also 
presented in the upper right corner. 

 As you can see, climate diagrams efficiently summarize 
important  environmental  variables.  In  Concept  section  2.3, 
we use climate diagrams to represent the climates associated 
with major terrestrial biomes. 

  Concept 2.1 Review 

      1.   How would seasonality in temperature and precipitation 
be affected if earth’s rotation on its axis were perpen-
dicular to its plane of orbit about the sun?  

     2.   Why does the annual rainy season in regions near 23 8  N 

latitude begin in June?       

  2.2  Soil: The Foundation 
of Terrestrial Biomes 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 2.7  Draw a soil profile, including typical soil horizons.
 2.8  Describe the characteristics of each of the typical 

soil horizons.

 2.9  Discuss how climate, organisms, topography,  parent 

material, and time can influence soil  development 
and structure.

   Soil  structure  results  from  the  long-term  interaction 
of  climate,  organisms,  topography,  and  parent  mineral 
material.   Soil is a complex mixture of living and nonliving 
material upon which most terrestrial life depends. Here we 
summarize  the  general  features  of  soil  structure  and  devel-
opment. The biome discussions that follow include specific 
information about the soils associated with each. 

 Soil  structure  can  be  observed  by  digging  a  soil  pit,  a 
hole in the ground 1 to 3 m deep. In a soil pit you see one of 
the most significant aspects of soil structure, its vertical lay-
ering. Though soil structure usually changes gradually with 
depth, soil scientists generally divide soils into several dis-
crete horizons. In the classification system used here the soil

population.

 2.11  Explain how a sample mean represents a statistical 

estimate.

One of the most common and important steps in the process-
ing of data is the production of summary statistics. First, what 
is a statistic? A statistic is a number that is used by scientists 
to  estimate  a  measurable  characteristic  of  an  entire  popula-
tion. Population characteristics of interest to an ecologist might 
include features such as average mass, growth rate, or, as in this 
chapter, air temperature. In order to determine the exact average 
value  of  such  population  characteristics,  the  ecologist  would 
have to measure every individual in the population. Clearly, the 
opportunity to measure or test all the individuals in a population 
for any characteristic is extremely rare. For instance, an ecolo-
gist studying reproductive rate in a population of birds would 
be unlikely to locate and study all the nests in the population. 
As  a  consequence,  ecologists  generally  estimate  reproductive 
rates for birds, or other characteristics of any population, using 
samples  drawn  randomly  from  the  population.  An  ecologist 
working with a population of rare plants, for example, might 
locate 11 seedlings and calculate the average height of these 11 
individual plants. This average calculated from the sample of 
11 seedlings would be the    sample mean    .  The sample mean is a 
statistical estimate of the true population mean. 

 The sample mean is one of the most common and use-
ful summary statistics. It is a statistic that we use extensively 
in this chapter as we discuss average temperature or average 
precipitation for biomes around the world (see  fig 2.6 , p. 16). 
How is the sample mean calculated? Consider the following 
sample of seedling height. 

 What  was  the  average  height  of  seedlings  in  the  population 
at the time of the study? Since we did not locate all the seed-
lings, we cannot know the true population mean, or parameter. 
However, our sample of 11 seedlings allows us to calculate a 
sample mean as follows:

   Sum of measurements 5 SX 
SX 5 316181712141914151718
SX 5 63

We  calculate  the  sample  mean  by  dividing  the  sum  of  mea-
surements by the number of seedlings measured:

–

n 5 sample size, or 11 
–
X 5   
–
X 5   
–
X 5 5.7 cm

SX
 ___ n   
63 ___ 11   

Again, 5.7 cm, the sample mean, is the ecologist’s estimate of 
the true mean height of seedlings in the entire population at the 
time of the study. 

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  2 
     1.  If  you  measured  the  heights  of  100  seedlings  randomly 
drawn  from  the  hypothetical  population,  instead  of  the 
11 measured in the example, would the sample mean be 
likely to be exactly 5.7 cm?  

    2.  Would the mean height of a sample of 100 seedlings likely 
be closer to the true population mean than the mean of a 
sample of 11?    

profile is divided into O, A, B, and C horizons ( fig. 2.8 ). The 
O    ,  or     organic, horizon    lies at the top of the profile. The most 
superficial layer of the O horizon is made up of freshly fallen 
organic  matter,  including  whole  leaves,  twigs,  and  other 
plant parts. The deeper portions of the O horizon consist of 
highly fragmented and partially decomposed organic matter. 
Fragmentation  and  decomposition  of  the  organic  matter  in 
this  horizon  are  mainly  due  to  the  activities  of  soil  organ-
isms,  including  bacteria,  fungi,  and  animals  ranging  from 
nematodes and mites to burrowing mammals. This horizon is 
usually absent in agricultural soils and deserts. At its deepest 
levels, the O horizon merges gradually with the A horizon. 

 The      A  horizon     contains  a  mixture  of  mineral  materi-
als, such as clay, silt, and sand, and organic material derived 
from the O horizon. The A and O horizons both support high 
levels  of  biological  activity.  Burrowing  animals,  such  as 
earthworms, mix organic matter from the O horizon into the 
A horizon. The A horizon is generally rich in mineral nutri-
ents.  It  is  gradually  leached  of  clays,  iron,  aluminum,  sili-
cates,  and  humus,  which  is  partially  decomposed  organic 
matter. These substances slowly move down through the soil 
profile until they are deposited in the B horizon. 

 The      B  horizon     contains  the  clays,  humus,  and  other 
materials  that  have  been  transported  by  water  from  the

A horizon. The deposition of these materials often gives the 
B horizon a distinctive color and banding pattern. This  horizon 
is also occupied by the roots of many plants. The B horizon 
gradually merges with the C horizon. 

 The     C horizon    is the deepest layer in our soil pit. It con-
sists of weathered parent material, which has been worked by 
the  actions  of  frost,  water,  and  the  deeper   penetrating  roots 
of plants. Weathering slowly breaks the parent material into 
smaller  and  smaller  fragments  to  produce  sand,  silt,  and 
clay-sized  particles.  Because  weathering  is  incomplete  and 
less intense than in the A and B horizons, the C horizon may 
contain many rock fragments. Under the C horizon we find 
unweathered parent material, which is often bedrock. 

 The  soil  profile  gives  us  a  snapshot  of  soil  structure. 
However,  soil  structure  is  in  a  constant  state  of  flux  as  a 
consequence  of  several  influences.  Those  influences  were 
summarized  by  Hans  Jenny  (1980)  as  climate,  organisms, 
topography,  parent  material,  and  time.  Climate  affects  the 
rate  of  weathering  of  parent  materials,  the  rate  of  leaching 
of organic and inorganic substances, the rate of erosion and 
transport of mineral particles, and the rate of decomposition 
of organic matter. Climate also influences the kinds of veg-
etation  and  animals  that  occupy  an  area.  These  organisms, 
in turn, influence the quantity and quality of organic matter 
added  to  soil  and  the  rate  of  soil  mixing  by  burrowing  ani-
mals. Topography affects the rates and direction of water flow 
and patterns of erosion. Meanwhile, parent materials, such as 
granite, volcanic rock, and wind- or water-transported sand, 
set the stage for all other influences. Last is the matter of time. 
Soil age influences soil structure. 

 In short, soil is a complex and dynamic entity. It forms 
the  medium  in  which  organisms  grow,  and  the  activities  of 
those organisms, in turn, affect soil structure. As with many 
aspects of ecology, it is often difficult to separate organisms 
from  their  environment.  The  biome  discussions  that  follow 

provide additional information on soils by including aspects 
of soil structure and chemistry characteristic of each biome. 

  Concept 2.2 Review 

      1.   The  organic  horizon  is  generally  absent  from  agricul-
tural soils because tilling, e.g., plowing, buries organic 
matter.  Why  is  an  organic  horizon  generally  absent 
from desert soils?

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 2.12  List the major terrestrial biomes.
 2.13  Describe the climatic differences among the biomes.
 2.14  Contrast the soils typical of the terrestrial biomes.
 2.15  Describe the types of vegetation, animals, and other 

organisms characteristic of the terrestrial biomes.

terrestrial biomes.

   The  geographic  distribution  of  terrestrial  biomes  corre-
sponds  closely  to  variation  in  climate,  especially  prevailing 
temperature and precipitation.   Early in the twentieth century, 
many  plant  ecologists  studied  how  climate  and  soils  influence 
the distribution of vegetation. Later ecologists concentrated on 
other aspects of plant ecology. Today, as we face the prospect of 
global warming (see chapter 23), ecologists are once again study-
ing  climatic  influences  on  the  distribution  of  vegetation.  Inter-
national teams of ecologists, geographers, and climatologists are

exploring the influences of climate on vegetation with renewed 
interest and with much more powerful analytical tools. 

 In this section, we discuss the climate, soils, and organ-
isms  of  the  earth’s  major  biomes  and  how  they  have  been 
influenced by humans.  

   Tropical Rain Forest 
     Tropical  rain  forest     is  nature’s  most  extravagant  garden 
( fig.  2.9 ).  Beyond  its  tangled  edge,  a  rain  forest  opens  into 

a surprisingly spacious interior, illuminated by dim, greenish 
light shining through a ceiling of leaves. High above towers 
the forest canopy, home to many rain forest species and the 
aerial laboratory of a few intrepid rain forest ecologists (see 
fig.  1.6). The  architecture  of  rain  forests,  with  their  vaulted 
ceilings and spires, has invited comparisons to cathedrals and 
mansions.  However,  this  cathedral  is  alive  from  ceiling  to 
floor, perhaps more alive than any other biome on the planet. 
In the rain forest, the sounds of evening and morning, the bril-
liant flashes of color, and rich scents carried on moist night air 
speak of abundant life, in seemingly endless variety. 

 Geography 
 Tropical rain forests straddle the equator in three major regions: 
Southeast Asia, West Africa,  and  South America  ( fig.  2.10 ). 
Most rain forest occurs within 10 8  of latitude north or south 
of the equator. Outside this equatorial band are the rain forests 
of Central America and Mexico, southeastern Brazil, eastern 
Madagascar, southern India, and northeastern Australia. 

  Climate 
 The  global  distribution  of  rain  forests  corresponds  to  areas 
where conditions are warm and wet year-round ( see fig. 2.10 ). 
Temperatures in tropical rain forests vary little from month to 
month and often change as much in a day as they do over the 
entire year. Average temperatures are about 25   8  2 27   8 C, lower 
than  average  maximum  summer  temperatures  in  many  des-
erts and temperate regions. Annual rainfall ranges from about

2,000 to 4,000 mm, and some rain forests receive even more 
precipitation. In a rain forest, a month with less than 100 mm 
of rain is considered dry.  

  Soils 
 Heavy  rains  gradually  leach  nutrients  from  rain  forest  soils 
and rapid decomposition in the warm, moist rain forest cli-
mate  keeps  the  quantity  of  soil  organic  matter  low.  Conse-
quently, rain forest soils are often nutrient-poor, acidic, thin, 
and low in organic matter. In many rain forests, more nutri-
ents are tied up in living tissue than in soil. Some rain for-
ests, however, occur where soils are very fertile. For instance, 
rain forests grow on young, volcanic soils that have not yet 
been leached of their nutrients by heavy tropical rains. Fertile 
rain forest soils also occur along rivers, where a fresh nutri-
ent  supply  is  delivered  with  each  flood.  Rain  forest  plants 
are  adept  at  conserving  nutrients.  They  get  help  in  gather-
ing nutrients from infertile soils from fungi associated with 
their  roots,  through  mutually  beneficial  partnerships  called 
     mycorrhizae    .   Free-living  fungi,  bacteria,  and  soil  animals, 
such as mites and springtails, rapidly scavenge nutrients from 
plant litter (leaves, flowers, etc.) and animal wastes, further 
tightening the nutrient economy.  

  Biology 
 Many  organisms  in  the  rain  forest  have  evolved  to  use  the 
vertical dimension provided by trees. Trees dominate the rain 
forest  landscape  and  average  about  40  m  in  height.  How-
ever,  some  reach  50,  60,  or  even  80  m  tall. These  rain  for-
est  giants  are  often  supported  by  well-developed  buttresses. 
The diversity of rain forest trees is also impressive. One hect-
are (100 m  3  100 m) of temperate forest may contain a few 
dozen tree species; 1 ha of tropical rain forest may contain up 
to 300 tree species. 

 The three-dimensional framework formed by rain forest 
trees is festooned with other plant growth forms. The trees are 
trellises for climbing vines and growing sites for epiphytes, 
plants that grow on other plants ( fig. 2.11 ). The great diversity 
and sheer mass of epiphytes and vines give an impression of 
great biological richness, of a forest teeming with life. Look 
closely  at  rain  forest  animals  and  that  impression  is  ampli-
fied. A  single  rain  forest  tree  may  support  several  thousand 
species of insects, many of which have not been described by 
scientists. 

 The  rain  forest  is  not,  however,  just  a  warehouse  for  a 
large  number  of  dissociated  species.  Rain  forest  ecology  is 
marked  by  intricate,  complex  relationships  between  spe-
cies.  In  the  tropical  rain  forest  there  are  plants  that  cannot 
live without particular species of ants, mites that make their 
homes in the flowers of plants and depend on hummingbirds 
to  get  them  from  flower  to  flower,  and  trees  and  vines  that 
compete continuously for light and space.

bananas,  and  sugarcane,  and  approximately  25%  of  all  pre-
scription drugs were originally derived from tropical plants. 
Many more species, directly useful to humans, may await dis-
covery. Unfortunately, tropical rain forests are fast disappear-
ing, diminishing our chances of understanding the extent and 
dynamics of biological diversity.   

  Tropical Dry Forest 
 During the dry season, the     tropical dry forest    is all earth tones; 
in the rainy season, it’s an emerald tangle ( fig. 2.12 ). Life in 
the tropical dry forest responds to the rhythms of the annual 
solar cycle, which drives the oscillation between wet and dry 
seasons. During the dry season, most trees in the tropical dry 
forest are dormant. Then, as the rains approach, trees flower 
and insects appear to pollinate them. The pace of life quick-
ens. Eventually, as the first storms of the wet season arrive, the 
trees produce their leaves and transform the landscape. 

  Human Influences 
 People from all over the globe owe more to the tropics than is 
generally realized. Many of the world’s staple foods, includ-
ing maize (called corn in North America and  Australia), rice, 

 Geography 
 Tropical dry forests occupy a substantial portion of the earth’s 
surface  between  about  10 8   and  25 8   latitude  ( fig.  2.13 ).  In 
Africa,  tropical  dry  forests  are  found  both  north  and  south

of the central African rain forests. In the Americas, tropical 
dry forests are the natural vegetation of extensive areas south 
and north of the Amazon rain forest. Tropical dry forests also 
extend up the west coast of Central America and into North 
America  along  the  west  coast  of  Mexico.  In Asia,  tropical 
dry  forests  are  the  natural  vegetation  of  most  of  India  and 
the Indochina peninsula. Australian tropical dry forests form 

a continuous band across the northern and northeastern por-
tions of the continent. 

  Climate 
 The climate of tropical dry forests is more seasonal than that 
of  tropical  rain  forests.  The  three  climate  diagrams  shown

ing 5 to 6 months. The climate diagrams also indicate more 
seasonal  variation  in  temperature  compared  to  tropical  rain 
forest.  

  Soils 
 The soils of many tropical dry forests are of great age, partic-
ularly those in the parts of Africa, Australia, India, and  Brazil 
that were once part of the ancient southern continent of Gond-
wana. The soils of tropical dry forests tend to be less acidic 
than those of rain forests and are generally richer in nutrients. 
However, the annual pulses of torrential rain make the soils of 
tropical dry forest highly vulnerable to erosion.  

  Biology 
 The plants of the tropical dry forest are strongly influenced by 
physical factors. For example, the height of the dry forest is 
highly correlated with average precipitation. Trees are tallest 
in the wettest areas. In the driest habitats, all trees drop their 
leaves during the dry season; in wetter areas over 50% may 
be evergreen. As in the tropical rain forest, many plants pro-
duce animal-dispersed seeds. However, wind-dispersed seeds 
are also common. Many dry forest birds, mammals, and even 
insects  make  seasonal  migrations  to  wetter  habitats  along 
 rivers or to the nearest rain forest.  

  Human Influences 
 Peter  Murphy  and  Ariel  Lugo  (1986)  studied  the  pat-
terns  of  human  settlement  in  the  tropical  forests  of  Cen-
tral America, dividing the types of forests into rain forest, 
wet  forest,  moist  forest,  dry  forest,  and  very  dry  forest. 
As  figure 2.14  shows, the population density—the number 
of people per square  kilometer—in tropical dry and moist

forests  is  more  than  10  times  higher  than  in  tropical  wet 
and rain forests. 

 Heavy human settlement has devastated the tropical dry 
forest. While  the  world’s  attention  has  been  focused  on  the 
plight  of  rain  forests,  intact  tropical  dry  forests  have  nearly 
disappeared.  The  relatively  fertile  soil  of  tropical  dry  for-
ests  has  attracted  agricultural  development,  including  cattle 
ranches,  grain  farms,  and  cotton  fields. Tropical  dry  forests 
are more easily converted to agriculture compared to rain for-
ests,  since  the  dry  season  makes  them  more  accessible  and 
easier to burn. 

 The  loss  of  the  dry  forest  is  significant  because,  while 
rain forests may support a somewhat greater number of spe-
cies, many dry forest species are found nowhere else. How-
ever,  out  of  this  devastation  has  come  Guanacaste  National 
Park in Costa Rica, a model attempt to restore a tropical dry 
forest in a way that also helps serve the cultural and economic 
needs of local people (see the introduction to chapter 2).   

 Tropical Savanna 
 Stand in the middle of a savanna, a tropical grassland dotted 
with scattered trees, and your eye will be drawn to the hori-
zon for the approach of thunderstorms or wandering herds of 
wildlife ( fig. 2.15 ). The     tropical savanna    is the kingdom of 
the farsighted, the stealthy, and the swift and is the birthplace 
of humankind. It was from here that we eventually moved out 
into every biome. Though most humans live away from this 
first home, the fascination continues. 

 Geography 
 Most tropical savannas occur north and south of tropical dry 
forests within 10 8  to 20 8  of the equator. In Africa south of the 
Sahara Desert, tropical savannas extend from the west to the 
east  coasts,  cut  a  north–south  swath  across  the  east African 
highlands,  and  reappear  in  south-central  Africa  ( fig.  2.16 ). 
In  South  America,  tropical  savannas  occur  in  south-central 
Brazil  and  cover  a  great  deal  of  Venezuela  and  Colombia. 
Tropical savannas are also the natural vegetation of much of 
northern Australia in the region just south of the tropical dry 
forest.  Savanna  is  also  the  natural  vegetation  of  an  area  in 
southern Asia just east of the Indus River in eastern Pakistan 
and northwestern India. 

  Climate 
 As in the tropical dry forest, life on the savanna cycles to the 
rhythms  of  alternating  dry  and  wet  seasons  (see   fig.  2.16 ). 
Here,  however,  seasonal  drought  combines  with  another 
important physical factor, fire. The rains come in summer and 
are  accompanied  by  intense  lightning.  This  lightning  often 
starts  fires,  particularly  at  the  beginning  of  the  wet  season 
when  the  savanna  is  tinder  dry. These  fires  kill  young  trees 
while the grasses survive and quickly resprout. Consequently, 
fires  help  maintain  the  tropical  savanna  as  a  landscape  of 
grassland and scattered trees. 

 The savanna climate is generally drier than that of tropical 
dry forest. However, San Fernando, Venezuela (see  fig. 2.16 ), 

24

receives as much rainfall as a tropical dry forest. Other savan-
nas occur in areas that are as dry as deserts. What keeps the 
wet savannas near San Fernando from being replaced by for-
est and how can savannas persist under desertlike conditions? 
The answer lies deep in the savanna soils.  

  Soils 
 Soil layers with low permeability to water play a key role in 
maintaining  many  tropical  savannas.  For  instance,  because 
a dense, impermeable subsoil retains water near the surface, 
savannas occur in areas of southwest Africa that would other-
wise support only desert. Impermeable soils also help savan-
nas persist in wet areas, particularly in South America. Trees 
do  not  move  onto  savannas  where  an  impermeable  subsoil 
keeps  surface  soils  waterlogged  during  the  wet  season.  In 
these  landscapes,  scattered  trees  occur  only  where  soils  are 
well drained.  

  Biology 
 As you gaze out across the savanna landscape, think back to 
the tropical rain forest and dry forest. How is the savanna dif-
ferent? One difference is that trees don’t completely dominate 
the landscape. Consequently, a greater proportion of the bio-
logical activity on the savanna takes place near ground level. 
Frequent fires have selected for fire resistance in the savanna 
flora.  The  few  tree  species  on  the  savanna  resist  fire  well 
enough to be unaffected by low-intensity fires. 

 The tropical savanna is populated by wandering animals 
that move in response to seasonal and year-to-year variations 

in  rainfall  and  food  availability.  The  wandering  consumers 
of the Australian savannas include kangaroos, large flocks of 
birds, and, for about 50,000 years, humans. During droughts, 
some of these Australian species travel thousands of kilome-
ters in search of suitable conditions. The African savanna is 
also home to a host of well-known mobile consumers, such 
as  elephants,  wildebeest,  giraffes,  zebras,  lions,  and,  again, 
humans (see  fig. 2.15 ).  

 Human Influences 
 Humans are, in some measure, a product of the savanna and 
the  savanna,  in  turn,  has  been  influenced  by  human  activ-
ity. One of the factors that forged an indelible link between 
us  and  this  biome  is  fire.  Long  before  the  appearance  of 
hominids,  fire  played  a  role  in  the  ecology  of  the  tropi-
cal  savanna.  Later,  the  savanna  was  the  classroom  where 
early  humans  observed  and  learned  to  use,  control,  and 
make fire. Eventually, humans began to purposely set fire to 
the savanna, which, in turn, helped to maintain and spread 
the savanna itself. We had begun to manipulate nature on a 
large scale. 

 Originally, humans subsisted on the savanna by hunt-
ing  and  gathering.  In  time,  they  shifted  from  hunting  to 
pastoralism,  replacing  wild  game  with  domestic  grazers 
and browsers. Today, livestock ranching is the main source 
of  livelihood  in  all  the  savanna  regions.  In  Africa,  live-
stock raising has coexisted with wildlife for millennia. In 
 modern-day subsaharan Africa, however, the combination 
of  growing  human  populations,  high  density  of  livestock,

and  drought  has  devastated  much  of  the  region  known  as 
the Sahel ( fig. 2.17 ). 

  Desert 
 In the spare     desert    landscape, sculpted by wind and water, the 
ecologist grows to appreciate geology, hydrology, and climate 
as much as organisms ( fig. 2.18 ). In the desert, drought and 
flash floods, and heat and bitter cold, often go hand in hand. 
Yet, the often repeated description of life in the desert as “life 
on the edge” betrays an outsider’s view. Life in the desert is not 
luxuriant, but it does not follow that living conditions there are 
necessarily harsh. For many species, the desert is the center of 
their world, not the edge. In their own way, many desert organ-
isms flourish on meager rations of water, high temperatures, 
and saline soils. To understand life in the desert, the ecologist 
must see it from the perspective of its natural inhabitants. 

 Geography 
 Deserts occupy about 20% of the land surface of the earth. Two 
bands of deserts ring the globe, one at about 30 8  N  latitude and 
one at about 30 8  S ( fig. 2.19 ). These bands correspond to lati-
tudes where dry subtropical air descends (see  fig. 2.4 ), drying 
the landscape as it spreads north and south. Other deserts are 
found either deep in the interior of continents, for example, 

  Figure 2.17    Domestic livestock, such as these cattle on an 
African savanna, have had a major impact on tropical savannas around 
the world.  

the Gobi of central Asia, or in the rain shadow of mountains, 
for example, the Great Basin Desert of North America. Still 
others are found along the cool western coasts of continents, 
for example, the Atacama of South America and the Namib of 
southwestern Africa, where air circulating across a cool ocean 
delivers a great deal of fog to the coast but little rain. 

26 

Section I 

  Natural History and Evolution

  Figure 2.18    Life on the edge. Sparse desert vegetation stabilizes a patch of soil at the edge of a field of giant dunes in the Namib Desert 
in southwestern Africa.  

  Climate 
 Environmental conditions vary considerably from one desert 
to  another.  Some,  such  as  the Atacama  and  central  Sahara, 
receive very little rainfall and fit the stereotype of deserts as 
extremely  dry  places.  Other  deserts,  such  as  some  parts  of 
the  Sonoran  Desert  of  North  America,  may  receive  nearly 
300  mm  of  rainfall  annually.  Whatever  their  mean  annual 
rainfall, however, water loss in deserts due to evaporation and 
transpiration by plants exceeds precipitation during most of 
the year. 

  Figure  2.19   includes  the  climate  diagrams  of  two  hot 
deserts.  Notice  that  drought  conditions  prevail  during  all 
months  and  that  during  some  months  average  temperatures 
exceed  30 8 C.  Shade  temperatures  greater  than  56 8 C  have 
been  recorded  in  the  deserts  of  North  Africa  and  western 
North America. However, some deserts can be bitterly cold. 
For example, average winter temperatures at Dzamiin Uuded, 
Mongolia, in the Gobi Desert of central Asia sometimes fall to 
 2 20   8 C (see  fig. 2.19 ).  

  Soils 
 Desert  plants  and  animals  can  turn  this  landscape  into  a 
mosaic of diverse soils. Desert soils are generally so low in 
organic matter that they are sometimes classified as     lithosols    ,  
which means stone or mineral soil. However, the soils under 
desert shrubs often contain large amounts of organic matter 

and  form  islands  of  fertility.  Desert  animals  can  also  affect 
soil properties. For example, in North America, kangaroo rats 
change the texture and elevate the nutrient content of surface 
soils  by  burrowing  and  hoarding  seeds.  In  Middle  Eastern 
deserts, porcupines and isopods strongly influence a variety 
of soil properties. 

 Desert soils, particularly those in poorly-drained valleys 
and lowlands, may contain high concentrations of salts. Salts 
accumulate in these soils as water evaporates from the soil 
surface, leaving behind any salts that were dissolved in the 
water.  Salt  accumulation  increases  the  aridity  of  the  desert 
environment by making it harder for plants to extract water 
from the soils. As desert soils age they tend to form a cal-
cium  carbonate–rich  hardpan  horizon  called      caliche    .   The 
extent of caliche formation has proved a useful tool for aging 
these soils.  

  Biology 
 The desert landscape presents an unfamiliar face to the visi-
tor  from  moist  climates.  Plant  cover  is  absent  from  many 
places, exposing soils and other geological features. Where 
there is plant cover, it is sparse. The plants themselves look 
unfamiliar. Desert vegetation often cloaks the landscape in 
a  gray-green  mantle.  This  is  because  many  desert  plants 
protect their photosynthetic surfaces from intense sunlight 
and reduce evaporative water losses with a dense covering

of  plant  hairs.  Other  plant  adaptations  to  drought  include 
small leaves, producing leaves only in response to rainfall 
and then dropping them during intervening dry periods, or 
having no leaves at all ( fig. 2.20 ). Some desert plants avoid 
drought almost entirely by remaining dormant in the soil as 
seeds  that  germinate  and  grow  only  during  infrequent  wet 
periods. 

 In deserts, animal abundance tends to be low but diversity 
can be high. Most desert animals use behavior to avoid envi-
ronmental extremes. In summer, many avoid the heat of the 
day by being active at dusk and dawn or at night. In winter, 
the same species may be active during the day. Animals (as 
well as plants) use body orientation to minimize heat gain in 
the summer.  

  Human Influences 
 Desert  peoples  have  flourished  where  nature  is  stingiest. 
Compared to true desert species, however, humans are profli-
gate water users. Consequently, human populations in deserts 
concentrate at oases and in river valleys. Many desert land-
scapes  that  once  supported  irrigated  agriculture  now  grow 
little as a result of salt accumulation in their soils. 

 The desert is the one biome that, because of human activ-
ity, is increasing in area. Humanity’s challenge is to stop the 
spread of deserts that comes at the expense of other biomes 

and to establish a balanced use of deserts that safeguards their 
inhabitants, human and nonhuman alike.   

  Mediterranean Woodland and Shrubland 
 The     Mediterranean woodland and shrubland    climate was 
the  climate  of  the  classical  Greeks  and  the  coastal  Native 
American  tribes  of  Old  California.  The  mild  temperate  cli-
mate experienced by these cultures was accompanied by high 
biological richness ( fig. 2.21 ). The richness of the Mediterra-
nean woodland flora is captured by a folk song from the Med-
iterranean region that begins: “Spring has already arrived. All 
the countryside will bloom; a feast of color!” To this visual 
feast, Mediterranean woodlands and shrublands add a chorus 
of bird song and the smells of aromatic plants, including rose-
mary, thyme, and laurel. 

 Geography 
 Mediterranean  woodlands  and  shrublands  occur  on  all  the 
continents  except  Antarctica  ( fig.  2.22 ).  They  are  most 
extensive  around  the  Mediterranean  Sea  and  in  North 
 America,  where  they  extend  from  California  into  north-
ern  Mexico.  They  are  also  found  in  central  Chile,  south-
ern Australia,  and  southern Africa.  Under  present  climatic 
conditions  Mediterranean  woodlands  and  shrublands  grow

Mediterranean  woodland  and  shrubland  is  reflected  in  the 
diversity of names for this biome. In western North Amer-
ica, it is called  chaparral.  In Spain, the most common name 
for Mediterranean woodland and shrubland is  matoral.  Far-
ther east in the Mediterranean basin the biome is referred to 
as  garrigue.  Meanwhile in the Southern Hemisphere, South 
Africans  call  the  biome   fynbos,   while Australians  refer  to 
at least one form of it as  mallee.  While the names for this 
biome vary widely, its climate does not. 

  Climate 
 The  Mediterranean  woodland  and  shrubland  climate  is  cool 
and  moist  during  fall,  winter,  and  spring,  whereas  summers 
are hot and dry. The danger of frost varies considerably from 
one Mediterranean woodland and shrubland region to another. 
When they do occur, however, frosts are usually not severe. 
The combination of dry summers and dense vegetation, rich 
in  essential  oils,  creates  ideal  conditions  for  frequent  and 
intense fires.  

  Soils 
 The  soils  of  Mediterranean  woodlands  and  shrublands  are 
generally of low to moderate fertility and are considered frag-
ile.  Some  soils,  such  as  those  of  the  South African  fynbos, 
have  exceptionally  low  fertility.  Soil  erosion  can  be  severe. 
Fire  coupled  with  overgrazing  has  stripped  the  soil  from 
some Mediterranean landscapes. Elsewhere, these landscapes, 
under careful stewardship, have maintained their integrity for 
thousands of years.  

 Biology 
 The  plants  and  animals  of  Mediterranean  woodlands  and 
shrublands are highly diverse and, like their desert neighbors, 
show  several  adaptations  to  drought.  Trees  and  shrubs  are 
typically evergreen and have small, tough leaves, which con-
serve both water and nutrients. Many plants of Mediterranean 
woodlands  and  shrublands  have  well-developed,  mutualistic 
relationships with microbes that fix atmospheric nitrogen.

 The process of decomposition is greatly slowed during 
the dry summer and then started again with the coming of 
fall  and  winter  rains.  Curiously,  this  intermittent  decom-
position may speed the process sufficiently so that average 
rates of decomposition are comparable to those in temperate 
forests. 

 Fire, a common occurrence in Mediterranean woodlands 
and shrublands, has selected for fire-resistant plants. Many 
Mediterranean woodland trees have thick, fire-resistant bark 
( fig. 2.23 ). In contrast, many shrubs in Mediterranean wood-
lands are rich in oils and burn readily but resprout rapidly. 
Most herbaceous plants grow during the cool, moist season 
and  then  die  back  in  summer,  thus  avoiding  both  drought 
and fire. 

  Human Influences 
 Human activity has had a substantial influence on the struc-
ture  of  landscapes  in  Mediterranean  woodlands  and  shrub-
lands.  For  example,  the  open  oak  woodlands  of  southern 
Spain  and  Portugal  are  the  product  of  an  agricultural  man-
agement  system  that  is  thousands  of  years  old.  In  this  sys-
tem, cattle graze on grasses, pigs consume acorns produced 
by the oaks, and cork is harvested from cork oaks as a cash 
crop.  Selected  areas  are  planted  in  wheat  once  every  5  to 
6 years and allowed to lie fallow the remainder of the time. 
This system of agriculture, which emphasizes low-intensity

cultivation and long-term sustainability, may offer clues for 
sustainable agriculture in other regions. 

 High  population  densities  coupled  with  a  long  history 
of  human  occupation  have  left  an  indelible  mark  on  Medi-
terranean  woodlands  and  shrublands.  Early  human  impacts 
included clearing forests for agriculture, setting fires to con-
trol woody species and encourage grass, harvesting brush for 
fuel, and grazing and browsing by domestic livestock. Today, 
Mediterranean  woodlands  and  shrublands  around  the  world 
are being covered by human habitations.   

 Temperate Grassland 
 In their original state,     temperate grasslands    extended unbroken 
over vast areas ( fig. 2.24 ). Standing in the middle of unobstructed 
prairie under a dome of blue sky evokes a feeling similar to that 
of being on a small boat in the open ocean. It is no accident that 
early visitors from forested Europe and eastern North America 
often referred to the prairie in the American Midwest as a “sea 
of grass” and to the wagons that crossed them as “prairie schoo-
ners.” Prairies were the home of the bison and pronghorn and of 
the nomadic cultures of Eurasia and North America. 

 Geography 
 Temperate  grassland  is  the  largest  biome  in  North America, 
extending from 30° to 55° latitude. These grasslands are even 
more  extensive  in  Eurasia  ( fig.  2.25 ).  In  North America,  the 
prairies of the Great Plains extend from southern Canada to the 
Gulf of Mexico and from the Rocky Mountains to the decidu-
ous forests of the east. Additional grasslands are found on the 
Palouse  prairies  of  Idaho  and Washington  and  in  the  central 
valley and surrounding foothills of California. In Eurasia, the 
temperate  grassland  biome  forms  a  virtually  unbroken  band 

from eastern Europe all the way to eastern China. In the South-
ern  Hemisphere,  temperate  grassland  occurs  in  Argentina, 
Uruguay, southern Brazil, and New Zealand. 

  Climate 
 Temperate grasslands receive between 300 and 1,000 mm of 
precipitation annually. Though wetter than deserts, temperate 
grasslands do experience drought, and droughts may persist 
for several years. The maximum precipitation usually occurs 
in  summer  during  the  height  of  the  growing  season  (see 
 fig. 2.25 ).  Winters in temperate grasslands are generally cold 
and summers are hot.  

  Soils 
 Temperate grassland soils are derived from a wide variety of 
parent materials. The best temperate grassland soils are deep, 
basic  or  neutral,  and  fertile  and  contain  large  quantities  of 
organic matter. The black prairie soils of North America and 
Eurasia, famous for their fertility, contain the greatest amount 
of organic matter. The brown soils of the more arid grasslands 
contain less organic matter.  

  Biology 
 Temperate  grassland  is  thoroughly  dominated  by  herbaceous 
vegetation. Drought and high summer temperatures encourage 
fire. As  in  tropical  savannas,  fire  helps  exclude  woody  vege-
tation from temperate grasslands, where trees and shrubs are 
often limited to the margins of streams and rivers. In addition 
to grasses, there can be a striking diversity of other herbaceous 
vegetation.  Spring  graces  temperate  grasslands  with  showy 
anemones,  ranunculus,  iris,  and  other  wild  flowers;  up  to 
70 species can bloom simultaneously on the species-rich North 
American  prairie.  The  height  of  grassland  vegetation  varies

from about 5 cm in dry, short-grass prairies to over 200 cm in 
the wetter, tall-grass prairies. The root systems of grasses and 
forbs form a dense network of sod that resists invasion by both 
trees and the plow. 

 Temperate  grasslands  once  supported  huge  herds  of 
roving  herbivores:  bison  and  pronghorns  in  North America 
(see  fig. 2.24 ) and wild horses and Saiga antelope in  Eurasia. 
As  in  the  open  sea,  the  herbivores  of  the  open  grassland 
banded together in social groups, as did their attendant preda-
tors, the steppe and prairie wolves. The smaller, inconspicu-
ous animals, such as grasshoppers and mice, were even more 
numerous than the large herbivores.  

 Human Influences 
 The  first  human  populations  on  temperate  grasslands  were 
nomadic  hunters.  Next  came  the  nomadic  herders.  Later,  with 
their  plows,  came  the  farmers,  who  broke  the  sod  and  tapped 
into fertile soils built up over thousands of years. Under the plow, 
temperate  grasslands  have  produced  some  of  the  most  fertile 
farmlands on earth and fed much of the world ( fig. 2.26 ). How-
ever, much of this productivity depends on substantial additions 
of inorganic fertilizers, and we are “mining” the fertility of prairie 
soils. For example, prairie soils have lost as much as 35% to 40% 
of their organic matter in just 35 to 40 years of cultivation. In 
addition, the more arid grasslands, with their frequent droughts, 
do not appear capable of supporting sustainable  farming.  

  Figure 2.26    Once the most extensive biome on earth, temperate 
grasslands have been largely converted to agriculture.  

  Temperate Forest 
 The  largest  living  organisms  on  earth,  perhaps  the  largest 
that have ever lived, the sequoias of western North America 
and the giant  Eucalyptus  trees of southern Australia, live in 
    temperate  forest    .  The  temperate  deciduous  forests  of  east-
ern North America, Europe, and Asia still harbor ancient trees 
that are no less impressive, particularly in autumn ( fig. 2.27 ).

 Geography 
 Temperate forest can be found between 30 8  and 55 8  latitude. 
However, the majority of this biome lies between 40 8  and 50 8  
( fig. 2.28 ). In Asia, temperate forest originally covered much 
of Japan, eastern China, Korea, and eastern Siberia. In western 
Europe, temperate forests extended from southern Scandina-
via to northwestern Iberia and from the British Isles through 
eastern Europe. North American temperate forests are found 
from the Atlantic sea coast to the Great Plains and reappear 
on the West Coast as temperate coniferous forests that extend 
from northern California through southeastern Alaska. In the 
Southern Hemisphere, temperate forests are found in southern 
Chile, New Zealand, and southern Australia. 

  Climate 
 Temperate forests, which may be either coniferous or decidu-
ous,  occur  where  temperatures  are  not  extreme  and  where 
annual precipitation averages anywhere from about 650 mm to 
over 3,000 mm (see  fig. 2.28 ). These forests generally receive 
more winter precipitation than temperate grasslands. Decidu-
ous trees usually dominate temperate forests, where the grow-
ing season is moist and at least 4 months long. In deciduous 
forests, winters last from 3 to 4 months. Though snowfall may 
be  heavy,  winters  in  deciduous  forests  are  relatively  mild. 
Where winters are more severe or the summers drier, conifers

are more abundant than deciduous trees. The temperate conif-
erous  forests  of  the  Pacific  Coast  of  North America  receive 
most of their precipitation during fall, winter, and spring and 
are  subject  to  summer  drought.  Summer  drought  is  shown 
clearly  in  the  climate  diagram  for  the  H.  J. Andrews  Forest 
of  Oregon  (see   fig.  2.28 ).  The  few  deciduous  trees  in  these 
coniferous  forests  are  largely  restricted  to  streamside  envi-
ronments, where water remains abundant during the drought-
prone growing season.  

  Soils 
 Temperate forest soils are usually fertile. The most fertile soils 
in this biome develop under deciduous forests, where they are 
generally  neutral  or  slightly  acidic  and  rich  in  both  organic 
matter and inorganic nutrients. Rich soils may develop under 
coniferous forests but conifers are also able to grow on poorer, 
acidic soils. Nutrient movement between soil and vegetation 
tends to be slower and more conservative in coniferous for-
ests; nutrient movement within deciduous forests is generally 
more dynamic.  

 Biology 
 While  the  diversity  of  trees  found  in  temperate  forests  is 
lower than that of tropical forests, temperate forest biomass 
can  be  as  great,  or  greater.  Like  tropical  rain  forests,  tem-
perate  forests  are  vertically  stratified.  The  lowest  layer  of 
vegetation,  the  herb  layer,  is  followed  by  a  layer  of  shrubs, 
then shade-tolerant understory trees, and finally the canopy, 

formed by the largest trees. The height of this canopy varies 
from  approximately  40  m  to  over  100  m.  Birds,  mammals, 
and insects make use of all layers of the forest from beneath 
the forest floor through the canopy. Some of the most impor-
tant consumers are the fungi and bacteria, which, along with 
a diversity of microscopic invertebrate animals, consume the 
large  quantities  of  wood  stored  on  the  floor  of  old-growth 
temperate  forest  ( fig.  2.29 ).  The  activities  of  these  organ-
isms recycle nutrients, a process upon which the health of the 
entire forest depends. 

  Human Influences 
 What, besides being large cities, do Tokyo, Beijing, Moscow, 
Warsaw, Berlin, Paris, London, New York, Washington, D.C., 
Boston,  Toronto,  Chicago,  and  Seattle  have  in  common? 
They are all built on lands that once supported a temperate 
forest. The first human settlements in temperate forests were 
concentrated along forest margins, usually along streams and 
rivers.  Eventually,  agriculture  was  practiced  in  these  forest 
clearings,  and  animals  and  plant  products  were  harvested 
from the surrounding forest. This was the circumstance sev-
eral thousand years ago, in Europe and Asia, and five centu-
ries  ago,  in  North America.  Since  those  times,  most  of  the 
ancient  forests  have  fallen  to  ax  and  saw.  Few  tracts  of  the 
virgin deciduous forest that once covered most of the eastern 
half of North America remain, and disparate interests struggle 
over the fate of the remaining 1% to 2% of old-growth forests 
in western North America.   

  Figure 2.29    Key decomposers in temperate forests. The massive wood deposited on the floor of temperate forests is broken down by fungi, which 
are essential to the addition of organic matter to forest soils and to the cycling of nutrients in forest ecosystems.

  Natural History and Evolution

  Figure 2.30    Boreal forests, such as this one in Alaska, are 
 dominated by a few species of conifer trees.  

 Boreal Forest 
 The     boreal forest    ,  or     taiga    ,  is a world of wood and water that 
covers  over  11%  of  the  earth’s  land  area  ( fig.  2.30 ).  On  the 
surface,  the  boreal  forest  is  the  essence  of  monotony.  How-
ever, if you pay attention you are rewarded with plenty of vari-
ety. In places, the trees stand so close together you can barely 
walk through them. Elsewhere, so many trees have been top-
pled by wind that you can walk on their piled trunks, 1 to 2 m 
above the ground, for many kilometers. In still other places, 
the forest is open and you can wander wherever you like on 
its soft floor of needles and duff. Here and there, where light 
penetrates, are berry bushes of many varieties. A trek through 
a boreal forest eventually leads to the shore of a lake or river, 
where shade and cover give way to light and space. Along the 
lake margins grow willows and other water- and light-loving 
plants. The summer forest is colored green, gray, and brown; 
the autumn adds brilliant splashes of yellow and red; and the 
long  northern  winter  turns  the  boreal  forest  into  a  land  of 
white solitude. 

 Geography 
  Boreal  comes from the Greek word for north, reflecting the fact 
that boreal forests are confined to the Northern Hemisphere. 
Boreal  forests  extend  from  Scandinavia,  through  European 
Russia,  across  Siberia,  to  central Alaska,  and  across  central 
Canada in a band between 50 8  and 65 8  N latitude ( fig. 2.31 ). 
These forests are bounded in the south either by temperate for-
ests or temperate grasslands and in the north by tundra. Fin-
gers of boreal forest follow the Rocky Mountains south along 
the spine of North America, and patches of boreal forest reap-
pear on the mountain slopes of south-central Europe and Asia. 

  Climate 
 Boreal  forest  is  found  where  winters  are  too  long,  usu-
ally  longer  than  6  months,  and  the  summers  too  short  to 

support  temperate  forest  (see   fig.  2.31 ). The  boreal  forest 
zone includes some fairly moderate climates, such as that 
at  Umeå,  Sweden,  where  the  climate  is  moderated  by  the 
nearby Baltic Sea. However, boreal forests are also found in 
some of the most variable climates on earth. For instance, 
the temperature at Verkhoyansk, Russia, in central Siberia, 
ranges  from  about   2 70   8 C  in  winter  to  over  30 8 C  in  sum-
mer, an annual temperature range of over 100 8 C! Precipita-
tion  in  the  boreal  forest  is  moderate,  ranging  from  about 
200 to 600 mm. Yet, because of low temperatures and long 
winters,  evaporation  rates  are  low,  and  drought  is  infre-
quent. During droughts, however, forest fires can devastate 
vast areas of boreal forest.  

  Soils 
 Boreal forest soils tend to be of low fertility, thin, and acidic. 
Low temperatures and low pH impede decomposition of plant 
litter  and  slow  the  rate  of  soil  building. As  a  consequence, 
nutrients are largely tied up in a thick layer of plant litter that 
carpets  the  forest  floor.  In  turn,  most  trees  in  boreal  forests 
have a dense network of shallow roots that, along with associ-
ated mycorrhizal fungi, tap directly into the nutrients bound 
up in this litter layer. The topsoil, which underlies the litter 
layer, is thin. In the more extreme boreal forest climates, the 
subsoil is permanently frozen in a layer of “permafrost” that 
may be several meters thick.  

  Biology 
 Boreal  forest  is  generally  dominated  by  evergreen  coni-
fers such as spruce, fir, and, in some places, pines. Larch, a 
deciduous  conifer,  dominates  in  the  most  extreme  Siberian 
 climates.  Deciduous  aspen  and  birch  trees  grow  here  and 
there in mature conifer forests and may dominate the boreal 
forest  during  the  early  stages  of  recovery  following  forest 
fires.  Willows  grow  along  the  shores  of  rivers  and  lakes. 
There  is  little  herbaceous  vegetation  under  the  thick  for-
est canopy, but small shrubs such as blueberry and shrubby 
 junipers are common. 

 Boreal forest is home to many animals, including migra-
tory caribou and reindeer in winter and moose and woodland 
bison year-round. The wolf is the major predator of the boreal 
forest. This biome is also inhabited by black bears and grizzly 
bears in North America and the brown bear in Eurasia. A vari-
ety of smaller mammals such as lynx, wolverine, snowshoe 
hare, porcupines, and red squirrels also live in boreal forests. 
Boreal forest is the nesting habitat for many birds, such as the 
American redstart (see fig. 1.4), that migrate from the tropics 
each spring and the year-round home of other birds such as 
crossbills and spruce grouse. 

 Our  survey  of  the  biosphere  has  taken  us  far  from  the 
rain forest, where we started. Let’s reflect back on the tropical 
rain forest and where we’ve come. What has changed? Well, 
we’re still in forest but a very different one. In the rain forest, 
a single hectare could contain over 300 species of trees; here, 
in the boreal forest, you can count the dominant trees on one 
hand. What  about  epiphytes  and  vines? The  vines  are  gone

and the epiphytes are limited to lichens and some mistletoe. In 
addition, most of the intricate relationships between species 
that we saw in the rain forest are absent. All the trees are wind 
pollinated,  and  none  produce  fleshy  fruits  like  bananas  or 
papayas. Now listen to the two forests at night. Tropical rain 
forest  echoes  with  a  rich  chorus  of  sounds.  In  contrast,  the 
silence of the boreal forest is broken by few animal voices—
the howl of a wolf, the hoot of an owl, the cry of the loon, 
soloists  of  the  northern  forest—accompanied  by  incessant 
wind through the trees.  

 Human Influences 
 Ancient cave paintings in southern France and northern Spain, 
made  during  the  last  ice  age  when  the  climate  was  much 
colder, reveal that humans have lived off boreal forest animals, 
such as the migratory reindeer, for tens of thousands of years. 
In Eurasia, from Lapland in Scandinavia to Siberia, hunting of 
reindeer  eventually  gave  way  to  domestication  and  herding. 
In  northern  Canada  and Alaska,  where  some  Native Ameri-
cans still rely on wild caribou for much of their food, we find 
a reminder of the earliest human ways of making a living in 
these  northern  lands.  Northern  peoples  have  also  long  har-
vested the berries that grow in abundance in the boreal forest. 
 For  most  of  history,  human  intrusion  in  the  boreal  for-
est was relatively light. More recently, however, harvesting of 

both  animals  and  plants  has  become  intense.  Boreal  forests 
are being rapidly cut for lumber and pulp ( fig. 2.32 ). 

  Tundra 
 Follow  the  caribou  north  as  they  leave  their  winter  home 
in the boreal forest and you eventually reach an open land-
scape  of  mosses,  lichens,  and  dwarf  willows,  dotted  with 
small ponds and laced with clear streams ( fig. 2.33 ). This is 
the     tundra    .  If it is summer and surface soils have thawed, 
your progress will be cushioned by a spongy mat of lichens 
and mosses and punctuated by sinking into soggy accumu-
lations of peat. The air will be filled with the cries of nesting 
birds  that  have  come  north  to  take  advantage  of  the  brief 
summer abundance of their plant and animal prey. After the 
long winter, the midnight sun signals a celebration of light 
and life. 

 Geography 
 Like the boreal forest, the arctic tundra rings the top of the 
globe, covering most of the lands north of the Arctic Circle at 
approximately 66.5° N latitude ( fig. 2.34 ). The tundra extends 
from  northernmost  Scandinavia,  across  northern  European 
Russia,  through  northern  Siberia,  and  right  across  northern 
Alaska and Canada. It reaches far south of the Arctic Circle in 

36

the Hudson Bay region of Canada and is also found in patches 
on the coast of Greenland and in northern Iceland. 

  Climate 
 The tundra climate is typically cold and dry. However, tem-
peratures  are  not  quite  as  extreme  as  in  the  boreal  forest. 
Though  winter  temperatures  are  less  severe,  the  summers 
are shorter (see  fig. 2.34 ). Precipitation on the tundra varies 
from less than 200 mm to a little over 600 mm. Still, because 
average annual temperatures are so low, precipitation exceeds 
evaporation. As a consequence, the short summers are soggy 
and the tundra landscape is alive with ponds and streams.  

 Soils 
 Soil  building  is  slow  in  the  cold  tundra  climate.  Because 
rates  of  decomposition  are  low,  organic  matter  accumulates 
in deposits of peat and humus. Surface soils thaw each sum-
mer but are generally underlain by a layer of permafrost that 
may be many meters thick. The annual freezing and thawing 
of surface soil combines with the actions of water and gravity 
to produce a variety of surface processes that are largely lim-
ited to the tundra. One of these processes,     solifluction    ,  slowly 
moves  soils  down  slopes.  In  addition,  freezing  and  thawing 
bring stones to the surface of the soil, forming a netlike, or 
polygonal, pattern on the surface of tundra soils ( fig. 2.35 ).

and  algae,  are  eagerly  eaten  by  reindeer  and  caribou.  The 
woody vegetation of the tundra consists of dwarf willows and 
birches along with a variety of low-growing shrubs. 

 The tundra is one of the last biomes on earth that still sup-
port substantial numbers of large native mammals, including 
caribou, reindeer, musk ox, bear, and wolves. Small mammals 
such as arctic foxes, weasels, lemmings, and ground squirrels 
are also abundant. Resident birds such as the ptarmigan and 
snowy  owl  are  joined  each  summer  by  a  host  of  migratory 
bird species. Insects, though not as diverse as in biomes far-
ther south, are very abundant. Each summer, swarms of mos-
quitoes and black flies emerge from the many tundra ponds 
and streams.  

  Human Influences 
 Until  recently,  human  presence  in  the  tundra  was  largely 
limited to small populations of hunters and nomadic herd-
ers. As a consequence, the tundra has been viewed as one 
of  the  last  pristine  areas  of  the  planet.  Recently,  however, 
human  intrusion  has  increased  markedly.  This  biome  has 
been  the  focus  of  intense  oil  exploration  and  extraction. 
 Airborne  pesticides  and  radionuclides,  which  originate  in 
distant  human  population  centers,  have  been  deposited  on 
the  tundra,  sometimes  with  devastating  results.  For  exam-
ple,  radioactive  cesium-137  from  the  Chernobyl  power 
plant disaster of 1986 was deposited with rainfall, more than 

  Figure 2.35    Freezing and thawing form netlike polygons on the 
surface of the tundra as seen here in an aerial photo of Alaska.  

  Biology 
 The open tundra landscape is dominated by a richly textured 
patchwork of perennial herbaceous plants, especially grasses, 
sedges, mosses, and lichens. The lichens, associations of fungi

2,000  km  away,  on  the  tundra  of  Norway.  In  some  areas, 
cesium-137 became so concentrated as it passed through the 
food chain from lichens to reindeer that both the milk and 
meat of reindeer were rendered unfit for human consump-
tion. Such incidents have shattered the illusion of the tundra 
as an isolated biome and the last earthly refuge from human 
disturbance.   

  Mountains: Islands in the Sky 
 We  now  shift  our  attention  to  mountains,  which  are  not  a 
biome. Because of the environmental changes that occur with 
altitude, however, several biomes may be found on a single 
mountainside. This environmental and biological diversity is 
something common to mountains. We include mountains here 
because  they  often  introduce  unique  environmental  condi-
tions and organisms to regions around the globe. 

 Mountains  capture  the  imagination  as  places  of  geo-
logical, biological, and climatic diversity ( fig. 2.36 ). You can 
stand with eagles and gaze on the plains below, an experience 
that  before  air  travel  was  unique  to  mountains.  Mountains 
have  long  offered  refuge  for  distinctive  flora  and  fauna  and 
humans alike. Like oceanic islands, they offer unique insights 
into evolutionary and ecological processes. 

 Geography 
 Mountains  are  built  by  geological  processes,  such  as  vol-
canism  and  movements  of  the  earth’s  crust  that  elevate  and 
fold the earth’s surface. These processes operate with greater 
 intensity in some places than others, and so mountains are con-
centrated in belts where these geological forces have been at 
work ( fig. 2.37 ). In the Western Hemisphere, these forces have 
been particularly active on the western sides of both North and 
South  America,  where  a  chain  of  mountain  ranges  extends 
from northern Alaska across western North America to Tierra 
del Fuego at the tip of South America. Ancient low mountain 
ranges occupy the eastern sides of both continents. In Africa, 
the major  mountain ranges are the Atlas Mountains of north-
west  Africa  and  the  mountains  of  East  Africa  that  run  like 
beads on a string from the highlands of Ethiopia to southern 
Africa.  In Australia,  the  flattest  of  the  continents,  mountains 
extend down the eastern side of the continent. Eurasian moun-
tain ranges, which generally extend east to west, include the 
Pyrenees, the Alps, the Caucasus, and, of course, the Himala-
yas, the highest of them all. 

 Climate 
 On mountains, climates change from low to high altitude, but 
the  specific  changes  are  different  at  different  latitudes.  On 

  Figure 2.36    Mount Kilimanjaro, East Africa, where environmental conditions vary from tropical savanna at the base of the mountain to ice fields 
at its peak.

mountains at middle latitudes, the climate is generally cooler 
and wetter at higher altitudes ( fig. 2.38 ). In contrast, there is 
less precipitation at the higher elevations of polar mountains 
and  on  some  tropical  mountains.  In  other  tropical  regions, 
precipitation increases up to some middle elevation and then 
decreases  higher  up  the  mountain.  On  high  tropical  moun-
tains, warm days are followed by freezing nights. The organ-
isms  on  these  mountains  experience  summer  temperatures 
every day and winter temperatures every night. The changes 
in climate that occur up the sides of mountains have profound 
influences on the distribution of mountain organisms. 

  Soils 
 Mountain soils change with elevation and have a great deal 
in common with the various soils we’ve already discussed. 
However,  some  special  features  are  worth  noting.  First, 
because of the steeper topography, mountain soils are gener-
ally well drained and tend to be thin and vulnerable to ero-
sion.  Second,  persistent  winds  blowing  from  the  lowlands 
deposit soil particles and organic matter on mountains, mate-
rials  that  can  make  a  significant  contribution  to  local  soil 
building.  In  some  locations  in  the  southern  Rocky  Moun-
tains, coniferous trees draw the bulk of their nutrition from 
materials carried by winds from the valleys below, not from 
local bedrock.  

 Biology 
 Climb any mountain that is high enough and you will notice 
biological and climatic changes. Whatever the vegetation at 
the base of a mountain, that vegetation will change as you 
climb  and  the  air  becomes  cooler.  The  sequence  of  veg-
etation  up  the  side  of  a  mountain  may  remind  you  of  the 
biomes we encountered on our journey from the equator to 
the poles. In the cool highlands of desert mountains in the 

southwestern  United  States,  you  can  hike  through  spruce 
and  fir  forests  much  like  those  we  encountered  far  to  the 
north.  However,  what  you  see  on  these  desert  mountains 
differs  substantially  from  boreal  forests.  These  mountain 
populations have been isolated from the main body of the 
boreal  forest  for  over  10,000  years;  in  the  interim,  some 
populations have become extinct, some teeter on the verge 
of extinction, while others have evolved sufficiently to be 
recognized  as  separate  species  or  subspecies.  On  these 
mountains, time and isolation have forged distinctive gene 
pools and mixes of species. 

 The  species  on  high  equatorial  mountains  are  even 
more isolated. Think for a moment of the geography of high 
tropical  mountains:  some  in Africa,  some  in  the  highlands 
of Asia, and the Andes of South America. The high-altitude 
communities of Africa, South America, and Asia share very 
few species. On the other hand, despite differences in spe-
cies composition, there are structural similarities among the 
organisms on these mountains ( fig. 2.39 ). These similarities 
suggest there may be general rules for associating organisms 
with environments. 

  Human Influences 
 Because  mountains  differ  in  climate,  geology,  and  biota 
(plants  and  animals)  from  the  surrounding  lowlands,  they 
have been useful as a source of raw materials such as wood, 
forage for animals, medicinal plants, and minerals. Some of 
these uses, such as livestock grazing, are highly seasonal. In 
temperate  regions,  livestock  are  taken  to  mountain  pastures 
during the summer and back down to the lowlands in winter. 
Human  exploitation  of  mountains  has  produced  ecological 
degradation  in  many  places  and  surprising  balance  in  oth-
ers.  Increased  human  pressure  on  mountain  environments 
has sometimes created conflict between competing economic

 LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 2.17  Define drought. 
 2.18  Describe the Palmer Drought Severity Index.
 2.19 

Interpret temporal and spatial representations of the 
Palmer Drought Severity Index.

In this chapter we’ve used climate diagrams to represent the 
climates  of  earth’s  biomes.  Climate  diagrams  capture  some 
of the climatically significant differences among the climates 
experienced by the various biomes. However, since they focus 
on  average  climatic  conditions,  they  emphasize  only  one 
aspect of climate. Recall that climate diagrams plot average 
(mean) monthly precipitation, which is plotted as a line graph 
(see   fig.  2.6 ),  and  average  monthly  temperature,  also  plot-
ted as a line graph but connecting red dots. Including mean 
annual  temperature  and  mean  annual  precipitation  in  each 
climate diagram further reinforces the focus on average con-
ditions. However, as we all know, climates everywhere vary 
substantially from the average conditions presented in climate 
diagrams. 

 Here we explore a climatic index, the     Palmer Drought 
Severity  Index    ,   which  can  be  used  to  characterize  climatic 
variation. While this index has been historically used to assess 
drought  conditions,  it  indicates  wet  periods  as  well.  First, 
what is a drought? A     drought    can be defined as an extended 
period of dry weather during which precipitation is reduced 
sufficiently to damage crops, impair the functioning of natural 
ecosystems, or cause water shortages for human populations. 
While  such  a  definition  may  be  sufficient  for  some  needs, 
climatologists  have  tried  to  create  quantitative  indices  of 
drought. The Palmer Drought Severity Index, or PDSI, is such 
an index. The PDSI uses temperature and precipitation to cal-
culate moisture conditions relative to long-term averages for a 
particular region. Negative values of the PDSI reflect drought 
conditions,  while  positive  values  indicate  relatively  moist 
periods. What do zero values of the Palmer Drought Severity 
Index indicate? Values near zero indicate approximately aver-
age conditions in a particular region. 

  Figure 2.40  shows a plot of the Palmer Drought Sever-
ity  Index  for  the  region  around  Manhattan,  Kansas,  from 
1895 through 2004. To ease interpretation, negative values of 
the  Palmer  Drought  Severity  Index  are  shaded  red,  indicat-
ing drought. Periods during which the index was positive are 
shaded blue, indicating moist conditions. The area of Kansas 
from  which  the  climate  data  are  plotted  in   figure  2.40   falls 
within the temperate grassland biome. What does  figure 2.40  
suggest  about  moisture  availability  in  the  region  around 
Manhattan,  Kansas?  One  of  the  most  apparent  characteris-
tics of this plot is its great variability. Clearly, the availabil-
ity of water in the region is far from constant. Now compare 
  figure  2.40   with  the  representation  of  climate  for  Manhat-
tan,  Kansas,  shown  in   figure  2.25 .  How  do  the  two  figures 
compare?  While  the  climate  diagram  and  the  PDSI  repre-
sent climate from the same geographic location, the climate 
diagram,  because  it  draws  our  attention  to  average  climatic 
conditions, suggests climatic stability. Meanwhile, the PDSI 
shows that the climate around Manhattan, Kansas, is in fact 
highly variable. 

 Temporal  climatic  variability  is  matched  or  exceeded 
by  climatic  variation  in  space.  Spatial  variation  in  climatic

conditions can also be represented using the Palmer Drought 
Severity Index. For instance,  figure 2.41  maps values of the 
Palmer  Drought  Severity  Index  across  the  United  States  for 
the  week  ending  January  4,  2003.  Notice  that  during  this 
period, moisture conditions varied widely across this portion 
of the North American continent. While some parts of the des-
ert Southwest and northern Rocky Mountain regions experi-
enced severe to extreme drought conditions, other regions of 
the United States were very moist or extremely moist. In still 
other regions, the conditions were near normal. 

 The levels of regional and temporal variability shown on 
 figures 2.40  and  2.41  are not exceptional. Similar levels of spa-
tial variation occur on all continents. However, when consider-
ing temporal variation in climate, some regions are climatically 
more  variable  than  others.  For  example,  those  regions  under 
the influence of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (chapter 23, 
p. 508) are particularly variable. Ecologists study the relation-
ships between organisms and environment. As these examples 
show, in the study of those relationships both averages and vari-
ation in environmental factors need to be considered.     

   Summary 

 Natural history is helping with the difficult task of restoring 
tropical dry forest in Costa Rica. Natural history also formed 
the  foundation  upon  which  modern  ecology  developed. 
Because ecological studies continue to be built upon a solid 
foundation  of  natural  history,  this  chapter  is  devoted  to  the 
natural history of terrestrial biomes. Biomes are distinguished 
primarily by their predominant vegetation and are associated 
with particular climates. 

  Uneven  heating  of  the  earth’s  spherical  surface  by 
the  sun  and  the  tilt  of  the  earth  on  its  axis  combine  to 
produce predictable latitudinal and seasonal variation in 
climate.   Because  the  earth  is  a  sphere,  the  sun’s  rays  are 
most  concentrated  at  the  latitude  where  the  sun  is  directly 
overhead. This latitude changes with the seasons because the 
earth’s  axis  of  rotation  is  not  perpendicular  to  its  plane  of 
orbit  about  the  sun  but  is  tilted  approximately  23.5 8   away 

 

Chapter 2

from the perpendicular. The sun is directly overhead at the 
tropic of Cancer, at 23.5 8  N latitude during the northern sum-
mer solstice. During the northern winter solstice the sun is 
directly overhead at the tropic of Capricorn, at 23.5 8  S lati-
tude. The sun is directly overhead at the equator during the 
spring and autumnal equinoxes. During the northern summer 
the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun and receives 
more  solar  energy  than  the  Southern  Hemisphere.  During 
the northern winter, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away 
from  the  sun  and  the  Southern  Hemisphere  receives  more 
solar energy. 

 Heating  of  the  earth’s  surface  and  atmosphere  drives 
atmospheric circulation and influences global patterns of pre-
cipitation. As the sun heats air at the equator, it expands and 
rises,  spreading  northward  and  southward  at  high  altitudes. 
This  high-altitude  air  cools  as  it  spreads  toward  the  poles, 
eventually sinking back to the earth’s surface. Rotation of the 
earth  on  its  axis  breaks  up  atmospheric  circulation  into  six 
major  cells,  three  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  and  three  in 
the  Southern  Hemisphere. These  six  circulation  cells  corre-
spond to the trade winds north and south of the equator, the 
westerlies between 30 8  and 60 8  N or S latitude, and the polar 
easterlies  above  60 8   latitude. These  prevailing  winds  do  not 
blow directly south because of the Coriolis effect. 

 As air rises at the tropics, it cools, and the water vapor 
it contains condenses and forms clouds. Precipitation from 
these clouds produces the abundant rains of the tropics. Dry 
air blowing across the lands at about 30 8  latitude produces 
the great deserts that ring the globe. When warm, moist air 
flowing toward the poles meets cold, polar air, it rises and 
cools,  forming  clouds  that  produce  the  precipitation  asso-
ciated  with  temperate  environments.  Complicated  differ-
ences in average climate can be summarized using a climate 
diagram. 

  Soil structure results from the long-term interaction 
of  climate,  organisms,  topography,  and  parent  mineral 
material.   Terrestrial biomes are built upon a foundation of 
soil, a vertically stratified and complex mixture of living and 
nonliving material. Most terrestrial life depends on soil. Soil 
structure varies continuously in time and space. Soils are gen-
erally divided into O, A, B, and C horizons. The O horizon 

is made up of freshly fallen organic matter, including leaves, 
twigs, and other plant parts. The A horizon contains a mix-
ture of mineral materials and organic matter derived from the 
O  horizon. The  B  horizon  contains  clays,  humus,  and  other 
materials that have been transported from the A horizon. The 
C horizon consists of weathered parent material. 

  The geographic distribution of terrestrial biomes cor-
responds closely to variation in climate, especially prevail-
ing temperature and precipitation.   The major terrestrial 
biomes and climatic regimes are:  tropical rain forest:  warm; 
moist; low seasonality; infertile soils; exceptional biological 
diversity  and  intricate  biological  interactions.   Tropical  dry 
forest:  warm and cool seasons; seasonally dry; biologically 
rich; as threatened as tropical rain forest.  Tropical savanna:  
warm  and  cool  seasons;  pronounced  dry  and  wet  seasons; 
impermeable soil layers; fire important to maintaining domi-
nance by grasses; still supports high numbers and diversity 
of large animals.  Desert:  hot or cold; dry; unpredictable pre-
cipitation; low productivity but often high diversity; organ-
isms  well  adapted  to  climatic  extremes.   Mediterranean 
woodland and shrubland:  cool, moist winters; hot, dry sum-
mers;  low  to  moderate  soil  fertility;  organisms  adapted  to 
seasonal  drought  and  periodic  fires.   Temperate  grassland:  
hot and cold seasons; peak rainfall coincides with growing 
season;  droughts  sometimes  lasting  several  years;  fertile 
soils;  fire  important  to  maintaining  dominance  by  grasses; 
historically  inhabited  by  roving  bands  of  herbivores  and 
predators.  Temperate forest:  moderate, moist winters; warm, 
moist  growing  season;  fertile  soils;  high  productivity  and 
biomass; dominated by deciduous trees where growing sea-
sons are moist, winters are mild, and soils fertile; otherwise 
dominated by conifers.  Boreal forest:  long, severe winters; 
climatic  extremes;  moderate  precipitation;  infertile  soils; 
permafrost;  occasional  fire;  extensive  forest  biome,  domi-
nated  by  conifers.   Tundra:   cold;  low  precipitation;  short, 
soggy summers; poorly-developed soils; permafrost; domi-
nated  by  low  vegetation  and  a  variety  of  animals  adapted 
to  long,  cold  winters;  migratory  animals,  especially  birds, 
make  seasonal  use.   Mountains:   temperature,  precipitation, 
soils, and organisms shift with elevation; mountains are cli-
matic and biological islands.

 Life in Water 

  T he names that people around the world have given to 

our  planet  reveal  a  perspective  consistent  across  cul-
tures. Those names, whether in English (earth), Latin 
 ,   di  qiu ),  all 
( terra ),  Greek  (G«o s ,   geos ),  or  Chinese  ( 
refer to land or soil, revealing that cultures everywhere hold a 
land-centered perspective. The Hawaiians, Polynesian inhab-
itants  of  the  most  isolated  specks  of  land  on  earth,  call  the 
planet  ka honua,  an allusion to a level landing place or dirt 
embankment.  This  universal  land-centered  perspective  may 
partly explain why portraits of earth transmitted from space 
are so stunning. Those images challenge our sense of place by 
portraying our planet as a shining blue ball, as a landing place 
in space covered not by land but mostly by water ( fig. 3.1 ). 

 Life  originated  in  water  but  from  our  perspective  as 
terrestrial  organisms,  the  aquatic  realm  remains  an  alien 
environment  governed  by  unfamiliar  rules.  In  the  aquatic 
environment,  life  is  often  most  profuse  where  conditions 
appear most hostile to us: along cold, wave-swept seacoasts, 
in  torrential  mountain  streams  during  the  depths  of  winter, 
in murky waters where rivers meet the sea. The goal of this 
chapter is to make this realm more familiar; we’ll take a look 
at the aquatic environment and its inhabitants and gain a gen-
eral sense of the natural history of life in water that will pre-
pare the way for more detailed studies of ecology.

   3.1  The Hydrologic Cycle 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 3.1  Name the major processes moving water through the 

hydrologic cycle.

 3.2  List the major reservoirs of the hydrologic cycle in 

order of increasing volume.

 3.3  Summarize the sources and fates of water falling as 

precipitation on land each year.

   The hydrologic cycle exchanges water among reservoirs. 
Over  71%  of  the  earth’s  surface  is  covered  by  water.  This 
water  is  unevenly  distributed  among  aquatic  environments; 
most is seawater. The oceans contain over 97% of the water 
in  the  biosphere,  and  the  polar  ice  caps  and  glaciers  con-
tain an additional 2%. Less than 1% is freshwater in rivers, 
lakes, and actively exchanged groundwater. The situation on 
earth is indeed as Samuel Coleridge’s ancient mariner saw it: 
“Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink.” 

 The various aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, and 
oceans plus the atmosphere, ice, can be considered as “reservoirs” 
within  the  hydrologic  cycle,  places  where  water  is  stored  for 
some period of time.  Figure 3.2  summarizes the dynamic move-
ment of water among these reservoirs in a global exchange called 
the  hydrologic cycle.    During the hydrologic cycle, water enters 
each reservoir either as precipitation or as surface or subsurface 
flow and exits either as evaporation or flow. The hydrologic cycle 
is powered by solar energy, which drives the winds and evapo-
rates water, primarily from the surface of the oceans. Water vapor 
cools as it rises from the ocean’s surface and condenses, form-
ing clouds. These clouds are then blown by solar-driven winds 

across the planet, eventually yielding rain or snow, the majority 
of which falls back on the oceans. The water that falls on land 
has several fates. Some immediately evaporates and reenters the 
atmosphere;  some  is  consumed  by  terrestrial  organisms;  some 
percolates  through  the  soil  to  become  groundwater;  and  some 
ends up in lakes and ponds or in streams and rivers, which even-
tually find their way back to the sea. 

 Turnover time is the time required for the entire volume of 
a particular reservoir to be renewed. Because reservoirs differ in 
size, and rates of water exchange, they turn over at vastly different 
rates. The water in the atmosphere turns over about every 9 days. 
The renewal time for river water, 12 to 20 days, is nearly as rapid. 
Lake renewal times are longer, ranging anywhere from days to 
centuries, depending on lake depth, area, and rate of drainage. 
But the biggest surprise is the renewal time for the largest reser-
voir of all, the oceans. With a renewal time of about 3,100 years, 
the  total  volume  of  the  oceans,  over  1.3  billion  km 3   of  water, 
has turned over nearly 50 times in the last 150,000 years or so, 
roughly since the first modern humans gazed out on an ocean.

earth’s water that resides in the oceans?  

     2.   How  does  the  construction  of  dams  for  storing  water 

affect the turnover time for water in rivers?      

  3.2  The Natural History 

of Aquatic Environments 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 3.4  List the major aquatic environments.
 3.5  Describe the major physical characteristics of the 

range of aquatic environments.

 3.6  Outline the chemical differences among the aquatic 

environments.

 3.7  Discuss the differences in dominant organisms of the 

various aquatic environments.

 3.8  Explain why human impacts on the oceans, which 
lagged behind our impact on terrestrial biomes for 
thousands of years, has rapidly increased in recent 
centuries.

   The biology of aquatic environments corresponds broadly to 
variations in physical factors such as light, temperature, and 
water  movements  and  to  chemical  factors  such  as  salinity 
and oxygen.   Our discussion of the natural history of aquatic 
environments begins with the natural history of the oceans, the 
largest  aquatic  environment  on  the  planet.  We  continue  our 
tour with environments found along the margins of the oceans, 
including kelp forests and coral reefs, the intertidal zone, and 
salt marshes. We then venture up rivers and streams, important 
avenues for exchange between terrestrial and aquatic environ-
ments. Finally, we consider lakes, inland aquatic environments 
that are similar in many ways to the oceans where we begin.

   The Oceans 
 The blue solitude of open ocean is something palpable, a sen-
sation  you  can  almost  taste. As  we  have  seen,  the  only  ter-
restrial biomes that evoke anything close to the feeling of this 
place are the open prairies and deserts like the Namib, where 
the extensive dunes are called the “sand sea.” But there is a 
difference between these terrestrial environments and the sea. 
On the open ocean, all is blue—blue water stretching to the 
horizon, where it meets blue sky ( fig. 3.3 ). 

 Experience with terrestrial organisms cannot prepare you 
for what you encounter in samples taken from the deep ocean. 
We dream of unknown extraterrestrial beings, some friendly and 
some  monstrous,  all  with  strange  and  shocking  anatomy. We 
parade them through science fiction literature and films, while, 
unknown to most of us, creatures as odd and wonderful, some 
beyond imagining, live in the deep blue world beyond the conti-
nental shelves.  Figure 3.4  shows one of the species found in the 
deep sea—a female deep-sea anglerfish with her male partner. 

  Geography 
 The world ocean, which covers over 360 million km 2 , is a con-
tinuous,  interconnected  mass  of  water.  This  water  is  spread 

among  three  major  ocean  basins:  the  Pacific,  Atlantic,  and 
Indian, each with several smaller seas, bodies of water partly 
enclosed by land, along its margins. The largest ocean basin, the 
Pacific, has a total area of nearly 180 million km 2  and extends 
from the Antarctic to the Arctic Sea. In the Pacific Ocean, the 
major seas include the Gulf of California, the Gulf of Alaska, 
the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, the China 
Sea,  the Tasman  Sea,  and  the  Coral  Sea. The  second  largest 
basin, the Atlantic, has a total area of over 106 million km 2  and 
also extends nearly from pole to pole. The major seas of the 
Atlantic are the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, the North Sea, 
the Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea. The 
smallest  of  the  three  oceans,  the  Indian,  with  a  total  area  of 
just under 75 million km 2 , is mostly confined to the Southern 
Hemisphere. Its major seas are the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian 
Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea ( fig. 3.5 ). 

 The Pacific is also the deepest ocean, with an average depth 
of over 4,000 m. The average depths of the Atlantic and Indian 
Oceans are approximately equal, at just over 3,900 m. Undersea 
mountains stud the floor of the deep ocean, some isolated and 
some in long chains that run as ridges for thousands of kilo-
meters.  Undersea  trenches,  some  of  great  depth  and  volume,

The dorsal appendage is a lure 
that gives off light produced by 
symbiotic bacteria.

Compared to other fish, the 
number and size of fins and the 
skeletal system are reduced.

Prey attracted by the lure are 
seized by oversized teeth.

Males of the species are reduced 
to a sperm-producing parasitic 
appendage of females.

The darkness, low food availability, and high pressures of the deep-sea 
environment have selected for organisms quite different from those typical 
of either shallow seas or the terrestrial environment. Only the females of 
this deep-sea anglerfish species are active predators.

 Oceanic circulation, which is driven mainly by the prevailing winds under the influence of the Coriolis effect, moderates earth’s 

rip through the seafloor. One such trench, the Marianas, in the 
western Pacific Ocean, is over 10,000 m deep—deep enough to 
engulf Mount Everest with 2 km to spare. The peak of Mauna 
Loa in Hawaii is a bit over 4,000 m above sea level, a modest 

height for a mountain. However, the base of Mauna Loa extends 
6,000 m below sea level, making it, from base to peak, one of 
the tallest mountains on earth. What new biological discoveries 
might await future ecologists along this undersea slope?

 Structure 
 The oceans can be divided into several vertical and horizontal 
zones ( fig. 3.6 ). The shallow shoreline under the influence of 
the rise and fall of the tides is called the     littoral    ,  or     intertidal, 
zone    .  The     neritic zone    extends from the coast to the margin 
of the continental shelf, where the ocean is about 200 m deep. 
Beyond the continental shelf lies the     oceanic zone    .  The ocean 
is also generally divided vertically into several depth zones. 
The      epipelagic  zone     is  the  surface  layer  of  the  oceans  that 
extends to a depth of 200 m. The     mesopelagic zone    extends 
from  200  to  1,000  m,  and  the      bathypelagic  zone     extends 
from 1,000 to 4,000 m. The layer from 4,000 to 6,000 m is 
called the     abyssal zone    ,  and finally the deepest parts of the 
oceans belong to the     hadal zone    .  Habitats on the bottom of 
the  ocean,  and  other  aquatic  environments,  are  referred  to 
as  benthic, while those off the bottom, regardless of depth, 
are called     pelagic    .  Each of these zones supports a distinctive 
assemblage of marine organisms. 

  Physical Conditions 
 Light  
Approximately  80%  of  the  solar  energy  striking  the  ocean  is 
absorbed in the first 10 m. Most ultraviolet and infrared light is 
absorbed in the first few meters. Within the visible range, red, 
orange, yellow, and green light are absorbed more rapidly than 

blue  light.  Consequently,  the  open  ocean  appears  blue—the 
wavelength most likely scattered back to our eyes. In the first 
10 m, the marine environment is bright with all the colors of 
the rainbow; below 50 or 60 m it is a blue twilight.  Figure 3.7  
compares the colors seen by a scuba diver in deep and shallow 
water to demonstrate the selective absorption of light by water. 
Even in the clearest oceans on the brightest days, the amount of 
sunlight penetrating to a depth of 600 m is approximately equal 
to the intensity of starlight on a clear night. That leaves, on aver-
age, about 3,400 m of deep black water in which the only light 
is that produced by bioluminescent fishes and invertebrates. 

  Temperature 
 The  solar  energy  absorbed  by  water  increases  the   kinetic 
energy,  or velocity of motion, of water molecules. We detect 
this increased kinetic state as increased temperature. Because 
more rapid molecular motion decreases water density, warm 
water floats on cold water. As a consequence, surface water 
warmed  by  the  sun  floats  on  the  colder  water  below. These 
warm and cold layers are separated by a     thermocline    ,  a layer 
of  water  through  which  temperature  changes  rapidly  with 
depth.  This  layering  of  the  water  column  by  temperature, 
which is called  thermal stratification,  is a permanent feature 
of tropical oceans. Temperate oceans are stratified only dur-
ing the summer, and the thermocline breaks down as surface 
waters cool during fall and winter. At high latitudes, thermal 

50 

Section I 

  Natural History and Evolution

stratification is only weakly, if ever, developed. As we shall 
see, these differences in thermal conditions at different lati-
tudes have far-reaching ecological consequences. 

 At  the  ocean  surface,  average  annual  temperature  and 
annual  variation  in  temperature  change  with  latitude  but,  at 
all latitudes, oceanic temperatures are much more stable than 
terrestrial  temperatures.  The  lowest  average  oceanic  tem-
perature, about  2 1.5 8 C, is around the Antarctic. The highest 
average surface temperatures, a bit over 27 8 C, occur near the 
equator.  Maximum  annual  variation  in  surface  temperature, 
approximately 7 8  to 9 8 C, occurs in the temperate zone above 
40 8  N latitude. Near the equator the total annual range in tem-
perature is about 1 8 C. The greatest stability in oceanic tem-
peratures, however, is below the surface. At just 100 m depth, 
annual variation in temperature is often less than 1 8 C.  

  Water Movements 
 The oceans are never still. Prevailing winds drive currents that 
transport  nutrients,  oxygen,  and  heat,  as  well  as  organisms, 
across the globe. Oceanic currents moderate climates, fertilize 
the surface waters off the continents, stimulate photosynthesis, 
and promote gene flow among populations of marine organisms. 
Wind-driven  surface  currents  sweep  across  vast  expanses  of 
open ocean to create great circulation systems called     gyres    that, 
under the influence of the Coriolis effect (see p. 48), move to the 
right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern 
Hemisphere (see  fig. 3.5 ). The great oceanic gyres transport cold 
water from high latitudes toward the equator and warm water 
from equatorial regions toward the poles, moderating climates at 
middle and high latitudes. A segment of one of these gyres, the 
Gulf Stream, moderates the climate of northwest Europe. 

 In addition to surface currents, there are deep-water cur-
rents  such  as  those  produced  as  cooled,  high-density  water 
sinks  at  the Antarctic  and Arctic  that  move  along  the  ocean 
floor. Deep water may also be moved to the surface in a pro-
cess called     upwelling    .  Upwelling occurs along the west coasts 
of continents and around Antarctica, where winds blow sur-
face water offshore, allowing colder water to rise to the sur-
face. These various water movements are like undersea winds 
but with a difference: water is vastly more dense than air.   

  Chemical Conditions 
  Salinity  
The  amount  of  salt  dissolved  in  water,  called      salinity    ,   varies 
with latitude and among the seas that fringe the oceans. In the 
open ocean, it varies from about 34 g of salt per kilogram of 
water (%, or parts per thousand) to about 36.5%. The lowest 
salinities occur near the equator and above 40 8  N and S lati-
tudes, where precipitation exceeds evaporation. The excess of 
precipitation over evaporation at these latitudes is clearly shown 
by the climate diagrams for temperate forests, boreal forests, 
and tundra that we examined in chapter 2 (see figs. 2.28, 2.31, 
and 2.34). Highest salinities occur in the subtropics at about 20 8  
to 30 8  N and S latitudes, where precipitation is low and evapo-
ration  high—precisely  those  latitudes  where  we  encountered 
deserts (see fig. 2.19). Salinity varies a great deal more in the 
small, enclosed basins along the margins of the major oceans. 

The Baltic Sea, which is surrounded by temperate and boreal 
forest biomes and receives large inputs of freshwater, has local 
salinities of 7% or lower. In contrast, the Red Sea, which is sur-
rounded by deserts, has surface salinities of over 40%. 

 Despite considerable variation in total salinity, the rela-
tive proportions of the major ions (e.g., sodium [Na  1  ], mag-
nesium  [Mg  21  ],  and  chloride  [Cl  2  ])  remain  approximately 
constant from one part of the ocean to another. This uniform 
composition, which is a consequence of continuous and vig-
orous mixing of the entire world ocean, underscores the phys-
ical connections across the world’s oceans.  

  Oxygen 
 Oxygen is present in far lower concentrations and varies much 
more in the oceans than in aerial environments. A liter of air 
contains about 200 mL of oxygen at sea level, while a liter of 
seawater contains a maximum of about 9 mL of oxygen. Typi-
cally, oxygen concentration is highest near the ocean surface 
and decreases progressively with depth to some intermediate 
depth generally reaching a minimum at 1,000 m or less. From 
this minimum, oxygen concentration increases progressively 
to the bottom. However, some marine environments such as 
the  deep  waters  in  the  Black  Sea  and  in  the  Norwegian  sill 
fjords are devoid of oxygen.   

  Biology 
 There is a close correspondence between physical and chemi-
cal conditions and the diversity, composition, and abundance 
of oceanic organisms. For instance, because of the limited pen-
etration  of  sunlight  into  seawater,  photosynthetic  organisms 
are limited to the brightly lighted upper epipelagic zone of the 
ocean (see  fig. 3.6 ). The most significant photosynthetic inhab-
itants of this zone, also called the  photic zone,  are microscopic 
organisms called     phytoplankton    that drift with the currents in 
the open sea. The small animals that drift with these same cur-
rents are called     zooplankton    .  While there is no ecologically 
significant photosynthesis below the photic zone, there is no 
absence  of  deep-sea  organisms.  Fishes,  ranging  from  small 
bioluminescent forms to giant sharks, and invertebrates from 
tiny crustaceans to giant squid, prowl the entire water column. 
There is life even in the deepest trenches, below 10,000 m. 

 Most  deep-sea  organisms  are  nourished—whatever  their 
place  in  the  food  chain—by  organic  matter  fixed  by  photo 
synthesis near the surface. It was long assumed that the rain of 
organic matter from above was the  only  source of food for deep-
sea organisms. Then, about three decades ago the sea surprised 
everyone. There are entire biological communities on the sea-
floor that are nourished not by photosynthesis at the surface but 
by chemosynthesis on the ocean floor (see chapter 7, p. 156). 
These oases of life are associated with undersea hot springs and 
harbor many life-forms entirely new to science ( fig. 3.8 ). 

 The deep ocean shines with the blue of pure water and is 
often called a “biological desert.” While it is true that the average 
rate of photosynthesis per square meter of ocean surface is simi-
lar to that of terrestrial deserts, the oceans, because they are so 
vast, contribute approximately one-half of the total photosynthe-
sis in the biosphere. This oceanic production constitutes a sub-
stantial contribution to the global carbon and oxygen budgets.

oceans  has  been  a  buffer  against  human  intrusions,  but  our 
influence is growing. The decline of large whale populations 
around Antarctica and elsewhere sounded a warning of what 
we can do to the open ocean system. The killing of whales has 
been curtailed, but there are plans to harvest the great whales’ 
food supply, the small planktonic crustaceans known as  krill.  
Although we may find them less engaging than their predators, 
the  large  whales,  these  zooplankton  may  be  more  important 
to the life of the open ocean. Whales are not the only marine 
populations that have collapsed. Overfishing has led to great 
declines in commercially important fish stocks, such as the cod 
population  of  Newfoundland’s  Grand  Banks.  Many  marine 
fish populations, which once seemed inexhaustible, are now all 
but gone and fishing fleets sit idle in ports all over the world. 

 Another threat to marine life is the possibility of dumping 
wastes of all sorts, including nuclear and chemical wastes, into 
the deep ocean. In recent years, chemical pollution of the sea 
has increased substantially, and chemical pollutants are accu-
mulating  in  deep-sea  sediments.  In  addition,  plastic  debris, 
which  is  resistant  to  decomposition,  has  built  up  in  the  cen-
tral portions of the oceans in extensive “garbage patches.” The 
larger pieces can entrap marine animals, while small fragments 
interfere with the feeding of seabirds and other marine species.   

  Life in Shallow Marine Waters: 
Kelp Forests and Coral Gardens 
 The  shallow  waters  along  continents  and  around  islands 
support  marine  communities  of  high  diversity  and  biomass. 
Imagine yourself snorkeling along a marine shore, beyond the 
intertidal  zone.  If  you  are  at  temperate  latitudes  and  over  a 
solid bottom, you are likely to swim through groves of brown 
seaweed called  kelp.  Along many coasts, kelp grows so tall, 
over  40  m  in  some  places,  and  in  such  densities  that  they 
resemble submarine forests ( fig. 3.10 ).

 Chemosynthesis-based community dominated by giant 

 The open ocean is home, the only home, for thousands 
of  organisms  with  no  counterparts  on  land.  The  terrestrial 
environment  supports  11  animal  phyla,  only  one  of  which, 
Onychophora, is endemic to the terrestrial environment—that 
is,  found  in  no  other  environments.  Fourteen  phyla  live  in 
freshwater  environments  but  none  are  endemic.  Meanwhile, 
the marine environment supports 28 phyla, 13 of which are 
endemic to the marine environment ( fig. 3.9 ). 

 Does the greater diversity of phyla in the marine environ-
ment shown in  figure 3.9  contradict our impression of high 
biological diversity in biomes such as the tropical rain forest? 
No, it does not. The terrestrial environment is extraordinarily 
diverse because there are many species in a few animal and 
plant phyla, especially arthropods and flowering plants. Still, 
the number of marine species may also be very high. The first 
Census of Marine Life, which took place between 2000 and 
2010  with  2,700  participating  scientists,  resulted  in  an  esti-
mate of at least 1 million marine species, only one-fourth of 
which are currently known to science. The census uncovered 
a  huge  repository  of  diversity  among  microbes,  which  may 
include  hundreds  of  millions  of  distinctive  species.  Clearly 
the oceans remain one of the frontiers for biological discovery.  

  Human Influences 
 Human impact on the oceans was once less than on other parts 
of the biosphere. For most of our history, the vastness of the

 Investigating the Evidence  3 

 Determining the Sample Median 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 3.9  Calculate the median of a sample drawn from a 

population.

 3.10  Explain the conditions under which it is appropri-
ate to use a median, rather than a mean, to repre-
sent the typical member of a population.

In chapter 2 (p. 18) we determined the sample mean. However, 
while the sample mean is one of the most common and useful 
of summary statistics, it is not the most appropriate statistic for 
some situations. One of the assumptions underlying the use of 
the sample mean is that the observations used to calculate it are 
drawn from a population with a normal, or bell-shaped, dis-
tribution. However, where the distribution of values within a 
population deviates substantially from a normal distribution, it 
may be better to use another estimator of the population “aver-
age.” An alternative statistic is the    sample median    .  The sam-
ple median is the middle value in a sample. Let’s determine the 
median for the sample we used to determine a sample mean in 
chapter 2. Here is the table summarizing that sample:

To determine the sample median it’s convenient to reorder the 
observations in a sample from lowest to highest:

observations ordered from lowest to highest

 Because there was an odd number of observations in this sam-
ple, 11, there is a middle value in the series of observations, 
with 5 observations with higher value and 5 with lower value. 
That  middle  value  occurs  at  sample  rank  number  6  and  the 
height of the seedling with this rank happens to be 6 cm. So, 
the sample median is 6 cm. Notice that this value is very simi-
lar to the sample mean we calculated in chapter 2, which was 

5.7 cm. In this case, the sample mean and sample median give 
similar estimates of the average within the population. 

However, where a population contains a few very large 
or  very  small  values,  the  sample  median  may  give  a  better 
estimate  of  the  average  within  the  population.  Consider  the 
following sample of the abundance of mayfly nymphs living 
within 0.1 m 2  areas of stream bottom. The sample was taken 
from a high mountain stream of the southern Rocky Moun-
tains and the mayfly species was  Baetis bicaudatus:

 In  this  case,  because  one  of  the  samples  contained 
126 nymphs, the sample median and sample mean give very 
different  estimates  of  the  average  number  of   B.  bicaudatus  
living  within  a  0.1  m 2   area  of  the  study  stream.   Because 
this sample has an even number of observations the sample 
median is determined as the average of the two middle obser-
vations.  That is:

 The sample mean is     
0.1  m 2 .  This  estimate  of  the  population  mean  is  more  than 
three  times  the  estimate  provided  by  the  sample  median.  In 
this  case  it  is  clear  that  the  sample  median,  which  again  is 
the middle value in an ordered sample of observations, more 
closely  estimates  the  number  of   B.  bicaudatus   that  you  are 
likely  to  encounter  within  0.1  m 2   of  benthic  habitat  in  this 
mountain stream. 

  C RITIQUING   THE  E VIDENCE  3 
     1.  Suppose you find that an organism is fairly evenly distrib-
uted across most of a habitat but is found at 10 times typi-
cal numbers in a few hotspots. In such a situation, which 
would  be  a  better  description  of  the  typical  population 
density—the mean or median?  

    2.  Why  are  comparisons  of  per  capita  income  in  different 
countries  generally  reported  as  differences  in  median 
income, rather than mean income?    

  At this time, there is no universally accepted mathematical symbol for sample median.

 If you snorkel in the tropics, you may come across a coral 
reef so diverse in color and texture that it appears to be a well-
tended  garden  ( fig.  3.11 ).  But  these  are  forests  and  gardens 
with a difference. Here, you can soar through the canopy with 
fish so graceful they are called “eagle” rays or float leisurely 
along with “butterfly” fish. 

 Geography 
 The nearshore marine environment and its inhabitants vary 
with  latitude.  In  temperate  to  subpolar  regions,  wherever 
there is a solid bottom and no overgrazing, there are pro-
fuse  growths  of  kelp.  As  you  get  closer  to  the  equator, 
these  kelp  forests  are  gradually  replaced  by  coral  reefs. 
Coral  reefs  are  confined  to  low  latitudes  between  30 8   N 
and S ( fig. 3.12 ). 

 Structure 
 Charles Darwin (1842b) was the first to place coral reefs into three 
categories:  fringing  reefs,  barrier  reefs,  and  atolls  ( fig.  3.13 ). 
    Fringing reefs    hug the shore of a continent or an island. Bar-
rier reefs, such as the Great Barrier Reef, which stretches for 
nearly 2,000 km off the northeast coast of Australia, stand some 
distance offshore. A     barrier reef    stands between the open sea 
and a lagoon. Coral     atolls    ,  which dot the tropical Pacific and 
Indian oceans, consist of coral islets that have built up from a 
submerged oceanic island and ring a lagoon. 

 Distinctive  habitats  associated  with  coral  reefs  include 
the  reef crest,  where corals grow in the surge zone created by 
waves coming from the open sea. The reef crest extends to a

depth of about 15 m. Below the reef crest is a  buttress zone,  
where coral formations alternate with sand-bottomed canyons. 
Behind the reef crest lies the  lagoon,  which contains numer-
ous small coral reefs called  patch reefs  and sea grass beds. 

 Beds  of  kelp,  particularly  those  of  giant  kelp,  have 
structural  features  similar  to  those  of  terrestrial  forests. 
At  the  water’s  surface  is  the   canopy,   which  may  be  more 

than 25 m above the seafloor. The  stems,  or  stipes,  of kelp 
extend from the canopy to the bottom and are anchored with 
structures called  holdfasts.  On the stipes and fronds of kelp 
grow numerous species of epiphytic algae and sessile inver-
tebrates.  Other  seaweed  species  of  smaller  stature  usually 
grow  along  the  bottom,  forming  an  understory  to  the  kelp 
forest ( fig. 3.14 ).

  Biology 
 Coral reefs face intense, and sometimes complex, biological dis-
turbance. Periodic outbreaks of the predatory crown-of-thorns 
sea star,  Acanthaster planci,  which eats corals, have devastated 
large areas of coral reef in the Indo-Pacific region. In a Carib-
bean coral reef community, populations of a sea star relative, the 
sea urchin  Diadema antillarum,  eat both algae and corals. How-
ever, these urchins benefit the corals by reducing algal popula-
tions that compete for space with young corals (see  fig. 3.14 ). 

 Coral reefs and kelp beds are among the most productive 
and diverse of all ecological systems in the biosphere. Robert 
Whittaker and Gene Likens (1973) estimated that the rate of 
primary production on coral reefs and algal beds exceeds that 
of tropical rain forests. This productivity depends on a mutu-
ally beneficial relationship between reef-building corals and 
algae called zooxanthellae (see chapter 15, p. 342). It is the 
zooxanthellae that give the coral in  figure 3.14  its greenish 
color. The center of diversity for reef-building corals is the 
western  Pacific  and  eastern  Indian  oceans,  where  there  are 
over 600 coral species and over 2,000 species of fish.  

  Human Influences 
 Coral reefs and kelp forests are increasingly exploited for 
a  variety  of  purposes.  Tons  of  kelp  are  harvested  for  use 
as  a  food  additive  and  for  fertilizer.  Fortunately,  most  of 
this  harvest  is  quickly  replaced  by  kelp  growth.  Corals, 
however, which are intensively harvested and bleached for 
decorations,  do  not  quickly  replace  themselves.  The  fish 
and shellfish of kelp forests and coral reefs have also been 
heavily  exploited.  Once  again,  it  appears  that  coral  reefs 
are more vulnerable. Some coral reefs have been so heav-
ily  fished,  both  for  food  and  for  the  aquarium  trade,  that 
most of the larger fish are rare. Unfortunately, some espe-
cially destructive means of fishing are used on coral reefs, 
including dynamite and poison, with disastrous results. In 
the Philippines, over 60% of the area once covered by coral 
has been destroyed by these techniques during recent years. 
Pollution,  especially  nutrient  enrichment  from  human 
population, is a growing threat to coral reefs. In addition, 
as  the  surface  temperature  of  the  oceans  has  warmed  in 
recent decades, corals have increasingly expelled their zoo-
xanthellae,  resulting  in  a  loss  of  their  color  called  “coral 
bleaching.”  Bleaching  episodes  have  been  often  followed 
by massive coral mortality.   

  Marine Shores: Life Between 
High and Low Tides 
 The rise and fall of the tides make the shore one of the most 
dynamic environments in the biosphere. The intertidal zone 
is a magnet for the curious naturalist and one of the most con-
venient places to study ecology. Where else in the biosphere 
does the structure of the landscape change several times each 
day? Where else does nature expose entire aquatic communi-
ties  for  leisurely  exploration?  Where  else  are  environmen-
tal and biological gradients so compressed? It should be no 
surprise  that  here  in  the  intertidal  zone,  immersed  in  tide 

  Figure 3.14  
 The sea urchin  Diadema antillarum  on a coral reef. 
Feeding by this sea urchin appears to play a key role in the interaction 
between reef-building corals and benthic algae on Caribbean coral reefs.  

  Physical Conditions 
  Light 
 Both  seaweeds  and  reef-building  corals  grow  only  in  surface 
waters, where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. 
The depth of light penetration sufficient to support kelp and coral 
varies with local conditions from a few meters to nearly 100 m.  

  Temperature 
 Temperature  limits  the  distribution  of  both  kelp  and  coral. 
Most  kelp  are  limited  to  temperate  shores,  where  tempera-
tures may fall below 10 8 C in winter and rise to a bit above 
20 8 C in summer. Reef-building corals are restricted to warm 
waters, where the minimum temperature does not fall below 
about 18 8  to 20 8 C and average temperatures usually vary from 
about 23 8  to 25 8 C. Temperatures above about 29 8 C are usually 
lethal to reef-building corals.  

  Water Movements 
 Coral  reefs  and  kelp  beds  are  continuously  washed  by  oce-
anic  currents  that  deliver  oxygen  and  nutrients  and  remove 
waste products. However, extremely strong currents and wave 
action, as during hurricanes, can detach entire kelp forests and 
flatten coral reefs.   

  Chemical Conditions 
  Salinity 
 Coral  reefs  grow  only  in  waters  with  fairly  stable  salinity. 
Heavy  rainfall  or  runoff  from  rivers  that  reduces  salinity 
below  about  27%  of  seawater  can  be  lethal  to  corals.  Kelp 
beds appear to be more tolerant of freshwater runoff and grow 
well along temperate shores, where surface salinities are sub-
stantially reduced by runoff from large rivers.  

  Oxygen 
 Coral  reefs  and  kelp  beds  usually  occur  where  vigorous 
wave action or active currents help sustain a well-oxygenated 
environment.

tidal habitats, where competition for space is commonly intense.  

 A rocky shore at low tide. These mussels, growing on 

pools, salt spray, and the distinctive smell of kelp, ecologists 
have found the inspiration and circumstance for some of the 
most elegant experiments and most enduring generalizations 
of  ecology. The  intertidal  zone,  the  area  covered  by  waves 
at high tide and exposed to air at low tides ( fig. 3.15 ), has 
proved to be an illuminating window to the world. 

  Geography 
 Countless thousands of kilometers of coastline around the world 
have intertidal zones. From a local perspective, it is significant 

to distinguish between exposed and sheltered shores. Battered 
by the full force of ocean waves, exposed shores support very 
different organisms from those found along sheltered shores on 
the inside of headlands or in coves and bays. A second impor-
tant distinction is between rocky and sandy shores.  

 Structure 
 Although  conditions  vary  continuously  through  the  intertidal 
zone, marine biologists have divided it historically into several 
vertical zones ( fig. 3.16 ). The highest zone, called the  supratidal 
fringe,  or  splash zone,  is seldom covered by high tides but often 
wetted by waves. Below this fringe is the intertidal zone proper. 
The  upper  intertidal  zone  is  covered  only  during  the  highest 
tides, while the lower intertidal zone is uncovered only during 
the lowest tides. Between the upper and lower intertidal zones is 
the middle intertidal zone, which is covered and uncovered dur-
ing average tides. Below the intertidal zone is the  subtidal zone,  
which remains covered by water even during the lowest tides. 

 Physical Conditions 
  Light  
Intertidal  organisms  are  exposed  to  wide  variations  in  light 
intensity. At high tide, water turbulence reduces light inten-
sity, while at low tide, intertidal organisms are exposed to the 
full intensity of the sun.  

  Temperature  
Because the intertidal zone is exposed to the air once or twice 
each day, intertidal temperatures are always changing. At high 
latitudes, tide pools, small basins that retain water at low tide,

can cool to freezing temperatures during low tides, while tide 
pools along tropical and subtropical shores can heat to temper-
atures in excess of 40 8 C. The dynamic intertidal environment 
contrasts sharply with the stability of most marine environments.  

 Water Movements 
 The two most important water movements affecting the dis-
tribution and abundance of intertidal organisms are the waves 
that  break  upon  the  shore  and  the  tides.  The  tides  vary  in 
magnitude and frequency. Most tides are  semidiurnal,  that is, 
there are two low tides and two high tides each day. However, 
in seas, such as the Gulf of Mexico and the South China Sea, 
there are  diurnal  tides, that is, a single high and low tide each 
day. The total rise and fall of the tide varies from a few centi-
meters along some marine shores to 15 m at the Bay of Fundy 
in northeastern Canada ( fig. 3.17 ). 

 The  sun  and  moon  and  local  geography  determine  the 
magnitude  and  timing  of  tides.  The  main  tide-producing 
forces  are  the  gravitational  pulls  of  the  sun  and  moon  on 
water.  Of  the  two  forces,  the  pull  of  the  moon  is  greater 
because,  although  the  sun  is  far  more  massive,  the  moon  is 
much  closer.  Tidal  fluctuations  are  greatest  when  the  sun 
and moon are working together, that is, when the sun, moon, 
and  earth  are  in  alignment,  which  happens  at  full  and  new 
moons. These times of maximum tidal fluctuation are called 
 spring tides.  Tidal fluctuation is least when the gravitational 

effects of the sun and moon are working in opposition, that is, 
when the sun and moon, relative to earth, are at right angles 
to each other, as they are at the first and third quarters of the 
moon.  These  times  of  minimum  tidal  fluctuation  are  called 
 neap tides.  The size and geographic position of a bay, sea, or 
section of coastline determine whether the influences of sun 
and moon are amplified or damped and are responsible for the 
variations in tides from place to place. 

 The amount of wave energy to which intertidal organisms 
are exposed varies considerably from one section of coast to 
another; this variation affects the distribution and abundance 
of intertidal species. Exposed headlands are hit by high waves 
( fig. 3.18 ), and they are subjected to strong currents, which 
are at times as strong as those of swift rivers. Coves and bays 
are  the  least  exposed  to  waves,  but  even  the  most  sheltered 
areas may be subjected to intense wave action during storms. 

  Chemical Conditions 
  Salinity  
Salinity  in  the  intertidal  zone  varies  much  more  than  in  the 
open ocean, especially within tide pools isolated at low tide. 
Rapid  evaporation  during  low  tide  increases  the  salinity 
within tide pools along desert shores. Along rainy shores at 
high latitudes and in the tropics during the wet season, tide 
pool organisms can experience much reduced salinity.  

  Oxygen 
 Oxygen does not generally limit the distributions of intertidal 
organisms for two major reasons. First, intertidal species are 
exposed to air at each low tide. Second, the water of wave-
swept shores is thoroughly mixed and therefore well oxygen-
ated.  An  intertidal  environment  where  oxygen  availability 
may be low is in interstitial water within the sediments along 
sandy  or  muddy  shores,  especially  in  sheltered  bays,  where 
water circulation is weak.

Section I 

  Natural History and Evolution

  Biology 
 Intertidal  organisms  are  adapted  to  an  amphibious  existence, 
partly  marine,  partly  terrestrial.  All  intertidal  organisms  are 
adapted to periodic exposure to air, but some species are better 
equipped than others to withstand that exposure. This fact pro-
duces one of the most noticeable intertidal features,     zonation of 
species    .  Species living at the highest levels of the intertidal zone 
are exposed by almost all tides and remain exposed the longest. 
Others are exposed during the lowest tides only, perhaps once or 
twice per month, or even less frequently. Microtopography also 
influences  the  distribution  of  intertidal  organisms.  Tide  pools 
support very different organisms than sections of the intertidal 
zone from which the water drains completely. The channels in 
which  seawater  runs,  like  a  salty  stream,  during  the  ebb  and 
flow of the tides offer yet another habitat. 

 The substratum also affects the distribution of intertidal 
organisms.  Hard,  rocky  substrates  support  a  biota  different 
from that on sandy or muddy shores. You can see a profusion 
of life on rocky shores because many species are attached to 
rock surfaces (see  fig. 3.15 ). The residents of the rocky inter-
tidal zone include sea stars, barnacles, mussels, sea urchins, 
and seaweeds. However, most intertidal organisms are incon-
spicuous, since they take shelter at low tide, some among the 
fronds and holdfasts of kelp and others under boulders. There 
are  even  animals  that  burrow  into  and  live  inside  rocks. As 
we shall see when we discuss competition in chapter 13 and 
predation in chapter 14, biological interactions influence the 
distributions of intertidal organisms. 

 On soft bottoms most organisms are burrowers and shel-
ter themselves within the sand or mud bottom. To thoroughly 
study  the  life  of  sandy  shores  you  must  separate  organisms 
from  sand  or  mud.  Perhaps  this  is  the  reason  rocky  shores 
have gotten more attention by researchers and why we know 
far less about the life of sandy shores. Beaches, like the open 
ocean, have been considered biological deserts. Careful stud-
ies,  however,  have  shown  that  the  intensity  and  diversity  of 
life on sandy shores rivals that of any benthic aquatic com-
munity (McLachlan and Dorvlo 2005).  

  Human Influences 
 People have long sought out intertidal areas, first for food and 
later  for  recreation,  education,  and  research.  Shell  middens, 
places where prehistoric people piled the remains of their sea-
food  dinners,  from  Scandinavia  to  South Africa,  bear  mute 
testimony  to  the  importance  of  intertidal  species  to  human 
populations for over 100,000 years. Today, each low tide still 
finds  people  all  over  the  world  scouring  intertidal  areas  for 
mussels, oysters, clams, and other species. But many intertidal 
organisms, which resist, and even thrive, in the face of twice 
daily exposure to air and pounding surf, are easily devastated 
by the trampling feet and probing hands of a few human visi-
tors. Relentless exploitation has severely reduced many inter-
tidal populations. Exploitation for food is not the only culprit, 
however. Collecting for education and research also takes its 
toll. The intertidal zone is also vulnerable to disruption by oil 
spills, which have damaged intertidal areas around the world.   

 Transitional Environments: Estuaries, 
Salt Marshes, Mangrove Forests, 
and Freshwater Wetlands 
     Estuaries     are  found  wherever  rivers  meet  the  sea.      Salt 
marshes    and     mangrove forests    are concentrated along low-
lying  coasts  with  sandy  shores  and  may,  like  estuaries,  be 
associated with the mouths of rivers.  Freshwater wetlands, 
such as swamps and marshes, occupy low-lying areas within 
landscapes and are generally inundated with water for some 
part of each year. All four are at the transition between one 
environment  and  another—salt  marshes  and  mangrove  for-
ests  at  the  transition  between  land  and  sea,  estuaries  at  the 
transition between river and sea, and freshwater wetlands at 
the  transition  between  land  and  freshwater.  Because  these 
areas  are  transitions  between  very  different  environments, 
they have a great deal in common physically, chemically, and 
biologically. These are particularly productive environments 
that teem with life.   Figure 3.19  shows a rich salt marsh land-
scape, and  figure 3.20  shows the structurally complex envi-
ronment  provided  by  dense  populations  of  mangroves  and 
their many prop roots. 

 Geography 
 Salt  marshes,  which  are  dominated  by  herbaceous  vegeta-
tion,  are  concentrated  along  sandy  shores  from  temperate 
to  high  latitudes.  At  tropical  and  subtropical  latitudes  the 
herb- dominated salt marsh is replaced by mangrove forests 
( fig. 3.21 ). Mangroves are associated with the terrestrial cli-
mates of the tropical rain forest, tropical dry forest, savanna, 
and  desert,  due  mainly  to  the  sensitivity  of  mangroves  to 
frost. Estuaries occur wherever rivers enter the sea and fresh-
water  marshes  can  form  wherever  runoff  waters  collect  in 
low-lying areas. 

 Structure 
 Salt  marshes  generally  include  channels,  called  tidal  creeks, 
that  fill  and  empty  with  the  tides.  These  meandering  creeks 
can create a complex network of channels across a salt marsh 
( fig.  3.22 ).  Fluctuating  tides  move  water  up  and  down  these 
channels,  or  tidal  creeks,  once  or  twice  each  day,  gradually 
sculpting  the  salt  marsh  into  a  gently  undulating  landscape 
( fig. 3.23 ). Tidal creeks are generally bordered by natural levees. 
Beyond the levees are marsh flats, including small basins called 
 salt pans  that periodically collect water that eventually evapo-
rates, leaving a layer of salt. This entire landscape is flooded 
during the highest tides and drains during the lowest tides. 

 Mangrove trees of different species are generally distrib-
uted according to height within the intertidal zone ( fig. 3.24 ). 
For instance, in mangrove forests near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 
the mangroves growing nearest the water belong to the genus 
 Rhizophora.  At  this  level  in  the  intertidal  zone,   Rhizophora  
is inundated by average high tides. Above  Rhizophora  grow 
other mangroves such as  Avicennia,  which is flooded by the 
average spring tides, and  Laguncularia,  which is touched only 
by the highest tides.

  Temperature  
The temperatures of these transitional environments are highly 
variable. Because they are generally shallow, water tempera-
ture  varies  with  air  temperature.  Since  the  temperatures  of 
seawater and river water may be very different, the tempera-
ture of an estuary may change with each high and low tide. 
Salt marshes at high latitudes may freeze during the winter. In 
contrast, mangroves grow where the minimum annual temper-
ature is about 20 8 C and the shallows can heat up to over 40 8 C.  

  Water Movements  
Ocean  tides  and  river  flow  drive  the  complex  currents  in 
estuaries.  These  currents  are  at  the  heart  of  the  ecological 
processes  of  the  estuary  because  they  transport  organisms, 
renew nutrients and oxygen, and remove wastes. Tidal cur-
rents also flow in salt marshes and mangrove forests, where 
they are involved in these processes and fragment and trans-
port the litter produced by salt marsh and mangrove vegeta-
tion. Once or twice a day, high tides create saltwater currents 
that move up the estuaries of rivers and the channels within 
salt marshes and mangrove forests. Low tides reverse these 
currents and saltwater moves seaward. Tidal height may fluc-
tuate far from where an estuary meets the sea. For example, 
tidal  fluctuations  occur  over  200  km  upstream  from  where 
the  Hudson  River  flows  into  the  sea.  Vigorous  mixing,  in 
more  than  one  direction,  makes  these  transitional  environ-
ments some of the most physically dynamic in the biosphere. 
The  generally  limited  water  movements  in  freshwater  wet-
lands are mainly driven by wind.

  Physical Conditions 
  Light  
Estuaries,  salt  marshes,  and  mangrove  forests  experience 
significant  fluctuations  in  tidal  level.  Consequently,  the 
organisms in these environments are exposed to highly vari-
able light conditions. They may be exposed to full sunlight 
at low tide and very little light at high tide. The waters of 
these  environments  as  well  as  in  freshwater  wetlands  are 
usually turbid because of shifting currents, and agitation of 
their shallow waters by wind which keep fine organic and 
inorganic materials in suspension.

  Chemical Conditions 
 Salinity  
The salinity of estuaries, salt marshes, and mangrove forests 
may fluctuate widely, particularly where river and tidal flow 
are substantial. In such systems, the salinity of seawater can 
drop to nearly that of freshwater an hour after the tide turns. 
Because estuaries are places where rivers meet the sea, their 
salinity is generally lower than that of seawater. In hot, dry 
climates,  however,  evaporation  often  exceeds  freshwater 
inputs and the salinity in the upper portions of estuaries may 
exceed that of the open ocean. 

 Estuarine  waters  are  also  often  stratified  by  salinity, 
with lower-salinity, low-density water floating on a layer of 
higher-salinity water, isolating bottom water from the atmo-
sphere.  On  the  incoming  tide,  seawater  coming  from  the 
ocean and river water are flowing in opposite directions. As 
seawater flows up the channel, it mixes progressively with 
river  water  flowing  in  the  opposite  direction.  Due  to  this 
mixing, the salinity of the surface water gradually increases 

down river from less than 1% to salinities approaching that 
of seawater at the river mouth ( fig. 3.25 ). 

  Oxygen 
 In  these  transitional  environments  oxygen  concentration  is 
highly variable and often reaches extreme levels. Decomposi-
tion of the large quantities of organic matter produced in these 
environments can deplete dissolved oxygen to very low lev-
els, and isolation of saline bottom water from the atmosphere 
adds to the likelihood that oxygen will be depleted in estuar-
ies. At the same time, however, high rates of photosynthesis 
can  increase  dissolved  oxygen  concentrations  to  supersatu-
rated  levels. Again,  the  oxygen  concentrations  to  which  an 
organism is exposed in estuaries, salt marshes, and mangrove 
forests can change with each turn of the tide.   

  Biology 
 The salt marshes of the world are dominated by grasses such as 
 Spartina  spp. and  Distichlis  spp., by pickleweed,  Salicornia  spp.,

by mangrove trees belonging to many genera. The species that 
make up the forest change from one region to another; however, 
within a region, there is great uniformity in species composition. 
 Because  of  their  highly  variable  physical  and  chemical 
conditions,  estuaries  and  salt  marshes  don’t  support  a  great 
diversity  of  species,  but  they  are  generally  very  abundant. 
These are places where some of the most productive fisheries 
occur and where aquatic and terrestrial species find nursery 
grounds  for  their  young.  Most  of  the  fish  and  invertebrates 
living in estuaries evolved from marine ancestors, but estuar-
ies also harbor a variety of insects of freshwater origin. What-
ever their origins, however, the species that inhabit estuaries 
and salt marshes have to be physiologically tough. Estuaries 
and salt marshes also attract birds, especially water birds. In 
the mangrove forest, birds are joined by crocodiles, alligators 
and, in the Indian subcontinent, by tigers. Freshwater  wetlands 
are also among the most productive of environments.  

 Human Influences 
 Estuaries,  salt  marshes,  mangrove  forests,  and  freshwater 
wetlands are extremely vulnerable to human interference. All 
around  the  world  freshwater  wetlands  have  been  drained  to 
support  agriculture.  Meanwhile  salt  marshes  and  estuaries 
have been magnets for urban development. People want to live 
and work at the coast, but building sites are limited. One solu-
tion to the problem of high demand for coastal property and 
low supply has been to fill and dredge salt marshes, replac-
ing  wildlife  habitat  with  human  habitat  ( fig.  3.26 ).  Because 
cities benefit from access to the sea, many, such as Boston, 
San Francisco, and London, have been built on estuaries. As a 
consequence, many estuaries have been polluted for centuries. 
The discharge of organic wastes into estuaries depletes oxy-
gen  directly  as  it  decomposes,  and  the  addition  of  nutrients 
such as nitrogen can lead to oxygen depletion by stimulating 

 Salt marshes are vulnerable to a wide range of human-

primary production. Enrichment by organic matter and nutri-
ents and resulting oxygen depletion have produced extensive 
“dead zones” in coastal waters adjacent to where large rivers, 
such  as  the  Mississippi,  discharge  into  the  sea.  Heavy  met-
als discharged into estuaries and salt marshes are incorporated 
into plant and animal tissues and have been, through the pro-
cess of bioaccumulation, elevated to toxic levels in some food 
species.  Vast  areas  of  mangrove  forests  have  been  cleared 
to  make  room  for  shrimp  farms  and  charcoal  making.  The 
assaults on estuaries and salt marshes have been chronic and 
intense, but there is growing awareness of their importance. 
In the aftermath of the tragic Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, 
governments across Southern Asia have been replanting man-
grove forests, since those areas with intact mangrove forests 
suffered the least damage and loss of human lives.

  Rivers and Streams: Life Blood

 We  become  aware  of  the  importance  of  rivers  ( fig.  3.27 )  in 
human history and economy as we name the major ones: Nile, 
Danube,  Tigris,  Euphrates,  Yukon,  Indus,  Tiber,  Mekong, 
Ganges,  Rhine,  Mississippi,  Missouri,  Yangtze,  Amazon, 
Seine,  Congo, Volga, Thames,  Rio  Grande. The  importance 
of rivers, both great and small, to human history and economy 
is inestimable. However, river ecology has lagged behind the 
ecological study of lakes and oceans and is one of the young-
est of the many branches of aquatic ecology. In the past few 
decades, however, river ecology has exploded with published

research, competing theories, controversies, and international 
symposia and now claims a well-earned place beside its more 
mature cousins. 

 Geography 
 Rivers drain most of the landscapes of the world ( fig. 3.28 ). 
When rain falls on a landscape, a portion of it runs off, either 
as surface or subsurface flow. Some of this runoff water even-
tually collects in small channels, which join to form larger and 
larger water courses until they form a network of channels that 
drains the landscape. A river basin is that area of a continent 
or an island that is drained by a river drainage network, such 
as the Mississippi River basin in North America or the Congo 
River basin in Africa. Rivers eventually flow out to sea or to 
some interior basin like the Aral Sea or the Great Salt Lake. 
River basins are separated from each other by watersheds, that 
is, by topographic high points. For instance, the peaks of the 
Rocky  Mountains  divide  runoff  from  melting  snow.  Runoff 
water on the east side of the peaks flows to the Atlantic Ocean, 
while runoff on the west side flows to the Pacific Ocean. 

  Structure 
 Rivers  and  streams  vary  along  three  spatial  dimensions 
( fig.  3.29 ).  Pools,  runs,  riffles,  and  rapids  occur  along  their 
 lengths.  Because of variation in flow, rivers can also be divided 
across their  widths  into wetted and active channels. The wet-
ted channel contains water even during low flow conditions, 
while the active channel is inundated at least annually during 
high flows. Outside the active channel is the     riparian zone    ,  
a transition between the aquatic environment of the river and 
the upland terrestrial environment. Rivers and streams can be

divided   vertically   into  the  water  surface,  the  water  column, 
and the bottom, or benthic, zone. The benthic zone includes 
the surface of the bottom substrate and the interior of the sub-
strate through depths at which substantial surface water still 
flows. Below the benthic zone is the     hyporheic zone    ,  a zone 
of transition between areas of surface water flow and ground-
water. The area containing groundwater below the hyporheic 
zone is called the     phreatic zone    .  

 Streams and rivers can be classified by where they occur in 
a drainage network—that is, by     stream order    .  In this system, 
headwater streams are first order, while a stream formed by the 
joining of two first order streams is a second order stream. A 
third order stream results from the joining of two second order 
streams, and so on. A lower order stream, say a first order, join-
ing a higher order stream, for instance, a second order stream, 
does not raise the order of the stream below the junction.  

  Physical Conditions 
 Light 
 Even  the  clearest  streams  are  generally  more  turbid  than 
clear lakes or seas. The reduced clarity of rivers, and result-
ing  lower  penetration  of  light,  results  from  two  main  fac-
tors. First, rivers are in intimate contact with the surrounding 
landscape, and inorganic and organic materials continuously 
wash, fall, or blow into rivers. Second, river turbulence erodes 
bottom sediments and keeps them in suspension, particularly

 during floods. The headwaters of rivers are generally shaded 
by  riparian  vegetation  ( fig.  3.30 a  ),  which  may  be  so  dense 
that shading inhibits photosynthesis by aquatic primary pro-
ducers. The extent of shading decreases progressively down-
stream as stream width increases. In arid regions, headwater 
streams usually receive large amounts of solar radiation and 
support high levels of photosynthesis ( fig. 3.30 b  ). 

  Temperature  
The temperature of rivers closely tracks air temperature but does 
not reach the extremes of terrestrial habitats. The coldest river 
temperatures,  those  of  high  altitudes  and  high  latitudes,  may 
drop to a minimum of 0 8 C. The warmest rivers are those flow-
ing through deserts, but even desert rivers seldom exceed 30 8 C.  

  Water Movements 
 River  currents  deliver  food,  remove  wastes,  renew  oxygen, 
and  strongly  affect  the  size,  shape,  and  behavior  of  river 
organisms.  Currents  in  quiet  pools  may  flow  at  only  a  few 
millimeters per second, while water in the rapids of swift riv-
ers in a flood stage may flow at 6 m per second. Contrary to 
popular belief, the currents of large rivers may be as swift as 
those in the headwaters. 

 The amount of water carried by rivers, which is called  river 
discharge,   differs  a  lot  from  one  climatic  regime  to  another 
( fig.  3.31 ).  River  flows  are  often  unpredictable  and  “flashy”

in arid and semiarid regions, where extended droughts may be 
followed by torrential rains. Flow in tropical rivers also var-
ies considerably. Many tropical rivers, which flow very little 
during the dry season, become torrents during the wet season. 
Some of the most constant flows are found in forested temper-
ate regions, where precipitation is often fairly evenly distrib-
uted throughout the year (see fig. 2.28). Forested landscapes 
can  damp  out  variation  in  flow  by  absorbing  excessive  rain 
during wet periods and acting as a reservoir for river flow dur-
ing drier periods. 

 It appears that the health and ecological integrity of rivers 
and streams depend upon keeping the natural flow regime for 
a region intact. Historical patterns of flooding have particu-
larly important influences on river ecosystem processes, espe-
cially  on  the  exchange  of  nutrients  and  energy  between  the 
river channel and the floodplain and associated wetlands. This 
idea, which was first proposed as the     flood pulse concept    ,  is 
supported by a growing body of evidence from research con-
ducted on rivers on virtually every continent.   

  Chemical Conditions 
 Salinity 
 Water  flowing  across  a  landscape  or  through  soil  dissolves 
soluble materials. The amount of salt dissolved in river water 
reflects the prevailing climate in its basin ( fig. 3.32 ). As we 
saw in chapter 2, annual rainfall is high in tropical regions. 
Consequently, many tropical soils have been leached of much 
of their soluble materials and it is in the tropics that the salin-
ity  of  river  water  is  often  very  low.  Desert  rivers  generally 
have the highest salinities. 

  Oxygen 
 The  oxygen  content  of  water  is  inversely  correlated  with 
temperature.  Oxygen  supplies  are  generally  richest  in  cold, 
thoroughly mixed headwater streams and lower in the warm, 
downstream sections of rivers. However, because the waters 
in streams and rivers are continuously mixed, oxygen is gen-
erally not limiting to the distribution of river organisms. The

major exception to this generalization is in sections of streams 
and rivers receiving organic wastes from cities and industry. 
 Such  wastes  have  high  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  or 
BOD, a measure of organic pollution defined as the amount 
of  dissolved  oxygen  required  by  microbes,  mainly  bacteria 
and fungi, to decompose the organic matter in a water sample.   

 Biology 
 As in the terrestrial biomes, large numbers of species inhabit 
tropical  rivers.  The  number  of  fish  species  in  tropical  riv-
ers  is  much  higher  than  in  temperate  rivers.  For  example, 
the Mississippi River basin, which supports one of the most 
diverse  temperate  fish  faunas,  is  home  to  about  300  fish 
species.  By  contrast,  the  tropical  Congo  River  basin  con-
tains about 669 species of fish, of which over 558 are found 
nowhere else. The most impressive array of freshwater fish 
is  that  of  the  Amazon  River  basin,  which  contains  over 
2,000 species, approximately 10% of all the known fish spe-
cies on the planet. 

 Most of the invertebrates of streams and rivers live on or 
in the sediments; that is, most are benthic. However, a great 
number and diversity of invertebrate animals live deep within 
the  sediments  of  rivers  in  both  the  hyporheic  and  phreatic 
zones. These species can be pumped up with well water many 
kilometers from the nearest river. 

 The  organisms  of  river  systems  change  from  headwa-
ters  to  mouth.  These  patterns  of  biological  variation  along 
the courses of rivers have given rise to a variety of theories 
that  predict  downstream  change  in  rivers  and  their  inhabit-
ants. One of these theories is the     river continuum concept    
(Vannote et al. 1980). According to this concept, in temperate 
regions, leaves and other plant parts are often the major source 
of  energy  available  to  the  stream  ecosystem.  Upon  entering 
the stream, this coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) is 
attacked by aquatic microbes, especially fungi. Colonization 

by  fungi  makes  CPOM  more  nutritious  for  stream  inverte-
brates.  The  stream  invertebrates  of  headwater  streams  are 
usually dominated by two feeding groups: shredders, which 
feed on CPOM, and collectors, which feed on fine particulate 
organic matter (FPOM). The fishes in headwater streams are 
usually those, such as trout, that require high oxygen concen-
trations and cool temperatures. 

 The  river  continuum  concept  predicts  that  the  major 
sources  of  energy  in  medium-sized  streams  will  be  FPOM 
washed  down  from  the  headwater  streams  and  algae  and 
aquatic  plants.  Algae  and  plants  generally  grow  more  pro-
fusely  in  less-shaded,  medium-sized  streams  in  which  the 
benthic  invertebrate  community  is  dominated  by  collectors 
and grazers. The fishes of medium streams generally tolerate 
somewhat higher temperatures and lower oxygen concentra-
tions than headwater fishes. 

 In  large  rivers,  the  major  sources  of  energy  are  FPOM 
and, in some rivers, phytoplankton. Consequently, the benthic 
invertebrates of large rivers are dominated by collectors. Fish 
in large, temperate rivers are those, such as carp and catfish, 
that  are  more  tolerant  of  lower  oxygen  concentrations  and 
higher water temperatures, and because of the development of 
a plankton community, plankton-feeding fish ( fig. 3.33 ). 

 Observing that river systems do not vary smoothly from 
headwaters  to  mouth,  James  Thorp,  Martin  Thoms,  and 
Michael Delong (2006, 2008) proposed an alternative to the 
river continuum concept. They called their alternative model 
the      river  ecosystem  synthesis.     Thorp  and  his  colleagues 
pointed out that flow conditions and geologic structure do not 
change continuously along the course of a river but instead 
have patchy distributions. For example, a river might follow 
a low-gradient meandering path in several sections along its 
length,  while  in  other  sections  swift  flow  is  constrained  by 
steep canyon walls ( fig. 3.34 ). The core of the river ecosys-
tem  synthesis  perspective  is  that  river  sections  with  similar 
flow  and  geologic  characteristics—for  example,  meander-
ing  sections—are  more  similar  to  each  other  ecologically 
than  they  are  to  sections  with  different  flow  and  geologic 
characteristics—for  example,  high- gradient  reaches  flow-
ing through steep-walled canyons. In other words, the river 
ecosystem synthesis proposes that flow conditions and geo-
logic  setting  may  be  of  greater  significance  in  determining 
ecological characteristics—for example, the kinds of organ-
isms  living  in  a  section  of  river—than  is  the  position  of  a 
river  section  in  a  theoretical  continuum.  Most  importantly, 
from  a  scientific  perspective,  the  river  ecosystem  synthesis 
authors include many testable hypotheses in their theoretical 
framework. 

  Human Influences 
 The  influence  of  humans  on  rivers  has  been  long  and 
intense.  Rivers  have  been  important  to  human  populations 
for commerce, transportation, irrigation, and waste disposal. 
Because  of  their  potential  to  flood,  they  have  also  been  a 
constant  threat.  In  the  service  of  human  populations,  riv-
ers  have  been  channelized,  poisoned,  filled  with  sewage,

dammed, filled with nonnative fish species, and completely 
dried. One of the most severe human impacts on river sys-
tems  has  been  the  building  of  reservoirs.  Reservoirs  elimi-
nate the natural flow regime—including flood pulses—alter 
temperatures, and impede the movements of migratory fish. 
Because of the rapid turnover of their waters, however, rivers 
have  a  great  capacity  for  recovery  and  renewal.  The  River 
Thames in  England was severely polluted in the Middle Ages 
and  remained  so  until  recent  times.  During  recent  decades, 
great efforts have been made to reduce the amount of pollu-
tion discharged into the Thames, and the river has recovered 

substantially.  The  Thames  once  again  supports  a  run  of 
Atlantic salmon and gives hope to all the beleaguered river 
conservationists of the world.   

  Lakes: Small Seas 
 In  1892,  F.  A.  Forel  defined  the  scientific  study  of  lakes 
as  the   oceanography  of  lakes.   On  the  basis  of  a  lifetime  of 
study,  Forel  concluded  that  lakes  are  much  like  small  seas

area of over 245,000 km 2  and contain 24,620 km 3  of water, 
approximately  20%  of  all  the  freshwater  on  the  surface  of 
the  planet. An  additional  20%  of  freshwater  is  contained  in 
Lake Baikal, Siberia, the deepest lake on the planet (1,600 m), 
with a total volume of 23,000 km 3 . Much of the remainder is 
contained within the rift lakes of East Africa. Lake Tangan-
yika, the second deepest lake (1,470 m), alone has a volume 
of 23,100 km 3 , virtually identical to that of Lake Baikal. Still, 
the world contains tens of thousands of other smaller, shallow 
lakes, usually concentrated in “lake districts” such as north-
ern Minnesota, much of Scandinavia, and vast regions across 
north-central Canada and Siberia.  Figure 3.36  shows the loca-
tions of some of the larger lakes. 

 Structure 
 Lake  structure  parallels  that  of  the  oceans  but  on  a  much 
smaller  scale  ( fig.  3.37 ).  The  shallowest  waters  along  the 
lake  shore,  where  rooted  aquatic  plants  may  grow,  is  called 
the littoral zone. Beyond the littoral zone in the open lake is 
the     limnetic zone    .  The     epilimnion    encompasses the surface 
layer  of  lakes.  Below  the  epilimnion  is  the  thermocline,  or 
    metalimnion    .  The thermocline is a zone through which tem-
perature  changes  substantially  with  depth,  generally  about 
1 8 C per meter of depth. Below the thermocline are the cold, 
dark waters of the     hypolimnion    .  

  Physical Conditions 
  Light 
 Lake  color  ranges  from  the  deep  blue  of  the  clearest  lakes 
to  yellow,  brown,  or  even  red.  Lake  color  is  influenced  by 
many  factors  but  especially  lake  chemistry  and  biological 
activity.  In  lakes  where  the  surrounding  landscape  delivers 
large quantities of nutrients, primary production is high and

isolation.  Perhaps  because  they  are  cast  on  a  more  human 
scale, lakes have long captured the imagination of everyone 
from poets to scientists. 

 Geography 
 Lakes  are  simply  topographic  depressions  in  the  landscape 
that collect water. Most are found in regions worked over by 
the geological forces that produce such basins. These forces 
include  shifting  of  the  earth’s  crust  (tectonics),  volcanism, 
and glacial activity. 

 Most  of  the  world’s  freshwater  resides  in  a  few  large 
lakes. The Great Lakes of North America together cover an

phytoplankton  populations  reduce  light  penetration.  These 
highly productive lakes are usually a deep green. They are also 
often  shallow  and  surrounded  by  cultivated  lands  or  cities. 
Dissolved organic compounds, such as humic acids leached 
from forest soils, increase absorption of blue and green light, 
shifting lake color to yellow-brown. In deep lakes where the 
landscape  delivers  low  quantities  of  either  nutrients  or  dis-
solved organic compounds, phytoplankton production is gen-
erally low and light penetrates to great depths. These lakes, 
such as Lake Baikal in Siberia, Lake Tahoe in California, and 
Crater Lake in Oregon, are nearly as blue as the open ocean.  

 Temperature 
 As in the oceans, lakes become thermally stratified as they heat. 
Consequently, during the warm season, they are substantially 

warmer  at  the  surface  than  they  are  below  the  thermocline. 
Temperate lakes are stratified during the summer, while low-
land tropical lakes are stratified year-round. As in temperate 
seas, thermal stratification breaks down in  temperate lakes as 
they cool during the fall. The seasonal dynamics of  thermal 
stratification  and  mixing  in  temperate  lakes  are  shown  in 
  figure  3.38 .  In  high-elevation  tropical  lakes,  a  thermocline 
may form every day and break down every night! 

  Water Movements 
 Wind-driven mixing of the water column is the most ecologi-
cally  important  water  movement  in  lakes. As  we  have  just 
seen, temperate zone lakes are thermally stratified during the 
summer,  a  condition  that  limits  wind-driven  mixing  to  sur-
face  waters  above  the  thermocline.  During  winter  on  these 
lakes, ice forms a surface barrier that prevents mixing. Dur-
ing spring and fall, however, stratification breaks down and 
winds  drive  vertical  currents  that  can  mix  temperate  lakes 
from top to bottom. These are the times when a lake renews 
oxygen in bottom waters and replenishes nutrients in surface 
waters. Like tropical seas, tropical lakes at low elevations are 
permanently stratified. Of the 1,400 m of water in Lake Tan-
ganyika,  for  example,  only  about  the  upper  200  m  are  cir-
culated each year. Tropical lakes at high elevations heat and 
stratify  every  day  and  cool  sufficiently  to  mix  every  night. 
Patterns of mixing have profound consequences to the chem-
istry and biology of lakes.   

  Chemical Conditions 
  Salinity  
The  salinity  of  lakes  is  much  more  variable  than  that  of 
the  open  ocean.  The  world  average  salinity  for  freshwa-
ter, 120 mg per liter (approximately 0.120%), is a tiny frac-
tion of the salinity of the oceans. Lake salinity ranges from 
the  extremely  dilute  waters  of  some  alpine  lakes  to  the  salt

brines  of  desert  lakes.  For  instance,  the  Great  Salt  Lake  in 
Utah sometimes has a salinity of over 200%, which is much 
higher than oceanic salinity. The salinity of desert lakes may 
also  change  over  time,  particularly  where  variations  in  pre-
cipitation, runoff, and evaporation combine to produce wide 
fluctuations in lake volume.  

  Oxygen 
 Mixing  and  biological  activities  have  profound  effects  on 
lake  chemistry. Well-mixed  lakes  of  low  biological  produc-
tion,  which  are  called      oligotrophic    ,   are  nearly  always  well 
oxygenated.  Lakes  of  high  biological  production,  which 
are  called      eutrophic    ,   may  be  depleted  of  oxygen.  Nutrient 
enrichment as a consequence of human activities can acceler-
ate the process of  eutrophication, a process generally result-
ing in increased primary production, including excessive algal 
blooms, oxygen depletion, and reduced biodiversity.  Oxygen 
depletion  is  particularly  likely  during  periods  of  thermal 

stratification, when decomposing organic matter accumulates 
below  the  thermocline  and  consumes  oxygen.  In  eutrophic 
lakes,  oxygen  concentrations  may  be  depleted  from  surface 
waters at night as respiration continues in the absence of pho-
tosynthesis.  Oxygen  is  also  often  depleted  in  winter,  espe-
cially under the ice of productive temperate lakes. In tropical 
lakes,  water  below  the  euphotic  zone  is  often  permanently 
depleted of dissolved oxygen.   

  Biology 
 In  addition  to  their  differences  in  oxygen  availability,  oli-
gotrophic  and  eutrophic  lakes  also  differ  in  factors  such  as 
availability of inorganic nutrients and temperature ( fig. 3.39 ). 
Because aquatic organisms differ widely in their environmen-
tal  requirements,  oligotrophic  and  eutrophic  lakes  generally 
support distinctive biological communities. 

 Tropical lakes can be very productive. Also, their fish fau-
nas may include a great number of species. Three East  African

lakes, Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi, and Lake  Tanganyika, con-
tain  over  700  species  of  fish,  approximately  the  number  of 
freshwater fish species in all of the United States and Canada; 
Europe and the former Soviet Union together contain only about 
400 freshwater fish species. The invertebrates and algae of trop-
ical lakes are much less studied, but it appears that the number 
of species may be similar to that of temperate zone lakes.  

  Human Influences 
 Human populations have had profound, and usually negative, 
influences on the ecology of lakes. In addition to examples of 
ecological degradation, however, are cases of amazing resil-
ience and recovery—resilience in the face of fierce ecologi-
cal challenge and recovery to substantial ecological integrity. 
Because  lakes  offer  ready  access  to  water  for  domestic  and 
industrial uses, many human population centers have grown 
up  around  them.  In  both  the  United  States  and  Canada,  for 
example,  large  populations  surround  the  Great  Lakes.  The 
human population around Lake Erie, one of the most altered 
of  the  Great  Lakes,  grew  from  2.5  million  in  the  1880s  to 
over 13 million in the 1980s. The primary ecological impact 
of  these  populations  has  been  the  dumping  of  astounding 
quantities  of  nutrients  and  toxic  wastes.  By  the  mid-1960s, 
the  Detroit  River  alone  was  dumping  1.5  billion  gallons  of 
waste  water  into  Lake  Erie  each  day.  The  Cuyahoga  River, 
which flows through Cleveland before reaching the lake, was 
so fouled with oil in the 1960s that it would catch fire. In the 
face of such ecological challenges, much of Lake Erie, par-
ticularly the eastern end, was transformed from a healthy lake 
with a rich fish fauna to one that was, for a time, essentially an 
algal soup in which only the most tolerant fish species could 

live. With greater controls on waste disposal, the process of 
degradation began to reverse itself, and Lake Erie recovered 
much of its former health and vitality by the 1980s. 

 Nutrients aren’t the only things that people put into lakes, 
however. Fish and other species are constantly moved around, 
either intentionally or unintentionally. As  figure 3.40  shows, 
139 species of fish, invertebrates, plants, and algae had been 
introduced to the Great Lakes by 1990.

 Two invaders of the Great Lakes: (a) sea lampreys, shown here attached to a lake trout; and (b) zebra mussels, encrusting a boat rud-

 The  population  growth  of  many  introduced  species  has 
been  explosive  and  has  had  great  ecological  and  economic 
impacts.  One  such  introduction  was  that  of  the  zebra  mus-
sel,   Dreissena  polymorpha,   a  bivalve  mollusk  native  to  the 
drainages emptying into the Aral, Caspian, and Black seas. In 
1988, zebra mussels were collected in Lake Saint Clair, which 
connects  Lake  Huron  and  Lake  Erie.  In  just  3  years,  zebra 
mussels spread to all the Great Lakes and to most of the major 
rivers of eastern North America. 

 Zebra mussels established very dense populations within 
the Great Lakes. Shells from dead mussels have accumulated 
to depths of over 30 cm along some shores. Such dense pop-
ulations threaten the native mussels of the Great Lakes with 
extinction. Zebra mussels are also fouling water intake struc-
tures of power plants and municipal water supplies, resulting 
in billions of dollars in economic impact. However, the conse-
quences of invasive species continue to unfold. Zebra mussels 
have been displaced from some habitats by a close relative, the 
quagga mussel,  Dreissena bugensis  (Ricciardi and Whoriskey 
2004). Together, the two mussel species have multiple effects 
on  Great  Lakes  ecology,  including  increasing  water  clarity 
and nitrogen and phosphorus availability, and enhancing algal 
blooms  (Barbiero  and  Tuchman  2004,  Conroy  et  al.  2005). 
As a consequence of introductions of zebra mussels and other 
species,  the  Great  Lakes  have  become  a  laboratory  for  the 
study of human-caused biological invasions ( fig. 3.41 ). 

  Concept 3.2 Review 

1.   After  years  of  successful  reductions  in  phytoplankton 
populations, phytoplankton blooms are on the increase 
in parts of Lake Erie following the introduction of zebra 
mussels. Why?  

2.   Why  is  the  prospect  of  global  warming  considered  a 

serious threat to coral reefs?  

3.   Why  do  physiologically  tolerant  rather  than  sensitive 

species inhabit estuaries and salt marshes?

 Biological Integrity—Assessing 
the Health of Aquatic Systems    

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 3.11  List the characteristics of fish communities included 

in the Index of Biological Integrity.

 3.12  Explain the environmental significance of each of 
the elements, such as feeding biology of species, 
included in the calculation of an Index of Biologi-
cal Integrity.

 How can we put our knowledge of the natural history of aquatic 
life  to  work? A  major  question  that  biologists  often  face  is 
whether a particular influence impairs the health of an aquatic 
system. Natural history information can play a significant role 
in making that judgment. Given the complex array of potential 
human impacts on aquatic systems, what might we use as indi-
cators of health? An answer to this question has been proposed 
by James Karr and his colleagues, who suggest that we con-
sider what they call “biological integrity,” which they define 
as “a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms 
having a species composition, diversity, and functional organi-
zation comparable to that of the natural habitat of the region” 
(Karr  and  Dudley  1981).  These  researchers  proposed  that  a 
healthy aquatic community is one that is similar to the com-
munity in an undisturbed habitat in the same region. The com-
munity should be “balanced” and “integrated.” Deciding what 
constitutes this state requires judgment based on broad knowl-
edge of the habitats in question and their inhabitants—that is, 
knowledge  of  natural  history.  If  we  could  assess  the  health, 
as defined by Karr, of a community of aquatic organisms, we 
would have gone a long way toward assessing the health of the 
aquatic ecosystem of which this community is part. 

 

Chapter 3 

  Life in Water 

73

 Moving beyond general definitions and broad goals, Karr 
developed an Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) and applied 
his index to fish communities. Fish communities were chosen 
because  we  know  a  lot  about  fish  and  their  habitat  require-
ments and they are relatively easy to sample. Karr’s index has 
three categories for rating a stream or river:

     1.  number  of  species  and  species  composition,  which 
includes the number, kinds, and tolerances of fish species;  
    2.  trophic composition, which considers the dietary habits 

of the fish making up the community;  

    3.  fish abundance and condition.   

Under these three categories there are 12 attributes of the fish 
community. The stream is assigned a score of 5, 3, or 1 for 
each  attribute,  where  5  equals  best  and  1  equals  worst. The 
scores on all the attributes are added to give a total score that 
ranges from 12 (poor biological integrity) to 60 (excellent bio-
logical integrity). Notice that Karr has built a safeguard into 
his  index.  Judging  several  attributes  of  the  fish  community 
eliminates  the  bias  that  might  creep  in  if  assessments  were 
made from only one or a very few attributes. In the following 
sections, we will examine the three community characteristics.   

  Number of Species and Species Composition 
 Heavy human impact generally reduces the number of native 
species in a community while increasing the number of non-
native species. The kinds of species that make up the commu-
nity should also be telling, because some fish, such as trout, 
are intolerant of poor water quality, while others, such as carp, 
are highly tolerant of poor water quality. The designation of 
 tolerant  versus  intolerant  species must be tailored for local, or 
at least regional, circumstance and requires a thorough knowl-
edge of the natural history of the waters under study, as does 
scoring the number and abundance of species.  

  Trophic Composition 
 The dietary habits of the fish that make up a community reflect 
kinds of food available in a stream as well as the  quality of 
the  environment.  The  attributes  rated  in  this   category  are 
the percentage of fish such as carp that eat a wide range of 
food and are called     omnivores    by ecologists, the percentage 
of fish such as trout and bluegill that feed on insects, called 
     insectivores    ,   and  the  percentage  of  fish  such  as  pike  and 
largemouth  bass  that  feed  on  other  fish,  called      piscivores    .  
Degradation of aquatic systems generally increases the pro-
portion of omnivores and decreases the proportion of insecti-
vores and piscivores in the community.  

 Fish Abundance and Condition 
 Fish are often less abundant in degraded situations and their 
condition is often adversely affected. Two aspects of condi-
tion are considered for the index. First,  what percentage of 
the  individuals  are  hybrids  between  different  species?  Sec-
ond, what percentage of individuals have noticeable disease, 
tumors, fin damage, or skeletal deformities—all strong indi-
cators  of  poor  environmental  quality.   Figure  3.42   summa-
rizes  the  process  of  calculating  Karr’s  Index  of  Biological 
Integrity. 

  A Test 
 Paul Leonard and Donald Orth (1986) tested Karr’s Index 
of  Biological  Integrity  in  seven  tributary  streams  of  the 
New  River,  which  flows  through  the Appalachian  Plateau 
region  of  West  Virginia.  Leonard  and  Orth  had  to  adapt 
the  index  to  reflect  conditions  in  their  region.  In  their 
study streams, the number of darter species, small benthic 
fish  in  the  family  Percidae,  indicates  high  environmental 
 quality, while increasing numbers of creek chubs indicate 

Greater numbers of native 
species generally indicate 
higher environmental quality.

High proportions of 
insectivores and carnivores 
indicate higher 
environmental quality, while 
a high proportion of 
omnivores indicates lower 
environmental quality.

Higher proportions of 
diseased fish and fish 
showing tumors and 
anatomical abnormalities 
indicate lower 
environmental quality.

Higher IBI scores 
indicate higher 
environmental quality.

The researcher samples a fish

community and assigns scores (S)
(5 = best, 3 = moderate, 1= worst)
on the basis of several attributes:

 Number and kinds of species (Ss)

 Feeding biology of species (Sf)

Fish abundance (Sa)

Fish health (Sh)

 The researcher adds the scores
of the community on all attributes
to produce an Index of Biological

Integrity (IBI):

 IBI = Ss + Sf + Sa + Sh

several scores in each of 
the following categories.

increasing pollution. In addition, high proportions of insec-
tivores  indicate  excellent  environmental  conditions,  while 
high proportions of generalist feeders, or omnivores, indi-
cate poor conditions. High densities of fish were taken as 
a sign of high environmental quality, while the presence of 
diseased  or  deformed  individuals  indicated  environmental 
problems. 

 Leonard  and  Orth  assigned  scores  of  1  (worst  condi-
tions),  3  (fair  conditions),  or  5  (best  conditions)  for  each 
of the variables they studied at each of their sampling sites 
in  the  study  streams.  They  then  summed  the  scores  for 
the  seven  variables  at  each  site  to  determine  an  Index  of 
 Biological  Integrity.  The  minimum  possible  value  was  7, 
poorest conditions, and the maximum possible value was 35, 
best  conditions.  They  next  made  independent  estimates  of 
levels  of  pollution  at  each  study  site. Their  estimates  were 
based upon the daily discharge of municipal sewage and the 
local densities of septic tanks, roads, and mines. The study 
streams showed a wide range of environmental pollution due 
to  sewage,  mining,  and  urban  development.  Leonard  and 
Orth found that the Index of Biological Integrity correlated 
well  with  independent  estimates  of  pollution  at  each  study 
site ( fig. 3.43 ). 

 Many  other  investigators  have  tested  the  ability  of  the 
Index of Biological Integrity to represent the extent of envi-
ronmental degradation in rivers and lakes. The index is effec-
tive  in  a  wide  range  of  regions  and  aquatic  environments. 
The important point here is that natural history is being put

 Pollution and the Index of Biological Integrity 

 Humans everywhere hold a land-centered perspective of the 
planet. Consequently, aquatic life is often most profuse where 
conditions appear most hostile to people, for example, along 
cold,  wave-swept  seacoasts,  in  torrential  mountain  streams, 
and in the murky waters where rivers meet the sea. 

  The  hydrologic  cycle  exchanges  water  among  reser-
voirs.   Of the water in the biosphere, the oceans contain 97% 
and the polar ice caps and glaciers an additional 2%, leaving 
less than 1% as freshwater. The turnover of water in the vari-
ous reservoirs of the hydrologic cycle ranges from only 9 days 
for the atmosphere to 3,100 years for the oceans. 

  The  biology  of  aquatic  environments  corresponds 
broadly to variations in physical factors such as light, tem-
perature,  and  water  movements  and  to  chemical  factors 
such  as  salinity  and  oxygen.   
 The   oceans   form  the  larg-
est  continuous  environment  on  earth. An  ocean  is  generally 
divided vertically into several depth zones, each with a dis-
tinctive assemblage of marine organisms. Limited light pen-
etration  restricts  photosynthetic  organisms  to  the  photic,  or 
epipelagic, zone and leads to thermal stratification. Oceanic 
temperatures are much more stable than terrestrial tempera-
tures.  Tropical  seas  are  more  stable  physically  and  chemi-
cally; temperate and high-latitude seas are more productive. 

Highest productivity occurs along coastlines. The open ocean 
supports large numbers of species and is important to global 
carbon and oxygen budgets. 

  Kelp  forests   are  found  mainly  at  temperate  latitudes. 
 Coral  reefs   are  limited  to  the  tropics  and  subtropics  to  lati-
tudes between 30 8  N and S latitudes. Coral reefs are gener-
ally one of three types: fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls. 
Kelp  beds  share  several  structural  features  with  terrestrial 
forests.  Both  seaweeds  and  reef-building  corals  grow  only 
in  surface  waters,  where  there  is  sufficient  light  to  support 
photosynthesis.  Kelp  forests  are  generally  limited  to  areas 
where temperature ranges from about 10 8  to 20 8 C, while reef-
building corals are limited to areas with temperatures of about 
18 8  to 29 8 C. The diversity and productivity of coral reefs rival 
that of tropical rain forests. 

 The  intertidal  zone lines the coastlines of the world. It 
can  be  divided  into  several  vertical  zones:  the  supratidal, 
high  intertidal,  middle  intertidal,  and  low  intertidal.  The 
magnitude and timing of the tides is determined by the inter-
action of the gravitational effects of the sun and moon with 
the configuration of coastlines and basins. Tidal fluctuation 
produces  steep  gradients  of  physical  and  chemical  condi-
tions within the intertidal zone. Exposure to waves, bottom

type,  height  in  the  intertidal  zone,  and  biological  interac-
tions  determine  the  distribution  of  most  organisms  within 
this zone. 

  Salt  marshes,  mangrove  forests,  freshwater  wetlands, 
and  estuaries  occur at the transitions between freshwater and 
marine environments and between marine and terrestrial envi-
ronments. Salt marshes, which are dominated by herbaceous 
vegetation, are found mainly at temperate and high latitudes. 
Mangrove  forests  grow  in  the  tropics  and  subtropics.  Estuar-
ies are extremely dynamic physically, chemically, and biologi-
cally. The diversity of species is not as high in estuaries, salt 
marshes, and mangrove forests as in some other aquatic envi-
ronments but productivity is exceptional. 

  Rivers   and   streams   drain  most  of  the  land  area  of  the 
earth  and  reflect  the  land  use  in  their  basins.  Rivers  and 
streams  are  very  dynamic  systems  and  can  be  divided  into 
several distinctive environments: longitudinally, laterally, and 
vertically. Periodic flooding has important influences on the 
structure and functioning of river and stream ecosystems. The 
temperature of rivers follows variation in air temperature but 
does not reach the extremes occurring in terrestrial habitats. 
The flow and chemical characteristics of rivers change with 

climatic  regime.  Current  speed,  distance  from  headwaters, 
and the nature of bottom sediments are principal determinants 
of the distributions of stream organisms. 

  Lakes  are much like small seas. Most are found in regions 
worked over by tectonics, volcanism, and glacial activity, the 
geological forces that produce lake basins. A few lakes con-
tain  most  of  the  freshwater  in  the  biosphere.  Lake  structure 
parallels that of the oceans but on a much smaller scale. The 
salinity of lakes, which ranges from very dilute waters to over 
200%,  is  much  more  variable  than  that  of  the  oceans.  Lake 
stratification  and  mixing  vary  with  latitude.  Lake  flora  and 
fauna largely reflect geographic location and nutrient content. 
 Potential  threats  to  all  these  aquatic  systems  include 
overexploitation  of  populations  and  waste  dumping.  Reser-
voir  construction  and  flow  regulation  have  had  major  nega-
tive impacts on river ecosystems and biodiversity. Freshwater 
environments  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  the  introduction 
of  exotic  species.  The  nature  of  fish  assemblages  is  being 
used  to  assess  the  “biological  integrity”  of  freshwater  com-
munities. The  application  of  this  Index  of  Biological  Integ-
rity depends on detailed knowledge of the natural history of 
regional fish faunas.

  Review Questions 

     1.  Review  the  distribution  of  water  among  the  major  reservoirs 
of the hydrologic cycle. What are the major sources of fresh-
water? Explain why according to some projections availability 
of freshwater may limit human populations and activity.  

    2.  The oceans cover about 360 million km 2  and have an average 
depth of about 4,000 m. What proportion of this aquatic system 
receives sufficient light to support photosynthesis? Make the lib-
eral assumption that the photic zone extends to a depth of 200 m.  
    3.  Below about 600 to 1,000 m in the oceans there is no sunlight. 
However,  many  of  the  fish  and  invertebrates  at  these  depths 
have eyes. In contrast, fish living in caves are often blind. What 

selective  forces  could  maintain  eyes  in  populations  of  deep-
sea  fish?  (Hint:  Many  species  of  deep-sea  invertebrates  are 
bioluminescent.)  

    4.  Darwin (1842) was the first to propose that fringing reefs, barrier 
reefs, and atolls are different stages in a developmental sequence 
that begins with a fringing reef and ends with an atoll. Outline 
how this process might work. How would you test your ideas?  

    5.  How  does  feeding  by  urchins,  which  prey  on  young  corals, 
improve establishment by young corals? Use a diagram outlin-
ing interactions among urchins, corals, and algae to help in the 
development of your explanation.  

76 

Section I 

  Natural History and Evolution

    6.  How might a history of exposure to wide environmental fluc-
tuation affect the physiological tolerances of intertidal  species 
compared  to  close  relatives  in  subtidal  and  oceanic  environ-
ments? How might salinity tolerance vary among organisms liv-
ing at different levels within the intertidal?  

    7.  How might oxygen concentration of interstitial water be related 
to the grain size of the sand or mud sediment? How might the 
oxygen concentrations of tide pools in sheltered bays compare 
to those on the shores of exposed headlands?  

    8.  According to the river continuum model, the organisms inhab-
iting  headwater  streams  in  temperate  forest  regions  depend 
mainly upon organic material coming into the stream from the 
surrounding  forests.  According  to  the  model,  photosynthesis 

within the stream is only important in the downstream reaches 
of these stream systems. Explain. How would you go about test-
ing the predictions of the river continuum model?  

    9.  How could you test the generalization that lake primary produc-
tion and the composition of the biota living in lakes are strongly 
influenced by the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen and 
phosphorus?  Assume  that  you  have  unlimited  resources  and 
that you have access to several experimental lakes.  

   10.  Biological  interactions  may  also  affect  lake  systems.  How 
does  the  recent  history  of  the  Great  Lakes  suggest  that  the 
kinds  of  species  that  inhabit  a  lake  influence  the  nature  of 
the  lake  environment  and  the  composition  of  the  biological 
community?

Genetics and 

Natural Selection 

   Flowering plants have played an important role in the discovery of the 
mechanisms of inheritance. There are several reasons for their impor-
tance, including the fact that plants require little more than a garden 
to maintain them for study and they exhibit a wide range of easily 
observed, genetically controlled physical variation, such as the range 
in colors shown by these poppies.

Section I 

  Natural History and Evolution

  Figure 4.1    The Galápagos Islands are like a natural library of 
evolution, where Charles Darwin encountered many examples of plant 
and animal species that differed physically from one island to another. 
Shown here is the relatively small island of Fernandina and the nearby, 
J-shaped Isabela Island.  

included within natural history with a theoretical framework. 
A key element in that framework is the theory of evolution, 
the centerpiece of the modern life sciences, including ecology. 
 Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, which 
provided a mechanism for evolutionary change in populations, 
was crystallized by his observations in the Galápagos Islands. 
In mid October of 1835 under a bright equatorial sun, a small 
boat moved slowly from the shore of a volcanic island to a wait-
ing ship. The boat carried a young naturalist who had just com-
pleted a month of exploring the group of islands known as the 
Galápagos, which lie on the equator approximately 1,000 km 
west of the South American mainland ( fig. 4.1 ). As the seamen 
rowed  into  the  oncoming  waves,  the  naturalist,  Charles  Dar-
win, mused over what he had found on the island. His observa-
tions had confirmed expectations built on information gathered 
earlier on the other islands he had visited in the archipelago. 
Darwin  recorded  his  thoughts  in  his  journal,  which  he  later 
published  (Darwin  1842a),  “The  distribution  of  the  tenants 
of  this  archipelago  would  not  be  nearly  so  wonderful,  if,  for 
instance, one island had a mocking-thrush, and a second island 
some other quite distinct genus—if one island had its genus of 
lizard and a second island another distinct genus, or none what-
ever. . . . But it is the circumstance, that several of the islands 
possess  their  own  species  of  the  tortoise,   mocking-thrush, 
finches,  and  numerous  plants,  these  species  having  the  same 
general habits, occupying analogous situations, and obviously 
filling the same place in the natural economy of this archipel-
ago,  that strikes me with wonder”  [emphasis added]. 

 Darwin wondered at the sources of the differences among 
clearly related populations and attempted to explain the origin 

of these differences. He would later conclude that these popula-
tions were descended from common ancestors whose descen-
dants had changed after reaching each of the islands. The ship 
to which the seamen rowed was the H.M.S.  Beagle,  halfway 
through a voyage around the world. The main objective of the 
 Beagle ’s mission, charting the coasts of southern South Amer-
ica, would be largely forgotten, while the thoughts of the young 
Charles Darwin would eventually develop into one of the most 
significant theories in the history of science. Darwin’s wonder-
ing, carefully organized and supported by a lifetime of observa-
tion, would become the theory of evolution by natural selection, 
a theory that would transform the prevailing scientific view of 
life on earth and rebuild the foundations of biology. 

 Darwin left the Galápagos Islands convinced that the var-
ious populations on the islands were gradually modified from 
their ancestral forms. In other words, Darwin concluded that 
the island populations had undergone a process of     evolution    ,  
a  process  that  changes  populations  of  organisms  over  time. 
Though Darwin left the Galápagos convinced that the island 
populations had evolved, he had no mechanism to explain the 
evolutionary  changes.  However,  a  plausible  mechanism  to 
produce evolutionary change in populations came to Darwin 
almost  exactly  3  years  after  his  taking  leave  of  the  Galápa-
gos  Islands.  In  October  of  1838  while  reading  the  essay  on 
populations by Thomas Malthus, Darwin was convinced that 
during  competition  for  limited  resources,  such  as  food  or 
space, among individuals within populations, some individu-
als  would  have  a  competitive  advantage.  He  proposed  that 
the  characteristics  producing  that  advantage  would  be  “pre-
served” and the unfavorable characteristics of other individu-
als would be “destroyed.” As a consequence of this process 
of  selection  by  the  environment,  populations  would  change 
over time. With this mechanism for change in hand, Darwin 
sketched out the first draft of his theory of natural selection 
in 1842. However, it would take him many years and many 
drafts before he honed the theory to its final form and amassed 
sufficient supporting information. Darwin’s theory of     natural 
selection    can be summarized as follows:

     1.  Organisms  beget  like  organisms.  (Offspring  appear, 

behave, function, and so forth like their parents.)  

    2.  There are chance variations between individuals in a spe-
cies.  Some  variations  (differences  among  parents)  are 
heritable (are passed on to offspring).  

    3.  More offspring are produced each generation than can be 

supported by the environment.  

    4.  Some individuals, because of their physical or behavioral 
traits, have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing 
than other individuals in the same population.   

Darwin  (1859)  proposed  that  differential  survival  and 
reproduction  of  individuals  would  produce  changes  in  spe-
cies  populations  over  time.  That  is,  the  environment  acting 
on  variation  among  individuals  in  populations  would  result 
in     adaptation    ,  an evolutionary process that changes anatomy, 
physiology, or behavior, resulting in an improved ability of the 
members of a population to live in a particular environment. 
He now had a mechanism to explain the differences among

79

populations  that  he  had  observed  on  the  Galápagos  Islands. 
Still,  Darwin  was  keenly  aware  of  a  major  insufficiency  in 
his  theory.  The  theory  of  natural  selection  depended  upon 
the passage of “advantageous” characteristics from one gen-
eration to the next. The problem was that the mechanisms of 
inheritance were unknown in Darwin’s time. In addition, the 
prevailing  idea  at  the  time,  blending  inheritance,  suggested 
that rare traits, no matter how favorable, would be blended out 
of a population, preventing change as a consequence. 

 Darwin worked for nearly half a century to uncover the laws 
of inheritance. However, he did not. To do so required a facil-
ity with mathematics that Darwin had not developed. In a short 
autobiography, Darwin (Darwin and Darwin 1896, V.1, p. 40) 
remarked, “I attempted mathematics, and even went during the 
summer of 1828 with a private tutor . . . but I got on very slowly. 
The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my not being able 
to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This impatience 
was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted that 
I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something 
of  the  great  leading  principles  of  mathematics,   for  men  thus 
endowed seem to have an extra sense”  [emphasis added]. 

 As  Darwin  explored  the  Galápagos  Islands,  halfway 
around the world in central Europe a schoolboy named Johann 
Mendel was developing the facility with mathematics neces-
sary to complete Darwin’s theory of natural selection. At 13, 
Johann was half Darwin’s age, yet he had already set a course 
for  a  life  of  study  that  he  followed  as  resolutely  as  did  the 
crew of the  Beagle  on their voyage around the world. At the 
end of his scientific voyage, Mendel, who would be renamed 
Gregor Mendel when he became an Augustinian monk, would 
uncover the basic mechanisms of inheritance. 

 How  did  Mendel  succeed,  while  so  many  others  had 
failed? The sources of his success can be traced to his educa-
tion  and  his  own  special  genius.  Mendel’s  education  at  the 
University of Vienna exposed him to some of the best minds 
working in the physical sciences and to an approach to sci-
ence that emphasized experimentation. His introduction to the 
physical sciences included a solid foundation in mathematics, 
including probability and statistics. As a consequence, Men-
del could quantify the results of his experimental research. 

 Mendel chose to work with plants that could be main-
tained in the abbey garden. His most famous and influential 
work was done on the garden pea,  Pisum sativum  ( fig. 4.2 ). 
Many domestic varieties of peas, which showed a great deal 
of physical variation, were available to Mendel. However, 
rather  than  treat  each  variety  of  pea  as  a  whole,  Mendel 
subdivided  each  into  a  set  of  manageable  characteristics 
such as seed form, stem length, and so forth. Fortuitously, 
it turned out that the characteristics chosen by Mendel are 
controlled by different genes on different chromosomes. His 
analytical  approach  led  to  the  discovery  that  genes  come 
in alternative forms, which we call     alleles    ,  some of which 
are “dominant” and others “recessive.” Mendel’s analytical 
perspective  on  his  study  organisms  was  probably  another 
legacy  of  his  training  in  the  physical  sciences.  Finally,  to 
his excellent education and genius, Mendel added a lot of 
hard work and perseverance (Orel 1996). 

  Figure 4.2    Garden pea flowers. Because its flowers are closed, the 
garden pea normally self-pollinates. Consequently, Mendel could keep 
track of and control mating in his study plants.  

 Darwin  and  Mendel  complemented  each  other  per-
fectly and their twin visions of the natural world revolution-
ized biology. The synthesis of the theory of natural selection 
and  genetics  provided  a  unifying  conceptual  foundation  for 
modern biology and gave rise to evolutionary ecology, a very 
broad  field  of  study.  Here  we  examine  five  major  concepts 
within that broad discipline.  

   4.1  Variation Within Populations 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 4.3  Describe phenotypic plasticity.
 4.4  Explain the design of the common garden experi-

ment used to test for genetic differences among 
populations of Potentilla glandulosa.

 4.5  Contrast the methods used to study genetic varia-
tion in populations of P. glandulosa populations 
versus Coregonus in the Alps.

   Phenotypic  variation  among  individuals  in  a  population 
results  from  the  combined  effects  of  genes  and  environ-
ment.   The  phenotype of an organism consists of its observ-
able characteristics, which result from interactions between the 
genetic makeup of the individual and its environment. Because 
phenotypic variation among individuals is the substrate upon 
which the environment acts during the process of natural selec-
tion,  determining  the  extent  and  sources  of  variation  within 
populations  is  one  of  the  most  fundamental  considerations 
in  evolutionary  studies.  Darwin’s  theory  of  natural  selec-
tion  sparked  a  revolution  in  thinking  among  biologists,  who 
responded  almost  immediately  by  studying  variation  among 
organisms in all sorts of environments. The first of these biolo-
gists  to  conduct  truly  thorough  studies  of  variation  and  to 
incorporate experimentation in their studies focused on plants.

Section I 

  Natural History and Evolution

  Variation in a Widely Distributed Plant 
 Jens Clausen, David Keck, and William Hiesey, who worked 
at Stanford University in California, conducted some  of the 
most  widely  cited  studies  of  plant  variation.  Their  studies 
provided  deep  insights  into  the  extent  and  sources  of  mor-
phological variation in plant populations, including both the 
influence of environment and genetics. Though this research 
group and its successors studied nearly 200 species, it is best 
known for its work on  Potentilla glandulosa,  or sticky cinque-
foil ( fig. 4.3 ) (Clausen, Keck, and Hiesey 1940). 

 Clausen and his research team performed what is known 
as a common garden experiment in which individuals from 
two  or  more  populations  are  transplanted  and  grown  in  the 
same,  or  “common,”  environment.  The  team  worked  with 
clones  of  several  populations  of   P.  glandulosa,   which  they 
grew  in  three  main  experimental  gardens—one  at  Stanford 
near the coast at an elevation of 30 m, another in a montane 
environment at Mather at an elevation of 1,400 m in the Sierra 
Nevada, and a third garden in an alpine environment at Timber-
line at 3,050 m ( fig. 4.4 ). By cloning lowland, mid-elevation, 
and alpine plants and growing them in experimental gardens, 
Clausen,  Keck,  and  Hiesey  established  experimental  condi-
tions  that  could  reveal  potential  genetic  differences  among 
populations. In addition, because they studied the responses 
of plants from all populations to environmental conditions in

variation along this elevational gradient.  

lowland, mid-elevation, and alpine gardens, their experiment 
could demonstrate adaptation by  P. glandulosa  populations to 
local environmental conditions. 

 The growth response of  P. glandulosa  to environmental 
conditions  at  the  three  common  garden  sites  is  summarized 
in   figure  4.4 .  Plant  height  differed  significantly  among  the 
study  sites,  which  shows  an  environmental  effect  on  plant 
morphology, but the lowland, mid-elevation, and alpine plants 
responded  differently  to  the  three  environments.  While  the 
mid-elevation and alpine plants attained their greatest height 
in the mid-elevation garden, the lowland plants grew the tall-
est in the lowland garden. The number of flowers produced by 
lowland,  mid-elevation,  and  alpine  plants  also  varied  across 
the gardens. 

 Differences in response  among  and  within  clones of low-
land, mid-elevation, and alpine  P. glandulosa  provide comple-
mentary  information.  Differences   among   clones,  in  growth 
and flower production, at the three common garden sites indi-
cate  genetic  differences  among  lowland,  mid-elevation,  and 
alpine populations of  P. glandulosa.  Meanwhile, differences 
in growth and flower production  within  clones grown at the 
three  elevations  are  the  result  of  environmental  differences 
among the common garden sites, not genetic differences. This 
is  an  example  of      phenotypic  plasticity   —that  is,  variation 
among individuals in form and function as a result of environ-
mental influences. 

 Other  observations  by  Clausen,  Keck,  and  Hiesey  indi-
cate that the genetic variation among the plant populations was 
associated with adaptation to local environments. For instance, 
most lowland plants died during their first winter in the alpine 
garden and those that survived did not produce seed. Alpine 
plants showed the opposite trends. They had poor survival in 
the lowland garden and went dormant in winter, while the low-
land plants remained active. In summary, the experiments of 
Clausen, Keck, and Hiesey demonstrated genetic differences 
among  populations  and  adaptation  to  their  natural  environ-
ments. Ecologists call such locally adapted and genetically dis-
tinctive populations within a species     ecotypes    .  Applying this 
term  then,  we  can  conclude  that  the  lowland,  mid- elevation, 
and alpine populations studied by Clausen, Keck, and Hiesey 
were ecotypes. 

 Using transplant and common garden approaches ecolo-
gists have learned a great deal about genetic variation among 
and within plant populations. These classical approaches com-
bined with modern molecular techniques are rapidly increas-
ing our knowledge of genetic variation in natural populations.  

  Variation in Alpine Fish Populations 
 The Alps rise out of the landscape of South Central Europe, 
forming  a  moist  and  cool  high-elevation  environment.  The 
Alps’ deep winter snows and glaciers make them the origin 
of four important rivers: the Danube, Rhine, Po, and Rhone 
rivers.  Because  the  headwater  streams  of  these  rivers  are 
cool, they became refuges for cold-water aquatic organisms 
following the last ice age. As temperatures of the surround-
ing  lowlands  began  to  warm  at  the  end  of  the  Pleistocene,

  Figure 4.4    A common garden approach to studying genetic variation among populations of  Potentilla glandulosa  (data from Clausen, Keck, 
and Hiesey 1940).  

approximately  12,000  years  ago,  aquatic  species  requiring 
cold  water  migrated  to  the  headwaters  of  these  rivers.  The 
movement of cold-adapted aquatic species into the headwater 
streams and lakes of the glacial valleys that lace the Alps cre-
ated clusters of geographically isolated populations ( fig. 4.5 ). 
This  isolation  reduced  movements  of  individuals  between 
populations.  With  reduced  gene  flow,  populations  could 
diverge genetically. Such genetic divergence would increase 
the genetic variation among populations. 

 Morphological  differences  among  populations  of  head-
water  fish  species  in  the Alps  have  long  suggested  genetic 

differences among them. Nowhere has morphological varia-
tion among populations been better studied and documented 
than  among  the  whitefishes.  Whitefish  are  relatives  of  the 
trout  and  salmon  and  are  classified  in  the  genus    Coregonus  
( fig. 4.6 ). Marlis Douglas and Patrick Brunner (2002) explored 
the  genetic  and  phenotypic  variation  among  populations  of 
 Coregonus  in the Central Alps. Douglas and Brunner pointed 
out that ichthyologists have described 19 indigenous  Corego-
nus   populations  from  the  Central Alps.  However,  there  has 
been  significant  disagreement  over  the  taxonomic  status  of 
these 19 populations. The classification of these populations

  Natural History and Evolution

  Figure 4.5    Lake Lucerne, Switzerland, lies nestled in the heart of 
the Alps, where it provides an extensive cold-water habitat for aquatic 
organisms, including whitefish,  Coregonus,  populations.  

  Figure 4.6    Whitefish,  Coregonus  sp., are adapted to cold, highly 
oxygenated waters like their relatives the trout and salmon. Because 
they are valued food fishes, whitefish have been intensively managed 
particularly in the Central Alps.  

ranges from that of a single variable species with 19 distinc-
tive populations to dividing the 19 populations into more than 
a dozen separate species. 

 The  taxonomic  status  of   Coregonus   populations  in  the 
Central Alps is made more difficult by a 100-year history of 
intensive fisheries management. Douglas and Brunner review 
this history, which included raising  Coregonus  in hatcheries 
and moving fish between lakes. One of the main purposes of 
the study by Douglas and Brunner was to describe the genetic 
variation among the present-day populations of  Coregonus  to 
determine  if  there  is  evidence  for  significant  genetic  differ-
ences  among  historically  recognized  populations. A  second 
purpose was to examine the genetic similarity between intro-
duced  Coregonus  populations and the populations from which 
they were drawn. Using this information, Douglas and Brun-
ner  intended  to  offer  suggestions  for  the  management  and 
conservation of  Coregonus  in the Central Alps. 

 Douglas and Brunner collected 907  Coregonus  specimens 
from 33 populations in 17 lakes in the Central Alpine region 
and used a mixture of anatomical and genetic features to char-
acterize the fish. The anatomical features were the number of 
rays in the dorsal, anal, pelvic, and pectoral fins, the extent of 
pigmentation in these fins, and the number of gill rakers on 
the first gill arch. The study populations were characterized 
genetically  using      microsatellite  DNA    ,   tandemly  repetitive 
nuclear  DNA  in  which  a  few  base  pairs,  for  example,  three 
base pairs, are repeated up to 100 times. 

 Genetic analyses by Douglas and Brunner demonstrated a 
moderate to high level of genetic variation within all 33 study 
populations.  They  also  found  that  genetic  and  morphological 
analyses distinguished the 19 historically recognized  Coregonus  
populations of the Central Alps. Genotypic differences among 
populations  were  sufficient  to  correctly  assign  individual  fish 
to  the  indigenous  population  from  which  they  were  sampled 
with approximately a 71% probability. Fin ray counts correctly 
assigned fish to the 19 indigenous populations with a 69% prob-
ability,  while  pigmentation  could  identify  them  with  a  43% 
probability. Combining genetic and phenotypic data increased 
the  correct  assignment  of  specimens  to  the  populations  from 
which they were drawn to 79%. Genetic analyses of the intro-
duced  Coregonus  populations revealed their genetic similarity 
to  the  populations  from  which  they  were  stocked.  However, 
these analyses also showed that the introduced populations have 
differentiated genetically from their source populations. 

 The conclusion that Douglas and Brunner drew from these 
results was that the  Coregonus  of the Central Alps is made up 
of a highly diverse set of populations that show a high level 
of genetic differentiation. They suggest that these populations 
should be considered as “evolutionarily significant units.” They 
further  conclude  that  the  distinctiveness  of  local    Coregonus  
populations is sufficient so that they should be managed as sep-
arate units. Douglas and Brunner recommend that   Coregonus  
should not be moved from one lake basin to another. 

 Studies  of  plants  and  animals  have  repeatedly  demon-
strated  genetic  variation  in  populations.  Such  genetic  varia-
tion  is  required  for  evolutionary  change.  However,  in  order 
to better understand how populations can evolve, we need to 
first understand some aspects of the genetics of populations, 
or     population genetics    .  The theoretical foundations of popu-
lation genetics were established early in the twentieth century 
by two investigators named Hardy and Weinberg.

  4.2  Hardy-Weinberg Principle 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 4.6  Outline the Hardy-Weinberg principle and genetic drift.
 4.7  Distinguish between allele and genotype frequencies.
 4.8  Discuss the conditions required to achieve Hardy-

Weinberg equilibrium in a population.

   The  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  model  helps  identify 
evolutionary  forces  that  can  change  gene  frequencies  in 
populations.   We defined evolution as a change in a popula-
tion over time. Since evolution ultimately involves changes in 
the frequency of heritable traits in a population, we can define 
evolution more precisely as a change in gene frequencies in a 
population. Therefore, a thorough understanding of evolution 
must include some knowledge of population genetics. Though 
Mendel  is  not  generally  credited  with  studying  the  genetics 
of populations, he included a population level analysis in his 
paper on inheritance in garden peas (Mendel 1866). In a sec-
tion of this paper titled, “The Subsequent Generations from the 
Hybrids,”  Mendel  demonstrated  mathematically  that  if  self-
fertilization was the only form of fertilization in a population 
consisting  of  three  genotypes,   AA   (homozygous  dominant), 
 Aa   (heterozygous),  and   aa   (homozygous  recessive),  present 
in a ratio of one  AA  individual : two  Aa  individuals : one  aa
individual, the frequency of homozygous recessive ( aa ), and 
homozygous  dominant  ( AA )  individuals  would  increase  in 
the population. Mendel did not consider what would happen 
to gene frequencies in his theoretical population if breeding 
occurred through something other than self-fertilization. Still, 
his  analysis  anticipated  the  field  of  population  genetics,  the 
foundations of which would be laid 42 years later.  

   Calculating Gene Frequencies 
 Consider  a  population  of Asian  lady  beetles  of  the  species 
 Harmonia axyridis.   Harmonia  populations generally include 
a great deal of variation in color pattern on the wing covers, 
or elytra, and over 200 color variants are known. Many color 
forms are so distinctive that early taxonomists described them 
as different species or even different genera. Genetists in the 
first half of the twentieth century, especially Chia-Chen Tan 
and  Ju-Chi  Li  (1934,  1946)  and  Theodosius  Dobzhansky 
(1937), determined that the variation in color patterns shown 
by  Harmonia  is due to the effects of more than a dozen alter-
native alleles for color pattern. The phenotypic expressions of 
two of those alleles are shown in  figure 4.7 . The homozygous 
“19-signata” genotype of  Harmonia,  which we can represent 
as   SS,   has  orange  elytra  with  several  black  spots,  while  the 
homozygous “aulica” genotype, represented here as  AA,  has 
elytra with prominent black borders and a large oval area of 
orange. Tan and Li, who did extensive breeding experiments 
using   Harmonia   that  they  collected  in  Southwestern  China, 
found that crosses between 19-signata and aulica genotypes 
produce  heterozygous  offspring,  indicated  here  as   SA,   with 
a color pattern that includes elements of both the 19-signata

Inheritance of color patterns in the Asian lady beetle,

genetics and natural selection (after Dobzhansky 1937 and Tan 1946).  

and  the  aulica  parental  forms.  One  of  the  convenient  fea-
tures of knowing so much about color pattern inheritance in 
Harmonia  is that color pattern can be used to determine the 
genotypes of many individuals. 

 Now suppose that you sampled the genotypes of  Harmo-
nia  in a tract of forest in Asia and found that the frequency of 
beetles with genotype  SS  is 0.81 (81%), the frequency of the 
SA  genotype is 0.18 (18%), and the frequency of the  AA  geno-
type is 0.01 (1%). What is the frequency of the  S  and  A  alleles 
in this population? The frequency in the  S  allele is:
2 (Frequency of SA)

Frequency of SS 1 1__

5 0.81 1 1__

2 (0.18) 5 0.81 1 0.09 5 0.90

The frequency of the  A  allele is:
Frequency of AA 1 1__

2 (Frequency of SA)

5 0.01 1 1__

2 (0.18) 5 0.01 1 0.09 5 0.10

These calculations show that the frequency of the  S  allele in 
this lady beetle population is 0.90, while the frequency of the 
A  allele is 0.10. 

 Evolutionary  ecologists  are  interested  in  knowing  what 
factors  may  change  allele  frequencies  in  a  population  such 
as  that  of  our  hypothetical  population  of   Harmonia.   Those 
factors,  which  we  can  consider  as  evolutionary  forces,  are 
revealed  indirectly  by  the   Hardy-Weinberg  principle  .   The 
Hardy-Weinberg principle states that in a population mating 
at  random  in  the  absence  of  evolutionary  forces,  allele  fre-
quencies will remain constant. 

 Let us review how random mating will influence gene fre-
quencies in the  Harmonia  beetle population we just reviewed. 

84 

Section I 

  Natural History and Evolution

Assuming equal fertility of the  SS, SA,  and  AA  genotypes, the 
proportion of  S  and  A  alleles in the population, 0.9 and 0.1, are 
also the proportions of eggs and sperm carrying the two alleles. 
With random mating, the probability that any two alleles will 
be paired in a zygote is determined by the frequency of the 
alleles in our hypothetical population as follows:

   Proportion of matings that will pair an  S  sperm 

with an  S  egg  5  0.9  3  0.9  5  0.81,  

  Proportion of matings that will pair an  S  sperm 

with an  A  egg  5  0.9  3  0.1  5  0.09,  

  Proportion of matings that will pair an  A  sperm 

with an  S  egg  5  0.1  3  0.9  5  0.09,   

and

   Proportion of matings that will pair an  A  sperm 

with an  A  egg  5  0.1  3  0.1  5  0.01.   

The proportion of the three genotypes produced by this ran-
dom mating will be:  SS   5  0.81,  SA   5  0.09  1  0.09  5  0.18, 
and  AA   5  0.01. Notice that the proportions of these genotypes 
in the parents and offspring in the population are the same. 
If  you  calculate  the      allele  frequencies     from  the  genotype 
frequencies in the offspring you will find that they remain at 
 S   5  0.90 and  A   5  0.10, which is what the Hardy-Weinberg 
principle predicts when mating in a population is random. 

 We  can  represent  these  relationships  in  a  more  general 
way using some basic algebra, if we let  p  equal the frequency 
of one allele and  q  the frequency of the second allele. In the 
case  of  the   Harmonia   example  just  discussed,  let   p    5   the 
 frequency  of  the   S   allele  and   q    5   the  frequency  of  the   A  
allele. Expressing these frequencies in numbers,  p   5  0.90 and 
 q    5   0.10.  For  a  population  in  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium 
in a situation where there are only two alleles at a particular 
locus,  p   1   q   5  1.0. Again referring to the  Harmonia  exam-
ple,  p   1   q   5  0.90  1  0.10  5  1.0. Using this relationship we 
can  calculate  the  frequency  of  genotypes  in  a  population  in 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium as:

(p 1 q)2 5 (p 1 q) 3 (p 1 q) 5 p2 1 2pq 1 q2 5 1.0

The result of this calculation is:

(0.90)2 1 2(0.90 3 0.10) 1 (0.10)2 5 0.81

1 0.18 1 0.01 5 1.0

According to this equation, the frequencies of the genotypes 
in our hypothetical  Harmonia  population are:

    p  2   5  (0.90) 2   5  0.81  5  frequency of the  SS  genotype,  

2pq 5 2(0.90 3 0.10)

5 0.18 5 frequency of the SA genotype, 

and

q2 5 (0.10)2 5 0.01 5 frequency of the AA genotype.

These calculations are equivalent to the combining of alleles 
that  would  occur  if  individuals  in  the   Harmonia   population 
mated  at  random.  The  mathematics  of  the  Hardy-Weinberg 
model are further dissected in  figure 4.8 . 

For a population in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium, in which there are only

two alleles at a particular locus,

p = frequency or proportion of one allele, e.g., S, in the population,

q = frequency, or proportion, of the alternative allele, e.g., A,

and

and

Frequency    Frequency

of S             of A

p + q = 1.0

The sum of p and q
must equal 1.0 since
there are only two
alleles at this locus.

The frequency of genotypes

in a randomly mating population
in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

can be calculated as:

Squaring p + q is
analogous to allowing
random mating among
individuals carrying
alleles S and A at
frequencies p and q.

(p + q)2 =

(p + q) 3 (p + q) = p2 + pq + pq + q2

p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.0

The result of this
calculation gives
the frequency of 
genotypes in the 
population.

  Figure 4.8    Anatomy of a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation.  

 In the equations we just explored, random mating is suf-
ficient  to  maintain  constant  genotype  and  allele  frequencies. 
However, Hardy pointed out in his 1908 paper that in natural 
populations, other conditions are also required to maintain con-
stant  allele  frequencies.  For  instance,  Hardy  recognized  that 
nonrandom mating or differences in fertility among genotypes 
can change allele frequencies in a population. The conditions 
necessary to maintain constant allele frequencies in a popula-
tion, what is called Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, are as follows:

     1.   Random  mating.   Nonrandom  or  preferential  mating,  in 
which the probability of pairing alleles is either greater or 
lower than would be expected based on their frequency in 
the population, can change the frequency of genotypes.  
    2.   No mutations.  Mutations that add new alleles to the pop-
ulation or change an allele from one form to another have 
the potential to change allele frequencies in a population 
and therefore disrupt Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  

    3.   Large  population  size.   Small  population  size  increases 
the  probability  that  allele  frequencies  will  change  from 
one  generation to the next due to chance alone. Change 
in  allele  frequencies  due  to  chance  or  random  events 
is  called      genetic  drift    .   Genetic  drift  reduces  genetic

variation in populations over time by increasing the fre-
quency  of  some  alleles  and  reducing  the  frequency  or 
eliminating other alleles.  

    4.   No immigration.  Immigration can introduce new alleles 
into a population or, because allele frequencies are dif-
ferent among immigrants, alter the frequency of existing 
alleles.  In  either  case  immigration  will  disrupt  Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium.  

    5.   All genotypes have equal fitness, where fitness is the genetic 
contribution of individuals to future generations.  If differ-
ent genotypes survive and reproduce at different rates, then 
gene and genotype frequencies will change in populations.    

 Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  requires  that  all  five  of 
these conditions be met. How likely is it that all the conditions 
required  for  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  will  be  present  in  a 
natural population? In places and at times the conditions appear 
to be present. However, it is very likely that one or more of these 
conditions will not be met and allele frequencies will change. 
While at first thought it may not appear that the Hardy-Weinberg 
principle is an important contribution to biology, it is in fact very 
important.  By  carefully  identifying  the  highly  restrictive  con-
ditions under which evolution is not expected, the analysis by 
Hardy and Weinberg leads us to conclude that the potential for 
evolutionary change in natural populations is often very great. 

 In  the  remaining  sections  of  chapter  4  we  will  discuss 
examples in which one or more of the conditions for Hardy-
Weinberg  equilibrium  have  not  been  met  and  where  evolu-
tionary change has occurred in populations as a consequence. 
We begin this discussion with a general overview of the pro-
cess of natural selection. 

  Concept 4.2 Review 

      1.   Why is genetic drift more probable in small populations 

than in large populations?  

     2.   How  does  highly  selective  mating  by  females  (for 
example,  see  fig.  8.10)  affect  the  potential  for  Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium?  

    3.  How  might  immigration  oppose  the  effects  of  genetic 

drift on genetic diversity in a small population?       

  4.3  The Process of Natural Selection 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 4.9  Discuss the concept of fitness.
 4.10  Outline the processes of stabilizing, directional, and 

disruptive selection.

 4.11  Explain how ongoing stabilizing selection can 

work against change in a population.

   Natural selection is differential survival and reproduction 
among phenotypes.   As we saw in the introduction to chap-
ter 4, Darwin was one of the first to recognize the biological 
significance  of  variation  among  individuals  in  a  population. 

He  pointed  out  that  the  phenotypic  characteristics  of  some 
individuals,  for  instance,  larger  or  smaller  size  or  higher  or 
lower  metabolic  rate,  would  result  in  higher  rates  of  repro-
duction and survival compared to other individuals with other 
phenotypic characteristics. (Such traits, unlike the traits stud-
ied by Mendel in his garden peas, are generally determined 
by the effects of many genes and are therefore referred to as 
polygenic traits.) In other words, some individuals in a popu-
lation,  because  of  their  phenotypic  characteristics,  produce 
more offspring that themselves live to reproduce. 

 While  the  basic  concept  of  natural  selection  is  easy 
enough to grasp, natural selection does not take the same form 
everywhere and at all times. Rather, natural selection can act 
against  different  segments  of  the  population  under  different 
circumstances and can produce quite different results. Natu-
ral selection can lead to change in populations but it can also 
serve as a conservative force, impeding change in a population. 
Natural selection can increase diversity within a population or 
decrease diversity. Let’s begin our discussion of natural selec-
tion with a process that conserves population characteristics.  

  Stabilizing Selection 
 One of the conclusions that we might draw from the discussion 
of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model is that most popula-
tions have a high potential for evolutionary change. However, 
our observations of the natural world suggest that species can 
remain little changed generation after generation. If the poten-
tial for evolutionary change is high in populations, why does 
it not always lead to obvious evolutionary change? There are 
many reasons for apparent absence of change in populations. 
For example, one form of natural selection, called     stabilizing 
selection    ,  can act to impede changes in populations. 

 Stabilizing selection acts against extreme phenotypes and 
as  a  consequence  favors  the  average  phenotype.  One  com-
mon  characteristic  of  polygenic  traits  is  that  their  variation 
often  follows  the  familiar  bell-shaped  or  “normal”  curve. 
 Figure  4.9  a   pictures  stabilizing  selection,  using  a  normal 
distribution (see chapter 19, p. 423) of body size. Under the 
influence of stabilizing selection, individuals of average size 
have higher survival and reproductive rates, while the largest 
and  smallest  individuals  in  the  population  have  lower  rates 
of  survival  and  reproduction.  In  other  words,  under  condi-
tions of stabilizing selection, average individuals have higher 
Darwinian  or  evolutionary      fitness     compared  to  individu-
als  with  extreme  phenotypes.  Fitness  can  be  defined  as  the 
number of offspring, or genes, contributed by an individual to 
future generations. As a consequence of stabilizing selection, 
a population tends to sustain the same phenotype over time. 
Stabilizing  selection  occurs  where  average  individuals  in  a 
population  are  best  adapted  to  a  given  set  of  environmental 
conditions. If a population is well adapted to a given set of 
environmental circumstances, stabilizing selection may main-
tain  the  match  between  prevailing  environmental  conditions 
and the average phenotype within a population. However, sta-
bilizing  selection  for  a  particular  trait  can  be  challenged  by 
environmental  change.  In  the  face  of  environmental  change 
the dominant form of selection may be directional.

  Figure 4.9    Three principal forms of natural selection: ( a ) stabilizing selection, ( b ) directional selection, and ( c ) disruptive selection.  

  Directional Selection 
 If we examine the fossil record or trace the history of well-
studied populations over time, we can find many examples of 
how populations have changed over time. For instance, there 
have been remarkable changes in body size or body propor-
tions in many evolutionary lineages. Such changes may be the 
result of     directional selection    .  

 Directional  selection  favors  an  extreme  phenotype  over 
other phenotypes in the population.  Figure 4.9  b  presents an 
example  of  directional  selection,  again,  using  a  normal  dis-
tribution  of  body  size.  In  this  hypothetical  situation,  larger 
individuals  in  the  population  realize  higher  rates  of  sur-
vival and reproduction, while average and small individuals 
have  lower  rates  of  survival  and  reproduction. As  a  conse-
quence of these differences in survival and reproduction, the 

average phenotype changes over time. In the example shown 
in   figure 4.9  b,  average body size increases with time. Direc-
tional  selection  occurs  where  one  extreme  phenotype  has 
an  advantage  over  all  other  phenotypes.  However,  there  are 
 circumstances  in  which  more  than  one  extreme  phenotype 
may have an advantage over the average phenotype. Such a 
circumstance can lead to diversification within a population.  

  Disruptive Selection 
 There are populations that do not show a normal distribution 
of characteristics such as body size. In a normal distribution 
such  as  those  depicted  in   figures  4.9  a   and  4.9 b,   there  is  a 
single peak, which coincides with the population mean. That 
is, the average phenotype in the population is the most com-
mon and all other phenotypes are less common. However, in 

 

Chapter 4

some populations there may be two or more common pheno-
types.  In  many  animal  species,  for  example,  males  may  be 
of two or more discrete sizes. For example, it appears that in 
some animal populations small and large males have higher 
reproductive success than males of intermediate body size. In 
such populations, natural selection seems to have produced a 
diversity of male sizes. One way to produce such diversity is 
through     disruptive selection    .  

 Disruptive  selection  favors  two  or  more  extreme  phe-
notypes  over  the  average  phenotype  in  a  population.  In   fig-
ure 4.9  c,  individuals of average body size have lower rates of 
survival and reproduction than individuals of either larger or 
smaller body. As a consequence, both smaller and larger indi-
viduals increase in frequency in the population over time. The 
result is a distribution of body sizes among males in the popu-
lation with two peaks. That is, the population has many large 
males and many small males but few of intermediate body size. 
  Figures  4.9  b   and  4.9 c   indicate  change  in  the  frequen-
cies of phenotypes in the two hypothetical populations after a 
period of natural selection. This change depends on the extent 
to which genes determine the phenotype upon which natural 
selection acts. This dependence is the focus of the discussion 
of Concept 4.4. 

  Concept 4.3 Review 

1.   If you observe no changes in gene frequencies in a pop-
ulation over several generations, can you conclude that 
the population is not subject to natural selection?  

     2.   Why is rapid, human-induced environmental change a 

threat to natural populations?

After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 4.12  Define heritability.
 4.13  Discuss examples of stabilizing, directional, and 
disruptive selection that have been documented in 
natural populations.

 4.14  Explain why a trait that is not heritable cannot evolve.

   A  large  and  rapidly  growing  body  of  research  on  natu-
ral populations provides robust support for the theory of 
evolution  by  natural  selection.   The  most  general  postu-
late of the theory of natural selection is that the environment 
determines  the  evolution  of  the  anatomy,  physiology,  and 
behavior of organisms. This is what Darwin surmised as he 
studied  variation among populations and species in different 
environments.  Darwin  was  keenly  aware,  however,  that  the 
only way natural selection can produce evolutionary change 
in a population is if the phenotypic traits upon which natural 
selection acts can be passed from generation to generation. In 
other words, evolution by natural selection depends upon the 
heritability of traits.  

   Heritability: Essential for Evolution 
We can define     heritability    of a trait—usually symbolized as 
h 2 —in  a  broad  sense  as  the  proportion  of  total  phenotypic 
variation in a trait, such as body size or pigmentation, that is 
attributable to genetic variance. In equation form, heritability 
can be expressed as:

h2 5 VG / VP

Here, V G  represents genetic variance and V P  represents pheno-
typic  variance.  (We  review  how  to  calculate  variance  here  in 
chapter 4, p. 88.) Many different factors contribute to the amount 
of phenotypic variance in a population. We will subdivide phe-
notypic variance into only two components: variance in pheno-
type due to genetic effects, V G , and variance in phenotype due 
to environmental effects on the phenotype, V E . Subdividing V P
in the heritability equation given above produces the following:

h2 5 VG /(VG 1 VE)

 Since  this  highly  simplified  expression  for  heritability  has 
important  implications,  let’s  examine  it.  First,  consider  envi-
ronmental variance, V E . Environment has substantial effects on 
many aspects of the phenotype of organisms. For instance, the 
quality of food eaten by an animal can contribute significantly 
to the growth rate of the animal and to its eventual size. Simi-
larly, the amount of light, nutrients, temperature, and so forth 
affect the growth form and size of plants. So, when we consider 
a population of plants or animals, some of the phenotype that 
we might measure will be the result of environmental effects, 
that  is,  V E .  (The  extent  that  the  environment  can  influence 
variation in phenotype is called  phenotypic plasticity,  a concept 
introduced earlier in this chapter [see p. 80].) However, we are 
just as familiar with the influence of genes on phenotype. For 
example, some of the variation in stature that we see in a popu-
lation of animals or plants will generally result from genetic 
variation among individuals in the population, that is, V G . 

 What our equation says is that the heritability of a partic-
ular trait depends on the relative sizes of genetic versus envi-
ronmental variance. Heritability increases with increased V G
and decreases with increased V E . Imagine a situation in which 
all  phenotypic  variation  is  the  result  of  genetic  differences 
between  individuals  and  none  results  from  environmental 
effects. In such a situation, V E  is zero and h 2   5  V G  /(V G   1  V E ) 
is  equal  to  h 2    5   V G  / V G   (since V E    5   0),  which  equals  1.0. 
In  this  case  since  all  phenotypic  variation  is  due  to  genetic 
effects, the trait is perfectly heritable. We can also imagine the 
opposite circumstance in which none of the phenotypic varia-
tion that we observe is due to genetic effects. In this case, V G  
is zero and so the expression h 2   5  V G  /(V G   1  V E ) also equals 
zero. Because all of the phenotypic variation we observe in 
this population is due to environmental effects, natural selec-
tion  cannot  produce  evolutionary  change  in  the  population. 
Generally,  heritability  of  traits  falls  somewhere  in  between 
these extremes in the very broad region where both environ-
ment and genes contribute to the phenotypic variance shown 
by a population. For instance, a study of morphological varia-
tion  in  the  water  lily  leaf  beetle,  a  team  of  Dutch  scientists 
(Pappers  et  al.  2002)  found  that  body  length  and  mandible

 Variation in Data 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 4.15  Describe the range of a sample.
 4.16  Calculate a sample variance and standard deviation.
 4.17  Discuss why, compared to the sample range, the 
standard deviation generally gives a better repre-
sentation of variation in a sample.

 In chapter 2 we calculated the sample mean and in chapter 3 
we determined the sample median. The mean and median are 
different ways of representing the middle, or typical, within 
a sample of a population. Another important question we can 
ask is, how much  variation  is there around the average? This 
is  important  for  several  reasons.  For  example,  two  or  more 
samples  may  have  the  same  mean  but  have  quite  different 
amounts  of  variation  among  the  observations  within  each 
sample.  Knowing  the  variation  within  samples,  as  well  as 
their means or medians, is critical to comparing them statisti-
cally (see “Investigating the Evidence” 17 and 18). 

 Suppose you are studying a population of whitefish liv-
ing in Lake Lucerne, Switzerland (see  fig. 4.5 , p. 82) and, as 
part of the study, you need to estimate the variation in length 
of  a  small  sample  of  young  whitefish  taken  from  the  lake. 
Here are your measurements:

 The simplest index of variation would be the    range    ,  which is 
the  difference  between  the  largest  and  the  smallest  observa-
tion. In this case the range would be:

Range 5 62 2 41 5 21 mm

The range does not represent variation in samples well, since 
very different sets of observations can have the same range. A 
better representation of the variation in a sample is one that 
factors  in  all  the  observations  relative  to  the  sample  mean. 
One such index that is most commonly used is called the sam-
ple    variance    .  The variance is calculated as follows: 

First we calculate the sample mean as we did in chapter 2.

 X  5  56.2 mm (For practice you could calculate this sample 

mean using the data given above.)

The variance is calculated by squaring the differences between 
the sample mean and each of the observations, adding them 
up to produce the “sum of squares,” and dividing by the sam-
ple size minus 1. Let’s do this in steps. First let’s calculate the 
sum of squares.

width had heritabilities of between 0.53 and 0.83. Now that 
we have established the requirement of heritable variation in 
a trait for its evolution, let’s review studies that have explored 
evolution by natural selection in nature. 

  Stabilizing Selection for Egg Size 
among Ural Owls 
 Egg size, which affects offspring development and survival, 
influences  successful  reproduction  by  organisms  ranging 
from  sea  urchins,  lizards,  and  fishes  to  ostriches.  Egg  size 
can  be  highly  variable  within  populations.  For  example,  in 
a population of birds, the largest eggs produced can be over 
twice the size of the smallest. Pekka Kontiainen, Jon Brom-
mer, Patrik Karell, and Hannu Pietiäinen, of the Bird Ecology 
Unit at the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied heritabil-
ity, phenotypic plasticity, and evolution of egg size in the Ural 
owl,  Strix   uralensis  (Kontiainen et al. 2008). One of their key 
questions was how much of the variation in egg size in their 
study  population  is  the  result  of  genetic  differences  among 
females (heritability) and how much is the result of environ-
mental influences (phenotypic plasticity). 

 The study team conducted their research on Ural owls in 
a 1,500 km 2  area in southern Finland from 1981 to 2005. The 
main prey species for the owls were field voles,  Microtus   agres-
tis,   and  bank  voles,   Clethrionomys    glareolus,   which  undergo 
regular population cycles in the study area, fluctuating in pop-
ulation  density  up  to  50-fold  over  time.  Because  population 
fluctuations  are  not  synchronized  across  large  regions,  some 
owl  species  in  Finland  lead  nomadic  lives,  moving  to  areas 
where vole populations are on the increase and leaving areas 
where they are crashing (see chapter 10, p. 222). In contrast, 
Ural owls, which are monogamous, do not move in response to 
changing prey populations but stay in the pair’s territory. Konti-
ainen and his colleagues describe them as “site tenacious.” 

 During the course of their study, the research team made 
repeated size measurements of eggs laid by 344 female Ural 
owls in 878 clutches containing a total of nearly 3,000 eggs. 
The  great  variation  in  the  owl’s  prey  population  combined 
with  its  site  tenacity  provided  the  research  group  with  the 
opportunity  to  study  the  effects  of  the  environment  versus 
genetics on reproduction, including egg size. Based on mea-
surements of eggs laid by 59 females in three phases of a vole

and dividing,

This,  then,  is  the  sample  variance.  However,  notice  that  the 
units of the sample variance are square mm, not mm. Because 

population cycle (low, increasing, and decreasing) Kontiainen 
and his colleagues estimated that egg size is highly heritable 
in Ural owls, h 2   5  0.60. The finding that egg size is highly 
heritable was a critical element in their study, since it dem-
onstrated  that  the  trait  is  potentially  subject  to  evolution  by 
natural selection. 

 In other parts of the study, the research team explored the 
relationship of egg size to a variety of variables, which led to 
the discovery that egg size in the study population is undergo-
ing stabilizing selection ( fig. 4.10 ). Their results indicated two 
main selective factors: variation in hatching success and pro-
duction of fledgling owls over a female’s lifetime. The results 
showed that very small and very large eggs hatch at a lower 
rate compared to intermediate-sized eggs. Kontiainen and his 
colleagues  also  found  that  females  that  produced  extremely 
small or large eggs produced fewer fledglings over the course 
of their lives, mainly because females producing eggs at the 
extremes of the size distribution had shorter reproductive lives. 
The result of these combined effects is stabilizing selection for 
egg size in this population of Ural owls. Elsewhere, ecologists 
have demonstrated directional selection in populations. 

the  sample  variance  is  expressed  in  squares  of  the  original 
units,  generally  we  take  the  square  root  of  the  variance  to 
calculate a measure of variation called the sample    standard 
deviation    .

While it took a little effort to calculate it, the standard devia-

variation in length of the fish used in your study. Fortunately, 
most electronic calculators make these calculations automati-
cally, once the data are entered. The sample standard devia-
tion along with the sample mean enable us to make statistical 
comparisons of samples. 

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  4 
     1.  Why  do  the  standard  deviation  and  variance  generally 

represent variation in a sample better than the range?  

    2.  Can samples drawn from two different populations have 
approximately  the  same  mean  (e.g.,  body  weight)  yet 
have different variances? Why?     

    Directional Selection: Adaptation by 
Soapberry Bugs to New Host Plants 
 As  discussed  in  chapter  7  (see  p.  157),  herbivores  must 
overcome a wide variety of physical and chemical defenses 
evolved by plants. As a consequence, plants exert strong selec-
tion on herbivore physiology, behavior, and anatomy. While 
herbivore adaptation to plant defenses are generally inferred 
from the juxtaposition of plant defenses and herbivore char-
acteristics, few studies have documented the process of herbi-
vore adaptation. A notable exception is provided by studies of 
the soapberry bug and its evolution on new host plants. 

 The soapberry bug,  Jadera haematoloma,  feeds on seeds 
produced  by  plants  of  the  family  Sapindaceae.  Soapberry 
bugs use their slender beaks to pierce the walls of the fruits of 
their host plants. To allow the bug to feed on the seeds within 
the fruit, the beak must be long enough to reach from the exte-
rior of the fruit to the seeds. The distance from the outside of 
the fruit wall to the seeds varies widely among potential host 
species. Thus,  beak  length  should  be  under  strong  selection 
for appropriate length.

 Scott Carroll and Christin Boyd (1992) reviewed the his-
tory and biogeography of the colonization of new host plants 
by soapberry bugs. Historically, soapberry bugs fed on three 
main host plants in the family Sapindaceae: the soapberry tree, 
 Sapindus saponaria  v.  drummondii,  in the south central region 
of the United States; the serjania vine,  Serjania brachycarpa,  
in  southern  Texas;  and  the  balloon  vine,    Cardiospermum 
corindum,  in southern Florida. During the second half of the 
twentieth century, three additional species of the plant family 
Sapindaceae  were  introduced  to  the  southern  United  States. 
The  round-podded  golden  rain  tree,   Koelreuteria  panicu-
lata  from East Asia, and the flat-podded golden rain tree,  K. 
 elegans   from  Southeast Asia,  are  both  planted  as  ornamen-
tals,  while  the  subtropical  heartseed  vine,   Cardiospermum 
halicacabum,  has invaded Louisiana and Mississippi. At some 
point  after  the  introduction  of  these  plants,  some  soapberry 
bugs shifted from their native host plants and began feeding 
on these exotic species. 

 Carroll and Boyd were particularly interested in determin-
ing whether the beak length had changed in the soapberry bugs 
that shifted from native to introduced host plants.   Figure 4.11  
contrasts the fruit radius of native and introduced host plants 
in Florida and the south central United States. In Florida the 
fruit of the native host plant  C. corindum  has a much larger 
radius than the fruit of the introduced  K. elegans  (11.92 mm 
versus 2.82 mm). In the south central United States soapberry 
bugs shifting to introduced host plants faced the opposite situ-
ation. There, the fruit of the native  S. saponaria  has a smaller 
radius (6.05 mm) than the fruits of the introduced  K. panicu-
lata  (7.09 mm) and  C. halicacabum  (8.54 mm). 

 Carroll and Boyd reasoned that if beak length was under 
natural selection to match the radius of host plant fruits, bugs

shifting to the introduced plants in Florida should be selected 
for  reduced  beak  length,  while  those  shifting  to  introduced 
hosts  in  the  south  central  United  States  should  be  selected 
for longer beaks.  Figure 4.12  shows the relationship between 
soapberry  beak  length  and  the  radius  of  fruits  of  their  host 
plants. As  you  can  see,  there  is  a  close  correlation  between 
fruit radius and beak length. 

 At  this  point  we  should  ask  whether  the  differences  in 
beak length observed by Carroll and Boyd might be develop-
mental responses to the different host plants. In other words, 
are the differences in beak length due to genetic differences 
among  populations  of  soapberry  bugs  or  are  they  the  result 
of phenotypic plasticity? Fortunately, Carroll reared juvenile 
bugs from the various populations on alternative host plants 
so we can answer this question. As it turns out, the differences 
in beak length observed in the field among bugs feeding on 
the  various  native  and  introduced  host  plants  were  retained 
in  bugs  that  developed  on  alternative  hosts.  Here  we  have 
evidence for a genetic basis for interpopulational differences 
among soapberry bugs. Consequently, we can conclude that

the  differences  in  beak  length  documented  by  Carroll  and 
Boyd were likely the result of natural selection for increased 
or  decreased  beak  length.  The  basis  for  this  evolutionary 
change  was  confirmed  when  Carroll  and  colleagues  (2001) 
demonstrated  that  beak  length  is  highly  heritable,  with  h 2  
averaging approximately 0.60. 

 Scott Carroll, Stephen Klassen, and Hugh Dingle (1997, 
1998)  have  done  extensive  additional  studies  of  soapberry 
bugs  that  document  substantial  genetic  differences  between 
populations  living  on  native  versus  introduced  plants  in  the 
family  Sapindaceae.  Significantly,  from  the  perspective  of 
natural  selection,  the  differences  between  these  populations 
of  soapberry  bugs  are  great  enough  that  both  show  reduced 
reproduction and survival when forced to live on the alterna-
tive host plants. That is, when soapberry bugs that normally 
live  on  native  host  plants  are  moved  to  introduced  plants, 
their  survival  and  reproductive  rates  decrease.  Similarly, 
when soapberry bugs that now live on introduced plants are 
moved to native plants, which their ancestors fed on only 30 
to  100  years  ago,  their  reproductive  and  survival  rates  also 
decrease.  Clearly,  soapberry  bugs  have  undergone  natural 
selection for traits that favor their survival and reproduction 
on their specific plant hosts, whether native or introduced. 

  Disruptive Selection in a Population 
of Darwin’s Finches 
 As  we  have  seen,  the  Galápagos  Islands  and  their  inhabi-
tants played a key role in the development of Darwin’s theory 
of  evolution  by  natural  selection.  Darwin  was  particularly 
impressed by the variation in a group of 14 bird species now 
most commonly known as “Darwin’s finches,” or, less com-
monly,  as  “Galápagos  finches.”  In  the  second  edition  of  his 
journal recording his voyage on the  Beagle  (Darwin 1842a), 
Darwin suggests the influence of these birds on his thinking, 
“The most curious fact is the perfect gradation in the size of

the  beaks  of  the  different  species  of   Geospiza   [a  genus  of 
Darwin’s  finches]—Seeing  this  gradation  and  diversity  of 
structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one 
might really fancy that, from an original paucity of birds in 
this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for 
different ends.” 

 Darwin’s  musing  anticipated  the  great  contribution 
made  by  studies  of  his  finches  to  our  understanding  of  the 
evolutionary  process.  For  instance,  studies  of  the  variation 
in beak size that caught Darwin’s attention have revealed the 
importance  of  this  trait  to  the  feeding  ecology  of  Darwin’s 
finches. For instance, among species in the genus  Geospiza,  
those with larger beaks are able to crack and feed on larger 
seeds  (see  chapter  13,  p.  287).  Studies  of  variation  in  beak 
size in populations of the medium ground finch,  Geospiza   for-
tis,  have produced many notable discoveries. In a pioneering 
study of  G.   fortis,  Peter Boag and Peter Grant (1978) showed 
that beak length, depth, and width are highly heritable, with 
heritability values of 0.62, 0.82, and 0.95, respectively. With 
this demonstration of heritability, Boag and Grant established 
a foundation for future evolutionary studies of beak size and 
form among Darwin’s finches. 

 A recent study of  G.   fortis  provides one of the clearest 
and most complete examples of disruptive selection in a natu-
ral population. Andrew Hendry, Sarah Huber, Luis de León, 
Anthony  Herrel,  and  Jeffrey  Podos  (2009)  discovered  that 
the  G.   fortis  population at El Garrapatero, Santa Cruz Island, 
Galápagos  is  dominated  by  two  distinctive  groups  of  indi-
viduals:  those  with  small  beaks  and  those  with  large  beaks 
( fig.  4.13 ).  Meanwhile,   G.    fortis   with  intermediate-sized 
beaks are relatively uncommon at El Garrapatero. Hendry and 
his  colleagues  uncovered  the  influences  of  disruptive  selec-
tion  in  producing  this  distribution  of  beak  sizes,  when  their 
studies revealed higher mortality, or possibly higher emigra-
tion,  of  birds  with  mid-sized  beaks  in  this  population.  The 
researchers  proposed  that  this  higher  mortality/emigration 
might  be  the  result  of  either  a  lack  of  appropriate  food  for 
these birds and/or competition with the more abundant small- 
and large-beaked individuals in the population. 

 Ongoing  studies  have  revealed  important  biological 
details, including the finding that disruptive selection on beak 
size  at  El  Garrapatero  is  reinforced  by  nonrandom  patterns 
of  mate  choice  in  the  population.  Nonrandom  mating  itself 
can  be  a  source  of  evolutionary  change  in  populations  (see 
also chapter 8) because it violates one of the conditions for 
Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (see  p.  84).  Darwin’s  finches 
choose mates at least partly on the basis of beak size and mat-
ing  song.  Since  different  species  of  Darwin’s  finches  have 
beaks  of  different  size  and  shape  and  sing  different  songs, 
individuals  of  different  finch  species  rarely  mate  with  each 
other. The  G.   fortis  at El Garrapatero take this isolation one 
step  further  by  mating  preferentially  within  the  population, 
with  individuals  choosing  mates  with  similar-sized  beaks. 
In  other  words,  individuals  in  the  population  with  small 
beaks mate preferentially with other small-beaked individu-
als,  while  large-beaked  finches  disproportionately  choose

addition,  males  in  the  population  with  different  beak  sizes 
sing distinctive songs, which may reinforce nonrandom mat-
ing (Podos 2010). These recent studies have also shown that 
disruptive selection reinforced by nonrandom mate selection 
has produced genetic differences between small- and large-
beaked  G.   fortis  at El Garrapatero, which further underscores 
the evolutionary divergence between the two dominant beak 
morphs at that site.

your answer.

    3.  There is genetic evidence that mating between  G.   mag-
nirostris  and  G.   fortis  (see fig. 13.8, p. 287) may have 
helped establish sufficient genetic variation in the popu-
lation of  G.   fortis  at El Garrapatero for the distribution 
of beak sizes at that site (see  fig. 4.13 ) to emerge under 
the influence of disruptive selection. Explain.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

associated with loss of genetic diversity.

 4.20  Explain the relationship between inbreeding and 

probability of extinction in populations.

Random processes, such as genetic drift, can change gene 
frequencies  in  populations,  especially  in  small  popula-
tions.   While we may often think of evolutionary change as 
a consequence of predictable forces such as natural selection 
which favors, or disfavors, particular genotypes over others, 
allele  frequencies  can  change  as  a  consequence  of  random 
processes such as genetic drift. Genetic drift is theoretically 
most effective at changing gene frequencies in small popula-
tions such as those that inhabit islands. In the following exam-
ples, we consider the effects of genetic drift in the populations 
on isolated mountaintops and on islands.  

   Evidence of Genetic Drift 
in Chihuahua Spruce 
 One  of  the  greatest  concerns  associated  with  fragmentation 
of  natural  ecosystems  due  to  human  land  use  is  that  reduc-
ing  habitat  availability  will  decrease  the  size  of  animal  and 
plant populations to the point where genetic drift will reduce 
the genetic diversity. Are these concerns well-founded? The 
Hardy-Weinberg principle predicts that small population sizes 
will  be  more  subject  to  genetic  drift  (see  p.  84),  which  can 
result in a loss of genetic variation. 

 Many natural populations have undergone fragmentation 
as a consequence of changing climates and natural habitat frag-
mentation. One of those is the Chihuahua spruce,  Picea chi-
huahuana,  which is now restricted to the peaks of the Sierra 
Madre Occidental in northern Mexico. During the Pleistocene 
glacial period when the global climate was much cooler, spruce 
were found much farther south in Mexico and in more exten-
sive populations. However, following the end of the Pleistocene 
and the onset of the warmer recent, or Holocene period, spruce 
populations moved northward and to higher elevations. Today, 
all spruce populations in Mexico are restricted to small, highly 
fragmented  areas  of  subalpine  environment  in  the  mountains 
in the states of Chihuahua and Durango. On these high moun-
tains, Chihuahua spruce lives in an 800 km long band along 
the crest of the Sierra Madre Occidental at elevations between 
2,200 and 2,700 m. On a local scale, the species is mainly found 
on cooler north-facing slopes along well-watered stream corri-
dors, which are the microclimates where you would expect to 
find the descendants of an ice age relictual population. In these 
mountain  refuges,  Chihuahua  spruce  persists  as  far  south  as 
23   8 30 9  N latitude, just south of the Tropic of Cancer. 

 While the spruce of Durango have not been censused yet, 
all the Chihuahua spruce in the state of Chihuahua have been

located and counted. Local populations of the species range in 
size from 15 to 2,441 individuals. This situation presents itself 
as  a  natural  experiment  on  the  effects  of  population  size  and 
habitat  fragmentation  on  genetic  diversity  in  populations.  The 
opportunity for such studies was pursued by a joint team of U.S. 
and  Mexican  scientists  (Ledig  et  al.  1997).  F.  Thomas  Ledig 
and Paul D. Hodgskiss from the USDA Forest Service and Vir-
ginia Jacob-Cervantes and Teobaldo Eguiluz-Piedra of the Uni-
versidad Autonoma of Chapingo, Mexico, combined efforts to 
determine whether Chihuahua spruce has lost genetic diversity 
as a consequence of reduced population size following climatic 
warming after the end of the last ice age. They were also inter-
ested in whether reduced genetic diversity may be contributing to 
continuing decline of the species and its potential for extinction. 
 Ledig  and  his  colleagues  were  particularly  interested  in 
the relationship between genetic diversity and population size. 
They  used  a  technique  called  starch  gel  electrophoresis  to 
determine the number of alleles present for 16 enzyme systems. 
Enzymes are, of course, gene products, and greater numbers of 
the various forms of an enzyme, which are called     allozymes    ,  
indicate higher levels of genetic diversity in a population. The 
team assayed allozyme diversity for 24 genes, or     loci    ,  in seven 
populations ranging in size from 17 to 2,441 individuals. 

 Ledig  and  his  colleagues  found  a  significant  positive 
correlation  between  population  size  and  genetic  diversity  of 
their study populations.  Figure 4.14  indicates that the smallest 
populations of Chihuahua spruce have much lower levels of 
genetic diversity than the largest populations. These results are 
consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which predicts 
that genetic drift will be most important in small populations. 
 How might drift occur in populations of spruce living on 
isolated mountain peaks in western Mexico and how might 
genetic drift reduce genetic variation in spruce populations? 
Imagine a population of 15 Chihuahua spruce on a mountain 
peak in the Sierra Madre Occidental at the beginning of July

when the summer rains begin. The forest is dry after a long 
spring drought and as the lightning produced by a thunder-
storm begins to strike the mountain, one bolt hits one of the 
spruce trees. The tree explodes as its interior water is turned 
into superheated steam, sending showers of splintered wood 
50 m in all directions. The spruce tree then catches fire and 
the  flames  engulf  two  neighboring  spruce  trees  before  the 
ensuing torrential rains put out the fire. The result is a small 
spot fire that has killed three trees. The deaths of three trees 
would make very little difference in a population of several 
thousand. However, in a population of just 15, three trees rep-
resent 20% of the individuals. When individuals are removed 
from very small populations their removal often reduces the 
frequency of some alleles; such events will eventually elimi-
nate some alleles entirely from a small population. 

 It  seems  likely  that  genetic  drift  is  changing  allele  fre-
quencies and reducing overall genetic diversity in populations 
of  Chihuahua  spruce.  However,  this  is  one  species  occupy-
ing  relictual  environments  in  one  corner  of  North America. 
Would we see consistent reductions in genetic diversity if we 
examined  a  larger  number  of  populations  inhabiting  insular 
or  fragmented  environments?  The  next  study  addresses  this 
question for both plants and animals.  

  Genetic Variation in Island Populations 
 Richard Frankham (1997) of the Centre for Biodiversity and 
Bioresources  at  Macquarie  University  in  Sydney,   Australia, 
compared the genetic diversity of island and mainland popula-
tions of both animals and plants. His study was motivated by 
the fact that rates of extinction in historic times have been much 
higher  for  island  populations  compared  to  mainland  popula-
tions. Frankham developed the idea that because lower genetic 
variation within a population indicates lower potential for evo-
lutionary responses to environmental challenge, lower genetic 
variation  within  island  populations  may  be  partly  respon-
sible for their greater vulnerability to extinction compared to 
mainland populations. However, when he reviewed what was 
known about the relative genetic variation in island and main-
land populations, he encountered a great deal of uncertainty. 
Frankham undertook his study to fill this information gap. He 
posed two main questions. Do island populations of sexually 
reproducing species have lower genetic variation than compa-
rable mainland populations? Do     endemic    island populations, 
which have lived in isolation on islands long enough to diverge 
substantially  from  mainland  populations,  have  lower  genetic 
variation than nonendemic mainland populations? 

 Frankham  addressed  these  questions  by  thoroughly 
searching  the  extensive  literature  on  genetic  variation  in 
animal  and  plant  populations.  His  research  uncovered 
202 comparisons of genetic diversity in island versus main-
land  populations  and  38  comparisons  of  genetic  diversity 
in  endemic  species  on  islands  versus  related  mainland  spe-
cies populations. The organisms in the analysis ranged from 
moose  and  wolves  to  toads,  insects,  and  trees.  The  results 
of  Frankham’s  analyses  clearly  support  the  hypothesis  that 
genetic  diversity  is  lower  in  island  populations  ( fig.  4.15 ). 

be  eliminated  as  a  contributor  to  the  higher  extinction  rates 
observed on islands. However, while this study keeps genetic 
diversity alive as a viable hypothesis, it does not in itself dem-
onstrate  a  connection  between  extinction  rates  and  genetic 
diversity. That  connection  was  made  in  a  study  published  a 
year after Frankham’s results appeared in print.  

  Genetic Diversity 
and Butterfly Extinctions 
 The landscape of Åland in southwestern Finland is a patch-
work of lakes, wetlands, cultivated fields, pastures, meadows, 
and forest (see fig. 21.12). Here and there in this well-watered 
landscape  you  can  find  dry  meadows  that  support  popula-
tions  of  plants,   Plantago  lanceolata   and   Veronica  spicata,  
that act as hosts for the Glanville fritillary butterfly,   Melitaea 
cinxia   ( fig.  4.17 ). As  discussed  in  chapter  21,  the  meadows 
where  Melitaea  lives vary greatly in size, and  Melitaea  popu-
lation  size  increases  directly  with  the  size  of  meadows  (see 
fig.  21.13).  Careful  studies  of  these  populations  by  Ilkka 
 Hanski,  Mikko  Kuussaari,  and  Marko  Nieminen  (1994) 
showed  that  small  populations  of   Melitaea   living  in  small 
meadows were most likely to go extinct. 

 Several factors likely influence the greater vulnerability 
of small populations to extinction. However, what role might 
genetic factors, especially reduced genetic variation, play in 
the vulnerability of small populations to extinction? Richard 
Frankham  and  Katherine  Ralls  (1998)  point  out  that  one  of 
the contributors to higher extinction rates in small populations 
may  be      inbreeding    .   Inbreeding,  which  is  mating  between 
close relatives, is more likely in small populations. Combin-
ing  already  low  genetic  variation  in  small  populations  with 
a  high  rate  of  inbreeding  has  several  negative  impacts  on 
 populations, including reduced fecundity, lower juvenile sur-
vival, and shortened life span. 

 Ilik Saccheri and five coauthors (1998) reported one of 
the  first  studies  giving  direct  evidence  that  inbreeding  con-
tributes  to  extinctions  in  wild  populations.  Saccheri  and  his 
colleagues studied 1,600 dry meadows and found  Melitaea  in

Generally, genetic

Out of 202 mainland-island comparisons, 165 showed higher 
genetic  variation  in  mainland  populations  compared  to  37 
which indicated higher genetic variation in island populations. 
Frankham found that the trend toward higher genetic variation 
in mainland populations was even stronger when he compared 
island  endemic  populations  versus  mainland  populations  of 
closely related species ( fig. 4.16 ). Out of 38 endemic island-
mainland  comparisons,  34  showed  higher  genetic  variation 
in mainland populations compared to 4 that indicated higher 
genetic variation in endemic island populations. 

 Frankham’s  analysis  takes  us  well  beyond  the  study  of 
how population size is related to genetic variation in popula-
tions of Chihuahua spruce (Ledig et al. 1997). It appears that 
in general, genetic variation is lower in isolated and generally 
smaller,  island  populations.  One  of  Frankham’s  motivations 
for his study was to explore the possibility that lower genetic 
variation  in  island  populations  may  contribute  to  the  higher 
rates  of  extinction  of  island  populations.  By  demonstrat-
ing that island populations have lower genetic variation than 
mainland  populations,  he  shows  that  genetic  factors  cannot 

Mainland populations

than island endemic
populations.

524, 401, 384, and 320 of the meadows in 1993, 1994, 1995, 
and 1996, respectively. Over this period they documented an 
average  of  200  extinctions  and  114  colonizations  of  mead-
ows  annually. As  you  can  see,  these  populations  are  highly 
dynamic. In order to determine the extent that genetic factors, 
especially inbreeding, may contribute to extinctions, Saccheri 
and his colleagues conducted genetic studies on populations 
of   Melitaea   in  42  of  the  meadows.  They  estimated  hetero-
zygosity,  an  indicator  of  genetic  variability,  with  respect  to 
seven enzyme systems and one locus of nuclear microsatellite 
DNA. The researchers used the level of heterozygosity within 
each meadow population as an indicator of inbreeding, with 
low heterozygosity indicating high levels of inbreeding. 

 The  results  of  the  study  indicated  that  influence  of 
inbreeding  on  the  probability  of  extinction  was  very  sig-
nificant. It turned out that the populations with the highest 
levels  of  inbreeding  (lowest  heterozygosity)  had  the  high-
est probabilities of extinction. Saccheri and his colleagues 
found a connection between heterozygosity and extinction 
through effects on larval survival, adult longevity, and egg 
hatching.  Females  with  low  levels  of  heterozygosity  pro-
duced smaller larvae, fewer of which survived to the winter 
dormancy period. Pupae of mothers with low heterozygos-
ity also spent more time in the pupal stage, exposing them 
to  greater  attack  by  parasites.  In  addition,  adult  females 
with  low  heterozygosity  had  lower  survival  and  laid  eggs 
with  a  24%  to  46%  lower  rate  of  hatching.  These  effects 
have  the  potential  to  reduce  the  viability  of  local  popula-
tions of  Melitaea  that are made up of individuals of low het-
erozygosity (low genetic variation) and increase their risk of 
local extinction. 

 We have seen how the small population size and isolation 
can  influence  the  genetic  structure  of  populations  of  many 
kinds of organisms, including the Chihuahua spruce isolated 
in cool, moist microenvironments in the mountains of Mexico 
and the Glanville fritillary,  Melitaea,  in the dry meadow envi-
ronments  of  southwestern  Finland.  In  situations  like  these, 
chance  plays  a  significant  role  in  determining  the  genetic 
structure of populations.

    When  Darwin  published  his  theory  of  evolution  by  natural 
selection, it was met with widespread skepticism. That skep-
ticism  continues,  in  some  segments  of  society,  to  this  day. 
Ironically, for thousands of years before Darwin’s nineteenth-
century proposal, humans had been the architects of evolution-
ary change in populations through selective breeding. Darwin 
was  keenly  aware  of  this  fact.  He  used  the  term       artificial 
selection    ,   as  opposed  to  “natural”  selection,  when  referring 
to the selective breeding techniques used to develop or main-
tain desirable traits in domesticated plants and animals. It was 
through the process of artificial selection that animal and plant 
breeders have produced thousands of varieties of domesticated 
plants  and  animals  from  wild  ancestors.    Figure  4.18   illus-
trates some of the significant changes resulting from artificial

selection during domestication of the soybean,  Glycine max,  
from  wild  ancestors.  Darwin  viewed  artificial  selection  as  a 
human-guided  analog  of  natural  selection.  Consequently,  he 
intensively studied selective breeding and variation in domes-
ticated plants and animals as he  developed his theory of natural 
selection. He even wrote a book on the subject:  The Variation 
of Animals and Plants Under Domestication  (Darwin 1868). 

 The  production  of  new  varieties  of  plants  and  animals 
continues and may be more intense than ever. Today, the tra-
ditional  selective  breeding  techniques  of  Darwin’s  time  are 
combined  with      genetic  engineering    ,   the  alteration  of  the 
genetic  makeup  of  an  organism  through  the  introduction  or 
deletion  of  genes—for  example,  the  introduction  of  bacte-
rial  genes  into  crop  plants  to  give  them  more  resistance  to 
insect pests. Such organisms are called     genetically modified 
 organisms    ,   or      GMOs    .   However,      agriculture    ,   the  growing 
of crops and livestock for human consumption, also induces 
unintended evolutionary change in wild organisms.  

  Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Weeds 
 As  farmers  create  environmental  conditions  suitable  for  the 
cultivation  of  particular  crops,  they  simultaneously  create 
selection pressures on populations of wild plants and animals 
that live in or near their agricultural fields ( fig. 4.19 ). Some 
of the most powerful of those selective pressures occur when 
farmers attempt to increase crop yields by applying chemical 
poisons to control insect pests or weeds. 

 The poisons used to control weed populations are called 
 herbicides.   The  use  of  herbicides  is  increasing  as  farmers 
shift from mechanical control of weeds, by tilling the soil, to 
chemical control. This shift has been facilitated by the use of 
genetic engineering to develop herbicide-resistant varieties of 

crops,  including  herbicide-resistant  soybeans.  The  weeds  in 
fields  planted  with  genetically  modified,  herbicide-resistant 
soybeans  can  be  controlled  with  herbicides,  in  a  system  of 
cultivation  called  “no-till”  agriculture.  No-till  agriculture 
includes several benefits to the farmer, including reduced pro-
duction  costs,  higher  crop  yields,  reduced  soil  erosion,  and 
better weed control. However, improved weed control through 
the use of herbicides has, in some cases, proved temporary. 

 The  control  of  weeds  with  herbicides  can  be  rendered 
ineffective  by  the  evolution  of  herbicide  resistance  in  weed 
populations. The recent history of soybean farming in Argen-
tina  provides  a  clear  example  of  such  rapid  evolutionary 
change.  Martin  Vila-Aiub  led  a  team  of  Argentinean  and 
Australian scientists investigating the evolution of resistance 
to glyphosate, the world’s most widely used herbicide, com-
monly  sold  under  the  trade  name  of  Roundup ®   (Vila-Aiub 
et  al.  2007).  Vila-Aiub  and  his  colleagues  list  some  of  the 
advantages  of  glyphosate,  including  being  highly  effective 
against a broad spectrum of weed species and of low toxic-
ity to mammals. With the development of glyphosate-resistant 
soybean  varieties,  the  area  under  no-till  soybean  cultivation 
in Argentina expanded to 16 million ha (39.5 million acres) 
and the use of glyphosate for weed control increased tenfold 
from 14 million liters in 1996 to 175 million liters in 2006. 
The application of such massive quantities of herbicide over 

Control: no herbicide

In contrast, all Johnsongrass

applications of glyphosate.

where they were exposed
to glyphosate survived
even high applications of
the herbicide.

planting large concentrations of a single crop, the application of pes-

lations, including insect pests and weeds, adapt to these conditions 
through the process of natural selection.

such a large area has the potential to create strong selection 
pressures on weed populations for the evolution of resistance. 
 Vila-Aiub  and  his  colleagues  conducted  their  study  in 
Salta Province in Northern Argentina. There, they focused on 
Johnsongrass,  Sorghum halepense,  a serious weed in soybean 
fields  that  can  reduce  soybean  yields  by  over  90%.  Farmers 
began  growing  glyphosate-resistant  soybeans  in  Salta  Prov-
ince in the year 2000. Following a few years of effective weed 
control with glyphosate, farmers began to report inconsistent 
control  of  Johnsongrass  across  the  province.  The  research 
team  grew  Johnsongrass  from  the      rhizomes    ,   a   rootlike, 
enlarged  underground  stem  of  some  plants  from  which  new 
plants  can  develop,  of  plants  from  areas  where  resistance 
had  been  suspected  and  from  areas  where  Johnsongrass  had 
not been exposed to high levels of glyphosate. The rhizomes 
were planted in pots and maintained outdoors. Once the plants 
sprouted, they were tended until they grew to about 40 cm high, 
at which point they were divided into three groups. The control 
group was sprayed with water, while the experimental groups 
were sprayed with glyphosate, at low or high concentrations. 

 The  results  of  this  study  support  the  hypothesis  that 
Johnsongrass  in  Salta  Province  has  evolved  resistance  to 

the  herbicide  glyphosate.  As  shown  in   figure  4.20 ,  plants 
from  all  sources  had  100%  survival  under  control  condi-
tions. In contrast, while no plants from susceptible popula-
tions survived exposure to either high or low concentrations 
of  glyphosate,  a  large  proportion  of  plants  from  popula-
tions with a history of exposure in soybean fields survived. 
Vila-Aiub  and  his  team  concluded  that  the  ineffectiveness 
of glyphosate at controlling Johnsongrass in Salta Province, 
Argentina  was  a  consequence  of  “evolved  heritable  resis-
tance” to the herbicide. 

 Johnsongrass  is  not  the  only  important  weed  species 
to  evolve  resistance  to  glyphosate.  As  of  2007,  new  cases 
of  herbicide-resistant  weeds  were  being  documented  at  a 
rate  of  approximately  one  per  year  (Heap  2007).  The  evo-
lution  of  insecticide  resistance  among  insect  species  that 
are significant crop pests is also well documented. Clearly, 
sustaining  agricultural  production  worldwide  requires  new 
approaches  to  pest  control,  especially  a  firm  understanding 
of  the  great  potential  of  pest  populations  to  adapt  through 
natural selection. In section II we will explore adaptation of 
organisms  to  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  aspects  of 
the environment.     

   Summary 

 Darwin and Mendel complemented each other well and their 
twin visions of the natural world revolutionized biology. The 
synthesis of the theory of natural selection and genetics gave 
rise  to  modern  evolutionary  ecology.  Here  we  examine  five 
major  concepts  within  the  area  of  population  genetics  and 
natural selection. 

  Phenotypic variation among individuals in a popula-
tion results from the combined effects of genes and envi-
ronment.   The first biologists to conduct thorough studies of 
phenotypic and genotypic variation and to incorporate experi-
ments in their studies, focused on plants. Clausen, Keck, and 
Hiesey  explored  the  extent  and  sources  of  morphological 
variation in plant populations, including both the influences 
of environment and genetics. Molecular genetic studies, such 
as  those  conducted  by  Douglas  and  Brunner  on  whitefish 
populations in the Alps, offer a powerful way of assessing the 
genetic variation in populations. 

  The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model helps iden-
tify evolutionary forces that can change gene frequencies 
in  populations.   Because  evolution  involves  changes  in 
gene frequencies in a population, a thorough understanding of 
evolution must include the area of genetics known as popula-
tion genetics. One of the most fundamental concepts in popu-
lation genetics, the Hardy-Weinberg principle, states that in a 
population mating at random in the absence of evolutionary 
forces, allele frequencies will remain constant. For a popula-
tion in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in a situation where there 
are only two alleles at a particular locus,  p   1   q   5  1.0. The fre-
quency of genotypes in a population in Hardy-Weinberg equi-
librium can be calculated as ( p   1   q ) 2   5  ( p   1   q )  3  ( p   1   q )  5  
 p  2   1  2 pq   1   q  2   5  1.0. The conditions necessary to maintain 
constant  allele  frequencies  in  a  population  are:  (1)  random 

mating,  (2)  no  mutations,  (3)  large  population  size,  (4)  no 
immigration, and (5) equal survival and reproductive rates for 
all genotypes. When a population is not in Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium, the Hardy-Weinberg principle helps us to iden-
tify the evolutionary forces that may be in play. 

  Natural  selection  is  differential  survival  and  repro-
duction among phenotypes.   Natural selection can lead to 
change in populations but it can also serve as a conservative 
force, impeding change in a population. Stabilizing selection 
acts against extreme phenotypes and as a consequence, favors 
the  average  phenotype.  By  favoring  the  average  phenotype, 
stabilizing selection decreases phenotypic diversity in popula-
tions. Directional selection favors an extreme phenotype over 
other phenotypes in the population. Under directional selec-
tion, the average of the trait under selection can change over 
time. Disruptive selection favors two or more extreme pheno-
types over the average phenotype in a population, leading to 
an increase in phenotypic diversity in the population. 

  A large and rapidly growing body of research on nat-
ural  populations  provides  robust  support  for  the  theory 
of evolution by natural selection.  The most general postu-
late of the theory of natural selection is that the environment 
determines  the  evolution  of  the  anatomy,  physiology,  and 
behavior of organisms. For such evolutionary change to occur, 
however, the variation in traits under selection must be heri-
table. A research team in Finland discovered that the size of 
eggs produced by a population of Ural owls is maintained by 
stabilizing selection. Their results indicated two main selec-
tive factors: variation in hatching success and production of 
fledgling owls over a female’s lifetime. Studies by Carroll and 
several colleagues show that soapberry bug populations living 
on native and introduced host plants have undergone natural 

98 

Section I

selection for traits that favor their survival and reproduction 
on particular host plant species. Studies of the medium ground 
finch,   Geospiza    fortis,   provide  one  of  the  clearest  and  most 
complete examples of disruptive selection in a natural popula-
tion. Researchers uncovered the influences of disruptive selec-
tion  on  beak  sizes  in  a  population  at  El  Garrapatero,  Santa 
Cruz Island, Galápagos, when their research revealed higher 
mortality,  or  possibly  higher  emigration,  of  birds  with  mid-
sized  beaks  in  the  population.  Disruptive  selection  on  beak 
size at El Garrapatero is reinforced by nonrandom patterns of 
mate choice in the population. Hundreds of other examples of 
natural selection have been brought to light during the one and 
a half centuries since Darwin published his theory. 

  Random  processes,  such  as  genetic  drift,  can  change 
gene frequencies in populations, especially in small popula-
tions.   Genetic drift is theoretically most effective at chang-
ing  gene  frequencies  in  small  populations  such  as  those  that 
inhabit  islands.  One  of  the  greatest  concerns  associated  with 
fragmentation of natural ecosystems due to human land use is 
that reducing habitat availability will decrease the size of ani-
mal and plant populations to the point where genetic drift will 

reduce the genetic diversity within natural populations. Ledig 
and  his  colleagues  found  a  significant  positive  correlation 
between population size and genetic diversity in populations of 
Chihuahua spruce, a naturally fragmented population of trees 
living on mountain islands. Frankham showed that compared to 
mainland populations, island populations generally include less 
genetic variation. Saccheri and his colleagues found that higher 
heterozygosity  (genetic  diversity)  was  associated  with  lower 
rates of population extinction through the effects of heterozy-
gosity on larval survival, adult longevity, and egg hatching in 
populations of the Glanville fritillary butterfly,  Melitaea cinxia.  
 Animal and plant breeders have used selective breeding, a 
process Darwin called artificial selection, to produce the thou-
sands  of  varieties  of  domesticated  plants  and  animals  from 
wild  ancestors.  Domestication  of  soybeans  provides  a  good 
example of artificial selection in action. Today, the traditional 
selective breeding techniques of Darwin’s time are combined 
with genetic engineering to alter the genetics of agricultural 
crops. The rapid evolution of herbicide resistance in Johnson-
grass populations in Argentina is an example of evolution by 
natural selection to the modern agricultural environment.

  Review Questions 

     1.  Contrast the approaches of Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel 
to the study of populations. What were Darwin’s main discover-
ies? What were Mendel’s main discoveries? How did the stud-
ies of Darwin and Mendel prepare the way for the later studies 
reviewed in chapter 4?  

    2.  How did the studies of Douglas and Brunner complement the 

earlier studies of Clausen, Keck, and Hiesey?  

    3.  What is the Hardy-Weinberg principle? What is Hardy- Weinberg 
equilibrium? What conditions are required for  Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium?  

    4.  Review the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation. What parts 
of the equation represent gene frequencies? What elements rep-
resent  genotype  frequencies  and  phenotype  frequencies?  Are 
genotype  and  phenotype  frequencies  always  the  same?  Use  a 
hypothetical  population  to  specify  alleles  and  allelic  frequen-
cies as you develop your presentation.  

    5.  What is genetic drift? Under what circumstances do you expect 
genetic  drift  to  occur?  Under  what  circumstances  is  genetic 
drift  unlikely  to  be  important?  Does  genetic  drift  increase  or 
decrease genetic variation in populations?  

    6.  Suppose you are a director of a captive breeding program for a 
rare species of animal, such as Siberian tigers, which are found 
in many zoos around the world but are increasingly rare in the 
wild. Design a breeding program that will reduce the possibility 
of genetic drift in captive populations.  

    7.  How might the distribution of beak sizes in the population differ 
from that shown in  figure 4.13 , if mate choice in the population 
was random with respect to beak size?  

    8.  How  did  the  studies  of  Scott  Carroll  and  his  colleagues 
 demonstrate rapid evolutionary adaptation to introduced soap-
berry plants? What advantages do a group of organisms, such as 
soapberry bugs, offer to researchers studying natural selection 
compared to larger organisms such as Chihuahua spruce?  

    9.  How do classical approaches to genetic studies, such as com-
mon  garden  experiments,  and  modern  molecular  techniques, 
such as DNA sequencing, complement each other? What are the 
advantages and disadvantages of each?

measure of the average kinetic energy, or energy of motion, of 
the molecules, in a mass of a substance. For example, water 
temperature  is  determined  by  the  average  kinetic  energy  of 
the water molecules in a mass of water. The kinetic energy in 
a mass of a substance is generally referred to as heat energy 
or  simply  as   heat  .  Temperature  is  one  of  the  most  ecologi-
cally  significant  environmental  factors.  Consequently,  many 
organisms have evolved varied mechanisms for regulating the 
temperature of their bodies or the temperature of parts of their 
anatomy. For example, at least one plant of the arctic tundra 
regulates the temperature of its reproductive structures. Peter 
Kevan  went  to  Ellesmere  Island,  which  lies  at  about  82 8   N 
latitude in the Northwest Territories of Canada, to study sun-
tracking behavior by arctic flowers. It was summer, there was 
little  wind,  and  the  sun  stayed  above  the  horizon  24  hours 
each day. As the sun’s position in the arctic sky changed, the 
flowers of one of the common tundra plants,  Dryas integrifo-
lia,  like the sunflowers of lower latitudes, followed. 

 Kevan  discovered  that  the  flowers  act  like  small  solar 
reflectors;  their  parabolic  shape  reflects  and  concentrates 
solar energy on the reproductive structures (Kevan 1975). He 
also  observed  that  many  species  of  small  insects,  attracted 
by  their  warmth,  basked  in  the  sun-tracking   Dryas   flowers, 
elevating their body temperatures as a consequence ( fig. 5.1 ). 
Dryas  depends on these insects to pollinate its flowers. 

 Environmental  temperatures  are  also  of  fundamental 
importance  to  humans.  Why?  The  fundamental  importance 
of  temperature  to  organisms,  including  humans,  is  a  con-
sequence  of  temperature’s  influences  on  rates  of  chemical 
reactions, including those reactions that control life’s essen-
tial  processes,  for  example,  photosynthesis  and  respiration. 
In addition, as we will see, all organisms are best adapted to 
a  fairly  narrow  range  of  temperatures.  For  us  and  all  other 

species, the impact of extreme temperatures can range from 
discomfort, at a minimum, to extinction. Long-term changes 
in  temperature  have  set  entire  floras  and  faunas  marching 
across continents, some species thriving, some holding on in 
small refuges, and others becoming extinct. Areas now sup-
porting temperate species were at times tropical and at other 
times the frigid homes of reindeer and woolly mammoths. 

 The  dynamic  environmental  history  of  the  earth  has 
become more significant as we face the reality of rapidly ris-
ing  global  temperatures  (see  chapter  23,  pp.  516–519)  and 
their  potential  ecological  impact.  Numerous  studies  have 
documented  responses  of  species  to  recent  climate  warm-
ing, including earlier spring migrations, earlier reproduction, 
extensions of geographic ranges toward the poles, and altitu-
dinal ranges up mountainsides. Some of these responses can 
be  attributed  to  phenotypic  plasticity  (see  chapter  4,  p.  80). 
However, many studies indicate rapid adaptation to the warm-
ing climate through natural selection. 

 We  defined  ecology  as  the  study  of  the  relationships 
between organisms and their environments. In chapter 5, we 
examine the relationship between organisms and temperature, 
one of the most important environmental factors and one of the 
most relevant in the face of today’s rapidly changing climate.  

   5.1  Microclimates 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 5.3  Describe the difference between microclimate and 

macroclimate.

 5.4  List the major factors contributing to microclimatic 

differences.

   Macroclimate interacts with the local landscape to produce 
microclimatic variation in temperature.   Microclimate is a 
fundamental  aspect  of  environmental  variation. What  do  we 
mean  by  macroclimate  and  microclimate?       Macroclimate     is 
what weather stations report and what we represented with cli-
mate diagrams in chapter 2.     Microclimate    is climatic variation 
on  a  scale  of  a  few  kilometers,  meters,  or  even  centimeters, 
usually measured over short periods of time. You acknowledge 
microclimate when you choose to stand in the shade on a sum-
mer’s day or in the sun on a winter’s day.  Macroclimate and 
microclimate are usually substantially different. Many organ-
isms live out their lives in very small areas during periods of 
time ranging from days to a few months. For these organisms 
macroclimate may be less important than microclimate. Micro-
climate  is  influenced  by  landscape   features  such  as  altitude, 
aspect, vegetation, color of the ground, and presence of boul-
ders. The physical nature of water and soil reduces tempera-
ture variation in aquatic environments and in animal burrows.  

   Altitude 
 As we saw in chapter 2 (see fig. 2.38), temperatures are gen-
erally lower at high elevations. Along the elevational gradient 
presented in figure 2.38, average annual temperature is 11.1 8 C 

 

Chapter 5

at  1,660  m  compared  to   2 3.7 8 C  at  3,743  m.  Lower  average 
temperatures at higher elevations are a consequence of several 
factors. First, because atmospheric pressure decreases with ele-
vation, air rising up the side of a mountain expands. The energy 
of motion (kinetic energy) required to sustain the greater move-
ment of air molecules in the expanding air mass is drawn from 
the surroundings, which cool as a result. A second reason that 
temperatures are generally lower at higher elevations is that there 
is less atmosphere to trap and radiate heat back to the ground.  

 Aspect 
 Topographic  features  such  as  hills,  mountains,  and  valleys 
create microclimates that would not occur in a flat landscape. 
Mountains and hillsides create these microclimates by shad-
ing parts of the land. In the Northern Hemisphere, the shaded 
areas  are  on  the  north-facing  sides,  or   northern  aspects,   of 
hills, mountains, and valleys, which face away from the equa-
tor.  In  the  Southern  Hemisphere,  the   southern  aspect   faces 
away from the equator. 

 The northern and southern aspects of mountains and val-
leys  offer  organisms  contrasting  microclimates,  which  may 
support very different types of vegetation ( fig. 5.2 ). The greater 
density of oaks and shrubs on the north-facing slope shown in 
 figure 5.2  is paralleled in miniature on north- and south-facing 
dune slopes in the Negev Desert, where north-facing slopes 
support a higher density of crust-forming mosses. G. Kidron, 
E. Barzilay, and E. Sachs, earth scientists from Hebrew Uni-
versity  Jerusalem,  documented  a  possible  physical  basis  for 
the  differences  in  moss  cover  (Kidron,  Barzilay,  and  Sachs 
2000). They found that north-facing dune slopes are cooler: 
7.8 8   to  9.2 8 C  cooler  at  midday  in  winter  and  1.8 8   to  2.5 8 C 
cooler at midday in summer. These earth scientists also found 
north-facing  slopes  remain  moist  approximately  2.5  times

 The north-facing slope at this site supports a Mediterra-
nean woodland, while the vegetation on the south-facing slope is mainly 
grassland.  

longer  than  south-facing  slopes  following  rainfall,  probably 
as a result of lower evaporation rates. 

 Vegetation 
 Because  they  shade  the  landscape,  plants  create  microcli-
mates.  For  instance,  trees,  shrubs,  and  plant  litter  (fallen 
leaves, twigs, and branches) produce ecologically important 
microclimates in deserts. The desert landscape, which often 
consists of a mosaic of vegetation and bare ground, is also a 
patchwork of sharply contrasting thermal environments. Such 
a  patchwork  is  apparent  near  Kemmerer,  Wyoming,  where 
microclimates  separated  by  only  a  few  meters  can  differ  in 
temperature by 27 8 C ( fig. 5.3 ). 

  Color of the Ground 
 Another factor that can significantly affect temperatures is the 
color of the ground. This statement may sound a bit odd if you 
are from a moist climate, either temperate or tropical, where 

Shading of soil surface by 
low shrubs lowers 
maximum temperatures.

A layer of leaf litter 
lowers maximum 
temperatures even more.

Soil surface in full 
sun heats to high 
temperatures.

Greater leaf area and 
numerous twigs of tall 
shrubs intercept more 
light, creating the 
coolest temperatures.

  Adaptations to the Environment

microclimate compared to (b) black sand, which absorbs most wavelengths of visible light.  

 Ground color influences microclimate. For example, (a) white sand reflects most wavelengths of visible light, creating a much cooler 

vegetation  usually  covers  the  ground.  In  contrast,  much  of 
an arid or semiarid landscape is bare ground, which can vary 
widely in color. Colors have been used to name deserts around 
the world, such as the central Asian deserts called Kara Kum, 
which means black sand in Turkish, and Kyzyl Kum, or red 
sand, and White Sands, New Mexico ( fig. 5.4 a  ). 

 Bare  ground  is  also  the  dominant  environment  offered 
by  beaches.  Neil  Hadley  and  his  colleagues  (1992)  studied 
the  beaches  of  New  Zealand,  which  range  in  color  from 
white  to  black  and  offer  a  wide  range  of  microclimates  to 
beach organisms. These beaches heat up under the summer 
sun, but black beaches heat up faster and to higher tempera-
tures. The black beaches heat up more because they absorb 
more  visible  light  than  do  the  white  beaches  ( fig.  5.4b ). 
When air temperatures at both beaches hovered around 30 8 C, 
Hadley and his colleagues found that the temperature of the 
sand on the white beach averaged around 45 8 C. In contrast, 
they measured sand temperatures on the black beach as high 
as 65 8 C. Though these white and black beaches are exposed 
to nearly identical macroclimates, they have radically differ-
ent microclimates.  

 Presence of Boulders and Burrows 
 Many  children  soon  discover  that  the  undersides  of  stones 
harbor a host of organisms seldom seen in the open. This is 
partly  because  the  stones  create  distinctive  microclimates. 
E.  B.  Edney’s  classic  studies  (1953)  of  the  seashore  isopod 
 Ligia oceanica  documented the effect of stones on microcli-
mate. Edney found that over the space of a few centimeters, 
 Ligia  could choose air temperatures ranging from 20 8 C in the 
open to 30 8 C in the air spaces under stones, which heated to 
between 34 8  and 38 8 C. 

 Animal  burrows  also  have  their  own  microclimates,  in 
which  temperatures  are  usually  more  moderate  than  at  the 
soil surface. For example, while daily temperatures under a 
shrub in the Chihuahuan Desert ranged from 17.5 8  to 32 8 C, 
temperatures  in  a  nearby  mammal  burrow  ranged  from  26 8  

Air temperature fluctuated 148C
while at 22.5 cm depth, soil
temperature varied only 48C.

  Aquatic Temperatures 
 As we saw in chapter 3, air temperature generally fluctuates 
more  than  water  temperature. The  thermal  stability  of  the 
aquatic environment derives partly from the high capacity 
of water to absorb heat energy without changing tempera-
ture (a capacity called  specific heat ). This capacity is about 
3,000  times  higher  for  water  than  for  an  equal  volume  of 

 

Chapter 5

air. It takes approximately 1 calorie of energy to heat 1 cm 3
of water 1 8 C. For an equal volume of air, this temperature 
rise requires only about 0.0003 calorie. 

 A second cause of the thermal stability of aquatic envi-
ronments is the large amount of heat absorbed by water as it 
evaporates  (which  is  called  the   latent  heat  of  vaporization ). 
This amounts to about 584 calories per gram of water at 22 8 C 
and 580 calories per gram of water at 35 8 C. So, 1 g of water 
evaporating from the surface of a desert stream, a lake, or a 
tide pool at 35 8 C draws 580 calories of heat from its surround-
ings. From the definition of a calorie, this is enough energy to 
cool 580 g of water 1 8 C. 

 A third cause of the greater thermal stability of aquatic 
environments is the heat energy that water gives up to its envi-
ronment as it freezes (the  latent heat of fusion ). Water gives 
up approximately 80 calories as 1 g of water freezes and the 
energy of motion of water molecules decreases as they leave 
the liquid state and become incorporated into the crystalline 
latticework of ice. So, as 1 g of pond water freezes, it gives 
off sufficient energy to heat 80 g of water 1 8 C, thus retarding 
further cooling. 

 The aquatic environments with greatest thermal stability 
are generally large ones, such as the open sea. These are envi-
ronments that store large quantities of heat energy and where 
daily fluctuations are often less than 1 8 C. Even the tempera-
tures of small streams, however, usually fluctuate less than the 
temperatures of nearby terrestrial habitats ( fig. 5.6 ). 

 Other factors besides the physics of water can affect the 
temperature of aquatic environments.     Riparian  vegetation    ,
that  is,  vegetation  that  grows  along  rivers  and  streams, 
influences the temperature in streams in the same way that 
vegetation modifies the temperature of desert soils—by pro-
viding shade.

After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 5.5  Define the principle of allocation.
 5.6  Discuss experimental evidence supporting the prin-

ciple of allocation.

 5.7  Explain the significance of the principle of alloca-

tion to the evolutionary process of adaptation.

   Adapting to one set of environmental conditions generally 
reduces a population’s fitness in other environments.  We 
might imagine an organism that is not only capable of living 
in any environment but thrives in all environments. In the lan-
guage of evolution such an organism would have high fitness 
across all environmental conditions. In everyday language we 
might refer to such a life form as a “super” organism. What-
ever we might call them, however, such life forms do not, as 
far as we know, exist. All known organisms are adapted to a 
limited range of environmental conditions, at least partially as 
a consequence of energy limitation.

  Adaptations to the Environment 

   The Principle of Allocation 
 All  organisms  have  access  to  limited  energy  supplies.  We 
introduce  the  concept  of  energy  limitation  here  and  will 
examine  it  in  detail  later  (see  chapter  7,  p.  163)  because  it 
comes  with  significant  evolutionary  consequences.  One  of 
those  consequences  is  that  energy  allocated  to  one  of  life’s 
functions,  such  as  reproduction,  defense  against  disease,  or 
growth, will reduce the amount of energy available for other 
functions.  Darwin  appreciated  the  evolutionary  implications 
of energy limitation and included it in his writings. However, 
Richard Levins was the first to use a mathematical approach 
to analyze the evolutionary consequences of such trade-offs, 
which  he  referred  to  as  the      principle  of  allocation     (Levins 
1968, p. 15). In his classic book,  Evolution in Changing Envi-
ronments,   Levins  concluded  that  as  a  population  adapts  to 
a  particular  set  of  environmental  conditions,  its  fitness  (see 
chapter 4, p. 85) in other environments is reduced. 

  Testing the Principle of Allocation 
 Demonstrating  the  evolutionary  tradeoffs  proposed  by  the 
principle of allocation has been challenging. In fact, a direct 
test of the principle has been nearly 40 years in coming. The 
major  difficulty  with  all  such  evolutionary  questions  is  the 
time required for performing evolutionary experiments with 
living organisms. Albert Bennett and Richard Lenski solved 
this time problem by studying evolution by microbial popula-
tions (Bennett and Lenski 2007), which can go through hun-
dreds of generations in a week. The central question of their 
work  was  whether  adaptation  to  a  low  temperature  (20 8 C) 
would be accompanied by a loss of fitness at a high tempera-
ture  (40 8 C).  Their  working  hypothesis  was  that  they  would 
observe just such a tradeoff in fitness, a prediction that fol-
lows directly from Levins’s principle of allocation. 

 Bennett  and  Lenski’s  experiments  focused  on  24  dif-
ferent  lineages  of  the  bacterium   Escherichia  coli.   These 
lineages  had been derived  from a single ancestral strain of 
 E.  coli   that  had  been  grown  at  37 8 C  (human  body  temper-
ature)  for  2,000  generations.  Bennett  and  Lenski  used  this 
ancestral strain to establish six replicate populations at four 
temperature regimes: constant 32 8 , 37 8 , and 42 8 C, and daily 
alternation  between  32 8   and  42 8 C.  They  maintained  these 
24 populations at these temperatures for 2,000 generations, 
sufficient  time  for  each  population  to  adapt  to  its  particu-
lar temperature regime. (Evolutionary research involving so 
many  generations  is  only  feasible  with  microbial  popula-
tions, since they have short generation times. For example, 
the generation time for  E. coli  growing at 40 8 C is approxi-
mately 20 minutes!) Bennett and Lenski next used bacterial 
cells from each of their 24 populations to establish 24 new 
populations, which were all grown at 20 8 C for 2,000 genera-
tions,  theoretically  adapting  to  this  relatively  low  tempera-
ture in the process. 

 To address their original question (Will adaptation to a 
low temperature [20 8 C] be accompanied by a loss of fitness 
at  a  high  temperature  [40 8 C]?),  Bennett  and  Lenski  com-
pared  the  fitness  of  the  low-temperature-selected  line  with 
the fitness of the ancestral line at 20 8 C and at 40 8 C. Their 

Increased fitness at 208C was, 
on average, accompanied by 
reduced fitness at 408C.

showed increased fitness at that temperature compared to ancestral 
lines, which were adapted to higher temperatures. However, they had 
reduced fitness at 40 8 C compared to ancestral lines (data from Bennett 
and Lenski 2007).  

measure of fitness was the rate of population doubling of a 
selected line of  E. coli  compared to that of its ancestral line, 
when  with  the  two  lines  were  grown  together.  Two  major 
results stand out. First, the lines grown at 20 8 C had  higher  
(positive)   fitness   at  20 8 C  temperature  compared  to  their 
immediate  ancestors.  In  other  words,  Bennett  and  Lenski 
showed that their lines grown at 20 8 C for 2,000 generations 
had indeed adapted to that lower temperature. However, the 
lines that had adapted to 20 8 C had, on average,  lower  (nega-
tive)   fitness   compared  to  their  immediate  ancestor,  when 
grown  at  40 8 C. Therefore,  as  predicted  by  the  principle  of 
allocation,  selection  for  higher  fitness  at  20 8 C  had  been 
accompanied by an average loss in fitness at higher tempera-
tures ( fig. 5.7 ). 

 Bennett  and  Lenski’s  results  provide  the  first  direct 
experimental  evidence  in  support  of  Levins’s  principle  of 
allocation. This  principle,  in  turn,  offers  an  explanation  for 
the  observation  that  most  organisms  perform  best  under  a 
limited range of environmental conditions, including thermal 
conditions. 

  Concept 5.2 Review 

      1.   If growing lines of Escherichia coli at 20 8 C for 2,000 
generations  increased  their  fitness  at  20 8 C  without 
reducing their fitness at 40 8 C, how would the distribu-
tion of points in  figure 5.7  change?  

     2.   If your research team obtained the hypothetical results 
described in question 1, what could you conclude about 
the principle of allocation?

of Organisms 

LEARNING OUTCOMES

 5.8  List several measures of animal, plant, and microbial 

performance.

 5.9  Write a summary equation for the process of 

photosynthesis.

 5.10  Explain why the process of acclimation to tempera-

ture is not an evolutionary process.

 5.11  Discuss how evidence that organisms are adapted 
to a restricted range of temperatures supports the 
principle of allocation (see section 5.2).

  Most  species  perform  best  in  a  fairly  narrow  range  of 
temperatures.  Ecologists  concerned  with  the  ecology  of 
individual organisms study how environmental factors, such 
as  temperature,  water,  and  light,  affect  the  physiology  and 
behavior  of  organisms:  how  fast  they  grow;  how  many  off-
spring they produce; how fast they run, fly, or swim; how well 
they avoid predators; and so on. We can group these phenom-
ena and say that ecologists study how environment affects the 
“performance” of organisms.  

 Whether in response to variations in temperature, mois-
ture, light, or nutrient availability, most species do not perform 
equally well across the full range of environmental conditions 
to  which  they  are  exposed;  most  perform  best  under  a  nar-
rower range of conditions. 

 Let’s  begin  our  discussion  of  temperature  and  animal 
performance  by  reviewing  the  influence  of  temperature  on 
enzyme function. Enzymes usually work best in some inter-
mediate range of temperatures, neither too hot nor too cold, 
where  they  retain  both  proper  shape,  to  bind  with  the  sub-
strate,  and  sufficient  flexibility,  to  perform  their  particular 
function. In other words, there is usually some optimal range 
of  temperatures  for  most  enzymes.  How  might  you  deter-
mine the optimal temperature for an enzyme? One way that 
molecular biologists assess the optimal conditions for enzyme 
performance  is  to  determine  the  concentration  of  substrate 
required  for  an  enzyme  to  work  at  a  particular  rate.  If  this 
concentration  is  low,  the  enzyme  is  performing  well  at  low 
concentrations of the substrate; that is, the enzyme has a high 
affinity for the substrate. The affinity of an enzyme for its sub-
strate is one measure of its performance. 

 John  Baldwin  and  P. W.  Hochachka  (1970)  studied  the 
influence of temperature on the activity of acetylcholinester-
ase, an enzyme produced at the synapse between neurons. This 
enzyme promotes the breakdown of the neurotransmitter ace-
tylcholine to acetic acid and choline and so turns off neurons, 
a process critical for proper neural function. The researchers 
found that rainbow trout,  Oncorhynchus mykiss,  produce two 
forms of acetylcholinesterase. One form has highest affinity 
for acetylcholine at 2 8 C, that is, at winter temperatures. How-
ever,  the  affinity  of  this  enzyme  for  acetylcholine  declines 
rapidly above 10 8 C. The second form of acetylcholinesterase 
shows  highest  affinity  for  acetylcholine  at  17 8 C,  at  summer 

temperatures.  However,  the  affinity  of  this  second  form  of 
acetylcholinesterase falls off rapidly at both higher and lower 
temperatures. In other words, the optimal temperatures for the 
two forms of acetylcholinesterase are 2 8  and 17 8 C ( fig. 5.8 ). 

 This  influence  of  temperature  on  the  performance  of 
acetylcholinesterase  makes  sense  if  you  consider  the  tem-
peratures of the rainbow trout’s native environment. Rainbow 
trout are native to the cool, clear streams and rivers of west-
ern North America. During winter, the temperatures of these 
streams  hover  between  0 8   and  4 8 C,  while  summer  tempera-
tures  approach  20 8 C. These  environmental  temperatures  are 
similar to the temperatures at which the acetylcholinesterase 
of rainbow trout performs optimally. 

 Studies of reptiles, especially lizards and snakes, are offer-
ing additional valuable insights into the influence of tempera-
ture on animal performance. Widely distributed species often 
offer the opportunity for studies of local variation in ecologi-
cal  relationships,  including  the  influence  of  temperature  on 
performance. For example, the eastern fence lizard,  Scelopo-
rus  undulatus,   is  found  across  approximately  two-thirds  of 

Acetylcholinesterase of trout 
held at 28C shows highest 
affinity for its substrate at 28C.

affinity for its substrate at 178C.

  Adaptations to the Environment 

 Investigating the Evidence  5 

 Laboratory Experiments 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 5.12  Describe the basic design of a laboratory experiment.
 5.13  Discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of 
laboratory experiments and field observations in 
ecological studies.

 One of the most powerful ways to test a hypothesis is through 
an experiment. Experiments used by ecologists generally fall 
into  one  of  two  categories—field  experiments  and  labora-
tory experiments. Field and laboratory experiments generally 
 provide  complementary  information  or  evidence,  and   differ 
somewhat  in  their  design.  Here  we  discuss  the  design  of 
 laboratory experiments. 

 In a laboratory experiment, the researcher attempts to keep 
all factors relatively constant except one. The one factor that 
is not kept constant is the one of interest to the experimenter 
and it is the one that the experimenter varies across experimen-
tal conditions. Let’s draw an example of a laboratory experi-
ment discussed in this chapter. Based upon published studies, 
Michael Angilletta (2001) concluded that geographically sepa-
rated populations of the eastern fence lizard,  Sceloporus undu-
latus,  may differ physiologically or behaviorally. 

 Angilletta  designed  a  laboratory  experiment  to  test  the 
hypothesis that populations of  S. undulatus  from regions with 
significantly  different  climates  differ  in  how  temperature 
affects their rates of metabolizable energy intake. The results 
of  that  experiment  are  summarized  by   figure  5.10 . What  we 
want to consider here is the design of the experiment that pro-
duced those results. What factors do you think Angilletta may 
have  attempted  to  control  in  this  experiment?  First,  he  used 
similar numbers of lizards from the two populations. He tested 
20 lizards from both populations at 33 8 C, 13 from New Jersey 
at 30 8  and 36 8 C, and 14 from South Carolina at 30 8  and 36 8 C. A 
second factor that Angilletta controlled was lizard size. Lizards 

the United States, living in a broad diversity of climatic zones 
( fig. 5.9 ). Taking advantage of this wide range of environmental 
conditions, Michael Angilletta (2001) studied the temperature 
relations of  S. undulatus  over a portion of its range. In one of 
his studies, Angilletta determined how temperature influences 
metabolizable energy intake, or MEI. He measured MEI as the 
amount of energy consumed (C) minus energy lost in feces (F) 
and uric acid (U), which is the nitrogen waste product produced 
by lizards. We can summarize MEI in equation form as:   

MEI 5 C 2 F 2 U  

 Angilletta  studied  two  populations  from  New  Jersey  and 
South Carolina, regions with substantially different climates. 

from both populations used in the experiments had an average 
body mass of approximately 5.4 g. Since males and females 
may differ physiologically, Angilletta included approximately 
equal  numbers  of  males  and  females  in  his  experiments.  He 
also was careful to expose all the lizards to the same quality 
of light and to the same numbers of hours of light and dark-
ness and he maintained them in the same kinds of experimental 
enclosures. Angilletta also fed all the lizards in his experiment 
the same type of food: live crickets. The list could go on but 
these are the major factors controlled in this experiment. 

 Now, what factors did Angilletta vary in that experiment? 
For each study population, New Jersey or South Carolina, he 
varied a single factor: temperature. In the experiment, Angil-
letta maintained lizards from New Jersey and South Carolina at 
three temperatures: 30 8 , 33 8 , and 36 8 C and estimated their rates 
of  metabolizable  energy  intake  at  these  three  temperatures. 
Angilletta’s experiment revealed that lizards from both popula-
tions  have  a  maximum  metabolizable  energy  intake  at  33 8 C. 
This result suggests, contrary to the study’s hypothesis, that the 
optimum temperature for feeding does not differ for the two 
populations. However, the experiment also showed that at 33 8 C 
 S. undulatus  from South Carolina have a higher metabolizable 
energy intake compared to lizards from New Jersey. This result 
provides evidence of the geographic differences that Angilletta 
thought might exist across the range of  S. undulatus.  The power 
of this experiment to reveal the influence of temperature on liz-
ard performance resulted from the ability of the researcher to 
control all significant factors but the one of interest. In this case 
the main factor of interest was temperature. 

  C RITIQUING   THE  E VIDENCE  5 
     1.  What is the greatest strength of laboratory experiments in 

ecological research?  

    2.  Why  do  ecologists  generally  supplement  information 
resulting from laboratory experiments with field observa-
tions or experiments?    

He collected a sample of lizards from both populations and 
maintained portions of his samples from both populations at 
30 8 , 33 8 , and 36 8 C. Angilletta kept his study lizards in sepa-
rate enclosures and provided them with crickets that he had 
weighed  to  the  nearest  0.1  mg  as  food.  Since  he  had  deter-
mined the energy content of an average cricket, Angilletta was 
able to determine the energy intake by each lizard by count-
ing the number of crickets they ate and calculating the energy 
content of that number. He determined the energy lost as feces 
(F) and uric acid (U) by collecting all the feces and uric acid 
produced  by  each  lizard  and  then  drying  and  weighing  this 
material.  He  estimated  the  average  energy  content  of  feces 
and uric acid using a bomb calorimeter.

 The results of Angilletta’s experiment, which are shown 
in  figure 5.10 , show clearly that MEI is highest in both pop-
ulations  of  lizards  at  the  intermediate  temperature  of  33 8 C. 
Note, however, that the South Carolina lizards took in energy 
at a much higher rate at 33 8 C. Despite this difference, lizards 
from both populations performed best in a fairly narrow range 
of temperatures. Analogous influences of temperature on per-
formance have also been well documented in plants. 

   Extreme Temperatures 
and Photosynthesis 
 One of the most fundamental characteristics of plants is their 
ability to photosynthesize.     Photosynthesis    ,  the conversion of 
light energy to the chemical energy of organic molecules, is 
the  basis  for  the  life  of  plants—their  growth,  reproduction, 
and so on—and the ultimate source of energy for most hetero-
trophic organisms. 

 Photosynthesis  can  be  summarized  by  the  following 

equation:   

Light
↓

6 CO2 1 12 H2O 

Chlorophyll

 C6H12O6 1 6 O2 1 6 H2O 

This  equation  indicates  that  as  light  interacts  with  chloro-
phyll,  carbon  dioxide  and  water  combine  to  produce  sugar 
and oxygen. 

 Extreme  temperatures  generally  reduce  the  rate  of 
 photosynthesis  by  plants.   Figure  5.11   shows  the  influence 
of  temperature  on  rate  of  photosynthesis  by  a  moss  from 
the  boreal  forest,   Pleurozium  schreberi,   and  a  desert  shrub, 
 Atriplex   lentiformis.   The  moss  and  the  desert  shrub  both

photosynthesize at a maximum rate over some narrow range 
of temperatures. Both plants photosynthesize at lower rates at 
temperatures above and below this range. 

 The  results  shown  in   figure  5.11   demonstrate  that  the 
moss  and  the  shrub  have  substantially  different  optimal 
temperatures  for  photosynthesis.  At  15 8 C,  where  the  moss 
photosynthesizes  at  a  maximum  rate,  the  desert  shrub  pho-
tosynthesizes at about 25% of its maximum. At 44 8 C, where 
the desert shrub is photosynthesizing at its maximum rate, the 
moss  would  probably  die.  These  physiological  differences 
clearly  reflect  differences  in  the  environments  where  these 
species live and to which they are adapted. While the moss 
lives in the cool boreal forests of Finland, the study popula-
tion  of  the  desert  shrub,   A.  lentiformis,   lives  near  Thermal, 
California, in one of the hottest deserts on earth. 

 Plant responses to temperature, as well as those of ani-
mals, can also reflect the short-term physiological adjustments 
called      acclimation    .  Acclimation  involves  physiological,  not 
genetic,  changes  in  response  to  temperature;  acclimation  is 
generally  reversible  with  changes  in  environmental  condi-
tions.  Studies  of   A.  lentiformis   by  Robert  Pearcy  (1977) 
clearly demonstrate the effect of acclimation on photosynthe-
sis. Pearcy located a population of this desert shrub in Death 
Valley and grew plants for his experiments from cuttings. By 
propagating plants from cuttings, he was able to conduct his 
experiments on genetically identical clones. The clones from 
the  Death Valley  plants  were  grown  under  two  temperature 
regimes: one set in “hot” conditions of 43 8 C during the day 
and 30 8 C at night; the other set under cool conditions of 23 8 C 
during the day and 18 8 C at night. 

 Pearcy then measured the photosynthetic rates of the two 
sets of plants. The plants grown in a cool environment photo-
synthesized at a maximum rate at about 32 8 C. Those grown

 Growing the same species of shrub in cool versus hot

40 8 C, a difference in the optimum temperature for photosyn-
thesis of 8 8 C.  Figure 5.12  summarizes the results of Pearcy’s 
experiment. 

 The  physiological  adjustments  made  by   A.  lentiformis  
correspond  to  what  these  plants  do  during  an  annual  cycle. 
The  plant  is  evergreen  and  photosynthesizes  throughout  the 
year,  in  the  cool  of  winter  and  in  the  heat  of  summer.  The 
physiological adjustments suggest that acclimation by  A. len-
tiformis  may shift its optimal temperature for photosynthesis 
to match seasonal changes in environmental temperature.  

  Temperature and Microbial Activity 
 Microbes appear to have adapted to all temperatures at which 
there is liquid water, from the frigid waters around the Antarc-
tic to boiling hot springs. However, while each of these envi-
ronments harbors one or more species of microbes, no known 
species thrives in all these conditions. All microbes that have 
been studied, like the plants and animals discussed in this sec-
tion, perform best over a fairly narrow range of temperatures. 
Let’s look at two microbes that live in environments at oppo-
site extremes of the aquatic temperature spectrum. 

 In chapter 3, we saw that most of the oceanic environment, 
the  largest  continuous  environment  on  the  earth,  lies  below 
the well-lighted surface waters. The organisms that live in the 
deep oceans live in darkness. Their environment is also cold, 
generally  below  5 8 C.  This  cold-water  environment  extends 
to the surface in the Arctic and Antarctic. A wide variety of 
organisms live in these cold waters. How do you think the per-
formance of these organisms is affected by temperature? 

 Richard Morita (1975) studied the effect of temperature 
on population growth among cold-loving, or     psychrophilic    ,  
marine  bacteria  that  live  in  the  waters  around  Antarctica.

the  experiment,  the  temperature  gradient  within  the  incuba-
tor  ranged  from  about   2 2 8 C  to  just  over  9 8 C.  The  results 
of  the  experiment  show  that  this   Vibrio   sp.  grows  fastest  at 
about  4 8 C. At  temperatures  above  and  below  this,  its  popu-
lation  growth  rate  decreases. As   figure  5.13   shows,  Morita 
recorded  some  growth  in  the   Vibrio   population  at  tempera-
tures approaching  2 2 8 C; however, populations did not grow 
at  temperatures  above  9 8 C.  Morita  has  recorded  population 
growth among some cold-loving bacteria at temperatures as 
low as  2 5.5 8 C. 

 Some  microbes  can  live  at  very  high  temperatures. 
Microbes have been found living in all of the hot springs that 
have been studied. Some of these heat-loving, or      thermophilic    ,  
microbes  grow  at  temperatures  above  40 8 C  in  a  variety  of 
environments. The most heat-loving microbes are the hyper-
thermophiles,  which  have  temperature  optima  above  80 8 C. 
Some  hyperthermophiles  grow  best  at  110 8 C!  Some  of  the 
most intensive studies of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic 
microbes have been carried out in Yellowstone National Park 
by Thomas Brock (1978) and his students and colleagues. One 
of the genera they have studied is  Sulfolobus,  a member of the 
microbial Domain Archaea, which obtains energy by oxidiz-
ing elemental sulfur. Jerry Mosser and colleagues (1974) used 
the rate at which  Sulfolobus  oxidizes sulfur as an index of its 
metabolic  activity.  They  studied  the  microbes  from  a  series 
of  hot  springs  in Yellowstone  National  Park  that  ranged  in 
temperature from 63 8  to 92 8 C. The temperature optimum for 
the  Sulfolobus  populations ranged from 63 8  to 80 8 C and was 
related to the temperature of the particular spring from which 
the  microbes  came.  For  instance,  one  strain  isolated  from  a 
59 8 C spring oxidized sulfur at a maximum rate at 63 8 C. This 
 Sulfolobus  population oxidizes sulfur at a high rate within a

 We  have  reviewed  how  temperature  can  affect  micro-

These  examples  demonstrate  that  most  organisms  perform 
best over a fairly narrow range of temperatures. Consider the 
effects of temperature on the performance of organisms rela-
tive to our discussion of how temperatures can vary greatly 
over small distances. In addition, the climate diagrams pre-
sented  in  chapter  2  showed  us  that  temporal  variation  in 
temperature can also be substantial. In the next Concept, we 
review  how  some  organisms  regulate  their  body  tempera-
tures in response to variation in environmental temperatures.

   Many  organisms  have  evolved  ways  to  compensate  for 
variations  in  environmental  temperature  by  regulating 
body  temperature.   So,  how  do  organisms  respond  to  the 
juxtaposition  of  thermal  heterogeneity  in  the  environment 
and  their  own  fairly  narrow  thermal  requirements?  Do  they 
sit passively and let environmental temperatures affect them 
as they will, or do they take a more active approach? Many 
organisms have evolved ways to regulate body temperatures.  

   Balancing Heat Gain against Heat Loss 
 Organisms  regulate  body  temperature  by  manipulating  heat 
gain  and  loss.  An  equation,  used  by  K.  Schmidt-Nielsen 
(1983), can help us understand the components of heat that 
may be manipulated:   

Hs 5 Hm 6 Hcd 6 Hcv 6 Hr 2 He 

Here,  H s ,  the  total  heat  stored  in  the  body  of  an  organism, 
is  made  up  of  H m ,  heat  gained  from  metabolism;  H cd ,  heat 
gained or lost through conduction; H cv , heat lost or gained by 
convection; H r  , heat gained or lost through electromagnetic 
radiation; and H e , heat lost through evaporation. These heat 
components represent ways that heat is transferred between 
an organism and its environment.     Metabolic heat    ,  H m , is the 
energy released within an organism during the process of cel-
lular respiration.     Conduction    is the transfer of heat between 
objects in direct physical contact, as occurs when you sit on a 
stone bench on a cold winter’s day;     convection    is the process 
of heat flow between a solid body and a moving fluid, such 
as between you and wind on a cold day. During the process 
of  conduction  or  convection,  H cd   and  H cv ,  the  direction  of 
heat flow is always from the warmer region to the colder. 

 Heat  may  also  be  transferred  through  electromagnetic 
radiation.  This  transfer  of  heat,  H r  ,  is  often  called  simply 
     radiation    .  All objects above absolute 0, above  2 273 8 C, give 
off electromagnetic radiation, but the most obvious source in 
our environment is the sun. Curiously, we are blind to most of 
this heat flux, because at sea level over half of the energy con-
tent  of  sunlight  falls  outside  our  visible  range.  Much  of  this 
radiation that we cannot see is in the infrared part of the spec-
trum.  The  electromagnetic  radiation  emitted  by  most  objects 
in our environment, including our own bodies, is also infrared 
light. Infrared light is responsible for most of the warmth you 
feel when standing in front of a fire or that you feel radiating 
from the sunny side of a building on a winter’s day. The chilling 
effect of standing outdoors under a clear, cold night sky with no 
wind is also mainly due to radiative heat flux, in this case from 
your body to the surroundings, including the night sky. 

 Heat may be lost by an organism through     evaporation    ,  H e . 
In general, we need only consider the heat lost as water evapo-
rates from the surface of an organism. The ability of water to 
absorb a large amount of heat as it evaporates makes cooling

 So how can organisms regulate body temperature? First 
of all, many organisms don’t. The body temperature of these 
organisms,  called      poikilotherms    ,   varies  directly  with  envi-
ronmental temperatures. Of the organisms that regulate body 
temperature, most use external sources of energy and a combi-
nation of anatomy and behavior to manipulate H c , H r  , and H e . 
Animals that rely mainly on external sources of energy for reg-
ulating  body  temperature  are  called      ectotherms    .   Organisms 
that rely heavily on internally derived metabolic heat energy, 
H m ,  are  called      endotherms    .   Among  endotherms,  birds  and 
mammals use metabolic energy to heat most of their bodies. 
Other endothermic animals, including certain fish and insects, 
use metabolic energy to selectively heat critical organs. Endo-
therms that use metabolic energy to maintain a relatively con-
stant  body  temperature  are  called      homeotherms    .   The  only 
homeothermic organisms are birds and mammals. 

 Temperature regulation presents both plants and ectother-
mic animals with a similar problem. Both groups of organisms 
rely primarily on external sources of energy. Despite the much 
greater mobility of most ectothermic animals, the ways in which 
plants and ectothermic animals solve these problems are similar.  

 Desert Plants 
 The desert environment challenges plants to avoid overheating; 
that is, plants are challenged to reduce their heat storage, H s . 
How do desert plants meet this challenge? They, like plants from 
other environments, use morphology and behavior to alter heat 
exchange with the environment. Evaporative cooling of leaves, 
which would increase heat loss, H e , is not a workable option 
because desert plants usually have inadequate supplies of water. 
Also, for most plants, we can ignore H m . Most produce only a 
small quantity of heat by metabolism. So, for a plant in a hot 
desert environment, our equation for heat balance reduces to:

Hs 5 Hcd 6 Hcv 6 Hr

To avoid heating, plants in hot deserts have three main options: 
decreasing  heating  by  conduction,  H cd ;  increasing  rates  of 
convective cooling, H cv ; and reducing rates of radiative heat-
ing,  H r  .  Many  desert  plants  place  their  foliage  far  enough 
above  the  ground  to  reduce  heat  gain  by  conduction.  Many 
desert plants have also evolved very small leaves and an open 
growth  form,  adaptations  that  give  high  rates  of  convective 
cooling because they increase the ratio of leaf surface area to 
volume and the movement of air around the plant’s stems and 
foliage.  Some  desert  plants  have  low  rates  of  radiative  heat 
gain, H r  , because they have evolved reflective surfaces. As we 
observed in chapter 2, many desert plants cover their leaves 
with a dense coating of white plant hairs. These hairs reduce 
H r   gain  by  reflecting  visible  light,  which  constitutes  nearly 
half the energy content of sunlight. 

 We can see how natural selection has adapted plants to 
different  temperature  regimes  by  comparing  species  in  the 
genus  Encelia,  which are distributed along a temperature and 
moisture gradient from the coast of California to Death Valley. 
James Ehleringer (1980) showed that the leaves of the coastal 
species,   Encelia  californica,   lack  hairs  entirely  and  reflect 
only about 15% of visible light. He also found that two other 
species that grow partway between the cool coast regions and 
Death Valley produce leaves that are somewhat pubescent and 
reflect about 26% of visible light. The desert species,  Encelia 
farinosa,  produces two sets of leaves, one set in the summer 
and another when it’s cooler. The summer leaves are highly 
pubescent (hairy) and reflect more than 40% of solar radiation 
while the cool season leaves are not. 

 Plants can also modify radiative heat gain, H r  , by chang-
ing  the  orientation  of  leaves  and  stems.  Many  desert  plants 
reduce heating by orienting their leaves parallel to the rays of 
the sun or by folding them at midday, when sunlight is most 
intense.  Figure 5.16  portrays the main processes involved in 
heat balance in desert plants. 

  Temperature Regulation by Plants 
 What sorts of environments are best for studying temperature 
regulation  by  plants?  Plant  ecologists  have  typically  con-
centrated their studies in extreme environments, such as the 
desert and tundra, where the challenges of the physical envi-
ronment are greater and where ecologists believed they would 
find the most dramatic adaptations. 

 Arctic and Alpine Plants 
 As  you  would  probably  predict,  temperature  regulation  by 
plants in cold regions, in most cases, contrasts sharply with 
temperature  regulation  by  desert  plants.  However,  we  can 
model  temperature  regulation  by  plants  from  cold  environ-
ments using the same equation we used for heat regulation in 
desert plants: H s   5  H cd   6  H cv   6  H r .

Darkly pigmented

 The  problem  here,  though,  is  staying  warm,  and  arctic 
and alpine plants have two main options: increase their rate of 
radiative heating, H r  , and/or decrease their rate of convective 
cooling, H cv  . It appears that many plants have evolved to do 
both and, as a result, can heat up to temperatures far above 
air temperature. So, while favoring desert plants that reflect 
light,  natural  selection  has  favored  arctic  and  alpine  plants 
that  absorb  light  with  dark  pigments.  These  dark  pigments 
increase radiative heat gain, H r  . Arctic and alpine plants, such 
as the  Dryas integrifolia  (see  fig. 5.1 ), also increase their H r  
gain by orienting their leaves and flowers perpendicular to the 
sun’s rays. In addition, many plants increase their H r  gain from 
the surroundings by assuming a “cushion” growth form that 
“hugs” the ground. The ground often warms to temperatures 
exceeding that of the overlying air and radiates infrared light, 
which can be absorbed by cushion plants. Cushion plants can 
also gain heat from warm substrate through conduction, H cd . 
 The  cushion  growth  form  also  reduces  convective  heat 
loss, H cv  , in two main ways. First, growing close to the ground 
gives them some shelter from the wind. Second, the compact, 
hemispherical growth form of cushion plants reduces the ratio 
of surface area to volume, which slows the movement of air 
through  the  interior  of  the  plant.  Reduced  surface  area  also 
reduces the rate of radiative heat loss. 

  Figure  5.17   summarizes  the  processes  involved  in  ther-
mal regulation by a cushion plant. As a consequence of these 

Arctic and alpine plants also 
increase Hr by orienting their 
leaves perpendicular to sunlight.

processes, cushion plants are often warmer than the surround-
ing  air  and  compared  to  plants  with  other  growth  forms. Y. 
Gauslaa (1984), who studied the heat budgets of a variety of 
Scandinavian  plants,  documented  the  thermal  consequences 
of the cushion growth form. He found that while the tempera-
ture of plants with an open growth form closely matches air 
temperature,  the  temperature  of  cushion  plants  can  be  over 
10 8 C higher than air temperature. The results of one of Gaus-
laa’s comparisons are shown in  figure 5.18 . 

  Tropical Alpine Plants 
 Some  of  the  most  amazing  examples  of  thermoregulation 
occur among the plants that inhabit the far-flung world of the 
tropical alpine zone. As we saw in chapter 2, this zone is a 
unique environment with little annual variation in temperature 
but with so much daily fluctuation that freezing temperatures 
at night are often followed by “summer” temperatures during 
the day. In this environment, natural selection has produced 
one  of  the  most  remarkable  examples  of  convergence,  the 
giant rosette plants that cloak the sides of tropical mountains 
throughout the world (see fig. 2.39). 

 The  giant  rosette  growth  form  has  a  number  of  features 
that buffer the plant against the extreme daily temperature fluc-
tuations  of  the  tropical  alpine  zone.  Rosette  plants  generally 
retain their dead leaves, which insulate the stem and protect it 
from freezing. A dense pubescence, which may be 2 to 3 mm 
thick, covers the living leaves of most species. This thick pubes-
cence  helps  conserve  heat  in  the  cool  alpine  environment  by 
creating a dead air space above the leaf surface, which reduces 
convective heat losses. Leaf pubescence on these tropical alpine 
plants acts like a kind of plant fur. The rosettes of many spe-
cies also secrete and retain several liters of fluids within their 
rosettes or within large, hollow inflorescences. Retaining these 
large volumes of water increases the capacity of the rosette or 

inflorescence to store heat. Greater heat storage, H s , during the 
day means a lower probability of freezing at night. Much as the 
 Dryas   flowers  we  discussed  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter, 
the leaves of some species act as parabolic mirrors, increasing 
radiative heating, H r  , of the apical bud and expanding leaves. 
The rosettes of some tropical alpine plants even close over the 
apical bud at night, which protects the bud from freezing.   

  Temperature Regulation 
by Ectothermic Animals 
 Like  plants,  the  vast  majority  of  animals,  including  fish, 
amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates of all sorts, use exter-
nal  sources  of  energy  to  regulate  body  temperature.  These 
ectothermic  animals  use  means  analogous  to  those  used  by 
plants, including variations in body size, shape, and pigmen-
tation. The  obvious  difference  between  plants  and  ectother-
mic animals is that the animals have more options for using 
behavior  to  thermoregulate. Yet,  as  we  shall  see,  the  differ-
ence between the behavior of these animals and that of plants 
is more a matter of degree than of kind. 

 Lizards 
 The  eastern  fence  lizard,   Sceloporus  undulatus,   is  an  ecto-
therm that regulates its body temperature by behaviors such 
as basking in the sun to warm its body or seeking shade to 
cool  (see   fig.  5.9 ).  Research  by  Michael Angilletta  showed 
that the rate of metabolizable energy intake is maximized at a 
temperature of 33 8 C (see  fig. 5.10 ). Knowing this, he studied 
the relationship between this optimal temperature and the pre-
ferred temperature of  S.   undulatus.  Angilletta (2001) explored 
this relationship in the laboratory and the field. In the labora-
tory, he placed  S.   undulatus  from New Jersey and South Caro-
lina in a temperature gradient that ranged from 26 8 C at one 
end to 38 8 C at the other end. He determined preferred tem-
perature early each morning by quickly measuring the body 
temperature of each lizard. Body temperature would indicate 
where each lizard had been in the temperature gradient, that 
is,  its  “preferred”  temperature. Angilletta  examined  thermo-
regulation by measuring the body temperatures of active indi-
viduals in the field. 

 The  results  of  Angilletta’s  study  provide  strong  evi-
dence  for  a  correspondence  among  preferred  temperature, 
thermoregulation,  and  optimal  temperatures  in   S.  undulatus  
( fig.  5.19 ).  Lizards  from  New  Jersey  and  South  Carolina 
had  virtually  identical  preferred  temperatures:  32.8 8   ver-
sus  32.9 8 C,  respectively.  The  body  temperatures  found  by 
 Angilletta in the field were also very similar. The body tem-
peratures of  S. undulatus  measured in the field in New Jersey 
averaged 34.0 8 C, while the body temperatures of  S. undulatus  
taken  in  South  Carolina  averaged  33.1 8 C. As  shown  in   fig-
ure 5.19 , both preferred temperatures determined in the labo-
ratory and the body temperatures of  S. undulatus  measured 
in the field are very close to the temperature that maximizes 
metabolizable energy intake by these lizards. The following 
example shows that effective thermoregulation by ectotherms 
is not limited to lizards.

  Grasshoppers: Some Like It Hot 
 Many grasshoppers also bask in the sun, elevating their body 
temperature to 40 8 C or even higher. R. I. Carruthers and his 
colleagues (1992) described how some species of grasshoppers 
even  adjust  their  capacity  for  radiative  heating,  H r  ,  by  vary-
ing  the  intensity  of  their  pigmentation  during  development. 

Grasshoppers reared at low 
temperatures develop dark 
pigmentation that is highly 
absorbent of visible light.

Chapter 5 

  Temperature Relations 

113

When  reared  at  low  temperatures,  these  species  appear  to 
compensate by developing dark pigmentation, while at higher 
developmental  temperatures,  they  produce  less  pigmentation 
( fig. 5.20 ). How would changing pigmentation in response to 
developmental temperatures affect thermoregulation by these 
grasshoppers?  Because  grasshoppers  reared  at  low  tempera-
tures develop darker pigmentation, they increase their potential 
for H r  gain. Because those reared at high temperatures develop 
lighter pigmentation, they reduce their potential for H r  gain. 

 The  clear-winged  grasshopper, 

 Camnula  pellucida,  
inhabits subalpine grasslands in the White Mountains of east-
ern Arizona, where the cool mornings warm up quickly under 
the mountain sun. During early morning,  Camnula  orients its 
body perpendicular to the sun’s rays and quickly heats to 30 8  
to 40 8 C. Given the opportunity, young  Camnula  will maintain 
a body temperature around 38 8  to 40 8 C, very close to its opti-
mal temperature for development. In the laboratory,  Camnula  
is able to elevate its body temperature to 12 8 C above air tem-
perature and maintain it within a very narrow range ( 6  2 8 C) 
for many hours. 

 Carruthers and his colleagues divided a laboratory popu-
lation of  Camnula  into two groups, both of which were kept at 
an air temperature of about 18 8 C. However, one of the groups 
also had access to light, while the other was restricted to the 
shade. The grasshoppers that had access to light basked and 
elevated their body temperatures about 10 8 C above air tem-
perature.  Meanwhile,  the  body  temperatures  of  the  shaded 
grasshoppers remained close to air temperature ( fig. 5.21 ). 

 Why does  Camnula  bask and maintain a body tempera-
ture  above  air  temperature?  The  researchers  estimated  that 
by basking in the sun the grasshopper develops faster than it 
would if it allowed its body temperature to match air tempera-
ture. What other benefits might  Camnula  gain by maintaining 

Grasshoppers with access to light 
bask, raising their body temperatures 
about 108C above air temperature.

Body temperatures of grasshoppers 
confined to the shade nearly match 
air temperature.

Grasshoppers reared 
at high temperatures 
develop reflective, 
light pigmentation.

temperature to 38 8  to 40 8 C to control  Entomophaga grylli,  a 
fungus that infects and kills grasshoppers. 

 The idea that high temperatures could control  Entomoph-
aga   was  tested  by  growing  the  fungus  in  artificial  media  at 
15 8 , 20 8 , 25 8 , 30 8 , 35 8 , and 45 8 C. The populations grew fastest 
at 25 8 C; above and below 25 8 C the fungus populations grew 
at a slower rate; they did not grow at 35 8 C and were killed at 
45 8 C ( fig. 5.22 ). 

 After  studying  the  growth  of  the  fungus  in  artificial 
media,  the  researchers  studied  how  temperature  influences 
mortality  among  grasshoppers  infected  with  the  fungus. 
They found that exposure to 40 8 C temperatures for as few as 
4 hours each day significantly reduced the number of grass-
hoppers  dying  of   Entomophaga   infections.  The  results  of 
these experiments support the hypothesis that by maintaining 
body  temperatures  of  38 8   to  40 8 C,  clear-winged  grasshop-
pers create an environment unsuitable for one of their most 
serious  pathogens.  How  does  the  effect  of  temperature  on 
population growth by  Entomophaga  compare to the effect of 
temperature  on  population  growth  by  bacteria  as  shown  in 
 figures 5.13  and  5.14 ?   

  Temperature Regulation 
by Endothermic Animals 
 Do  endothermic  animals  thermoregulate  differently  than  the 
other organisms we’ve discussed? Endotherms use all the ana-
tomical and behavioral tricks used by other organisms to manip-
ulate heat exchange with the environment. So, our basic equation 
for temperature regulation, H s   5  H m   6  H cd   6  H cv   6  H r   2  H e , 
still applies but with some changes in the relative importance of 
the terms. Most significantly, endotherms rely a great deal more 
on metabolic heat, H m , to maintain constant body temperature. 

  Environmental Temperature 
and Metabolic Rates 
 P.  F.  Scholander  and  his  colleagues  (1950)  studied  thermo-
regulation  in  several  endothermic  species  by  monitoring 
metabolic  rate  while  exposing  them  to  a  range  of  tempera-
tures.  The  range  of  environmental  temperatures  over  which 
the metabolic rate of a homeothermic animal does not change 
is called its     thermal neutral zone    .  When environmental tem-
peratures  are  within  the  thermal  neutral  zone  of  an  inactive 
endothermic animal, its metabolic rate stays steady at resting 
metabolism. However, if the environmental temperature falls 
below or rises above the thermal neutral zone, an endotherm’s 
metabolic rate will rapidly increase to two or even three times 
resting metabolism. 

 What causes metabolic rates to rise when environmental 
temperatures are outside the thermal neutral zone? We can use 
humans  as  a  model  for  the  responses  of  endotherms  gener-
ally. At low temperatures, we start shivering, which generates 
heat by muscle contractions. We also release hormones that 
increase our metabolic rate, the rate at which we metabolize 
our  energy  stores,  which  are  mainly  fats.  Increasing  meta-
bolic rate increases the rate at which we generate metabolic 
heat, H m . At high temperatures, heart rate and blood flow to 
the  skin  increase. This  increased  blood  flow  transports  heat 
from the body core to the skin, where heat energy is radiated 
to  the  surrounding  environment.  Radiative  heat  loss  can  be 
increased  by  specialized  structures.  For  example,  Brazilian 
free-tailed  bats  have  specialized  regions  along  the  sides  of 
their  bodies  that  radiate  excess  metabolic  heat  generated  as 
they fly ( fig. 5.23 ). 

 An  evaporative  cooling  system  based  on  sweating 
can  accelerate  unloading  of  heat  to  the  external  environ-
ment.  Many  large  endotherms,  including  humans,  horses, 
and  camels,  also  cool  by  sweating.  Other  endotherms  do 
not  sweat  but  evaporatively  cool  by  other  means:  Dogs 
and  birds  pant  and  marsupials  and  rodents  moisten  their 
body surfaces by salivating and licking. Thus, in these and 
other species temperature regulation and water balance are 
closely related. 

 Scholander  and  his  colleagues  found  that  the  breadth 
of the thermal neutral zone varies a great deal among endo-
thermic  species.  Based  on  their  results,  they  suggested  that 
 differences  in  the  width  of  the  thermal  neutral  zone  defines 
two groups of organisms: tropical species, with narrow ther-
mal  neutral  zones,  and  arctic  species,  with  broad  thermal 
neutral  zones.  The  researchers  pointed  out  that  the  narrow 
thermal  neutral  zone  of   Homo  sapiens   is  similar  to  that  of 
several  species of rain forest mammals and birds. Meanwhile, 
arctic species, such as the arctic fox, have impressively broad 
 thermal neutral zones. 

 Since the normal body temperature of most endotherms 
varies from about 35 8  to 40 8 C, it is no surprise that this range 
of temperatures falls within the thermal neutral zone of both 
tropical  and  arctic  species.  What  distinguishes  tropical  and 
arctic species is the great tolerance that arctic species have for 
cold. For instance, the arctic fox can tolerate environmental 

 

(a)

temperatures down to  2 30 8 C without showing any increase in 
metabolic rate. Meanwhile the metabolic rate of some tropical 
species  begins  to  increase  when  air  temperature  falls  below 
29 8 C.  Figure 5.24  contrasts the thermal neutral zones of some 
arctic and tropical species.

radiator shown in a. The black arrows on the graph point to the bat’s 
surface temperature at the places indicated by white arrows on the bat 
thermal image (after Reichard et al. 2010).  

 From evolutionary and ecological perspectives, the impor-
tant point of this discussion is that thermoregulation outside 
the thermal neutral zone costs energy that could be otherwise 
directed toward reproduction. How might such energetic costs 
affect the distribution and abundance of organisms in nature?  

  Aquatic Animals 
 Now let’s turn to thermoregulation by aquatic endotherms, where 
the  aquatic  environment  limits  the  possible  ways  organisms 
can regulate their body temperatures. Why is that? First, as we 
have seen, the capacity of water to absorb heat energy without 
changing temperature is about 3,000 times that of air. Second, 

Tropical species maintain a 
constant metabolic rate over a 
narrow range of temperatures.

Arctic species maintain a 
constant metabolic rate over a 
broad range of temperatures.

  Adaptations to the Environment 

conductive and convective heat losses to water are much more 
rapid  than  to  air,  over  20  times  faster  in  still  water  and  up  to 
100 times faster in moving water. Thus, the aquatic organism is 
surrounded by a vast heat sink. The potential for heat loss to this 
heat sink is very great, particularly for gill-breathing species that 
must expose a large respiratory surface in order to extract suf-
ficient oxygen from water. In the face of these environmental dif-
ficulties, only a few aquatic species are truly endothermic. 

 Aquatic  birds  and  mammals,  such  as  penguins,  seals, 
and  whales,  can  be  endothermic  in  an  aquatic  environment 
for  two  major  reasons:  First,  they  are  all  air  breathers  and 
do not expose a large respiratory surface to the surrounding 
water. Second, many endothermic aquatic animals, including 
penguins, seals, and whales, are well insulated from the heat-
sapping  external  environment  by  a  thick  layer  of  fat  while 
others, such as the sea otter, are insulated by a layer of fur that 
traps air. The parts of these animals that are not well insulated, 
principally appendages, are outfitted with  countercurrent heat 
exchangers,   vascular  structures  that  reduce  the  rate  of  heat 
loss to the surrounding aquatic environment.  Figure 5.25  dia-
grams the structure and functioning of a countercurrent heat 
exchanger in the flipper of a dolphin. 

 The lateral swimming muscles of endothermic fish, such 
as tunas and white sharks, are also well supplied with blood 
vessels that function as countercurrent heat exchangers. These 
heat exchangers heat cool arterial blood as it carries oxygen 
to the lateral swimming muscles, and by the time this blood 
delivers its supply of oxygen and nutrients it has been heated 
to the same temperature as the active muscles. On the return 
trip the heat in this warm blood is used to heat the newly arriv-
ing blood and so, when blood exits the swimming muscles, it 
is again approximately the same temperature as the surround-
ing  water.  The  countercurrent  heat  exchangers  of  tuna  are 
efficient enough at conserving heat that these fish can elevate

the temperature of the surrounding water. The anatomy of the 
countercurrent heat exchanger in bluefin tuna muscles is pre-
sented in  figure 5.26 . 

 Francis Carey and his colleagues (Carey 1973) implanted 
devices that would measure and transmit the temperature of 
the  muscles  of  bluefin  tuna  and  of  the  surrounding  water. 
Their tracking boat could usually follow a released fish car-
rying a temperature-sensing implant for a few hours, which 
provided enough time to collect data that revealed a great deal 
about their temperature relations. As one of the monitored fish 
swam through water varying in temperature from 7 8  to 14 8 C, 
the temperature of its swimming muscles remained a constant 
24 8 C. These  results,  shown  in   figure  5.27 ,  demonstrate  that 
a  bluefin  tuna  can  maintain  a  remarkably  constant  muscle 
temperature even in the face of substantial variation in water 
temperature. More recent work has shown that other organs, 
such as the stomach, of bluefin tuna vary in temperature much 
more  than  do  the  swimming  muscles  (Stevens,  Kanwisher, 
and Carey 2000). 

 Now, let’s move from the sea and the giant bluefin tuna, 
which can reach up to 1,000 kg, to land, where we find some 
of the smallest endotherms.  

  Warming Insect Flight Muscles 
 Have you ever gone outside on a cool fall or spring  morning 
when few insects were active, and yet met with bumblebees 
visiting flowers? Were you surprised? While you may have 
taken  the  meeting  for  granted,  these  early  morning  forays 
by  bumblebees  require  some  impressive  physiology.  Most 
insects  use  external  sources  of  energy  to  heat  their  bod-
ies,  but  there  are  some  notable  exceptions.  Bernd  Heinrich 
(1979)  found  that  bumblebees  maintain  the  temperature  of 
their thoraxes, which house the flight muscles, at 30 8  to 37 8 C

regardless  of  air  temperature.  Because  they  can  warm  their 
flight muscles, bumblebees can fly when environmental tem-
peratures  are  as  low  as  0 8 C. A  number  of  other  insects  use 
metabolic heat, H m , to warm their flight muscles, including 
large nocturnal moths. 

 Heinrich (1993) has spent a great deal of his professional 
life studying thermoregulation by insects. Some of the inspira-
tion that launched this work came to him when he was a gradu-
ate  student  recording  the  body  temperatures  of  moths  in  the 
highlands of New Guinea. Heinrich relates how, as he captured 
moths flying to a sheet illuminated by a lantern, air tempera-
tures were about 9 8 C. Despite these low temperatures, some of 
the larger moths captured had thoracic temperatures of 46 8 C, 
9 8 C  higher  than  Heinrich’s  own  body  temperature.  It  was  at 
this point that he became convinced that some insects can ther-
moregulate by endothermic means. However, you don’t have 
to travel to the highlands of New Guinea to meet endothermic 
insects.  Some  of  Heinrich’s  most  elegant  studies  of  thermo-
regulation have been done on moths from temperate latitudes. 
 Studies of temperature regulation by moths began in the 
early 1800s. Many of these studies were focused on moths of 
the  family  Sphingidae,  the  sphinx  moths.  Sphinx  moths  are 
convenient insects for study because many reach impressive 
sizes, large enough to be sometimes mistaken for humming-
birds. Heinrich’s dissertation focused on thermoregulation by 
the sphinx moth  Manduca sexta,  whose large green caterpil-
lars feed on a wide variety of plants, including tobacco and 
tomato plants.  M. sexta  is among the larger sphinx moths and 
weighs 2 to 3 g—which is heavier than some hummingbirds 
and shrews, the smallest of the birds and mammals. 

 Since the nineteenth century, researchers have been aware 
that active sphinx moths have elevated thoracic temperatures. 
These early researchers also knew that temperature increases 
within  the  thorax  were  due  to  activity  of  the  flight  muscles 

Chapter 5

contained  within  the  thorax  that  vibrated  the  wings.  Later 
researchers discovered that during flight, the muscles respon-
sible for the upstroke of the wings and those responsible for 
the  downstroke  contracted  sequentially.   However,   during 
preflight  warm-up,  the  upstroke  and  downstroke  muscles 
 contracted  nearly  simultaneously.  Consequently,  the  wings 
of  a  moth  warming  its  flight  muscles  only  vibrated.  Once 
warmed  up  and  actively  flying,  sphinx  moths  maintained  a 
relatively constant thoracic temperature over a broad range of 
environmental temperatures. 

 Research  prior  to  Heinrich’s  dissertation  had  demon-
strated  clearly  that  sphinx  moths  thermoregulate.  However, 
a significant problem remained. No one knew  how  they did 
it. Phillip Adams and James Heath (1964) proposed that the 
moths  thermoregulate  by  changing  their  metabolic  rate  in 
response  to  changing  environmental  temperatures.  In  terms 
of  our  equation  for  thermoregulation,  Adams  and  Heath 
proposed  that  the  moths  increased  H m   when  environmental 
temperatures fell and decreased H m  when environmental tem-
peratures rose. 

 Several observations led Heinrich to propose an alterna-
tive hypothesis. He proposed that active sphinx moths have a 
fairly constant metabolic rate, and therefore, generate meta-
bolic  heat,  H m ,  at  a  constant  rate.  Heinrich  also  proposed 
that sphinx moths thermoregulate by changing their rates of 
heat  loss  to  the  environment.  In  terms  of  our  equation  for 
 thermoregulation, the moths  decrease  their rate of cooling by 
convection,  H cv ,  and  conduction,  H cd ,  when  environmental 
temperatures fall, and when temperatures rise, sphinx moths 
 increase  their cooling rates. 

 Heinrich tested his hypothesis with a series of pioneer-
ing experiments that demonstrated  M. sexta  cools its thorax 
by using its circulatory system to transport heat to the abdo-
men. In other words, the blood of these moths acts as a cool-
ant. In his first experiment, he immobilized a moth and heated 
its thorax with a narrow beam of light while monitoring the 
temperature of the thorax and abdomen. Because it was nar-
row, the light beam increased radiative heat gain, H r  , of the 
thorax  only.  Heinrich  used  the  beam  to  simulate  metabolic 
heat  production  by  the  flight  muscles.  He  observed  that  the 
thoracic temperature of these heated moths stabilized at about 
44 8 C.  Meanwhile,  their  abdominal  temperatures  gradually 
increased. 

 These  results  indicated  that  heat  within  the  thorax  was 
transferred  to  the  abdomen.  Heinrich  proposed  that  blood 
flowing  from  the  thorax  to  the  abdomen  was  the  means  of 
heat transfer. To confirm this, he conducted a second experi-
ment. He tied off blood flow to the thorax using a fine human 
hair. With this blood flow stopped, flying moths overheated 
and stopped flying. Instead of stabilizing at 44 8 C, the thoracic 
temperatures approached the lethal limit of 46 8 C. An interest-
ing debate between two groups of researchers with competing 
hypotheses was decided by two decisive experiments, which 
are summarized by  figure 5.28 . 

 Endothermic  insects  were  a  surprise  to  many  biolo-
gists.  The  existence  of  endothermic  plants  was  even  more 
surprising.

  Temperature Regulation 
by Thermogenic Plants 
 Roger Knutson (1974, 1979) visited a marsh on a cold Febru-
ary day in northeast Iowa. There he saw eastern skunk cabbage, 
 Symplocarpus foetidus,  emerging from the frozen landscape. 
Each plant was surrounded by a melted circle in the snow. It 
appeared as though the skunk cabbage had  generated enough 
heat to melt its way through the snow. Knutson returned the 
next day with a thermometer and so began a research project 
that produced some surprising observations of thermoregula-
tion by plants. 

 Almost all plants are poikilothermic ectotherms. How-
ever, plants in the family Araceae have the unusual habit of 
using  metabolic  energy  to  heat  their  flowers.  Some  of  the 
temperate species in this mostly tropical family use this abil-
ity to protect their inflorescences from freezing and to attract 
pollinators. One of the most studied of these  temperate spe-
cies is the eastern skunk cabbage, which lives in the decidu-
ous  forests  of  eastern  North America. This  skunk  cabbage 
blooms  from  February  to  March,  when  air  temperatures 
vary between  2 15 8  and 15 8 C. During this period, the inflo-
rescence  of  the  plant,  which  weighs  from  2  to  9  g,  main-
tains  a  temperature  15 8   to  35 8 C  above  air  temperature. As 
Knutson  observed,  this  temperature  is  warm  enough  so 
that  S. foetidus  can melt its way through snow. The plant’s 

inflorescences can maintain these elevated  temperatures for 
up to 14 days. During this period, it  functions as an endo-
thermic organism. 

 How does the skunk cabbage fuel the heating of its inflo-
rescence? It has a large root in which it stores large quantities 
of starch. Some of this starch is translocated to the inflores-
cence, where it is metabolized at a high rate, generating large 
quantities of heat in the process. This heat, besides keeping 
the inflorescence from freezing, may help attract pollinators. 
Various pollinators are attracted to both the warmth and the 
sweetish scent given off by the plant. Some of the biology of 
this interesting plant is summarized in  figure 5.29 . 

 The inflorescence of the skunk cabbage maintains a high 
respiratory rate, equivalent to that of a small mammal of simi-
lar size. However, its metabolic rate is not constant. The plant 
adjusts its metabolic rate to changes in environmental temper-
atures. The metabolic rate increases with decreasing tempera-
ture,  which  increases  the  rate  of  metabolic  heat  production. 
By  adjusting  its  metabolic  rate,  the  plant  can  maintain  its 
inflorescence  at  a  similar  temperature  despite  substantial 
 variation in environmental temperature ( fig. 5.30 ). 

 In this section, we have considered how various organ-
isms  regulate  their  body  temperatures  by  using  external 
sources of energy, internal sources of energy, or both. Ther-
moregulation  is  possible  where  organisms  face  tempera-
tures within their range of tolerance. However, in the face of

 Air temperature has a clear influence on the 

extreme temperatures, thermoregulation may not be a viable 
option. In such circumstances, organisms may turn to a vari-
ety of survival strategies. 

  Concept 5.4 Review 

1.   Why  would  it  be  a  disadvantage  for   Encelia  farinosa
(p. 110) to produce highly reflective, pubescent leaves 
in both hot and cool seasons?  

2.   Can behavioral thermoregulation be precise? What evi-

dence supports your answer?  

     3.   Why are all the endothermic fish relatively large?       

   Many organisms survive extreme temperatures by  entering 
a resting stage.   Think of an environment that is either very 
cold or very hot, perhaps a temperate forest in winter or a des-
ert in the middle of a hot summer’s day. If you have been in 
such an environment you may have noticed less obvious bio-
logical activity than at other times of the year. Many plants are 
dormant, few birds are active, and insects may not be evident. 
Many organisms have evolved ways to avoid extreme environ-
mental temperatures by entering a resting stage. This stage may 
be as simple as resting in a sheltered spot during the heat of 
the day or may involve elaborate physiological and behavioral 
adjustments. Let’s examine some of the ways organisms avoid 
extreme temperatures.  

   Inactivity 
 A simple way to avoid extreme environmental temperatures is 
to seek shelter during the hottest or coldest times of the day. 
Let’s consider some beetles that take shelter during the mid-
dle of the day, when environmental temperatures are too high. 
 Many  organisms  live  on  the  beaches  of  New  Zealand, 
including small, predatory tiger beetles. One species of black 
tiger  beetle,   Neocicindela  perhispida  campbelli,   lives  on 
black  sand  beaches. As  we  saw  earlier  in  the  chapter,  these 
black  sand  beaches  heat  up  rapidly  in  the  morning  sun  and 
reach  higher  temperatures  than  nearby  white  sand  beaches 
(see  fig. 5.4 ). The black beetles that live on these beaches also 
heat  up  quickly.  By  basking  in  the  morning  sun  they  warm 
enough to become active early in the day. However, later in 
the day, they must work very hard to avoid overheating. 

 The  beetles  maintain  their  body  temperature  at  about 
36.4 8 C by shuttling between sun and shade and by facing into 
the  sun  to  orient  themselves  parallel  to  the  sun’s  rays.  The 
beetles also reduce heating by increasing their rate of convec-
tive cooling. They do this by “stilting,” standing on the tips 
of their feet and extending their legs, to get themselves a bit 
higher  into  the  air. With  this  combination  of  behaviors,  the 
beetle maintains its body temperature substantially below the 
temperature of the sand. 

 Thermoregulation becomes difficult by midday, however, 
when sand temperatures may reach 70 8 C. Most of the beetles 
simply avoid these high temperatures by leaving. As shown 
in  figure 5.31 , those beetles that remain active are mostly in 
the shade. 

 Now let’s look at hummingbirds that live in environments 
that  are  cold  at  night.  Maintaining  an  elevated  body  tem-
perature  during  cold  nights  requires  a  great  deal  of  energy.

acceptable levels (data from Hadley, Savill, and Schultz 1992).  

 Tiger beetles’ avoidance of high environmental 

In  some  environments,  hummingbirds  may  save  energy  by 
reducing  their  metabolic  rate  during  the  night  and  allowing 
their body temperature to decrease.  

  Reducing Metabolic Rate 
 Hummingbirds are small birds that depend upon a diet of nec-
tar and insects to maintain a high metabolic rate and a body 
temperature of about 39 8 C. When food is abundant, they main-
tain these high rates throughout the day and night. However, 
when  food  is  scarce  and  night  temperatures  are  cold,  hum-
mingbirds may enter a state of torpor.     Torpor    is a state of low 
metabolic rate and lowered body temperature. During torpor, 
a hummingbird’s body temperature is about 12 8  to 17 8 C, quite 
a reduction from 39 8 C. Because this lower body temperature 
is  a  direct  consequence  of  a  lower  metabolic  rate,  a  hum-
mingbird in torpor saves a lot of energy. How much energy is 
saved? F. L. Carpenter and colleagues (1993) estimated that 
rufus hummingbirds that maintained full body temperature all 
night lost (metabolized) about 0.24 g of fat. They estimated 
that birds in a state of torpor lost only 0.02 g of fat, resulting 
in an energy savings of over 90%. 

 This much was known when William Calder (1994) began 
a study to discover the circumstances under which humming-
birds  use  torpor.  When  he  began  his  work,  there  were  two 
major  hypotheses.  The  “routine”  hypothesis  proposed  that 

hummingbirds go into torpor regularly, perhaps every night. 
The  “emergency-only”  hypothesis  proposed  that  humming-
birds go into torpor only when food supplies are inadequate. 
 Since  wild  hummingbirds  are  difficult  to  follow,  how 
could Calder determine whether they go into torpor at night? 
By  weighing  hummingbirds  just  before  they  went  to  their 
night  roosts  and  then  again  first  thing  in  the  morning,  he 
could estimate the amount of fat metabolized during the night. 
A  hummingbird  in  torpor  would  lose  much  less  weight. To 
weigh  hummingbirds,  Calder  either  captured  them  in  mist 
nets  or  rigged  the  perch  on  a  hummingbird  feeder  with  an 
electronic balance. 

 Calder’s observations of broad-tailed hummingbirds did 
not  support  the  routine  hypothesis.  His  measurements  indi-
cated that hummingbirds generally lost 15 times the weight 
required to meet the energy demands while in torpor. Clearly, 
hummingbirds  usually  have  elevated  metabolic  rates  during 
the night and go into torpor only occasionally. Calder found 
that hummingbirds use torpor under two main circumstances: 
(1) when they arrive at breeding or wintering sites before flow-
ers are abundant, and (2) when their food intake is reduced 
by decreased nectar production by flowers or by storms that 
interfere with their feeding. As with Heinrich’s work on moth 
thermoregulation,  Calder’s  observations  resolved  the  debate 
between two competing hypotheses ( fig. 5.32 ). 

 While  hummingbirds  may  go  into  torpor  for  several 
hours each night, other animals can go into a state of reduced 
metabolism that may last several months. If this state occurs 
mainly in winter, it is called     hibernation    .  If it occurs in sum-
mer,  it  is  called      estivation    .   During  hibernation,  the  body 
temperature of arctic ground squirrels may drop to 2 8 C. The 
metabolic rates of hibernating marmots may fall to 3% of lev-
els during active periods. During estivation, the metabolic rate 
of long-neck turtles may fall to 28% of their normal metabolic 
rate.  Such  reductions  in  metabolic  rate  allow  these  animals 
to survive long arctic and alpine winters or hot, dry periods 
in the desert, during which they must rely entirely on stored 
energy reserves. Under some conditions, even tropical species 
may hibernate.  

  Hibernation by a Tropical Species 
 While most studies of hibernation have focused on temperate 
and arctic species, there are tropical animals that hibernate. 
One of those species is a primate called the fat-tailed dwarf 
lemur,   Cheirogaleus  medius   ( fig.  5.33 ).   C.  medius   lives  in 
the  tropical  dry  forests  of  western  Madagascar,  where  it 
is  active  during  5  months  and  hibernates  for  7  months. As 
its  common  name  implies,   C.  medius   is  a  small  primate, 
with  a  body  length  of  about  20  cm  and  a  tail  of  about  the 
same length. As adults they weigh about 140 g. The tail of 
 C. medius  is a primary site for storing the fat that the species 
uses for energy during its long hibernation.  C. medius  lives 
in trees, sleeping in tree cavities during the day in groups of 
up  to  five  individuals  and  foraging  in  the  canopy  at  night. 
In  contrast  to  its  daytime  roosting  behavior,   C.  medius   is 
entirely solitary while foraging at night. The main foods of

temperature of  C. medius  varies from about 18 8  to 31 8 C. By 
lowering  its  body  temperature,   C.  medius   saves  energy  dur-
ing the food-scarce dry season. As a result of its lower energy 
requirement,  C. medius  is able to live off the fat it stores in 
its  tail  and  in  other  parts  of  the  body.  These  fat  stores  are 
gradually  depleted  as   C.  medius   passes  its  annual  7  months 
of  hibernation.  Fietz  and  her  colleagues  found  that  during 
hibernation the body mass of  C. medius  decreases by approxi-
mately 34%, while the volume of the tail is reduced by nearly 
58%. Studies of hibernation among tropical species, such as 
this one, broaden our understanding of hibernation generally 
and underscore the need of homeothermic animals to access 
adequate  supplies  of  energy  for  maintaining  their  relatively 
constant  body  temperatures.  Hibernation,  and  its  associated 
energy  savings,  has  selective  advantage  when  energy  sup-
plies are inadequate for supplying these metabolic needs. This 
appears to be the case in cold as well as tropical regions. 

 The  temperature  relations  of  organisms,  a  fundamental 
aspect of ecology, is attracting increased attention. This inter-
est is fueled by concerns about the ecological consequences 
of global warming. Though we discuss this issue in detail in 
chapter 23, in the Applications section we look at how stud-
ies of temperature relations and climatic warming are helping 
explain the local extinction of a species. 

  Concept 5.5 Review 

      1.   Why  don’t  hummingbirds  save  energy  by  going  into 
torpor at night even when food supplies are abundant? 
In other words, what would be a possible disadvantage 
of routine, nightly torpor?  

     2.   Why might the frequency of torpor and hibernation be 
more  common  among  animals  in  tropical  dry  forest 
compared to those living in tropical rain forests?    

  Figure 5.33  
inhabits tropical dry forests in western Madagascar, where it hibernates 
through most of the dry season.  

 The fat-tailed dwarf lemur,  Cheirogaleus medius,  

 C. medius  are fruits and flowers but it also eats some insects 
and small vertebrate animals such as chameleons. 

 Why  do  these  tropical  primates  hibernate?  Photos  of 
tropical dry forest landscape during wet and dry seasons and 
climate diagrams of tropical dry forest provide a suggestion 
(see figs. 2.12 and 2.13). During the wet season, tropical dry 
forests are very productive of the fruits and flowers eaten by 
 C. medius.  However, during the dry months, these foods are 
scarce.  The  forests  inhabited  by   C.  medius   in  Madagascar 
have a dry season that lasts for 8 months, which for  C. medius  
represents a long, lean time. 

 The physiology of hibernation by free-ranging  C. medius  
was studied by Joanna Fietz, Frieda Tataruch, Kathrin Daus-
mann, and Jörg Ganzhorn (2003) in the Kirindy forest of west-
ern Madagascar. This team of researchers from universities in 
Germany and Austria found that during hibernation, the body

 Local Extinction of a Land Snail 

in an Urban Heat Island 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 5.21  Outline changes in the distribution of the snail 
Arianta arbustorum around Basel, Switzerland, 
between 1900 and 1990.

 5.22  Explain how urbanization generally creates a “heat 

island.”

 5.23  Review the evidence that temperature changes 

around the city of Basel are responsible for local 
extinctions of the snail Arianta arbustorum.

 Between 1906 and 1908, a Ph.D. candidate named G. Bollinger 
(1909) studied land snails in the vicinity of Basel, Switzerland. 
Eighty-five years later, Bruno and Anette Baur (1993) carefully 
resurveyed Bollinger’s study sites near Basel for the presence of 
land snails. In the process, they found that at least one snail spe-
cies,  Arianta arbustorum,  had disappeared from several of the 
sites. This discovery led the Baurs to explore the mechanisms 
that may have produced extinction of these local populations. 
A. arbustorum  is a common land snail in meadows, for-
ests, and other moist, vegetated habitats in northwestern and 
central Europe. The species lives at altitudes up to 2,700 m 
in the Alps. The Baurs report that the snail is sexually mature 
at 2 to 4 years and may live up to 14 years. Adult snails have 
shell  diameters  of  16  to  20  mm. The  species  is  hermaphro-
ditic. Though individuals generally mate with other  A. arbus-
torum,  they can fertilize their own eggs. Adults produce one 
to three batches of 20 to 80 eggs each year. They deposit their 
eggs in moss, under plant litter, or in the soil. Eggs generally 
hatch in 2 to 4 weeks, depending upon temperature. The egg 
is an especially sensitive stage in the life cycle of land snails. 
A. arbustorum  often lives alongside  Cepea nemoralis,  a land 
snail with a broader geographic distribution that extends from 
southern Scandinavia to the Iberian peninsula. 

 How  did  the  Baurs  document  local  extinctions  of 
A. arbustorum?  If you think about it a bit, you will probably 
realize that it is usually easier to determine the presence of a 
species than its absence. If you do not encounter a species dur-
ing a survey, it may be that you just didn’t look hard enough. 
Fortunately, the Baurs had over 13 years of experience doing 
fieldwork on  A. arbustorum  and knew its natural history well. 
For instance, they knew that it is best to search for the snails 
after rainstorms, when up to 70% of the adult population is 
active.  Consequently,  the  Baurs  searched  Bollinger’s  study 
sites  after  heavy  rains.  They  concluded  that  the  snail  was 
absent at a site only after two 2-hour surveys failed to turn up 
either a living individual or an empty shell of the species. 

 The Baurs found  A. arbustorum  still living at 13 of the 
29  sites  surveyed  by  Bollinger  near  Basel.  Eleven  of  these 
remaining populations lived in deciduous forests and the other 
two lived on grassy riverbanks. However, the Baurs could not 

find the snail at 16 sites. Eight of these sites had been urban-
ized,  which  made  the  habitat  unsuitable  for  any  land  snails 
because natural vegetation had been removed. Between 1900 
and 1990 the urbanized area of Basel had increased by 500%. 
However, the eight other sites where  A. arbustorum  had dis-
appeared were still covered by vegetation that appeared suit-
able.  Four  of  these  sites  were  covered  by  deciduous  forest, 
three were on riverbanks, and one was on a railway embank-
ment. These vegetated sites also supported populations of five 
other land snail species, including  C. nemoralis.  

 What caused the extinction of  A. arbustorum  at sites that 
still supported other snails? The Baurs compared the charac-
teristics of these sites with those of the sites where  A. arbus-
torum  had persisted. They found no difference between these 
two  groups  of  sites  in  regard  to  slope,  percent  plant  cover, 
height of vegetation, distance from water, or number of other 
land snail species present. The first major difference the Baurs 
uncovered was in altitude. The sites where  A. arbustorum  was 
extinct had an average altitude of 274 m. The places where it 
survived had an average altitude of 420 m. The places where 
the snail had survived were also cooler. 

 A thermal image of the landscape taken from a satellite 
showed  that  surface  temperatures  in  summer  around  Basel 
ranged from about 17 8  to 32.5 8 C. Surface temperatures where 
A.  arbustorum   had  survived  averaged  approximately  22 8 C, 
while the sites where the species had gone extinct had surface 
temperatures  that  averaged  approximately  25 8 C.  The  sites 
where  the  snail  was  extinct  were  also  much  closer  to  very 
hot areas with temperatures greater than 29 8 C.   Figure 5.34  is 
based on the Baurs’ thermal image of the area around Basel 
and shows where the snail was extinct and where it persisted. 
 The Baurs attributed the higher temperatures at the eight 
sites where the snail is extinct to heating by thermal radiation 
from the urbanized areas of the city. Buildings and pavement 
store more heat than vegetation. In addition, the cooling effect 
of  evaporation  from  vegetation  is  lost  when  an  area  is  built 
over. Increased heat storage and reduced cooling make urban-
ized landscapes thermal islands. Heat energy stored in urban 
centers  is  transferred  to  the  surrounding  landscape  through 
thermal radiation, H r  . 

 The  Baurs  documented  higher  temperatures  at  the  sites 
near  Basel  where   A.  arbustorum   is  extinct  and  identified  a 
well-studied  mechanism  that  could  produce  the  higher  tem-
peratures of these sites. However, are the temperature differ-
ences they observed sufficient to exclude  A. arbustorum  from 
the warmer sites? The researchers compared the temperature 
relations  of   A.  arbustorum   and   C.  nemoralis   to  find  some 
clues. They concentrated their studies on the influence of tem-
perature on reproduction by these two snail species. 

 The  eggs  of  each  species  were  incubated  at  four 
temperatures—19 8 , 22 8 , 25 8 , and 29 8 C. Notice that these tem-
peratures fall within the range measured by the satellite image 
(see  fig. 5.34 ). The eggs of both species hatched at a high rate at 
19 8 C. However, at higher temperatures, their eggs hatched at sig-
nificantly lower rates. At 22 8 C, less than 50% of  A. arbustorum
eggs hatched, while the eggs of  C. nemoralis  continued to hatch 
at a high rate. At 25 8 C, no  A. arbustorum  eggs hatched, while 
approximately 50% of the  C. nemoralis  eggs hatched. At 29 8 C,

 Temperature and hatching success of two snail 

the  hatching  of   C.  nemoralis   eggs  was  also  greatly  reduced. 
  Figure 5.35  summarizes the results of this hatching experiment. 
 The results of this study show that the eggs of  A. arbus-
torum  are more sensitive to higher temperatures than are the 
eggs  of   C.  nemoralis.   This  greater  thermal  sensitivity  can 
explain  why   A.  arbustorum   is  extinct  at  some  sites,  while  
C.  nemoralis   survived.  These  results  also  suggest  that  cli-
matic warming can lead to the local extinction of species. As 
we  face  the  prospect  of  warming  on  a  global  scale,  studies 
of  temperature  relations  will  assume  greater  importance.  In 
chapter 6, we look at a related topic, water relations.     

  Macroclimate interacts with the local landscape to  produce 
microclimatic variation in temperature.   The sun’s uneven 
heating of the earth’s surface and earth’s permanent tilt on its 
axis  produce  macroclimate.  Macroclimate  interacts  with  the 
local landscape—mainly altitude, aspect, vegetation, color of 
the ground, and small-scale structural features such as boul-
ders  and  burrows—to  produce  microclimates.  For  the  indi-
vidual  organism,  macroclimate  may  be  less  significant  than 
microclimate. The physical nature of water limits temperature 
variation in aquatic environments. 

  Adapting to one set of environmental conditions gen-
erally  reduces  a  population’s  fitness  in  other  environ-
ments.  The  principle  of  allocation,  which  is  supported  by 
research on bacterial populations, proposes that evolutionary 
trade-offs are inevitable, since organisms have access to lim-
ited amounts of energy.  

  Most  species  perform  best  in  a  fairly  narrow  range 
of temperatures.   The influence of temperature on the per-
formance of organisms begins at the molecular level, where 

extreme  temperatures  impair  the  functioning  of  enzymes. 
Rates of photosynthesis and microbial activity generally peak 
in a narrow range of temperatures and are much lower outside 
of  this  optimal  temperature  range.  How  temperature  affects 
the  performance  of  organisms  often  corresponds  to  the  cur-
rent distributions of species and their evolutionary histories. 

  Many organisms have evolved ways to compensate for 
variations in environmental temperature by regulating body 
temperature.   Temperature  regulation  balances  heat  gain 
against heat loss. Plants and ectothermic animals use morphol-
ogy and behavior to modify rates of heat exchange with the envi-
ronment. Birds and mammals rely heavily on metabolic energy 
to regulate body temperature. The physical nature of the aquatic 
environment reduces the possibilities for temperature regulation 
by  aquatic  organisms.  Most  endothermic  aquatic  species  are 
air breathers. Some organisms, mainly flying insects and some 
large marine fish, improve performance by selectively heating 
parts of their anatomy. The energetic requirements of thermo-
regulation may influence the geographic distribution of species. 

124 

Section II 

  Adaptations to the Environment 

  Many  organisms  survive  extreme  temperatures  by 
entering a resting stage.   This stage may be as simple as rest-
ing in a sheltered spot during the heat of the day or may involve 
elaborate physiological adjustments. Hummingbirds may enter 
a state of torpor, a state of low metabolic rate and lowered body 
temperature, when food is scarce and night temperatures cold. 
Other animals can go into a state of reduced metabolism that 
may last several months. If this state occurs mainly in winter, it 
is called hibernation. If it occurs in summer, it is called estiva-
tion. Such reductions in metabolic rate allow these animals to 

survive  extreme  environmental  conditions  during  which  they 
must rely entirely on stored energy reserves. 

 Long-term  studies  of  populations  of  land  snails  around 
Basel,  Switzerland,  have  documented  local  extinctions  of 
these land snails. These extinctions are attributable to habitat 
destruction and climatic warming. The results of these studies 
suggest that climatic warming can lead to the local extinction 
of  species. As  we  face  the  prospect  of  climatic  warming  at 
a  global  scale,  studies  of  temperature  relations  will  assume 
greater importance.

  Review Questions 

     1.  Many  species  of  plants  and  animals  that  are  associated  with 
boreal forests also occur on mountains far to the south of the 
boreal  forests.  Using  what  you  have  learned  about  microcli-
mates, predict how aspect and elevation would influence their 
distributions on these southern mountains.  

    2.  Imagine a desert beetle that uses behavior to regulate its body 
temperature above 35 8 C. How might this beetle’s use of micro-
climates  created  by  shrubs,  burrows,  and  bare  ground  change 
with the season?  

    3.  J. L. Mosser and colleagues (1974) found that populations of 
the  bacterium   Sulfolobus   living  at  different  temperatures  had 
different optimal temperatures for sulfur oxidation. Use natural 
selection to explain these patterns. Design an experiment to test 
your explanation. Assume you can create artificial springs and 
regulate their temperature as you like.  

    4.   Figure  5.8   shows  how  temperature  influences  the  activity  of 
acetylcholinesterase in rainbow trout. Assuming that the other 
enzymes of rainbow trout show similar responses to tempera-
ture, how would trout swimming speed change as environmen-
tal temperature increased above 20 8 C?  

    5.  The  Applications  section  reviews  how  the  studies  of  Bruno 
Baur and Anette Baur (1993) have documented the local extinc-
tion of the land snail  Arianta arbustorum.  Their research also 
shows that these extinctions may be due to reduced egg hatch-
ing at higher temperatures. Do these results show conclusively 
that the direct effect of higher temperatures on hatching success 
is responsible for the local extinctions of  A. arbustorum?  Pro-
pose and justify alternative hypotheses. Be sure you take into 
account all of the observations of the Baurs.  

    6.  Butterflies, which are ectothermic and diurnal, are found from 
the tropical rain forest to the Arctic. They can elevate their body 
temperatures  by  basking  in  sunlight.  How  would  the  percent-
age of time butterflies spend basking versus flying change with 
latitude? Would  the  amount  of  time  butterflies  spend  basking 
change with daily changes in temperature?  

    7.  When  we  reviewed  how  some  organisms  use  torpor,  hiberna-
tion,  and  estivation  to  avoid  extreme  temperatures,  we  dis-
cussed the idea of energy savings. However, organisms do not 
always behave in a way that saves energy. For instance, when 
food is abundant hummingbirds do not go into torpor at night. 
This suggests that there may be some disadvantages associated 
with torpor. What are some of those potential disadvantages?  

    8.  The section on avoiding temperature extremes focused mainly 
on animals. What are some of the ways in which plants avoid 
temperature  extremes?  Bring  cold  and  hot  environments 
into  your  discussion.  Some  of  the  natural  history  included  in 
 chapter 2 might be useful as you formulate an answer.  

    9.  Some plants and grasshoppers in hot environments have reflec-
tive  body  surfaces,  which  make  their  radiative  heat  gain,  H r  , 
less than it would be otherwise. If you were to design a tiger 
beetle  that  could  best  cope  with  thermal  conditions  on  black 
beaches (see  fig. 5.4 ), what color would it be? The beetles on 
the black beaches of New Zealand are black, and the beetles on 
the white beaches are white. What do the matches between the 
color of these beetles and their beaches tell us about the relative 
roles of thermoregulation and predation pressure in determining 
beetle color? What does this example imply about the ability of 
natural selection to “optimize” the characteristics of organisms?  
   10.  In most of the examples discussed in chapter 5, we saw a close 
match between the characteristics of organisms and their envi-
ronment. However, natural selection does not always produce 
an optimal, or even a good, fit of organisms to their environ-
ments. To verify this you need only reflect on the fact that most 
of the species that have existed are now extinct. What are some 
of the reasons for a mismatch between organisms and environ-
ments?  Develop  your  explanation  using  the  environment,  the 
characteristics of organisms, and the nature of natural selection.

   A black-backed jackal,  Canis mesomelas,  takes a drink at a water hole 
in Botswana. As a relatively small predator, the black-backed jackal 
takes a risk each time it visits a water hole, where it may become prey 
for the larger predators, such as leopards, with which it shares the 
southern African landscape. It is a risk that must be taken, however, 
since the jackal cannot live without water.

temperature conditions, in which the Sonoran Desert 
cicada, Diceroprocta apache, emits its buzzing call.

 6.2  List the research questions that Eric Toolson con-

sidered as he went about collecting Sonoran Desert 
cicadas.

W ater  plays  a  central  role  in  the  lives  of  all  organ-

isms. However, water acquisition and conservation 
are  particularly  critical  for  desert  organisms.  As 
a consequence, many ecologists studying water relations have 
focused  their  attention  on  desert  species.  The  steady  buzzing 
of the Sonoran Desert cicada,  Diceroprocta apache,  seemed to 
amplify the withering heat. Air temperature in the shade hovered 
around 46 8 C, and the ground surface temperature was over 70 8 C. 
All other animals had taken refuge from the desert heat. Nothing 

125

126 

Section II 

  Adaptations to the Environment

else called, and nothing moved, except a lone biologist with an 
insect net who stalked in the direction of the calling cicada. 

 The  biologist  was  Eric  Toolson.  Toolson  was  well 
acquainted with the calls of all the cicadas in the region and 
he knew their natural history. He knew when they were active, 
where they fed, and their natural enemies. Toolson associated 
the call of  Diceroprocta  with the hottest hours of the desert 
day, when air temperatures often exceeded the lethal limit for 
the  species.  His  goal  was  to  understand  the  ecology  of  this 
extraordinary  cicada.  If  Toolson  could  capture  the  calling 
cicada,  he  would  put  it  in  an  environmental  chamber  in  his 
laboratory and measure its body temperature and water loss 
rates under a variety of conditions. Later, he would release it 
to resume its midday serenade. 

 Questions raced through Toolson’s mind as he made his 
way  through  the  shimmering  desert  air  toward  the  cicada. 
Above  all,  how  could  this  species  be  active  in  apparently 
lethal  air  temperatures? We  might  ask  the  same  question  of 
Toolson himself. How did he maintain a body temperature of 
approximately 37 8 C in this desert heat? Humans evaporatively 
cool  by  sweating.  If  we  placed  humidity  sensors  just  above 
Toolson’s skin, they would show that he sweated profusely as 
he picked his way through the cactus. To keep from becom-
ing dehydrated, he took frequent drinks from the water bottle 
at  his  side. This  enabled  him  to  maintain  sufficient  internal 
water and continue to evaporatively cool by sweating. 

 During his pauses to drink, more questions came. Did the 
cicada keep cool by using small, shady microclimates in the 
mesquite tree from which it called? Did the cicada somehow 
manage  to  evaporatively  cool?  This  seemed  unlikely,  since 
biologists had long assumed that insects were too small and 
vulnerable to water loss to do so. If  Diceroprocta  did evapora-
tively cool, how did it avoid desiccating in the desert heat? It 
did not, like Toolson, have a water bottle strapped to its waist. 
 As Toolson stalked the cicada, he pursued an even greater 
prize:  an  understanding  of  how   Diceroprocta   can  regulate 
the temperature and water content of its body while living in 
such an extreme environment. This second pursuit would lead 
Toolson to discover an unsuspected physiological process in 
these  desert  insects.  Like  Bernd  Heinrich,  who  had  discov-
ered the mechanisms by which sphinx moths thermoregulate 
(see chapter 5, pp. 116–117), Toolson and his students, Stacy 
Kaser and Jon Hastings, would be the first to comprehend a bit 
of nature that had escaped the notice of all researchers before 
them.  Few  scientists  make  such  a  fundamental  discovery. 
Those that do never forget the thrill.  Figure 6.1  summarizes 
the  extreme  physical  conditions  under  which   Diceroprocta  
lives that inspired Toolson and his colleagues to study its ecol-
ogy (Toolson 1987; Toolson and Hadley 1987). 

 Before  we  discuss  the  ecology  of  these  desert  cicadas, 
we  need  to  introduce  some  background  information.  Water 
and life on earth are closely linked. The high water content 
of  most  organisms,  which  ranges  from  about  50%  to  90%, 
reflects life’s aquatic origins. Life on earth originated in salty 
aquatic environments and is built around biochemistry within 
an aquatic medium. To survive and reproduce, organisms must 
maintain appropriate internal concentrations of water and dis-
solved substances. To maintain these internal concentrations, 

Air temperature of 468C 
is higher than lethal 
maximum for the cicada.

Falling to the ground, 
with a temperature of 
708C, would be certain 
death for the cicada.

How does the cicada remain 
active when environmental 
temperatures exceed its lethal 
maximum?

  Figure 6.1  
is active when air temperatures appear to be lethal for the species.  

 An ecological puzzle: the cicada,  Diceroprocta apache,  

organisms must balance water losses to the environment with 
water intake. How organisms maintain this water balance is 
called their water relations, which is the subject of chapter 6. 
 In  some  environments,  organisms  face  the  problem  of 
water loss. Elsewhere, water streams in from the environment. 
The problem of maintaining proper water balance is especially 
strong for those organisms, such as  Diceroprocta,  that live in 
arid terrestrial environments. A parallel challenge faces organ-
isms that live in aquatic environments with a high salinity. In 
these extreme environments, the water relations of organisms 
stand out in bold relief. However, most organisms must expend 
energy to maintain their internal pool of water. In the study of 
relationships between organisms and the environment, which 
we call ecology, the study of water relations is fundamental.

   6.1  Water Availability 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 6.3  Compare relative humidity, water vapor pressure, satu-
ration water vapor pressure, and vapor pressure deficit.
 6.4  Diagram the movements of salts and water between 
the surrounding environment and aquatic organisms 
that are isosmotic, hyperosmotic, and hypoosmotic.

 6.5  Explain, using gradients in water potential, the 

movement of water from the soil, through a plant, 
and to the atmosphere.

   Concentration gradients influence the movement of water 
between an organism and its environment.   The tendency 
of water to move down concentration gradients and the mag-
nitude  of  those  gradients  from  an  organism  to  its  environ-
ment  determine  whether  an  organism  tends  to  lose  or  gain 
water  from  the  environment.  To  understand  the  water  rela-
tions of organisms, we first review the basic physical behav-
ior of water in terrestrial and aquatic environments. 

 In chapter 2, we saw that water availability on land var-
ies tremendously, from the tropical rain forest with abundant 
moisture throughout the year (see fig. 2.10) to hot deserts with 
year-round drought (see fig. 2.19). In chapter 3, we reviewed 
the considerable variation in salinity among aquatic environ-
ments, ranging from the dilute waters of tropical rivers drain-
ing  highly  weathered  landscapes  to  hypersaline  lakes.  The 
majority  of  aquatic  environments,  including  the  oceans,  fall 
somewhere between these extremes. Salinity, as we shall see, 
reflects the relative “aridity” of aquatic environments. 

 These preliminary descriptions in chapters 2 and 3 do not 
include  the  situations  faced  by  individual  organisms  within 
their  microclimates—microclimates  such  as  those  experi-
enced by a desert animal that lives at an oasis, where it has 
access to abundant moisture, or a rain forest plant that lives in 
the forest canopy, where it is exposed to full tropical sun and 
drying winds. As with temperature, to understand the water 
relations of an organism we must consider its microclimate, 
including the amount of water in the environment.  

  Water Content of Air 
 As we saw when we reviewed the hydrologic cycle in  chapter 3, 
water vapor is continuously added to air as water evaporates 
from the surfaces of oceans, lakes, and rivers. On land, evapo-
ration also accounts for much of the water lost by organisms. 
The potential for such evaporative water loss depends upon the 
temperature and water content of the air around the organisms. 
As the amount of water vapor in the surrounding air increases, 
the  water  concentration  gradient  from  organisms  to  the  air 
is reduced and the rate at which organisms lose water to the 
atmosphere decreases. This is the reason that evaporative air 
coolers work poorly in humid climates, where the water con-
tent of air is high. These mechanical systems work best in arid 
climates, where there is a steep gradient of water concentration 
from the evaporative cooler to the air. A steep water concentra-
tion gradient is conducive to a high rate of evaporation. 

 We know how temperature is measured, but how is the 
water content of air measured? The quantity of water vapor 
in  air  can  be  expressed  in  relative  terms.  Since  air  is  rarely 
completely saturated with water vapor, we can use its degree 
of  saturation  as  a  relative  measure  of  water  content.  The 
most familiar measure of the water content of air is      relative 
humidity    ,  defined as:   

Relative humidity 5   

_________________________ 
  
Saturation water vapor density

  

Water vapor density

    3 100  

 The actual amount of water in air is measured directly as the 
mass of water vapor per unit volume of air. This quantity, the 
 water vapor density,  is the numerator in the relative humidity 
equation and is given either as milligrams of water per liter 
of air (mg H 2 O/L) or as grams of water per cubic meter of air 
(g  H 2 O/m 3 ). The  maximum  quantity  of  water  vapor  that  air 
at a particular temperature can contain is its  saturation water 
vapor density,  the denominator in the relative humidity equa-
tion. Saturation water vapor density increases with tempera-
ture, as you can see from the red curve in  figure 6.2 . 

 One of the most useful ways of expressing the quantity of 
water in air is in terms of the pressure it exerts. If we express 
the water content of air in terms of pressure, we can use similar 
units to consider the water relations of organisms in air, soil, 
and water. Using pressure as a common currency to represent 

Water vapor in air can be 
measured either as grams of 
vapor per cubic meter of air…

…or by the pressure 
exerted by the water 
vapor in air.

Temperature (8C)

At low temperatures, air is 
saturated by low quantities 
of water vapor and water 
vapor pressure is low.

As temperature increases, the 
amount of water vapor in air at 
saturation and saturation water 
vapor pressure increase.

Section II 

  Adaptations to the Environment

water relations in very different environments helps us unify 
our understanding of this very important area of ecology. We 
usually think in terms of  total atmospheric pressure,  the pres-
sure exerted by all the gases in air, but you can also calculate 
the partial pressures due to individual atmospheric gases such 
as  oxygen,  nitrogen,  or  water  vapor. We  call  this  last  quan-
tity      water vapor pressure    .  At sea level, atmospheric pressure 
averages approximately 760 mm of mercury, the height of a 
column  of  mercury  supported  by  the  combined  force  (pres-
sure)  of  all  the  gas  molecules  in  the  atmosphere. The  inter-
national  convention  for  representing  water  vapor  pressure, 
however, is in terms of the pascal (Pa), where 1 Pa is 1 newton 
of force per square meter. Using this convention, 760 mm of 
mercury, or one atmosphere of pressure, equals approximately 
101,300  Pa,  101.3  kilopascals  (kPa),  or  0.101  megapascals 
(MPa  5  10 6  Pa). 

 The pressure exerted by the water vapor in air that is satu-
rated with water is called     saturation water vapor pressure    .  
As the black curve in  figure 6.2  shows, this pressure increases 
with temperature and closely parallels the increase in satura-
tion water vapor density shown by the red curve. 

 We  can  also  use  water  vapor  pressure  to  represent  the 
 relative  saturation of air with water. You calculate this mea-
sure,  called  the      vapor  pressure  deficit    ,   as  the  difference 
between  the  actual  water  vapor  pressure  and  the  saturation 
water vapor pressure at a particular temperature. In terrestrial 

environments, water flows from organisms to the atmosphere 
at  a  rate  influenced  by  the  vapor  pressure  deficit  of  the  air 
surrounding the organism.  Figure 6.3  shows the relative rates 
of water loss by an organism exposed to air with a low versus 
high vapor pressure deficit. Again, one of the most useful fea-
tures of vapor pressure deficit is that it is expressed in units of 
pressure, generally kilopascals. 

 Water Movement 
in Aquatic Environments 
 In aquatic environments, water moves down its concentration 
gradient. It may sound silly to speak of the amount of water in 
an aquatic environment but, as we saw in chapter 3, all aquatic 
environments  contain  dissolved  substances. These  dissolved 
substances, however slightly, dilute the water. While ocean-
ographers and limnologists (those who study bodies of fresh-
water) generally focus on salt content, or salinity, we take the 
opposite point of view in order to build a consistent perspec-
tive  for  considering  water  relations  in  air,  water,  and  soil. 
From  this  perspective,  water  is  more  concentrated  in  fresh-
water environments than in the oceans. The oceans, in turn, 
contain more water per liter than do saline lakes such as the 
Dead Sea or the Great Salt Lake. The relative concentration 
of water in each of these environments strongly influences the 
biology of the organisms that live in them. 

The vapor pressure deficit (vpd) indicates the gradient in 
water concentration from a terrestrial organism to the air.  
A higher vpd indicates a steeper concentration gradient.

A high vpd indicates that the 
water vapor content of air is 
well below saturation. 

A low vpd indicates that the 
water vapor content of air is 
near saturation.

Evaporation

Evaporation

Where the vpd is high, the 
rate of evaporative water 
loss by organisms is higher.

Where the vpd is low, the 
rate of evaporative water 
loss by organisms is lower.

  Figure 6.3  

 The potential for evaporative water loss by terrestrial organisms increases as vapor pressure deficit increases.  

 

Chapter 6 

  Water Relations 

129

 The body fluids of all organisms contain water and sol-
utes, including inorganic ions and amino acids. We can think 
of aquatic organisms and the environment that surrounds them 
as two aqueous solutions separated by a selectively permeable 
membrane.  If  the  internal  environment  of  the  organism  and 
the external environment differ in concentrations of water and 
salts, these substances will tend to move down their concen-
tration gradients. This movement is the process of      diffusion    .  
We give the diffusion of water across a semipermeable mem-
brane a special name, however:     osmosis    .  

 In the aquatic environment, water moving down its con-
centration gradient produces osmotic pressure. Osmotic pres-
sure,  like  vapor  pressure,  can  be  expressed  in  pascals.  The 
strength  of  the  osmotic  pressure  across  a  semipermeable 
membrane, such as the gills of a fish, depends upon the differ-
ence in water concentration across the membrane. Larger dif-
ferences, between organism and environment, generate higher 
osmotic pressures. 

 Aquatic organisms generally live in one of three environ-
mental circumstances. Organisms with body fluids containing 
the  same  concentration  of  water  and  solutes  as  the  external 
environment are     isosmotic    .  Organisms with body fluids with 
a higher concentration of water (lower solute concentration) 
than the external medium are     hypoosmotic    and tend to lose 
water to the environment. Those with body fluids with a lower 
concentration of water (higher solute concentration) than the 
external medium are     hyperosmotic    and are subject to water 
flooding  inward  from  the  environment.  In  the  face  of  these 
osmotic pressures, aquatic organisms must expend energy to 
maintain  a  proper  internal  environment.  How  much  energy 
the organism must expend depends upon the magnitude of the 
osmotic pressure between them and the environment and the 
permeability  of  their  body  surfaces.   Figure  6.4   summarizes 
the  movement  of  water  and  salts  into  and  out  of  isosmotic, 
hyperosmotic, and hypoosmotic organisms. 

  Water Movement 
between Soils and Plants 
 On land, water flows from the organism to the atmosphere at a 
rate influenced by the vapor pressure deficit of the air surround-
ing the organism. In the aquatic environment, water may flow 
either to or from the organism, depending on the relative con-
centrations of water and solutes in body fluids and the surround-
ing medium. But here, too, water flows down its concentration 
gradient. Water moving from the soil through a plant and into the 
atmosphere flows down a gradient of     water potential    .  We can 
define water potential as the capacity of water to do work. Flow-
ing water has the capacity to do work, such as turning the water 
wheel of an old-fashioned water mill or the turbines of a hydro-
electric plant. The capacity of water to do work depends upon 
its free energy content. Water flows from positions of higher to 
lower free energy. Under the influence of gravity, water flows 
downhill from a position of higher free energy, at the top of the 
hill, to a position of lower free energy, at the bottom of the hill. 
 In the section “Water Movement in Aquatic Environments,” 
we saw that water flows down its concentration gradient, from 

In an isosmotic aquatic 
organism, internal 
concentrations of water 
and salt equal their 
concentrations in the 
environment.

Salts and water diffuse 
at approximately equal 
rates into and out of an 
isosmotic organism.

measurable  “osmotic  pressure”  generated  by  water  flowing 
down  these  concentration  gradients  shows  that  water  flow-
ing  in  response  to  osmotic  gradients  has  the  capacity  to  do 
work. We  measure  water  potential,  like  vapor  pressure  defi-
cit  and  osmotic  pressure,  in  pascals,  usually  megapascals 
(MPa  5  Pa  3  10 6 ). By convention, water potential is repre-
sented by the symbol c (psi), and the water potential of pure 
water is set at 0. In nature, water potentials are generally nega-
tive.  Figure 6.5  shows that water is flowing down a gradient 
of  water  potential  that  goes  from  a  slightly  negative  water

 Water potentials decrease (become more negative) from 

potential  in  the  soil  through  the  moderately  negative  water 
potentials  of  the  plant  to  the  highly  negative  water  potential 
of dry air. 

 Now  let’s  look  at  some  of  the  mechanisms  involved  in 
producing a gradient of water potential such as that shown in 
 figure 6.5 . We can express the water potential of a solution as:   

c 5 csolutes 

c solutes  is the  reduction  in water potential due to dissolved sub-
stances, which is a negative number. 

 Within small spaces, such as the interior of a plant cell or 
the pore spaces within soil, other forces, called     matric forces    ,  
are  also  significant.  Matric  forces  are  a  consequence  of 
water’s tendency to adhere to the walls of containers such as 
cell walls or the soil particles lining a soil pore. Matric forces 
lower  water  potential.  The  water  potential  for  fluids  within 
plant cells is approximately:   

cplant 5 csolutes 1 cmatric 

In this expression,  c matric  is the  reduction  in water potential 
due  to  matric  forces  within  plant  cells.  At  the  level  of  the 
whole  plant,  another  force  is  generated  as  water  evaporates 
from the air spaces within leaves into the atmosphere. Evapo-
ration of water from leaves generates a negative pressure, or 
tension,  on  the  column  of  water  that  extends  from  the  leaf 

through  the  plant  all  the  way  down  to  its  roots.  This  nega-
tive pressure reduces the water potential of plant fluids still 
further. 

 So, the water potential of plant fluids is affected by sol-
utes,  matric  forces,  and  the  negative  pressures  exerted  by 
evaporation. Consequently, we can represent the water poten-
tial of plant fluids as:   

cplant 5 csolutes 1 cmatric 1 cpressure 

Here again, c pressure  is the  reduction  in water potential due to 
negative pressure created by water evaporating from leaves. 

 Meanwhile, the solute content of soil water is often so low 
that soil matric forces account for most of soil water potential:   

csoil > cmatric 

Matric  forces  vary  considerably  from  one  soil  to  another, 
depending primarily upon soil texture and pore size. Coarser 
soils,  such  as  sands  and  loams,  with  larger  pore  sizes  exert 
lower matric forces, while fine clay soils, with smaller pore 
sizes, exert higher matric forces. So, while clay soils can hold 
a higher quantity of water compared to sandy soils, the higher 
matric forces within clay soils bind that water more tightly. 
As long as the water potential of plant tissues is less than the 
water potential of the soil, c plant  , c soil , water flows from the 
soil to the plant. 

 The higher water potential of soil water compared to the 
water potential of roots induces water to flow from the soil 
into plant roots. As water enters roots from the surrounding 
soil,  it  joins  a  column  of  water  that  extends  from  the  roots 
through  the  water-conducting  cells,  or  xylem,  of  the  stem 
to the leaves. Hydrogen bonds between adjacent water mol-
ecules bind the water molecules in this water column together. 
Consequently, as water molecules at the upper end of this col-
umn evaporate into the air at the surfaces of leaves, they exert 
tension, or negative pressure, on the entire water column. This 
negative pressure helps power uptake of water by terrestrial 
plants.  Figure 6.6  summarizes the mechanisms underlying the 
flow of water from soil to plants. 

 As plants draw water from the soil, they soon deplete the 
water held in the larger soil pore spaces, leaving only water 
held  in  the  smaller  pores.  Within  these  smaller  soil  pores, 
 matric  forces  are  greater  than  in  the  larger  pores.  Conse-
quently,  as  soil  dries,  soil  water  potential  decreases  and  the 
remaining water becomes harder and harder to extract. 

 This  section  has  given  us  a  basis  for  considering  the 
availability  of  water  to  organisms  living  in  terrestrial  and 
aquatic environments. Let’s use the foundation we have built 
here to explore the water relations of organisms on land and 
in water. In the face of variation in water availability, organ-
isms have been selected to regulate their internal water.

This  says  simply  that  the  internal  water  of  an  animal  (W ia   ) 
results  from  a  balance  between  water  acquisition  and  water 
loss. The major sources of water are:   

H2O

Wd 5 water taken by drinking
Wf 5 water taken in with food
Wa 5 water absorbed from the air 

As water evaporates from a 
leaf, it moves from higher 
water potential within the leaf 
to much lower water potential 
of surrounding air.

Evaporation of water from 
leaves reduces water potential 
of fluids in the leaf and creates 
negative pressure.

Because of hydrogen 
bonding between water 
molecules, the negative 
pressure created by water 
evaporating from surfaces 
of leaves pulls water 
through water-conducting 
cells (xylem) in the stem.

  6.2  Water Regulation on Land 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 6.6  List the major avenues for water gain and loss in 

 terrestrial plants and animals.

 6.7  Discuss the response of plant roots to differences in 

water availability.

 6.8  Compare water conservation by animals from 

 different environments.

 6.9  Explain how the Sonoran Desert cicada can remain 

active when environmental temperatures exceed 
their lethal maximum temperature.

  Terrestrial plants and animals regulate their internal water 
by balancing water acquisition against water loss.   When 
organisms moved into the terrestrial environment, they faced 
two major environmental challenges: potentially massive losses 
of water to the environment through evaporation and reduced 
access to replacement water. Terrestrial organisms evolved by 
natural selection to meet these challenges, eventually acquired 
the capacity to regulate their internal water content on land. We 
can summarize water regulation by terrestrial animals as:   

Wia 5 Wd 1 Wf 1 Wa 2 We 2 Ws 

The avenues of water loss are:   

We 5 water lost by evaporation
Ws 5  water lost with various secretions and excretions 

including urine, mucus, and feces 

We can summarize water regulation by terrestrial plants in a 
similar way:   

Wip 5 Wr 1 Wa 2 Wt 2 Ws 

The internal water concentration of a plant (W ip   ) results from 
a balance between gains and losses, where the major sources 
of water for plants are:   

    Wr 5 water taken from soil by roots

Wa 5 water absorbed from the air 

The major ways that plants lose water are:   

Wt 5 water lost by transpiration
Ws 5  water lost with various secretions and reproductive 

structures, including nectar, fruit, and seeds  

 The main avenues of water gain and loss by terrestrial plants 
and  animals  are  summarized  in   figure  6.7 .  The  figure  pre-
sents a generalized picture of the water relations of terrestrial 
organisms.  However,  organisms  in  different  environments 
face  different  environmental  challenges  to  which  they  have 
evolved  a  wide  variety  of  responses.  Let’s  now  look  at  the 
diverse ways in which terrestrial plants and animals regulate 
their internal water. 

   Water Acquisition by Animals 
 Many  small  terrestrial  animals  can  absorb  water  from  the 
air.  Most  terrestrial  animals,  however,  satisfy  their  need  for 
water either by drinking or by taking in water with food. In 
moist climates, there is generally plenty of water, and, if water 
becomes scarce, the mobility of most animals allows them to 
go to sources of water to drink. In deserts, animals that need 
abundant water must live near oases. Those that live out in the 
desert itself, away from oases, have evolved adaptations for 
living in arid environments. 

 Some  desert  animals  acquire  water  in  unusual  ways. 
Coastal deserts such as the Namib Desert of southwest Africa 
receive very little rain but are bathed in fog. This aerial mois-
ture is the water source for some animals in the Namib. One 
of these, a beetle in the genus  Lepidochora  of the family Tene-
brionidae, takes an engineering approach to water acquisition. 
These beetles dig trenches on the face of sand dunes to con-
dense  and  concentrate  fog. The  moisture  collected  by  these 
trenches runs down to the lower end, where the beetle waits 
for a drink. Another tenebrionid beetle,  Onymacris unguicu-
laris,   collects  moisture  by  orienting  its  abdomen  upward 
(Hamilton and Seely 1976). Fog condensing on this beetle’s

body  flows  to  its  mouth  ( fig.  6.8 ).   Onymacris   also  takes  in 
water with its food. Some of this water is absorbed within the 
tissues  of  the  food.  The  remaining  water  is  produced  when 
the  beetle  metabolizes  the  carbohydrates,  proteins,  and  fats 
contained in its food. We can see the source of this water if we 
look at an equation for oxidation of glucose:

As  you  can  see,  cellular  respiration  liberates  the  water  that 
combined with carbon dioxide during the process of photo-
synthesis (see chapter 5, p. 107). The water released during 
cellular respiration is called     metabolic water    .  

 Paul Cooper (1982) estimated the water budget for free-
ranging  Onymacris  from the Namib Desert near Gobabeb. He 
estimated the rate of water intake by this beetle at 49.9 mg of 
H 2 O per gram of body weight per day. Of this total, 39.8 mg 
came from fog, 1.7 mg came from moisture contained within 
food,  and  8.4  mg  came  from  metabolic  water.  The  rate  of 
water  loss  by  these  beetles,  41.3  mg  of  H 2 O  per  gram  per 
day, was slightly less than water intake. Of this total, 2.3 mg 
were  lost  with  feces  and  urine,  and  39  mg  by  evaporation. 
The water budget of the beetle studied by Cooper is shown 
in  figure 6.9 . 

 While  Onymacris  gets most of its water from fog, other 
small desert animals get most of their water from their food. 

Moisture in fog condenses 
on abdomen.

Beetles gather on 
dune crests, face 
into the fog-laden 
wind, and tip their 
abdomen upward.

Grooves in the abdomen 
collect condensed water and 
direct it toward the head.

Beetles drink from the water droplet 
that collects around their mouths.

 Water budget of Merriam’s kangaroo rat  Dipodomys 

(1964) showed that the approximately 60 mL of water gained 
from 100 g of barley makes up for the water a Merriam’s kan-
garoo rat,  D. merriami,  loses in feces, urine, and evaporation 
while metabolizing the 100 g of grain. The 100 g of barley 
contains  only  6  mL  of  absorbed  water—that  is,  water  that 
can be driven off by drying. The remaining 54 mL of water 
is released as the animal metabolizes the carbohydrates, fats, 
and proteins in the grain. The importance of metabolic water 
in the water budget of Merriam’s kangaroo rat is pictured in 
 figure 6.10 . 

 While  animals  generally  obtain  most  of  their  water  by 
drinking  or  with  their  food,  these  options  are  not  available 
to plants. Though many plants can absorb some water from 
the air, most get the bulk of their water from the soil through 
their roots.  

  Water Acquisition by Plants 
 The extent of root development by plants often reflects differ-
ences in water availability. Studies of root systems in differ-
ent climates show that plants in dry climates grow more roots 
than do plants in moist climates. In dry climates, plant roots 
tend to grow deeper in the soil and to constitute a greater pro-
portion of plant biomass. The taproots of some desert shrubs 
can  extend  9  or  even  30  m  down  into  the  soil,  giving  them 
access to deep groundwater. Roots may account for up to 90% 
of total plant biomass in deserts and semiarid grasslands. In 
coniferous  forests,  roots  constitute  only  about  25%  of  total 
plant biomass. 

 You don’t have to compare forests and deserts, however, 
to observe differences in root development. R. Coupland and 
R.  Johnson  (1965)  compared  the  rooting  characteristics  of 
plants  growing  in  the  temperate  grasslands  of  western  Can-
ada. During their study, they carefully excavated the roots of 

over  850  individual  plants,  digging  over  3  m  deep  to  trace 
some roots. They found that microclimate affects root devel-
opment in many grassland species. For instance, the roots of 
fringed  sage,   Artemesia  frigida,   penetrate  over  120  cm  into 
the soil on dry sites; on moist sites, its roots grow only to a 
depth of about 60 cm ( fig. 6.11 ). 

 Deeper  roots  often  help  plants  from  dry  environments 
extract  water  from  deep  within  the  soil  profile.  This  gener-
alization is supported by studies of two common grasses that 
grow  in  Japan,   Digitaria  adscendens   and   Eleusine  indica.  
The  grasses  overlap  broadly  in  their  distributions  in  Japan; 

On dry sites, the plant grows 
a dense network of deeply 
penetrating roots.

On moist sites, the plant 
grows a sparse network of 
shallow roots.

  Adaptations to the Environment

however, only  Digitaria  grows on coastal sand dunes, which 
are among the most drought-prone habitats in Japan. 

 Y.-M.  Park  (1990)  was  interested  in  understanding  the 
mechanisms  allowing   Digitaria   to  grow  on  coastal  dunes 
where   Eleusine   could  not.  Because  of  the  potential  for 
drought  in  coastal  dunes,  Park  studied  the  responses  of  the 
two grasses to water stress. He grew both species from seeds 
collected at the Botanical Gardens at the University of Tokyo. 
Seeds were germinated in moist sand and the seedlings were 
later  transplanted  into  10  cm  by  90  cm  polyvinyl  chloride 
(PVC)  tubes  filled  with  sand  from  a  coastal  dune.  Park 
planted  two  seedlings  of   Digitaria   in  each  of  36  tubes  and 
two  of   Eleusine   in  36  other  tubes.  He  watered  all  72  tubes 
with a nutrient solution every 10 days for 40 days. At the end 
of the 40 days, Park divided the 36 tubes of each species into 
two groups of 18. One group of each species was kept well 
watered for the next 19 days, while the other group remained 
unwatered. 

 Unwatered  Digitaria  and  Eleusine  responded differently. 
The root mass of  Digitaria  increased almost sevenfold over 
the 19 days of no watering, while the root mass of  Eleusine  
increased about threefold. In addition, the roots of  Digitaria  
were still growing at the end of the experiment, while those of 
 Eleusine  stopped growing about 4 days before the end of the 
experiment.  Figure 6.12  summarizes these results. 

 Park found that the differences in root growth were great-
est  in  the  deeper  soil  layers.  Below  60  cm  in  the  growing 
tubes,  the  unwatered  group  of   Eleusine   showed  suppressed 
root growth, while  Digitaria  did not. With its greater mass of 
more deeply penetrating roots,  Digitaria  maintained high leaf 
water potential throughout the 19 days of no watering. Dur-
ing this same period,  Eleusine  showed a substantial decline in 
leaf water potential. The leaf water potentials of  Digitaria  and 
 Eleusine  over the 19 days are shown in  figure 6.13 . 

 Park’s results suggest that  Digitaria  can be successful in 
the  drier  dune  habitat  because  it  grows  longer  roots,  which 
exploit  deeper  soil  moisture. With  these  deeper  roots,   Digi-
taria  can keep the water potential of its tissues high even in 
relatively  dry  soils,  where   Eleusine   suffers  lowered  water 
potential.  In  other  words,   Digitaria   maintains  higher  leaf 
water  potentials  because  its  greater  root  development  main-
tains a higher rate of water intake—higher W r  . 

 The  examples  we’ve  just  reviewed  concern  rooting  by 
individual  plant  species  either  in  the  field  or  under  experi-
mental conditions. An important question that we might ask is 
whether there have been enough root studies to make tentative 
generalizations  about  the  rooting  biology  of  plants.  Jochen 
Schenk and Robert Jackson (2002) conducted an analysis of 
475 root profile (see  fig. 6.11 ) studies from 209 geographic 
localities from around the world. In over 90% of the 475 root 
profiles,  at  least  50%  of  roots  were  in  the  top  0.3  m  of  the 
soil and at least 95% of roots were in the upper 2 m. How-
ever, there were pronounced geographic differences in rooting 
depth. Schenk and Jackson found that rooting depth increases 
from 80 8  to 30 8  latitude—that is, from Arctic tundra to Medi-
terranean  woodlands  and  shrublands  and  deserts.  However, 
there  were  no  clear  trends  in  rooting  depth  in  the  tropics. 
Consistent with our present discussion, deeper rooting depths 
occur mainly in water-limited ecosystems.  

  Water Conservation 
by Plants and Animals 
 Another way to balance a water budget is by reducing water 
losses.  One  of  the  most  common  adaptations  to  arid  envi-
ronments  is  waterproofing  to  reduce  evaporative  water  loss. 
Many  terrestrial  plants  and  animals  cover  themselves  with 
a  fairly  waterproof  “hide”  impregnated  with  a  variety  of

waterproofing  waxes.  However,  some  organisms  are  more 
waterproof  than  others,  and  rates  of  evaporative  water  loss 
vary greatly from one animal or plant species to another. 

 Why do the water loss rates of organisms differ? One rea-
son  is  that  species  have  evolved  in  environments  that  differ 
greatly  in  water  availability. As  a  consequence,  selection  for 
water conservation has been more intense in some environments 
than others. Species that evolved in warm deserts are generally 
much more resistant to desiccation than relatives that evolved 
in moist tropical or temperate habitats. In general, populations 
that evolved in drier environments lose water at a slower rate. 
For instance, turtles from wet and moist habitats lose water at 
a much higher rate than do desert tortoises ( fig. 6.14 ). As the 
following example shows, however, the water loss rates of even 
closely related species can differ substantially. 

 Neil Hadley and Thomas Schultz (1987) studied two spe-
cies of tiger beetles in Arizona that occupy different micro-
climates.   Cicindela  oregona   lives  along  the  moist  shoreline 
of streams and is active in fall and spring. In contrast,  Cicin-
dela obsoleta  lives in the semiarid grasslands of central and 
southeastern Arizona and is active in summer. The researchers 
suspected that these differences in microclimate select for dif-
ferences in waterproofing of the two tiger beetles. 

 Hadley and Schultz studied the waterproofing of the tiger 
beetles by comparing the amount of water each species lost 
while held in an experimental chamber. They pumped dry air 
through the chamber at a constant rate and maintained its tem-
perature at 30 8 C. They weighed each beetle at the beginning 
of an experiment and then again after 3 hours in the chamber. 
The  difference  between  initial  and  final  weights  gave  them 
an  estimate  of  the  water  loss  rate  of  each  beetle.  By  deter-
mining water loss for several individuals of each species, they 
estimated  the  average  water  loss  rates  for   C.  oregona   and  
C. obsoleta.  Hadley and Schultz found that  C. oregona  loses 

In a sequence of species from 
wet to dry habitats, pond turtles

 Rates of water loss by two turtles and a tortoise indi-

words, the species from the drier microclimate,  C. obsoleta,  
appears to be more waterproofed. 

 Waterproofing of terrestrial insect cuticles is usually pro-
vided by hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons include organic com-
pounds, such as lipids and waxes. Because of their influences 
on  waterproofing,  Hadley  and  Schultz  analyzed  the  cuticles 
of the two species of tiger beetles for their hydrocarbon con-
tent.  They  found  that  the  concentration  of  hydrocarbons  in 
the cuticle of  C. obsoleta  is 50% higher than in the cuticle of 
 C. oregona  ( fig. 6.16 ). In addition, the two species differ in

 Investigating the Evidence  6 

 Sample Size 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 6.10  Define the term sample size.
 6.11  Design a study, including the number of samples to 

be taken, to document the impact of future floods 
on the number of benthic insect species living in 
Tesuque Creek.

 The number of observations included in a sample, that is, sam-
ple size, has an important influence on the level of confidence 
we place on conclusions based on that sample. Let’s examine 
a simple example of how sample size affects our estimate of 
some  ecological  feature.  Consider  an  ecologist  interested  in 
how disturbance by flash flooding may affect the number of 
benthic insect species living in a stream. The stream is  Tesuque 
Creek at about 3,000 m elevation in the mountains above Santa 
Fe, New Mexico. A flash flood, which completely disrupted 
one  fork  of Tesuque  Creek,  left  a  second,  similar-sized  fork 
undisturbed. Nine months after the flood, samples were taken 
to determine if there was a difference in the number of species 
of mayflies (Order Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (O.  Plecoptera), 
caddisflies (O. Trichoptera), and beetles (O.  Coleoptera)  living 
in similar-sized reaches of the two forks. Samples of the ben-
thic  community  were  taken  at  5  m  intervals  with  a  Surber 
sampler, which has a 0.1 m 2  metal frame, or quadrat, and an 
attached net. As a stream ecologist disturbs the bottom mate-
rial within the quadrat of a Surber sampler, the net trailing in 
the current catches benthic organisms that are dislodged. In the 
study of Tesuque Creek, the number of benthic insect  species 
captured in each 0.1 m 2  sample ranged from one to six in the 
disturbed fork and from two to eight in the undisturbed fork. 
However, our question concerns the total number of species in 
each fork and the number of benthic samples required to make 
a good estimate of that number of species. 

  Figure 1  plots the data in a way that provides an answer 
to both questions. The Surber samples are plotted in the exact 
order they were taken, beginning with the first that was taken 
at the downstream end of each study reach and ending with the 
twelfth sample taken 55 m upstream from the first. As shown 
in  figure 1 , each of the first few samples adds to the cumulative 
number of species collected at each site, which rises steeply 
at first and then levels off at a maximum number of species in 
each study reach. The cumulative number of species stopped 
increasing at a sample size of seven quadrats in the undisturbed 
study reach and at five quadrats in the disturbed study reach. 

 How many samples should a researcher take? In the case 
of the benthic community just examined, seven replicate counts 
from 0.1 m 2  quadrats appears to be sufficient to estimate the 

number of benthic mayfly, stonefly, caddisfly, and beetle spe-
cies living in a short reach of a small, high-elevation stream 
in the Rocky Mountains. (We will revisit this study in Inves-
tigating  the  Evidence  16,  p.  359,  which  concerns  estimating 
the number of species in a community.) In contrast, to make 
generalizations about global patterns of rooting among plants, 
Schenk  and  Jackson  (2002)  reported  on  475  root  profiles  at 
209 locations (see p. 134). The number of samples necessary 
depends on the amount of variability in the system under study 
and  the  spatial  and  temporal  scope  of  the  study.  However, 
whether the scope of a project is large or small, sample size is 
one of the most important components of study design. 

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  6 
     1.  When designing an ecological study, it is important to take 
a sufficient number of samples to test the hypothesis under 
study. Why might a researcher try to collect a sufficient 
number of samples to test the hypothesis but not more?  

    2.  Judging from the data displayed in  figure 1 , how did dis-
turbance by flash flooding affect the number of mayfly, 
stonefly,  caddisfly,  and  beetle  species  living  in  the  dis-
turbed reach?    

At disturbed and undisturbed 
sites the cumulative number of 
mayfly, stonefly, caddisfly, 
and beetle species leveled off 
at between 5 and 7 quadrats.

the  percentages  of  cuticular  hydrocarbons  that  are  saturated

effective at waterproofing. One hundred percent of the hydro-
carbons in the cuticle of  C. obsoleta  are saturated. In contrast, 
only 50% of the cuticular hydrocarbons of  C. oregona  are sat-
urated. These results support the hypothesis that  C. obsoleta  
loses water at a lower rate because its cuticle contains a higher 
concentration of waterproofing hydrocarbons. 

 Merriam’s  kangaroo  rats  conserve  water  sufficiently  that 
they  can  live  entirely  on  the  moisture  contained  within  their 
food  and  on  metabolic  water  (see   fig.  6.10 ). This  capacity  is 
assumed to be an adaptation to desert living. Over long periods 
of time as the American Southwest became increasingly arid, 
the ancestors of today’s Merriam’s kangaroo rats were subject 
to natural selection that favored a range of adaptations to dry 
environments,  including  water  conservation.  However,  Merri-
am’s kangaroo rat is a widespread species that lives from 21 8  N 
latitude in Mexico to 42 8  N latitude in northern Nevada. Over 
this large geographic range, Merriam’s kangaroo rat populations 
are exposed to a very broad range of environmental conditions. 
 Intrigued by their large geographic range and exceptional 
adaptation to desert living, Randall Tracy and Glenn Walsberg 
studied three populations of Merriam’s kangaroo rats across 
a climatic gradient. Their main objective was to determine if 
different populations of Merriam’s kangaroo rat vary in their 
degree of adaptation to living in dry environments (Tracy and 
Walsberg  2000,  2001,  2002).  The  three  populations  studied 
by Tracy and Walsberg live in southwest Arizona near Yuma, 
central Arizona,  and  north-central Arizona,  at  elevations  of 
150 m, 400 m, and 1,200 m, respectively. Mean annual maxi-
mum  temperatures  at  the  study  sites  are  31.5 8 ,  29.1 8 ,  and 
23.5 8 C, while mean annual precipitation at the three sites is 
106 mm, 336 mm, and 436 mm. Climatic differences at the 
three study sites are reflected in the vegetation. The habitat at 
the driest site consists of sand dunes with scattered shrubs; the 
intermediate site is a desert shrubland; and the vegetation at 
the moist site consists of temperate, pinyon-juniper woodland. 
 One of the main questions asked by Tracy and  Walsberg 
was  whether  rates  of  evaporative  water  loss  would  differ 
among  the  Merriam’s  kangaroo  rats  at  dry,  intermediate, 
and moist sites. The results of this study showed clear dif-
ferences  among  the  study  populations.  The  mean  rate  of 
evaporative  water  loss  by  kangaroo  rats  from  the  dry  site 
was 0.69 mg of water per gram per hour, compared to 1 mg 
H 2 O/g/h  and  1.08  mg  H 2 O/g/h  by  kangaroo  rats  from  the 
intermediate and moist sites, respectively ( fig. 6.17 ). Tracy 
and  Walsberg expressed the rate of water loss by the kanga-
roo rats on a per gram basis because the kangaroo rats from 
the three sites differ significantly in size. The average mass 
of  individuals  from  the  moist  site  was  approximately  33% 
greater than the mass of rats from the dry site. In additional 
studies, Tracy and Walsberg found that acclimating animals 
to  laboratory  conditions  did  not  eliminate  the  differences 
in  water  conservation  among  populations.  In  other  words, 
even after being kept in the laboratory under controlled con-
ditions, Merriam’s kangaroo rats from the driest study site 
continued to lose water at a lower rate. The evidence from 

Kangaroo rats from the driest 
site lost water at lower rates.

of the populations (data from Tracy and Walsberg 2001).  

 Water loss rates by Merriam’s kangaroo rats from 

these studies supports the conclusion that these three popu-
lations differ in their degree of adaptation to desert living. 

 Animals  adapted  to  dry  conditions  have  many  other 
water conservation mechanisms besides waterproofing. These 
mechanisms  include  producing  concentrated  urine  or  feces 
with low water content, condensing and reclaiming the water 
vapor  in  breath,  and  restricting  activity  to  times  and  places 
that decrease water loss. 

 Plants have also evolved a wide variety of means for con-
serving water. How much water a plant can conserve depends 
in part on its leaf area relative to its root area or length. Plants 
with  more  leaf  surface  per  length  of  root  lose  more  water. 
Compared to plants from moist climates, arid land plants gen-
erally have less leaf area per unit area of root. Many plants 
reduce  leaf  area  over  the  short  term  by  dropping  leaves  in 
response to drought. Some desert plants produce leaves only 
in response to soaking rains and then shed them when the des-
ert  dries  out  again. These  plants  reduce  leaf  area  to  zero  in 
times of drought.  Figure 6.18  shows one of these plants, the 
ocotillo of the Sonoran Desert of North America. 

 Other  plant  adaptations  that  conserve  water  include 
thick  leaves,  which  have  less  transpiring  leaf  surface  area 
per unit volume of photosynthesizing tissue than thin leaves 
do;  few  stomata  on  leaves  rather  than  many;  structures  on 
the stomata that impede the movement of water; dormancy 
during  times  when  moisture  is  unavailable;  and  alterna-
tive, water-conserving pathways for photosynthesis (C 4  and 
CAM). (We discuss these alternative pathways for photosyn-
thesis in chapter 7.) 

 We should remember that plants and animals in terrestrial 
environments other than deserts also show evidence of selec-
tion  for  water  conservation.  For  instance,  Nona  Chiariello 
and her colleagues (1987) discovered an intriguing example 
of  adjusting  leaf  area  in  the  moist  tropics.   Piper  auritum,   a 
large-leafed,  umbrella-shaped  plant,  grows  in  clearings  of 

138 

Section II

the rain forest. Because it grows in clearings, the plant often 
faces  drying  conditions  during  midday.  However,  it  reduces 
the  leaf  area  it  exposes  to  the  midday  sun  by  wilting. Wilt-
ing at midday reduces leaf area exposed to direct solar radia-
tion by about 55% and leaf temperature by up to 4 8  to 5 8 C. 
These  reductions  decrease  the  rate  of  transpiration  by  30% 
to  50%,  which  is  a  substantial  water  savings.  The  behavior 
of this tropical rain forest plant reminds us that even the rain 
forest has its relatively dry microclimates, such as the forest 
clearings where  P. auritum  grows. The rapidity of the wilting 
response by  P. auritum  is shown in  figure 6.19 . 

 Organisms  balance  their  water  budgets  in  numerous 
ways. Some rely mainly on water conservation. Others depend 
upon water acquisition. However, every biologist who studies 
organisms in their natural environment knows that nature is 
marked by diversity and contrast. To sample nature’s variety, 
let’s review the variety of approaches to desert living.  

 Dissimilar Organisms with Similar 
Approaches to Desert Life 
 On the surface, camels and saguaro cactus appear entirely dif-
ferent. If you look deeper into their biology, however, you find 
that they take very similar approaches to balancing their water 
budgets. Both the camel and the saguaro cactus acquire mas-
sive  amounts  of  water  when  water  is  available,  store  water, 
and conserve water. 

 The camel can go for long periods in intense desert heat 
without drinking, up to 6 to 8 days in conditions that would 
kill  a  person  within  a  day.  During  this  time,  the  animal

survives on the water stored in its tissues and can withstand 
water losses of up to 20% of its body weight without harm. 
For humans, a loss of about 10% to 12% is near the fatal limit. 
When  the  camel  has  the  opportunity,  it  can  drink  and  store 
prodigious  quantities  of  water,  up  to  one-third  of  its  body 
weight at a time. 

 Between opportunities to drink, the camel is a master of 
water  conservation.  One  way  it  conserves  body  water  is  by 
reducing its rate of heat gain. Like overheating tiger beetles 
(see chapter 5, p. 120), the camel faces into the sun, reducing 
the body surface it exposes to direct sunlight. In addition, its 
thick hair insulates it from the intense desert sun, and rather 
than sweating sufficiently to keep its body temperature down, 
the camel allows its body temperature to rise by up to 7 8 C. 
This  reduces  the  temperature  difference  between  the  camel 
and the environment and so decreases the rate of additional 
heating.  Reduced  heating  translates  into  reduced  water  loss 
by evaporation. 

 The saguaro cactus takes a similar approach. The trunk 
and arms of the plant act as organs in which the cactus can 
store large quantities of water. During droughts, the saguaro 
draws  on  these  stored  reserves  and,  as  a  result,  can  endure 
long periods without water. When it rains, the saguaro, like 
a camel at an oasis, can ingest great quantities of water, but 

instead  of  drinking,  the  saguaro  gets  its  water  through  its 
dense network of shallow roots. These roots extend out in a 
roughly circular pattern to a distance approximately equal to 
the height of the cactus. For a 15 m tall saguaro, this means a 
root coverage of over 700 m 2  of soil. 

 The  saguaro  also  reduces  its  rate  of  evaporative  water 
loss in several ways. First, like other cactus, it keeps its sto-
mata closed during the day when transpiration losses would 
be  highest.  In  the  absence  of  transpiration,  in  full  sun,  the 
internal temperature of the saguaro rises to over 50 8 C, which 
is among the highest temperatures recorded in plants. How-
ever, as we noted for the camel, higher body temperature can 
be an advantage because it reduces the rate of additional heat-
ing. The saguaro’s rate of heating is also reduced by the shape 
and  orientation  of  its  trunk  and  arms. At  midday,  when  the 
potential for heating is greatest, the saguaro exposes mainly 
the tips of its arms and trunk to direct sunlight. In addition, 
the  tips  of  the  saguaro’s  arms  and  trunk  are  insulated  by  a 
layer of plant hairs and a thick tangle of spines, which reflect 
sunlight and shade the growing tips of the cactus. 

 The parallel approaches to desert living seen in saguaro 
cactus and camels are outlined in  figure 6.20 . Now let’s exam-
ine two organisms that live in the same desert but have very 
different water relations. 

The saguaro reduces 
heat gain by exposing 
only tops of its trunk 
and branches to the 
midday sun.

The trunk and branch 
tips are shaded and 
insulated with a high 
density of spines, which 
reduces heat gain.

The camel stores fat 
in its hump, a source 
of metabolic water.

The camel reduces 
heat gain by facing 
into the sun.

The camel is covered 
with dense hair which 
reduces heat gain.

Water is stored in 
the massive  trunk 
and arms.

The saguaro reduces water loss 
by transpiration by keeping 
stomates closed and allowing 
its temperature to rise.

When water is available, both 
the saguaro and camel take in 
massive quantities.

The camel reduces 
evaporative water loss by 
not sweating and allowing 
body temperature to rise.

  Figure 6.20  
 Dissimilar organisms with similar approaches to desert living. The improbable pairing of a dromedary camel, native to southwestern 
Asia, with saguaro cactus, from western North America, actually occurred during the mid-nineteenth century, when the U.S. Army imported camels for 
use as pack animals.

  Adaptations to the Environment

  Two Arthropods with Opposite Approaches 
to Desert Life 
 Although cicadas and scorpions are arthropods and may live 
within a few meters of each other, they take sharply contrast-
ing approaches to living in the desert. The scorpion’s approach 
is to slow down, conserve, and stay out of the sun. Scorpions 
are  relatively  large  and  long-lived  arthropods  with  very  low 
metabolic rates. A low rate of metabolism means that they can 
subsist on low rations of food and lose little water during respi-
ration. In addition, scorpions conserve water by spending most 
of  their  time  in  their  burrows,  where  the  humidity  is  higher 
than at the surface. They come out to feed and find mates only 
at night, when it’s cooler. In addition, desert scorpions are well 
waterproofed; hydrocarbons in their cuticles seal in moisture. 
With  this  combination  of  water-conserving  characteristics, 
scorpions can easily satisfy their need for water by consuming 
the moisture contained in the bodies of their arthropod prey. 
 Figure 6.21  summarizes the habits of desert scorpions. 

 In comparison to desert scorpions, the cicada’s approach to 
desert living may seem out of place. As we saw in the introduc-
tion to this chapter, the Sonoran Desert cicada,  Diceroprocta 
apache,  is active on the hottest days, when air temperature is 
near its lethal limit. How can  Diceroprocta  do this and not die? 
 A  series  of  investigations  and  papers  by  Eric  Toolson 
and  Neil  Hadley  showed  conclusively  that  cicadas,  includ-
ing  Diceroprocta,  are capable of evaporative cooling. In one 
of these studies, Eric Toolson (1987) collected  Diceroprocta  
from  a  mesquite  tree  and  placed  them  in  an  environmental 
chamber. The chamber temperature was kept at 45.5 8 C; how-
ever,  Diceroprocta  was able to maintain its body temperature 
at least 2.9 8 C lower. Since the cicadas within the chamber did 
not have access to any cool microclimates, Toolson concluded 
that they must be evaporatively cooling. To verify this hypoth-
esis, he placed cicadas in the environmental chamber and then 
raised the relative humidity to 100%. At 100% relative humid-
ity, the body temperatures of the cicadas quickly increased to 
the temperature of the environmental chamber. When Toolson 
reduced relative humidity to 0%, the cicadas cooled approxi-
mately 4 8 C within minutes. The results of this experiment are 
outlined in  figure 6.22 . 

 How do the results of Toolson’s experiment support the 
hypothesis of evaporative cooling? Remember that air with a 
relative humidity of 100% contains all the water vapor it can 
hold  (see  p.  127).  Consequently,  by  raising  the  humidity  of 
the air surrounding the cicadas to 100%, Toolson shut off any 
evaporative cooling that might be taking place. When he rein-
troduced dry air, he created a gradient of water concentration 
from the cicada to the air and evaporative cooling resumed. 
This  experiment  by  Toolson  was  analogous  to  Heinrich’s 
tying  off  the  circulatory  system  of  a  sphinx  moth  to  deter-
mine  the  role  of  the  circulatory  system  in  thermoregulation 
(see chapter 5, pp. 118–119). 

 Toolson’s results are consistent with the hypothesis that 
 Diceroprocta   evaporatively  cools  but  does  not  demonstrate 
that  capacity  directly.  Consequently,  Toolson  and  Hadley 
(1987)  conducted  observations  to  make  a  direct  demonstra-
tion. First, they placed a live  Diceroprocta  in an environmental

chamber  with  a  humidity  sensor  just  above  its  cuticle.  If 
 Diceroprocta   evaporatively  cools,  then  this  sensor  would 
detect higher humidity as the temperature of the environment 
was increased. This is exactly what occurred. As the tempera-
ture was increased from 30 8  to 43 8 C, the rate of water move-
ment across the cicada’s cuticle increased in three steps. When 
Toolson  and  Hadley  increased  the  temperature  from  37 8   to 
39 8 C, water loss increased from 5.7 to 9.4 mg H 2 O per square 
centimeter per hour. At 41 8 C, water loss increased from 9.4 
to 36.1 mg H 2 O per square centimeter per hour and at 43 8 C 
water  loss  increased  from  36.1  to  61.4  mg  H 2 O  per  square 
centimeter per hour. These results are graphed in  figure 6.23 . 
 The rate of water loss by  Diceroprocta  is among the high-
est ever reported for a terrestrial insect. How does water cross

Section II 

  Adaptations to the Environment

The cicada can remain active when 
environmental temperatures exceed its lethal 
maximum because it uses evaporative cooling 
to reduce body temperature.

It compensates for high evaporative 
water loss (high We) by high rate of 
drinking (high Wd).

The insect gets the water it needs for 
evaporative cooling by tapping into 
water that its host plant draws from 
deep below the surface of the ground.

 An ecological puzzle solved.  

verified  a  previously  unknown  phenomenon,  evaporative 
cooling by cicadas, and carefully demonstrated the  underlying 
mechanisms. 

 So, it turns out that these cicadas can sing in the hot-
test  hours  of  the  desert  day  because  they  sweat!   Dicero-
procta   is  able  to  maintain  this  seemingly  impossible 
lifestyle because it has tapped into a rich supply of water. 
Cicadas are members of the order Homoptera and distant 
relatives of the aphids. Like aphids, cicadas feed on plant 
fluids.  So,  though  the  cicada  lives  in  the  same  macrocli-
mate as the scorpion, it has tapped into a totally different 
microclimate. The  cicada’s  scope  for  water  acquisition  is 
extended up to 30 m deep into the soil by the taproots of its 
mesquite  host  plant,   Prosopis  juliflora.  Diceroprocta   can 
sustain high rates of water loss through evaporation, high 
W e , because it is able to balance these losses with a high 
rate of water acquisition, high W d .  Figure 6.25  illustrates 
how  Diceroprocta  uses mesquite trees to get access to deep 
soil moisture. 

 Sometimes,  similar  organisms  employ  radically  differ-
ent approaches to balancing their water budgets. Sometimes, 
organisms  of  very  different  evolutionary  lineages  employ 
functionally similar approaches. In short, the means by which 
terrestrial organisms balance water acquisition against water 
loss are almost as varied as the organisms themselves. Similar 
variation occurs among aquatic organisms. 

  Concept 6.2 Review 

1.   The tiger beetle  Cicindela oregona  (see  figs. 6.15  and 
 6.16 )  has  a  distribution  that  extends  from  Arizona 
through  the  temperate  rain  forests  of  Alaska.  Why 
should the amounts of cuticular hydrocarbons vary geo-
graphically among populations of  C. oregona?   

 2.   During severe droughts, some of the branches of shrubs 
and trees die, while others survive. How might losing 
some branches increase the probability that an individ-
ual plant will survive a drought?  

     3.   How  are  water  and  temperature  regulation  related  in 

many terrestrial organisms?       

  6.3  Water and Salt Balance 

in Aquatic Environments 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 6.12  Define osmoregulation.
 6.13  Contrast osmoregulation by sharks versus marine 

bony fish.

 6.14  Compare osmoregulation by freshwater bony fish 

and freshwater mosquitoes.

   Marine  and  freshwater  organisms  use  complementary 
mechanisms  for  water  and  salt  regulation.   Aquatic 
organisms,  like  their  terrestrial  kin,  regulate  internal  water, 
W i , by balancing water gain against water loss. We can rep-
resent water regulation in aquatic environments by modifying 
our equation for terrestrial water balance to:   

Wi 5 Wd 2 Ws 6 Wo 

Drinking, W d , is a ready source of water for aquatic organ-
isms. Secretion of water with urine, Ws, is an avenue of water 
loss. By osmosis, W o , an aquatic organism may either gain or 
lose water, depending on the organism and the environment.  

  Marine Fish and Invertebrates 
 Most  marine  invertebrates  maintain  an  internal  concentra-
tion of solutes equivalent to that in the seawater around them. 
What does the animal gain by remaining isosmotic with the 
external environment? The isosmotic animal does not have to 
expend energy overcoming an osmotic gradient. This strategy 
is not without costs, however. Although the total concentra-
tion of solutes is the same inside and outside the animal, there 
are still differences in the concentrations of some individual 
solutes. These concentration differentials can only be main-
tained by active transport, which consumes some energy. 

 Sharks, skates, and rays generally elevate the concentra-
tion of solutes in their blood to levels slightly hyperosmotic 
to  seawater.  However,  inorganic  ions  constitute  only  about 
one-third  of  the  solute  in  shark’s  blood;  the  remainder  con-
sists of the organic molecules urea and trimethylamine oxide,

or TMAO. As a consequence of being slightly hyperosmotic, 
sharks  slowly  gain  water  through  osmosis;  that  is,  W o   is 
slightly positive. The water that diffuses into the shark, mainly 
across  the  gills,  is  pumped  out  by  the  kidneys  and  exits  as 
urine. Sodium, because it is maintained at approximately two-
thirds its concentration in seawater, diffuses into sharks from 
seawater across the gill membranes and some sodium enters 
with  food.  Sharks  excrete  excess  sodium  mainly  through  a 
specialized  gland  associated  with  the  rectum  called  the  salt 
gland. The main point here is that sharks and their relatives 
reduce the costs of     osmoregulation    ,  regulation of internal salt 
and water concentrations, by decreasing the osmotic gradient 
between themselves and the external environment ( fig. 6.26 ). 
 In  contrast  to  most  marine  invertebrates  and  sharks, 
marine bony fish have body fluids that are strongly hypoos-
motic  to  the  surrounding  medium. As  a  consequence,  they 
lose water to the surrounding seawater, mostly across their 
gills. Marine bony fish make up these water losses by drink-
ing seawater. However, drinking seawater increases salt gain. 
The fish rid themselves of excess salts in two ways. Special-
ized “chloride” cells at the base of their gills secrete sodium 
and chloride directly to the surrounding seawater, while the 
kidneys excrete magnesium and sulfate. These ions exit with 
the urine. The urine, because it is hypoosmotic to the body 
fluids  of  the  fish,  represents  a  loss  of  water.  However,  the 
loss of water through the kidneys is low because the volume 
of urine is low. 

 The larvae of some mosquitoes in the genus  Aedes  live in 
saltwater. These larvae meet the challenge of a high-salinity 
environment in ways analogous to those used by marine bony 
fish. Like marine bony fish, saltwater mosquitoes are hypoos-
motic  to  the  surrounding  environment,  to  which  they  lose 
water. Saltwater mosquitoes also make up this water loss by 
drinking large amounts of seawater, up to 130% to 240% of 
body volume per day! While this prodigious drinking solves 

the problem of water loss, it imports another: large quantities 
of salts that must be eliminated. Saltwater mosquitoes secrete 
these salts into the urine using specialized cells that line the 
posterior  rectum.  Here,  saltwater  mosquitoes  do  something 
that  marine  bony  fish  cannot.  They  excrete  a  urine  that  is 
hyperosmotic to their body fluids, which reduces water loss 
through the urine. The parallels in water and salt regulation 
by marine bony fish and saltwater mosquitoes are outlined in 
 figure 6.27 . 

  Freshwater Fish and Invertebrates 
 Freshwater bony fish face an environmental challenge oppo-
site  to  that  faced  by  marine  bony  fish.  Freshwater  fish  are 
hyperosmotic;  they  have  body  fluids  that  contain  more  salt 
and  less  water  than  the  surrounding  medium.  As  a  conse-
quence, water floods inward and salts diffuse outward across 
their  gills.  Freshwater  fish  excrete  excess  internal  water  as 
large  quantities  of  dilute  urine.  They  replace  the  salts  they 
lose to the external environment in two ways. Chloride cells at 
the base of the gill filaments absorb sodium and chloride from 
the water, while other salts are ingested with food. 

 Like  freshwater  fish,  freshwater  invertebrates  are 
hyperosmotic  to  the  surrounding  environment.   Freshwater 
invertebrates must expend energy to pump out the water that 
floods  their  tissues.  They  also  expend  energy  by  actively 
absorbing  salts  from  the  external  environment.  However, 
the concentration of solutes in the body fluids of  freshwater 
invertebrates  ranges  from  between  about   one-half  and 
 one-tenth that of their marine relatives. This lower  internal 
concentration  of  solutes  reduces  the  osmotic  gradient 
between  freshwater  and  the  outside  environment  and  so 
reduces the energy freshwater invertebrates must expend to 
osmoregulate. 

 Freshwater  mosquito  larvae  are  a  good  model  for 
osmoregulation  by  freshwater  invertebrates.  The  larvae  of

approximately  95%  of  mosquito  species  live  in  freshwater, 
where they face osmotic challenges very similar to those pre-
sented to freshwater fish. Like freshwater fish, mosquito lar-
vae must solve the twin problems of water gain and ion loss. 
In response, they drink very little water. They conserve ions 
taken with the diet by absorbing them with cells that line the 
midgut  and  rectum,  and  they  secrete  a  dilute  urine.  Fresh-
water  mosquito  larvae  replace  the  ions  lost  with  urine  by 
actively absorbing Na  1   and Cl  2   from the water with cells in 
their anal papillae. Freshwater mosquitoes and fish use totally 
different  structures  to  meet  nearly  identical  environmental 
challenges ( fig. 6.28 ). 

 In chapter 6, we have reviewed the water relations of indi-
vidual organisms. Studies of the relationship between individ-
ual organisms and the environment, a fundamental aspect of 
ecology, is now being advanced rapidly with the development 
of powerful analytical tools.

 In  order  to  fully  understand  the  ecology  of  an  individual 
plant  or  the  dynamics  of  an  entire  landscape,  ecologists 
need  information  about  what  happens  below  the  earth’s 
surface,  as  well  as  about  surface  structure  and  processes. 
However,  ecologists  have  produced  much  more  informa-
tion about the surface realm than about the subsurface, the 
domain  of  soil  microbes,  burrowing  animals,  and  roots. 
While  many  ecologists  have  worked  very  hard  to  fill  this 
gap in our knowledge, their work on belowground ecology

has been historically slow. Fortunately, progress has accel-
erated in recent years. A major contributor to recent prog-
ress  in  belowground  ecology  has  been  the  development  of 
new tools. One of the most important of those tools is     stable 
isotope analysis    ,  which involves the analysis of the relative 
proportions of stable isotopes, such as the stable isotopes of 
carbon  13 C and  12 C, in materials. Stable isotope analysis is 
increasingly  used  in  ecology  (Dawson  et  al.  2002). As  we 
saw  in  chapter  1  (p.  5),  stable  isotope  analysis  is  proving 
useful for tracking habitat use by migratory birds. It is also 
a very powerful tool in studies of water uptake by plants. To 
understand the application of this analytical tool, we need to 
know a little about the isotopes themselves and about their 
behavior in ecosystems.  

  Stable Isotope Analysis 
 Most  chemical  elements  include  several  stable  isotopes, 
which occur in different ratios in different environments or 
differ in their ratios from one organism to another. Stable iso-
topes of hydrogen include  1 H and  2 H, which is generally des-
ignated as D, an abbreviation of deuterium. Stable isotopes 

of  carbon  include   13 C  and   12 C;  stable  isotopes  of  nitrogen 
include   15 N  and   14 N;  and  stable  isotopes  of  sulfur  include 
 34 S and  32 S. The ratios of these stable isotopes can be used 
to  study  the  flow  of  energy  and  materials  through  ecosys-
tems because different parts of the ecosystem often contain 
the  light  and  heavy  isotopes  of  these  elements  in  different 
proportions. 

 Different organisms contain different ratios of light and 
heavy stable isotopes because they use different sources of 
these  elements,  because  they  preferentially  use  (fraction-
ate) different stable isotopes, or because they use different 
sources and fractionate. For instance, the lighter isotope of 
nitrogen,  14 N, is preferentially excreted by organisms  during 
protein  synthesis.  As  a  consequence  of  this  preferential 
excretion of  14 N, an organism becomes relatively enriched in 
 15 N compared to its food. Therefore, as materials pass from 
one trophic level to the next, tissues become richer in  15 N. 
Consequently,  the  highest  trophic  levels  within  an  ecosys-
tem contain the highest relative concentrations of  15 N, while 
the lowest trophic levels contain the lowest concentrations. 
Stable  isotope  analysis  can  also  measure  the  relative  con-
tribution of C 3  and C 4  plants (see chapter 7, pp. 152–153) 

146 

Section II 

  Adaptations to the Environment

to a species’ diet (see chapter 1, p. 5). This is possible because 
C 4  plants are relatively richer in  13 C. Other processes affect 
the ratios of sulfur stable isotopes. Because different sources 
of water often have different ratios of D to  1 H, for example, 
shallow  soil  moisture  versus  deep  soil  moisture,  hydrogen 
isotope analyses have been valuable aids to identifying where 
plants acquire their water. 

 The  concentrations  of  stable  isotopes  are  generally 
expressed  as  differences  in  the  concentration  of  the  heavier 
isotope relative to some standard. The units of measurement 
are differences ( 6 ) in parts per thousand    ( 6  0/00) . These dif-
ferences are calculated as:   

dX 5  [  (   

Rsample 
______ 
Rstandard

   )  2 1 ]  3 103 

where:
              d   5   6    
            X  5   the relative concentration of the heavier isotope, 

for example, D,  13 C,  15 N, or  34 S in   0/00    

     R  sample   5   the isotopic ratio in the sample, for example, 

D: 1 H,  13 C: 12 C, or  15 N: 14 N  

   R  standard   5   the isotopic ratio in the standard, for example, 

D: 1 H,  13 C: 12 C, or  15 N: 14 N   

The reference materials used as standards in the isotopic anal-
yses of hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur are the D: 1 H 
ratio  in  Standard  Mean  Ocean  Water,  the   15 N: 14 N  ratio  in 
atmospheric nitrogen, the  13 C: 12 C ratio in PeeDee limestone, 
and the  34 S: 32 S in the Canyon Diablo meteorite. 

 The ecologist measures the ratio of stable isotopes in a 
sample and then expresses that ratio as a difference relative 
to some standard. If  d X  5  0, then the ratios of the isotopes 
in the sample and the standard are the same; if     d X  5  2 X0/00, 
the concentration of the heavier isotope is lower (e.g.,  15 N) in 
the sample compared to the standard, and if        d X  5  1 X0/00,  the 
concentration of the heavier isotope is higher in the sample 
compared  to  the  standard.  The  important  point  here  is  that 
these isotopic ratios are generally different in different parts 
of  ecosystems.  Therefore,  ecologists  can  use  isotopic  ratios 
to  study  the  structure  and  processes  in  ecosystems.  Here  is 
an  example  of  how  hydrogen  isotope  ratios  have  been  used 
to study the uptake of water by plants in a natural ecosystem.  

  Using Stable Isotopes to Identify 
Plant Water Sources 
 The  laboratory  of  James  Ehleringer  has  taken  a  leadership 
role in the development of stable isotope analysis as a tool for 
assessing water relations among plants and within ecosystems 
(e.g., Ehleringer, Roden, and Dawson 2000). In an early study 
Ehleringer  and  several  colleagues  (Ehleringer  et  al.  1991) 
used deuterium:hydrogen (D: 1 H) ratios, or  d D, to explore the 
use of  summer  versus  winter  rainfall by various plant growth 
forms in the deserts of southern Utah. They could use  d D to 
determine the relative utilization of these two water sources 

In summer a succulent 
plant shifted from soil 
water that fell as winter 
rain to exclusive use of 
summer rainwater.

In contrast, herbaceous and 
woody perennials continued 
to use at least some deep 
soil water that had fallen as 
winter rain.

 Stable isotope analysis identified the water sources 
used by three groups of desert plants during spring and summer (data

since summer rains are relatively enriched with D and win-
ter rains are relatively depleted of D. The  d D of summer and 
winter rains in southern Utah at the time of Ehleringer’s study 
were    225 0/00  and    290 0/00  respectively ( fig. 6.29 ). 

 Ehleringer  measured   d D  in  the  xylem  fluid  of  several 
plant  growth  forms  during  spring,  when  soil  moisture  at  all 
rooting depths would be predominantly from winter precipita-
tion and summer, when summer precipitation would be pres-
ent as moisture in surface soils and winter precipitation would 
predominate at deeper soil layers. Ehleringer and his research 
team  found  that  a  succulent,  several  herbaceous  perennials, 
and  several  woody  perennials  used  winter  moisture  in  the 
spring (see  fig. 6.29 ). However, when summer rains fell, the 
succulent species shifted entirely to using soil moisture from 
summer rains that were stored mainly at shallow soil depths. 
Meanwhile,  herbaceous  and  woody  perennials  continued  to 
use significant amounts of deeper soil moisture that fell the 
previous winter. So, stable isotope analysis opens a window 
to the water relations of plants that would not be accessible 
without this innovative tool. We will explore the use of stable 
isotope  analysis  further  in  chapter  18,  where  we  discuss  its 
use in studies of energy flow in ecosystems.     

 

   Summary 

Chapter 6 

  Water Relations 

147

  Concentration gradients influence the movement of water 
between  an  organism  and  its  environment.   The  most 
familiar relative measure of the water content of air is relative 
humidity, defined as water vapor density divided by saturation 
water vapor density multiplied by 100. On land, the tendency of 
water to move from organisms to the atmosphere can be approx-
imated by the vapor pressure deficit of the air. Vapor pressure 
deficit is calculated as the difference between the actual water 
vapor pressure and the saturation water vapor pressure. 

 In the aquatic environment, water moves down its con-
centration  gradient,  from  solutions  of  higher  water  concen-
tration  and  lower  salt  content  (hypoosmotic)  to  solutions  of 
lower  water  concentration  and  higher  salt  content  (hyperos-
motic).  This  movement  of  water  creates  osmotic  pressure. 
Larger  osmotic  differences,  between  organism  and  environ-
ment, generate higher osmotic pressures. 

 In the soil-plant system, water flows from areas of higher 
water  potential  to  areas  of  lower  water  potential. The  water 
potential of pure water, which by convention is set at zero, is 
reduced by adding solute and by matric forces, the tendency 
of water to cling to soil particles and to plant cell walls. Typi-
cally,  the  water  potential  of  plant  fluids  is  determined  by  a 
combination of solute concentrations and matric forces, while 
the  water  potential  of  soils  is  determined  mainly  by  matric 
forces. In saline soils, solutes may also influence soil water 
potential. Water potential, osmotic pressure, and vapor pres-
sure  deficit  can  all  be  measured  in  pascals  (newtons/m 2 ),  a 
common  currency  for  considering  the  water  relations  of 
diverse organisms in very different environments. 

  Terrestrial  plants  and  animals  regulate  their  inter-
nal  water  by  balancing  water  acquisition  against  water 
loss.   Water  regulation  by  terrestrial  animals  is  sum-
marized  by  W ia    5   W d    1   W f    1   W a    2   W e    2   W s ,  where 
W d   5   drinking, W f   5  taken in with food, W a   5  absorption 
from  the  air,  W e    5   evaporation,  and  W s    5   secretions  and 
excretions.  Water  regulation  by  terrestrial  plants  is  summa-
rized by W ip   5  W r   1  W a   2  W t   2  W s , where W r   5  uptake 
by roots, W a   5  absorption from the air, W t   5  transpiration, 

and W s   5  secretions and reproductive structures. Some very 
different terrestrial plants and animals, such as the camel and 
saguaro  cactus,  use  similar  mechanisms  to  survive  in  arid 
 climates. Some organisms, such as scorpions and cicadas, use 
radically  different  mechanisms.  Comparisons  such  as  these 
suggest that natural selection is opportunistic. 

  Marine and freshwater organisms use  complementary 
mechanisms  for  water  and  salt  regulation.   Marine  and 
freshwater organisms face exactly opposite osmotic challenges. 
Water regulation in aquatic environments is summarized by: 
W i   5  W d   2  W s   6  W o , where W d   5   drinking, W s   5   secretions 
and  excretions,  W o    5   osmosis.  An  aquatic  organism  may 
either gain or lose water through osmosis, depending on the 
organism  and  the  environment.  Many  marine  invertebrates 
reduce  their  water  regulation  problems  by  being  isosmotic 
with seawater. Some freshwater invertebrates also reduce the 
osmotic gradient between themselves and their environment. 
Sharks, skates, and rays elevate the urea and TMAO content 
of their body fluids to the point where they are slightly hyper-
osmotic to seawater. Marine bony fish and saltwater mosquito 
larvae are hypoosmotic relative to their environments, while 
freshwater  bony  fish  and  freshwater  mosquito  larvae  are 
hyperosmotic. 

 While  the  strength  of  environmental  challenge  varies 
from  one  environment  to  another,  and  the  details  of  water 
 regulation vary from one organism to another, all organisms 
in all environments expend energy to maintain their internal 
pool of water and dissolved substances. 

 Stable  isotope  analysis,  an  important  tool  in   ecology, 
involves the analysis of the ratios of stable isotopes in materi-
als.  Examples  of  stable  isotopes  include  the  stable  isotopes 
of  hydrogen   2 H  (which  is  usually  symbolized  by  D,  refer-
ring to deuterium) and  1 H, and the stable isotopes of carbon, 
 13 C and  12 C. Stable isotope analysis has proved a very pow-
erful tool in studies of water uptake by plants. For example 
deuterium:hydrogen (D: 1 H) ratios, or  d D, have been used to 
quantify the relative use of summer versus winter rainfall by 
various plant growth forms in the deserts of southern Utah.

  Adaptations to the Environment

  Review Questions 

     1.  The body temperature of the seashore isopod  Ligia oceanica  is 
30 8 C under stones, where the relative humidity is 100%, but 26 8 C 
on  the  surface,  where  it  is  exposed  to  full  sun  and  the  relative 
humidity is 70%. Edney (1953) proposed that the isopods in the 
open  had  lower  body  temperatures  because  they  evaporatively 
cooled in the open air. Explain why evaporative cooling would be 
effective in the open air but nearly impossible under stones.  

    2.  Distinguish  among  vapor  pressure  deficit,  osmotic  pressure, 
and water potential. How can all three phenomena be expressed 
in the same units of measure: pascals?  

    3.  Leaf water potential is typically highest just before dawn and 
then decreases progressively through midday. Should lower leaf 
water potentials at midday increase or decrease the rate of water 
movement from soil to a plant? Assume soil water potential is 
approximately the same in early morning and midday. Are the 
water needs of the plant greater in early morning or at midday?  
    4.  Compare the water budgets of the tenebrionid beetle,  Onymac-
ris,  and the kangaroo rat,  Dipodomys,  shown in  figures 6.9  and 
 6.10 . Which of these two species obtains most of its water from 
metabolic water? Which relies most on condensation of fog as 
a water source? In which species do you see greater losses of 
water through the urine?  

    5.  In this chapter, we discussed water relations of tenebrionid bee-
tles from the Namib Desert. However, members of this family 
also occur in moist temperate environments. How should water 
loss  rates  vary  among  species  of  tenebrionids  from  different 
environments? On what assumptions do you base your predic-
tion? How would you test your prediction?  

    6.  In the Sonoran Desert, the only insects known to evaporatively 
cool are cicadas. Explain how cicadas can employ evaporative 
cooling while hundreds of other insect species in the same envi-
ronment cannot.  

    7.  Many desert species are well waterproofed. Evolution cannot, 
however, eliminate all evaporative water loss. Why not? (Hint: 
Think of the kinds of exchanges that an organism must maintain 
with its environment.)  

    8.  While  we  have  concentrated  in  chapter  6  on  regulation  of 
water  and  salts,  most  marine  invertebrates  are  isosmotic  with 
their external environment. What is a potential benefit of being 
isosmotic?  

    9.  Review  water  and  salt  regulation  by  marine  and  fresh water 
bony  fish.  Which  of  the  two  is  hypoosmotic  relative  to  its 
environment? Which of the two is hyperosmotic relative to its 
environment? Some sharks live in freshwater. How should the 
kidneys of marine and freshwater sharks function?  

   10.  Ronald Neilson and his colleagues (1992, 1995) used the envi-
ronmental  requirements  of  plants  to  predict  the  responses  of 
vegetation to climate change. In chapter 1, we briefly discussed 
the studies of Margaret Davis (1983, 1989) that reconstructed 
the movement of vegetation across eastern North America. She 
made this reconstruction using the pollen preserved in lake sed-
iments. How might the results of paleoecological studies, such 
as those of Davis, be used to refine models based on plant envi-
ronmental requirements? (Assume that you can also reasonably 
reconstruct  the  climate  when  historic  changes  in  vegetation 
occurred.)

support of the tree. Soon the vine will overwhelm and kill 
the tree, which will be reduced to a trellis for the vine. 

 Whether  on  coral  reef,  rain  forest,  or  abandoned  urban 
lot, organisms engage in an active search for energy and nutri-
ents. For most organisms, life boils down to converting energy 
and nutrients into descendants. Nutrients are the raw materials 
an organism must acquire from the environment to live. The 
energy used by different organisms comes in the form of light, 
organic molecules, or inorganic molecules. 

 How do we group organisms? We generally group them 
on the basis of shared evolutionary histories, creating taxa such 
as vertebrate animals, insects, coniferous trees, and orchids. 
However,  we  can  also  classify  organisms  by  their       trophic 
(feeding)  biology    .   Organisms  that  use  inorganic  sources  of 
both carbon and energy are called     autotrophs    (“self-feeders”). 
    Photosynthetic  autotrophs     use  carbon  dioxide  (CO 2 )  as  a 
source of carbon and light as a source of energy to synthesize 
    organic compounds    ,  molecules that contain carbon, such as 
sugars,  amino  acids,  and  fats.       Chemosynthetic  autotrophs    
synthesize organic molecules using CO 2  as a carbon source 
and inorganic chemicals, such as hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), as 
their  source  of  energy.       Heterotrophs     (“other-feeders”)  are 
organisms that use organic molecules both as a source of car-
bon and as a source of energy. 

     Prokaryotes    show more trophic diversity than do other 
groups of organisms ( fig. 7.2 ). Prokaryotes, which have cells

an unseen hole in the rain forest canopy and shines on one

heterotrophic,  most  plants  are  photosynthetic,  and  all  fungi 
and  animals  are  heterotrophic.  In  contrast,  the  prokaryotes 
include  photosynthetic,  chemosynthetic,  and  heterotrophic 
species, making them, as a group, the most trophically diverse 
organisms in the biosphere. 

 Some  of  the  most  ecologically  significant  discover-
ies  of  prokaryotic  trophic  diversity  have  come  from  studies 
of marine prokaryotes. For instance, Oded Béjà and Edward 
Delong and their research team from the Monterey Bay Aquar-
ium Research Institute and the University of Texas Medical 
School discovered that energy production from light involv-
ing  bacterial      rhodopsin     is  widely  distributed  in  the  oceans 
(Béjà et al. 2000, 2001). Rhodopsins are light-absorbing pig-
ments found in animal eyes and in the bacteria and archaea. 
The rhodopsin in bacteria and archaea performs a variety of 
functions,  including  that  of  a  proton  pump  involved  in ATP 
synthesis; that is, in the production of energy-rich molecules. 
A particularly intriguing discovery is that the light sensitiv-
ity  of  bacterial  rhodopsin  appears  adapted  to  local  varia-
tions in light quality. For instance, bacterial rhodopsin from 
deep, clear waters absorbs light most strongly within the blue 
range of the visible spectrum, while that from shallow coastal 
waters absorbs most strongly in the green range. Discoveries 
such as these and others (e.g., Kolber et al. 2000; Béjà et al. 
2002), are rapidly revolutionizing our understanding of how 
the biosphere works.  

   7.1  Photosynthetic Autotrophs 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 7.3  Define photosynthetically active radiation, photon 
flux density, rubisco, photorespiration, and bundle 
sheath.

 7.4  Describe C3, C4, and CAM photosynthesis.
 7.5  Explain the environmental conditions favorable to 

C3, C4, and CAM photosynthesis.

   Photosynthetic  autotrophs  synthesize  organic  molecules 
using   CO   2    as a source of carbon and light as an energy 
source.   Because  photosynthetic  organisms  use  light  as  a 
source  of  energy,  we  need  to  learn  about  light.  This  is  the 
topic we investigate next.  

   The Solar-Powered Biosphere 
 As we saw in chapters 2 and 3, solar energy powers the winds 
and  ocean  currents,  and  annual  variation  in  sunlight  inten-
sity drives the seasons. In chapter 5, we also discussed how 
organisms  use  sunlight  to  regulate  body  temperature.  Here, 
building on those discussions, we look at light as a source of 
energy for photosynthesis. 

 Light propagates through space as a wave, with all the 
properties of waves such as frequency and wavelength. When 
light interacts with matter, however, it acts not as a wave but 
as a particle. Particles of light, called  photons,  bear a finite 

quantity  of  energy.  Longer  wavelengths,  such  as   infrared 
light,  carry less energy than shorter wavelengths, such as  vis-
ible  and  ultraviolet light.  

 Infrared  light,  as  we  saw  in  chapter  5  (see  p.  110),  is 
very important for temperature regulation by organisms. This 
is  because  the  main  effect  of  infrared  light  on  matter  is  to 
increase the motion of whole molecules, which we measure 
as  increased  temperature.  However,  infrared  light  does  not 
carry enough energy to drive photosynthesis. At the other end 
of the solar spectrum, ultraviolet light carries so much energy 
that it breaks the covalent bonds of many organic molecules. 
Because  it  can  break  down  organic  molecules,  ultraviolet 
light  can  destroy  the  complex  biochemical  machinery  of 
photosynthesis. Between these extremes is the light we can 
see,  so-called  visible  light,  which  is  also  called      photosyn-
thetically active radiation    ,  or     PAR    .  PAR, with wavelengths 
between about 400 and 700 nm, carries sufficient energy to 
drive  the  light-dependent  reactions  of  photosynthesis  but 
not so much as to destroy organic molecules. PAR makes up 
about 42% of the total energy content of the solar spectrum 
at sea level. Because the pigments involved in photosynthe-
sis  absorb  unevenly  across  the  PAR  wavelengths,  however, 
the energy actually available for photosynthesis amounts to 
about 26% of the total (Agrawal 2010). Meanwhile, infrared 
light accounts for about 46% and ultraviolet light for most of 
the remainder. 

 Measuring PAR 
 Ecologists quantify PAR as photon flux density.     Photon flux 
density     is  the  number  of  photons  striking  a  square  meter 
surface each second. The number of photons is expressed as 
micromoles ( m mol), where 1 mole is Avogadro’s number of 
photons,  6.023   3   10 23 .  To  give  you  a  point  of  reference,  a 
photon flux density of about 4.6  m mol per square meter per 
second equals about 1 watt per square meter. Measuring light 
as  photosynthetic  photon  flux  density  makes  sense  ecologi-
cally because chlorophyll absorbs light as photons. 

 Light  changes  in  quantity  and  quality  with  latitude, 
with  the  seasons,  with  the  weather,  and  with  the  time  of 
day.  In  addition,  landscapes,  water,  and  even  organisms 
themselves  change  the  amount  and  quality  of  light.  For 
example, in aquatic environments (see chapter 3), only the 
superficial  euphotic  zone  receives  sufficient  light  to  sup-
port  photosynthetic  organisms.  In  addition,  light  changes 
in  quality,  as  well  as  quantity,  within  the  euphotic  zone, 
which ranges in depth from a few meters to about 100 m 
(see fig. 3.7). 

 As in the sea, sunlight changes as it shines through the 
canopy of a forest. A mature temperate or tropical forest can 
reduce the total quantity of light reaching the forest floor to 
about 1% to 2% of the amount shining on the forest canopy 
( fig.  7.3 ).  However,  forests  also  change  the  quality  of  sun-
light. Within the range of photosynthetically active radiation, 
leaves absorb mainly blue and red light and transmit mostly 
green light with a wavelength of about 550 nm. As in the deep 
sea, the organisms on the forest floor live in a kind of twilight. 
Only here, the twilight is green.

  Alternative Photosynthetic Pathways 
 During photosynthesis, the photosynthetic pigments of plants, 
algae,  or  bacteria  absorb  photons  of  light  and  transfer  their 
energy to electrons. Subsequently, the energy carried by these 
electrons is used to synthesize ATP and NADPH. These mol-
ecules,  in  turn,  serve  as  donors  of  electrons  and  energy  for 
the  synthesis  of  sugars.  In  this  way,  photosynthetic  organ-
isms  convert  the  electromagnetic  energy  of  sunlight  into 
energy-rich  organic  molecules,  the  fuel  that  feeds  most  of 

the biosphere. Within photosynthetic organisms, specific bio-
chemical pathways carry out this energy conversion; three dif-
ferent  biochemical  pathways  are  known:  C 3   photosynthesis, 
C 4  photosynthesis, and CAM photosynthesis. 

  C 3  Photosynthesis  
Biologists often speak of photosynthesis as “carbon  fixation,” 
which  refers  to  the  reactions  in  which  CO 2   becomes 
 incorporated into a carbon-containing acid. In the photosyn-
thetic  pathway  used  by  most  plants  and  all  algae,  the  CO 2  
first  combines  with  a  five-carbon  compound  called    ribulose 
bisphosphate,   or   RuBP.   The  product  of  this  initial  reaction, 
which  is  catalyzed  by  the  enzyme  RuBP  carboxylase,  or 
    rubisco    ,   is   phosphoglyceric  acid,   or   PGA,   a  three-carbon 
acid. Therefore, this photosynthetic pathway is usually called 
 C  3        photosynthesis     and  the  plants  that  employ  it,  including 
crop plants such as rice, wheat, and soybeans, are called C 3  
plants ( fig. 7.4 ). 

 To fix carbon, plants must open their stomata to let CO 2  
into their leaves, but as CO 2  enters, water exits. Water vapor 
flows out faster than CO 2  flows in. The movement of water is 
more rapid because the gradient in water concentration from 
the leaf to the atmosphere is generally much steeper than the 
gradient  in  CO 2   concentration  from  the  atmosphere  to  the 
leaf, particularly in arid climates. In C 3  plants, there is another 
factor that contributes to a low rate of CO 2  uptake: RuBP car-
boxylase has a low affinity for CO 2 . Relatively high rates of 
water loss are not a problem for plants that live in moist con-
ditions but in hot, dry climates, high rates of water loss can 
close the stomata and shut down photosynthesis. 

 Rubisco,  the  photosynthetic  enzyme  that  catalyzes  the 
reaction between CO 2  and RuBP, catalyzes another reaction 
that  combines  O 2   with  RuBP.  This  is  the  first  reaction  in  a 
process  called      photorespiration    ,   which  occurs  in  the  light,

consumes  energy,  and  produces  CO 2 .  Since  it  consumes 
energy, the net effect of photorespiration is to reduce the effi-
ciency of photosynthesis. Rubisco is capable of catalyzing the 
initial reaction of photorespiration because it has an affinity 
for O 2 . However, rubisco has a higher affinity for CO 2 . There-
fore, photorespiration is most significant energetically when 
CO 2  concentrations are reduced, which occurs mainly when 
a plant conserves water, during hot, dry periods, by closing 
stomata.  Under  these  conditions,  photosynthesis  reduces 
CO 2   and  increases  O 2   concentrations  within  the  air  spaces 
of a leaf. However, alternative photosynthetic pathways that 
reduce the problem of photorespiration have evolved in some 
groups of plants. These plants avoid high levels of photorespi-
ration mainly through mechanisms that concentrate CO 2 . One 
of those alternative pathways is C 4  photosynthesis.  

  C 4  Photosynthesis  
Two  alternative  photosynthetic  pathways  that  fix  and  store 
CO2  in  acids  containing  four  carbon  atoms  have  evolved. 
Light plays no part in carbon fixation, but the reactions that 
follow depend on light. Both alternative pathways separate the 
initial fixation of carbon from the light-dependent reactions. 

 One  of  these  alternative  pathways,   C   4        photosynthesis    ,  
separates  carbon  fixation  and  the  light-dependent  reactions 

of photosynthesis into separate cells ( fig. 7.5 ). C 4  plants fix 
CO 2   in  mesophyll  cells  by  combining  it  with   phosphoenol 
pyruvate,  or  PEP,  to produce a four-carbon acid, the source 
of the name “C 4 ” photosynthesis. This initial reaction, which 
is catalyzed by PEP carboxylase, concentrates CO 2 . Because 
PEP  carboxylase  has  a  high  affinity  for  CO 2 ,  C 4   plants  can 
reduce  their  internal  CO 2   concentrations  to  very  low  levels. 
Low internal concentration of CO 2  increases the gradient of 
CO 2   from  atmosphere  to  leaf,  which  in  turn  increases  the 
rate of diffusion of CO 2  inward. Consequently, compared to 
C 3   plants,  C 4   plants  need  to  open  fewer  stomata  to  deliver 
 sufficient  CO 2   to  photosynthesizing  cells.  By  having  fewer 
 stomata open, C 4  plants conserve water. 

 In C 4  plants, the acids produced during carbon fixation 
diffuse to specialized cells surrounding a structure called the 
    bundle  sheath    .   There,  deeper  in  the  leaf,  the  four-carbon 
acids are broken down to a three-carbon acid and CO 2 . In this 
way,  C 4   plants  can  build  up  the  CO 2   concentration  in  bun-
dle sheath cells to high levels, increasing the efficiency with 
which RuBP carboxylase combines CO 2  with RuBP to pro-
duce PGA. C 4  plants do better than C 3  plants under conditions 
of high temperature, high light intensity, and limited water. 

 C 4   photosynthesis  has  a  very  complex  evolutionary  his-
tory, ecology, and geography (Ehleringer, Cerling, and Helliker

1997; Sage 1999). This pathway, which has evolved indepen-
dently over 30 times, has been documented in approximately 
8,000  to  10,000  plant  species  belonging  to  18  plant  families. 
Currently,  about  half  the  grass  species  employ  C 4   photosyn-
thesis, which is particularly prominent among the tropical and 
subtropical grasses. The expansion 8 to 5 million years ago of 
tropical and subtropical grasslands, which are dominated by C 4  
grasses, was associated with the evolution of a high diversity of 
grazing mammals and their predators. Though the vast majority 
of plants employ C 3  photosynthesis, C 4  plants are estimated to 
contribute up to 20% of global terrestrial primary production. 
They are also of great economic significance, since many impor-
tant crops, such as corn, and many noxious weeds are C 4  plants. 
Because the C 4  pathway is more efficient than the C 3  pathway 
under conditions of low atmospheric CO 2 , ecologists have pre-
dicted  that  rising  levels  of  atmospheric  CO 2   (see  chapter  23, 

fig. 23.21) will favor C 3  plants. However, we now know that 
any  future  changes  in  the  relative  abundance  of  C 3   and  C 4  
plants will be mediated by a complex interaction between levels 
of atmospheric CO 2  and the influences of temperature, mois-
ture, and nutrient availability (Feggestad et al. 2004).  

  CAM Photosynthesis  
    CAM     (crassulacean  acid  metabolism)      photosynthesis     is 
largely  found  in  succulent  plants  in  arid  and  semiarid  envi-
ronments  and  among  epiphytes  growing  in  the  canopies  of 
forests. In this pathway, carbon fixation takes place at night, 
when lower temperatures reduce the rate of water loss during 
CO 2  uptake. CAM plants fix carbon by combining CO 2  with 
PEP to form four-carbon acids. These acids are stored until 
daylight, when they are broken down into pyruvate and CO 2 , 
which then enters the C 3  photosynthetic pathway ( fig. 7.6 ). In

CAM plants, all these reactions take place in the same cells. 
While CAM plants do not normally show very high rates of 
photosynthesis, their water use efficiency, as estimated by the 
mass of CO 2  fixed per kilogram of water used, is higher than 
that of either C 3  or C 4  plants. 

 Separating initial carbon fixation from the other reactions 
reduces  water  losses  during  photosynthesis:  C 3   plants  lose 
from about 380 to 900 g of water for every gram (dry weight) 
of tissue produced. C 4  plants lose from about 250 to 350 g of 
water  per  gram  of  tissue  produced,  while  CAM  plants  lose 
approximately 50 g of water per gram of new tissue. The dif-
ferences in these numbers give us one of the reasons C 4  and 
CAM plants do well in hot, dry environments. 

 Whether  the  pathway  of  carbon  fixation  is  CAM,  C 3 , 
or  C 4 ,  plants  and  photosynthetic  algae  and  bacteria  capture 
energy  from  sunlight  and  carbon  from  CO 2 .  Now  let’s  turn 
from photosynthetic autotrophs to autotrophs that obtain their 
energy from inorganic molecules, to the chemosynthetic auto-
trophs. Although it may be less familiar to most of us, chemo-
synthesis may be the oldest way of making a living.

tage to C 3  plants over C 4  plants?         

  7.2  Chemosynthetic Autotrophs 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 7.6  List several types of chemosynthetic autotrophs.
 7.7  Discuss the ecological significance of chemosyn-

thetic autotrophy.

   Chemosynthetic  autotrophs  synthesize  organic  mol-
ecules  using    CO   2     as  a  carbon  source  and  inorganic 
molecules  as  an  energy  source.  
In  1977,  a  routine 
dive  by  a  small  submersible  carried  scientists  exploring 
the  Galápagos  rift  to  a  grand  discovery.  Their  discovery 
changed  our  view  of  how  a  biosphere  can  be  structured. 
Ecologists had long assumed that photosynthesis provides 
the  energy  for  nearly  all  life  in  the  sea.  However,  these 
unsuspecting scientists came across a world based upon an 
entirely  different  energy  source,  energy  captured  by  che-
mosynthesis. The world they discovered was inhabited by 
giant  worms  up  to  4  m  long  with  no  digestive  tracts,  by 
filter-feeding  clams,  and  by  carnivorous  crabs  tumbling 
over each other in tangled abundance (see fig. 3.8). These 
organisms lived on nutrients discharged by deep-sea volca-
nic activity through an oceanic rift, a crack in the seafloor. 

Interconnected  systems  of  rifts  extend  tens  of  thousands 
of kilometers along the seafloor. Subsequent explorations 
have confirmed that chemosynthetic communities exist at 
many points of volcanic discharge along the seafloor. 

 The  autotrophs  upon  which  these  submarine  oases 
depend are chemosynthetic bacteria. Some of the most com-
mon  are  sulfur  oxidizers,  bacteria  that  use  CO 2   as  a  source 
of carbon and get their energy by oxidizing elemental sulfur, 
hydrogen sulfide, or thiosulfite. The submarine volcanic vents 
with  which  these  organisms  are  associated  discharge  large 
quantities  of  sulfide-rich  warm  water.  The  sulfur-oxidizing 
bacteria that exploit this resource around the vents are of two 
types: free-living forms and those that live within the tissues 
of a variety of invertebrate animals, including the giant tube 
worms ( fig. 7.7 ). Other communities dependent upon sulfur-
oxidizing  bacteria  have  been  discovered  in  thermal  vents  in 
deep freshwater lakes, in surface hot springs, and in caves. 

 Other  chemosynthetic  bacteria  oxidize  ammonium 
(NH 4   1  ), nitrite (NO 2   2  ), iron (Fe 2 1  ), hydrogen (H 2 ), or carbon 
monoxide (CO). Of these, the nitrifying bacteria, which oxi-
dize ammonium to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate, are undoubt-
edly among the most ecologically important organisms in the 
biosphere.  Figure 7.8  summarizes one of the energy-yielding 
reactions exploited by nitrifying bacteria. The importance of 
these bacteria is due to their role in cycling nitrogen. As we 
will see later in chapter 7 (see p. 157), nitrogen is a key ele-
ment in the chemical makeup of individual organisms. It also 
plays a central role in the economy of the entire biosphere (see 
chapter 19). Nitrogen will frequently enter our discussions in 
later  chapters.  In  the Applications  section  of  chapter  7,  we 
will see how nitrifying bacteria have contributed to a pollu-
tion problem associated with an old gold mine and how other 
bacteria and fungi can be stimulated to solve the problem. 

 The  chemosynthetic  and  photosynthetic  autotrophs 
opened the way for the evolution of organisms that could meet 
their energy and carbon needs using organic molecules. And 
this way of making a living did indeed evolve. We call these 
organisms heterotrophs.

      1.   In general, what must be true of the chemical energy of 
the products of chemosynthesis compared to that of the 
reactants, for instance, the chemical energy of the prod-

   Heterotrophic  organisms  use  organic  molecules  both  as  a

ultimately, on the carbon and energy fixed by autotrophs. Het-
erotrophs have evolved numerous ways of feeding. This trophic 
variety has stimulated ecologists to invent numerous terms to 
describe the ways heterotrophs feed; a few of these terms have 
already crept into our discussions. In chapter 2, we referred to 
the  “browsers”  of  Mediterranean  woodlands  and  shrublands, 
and in chapter 3, when discussing James Karr’s Index of Bio-
logical  Integrity,  we  defined  “omnivores,”  “insectivores,”  and 
“piscivores.” A  full  list  of  the  trophic  categories  proposed  by 
ecologists would be impossibly long and not especially useful to 
this discussion. So, we will concentrate on three major catego-
ries:     herbivores    ,  organisms that eat plants;     carnivores    ,  organ-
isms that mainly eat animals; and     detritivores    ,  organisms that 
feed on nonliving organic matter, usually the remains of plants. 
While these categories do not capture all the trophic diversity in 
nature, they are not arbitrary. Herbivores, carnivores, and detriti-
vores have evolved to solve fundamentally different problems in 
order to obtain adequate supplies of energy and nutrients.  

   Chemical Composition and Nutrient 
Requirements 
 We can get some idea of the nutrient requirements of organ-
isms by examining their chemical composition. Biologists have 
found that the chemical composition of organisms is very simi-
lar. Just five elements (carbon [C], oxygen [O], hydrogen [H], 
nitrogen [N], and phosphorus [P]) make up 93% to 97% of the 
biomass of plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. But organisms 
allocate elements in different ways. Of these four groups, plants 
have the most variable nutrient content. Plant tissues generally 
contain about 45% carbon and much lower concentrations of 
nitrogen and phosphorus. Plant leaves contain around 2% nitro-
gen and less than 0.3% phosphorus. In contrast, invertebrates, 
bacteria, and fungi average 5% to 10% nitrogen and about 1% 
phosphorus. Vertebrate  animals  have  an  even  higher  require-
ment  for  calcium  and  phosphorus  to  support  the  growth  and 
maintenance of a mineral-rich internal skeleton. Fast-growing 
organisms  require  relatively  more  nutrient-rich  resources  to 
support their higher allocation to tissue building compared to 
those with slower grow rates. Thus, how an organism allocates 
elements has consequences for its elemental requirements. 

 Ecologists  use  the  principles  of  stoichiometry,  which 
means literally “measuring chemical elements,” to study the

relationships  between  ratios  of  elements  in  a  food  resource 
to those ratios in an organism eating that food resource. Such 
studies  are  the  subject  of      ecological  stoichiometry    ,   which 
concerns the balance of multiple chemical elements in ecolog-
ical interactions, for example, the balance of multiple chemi-
cal elements between plants and the herbivores that consume 
them. In this instance, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in plants 
is much higher than in the herbivores eating them. When such 
a  large  difference,  or  imbalance,  in  elemental  composition 
exists, the consumer must eat more food to obtain the limiting 
nutrient, in this case nitrogen. Differences in elemental ratios 
among  tissues  or  among  organisms  significantly  influence 
what  organisms  eat,  how  rapidly  consumers  reproduce,  and 
how rapidly organisms decompose (see chapter 19, p. 419). 

 If  carbon,  oxygen,  hydrogen,  nitrogen,  and  phosphorus 
make up 93% to 97% of living biomass, then what accounts for 
the remainder? Dozens of other elements occur in the tissues 
of organisms. Essential plant nutrients include potassium (K), 
calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), iron 
(Fe), manganese (Mn), boron (B), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and 
molybdenum (Mo). Most of these nutrients are also essential for 
other organisms. Some organisms require additional nutrients. 
For instance, animals also require sodium (Na) and iodine (I). 

 Plants obtain carbon from the air through their stomata. 
They  obtain  other  essential  nutrients  from  the  soil  through 

their roots. For the most part, animals obtain both the energy 
they require and essential nutrients with their food. Let’s now 
turn to the energy and nutrient relations of herbivorous, detri-
tivorous, and carnivorous animals. 

  Herbivores 
 While  a  band  of  zebra  grazing  on  the  plains  of Africa  or  a 
sea turtle feeding on sea grass in a tropical lagoon may sug-
gest a life of ease, this image does not accurately represent the 
life of an herbivore. Herbivores face substantial problems that 
begin at the level of nutritional chemistry. 

 Herbivores must compensate for large differences between 
the nutrient content of their food and their own requirements 
for  growth  and  metabolism.  How  ubiquitous  is  the  nutrient 
imbalance  between  herbivores  and  their  food?  James  Elser 
and  colleagues  (2000)  sought  to  answer  this  question  and 
compiled a large data set for C:N and C:P ratios of plants and 
herbivorous insects. They found that herbivorous insects must 
overcome an average five- to tenfold difference in the ratio of 
carbon to nutrients they require ( fig. 7.9 ). To compensate for 
these  differences  in  elemental  ratios,  insects  must  consume 
large amounts of high C:N and C:P plant tissue to meet their 
requirements for nitrogen and phosphorus. 

 Herbivores must also overcome the physical and chemical 
defenses of plants. Some physical defenses are obvious, such as

 C:N ratios differ a great deal among the tissues of 

 The use of cellulose and lignin to strengthen tissues may 
also provide plants with a kind of chemical defense. Increas-
ing the cellulose and lignin content of tissues increases their 
C:N ratios. An increased C:N ratio decreases the nutritional 
value  of  plant  tissues.  Some  plant  tissues  have  C:N  ratios 
that  are  far  higher  than  the  average  values  we  saw  in   fig-
ure 7.9 . For instance, the tree trunks that make up most of 
the plant biomass in a pine forest have a C:N ratio of over 
300:1 ( fig. 7.11 ). This ratio is much higher than that of either 
branches  or  needles. The  living  needles  of  pine  trees  have 
C:N  ratios  very  similar  to  those  of  understory  herbs  living 
on the forest floor. 

 In addition, most animals cannot digest either cellulose 
or lignin. Those that can, generally do so with the help of bac-
teria, fungi, or protists that live in their digestive tracts. This 

 Herbivores must overcome the wide variety of

thorns that deter some herbivores entirely and slow the rate of 
feeding of others ( fig. 7.10 ). However, plants also often deploy 
a variety of more subtle physical defenses. Grasses incorporate 
large amounts of abrasive silica into their tissues, which makes 
feeding on them difficult and which has apparently selected for 
specialized  dentition  among  grazing  mammals.  Many  plants 
toughen their tissues with large quantities of cellulose and lig-
nin, producing leaves that are fibrous and difficult to chew.

suggests that the cellulose and lignin in plants may be a first 
line  of  chemical  defense  against  herbivores,  a  defense  that 
most herbivores overcome with the help of other organisms. 

 When  ecologists  talk  about  plant  chemical  defenses, 
however, they are generally referring to two other classes of 
chemicals, toxins and digestion-reducing substances. Toxins 
are chemicals that kill, impair, or repel most would-be con-
sumers. Digestion-reducing substances are generally phenolic 
compounds such as tannins that bind to plant proteins, inhib-
iting  their  breakdown  by  enzymes  and  further  reducing  the 
already low availability of nitrogen in plant tissues. 

 Chemists have isolated thousands of toxins from plant tis-
sues, and the list continues to grow. The great variety of plant 
toxins  defies  easy  description  and  generalization.  However, 
one  interesting  pattern  is  that  more  tropical  plants  contain 
toxic alkaloids than do temperate species ( fig. 7.12 ). In addi-
tion, on average, the alkaloids produced by tropical plants are 
more  toxic  than  their  temperate  counterparts.  Despite  these 
higher levels of chemical defense, herbivores appear to remove 
approximately  11%  to  48%  of  leaf  biomass  in  tropical  for-
ests, while in temperate forests they remove about 7%. These 
higher levels of herbivore attack on tropical plants suggest that 
natural selection for chemical defense is more intense in tropi-
cal plant populations. 

 The  generalization  about  higher  levels  of  chemical 
defense among tropical plants also appears to apply to marine 
algae. Robin Bolser and Mark Hay (1996) tested the hypoth-
esis that tropical seaweeds have more chemical defenses than 
temperate  seaweeds.  They  gathered  several  species  of  sea-
weeds from the coast of temperate North Carolina and from 
the tropical Bahama Islands. Bolser and Hay were careful to 
pick the same species of seaweed in the two study sites or at 
least to pick species that belonged to the same genus. They 
tested the relative palatability of temperate and tropical sea-
weeds using temperate and tropical sea urchins. 

 The  researchers  were  careful  to  preserve  any  chemical 
defenses  their  study  algae  might  contain. They  cleaned  and 
then froze the seaweeds in a freezer (220 8 C) on the research 
ship.  On  shore,  the  seaweeds  were  transferred  to  a  colder 
freezer (270 8 C) to minimize chemical changes. 

 To  remove  the  potential  confounding  effect  of  various 
physical factors, Bolser and Hay created artificial algae to test 
their  hypothesis.  They  did  this  by  freeze-drying  samples  of 
each seaweed and grinding them in a coffee mill. The pow-
dered algae was then mixed with agar at a concentration of 
0.1 g alga per milliliter of agar. The warm alga and agar mix-
ture was poured into a mold set on screening. As the mixture 
gelled  it  attached  to  the  screening.  The  result  was  strips  of 
artificial seaweed that could be cut up into equal-sized squares 
and presented to sea urchins in equal numbers. This method 
of  presentation  also  provided  an  easy  means  of  quantifying 
the actual amount of seaweed eaten. 

 The  results  of  this  study  showed  a  clear  preference  for 
temperate species of seaweed ( fig. 7.13 ). When given a choice 
the  urchins  removed  approximately  twice  as  much  of  the 
available temperate seaweed. In addition, both temperate and 
tropical  urchins  showed  a  similar  preference  for  temperate 
seaweeds. What caused the lower palatability of the tropical 
seaweeds? In additional tests, Bolser and Hay showed that the 
tropical seaweeds have more potent chemical defenses. So we 
see  that  this  study  produced  a  pattern  in  the  sea  that  paral-
lels the better-known pattern in tropical and temperate forests. 
Tropical plants and algae appear to possess stronger chemical 
defenses. 

 No defense is perfect; the defenses of most plants work 
against some herbivores, but not all. The tobacco plant uses 
nicotine, a toxic alkaloid, to repel herbivorous insects, most 
of  which  die  suddenly  after  ingesting  nicotine.  However,

  Adaptations to the Environment

several insects specialize in eating tobacco plants and manage 
to  avoid  the  toxic  effects  of  nicotine.  Some  simply  excrete 
nicotine,  while  others  convert  it  to  nontoxic  molecules. 
Similarly,  toxins  and  repellents  produced  by  plants  in  the 
cucumber  family  repel  most  herbivorous  insects  but  attract 
the  spotted  cucumber  beetle. This  beetle  is  a  specialist  that 
feeds mainly on members of the cucumber family. Some spe-
cialized herbivores go even further by using plant toxins as a 
source of nutrition! 

 The  world  may  appear  green  to  us,  but  to  herbivores 
only some shades of green are edible. Plant defenses and the 
adaptations  of  herbivores  that  overcome  those  defenses  are 
complex.  

 Detritivores 
 The problems faced by herbivores in their search for energy 
and nutrients are related to those faced by detritivores, which 
feed  on  dead  plant  material.  Because  they  play  key  roles 
in  the  cycling  of  nutrients  (see  chapter  19),  detritivores  are 
essential  to  sustaining  life  on  earth.  These  organisms  con-
sume  food  that  is  rich  in  carbon  and  energy  but  very  poor 
in  nitrogen.  In  fact,  plant  tissues,  already  relatively  low  in 
nitrogen when living (see  figs. 7.9  and  7.11 ), are even lower 
in nitrogen content when cast off by plants as detritus. Keith 
Killingbeck and Walt Whitford (1996) averaged the nitrogen 
contents of living and dead leaves of many plant species of 
environments  from  tropical  rain  forests  through  deserts  and 
temperate forests. Their results show that in all these environ-
ments, living leaves contain about twice the nitrogen as dead 
leaves ( fig. 7.14 ). 

  Carnivores 
 Carnivores consume animal prey, to which they are stoichio-
metrically similar, that is, both predators and prey have low 
C:N and C:P ratios. However, carnivores cannot go out into 
their environment and choose their nutritionally rich prey at 
will.  Most  prey  species  are  masters  of  defense.  One  of  the 
most basic prey defenses is camouflage. Predators cannot eat 
prey they cannot find. Other prey defenses include anatomical 
defenses such as spines, shells, repellents, and poisons, and 
behavioral defenses such as flight, taking refuge in burrows, 
banding  together  in  groups,  playing  dead,  fighting,  flashing 
bright  colors,  spitting,  hissing,  and  screaming  at  predators. 
It’s enough to spoil your appetite! 

 Prey that carry a threat to predators often advertise that 
fact,  usually  by  being  brightly  colored  or  conspicuous  in 
some other way. The conspicuous, or  aposematic,  colors of 
many distasteful or toxic butterflies, snakes, and nudibranchs 
warn  predators  that  “feeding  on  me  may  be  hazardous  to 
your  health.” Aposematic,  or  warning,  coloration  generally 
consists  of  sharply  contrasting  patches  of  orange  or  yellow 
and  black.  Many  noxious  organisms,  such  as  stinging  bees 
and wasps, poisonous snakes, and butterflies, seem to mimic 
each  other.  This  form  of  comimicry  among  several  species 
of noxious organisms is called     Müllerian mimicry    .  In addi-
tion, many harmless species appear to mimic noxious ones. 

Live leaves contain twice 
the nitrogen as dead leaves.

For  instance,  king  snakes  mimic  coral  snakes,  and  syrphid 
flies mimic bees and wasps. This form of mimicry is called 
    Batesian mimicry    .  In Batesian mimicry, the noxious species 
serves as the model ( fig. 7.15 a  ) and the harmless species is 
the mimic ( fig. 7.15 b  ). 

 How have prey populations evolved their defenses? The 
predators  themselves  are  usually  the  agents  of  selection  for 
refined prey defense. In one of the most thoroughly studied 
cases  of  natural  selection  for  prey  defense,  H.  Kettlewell 
(1959)  found  that  predation  by  birds  favors  camouflage 
among peppered moths,  Biston betularia.  Birds eliminate the 
more  conspicuous  members  of  the  peppered  moth  popula-
tion, leaving the better camouflaged ( fig. 7.16 ). Kettlewell’s 
research methods and results have been strongly supported by 
the more recent research on bird predation on peppered moths 
(Cook  et  al.  2012).  In  general,  predators  eliminate  poorly 
defended  individuals  and  leave  the  well  defended.  Conse-
quently,  the  average  level  of  defense  in  the  prey  population 
increases with time. 

 As a consequence of prey defenses, the rate of prey cap-
ture  by  predators  is  often  low.  For  instance,  wolves  on  Isle 
Royale in Lake Superior capture moose only about 8% of the 
times  they  try.  Bernd  Heinrich  (1984)  found  that  predatory 
bald-faced hornets have an even lower success rate. The hor-
nets hunt other insects by flying rapidly among the plants in 
their environment and pouncing on objects that may be prey. 
Because  their  prey  are  well  camouflaged,  the  hornets  often 
pounce  on  inanimate  objects.  Heinrich  was  able  to  observe 
260  pounces  by  hornets. About  72%  of  these  pounces  were 
directed  at  inanimate  objects,  such  as  bird  droppings  and 
brown  spots  on  leaves.  Another  21%  of  the  pounces  were 
directed at insects, such as bumblebees and other wasps, that 
are too well defended to be prey. Only 7% of the pounces were 
on potential insect prey. The hornets managed to capture two

of  these,  a  moth  and  a  fly.  Heinrich’s  observations  indicate 
bald-faced hornets have a prey capture rate of less than 1%. 

 Though  elusive,  the  prey  of  carnivores  are  generally 
similar in nutrient content. Consequently, carnivores, which 
are  often  widely  distributed  geographically,  can  vary  their 
diets from one region to another. The Eurasian otter,  Lutra 
lutra,   which  is  distributed  from  Europe  and  North  Africa 
through northern and central Asia, changes its diet based on 
the local availability of prey. Manuel Graça and F. X. Fer-
rand  de Almeida  (1983)  compared  otter  diets  along  a  gra-
dient  from  northern  to  southern  Europe  ( fig.  7.17 ).  On  the 
Shetland  Islands,  otter  diets  are  over  91%  fish,  with  the 
remainder consisting almost entirely of crabs. To this staple 
diet of fish, the otters of England add frogs, mammals, birds, 
and  crustaceans.  Meanwhile,  the  diets  of  otters  in  central 
Portugal are less than one-third fish, with the remainder con-
sisting of frogs, water snakes, mammals, and aquatic insects. 

While some of the items that Graça and Ferrand de Almeida 
found  on  the  otters’  menus  may  be  esthetically  unaccept-
able to us, they are all fairly similar in terms of their carbon, 
nitrogen,  and  phosphorus  content;  they  are  just  packaged 
differently. 

 Because  predators  must  catch  and  subdue  their  prey, 
they often select prey by size, a behavior that ecologists call 
    size-selective predation    .  Because of this behavior, prey size 
is  often  significantly  correlated  with  predator  size,  espe-
cially among solitary predators. One such solitary predator, 
the  puma,  or  mountain  lion,   Puma  concolor,   ranges  from 
the Canadian Yukon to the tip of South America ( fig. 7.18 ). 
Puma  size  changes  substantially  along  this  latitudinal  gra-
dient. Augustin Iriarte and his colleagues (1990) found that 
as  pumas  increase  in  size,  the  average  size  of  their  prey 
also  increases  ( fig.  7.19 ).  Mammals  make  up  over  90%  of 
the puma’s diet, and large mammals, especially deer, are its

main prey in the northern part of its range in North  America, 
where  pumas  are  larger.  In  the  tropics  where  pumas  are 
smaller, they feed mainly on medium and small prey, espe-
cially  rodents.  Why  should  different-sized  pumas  feed  on 
different-sized  prey?  One  reason  is  that  large  prey  may  be 
difficult to subdue and may even injure the predator, while 
small prey may be difficult to find or catch. As we shall see 
later in chapter 7, size-selective predation may also have an 
energetic basis. 

 In summary, predators consume nutritionally rich but elu-
sive and often well-defended prey. As a consequence, preda-
tors and their prey appear engaged in a coevolutionary race. 
In this race, predators eliminate poorly defended individuals 

  Figure 7.19  
latitude (data from Iriarte et al. 1990).  

 The size of pumas and their prey changes with 

in the population and average prey defenses improve. As aver-
age prey defenses improve, the poorer hunters go hungry and 
leave fewer offspring. Consequently, improved hunting skills 
evolve in the predator population, which exerts further selec-
tion  on  the  prey  population.  Such  selection  was  central  to 
chapter 4, which focused on population genetics and natural 
selection. 

 As we have seen, the trophic diversity among organisms is 
great. However, at least one ecological characteristic is shared 
by all organisms, regardless of the trophic group to which they 
belong—all organisms take in energy at a limited rate.

   The rate at which organisms can take in energy is limited. 
As children, many of us imagined that if we had free access 
to a candy or ice cream shop, we would consume an infinite 
quantity  of  goodies.  But  even  if  we  were  given  a  chance 
to do this, our rate of intake would be limited, not by sup-
ply  but  by  the  rate  at  which  we  could  process  what  we 
ate. In reality, the rate of intake of candy or ice cream for 
most children is limited, at least in the short term, by how 
much is available. The same is true in nature. However, if 
organisms  are  not  limited  by  the  availability  of  energy  in 
the environment, their energy intake is limited by internal 
constraints. Limits on the potential rate of energy intake by 
animals have been demonstrated by studying how feeding 
rate  increases  as  the  availability  of  food  increases.  Limits 
on rates of energy intake by plants have been demonstrated 
by  studying  how  photosynthetic  rate  responds  to  photon 
flux density.  

   Photon Flux and Photosynthetic 
Response Curves 
 Plant physiologists generally test the photosynthetic potential 
of plants in environments that are ideal for particular species 
being  studied.  These  environments  have  abundant  nutrients 
and water, normal concentrations of oxygen and carbon diox-
ide, ideal temperatures, and high humidity. If you gradually 
increase the quantity of light shining on plants growing under 
these conditions, that is, if you increase the photon flux den-
sity, the plants’ rates of photosynthesis gradually increase and 
then level off. At low light intensities, photosynthesis increases 
linearly with photon flux density. At intermediate light levels, 
photosynthetic rate rises more slowly. Finally, at higher light 
levels,  but  well  below  that  of  full  sunlight,  photosynthesis 

levels  off.  Organisms  that  show  this  type  of  photosynthetic 
response  curve  include  terrestrial  plants,  lichens,  planktonic 
algae, and benthic algae. 

 The  photosynthetic  response  curves  of  different  plant 
species generally level off at different maximum rates of pho-
tosynthesis. This  rate  in   figure  7.20   is  indicated  as    P   max   . A 
second  difference  among  photosynthetic  response  curves  is 
the  photon  flux  density,  or      irradiance    ,   required  to  produce 
the maximum rate of photosynthesis. The irradiance required 
to saturate photosynthesis is shown in  figure 7.20  as   I   sat  . 

 Differences  in  photosynthetic  response  curves  have 
been  used  to  divide  plants  into  “sun”  and  “shade”  species. 
The  response  curves  of  plants  from  shady  habitats  suggest 
selection  for  efficiency  at  low  light  levels,  that  is,  low  irra-
diance. The photosynthetic rate of shade plants levels off at 
lower  irradiance,  and  they  are  often  damaged  by  high  irra-
diance. However, at very low light levels, shade plants usu-
ally  have  higher  photosynthetic  rates  than  sun  plants.  Park 
Nobel  (1977)  determined  the  photosynthetic  response  curve 
for the maidenhair fern,  Adiantum decorum.  This plant gener-
ally grows at low light levels in forests. In one of Nobel’s tri-
als, the maximum rate of     net photosynthesis    by  A. decorum,  
P max , was approximately 9  m mol of CO 2  per square meter per 
second. Net photosynthesis can be measured as total, or gross, 
CO 2  uptake during photosynthesis minus the CO 2  produced 
by the plant’s own respiration. The amount of light required 
to  achieve  this  maximum  rate  of  photosynthesis,  I sat ,  was  a 
PAR photon flux density of about 300  m mol per square meter 
per second ( fig. 7.21 ). The values of P max  and I sat  shown by 
 A. decorum  are much lower than those observed in plants that 
have evolved in sunny environments. 

 Herbs and short-lived perennial shrubs that have evolved 
in sunny environments show high maximum rates of photo-
synthesis,  P max ,  at  relatively  high  irradiance,  I sat .  One  such 

As photosynthetic flux density 
increases, the rate of photosynthesis 
by a plant, alga, or photoautotrophic 
bacterium increases until it levels off 
at some maximum rate.

plant,   Encelia  farinosa,   grows  in  the  hot  deserts  of  North 
America. James Ehleringer and his colleagues (1976) found 
that   E.  farinosa   has  a  high  P max ,  more  than  four  times  that 
of  A. decorum.  In addition,  E. farinosa  reaches these maxi-
mum rates of photosynthesis at a photon flux density of about 
2,000  m mol per square meter per second (see  fig. 7.21 ). This 
combination  of  high  P max   and  I sat   allows   E.  farinosa   to  fix 
energy at a high rate during the infrequent times when water 
is plentiful in its desert environment. 

 Whether of shade or sun plant, photosynthetic response 
curves eventually level off. In other words, the rate at which 
photosynthetic organisms can take in energy is limited. Ani-
mals also take in energy at a limited rate.  

  Food Density and Animal 
Functional Response 
 If you gradually increase the amount of food available to a 
hungry animal, its rate of feeding increases and then  levels 
off.  This  relationship  is  called  the      functional  response    .  
Ecologists  use  graphs  to  describe  functional  responses. 
C.  S.  Holling  (1959)  described  three  types  of  functional 
responses, all of which level off at a maximum feeding rate 
( fig. 7.22 ).

  Figure 7.22  

 Three theoretical functional response curves.  

 Type  1  functional  responses  are  those  in  which  feed-
ing  rate  increases  linearly  (as  a  straight  line)  as  food  den-
sity increases and then levels off abruptly at some maximum 
feeding  rate.  The  only  animals  that  have  type  1  functional 
responses are consumers that require little or no time to pro-
cess their food; for example, some filter-feeding aquatic ani-
mals that feed on small prey. 

 In a type 2 functional response, feeding rate at first rises 
linearly at low food density, rises more slowly at intermedi-
ate food density, and then levels off at high densities. At low 
food  densities,  feeding  rate  appears  limited  by  how  long  it 
takes the animal to find food. At intermediate food densities, 
the animal’s feeding rate is partly limited by the time spent 
searching for food and partly by the time spent handling food. 
“Handling” refers to such activities as cracking the shells of 
nuts  or  snails,  removing  distasteful  scent  glands  from  prey, 
and chasing down elusive prey. At high food density an ani-
mal does not have to search for food at all and feeding rate is 
determined almost entirely by how fast the animal can handle 
its food. At these very high densities, the animal, in effect, has 
“all the food it can handle.” 

 The type 3 functional response is S-shaped. At low food 
densities,  type  3  functional  response  curves  increase  more 
slowly than during either type 1 or type 2 functional response. 
Food intake then rises steeply at intermediate food densities, 
eventually leveling off at higher densities. Holling’s research 

 

Chapter 7 

  Energy and Nutrient Relations

165

provided a theoretical basis for later empirical studies of ani-
mal functional response. 

 Of the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of functional response 
curves described by ecologists, the most common is the type 2 
functional response. Here are some examples. John Gross and 
several colleagues (1993) conducted a well-controlled study of 
the  functional  responses  of  13  mammalian  herbivore  species. 
The researchers manipulated food density by offering each her-
bivore various densities of fresh alfalfa,  Medicago sativa.  The 
rate  of  food  intake  was  measured  as  the  difference  between 
the amount of alfalfa offered to an animal at the beginning of a 
trial and how much was left over at the end. Gross and his col-
leagues ran 36 to 125 feeding trials for each herbivore species 
for a total of over 900 trials. Every species of herbivore exam-
ined, from moose to lemmings to prairie dogs, showed a type 2 
functional  response.   Figure  7.23   shows  the  type  2  functional 
response by moose,  Alces alces.  

 Gross  and  his  colleagues  worked  in  a  controlled  experi-
mental  environment.  Do  consumers  in  natural  environments 
also show a type 2 functional response? To answer this ques-
tion,  let’s  examine  the  functional  response  of  wolves,   Canis 
lupus,  feeding on moose. François Messier (1994) examined the 
interactions between moose and wolves in North America. He 
focused on areas where moose are the dominant large prey spe-
cies eaten by wolves. When moose density in various regions 
was plotted against the rate at which they were killed by wolves, 
the result was a clear type 2 functional response ( fig. 7.24 ). 

 Type 2 functional responses are remarkably similar to the 
photosynthetic response curves shown by plants (see  fig. 7.21 ) 
and have the same implications. Even if you provide an ani-
mal  with  unlimited  food,  its  energy  intake  eventually  levels 
off at some maximum rate. This is the rate at which energy 
intake is limited by internal rather than external constraints. 
As we shall see in the next Concept, limited energy intake is a 
fundamental assumption of optimal foraging theory. 

Moose feeding in a 
controlled experimental 
setting show a type 2 
functional response.

  Concept 7.4 Review 

1.   In  type  3  functional  response,  what  mechanisms  may 
be responsible for low rates of food intake—compared 
to type 1 and type 2 functional response—at low food 
densities?  

     2.   Why are plants such as mosses living in the understory of 
a dense forest, which show higher rates of photosynthesis 
at low irradiance, unable to live in environments where 
they are exposed to full sun for long periods of time?  

     3.   What conclusion can we draw from the parallel between 
photosynthetic response curves in plants and functional 
response curves of animals?       

  7.5  Optimal Foraging Theory 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 7.15  Define optimal foraging theory and optimization.
 7.16  Critique the match between a model for  predicting 

the diet breadth of a predator and foraging by 
 bluegill sunfish.

 7.17  Compare optimal foraging by plants and animals.

   Optimal  foraging  theory  models  feeding  behavior  as  an 
optimizing process.   Evolutionary ecologists predict that if 
organisms have limited access to energy, natural selection is 
likely to favor individuals within a population that are more 
effective  at  acquiring  energy.  This  prediction  spawned  an 
area  of  ecological  inquiry  called      optimal  foraging  theory    .
Optimal  foraging  theory  assumes  that  if  energy  supplies 
are  limited,  organisms  cannot  simultaneously  maximize  all 
of life’s functions; for example, allocation of energy to one 

166 

Section II 

  Adaptations to the Environment

function, such as growth or reproduction, reduces the amount 
of energy available to other functions, such as defense. As a 
consequence, there must be compromises between competing 
demands. This seemingly inevitable conflict between energy 
allocations  is  called  the      principle  of  allocation    ,   which  we 
introduced in chapter 5 (see p. 104). 

 Optimal  foraging  theory  attempts  to  model  how  organ-
isms feed as an optimizing process, a process that maximizes 
or minimizes some quantity. In some situations, the environ-
ment may favor individuals that assimilate energy or nutrients 
at a high rate (e.g., some filter-feeding zooplankton and short-
lived weedy annual plants growing in disturbed habitats). In 
other  situations,  selection  for  minimum  water  loss  appears 
much  stronger  (e.g.,  cactus  and  scorpions  in  the  desert). 
Optimal foraging theory attempts to predict what consumers 
will eat, and when and where they will feed. Early work in 
this area concentrated on animal behavior. More recently the 
acquisition of energy and nutrients by plants has been mod-
eled, using ideas borrowed from economic theory.  

   Testing Optimal Foraging Theory 
 How  can  you  test  optimal  foraging  theory?  Unfortunately, 
you  cannot  test  this  theory,  or  any  other  complex  theory, 
directly in one grand experiment. Consequently, researchers 
chip away at the problem by testing specific predictions of the 
theory.  One  of  the  most  productive  avenues  of  research  has 
been to use optimal foraging theory to predict the composi-
tion of animal diets. 

 When ecologists consider potential prey for a consumer, 
they try to identify the prey attributes that may affect the rate of 
energy intake by the predator. One of the most important fac-
tors is the abundance of a potential food item. All things being 
equal, a more abundant prey item yields a larger energy return 
than  an  uncommon  prey.  In  optimal  foraging  studies,  prey 
abundance is generally expressed as the number of the prey 
encountered  by  the  predator  per  unit  of  time,   N   e  .  Another 
prey attribute is the amount of energy, or costs, expended by 
the predator while searching for prey,  C   s  . A third characteris-
tic of potential prey that could affect the energy return to the 
predator is the time spent processing prey in activities such as 
cracking shells, fighting, removing noxious scent glands, and 
so  forth. Time  spent  in  activities  such  as  these  are  summa-
rized as handling time,  H.  Ecologists ask, given the searching 
and handling capabilities of an animal and a certain array of 
available prey, do animals select their diet in a way that yields 
the  maximum  rate  of  energy  intake?  We  can  rephrase  this 
question mathematically by incorporating the terms for prey 
encounter rate, Ne, searching costs, Cs, and handling time,  H,  
into a model. 

  A Model for Diet Breadth 
 One  of  the  most  basic  questions  that  we  might  ask  about 
feeding by a predator concerns the number of prey items that 
should be included in its diet. Put another way, what mix of 
prey will maximize energy intake by a predator feeding under 
a particular set of circumstances? Early theoretical work on 

this question was published by MacArthur and Pianka (1966), 
Charnov (1973), and several others. We can represent the rate 
of energy intake of a predator as  E / T,  where  E  is energy and  T  
is time. Earl Werner and Gary Mittelbach (1981) modeled the 
rate of energy intake for a predator feeding on a single prey 
species as follows:   

  E __ 
    =    
T

Ne1E1 2 Cs 
__________ 
1 + Ne1H1

   

In this equation,  N   e 1  is the number of prey 1 encountered per 
unit of time.  E  1  is the net energy gained by feeding on an indi-
vidual of prey 1.  C   s   is the cost of searching for the prey.  H  1  is 
the time required for “handling” an individual of prey 1. Once 
again, this equation expresses the net rate at which a predator 
takes in energy when it feeds on a particular prey species. 

 What would be the rate of energy intake if the predator 

fed on two types of prey? That rate is calculated as:   
(Ne1E1 2 Cs) + (Ne2E2 2 Cs)
________________________  
   

  

 

1 + Ne1H1 + Ne2H2

  E __ 
    =    
T

This  is  an  extension  of  the  first  equation.  Here,  we’ve  added 
encounter rates for prey 2,  N   e 2 , the energetic return from feeding 
on prey 2,  E  2 , and the handling time for prey 2,  H  2 . The search-
ing costs, Cs, are assumed to be the same for prey 1 and prey 2. 
 The rate of energy intake by a predator feeding on several 

prey can be represented as:  

  E __ T   5   

n
  ∑ 
  
   NeiEi  2 Cs
__________ 
i 5 1
  
 
n
1 1  ∑ 
  
   NeiHi 
i 5 1

Here, ∑ means “the sum of ” and  i  equals 1, 2, 3, etc., to  n,  
where  n  is the total number of prey. Remember that this equa-
tion gives an estimate of the rate of energy intake. The ques-
tion that optimal foraging theory asks is whether organisms 
feed in a way that maximizes the rate of energy intake,  E / T.  

 Optimal foraging theory predicts that a predator will feed 

exclusively on prey 1, ignoring other available prey, when:   

Ne1E1 2 Cs 
__________ 
  
    >   
1 + Ne1H1

(Ne1E1 2 Cs) + (Ne2E2 2 Cs)
________________________  
   

  

 

1 + Ne1H1 + Ne2H2

This expression says that the rate of energy intake is greater 
if the predator feeds only on prey 1. If the predator feeds on 
both prey species, the rate will be lower. 

 Optimal  foraging  theory  predicts  that  predators  will 

include a second prey species in their diet when:   

(Ne1E1 2 Cs) + (Ne2E2 2 Cs)
________________________  
   
  
  >   

 

1 + Ne1H1 + Ne2H2

Ne1E1 2 Cs 
__________ 
1 + Ne1H1

   

In this case, feeding on two prey species gives the predator a 
higher rate of energy intake than if it feeds on one. The gen-
eral  prediction  is  that  predators  will  continue  to  add  differ-
ent types of prey to their diet until the rate of energy intake 
reaches a maximum. This is called     optimization    .  

 Now  let’s  get  back  to  our  basic  question:  Do  animals 
select food in a way that maximizes their rate of energy intake? 
Testing such a prediction requires a great deal of information. 
Fortunately, mathematical models such as this one help focus 
experiments and observations on a few key variables.

  Foraging by Bluegill Sunfish 
 Some of the most thorough tests of optimal foraging theory 
have been conducted on the bluegill sunfish,  Lepomis macro-
chirus.   The  bluegill  is  a  medium-size  fish  native  to  eastern 
and central North America, where it inhabits a wide range of 
freshwater  habitats,  from  small  streams  to  the  shorelines  of 
small and large lakes. Bluegills feed mainly on benthic and 
planktonic crustaceans and aquatic insects, prey that differ in 
size and habitat and in ease of capture and handling. Bluegills 
often  choose  prey  by  size,  feeding  on  organisms  of  certain 
sizes and ignoring others. This behavior is convenient because 
it  gives  the  ecologist  a  relatively  simple  measure,  size,  to 
describe the composition of the available prey and the compo-
sition of the theoretically optimal diet. 

 Werner and Mittelbach used published studies to estimate 
the amount of energy expended by bluegills while they search 
for ( C   s  ) and handle prey. They used laboratory experiments to 
estimate handling times ( H ) and encounter rates ( N   e  ) for vari-
ous prey. The energy content of prey was calculated by mea-
suring the lengths of prey available in lakes and ponds; prey 
length was converted to mass, and then mass was converted to 
energy content using published values. 

 The upper graph in  figure 7.25  shows the size distribution 
of potential prey for bluegills in vegetation in Lawrence Lake.

The middle graph shows the composition of the optimal diet 
as  predicted  by  the  optimal  foraging  model  just  presented. 
Finally,  the  bottom  graph  shows  the  actual  composition  of 
bluegill diets in Lawrence Lake. Bluegills feeding in vegeta-
tion selected prey that were uncommon and larger than aver-
age. The  optimal  diet  matches  well  with  the  actual  diets  of 
bluegills in Lawrence Lake. A similar match was obtained for 
bluegills feeding on zooplankton in open water. 

 Werner  and  Mittelbach  found  that  optimal  foraging 
theory  provides  reasonable  predictions  of  prey  selection  by 
natural  populations  of  bluegills.  Ecologists  studying  plants 
have developed an analogous predictive framework for forag-
ing by plants.   

  Optimal Foraging by Plants 
 How  do  plants  “forage”?  What  animals  do  with  behavior, 
plants do with growth. Plants forage by growing and orienting 
structures that capture either energy or nutrients. They grow 
leaves  or  other  green  surfaces  to  capture  light  and  roots  to 
capture nutrients. Terrestrial plants harvest energy from sun-
light aboveground and nutrients and water from soil. Because 
of  the  structure  of  their  environment  and  the  distribution  of 
their resources, plants forage in two directions at once. Like 
animals, however, plants face limited supplies of energy and 
nutrients  and  so  face  the  prospect  of  compromises  between 
competing demands for energy. Allocation of energy to leaves 
and  stems  reduces  the  amount  of  energy  available  for  root 
growth.  Increased  allocation  to  root  growth  reduces  energy 
available for leaves and stems. 

 In some environments, such as deserts, plants have access 
to an abundance of light but face shortages of water. In other 
environments, such as in the understory of temperate forests, 
there  is  little  light  but  the  soil  may  be  rich  in  moisture  and 
nutrients.  In  the  face  of  such  environmental  heterogeneity, 
how  do  plants  invest  their  energy?  Using  economic  theory, 
Arnold Bloom and his colleagues (1985) suggested that plants 
adjust their allocation of energy to growth in such a way that 
all resources are equally limited. They predicted that plants in 
environments  with  abundant  nutrients  but  little  light,  would 
invest  more  energy  in  the  growth  of  stems  and  leaves  and 
less in roots to match their supply of energy to the supply of 
nutrients. They predicted that in environments rich in light but 
poor in nutrients, plants would invest more in roots. 

 The predictions of this economically based model have 
been  supported  by  numerous  studies  showing  that  plants  in 
light-poor  environments  invest  more  aboveground,  while 
plants  from  nutrient-poor  environments  invest  more  below-
ground. So, it appears that plants allocate energy for growth 
to  those  structures  that  gather  the  resources  that  most  limit 
growth  in  a  particular  environment. These  patterns  are  con-
sistent with concepts developed by Justus Liebig in the mid-
nineteenth century (see chapter 18, p. 395). Some of the most 
revealing  tests  of  these  predictions  come  from  studies  of 
plants growing along gradients of nutrient availability. 

 Experimental  studies  show  that  the  same  plant  species 
grown in nutrient-poor soils often develop a higher ratio of root

  Investigating the Evidence  7 

 Scatter Plots and the Relationship between Variables 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 7.18 

Interpret scatter plots indicating positive, nega-
tive, or uncorrelated relationships between two 
variables.

 Ecologists  are  often  interested  in  the  relationship  between 
two variables, which we might call X and Y. For example, in 
chapter 7 we reviewed a study of how the size of pumas, vari-
able  X,  is  related  to  the  size  of  prey  that  they  take,  variable 
Y (see  fig. 7.19 ). The scatter plot shown in  figure 7.19  is one 
of  an  infinite  number  of  possible  relationships  between  two 
variables. 

 Let’s  consider  just  three  of  the  possible  relationships, 
which are shown in  figure 1 . The most basic scatter plot is one 
in which there is no relationship between X and Y. This situa-
tion is represented by  figure 1 a  , where there is no correlation 
between values of X and values of Y. As a result, the scatter plot 
forms a more or less circular pattern. In contrast the pattern 

shown  in   figure  1 b  ,  which  represents  the  situation  where  as 
X  increases,  Y  decreases,  follows  an  approximately  linear 
pattern  that  slopes  downward  to  the  right.  The   relationship 
between rainfall and green woodhoopoe reproduction we will 
examine in chapter 8 shows this pattern (see fig. 8.19). This 
type of relationship between X and Y is called a negative cor-
relation. The  opposite  pattern,  shown  by   figure  1 c  ,  is  called 
a positive correlation. When two variables are positively cor-
related, increases in X are associated with increases in Y. For 
instance, increased body size in populations of pumas are cor-

lation between some variable X and another variable Y—
for example, between higher concentrations of the stable 
isotope  13C  in the tissues of migrating redstarts and later 
arrival dates on their northern breeding grounds (see chap-
ter 1, p. 5). Does this positive correlation demonstrate that 
an increase in X directly causes an increase in Y?

when grown on nutrient-rich soils. For example, when H. Setälä 
and V. Huhta (1991) grew birch tree seedlings in boreal forest 
soils of low and high nitrogen content, those in the nitrogen -
poor soils developed higher root:shoot ratios ( fig. 7.26 ). 

 David  Tilman  and  M.  Cowan  (1989)  obtained  similar 
results when they grew four species of grass and four species 
of forbs on soils of different nitrogen content. They created a 
nitrogen gradient by mixing three different soils in different 
proportions. The soils were a subsoil (B horizon, see fig. 2.8) 
containing  approximately  25  mg  of  nitrogen  per  kilogram 
of  soil,  a  topsoil  (A  horizon)  with  350  mg  of  nitrogen  per 

kilogram of soil, and a black loam topsoil (A horizon) from a 
nearby site containing 5,000 mg of nitrogen per kilogram of 
soil. These soils were mixed to produce seven levels of soil 
nitrogen ranging from about 125 to 1,800 mg N per kilogram 
of soil. Several other nutrients were added to the experimen-
tal soils so that other nutrients would not limit growth of the 
experimental plants. 

 Tilman and Cowan conducted their growth experiments 
in 504 flowerpots that were 30 cm wide by 30 cm deep. They 
filled several pots with each of their seven soil mixtures and 
grew each of the eight study species from seed at high densi-
ties, 100 plants per pot, and low densities, 7 plants per pot. In

 In general, the study species had lower root:shoot ratios 
when grown with more nitrogen.  Figure 7.27  shows the pat-
tern  for  the  grass   Sorghastrum  nutans   when  grown  at  high 
density. Like the other species,  S. nutans  reduced its root bio-
mass and increased its shoot biomass in the presence of higher 
nitrogen availability. In a study of plants of the Great Plains 
of North America, Nichole Levang-Brilz and Mario Biondini 
found that 62% of the 55 plant species in their study increased 
root:shoot ratios in the face of reduced nitrogen availability 
(Levang-Brilz and Biondini 2002). These results indicate that 
many  plants  modify  their  anatomy  to  match  environmental 
circumstance in the direction predicted by economic theory.

  Energy and Nutrient Relations

 In summary,  ecologists, using simple models of feeding 
behavior, have successfully predicted the feeding behavior of 
organisms as different as predatory animals and plants. Many 
animals forage in a way that tends to maximize their rate of 
energy intake. Meanwhile, plants, from birch trees to temperate 
grasses and forbs, appear to allocate energy to growth in a way 
that increases the rate at which they acquire those resources in 
shortest supply. While the optimal foraging approach to trophic 
ecology is far from complete, it is a substantial improvement 
over a body of knowledge consisting of a long list of species-
specific descriptions of diet and feeding habits. 

 In the example in the Applications section, we see how 
biologists  are  using  some  of  the  patterns  and  concepts  we 
have discussed in chapter 7 to address important environmen-
tal problems. 

  Concept 7.5 Review 

1.   According to optimal foraging theory, under what con-
ditions should a predator add a new prey species to its 
diet?  

2.   Do patterns of feeding by bluegills (see  fig. 7.25 ) include 
any evidence that these consumers ignore  certain poten-
tial prey?  

     3.   Why did Tilman and Cowan plant several pots of each 

species in each of their growing conditions?

help?  Increasingly,  we  are  turning  to  nature’s  own  cleanup 
crew, the bacteria. Environmental managers are taking advan-
tage of the exceptional trophic diversity of bacteria to perform 
a host of environmental chores.

 Benzene breakdown by soil bacteria (data from 

a  serious  source  of  pollution.  Maribeth  Watwood  and  Cliff 
Dahm  (1992)  explored  the  possibility  of  using  bacteria  to 
clean up soils and aquifers contaminated by leaking storage 
tanks. The first step in their work was to determine if there 
are naturally occurring populations of bacteria that can break 
down complex petroleum derivatives such as benzene. 

 Watwood and Dahm collected sediments from a shallow 
aquifer that contained approximately 8.5  3  10 8  bacterial cells 
per gram of wet sediment. Of these, 6.55  3  10 4  bacterial cells 
per milliliter were capable of living on benzene as their only 
source of carbon and energy. By exposing sediments from the 
aquifer  to  benzene  for  6  months,  the  researchers  increased 
the populations of benzene-degrading bacteria approximately 
100 times. 

 How  rapidly  can  these  bacteria  break  down  benzene? 
Watwood and Dahm found that with no prior exposure, bacte-
rial populations could break down 90% of the benzene in their 
test flasks within 40 days ( fig. 7.28 ). Exposing sediments to 
benzene prior to their tests increased the rate of breakdown. 
 Briefly,  this  study  demonstrated  that  naturally  occur-
ring populations of bacteria can rapidly break down  benzene 
leaking from underground storage tanks. This study  suggests 
that  these  bacteria  will  eventually  clean  up  the  organic 
 contaminants  from  leaking  gasoline  storage  tanks   without 
manipulation  of  the  environment.  However,  in  the  next 
 example,  environmental  managers  found  that  they  had  to 
manipulate the environment to stimulate the desired bacterial 
cleanup of a contaminant.  

  Cyanide and Nitrates in Mine Spoils 
 Many gold mines were abandoned when they could not be 
mined  profitably  with  the  mining  technology  of  the  nine-
teenth  and  early  twentieth  centuries.  Then,  in  the  1970s, 

techniques  were  developed  to  economically  extract  gold 
from low-grade ores. One of the main extraction techniques 
was to leach ore with cyanide (CN2). Dissolved CN2 forms 
chemical  complexes  with  gold  and  other  metals. The  solu-
tion containing gold-bearing CN2 can be collected and the 
gold  and  CN2  removed  by  filtering  the  solution  with  acti-
vated charcoal. 

 This new method of mining solved a technical problem 
but contaminated soils and groundwater. When the leaching 
process is finished, the leached ore is stored in piles; however, 
much CN2 remains. Several kinds of bacteria can break down 
CN2  and  produce  NH 3 .  This  NH3    can,  in  turn,  be  used  by 
2 (see 
nitrifying bacteria as an energy source, producing NO3
“The Nitrogen Cycle” in chapter 19, p. 417). Thus, leaching 
gold-bearing ores and subsequent microbial activity can con-
taminate  soil  and  groundwater  with  CN2,  a  deadly  poison, 
and with nitrate, another contaminant. 

 Carleton  White  and  James  Markwiese  (1994)  studied 
a  gold  mine  that  had  been  worked  with  the  CN2  leaching 
process.  The  leached  ores  from  the  mine  were  gradually 
2 into the environment. The research-
releasing CN2 and NO3
ers looked to bacteria to solve this environmental problem. 
They  first  documented  the  presence  of  CN2  degraders  by 
looking  for  bacterial  growth  in  a  diagnostic  medium.  This 
medium  contained  CN2  as  the  only  source  of  carbon  and 
nitrogen. Using this growth medium, White and Markwiese 
estimated that each gram of ore contained approximately 10 3  
to 10 5  cells of organisms capable of growing on, and break-
ing down, CN2. 

 The leached ores presented bacteria with a rich source 
2 but the ores con-
of nitrogen in the form of CN2 and NO3
tained little organic carbon. White and Markwiese predicted 
that  adding  a  source  of  carbon  to  the  residual  ores  would 
increase  the  rate  at  which  bacteria  break  down  CN2  and 
2  in  the  environment. Why 
reduce  the  concentration  of  NO3
should  adding  organic  molecules  rich  in  carbon  increase 
bacterial use of nitrogen in the environment? Bacteria have 
a carbon:nitrogen ratio of about 5:1. In other words, growth 
and reproduction by bacteria require about five carbon atoms 
for each nitrogen atom. 

 White  and  Markwiese  tested  their  ideas  in  the  labora-
tory.  In  one  experiment,  they  added  enough  sucrose  to  pro-
duce a C:N ratio of 10:1 within leached ores. This experiment 
included two controls, both of which contained leached ores 
without sucrose. One of the controls was sterilized to kill any 
bacteria. The other control was left unsterilized. 

 Bacteria in the treatments containing sucrose broke down 
all  the  CN2  within  the  leached  ore  in  13  days.  Meanwhile, 
only a small amount of CN2 was broken down in the unsteril-
ized control and no CN2 was broken down in the sterilized 
control ( fig. 7.29 ). Why did the researchers include a steril-
ized  control?  The  sterilized  control  demonstrated  that  non-
biological  processes  were  not  responsible  for  the  observed 
breakdown of CN2. 

  Figure 7.29  shows that adding sucrose to the residual ore 
stimulates  the  breakdown  of  CN2.  However,  remember  that

adding sucrose to eliminate CN2 lead to the buildup of NO3
trading one pollution problem for another? No, it does not. In 
another experiment White and Markwiese showed that adding 
2 by heterotrophic bacte-
sucrose also stimulates uptake of NO3
ria and fungi. These organisms use organic molecules, in this 
2 as a 
case sucrose, as a source of energy and carbon and NO3
source of nitrogen. The nitrogen taken up by bacteria and fungi 
becomes incorporated in biomass as complex organic  molecules. 
 Nitrogen in this form is recycled within the  microbial commu-
nity and is not a source of environmental pollution. 

 White  and  Markwiese  recommended  that  sucrose  be 
added  to  leached  gold-mining  ores  to  stimulate  breakdown 
2 by bacteria. This environmental 
of CN2 and uptake of NO3
cleanup project was successful because the researchers were 
thoroughly familiar with the energy and nutrient relations of 
bacteria and fungi. Another key to the project’s success was 
the  great  trophic  diversity  of  bacteria.  Bacteria  will  likely 
continue to play a great role as we address some of our most 
vexing environmental problems.

   Summary 

  Photosynthetic  autotrophs  synthesize  organic  molecules 
using  CO 2   as  a  source  of  carbon  and  light  as  an  energy 
source.   Photosynthetic plants and algae use CO 2  as a source 
of carbon, and light, of wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm, 
as a source of energy. Light within this band, which is called 
photosynthetically  active  radiation,  or  PAR,  accounts  for 
about 45% of the total energy content of the solar spectrum 
at sea level. PAR can be quantified as photosynthetic photon 
flux density, generally reported as  m mol per square meter per 
second. Among plants, there are three major alternative pho-
tosynthetic pathways, C 3 , C 4 , and CAM. C 4  and CAM plants 
are more efficient in their use of water than are C 3  plants. 

  Chemosynthetic  autotrophs  synthesize  organic  mol-
ecules using CO 2  as a carbon source and inorganic mole-
cules as an energy source.   They consist of a highly diverse 
group  of  chemosynthetic  bacteria  and  archaea.  Prokaryotes 
are the most trophically diverse organisms in the biosphere. 

  Heterotrophic  organisms  use  organic  molecules  both 
as a source of carbon and as an energy source.   Herbivores, 
carnivores,  and  detritivores  face  fundamentally  different  tro-
phic problems. Herbivores feed on plant tissues, which often 
contain  a  great  deal  of  carbon  but  little  nitrogen.  Herbivores 
must  also  overcome  the  physical  and  chemical  defenses  of 
plants. Detritivores feed on dead plant material, which is even 
lower in nitrogen than living plant tissues. The study of the bal-
ance of multiple chemical elements in ecological interactions, 
for example, in trophic interactions, is the subject of the field 
of ecology known as ecological stoichiometry. Carnivores con-
sume prey that are nutritionally rich but very well defended. 

  The rate at which organisms can take in energy is lim-
ited,   either by external or internal constraints. The relation-
ship  between  photon  flux  density  and  plant  photosynthetic 

rate  is  called  photosynthetic  response.  Herbs  and  short-lived 
perennial shrubs from sunny habitats have high maximum pho-
tosynthetic  rates  that  level  off  at  high  irradiance. The  lowest 
maximum  rates  of  photosynthesis  occur  among  plants  from 
shady  environments.  The  relationship  between  food  density 
and animal feeding rate is called the functional response. The 
shape of the functional response is generally one of three types. 
The forms of photosynthetic response curves and type 2 animal 
functional responses are remarkably similar. Energy limitation 
is a fundamental assumption of optimal foraging theory. 

  Optimal  foraging  theory  models  feeding  behavior  as 
an  optimizing  process.   Evolutionary  ecologists  predict  that 
if  organisms  have  limited  access  to  energy,  natural  selection 
is  likely  to  favor  individuals  that  are  more  effective  at  acquir-
ing  energy  and  nutrients.  Many  animals  select  food  in  a  way 
that appears to maximize the rate at which they capture energy. 
Plants appear to allocate energy to roots versus shoots in a way 
that increases their rate of intake of the resources that limit their 
growth. Plants in environments with abundant nutrients but little 
light tend to invest more energy in the growth of stems and leaves 
and less in roots. In environments rich in light but poor in nutri-
ents, plants tend to invest more energy in the growth of roots. 

 The trophic diversity of bacteria, which is critical to the 
health of the biosphere, can also be used as a tool to address 
some of our most challenging waste disposal problems. Bac-
teria  can  be  used  to  clean  up  soils  and  aquifers  polluted  by 
petroleum  products  such  as  benzene,  and  eliminate  the  pol-
lution caused by some kinds of mine waste. The success of 
these projects requires that ecologists understand the energy 
and nutrient relations of bacteria. Bacteria will likely continue 
to play a great role as we address some of our most vexing 
environmental problems.

  Review Questions 

     1.  Why don’t plants use highly energetic ultraviolet light for pho-
tosynthesis? Would it be impossible to evolve a photosynthetic 
system  that  uses  ultraviolet  light?  Does  the  fact  that  many 
insects see ultraviolet light change your mind? Would it be pos-
sible to use infrared light for photosynthesis? (Hint: Photosyn-
thetic bacteria tap into the near infrared range.)  

    2.  In  what  kinds  of  environments  would  you  expect  to  find  the 
greatest predominance of C 3 , C 4 , or CAM plants? How can you 
explain  the  co-occurrence  of  two,  or  even  all  three,  of  these 
types of plants in one area? (Hint: Think about the variations in 
microclimate that we considered in chapters 5 and 6.)  

    3.  In chapter 7, we emphasized how the C 4  photosynthetic path-
way saves water, but some researchers suggest that the greatest 
advantage  of  C 4   over  C 3   plants  occurs  when  CO 2   concentra-
tions are low. What is the advantage of the C 4  pathway when 
CO 2  concentrations are low? As we shall see in chapter 23, the 
atmospheric concentration of CO 2  has been increasing for the 
last century or so. If this trend continues, and if the interactions 
between C 4  and C 3  plants are influenced by atmospheric CO 2  
concentrations,  how  might  the  geographic  distributions  of  C 3  
and C 4  plants change?  

    4.  What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of being an 
herbivore, a detritivore, or a carnivore? What kinds of organisms 
were  left  out  of  our  discussions  of  herbivores,  detritivores,  and 
carnivores? Where do parasites fit? Where does  Homo sapiens  fit?  
    5.  What  advantage  does  advertising  give  to  noxious  prey?  How 
would convergence in aposematic coloration among several spe-
cies of Müllerian mimics contribute to the fitness of  individuals  
in each species? In the case of Batesian mimicry, what are the 
costs and benefits of mimicry to the model and to the mimic?  

    6.  Design a planetary ecosystem based entirely on chemosynthe-
sis. You might choose an undiscovered planet of some distant 
star or one of the planets in our own solar system, either today 
or at some distant time in the past or future.  

    7.  What  kinds  of  animals  would  you  expect  to  have  type  1,  2,  or 
3 functional responses? How should natural selection for better 
prey defense affect the height of functional response curves? How 

should  natural  selection  for  more  effective  predators  affect  the 
height of the curves? What net effect should natural selection on 
predator and prey populations have on the height of the curves?  

    8.  The rivers of central Portugal have been invaded, and densely 
populated by the Louisiana crayfish  Procambarus clarki,  which 
looks  like  a  freshwater  lobster  about  12  to  14  cm  long.  The 
otters of these rivers, which were studied by Graça and Ferrand 
de Almeida (1983), can easily catch and subdue these crayfish.

  explain  why  the  diets  of  the  otters  of  central  Portugal  would 
shift from the highly diverse menu shown in  figure 7.17 , which 
included fish, frogs, water snakes, birds, and insects, to a diet 
dominated by crayfish. For the crayfish, assume low handling 
time, very high encounter rates, and high energy content.  

    9.  The data of Iriarte and colleagues (1990) suggest that prey size 
may favor a particular body size among pumas (see  fig. 7.19 ). 
However, this variation in body size also correlates well with 
latitude; the larger pumas live at high latitudes. Consequently, 
this variation in body size has been interpreted as the result of 
selection  for  efficient  temperature  regulation.  Homeothermic 
animals are often larger at high latitudes, a pattern called Berg-
mann’s  rule.  Larger  animals,  with  lower  surface  area  relative 
to their mass, would be theoretically better at conserving heat. 
Smaller animals, with higher surface area relative to their mass, 
would  be  theoretically  better  at  keeping  cool.  So  what  deter-
mines  predator  size?  Is  predator  size  determined  by  climate, 
predator-prey interactions, or both? Design a study of the influ-
ence of the environment on the size of homeothermic predators.  
   10.  How is plant allocation to roots versus shoots similar to plant 
regulation of temperature and water? (We discussed these topics 
in chapters 5 and 6.) Consider discussing these processes under 
the more general heading of homeostasis. (Hint: Homeostasis is 
the maintenance of a relatively constant internal environment.)

  Adaptations to the Environment

all day begins to move steadily toward an opening in the reef. 
The school is leaving the lagoon’s protection and going out to 
the open ocean for a night of feeding. Living in a school appears 
to  have  favored  uniformity  among  its  members. Approached 
underwater, the edge of the school looks like a giant, translu-
cent curtain stamped with the silhouettes of thousands of identi-
cal fish. Their coloration, countershaded dark above and silvery 
below, their similar size, highly coordinated movements, and 
great numbers give the fish within the school some protection 
from predators. Though seabirds and predaceous fish ambush 
the school as it makes its way, the schooling fish are so numer-
ous  and  their  individual  movements  so  difficult  to  follow 
that only a small proportion of them are eaten. Gradually the 
school, moving like a gigantic, shape-shifting organism, passes 
through the channel connecting the lagoon to the open ocean. 
The school of fish will be back by daybreak only to repeat its 
seaward journey next evening in a cycle of comings and goings 
that helps mark the rhythm of life on the reef. 

 Meanwhile, along the reef, damselfish are distributed sin-
gly on territories. The damselfish retain exclusive possession of 
their territorial patches of coral rubble, living coral, and sand by 
patrolling the boundaries and driving off any fish attempting to 
intrude, especially other damselfish that would take their territory 
or other fish that would prey on eggs or consume food within the 
territory. Each day at this time, however, some territory-holding 
males are joined by females. For the space of time that they court 
and  deposit  eggs  and  sperm  on  the  nest  site  prepared  by  the 
male, the territory contains two fish. Once mating is complete, 
however, the male is again alone on the territory, guarding the 
food and shelter contained within its boundaries as well as the 
newly deposited eggs that he fertilized minutes before. 

 Higher along the reef face a male bluehead wrasse mates 
with  a  member  of  the  harem  of  females  that  live  within  his 
territory ( fig. 8.1 ). In contrast to the male with his blue head, 
black bars, and green body, the female is mostly yellow with 
a  large,  black  spot  on  her  dorsal  fin. As  the  male  bluehead 
extrudes sperm to fertilize the eggs laid by the female, small 
males, similar in color to the female, streak by the mating pair, 
discharging a cloud of sperm as they do. Some of the female’s 
eggs will be fertilized by the large territorial bluehead male, 

 Figure 8.1   Bluehead wrasse males with yellow females of the  species. 
If the bluehead male is removed from a territory, the largest female in the 
territory can change to a fully functional bluehead male within days.

while others will be fertilized by the sperm discharged by the 
smaller  yellow  streakers.  In  addition  to  differences  in  color 
and courtship behavior, bluehead and yellow males have dis-
tinctive histories. While the yellow males began their lives as 
males, the bluehead male began life as a female and only trans-
formed to a male when the local bluehead male was eaten by a 
predator or met some other end. At that point, because she was 
the largest yellow phase among the local females and males, 
she  was  in  line  to  become  the  dominant  local  male  and  so 
changed from the yellow to the bluehead form of the species. 
Within  a  week  the  former  female  was  producing  sperm  and 
fertilizing the eggs produced by the females in the territory.     

 While male bluehead wrasses patrol their individual mat-
ing territories and male damselfish fight with each other at the 
boundaries  of  theirs,  elsewhere  on  the  reef  groups  of  snap-
ping  shrimp  live  cooperatively  in  colonies  that  may  contain 
over 300 individuals. Most of the individuals in the colonies 
are juveniles or males along with a single reproductive female. 
The  female  snapping  shrimp,  which  plays  a  role  much  like 
the  queen  ant  in  an  ant  colony,  breeds  continuously  and  so 
is easily identified by her ripe ovaries or by the eggs she car-
ries. Meanwhile, the males of the colony, most of which will 
probably never mate, vigorously defend the nest site, with its 
“queen” shrimp and numerous juveniles, against intruders. In 
this shrimp society most males serve the colony and its queen 
by  protecting  her  offspring  and  the  sponge  where  they  live. 
While the queen reproduces profusely, the chance to reproduce 
is probably rare for an individual male. The colony thrives but 
reproduction is restricted to a few individuals in the population. 
 The study of social relations is the territory of       behavioral 
ecology    ,  which concentrates on relationships between organ-
isms and environment that are mediated by behavior. In the 
case  of  social  relations,  other  individuals  of  a  species  are 
the  part  of  the  environment  of  particular  interest. A  branch 
of  biology  concerned  with  the  study  of  social  relations  is 
     sociobiology    .  Social relations, from dominance relationships 
and  reproductive  interactions  to  cooperative  behaviors,  are 
important,  since  they  often  directly  impact  the  reproductive 
contribution of individuals to future generations, a key com-
ponent  of  Darwinian  or  evolutionary  fitness.   Fitness,   which 
can be defined as the number of offspring, or genes, contrib-
uted by an individual to future generations, can be substan-
tially influenced by social relations within a population. 

 One of the most fundamental social interactions between 
individuals takes place during sexual reproduction. The timing 
of those interactions and their nature are strongly influenced by 
the reproductive system of a species. The behavioral  ecologist 
considers several factors. Does the population engage in sex-
ual reproduction? Are the sexes separate? How are the sexes 
distributed  among  individuals?  Are  there  several  forms  of 
one sex or the other? Questions such as these have drawn the 
attention of biologists since Darwin (1862), who wrote, “We 
do not even in the least know the final cause of sexuality; why 
new beings should be produced by the union of the two sexual 
elements, instead of by a process of  parthenogenesis [produc-
tion of offspring from unfertilized eggs] . . . The whole sub-
ject is as yet hidden in darkness.” As you will see, behavioral 
and  evolutionary  ecologists  have  learned  a  great  deal  about

the evolution and ecology of reproduction in the nearly one 
and  a  half  centuries  since  Darwin  published  this  statement. 
However, much remains to be discovered. 

 Since  mammals  and  birds  reproduce  sexually,  from  a 
human perspective sexual reproduction may appear the norm. 
However,  asexual  reproduction  is  common  among  many 
groups  of  organisms  such  as  bacteria,  protozoans,  plants, 
and  some  vertebrates.  However,  most  described  species  of 
plants and animals include male and female functions, some-
times in separate individuals or within the same individual. 
This  brings  us  to  a  fundamental  question  in  biology. What 
is female and what is male? From a biological perspective, 
the answer is simple.     Females    produce larger, more energeti-
cally costly gametes (eggs or ova), whereas     males    produce 
smaller,  less-costly  gametes  (sperm  or  pollen).  Because  of 
the greater energetic cost of producing their gametes, female 
reproduction is thought to be generally limited by access to 
the  necessary  resources.  In  contrast,  male  reproduction  is 
generally limited by access to female mates. Biologists long 
ago  proposed  that  this  difference  in  investment  in  gametes 
has usually led to a fundamental dichotomy between actively 
courting males and highly selective females. 

 Despite the basic differences between males and females, 
distinguishing the two sexes in nature is sometimes difficult. 
While it is easy to distinguish between males and females in 
species where males and females differ substantially in exter-
nal morphology, the males and females of other species appear 
very  similar  and  are  very  difficult  to  distinguish  using  only 
external  anatomy.  Still  other  species  are       hermaphrodites    ,
organisms that combine male and female function in the same 
individual ( fig. 8.2 ). The most familiar examples of hermaph-
rodites are plants, among which the vast majority of species 
produce flowers that have both male and female parts.     

 Clearly, the way populations are divided between the sexes 
will influence social relations, which will in turn affect the fit-
ness  of  individuals,  particularly  through  influences  on  their 
reproductive rates. Studies of social relations provide numer-
ous  examples  of  the  complex  relationships  between  social 
interactions, such as how individuals choose mates, and fitness.

 8.7  Discuss the roles of mate choice and predation in 

determining colorfulness of male guppies.

The effects of female mate choice on the evolution of orna-
mentation  in  males  can  be  reduced  by  other  sources  of 
natural  selection.   Darwin  (1871)  proposed  that  the  social 
environment, particularly the mating environment, could exert

significant influence on the characteristics of organisms. He was 
particularly intrigued by the existence of what he called “sec-
ondary sexual characteristics,” the origins of which he could not 
explain except by the advantages they gave to individuals during 
competition for mates. Darwin used the term  secondary sexual 
characteristics  to mean characteristics of males or females not 
directly  involved  in  the  process  of  reproduction.  Some  of  the 
traits that Darwin had in mind were “gaudy colors and various 
ornaments . . . the power of song and other such characters.” 
How do we explain the existence of characteristics such as the 
antlers of male deer, the bright peacock’s tail, or the gigantic 
size and large nose of the male elephant seal? In order to explain 
the existence of such secondary sexual characteristics, Darwin 
proposed a process that he called     sexual selection    .  Sexual selec-
tion results from differences in reproductive rates among indi-
viduals as a result of differences in their mating success. 

 Sexual selection is thought to be important under two cir-
cumstances. The first is where individuals of one sex compete 
among themselves for mates, which results in a process called 
    intrasexual  selection    .   For  instance,  when  male  mountain 

176 

Section II 

  Adaptations to the Environment

sheep  or  elephant  seals  fight  among  themselves  for  domi-
nance or mating territories, the largest and strongest generally 
win such contests. In such situations the result is often selec-
tion for larger body size and more effective weapons such as 
horns  or  teeth.  Since  this  selection  is  the  result  of  contests 
within one sex, it is called intrasexual selection. 

 Sexual  selection  can  also  occur  when  members  of  one 
sex  consistently  choose  mates  from  among  members  of  the 
opposite sex on the basis of some particular trait. Because two 
sexes are involved, this form is called     intersexual selection    .  
Examples of traits used for mate selection include female birds 
choosing among potential male mates based on the brightness 
of their feather colors or on the quality of their songs. Dar-
win proposed that once individuals of one sex begin to choose 
mates on the basis of some anatomical or behavioral trait, sex-
ual selection would favor elaboration of the trait. For instance, 
the plumage of male birds’ color might become brighter over 
time or their songs more elaborate, or both ( fig. 8.3 ).     

 However, how much can sexual selection elaborate a trait 
before males in the population begin to suffer higher mortality 
due  to  other  sources  of  natural  selection?  Darwin  proposed 
that  sexual  selection  will  continue  to  elaborate  a  trait  until 
balanced  by  other  sources  of  natural  selection,  such  as  pre-
dation.  Since  Darwin’s  early  work  on  the  subject,  research 
has revealed a great deal about how organisms choose mates 
and the basis of sexual selection. An excellent model for such 
studies is the guppy,  Poecilia reticulata.   

   Mate Choice and Sexual 
Selection in Guppies 
 It  would  be  difficult  for  experimental  ecologists  interested  in 
mate choice and sexual selection to design a better experimen-
tal animal than the guppy ( fig. 8.4 ). Guppies are native to the 
streams and rivers of Trinidad and Tobago, islands in the south-
eastern Caribbean, and in the rivers draining nearby parts of the 
South  American  mainland.  The  waters  inhabited  by  guppies 

range  from  small,  clear  mountain  streams  to  murky,  lowland 
rivers. Along this gradient of physical conditions, guppies also 
encounter  a  broad  range  of  biological  situations.  In  the  head-
waters of streams above waterfalls, guppies live in the absence of 
predaceous fish or with the killifish  Rivulus hartii,  which preys 
mainly on juveniles and is not a very effective predator on adult 
guppies. In contrast, guppies in lowland rivers live with a wide 
variety of predaceous fish, including the pike cichlid,  Crenicichla 
alta,  a very effective visual predator of adult guppies.   

 Male guppies show a broad range of coloration both within 
and among populations. What factors may produce this range 
of variation? It turns out that female guppies, if given a choice, 
will mate with more brightly colored and behaviorally dominant 
males (Kodric-Brown 1993, Houde 1997). Why would a female 
guppy  prefer  to  mate  with  such  males?  The  characteristics 
associated with male mating success among guppies, brighter 
coloration  and  behavioral  dominance,  are  a  combination  of a 
male’s anatomy and a reflection of his health and nutritional state. 
A  female  choosing  to  mate  with  such  males  may  increase  her 
chances of producing offspring with a more robust immune system 
and better at finding food and at competing with other members 
of  the  population.  In  addition,  since  we  also  know  that  color-
ation in guppies has a strong genetic basis, the sons of females 
mating with colorful males would be more likely to be colorful 
themselves and, therefore, attractive to females. In other words, a 
female guppy choosing to mate with colorful, socially dominant 
males would be likely to produce offspring with higher fitness. 

However, brightly colored males are attacked more fre-
quently  by  visual  predators.  This  trade-off  between  higher 
mating  success  by  bright  males  but  greater  vulnerability  to 
predators provides a mechanistic explanation for variation in 
male coloration among different habitats. The most brightly 
colored male guppies are found in populations exposed to few 
predators, while those exposed to predators, such as the pike 
cichlid, are much less brightly colored (Endler 1995). Thus, 
the  coloration  of  male  guppies  in  local  populations  may  be 
determined by a dynamic interplay between natural selection 
exerted by predators and by female mate choice. 

 While  field  observations  are  consistent  with  a  trade-
off between sexual selection due to mate choice and natural 

 Figure 8.3   A peacock in full courtship display. Colorful male birds 
of many different species, such as this peacock, are testimony to the 
potential of sexual selection by females, choosing mates from among 
available males, to produce elaborate ornamentation.

selection due to predation, the evidence would be more con-
vincing  with  an  experimental  test.  John  Endler  (1980)  per-
formed such a test in an exemplary study of natural selection 
for color pattern in guppies. 

  Experimental Tests 
 Endler  performed  two  experiments,  one  in  artificial  ponds  in 
a  greenhouse  at  Princeton  University  ( fig.  8.5 )  and  one  in  the 
field.  For  the  greenhouse  experiments,  Endler  constructed 
10  ponds  designed  to  approximate  pools  in  the  streams  of 
the  Northern  Range  in Trinidad.  Four  of  the  ponds  were  of  a 
size (2.4 m  3  1.2 m  3  40 cm) typical of the pools inhabited 
by  a  single  pike  cichlid  in  smaller  streams.  During  the  final 
phase of the experiment, Endler placed a single pike cichlid in 
each of these ponds. The six other ponds were similar in size 
(2.4 m  3  1.2 m  3  15 cm) to stream pools in the headwaters, 
which  contain  approximately  six   Rivulus.   Endler  eventually 
placed six  Rivulus  in four of these ponds and maintained the other 
two ponds with no predators as controls. What did Endler create 
with this series of pools and predator combinations? These three 
groups of ponds represented three levels of predation: high pre-
dation (pike cichlid), low predation ( Rivulus ), and no predation.     
 However,  before  introducing  predators,  Endler  estab-
lished similar physical environments in the pools and stocked 
them with carefully chosen guppies. He lined all ponds with 
commercially  available  dyed  gravel,  taking  care  to  put  the 

same proportions of gravel colors in each of the ponds. The 
gravel he used in all ponds was 31.4% black, 34.2% white, 
25.7% green, plus 2.9% each of blue, red, and yellow. 

 Endler stocked each experimental pond with 200 guppies 
that were descended from 18 different populations in Trinidad 
and Venezuela.  By  drawing  guppies  from  so  many  popula-
tions, Endler ensured that the experimental populations would 
include a substantial amount of color variation. As we saw in 
chapter 4 (see p. 80), genetic variation is an essential require-
ment for evolutionary change in populations. 

 Endler’s  second  experiment  was  conducted  in  the  field 
within the drainage network of the Aripo River ( fig 8.6 ), where 
he encountered three distinctive situations within a few kilome-
ters. Within the mainstream of the Aripo River, guppies coex-
isted with a wide variety of predators, including pike cichlids, 
which  provided  a  “high  predation”  site.  Upstream  from  the 
high predation site, Endler discovered a small tributary, which 
flowed  over  a  series  of  waterfalls  near  its  junction  with  the 
mainstream.  Because  the  waterfalls  prevented  most  fish  from 
swimming upstream, this tributary was entirely free of guppies 
but supported a population of the relatively ineffective preda-
tor   Rivulus.   This  potential  “low  predation”  site  provided  an 
ideal  situation  for  following  the  evolution  of  male  color. The 
third site, which was a bit farther upstream, was a small tribu-
tary that supported guppies along with  Rivulus.  This third site 
gave Endler a low predation reference site for his study. Endler

captured 200 guppies in the high predation environment, mea-
sured the coloration of these guppies, and then introduced them 
to the site lacking guppies. Six months later the introduced gup-
pies and their offspring had spread throughout the previously 
guppy-free tributary. Finally, 2 years, or about 15 guppy gen-
erations after the introduction, Endler returned and sampled the 
guppies at all three study sites.     

 The results of the greenhouse and field experiments sup-
ported each other. As shown in  figure 8.7 , the number of col-
ored spots on male guppies increased in the greenhouse ponds 
with no predators and with  Rivulus  but decreased in the high 
predation ponds containing pike cichlids.   Figure 8.8 , which 
summarizes  the  results  of  Endler’s  field  experiment,  com-
pares  the  number  of  spots  on  males  in  high  predation  and 
low predation stream environments with guppies transferred 

from the high predation environment to a low predation envi-
ronment. Notice that the transplanted population converged 
with the males at the low predation reference site during the 
experiment. In other words, when freed from predation, the 
average number of spots on male guppies in the population 
increased  substantially.  This  result,  along  with  the  results 
of the greenhouse experiment, supports the hypothesis that 
predation  reduces  male  showiness  in  guppy  populations 
and  thereby  moderates  the  effects  of  intersexual  selection, 
through female mate choice, on male ornamentation.       

The  main  characteristics  influencing  female  mate 
choice that Endler studied, color and numbers of spots, are 
anatomical. Let’s look now at a mating system where male 
attractiveness  is  dependent  upon  complex  behaviors  that 
provide females with an important resource: food.

Provisioning 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 8.8  Describe the mating biology of scorpionflies in the 

genus Panorpa.

 8.9  Assess the evidence supporting the influence of intra-
sexual selection in mating success by male Panorpa.
 8.10  Discuss the role of intersexual selection in the mat-

ing biology of Panorpa.

   Females of some species select mates based on the male’s 
ability to provide important resources.   Such behavior has 
been observed in a group of insects called scorpionflies. Scor-
pionflies ( fig. 8.9 ) belong to the order Mecoptera, a group of 
insects most closely related to the caddisflies (order Trichop-
tera)  and  the  moths  and  butterflies  (order  Lepidoptera).  The 
common name “scorpionfly” is related to the way that males 
hold their genitalia over the back of their abdomens in a posi-
tion that suggests a scorpion’s sting. Despite their appearance, 
male scorpionflies are entirely harmless to people. Compared 
to  insects  such  as  moths  or  beetles,  there  are  relatively  few 
scorpionfly species alive today. However, they have been a rich 
source  of  information  on  behavioral  ecology,  particularly  on 
the evolution and ecology of mating systems. Randy Thornhill 
has been a central figure in research on mate choice and sexual 
selection  and  his  studies  of  scorpionfly  mating  systems  are 
regarded as classic studies of the evolution and ecology of mat-
ing systems (e.g., Thornhill 1981; Thornhill and Alcock 1983).     
 Adult  scorpionflies  in  the  genus   Panorpa   feed  on  dead 
arthropods in the shrub and herb understory of forests. Several 
lines  of  evidence  suggest  that  the  supply  of  dead  arthropods 
available  to  scorpionflies  is  limited  and  that  the  intensity  of 
competition for dead arthropods is intense, especially among 
males.  Thornhill  observed  that  male  scorpionflies  fight  over 

 Figure 8.9   Male scorpionflies such as this one compete vigorously 
with each other for female scorpionflies.

180 

Section II 

  Adaptations to the Environment

dead  arthropods  and  even  steal  them  from  spider  webs,  a 
behavior that leads to significant scorpionfly mortality. Why do 
scorpionflies compete so vigorously and risk death over dead 
arthropods?  One  reason  they  fight  is  that  male   Panorpa   use 
dead arthropods to attract females. If a male finds a dead arthro-
pod and can successfully defend it from other males, he will 
stand next to the arthropod and secrete a pheromone, which can 
attract  females  from  several  meters  away. A  female  attracted 
by the pheromone will usually feed on the arthropod while the 
male mates with her. However, if an arthropod is not available 
as a nuptial offering, males will secrete a mass of saliva from 
their enlarged salivary glands and use that to attract females. 
Finally, males without gifts may attempt forced copulations. 

 In  a  series  of  experimental  studies,  Thornhill  explored 
the details of alternative male mating strategies and the eco-
logical  conditions  associated  with  each.  In  one  study,  he 
asked whether there is a difference in mating success among 
males using different mating strategies. Thornhill created an 
enclosed environment where he could control the availability 
of dead arthropods and the number of male  Panorpa  compet-
ing for them. He set up 12 replicate environments in 10- gallon 
terrariums.  He  included  six  dead  crickets—two  large,  two 
medium, and two small—in each terrarium and added 12 male 
 P.  latipennis   to  each.  Male  aggression  over  crickets,  which 
began  soon  after  they  were  introduced,  was  finished  after 
about 3 hours. At that time each of the crickets had been won 
by a single male, which stood near their respective prizes and 
secreted pheromone. The majority of the remaining six males 
secreted a mass of saliva, which they guarded, while secreting 
pheromones. Finally, some males had no nuptial offerings. 

 Once the competition among male  Panorpa  for posses-
sion of the dead crickets had been decided, Thornhill intro-
duced 12 females and recorded mating activity once per hour 
for  3  hours. Across  the  12  terrariums,  there  were  144  male 
 Panorpa  and 144 females. Of the males, 72 males took pos-
session  of  crickets,  45  had  secreted  salivary  masses,  and 
27  had  no  nuptial  offerings.  How  did  mating  success  differ 
among these groups of males?  Figure 8.10  shows that males 
with a medium or large cricket as a nuptial offering had a clear 
advantage over those that offered females a small cricket, a 
salivary mass, or no nuptial offering.   

 What benefit do females gain by mating with males that 
offer  larger  arthropods?  One  of  the  clearest  benefits  is  that 
females  feeding  on  the  arthropods  offered  by  males  do  not 
have to forage for their own and avoid the risk of being eaten 
by  a  spider  or  other  predator  as  they  fly  through  the  forest 
understory. In addition, feeding on these larger nuptial offer-
ings gives females a reproductive advantage. Thornhill docu-
mented that rate of egg laying is higher among females mating 
with males that provide arthropod prey compared to females 
that mate with males offering saliva only. Meanwhile females 
mated to males with no offering lay very few eggs. What pro-
duces this contrast among females mated to males with differ-
ent nuptial gifts? Thornhill’s results likely reflect the greater 
nutritional benefit of arthropod prey versus saliva and the lack 
of a nutritional contribution by males without gifts. 

 Next,  Thornhill  asked  what  factors  determine  whether 
males compete successfully for arthropod offerings or resort

Influence of alternative nuptial offerings on 

to the alternatives of salivary masses or no nuptial gifts? One 
of  the  most  basic  questions  that  one  could  ask  is  whether 
males are fixed in particular behaviors. That is, if males that 
have  not  competed  successfully  for  possession  of  a  dead 
arthropod are given access to one, will they take possession 
of it and advertise their possession by secreting pheromone? 
Thornhill addressed this question with a series of controlled 
experiments with enclosures. Again, he placed six crickets, all 
medium, in each of 12 terrariums and added 12 male  Panorpa  
to each. As in previous experiments, 6 males took possession 
of the dead crickets in each terrarium, leaving 6 males without 
arthropods.  Again,  the  males  without  arthropods  secreted  a 
salivary mass, which they stood beside as they secreted phero-
mone. At this point, Thornhill removed all the males possess-
ing crickets in all the terrariums. Within half an hour, almost 
all the remaining males moved from their salivary masses to 
the  available  crickets  and  secreted  pheromone  ( fig.  8.11 ).  It 
therefore  appears  that  given  the  opportunity,  male   Panorpa  
will take possession of and guard dead arthropods.     

 What  factors  determine  whether  male   Panorpa   will  be 
able to successfully claim a dead arthropod in a competitive 
environment?  Males  contesting  over  a  dead  arthropod  will 
usually  first  display  to  each  other.  However,  visual  displays 
often  quickly  escalate  to  head  butting  and  lashing  at  each 
other with the scorpion-like genital bulb and with its pair of 
sharp claspers. The claspers of male scorpionflies are capa-
ble of tearing wings or other body parts of an opponent. As 
a  consequence,  these  battles  over  bugs  can  be  dangerous  to 
both opponents. Because male body size varies widely within 
populations and male aggression over dead arthropods often

involves direct combat, Thornhill predicted that larger males 
would be most successful as competitors over arthropods. 

 Thornhill  tested  the  relationship  between  male  size  and 
ability to compete for and retain possession of arthropod prey 
in another experiment. This time he conducted his  experiment 
in 14 larger, 3' 3 3' 3 3' screen enclosures set out on the forest 
floor of his study area. Because the enclosures had no bottom 
panel, they just enclosed a 9 square foot area of the herbaceous 
vegetation growing on the forest floor. In effect they enclosed 
a bit of scorpionfly habitat.  Thornhill placed four crickets in 
seven  of  the  enclosures  and  two  in  the  other  seven.  He  then 
added  10  female  and  10  male  scorpionflies  to  each  of  the 
enclosures,  which  were  similar  to  natural  population  densi-
ties. The males in each enclosure consisted of three large males 
(55–64 mg), four medium males (42–53 mg), and three small 
males (33–41 mg). Because scorpionflies are nocturnal, Thorn-
hill  monitored  the  scorpionflies  from  sunset  to  sunrise  with 
night vision equipment. Observations continued every night for 
a week during which Thornhill periodically added fresh dead 
crickets and replaced any female or male scorpionflies that died 
with new individuals to keep population densities constant. 

 The  results  of  the  field  experiment  clearly  support  the 
hypothesis that during competition for dead arthropods, larger 
males have an advantage over small males.  Figure 8.12  com-
pares the nuptial offerings of small, medium, and large males

competed successfully for a cricket. In contrast, large males 
generally  offered  females  a  cricket  and  only  occasionally 
offered saliva or had no nuptial offering.   

 Thornhill’s study revealed the mechanism underlying vari-
ation among males in their ability to compete for nuptial offer-
ings. Larger males are more likely to successfully defend the 
available arthropod offerings due to their advantages in aggres-
sive encounters. Now, does this difference in offerings trans-
late into different mating success among males? The answer 
is given in  figure 8.13 , which shows the percentage of matings 
observed by Thornhill in cages with two crickets. Large males 
were involved in 60% of the matings observed, compared to 
27% for medium males and 13% for small males. Clearly, the 
ability of large males to defend higher-quality nuptial offerings 
translates directly into higher mating success.     

 Why would female scorpionflies mate preferentially with 
males  that  provide  them  with  food? As  we  saw  previously, 
Thornhill  found  that  larger  and  higher-quality  food  offer-
ings by males translate directly into higher egg production by 
females. In addition, there are likely other benefits to females 
choosing such males. The ability to provide food in an envi-
ronment where potential food items are in scarce supply and 
competition  for  them  is  intense  certainly  reflects  a  male’s 
competitive ability. To the extent that those competitive traits 
are heritable, they have the potential to increase the fitness of 
a female’s offspring. 

 Let us now consider plants. Though we know much less 
about the mating behavior of plants, it appears that their repro-
ductive  ecology  also  includes  the  potential  for  mate  choice 
and sexual selection. One of the best studied mating systems 
in plants is that of the wild radish,  Raphanus sativus.

ings presented by males?

selection on male scorpionfly mating success?    

8.3   Nonrandom Mating 
in a Plant Population

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 8.11  Describe the mating system of wild radish.
 8.12  Explain the evidence indicating nonrandom mating 

among wild radish plants.

Mating in wild plant populations can be nonrandom.   One 
of the best-studied mating systems in plants is that of the wild 
radish,  Raphanus sativus.  Wild radish grows as an annual weed in 
California where it can be commonly seen along roadways and in 
abandoned fields ( fig. 8.14 ). The seeds of wild radish germinate 
in response to the first winter rains of California’s Mediterranean 
climate (see fig. 2.22) and the plants flower by January. Flower-
ing may continue to late spring or early summer, depending on 
the length of the wet season. During their flowering season, wild 
radishes  are  pollinated  by  a  wide  variety  of  insects,  including 
honeybees, hoverflies (see fig. 7.15), and butterflies. The insects 
that pollinate wild radish generally arrive at flowers carrying pol-
len from several different plants, and as a consequence a wild 
radish plant typically has about seven mates. Wild radish flowers 
have both male  (    stamens   ) and female (    pistils   ) parts and produce 
both pollen and ovules. However, a wild radish plant cannot pol-
linate  itself,  a  condition  called      self-incompatibility    .   Because 
they must mate with other plants, a researcher working on wild 
radish can more easily control matings between plants.     

 One  such  researcher,  Diane  Marshall,  has  explored  the 
question of whether siring of offspring in wild radish is a ran-
dom process. In other words, do the seven mates of a typical 
wild radish plant have an equal probability of fertilizing the 
available ovules? The alternative, nonrandom mating, would 
suggest  the  potential  for  mate  choice  and  sexual  selection. 
What mechanisms might produce nonrandom mating among 
wild radish? Nonrandom mating could result from maternal 
control over the fertilization process, competition among pol-
len, or a combination of the two processes. If it does occur in 
plants,  nonrandom  mating  establishes  the  conditions  neces-
sary for sexual selection in plants. However, as Marshall and 
Michael Folsom (1991) pointed out, although sexual selection 
is well documented in animals, its occurrence among plants 
remains a controversial and open question. 

 While the existence of sexual selection in plants remains 
controversial, nonrandom mating is well documented. Marshall

 Figure 8.15   Evidence for unequal mating success among wild radish 
pollen donors in a greenhouse environment (data from Marshall 1990).

She  estimated  pollen  donor  performance  in  three  ways: 
(1) number of seeds sired in mixed pollinations, (2) positions 
of seeds sired, and (3) weight of seeds sired. The results of 
this analysis, which are shown in  figure 8.15 , indicate clearly 
that pollen donors vary widely in their performance. In other 
words, mating in this experiment was nonrandom.     

 Because Marshall conducted her 1990 study under green-
house conditions, we might ask whether nonrandom mating also 
occurs under field conditions. In other words, could the nonran-
dom mating she documented have been an artifact of greenhouse 
conditions? Marshall and Ollar Fuller (Marshall and Fuller 1994) 

 Figure 8.14   The wild radish,  Raphanus sativus,  has become a 
model for studying the mating behavior of plants.

and her colleagues have repeatedly demonstrated nonrandom 
mating  in  wild  radish.  For  instance,  Marshall  (1990)  carried 
out  greenhouse  experiments  that  showed  nonrandom  mating 
among  three  maternal  plants  and  six  pollen  donors.  In  this 
experiment,  Marshall  mated  three  seed  parents  or  maternal 
plants  with  six  pollen  donors,  the  plants  that  would  act  as 
sources of pollen to pollinate the flowers of the seed plants. 

 Marshall  used  the  6  pollen  donors  to  make  63  kinds  of 
crosses,  6  single  donor  crosses  plus  57  mixed  donor  crosses, 
on each maternal plant. Her crosses included all possible mix-
tures of pollen from 1 to 6 donors. Plants were pollinated in the 
greenhouse by hand. All pollinations were performed on freshly 
opened flowers in the morning when the temperature was cool 
enough  for  researchers  to  work  comfortably.  Pollen  was  col-
lected by tapping flowers lightly on the bottom of small petri 
dishes from an equal number of flowers of each pollen donor. 
Pollen was then mixed and applied to the stigmas of flowers on 
the  maternal  plant  using  forceps  wrapped  in  tissue.  Sufficient 
pollen was applied to cover each stigma. Because each cross was 
replicated from 2 to 20 times depending on the type of cross, the 
total number of pollinations performed on each plant was 300. 

 One of the ways that Marshall assessed the possibility of 
nonrandom mating was through performance of pollen donors. 

184 

Section II 

  Adaptations to the Environment

designed a study to address this question. Why might nonran-
dom mating be limited to the greenhouse environment? Marshall 
and Fuller point out that the harsh and variable environments to 
which plants are exposed in nature might mean that the condi-
tion of the maternal plant may be of overwhelming importance 
in determining the amount of seed produced, the weight of seeds, 
and  so  forth.  Under  such  conditions,  nonrandom   pollination, 
which  produces  differences  in  seed  weight  in  the  greenhouse, 
might be undetectable and biologically insignificant. 

 Marshall and Fuller chose four maternal plants and grew 
their offspring in a field setting. Three other maternal lineages, 
(A, B, and C) were chosen to act as pollen donors. In the field, 
the maternal plants were covered with fine mesh nylon bags 
until  the  experimental  pollinations  were  completed.  Using 
the forceps and tissue method described earlier, Marshall and 
Fuller  performed  several  kinds  of  hand-pollinations,  includ-
ing  mixed  pollinations  using  pollen  from  all  three  pollen 
donors. Once the hand-pollinations were completed the nylon 
mesh bags were removed from the flowers. 

 The  result  of  this  experiment  provided  clear  support  for 
nonrandom mating in the field population.  Figure 8.16  shows 
that during the mixed pollen donor pollinations, pollen donor 
C1 (56.5%) sired a much greater proportion of seeds compared 
to pollen donors A1 (24.8%) and B1 (18.7%). This finding sug-
gests that the nonrandom matings observed in prior greenhouse 
pollination studies were not an artifact of greenhouse conditions.     
 While  ecological  interactions  between  plants  are  often 
much less obvious than those of animals, careful and ingenious 
experiments such as those of Marshall and her colleagues are 
proving that they are every bit as rich and fascinating. 

 In sections 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 we have seen how organisms 
as different as fish, insects, and plants compete for and select 
mates. While competition for mates may be intense, the vast 

Pollen donor C1 pollinated a much 
higher percentage of seeds than either 
A1 or B1, indicating nonrandom 
mating in this field situation.

majority  of  mature  females  in  most  populations  mate  and  a 
large proportion of males may also mate. In populations that 
have evolved a high degree of sociality, however, the oppor-
tunities for mating are often restricted to relatively few indi-
viduals in the population.

     2.   What would you expect to see in  figure 8.15  if perfor-

mance were equal across pollen donors?      

  8.4  Sociality 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 8.13  Distinguish between eusociality and simpler forms 

of sociality.

 8.14  Define inclusive fitness, kin selection, Hamilton’s 
rule, natal territory, philopatry, and lifetime repro-
ductive success.

 8.15  Discuss the evidence indicating a role for kin selec-
tion in the evolution of cooperative behavior among 
woodhoopoes and African lions.

Evolution of sociality in many species appears driven by the 
need  for  group  defense  of  high-quality  territories  and/or 
defense of mates and young.   Chapters 5 through 7 focused 
on  the  ecology  of  individual  organisms,  mainly  on  how  indi-
viduals  solve  environmental  problems.  Some  of  the  problems 
we  considered  were  how  animals  maintain  a  particular  range 
of  body  temperatures  in  the  face  of  much  greater  variation  in 
environmental temperatures or how plants sustain high rates of 
photosynthesis while avoiding excessive water loss. In the pre-
ceding parts of chapter 8 we’ve also concentrated on the ecology 
of individuals, examining how individuals choose mates. How-
ever, a fundamental change in relationships among individuals 
within a population takes place when individuals begin living in 
groups, such as colonies, herds, or schools, and begin to cooper-
ate with each other. Cooperation generally involves exchanges 
of resources between individuals or various forms of assistance, 
such as defense of the group against predators. Group living and 
cooperation  signal  the  beginnings  of      sociality    .   The  degree  of 
sociality in a social species ranges from acts as simple as mutual 
grooming or group protection of young to highly complex, strat-
ified societies such as those found in colonies of ants or termites. 
This more complex level of social behavior, which is considered 
to be the pinnacle of social evolution, is called     eusociality    .  Euso-
ciality is generally thought to include three major characteris-
tics: (1) individuals of more than one generation living together, 
(2)  cooperative  care  of  young,  and  (3)  division  of  individuals 
into sterile, or nonreproductive, and reproductive castes. 

 Because individuals in social species often appear to have 
fewer  opportunities  to  reproduce  compared  to  individuals 

 

Chapter 8

in  nonsocial  species,  the  evolution  of  sociality  has  drawn  a 
great deal of attention from behavioral ecologists. The appar-
ent  restriction  of  reproductive  opportunities  that  comes  with 
 sociality appears to challenge the idea that the fitness of an indi-
vidual is determined by the number of offspring it produces. 
How  does  sociality  challenge  this  concept  of  fitness?  The 
challenge emerges from the observation that in social species, 
many  individuals do not reproduce themselves, while helping 
others  in  the  population  to  do  so.  How  can  we  explain  such 
behavior that on first glance appears to be self-sacrificing? It 
can be argued that such behavior should be quickly eliminated 
from populations. However, since eusocial species such as bees 
and ants have survived for millions of years, behavioral ecolo-
gists have assumed that in some circumstances, the benefits of 
sociality must outweigh the costs. 

 Behavioral  ecologists  have  assumed  that  the  key  to 
understanding the evolution of sociality will result from care-
ful assessment of its costs and benefits. The ultimate goal of 
sociobiology  has  been  a  comprehensive  theory  capable  of 
explaining  the  evolution  of  the  various  forms  of  sociality, 
particularly its most specialized form, eusociality. However, 
in  our  quest  for  such  a  theory,  where  should  we  begin  the 
accounting of costs and benefits? David Ligon (1999) pointed 
the  way  when  he  wrote,  “Most,  if  not  all,  of  the  important 
issues relevant to cooperative breeding systems are . . . related 
to the costs and benefits of sociality.” Following Ligon’s sug-
gestion, this Concept section focuses on cooperative breeders.  

   Cooperative Breeders 
 Species that live in groups often cooperate or help during the 
process of producing offspring. Help may include defending 
the territory or the young, preparing and maintaining a nest 
or den, or feeding young. Since the young which receive the 
care are not the offspring of the helpers, one of the most basic 
questions  that  we  can  ask  about  these  breeding  systems  is 
why do helpers help? In other words, what benefits do helpers 
gain from their cooperation? 

 Sociobiologists  have  offered  two  main  reasons.  First, 
helpers may increase their own evolutionary, or genetic, fitness 
by improving the rates of survival and reproduction of rela-
tives. Sociobiologists have suggested that investing resources, 
such as time or energy, in genetically related individuals that 
are not offspring (for instance, siblings, cousins, nieces, and 
so  forth)  may  add  to  an  individual’s      inclusive   fitness    .   The 
concept of inclusive fitness, which was developed by William 
D. Hamilton (1964), proposes that an individual’s inclusive, 
or overall, fitness is determined by its own survival and repro-
duction plus the survival and reproduction of individuals with 
whom  the  individual  shares  genes.  Under  some  conditions, 
individuals  can  increase  their  inclusive  fitness  by   helping 
increase  the  survival  and  reproduction  of  genetic  relatives 
that are not offspring. Because this help is given to relatives, 
or  kin,  the  evolutionary  force  favoring  such  helping  behav-
ior is called     kin selection    .  Hamilton proposed that selection 
will favor diverting resources to kin under conditions where 
its benefit to the helper, measured as improved survival and 

reproduction of kin, exceeds its cost to the helper. Known as 
    Hamilton’s rule    ,  this idea can be expressed mathematically 
as: R g B  2  C > 0, where R g  is the genetic relatedness of the 
helper and the recipient of the help, B is the reproductive ben-
efit gained by the recipient, and C is the reproductive cost to 
the helper of giving aid. 

 The  second  reason  offered  to  explain  the  evolution  of 
cooperative breeding is that helping may improve the helper’s 
own probability of successful reproduction. Because helping 
gives  the  helper  experience  in  raising  young,  helping  may 
increase the helper’s chances of successfully raising young of 
its own and recruiting helpers of its own. In addition, where 
suitable breeding habitat is limited, helpers may have a bet-
ter chance of inheriting the breeding territory from the repro-
ductive individuals they help. Again, they are improving their 
chances of eventually raising their own young. 

 What  sorts  of  species  engage  in  cooperative  breeding? 
Approximately  100  species  of  birds  are  cooperative  breed-
ers. In addition, several species of mammals such as wolves, 
wild dogs, African lions, and meerkats engage in cooperative 
breeding ( fig. 8.17 ). Let’s review two intensely studied spe-
cies where several benefits of cooperative breeding have been 
demonstrated.     

  Green Woodhoopoes 
 We  know  a  great  deal  about  the  cooperative  breeding  and 
general ecology of green woodhoopoes due to the pioneering, 
long-term studies of J. David Ligon and Sandra Ligon (Ligon 
and  Ligon  1978,  1982,  1989,  1991). Adult  green  woodhoo-
poes,   Phoeniculus  purpureus,   have  reddish-orange  bills  and 
feet and black feathers with a metallic green and blue- purple 
sheen  ( fig.  8.18 ).  Meanwhile,  juvenile  green   woodhoopoes 
have  black  bills  and  feet,  which  allowed  the  Ligons  to  dis-
tinguish  between  mature  and  immature  individuals  in  the 
field. Of the eight species of woodhoopoes, all of which are 
restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, the green woodhoopoe is the 
most  common  and  widespread.  Green  woodhoopoes  live  in 

 Figure 8.17   Meerkats,  Suricata suricatta,  are native to southern 
Africa, where they live in cooperatively breeding groups of up to 30 indi-
viduals. Within a group of meerkats, commonly called a “mob,” a domi-
nant female and a dominant male produce most of the young, with other 
adults sharing in guarding and defending the mob and caring for pups.

  Adaptations to the Environment

on  nestlings  include  driver  ants,  hawks,  and  owls.  Roosting 
adults  are  attacked  at  night  by  driver  ants  and  large-spotted 
genets—small, slender predators related to the mongoose. The 
vulnerability  of  nestlings  and  roosting  adults  to  these  preda-
tors depends on the characteristics of the cavity, especially its 
depth, the size of the opening, and the soundness of the wood. 
 Green  woodhoopoes  stay  very  close  to  their      natal 
 territories    ,   the  territories  where  they  were  raised.  Out  of 
38 females that the Ligons banded as nestlings or fledglings 
and later observed breeding, 18 bred on their natal territory, 
14  bred  on  an  adjacent  territory,  and  6  only  two  or  three 
 territories  away  from  their  natal  territory.  Male  dispersal  is 
also limited. In other words, this population of green wood-
hoopoes shows a great deal of     philopatry    .  Philopatry, which 
means   literally  “love  of  place,”  is  a  term  that  behavioral 
ecologists use to describe the tendency of some organisms to 
remain in the same area throughout their lives. 

 Why do green woodhoopoes stay at home and help raise 
young, which are close relatives, rather than disperse to pro-
duce their own offspring? The Ligons suggested that the major 
factor  producing  this  high  degree  of  philopatry  is  that  roost 
cavities on which green woodhoopoes depend in the highlands 
of Kenya are scarce. By staying home, a young green wood-
hoopoe gets a warm and relatively safe place to roost at night 
and may eventually inherit the territory and its cavities. 

 Over the course of their study, the Ligons found that 91% 
of females and 89% of males died without leaving any descen-
dants. However, they also documented very high reproductive 
success  among  some  woodhoopoes.  Variation  in  reproduc-
tive success within the study area seemed to have two major 
sources, spatial and temporal variation. Year-to-year variation 
in breeding success was associated with variation in rainfall, 
which  appears  to  influence  the  woodhoopoes’  food  supply. 
The main food that woodhoopoes give to nestlings are moth 
larvae that pupate in the soil and are sensitive to soil moisture. 
In general, rainfall during the dry season correlates with high 
mortality of these pupae and reproductive failure among the 
woodhoopoes ( fig. 8.19 ).     

 The  second  source  of  variation  in  reproductive  success 
appears to be differences in territory quality. The Ligons found

a wide variety of habitats at elevations from sea level to over 
2,000 m. However, their most common habitat is open wood-
lands with trees large enough to provide cavities for nesting 
and roosting. For instance, the Ligons’ long-term study site, 
near  Lake  Naivasha  in  the  central  rift  valley  of  Kenya,  was 
located in a woodland dominated by yellow-barked acacia.     

 Tree  cavities  keep  the  birds  warm  at  night  and  provide 
some  protection  from  predators.  The  habit  of  cavity  roost-
ing  also  makes  green  woodhoopoes  ideal  for  field  studies. 
To place unique color bands on green woodhoopoes in their 
study area, all the Ligons had to do was plug the opening to 
a roosting cavity after dark and then place a clear plastic bag 
over the opening in the morning to catch the woodhoopoes as 
they left the roost. Using this technique, they placed unique 
color bands on 386 green woodhoopoes. By closely studying 
the  movements  and  interactions  of  banded  individuals  over 
a long period of time, the Ligons learned a great deal of the 
social  relations  of  green  woodhoopoes.  For  instance,  they 
eventually  knew  the  parentage  of  over  93%  of  the  birds  in 
their study area, the number and fates of offspring produced 
by each flock, and the identity of all breeders and nonbreed-
ers in each flock. The results of this long-term study provide 
clues to the costs and benefits of cooperative breeding. 

 The  Ligons  found  that  green  woodhoopoes  live  in  ter-
ritories  that  are  occupied  and  defended  by  flocks  of  2  to 
16  individuals. Average flock size varied from approximately 
4 to 6 over the course of their studies. Within a group, only 
one  pair  breeds,  while  the  remainder  act  as  helpers.  Males, 
which  are  approximately  20%  larger  than  females,  are  par-
ticularly vigorous in their defense of breeding territories. The 
Ligons  (1989)  suggested  that  the  larger  body  size  of  males 
is related to their intense competition with other males over 
territories  and  females.  Territory  defense  is  very  important 
because territories appear to vary widely in quality. 

 One of the most obvious differences among territories is 
the quality of the cavities they contain. Cavity characteristics 
are important, since predation while the birds are in their roost-
ing or nesting cavities is a major source of mortality. The Ligons 
documented  annual  mortality  rates  of  30%  for  females  and 
40% for males, most of which was due to predation. Predators

that territories fell into two clearly distinctive groups, which 
they called high-quality and low-quality territories. Territory 
quality appeared to be mainly determined by the availability 
of roosting cavities capable of protecting the birds from preda-
tors.  Figure 8.20  compares the average number of young pro-
duced per year on low-quality and high-quality territories. As 
you can see, the number of offspring produced on high-quality 
territories  is  approximately  twice  as  high  as  on  low-quality 
territories during both favorable and unfavorable years.     

 While the birds can do nothing about the chances of rain-
fall  during  the  dry  season,  they  can  and  do  compete  for  ter-
ritories.  Those  flocks  that  successfully  compete  for  the  best

territories have a clear reproductive advantage. So, returning to 
our original question, why do green woodhoopoes stay home 
and help? The first reason seems to be that by helping to raise 
and protect close relatives, the helpers may increase their inclu-
sive fitness (Hawn, Radford, and du Plessis 2007). The Ligons 
found that the bulk of the young tended by helpers ranged from 
half siblings to full siblings. We should keep in mind that a full 
sibling,  on  average,  would  share  as  many  genes  (50%)  with 
the helper as its own son or daughter. The second and perhaps 
clearest potential benefit to a helper is that since high-quality 
territories are limited in number, the chance of inheriting the 
natal territory and advancing to breeding status may be greater 
than finding another suitable territory elsewhere. 

 Recent  studies  have  shown  that  delaying  reproduction 
by  green  woodhoopoes,  as  they  help  tend  nests,  has  oppo-
site  effects  on  males  and  females.  Amanda  Hawn,  Andrew 
 Radford, and Morné du Plessis (2007) used a 24-year study of 
green woodhoopoes in South Africa to explore the influence of 
delayed  reproduction  on      lifetime  reproductive  success   —the 
total number of offspring produced over the course of a lifetime. 
The pattern that they uncovered for males was what you might 
expect.  Males  that  began  reproducing  at  a  younger  age  pro-
duced more offspring that successfully fledged over the course 
of their lives ( fig. 8.21  a ). In contrast, female green woodhoo-
poes that delay reproduction until they are older have higher 
lifetime  reproductive  success  ( fig.  8.21  b ).  The  main  reason 
for the positive relationship between female age at first repro-
duction and lifetime reproductive success is that females that 
started reproducing at 1 to 3 years of age had higher mortality 
compared to those that delayed reproducing until they were 4 to 
6 years old. Over 60% of young females died 1 to 2 years after 
beginning  to  reproduce,  whereas  only  30%  of  older  females 
died within their first 2 reproductive years. Hawn, Radford, and 
du Plessis also point out that females that delay reproduction 
also spend more years as helpers raising close relatives, which 
adds significantly to their inclusive fitness.     

In contrast, females that delay 
reproduction have higher lifetime 
reproductive success.

    Investigating the Evidence  8 

 Estimating Heritability Using Regression Analysis 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 8.16  Describe regression analysis.
 8.17  Appraise the relative degrees to which traits are 

heritable based on regression coefficients.

 As we have seen, the extent to which phenotypic variation in 
a  trait  is  determined  by  genetic  variation  affects  its  potential 
to evolve by natural selection. In other words, the potential for 
a trait to evolve is affected by the trait’s heritability. How can 
we estimate the heritability of a particular trait? One common 
method  is  through  regression  analysis.  Regression  analysis  is 
a statistical technique used to explore the extent to which one 
factor,  called  the     independent  variable     (usually  symbolized 
as X), determines the value of another variable, which we call 
the    dependent variable    (usually represented by the symbol Y). 
In regression analysis, we construct X-Y plots as we did when 
we explored scatter plots and correlation (Investigating the Evi-
dence, chapter 7, p. 168). However, regression analysis is used 
to determine the equation for a line, called a    regression line    ,  that 
best fits the relationship between X and Y. When the relationship 
between X and Y follows a straight line, such as those shown in 
 figure 8.21 , the regression equation takes the following form:   

Y 5 bX 1 a 

In  this  equation,   a   is  the  point  at  which  the  line  crosses  the 
Y  axis,  which  is  called  the Y  intercept,  and   b,   which  is  the 
slope of the line, is the    regression coefficient    .  

 What might we learn about the evolution of cooperative 
breeding from other species? Several cooperative species live 
in sub-Saharan Africa. For example, the African lion, a spe-
cies that shares the same landscape with green woodhoopoes, 
also seems to be forced by a variety of environmental circum-
stances into a cooperative social system.  

  African Lions 
 At about the same time that the Ligons were studying coop-
erative  breeding  among  green  woodhoopoes,  Craig  Packer 
and Anne E. Pusey were studying cooperation among African 
lions  in  the  Serengeti  (Packer  and  Pusey  1982,  1983,  1997, 
Packer et al. 1991). Their studies have revealed a great deal 
of complexity in lion societies. Female lions live in groups of 
related individuals called prides ( fig. 8.22 ). Prides of female 
lions generally include 3 to 6 adults but may contain as many 
as 18 or as few as 1. In addition to adult females, prides also 
include  their  dependent  offspring  and  a  coalition  of  adult 
males ( fig. 8.23 ). Male coalitions may be made up of closely 
related individuals or of unrelated individuals.     

 Let’s use a natural system to learn more about regression 
analysis and its use in heritability studies. In heritability stud-
ies,  we  are  interested  in  the  extent  to  which  the  characteris-
tics of parents determine the characteristics of offspring. For 
instance,  a  team  of  Dutch  scientists  studying  waterlily  leaf 
beetles (Pappers et al. 2002) explored the heritability of body 
size, measured as body length, in different populations of the 
beetle. As we saw in the studies of Randy Thornhill, male body 
size can have a very significant influence on mating success 
(see   fig.  8.13 ).  To  determine  the  heritability  of  body  length, 
they conducted regression analyses using the body length of 
parents as the independent variable, and body length of the off-
spring as the dependent variable. Because each of the parents 
contributes to the genotype of the offspring, the value used for 
parental body length is the “mid-parent body length,” which is 
the average of the two parents’ body lengths. Let’s consider the 
relationships between length of parents and offspring, and use 
regression  analysis  to  estimate  heritability  of  body  length  in 
some hypothetical populations of waterlily leaf beetles. 

 Consider  the  three  scatter  plots  shown  in   figure  1   and 
the lines drawn through the scatter of points. Again, these are 
much like the scatter plots we examined in chapter 7 but with 
regression  lines  drawn  through  each. The  regression  coeffi-
cient in each of the graphs indicates the level of heritability 
in  the  three  hypothetical  populations.  In  population  (a),  the 
regression coefficient of 0.00 indicates that there is no rela-
tionship  between  parental  body  length  and  the  body  length 
of offspring. This result is apparent from just the scatter plot, 
which shows that parents of any length, large or small, can 

 Within lion society one can observe many forms of coop-
eration. Female lions nurse each other’s cubs. They also coop-
erate when hunting large, difficult-to-kill game such as zebra 
and  buffalo.  In  addition,  females  cooperatively  defend  their 
territory against encroaching females. However, the most crit-
ical form of cooperation among females is their group defense 
of the young against infanticidal males. These attacks on the 
young  generally  take  place  as  a  male  coalition  is  displaced 
by another invading coalition. While a single female lion has 
little chance in a fight against a male lion, which are nearly 
50% larger, cooperating females are often successful at repel-
ling attacking males. Males, in turn, cooperate in defending 
the territory against invading males, which threaten the young 
they have sired, and against threats from other predators such 
as  hyenas.  The  challenge  for  the  behavioral  ecologist  has 
been to determine whether these various forms of cooperation 
can be reconciled with evolutionary theory. 

 Since the females in lion prides are always close relatives, 
their cooperative behavior can be readily explained within the 
conceptual framework of kin selection. As females cooperate

The regression coefficient of

population.

that the variation in body length among the offspring is deter-
mined  entirely  by  environmental  effects.  In  contrast,  body 
length has a heritability of 0.52 in population (b) and 0.81 in 
population (c). What do these values indicate? With a herita-
bility of 0.52, we can conclude that about half of the variation 
in body length in population (b) results from genetic effects, 
and  about  half  from  environmental  effects,  such  as  food 

quality, temperature, and so forth. The regression coefficient 
of 0.81 in population (c) indicates that more of the variation 
in body length in the  offspring in that population is the result 
of genetic effects. 

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  8 
     1.  What  are  the  evolutionary  implications  of  the  patterns 

shown in  figure 1 ?     

in nursing or defending young against males, they contribute 
to the growth and survival of their own offspring or to those of 
close kin. Cooperative hunting and sharing the kill also con-
tribute to the welfare of offspring and close relatives. All these 
contributions add to the inclusive fitness of individual females. 
 In contrast, because male coalitions are sometimes made 
up  of  close  relatives  and  sometimes  not,  cooperation  within 
coalitions  has  represented  a  greater  challenge  to  evolution-
ary  theory.  However,  on  close  consideration,  Packer  and 
colleagues (Packer et al. 1991) discovered that the rules asso-
ciated with the formation and behavior of coalitions are con-
sistent with predictions of evolutionary theory. Single males 
have virtually no chance of claiming and defending a pride of 
female lions; therefore, they must form coalitions with other 
males. This represents a type of ecological constraint on viable 
choices open to males. If males form a coalition with brothers 
and cousins, cooperative behavior that increases the produc-
tion and survival of offspring of the coalition will increase an 
individual  male’s  inclusive  fitness.  However,  theoretically,  a 
male  within  a  coalition  with  unrelated  males  must  produce

himself and without improving his inclusive fitness, since the 
other coalition members are not relatives. This result suggests 
that males should avoid joining larger coalitions of unrelated 
males, and this is just what Packer and his colleagues found. 
 Figure 8.25  shows the percentage of males with unrelated part-
ners in coalitions of different sizes. These patterns show clearly 
that males that team up with unrelated individuals mostly do so 
in coalitions of two or three. Larger coalitions of four to nine 
individuals are almost entirely made up of relatives.   

 In  summary,  cooperation  among  green  woodhoopoes 
and African lions appears to be a response to environmental 
conditions that require cooperation for success. In the case of 
green  woodhoopoes,  the  scarcity  of  high-quality  territories 
and  intense  competition  between  flocks  for  those  territories 
create conditions that favor staying in the natal territory and 
helping raise related young and perhaps inheriting the territory 
at a later date. Packer and Pusey (1997) captured the situation 
facing African lions in a fascinating article titled, “Divided We

 Figure 8.23   The mane of adult male African lions has evolved 
under the complex influences of sexual and natural selection. Female

selection) favor long, dark manes, while thermal regulation under the hot 
equatorial sun favors short, light-colored manes (West and Packer 2002).

some offspring of his own or he is merely increasing the fit-
ness of others at the expense of his own fitness. 

 The first question we should ask is: Do all males within a 
coalition have an equal opportunity to reproduce? If all males 
within  a  coalition  have  an  equal  probability  of  reproducing, 
then forming coalitions with unrelated males is easier to rec-
oncile with evolutionary theory. However, if there is significant 
variation  in  reproductive  opportunities  within  coalitions,  then 
cooperating with unrelated males is more difficult to reconcile 
with theories predicting that individuals will attempt to maxi-
mize their inclusive fitness. It turns out that the probability of 
a male siring young depends on his rank within a coalition and 
on coalition size. As shown in  figure 8.24 , males in coalitions of 
two sire relatively similar proportions of the young produced by 
the pride. In addition, these proportions are close to the propor-
tions sired by the two top-ranked males in coalitions of three 
and four. However, the third-ranked males in coalitions of three 
and the third and fourth-ranked in coalitions of four sire almost 
no young lions. Packer and his team concluded from these data 
that variation in reproductive success is much higher in coali-
tions of three and four than in coalitions of two. In other words, 
the  chance  of  reproducing  is  less  evenly  distributed  among 
males in coalitions of three and four than in coalitions of two.     

 What implications do the results of Packer’s studies have 
to the formation of coalitions containing unrelated individuals? 
One of the implications is that an unrelated male in a coalition 
of three or more runs the risk of investing time and energy in 
helping maintain a pride without an opportunity to reproduce

Fall: Cooperation Among Lions.” To survive, reproduce, and 
successfully  raise  offspring  to  maturity,  African  lions  must 
work in cooperative groups. The lone lion has no chance of 
meeting the ecological challenges presented by living on the 
Serengeti in lion society with its aggressive prides and inva-
sive  and  infanticidal  male  coalitions.  However,  as  we  have 
seen,  within  the  constraints  set  by  their  environments,  both 
green woodhoopoes and African lions appear to behave in a 
way that contributes positively to their overall fitness. 

 While the complexities of African lion and green wood-
hoopoe  societies  have  taken  decades  to  uncover,  they  pale 
beside  the  intricacies  of  life  among  eusocial  species,  such 
as bees, termites, and ants. Let’s explore eusociality in some 
animal populations to get some insights into the evolution of 
these complex social systems and to introduce the comparative 
method, one of the most valuable tools in evolutionary ecology. 

  Concept 8.4 Review 

1.   The Ligons found that most of the young woodhoopoes 
tended by helpers were either full siblings or half siblings 
of the helpers. If full siblings were genetically related to 
the helpers by an average of 50%, what was the genetic 
relationship between helpers and half siblings?  

 2.   According  to  Hamilton’s  rule,  would  helpers  derive 
greater benefit through kin selection by contributing the 
same amount of help toward raising a full sibling or a 
half sibling?  

     3.   What are the evolutionary implications of the fact that 
larger coalitions of male lions consist almost entirely of 
close relatives ( see fig. 8.25 )?        

  8.5  Eusociality 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 8.18  Describe the comparative method.
 8.19  Compare the social organization of colonies of leaf-

cutter ants and naked mole rats.

 8.20  Describe the evidence for and against the influence 

of haplodiploidy on the evolution of eusociality.

Kin selection and ecological constraints may have played 
key roles in the evolution of eusociality.   Behavioral ecolo-
gists are concerned both with how particular social systems 
work  and  with  determining  the  mechanisms  responsible  for 
their evolution and maintenance. In most cases, however, the 
evolutionary  origins  of  biological  traits  lie  deep  in  the  past 
and  biologists  cannot  observe  their  evolution  directly.  So, 
how  do  scientists  construct  evolutionary  hypotheses,  test 
them,  and  eventually  construct  evolutionary  theories?  Many 
tools are used in such a process. We have already employed 
one of those tools, in a rudimentary way, without giving it a 
name. As we explored mate choice and sexual selection using 

guppies, scorpionflies, and wild radish, we were employing 
one of the most valuable tools available to evolutionary biolo-
gists. That tool is the     comparative method    .  The comparative 
method involves comparisons of the characteristics of differ-
ent species or populations of organisms in a way that attempts 
to  isolate  a  particular  variable  or  characteristic  of  interest, 
such as sociality. 

 Let’s review a remarkable case of convergence in social 
organization between a eusocial insect and a eusocial mam-
mal.  Such  comparisons,  the  foundation  of  the  comparative 
method, if quantified and replicated across many species, can 
help  disentangle  the  evolution  of  complex  characteristics, 
including the evolution of social systems.  

   Eusocial Species 
 Probably the most thoroughly studied of eusocial species are 
the ants. Taxonomists have described nearly 9,000 species of 
ants, all belonging to the family Formicidae, which along with 
their relatives the wasps and bees, are members of the insect 
order  Hymenoptera.  Hölldobler  and  Wilson  (1990)  wrote  a 
monumental summary of what was known about ants near the 
end of the twentieth century in a book titled simply  The Ants.  
However, despite that book and the thousands of studies done 
on ants since its publication, much is left to learn about this 
group of insects that Hölldobler and Wilson referred to as the 
“culmination of insect evolution.” 

 One  of  the  most  socially  complex  groups  of  ants  are 
the leaf-cutters ( fig. 8.26 ). The 39 described species of leaf- 
cutter  ants,  which  belong  to  two  genera,  are  found  only  in 
the  Americas, from the southern United States to Argentina. 
Leaf-cutter ants make their living by cutting and transporting 
leaf fragments to their nest, where the leaf material is frag-
mented and used as a substrate upon which to grow fungi. The 
fungi provide the primary food source for leaf-cutter ants.     

 Among the various species of leaf-cutter ants, some of the 
most  thoroughly  studied  are  species  belonging  to  the  genus 
Atta. Atta   species  live  mainly  in  tropical  Central  and  South 
America. However, at least two species reach as far north as 
Arizona and Louisiana in the United States. Leaf-cutter ants

are  important  consumers  in  the  tropical  ecosystems,  where 
they move large amounts of soil and process large quantities 
of  leaf  material  in  their  nests.  The  nests  of  leaf-cutter  ants 
can attain great size. For instance, the nests of  A.  sexdens  can 
include over 1,000 entrance holes and nearly 2,000 occupied 
and abandoned chambers. In one excavation of an  A.  sexdens  
nest  (cited  in  Hölldobler  and  Wilson  1990),  researchers 
estimated that the ants had moved more than 22 m 3  of soil, 
which  weighed  over  40,000  kg.  Within  this  nest,  the  occu-
pants had stored nearly 6,000 kg of leaves. Mature nests of 
 A. sexdens  contain a queen, various numbers of winged males 
and females, which disperse to mate and found colonies else-
where, and up to 5 to 8 million workers. 

 Though  involving  far  fewer  individuals,  there  are  strik-
ing  analogies  between  the  organization  of  ant  colonies  and 
colonies  of  naked  mole  rats,   Heterocephalus  glaber,   one  of 
the few species of eusocial mammals ( fig. 8.27 ). Despite their 
common name, naked mole rats are not completely naked and 
they are neither moles nor rats. Like moles, naked mole rats 
live  underground  but  they  are  rodents,  not  moles.  However, 
the  family  of  rodents  to  which  they  belong  is  more  closely 
related to porcupines and chinchillas than to rats.     

 Naked mole rats live in underground colonies in the arid 
regions of Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia. Colonies often include 
70 to 80 individuals but can sometimes contain as many as 250 
individuals. The burrow system of a single colony of naked mole 
rats is extensive and can cover up to approximately 100,000 m 2 , 
or  about  20  football  fields.  Most  of  the  digging  required  to 
maintain their large burrow systems is done with the naked mole 
rats’ teeth and massive jaws. It turns out that the jaw muscles of 
naked mole rats make up about 25% of their entire muscle mass. 
This would be approximately equivalent to having muscles the 
size of those in your legs powering your jaws! 

 Both  naked  mole  rats  and  leaf-cutter  ants  live  in  social 
groups  in  which  individuals  are  divided  among      castes     that 
engage  very  different  activities. We  can  define  a  caste  as  a 
group of physically distinctive individuals that engage in spe-
cialized behavior within the colony. E. O. Wilson (1980) stud-
ied how labor is divided among castes of ants in a laboratory 
colony  of   A.  sexdens   that  he  established  and  studied  over  a 

 Figure 8.27   Naked mole rats live in colonies of closely related 
individuals ruled by a single dominant female, or queen, shown here 
resting on top of members of her colony.

period of 8 years. During this period, Wilson carefully cata-
loged the behaviors of individual colony members. Because 
the colony lived in a closed series of clear plastic containers, 
their behavior could be studied easily. In addition to record-
ing behaviors, Wilson also estimated the sizes of individuals 
engaging in each behavior by measuring their head widths to 
the nearest 0.2 mm. He made his estimates visually by com-
paring an ant to a standard array of preserved  A. sexdens  spec-
imens of known size. 

 When  Wilson  compared  the  leaf-cutter  ant   A.  sexdens  
with three non-leaf-cutter ant species, he found that the leaf-
cutter ants included a larger number of castes and engaged in 
a  wider  variety  of  behaviors  ( fig.  8.28 ). Wilson  identified  a 
total of 29 distinctive tasks performed by the leaf-cutter ants 
compared to an average of 17.7 tasks performed by the three 
other species. He found that the division of labor within the 
 A. sexdens  colony was mainly based on size. Possibly because 
of the large number of specialized tasks that need to be per-
formed by leaf-cutter ants, they have one of the most complex 
social  structures  and  one  of  the  greatest  size  ranges  found 
among the ants. Within  A. sexdens  colonies, the head width 
of  the  largest  individuals  (5.2  mm)  is  nearly  nine  times  the 
head width of the smallest individuals (0.6 mm). On the basis 
of  size,  Wilson  identified  four  castes  within  his  leaf-cutter 
colony. However, because the tasks performed by some of the 
size classes change as they age, Wilson discovered three addi-
tional temporal or developmental castes for a total of seven 
castes  within  the  colony,  compared  to  an  average  of  three 
castes in the non-leaf-cutter ant species he studied.     

 As a consequence of this great variation, someone watch-
ing a trail of leaf-cutter ants bring freshly cut leaf fragments 
back to their nest is treated to a rich display of size and behav-
ioral diversity. While medium-sized ants carry the leaf frag-
ments  above  their  heads,  the  largest  ants  line  the  trail  like 
sentries,  guarding  against  ground  attacks  on  the  column  of 
ants carrying leaf fragments. Very small ants ride on many of 
the leaf fragments, protecting the ant carrying a leaf fragment 
from aerial attacks by parasitoid flies. Meanwhile, other size 
classes  of  leaf-cutters  performing  behaviors  associated  with 
processing leaves, tending larvae, and maintaining fungal gar-
dens  remain  hidden  in  the  nest.  It  was  the  activity  of  these 
smaller individuals that Wilson’s laboratory colony was able 
to reveal so clearly. 

 Careful study has revealed some remarkable parallels in 
the structures of naked mole rat and leaf-cutter ant societies. 
The social behavior of naked mole rats was first reported by 
Jennifer  Jarvis,  professor  at  the  University  of  Cape  Town, 
South Africa, in a paper in the journal  Science  (Jarvis 1981). 
Her published study was based on more than 6 years of obser-
vation and experimentation with colonies of naked mole rats 
that  she  had  established  in  the  laboratory.  Jarvis  dug  up  a 
number of colonies and relocated them to a laboratory habitat 
analogous to that used by Wilson in his study of leaf-cutter 
ants. She waited approximately a year after bringing the naked 
mole rats to the laboratory before attempting to quantify their 
behaviors.  Once  this  period  of  acclimation  was  over,  Jarvis 
spent approximately 100 hours detailing how the members of 
her laboratory population of naked mole rats spent their time.

behaviors in a colony of leaf-cutter ants,  Atta sexdens,  and in colonies 
of three other ant species (data from Wilson 1980).

 The picture of naked mole rat society that emerged from 
Jarvis’ study was immediately intriguing to behavioral ecolo-
gists.  The  social  organization  of  the  colony  appeared  more 
similar to an ant colony than to any other mammal population 
known. Jarvis’ paper in  Science  stimulated dozens of studies 
of naked mole rats and of related species. The results provide 
interesting insights into the evolution of social behavior. Within 
a colony of naked mole rats, one female and a few males breed. 
This group of reproductive individuals functions basically as 
a  queen  and  her  mates,  while  the  rest  of  the  colony  is  non-
reproductive.  Behavioral  ecologists  have  found  that  life  in  a 
naked mole rat colony centers on the queen and her offspring, 
and the queen’s behavior appears to maintain this focus. She 
is the most active member of the colony and literally pushes 
her way around the colony. By physically pushing individuals, 
she  appears  to  call  them  to  action  when  there  is  work  to  be 
done or when the colony is threatened and needs defending. 

Chapter 8 

  Social Relations 

193

The aggressiveness of the queen also appears to maintain her 
dominance over other females in the colony and prevents them 
from  coming  into  breeding  condition.  If  the  queen  dies  or 
is  removed  from  the  colony,  one  of  the  other  females  in  the 
colony will assume the role of queen. If two or more females 
compete for the position of queen, they may fight to the death 
during the process of establishing the new social hierarchy. 

 In  contrast  to  leaf-cutter  ant  colonies,  where  all  work-
ers are females, both males and females work in naked mole 
rat colonies. Jarvis found that work is divided among colony 
members,  as  in  leaf-cutter  ant  colonies,  according  to  size. 
However, in contrast to leaf-cutter ants, colonies of naked mole 
rats  include  only  two  worker  size  classes,  small  and  large. 
Small  workers  are  the  most  active.  Small  workers  excavate 
tunnels, build the nest, which is deeper than most of the pas-
sage ways, and line the nest with plant materials for bedding. 
In  addition, small workers also harvest food, mainly roots and 
tubers, and deliver it to other colony members, including the 
queen for feeding. Since they spend most of their time sleep-
ing, the role of large nonbreeders was unclear for some time. 
However, eventually researchers working in the field were able 
to observe these large nonbreeders in action. It turns out that 
the large workers, as in ant colonies, are a caste specializing 
in  defense.  If  the  tunnel  system  is  breached  by  members  of 
another colony, the large nonbreeders move out quickly from 
their  resting  places  to  defend  the  colony  from  the  invaders, 
literally  throwing  themselves  into  the  breach.  Eventually  the 
large nonbreeders push up enough soil to wall off the intrud-
ers. However, they may be most important in defending against 
snakes, the most dangerous predators of naked mole rats. When 
confronted with a snake, the large nonbreeders will try to kill 
the snake or spray it with soil until it is driven off or buried.  

  Evolution of Eusociality 
 The studies of Wilson and Jarvis suggest interesting parallels 
in the organizations of leaf-cutter ants and naked mole rat col-
onies, despite their distinctive evolutionary histories and other 
biological differences ( fig. 8.29 ). Similarities include division 
of labor within colonies based on size, with smaller workers 
specializing in foraging, nest maintenance, and excavation of 
extensive burrow systems. Meanwhile, larger workers in both 
species specialize in defense. In addition, reproduction in both 
species is limited to a single queen and her mates. These areas 
of convergence in social organization between such different 
organisms may help shed light on the forces responsible for 
the evolution of eusociality. Such comparisons form the basis 
of the comparative method.     

 What factors may have been important in the evolution 
and maintenance of naked mole rat and leaf-cutter ant social-
ity? Kin selection may play a role. Leaf-cutter ants along with 
other Hymenoptera, such as bees and wasps, have an inheri-
tance  system  called      haplodiploidy    .   The  term   haplodiploid  
refers to the number of chromosome sets possessed by males 
and  females.  In  haplodiploid  systems,  males  develop  from 
unfertilized  eggs  and  are  haploid,  whereas  females  develop 
from fertilized eggs and are diploid. One of the consequences 
of haplodiploidy is that worker ants within a colony can be

very  similar  genetically.  In  an  ant  colony  where  there  is  a 
single queen that mated with a single male, the workers will 
be more related to each other than they would be to their own 
offspring. W.  D.  Hamilton  (1964)  was  the  first  to  point  out 
that  under  these  conditions  the  average  genetic  similarity 
among workers would be 75%, while their relationship with 
any offspring they might produce would be 50%. 

 What is the source of this high degree of relatedness? The 
queen mates only during her mating flight and stores the sperm 
she receives to fertilize all the eggs she lays to produce daugh-
ters. If she mates with a single male, since he is haploid, all her 
daughters will receive the same genetic information from their 
male parent. As a consequence, the 50% of the genetic makeup 
that workers receive from their male parent will be identical. In 
addition, workers will share an average of 25% of their genes 
through  those  that  they  receive  from  the  queen,  yielding  an 
average genetic relatedness of 50%  1  25%  5  75%. Of course, 
where  queens  mate  with  more  than  one  male,  relatedness 
among colony members will be reduced. And, queens in many 
species of the highly social Hymenoptera, such as honeybees 
and  leaf-cutter  ants,  do  generally  mate  with  multiple  males 

(Strassmann 2001). This discovery weakens kin selection as 
an explanation for the evolution of eusociality in these species. 
The important role of haplodiploidy in the evolution of euso-
ciality had been long challenged by the existence of eusocial-
ity in termites, which are not haplodiploid, and the discovery 
of eusociality in other non-haplodiploid organisms, including 
shrimp,  beetles,  and  spiders  along  with  the  naked  mole  rats 
discussed here (Gadagkar 2010). 

 A high degree of relatedness can, however, be maintained 
in populations that are not haplodiploid. For instance, because 
naked mole rat colonies are relatively closed to outsiders, the 
individuals within each colony, like the workers within leaf-
cutter  ant  colonies,  are  also  very  similar  genetically.  Paul 
Sherman, Jennifer Jarvis, and Stanton Braude (1992) reported 
that approximately 85% of matings within a colony of naked 
mole rats are between parents and offspring or between sib-
lings. As a consequence of these matings between close rela-
tives, the relatedness between individuals within a colony is 
about 81%, suggesting that kin selection may be involved in 
the  maintenance  of  nonreproductive  helpers  in  colonies  of 
naked mole rats.

 What  factors  other  than  kin  selection  may  have  con-
tributed  to  the  evolution  of  eusociality?  Many  factors  have 
been  implicated.  While  researchers  working  on  ants  and 
other  social  Hymenoptera  have  emphasized  the  potential 
importance of kin selection, studies of cooperative-breeding 
vertebrate  species  have  emphasized  ecological  constraints. 
What  sorts  of  ecological  common  constraints  are  faced  by 
leaf- cutter ants and naked mole rats? One of the most obvi-
ous  is  the  work  associated  with  the  creation,  maintenance, 
and defense of extensive burrow systems against invasion by 
competing colonies or predators. The more social  organisms 
are  studied,  the  less  likely  it  has  become  that  one  or  a  few 
simple mechanisms will be adequate to explain their evolu-
tion. The relative roles of kin selection, ecological constraints, 
and other factors in the evolution of eusociality is an area of 
much current debate and research (Allen, Nowak, and Wilson 
2013; Nowak, Tarnita, and Wilson 2010; Ratnieks,  Foster, and 
Wenseleers 2011; West and Gardner 2013). 

  Concept 8.5 Review 

1.   How would a queen ant, or other eusocial hymenopteran 
queen, mating with several males affect the relatedness 
of workers within a colony? If common in social hyme-
noptera, how would queens mating with several males 
affect  the  potential  of  kin  selection  to  account  for  the 
evolution of eusociality in the hymenoptera?  

2.   What are two major ecological challenges favoring col-
ony living that are shared by leaf-cutter ants and naked 
mole rats?  

     3.   What evidence does colony structure offer in support of 
the idea that both leaf-cutter ants and naked mole rats 
must  vigorously  defend  their  colonies  from  predators 
and invaders?    

 Behavioral ecology has yielded many intriguing insights 
into the evolution of animal behavior, including some of the 
most complex of behavioral phenomena, such as eusociality. 
However, behavioral ecology also has much to offer of direct 
practical value, particularly in the area of conservation.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 8.21  Outline the questions that Tinbergen proposed for 

understanding a behavior.

 8.22  Discuss evidence indicating that environmental 

enrichment can improve survival by captive-bred 
animals when they are released into the wild.

 Ecologists are increasingly conscious of the essential role of 
behavioral ecology in conservation. However, Wayne Linklater 

(2004) points out that while behavioral ecology contributes a 
great  deal  to  conservation,  it  has  the  potential  to  contribute 
much more. To achieve its potential, Linklater suggests more 
balance across the conceptual framework for behavioral ecol-
ogy proposed by one of its founders, Niko Tinbergen (1963).  

  Tinbergen’s Framework 
 Tinbergen  proposed  that  a  thorough  understanding  of  any 
behavior requires answers to four fundamental questions:

     1.  What are the mechanistic causes of the behavior?  
    2.  How does development, including learning, influence the 

behavior?  

    3.  What is the evolutionary history of the behavior?  
    4.  How does the behavior contribute to fitness?    

 Reflecting contemporary emphasis within behavioral ecology, 
the central concepts of this chapter have focused principally 
on  the  last  question,  the  adaptive  significance  of  behavior. 
However, Linklater suggests that information critical to con-
servation  requires  more  attention  to Tinbergen’s  three  other 
questions. The following section discusses how the develop-
ment of behavior appears to be influenced by the environment 
in which animals are reared.  

  Environmental Enrichment 
and Development of Behavior 
 Programs  to  conserve  many  species  often  combine   captive 
rearing  and  reintroduction  to  the  wild.  However,  Fiona 
Mathews  and  her  colleagues  at  the  University  of  Oxford’s 
Conservation  Research  Unit  (Mathews  et  al.  2005)  point 
out  that  most  reintroductions  of  captive-bred  animals  fail. 
These researchers suggest that one reason for failure may be 
that  captive-bred  animals  behave  in  ways  that  reduce  their 
chance  of  survival.  For  instance,  Mathews  and  colleagues 
found that captive-bred bank voles,  Clethrionomys  glareolus , 
were  unable  to  process  a  key  natural  food  (hazelnuts)  and 
were  less  dominant  compared  to  wild-caught  bank  voles. 
These  researchers  suggest  that  increasing  the  complexity  of 
the captive environment, an approach called     environmental 
 enrichment    ,  may help captive animals retain behaviors criti-
cal to their survival in the wild. Their suggestion is supported 
by the results of a study of captive-bred fish.     

 In  a  series  of  elegant  experiments, Victoria  Braithwaite 
and Anne Salvanes (2005), of the Universities of Edinburgh 
and  Bergen,  respectively,  found  that  environmental  enrich-
ment  increases  the  behavioral  flexibility  of  captive-bred 
Atlantic cod,  Gadus morhua  (fig. 8.30). Based on the results 
of their study, they suggest that enriching the hatchery envi-
ronment may improve the success of fish stocking programs. 
Hatchery rearing and stocking, a common practice in fisher-
ies  management,  is  intended  to  counter  the  effects  of  over-
fishing and environmental degradation. However, survival of 
captive-bred  fish  in  the  wild  is  often  poor.  Braithwaite  and 
Salvanes suggest that poor survival among captive-bred fish 
may be due to behaviors developed in response to the typi-
cally uniform hatchery environment. To address this question,

they  raised  juvenile  cod  under  three  environmental  circum-

food available; and (4) variable food and space—a tank with a 
natural bottom and a variable food supply. 

 Braithwaite and Salvanes raised 100 juvenile cod in each 
condition.  Cod  raised  under  typical  hatchery   conditions  grew 
faster  than  any  other  experimental  groups.  However,  cod

cod when given the opportunity, were quicker to recover physio-
logically from a simulated predator attack ( fig. 8.31 ), responded 
to live prey more rapidly, and made a more rapid transition from 
pelleted, artificial food to live prey. Clearly environmental vari-
ability affects the development of several behaviors in cod that 
would likely influence their chances of surviving in the wild. 
There is great potential for further work on cod and for similar 
studies on other species. Such behavioral studies will undoubt-
edly yield a great deal of information helpful to conservation.         

 Social relations are important, since they often directly impact 
the reproductive contribution of individuals to future genera-
tions,  a  key  component  of  evolutionary  fitness,  the  number 
of offspring, or genes, contributed by an individual to future 
generations. One of the most fundamental social interactions 
between individuals takes place during sexual reproduction. 

  The effects of female mate choice on the evolution of 
ornamentation in males can be reduced by other sources 
of  natural  selection.   Sexual  selection  results  from  dif-
ferences  in  reproductive  rates  among  individuals  as  a  result 
of  differences  in  their  mating  success.  Sexual  selection  is 
thought  to  work  either  through  intrasexual  selection,  where 
individuals of one sex compete with each other for mates, or 
intersexual selection, when members of one sex choose mates 
from among members of the opposite sex on the basis of some 
particular  trait.  Experimental  evidence  supports  the  hypoth-
esis that the coloration of male guppies in local populations is 
determined by a dynamic interplay between natural selection 
exerted  by  predators,  under  which  less-colorful  males  have 
higher survival, and by female mate choice, which results in 
higher mating success by more-colorful males. 

  Females  in  some  species  select  mates  based  on  the 
male’s  ability  to  provide  important  resources.   Among 
scorpionflies,  larger  males  are  more  likely  to  successfully 
defend available arthropod offerings due to their advantages 
in  aggressive  encounters  and  consequently  mate  more  fre-
quently than smaller males without arthropod offerings. 

  Mating in wild plant populations can be nonrandom.  
Studies  of  mating  in  the  wild  radish,   Raphanus  sativus,   in 
greenhouse and field experiments indicate nonrandom mating 
and suggest competition among pollen from different pollen 
donors. 

  Evolution of sociality in many species appears driven 
by  the  need  for  group  defense  of  high-quality  territories 
and/or defense of mates and young.   The degree of sociality 
in a social species ranges from acts as simple as mutual groom-
ing or group protection of young to highly complex, stratified 
 societies such as those found in colonies of ants or termites. This 
more complex level of social behavior, which is considered to 
be the pinnacle of social evolution, is called eusociality. Euso-
ciality is generally thought to include three major characteris-
tics: (1) individuals of more than one generation living together, 

 

Chapter 8 

  Social Relations 

197

(2) cooperative care of young, and (3) division of individuals 
into sterile, or nonreproductive, and reproductive castes. 

 Cooperation  among  green  woodhoopoes  and  African 
lions  appears  to  be  a  response  to  environmental  conditions 
that require cooperation for success. For green woodhoopoes, 
the scarcity of high-quality territories and intense competition 
between flocks for those territories create conditions that favor 
staying in the natal territory and helping raise related young 
and perhaps inheriting the territory at a later date. To survive, 
reproduce, and successfully raise offspring to maturity, Afri-
can lions must work in cooperative groups of females, which 
are called prides, and of males, which are called coalitions. 

  Kin  selection  and  ecological  constraints  may  have 
played key roles in the evolution of eusociality. 
 The compar-
ative method has been used to study the evolution of eusociality 

among a wide variety of animal species, including leaf-cutter 
ants and naked mole rats, both of which live in social groups in 
which individuals are divided among castes that engage in very 
different  activities.  Compared  to  other  ant  species,  leaf- cutter 
ant  colonies  have  a  larger  number  of  castes  that  engage  in  a 
wider variety of behaviors. In contrast to leaf-cutter ant colonies, 
where all workers are females, both males and females work in 
naked mole rat colonies. However, as in leaf-cutter ant colonies, 
work  in  naked  mole  rat  colonies  is  divided  among  members 
according to their size. Many factors have likely contributed to 
the evolution of eusociality in leaf-cutter ants and naked mole 
rats, including kin selection and ecological constraints. 

 Behavioral ecology has much to offer of direct practical 
value to conservation biology, such as the influence of envi-
ronment on the development of behavior.

  Review Questions 

     1.  The introduction to chapter 8 included sketches of the behavior 
and social systems of several fish species. Using the concepts 
that you have learned in this chapter, revisit those examples and 
predict the forms of sexual selection occurring in each species.  
    2.  One  of  the  basic  assumptions  of  the  material  presented  in 
chapter 8 is that the form of reproduction will exert substantial 
influence on social interactions within a species. How might 
interactions  differ  in  populations  that  reproduce  asexually 
versus  ones  that  engage  in  sexual  reproduction?  How  might 
having separate sexes versus hermaphrodites affect the types 
of social interactions within a population? How should having 
several forms of one sex, for example, large and small males, 
influence  the  diversity  of  behavioral  interactions  within  the 
population?  

    3.  Endler  (1980)  pointed  out  that  though  field  observations  are 
consistent with the hypothesis that predators may exert natural 
selection on guppy coloration, some other factors in the envi-
ronment  could  be  affecting  variation  in  male  color  patterns 
among guppy populations. What other factors, especially physi-
cal and chemical factors, might influence male color?  

    4.  Endler set up two experiments, one in the greenhouse and one 
in the field. What were the advantages of the greenhouse exper-
iments? What were the shortcomings of the greenhouse experi-
ments?  Endler  also  set  up  field  experiments  along  the Aripo 
River. What were the advantages of the field experiments and 
what were their shortcomings?  

    5.  Discuss the scorpionfly mating system. Pay particular attention 
to the potential roles of intersexual and intrasexual selection in 
scorpionflies.  

    6.  The  results  of  numerous  studies  indicate  nonrandom  mating 
among plants at least under some conditions. These results lead 
to  questions  concerning  the  biological  mechanisms  that  pro-
duce these nonrandom matings. How might the maternal plant 
control  or  at  least  influence  the  paternity  of  her  seeds? What 
role might competition between pollen determine in the nonran-
dom patterns observed?  

    7.  The details of experimental design are critical for determining 
the success or failure of both field and laboratory experiments. 
Results often depend on some small details. For instance, why 
did Jennifer Jarvis wait 1 year after establishing her laboratory 
colony  of  naked  mole  rats  before  attempting  to  quantify  the 
behavior of the laboratory population? What might have been 
the  consequence  of  beginning  to  quantify  the  behavior  of  the 
colony soon after it was established?  

    8.  Behavioral  ecologists  have  argued  that  naked  mole  rats  are 
eusocial. What are the major characteristics of eusociality and 
which of those characteristics are shared by naked mole rats?  

    9.  Choose a problem in the ecology of social relations, formulate a 
hypothesis, and design a study to test your hypothesis. Take two 
approaches.  In  one  approach  use  field  and  laboratory  experi-
ments to test your ideas. In the second design, develop a study 
that will employ the comparative method.

  T  he  distributions  and  dynamics  of  populations  vary

small  and  have  highly  restricted  distributions,  other 
populations  number  in  the  millions  and  may  range  over  vast 
areas of the planet. Standing on a headland in central California 
overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a small class of students spots 
a  group  of  gray  whales,   Eschrichtius  robustus,   rising  to  the

their annual migration, gray whales migrate from subtropical waters off 
Baja California to the Arctic and back again, passing along the coast 
of California as they do so. (b) Along that same coast, monarch but-
terflies,  Danaus   plexippus,  winter in huge numbers, some having flown 
thousands of kilometers from the Rocky Mountains to reach the trees 
where they roost in winter. In contrast, the entire natural population of 
the Monterey pine,  Pinus   radiata,  is restricted to five small areas along 
the California coast.

surface and spouting water as they swim northward ( fig. 9.1  a ). 
The  whales  are  rounding  the  point  of  land  on  their  way  to 
feeding  grounds  off  the  coasts  of  Alaska  and  Siberia.  This 
particular group is made up of females and calves. The calves 
were born during the previous winter along the coast of Baja 
 California, the gray whale’s wintering grounds. Over the course 
of the spring, the entire population of over 20,000 gray whales 
will round this same headland on their way to the Bering and 
 Chukchi seas. Gray whales travel from one end of their range to 
the other twice each year, a distance of about 18,000 km. Home 
to the gray whale encompasses a swath of seacoast extending 
from southern Baja California to the coast of northeast Asia.     

 The  grove  of  pine  trees  on  the  headland  where  the 
 students stand gazing at the whales is winter home to another 
long-distance traveler: monarch butterflies,  Danaus  plexippus  
( fig. 9.1  b ). The lazy flying of the bright orange and black mon-
arch butterflies gives no hint of their capacity to migrate. Some 
of the butterflies flew to the grove of pines the previous autumn

from as far away as the Rocky Mountains of southern Canada. 
As the students watch the whales, the male monarch butterflies 
pursue  and  mate  with  the  female  monarch  butterflies. After 
mating,  the  males  die,  while  the  females  begin  a   migration 
that leads inland and north. The females stop to lay eggs on 
milkweeds they encounter along the way and eventually die; 
however,  their  offspring  continue  the   migration.   Monarch 
caterpillars grow quickly on their diet of milkweed and then 
transform to a pupa or chrysalis. The monarch butterflies that 
emerge from the chrysalises (or  chrysalides) mate and, like the 
previous generation, fly northward and inland. By moving far-
ther  north  and  inland  each  generation,  some  of  the  monarch 
butterflies eventually reach the Rocky Mountains of southern 
Canada,  far  from  where  their  ancestors  fluttered  around  the 
group of students on the pine-covered coastal headland. 

 Then,  as  the  autumn  days  grow  shorter,  the  monarch 
 butterflies begin their long flight back to the coastal grove of 
pines. This autumn generation, which numbers in the  millions, 
flies southwest to its wintering grounds on the coast of central 
and southern California. Some of the monarchs might fly over 
3,000 km. The monarch butterflies that survive the trip to the 
pine grove overwinter, hanging from particular roost trees in 
the thousands. They mate in the following spring and start the 
cycle all over again. 

 Gray whales and monarch butterflies, as different as they 
may appear, lead parallel lives. The Monterey pines,  Pinus radi-
ata,  covering the headland where the monarch butterflies over-
winter and by which the gray whales pass twice each year are 
quite different. The Monterey pine population does not migrate 
each generation and has a highly restricted distribution. The cur-
rent natural range of the Monterey pine is limited to a few sites 
on the coast of central and northern California and to two islands 
off the coast of western Mexico. These scattered populations are 
the remnants of a large, continuous population that extended for 
over 800 km along the  California coast during the cooler cli-
mate of the last glacial period. This history of the Monterey pine 
underscores  a  very  important  fact  about  species  distributions: 
they are highly dynamic, especially over long periods of time. 
 With these three examples, we begin to consider the ecol-
ogy  of  populations.  Ecologists  usually  define  a       population    
as a group of individuals of a single species inhabiting a spe-
cific area. A population of plants or animals might occupy a 
mountaintop, a river basin, a coastal marsh, or an island, all 
areas defined by natural boundaries. Just as often, the popu-
lations studied by biologists occupy artificially defined areas 
such as a country, county, or national park. The areas inhab-
ited by populations range in size from the few cubic centime-
ters occupied by the bacteria in a rotting apple to the millions 
of square kilometers occupied by a population of migratory 
whales. A population studied by ecologists may consist of a 
highly localized group of individuals representing a fraction 
of the total population of a species, or it may consist of all the 
individuals of a species across its entire range. 

 Ecologists  study  populations  for  many  reasons.  Popu-
lation  studies  hold  the  key  to  saving  endangered  species, 
controlling  pest  populations,  and  managing  fish  and  game 
populations. They also offer clues to understanding and con-
trolling disease epidemics. Finally, the greatest environmental

challenge to biological diversity and the integrity of the entire 
biosphere is at its heart a population problem—the growth of 
the human population. 

 All populations share several characteristics. The first is 
their      distribution    .  The distribution of a population includes the 
size, shape, and location of the area it occupies. A population 
also has a characteristic pattern of spacing of the individuals 
within it. It is also characterized by the number of individuals 
within it and their      density    ,  which is the number of individuals 
per unit area. Additional characteristics of  populations—their 
age distributions, birth and death rates, immigration and emi-
gration rates, and rates of growth—are the subject of chapters 
10 and 11. In chapter 9 we focus on two population character-
istics: distribution and      abundance    ,  the total number of indi-
viduals, or biomass, of a species in a specified area.  

   9.1  Distribution Limits 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 9.4  Define niche and distinguish between the fundamen-

tal niche and the realized niche.

 9.5  Compare the perspectives of Grinnell, Elton, and 

Hutchinson on the nature of the niche.

 9.6  Discuss the factors limiting the distributions of plants 

and animals on geographic and local spatial scales.

Environment limits the geographic distribution of species.
A major theme in chapters 5, 6, and 7 is that populations have 
evolved physiological, anatomical, and behavioral character-
istics that compensate for environmental variation. Organisms 
compensate for temporal and spatial variation in the environ-
ment by regulating body temperature and water content and 
by foraging in ways that maintain energy intake at relatively 
high levels. However, there are limits on how much organisms 
can compensate for environmental variation. 

 While there are few environments on earth without life, no 
single species can tolerate the full range of earth’s environments. 
For each species, some environments are too warm, too cold, too 
saline, or unsuitable in other ways. As we saw in chapter 7, organ-
isms take in energy at a limited rate. It appears that at some point, 
the metabolic costs of compensating for environmental variation 
may take up too much of an organism’s energy budget. Partly 
because  of  these  energy  constraints,  the  physical  environment 
places  limits  on  the  distributions  of  populations.  The  environ-
mental limits of a species are related to its      niche    .  The word  niche
has been in use a long time. Its earliest and most basic mean-
ing was that of a recessed place in a wall where one could set 
or display items. For about a century, however, ecologists have 
given a broader meaning to the word. To the ecologist, the niche 
summarizes the environmental factors that influence the growth, 
survival, and reproduction of a species. In other words, a spe-
cies’ niche consists of all the factors necessary for its existence— 
approximately when, where, and how a species makes its living. 
 The  niche  concept  was  developed  independently  by 
Joseph Grinnell (1917, 1924) and Charles Elton (1927), who 
used  the  term   niche   in  slightly  different  ways.  In  his  early 

writings,  Grinnell’s  ideas  of  the  niche  centered  around  the 
influences of the physical environment, while Elton’s earliest 
concept included biological interactions as well as abiotic fac-
tors. However their thinking and emphasis may have differed, 
it is clear that the views of these two researchers had much 
in  common  and  that  our  present  concept  of  the  niche  rests 
squarely on their pioneering work. 

 We can now point to a single paper authored by G.  Evelyn 
Hutchinson (1957) as the agent that crystallized the niche con-
cept. In this seminal paper titled simply “Concluding Remarks,” 
Hutchinson defined the niche as an  n-dimensional hypervolume,
where  n  equals the number of environmental factors important 
to the survival and reproduction by a species. Hutchinson called 
this hypervolume, which specifies the values of the  n  environ-
mental factors permitting a species to survive and reproduce, as 
the       fundamental niche    of the species. The fundamental niche 
defines  the  physical  conditions  under  which  a  species  might 
live, in the absence of interactions with other species. However, 
Hutchinson recognized that interactions such as competition may 
restrict the environments in which a species may live. He referred 
to these more restricted conditions as the      realized niche,  which is 
the actual niche of a species whose distribution is limited by biotic 
interactions such as competition, predation, disease, and parasit-
ism.     In a single word,  niche  captures most of what we discussed 
in section II and now turn to in section III. In this section, we 
consider how environment affects the growth, survival, reproduc-
tion, distribution, and abundance of species, a particularly timely 
topic as we face the ecological consequences of global warming.  

   Kangaroo Distributions and Climate 
 The  Macropodidae  includes  the  kangaroos  and  wallabies, 
which are some of the best known of the Australian animals. 
However, this group of large-footed mammals includes many 
less-familiar  species,  including  rat  kangaroos  and  tree  kan-
garoos.  While  some  species  of  macropods  can  be  found  in 
nearly every part of Australia, no single species ranges across 
the entire continent. All are confined to a limited number of 
climatic zones and biomes. 

 G.  Caughley  and  his  colleagues  (1987)  found  a  close 
relationship between climate and the distributions of the three 
largest kangaroos in Australia ( fig. 9.2 ). The eastern grey kan-
garoo,   Macropus  giganteus,   is  confined  to  the  eastern  third 
of  the  continent.  This  portion  of  Australia  includes  several 
biomes (see chapter 2). Temperate forest grows in the south-
east  and  tropical  forests  in  the  north.  Mountains,  with  their 
varied  climates,  occupy  the  central  part  of  the  eastern  grey 
kangaroo’s range (see figs. 2.13, 2.28, and 2.37). The climatic 
factor that distinguishes these varied biomes is little seasonal 
variation in precipitation or dominance by summer precipita-
tion. The western grey kangaroo,  M. fuliginosus,  lives mainly 
in  the  southern  and  western  regions  of  Australia,  which 
coincides  largely  with  the  distribution  of  the  Mediterranean 
woodland  and  shrubland  biome  in  Australia.  The  climati-
cally  distinctive  feature  of  this  biome  is  a  predominance  of 
winter rainfall (see fig. 2.22). Meanwhile, the red kangaroo, 
M.  rufus,   wanders  the  arid  and  semiarid  interior  of Austra-
lia, areas dominated by savanna and desert (see figs. 2.16 and

2.19). Of the three species of large kangaroos, the red kanga-
roo occupies the hottest and driest areas.     

 The  distributions  of  these  three  large  kangaroo  species 
cover most of Australia. However, as you can see in  figure 9.2 , 
none of these species lives in the northernmost region of Aus-
tralia. Caughley and his colleagues explain that these northern 
areas are probably too hot for the eastern grey kangaroo, too 
wet for the red kangaroo, and too hot in summer and too dry in 
winter for the western grey kangaroo. However, they are also 
careful to point out that these limited distributions may not be 
determined by climate directly. Instead, they suggest that cli-
mate often influences species distributions through factors such 
as  food  production,  water  supply,  and  habitat.  Climate  also 
affects the incidence of parasites, pathogens, and competitors. 
 Regardless  of  how  the  influences  of  climate  are  played 
out, the relationship between climate and the distributions of 
species  can  be  stable  over  long  periods  of  time. The  distri-
butions of the eastern grey, western grey, and red kangaroos 
have been stable for at least a century. In the next example, we 
discuss a species of beetle that appears to have maintained a 
stable association with climate for 10,000 to 100,000 years.  

  A Tiger Beetle of Cold Climates 
 Tiger  beetles  have  entered  our  discussions  several  times.  In 
chapter 5, we saw how one species regulates body temperatures 

 Figure 9.3   A tiger beetle,  Cicindela longilabris,  confined to cool 
environments. Physiological studies conducted on populations indicated 
by yellow dots (data from Schultz, Quinlan, and Hadley 1992).

on hot black beaches in New Zealand. In chapter 6, we com-
pared the water loss rates of tiger beetles from desert grass-
lands and riparian habitats in Arizona. Here, we consider the 
distribution of a tiger beetle that inhabits the cold end of the 
range of environments occupied by tiger beetles. 

 The  tiger  beetle   Cicindela  longilabris   lives  at  higher 
 latitudes and higher elevations than just about any other spe-
cies of tiger beetle in North America. In the north,  C. longi-
labris  is distributed from the Yukon Territory in northwestern 
Canada to the maritime provinces of eastern Canada ( fig. 9.3 ). 
This northern band of beetle populations coincides with the 
distribution of northern temperate forest and boreal forest in 
North America (see figs. 2.28 and 2.31).  C. longilabris  also 
lives as far south as Arizona and New Mexico. However, these 
southern populations are confined to high mountains, where 
 C. longilabris  is associated with montane coniferous forests. 
As we saw in chapter 2, these high mountains have a climate 
similar to that of boreal forest (see fig. 2.38).     

 Ecologists  suggest  that  during  the  last  glacial  period  
C. longilabris  lived far south of its present range limits. Then 
with climatic warming and the retreat of the glaciers, the tiger 
beetles followed their preferred climate northward and up in 
elevation into the mountains of western North America. As a 
consequence, the beetles in the southern part of this species’ 
range live in isolated mountaintop populations. This  hypothesis 
is supported by the fossil records of many beetle species. 

 Intrigued by the distribution and history of  C. longilabris,  
Thomas Schultz, Michael Quinlan, and Neil Hadley (1992) set

out to study the environmental physiology of widely separated 
populations  of  the  species.  Populations   separated  for  many 
thousands  of  years  may  have  been  exposed  to   significantly 
different environmental regimes. If so, natural selection could 
have  produced  significant  physiological  differences  among 
populations.  The  researchers  compared  the  physiological 
characteristics of beetles from populations of  C.  longilabris  
from  Maine,  Wisconsin,  Colorado,  and   northern  Arizona. 
Their  measurements  included  water  loss  rates,  metabolic 
rates, and body temperature preferences. 

 Schultz and his colleagues found that the metabolic rates 
of   C.  longilabris   are  higher  and  its  preferred  temperatures 
lower than those of most other tiger beetle species that have 
been  studied.  These  differences  support  the  hypothesis  that 
 C.  longilabris   is  adapted  to  the  cool  climates  of  boreal  and 
montane forests. In addition, the researchers found that none 
of  their  measurements  differed  significantly  among  popula-
tions of  C. longilabris.   Figure 9.4  illustrates the remarkable 
similarity  in  preferred  body  temperature  shown  by  forag-
ing   C.  longilabris   from  populations  separated  by  as  much 
as 3,000 km and, perhaps, by 10,000 years of history. These 
results  support  the  generalization  that  the  physical  environ-
ment limits the distributions of species. It also suggests that 
those limits may be stable for long periods of time.     

 Now,  let’s  consider  how  the  physical  environment  may 
limit the distribution of plants. Our example is drawn from the 
arid and semiarid regions of the American Southwest.  

  Distributions of Plants Along a 
Moisture-Temperature Gradient 
 In  chapter  5,  we  discussed  the  influence  of  pubescence  on 
leaf  temperature  in  plants  of  the  genus   Encelia.   Variation 
in  leaf  pubescence  among   Encelia   species  appears  to  cor-
respond  directly  to  the  distributions  of  these  species  along 
a   moisture-temperature  gradient  from  the  California  coast 

 eastward  (Ehleringer  and  Clark  1988).   Encelia  californica,  
the species with the least pubescent leaves, occupies a narrow 
coastal  zone  that  extends  from  southern  California  to  north-
ern Baja California ( fig. 9.5 ). Inland,  E. californica  is replaced 
by  E. actoni,  which has leaves that are slightly more pubes-
cent. Still farther to the east,  E. actoni  is in turn replaced by 
 E.  frutescens  and  E. farinosa.      

 These  geographic  limits  to  these  species’  distributions 
correspond  to  variations  in  temperature  and  precipitation. 
The  coastal  environments  where   E.  californica   lives  are  all 
relatively  cool.  However,  average  annual  precipitation  dif-
fers a great deal across the distribution of this species. Annual 
precipitation ranges from about 100 mm in the southern part 

C. longilabris living in 
the northern regions of 
Maine and Wisconsin 
have a preferred body 
temperature of 348C.

This is virtually identical to 
the preferred temperature of 
C. longilabris living in the 
southern Rocky Mountains of 
Colorado and Arizona.

only  slightly  warmer  but  considerably  drier.  The  rainfall  in 
areas occupied by  E. frutescens  and  E. farinosa  is similar to 
the amount that falls in the areas occupied by  E. actoni  and 
 E.  californica.   However,  the  environments  of   E.  frutescens  
and  E. farinosa  are much hotter. 

 Variation in leaf pubescence does not correspond entirely 
to  the  macroclimates  inhabited  by   Encelia   species.  The 
leaves of  E. frutescens  are nearly as free of pubescence as the 
coastal species,  E. californica.  However,  E. frutescens  grows 
side by side with  E. farinosa  in some of the hottest deserts in 
the world. Because they are sparsely pubescent, the leaves of  
E. frutescens  absorb a great deal more radiant energy than 
the  leaves  of   E.  farinosa   ( fig.  9.6 ).  Under  similar  condi-
tions,  however,  leaf  temperatures  of  the  two  species  are 
nearly identical. How does  E. frutescens  avoid overheating? 
The leaves do not overheat because they transpire at a high 
rate and are evaporatively cooled as a consequence.   

 Evaporative  cooling  solves  one  ecological  puzzle  but 
appears to create another. Remember that these two shrubs live 
in some of the hottest and driest deserts in the world. Where 
does   E.  frutescens   get  enough  water  to  evaporatively  cool 
its leaves? Although the distributions of  E. frutescens  and  E. 
farinosa  overlap a great deal on a geographic scale, these two 
species  occupy  distinctive  microenvironments.  As  shown  in 
 figure 9.7 ,  E. farinosa  grows mainly on upland slopes, while 
 E. frutescens  is largely confined to ephemeral stream channels, 
or desert washes. Along washes, runoff infiltrates into the deep 
soils increasing the availability of soil moisture to  E. frutescens.  
This example reminds us of a principle that we first considered 
in chapter 5: organisms living in the same macroclimate may, 
because of slight differences in local distribution, experience 
substantially different microclimates. This is certainly true of 
the two barnacle species we consider in the following example.      

Nonpubescent leaves of 
E. frutescens absorb 
approximately 80% of 
incident photosynthetically 
active radiation.

Pubescent leaves of 
E. farinosa absorb 
less than 40%.

  Distributions of Barnacles Along 
an Intertidal Exposure Gradient 
 The marine intertidal zone presents a steep gradient of physi-
cal conditions from the shore seaward. As we saw in chapter 3, 
the organisms high in the intertidal zone are exposed by vir-
tually every tide while the organisms that live at lower levels 
in  the  intertidal  zone  are  exposed  by  the  lowest  tides  only. 
Exposure  to  air  differs  at  different  levels  within  the  inter-
tidal  zone.  Organisms  that  live  in  the  intertidal  zone  have 
evolved  different  degrees  of  resistance  to  drying,  a  major 
 factor  contributing  to  zonation  among  intertidal  organisms 
(see fig. 3.16). 

Despite low transpiration 
rates, pubescent leaves of 
E. farinosa remain 
relatively cool because 
they are highly reflective.

 Figure 9.9    Barnacle mortality in the upper intertidal zone (data 
from Connell 1961b). 

 Barnacles, one of the most common intertidal organisms, 
show  distinctive  patterns  of  zonation  within  the  intertidal 
zone. For example, Joseph Connell (1961a, 1961b) described 
how along the coast of Scotland, adult  Chthamalus stellatus
are restricted to the upper levels of the intertidal zone, while 
adult  Balanus balanoides  are limited to the middle and lower 
levels ( fig. 9.8 ). What role does resistance to drying play in 
the intertidal zonation of these two species? Unusually calm 
and warm weather combined with very low tides gave  Connell 
some insights into this question. In the spring of 1955, warm 
weather  coincided  with  calm  seas  and  very  low  tides. As  a 
consequence, no water reached the upper intertidal zone occu-
pied by both species of barnacles. During this period,  Balanus
in  the  upper  intertidal  zone  suffered  much  higher  mortality 

than  Chthamalus  ( fig. 9.9 ). Meanwhile,  Balanus  in the lower 
intertidal zone showed normal rates of mortality. Of the two 
species,   Balanus   appears  to  be  more  vulnerable  to  desicca-
tion. Higher rates of desiccation may exclude this species of 
barnacle from the upper intertidal zone.   

 Vulnerability to dessication, however, does not completely 
explain  the  pattern  of  intertidal  zonation  shown  by   Balanus
and  Chthamalus.  What excludes  Chthamalus  from the lower 
intertidal zone? Though the larvae of this barnacle settle in the 
lower intertidal zone, the adults rarely survive there. Connell 
explored this question by transplanting adult  Chthamalus  to 
the  lower  intertidal  zone  and  found  that  transplanted  adults 
survive  in  the  lower  intertidal  zone  very  well.  If  the  physi-
cal environment does not exclude  Chthamalus  from the lower 
intertidal  zone,  what  does?  It  turns  out  that  this  species  is 
excluded from the lower intertidal zone by competitive inter-
actions with  Balanus.  We discuss the mechanisms by which 
this  competitive  exclusion  is  accomplished  in  chapter  13, 
which covers interspecific competition. 

 These barnacles remind us that the environment consists 
of  more  than  just  physical  and  chemical  factors. An  organ-
ism’s environment also includes biological factors. In many 
situations,  biological  factors  may  be  as  important  or  even 
more important than physical factors in determining the niche, 
and therefore, the distribution and abundance of a species. 

 Now that we have considered factors limiting the distribu-
tions of populations, let’s consider the patterns of distribution 
of individuals within their habitat. Let’s begin by considering 
three basic patterns of distribution. 

  Concept 9.1 Review 

      1.   How may a species respond to climate change?  
     2.   How might biological and physical aspects of the envi-
ronment  interact  to  influence  a  species’  geographic 
distribution?       

  9.2  Patterns on Small Scales 
LEARNING OUTCOMES

perspective.

 9.9  Discuss the mechanisms producing changes in distri-

bution, as stands of creosote bush age.

 9.10  Explain how interactions between individuals in 
a population are thought to influence distribution 
 patterns in populations.

   On  small  scales, 
individuals  within  populations  are 
 distributed  in  patterns  that  may  be  random,  regular,  or 
clumped.   We have just considered how the environment lim-
its the distributions of species. When you map the distribution 
of a species such as the red kangaroo in Australia (see  fig. 9.2 ), 
or  the  zoned  distribution  of   Chthamalus   and   Balanus   in  the

intertidal zone (see  fig. 9.8 ), the boundaries on your map indi-
cate the range of the species. In other words, your map shows 
where at least some individuals of the species live and where 
they are absent. Knowing a species’ range, as defined by pres-
ence and absence, is useful, but it says nothing about how the 
individuals that make up the population are distributed in the 
areas where they are present. Are individuals randomly distrib-
uted  across  the  range? Are  they  regularly  distributed? As  we 
shall  see,  the  distribution  pattern  observed  by  an  ecologist  is 
strongly influenced by the scale at which a population is studied.  

   Scale, Distributions, and Mechanisms 
 Ecologists  refer  frequently  to   large-scale  and   small-scale 
 phenomena. What is “large” or “small” depends on the size of 
organism or other ecological phenomenon under study. For this 
discussion,    small scale    refers to small distances over which there 
is little environmental change significant to the organism under 
study.    Large scale    refers to areas over which there is substan-
tial environmental change. In this sense, large scale may refer 
to patterns over an entire continent or patterns along a mountain 
slope, where environmental gradients are steep. Let’s begin our 
discussion with patterns of distribution observed at small scales. 
 Three basic patterns of distribution are observed on small 
scales: random, regular, or clumped. A     random distribution    
is one in which individuals within a population have an equal 
chance of living anywhere within an area. A     regular distri-
bution    is one in which individuals are uniformly spaced. In a 
    clumped distribution    ,  individuals have a much higher prob-
ability of being found in some areas than in others ( fig. 9.10 ).     
 These three basic patterns of distribution are produced by 
the  kinds  of  interactions  that  take  place  between  individuals 
within a population, by the structure of the physical environ-
ment, or by a combination of interactions and environmental 
structure.  Individuals  within  a  population  may   attract   each 
other,   repel   each  other,  or   ignore   each  other.  Mutual  attrac-
tion  creates  clumped,  or  aggregated,  patterns  of  distribution. 

Regular patterns of distribution are produced when individuals 
avoid each other or claim exclusive use of a patch of landscape. 
Neutral responses contribute to random distributions. 

 The  patterns  created  by  social  interactions  may  be  rein-
forced or damped by the structure of the environment. An envi-
ronment  with  patchy  distributions  of  nutrients,  nesting  sites, 
water,  and  so  forth  fosters  clumped  distribution  patterns. An 
environment with a fairly uniform distribution of resources and 
frequent, random patterns of disturbance (or mixing) tends to 
reinforce  random  or  regular  distributions.  Let’s  now  consider 
factors that influence the distributions of some species in nature.  

  Distributions of Tropical Bee Colonies 
 Stephen  Hubbell  and  Leslie  Johnson  (1977)  recorded  a  dra-
matic  example  of  how  social  interactions  can  produce  and 
enforce regular spacing in a population. They studied competi-
tion  and  nest  spacing  in  populations  of  stingless  bees  in  the 
family Trigonidae. The bees they studied live in tropical dry 
forest in Costa Rica. Though these bees do not sting, rival col-
onies of some species fight fiercely over potential nesting sites. 
 Stingless  bees  are  abundant  in  tropical  and  subtropi-
cal environments, where they gather nectar and pollen from 
a  wide  variety  of  flowers.  They  generally  nest  in  trees  and 
live in colonies made up of hundreds to thousands of workers. 
 Hubbell and Johnson observed that some species of stingless 
bees are highly aggressive to other members of their species 
from other colonies, while others are not. Aggressive species 
usually forage in groups and feed mainly on flowers that occur 
in high-density clumps. The nonaggressive species feed singly 
or in small groups and on more widely distributed flowers. 

 Hubbell  and  Johnson  studied  several  species  of  sting-
less bees to determine whether there is a relationship between 
aggressiveness and patterns of colony distribution. They pre-
dicted that the colonies of aggressive species would show reg-
ular distributions while those of nonaggressive species would 
show  random  or  clumped  distributions.  They  concentrated

their studies on a 13 ha tract of tropical dry forest that con-
tained numerous nests of nine species of stingless bees. 

 Though Hubbell and Johnson were interested in how bee 
behavior might affect colony distributions, they recognized that 
the availability of potential nest sites for colonies could also 
affect distributions. So, in one of the first steps in their study, 
they  mapped  the  distributions  of  trees  suitable  for   nesting. 
They found that potential nest trees were distributed randomly 
through the study area and that the number of potential nest 
sites was much greater than the number of bee colonies. 

 Hubbell and Johnson were able to map the nests of five 
of the nine species of stingless bees accurately. The nests of 
four of these species were distributed regularly. As they had 
predicted,  all  four  species  with  regular  nest  distributions 
were  highly  aggressive  to  bees  from  other  colonies  of  their 
own  species.  The  fifth  species,   Trigona  dorsalis,   was  not 
aggressive  and  its  nests  were  randomly  distributed  over  the 
study  area.   Figure  9.11   contrasts  the  random  distribution  of  
T.  dorsalis  with the regular distribution of one of the aggres-
sive species,  T. fulviventris.      

 The  researchers  also  studied  the  process  by  which  the 
aggressive  species  establish  new  colonies.  In  the  process, 
they made observations that provide insights into the mecha-
nisms that establish and maintain the regular nest distributions 
of  species  such  as   T.  fulviventris.  This  species  and  the  other 
aggressive species apparently mark prospective nest sites with 
a pheromone.     Pheromones    are chemical substances secreted 
by  some  animals  for  communication  with  other  members  of 
their species. The pheromone secreted by these stingless bees 
attracts and aggregates members of their colony to the prospec-
tive nest site; however, it also attracts workers from other nests. 
 If workers from two different colonies arrive at the pro-
spective  nest,  they  may  fight  for  possession.  Fights  may  be 
escalated into protracted battles. Hubbell and Johnson observed 

Colonies of the stingless bee, 
Trigona fulviventris, which 
interact aggressively, are 
distributed regularly across 
this tract of forest.

The less interactive stingless 
bee, T. dorsalis, is distributed 
randomly across the same 
tract of forest.

battles over a nest tree that lasted for 2 weeks. Each dawn, 15 
to 30 workers from two rival colonies arrived at the contested 
nest  site.  The  workers  from  the  two  rival  colonies  faced  off 
in  two  swarms  and  displayed  and  fought  with  each  other.  In 
the displays, pairs of bees faced each other, slowly flew verti-
cally to a height of about 3 m, and then grappled each other 
to the ground. When the two bees hit the ground, they sepa-
rated, faced off, and performed another aerial display. Bees did 
not appear to be injured in these fights, which were apparently 
ritualized. The two swarms abandoned the battle at about 8 or 
9  a.m.  each morning, only to re-form and begin again the next 
day just after dawn. While this contest over an unoccupied nest 
site produced no obvious mortality, fights over occupied nests 
sometimes killed over 1,000 bees in a single battle. These trop-
ical bees space their colonies by engaging in pitched battles. 
As we see next, plants space themselves by more subtle means.  

  Distributions of Desert Shrubs 
 Half  a  century  ago,  desert  ecologists  suggested  that  desert 
shrubs tend to be regularly spaced due to competition between 
the shrubs. You can see the patterns that inspired these early 
ecologists by traveling across the seemingly endless expanses 
of the Mojave Desert in western North America. One of the 
most common plants you will see is the creosote bush,  Larrea 
tridentata,   which  dominates  thousands  of  square  kilometers 
of this area. As you look out across landscapes dominated by 
creosote bushes, it may appear that the spacing of these shrubs 
is regular ( fig. 9.12 ). In places, their spacing is so uniform they 
appear to have been planted by some very careful gardener. As 
we shall see, however, visual impressions can be deceiving.   

 Quantitative  sampling  and  statistical  analysis  of  the  dis-
tributions of creosote bushes and other desert shrubs led to a 
controversy that took the better part of two decades to settle. In

(data from Hubbell and Johnson 1977).

 Figure 9.12    Observing the distribution of individuals in local 
populations of creosote bush,  Larrea   tridentata,  ecologists suggested 
that their spacing is regular. Notice on the left side of this photo how 
the spacing of creosote bushes in the distance suggest that they have 
been planted in regularly spaced rows. This view is similar to what 
you would see if you looked between two rows of trees in a fruit 
orchard.

short, when different teams of researchers quantified the distri-
butions of desert shrubs, some found the regular distributions 
reported by earlier ecologists. Others found  random or clumped 
distributions. Still others reported all three types of distributions. 
 Though  we  are  generally  accustomed  to  having  one 
answer to our questions, the answers to ecological questions 
are  often  more  complex.  Research  by  Donald  Phillips  and 
James MacMahon (1981) showed that the distribution of creo-
sote bushes changes as they grow. They mapped and analyzed 
the distributions of creosote bushes and several other shrubs at 
nine sites in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts. Because earlier 
researchers had suggested that creosote bush spacing changed 
with available moisture, they chose sites with different aver-
age precipitations. Precipitation at the study sites ranged from 
80 to 220 mm, and average July temperature varied from 27 8  
to 35 8 C. Phillips and MacMahon took care to pick sites with 
similar soils and with similar topography. They studied popu-
lations growing on sandy to sandy loam soils with less than 
2% slope with no obvious surface runoff channels. 

 The results of this study indicate that the distribution of 
desert  shrubs  changes  from  clumped  to  random  to  regular 
distribution patterns as they grow. The young shrubs tend to 
be clumped for three reasons: (1) because seeds germinate at 
a  limited  number  of  “safe  sites,”  (2)  because  seeds  are  not 
dispersed far from the parent plant, or (3) because asexually 
produced offspring are necessarily close to the parent plant. 
Phillips  and  MacMahon  proposed  that  as  the  plants  grow, 
some individuals in the clumps die, which reduces the degree 
of  clumping.  Gradually,  the  distribution  of  shrubs  becomes 
more  and  more  random.  However,  competition  among  the 
remaining  plants  produces  higher  mortality  among  plants 
with nearby neighbors, which thins the stand of shrubs still 
further and eventually creates a regular distribution of shrubs. 
This hypothetical process is summarized in  figure 9.13 .     

 Phillips and MacMahon and other ecologists proposed that 
desert shrubs compete for water and nutrients, a competition 

that takes place belowground. How can we study these below-
ground  interactions?  Work  by  Jacques  Brisson  and  James 
Reynolds (1994) provides a quantitative picture of the below-
ground side of creosote bush distributions. These researchers 
carefully excavated and mapped the distributions of 32 creo-
sote bushes in the Chihuahuan Desert. They proposed that if 
creosote bushes compete, their roots should grow in a way that 
reduces overlap with the roots of nearby individuals. 

 The 32 excavated creosote bushes occupied a 4 m by 5 m 
area on the Jornada Long Term Ecological Research site near 
Las Cruces, New Mexico. Creosote bush was the only shrub 
within  the  study  plot.  Their  roots  penetrated  to  only  30  to 
50 cm, the depth of a hardpan calcium carbonate deposition 
layer. Because they did not have to excavate to great depths, 
Brisson  and  Reynolds  were  able  to  map  more  root  systems 
than previous researchers. Still, their excavation and mapping 
of roots required 2 months of intense labor. 

 The complex pattern of root distributions uncovered con-
firmed the researchers’ hypothesis: Creosote bush roots grow 
in  a  pattern  that  reduces  overlap  between  the  roots  of  adja-
cent plants ( fig. 9.14 ). Notice that the root systems of creo-
sote  bushes  overlap  much  less  than  they  would  if  they  had 
circular  distributions.  Brisson  and  Reynolds  concluded  that 
competitive  interactions  with  neighboring  shrubs  influence 
the  distribution  of  creosote  bush  roots. Their  work  suggests 
that creosote bushes compete for belowground resources.   

 After more than two decades of work on this single spe-
cies of plant, desert ecologists have a much clearer understand-
ing of the factors that influence the distribution of individuals 
on a small scale. On small scales, the creosote bush may have 
clumped, random, or regular distributions. Hubbell and John-
son (1977) showed that stingless bee colonies may also show 
different  patterns  of  distribution,  depending  on  the  level  of 
aggression between colonies. As we shall see in the following 
section, however, on larger scales, individuals have clumped 
distributions.

  Concept 9.2 Review 

1.   Are  the  concepts  of  “small”  versus  “large”  scale  the 

same for all organisms?  

2.   How could you test the hypothesis that low overlap in 
root systems in creosote bush populations (see  fig. 9.14 ) 
is the result of ongoing competition?  

3.   In the study of the distribution of stingless bee colonies 
(see pp. 205–206), why were measurements of the num-
ber and distribution of potential nest trees necessary?

 9.12  Explain the clumped distributions of trees along 

moisture gradients in terms of niches (Concept 9.1).

On  large  scales,  individuals  within  a  population  are 
clumped.   We  have  considered  how  individuals  within  a 
population are distributed on a small scale: how bee colonies 
are distributed within a few acres of forest and how shrubs are 
distributed within a small stand. Now let’s step back and ask 
how individuals within a population are distributed on a larger 
scale over which there is significant environmental variation. 
For instance, how does the density of individuals vary across 
the entire range of a species? Is population density fairly regu-
larly distributed across the entire area occupied by a species, 
or are there a few centers of high density surrounded by areas 
in which the species is present but only in low densities?  

   Bird Populations Across North America 
 Terry  Root  (1988)  mapped  patterns  of  bird  abundance  across 
North America using the “Christmas Bird Counts.” These bird 
counts provide one of the few data sets extensive enough to study 
distribution patterns across an entire continent. Christmas Bird 
Counts, which began in 1900, involve annual counts of birds dur-
ing the Christmas season. The first Christmas Bird Count was 
attended by 27 observers, who counted birds in 26 localities—2 
in Canada and the remainder in 13 states of the United States. 
In the 1985–86 season, 38,346 people participated in the Christ-
mas Bird Count. The observers counted birds in 1,504 localities 
throughout the United States and most of Canada. The Christmas 
Bird Count marked its centennial anniversary in the year 2000. It 
continues to produce a unique record of the distribution and pop-
ulation densities of wintering birds across most of a continent.       

 Root’s analysis centers around a series of maps that show 
patterns of distribution and population density for 346 species 
of birds that winter in the United States and Canada. Although 
species as different as swans and sparrows are included, the 
maps show a consistent pattern. At the continental scale, bird 
populations  show  clumped  distributions.  Clumped  patterns 
occur  in  species  with  widespread  distributions,  such  as  the 
American crow,  Corvus brachyrhynchos,  as well as in species 
with  restricted  distributions,  such  as  the  fish  crow,   C.  ossi-
fragus.  Though the winter distribution of the American crow 
includes most of the continent, the bulk of individuals in this 
population are concentrated in a few areas. These areas of high 
density, or “hot spots,” appear as red patches in  figure 9.15  a.
For the American crow population, hot spots are concentrated 
along  river  valleys,  especially  the  Cumberland,  Mississippi, 
Arkansas, Snake, and Rio Grande. Away from these hot spots 
the winter abundance of American crows diminishes rapidly.   
 The fish crow population, though much more restricted 
than that of the American crow, is also concentrated in a few

variance in density correspond to random, regular, 
and clumped distributions.

 9.14  Given a table of values, calculate density variance 
to mean ratios and interpret their meaning in terms 
of distribution patterns.

 Imagine  sampling  a  population  of  plants  or  animals  to 
 determine  the  distribution  of  individuals  across  the  habitat. 
One of the most basic questions that you could ask is, “How 
are individuals in the population distributed across the study 
area?” How might they be distributed? The three basic patterns 
that we’ve discussed in this section are clumped, random, and 
regular distributions. The first step toward testing statistically 
between these three types of distributions is to sample the pop-
ulation to estimate the mean (p. 18) and  variance (pp. 88–89) 
in density of the population across the study area. The theoreti-
cal relationships between variance in density and mean density 
in clumped, random, and regular distributions are as follows:

Distributions

Relation of variance to mean

Clumped
Random
Regular

Variance > Mean, or Variance/Mean > 1
Variance 5 Mean, or Variance/Mean 5 1
Variance < Mean, or Variance/Mean < 1

 How do we connect these relationships between variance and 
mean density with what we see on the ground? In a clumped 
distribution, many sample plots will contain few or no indi-
viduals while some will contain a large number. As a conse-
quence, the variance among sample plots will be high and the 
variance in density will be greater than the mean. In contrast, 
sample plots of a population with a regular distribution will all 
include a similar number of individuals. As a result, the vari-
ance in density across samples will be low when taken from a 
population with a regular distribution; therefore, the variance 
will be less than the mean. Meanwhile, in a randomly distrib-
uted population, the variance in density across the habitat will 
be approximately equal to the mean density. 

 Consider the following samples of three different popu-
lations of herbaceous plants growing on a desert landscape. 
Each  sample  is  the  number  counted  in  a  randomly  located 
1 m 2  area at the study site.

 The distribution of individuals among the samples of species 
A, B, and C is quite different. For instance, each of the samples 
contained  approximately  the  same  number  of   individuals  of 
species B. In contrast, the numbers of species C varied widely 
among samples. Meanwhile, counts of species A showed a level 
of variation somewhere in between variations in  species B and 
C. The samples of species A, B, and C may give the impression 
of random, regular, and clumped distributions. We can quan-
tify  our  visual  impressions  by  calculating  the  sample  means 
and sample variances for the densities of species A, B, and C:

that they do, in science we need to attach probabilities to such 
conclusions. To do that, we need to consider these samples of 
species A, B, and C from a statistical perspective. We will look 
at the statistics of these samples in chapter 10 (see p. 236).

areas ( fig. 9.15  b ). Fish crows are restricted to areas of open 
water near the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and along the south-
ern half of the Atlantic coast of the United States. Within this 
restricted  range,  however,  most  fish  crows  are  concentrated 
in a few hot spots—one on the Mississippi Delta, another on 
Lake Seminole west of Tallahassee, Florida, and a third in the 
everglades of southern Florida. Like the more widely distrib-
uted American crow, the abundance of fish crows diminishes 
rapidly away from these centers of high density. 

 Might bird populations have clumped distributions only on 
the wintering grounds? James H. Brown, David  Mehlman, and 
George Stevens (1995) analyzed large-scale patterns of abun-
dance among birds across North America during the breeding 
season, the opposite season from that studied by Root. In their 
study these researchers used data from the Breeding Bird Sur-
vey,  which  consists  of  standardized  counts  by  amateur  orni-
thologists  conducted  each  June  at  approximately  2,000  sites 
across  the  United  States  and  Canada  under  the  supervision 
of  the  Fish  and  Wildlife  Services  of  the  United  States  and

Canada. For their analyses, they chose species of birds whose 
geographic ranges fall mainly or completely within the eastern 
and central regions of the United States, which are well cov-
ered by study sites of the Breeding Bird Survey. 

 Like Root, Brown and his colleagues found that a  relatively 
small proportion of study sites yielded most of the records of 
each bird species. That is, most individuals were concentrated 
in a fairly small number of hot spots. For instance, the den-
sities  of  red-eyed  vireos  are  low  in  most  places  ( fig.  9.16 ). 
Clumped distributions were documented repeatedly. When the 
numbers of birds across their ranges were totaled, generally 
about  25%  of  the  locations  sampled  supported  over  half  of 
each population. By combining the results of Root and Brown 
and  his  colleagues,  we  can  say  confidently  that  at  larger 
scales, bird populations in North America show clumped pat-
terns of distribution. In other words, most individuals within 
a bird species live in a few hot spots, areas of unusually high 
population density.     

 Brown and his colleagues propose that these distributions 
are clumped because the environment varies and individuals 
aggregate in areas where the environment is favorable. What 
might be the patterns of distribution for populations distrib-
uted along a known environmental gradient? Studies of plant 
populations provide interesting insights.  

  Plant Distributions Along Moisture Gradients 
 Decades ago, Robert Whittaker gathered information on the 
distributions  of  woody  plants  along  moisture  gradients  in 
several mountain ranges across North America. As we saw in 
chapter 2 (see fig. 2.38) environmental conditions on moun-
tainsides  change  substantially  with  elevation.  These  steep 
environmental gradients provide a compressed analog of the 
continental-scale gradients to which the birds studied by Root 
and Brown and his colleagues were presumably responding. 

 

Chapter 9 

  Population Distribution and Abundance 

211

 Let’s look at the distributions of some tree species along 
moisture gradients in two of the mountain ranges studied by 
Whittaker.  Robert  Whittaker  and  William  Niering  (1965) 
 studied  the  distribution  of  plants  along  moisture  and  eleva-
tion  gradients  in  the  Santa  Catalina  Mountains  of  southern 
Arizona. These mountains rise out of the Sonoran Desert near 
Tucson, Arizona, like a green island in a tan desert sea. Veg-
etation typical of the Sonoran Desert, including the saguaro 
cactus and creosote bush, grow in the surrounding desert and 
on the lower slopes of the mountains. However, the summit 
of the mountains is topped by a mixed conifer forest. Forests 
also extend down the flanks of the Santa Catalinas in moist, 
shady canyons. 

 There  is  a  moisture  gradient  from  the  moist  canyon 
 bottoms  up  the  dry  southwest-facing  slopes.  Whittaker  and 
Niering  found  that  along  this  gradient  the  Mexican  pin-
yon  pine,   Pinus  cembroides,   is  at  its  peak  abundance  on 
the   uppermost  and  driest  part  of  the  southwest-facing  slope 
( fig. 9.17 ). Along the same slope, Arizona madrone,  Arbutus 
arizonica,   reaches  its  peak  abundance  at  middle  elevations. 
Finally,  Douglas  firs,   Pseudotsuga  menziesii,   are  restricted 
to the moist canyon bottom. Mexican pinyon pines, Arizona 
madrone, and Douglas fir are all clumped along this  moisture 
gradient,  but  each  reaches  peak  abundance  at  different 
 positions  on  the  slope. These  positions  appear  to  reflect  the 
different environmental requirements of each species.   

 Whittaker  (1956)  recorded  analogous  tree  distributions 
along moisture gradients in the Great Smoky Mountains of east-
ern North America. Again, the gradient was from a moist valley 
bottom to a drier southwest-facing slope. Along this moisture 
gradient, hemlock,  Tsuga canadensis,  was concentrated in the 
moist valley bottom and its density decreased  rapidly upslope 
( fig. 9.18 ). Meanwhile red maple,  Acer rubrum,  grew at high-
est  densities  in  the  middle  section  of  the  slope,  while  table

mountain pine,  Pinus pungens,  was concentrated on the driest 
upper sections. As in the Santa Catalina Mountains of Arizona, 
these tree distributions in the Great Smoky Mountains reflect 
the moisture requirements of each tree species.   

 The distribution of trees along moisture gradients seems 
to  resemble  the  clumped  distributional  patterns  of  birds 
across the North American continent but on a smaller scale. 
All  species of trees discussed here showed a highly clumped 
distribution  along  moisture  gradients,  and  their  densities 
decreased substantially toward the edges of their distributions. 
In other words, like birds, tree populations are concentrated 
in hot spots. As we shall see in the next Concept, population 
density is influenced by organism size.

  9.4   Organism Size 

and Population Density 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 9.15  Draw a scatter plot of the general relationship 
between organism size and population density.
 9.16  Describe differences among animal groups, for 
example, mammals versus aquatic invertebrates, 
in their relationships between size and population 
density.

Population  density  declines  with  increasing  organism 
size.  
If you estimate the densities of organisms in their natu-
ral environments, you will find great ranges. While bacterial 
populations in soils or water can exceed 10 9  per cubic centi-
meter and phytoplankton densities often exceed 10 6  per cubic 
meter, populations of large mammals and birds can average 
considerably  less  than  one  individual  per  square  kilometer. 
What  factors  produce  this  variation  in  population  density? 
The densities of a wide variety of organisms are highly corre-
lated with body size. In general, densities of animal and plant 
populations decrease with increasing size. 

 While  it  makes  common  sense  that  small  animals  and 
plants generally live at higher population densities than larger 
ones,  quantifying  the  relationship  between  body  size  and 
population density provides valuable information. First, quan-
tification  translates  a  general  qualitative  notion  into  a  more 
precise quantitative relationship. For example, you might want 
to know how much population density declines with increased 
body size. Second, measuring the relationship between body 
size  and  population  density  for  a  wide  variety  of  species 
reveals  different  relationships  for  different  groups  of  organ-
isms. Differences in the relationship between size and popula-
tion density can be seen among major groups of animals.  

   Animal Size and Population Density 
 John Damuth (1981) produced one of the first clear demon-
strations of the relationship between body size and population 
density.  He  focused  his  analysis  on  herbivorous  mammals. 
The  size  of  herbivorous  mammals  included  in  the  analysis 
ranged from small rodents, with a mass of about 10 g, to large 
herbivores such as rhinoceros, with a mass well over 10 6  g. 
Meanwhile, average population density ranged from about 1 
individual (10  2 1 ) per 10 km 2  to about 10,000 (10 4 ) per 1 km 2 , 
which  spans  approximately  five  “orders  of  magnitude,”  or 
powers  of  10,  in  population  density. As   figure  9.19   shows, 
Damuth found that the population density of 307 species of 
herbivorous  mammals  decreases,  from  species  to  species, 
with increased body size. The regression line (p. 188) in the 
graph shows the average decrease in population density with 
increased body size.     

 Building on Damuth’s analysis, Robert Peters and Karen 
Wassenberg  (1983)  explored  the  relationship  between  body 
size  and  average  population  density  for  a  wider  variety  of 

Average population density of 
herbivorous mammals decreases

animals.  Their  analysis  included  terrestrial  invertebrates, 
aquatic  invertebrates,  mammals,  birds,  and  poikilothermic 
vertebrates. They included animals representing a great range 
in  size  and  population  density.  Animal  mass  ranged  from 
10 2 11  to about 10 2.3  kg, while population density ranged from 
less  than  1  per  square  kilometer  to  nearly  10 12   per  square 
kilo-meter. When Peters and Wassenberg plotted animal mass 
against average density, they, like Damuth, found that popula-
tion density decreased with increased body size. 

 If you look closely at the data in  figure 9.20 , however, it 
is clear that there are differences among the animal groups. 
First, aquatic invertebrates of a given body size tend to have 
higher population densities, usually one or two orders of mag-
nitude  higher,  than  terrestrial  invertebrates  of  similar  size. 
Second,  mammals  tend  to  have  higher  population  densities 
than birds of similar size. Peters and Wassenberg suggest that 
it  may  be  appropriate  to  analyze  aquatic  invertebrates  and 
birds separately from the other groups of animals.     

 The general relationship between animal size and popula-
tion density has held up under careful scrutiny and reanalysis. 
Plant  ecologists  have  found  a  qualitatively  similar  relation-
ship in plant populations, as we see next.  

  Plant Size and Population Density 
 James  White  (1985)  pointed  out  that  plant  ecologists  have 
been studying the relationship between plant size and popu-
lation  density  since  early  in  the  twentieth  century.  He  sug-
gests that the relationship between size and density is one of 
the  most  fundamental  aspects  of  population  biology.  White 
summarized  the  relationship  between  size  and  density  for  a 
large number of plant species spanning a wide range of plant 
growth forms ( fig. 9.21 ).     

 The pattern in  figure 9.21  illustrates that as in animals, 
plant population density decreases with increasing plant size.

 Figure 9.21   Plant size and population density (data from 
White 1985).

However,  the  biological  details  underlying  the  size-density 
relationship  shown  by  plants  are  quite  different  from  those 
underlying  the  size-density  patterns  shown  by  animals. The 
different  points  in   figures  9.19   and   9.20   represent  different 
species of animals. A single species of tree, however, can span 
a very large range of sizes and densities during its life cycle. 
Even  the  largest  trees,  such  as  the  giant  sequoia,   Sequoia 
gigantea,   start  life  as  small  seedlings.  These  tiny  seedlings 

can  live  at  very  high  densities.  As  the  trees  grow,  density 
declines progressively until the mature trees live at low den-
sities. We discuss this process, which is called  self-thinning,  
in  chapter  13.  Thus,  the  size-density  relationship  changes 
dynamically within plant populations and differs significantly 
between  populations  of  plants  that  reach  different  sizes  at 
maturity. Despite differences in the underlying processes, the 
data summarized in  figure 9.21  indicate a predictable relation-
ship between plant size and population density. 

 The  value  of  such  an  empirical  relationship,  whether 
for  plants  or  animals,  is  that  it  provides  a  standard  against 
which we can compare measured densities and gives an idea 
of expected population densities in nature. For example, sup-
pose  you  go  out  into  the  field  and  measure  the  population 
density  of  some  species  of  animal.  How  would  you  know 
if  the  densities  you  encounter  were  unusually  high,  low,  or 
about average for an animal of the particular size and taxon? 
Without  an  empirical  relationship  such  as  that  shown  in 
  figures 9.20  and  9.21  or a list of species densities, it would be 
impossible to make such an assessment. One question that we 
might attempt to answer with a population study is whether a 
species is rare. As we shall see in the following Applications 
section, rarity is a more complex consideration than it might 
seem at face value. 

  Concept 9.4 Review

herbivorous  mammals  in  his  analysis  of  the  relation-
ship  between  body  size  and  population  density  (see 
 fig. 9.19 )?  

     2.   How  might  energy  and  nutrient  relations  explain 
the  lower  population  densities  of  birds  compared  to 
 comparable-sized mammals (see  fig. 9.20 )?

 Rarity and Vulnerability to Extinction    

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 9.17  List the seven forms of rarity described by 

Rabinowitz. 

 9.18  Detail five examples of organisms showing each 

form of rarity described by Rabinowitz.

 9.19  Explain the relationship between the forms of rarity 

and the vulnerability of species to extinction.

 Viewed  on  a  long-term,  geological  timescale,   populations 
come and go and extinction seems to be the inevitable punc-
tuation mark at the end of a species’ history. However, some 
populations  seem  to  be  more  vulnerable  to  extinction  than 
others.  What  makes  some  populations  likely  to  disappear, 
while others persist through geological ages? At the heart of 
the  matter  are  patterns  of  distribution  and  abundance.  Rare 
species are often vulnerable to extinction, whereas abundant 
species  are  seldom  so.  In  order  to  understand  and,  perhaps, 
prevent extinction, we need to understand the various forms 
of rarity, especially in this time of rapid climate change.  

  Seven Forms of Rarity and One of Abundance 
 Deborah  Rabinowitz  (1981)  devised  a  classification  of   com-
monness   and   rarity,   based  on  combinations  of  three  fac-
tors:  (1)  the  geographic  range  of  a  species  ( extensive   versus 
restricted  ),  (2)  habitat  tolerance  ( broad   versus   narrow ),  and 
(3) local population size ( large  versus  small ). Habitat tolerance 
is related to the range of conditions in which a  species can live. 
For instance, some plant species can tolerate a broad range of 
soil  texture,  pH,  and  organic  matter  content,  whereas  other 
plant  species  are  confined  to  a  single  soil  type. As  we  shall 
see,  tigers  have  broad  habitat  tolerance;  however,  within  the 
tiger’s historical range in Asia lives the snow leopard, which is 
confined to a narrow range of conditions in the high  mountains 
of the Tibetan Plateau. Small geographic range, narrow habitat 
tolerance, and low population density are attributes of rarity. 
 As shown in  figure 9.22 , there are eight possible combi-
nations of these factors, seven of which include at least one 
attribute of rarity. The most abundant species and those least 
threatened  by  extinction  have  extensive  geographic  ranges, 
broad habitat tolerances, and large local populations at least 
somewhere  within  their  range.  Some  of  these   species,  such 
as starlings, Norway rats, and house sparrows, are associated 
with humans and are considered pests. However, many  species 
of  small  mammals,  birds,  and  invertebrates  not   associated 
with  humans,  such  as  the  deer  mouse,   Peromyscus  manicu-
latus,  or the marine zooplankton,  Calanus finmarchicus,  also 
fall into this most common category.     

 Ecologists exploring the relationship between size of geo-
graphic  range  and  population  size  have  found  that  they  are 

not independent. Instead, there is a strong positive correlation 
between the two variables for most groups of organisms. In other 
words, species abundant in the places where they occur are gen-
erally widely distributed within a region, continent, or ocean, 
while species living at low population densities  generally have 
small, restricted distributions. The positive relationship between 
range  and  population  density  was  first  brought  to  the  atten-
tion of ecologists by Ilka Hanski (Hanski 1982) and James H. 
Brown (Brown 1984). Kevin Gaston (Gaston 1996; Gaston et 
al. 2000) points out that in the two decades since the early work 
by Hanski and Brown, ecologists have found a positive relation-
ship  between  range  and  population  density  for  many  groups, 
including plants, grasshoppers, scale insects, hoverflies, bum-
blebees, moths, beetles, butterflies, birds, frogs, and mammals. 
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the positive 
relationship between local abundance and range size. Many of 
the explanations focus on breadth of environmental tolerances 
and  differences  in  population  dynamics.  However,  as  Gaston 
and his colleagues point out (Gaston et al. 2000), there is still 
no consensus on the most likely explanations. 

 Most  species  are  uncommon;  seven  combinations  of 
range,  tolerance,  and  population  size  each  create  a  kind  of 
 rarity. As a consequence, Rabinowitz referred to “seven forms 
of rarity.” Let’s look at species that represent the two extremes 
of  Rabinowitz’s  seven  forms  of  rarity. The  first  two  discus-
sions concern species that are rare according to only one attri-
bute. These are species that, before they become extinct, may 
seem fairly secure. The final discussion concerns the very rar-
est species, which show all three attributes of rarity. Though 
these rarest species are the most vulnerable to extinction, rar-
ity in any form appears to increase vulnerability to extinction. 

  Rarity I: Extensive Range, Broad Habitat 
Tolerance, Small Local Populations 
 It is easy to understand how people were drawn to the  original 
practice  of  falconry.  The  sight  and  sound  of  a  peregrine 
 falcon,  Falco peregrinus,  in full dive at over 200 km per hour 
must  have  been  one  of  the  great  experiences  of  a  lifetime 
( fig. 9.23 ). The peregrine, which has a geographic range that 
circles the Northern Hemisphere and broad habitat tolerance, 
is uncommon throughout its range. Apparently, this one attri-
bute  of  rarity  was  enough  to  make  the  peregrine  vulnerable 
to  extinction.  The  falcon’s  feeding  on  prey  containing  high 
concentrations  of  DDT,  which  produced  thin  eggshells  and 
nesting failure, was enough to drive the peregrine to the brink 
of extinction. Peregrine falcons were saved from extinction by 
control of the use of DDT, strict regulation of the capture of 
the birds, captive breeding, and reintroduction of the birds to 
areas where local populations had become extinct.     

 The  range  of  the  tiger,   Panthera  tigris,   once  extended 
from Turkey to eastern Siberia, Java, and Bali and included 
environments  ranging  from  boreal  forest  to  tropical  rain 
 forest. The tigers in this far-flung population varied enough 
from  place  to  place  in  size  and  coloration  that  many  local 
populations  were  described  as  separate  subspecies,  includ-
ing the Siberian, Bengal, and Javanese tigers. Like peregrine 
falcons, tigers had an extensive geographic range and broad

habitat  tolerance  but  low  population  density.  Over  the  cen-
turies, relentless pursuit by hunters reduced the tiger’s range 
from nearly half of the largest continent on earth to a series 
of  tiny,  fragmented  populations.  Many  local  populations 
have  become  extinct  and  others,  such  as  the  magnificent 
Siberian  tiger,  teeter  on  the  verge  of  extinction  in  the  wild. 
These   populations  may  survive  only  through  captive  breed-
ing   programs  in  zoos. The  next  example  shows  that  narrow 
 habitat tolerance can also lead to extinction.  

  Rarity II: Extensive Range, Large 
Populations, Narrow Habitat Tolerance 
 When Europeans arrived in North America, they encountered 
one of the most numerous birds on earth, the passenger pigeon. 
The range of the passenger pigeon extended from the eastern 
shores of the present-day United States to the Midwest, and

throughout the Northern Hemisphere but lives at low population 
 densities throughout its range.

  Population Ecology

its population size numbered in the billions. However, the bird 
had one attribute of rarity: It had a narrow requirement for its 
nesting sites. The passenger pigeon nested in huge aggrega-
tions  in  virgin  forests. As  virgin  forests  were  cut,  its  range 
diminished  and  market  hunters  easily  located  and  exploited 
its remaining nesting sites, finishing off the remainder of the 
population. By 1914, when the last passenger pigeon died in 
captivity, one of the formerly most numerous bird species on 
earth was extinct. Extensive range and high population den-
sity alone, do not guarantee immunity from extinction. 

 The rivers in the same region inhabited by the passenger 
pigeon harbored an abundant, widely distributed but narrowly 
tolerant  fish,  the  harelip  sucker,   Lagochila  lacera.  This  fish 
was found in streams across most of the east-central United 
States and was abundant enough that early ichthyologists cited 
it as one of the most common and most valuable food fishes 
in the region. However, the harelip sucker, like the passenger 
pigeon, had narrow habitat requirements. It was restricted to 
large pools with rocky bottoms in clear, medium-size streams 
about 15 to 30 m wide. This habitat was eliminated by the silt-
ing of rivers that followed deforestation and by the erosion of 
poorly managed agricultural lands. The last individuals of this 
species  collected  by  ichthyologists  came  from  the  Maumee 
River in northwestern Ohio in 1893.  

  Extreme Rarity: Restricted Range, Narrow 
Habitat Tolerance, Small Populations 
 Species  that  combine  small  geographic  ranges  with   narrow 
habitat tolerances and low population densities are the rarest 
of the rare. This group includes species such as the mountain 
gorilla,  the  giant  panda,  and  the  California  condor.   Species 
showing  this  extreme  form  of  rarity  are  clearly  the  most 
 vulnerable to extinction. Many island species have these attri-
butes, so it is not surprising that island species are especially 

   Summary 

vulnerable.  Of  the  171  bird  species  and  subspecies  known 
to  have  become  extinct  since  1600,  155  species  have  been 
restricted to islands. Of the 70 species and subspecies of birds 
known  to  have  lived  on  the  Hawaiian  Islands,  24  are  now 
extinct and 30 are considered in danger of extinction. 

 Organisms on continents that are restricted to small areas, 
have  narrow  habitat  tolerance,  and  small   population  size 
are  also  vulnerable  to  extinction.  Examples  of   populations 
in  such  circumstances  are  common.  More  than  20   species 
of  plants  and  animals  are  confined  to  about  200  km 2   of 
mixed  wetlands  and  upland  desert  in   California  called 
Ash   Meadows.  The  Ash  Meadows  stick-leaf,    Mentzelia 
 leucophylla,  inhabits an area of about 2.5 km 2  and has a total 
population size of fewer than 100 individuals. Another plant, 
the Ash Meadows milk vetch,  Astragalus phoenix,  has a total 
population of fewer than 600 individuals. Human  alteration 
of Ash  Meadows  appears  to  have  caused  the  extinction  of 
at  least  one  native  species,  the  Ash  Meadows  killifish, 
  Empetrichthys merriami.  

 Amazingly,  there  are  species  with  ranges  even  more 
restricted  than  those  of Ash  Meadows,  California.  In  1980, 
the  total  population  of  the Virginia  round-leaf  birch,    Betula 
uber,  was limited to 20 individuals in Smyth County,  Virginia. 
Until  recently  the  total  habitat  of  the  Socorro  isopod, 
  Thermo-sphaeroma thermophilum,  of Socorro, New Mexico, 
was limited to a spring pool and outflow with a surface area of 
a few square meters. Meanwhile, a palm species,   Pritchardia 
monroi,   which  is  found  only  on  the  island  of  Maui  in  the 
Hawaiian Islands, has a total population in nature of exactly 
one individual! 

 Examples  such  as  these  fill  books  listing  endangered 
species. In nearly all cases, the key to a species’ survival is 
increased distribution and abundance. This is often a key goal 
of programs aimed at preserving endangered species.      

 Ecologists  define  a  population  as  a  group  of  individuals  of 
a  single  species  inhabiting  an  area  delimited  by  natural  or 
human-imposed boundaries. Population studies hold the key 
to solving practical problems such as saving endangered spe-
cies, controlling pest populations, or managing fish and game 
populations. All  populations  share  a  number  of  characteris-
tics. Chapter 9 focused on two population characteristics: dis-
tribution and abundance. 

 While there are few environments on earth without life, 
no single species can tolerate the full range of earth’s envi-
ronments.  Because  all  species  find  some  environments  too 
warm, too cold, too saline, and so forth,  environment limits 
the  geographic  distribution  of  species.  The  environmental 
limits of a species are related to its niche. For instance, there 
is a close relationship between climate and the distributions 
of  the  three  largest  kangaroos  in Australia. The  tiger  beetle 
  Cicindela longilabris  is limited to cool boreal and mountain 
 environments. Large- and small-scale variation in temperature 

and moisture limits the distributions of certain desert plants, 
such  as  shrubs  in  the  genus   Encelia.   However,   differences 
in  the  physical  environment  only  partially  explain  the 
 distributions  of  barnacles  within  the  marine  intertidal  zone, 
a reminder that biological factors constitute an  important part 
of an organism’s environment. 

  On  small  scales,  individuals  within  populations  are 
distributed  in  patterns  that  may  be  random,  regular,  or 
clumped.   Patterns  of  distribution  can  be  produced  by  the 
social interactions within populations, by the structure of the 
physical environment, or by a combination of the two. Social 
organisms  tend  to  be  clumped;  territorial  organisms  tend 
to  be  regularly  spaced. An  environment  in  which  resources 
are  patchy  also  fosters  clumped  distributions.  Aggressive 
 species of stingless bees live in regularly distributed colonies, 
whereas the colonies of nonaggressive species are randomly 
distributed.  The  distribution  of  creosote  bushes  changes  as 
they grow. 

 

Chapter 9 

  Population Distribution and Abundance 

217

  On  large  scales,  individuals  within  a  population  are 
clumped.  
In North America, populations of both wintering 
and breeding birds are concentrated in a few hot spots of high 
population density. Clumped distributions are also shown by 
plant populations living along steep environmental gradients 
on mountainsides. 

  Population density declines with increasing  organism 
size.   In  general,  animal  population  density  declines  with 
increasing  body  size.  This  negative  relationship  holds  for 
animals  as  varied  as  terrestrial  invertebrates,  aquatic  inver-
tebrates,  birds,  poikilothermic  vertebrates,  and  herbivorous 
mammals.  Plant  population  density  also  decreases  with 
increasing plant size. However, the biological details under-
lying the size-density relationship shown by plants are quite 
different  from  those  underlying  the  size-density  patterns 
shown by animals. A single species of tree can span a very 
large  range  of  sizes  and  densities  during  its  life  cycle.  The 

largest trees start life as small seedlings that can live at very 
high population densities. As trees grow, their population den-
sity declines progressively until the mature trees live at low 
densities. 

 Rare species are more vulnerable to extinction than are 
common  species.  Rarity  of  species  can  be  expressed  as  a 
combination of extensive versus restricted geographic range, 
broad versus narrow habitat tolerance, and large versus small 
population  size.  The  most  abundant  species  and  those  least 
threatened  by  extinction  combine  large  geographic  ranges, 
wide habitat tolerance, and high local population density. All 
other  combinations  of  geographic  range,  habitat   tolerance, 
and population size include one or more attributes of  rarity. 
 Populations  that  combine  restricted  geographic  range  with 
narrow  habitat  tolerance  and  small  population  size  are 
the   rarest  of  the  rare  and  are  usually  the  organisms  most 
 vulnerable to extinction.

  Review Questions 

     1.  What confines  Encelia farinosa  to upland slopes in the Mojave 
Desert? Why is it uncommon along desert washes, where it would 
have access to much more water? What may allow  E. frutescens  
to persist along desert washes whereas  E. farinosa  cannot?  

    2.  Spruce  trees,  members  of  the  genus   Picea,   occur  throughout 
the boreal forest and on mountains farther south. For example, 
spruce  grow  in  the  Rocky  Mountains  south  from  the  heart  of 
boreal forest all the way to the deserts of the southern United 
States and Mexico. How do you think they would be distributed 
in  the  mountains  that  rise  from  the  southern  deserts?  In  par-
ticular, how do altitude and aspect (see chapter 5) affect their 
distributions in the southern part of their range? Would spruce 
populations  be  broken  up  into  small  local  populations  in  the 
southern or the northern part of the range? Why?  

    3.  What kinds of interactions within an animal population lead to 
clumped distributions? What kinds of interactions foster a regu-
lar distribution? What kinds of interactions would you expect to 
find within an animal population distributed in a random pattern?  
    4.  How might the structure of the environment; for example, the 
distributions of different soil types and soil moisture, affect the 
patterns of distribution in plant populations? How should inter-
actions among plants affect their distributions?  

    5.  Suppose one plant reproduces almost entirely from seeds, and 
that its seeds are dispersed by wind, and a second plant repro-
duces asexually, mainly by budding from runners. How should 
these two different reproductive modes affect local patterns of 
distribution seen in populations of the two species?  

    6.  Suppose  that  in  the  near  future,  the  fish  crow  population  in 
North  America  declines  because  of  habitat  destruction.  Now 
that  you  have  reviewed  the  large-scale  distribution  and  abun-
dance  of  the  fish  crow  (see   fig.  9.15  b ),  devise  a  conservation 
plan for the species that includes establishing protected refuges 
for  the  species.  Where  would  you  locate  the  refuges?  How 
many refuges would you recommend?  

    7.  Use the empirical relationship between size and population den-
sity observed in the studies by Damuth (1981) (see  fig. 9.19 ) 
and  Peters  and  Wassenberg  (1983)  (see   fig.  9.20 )  to  answer 
the following: For a given body size, which generally has the 
higher  population  density,  birds  or  mammals?  On  average, 
which lives at lower population densities, terrestrial or aquatic 
invertebrates? Does an herbivorous mammal twice the size of 
another have on average one-half the population density of the 
smaller species? Less than half? More than half?  

    8.  Outline Rabinowitz’s classification (1981) of rarity, which she 
based on size of geographic range, breadth of habitat tolerance, 
and population size. In her scheme, which combination of attri-
butes  makes  a  species  least  vulnerable  to  extinction?  Which 
combination makes a species the most vulnerable?  

    9.  Can  the  analyses  by  Damuth  (1981)  and  by  Peters  and Was-
senberg  (1983)  be  combined  with  that  of  Rabinowitz  (1981) 
to  make  predictions  about  the  relationship  of  animal  size  to 
its relative rarity? What two attributes of rarity, as defined by 
Rabinowitz, are not included in the analyses by Damuth and by 
Peters and Wassenberg?

Chapter 10 

  Population Dynamics 

219

  T  o  explore  population  distribution  and  abundance  in 

 chapter 9, we froze the populations we examined at a par-
ticular instant in time. In nature, however, populations are 
in continuous flux and their patterns of distribution and abun-
dance result from a dynamic balance between factors that add 
individuals to populations, births and immigration, and factors 
that remove individuals from populations, deaths and emigration. 
 These processes that contribute to population size can be 

summarized by a simple equation: 

 Nt 5 Nt 2 1 1 B 1 I 2 D 2 E 

 Where Nt is the number of individuals in a population at some 
time, t, Nt  2  1 is the number of individuals in the population at 
some previous time, t  2  1, B is the number of births that have 
occurred during the interval between t  2  1 and t, I is the num-
ber of immigrants to the population during that time interval, 
D is the number of deaths, and E is the number of individuals 
that have emigrated, or left, the population. 

 The  dynamic  population  processes  underlying  distribu-
tion and abundance are the subject of chapter 10. We call this 
area  of  ecology      population  dynamics,     which  is  concerned 
with the factors influencing the expansion, decline, or mainte-
nance of populations. This is one of the most important areas 
of ecology, since it holds the key to understanding and, hope-
fully,  preventing  the  decline  and  extinction  of  endangered 
species, the control of noxious pest species, including para-
sites and pathogens of humans, and the maintenance of eco-
nomically or culturally important animal or plant populations. 
 Though  generally  unnoticed,  the  dynamic  nature  of 
populations  becomes  apparent  when  a  conspicuous  species 
expands its range. For instance, the expansion of  Africanized 
honeybees  through  South  and  North America  is  well  docu-
mented ( fig. 10.1 ). The legendary aggressiveness of these bees 
ensures  that  their  dispersal  into  a  new  area  has  not  escaped 
notice for long.     

 Honeybees,  Apis melifera,  evolved in Africa and Europe, 
where their native range extends from tropical to cold, tem-
perate  environments.  Across  this  extensive  environmental 
range, this species has differentiated into a number of locally 
adapted subspecies. In an attempt to improve the adaptabil-
ity of managed honeybees to their tropical climate,  Brazilian 
scientists  imported  queens  of  the  African  subspecies   Apis 
melifera  scutellata   in  1956.  These  queens  mated  with  the 
European honeybees used by Brazilian beekeepers, producing 
what we now call Africanized honeybees. 

 Africanized honeybees differ in several ways from Euro-
pean  honeybees.  Temperate  and  tropical  environments  have 
apparently  selected  for  markedly  different  behavior  and  pop-
ulation  dynamics.  Natural  selection  by  a  high  diversity  and 
abundance of nest predators, including humans, has probably 
produced  the  greater  aggressiveness  shown  by  Africanized 
honeybees.  The  warmer  climate  and  greater  stability  of  nec-
tar sources eliminate the advantages of storing large quantities 
of  honey  and  maintaining  large  colonies  for  survival  through 
the  winter.  Most  important  to  this  discussion  of  dispersal, 
 Africanized honeybees produce swarms that disperse to form 
new colonies at a much higher rate than do European honeybees. 

Cold winter temperatures will 
likely halt the northern spread 
of Africanized honeybees.

Africanized honeybees have not

America south of 34°S latitude.

Figure 10.1   The expansion of Africanized honeybees from South 
America through Central and North America, 1956 to 2008 (data from 
Winston 1992, USDA Agricultural Research Service 2011). 

 High rates of colony formation and dispersal have caused 
a rapid expansion of Africanized honeybees through South and 
North America. Their rate of dispersal has ranged from 300 to 
500 km per year. Within 30 years, Africanized honeybees occu-
pied most of South America, all of Central America, and most of 
Mexico. The estimated number of wild colonies of these bees in 
South America alone is 50 to 100 million. Africanized honeybees 
reached southern Texas in 1990 and southern Arizona and New 
Mexico in 1993. By 1994 they were in southern California and 
have since occupied most of the American Southwest. Though 
they colonized southern Florida in 2005, unexpectedly, they have 
not moved into the majority of the southeastern United States. 
The  honeybees  stopped  spreading  southward  through  South 
America by about 1983, stopping at about 34 8  S latitude. How-
ever, they continue to spread northward through North America 
and will continue to do so until stopped by climatic factors. 

 Our  discussion  will  be  organized  around  the  dynamic 
aspects of populations in space and time. We will begin with 
spatial  dynamics  by  considering  the  influence  of  dispersal 
on  distribution  and  abundance,  which  began  with  the  intro-
ductory  example  of  Africanized  honeybees.  We  then  move 
to  temporal  dynamics,  where  we  focus  on  patterns  of  sur-
vival and reproduction in populations, forming a transition to 
 chapter 11, which introduces population growth.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

upon  this  underappreciated  aspect  of  population  dynamics. 
One  of  the  richest  sources  of  information  on  dispersal  and 
some of the clearest examples come from studies of expand-
ing populations.  

 10.3  Compare rates of dispersal by various animal and 

plant species.

 10.4  Discuss the dispersal of North American trees in 

response to climate change at the end of the last ice 
age.

 10.5  Describe numerical responses by owls and kestrels 

in response to changing prey densities.

 10.6  Explain how the colonization cycle sustains popu-

lations of stream invertebrates.

   Dispersal can increase or decrease local population densi-
ties.   Dispersal is an important aspect of population dynam-
ics. The seeds of plants disperse with wind or water or may be 
transported by a variety of mammals, insects, or birds. Adult 
barnacles may spend their lives attached to rocks, but their lar-
vae travel the high seas on far-ranging ocean currents. A host 
of other sessile marine invertebrates, algae, and many highly 
sedentary  reef  fishes  also  disperse  widely  as  larvae.  Some 
young  spiders  spin  a  small  net  that  catches  winds  and  car-
ries them for distances up to hundreds of kilometers. Young 
mammals and birds often disperse from the area where they 
were born and may join other local populations. As a conse-
quence of movements such as these ( fig. 10.2 ), the population 
ecologist trying to understand local population density must 
consider dispersal  into  (immigration) and  out of  (emigration) 
the local population.     

 Despite  its  importance,  dispersal  is  one  of  the  least-
studied  aspects  of  population  dynamics.  Its  study  is  clearly 
a  difficult  undertaking.  But  dispersal  is  worth  studying;  the 
health  and  survival  of  many  local  populations  may  depend

   Dispersal of Expanding Populations 
 Expanding populations are in the process of increasing their 
geographic range. Why should this type of population provide 
us  with  some  of  the  best  records  of  species  dispersal?  The 
appearance of a new species in an area is quickly noted and 
recorded, especially if the species impacts the local economy 
or human health or safety, or attracts significant attention, as 
would a new bird species. 

  Eurasian Collared Doves 
 Birds provide some of the best examples of rapid population 
expansion.  European  starlings  and  house  sparrows,  which 
were  purposely  introduced  into  North  America,  spread 
across the continent in less than a century. Eurasian collared 
doves,  Streptopelia decaocto,  began to spread from Turkey 
into Europe after 1900. The expansion of  Eurasian collared 
doves into Europe was notable in a number of ways. First, 
the  spread  began  suddenly  and,  once  begun,  was  relent-
less. By the 1980s, the doves were found in every country 
of western and eastern Europe ( fig. 10.3 ). Eurasian collared 
doves have also rapidly colonized North America. A popu-
lation of the species was established in the Bahamas in the 
1970s by birds released during a burglary of a pet shop in 
Nassau. By the early 1980s, Eurasian collared doves colo-
nized nearby Florida, subsequently spreading rapidly across 
North America and reaching California by the mid-1990s.     

 Another  notable  feature  of  the  Eurasian  collared  dove 
expansion across Europe is that we know a great deal about the 
underlying population dynamics. The expansion took place in 
small jumps. Adult Eurasian collared doves are highly seden-
tary, and dispersal is limited to young doves. Most dispersing 
young stay within a few kilometers of their parent’s nest, but 
some disperse hundreds of kilometers ( fig. 10.4 ). Once they 
have  chosen  a  mate,  the  young  birds  nest  and  become  sed-
entary like their parents. These pulses of dispersal by young 
birds  spread  the  Eurasian  collared  dove  population  across 
Europe at a rate of about 45 km per year.   

 How  does  this  rate  of  expansion  by  Eurasian  collared 
doves  compare  to  rates  of  expansion  by  other  populations? 
Compared  with  the  dispersal  rate  of Africanized  honeybees 
across the Americas, 45 km per year is a modest rate. How-
ever,  compared  with  dispersal  rates  for  most  other  animals 
that have been studied, 45 km per year is rapid.  Figure 10.5 , 
which  summarizes  rates  of  dispersal  for  a  variety  of  mam-
mals and birds, shows that rates of dispersal differ by three 
orders of magnitude. While some species such as Africanized 
honeybees and Eurasian collared doves spread at rates of tens 
or hundreds of kilometers per year, others disperse only a few 
hundred meters per year. This is about the same rate at which 
North American trees expanded their distributions at the end 
of the last ice age.

  Range Changes in Response 
to Climate Change 
 In response to climate change following retreat of the glaciers 
northward  in  North  America  beginning  about  16,000  years 
ago,  organisms  of  all  sorts  began  to  move  northward  from 
their ice age refuges. Temperate forest trees have left one of 
the best preserved records of this northward dispersal. As we 
saw in chapter 1, the record of tree movements is well pre-
served in lake sediments (see fig. 1.7). The northward advance 
of maple and hemlock is shown in  figure 10.6 .     

  Figure  10.6   illustrates  a  number  of  ecologically  sig-
nificant  messages.  Though  the  distributions  of  maple  and 
hemlock  overlap  today,  they  did  not  during  the  height  of 
the last ice age. In addition, maple colonized the northern 
part of its present range from the lower Mississippi Valley 
region,  while  hemlock  colonized  its  present  range  from  a 
refuge along the Atlantic coast. The two trees dispersed at 
very  different  rates.  Of  the  two  species,  maple  dispersed 
faster,  arriving  at  the  northern  limits  of  its  present-day 
range  about  6,000  years  ago.  In  contrast,  hemlock  didn’t 
reach the northwestern limit of its present distribution until 
2,000 years ago. 

 The  pollen  preserved  in  lake  sediments  indicates  that 
forest  trees  in  eastern  North  America  spread  northward

 Figure 10.6   The northward expansion of two tree species in North America following glacial retreat (data from Davis 1981).

following the retreat of the glaciers at the rate of 100 to 400 m 
(0.1–0.4 km) per year. This rate of dispersal is similar to that 
of  some  large  mammals  such  as  the  North  American  elk. 
However, it is 1/100 the rate of dispersal shown by Eurasian 
collared  doves  in  Europe  and  1/1,000  the  dispersal  rate  of 
Africanized  honeybees  across  South,  Central,  and  North 
America.  The  range  shifts  by  species  in  response  to  his-
torical climate change anticipate what is happening now in 
response to modern climatic warming, as ecologists from all 
over the planet document rapid changes in the ranges, in both 
elevation  and  latitude,  by  organisms  varying  from  aquatic 
bugs and birds to trees (e.g., Hickling et al. 2006; Kelly and 
 Goulden 2008). 

 The previous examples concern dispersal by populations 
in the process of changing their ranges. Significant dispersal 
also takes place within established populations whose ranges 
are not changing. Movements, within established ranges, can 
be an important aspect of local population dynamics. We will 
consider two examples.  

  Dispersal in Response 
to Changing Food Supply 
 Predators  show  several  kinds  of  responses  to  variation  in 
prey  density.  In  addition  to  the  functional  response  we  dis-
cussed  in  chapter  7,  on  p.  164,  C.  S.  Holling  (1959a)  also 
observed     numerical responses    to increased prey availability. 
Numerical responses are changes in the density of predator 
populations  in  response  to  increased  prey  density.  Holling 
studied  populations  of  mice  and  shrews  preying  on  insect 
cocoons and attributed the numerical responses he observed 
to increased reproductive rates. He commented that, “because 
the  reproductive  rate  of  small  mammals  is  so  high,  there 
was  an  almost  immediate  increase  in  density  with  increase 

in  food.”  However,  some  other  predators,  with  much  lower 
reproductive  rates,  also  show  strong  numerical  responses. 
These numerical responses to prey density are almost entirely 
due to dispersal. 

 In some years, northern landscapes are alive with small 
rodents called voles,  Microtus  spp. Go to the same place dur-
ing  other  years  and  it  may  be  difficult  to  find  any  voles.  In 
northern latitudes, vole populations usually reach high densi-
ties every 3 to 4 years. Between these peak times, population 
densities  crash.  Population  cycles  in  different  areas  are  not 
synchronized, however. In other words, while vole population 
density is very low in one area, it is high elsewhere. 

 Erkki  Korpimäki  and  Kai  Norrdahl  (1991)  conducted  a 
10-year study of voles and their predators. The study began in 
1977 during a peak in vole densities of about 1,800 per square 
kilometer  and  continued  through  two  more  peaks  in  1982 
(960/km 2 ) and 1985–86 (1,980 and 1,710/km 2 ). The research-
ers estimated that between these population peaks vole den-
sities  per  square  kilometer  fell  to  as  low  as  70  in  1980  and 
40 in 1984. During this period, the densities of the European 
kestrel,  Falco tinnunculus,  short-eared owls,  Asio flammeus,  
and long-eared owls,  Asio otus,  closely tracked vole densities 
( fig.  10.7 ).  How  do  kestrel  and  owl  populations  track  these 
variations in vole densities?     

 What  mechanisms  produce  the  numerical  responses 
by  kestrels  and  owls  to  changing  vole  densities?  Look  at 
  figure 10.7  for a clue. The peaks in raptor densities in 1977, 
1982, and 1986 match the peaks in vole densities almost per-
fectly. If reproduction were the source of numerical response 
by kestrels and owls, there would have been more of a delay, 
or  time  lag,  in  kestrel  and  owl  numerical  response.  From 
this  close  match  in  numbers,  Korpimäki  and  Norrdahl  pro-
posed that kestrels and owls must move from place to place in 
response to local increases in vole populations.

 Figure 10.7   Dispersal and numerical response by predators (data 
from Korpimäki and Norrdahl 1991).

 Is there any supporting evidence for high rates of move-
ment  by  kestrels  and  owls?  Korpimäki  (1988)  captured 
217  kestrels  from  1983  to  1987.  Because  European  kestrel 
populations have an annual survival rate of 48% to 66%, he 
predicted a high rate of recapture of marked birds. However, 
only  3%  of  the  female  and  13%  of  the  male  kestrels  were 
recaptured. These  very  low  rates  of  recapture  indicated  that 
kestrels  were  moving  into  and  out  of  the  study  area.  From 
their  data,  Korpimäki  and  Norrdahl  concluded  that  the  kes-
trels and owls in western Finland are nomadic, moving from 
place to place in response to changing vole densities. 

 These  studies  documented  the  contribution  of  disper-
sal  to  local  populations  of  kestrels  and  owls.  Earlier  in  this 
section, we saw how studies of expanding populations have 
shed  light  on  the  contribution  of  dispersal  to  local  popula-
tion density and dynamics. Many other local populations are 
strongly influenced by dispersal. One of the environments in 
which dispersal has a major influence on local populations is 
in streams and rivers.  

  Dispersal in Rivers and Streams 
 One  of  the  most  distinctive  features  of  the  stream  and  river 
environment is  current,  the downstream flow of water. What 
effect does current have on the lives of stream organisms? As 
you may recall from chapter 3 (see p. 65), the effects of cur-
rent are substantial and influence everything from the amount 
of  oxygen  in  the  water  to  the  size,  shape,  and  behavior  of 
stream organisms. In this section, we stop and consider how 
stream populations are affected by current. 

 Let’s  begin  with  a  question.  Why  doesn’t  the   flowing 
water  of  streams  eventually  wash  all  stream  organisms, 
including fish, insects, snails, bacteria, algae, and fungi, out 
to sea? All stream dwellers have a variety of characteristics 
that help them maintain their position in streams. Some fish, 

Chapter 10 

  Population Dynamics 

223

such  as  trout,  are  streamlined  and  can  easily  swim  against 
swift currents, while other fish like sculpins and loaches are 
well  designed  for  avoiding  the  full  strength  of  currents  by 
living  on  the  bottom  and  seeking  shelter  among  or  under 
stones. Microorganisms resist being washed away by adher-
ing  to  the  surfaces  of  stones,  wood,  and  other  substrates. 
Many  stream  insects  are  flattened  and  so  stay  out  of  the 
main force of the current, while others are streamlined and 
fast-swimming. 

 Despite  these  means  of  staying  in  place,  stream  organ-
isms do get washed downstream in large numbers, particularly 
during  flash  floods,  or      spates.     To  observe  this  downstream 
movement  of  organisms,  put  a  fine  or  medium  mesh  net  in 
a stream or river and you will soon capture large numbers of 
stream insects and algae along with fragments of leaves and 
wood. Stream ecologists refer to this downstream movement 
of stream organisms as     drift.    Some drift is due to displace-
ment of organisms during flash floods. However, some is due 
to the active movement of organisms downstream. 

 Whatever its cause, stream organisms drift downstream in 
large numbers. Why doesn’t drift eventually eliminate organ-
isms  from  the  upstream  sections  of  streams?  Karl  Müller 
(1954, 1974) hypothesized that drift would eventually wash 
entire  populations  out  of  streams  unless  organisms  actively 
moved  upstream  to  compensate  for  drift.  He  proposed  that 
stream populations are maintained through a dynamic inter-
play  between  downstream  and  upstream  dispersal  that  he 
called  the      colonization  cycle.     The  colonization  cycle  is  a 
dynamic view of stream populations in which upstream and 
downstream  dispersal,  as  well  as  reproduction,  have  major 
influences on stream populations ( fig. 10.8 ).     

 Many studies support Müller’s hypothesized colonization 
cycle,  especially  among  aquatic  insects.  As  larvae,  aquatic 
insects  disperse  upstream  as  well  as  downstream  by  swim-
ming, crawling, and drifting. Because of continuous dispersal, 

In the colonization 
cycle, upstream and 
downstream dispersal 
and reproduction have 
major influences on 
stream populations.

which reshuffles stream populations, new substrates put into 
streams  are  quickly  colonized  by  a  wide  variety  of  stream 
invertebrates,  algae,  and  bacteria.  Most  of  these  dynamics 
are difficult to observe because they occur too quickly, within 
the  substratum,  or  at  night,  or  they  involve  microorganisms 
impossible  to  observe  directly  without  the  aid  of  a  micro-
scope. However, snails living in clear tropical streams allow 
researchers to observe the colonization cycle directly (Blanco 
and Scetena 2005, 2006, 2007). 

 The Rio Claro flows approximately 30 km through tropi-
cal  forest  on  the  Osa  Peninsula  of  Costa  Rica  before  flow-
ing into the Pacific Ocean. One of the most easily observed 
inhabitants  of  the  Rio  Claro  is  the  snail   Neritina  latissima,
which  occupies  the  lower  5  km  of  the  river.  The  eggs  of 
Neritina   hatch  to  produce  free-living  planktonic  larvae  that 
drift  down  to  the  Pacific  Ocean. After  the  larvae  metamor-
phose into small snails they reenter the Rio Claro and begin 
moving  upstream  in  huge  migratory  aggregations  of  up  to 
500,000  individuals  ( fig.  10.9 ).  These  aggregations  move 
slowly and may take up to 1 year to reach the upstream limit 
of the population.

 Figure 10.9   The colonization cycle in action. ( a ) A wave of 
migrating snails,  Neritina latissima,  in the Rio Claro, Costa Rica; ( b ) a 
close-up of the migrating snails.

 Daniel  Schneider  and  John  Lyons  (1993)  discovered 
that  the  population  of   Neritina   in  the  Rio  Claro  consists  of 
a  mixture  of  migrating  and  stationary  subpopulations,  with 
exchange  between  them.  Individual  snails  migrate  upstream 
for some distance and then leave the migrating wave and enter 
a  local  subpopulation.  At  the  same  time  individuals  from 
the  local  subpopulation  enter  the  migratory  wave  and  move 
upstream.  Thus,  individuals  move  upstream  in  steps  and 
immigration continuously adds to local subpopulations, while 
emigration removes individuals. Because an organism that is 
visible  to  the  naked  eye  does  all  this  in  a  clear  stream,  and 
does it at a snail’s pace, we are provided with a unique oppor-
tunity  to  observe  that  dispersal  can  strongly  influence  local 
population  density.  Dispersal  dynamics,  though  difficult  to 
study, deserve greater attention. 

  Concept 10.1 Review 

      1.   Why  might  a  species,  such  as  the  Eurasian  collared 
dove, be less threatened by rapid climate change than 
hemlock or maple trees?  

     2.   Ecologists  who  have  used  clear  plastic  sheets  coated 
with adhesive to trap the adults of aquatic insects flying 
over rivers have found that the side of the sheets facing 
downstream  generally  traps  more  of  the  flying  adults 
than the upstream-facing side. Explain.       

  10.2  Metapopulations 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 10.7  Describe the role of dispersal in sustaining a 

metapopulation.

 10.8  Discuss the similarities and differences in metapop-
ulations of Rocky Mountain Parnassian butterflies 
and lesser kestrels.

   Ongoing  dispersal  can  join  numerous  subpopulations 
to form a metapopulation.   Populations  of  many  species 
occur not as a single continuously distributed population but 
as  spatially  separated      subpopulations.    A  subpopulation  is 
a  part  of  a  larger  population,  with  which  it  sustains  a  lim-
ited exchange of individuals through immigration and emi-
gration. A  group  of  subpopulations  living  on  such  patches 
connected by exchange of individuals among patches make 
up  a       metapopulation.     The  population  of  Glanville  fritil-
lary  butterflies,   Melitaea  cinxia,   which  lives  in  dry  mead-
ows  scattered  through  the  landscape  of  southern  Finland 
(see  chapter  4,  p.  94),  is  a  metapopulation.  In  the  discus-
sion of this butterfly metapopulation, we reviewed how the 
exchange  of  individuals  among  subpopulations  has  been 
well documented (Saccheri et al. 1998). However, the meta-
population  of   Melitaea   in  southern  Finland  is  only  one  of 
many that are well known. Here is another example of a but-
terfly metapopulation.

   A Metapopulation of an Alpine Butterfly 
 Once  population  biologists  began  to  include  the  concept  of 
metapopulations  in  their  thinking,  they  found  them  every-
where.  Butterflies  have  been  well  represented  in  studies 
of  metapopulations.  One  of  these  butterflies  is  the  Rocky 
 Mountain  Parnassian  butterfly, 
smintheus  
( fig. 10.10 ). The range of  P. smintheus  extends from  northern 
New  Mexico  along  the  Rocky  Mountains  to  southwestern 
Alaska. Along this range  P. smintheus  caterpillars feed mainly 
on  the  leaves  and  flowers  of  stonecrop,   Sedum   sp.,  in  areas 
of open forest and meadows. Because of their tie to a  narrow 
range  of  host  plants,   P.  smintheus   populations  are  often 
 distributed among the habitat patches occupied by their host 
plant, appearing to form metapopulations.   

 Parnassius 

 One such metapopulation was studied by Jens Roland, 
Nusha  Keyghobadi,  and  Sherri  Fownes  of  the  University 
of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada (2000). These researchers 
focused their attention on a series of 20 alpine  meadows 
on ridges in the Kananaskis region of the  Canadian Rocky 
Mountains. The study meadows ranged in area from about 
0.8  ha  to  20  ha.  While  some  meadows  were   adjacent 
to  each  other,  others  were  separated  by  up  to  200  m 
of  coniferous  forest.  The  host  plant  of   P.   smintheus   in 
the  study  meadows  was  the  lanceleaf  stonecrop,   Sedum 
lanceolatum.

Movements of butterflies

the local populations of 
this butterfly into a 
metapopulation.

 Figure 10.10    A metapopulation of the Rocky Mountain 
 Parnassian butterfly,  Parnassius smintheus.  Because it is tied to 
 meadows where its larval host plants grow,  P.   smintheus  lives in 
 scattered subpopulations living in patches of meadows surrounded 
by forest. Butterflies dispersing between meadows connect these 
 subpopulations, sustaining a metapopulation (after Matter et al. 2009). 

 A  combination  of  fire  suppression  by  forest  manag-
ers  and  global  warming  appears  to  be  decreasing  the  size 
of alpine meadows and increasing their isolation from each 
other  by  intervening  forest.  In  1952,  the  study  meadows 
averaged approximately 36 ha in area. By 1993, the average 
area of these meadows had declined to approximately 8 ha, 
a  decrease  in  area  of  approximately  77%.  These  changes 
motivated  the  research  team  of  Roland,  Keyghobadi,  and 
Fownes to study the influences of meadow size and isolation 
on movements of  P. smintheus  during the summers of 1995 
and 1996. 

 The research team marked and recaptured butterflies to 
estimate population size in each meadow and to follow but-
terfly movements. Butterflies were hand netted and marked 
on  the  hind  wing  with  a  three-letter  identification  code, 
using  a  fine-tipped  permanent  marker.  The  team  recorded 
the  sex  of   P.  smintheus   captured  and  its  location  within 
20  m.  Upon  recapture,  dispersal  distance  of  an  individual 
was estimated as the straight line distance from its last point 
of capture. 

 Roland, Keyghobadi, and Fownes marked 1,574  P. smin-
theus  in 1995 and 1,200 in 1996. Of these marked individu-
als, they recaptured 726 in 1995 and 445 in 1996. Over the 
course  of  the  study,  the  size  of   P.  smintheus   populations 
in the 20 study meadows ranged from 0 to 230. The aver-
age movement distance by males and females in 1995 was 
approximately  131  m.  In  1996,  the  average  movement 
distances  of  males  and  females  was  162  m  and  118  m, 
respectively.  The  maximum  dispersal  distance  for  a  but-
terfly  in  1995  was  1,729  m  and  in  1996  the  maximum 
dispersal  distance  was  1,636  m.  Most  of  the  movements 
determined  by  recaptures  were  the  result  of  dispersal 
within  meadows.  In  1995  only  5.8%  of  documented  dis-
persal movements were from one meadow to another and 
in 1996 dispersal between meadows accounted for 15.2% 
of total recaptures. 

 One  of  the  questions  posed  by  Roland,   Keyghobadi, 
and  Fownes  was  how  meadow  size  and  population  size 
might  affect  dispersal  by   P.  smintheus.   As  shown  in 
  figure  10.11 ,  average  butterfly  population  size  increased 
with  meadow  area.  It  turned  out  that  butterflies  are  more 
likely  to  leave  small  populations  than  large  populations. 
Butterflies  leaving  small  populations  generally  immigrate 
to larger populations. The researchers pointed out that this 
pattern of movement, from small to large populations, has 
been  observed  in  several  other  butterfly  species,  includ-
ing the Glanville fritillary (see p. 94). Ongoing research is 
aimed at discovering the reasons for this pattern of immi-
gration. The  results  of  this  study  by  Roland,  Keyghobadi, 
and Fownes indicate that as alpine meadows in the Rocky 
Mountains  decline  in  area,  populations  of   P.  smintheus  
will  become  progressively  more  compressed  into  fewer 
and  fewer  small  meadows,  perhaps  disappearing  entirely 
in  parts  of  their  range.  Some  of  the  patterns  of  dispersal 
within this metapopulation of alpine butterflies have been 
observed in a recent study of dispersal in a metapopulation 
of a small falcon.

  Dispersal Within a Metapopulation 
of Lesser Kestrels 
 The lesser kestrel,  Falco naumanni,  is a small migratory fal-
con that breeds in colonies of monogamous pairs in Eurasia 
and  spends  its  winters  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  ( fig.  10.12 ). 
Lesser  kestrels  have  suffered  a  high  rate  of  decline  across 
their range and are listed as a globally threatened species. In 

 Figure 10.12    The lesser kestrel,  Falco naumanni,  breeds 
in  scattered colonies that collectively form metapopulations. 
Most  populations of this species have declined dramatically with 
 modernization of agriculture. 

contrast to its global circumstance, the lesser kestrel popula-
tion  of  the  Ebro  River  valley  of  northeast  Spain  has  grown 
dramatically  in  recent  years.  David  Serrano  and  Jose  Tella, 
two ecologists who have conducted long-term studies of this 
population  (Serrano  and  Tella  2003),  documented  growth 
in  this  population  from  224  pairs  distributed  among  4  sub-
populations in 1993 to 787 pairs living in 14 subpopulations 
in  2000.  Serrano  and  Tella  attribute  this  regional  growth  to 
sustained traditional farming practices in the Ebro River val-
ley.  However,  they  warn  that  plans  to  modernize  farming 
practices in the Ebro River valley may lead to the population 
declines seen elsewhere.   

 Serrano  and  Tella  used  numbered,  color  leg  bands  to 
mark  and  keep  track  of  individual  kestrels  in  their  study 
population. From 1993 to 1999, they banded 4,901 fledgling 
kestrels and 640 adults. Because lesser kestrels breed within 
colonies, they are easier to track during the breeding season. 
Once locating a colony, Serrano and Tella would observe the 
colony  members  from  a  blind,  record  the  numbers  of  pairs 
within the colony, and, using a telescope, read the numbers 
on  the  leg  band  of  any  banded  adult  birds  in  the  colony. 
 Serrano and Tella were able to obtain accurate counts of the 
entire breeding population of lesser kestrels within the Ebro 
River  valley  each  year.  They  could  also  use  their  observa-
tions  to  plot  the  movements  of  any  banded  birds  they  saw. 
Within  colonies,  the  percentage  of  banded  adults  of  known 
age ranged from 60% to 90%. 

 The  data  gathered  by  Serrano  and Tella  indicate  that  a 
substantial  percentage  of  birds  leave  the  breeding  colony 
where  they  hatched  to  join  other  subpopulations  in  their 
first year of breeding. However, females  in  this  species are 
more likely to move than males. The rate  of emigration by 
first-breeding  females  is  approximately  30%  versus  22% 
for  first-breeding  males.  In  contrast,  less  than  4%  of  older 
adults  emigrate  from  a  colony  on  any  given  year.  Though 
some lesser kestrels in the study population dispersed more 
than 100 km, Serrano and Tella found a negative correlation 
between distance between colonies and the frequency of dis-
persal between them. 

 The lesser kestrels of the Ebro River valley and the Rocky 
Mountain Parnassian butterflies of southern Alberta, Canada, 
interact  with  their  environments  on  greatly  different  scales. 
In addition, the butterfly population appears to be contracting 
spatially; the lesser kestrel population is expanding. However, 
these populations also have a number of features in common. 
First, they both are spatially organized into metapopulations. 
Another  feature  that  the  two  populations  share  is  the  influ-
ence of local population size on the tendency to disperse and 
the  direction  of  dispersal.  Like   P.  smintheus,   lesser  kestrels 
in  smaller  subpopulations  are  more  likely  to  emigrate  than 
are individuals in larger subpopulations. Second, lesser kes-
trels are more likely to disperse from small colonies to larger 
colonies. 

 In  the  last  two  Concept  discussions,  we  have  reviewed 
the influences of dispersal on populations. Now we compare 
patterns of survival in populations, a major contributor to the 
dynamic nature of populations.

1.    Figure 10.11  and the upper portion of  figure 21.13  show 
the  relationship  between  meadow  size  and  popula-
tion size in two butterfly species. How are the patterns 
shown by the two graphs similar? How do they differ? 
(note 1 ha  5  10,000 m 2 )  

2.   The Rocky Mountain Parnassian butterfly tends to dis-
perse from small to large meadows. Why is this direc-
tion of movement more advantageous than the reverse? 
(Hint: See Glanville fritillary studies, chapter 4, p. 94.)

  10.3  Patterns of Survival 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 10.9  Compare cohort and static life tables.
 10.10  Define age distribution.
 10.11  Construct a survivorship curve, using data from a life 

table.

 10.12  Identify type I, II, and III survivorship curves.
 10.13  Explain the population processes underlying type I, 

II, and III survivorship curves.

   A survivorship curve summarizes the pattern of survival 
in a population.   Patterns of survival vary a great deal from 
one species to another and, depending on environmental cir-
cumstances, can vary substantially even within a single spe-
cies. Some species produce young by the millions, which, in 
turn, die at a high rate. Other species produce a few young and 
invest  heavily  in  their  care. The  young  of  species  that  have 
evolved this pattern survive at a high rate. Still other species 
show intermediate patterns of reproductive rate, parental care, 
and  juvenile  survival.  In  response  to  practical  challenges  of 
discerning  patterns  of  survival,  population  biologists  have 
invented bookkeeping devices called     life tables    that list both 
the survivorship and the deaths, or  mortality,  in populations.  

   Estimating Patterns of Survival 
 There are three main ways of estimating patterns of survival 
within  a  population.  The  first  and  most  reliable  way  is  to 
identify a large number of individuals that are born at about 
the same time and keep records on them from birth to death. 
A group born during the same time period; for example, the 
same year, is called a     cohort.    A life table made from data col-
lected  in  this  way  is  called  a      cohort  life  table.     The  cohort 
studied might be a group of plant seedlings that germinated 
at  the  same  time  or  all  the  lambs  born  into  a  population  of 
mountain sheep in a particular year. 

 While understanding and interpreting a cohort life table 
may be relatively easy, obtaining the data upon which a cohort 

life table is based is not. Imagine yourself lying face down in 
a meadow painstakingly counting thousands of tiny seedlings 
of  an  annual  plant. You  must  mark  their  locations  and  then 
come  back  every  week  for  6  months  until  the  last  member 
of the population dies. Or, if you are studying a moderately 
long-lived species, such as a barnacle or a perennial herb like 
a  buttercup,  imagine  checking  the  cohort  repeatedly  over  a 
period  of  several  years.  If  your  study  organism  is  a  mobile 
animal  such  as  a  whale  or  falcon,  the  problems  multiply.  If 
your species is very long-lived, such as a giant sequoia, such 
an approach is impossible within a single human lifetime. In 
such  circumstances  population  biologists  usually  resort  to 
other techniques. 

 A  second  way  to  estimate  patterns  of  survival  in  wild 
populations  is  to  record  the  age  at  death  of  a  large  number 
of individuals. This method differs from the cohort approach 
because the individuals in your sample are born at different 
times. This method produces a     static life table.    The table is 
called  static  because the method involves a snapshot of sur-
vival within a population during a short interval of time. To 
produce a static life table, the biologist often needs to estimate 
the  age  at  which  individuals  die.  This  can  be  done  by  tag-
ging individuals when they are born and then recovering the 
tags after death and recording the age at death. An alternative 
procedure is to somehow estimate the age of dead individu-
als. The age of many species can be determined reasonably 
well. For instance, mountain sheep can be aged by counting 
the growth rings on their horns. There are also growth rings 
on the carapaces of turtles, in the trunks of trees, and in the 
“stems” of soft or hard corals. 

 A third way of determining patterns of survival is from 
the     age distribution.    An age distribution consists of the pro-
portion of individuals of different ages within a population. 
You can use an age distribution to estimate survival by calcu-
lating the difference in proportion of individuals in succeed-
ing age classes. This method, which also produces a static life 
table, assumes that the difference in numbers of individuals 
in one age class and the next is the result of mortality. What 
are some other major assumptions underlying the use of age 
distributions  to  estimate  patterns  of  survival?  This  method 
requires that a population is neither growing nor declining and 
that it is not receiving new members from the outside or los-
ing members because they migrate away. Since most of these 
assumptions are often violated in natural populations, a life 
table constructed from this type of data tends to be less accu-
rate than a cohort life table. Static life tables are often useful, 
however, since they may be the only information available.  

  High Survival Among the Young 
 Adolph Murie (1944) studied patterns of survival among Dall 
sheep ( fig. 10.13 ) in what is now Mount Denali National Park, 
Alaska.  Murie  estimated  survival  patterns  by  collecting  the 
skulls  of  608  sheep  that  had  died  from  various  causes.  He 
determined  the  age  at  which  each  sheep  in  his  sample  died 
by counting the growth rings on their horns and by studying 
tooth wear. The major assumption of this study was that the

Dall sheep surviving their first year 
of life have a high probability of 
surviving to about age 9.

ity among Dall sheep is much like that for a variety of other 
large vertebrates, including red deer,  Cervus elaphus,  Colum-
bian  black-tailed  deer,   Odocoileus  hemionus  columbianus,  
East African buffalo,  Syncerus caffer,  and humans. The key

proportion  of  skulls  in  each  age  class  represented  the  typi-
cal proportion of individuals dying at that age. For example, 
the proportion of sheep in the sample that died before the age 
of 1 year represents the proportion that generally dies during 
the  first  year  of  life. While  this  assumption  is  not  likely  to 
be strictly true, the pattern of survival that emerges probably 
gives a reasonable picture of survival in the population, par-
ticularly when the sample is as large as Murie’s. 

  Figure  10.14   summarizes  the  survival  patterns  for  Dall 
sheep based on Murie’s sample of skulls. The upper portion of 
the figure shows the static life table that Murie constructed. The 
first column lists the ages of the sheep, the second column lists 
the number surviving in each age class, and the third column 
lists the numbers dying in each age class. Notice that although 
Murie  studied  only  608  skulls,  the  numbers  in  the  table  are 
expressed as numbers per 1,000 individuals. This adjustment 
is made to ease comparisons with other populations.   

 The  upper  portion  of   figure  10.14   also  shows  how  to 
translate numbers of deaths into numbers of survivors. Plot-
ting  number  of  survivors  per  1,000  births  against  age  pro-
duces the     survivorship curve    shown in the lower portion of 
the  figure. A  survivorship  curve  shows  patterns  of  life  and 
death  within  a  population.  Notice  that  in  this  population  of 
Dall  sheep,  there  are  two  periods  when  mortality  rates  are 
higher:  during  the  first  year  and  during  the  period  between 
9 and 13 years. Juvenile mortality and mortality of the aged 
are  higher  in  this  population,  while  mortality  in  the  middle

characteristics of survival among these populations are rela-
tively  high  rates  of  survival  among  the  young  and  middle-
aged and high rates of mortality among the older members. 

 This pattern of survival has also been observed in popula-
tions of annual plants and small invertebrate animals. Notice 
in  figure 10.15  that patterns of survival in a population of a 
plant,  Phlox drummondii,  and a rotifer,  Floscularia conifera,  
are  remarkably  similar  to  that  of  Dall  mountain  sheep. 
 Following an initial period of higher juvenile mortality, mor-
tality is relatively low for a period, and then mortality is high 
among  older  individuals.  In  the   Phlox   population,  however, 
this pattern of survival is played out in less than 1 year and in

the rotifer population in less than 11 days. These survivorship 
curves are based on cohort life tables.   

 Survival patterns can be quite different in other species. 
In the next example, mortality is not delayed until old age but 
occurs at approximately equal rates throughout life.  

  Constant Rates of Survival 
 The survivorship curves of many species are nearly straight 
lines.  In  these  populations,  individuals  are  equally  likely  to 
die at any age. This pattern of survival has been commonly 
observed in birds, such as the American robin,  Turdus migra-
torius,  and the white-crowned sparrow,  Zonotrichia leucoph-
rys  nuttalli   ( fig.  10.16 ).  Life  expectancy  remains  relatively

constant over the whole period a cohort is in existence. While 
birds  are  the  most  well  known  for  showing  a  linear  pattern 
of  survival,  many  other  species  do  as  well.  For  instance, 
  figure 10.16  also shows the same pattern of survival for a pop-
ulation  of  the  common  mud  turtle,   Kinosternon  subrubrum.  
Though the mud turtle has a high rate of mortality during the 
first year of life, thereafter, survival follows a straight line.   

 As  we  shall  see  next,  some  organisms  die  at  a  much 
higher rate as juveniles than we have seen in any of the popu-
lations we have considered to this point.  

  High Mortality Among the Young 
 Some organisms produce large numbers of young with very 
high  rates  of  mortality.  The  eggs  produced  by  marine  fish 
such as the mackerel,  Scomber scombrus,  may number in the 
millions. Out of 1 million eggs laid by a mackerel, more than 
999,990 die during the first 70 days of life either as eggs, lar-
vae, or juveniles. Survival rates are similar in populations of 
the prawn  Leander squilla  off the coast of Sweden. For each 
1  million  eggs  laid  by   Leander,   only  about  2,000  individu-
als survive the first year of life. This period of high mortality 
among young prawns is followed by a fairly constant mortal-
ity over the remainder of the life span. 

 Similar  patterns  of  survival  are  shown  by  other  marine 
invertebrates  and  fish  and  by  plants  that  produce  immense 
numbers of seeds. One of these plants is  Cleome droserifolia,  
a desert shrub studied by Ahmad Hegazy (1990). Hegazy esti-
mated that a local population of approximately 2,000 plants 
produce almost 20 million seeds each year. Of these, approxi-
mately 12,500 seeds germinate and produce seedlings. Only 
800 seedlings survive to become juvenile plants.   Figure 10.17  
traces  this  pattern  of  survival  by   Cleome   expressed  as  sur-
vivors  per  million  seeds.  Hegazy  estimated  that  for  each 

The vertical scale has been

1  million seeds produced, about 39 survive to the age of 1 year, 
a survival rate of only 0.0039%. Survival in this desert plant 
population contrasts sharply with that seen in Dall sheep. The 
striking difference in patterns of survival between populations 
such as  Cleome,  birds such as the American robin, and large 
mammals such as Dall sheep led early population biologists 
to propose a classification of survivorship curves.      

  Three Types of Survivorship Curves 
 Based on studies of survival by a wide variety of organisms, 
population  ecologists  have  proposed  that  most  survivorship 
curves  fall  into  three  major  categories  ( fig.  10.18 ). A  rela-
tively  high  rate  of  survival  among  young  and  middle-aged 
individuals  followed  by  a  high  rate  of  mortality  among  the 
aged  is  known  as  a      type  I  survivorship  curve.     This  is  the 
pattern  of  survival  we  saw  in  populations  of  Dall  sheep, 
 P. drummondii,  and rotifers (see  figs. 10.14  and  10.15 ). Con-
stant rates of survival throughout life produce the straight-line 
pattern  of survival known as a     type II survivorship curve.    
American robins, white-crowned sparrows, and common mud 
turtles show this pattern of survival (see  fig. 10.16 ). A     type III 
survivorship  curve     is  one  in  which  a  period  of  extremely 
high rates of mortality among the young is followed by a rela-
tively high rate of survival. The desert plant  Cleome  provides 
an  excellent  example  of  a  type  III  survivorship  curve  (see 
 fig. 10.17 ).     

 How well does this classification of survivorship repre-
sent  natural  populations?  Most  populations  do  not  conform

but show virtually every sort of intermediate form of survivor-
ship  between  the  curves.  If  survivorship  can  be  so  variable 
within species, what good are these idealized, theoretical sur-
vivorship curves? Their most important value, like most theo-
retical constructs, is that they set boundaries that mark what

In type I survivorship,

among older individuals.

In contrast, 
individuals in a 
population with 
type II survivorship

regardless of age.

Individuals showing 
type III survivorship 
die at a high rate as 
juveniles and then at 
much lower rates 
later in life.

is  possible  within  populations.  Regardless  of  how  closely 
actual survivorship curves approximate the theoretical curves, 
they  serve  excellent  summaries  of  survival  patterns  within 
populations. 

 We  now  turn  to  the  age  distributions  of  populations,  a 
topic  closely  related  to  survivorship. As  we  have  seen,  the 
age  distribution  of  a  population  can  be  used  to  construct  a 
static life table from which a survivorship curve can be drawn. 
However, as we shall see next, a population’s age distribution 
offers  other  insights  into  population  dynamics,  particularly 
patterns of survival and reproduction. 

  Concept 10.3 Review 

1.   How  would  substantial  emigration  and  immigration 
affect  estimates  of  survivorship  within  a  population, 
where estimates are based on age distributions?  

2.   Female cottonwood trees ( Populus  species) produce mil-
lions of seeds each year. Does this information give you 
a sound basis for predicting their survivorship pattern?  

     3.   How would human mortality patterns have to change for 
our species to shift from type I to type II survivorship?       

  10.4  Age Distribution 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 10.14  Describe how survival and reproduction contribute 

to a population’s age distribution.

 10.15  Interpret the age distributions of a variety of 

organisms.

   The age distribution of a population reflects its history of 
survival,  reproduction,  and  potential  for  future  growth. 
Population ecologists can tell a great deal about a population 
just  by  studying  its  age  distribution. Age  distributions  indi-
cate periods of successful reproduction, periods of high and 
low survival, and whether the older individuals in a popula-
tion are replacing themselves or if the population is declining. 
By studying the history of a population, population ecologists 
can make predictions about its future.  

   Contrasting Tree Populations 
 In 1923, R. B. Miller published data on the age distribution 
of a population of white oak,  Quercus alba,  in a mature oak-
hickory forest in Illinois. In his study, Miller first determined 
the relationship between the age of a white oak and the diam-
eter  of  its  trunk.  To  do  this,  he  measured  the  diameters  of 
56 trees of various sizes and then took a core of wood from 
their trunks. By counting the annual growth rings from each 
of the cores, he could determine the ages of the trees in his 
sample. With the relationship between oak age and diameter 
in  hand,  Miller  used  diameter  to  estimate  the  ages  of  hun-
dreds of trees. 

 Most  white  oaks  in  Miller’s  study  forest  were  concen-
trated in the youngest age class of 1 to 50 years, with progres-
sively fewer individuals in the older age classes ( fig. 10.19 ). 
The oldest white oaks in the forest were over 300 years old. 
In other words, the age distribution of white oak in this for-
est was biased toward the young trees. What might we infer 
from this age distribution? The age distribution indicates that 
reproduction is sufficient to replace the oldest individuals in 
the population as they die. That is, this population of white 
oaks appeared to be either stable or growing.   

 The  age  distribution  of  this  white  oak  population 
 contrasts sharply with the age distributions of  populations of 
Rio Grande cottonwoods,  Populus deltoides  spp.   wislizenii.
The  most  extensive  cottonwood  forests  remaining  in  the 
southwestern  United  States  grow  along  the  Middle  Rio 
Grande in central New Mexico. However, studies of age dis-
tributions indicate that these populations are declining. Older 
trees, which can live to a maximum age of about 130 years, 
are not being replaced by younger trees ( fig. 10.20 ). In con-
trast to the white oak population in Illinois, the Rio Grande 
cottonwood  population  is  dominated  by  older  individuals. 
At the study site represented by  figure 10.20 , there has been 
no reproduction for over a decade. At other sites along the 
Rio Grande there has been little reproduction for over three 
decades.     

 Why have Rio Grande cottonwoods failed to reproduce? 
Reproduction by Rio Grande cottonwoods depends upon sea-
sonal  floods,  which  play  two  key  roles.  First,  floods  create 
areas  of  bare  soil  without  a  surface  layer  of  organic  matter 
and  without  competing  vegetation,  ideal  conditions  for  ger-
mination and establishment of cottonwood seedlings. Floods 
also keep these nursery areas of bare soil moist until cotton-
wood seedlings can grow their roots deep enough to tap into 
the  shallow  water  table.  Historically,  these  conditions  were 

The age structure of this population 
of white oaks shows that older trees 
are being replaced by young trees.

This population of white 
oaks is dominated by 
young individuals.

created by spring floods, the timing of which coincided with 
dispersal  of  cottonwood  seeds  by  wind. The  annual  rhythm 
of seed bed preparation and seeding has been interrupted by 
the  construction  of  dams  on  the  Rio  Grande  for  flood  con-
trol and irrigation. The tamed Rio Grande no longer floods, 
and though Rio Grande cottonwoods produce seeds each year, 
their age distribution indicates that these seeds find few suit-
able places to germinate. 

 The age distributions of tree populations change over the 
course of many decades or centuries. Meanwhile, other popu-
lations can change significantly on much shorter  timescales. 
One  of  these  dynamic  populations  has  been  thoroughly 
 studied on the Galápagos Islands.  

  A Dynamic Population in a Variable Climate 
 Rosemary Grant and Peter Grant (1989) have spent decades 
studying Darwin’s finch populations. One of their most thor-
ough studies has concerned the large cactus finch,  Geospiza 
conirostris,  on the island of Genovesa, which lies in the north-
eastern portion of the Galápagos archipelago, approximately 
1,000 km off the west coast of South America. The Galápa-
gos Islands have a highly variable climate, which is reflected 
in the highly dynamic populations of the organisms living on 
the islands, including populations of the large  cactus finch. 

 The  age  distributions  of  the  large  cactus  finch  during 
1983 and 1987 show that the population can be very dynamic 
( fig. 10.21 ). The 1983 age distribution shows a fairly regular 
distribution of individuals among age classes. However, there 
were  no  6-year-old  individuals  in  the  population.  This  gap 
is due to a drought in 1977, during which no finches repro-
duced.  Now,  compare  the  1983  and  1987  age  distributions. 
The distributions contrast markedly, though they are for the 
same population separated by only 4 years!     

A fairly even distribution of 
individuals among several age 
classes suggests several years 
of successful reproduction.

Six-year-old finches are absent 
because the birds did not nest 
during the 1977 drought.

finches,  Geospiza conirostris,  on the island of Genovesa in the  Galápagos 
Islands during 1983 ( a ) and 1987 ( b ) (data from Grant and Grant 1989).

 The  1977  gap  is  still  present  in  the  1987  age  distribu-
tion and another has been added for 2- and 3-year-old finches. 
This second gap is the result of 2 years of reproductive failure 
during a drought that persisted from 1984 to 1985. Another 
difference  is  that  the  1987  age  distribution  is  dominated  by 
4-year-old  birds  that  were  fledged  during  1983.  The  1983 
class  dominates  because  wet  weather  that  year  resulted  in 
very high production of food that the finches depend upon for 
reproduction. This long-term study of the large  cactus finch 
population of Genovesa Island demonstrates the responsive-
ness of population age structure to environmental variation. 

 

Chapter 10 

  Population Dynamics

233

 In this section, we have seen that an age distribution tells 
population  ecologists  a  great  deal  about  the  dynamics  of  a 
population, including whether a population is growing, declin-
ing,  or  approximately  stable.  The  next  section  goes  beyond 
these qualitative assessments. By combining  information on 
survival and age structure with reproductive rates, population 
ecologists can quantify rates of growth or decline. 

  Concept 10.4 Review 

1.   Can a healthy population that is not in danger of extinc-
tion have an age structure that shows years of reproduc-
tive failure?  

2.   The last major natural reproduction by Rio Grande cot-
tonwoods, which produced the large number of 40- and 
50-year-old  trees  documented  by  Howe  and  Knopf 
(1991), occurred before the last major dam was built on 
the river. Is there any evidence for reproductive failure 
before that dam was built (see  fig. 10.20 )?       

  10.5  Rates of Population Change 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 10.16  Define net reproductive rate (R0), geometric rate of 
increase (l), generation time (T ), and per capita rate 
of increase (r).

 10.17  Describe the conditions necessary to produce a 

stable age distribution.

 10.18  Calculate net reproductive rate (R0), geometric 

rate of increase (l), generation time (T ), and per 
capita rate of increase (r) for a population, using 
 fecundity and life table data.

   A  life  table  combined  with  a  fecundity  schedule  can  be 
used  to  estimate  net  reproductive  rate  (  R   0  ),  geometric 
rate  of  increase  (l),  generation  time  (T ),  and  per  capita 
rate  of  increase  ( r  ).  
In  addition  to  survival  rates,  popula-
tion ecologists are concerned about another major influence 
on  local  population  density—birthrates.  In  mammals  and 
other live-bearing organisms, from sharks to humans, the term 
    birthrate    means the number of young born per female in a 
period of time. Population biologists also use the term  birth  
more  generally  to  refer  to  any  other  processes  that  produce 
new  individuals  in  the  population.  In  populations  of  birds, 
fish, and reptiles, births are usually counted as the number of 
eggs laid. In plants, the number of births may be the number 
of seeds produced or the number of shoots produced during 
asexual  reproduction.  In  bacteria,  the  birth,  or  reproductive, 
rate is taken as the rate of cell division. 

 Tracking birthrates in a population is similar to tracking 
survival rates. In a sexually reproducing population, the popu-
lation biologist needs to know the average number of births 
per female for each age class and the number of females in 
each age class. In practice, the ecologist counts the number of 

eggs produced by birds or reptiles, the number of fawns pro-
duced by deer, or the number of seeds or sprouts produced by 
plants. The numbers of offspring produced by parents of dif-
ferent ages are then tabulated. The tabulation of birthrates for 
females of different ages in a population is called a     fecundity 
schedule.    If we combine the information in a fecundity sched-
ule with that in a life table, we can estimate several important 
characteristics of populations. To a population ecologist, one 
of the most important things to know is whether a population 
is growing or declining.  

   Estimating Rates for an Annual Plant 
  Table  10.1   combines  survivorship  with  seed  production  by 
the annual plant  P. drummondii.  The first column,  x,  lists age 
intervals in days. The second column,  n   x  , lists the number of 
individuals in the population surviving to each age interval. 
The third column, lx, lists survivorship, the proportion of the 
population  surviving  to  each  age   x.  The  fourth  column,   m   x  ,
lists the average number of seeds produced by each individ-
ual in each age interval. Finally, the fifth column,  l   x    m   x  , is the 
product of columns 3 and 4. 

 We’ve already used the data in column 3,  l   x  , to construct 
the survivorship curve for this species (see  fig. 10.15 ). Now, 
let’s combine those survivorship data with the seed produc-
tion  for   P.  drummondii,    m   x  ,  to  calculate  the      net  reproduc-
tive rate,    R   0  .   The calculations of reproductive rates in this 
section assume that l  x   and m  x   for each age class in a popula-
tion are constant and, as a result, the population has a     stable 
age  distribution.    In a population with a stable age distribu-
tion, the proportion of individuals in each of the age classes 
is constant. In general, the net reproductive rate is the aver-
age  number  of  offspring  produced  by  an  individual  in  a 
population during its lifetime. In the case of the annual plant 
 P. drummondii,  the net reproductive rate is the average num-
ber of seeds left by an individual. You can calculate the net 
reproductive rate from  table 10.1  by adding the values in the 
final column. The result is: 

R0 5 ∑ lx mx 5 2.4177  

 To calculate the total number of seeds produced by this pop-
ulation  during  the  year  of  study,  multiply  2.4177  by  996, 
which was the initial number of plants in this population. The 
result,  2,408,  is  the  number  of  seeds  that  this  population  of 
 P. drummondii  will begin with the next year. 

 Since   P.  drummondii   has  pulsed  reproduction,  we  can 
estimate  the  rate  at  which  its  population  is  growing  with  a 
quantity known as the  geometric rate of increase l . The geo-
metric rate of increase is the ratio of the population size at two 
points in time: 

l 5

 In this equation,  N   t   1  1  is the size of the population at some 
future time and  N   t   is the size of the population at some earlier 
time ( fig. 10.22 ). The time interval  t  may be years, days, or 
hours; which time interval you use to calculate the geometric

The value of R0, which is greater than 1.0, indicates 
that this population of P. drummondii is growing.

Summing the final column yields R0, 
the net reproductive rate per individual.

rate of increase for a population depends on the organism and 
the rate at which its population grows.     

 Let’s  calculate   l   for  the  population  of   P.  drummondii.  
What time interval should we use for our calculation? Since 
 P. drummondii  is an annual plant, the most meaningful time 

interval would be 1 year. The initial number,  N   t   , of  P. drum-
mondii  in the population was 996. The number of individuals 
(seeds)  in  the  population  at  the  end  of  a  year  of  study  was 
2,408.  This  is  the  number  in  the  next  generation,  which  is 
 N   t   1  1 . Therefore, the geometric rate of increase for the popu-
lation over the period of this study was:

 This is the same value we got for  R  0 . But, before you jump to 
conclusions, you should know that  R  0 , which is the number of 
offspring per female per generation, does not always equal  l . 
In this case,  l  equaled  R  0  because  P. drummondii  is an annual 
plant with pulsed reproduction. If a species has overlapping 
generations and continuous reproduction,  R  0  will usually not 
equal  l  . 

 How long do you think this plant can continue to repro-
duce  at  the  rate  of   l ,  or   R  0    5    2.4177?  Not  long,  but  we’ll 
get  back  to  this  point  in  chapter  11.  Before  we  do  that, 
let’s  do  some  calculations  for  organisms  with  overlapping 
generations.  

  Estimating Rates When Generations Overlap 
 The  population  of  the  common  mud  turtle,   K.  subrubrum,  
whose  mortality  we  examined  in   figure  10.16 ,  contrasts  with

  Population Dynamics

the  P. drummondii  population in various ways. Let’s examine 
some of the details of this turtle’s reproductive patterns in order 
to calculate the net reproductive rate of this population. About 
half (0.507) of the turtles nest each year. Of those females that 
do  nest,  most  nest  once  during  the  year.  However,  some  nest 
twice and a few even nest three times during the year. The aver-
age number of nests per year for the nesting turtles is 1.2, which 
means  that  0.2,  or  one-fifth,  of  the  turtles  produce  a  second 
nest each year. The average     clutch size,    which is the number 
of  eggs  produced  by  a  nesting  female,  is  3.17.  So,  the  aver-
age number of eggs produced by nesting females each year is 
3.17 eggs per nest  3  1.2 nests per year  5  3.8 eggs per year. 
However, remember that only half the females in the population 
nest each year. Therefore, the number of eggs per female per 
year is 0.507  3  3.8  5  1.927 eggs per female per year. This is 

the average total number of eggs per female. On average, half of 
these eggs will develop into males and half into females. How-
ever, population biologists generally keep track of the females 
and are concerned with the production of daughters. We didn’t 
have to consider the sex of individuals in the  Phlox  population 
because all individuals have both male and female reproductive 
organs. Since the sex ratio in this turtle population is 1 male:
1  female,  we  multiply  1.927  by  0.50  to  calculate  the  num-
ber  of  female  eggs  per  adult  female  in  the  population,  which 
equals 0.96 female eggs. This is the value listed in column 3 of 
 table 10.2 .               

  Table  10.2   includes  the  life  table  information  used  to 
 construct  figure 10.16  plus the fecundity information we just 
calculated. As in the  Phlox  population, the sum of  l   x    m   x  , ∑ l   x    m   x   
provides an estimate of  R  0 , the net reproductive rate of females

 Investigating the Evidence 10 

 Hypotheses and Statistical Significance 

LEARNING OUTCOME
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 10.19  Describe the concept of “statistical significance.”

 In chapter 1, we reviewed the roles of questions and hypotheses 
in the process of science. Briefly, we considered how scientists 
use information to formulate questions about the natural world 
and  convert  their  questions  to  hypotheses. A  hypothesis,  we 
said, is a possible answer to a question. 

 Let’s use the distributions we considered in the Inves-
tigating the Evidence box in chapter 9 (p. 209) to exam-
ine  the  nature  of  scientific  hypotheses  in  more  detail.  In 
that discussion we examined samples from three popula-
tions  of  plants,  from  which  we  calculated  the  following 
statistics:

Statistic

Species A

Species B

Species C

–
Mean density, X
Variance in density, s2
Ratio of variance to 
  mean,   s2
 __ 
–  
X

5.27
5.22
0.99

5.18
0.36
0.07

  5.27
44.42
  8.43

Recall that in a random distribution the ratio of the variance to 
the mean equals one, that is,    s 2  __ 
__
 
 X 

   = 1.0.   

 As  we  have  stated  repeatedly,  the  center  of  scientific 
investigation  is  the  hypothesis.  In  the  case  of  these  three 
populations,  an  appropriate  hypothesis  would  be  that  in 
each case,    s 2  __ 
   does not differ  significantly  from one. In other 
__
 
 X 
words, our hypothesis is that each of the populations has a
random  distribution.  How  well  does  this  hypothesis  match 
the  results  of  our  population  counts? While     s 2  __ 
    for   species 
__
 
 X 
A comes close to 1.0 (   s 2  __ 
   = 0.99), the calculated value of    s 2  __ 
__
__
 
 X 
 
 X 
does not exactly equal 1 for any of the populations.  However, 
we  need  to  remember  that  the  numbers  listed  in  the  table 
are  statistical  estimates  of  the  true,  or  actual,   variance  to 
mean  ratio  for  each  of  the  populations.  It  is  unlikely  that 
any of the    s 2  __ 
   values, which were calculated from a sample 
__
 
 X 
of  observations,  would  exactly  match  the  true  variance  to 
mean ratio in any of the three study populations. Because of 
our  limited  sample  size,  we  expect  to  see  some  difference 

between the statistical estimate and the theoretical expecta-
tion of    s 2  __ 
   = 1.0, even in a population known to have a ran-
__
 
 X 
dom distribution. 

 The  critical  point  here  is  to  have  a  basis  for  judging 
whether an observed    s 2  __ 
   differs sufficiently from the  theoretical 
__
 
 X 
expectation  of     s 2  __ 
    =  1.0  to  be  statistically  significant.  A 
__
 
 X 
 statistically  significant  difference  is  one  that  is  unlikely  to 
occur by chance. By tradition, the level of significance used in 
most scientific investigations is P < 0.05, or less than 1 chance 
in 20. 

 Let’s  go  back  to  our  populations  of  plant  species A, 
B,  and  C.  How  can  we  tell  if  any  of  the  three     s 2  __ 
    values 
__
 
 X 
in  the  table  differs  significantly  from  1?  That  is,  how 
can  we  determine  if  the  probability  of  obtaining  each 
value  by  chance  in  a  population  that  actually  has  a  ran-
dom  distribution, is less than 0.05? This is generally done 
by  comparing  an  observed  value  with  tables  of  theoreti-
cally  derived  values.  For  now,  we  can  use  our  judgment 
to make some predictions. Consider species A. The prob-
ability that we could observe a mean value of    s 2  __ 
   = 0.99 by 
__
 
 X 
chance in a population with a random distribution is likely 
to  be  much  greater  than  0.05. As  a  consequence,  we  are 
likely  to  accept  the  hypothesis  that  species A  has  a  ran-
dom distribution. In contrast, the values of    s 2  __ 
   observed for 
__
 
 X 
 species B and C (0.07 and 8.43) differ so much from 1.0 
that  the  probability  of  obtaining  these  results  by  chance 
from  a  population  that  is  actually  randomly  distributed 
is  likely  to  be  low.  If  it  is  less  than  0.05,  we  will  reject 
the  hypothesis  that  these  populations  are  randomly  dis-
tributed, and tentatively accept the alternative hypotheses 
of  clumped  or  regular  distributions.  We  will  gradually 
work  up  to  evaluating  whether  the     s 2  __ 
    ratios  listed  in  the 
__
 
 X 
table  differ  significantly  from    s 2  __ 
   =  1.0  over  the  course  of 
__
 
 X 
 chapters 11 and 12. 

 C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  10 
   1.  When using a significance level of 0.05, how often will we 
reject hypotheses that are actually correct? For instance, 
how often will we reject the hypothesis that the individu-
als in a study population are randomly distributed when, 
in fact, they really are randomly distributed?

in this population. In this case,  R  0   5  0.601. We can interpret 
this number as the average number of daughters produced by 
each female in this population over the course of her lifetime. 
If this number is correct, the mothers in this population are not 
producing enough daughters to replace themselves. It appears 
that  this  population  is  declining.  This  result  makes  sense 
because  during  the  time  this  study  was  done,  the  region  of 
South Carolina where the turtle population lives was experi-
encing severe drought. During the drought Ellenton Bay dried 
from a maximum of 10 ha of open water to about 0.05 ha. 

 The trend in this mud turtle population appears to reflect the 
declining quality of the environment. What value of  R  0  would 
produce  a  stable  turtle  population?  In  a  stable  population,   R  0  
would be 1.0, which means that each female would replace only 
herself during her lifetime. In a growing population, such as the 
population of  Phlox,   R  0  would be greater than 1.0. 

 Population ecologists are also interested in several other 
characteristics of populations. One of those is the generation 
time,  T,  which is the average age of reproduction. We can use 
the information in  table 10.2  to calculate the average genera-
tion time for the common mud turtles of Ellenton Bay:

T 5   

∑ xlx mx 
_______ 
 
R0

 

In this equation  x  is age in years. To calculate  T,  sum the last 
column and divide the result by  R  0 . The result shows that the 
common mud turtles of Ellenton Bay have an average genera-
tion time of 10.6 years. 

 Knowing  R  0  and  T  allows us to estimate   r,  the     per capita 

rate of increase    for a population:

 r 5   

ln R0 
_____ 
    
T

(ln  R  0  is the natural logarithm of  R  0 ). We can interpret  r  as 
birthrate minus death rate:  r   5   b  2  d.  Using this method, the 
estimated  per  capita  rate  of  increase  for  the  common  mud 
 turtle population of Ellenton Bay is: 
r 5   ln 0.601 
_______ 

  5 20.05

 

10.6

 The negative value of  r  in this case indicates that birthrates 
are  lower  than  death  rates  and  the  population  is  declining. 
A value of  r  greater than 0 would indicate a growing popula-
tion, and a value equal to 0 would indicate a stable popula-
tion. While there are ways to make more accurate estimates 
of   r,   this  method  is  accurate  enough  for  our  discussion. 
We will return to  r  in chapter 11 as we discuss population 
growth. 

 In this section we have seen how a life table combined 
with a fecundity schedule can be used to estimate net repro-
ductive rate,  R  0 ; geometric rate of increase,  l ; generation time, 
 T;  and per capita rate of increase,  r,  which are fundamental 
components of population dynamics. Next we review how the 
distributions of some species are changing in response to cli-
mate warming. 

  Concept 10.5 Review 

 1.   Of  the  three  populations  pictured  in   figures  10.19 , 
 10.20 , and  10.21 , which is most likely to have a stable 
age distribution?  

2.   Suppose  that  you  are  managing  a  population  of  an 
endangered  species  that  has  been  reduced  in  numbers 
throughout  its  historic  range  and  that  your  goal  is  to 
increase the size of the population. What values of  R  0
would meet your management goals?  

3.   Both   R  0   and   r   indicate  that  the  mud  turtle  population 
in Ellenton Bay is in decline. Is there any way that this 
population  could  be  maintained  for  many  generations 
even with such negative indicators?

Changes in Species Distributions in 

Response to Climate Warming

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 10.20  Outline the key elements for a robust study of eco-
logical responses to climate change over long peri-
ods of time.

 10.21  Summarize evidence of shifts in elevation and lati-

tude during the past century of climate warming.

Earlier in this chapter, we reviewed how the latitudinal dis-
tributions  of  maple  species,  Acer  spp.  and  hemlock,  Tsuga
canadensis,  moved  northward  across  North  America  in 
response  to  climate  changes,  following  the  end  of  the  last 
glacial period (see Figure 10.6, p. 222). That discussion also 
referred  briefly  to  ongoing  studies  of  how  species  distribu-
tions  are  responding  to  today’s  rapidly  warming  climate, 
discussed in detail in chapter 23, in the context of the broad 
subject of global change. Here we review a few of the stud-
ies that have documented shifts in the elevation or latitudinal 
ranges of many hundreds of species during the past century of 
environmental warming (Chen et. al 2011).

Let’s begin with a well-studied organism that has already 
entered our discussion, the land snail, Arianta arbustorum. In 
chapter 5, we reviewed a study by Bruno and Anette Baur (Baur 
and Baur 1993) that documented local extinctions of this spe-
cies around Basel, Switzerland, where the urban heat island has 
warmed habitats that once supported populations of the snail 
(see p. 238). The Baurs’ study also provided a potential mecha-
nism to explain those local extinctions: reduced reproduction. 
In experiments designed to test the influence of temperatures 
on  reproduction,  the  Baurs  observed  reduced  hatching  rates 
of A. arbustorum eggs at temperatures as low as 22°C and no 
hatching of eggs at temperatures of 25°C and above. 

How  might  A.  arbustorum  respond  to  large-scale  cli-
mate  warming? The  Baurs  explored  the  possibility  that  A. 

238 

Section III 

  Population Ecology

arbustorum  may  be  shifting  its  distribution  to  higher 
 elevations  in  Switzerland,  as  the  landscape  warms  (Baur 
and Baur 2013). Because average air temperature is lower at 
higher elevations (see figure 2.38, p. 40), their expectation 
was  that  the  species  would  shift  its  distribution  to  higher 
elevations. 

The Baurs conducted their research in the Swiss National 
Park, established in the Eastern Alps in 1914 to protect nat-
ural  ecosystems  from  disturbance  by  humans  and  domestic 
animals.  The  Swiss  National  Park  was  an  ideal  study  site. 
Working within a protected area was important, since many 
environmental factors besides climate change can potentially 
influence  species  distributions,  for  example,  disturbance  of 
the habitat by human activity. Another critical key element to 
a study, such as the one the Baurs designed, is the existence of 
historical information on species distributions. Because spe-
cies inventories were made soon after the establishment of the 
Swiss  National  Park,  the  Baurs  had  a  basis  for  determining 
whether the distribution of A. arbustorum has changed over 
time. The first inventory of the elevation range of A. arbus-
torum  in  the  park  was  done  in  1916–17,  nearly  a  century 
before the Baurs’ study. Yet another critical piece of informa-
tion for such studies is a reliable long-term weather record. 
Fortunately,  weather  data  have  been  collected  at  a  weather 
station  on  the  edge  of  the  Swiss  National  Park,  just  16  km 
from the study sites, since 1917. The weather records at the 
station show that during the period since the initial studies of 
A. arbustorum, the average annual temperature in the Swiss 
National  Park  has  risen  1.6°C,  while  precipitation  has  not 
changed significantly. 

The  Baurs’  resurvey  revealed  significant  increases  in 
the  upper  elevation  limit  of  A.  arbustorum  along  slopes  in 
the  park.  Over  the  period  since  the  initial  population  sur-
veys,  the  average  upper  elevation  limit  for  A.  arbustorum 
along  eight  mountain  slopes  increased  from  an  average  of 
2,200 m in 1916–17 to 2,361 m in 2011–12, an increase in 

elevation  of  164  m  (fig.  10.23).  In  conclusion,  the  Baurs’ 
research verified significant increases in the upper elevation 
limit of A. arbustorum, a species sensitive to warm tempera-
tures, during a century of climate warming.

However interesting and well documented the patterns of 
change in distribution of A. arbustorum might be, the study 
results are limited to a single species. How might other spe-
cies in the region have responded to climate warming? The 
work of another research group suggests widespread move-
ment upslope by species in the region. This study examined 
changes in the upper elevation limits of over 600 species of 
plants, insects, and birds in the Bavarian Forest National Park 
in  southeastern  Germany,  located  approximately  400  km 
northeast of the Swiss National Park, where the Baurs stud-
ied  A.  arbustorum  (Bässler  et  al.  2013).  Like  the  Baurs’ 
study,  researchers  had  access  to  long-term  weather  data  at 
their study area. The Bavarian Forest National Park is also 
protected from most human disturbance and the upper eleva-
tion  limits  of  species  in  the  park  had  been  documented  in 
1902–04, over a century before Bässler and his colleagues 
conducted  their  study.  In  contrast  to  many  studies  else-
where in central and northern Europe (e.g., see Parolo and 
Rossi 2008), plants did not shift their elevation range in the 
Bavarian Forest National Park. However, the 433 species of 
insects in the study increased their elevation limits an aver-
age of 260 m, while 57 bird species were recorded an aver-
age of 165 m higher than previously. These results suggest 
that large numbers of both vertebrate and invertebrate spe-
cies  are  extending  their  distributions  upslope  with  climate 
warming.

Now let’s turn from elevation responses to changes in 
the  latitudinal  ranges  of  species  over  the  period  of  recent 
warming. As  with  changes  in  elevation,  documenting  lati-
tudinal  changes  depends  on  the  availability  of  baseline 
surveys of earlier distributions. One of the few places with 
extensive long-term records of latitudinal distributions over

a large geographic area is the UK. Researchers have taken 
advantage  of  the  extensive  national  inventory  of  species 
available there to study whether the range limits of species 
have moved northward within the British Isles (Hickling et 
al. 2006). In this study, Rachael Hickling of the University 
of York and colleagues estimated the latitudinal shifts in the 
distributions of 16 groups of organisms ranging from birds, 
mammals, and butterflies to spiders, dragonflies and ground 
beetles  over  a  roughly  25-year  period.  Of  the  329  species 
included in their analysis, 275, or roughly 84%, had shifted 
their ranges northward, 52 had moved southward, while the 
distributions  of  2  species  remained  unchanged.  The  aver-
age shifts in distribution of species in the study ranged from 
31  to  60  km.  These  shifts  translate  into  average  rates  of 
movement  northward  of  approximately  19  km  per  decade. 
 Figure  10.24  shows  the  average  latitudinal  movement  of 
four  well-studied  taxonomic  groups—butterflies,  birds, 
mammals, and ground beetles—during the 25 years covered 
by the study (see fig. 10.24). 

The results of the studies reviewed here and hundreds of 
others have demonstrated changes in population distributions 
in response to well-documented increases in global tempera-
tures over the past century. The distribution of earth’s biota is 
changing as we watch.

  Summary 

  Dispersal can increase or decrease local population den-
sities.   The  contribution  of  dispersal  to  local  population 
density and dynamics is demonstrated by studies of expand-
ing populations of species such as Africanized honeybees in 
the  Americas  and  Eurasian  collared  doves  in  Europe.  Cli-
mate  changes  can  induce  massive  changes  in  the  ranges  of 
species. As availability of prey changes, predators may dis-
perse,  which  increases  and  decreases  their  local  population 
densities.  Stream  organisms  actively  migrating  upstream 
or  drifting  downstream  increase  densities  of  stationary  and 
migrating populations by immigrating and decrease them by 
emigrating. 

  Ongoing dispersal can join numerous subpopulations 
to  form  a  metapopulation.   Populations  of  many  species 
occur not as a single continuously distributed population but 
in spatially isolated subpopulations, with significant exchange 
of  individuals  among  subpopulations. A  group  of  subpopu-
lations  living  on  such  patches  connected  by  exchange  of 
individuals among patches makes up a metapopulation. Popu-
lations of the Rocky Mountain Parnassian butterfly,  Parnas-
sius simintheus,  in Alberta, Canada, and of the lesser kestrel, 
 Falco  naumanni,   are  examples  of  metapopulations.  In  both 
metapopulations  movement  of  individuals  is  predominantly 
from smaller subpopulations to larger subpopulations. 

  A survivorship curve summarizes the pattern of sur-
vival  in  a  population.   Patterns  of  survival  can  be  deter-
mined either by following a cohort of individuals of similar 
age to produce a cohort life table or by determining the age at 
death of a large number of individuals or the age distribution

of a population to produce a static life table. Life tables can 
be used to draw survivorship curves, which generally fall into 
one of three categories: (1) type I survivorship, in which there 
is low mortality among the young but high mortality among 
older individuals; (2) type II survivorship, in which there is 
a fairly constant probability of mortality throughout life; and 
(3)  type  III  survivorship,  in  which  there  is  high  mortality 
among the young and low mortality among older individuals. 
  The age distribution of a population reflects its history 
of survival, reproduction, and potential for future growth.  
Age distributions indicate periods of successful reproduction, 
high  and  low  survival,  and  whether  the  older  individuals  in 
a population are replacing themselves or if the population is 
declining.  Population  age  structure  may  be  highly  compli-
cated  in  variable  environments,  such  as  that  of  the  Galápa-
gos Islands. Populations in highly variable environments may 
reproduce episodically. 

  A life table combined with a fecundity schedule can 
be used to estimate net reproductive rate (  R   0  ), geometric 
rate  of  increase  (l),  generation  time  ( T  ),  and  per  capita 
rate  of  increase  (  r  ).   Because  these  population  parameters 
form the core of population dynamics, it is important to under-
stand their derivation, as well as their biological meaning. Net 
reproductive rate,  R  0 , the average number of offspring left by 
an  individual  in  a  population,  is  calculated  by  multiplying 
age-specific  survivorship  rates,   l   x  ,  times  age-specific  birth-
rates,  m   x  , and summing the results:
 R0 5 ∑ lx mx

240

 The per capita rate of increase may be positive, zero, or nega-

   Recent  studies  have  demonstrated  shifts  in  the  upper 
latitudinal and elevation limits of the ranges of hundreds of 
species in response to the well-documented climate warm-
ing  that  has  occurred  over  the  past  century.  These  range 
shifts provide clear evidence of ecological responses to cli-
mate  change. The  distribution  of  Earth’s  biota  is  changing 
as we watch.

 Review Questions 

    1.  Outline Müller’s (1954, 1974) colonization cycle. If you were 
studying the colonization cycle of the freshwater snail  Neritina 
latissima,  how would you follow colonization waves upstream? 
How would you verify that these colonization waves gain indi-
viduals  from  local  populations  and  contribute  individuals  to 
those same local populations?  

    2.  Compare  cohort  and  static  life  tables.  What  are  the  main 
assumptions of each? In what situations or for what organisms 
would it be practical to use either?  

    3.  Of  the  three  survivorship  curves,  type  III  has  been  the  least 
documented by empirical data. Why is that? What makes this 
pattern of survivorship difficult to study?  

    4.  Population ecologists have assumed that populations of species 
with very high reproductive rates, those with offspring some-
times numbering in the millions per female, must have a type III 
survivorship  curve  even  though  very  few  survivorship  data 
exist for such species. Why is this a reasonable assumption? In 
 general, what is the expected relationship between reproductive 
rate and patterns of survival?  

    5.  Draw  hypothetical  age  structures  for  growing,  declining,  and 
stable populations. Explain how the age structure of a popula-
tion with highly episodic reproduction might be misinterpreted 
as indicating population decline. How might population ecolo-
gists avoid such misinterpretations?  

    6.  Concept 10.5 says that we can use the information in life tables 
and  fecundity  schedules  to  estimate  some  characteristics  of 
populations  ( R  0 ,   T,    r ).  Why  does  Concept  10.5  use  the  word 
“estimate”  rather  than  “calculate”?  In  putting  together  your 

answer, think about the population of  P. drummondii  studied by 
Leverich and Levin (1979). We calculated  R  0  for this population 
by summing the  l   x    m  x  column. When we did, the number we got 
was  R  0   5  2.4177. Assuming that Leverich and Levin accurately 
counted seeds and surviving plants, is 2.4177 an estimate of the 
average reproductive rate of the 996 individual  P. drummondii  
in their study? Right, 2.4177 is not an estimate; it’s the actual 
average number of seeds produced by these 996 individuals. So, 
what’s this estimate business about? If Leverich and Levin had 
studied a second (or third, fourth, etc.) group of 996 individuals 
in their  P. drummondii  population, do you think it’s likely that 
they would have gotten an  R  0  exactly equal to 2.4177?  

    7.  What values of  R  0  indicate that a population is growing, stable, 
or  declining? What  values  of   r   indicate  a  growing,  stable,  or 
declining population?  

    8.  From  a  life  table  and  a  fecundity  schedule,  you  can  estimate 
the geometric rate of increase, l, the average reproductive rate, 
 R  0 , the generation time,  T,  and the per capita rate of increase,  r.  
That is a lot of information about a population. What minimum 
information do you need to construct a life table and fecundity 
schedule?  

    9.  C. S. Holling (1959) observed predator numerical responses to 
changes in prey density. He attributed the numerical responses 
to changes in the reproductive rates of the predators. Discuss a 
hypothetical  example  of  reproductive-rate  numerical  response 
by a population of predators in terms of changes in fecundity 
schedules and life tables. Include the terms  R  0 ,  T,  and  r  in your 
discussion.

   A group of northern elephant seals,  Mirounga angustirostris,  on a breed-

a source of oil, drove the species to near extinction in the nineteenth 
century. With protection from hunting, the population has grown from 
as few as 100 individuals, living off the west coast of Mexico, to over 
160,000, and it continues to grow as the population disperses northward.

LEARNING OUTCOME
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 11.1  List factors influencing population growth in 

aquatic and terrestrial environments.

G iven  suitable  environmental  conditions,  aquatic  and 

terrestrial populations will manifest their great capac-
ity for growth. For instance, each spring, in temper-
ate  seas  and  lakes  around  the  globe,  planktonic  populations 
of  diatoms  take  advantage  of  the  increasing  availability  of 
sunlight and an abundance of nutrients. The numbers of dia-
toms explode as these single-celled protists survive, mature, 
and  reproduce.  In  turn,  populations  of  zooplankton  respond 
to  the  “spring  blooms”  of  diatoms,  on  which  they  feed,  by 
increasing their own numbers ( fig. 11.1 ). Later in the annual 
cycle, the numbers of individuals in the diatom and zooplank-
ton populations decrease, as sunlight and nutrient availability 
declines  and  competition  and  predation  intensities  increase. 
Populations  are  dynamic—increasing  and  decreasing,  in 
response to changes in the biotic and abiotic environments.

 population growth each spring in mid- and high-latitude lakes as 
a result of favorable environmental conditions. Shown here are 
( a ) diatoms and ( b ) a copepod.

 Sizes  of  populations  fluctuate  in  terrestrial,  as  well  as 
aquatic,  environments.  Some  of  the  most  variable  terrestrial 
populations are found on the Galápagos Islands. The sizes of 
populations  on  these  islands  vary  a  great  deal  because  they 
are  subject  to  exceptional  environmental  fluctuations.  Much 
of this fluctuation is produced by a large-scale climatic system 
commonly called El Niño (see chapter 23). El Niño warms the 
waters around the Galápagos Islands and brings higher than 
average  rainfall  once  or  twice  each  decade.  This  increased 
rainfall stimulates the germination and growth of plants. These 
plants produce an abundance of seeds upon which  Darwin’s 
finches depend for food. In response to increased seed produc-
tion,  the  size  of  the  finch  populations  can  grow  several-fold 
in 1 year. However, these same populations are also exposed 
to periodic droughts. During droughts, which can be severe, 
both plant and finch populations decline dramatically. Again, 
whether in the sea or on land, populations are dynamic. 

 In chapter 11 we examine the factors that determine rates 
and patterns of population growth. We also review the envi-
ronmental forces that limit population size. At this juncture in 
history, as our own species places increased pressure on the 
biosphere, there is no more important ecological topic. 

 We look at population growth in the presence of abundant 
resources, growth where resources are  limiting, and how the 
environment can act to change birthrates and death rates. The 
concepts we review reflect the historical development of popu-
lation ecology. That history has involved two complementary 
approaches. One approach uses mathematics to model popula-
tion growth. The second approach focuses on studies of labo-
ratory and natural populations. Our knowledge of population 
growth has progressed through an interplay between modeling 
and observations of actual populations. Let’s turn now to stud-
ies of population growth in the presence of abundant resources.

Population Growth

After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

growth.
Interpret the elements of the equations for geometric 
and exponential population growth.

 11.4  Describe the conditions necessary for exponential 

population growth in natural populations.

 11.5  Explain why exponential population growth by 

natural populations cannot be sustained for many 
generations.

In  the  presence  of  abundant  resources,  populations  can 
grow at geometric or exponential rates.   Suppose a popu-
lation had access to abundant resources, such as food, space, 
nutrients,  and  so  forth.  How  fast  could  it  grow?  Imagine  a 
plant, animal, or bacterial population reproducing at its maxi-
mum reproductive rate. What would the resulting pattern of 
population growth be? Regardless of the species you choose, 
the pattern will be the same. A population growing at its max-
imum rate grows slowly at first and then faster and faster. In 
other words, population growth accelerates. 

 When growing at their maximum rates, some populations 
are said to grow  geometrically  and others  exponentially.  We 
examine what causes these two ways of modeling population 
growth in this section.  

   Geometric Growth 
 Because it is an annual plant, populations of  Phlox drummon-
dii  grow in discrete annual pulses. Populations of insects that 
produce a single generation a year also grow in pulses. Growth 
by any population with pulsed reproduction can be modeled as 
    geometric  population  growth    ,   in  which  successive  genera-
tions differ in size by a constant ratio. 

 We can use the population of  Phlox  studied by Leverich and 
Levin (1979) to build a model of geometric population growth. 
In  chapter  10,  we  calculated  a  geometric  rate  of  increase, 
l 5 Nt 11/Nt, for this population of 2.4177. At the end of that 
discussion, we asked how long the  Phlox  population could con-
tinue growing at this rate. Let’s address that question here. 

 

Chapter 11 

  Population Growth 

243

 As we saw in chapter 10, we can compute the growth of 
a population of organisms whose generations do not over-
lap by simply multiplying  l  times the size of the popula-
tion at the beginning of each generation. The initial size of 
the population studied by Leverich and Levin was 996 (see 
table  10.1)  and  the  number  of  offspring  produced  by  this 
population during their year of study was  N  1   5   N  0   3   l , or 
996   3   2.4177   5   2,408.  Now  let’s  repeat  this  calculation 
for  a  few  generations.  The  population  size  at  the  begin-
ning  of  the  next  generation,   N  2 ,  would  be   N  1    3     l  .  How-
ever, because  N  1   5   N  0   3   l ,  N  2   5   N  0   3   l   3   l , or  N  0   5   l  2 , 
which  is  996   3   2.4177   3   2.4177   5   5,822.  At  the  third 
generation,  N  3 ,  N  0   3   l  3   5  14,076, and in general, the size 
of a population growing geometrically at any time,  t,  can 
be modeled as:

Nt 5 N0lt

    In this model,  N   t   is the number of individuals at any time  t,   N  0  
is the initial number of individuals,  l  is the geometric rate of 
increase, and  t  is the number of time intervals or  generations. 
The interpretation of this model and the definitions of each of 
its terms are summarized in  figure 11.2 . We can use this model 
to project the future size of our hypothetical  Phlox  population. 
Notice in  figure 11.3  that in only 8 years the population has 
grown  from  996  to  1.16   3   10 6 ,  to  over  1  million  individu-
als. By 16 years, the population would be over a billion, by 
24 years the population would top 1 trillion individuals, and 
by year 40 it would increase to over 10 18 , or 1 billion billion 
individuals.     

 We  can  get  a  feeling  for  how  large  this   hypothetical 
 Phlox  population would be by calculating how much space 
the  growing  population  would  occupy.  Since  the   Phlox  
population studied by Leverich and Levin was from Texas, 
let’s  confine  our  hypothetical  population  to  North  Amer-
ica  and  scale  population  growth  against  the  area  of  the 
North  American continent, which is about 24 million km 2 . 
Assuming  a  uniform  density  across  the  continent,  by 
32  years  our  population  would  reach  a  density  of  nearly 
80  million  individuals  per  square  kilometer,  or  about 
80 individuals per square meter across the entire continent, 
from  Southern  Mexico  to  Northern  Canada  and  Alaska. 
Eight years later, the density would be nearly 90,000 indi-
viduals per square meter! 

 There  are  many  reasons  why  this  exercise  is  unreal-
istic.  The  population  would  soon  be  so  dense  that  plants 
would  die  because  they  lacked  sufficient  nutrients,  light, 
and  water;  and  the  population  would  soon  spread  beyond 
the  physical  climates  to  which   P.  drummondii   is  adapted. 
However,  out  of  this  unrealistic  exercise  comes  two  facts 
about  the  natural  world:  Natural  populations  have  a  tre-
mendous  capacity  for  increase,  and  unlimited  population 
growth  cannot  be  maintained  in  any  population  for  very 
many generations. 

 Now let’s consider population growth by organisms such 
as bacteria, forest trees, and humans, which have overlapping 
generations. Because growth by these populations can be con-
tinuous, the geometric model is usually not appropriate.

  Exponential Growth 
 Continuous  population  growth  in  an  unlimited  environment 
can be modeled as     exponential population growth:   

  dN ___ 
dt

   5 rN

The exponential growth equation ( fig. 11.4 ) expresses the rate of 
population growth,  dN/dt,  which is the change in numbers with 
change in time, as the per capita rate of increase,  r,  times popula-
tion size,  N.  The exponential model is appropriate for populations 
with  nonpulsed  reproduction  because  it  represents  population 
growth as a continuous process. In the exponential model,  r  is a 
constant, whereas  N  is a variable. Therefore, as population size, 
 N,  increases, the rate of population increase,  dN/dt,  gets larger 
and larger. The rate of increase gets larger because the constant 
 r  is multiplied by a larger and larger population size,  N.  Conse-
quently, during exponential growth,  dN/dt,  the rate of population 
growth, increases over time.     

Growing geometrically, the number of 
phlox at any point in time can be 
determined using Nt = N0lt or by 
multiplying the previous population 
size by l = 2.4177.

 For  a  population  growing  at  an  exponential  rate,  the 

 population size at any time  t  can be calculated as:

Nt 5 N0ert

In this form of the exponential growth model,  N   t   is the num-
ber of individuals at time  t,   N  0  is the initial number of individ-
uals,  e  is the base of the natural logarithms,  r  is the per capita 
rate of increase, and  t  is the number of time intervals. Notice 
that this form of the exponential model of population growth 
is virtually the same as our equation for geometric growth but 
with  e   r   taking the place of  l , since l 5 er. The two forms of 
the exponential growth equation are presented and explained 
in  figure 11.4 .  

  Exponential Growth in Nature 
 Some  of  the  assumptions  of  the  exponential  growth  model, 
such as a constant rate of per capita increase, may seem a bit 
unrealistic, so it is reasonable to ask whether populations in 
nature ever grow at an exponential rate. The answer is a quali-
fied yes. Natural populations may grow at exponential rates 
for relatively short periods of time in the presence of abundant 
resources. 

  Exponential Growth by Tree Populations 
 As we saw in chapters 1 and 10 (see figs. 1.8 and 10.6), as 
the last ice age was ending, tree populations in the Northern 
Hemisphere followed the retreating glaciers northward. Ecol-
ogists  have  documented  these  movements  by  studying  the 
sediments of lakes, where the pollen of wind-pollinated tree 
species is especially abundant. The appearance of pollen of a 
tree species in a lake sediment is a record of its establishment 
near  the  lake. The  date  of  each  establishment  can  be  deter-
mined using  14C (carbon-14) concentration to determine the 
age of organic matter along a sediment profile. 

 Pollen records have also been used to estimate the growth 
of  several  postglacial  tree  populations  in  Britain.  K.  Bennett 
(1983) estimated population sizes and growth by counting the 
number of pollen grains of each tree species deposited within 
lake sediments. By counting the number of pollen grains per 
square  centimeter  deposited  each  year,  Bennett  was  able  to 
reconstruct  changes  in  tree  population  densities  in  the  sur-
rounding landscape. His study revealed an interesting picture 
of growth by postglacial tree populations in the British Isles. 
Populations of the tree species studied grew at exponential rates 
for 400 to 500 years following their initial appearance in the 
pollen record.  Figure 11.5  shows the exponential increase in 
abundance of Scots pine,  Pinus sylvestris,  which first appeared 
in the pollen record of the study lake about 9,500 years ago.      

  Conditions for Exponential Growth 
 Natural  populations  of  organisms  as  different  as  diatoms, 
whales, and trees can grow at exponential rates. However, as 
different as these organisms are, the circumstances in which 
their populations grow at exponential rates have a great deal 
in common. All begin their exponential growth in favorable 
environments  at  low  population  densities. The  trees  studied 

Pollen 
accumulation 
rate in lake 
sediments 
can be used 
as an index 
of population 
size.

Pollen in lake sediments indicates 
that Scots pine colonized the 
Norfolk region of Great Britain 
about 9,500 years ago.

Following 
colonization, the 
Scots pine 
population grew 
exponentially for 
nearly 500 years.

  Population Growth

by Bennett began at low densities because they were invading 
new  territory  previously  unoccupied  by  the  species.  Spring 
blooms  of  planktonic  diatoms  are  the  result  of  exponential 
population growth in response to seasonal increases in nutri-
ents and light. 

 The whooping crane provides another example of expo-
nential growth following protection and careful management. 
Hunting  and  habitat  destruction  reduced  the  population  of 
whooping cranes to 22 individuals by 1940. At that time, it 
was known that this remnant population of whooping cranes 
winters  on  the  Texas  Gulf  Coast  but  its  northern  breeding 
grounds  were  unknown.  It  was  later  discovered  that  they 
breed in Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada. Under the 
full protection and careful management in both Canada and 
the United States, the migratory whooping crane population 
has grown exponentially from 22 in 1940 to 220 individuals 
in 2005 ( fig. 11.6 ).     

 These  examples  suggest  that  exponential  population 
growth may be very important to populations during the pro-
cess of establishment in new environments, during exploita-
tion of transient, favorable conditions, and during the process 
of recovery from some form of exploitation. However, as we 
saw  with   P.  drummondii,   geometric  or  exponential  growth 
cannot  continue  indefinitely.  In  nature,  population  growth 
must eventually slow and population size level off.  

  Slowing of Exponential Growth 
 As we saw in chapter 10, the Eurasian collared dove,  Strep-
topelia  decaocto,   expanded  beyond  its  historical  range  into 
Western  Europe  during  the  twentieth  century.  As  the  bird 
spread  into  new  territory,  its  populations  grew  at  exponen-
tial  rates  for  a  decade  or  more.  For  instance,  from  1955  to 

Since their protection in 1940, 
the whooping crane population 
grew exponentially from 22 to 
220 individuals in 2005.

Coordinator).

After colonizing, the 
Eurasian collared dove 
population of Great Britain 
grew exponentially.

However, in less than 20 
years population size was 
less than that predicted by 
the exponential model, 
suggesting that population 
growth had slowed.

1972, the expanding population in the British Isles followed a 
typical exponential curve ( fig. 11.7 ). However, if you exam-
ine  figure 11.7  closely, you will see evidence that the rate of 
growth  by  the  Eurasian  collared  dove  population  began  to 
slow by 1970.     

 The pattern for the Eurasian collared dove indicates that 
its population grew at a higher rate, from 1955 to 1964, and 
then, between 1965 and 1970, its rate of population growth 
began to slow. This slowdown suggests that between 1965 and 
1970,  this  invading  population  was  approaching  some  envi-
ronmental  limits.  Environmental  limitation  is  incorporated 
into another model of population growth called     logistic popu-
lation growth    .

(1983) use of pollen deposited in lake sediments to esti-
mate the postglacial population size of Scots pine?  

     2.   Why  do  many  populations  of  exotic  species,  such  as 
zebra  mussels  in  the  Great  Lakes  (see  fig.  3.41b)  or 
Eurasian collared doves in Europe, often grow at expo-
nential rates for some time following their introductions 
into a new environment?  

     3.   African annual killifish live in temporary pools, where 
their  populations  survive  the  dry  season  as  eggs  that 
lie dormant in the mud, developing and hatching only 
when  the  pools  fill  each  wet  season.  In  contrast,  the 
guppy,  a  common  aquarium  fish,  lives  in  populations 
consisting of mixed-age classes in which reproduction 
occurs year-round. Which model of population growth, 
exponential  or  geometric,  would  be  most  appropriate 
for each of these fish species?

Population
grows rapidly.

Growth
slows.

Growth stops;
population size
stabilizes at 
carrying capacity, K.

   As  resources  are  depleted,  population  growth  rate  slows 
and eventually stops.   Obviously, exponential growth cannot 
continue  indefinitely.  Eventually,  populations  run  up  against 
environmental limits to further increase. The effect of the envi-
ronment  on  population  growth  is  reflected  in  the  shapes  of 
population growth curves. As population size increases, growth 
rate eventually slows and then ceases as population size levels 
off. This pattern of growth produces a     sigmoidal    ,  or S-shaped, 
population growth curve    ( fig.  11.8 ). The  population size  at 
which growth stops is generally called     carrying capacity    ,  or 
 K , which is the number of individuals of a particular popula-
tion  that  the  environment  can  support. At  carrying  capacity, 
because  population  size  is  approximately  constant,  birthrates 
must equal death rates and population growth is zero.     

 Sigmoidal growth curves have been observed in a wide 
variety of populations. In the course of his laboratory experi-
ments, G. F. Gause (1934) obtained sigmoidal growth curves 
for  populations  of  several  species  of  yeast  ( fig.  11.9 )  and 
protozoa  ( fig.  11.10 ).  Similar  patterns  of  population  growth 
have been recorded for other populations, including barnacles 
( fig. 11.11 ) and northern elephant seals ( fig. 11.12 ).     

 What  causes  these  populations  to  slow  their  rates  of 
growth and eventually stop growing at carrying capacity? The 
idea behind the concept of carrying capacity is that a given 
environment can only support so many individuals of a par-
ticular  species.  For  the  barnacles  studied  by  J.  H.   Connell 
(1961b),  carrying  capacity  is  largely  determined  by  the 
amount  of  space  available  on  rocks  for  attachment  by  new 
barnacles. Carrying capacity for females in northern elephant 
seal  colonies  also  appears  limited  by  space  on  the  breeding 
beaches  (Le  Beouf  and  Laws  1994).  Yeast  feed  on  sugars 
and produce alcohol. As the density of a population of yeast 
increases, their environment contains less and less sugar and 
more and more alcohol, which is toxic to them. So, yeast pop-
ulations are eventually limited by their own waste products. 
For  most  species,  carrying  capacity  is  likely  determined  by 
a complex interplay among factors such as food, parasitism, 
disease,  and  space. While  we  can  discuss  these  factors  in  a 
general way, the mathematical models of population biology 
help us to discuss population processes more precisely. 

 The  logistic  model  was  proposed  to  account  for  the  pat-
terns of growth shown by populations as they begin to deplete 
environmental resources. Population ecologists built the logistic

growth model by modifying the exponential growth model. The 
exponential  model  of  population  growth,   dN / dt    5    r    N,   can  be 
modified to produce a model in which population growth is sig-
moidal. The simplest way to do this is to add an element that 
slows growth as population size approaches carrying capacity,  K:

 Notice that the per capita rate of increase, rmax, has a subscript 
max. The subscript here indicates that this is the maximum per 
capita rate of increase, achieved by a species under ideal envi-
ronmental  conditions,  where  birthrates,  death  rates,  and  age 
structure are stable. The per capita rate of increase attained under 
such circumstances, rmax, is called the  intrinsic rate of increase 

At low densities the 
yeast population 
grows at a high rate.

At higher densities, 
growth slows and 
then levels off.

(Birch 1948). When we calculated the rate of increase from a 
life table in chapter 10, we determined r, the realized or actual 
per capita rate of increase. As we saw, realized r can be posi-
tive, zero, or negative, depending on environmental conditions. 
Because natural populations are usually subject to factors such 
as disease, competition, and so forth, the actual per capita rate 
of increase, realized r, is generally less than rmax. The inventor 
of this equation for sigmoidal population growth, P. F. Verhulst, 
called it the     logistic equation    (Verhulst and Quetelet 1838). 

 Rearranging the logistic equation shows more clearly the 
influence of population size,  N,  on rate of population growth:

 Figure 11.13   Anatomy of the logistic equation for population growth.

    In  the  logistic  equation,  the  rate  of  population  growth, 
 dN/dt,   slows  as  population  size  increases  because  the  dif-
ference, (1  2   N / K ), becomes a smaller and smaller decimal 
fraction  until   N   equals   K.  When   N   equals   K,   the  right  side 
of the equation becomes zero. Therefore, as population size 
increases,  the  logistic  growth  rate  becomes  a  smaller  and 
smaller  fraction  of  the  exponential  growth  rate  and  when 
 N   5   K,  population growth ceases ( fig. 11.13 ). Logistic popu-
lation growth is highest when  N   5   K /2.     

 The ratio  N / K  has been called the “environmental resis-
tance” to population growth. As the size of a population,  N,

gets closer and closer to carrying capacity, environmental fac-
tors increasingly impede further population growth. 

 In  the  logistic  growth  model,  the  per  capita  rate  of 
increase, which is  r   5   r max  (1  2  N / K )  5   rmax   2    rmax  ( N / K ), 
depends  upon  population  size.  Therefore,  when  population 
size,  N,  is very small, the per capita rate of increase is approx-
imately   rmax .  As   N   increases,  however,  realized   r   decreases 
until  N  equals  K.  At that point, realized  r  is zero. The rela-
tionship between realized  r  and population size in the logistic 
model, which follows a straight line, is shown in  figure 11.14 .     
 The response of per capita rate of increase by  Daphnia 
pulex  (a water flea in the same genus as  D. magna,  which we 
discussed in chapter 10) to population density closely matches 
the assumptions of the logistic growth model. When  D. pulex
are grown at densities ranging from 1 to 32 individuals per 
cubic centimeter,  r  decreases with increasing population size 
( fig.  11.15 ). As  assumed  by  the  logistic  growth  model,  per 
capita  rate  of  increase  was  highest  at  the  lowest  population 
densities. Per capita rate of increase was positive in  D. pulex
populations with densities of 16 individuals per cubic centi-
meter or lower. However, at densities of 24 and 32 individuals 
per cubic centimeter, per capita rate of increase was negative. 
   Ultimately, the environment limits the growth of popula-
tions by modifying birth and death rates. In the following sec-
tion, we examine in detail a few examples of environmental 
effects on population growth.

for the  Paramecium  population shown in  figure 11.10  was 
set by the availability of their main food—yeast cells?

as  a  commercially  important  fish,  want  to  keep  fish

  11.3  Limits to Population Growth 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 11.10  Distinguish between density-independent and 

 density-dependent factors that influence populations.

 11.11  Discuss how biotic and abiotic factors influence 

populations of Darwin’s finches.

The  environment  limits  population  growth  by  changing 
birth and death rates.   Most of us could recite an impres-
sive list of factors affecting the size of populations. Such lists 
generally  include  food,  shelter,  rainfall,  disease,  floods,  and 
predators—a mixture of abiotic and biotic factors. Ecologists 
have  long  been  concerned  with  the  effects  of  environmen-
tal factors such as these on populations. Out of this concern 
came a long period of debate between the champions of the 
importance  of  abiotic  factors  and  those  who  argued  for  the 
importance  of  biotic  factors.  Because  the  effects  of  biotic 
factors,  such  as  disease  and  predation,  are  often  influenced 
by  population  density,  biotic  factors  are  often  referred  to  as 
density-dependent factors    .  Meanwhile, abiotic factors, such 
as floods and extreme temperature, can exert their influences 
independently  of  population  density  and  so  are  often  called 
density-independent  factors    .   However,  many  ecologists 

 

Chapter 11 

  Population Growth 

249

were (and are) quick to point out that abiotic factors can influ-
ence populations in a density-dependent fashion. For instance, 
think of the effect on mortality of an unusually cold period. 
At high population densities, a larger proportion of the popu-
lation may inhabit less-sheltered sites and, so, mortality rate 
in the population is greater at high population density than at 
low population density. Similarly, biotic factors such as dis-
ease, can affect populations in a density-independent way—
for example, a particularly virulent pathogen, such as Dutch 
elm disease, which causes total mortality in infected popula-
tions regardless of their local density. The major point of this 
section is that biotic and abiotic factors act on populations by 
modifying birthrates and death rates. The significance of biotic 
and abiotic factors on populations has been well demonstrated 
by studies of Darwin’s finches and their major food sources.  

   Environment and Birth and Death 
Among Darwin’s Finches 
 Since  Charles  Darwin’s  visit  in  the  1830s,  the  Galápagos 
Islands have continued to provide scientists with a rich source 
of  information  concerning  ecological  and  evolutionary  pro-
cesses. More than two decades ago, Peter Grant and B. Rose-
mary Grant and their students and colleagues began a long-term 
study  of  the  evolution  and  ecology  of  Darwin’s  finches  (see 
chapter 10, pp. 232–233 ). This long-term project has yielded 
information extending well beyond the finch populations and 
the  Galápagos  Islands.  Knowledge  of  the  influences  of  the 
environment  on  birth  and  death  rates  in  natural  populations 
could not have been gained from a short-term study. 

 Highly variable rainfall and responsive plant populations 
provided  the  environmental  setting  for  these  finch  studies 
( fig. 11.16 ). In 1976, P. T. Boag and Peter Grant began a study 
of  the  populations  of  Darwin’s  finches  inhabiting  Daphne 
Major, an island of only 0.4 km 2  situated in the middle of the 
Galápagos Archipelago (Boag and Grant 1984a). The numeri-
cally  dominant  finch  on  Daphne  Major  at  the  beginning  of 
the study was the medium ground finch,  Geospiza fortis,  with 
about 1,200 individuals. In 1977, a drought struck the Galá-
pagos  Islands  and  by  the  end  of  the  year  the  population  of 
 G. fortis  had fallen to about 180 individuals. This decrease rep-
resents a decline in population size of about 85% in just 1 year.     
 Though a few birds may have emigrated to other nearby 
islands, most of this population decline was due to starvation. 
During the drought, the plants that normally produce an annual 
crop of seeds, upon which the finches depend for food, failed 
to  do  so.  From  1977  to  1982,  the  population  of   G.   fortis   on 
Daphne Major averaged about 300 individuals. Then in 1983, 
about  10  times  the  average  amount  of  rainfall  fell  and  the 
population grew to about 1,100 individuals ( fig. 11.17 ). This 
population growth was due to an increased birthrate as a con-
sequence of an abundance of seeds that the adult finches eat 
and an abundance of caterpillars that the finches feed to their 
young  ( fig.  11.18 ).  In  1977,   G.  fortis   populations  declined 
because death rates due to starvation far exceeded birthrates. 
However, the situation was reversed in 1983, when, in the pres-
ence of abundant food, birthrates greatly exceeded death rates. 

(a)

(b)

 Figure 11.16   The abundant rains of 1983 ( a ) greatly increased plant 
growth on the Galápagos Islands compared to ( b ) periods of lower rainfall.

 Over  this  same  period,  Rosemary  Grant  and  Peter  Grant 
(1989)  were  studying  a  population  of  the  large  cactus  finch, 
 Geospiza  conirostris,   on  Genovesa,  a  small,  highly  isolated 
island  in  the  extreme  northeastern  portion  of  the  Galápagos 
 Archipelago.  The  study  continued  from  1978  to  1988,  long 
enough for the researchers to observe the effects of two droughts 
and two wet periods on reproductive biology. In this population of 
cactus finches, there was a positive correlation between the num-
ber of clutches of eggs laid by birds and the total annual rainfall 
( fig. 11.19 ). This study also showed how wet and drought cycles 
and cactus finches affect populations of prickly pear cactus.     

  Rainfall, Cactus Finches, 
and a Cactus Population 
 Darwin’s finches harvest a variety of foods from several spe-
cies of prickly pear cactus. Two species of finches,  Geospiza 
scandens  and  G. conirostris,  are well-known specialists on 
cacti. The Grants documented several ways in which these 
finches make use of cacti, including (1) opening flower buds 
in  the  dry  season  to  eat  pollen,  (2)  consuming  nectar  and 
pollen from mature flowers, (3) eating a seed coating called 
the aril, (4) eating seeds, and (5) eating insects from rotting 
cactus pads and from underneath bark. In return, the finches 
disperse some cactus seeds and pollinate cactus flowers.

 Investigating the Evidence  11 

 Frequency of Alternative Phenotypes in a Population 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 11.12  Explain the chi-square goodness of fit test.
 11.13  Interpret the statistical significance of results of a chi-

square goodness of fit test using a statistical table.

 Ecologists  often  ask  questions  about  observed  frequencies 
of individuals in a population relative to some theoretical or 
expected frequencies. For example, an ecologist studying the 
nesting habits of Darwin’s finches may be interested in the fre-
quency at which finches nest in alternative nest sites relative to 
the availability of the alternative nest sites in the environment. 
Another ecologist studying the habitat association of a plant 
may be interested in its relative frequencies in sandy, loamy, or 
clay soils. An ecologist studying the mating behavior of some 
species may want to determine whether alternative male phe-
notypes (males with different physical and/or behavioral char-
acteristics) occur at different frequencies in the population. 

 A common method to test hypotheses concerning the rela-
tionship between observed and hypothesized frequencies is the 
   chi-square  ( x  2 )   “goodness of fit” test. This test is used to judge 
how well an observed distribution of frequencies matches one 
“expected” from a particular hypothesis. Let’s explore this test 
using the frequency of alternative male phenotypes in a popula-
tion of side-blotched lizards,  Uta stansburiana.  Barry Sinervo 
(Sinervo and Lively 1996) found that males in populations of 
side-blotched lizards of the coastal range of central California 
include three male phenotypes: very aggressive orange-throat 
males,  moderately  aggressive  blue-throat  males,  and  sneaker 

yellow-throat  males.  Sinervo  and  his  colleagues  also  found 
that these three male phenotypes vary in their frequencies over 
time.  Let’s  consider  the  following  hypothetical  table  of  data 
from a population and test the hypothesis that the three male 
phenotypes are present in equal frequencies in the population.

 Before proceeding with our test, let’s reflect on what we are 
doing. We would like to know if there are differences in the 
frequencies  of  male  phenotypes  in  this  population  of  side-
blotched  lizards.  So,  we  went  out  and  obtained  a  sample  of 
51 males from the population. This sample included 12 orange-
throat males, 30 blue-throat males, and 9 yellow-throat males. 
Our  sample  is  an  estimate  of  the  actual  frequencies  of  the 
three  phenotypes  in  the  larger  population  that  we  are  study-
ing. Because our hypothesis is that there are no differences in 
frequencies among the male phenotypes, the “expected” fre-

quencies, in the third column of our table, are equal     (   51 ___ 

   5 17 ) .

   Let’s  use  the  chi-square  ( x  2 )  “goodness  of  fit”  test  to 
determine  how  well  our  observed  frequency  distribution 
matches the expected frequency distribution. The value of  x  2  
is calculated as follows:

The next step in the chi-square test is to determine whether the 
difference between observed and expected values, as indexed 
by  our  calculated   x  2   is  “significant.”  We  determine  signifi-
cance by comparing our calculated value of  x  2  with a table of 
 x  2  values, which are included in most statistics textbooks. In 
order to find the appropriate, or critical, value of  x  2  from such 
a table, we need to know two things. First, we need to choose a 
level of significance, which, as we saw in chapter 10 (p. 236), 
is generally P , 0.05. Second, we need to know the “degrees 
of freedom,” which, in this case, is the number of male pheno-
types (3), or  n  minus 1.

  What does “degrees of freedom” mean? It is the number of 
values we can pick freely without being constrained by other

values within a set. In the case of the frequency of three male 
phenotypes, given a particular sample size, once we know the 
frequencies of two of the phenotypes, we automatically know 
the third. For instance, with a sample of 51 lizards, once we 
determine that there are 12 orange-throat males and 30 blue-
throat  males  in  our  sample,  the  frequency  of  yellow-throat 
males is constrained to be 9. So, in this sample of three male 
phenotypes, there are two degrees of freedom. 

 In  a  table  of  critical  values  of  chi-square  (see  p.  532), 
you  will  find  that  for  a  significance  level  of  P   5   0.05  and 
2 degrees of freedom, the critical  x  2  value is 5.991. Since our 
calculated value of  x  2  (15.17) is greater than 5.991, we reject 
the hypothesis that the three male phenotypes are present in 
equal frequencies in our study population. In other words, we 
have evidence of significant differences in frequency among 
the three phenotypes. And, we can attach a probability state-
ment to this conclusion, which is P < 0.05. 

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  11 
     1.  Would the results of the goodness of fit analysis described 
here have been significant if we had chosen a significance 
level of P  5  0.01?  

    2.  Suppose Sinervo and Lively study another population of 
side-blotched  lizards  in  which  there  are  five  male  phe-
notypes.  If  they  did  a  “goodness  of  fit”  analysis  to  test 
for an equal distribution of males among phenotypes in 
this  population,  what  would  be  the  degrees  of  freedom 
for their test and what would be the critical value of  x  2  
for P  5  0.05?

conirostris,  on Genovesa Island (data from Grant and Grant 1989).

  Finches  also  damage  many  cactus  flowers,  however. 
When they open flower buds or partially opened flowers, they 
snip the style and destroy the stigmas. As a consequence, the 
ovules of these flowers cannot be fertilized and they do not 
produce seeds. The Grants found that up to 78% of a popula-
tion of flowers can be damaged in this way. These activities, 
which take place during the wet season, may reduce the seeds 
available to finches during the dry season. 

  Opuntia helleri,  one of the main sources of food for cac-
tus finches on Genovesa Island, was negatively impacted by 
the El Niño of 1983. This El Niño damaged the cacti in three 
ways: (1) Many  O. helleri  simply absorbed so much water that 
their roots could no longer support them and they were blown 
over by wind; (2)  O. helleri  on sea cliffs were bathed in salt 
spray during the many storms that hit the island during 1983, 
which may have produced osmotic stress (see chapter 5); and 
(3)  increased  rainfall  stimulated  growth  by  a  fast-growing 
vine that smothered many  O. helleri  ( fig. 11.20 ). Though out-
right mortality of the cactus was not common, flower and fruit 
production was severely reduced for several years. 

 Reduced  reproductive  output  by   O.  helleri   was  at  least 
partly due to the activities of the cactus finches on Genovesa. 
The stigma snipping behavior of cactus finches was especially 
damaging during the drought years of 1984 and 1985. Dur-
ing  normal  years,  stigma  damage  is  mainly  confined  to  the 
early part of the wet season from January to March. During 
the extremely wet 1983 season, there was very little damage 
to the stigmas of cactus flowers. However, during the drought 
years of 1984 and 1985, up to 95% of stigmas were snipped 
( fig.  11.21 ). This  extensive  damage  to  flowers  helped  delay 
recovery  of  flower  and  fruit  production  until  1986,  when 
another El Niño brought heavy rains to the Galápagos Islands.     
 Populations  of  Darwin’s  finches  and  their  food  plants 
are  an  instructive  model  of  how  the  environment  can  affect 
birth  and  death  rates.  Sometimes,  as  when  the  cactus  fell

increased mortality of the cactus  Opuntia helleri  on Genovesa Island. 

because  they  were  engorged  with  water  during  the  El  Niño 
of 1983, the effect of the physical environment is clear and 
direct.  Sometimes,  as  when   G.  fortis   starved  in  response  to 
reduced seed supplies during the drought of 1977, the effect 
of the physical environment on a population is clearly medi-
ated  through  a  biological  resource  (in  this  case,  seeds).  In 
other  cases,  such  as  reduced  fruit  production  by   O.  helleri  
on  Genovesa,  populations  respond  to  a  complex  mixture  of 
abiotic (drought) and biotic (damage by finches) factors that 
are themselves interrelated. The message to remember from 
these  detailed  studies  is  that  both  biotic  and  abiotic  factors 
have important influences on birth and death rates in popula-
tions and that their effects are often tightly interconnected. In 
the  examples  just  presented,  environmental  variation  essen-
tially  changed  the  carrying  capacity  ( K )  of  the  environment 
for Darwin’s finch populations. In section II, we focused on 
how  various  aspects  of  the  physical  environment  affect  the

performance of organisms, including their reproductive per-
formance.  In  chapters  13,  14,  and  15  of  section  IV  we  will 
consider at length how biological interactions affect popula-
tions.  Before  we  do  that,  however,  let’s  use  the  population 
concepts we’ve reviewed to examine human populations. 

  Concept 11.3 Review 

1.   Why can we be sure that all animal and plant popula-

tions are under some form of environmental control?  

2.   What appears to set the carrying capacity for medium 

ground finches on Daphne Major Island?  

3.   Why might medium ground finch population responses to 
short-term, episodic increases in rainfall (see  fig. 11.17 ) 
differ from their responses to increases in rainfall lasting 
for years or decades?

 The Human Population 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 11.14  Describe the distribution of the global population 

among earth’s major regions.

 11.15  Distinguish between stable, declining, and growing 

populations, using age distributions.

 11.16  Compare the influences of births, deaths, immigra-

tion, and emigration on national populations.

 11.17  Discuss trends in global population size and growth 

rates.

 Most  of  the  significant  environmental  problems  on  earth 
today trace their origins to the effects of the human popula-
tion on the environment. Therefore, it is very important that 
students of ecology be familiar with the history, current state, 
and projected growth of human populations. Let’s use some 
of the conceptual tools we discussed in chapters 9 and 10 and 
in this chapter to review patterns of human distribution and 
abundance, population dynamics, and growth.    

  Distribution and Abundance 
 One  of  the  most  distinctive  features  of  the  human  popula-
tion  is  its  distribution.  Our  species  is  virtually  everywhere. 
We  occupy  all  the  continents—even  the  Antarctic  includes 
a  population  of  scientists  and  support  staff—and  most  oce-
anic  islands.  What  other  species,  except  those  dependent 
upon  humans,  is  so  ubiquitous?  Except  for  the  Antarctic 
population, the current distribution of humans did not require 
modern technological advances. People with stone-age tech-
nology  nearly  reached  the  present  limits  of  our  distribution 
over 10,000 years ago. Colonization of only the most isolated 
oceanic islands had to await the development of sophisticated 
navigational techniques by the Polynesians and Europeans. 

 Like other populations, human populations are highly 
clumped at large scales (see chapter 9). In 2011, 60.3% of 
the  global  population,  or  about  4.2  billion  people,  were 
concentrated  in  Asia  ( fig.  11.22 ).  In  turn,  most  Asians 
live in two countries, China and India, the most populous 
countries on the planet. The remainder of the human pop-
ulation is spread across Africa (15.0%), Europe (10.6%), 
North  America  (6.7%),  and  South  and  Central  America 
and  the  Caribbean  (6.9%).  The  remainder  (0.5%)  live  in 
Oceania  (Australia,  New  Zealand,  and  scattered  oceanic 
islands).     

 Within continents, human populations attain their highest 
densities  in  eastern,  southeastern,  and  southern Asia.  Other 
areas of high population density include western and central 
Europe, northern and western Africa, and eastern and west-
ern North America. The patterns shown in  figure 11.23  sug-
gest that the highest human population densities are in coastal 
areas and along major river valleys.     

 There is even more variation in human population den-
sity  if  viewed  on  a  smaller  scale.  Within  Asia,  Singapore 
has  a  population  density  of  over  6,900  persons  per  square 
kilometer, while Mongolia has a population density of only 
2 persons per square kilometer. This is slightly less than the 
density  on  the  continent  of Australia,  which  is  2.8  persons 
per  square  kilometer. Within  Europe, The  Netherlands  har-
bors nearly 500 persons per square kilometer, while Greece 
has a population density of about 80 per square kilometer. In 
North America, the United States has an average population 
density of about 30 per square kilometer. However, most of 
this  population  is  concentrated  east  of  the  Mississippi  and 
on the West Coast. On a state-by-state basis, population den-
sity  within  the  United  States  varies  from  that  of  New  Jer-
sey,  with  approximately  450  people  per  square  kilometer, 
to Alaska,  with  a  density  of  less  than  1  person  per  square 
kilometer.  Meanwhile  Canada  has  an  average  population 
density of about 3.7 per square kilometer. Again, on a large 
scale, human populations are highly clumped and as a con-
sequence,  population  density  is  highly  variable.  Population 
dynamics also vary a great deal.

  Population Dynamics 
 Population  dynamics  vary  widely  from  region  to  region  and 
from  country  to  country.  Let’s  examine  the  age  distributions, 
birthrates, and death rates of three countries that have stable, 
declining, and rapidly growing populations. As we saw in chap-
ter 10, population ecologists can surmise a great deal about a 
population  by  examining  its  age  distribution.  Sweden  has  an 
age distribution that is approximately the same width near its 
base as it is higher up ( fig. 11.24 ). This indicates that the indi-
viduals in this population are producing just enough offspring 
to approximately replace losses due to death. Compare this dis-
tribution with that of Hungary. The age distribution of Hunga-
ry’s population is much narrower at its base, which indicates a 
declining population. In contrast, the very broad base of Rwan-
da’s age distribution indicates a rapidly growing population.     

 The  impressions  we get by examining  the age distribu-
tions  of  these  three  countries  are  confirmed  if  we  calculate 
their birthrates and death rates. In 2011, the annual per capita 
birthrate,  b,  of Sweden’s population was 0.010. This exactly 
matched the death rate,  d,  in Sweden’s population, which was 
0.010.  If  we  subtract  Sweden’s  death  rate  from  its  birthrate 
(0.010  2  0.010), the result is a zero per capita rate of increase, 
 r,  of 0.000. In contrast, Hungary’s birthrate (0.010) was lower 
than its death rate (0.013), which results in a per capita rate 
of increase,  r,  of  2 0.003. This negative value for  r  confirms 
our impression that Hungary’s population is declining. At the 

other  end  of  the  population  dynamics  spectrum,  Rwanda’s 
population had a birthrate that was over two times its death 
rate. As a consequence, this country’s annual per capita rate 
of increase is 0.027, which is strongly positive growth. Let’s 
move from these estimates of the present rates of change to 
examine the longer-term population trends in these countries. 

  Population Growth 
  Figure 11.25  presents the historical and projected populations 
of Sweden, Hungary, and Rwanda. In 1950, the population of 
Rwanda was much smaller than either Hungary’s or Sweden’s 
population.  Rwanda’s  population  is  projected  to  continue 
growing  and  to  exceed  that  of  Hungary  and  Sweden  in  the 
year  2020.  Meanwhile,  Sweden’s  population  is  expected  to 
stabilize and then decline gradually, while the population of 
Hungary declines at a faster rate.   

 If you look carefully at the population trend for Sweden, 
you will see that its population was still growing after 2011, 
when  r   5  0 (see  fig. 11.24 ). How can a population’s births and 
deaths balance perfectly, as in Sweden, yet still show positive 
growth? We encountered the answer to this question in chap-
ter  10,  where  we  discussed  population  size  as  the  outcome 
of the balance between numbers of births, B, immigrants, I, 
deaths, D, and emigrants, E:

   Nt 5 Nt21 1 B 1 I 2 D 2 E  

b =  birthrate = 0.010
d = death rate = 0.010
b – d = r = 0.000

The age distribution and zero per 
capita rate of increase (r) indicate 
that Sweden’s population is stable.

Rwanda’s population,
the smallest in 1950...

...was the largest
by 2010 and...

...is projected to
be 3x larger by
2050.

 Figure 11.25    Historical and projected populations of Sweden, 
Hungary, and Rwanda. While the population of Sweden stabilizes and 
Hungary’s declines slowly, Rwanda’s population grows rapidly (data 
from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, International Data Base 2011). 

 In short, we need to consider more than just births and deaths 
to understand and predict population trends. Sweden’s popu-
lation is growing slowly as a result of immigration. Immigra-
tion makes a significant contribution to population trends in 
most  developed  countries  but  especially  those  of  the  Euro-
pean Union along with the United States, Canada, and Aus-
tralia. Meanwhile, emigration results in losses of individuals 
from the populations of many less-developed nations. 

 How is the global population changing? While the popula-
tions of many developed countries are either stable or declining, 
those of most developing countries are growing, and the trend 
for the entire global population is continued growth. As shown 
in  figure 11.26 a   ,  global population growth has been extremely 
rapid during the past 500 years. In fact, at times global popula-
tion growth has exceeded exponential rates. How can that be? 
Recall that in exponential growth, the per capita rate of increase, 
 r,  is constant (see  fig. 11.4 ). However, for some time prior to the 
middle 1960s, the rate of growth for the global population was 
not constant, but increased as our population grew ( fig. 11.26 b  )!     
 There are signs that global population growth is slowing. 
While the global population continues to grow, it is not now 
growing exponentially. The  rate  of global population growth 
has declined substantially over the past 40 years, as shown in 
 figure 11.26 b   .  The size of the global population is not rising 
as steeply as it once was and is projected to level off sometime 
after the middle of the twenty-first century.  Figure 11.26  b  also 
displays the proximate cause of this leveling off in population 
size, a decline in annual growth of the global population. The 
rate of annual growth by the global population rose steadily 
from 1950 to 1957 and then took a sharp dip during a major 
famine in China that lasted from 1958 to 1961, resulting in 
the deaths of an estimated 16 to 33  million Chinese. Annual 
growth rate, which peaked from 1962 to 1963 at 2.23%, has

 Figure 11.26   Temporal perspectives on global population growth: ( a ) very rapid growth during the past 2,000 years is evident but ( b ) the past 
40 years have been a period of slowing growth by the global human population; growth is projected to continue to slow over the next half century (data 
from the United Nations Population Information Network and the U.S. Bureau of the Census, International Data Base 2011).

been decreasing in the four decades since, reaching 1.15% in 
2008. The  global  growth  rate  is  projected  to  decline  to  less 
than  0.5%  by  2050.  However,  this  is  a  projection  based  on 
current  conditions  and  recent  dynamics  of  the  global  and 
regional populations. Since rates of growth in human popula-
tions are currently very dynamic, projections of future global 
population  sizes  are  being  adjusted  frequently.  During  the 
past 5 years, most of these adjustments have produced low-
ered estimates of future global population size. Nevertheless, 
the  cost  that  the  present  human  population  exacts  upon  the 

global  environment  is  already  substantial  (see  chapter  23). 
However,  size  alone  is  insufficient  for  estimating  the  envi-
ronmental impact of a human population. Such impact results 
from a combination of population size  and  per individual use 
of resources. If you factor in resource use, it turns out that the 
populations  of  developed  countries,  on  average,  use  natural 
resources at a rate eight times higher than the populations of 
developing countries (WWF 2006). One of the greatest envi-
ronmental  challenges  of  the  twenty-first  century  will  be  to 
establish a sustainable global population.      

   Summary 

  In the presence of abundant resources, populations can 
grow  at  geometric  or  exponential  rates.  
 Population 
growth  by  organisms  with  pulsed  reproduction  can  be 
described  by  the  geometric  model  of  population  growth. 
Population  growth  that  occurs  as  a  continuous  process,  as 
in human or bacterial populations, can be described by the 
exponential model of population growth. Examples of expo-
nential  growth  from  natural  populations  suggest  that  this 
type of growth may be very important to populations during 
establishment  in  new  environments,  during  recovery  from 
some  form  of  exploitation,  or  during  exploitation  of  tran-
sient, favorable conditions. 

  As  resources  are  depleted,  population  growth  rate 
slows  and  eventually  stops.   As  population  size  increases, 
population growth eventually slows and then ceases, producing 
a sigmoidal, or S-shaped, population growth curve. Population 

growth stops when populations reach a maximum size called 
the carrying capacity, the number of individuals of a particular 
population that the environment can support. Sigmoidal pop-
ulation  growth  can  be  modeled  by  the  logistic  growth  equa-
tion,  a  modification  of  the  exponential  growth  equation  that 
includes  a  term  for  environmental  resistance.  In  the  logistic 
model, the rate of population growth decreases as population 
density  increases.  Research  on  laboratory  populations  indi-
cates that zero population growth at carrying capacity may be 
attained by many combinations of birth and death rates. 

  The environment limits population growth by chang-
ing birth and death rates.   The factors affecting  population 
size and growth include biotic factors such as food, disease, 
and predators and abiotic factors such as rainfall, floods, and 
temperature. Because the effects of biotic factors, such as dis-
ease and predation, are often influenced by population density, 

 

Chapter 11

biotic factors are often referred to as density- dependent fac-
tors. Meanwhile, abiotic factors such as floods and extreme 
temperature can exert their influences independently of popu-
lation density and so are often called density-independent fac-
tors. As we have already seen, both abiotic and biotic forces 
have  important  influences  on  populations.  The  significant 
effects of biotic and abiotic factors on populations have been 
well  demonstrated  by  studies  of  Darwin’s  finches  and  their 
major food sources. 

 The present state of the human population can be exam-
ined  using  the  conceptual  tools  of  population  biology  dis-
cussed in chapters 9 and 10 and in chapter 11. Though humans 
live  on  every  continent,  their  population  density  differs  by 

several  orders  of  magnitude  in  different  regions.  In  2011, 
60.3% of the global population, or about 4.2 billion people, 
were  concentrated  in  Asia.  The  remainder  of  the  human 
population was spread across Africa (15%), Europe (10.6%), 
North America  (6.7%),  South  and  Central America  and  the 
Caribbean (6.9%), and Oceania (0.5%). Population densities 
in different regions vary from less than 1 person per square 
kilometer to nearly 7,000 persons per square kilometer. While 
the  populations  of  some  countries  are  stable,  and  some  are 
declining, the global population is expected to continue grow-
ing  past  the  year  2050.  One  of  the  greatest  environmental 
challenges  of  the  twenty-first  century  will  be  to  establish  a 
sustainable global human population.

  Review Questions 

     1.  For what types of organisms is the geometric model of popu-
lation growth appropriate? For what types of organisms is the 
exponential model of population growth appropriate? In what 
circumstances  would  a  population  grow  exponentially?  In 
what circumstances would a population not grow exponentially?  
    2.  While populations of gray and blue whales have grown rapidly, 
the North Atlantic right whale population remains dangerously 
small despite many decades of complete protection. Assuming 
that  differences  in  population  growth  rates  are  determined  by 
whale life histories and not by external factors such as pollu-
tion,  what  information  would  you  need  to  explain  the  slower 
growth by the right whale populations? (Hint: Female gray and 
blue whales give birth every 2 years, whereas right whales give 
birth only every 4 to 7 years.)  

    3.  How  do  you  build  the  logistic  model  for  population  growth 
from the exponential model? What part of the logistic growth 
equation produces the sigmoidal growth curve?  

    4.  In question 3, you thought about how the logistic growth equa-
tion produces a sigmoidal growth curve. Now, let’s think about 
nature. What is it about the natural environment that produces 
sigmoidal  growth?  Pick  a  real  organism  living  in  an  environ-
ment with which you are familiar and list the things that might 
limit the growth of its population.  

    5.  What is the relationship between per capita rate of increase,  r,  
and the intrinsic rate of increase,  rmax?  In chapter 10, we esti-
mated  r  from the life tables and fecundity schedules of two spe-
cies. How would you estimate  rmax?   

    6.  Both  abiotic  and  biotic  factors  influence  birthrates  and  death 
rates  in  populations.  Make  a  list  of  abiotic  and  biotic  factors 
that are potentially important regulators of natural populations.  
    7.  Population biologists may refer to abiotic factors, such as tem-
perature  and  moisture,  as  density-independent  because  such 
factors can affect population processes independently of local 
population  density.  At  the  same  time,  biotic  factors,  such  as 
disease  and  competition,  are  called  density-dependent  factors 
because their effects may be related to local population density. 
Explain how abiotic factors can influence populations in a way 
that is independent of local population density. Explain why the 
influence of a biotic factor is often affected by local population 
density. Now, explain how the impact of an abiotic factor may 
also  be  affected  by  the  local  population  density,  that  is,  may 
behave at least partly as a density-dependent factor.  

    8.  Where on earth is human population density highest? Where is 
it lowest? Where on earth do no people live? Where are human 
populations growing the fastest? Where are they approximately 
stable?  

    9.  What  factors  will  determine  the  earth’s  carrying  capacity  for 
 Homo sapiens?  Explain why the earth’s long-term (thousands 
of  years)  carrying  capacity  for  the  human  population  may  be 
much  lower  than  the  projected  population  size  for  the  year 
2050. Now argue the other side. Explain how the numbers pro-
jected for 2050 might be sustained over the long term.

After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 12.1  Describe the concept of life history and some of its 

components.

D ifferent species, often living side-by-side, reproduce 

at vastly different rates over lifetimes that may differ 
by several orders of magnitude. On a rare sunny day in 

   Migrating sockeye salmon,  Oncorhynchus   nerka,  leaping Brooks Falls, 
in Katmai National Park, Alaska. These sockeye salmon will spawn 
within a lake or tributary stream then die. Their offspring will spend up 
to 3 years in a lake before migrating to the ocean, where they will grow 
rapidly, maturing in 1 to 4 years before returning to the area where they 
hatched, completing the sockeye life cycle.  

  CHAPTER CONCEPTS 

   12.1  Because all organisms have access to 
limited energy and other resources, 
there is a trade-off between the number 
and size of offspring; those that produce 
larger offspring are constrained to 
produce fewer, whereas those that 
produce smaller offspring may produce 
larger numbers.

temperate rain forest, a redwood tree,  Sequoia  sempervirens,
shades  a  nearby  stream.  Bathed  in  fog  all  summer,  soaked 
by rain during fall, winter, and spring, the redwood has lived 
through  2,000  annual  cycles.  The  tree  was  well  established 
when Rome invaded Britain and had produced seeds for 1,000 
years  when William  the  Conqueror  invaded  the  island  from 
across the English Channel. It was 1,800 years old when rag-
tag colonials wrenched an American territorial prize from Wil-
liam’s heirs, claiming it as their own country. Within a mere 
century the descendants of the colonial rebels had expanded 
their territory 3,000 kilometers westward and were chopping 
down redwood trees for lumber. Other human populations had 
long lived near the base of the tree and had cut some trees. 
However,  no  population  had  been  so  relentless  as  the  new-
comers who stripped vast areas of all trees. Somehow, before 
all the redwoods were gone the cutting stopped and the grove 
of the giant redwood was protected. With luck the tree would 
live through several more centuries of summer fog and winter 
rain, during which the human order of the world would surely 
change many times more. 

 On  this  summer  morning  other  life  was  stirring  in  the 
nearby stream. A female mayfly along with thousands of oth-
ers of her species were shedding their larval exoskeletons as 
they transformed from their robust crawling aquatic stage to 
graceful flying adults ( fig. 12.1 ). As a larva, the mayfly had 
lived in the stream for a year, but her adult stage would last 
just this 1 day, during which she would mate, deposit her eggs 
in the stream, and then die. She had just this one chance to 
successfully  complete  her  life  cycle.  For  an  adult  mayfly, 
there is no tomorrow—one chance and no more. As the may-
flies swarmed, some would be eaten by birds nesting in alder 
trees that grew along the stream, and some would be caught 
by bats that found roosting sites on the giant redwood. Some 
of the mayflies would be eaten by fish that they had success-
fully eluded for a year of larval life, and still others would be 
snared by spiders that spun their webs in azalea shrubs that 
grew between the alders and the redwood. However, this par-
ticular mayfly escaped all predators, mated, and laid her eggs.   
 Spent by the effort of depositing her eggs, the mayfly was 
caught by the current and washed downstream. Fifty meters 
from where she emerged that morning, the mayfly was taken 
from the surface by a trout as she floated past an old redwood 
log where the trout sheltered. The small splash of the feeding 

 Figure 12.1    Adult mayflies generally live 1 day only. 

trout caught the attention of a man and a woman who had been 
studying the stream. They knew the stream well and knew the 
pool where the big trout lived and they knew the trout, which 
they had tried to catch many times. Their grandparents’ gen-
eration had cut the redwood forests. Later, their parents had 
worked to protect this remnant grove. The man and woman 
had played in the grove as children and courted there as young 
adults. Now that their own children were grown, they fished 
the stream frequently, sharing the place once again. 

 Redwood, mayfly, fish, and humans—lives intertwined in a 
web of ecological relationships but vastly different in scale and 
timing. All four are players in an ecological and evolutionary 
drama stretching into a vast past and into an unknown future. 
Made of the same elements and with their genetic inheritance 
encoded by DNA of the same basic structure, the four species 
have inherited vastly different lives. While the redwood has pro-
duced seeds numbering in the millions over a lifetime that has 
stretched for millennia, the mayfly spends a year in the stream 
and then emerges to lay eggs that will number in the hundreds. 
The  trout’s  spawn  has  numbered  in  the  thousands,   deposited 
during  the  several  years  of  her  life.  Meanwhile  the  man  and 
woman  have  produced  two  children  during  their  lifetime, 
investing time and energy into them over a period of decades. 

 What are the selective forces that created and maintain this 
vast  range  of  biology?  Under  what  conditions  will  organisms 
mature at an early age and small size instead of later at a larger 
size? What are the costs and benefits of producing millions of 
tiny offspring, such as the seeds of the redwood tree, versus a 
few that are large and well cared for? These are the sorts of ques-
tions pondered by ecologists who study      life history    .  Life history 
consists of the adaptations of an organism that influence aspects 
of its biology, such as the number of offspring it produces, its 
survival, and its size and age at reproductive maturity. Chapter 12 
discusses some of the central concepts of life history ecology.  

  12.1   Offspring Number Versus Size 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 12.2  List several plant growth forms.
 12.3  Describe the general relationship between the size 
and number of offspring produced by an organism.

 12.4  Discuss the evolutionary implications of the positive 

relationship between the number of eggs produced 
and gene flow in darter species.

 12.5  Explain the reasons for the parallel relationship between 

the size and number of offspring in fish and plants.

 12.6  Predict the size and number of seeds produced by 

plants associated mainly with disturbed habitats.

Because  all  organisms  have  access  to  limited  energy  and 
other  resources,  there  is  a  trade-off  between  the   number 
and size of offspring; those that produce larger offspring 
are  constrained  to  produce  fewer,  whereas  those  that 
produce  smaller  offspring  may  produce  larger   numbers.

Section III 

  Population Ecology

The  discussions  of  photosynthetic  response  by  plants  (see 
figs. 7.20, 7.21) and functional response by foraging animals 
(see figs. 7.22, 7.23, 7.24) led us to conclude that all organ-
isms take in energy at a limited rate. As we saw, rate of energy 
intake is limited either by conditions in the external environ-
ment, such as food availability, or by internal constraints, such 
as the rate at which the organism can process food. These con-
straints  are  fundamental  to  the  principle  of  allocation  which 
was introduced in chapter 5 (see p. 104). The principle of allo-
cation underscores the fact that if an organism uses energy for 
one function such as growth, it reduces the amount of energy 
available for other functions such as reproduction. This tension 
between  competing  demands  for  resources  leads  inevitably 
to trade-offs between functions. One of those is the trade-off 
between number and size of offspring. Organisms that produce 
many offspring are constrained, because of energy limitation, to 
produce smaller offspring (seeds, eggs, or live young). Viewed 
from  the  opposite  perspective,  organisms  that  produce  large, 
well-cared-for  offspring  are  constrained  to  produce  fewer. 
Let’s begin our review of examples bearing on this generaliza-
tion with a survey of patterns among fish, a vertebrate group 
with especially large variation in life history characteristics.  

   Egg Size and Number in Fish 
 Because of their great diversity (more than 20,000 described 
species) and the wide variety of environments in which they 
live, fish offer many opportunities for studies of life history. 
Kirk Winemiller (1995) pointed out that fish show more varia-
tion in many life history traits than any other group of  animals. 
For  instance,  the  number  of  offspring  they  produce  per 
brood—that is, their clutch size—ranges from the one or two 
large live young produced by mako sharks to the 600  million 
eggs  per  clutch  laid  by  the  ocean  sunfish.  However,  many 
variables other than offspring number and size change from 
sharks  to  sunfish.  Therefore,  more  robust  patterns  of  varia-
tion can be obtained by analyzing relationships within closely 
related species, such as within families or genera. 

 In  a  study  of  gene  flow  among  populations  of  darters, 
small  freshwater  fish  in  the  perch  family,  or  Percidae,  Tom 
Turner and Joel Trexler tried to determine the extent to which 
life history differences among species might influence gene 
flow between populations. Turner and Trexler (1998) pointed 
out  that  in  such  a  study,  it  is  best  to  focus  on  a  group  of 
closely related organisms with a shared evolutionary history. 
They were particularly interested in determining the relation-
ship between egg size and egg number, or      fecundity    ,  and the 
extent of gene flow among populations. Fecundity is simply 
the number of eggs or seeds produced by an organism. Turner 
and Trexler proposed that gene flow would be higher among 
populations producing more numerous smaller eggs—that is, 
among populations with higher fecundity. 

 Turner  and  Trexler  chose  the  darters  for  their  studies 
because  they  are  an  ideal  study  group.  Darters  are  small, 
streamlined  benthic  fishes  that  live  in  rivers  and  streams 
throughout  eastern  and  central  North  America.  Male  dart-
ers are usually strikingly colored during the breeding season 
( fig. 12.2 ). The darters consist of 174 species in three genera 

 Figure 12.2   Darters such as this male orangethroat darter form a 
diverse and distinctive subfamily of fishes within the perch family. They 
live only in North America.

within  the  family  Percidae,  which  makes  them  one  of  the 
most  species-rich  groups  of  vertebrates  in  North  America. 
The most diverse genus,  Etheostoma,  alone includes approxi-
mately 135 species. However, despite the fact that the darters 
as a whole live in similar habitats and have similar anatomy, 
they vary widely in their life histories. The genera most sim-
ilar  to  the  ancestors  of  the  darters,   Crystallaria   (1  species) 
and  Percina  (38 species), are larger and produce more eggs 
than species in the genus  Etheostoma.  However,  Etheostoma  
 species also vary substantially in their life histories.     

 Turner and Trexler sampled 64 locations on streams and 
rivers  in  the  Ohio,  Ozark,  and  Ouachita  Highlands  regions 
of Ohio, Arkansas, and Missouri, the heart of freshwater fish 
diversity in North America, which supports one of the most 
diverse temperate freshwater fish faunas on earth. Of the dart-
ers  they  collected  at  these  locations,  they  chose  15  species, 
5 in the genus  Percina  and 10  Etheostoma  species, for detailed 
study. Turner and Trexler chose darter species that included a 
wide range of variation in life history traits, especially varia-
tion in body size, number of eggs laid, and egg size. 

 The  species  in  the  study  ranged  in  length  from  44  to 
127 mm and the number of mature eggs that they produced 
ranged from 49 to 397. Meanwhile, the size of eggs produced 
by the study species varied from 0.9 to 2.3 mm in diameter. 
As they expected, Turner and Trexler found that larger darter 
species  produce  larger  numbers  of  eggs  ( fig.  12.3 ).  Their 
results also support the generalization that there is a trade-off 
between offspring size and number. On average, darters that 
produce larger eggs produce fewer eggs ( fig. 12.4 ).         

 Turner and Trexler characterized the genetic structure of 
darter  populations  using  electrophoresis  of  allozymes  pro-
duced by 21 different loci (see chapter 4). They chose 21 loci 
out of 40 that they examined because they were polymorphic. A 
    polymorphic locus    is one that occurs as more than one allele. 
In this case each allele synthesizes a different allozyme. Turner 
and  Trexler  assessed  genetic  structure  using  allelic  frequen-
cies. Allelic frequencies were measured as the frequencies of 
allozymes across the 21 different study loci. Populations with 
similar  allelic  frequencies  were  taken  as  genetically  similar, 
while those that differed in allelic frequencies were concluded 
to  be  different  genetically.  Gene  flow  was  estimated  by  the 
degree of similarity in allelic frequencies between populations.

and gene flow in darter species. Solid lines and purple dots represent

second method (data from Turner and Trexler 1998).

darter species that produce many small eggs showed less dif-
ference in allelic frequencies across the study region than did 
populations that produce fewer larger eggs.     

 How do differences in egg size and number translate into 
differences in gene flow among populations? It turns out that 
the  larvae  of  darters  that  hatch  from  larger  eggs  are  larger 
when they hatch. These larger larvae begin feeding on prey 
that live on the streambed at an earlier age, and spend less time 
drifting  with  the  water  current.  Consequently,  larvae  hatch-
ing from larger eggs disperse shorter distances and therefore 
carry  their  genes  shorter  distances. As  a  result,  populations 
of species producing fewer larger eggs will be more isolated 
genetically from other populations. Because of their greater 
isolation, such populations will differentiate genetically more 
rapidly compared to populations of species that produce many 
smaller larvae that disperse longer distances. 

 Turner and Trexler’s study not only provides data consis-
tent with the generalization that there is a trade-off between 
offspring size and number, it also reveals some of the evolu-
tionary consequences of that trade-off. 

 Trade-offs between offspring number and size have been 
found in populations of many kinds of organisms. For instance, 
ecologists have found parallel relationships among terrestrial 
plants, involving seed number and size.

 How can the number and kinds of allozymes synthesized 
by a series of populations be used to determine the extent of 
gene  flow  among  populations? Turner  and Trexler  assumed 
that the populations differing in allelic frequencies have lower 
gene  flow  between  them  than  populations  that  have  similar 
allelic frequencies. In other words, they assumed that genetic 
similarity  between  populations  is  maintained  by  gene  flow, 
while genetic differences arise in the absence or restriction of 
gene flow. 

 What relationship is there between egg size and number 
and gene flow between populations? Turner and Trexler found 
a negative relationship between egg size and gene flow but a 
strong positive relationship of gene flow with the number of 
eggs produced by females ( fig. 12.5 ). That is, populations of

  Seed Size and Number in Plants 
 Like fish, plants vary widely in the number of offspring they 
produce, ranging from those that produce many small seeds 
to those that produce a few large seeds ( fig. 12.6 ). The sizes 
of seeds produced by plants range over 10 orders of magni-
tude,  from  the  tiny  seeds  of  orchids  that  weigh  0.000002  g 
to the giant double coconut palm with seeds that weigh up to 
27,000 g. While some orchids are known to produce  billions 
of  seeds,  coconut  palms  produce  small  numbers  of  huge 
seeds. At this scale it is clear that there is a trade-off between 
seed size and seed number, and while there are complexities 
that must be accounted for (Harper, Lovell, and Moore 1970), 
botanists long ago described a negative relationship between 
seed size and seed number (Stevens 1932).  Figure 12.7  shows 
the relationship between average seed mass and the number of 
seeds per plant among species in four families of plants: dai-
sies (Asteraceae), grasses (Poaceae), mustards (Brassicaceae), 
and legumes (Fabaceae). In all four families, species produc-
ing larger numbers of seeds on average produce fewer seeds.         
 Having documented a trade-off between seed size and num-
ber, plant ecologists searched for the mechanisms favoring many 
small seeds in some environments and few larger seeds in others. 
However, when venturing into the world of plants, the  ecologist 
should be aware of the subtleties of plant biology, much of which 
can  be  inferred  from  their  morphology.  For  instance,  many 
 characteristics of plants correlate with their     growth form    or life-
form, which itself constitutes an aspect of the plant life history. 
Therefore, comparing seed production of orchids and coconut 
palms, which mixes data from a species having the growth form 
of an epiphyte (the orchid) and another with the growth form of 
a tree (the palm), may not be a valid comparison. Such a com-
parison may not be valid, since growth form may itself influence 
the number and size of seeds produced by plants. 

 What other aspects of plant biology might influence seed 
size? As we saw in chapter 10, dispersal is an important facet 
of  the  population  biology  of  all  organisms,  including  plants. 
For instance, figure 10.6 shows the history of maple and hem-
lock  dispersal  northward  following  glacial  retreat  beginning 
approximately 14,000 years ago. One of the notable differences

shown in figure 10.6 is that maple dispersed northward much 
faster than hemlock. What is the source of this difference in dis-
persal rate? Since long-distance dispersal by plants is mainly 
by means of seeds, we might ask whether there is a relation-
ship between seed characteristics and mode of dispersal. 

 Aware of the potential influence of growth form and dis-
persal mode on seed characteristics, Mark Westoby, Michelle 
Leishman,  and  Janice  Lord  (1996)  studied  the  relationship 
between plant growth form and seed size. Their study included 
the  seeds  of  196  to  641  species  of  plants  from  five  differ-
ent  regions.  Three  of  their  study  regions  were  in  Australia; 
 western  New  South  Wales,  Central  Australia,  and  Sydney; 
one was in Europe: Sheffield, United Kingdom; and one was 
in North America: Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. 

 Westoby,  Leishman,  and  Lord  recognized  four  plant 
growth  forms.  Grasses  and  grasslike  plants,  such  as  sedges 
and rushes, were classified as     graminoids    .  Herbaceous plants 
other  than  graminoids  were  assigned  to  a      forb     category. 
 Species with woody thickening of their tissues were consid-
ered as woody plants. Finally, climbing plants and vines were 
classified as climbers. The results showed a clear association 
between seed size and plant growth form ( fig. 12.8 a  ). In most 
of  the  floras  analyzed  by  Westoby  and  his  colleagues,  the 
smallest seeds were produced by graminoid plants, followed 
by  the  seeds  produced  by  forbs.  In  all  five  study  regions, 
woody  plants  produce  seeds  that  are  far  larger  than  those 
produced by either graminoids or forbs. However, the largest 
seeds  in  all  regions  are  produced  by  vines. The  researchers 
found that the seeds produced by woody plants and vines in 
the five floras were on average, approximately 10 times the 
mass of seeds produced by either graminoid plants or forbs.

Dispersal mechanism

 Figure 12.8    Plant growth form and dispersal mechanism and seed 
mass (data from Westoby, Leishman, and Lord 1996). 

 Westoby and his coauthors recognized six dispersal strat-
egies. They classified seeds with no specialized structures for 
dispersal as unassisted dispersers. If seeds had hooks, spines, 
or  barbs,  they  were  classified  as      adhesion-adapted    .   Mean-
while, seeds with wings, hairs, or other structures that provide 
air  resistance  were  assigned  to  a  wind-dispersed  category. 
Animal-dispersed seeds in the study included ant-dispersed, 
vertebrate-dispersed, and scatterhoarded. Westoby, Leishman, 
and Lord classified seeds with an     elaiosome    ,  a structure on 
the surface of some seeds generally containing oils attractive 

Chapter 12

to ants, as ant-dispersed. Seeds with an     aril    ,  a fleshy covering 
of some seeds that attracts birds and other vertebrates, or with 
flesh  were  classified  as  vertebrate-dispersed.  Finally,  they 
classified as     scatterhoarded    those seeds known to be gath-
ered by mammals and stored in scattered caches or hoards. 

 Westoby, Leishman, and Lord also found that plants that 
disperse their seeds in different ways tend to produce seeds 
of different sizes ( fig. 12.8 b  ). Plants that they had classified 
as  unassisted  dispersers  produced  the  smallest  seeds,  while 
wind-dispersed seeds were slightly larger. Adhesion-adapted 
seeds  were  of  intermediate  size,  while  animal-dispersed 
seeds  were  largest. Ant-dispersed  seeds  were  the  next  larg-
est,   vertebrate-dispersed  seeds  were  somewhat  larger,  and 
 scatterhoarded were the largest by far. Westoby and his team 
point out that between 21% and 47% of the variation in seed 
size  in  the  five  floras  included  in  their  study  is  accounted 
for by a combination of growth form and mode of dispersal. 
Angela Moles and colleagues (Moles et al. 2005a, 2005b) add 
support for a relationship between seed size and plant growth 
form  through  their  extensive  analyses,  involving  nearly 
13,000 plant species. Their work also suggests that dispersal 
mode exerts a weaker, but significant, influence on seed size. 
 The  analyses  by Westoby  and  his  colleagues  show  that 
both plant growth form and dispersal mode are associated with 
differences in seed size among plants. Impressively, the rela-
tionships between seed size and both growth form and disper-
sal mode were consistent across widely separated geographic 
regions.  However,  Westoby,  Leishman,  and  Lord  pointed 
out that their analysis uncovered wide variation in seed size 
among plants in all regions. What are the factors that maintain 
variation in seed size? To maintain such variation, there must 
be advantages and disadvantages of producing either large or 
small  seeds. What  are  those  advantages  and  disadvantages? 
Plants that produce small seeds can produce greater numbers 
of seeds. Such plants seem to have an advantage where distur-
bance rates are high and where plants with the capacity to col-
onize newly opened space appear to thrive. Though plants that 
produce  large  seeds  are  constrained  to  produce  fewer,  large 
seeds  produce  seedlings  that  survive  at  a  higher  rate  in  the 
face  of  environmental  hazards. Those  hazards  include  com-
petition  from  established  plants,  shade,  defoliation,  nutrient 
shortage, deep burial in soil or litter, and drought.  

  Seed Size and Seedling Performance 
 Anna Jakobsson and Ove Eriksson (2000) of Stockholm Uni-
versity  studied  the  relationships  between  seed  size,  seedling 
size, and seedling recruitment among herbs and grasses living in 
seminatural grasslands in southeastern Sweden. To estimate the 
influence of seed size and seedling size, Jakobsson and Eriksson 
germinated seeds in pots containing a standardized soil mix. The 
pots were maintained in a greenhouse under standardized condi-
tions and seedlings were harvested and weighed 3 weeks after 
    germination    .  Germination is the process by which seeds begin 
to grow or develop, producing the small plant called a seedling 
in the process. The results of this portion of the study showed 
clearly that larger seeds produced larger seedlings ( fig. 12.9 ).

 Jakobsson and Eriksson also investigated the relationship 
between seed size and recruitment among 50 plant species liv-
ing in the meadows of their study region, using a field experi-
ment. At their field sites, Jakobsson and Eriksson planted the 
seeds of each species in 14 small 10  3  10 cm plots. Each plot 
was sown with 50 to 100 seeds of the study species. They left 
half of the study plots undisturbed, while the other plots were 
disturbed  before  planting  by  scratching  the  soil  surface  and 
removing any accumulated litter. In addition to the 14 plots 
where seeds were sown, Jakobsson and Eriksson established 
control  plots  where  they  did  not  plant  seeds.  Again,  half 
of  these  were  disturbed  and  half  left  undisturbed.  Why  did 
 Jakobsson and Eriksson need to establish these control plots? 
The  control  plots  allowed  them  to  estimate  how  much  ger-
mination of each species would occur in the absence of their 
sowing  new  seeds.  The  seeds  of  many  species  can  lie  dor-
mant in soils for long periods of time and additional seeds of 
their study species might have dispersed into the study plots 
during  the  experiment. Therefore,  without  the  control  plots, 
Jakobsson and Eriksson would have no way of knowing if the 
seedlings they observed had grown from the seeds they had 
sown or from other seeds. 

 Of the 50 species of seeds planted, the seeds of 48 spe-
cies germinated and those of 45 species established recruits. 
Jakobsson  and  Eriksson  observed  no  recruitment  of  any  of 
the study species on the control plots. Therefore they could 
be confident that new plants recruited into their experimental 
plots came from seeds that they had planted. Though plants 
recruited to both undisturbed and disturbed plots, the number 
of  recruits  was  generally  higher  in  disturbed  plots.  Further, 
eight species of plants recruited only on disturbed plots. 

 What role did differences in seed size play in the rate of 
recruitment by different species? Jakobsson and Eriksson cal-
culated recruitment success in various ways. One of the most 
basic ways was by dividing the total number of recruits by the 
total number of seeds of a species that they planted, giving the 

proportion of seeds sown that produced recruits. While 45 of 
50 species established new recruits in the experimental plots, 
the rate at which they established varied widely among spe-
cies  from  approximately  5%  to  nearly  90%.  Jakobsson  and 
Eriksson found that differences in seed size explained much 
of  the  observed  differences  in  recruitment  success  among 
species ( fig. 12.10 ). On average, larger seeds, which produce 
larger seedlings, were associated with a higher rate of recruit-
ment. Therefore it appears that by investing more energy into 
a  seed,  the  maternal  plant  increases  the  probability  that  the 
seed  will  successfully  establish  itself  as  a  new  plant.  This 
advantage  associated  with  large  seed  size  is  probably  very 
important in environments such as the grasslands studied by 
Jakobsson and Eriksson, where competition with established 
plants is likely to be high.     

 Jakobsson  and  Eriksson  focused  their  work  on  grass-
lands  where  the  principal  growth  forms  were,  using  the 
classification presented in  figure 12.8 a   ,  graminoid or forbs. 
However, as shown in  figure 12.8 a   ,  woody plants and vines 
produce  substantially  larger  seeds  than  herbaceous  grami-
noids  and  forbs.  How  might  patterns  in  seed  and  seedling 
size vary among woody plants? Kenji Seiwa and Kihachiro 
Kikuzawa (1991) studied the relationship between seed size 
and seedling size among tree species native to Hokkaido, the 
northernmost large island of Japan. The results of their work 
and their interpretation of the results provide clear insights 
into how seed size may improve the ability of seedlings to 
survive  environmental  hazards.  Seiwa  and  Kikuzawa  were 
especially  focused  on  the  influences  of  shade  on  seedling 
establishment. 

 The trees studied by Seiwa and Kikuzawa were all broad-
leaved  deciduous  trees  that  grow  in  the  temperate  decidu-
ous forests of Hokkaido, either on mountain slopes between 
100  and  200  m  in  altitude  or  in  riparian  forests.  The  fruits 
of all the study species were collected from trees growing in 
the arboretum of the Hokkaido Forest Experimental Station.

among trees (Seiwa and Kikuzawa 1991). 

In  the  laboratory  the  research  team  removed  any  fruit  pulp 
from  the  seeds,  washed  them,  and  then  allowed  them  to  air 
dry for 24 hours. Seiwa and Kikuzawa then estimated aver-
age  seed  mass  by  weighing  one  to  five  groups  of  100  to 
1,000  randomly chosen seeds. A week later they planted seeds 
at depths of 1 to 2 cm in a clay loam soil and watered, until the 
soil was saturated, three times a week. 

 Seiwa and Kikuzawa’s results showed clearly that larger 
seeds  produced  taller  seedlings  ( fig.  12.11 ). They  explained 
this pattern as the result of the larger seeds providing greater 
energy  reserves  to  boost  initial  seedling  growth.  Seiwa  and 
Kikuzawa observed that seedlings from large-seeded species 
unfolded all of their leaves rapidly in the spring and shed all 
of their leaves synchronously in the autumn. They concluded 
that this timing allows the seedlings from large-seeded spe-
cies  to  emerge  early  in  the  spring  before  the  trees  forming 
the canopy of the forest have expanded their leaves and have 
shaded the forest floor. Seiwa and Kikuzawa also pointed out 
that  rapid  growth  would  help  seedlings  penetrate  the  thick 
litter  layer  on  the  floor  of  deciduous  forests  and  help  them 
establish themselves as part of the forest understory.   

 In addition to showing variation in the number and sizes 
of  offspring,  organisms  also  show  a  great  deal  of  variation 
in the age at which they begin reproducing. They also differ 
greatly in the relative amount of energy they allocate to repro-
duction versus growth and maintenance.

five floras on three continents in their study?  

     2.   Why did Jakobsson and Eriksson (2000) conduct their 
study of the relationship between seed size and seedling 
size in a greenhouse?  

     3.   Large darter species produce larger numbers of smaller 
eggs compared to smaller darter species (see  figs. 12.3  
and 12.4). Consequently, would you expect to find more 
genetic  differences  along  the  length  of  a  river  system 
among small darters or large darters? (Hint: Consider

 Reproductive Allocation 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 12.7  Describe the connection between reproductive effort 

and the gonosomatic index.

 12.8  Outline the relationship between adult mortality and 

the timing of reproduction.

 12.9  Explain how finding parallel patterns in a variety of 

organisms, for example, lizards, snakes, and fish, 
strengthens our confidence in life history theory.
 12.10  Discuss the contributions of studies on pumpkin-

seed sunfish to life history theory.

Where adult survival is lower, organisms begin  reproducing 
at an earlier age and invest a greater  proportion of their 
energy budget into reproduction; where adult survival is 
higher,  organisms  defer  reproduction  to  a  later  age  and 
allocate a smaller proportion of their resources to repro-
duction.  
Is there a relationship between the probability of 
an organism living from one year to the next and the age at 
which the organism begins reproducing? What environmental 
factors are responsible for variation in age at maturity and the 
amount of energy allocated to reproduction, which has been 
called     reproductive effort?    (Reproductive effort is the allo-
cation of energy, time, and other resources to the production 
and care of offspring.) These are two questions central to life 
history ecology. 

 Reproductive effort generally involves trade-offs with other 
needs of the organism, including allocation to growth and main-
tenance. Because of these trade-offs, allocation to reproduction 
may reduce the probability that an organism will survive. How-
ever, delaying reproduction also involves risk. An individual that 
delays reproduction runs the risk of dying before it can repro-
duce. Consequently, evolutionary ecologists have predicted that 
variation in mortality rates among adults will be in association 
with variation in the age of first reproduction, or age of repro-
ductive  maturity.  Specifically,  they  have  predicted  that  where 
adult mortality is higher, natural selection will favor early repro-
ductive maturity; and where adult mortality is low, natural selec-
tion has been expected to favor delaying reproductive maturity.  

   Life History Variation Among Species 
 The  relationship  among  mortality,  growth,  and  age  at  first 
reproduction or reproductive maturity has been examined in 
a large number of organisms. Early work, which concentrated 
on fish, shrimp, and sea urchins, suggested linkages between 
mortality  or  survival,  growth,  and  reproduction.  Richard 
Shine and Eric Charnov (1992) explored life history variation 
among  snakes  and  lizards  to  determine  whether  generaliza-
tions  developed  through  studies  of  fish  and  marine  inverte-
brates could be extended to another group of animals living in 
very different environments. 

 Shine and Charnov began their presentation with a reminder 
that, in contrast to most terrestrial arthropods, birds, and mam-
mals, including humans, many animals continue growing after 

they reach sexual maturity. In addition, most vertebrate species 
begin reproducing before they reach their maximum body size. 
Shine and Charnov pointed out that the energy budgets of these 
other vertebrate species, such as fish and reptiles, are different 
before and after sexual maturity. Before these organisms reach 
sexual maturity, energy acquired by an individual is allocated 
to one of two competing demands: maintenance and growth. 
However,  after  reaching  sexual  maturity,  limited  energy  sup-
plies  are  allocated  to  three  functions:  maintenance,  growth, 
and reproduction. Because they have fewer demands on their 
 limited  energy  supplies,  individuals  delaying  reproduction 
until  they  are  older  will  grow  faster  and  reach  a  larger  size. 
Because  of  the  increase  in  reproductive  rate  associated  with 
larger body size (see  fig. 12.3 ), deferring reproduction would 
lead to a higher reproductive rate. However, again, where mor-
tality rates are high, deferring reproduction increases the prob-
ability  that  an  individual  will  die  before  reproducing.  These 
relationships suggest that mortality rates will play a pivotal role 
in determining the age at first reproduction. 

 Shine and Charnov gathered information from published 
summaries on annual adult survival and age at which females 
mature for several species of snakes and lizards. The annual 
rate of adult survival among snakes in their data set ranged 
from approximately 35% to 85% of the population, while age 
at reproductive maturity ranged from 2 to 7 years. Meanwhile, 
the annual rate of lizard survival ranged from approximately 
8% to 67% of the population and their age at first reproduction 
ranged from a little less than 8 months to 6.5 years. Because 
most of the species they examined were North American and 
were members of either one family of snakes or one family 
of lizards, Shine and Charnov urged that their results not be 
generalized to snakes and lizards generally until other groups 
from  other  regions  had  been  analyzed.  Regardless  of  these 
cautions,  the  results  of  Shine  and  Charnov’s  study  showed 
clearly that as survival of adult lizards and snakes increases, 
their age at maturity also increases ( fig. 12.12 a  ).     

 More  recent  analyses  of  the  relationship  between  adult 
mortality rate and age at maturity among fish species provide 
additional support for the prediction that high adult survival 
leads to delayed maturity. Donald Gunderson (1997) explored 
patterns  in  adult  survival  and  reproductive  effort  among 
several  populations  of  fish.  Gunderson  suggested  that  there 
should  be  a  strong  relationship  between  adult  mortality  in 
populations  and  reproductive  effort  because  some  combina-
tions of mortality and reproductive effort have a higher prob-
ability  of  persisting  than  others.  For  instance,  a  population 
showing a combination of high mortality and high reproduc-
tive effort would have a higher chance of persisting than one 
experiencing  high  mortality  but  allocating  low  reproductive 
effort.  The  population  with  this  second  combination  would 
likely go extinct in a short period of time. 

 The  life  history  information  Gunderson  summarized 
in  his  analysis  included  mortality  rate,  estimated  maximum 
length, age at reproductive maturity, and reproductive effort. 
Gunderson estimated reproductive effort as each population’s 
gonadosomatic index    ,  or     GSI    .  GSI was taken as the ovary 
weight  of  each  species  divided  by  the  species  body  weight 
and adjusted for the number of batches of offspring produced 

 

Chapter 12

by each species per year. For example, because the northern 
anchovy spawns three times per year, the weight of its ovary 
was multiplied by 3 for calculating its GSI. Meanwhile, the 
ovary weight for dogfish sharks, which reproduce only every 
other year, was divided by 2. However, since most of the spe-
cies included in the analysis spawn once per year, their ovary 
weights required no adjustment for GSI calculations. 

 The fish included in Gunderson’s analysis ranged in size 
from  the  Puget  Sound  rockfish,  which  reaches  a  maximum 
size of approximately 15 cm, to northeast Arctic cod, which 
reaches  a  length  of  130  cm.  The  age  at  maturation  among 

Lizards and snakes that 
have higher survival

these fish species ranges from 1 year in northern anchovy pop-
ulations to 23 years in dogfish shark populations. Like Shine 
and Charnov, Gunderson gathered information about the life 
histories of the fish in his analysis from previously published 
papers  and  several  experts  on  particular  fish  species.  In  his 
table  summarizing  life  history  information  for  the  28  spe-
cies included in his analysis, Gunderson lists 72 references. 
In  contrast  to  Shine  and  Charnov,  Gunderson  provides  esti-
mates of mortality rates rather than survival rates. In addition 
his  estimates  are  of  “instantaneous”  mortality  rates  instead 
of annual rates. However, like Shine and Charnov, his results 
show a clear relationship between adult mortality and age of 
reproductive maturity ( fig. 12.12 b  ). These results support the 
idea that natural selection has acted to adjust age at reproduc-
tive maturity to rates of mortality experienced by populations. 
 Gunderson’s  analysis  also  gives  information  on  varia-
tion  in  reproductive  effort  among  species.  His  calculations 
of a gonadosomatic index, or GSI, for each of the 28 species 
included in the analysis spanned more than a 30-fold differ-
ence from a value of 0.02 for the rougheye rockfish to 0.65 for 
the northern anchovy. When Gunderson plotted GSI against 
mortality rates ( fig. 12.13 ), the results supported the predic-
tion from life history theory that species with higher mortality 
would show higher relative reproductive effort.

 To this point in our discussion we have emphasized life his-
tory differences between species, such as the lizard and snake 
species compared by Shine and Charnov (see  fig. 12.12 a  ) or

the fish species compared by Gunderson (see  fig. 12.12 b  ). 
Is  there  evidence  that  life  history  differences  will  evolve 
within species, where different populations experience dif-
ferent  rates  of  adult  mortality?  The  data  set  analyzed  by 
Shine and Charnov included nine populations of the eastern 
fence  lizard,   Sceloporus  undulatus.  Variation  among  those 
populations indicates that age at maturity within lizard pop-
ulations increases with increased adult survival. Additional 
evidence for the evolution of such intraspecific differences 
comes from a comparative study of several populations of 
the pumpkinseed sunfish,  Lepomis gibbosus  ( fig. 12.14 ).     

 Kirk  Bertschy  and  Michael  Fox  (1999)  studied  the 
influence  of  adult  survival  on  pumpkinseed  sunfish  life 
histories.  One  of  the  major  objectives  of  their  study  was 
to  test  the  prediction  by  life  history  theory  that  increased 
adult survival, relative to juvenile mortality, favors delayed 
maturity and reduced reproductive effort. Their study goal 
was to explain the evolution of life history variation within 
a species. 

 Bertschy and Fox selected five populations of pumpkin-
seed  sunfish  living  in  5  lakes  from  a  group  of  27  lakes  in 
southern  Ontario,  Canada.  Fox  had  previously  studied  the 
pumpkinseed sunfish living in these lakes and so they had a 
considerable basis for choosing study populations. Bertschy 
and Fox chose lakes that were similar in area and depth and 
small enough that they had a reasonable chance of estimating 
mortality rates and variation in other life history characteris-
tics. Their study lakes varied in area from 7.2 to 39.6 ha and 
in depth from 2.6 to 11 m. Bertschy and Fox also chose lakes 
that had no major inflows or outflows. 

 Bertschy  and  Fox  estimated  life  history  characteristics 
from  annual  samples  of  approximately  100  pumpkinseed 
sunfish taken from each of the five study lakes. They caught 
the fish in their shallow (0.5–2 m depth) littoral habitat using 
funnel  traps  and  beach  seine  nets.  Bertschy  and  Fox  took 
their annual population sample in late May or early June just 
before the beginning or right at the beginning of the spawn-
ing season. The individuals caught were sacrificed by placing 

 Figure 12.14   Male pumpkinseed sunfish,  Lepomis gibbosus,  build

against intrusions by other males and attempt to attract females of their 
species to deposit eggs within them.

them in an ice slurry and then freezing them for later analy-
sis. They  made  several  measurements  on  each  individual  in 
their samples, including its age (by  counting annual rings in 
scales), weight (to the nearest 0.1 g), length (in mm), sex, and 
reproductive  status.  Because  female  reproductive  effort  is 
largely restricted to egg production whereas male reproduc-
tive  effort  includes  activities  such  as  territory  guarding  and 
nest building, Bertschy and Fox studied reproductive traits in 
females only. A female was considered mature if her ovaries 
contained eggs with yolk. The ovaries of mature females were 
dissected out and weighed to the nearest 0.01 g. Bertschy and 
Fox represented female reproductive effort using the gonad-
osomatic index, GSI, which they calculated as 100  3  (ovary 
mass)  4  (body mass), which yields GSI values expressed as 
percentages rather than as proportions. 

 Bertschy and Fox estimated the number of adult pump-
kinseed sunfish and the age structure (e.g., see fig. 10.21) of 
pumpkinseed populations in each of the study lakes. Ages of 
fish  were  estimated  from  their  length  using  the  relationship 
between length and age of individuals of known age from each 
population. These surveys, which were conducted each year 
from 1992 to 1994, gave a basis for estimating rates of adult 
survival for each age class in each lake’s population. The low-
est rate, or probability, of adult survival was 0.19, while the 
highest was 0.65. In other words, the proportion of adults sur-
viving from one year to the next ranged from approximately 
one adult out of five (0.19) to about two adults out of three 
(0.65). This  variation  among  lakes  produced  striking  differ-
ences in the form of survivorship curves ( fig. 12.15 ).     

 Juvenile  survival  was  estimated  by  counting  the  num-
ber  of  pumpkinseed  nests  and  then  collecting  all  the  larval 
fish in a sample of nests. The number of nests in the study 
lakes   varied  from  60  to  over  1,000  and  the  number  of  lar-
val  fish   produced  ranged  from  approximately  100,000  to 
over  a   million.  Using  their  estimate  of  the  number  of  lar-
vae produced and the number of 3-year-old fish in the same 
lake,  Bertschy  and  Fox  estimated  juvenile  survival.  Juve-
nile   survival  to  adulthood  in  the  study  lakes  ranged  from 
0.004,  or  about  4  out  of  1,000  larvae,  to  0.016,  or  about 
16 out of 1,000  larvae. Because they were interested in the 
 relative rates of adult and juvenile survival, Bertschy and Fox 
 represented survival in their study lakes as the ratio of adult 
to  juvenile  survival  probabilities.   Figure  12.16   shows  that 
this  ratio  ranged  widely  among  study  lakes  from  a  low  of 
10.6 to 116.8, a  tenfold difference among lakes.     

 Bertschy and Fox found significant variation in most life 
history characteristics across their study lakes. Pumpkinseed 
sunfish matured at ages ranging from 2.4 to 3.4 years in the 
different  study  lakes  and  they  showed  reproductive  invest-
ments (gonadosomatic indexes, or GSI) ranging from 6.9% to 
9.3%. The relationship between survival rate and age at matu-
rity  found  by  Bertschy  and  Fox  suggests  that  populations 
with higher adult survival mature at a greater age ( fig. 12.17 ). 
The  correlation  between  survival  rate  and  age  at  maturity 
was  not  high  enough  to  be  statistically  significant;  how-
ever,  the  relationship  between  adult  survival  and  reproduc-
tive effort was very clear and highly significant ( fig. 12.18 ).

The patterns of life history variation across the pumpkinseed 
populations studied by Bertschy and Fox support the theory 
that,  where  adult  survival  is  lower  relative  to  juvenile  sur-
vival, natural selection will favor allocating greater resources 
to reproduction.

 As  we  explored  the  relationship  between  offspring  size 
and number and the influence of mortality on the timing of 
maturation and reproductive effort, we’ve accumulated a large 
body  of  information  on  life  histories.  Let’s  step  back  now 
and try to organize that information to make it easier to think 
about life history variation in nature. Several researchers have 
proposed classification systems for life histories.

 12.3  Life History Classification 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 12.11  Define r selection and K selection.
 12.12  Contrast the characteristics of r selected and K 

selected species.

 12.13  Compare the life history classification systems of 

Grime for plants and Winemiller and colleagues for 
animals, emphasizing the variables used in the clas-
sification systems.

 12.14  Explain the opportunities to life history research 

opened up by Charnov’s life history classification, 
which removes the influences of size.

The great diversity of life histories can be classified on 
the basis of a few population characteristics. Examples 
include  fecundity  or  number  of  offspring,            survival,
relative offspring size, and age at reproductive maturity    .
While  classification  systems  never  capture  the  full  diver-
sity of nature, they make working with the often bewilder-
ing variety of nature much easier. It is important to bear in 
mind when using classification systems, however, that they 

are  an  abstraction  from  nature  and  that  most  species  fall 
somewhere in between the extreme types.  

   r  and K Selection 
 One  of  the  earliest  attempts  to  organize  information  on  the 
great  variety  of  life  histories  that  occur  among  species  was 
under the heading of  r  selection and K selection  (MacArthur 
and Wilson 1967). The term  r    selection,  which refers to the per 
capita rate of increase,  r,  which we calculated in  chapter 10, 
was defined by Robert MacArthur and E. O.  Wilson as selec-
tion favoring a higher population growth rate.  MacArthur and 
Wilson suggested that  r  selection would be strongest in spe-
cies  often  colonizing  new  or  disturbed  habitats.  Therefore, 
high levels of disturbance would lead to ongoing  r  selection. 
MacArthur  and  Wilson  contrasted   r   selected  species  with 
those  subject  mainly  to  K  selection.  The  term      K  selection    
refers to the carrying capacity of the logistic growth equation 
summarized in figure 11.13. MacArthur and Wilson proposed 
that K selection favors more efficient utilization of resources 
such as food and nutrients. They envisioned that K selection 
would  be  most  prominent  in  those  situations  where  species 
populations are near carrying capacity much of the time. 

 Eric Pianka (1970, 1972) developed the concept of  r  and 
K selection further in two important papers. Pianka pointed 
out  that   r   selection  and  K  selection  are  the  endpoints  on  a 
continuous  distribution  and  that  most  organisms  are  subject 
to forms of selection somewhere in between these extremes. 
In addition, he correlated  r  and K selection with attributes of 
the environment and of populations. He also listed the popu-
lation characteristics that each form of selection favors. Fol-
lowing MacArthur and Wilson, Pianka predicted that while  r  
selection should be characteristic of variable or unpredictable 
environments,  fairly  constant  or  predictable  environments 
should create conditions for K selection. In such conditions 
survivorship  among   r   selected  species  will  approximate 
type  III,  while  K  selected  species  should  show  type  I  or  II 
survivorship (see fig. 10.18).  Table 12.1  summarizes Pianka’s 
proposed  contrast  in  population  characteristics  favored  by 
 r  versus K selection.

 Pianka’s  detailed  analysis  clarified  the  sharp  contrast 
between  the  two  selective  extremes  represented  by   r   and  K 
selection by revealing biological details. The most fundamental 
contrasts are, of course, between intrinsic rate of increase,  r   max  , 
which should be highest in  r  selected species, and competitive 
ability,  which  should  be  highest  among  K  selected   species. 
In  addition,  according  to  Pianka,  development  should  be 
rapid under  r  selection and relatively slow under K selection. 
 Meanwhile, early reproduction and smaller body size will be 
favored by  r  selection, while K selection favors later reproduc-
tion and larger body size. Pianka predicted that reproduction 
under  r  selection will tend toward a single reproductive event in 
which many small offspring are produced. This type of repro-
duction, which is called     semelparity    ,  occurs in organisms such 
as annual weeds and salmon. In contrast, K selection should 
favor repeated reproduction, or     iteroparity    ,  of fewer larger off-
spring. Iteroparity, which spaces out reproduction over several 
reproductive periods during an organism’s lifetime, is the type 
of reproduction seen in most perennial plants and most verte-
brate animals. Pianka’s contrast may be restated as “small and 
fast,” analogous to  r  selected species, with ones that are “large 
and slow,” analogous to K selected species ( fig. 12.19 ).     

 The ideas of  r  and K selection helped greatly as ecolo-
gists  and  evolutionary  biologists  attempted  to  think  more 
systematically  about  life  history  variation  and  its  evolution. 
However, ecologists who found that the dichotomy of  r  versus 

K did not include a great deal of known variation in life histo-
ries have proposed alternative classifications.  

  Plant Life Histories 
 J. P. Grime (1977, 1979) proposed that variation in environ-
mental  conditions  has  led  to  the  development  of  distinctive 
strategies  or  life  histories  among  plants.  The  two  variables 
that he selected as most important in exerting selective pres-
sure on plants were the intensity of disturbance and the inten-
sity  of  stress.  Grime  contrasted  four  extreme  environmental 
types, which he characterized by combinations of disturbance 
intensity  and  stress  intensity.  Four  environmental  extremes 
envisioned  by  Grime  were:  (1)  low  disturbance–low  stress, 
(2)  low  disturbance–high  stress,  (3)  high  disturbance–low 
stress, and (4) high disturbance–high stress. Drawing on his 
extensive knowledge of plant biology, Grime suggested that 
plants  occupy  three  of  his  theoretical  environments  but  that 
there is no viable strategy among plants for the fourth envi-
ronmental combination, high disturbance–high stress. 

 Grime  next  described  plant  strategies,  or  life  histories, 
that match the requirements of the remaining three environ-
ments. His strategies were ruderal, stress-tolerant, and com-
petitive  ( fig.  12.20 ).      Ruderals     are  plants  that  live  in  highly 
disturbed  habitats  and  that  may  depend  on  disturbance  to 
persist in the face of potential competition from other plants. 
Grime  summarized  several  characteristics  of  ruderals  that 
allow  them  to  persist  in  habitats  experiencing  frequent  and 
intense      disturbance    ,  which he defined as any mechanisms or 
processes that limit plants by destroying plant biomass. One 
of the characteristics of ruderals is their capacity to grow rap-
idly and produce seeds during relatively short periods between 
successive  disturbances.  This  capacity  alone  would  favor 
persistence  of  ruderals  in  the  face  of  frequent  disturbance.

Investigating the Evidence  12

A Statistical Test for Distribution Pattern

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 12.15  Calculate chi-square given mean density and variance 

in density estimated by a sample of a population.

 12.16  Given chi-square values and degrees of freedom from 
a variance/mean ratio test of distributions, determine 
whether a population is more likely to have a regular, 
random, or clumped distribution. (Use a graph show-
ing the distribution of critical chi-square values.)

 Suppose  you  are  studying  the  life  history  of  three  species  of 
herbaceous plants in a desert landscape. As part of that study, 
you are interested in determining the pattern of distribution of 
individuals in each population. Your hypothesis states that the 
 individuals in each population are randomly distributed across 
the landscape. Your alternative hypotheses propose that individ-
uals are either clumped or uniformly distributed. In chapter 9, 
we reviewed a study that suggested very different patterns of dis-
tribution in three plant populations (see p. 209). In that example, 
the sample means and sample variances of the three hypothetical 
populations of plant species A, B, and C were as follows:

Also in chapter 9, we reviewed how in a randomly distributed 
population, variance/mean  5  1, while in a regularly distributed 
population, variance/mean , 1, and in a clumped population, 
__
variance/mean . 1. Given these relationships, the    s2/ 
 X   ratios 

in the above table suggest that species A has a random distribu-
tion, species B has a regular distribution, and species C has a 
clumped  distribution.  However,  since  the  values  in  the  table 
are statistical  estimates  of the true variance/mean ratios in the 
study populations we need to do a statistical test to determine 
the significance of our results. 

 The first step in our test is to establish a hypothesis. In each 
case, our hypothesis states that the variance/mean ratio of the 
population equals 1. We next need to determine a significance 
level, which we have seen (p. 236) is generally P , 0.05. We can 
use a chi-square test to determine whether a sample variance/
sample mean ratio is significantly different from 1 as follows:

x2 5   

s2(n 2 1)
________ 
      
 

 
__
 X 
 

 Here, n  2  1 is the degrees of freedom, which is the sample 
size minus 1. In the case of our plant study, the sample size, n, 
is the number of sample quadrats studied for each population, 
which was 11 (see p. 209). 

 For our sample of the species A population, the calcula-

tion is:

x2 5   5.22 3 10 
_________ 

 

 

5.27
x2 5 9.905 

 For our sample of the species B population, the calculation is:

x2 5   0.36 3 10 
_________ 

 

 

5.18
x2 5 0.695     

 For our sample of the species C population, the calculation is:

x2 5   44.42 3 10 
__________ 

 

 

5.27
x2 5 84.288

In addition, however, ruderals also invest a large proportion 
of  their  biomass  in  reproduction,  producing  large  numbers 
of seeds that are capable of dispersing to new habitats made 
available  by  disturbance.  The  term  “ruderal”  is  sometimes 
used  synonymously  with  the  term  “weed.” Animals  associ-
ated with disturbance, like weedy plants, have high reproduc-
tive rates and are good colonists, too. Such animals are also 
sometimes referred to as ruderals.     

 Grime (1977) began his discussion of the second type of 
plant life history, stress-tolerant, with a definition of     stress    as 
“. . . external constraints which limit the rate of dry matter pro-
duction of all or part of the vegetation.” In other words, stress is 
induced by environmental conditions that limit the growth of all 
or part of the vegetation. What environmental conditions might 
create such constraints? Our discussions in chapters 5, 6, and 7, 

where we considered temperature, water, and energy and nutri-
ent relations, provide several suggestions. Stress is the result of 
extreme temperatures, high or low, extreme hydrologic condi-
tions, too little or too much water, or too much or too little light 
or nutrients. Because different species are adapted to different 
environmental  conditions,  the  absolute  levels  of  light,  water, 
temperature, and so forth that constitute stress will vary from 
species  to  species.  In  addition,  conditions  that  induce  stress 
will  vary  from  biome  to  biome.  For  instance,  the  amount  of 
precipitation leading to drought stress is different in rain for-
est and desert, or the minimum temperatures inducing thermal 
stress are different in tropical forest compared to boreal forest. 
 The important point that Grime made, however, was that 
in every biome, some species are more tolerant to the envi-
ronmental extremes that occur. These are the species that he

    How  do  we  determine  if  these  values  of  chi-square  are 
 statistically  significant  at  P  ,  0.05?  Here,  we  need  to  con-
__
sider whether the    s2/ 
 X   ratios are significantly  greater  than 1, 
 or  significantly  less  than 1. So, in contrast to the situation that 
we analyzed in chapter 11, we will compare our chi-square 
values to two critical values, one small and one large. 

 The situation we are considering is pictured in  figure 1 . 
With degrees of freedom of 10 (11  2  1  5  10), the critical val-
ues of chi-square are x2 5 3.247 and x2 5 20.483. As shown 
in   figure  1 ,  these  values  of  chi-square  fall  on  the  lines  that 
form the boundaries of the area shaded green. For values of 
chi-square within the green area, we accept the hypothesis that 
the variance/mean ratio in the population equals 1, and that 
the population has a random distribution. Values of chi-square 
in the blue zone indicate a clumped distribution, while values 
in  the  red  zone  indicate  a  regular  distribution.  Returning  to 
the populations of species A, B, and C, we accept the hypoth-
esis  that  the  variance/mean  ratio  of  species A  ( x  2   5  9.905) 
does  not  differ  significantly  from  1,  and  therefore,  we  con-
clude that it has a random distribution. Meanwhile, because 
the value of chi-square for species B ( x  2  5 0.695) is less than 
the critical value of 3.247, we reject the hypothesis that the 
variance/ mean ratio for species B equals 1, and conclude that 
it has a regular distribution. Using similar logic, we conclude 
that species C ( x  2  5 84.288) has a clumped distribution. 

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  12 
     1.  Do  the  results  of  the  chi-square  test  for  species  B 
show  beyond  a  doubt  that  its  population  has  a  regular 
distribution?  

    2.  How could we improve our confidence in the conclusion 

that species B has a regular distribution?

referred  to  as  “stress-tolerant.”      Stress-tolerant  plants     are 
those that live under conditions of high stress but low distur-
bance. Grime proposed that, in general, stress-tolerant plants 
grow slowly; are evergreen; conserve fixed carbon, nutrients, 
and  water;  and  are  adept  at  exploiting  temporary  favorable 
conditions. In addition, stress-tolerant plants are often unpal-
atable  to  most  herbivores.  Because  stress- tolerant  species 
endure  some  of  the  most  difficult  conditions  a  particular 
environment  has  to  offer,  they  are  there  to  take  advantage 
of infrequent favorable periods for growth and reproduction. 
 The  third  plant  strategy  proposed  by  Grime,  the  com-
petitive  strategy,  is  in  many  respects  intermediate  between 
the  ruderal  strategy  and  the  stress-tolerant  strategy.  In 
Grime’s  classification,      competitive  plants     occupy  environ-
ments  where  disturbance  intensity  is  low  and  the  intensity 

of stress is also low. Under conditions of low stress and low 
disturbance, plants have the potential to grow well. As they 
do so, however, they eventually compete with each other for 
resources, such as light, water, nutrients, and space. Grime’s 
model  predicts  that  the  plants  living  under  such  circum-
stances will be selected for strong competitive abilities. 

 How  does  Grime’s  system  of  classification  compare 
with  the   r   and  K  selection  contrast  proposed  by   MacArthur 
and  Wilson  and  Pianka?  Grime  proposed  that   r   selection 
corresponds  to  his  ruderal  strategy  or  life  history,  while 
K  selection  corresponds  to  the  stress-tolerant  end  of  his  clas-
sification.  Meanwhile,  he  placed  the  competitive  life  history 
category in a position intermediate between the extremes repre-
sented by  r  selection and K selection. However, while attempting 
this reconciliation of the two classifications, Grime suggested 

274 

Section III 

  Population Ecology

that a linear arrangement of life histories, with  r  selection and K 
selection occupying the extremes, fails to capture the full varia-
tion shown by organisms. He suggested that more dimensions 
are needed and, of course, Grime’s triangular arrangement (see 
 fig. 12.20 ) adds another dimension. The factors varying along 
the edges of Grime’s triangle are intensity of disturbance, stress, 
and competition. Other ecologists have also recognized the need 
for more dimensions in representing life history diversity.  

  Opportunistic, Equilibrium, 
and Periodic Life Histories 
 In a review of life history patterns among fish, Kirk Winemiller 
and Kenneth Rose (1992) proposed a classification of life his-
tories based on some of the aspects of population dynamics that 
we reviewed in chapter 10. They drew particular attention to 
survivorship especially among juveniles, lx, fecundity or num-
ber of offspring produced, mx, and generation time, T, or age 
at maturity, a. Table 10.2 summarized the relationship among 
these  variables.  While  the  analysis  by  Winemiller  and  Rose 
overlaps those of Pianka and Grime, their system adds coher-
ence to life history classification by its linkage to fundamental 
elements of population ecology, lx, mx, and  a . 

 Winemiller and Rose start—as we began chapter 12—with 
the concept of trade-offs. Their trade-offs are among fecundity, 
survivorship,  and  age  at  reproductive  maturity.  Using  varia-
tion in fish life histories as a model, Winemiller and Rose pro-
posed that life histories should lie on a semi-triangular surface 
as shown in  figure 12.21 . They called the three endpoints on 
their surface “opportunistic,” “equilibrium,” and “periodic” life 

histories. The opportunistic strategy, by combining low juve-
nile survival, low numbers of offspring, and early reproductive 
maturity,  maximizes  colonizing  ability  across  environments 
that vary unpredictably in time or space. It is important to keep 
in mind, however, that while the  absolute reproductive output 
of  opportunistic  species  may  be  low,  the  percentage  of  their 
energy  budget  allocated  to  reproduction  is  high.  Winemiller 
and  Rose’s  equilibrium  strategy  combines  high  juvenile  sur-
vival, low numbers of offspring, and late reproductive maturity. 
Finally, the periodic strategy combines low juvenile survival, 
high  numbers  of  offspring,  and  late  maturity.  Among  fish, 
periodic species tend to be large and produce numerous small 
 offspring. By producing large numbers of offspring over a long 
life  span,  periodic  species  can  take  advantage  of  infrequent 
periods when conditions are favorable for reproduction.   

 It  is  difficult  to  map  the  exact  correspondence  of 
Winemiller and Rose’s classification of life history strategies 
to  either  the   r –K  continuum  of  MacArthur  and Wilson  and 
Pianka  or  the  triangular  classification  of  plant  life  histories 
developed by Grime. For instance, opportunistic species share 
characteristics with  r  selected and ruderal species. However, 
opportunistic  species  differ  from  the  typical   r   selected  spe-
cies because they tend to produce small clutches of offspring. 
The equilibrium strategy, which combines production of high 
juvenile  survival,  low  numbers  of  offspring,  and  late  repro-
ductive  maturity,  approaches  the  characteristics  of  typical 
K selected species. Winemiller and Rose point out, however, 
that  many  fish  classified  as  “equilibrium”  are  small,  while 
typically  K  selected  species  tend  toward  large  body  size 
(see   table  12.1 ).  Periodic  species  are  not  captured  by  the

linear  r  to K selection gradient. Meanwhile the periodic and 
equilibrium  species  in  Winemiller  and  Rose’s  classification 
share  some  characteristics  with  Grime’s  stress-tolerant  and 
competitive species but differ in other characteristics. 

 Thus  far  in  this  review  of  systems  for  life  history 
 classification, we have focused on just three of the many that 
have  been  proposed.  Even  with  just  these  three,  however, 
translation  from  one  classification  to  another  is  difficult. 
What  are  the  sources  of  these  differences  in  perspective? 
One of the sources is that different ecologists have worked 
with  different  groups  of  organisms.  While  MacArthur  and 
Wilson’s  system  was  built  after  years  of  work  on  birds 
and  insects,  respectively,  Pianka  had  worked  mainly  with 
lizards. Grime’s classification was built on and intended for 
plants. Finally, the perspective of Winemiller and Rose was 
influenced  substantially  by  their  work  with  fish.  Because 
these ecologists worked with such different groups of organ-
isms, it is not surprising that their classifications of life his-
tories do not overlay precisely. 

 However,  it  may  be  that  the  analysis  by Winemiller  and 
Rose has laid the foundation for a more general theory of life 
histories. By basing their classification system on some of the 
most basic aspects of population ecology,  l   x   ,  m   x   , and  a , Wine-
miller  and  Rose  (1992)  established  a  common  currency  for 
representing  and  analyzing  life  history  information  for  any 
organism.  As  a  model  for  how  such  a  translation  might  be 
done, Winemiller (1992) plotted the distributions of life history 
parameters of representative animal groups on their life history 

classification axes ( fig. 12.22 ). By plotting life history variation 
among vertebrate groups on the same axes using the same vari-
ables,  figure 12.22  demonstrates differences in the amount of 
life history variation between the groups. Notice that fish show 
the greatest variation and mammals the least, while birds and 
reptiles and amphibians include intermediate levels of variation.      

 Lifetime Reproductive Effort and Relative 
Offspring Size: Two Central Variables? 
 In  response  to  the  various  attempts  to  classify  life  histories, 
Eric Charnov, with Robin Warne and Melanie Moses, (2002, 
2007) developed a new approach to life history classification. 
In his most recent attempts at life history classification, Char-
nov has focused his attention on mammals, altricial birds, and 
lizards. His goal has been to develop a classification free of the 
influences of size and time that would facilitate the exploration 
of  life  history  variation  within  and  among  groups  of  closely 
related taxa. Why remove the influences of size and time? Our 
discussion  of   r   and  K  selection  underscored  the  relationship 
between size of organisms and timing of life history features 
(see  table 12.1 ). The influences of size and timing are respon-
sible for many of the obvious life history differences among 
species  of  closely  related  taxa,  for  instance,  the  differences 
among  large  and  small  mammal  species,  such  as  between 
a  deer  mouse  and  an  African  elephant  (see   fig.  12.19 ).  By 
removing size and time effects, we may be able to more clearly 
detect life history differences among evolutionary lineages. 

Compared to other vertebrate 
groups, fishes include a much 
greater range of life history 
strategies.

  Population Ecology

 Charnov’s  approach  was  to  take  a  few  key  life  history 
features and convert them to dimensionless numbers. One of 
his  variables  was  relative  size  of  offspring.  He  created  this 
dimensionless  variable  by  dividing  the  mass  of  offspring  at 
independence  from  the  parent,  I,  by  the  adult  mass  at  first 
reproduction,  m.  The  result,  I/m,  is  the  size  of  offspring 
expressed as a proportion of adult body mass. While it is clear 
that an elephant is larger at independence than is a mouse at 
the  same  life  stage,  Charnov’s  approach  allows  us  to  deter-
mine whether one is relatively larger than the other. A young, 
newly independent mouse may represent as large a proportion 
of  its  parent’s  mass  as  a  young  elephant.  The  second  mea-
sure  was  proportion  of  adult  body  mass  allocated  to  repro-
duction per unit time, C, multiplied by the adult life span, E, 
which gives us an estimate of the fraction of adult body mass 
allocated to reproduction over a life span. As we have seen, 
higher  reproductive  effort  is  associated  with  shorter  adult 
life span (see  fig. 12.13 ) so Charnov reasoned their product 
might be similar for closely related taxa. Charnov chose these 
two dimensionless numbers (I/m and C•E) for two particular 
reasons.  First  R 0 ,  the  net  reproductive  rate  (see  p.  233)  is  a 
measure of an individual’s fitness in populations that are not 
growing. In addition, R 0  can be rewritten solely in terms of 
these two numbers and the chance of surviving to adulthood. 
 For  his  initial  classification  of  life  histories:  Charnov 
chose three groups of well-studied organisms, mammals, liz-
ards, and altricial birds. Altricial birds are those birds, ranging 
from  sparrows  to  eagles,  that  are  born  helpless  and  depend 
entirely on parental care to mature to independence. One of 
the striking results of using Charnov’s dimensionless analysis 
is that while there is little variation within mammals, lizards, 
or birds, there are substantial differences among these groups 
of animals.  Figure 12.23  shows that the birds have the highest 
I/m (essentially 1, since they raise their young to adult size) 
and C•E values. In contrast, lizards and mammals share the 
 same  C•E value but differ a lot in I/m (0.1 vs 0.3).     

 Previous  classifications  of  life  histories  have  revealed 
substantial variation within taxa, such as mammals and fish 
(see   fig.  12.22 ).  In  contrast,  Charnov’s  classification,  by 
removing the influences of time and size, allows us to see the 
great similarities within these groups and reveals the substan-
tial differences among them.  Figure 12.24  shows the results of 
plotting the average values of I/m and C•E for mammals, liz-
ards, and altricial birds. The striking separation of these taxa 
within the two dimensional plane of the graph suggests that 
mammals, lizards, and birds have life histories that are fun-
damentally different. But notice that lizards and mammals do 
not differ in the value of C•E, only I/m.   

 This  analysis  is  only  the  beginning,  however,  since  it 
raises many unanswered questions. Charnov wonders where 
bats will appear in his life history plane, since they raise their 
offspring to nearly adult size. He also raises a question about 
precocial birds, such as pheasants and quail, whose offspring 
are independent at a very small size. In terms of life history, 
will bats be more like altricial birds, while precocial birds are 
more  like  mammals?  Then  there  are  the  hundreds  of  thou-
sands of vascular plants to consider.

 The  knowledge  of  species  life  histories  revealed  by 
the studies of life history ecologists has produced a subdisci-
pline of ecology rich in both theory and biological detail. In 
the challenges that lie ahead as we work to conserve endan-
gered species, both theory and detailed knowledge of the life 
histories of individual species will be important. For instance, 
life history information is playing a key role in the conserva-
tion of riparian forests across western North America. 

  Concept 12.3 Review 

      1.   If a concept, such as  r  and K selection, does not fully 
represent  the  richness  of  life  history  variation  among 
species, can it still be valuable to science?  

     2.   Where would you place the following plant species, in 
Grime’s  and  in  Winemiller  and  Rose’s  classifications 
of life histories (see  figs. 12.20  and  12.21 )? The plant 
 species lives in an environment where it has access to 
plenty of water and nutrients but is subject to  disturbance 
by flooding and wind. An average individual produces 
 several  million  seeds  per  year  and  may  live  several 
 centuries. However, ideal conditions for reproduction by 
the species occurs only once or twice per decade.

 Applications 

Climate Change and Timing 
of Reproduction and Migration

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 12.17  Describe the role of phenological studies in evaluat-
ing the ecological consequences of climate change.
 12.18  Outline responses of plant and animal populations 

to climate warming.

Whether cycling between wet and dry periods in the tropics 
or  the  breaking  of  winter’s  cold  with  the  onset  of  spring  in 
temperate regions, seasonal change alters the physical condi-
tions to which organisms are exposed. Seasonal change also 
affects the availability of food and other resources on which 
organisms depend. In the face of such seasonal variation, tim-
ing  is  critical  for  successful  reproduction.  In  chapter  10  we 
examined the influence of changing climate on the distribu-
tions of organisms. Climate change is also altering the timing 
of life history events.

Written records show that people have been documenting 
seasonal events for centuries. For example, in 1736, Robert 
Marsham  began  keeping  a  record  of  the  first  date  of  flow-
ering  by  selected  plants,  the  first  calls  of  frogs,  and  other 

phenomena, which he referred to as “indications of spring.” 
Subsequent  generations  of  Marsham’s  family  continued  his 
annual observations on their estate in eastern England for over 
two centuries. Although the duration of this effort is impres-
sive, the record of cherry tree blooming dates at Kyoto, Japan, 
the  occasion  for  a  traditional  festival,  spans  an  incredible 
1,200 years. When modern researchers (Arakawa 1956, Aono 
and Saito 2010) began connecting the timing of that blooming 
to climate, they entered the realm of phenology. Phenology 
is the study of the timing of ecological events, especially in 
relation  to  climate  and  weather,  for  example,  the  arrival  of 
migratory birds on their  breeding grounds or the date of flow-
ering  by  a  plant  species,  such  as  the  cherry  trees  at  Kyoto. 
The study of phenology has assumed greater significance as 
concern over contemporary climate change has grown.

Altered Plant Phenology
Henry David Thoreau, best known for his book Walden, started 
one of the most useful records of North American plant phe-
nology in 1852. During the course of his studies from 1852 to 
1858, Thoreau documented the first flowering dates for over 
500 species of plants in the vicinity of Concord, Massachu-
setts.  Later, Abraham  Miller-Rushing  and  Richard  Primack 
compiled  the  phenological  records  of  Thoreau  along  with 
those of others covering the periods from 1878,  1888–1902, 
and  2003–2006  (Miller-Rushing  and  Primack  2008).  In  all, 
there were 25 years of blooming records in the data set. Of the 
hundreds  of  species  of  plants  in  the  record,  Miller-Rushing 
and Primack chose 43 for which there were the most observa-
tions across the years of record. They used these data to test 
the hypothesis that changes in climate since Thoreau made his 
observations have altered the flowering phenology of plants 
in Concord.

Miller-Rushing  and  Primack  found  that,  since  1852 
when Thoreau began his observations, temperatures in Con-
cord have increased and plants are blooming earlier in spring. 
Records  from  the  Blue  Hill  Meteorological  Observatory 
33  km  from  Concord  show  that  average  annual  tempera-
tures  have  increased  2.5°C  since  1852  and  that  the  average 
temperatures  in  January,  April,  and  May,  which  are  highly 
correlated  with  blooming  time,  have  increased  by  a  similar 
amount: 2.3°C. Earlier blooming by the plants in Concord is 
correlated with this rise in temperature. The average date of 
first flowering by the 43 species in the study is now 7 days 
earlier than in 1852 (fig. 12.25). However, some of the spe-
cies included in the analysis advanced their blooming much 
earlier in spring. For example, by 2006, highbush blueberry, 
Vaccinium  corymbosum, was blooming 21 days earlier than in 
1852, while yellow woodsorrel, Oxalis stricta, was blooming 
32 days earlier.

Ecologists  have  combined  phenological  observations  at 
single localities, such as at Concord, to test for phenological 
changes in plant populations across large regions. In one of 
the  most  ambitious  studies,  ecologists  tested  for  phenologi-
cal  changes  between  1971  and  2000  across  21  countries  in 
Europe,  covering  the  area  from  the  UK  to  Russia  and  from

Spain  to  Norway.  The  study  included  over  500  plant  spe-
cies  and  over  100,000  time  series  of  plant  phenology  each 
15 years or more in length (Menzel et al. 2006). This massive 
effort showed that the average date of first flowering and leaf 
unfolding occurred 2.5 days earlier per decade and fruit ripen-
ing advanced nearly the same amount (fig. 12.26). In contrast, 
researchers documented little change in the timing of leaf col-
oring  in  autumn.  Further  analyses  showed  that  the  changes 

Animal Phenology
Animals  are  also  adjusting  the  timing  of  life  histories  as 
the climate warms. For example, salmon are migrating from 
the ocean to freshwater earlier in the spring and many spe-
cies of butterflies and moths are increasing the number of 
generations  they  produce  in  a  year.  However,  migratory 
birds likely offer the best-documented changes in phenol-
ogy. One of the most commonly recorded migratory events 
has  been  the  first  arrival  date  of  migratory  birds  on  their 
breeding grounds, an event long noted by ornithologists and 
amateur birders.

Like first flowering date in plant populations in  temperate 
regions,  the  first  arrival  date  by  migratory  birds  is  now 
 occurring earlier in the spring compared to  historical records. 
Jessica Vitale  and William  Schlesinger  analyzed  a  123-year 
record (1885–2008) of first arrival dates for 44  species of birds 
migrating to Dutchess County in the Hudson River valley of 
New  York  (Vitale  and  Schlesinger  2011).  They   calibrated 
shifts  in  migrant  arrival  times  in  days  per   century.  Of  the 
44 bird species in the study, they found that 40 are now  arriving 
significantly  earlier.  However,  like  shifts  in  flowering  time 
observed  in  plant  populations,  there  is  significant   variation 
among  species.  For  example,  different  migration  sources 
have been associated repeatedly with variation in the magni-
tude of changes in first arrival date. In general, birds migrat-
ing from greater distances have shifted their first arrival dates 

Leaf unfolding, flowering, and 
fruit ripening shifted an
average of over 2 days earlier per 
decade between 1971 and 2000,
while leaf coloring in autumn
changed much less.

in  the  Dutchess  County  bird  migration  record,  where  birds 
 wintering  in  North  America  have  shifted  their  first  arrival

and  animals  has  been  highly  responsive  to  recent  climate 
change.

  Summary 

 Life  history  consists  of  the  adaptations  of  an  organism  that 
influence  aspects  of  its  biology,  such  as  the  number  of  off-
spring it produces, its survival, and its size and age at repro-
ductive maturity. This chapter presents discussions on some 
of the central concepts of life history ecology. 

  Because all organisms have access to limited energy 
and  other  resources,  there  is  a  trade-off  between  the 
number and size of offspring; those that produce larger 
offspring  are  constrained  to  produce  fewer,  whereas 
those that produce smaller offspring may produce larger 
numbers.   Turner  and  Trexler  found  that  larger  darter 
species produce larger numbers of eggs. Their results also 
support the generalization that there is a trade-off between 
offspring size and number. On average, darter species that 
produce  larger  eggs  produce  fewer  eggs.  They  found  a 
strong positive relationship between gene flow among darter 
populations  and  the  number  of  eggs  produced  by  females 
and a negative relationship between egg size and gene flow. 
Plant  ecologists  have  also  found  a  negative  relationship 
between sizes of seeds produced by plants and the number 
of seeds they produce. Westoby, Leishman, and Lord found 

that plants of different growth form and different seed dis-
persal mechanisms tend to produce seeds of different sizes. 
Larger seeds, on average, produce larger seedlings that have 
a higher probability of successfully recruiting, particularly 
in the face of environmental challenges such as shade and 
competition. 

  Where  adult  survival  is  lower,  organisms  begin 
 reproducing  at  an  earlier  age  and  invest  a  greater 
 proportion of their energy budget into reproduction; where 
adult  survival  is  higher,  organisms  defer   reproduction 
to  a  later  age  and  allocate  a  smaller  proportion  of  their 
resources to reproduction.   Shine and Charnov found that 
as survival of adult lizards and snakes increases, their age at 
maturity also increases. Gunderson found analogous patterns 
among  fish.  In  addition,  fish  with  higher  rates  of  mortality 
allocate a greater proportion of their biomass to reproduction. 
In other words, they show higher reproductive effort. These 
generalizations  are  supported  by  comparisons  both  between 
and within species. For instance, pumpkinseed sunfish allo-
cate greater energy, or biomass, to reproductive effort where 
adult pumpkinseed survival is lower.

Section III 

  Population Ecology

  The  great  diversity  of  life  histories  can  be   classified 
on the basis of a few population characteristics.  Examples 
include fecundity or number of offspring,       survival,      relative 
offspring  size,  and  age  at  reproductive   maturity.       One 
of the earliest attempts to organize information on the great 
variety of life histories that occur among species was under 
the heading of  r  selection and K selection.  r  selection refers 
to  the  per  capita  rate  of  increase,   r,   and  is  thought  to  favor 
higher  population  growth  rate.   r   selection  is  predicted  to 
be  strongest  in  disturbed  habitats.  K  selection  refers  to  the 
 carrying capacity in the logistic growth equation and is envi-
sioned as a form of natural selection favoring more efficient 
utilization  of  resources,  such  as  food  and  nutrients.  Grime 
described  plant  strategies,  or  life  histories,  that  match  the 
requirements of three environments: (1) low disturbance–low 
stress, (2) low disturbance–high stress, (3) high disturbance–
low stress. His plant strategies matching these  environmental 
conditions  were  competitive,  stress-tolerant,  and  ruderal. 
Based  on  life  history  patterns  among  fish,  Kirk Winemiller 

and Kenneth Rose proposed a classification of life histories 
based on  survivorship especially among juveniles,  l   x  , fecun-
dity  or  number  of  offspring  produced,  mx,  and  gene  ration 
time or age at maturity,  a . By basing their classification sys-
tem on some of the most basic aspects of population ecology, 
 l   x  ,   m   x  ,  and   a ,  Winemiller  and  Rose  established  a  common 
currency for representing and analyzing life history informa-
tion for any organism. 

 Eric  Charnov  developed  a  new  approach  to  life  history 
classification free of the influences of size and time that facili-
tates the exploration of life history variation within and among 
groups of closely related taxa. Charnov’s classification, based 
on relative offspring size, I/m, and fraction of adult body mass 
allocated to reproduction over a life span, C•E, suggests that 
mammals,  lizards,  and  altricial  birds  have  life  histories  that 
are substantially different. 

 Shifts in first flowering dates of plants and arrival times by 
migratory birds on their breeding grounds in  temperate regions 
have been highly responsive to recent climate warming.

 Review Questions 

    1.  The discussion of seed size and number focused mainly on the 
advantages associated with large seeds. However, research by 
Westoby, Leishman, and Lord has revealed that the plants from 
widely separated geographic regions produce a wide variety of 
seed sizes. If this variation is to be maintained, what are some 
of the advantages associated with producing small seeds?  

    2.  Under  what  conditions  should  natural  selection  favor  produc-
tion of many small offspring versus the production of a few well 
provisioned offspring?  

    3.  Plant  ecologists  using  experimental  studies  have  verified  that 
seedlings growing from larger seeds have a better chance of sur-
viving environmental challenges such as deep shade, drought, 
physical injury, and competition from other plants. Explain how 
growing from larger seeds could give an advantage to seedlings 
facing strong environmental challenge to their establishing.  

    4.  The  studies  by  Shine  and  Charnov  (1992)  and  Gunderson 
(1997)  addressed  important  questions  of  concern  to  life  his-
tory ecologists and their work provided robust answers to those 
questions. However, the methods they employed differed sub-
stantially from those used in most of the studies discussed in 
this and other chapters. The chief difference is that both relied 

heavily on data on life histories published previously by other 
authors. What was it about the nature of the problems addressed 
by these authors that constrained them to use this approach? In 
what types of studies would it be most appropriate to perform a 
synthesis of previously published information?  

    5.  Much of our discussion of life history variation involved varia-
tion among species within groups as broadly defined as “fish,” 
“plants,” or “reptiles.” However, the work of Bertschy and Fox 
revealed significant variation in life history within species. In 
general, what should be the relative amount of variation within 
a species compared to that among many species? Develop your 
discussion  using  relative  amounts  of  genetic  variation  upon 
which  natural  selection  might  act. You  might  review  the  sec-
tions discussing the evolutionary significance of genetic varia-
tion in chapter 4.  

    6.  Grime’s  proposed  classification  of  environments  based  on 
intensity  of  disturbance  and  stress  resulted  in  four  environ-
ments, three of which he proposed were inhabitable by plants 
and  one  of  which  was  not.  That  fourth  environment  shows 
high intensity of disturbance and high stress. What sorts of life 
histories would an organism have to possess to live in such an 

 

Chapter 12 

  Life Histories 

281

environment? What  kinds  of  real  organisms  can  you  think  of 
that could live and perhaps thrive in such an environment?  

    7.  Once established, Rio Grande cottonwoods can live to be well 
over 100 years old. However, they experience very high rates 
of mortality as seeds, which only germinate in conditions that 
occur very unpredictably in time and space. Female cottonwood 
trees produce about 25 million seeds annually and could pro-
duce up to 2.5 billion seeds during a lifetime. Which of the life 
history categories that we’ve discussed most closely match the 
life history of the Rio Grande cottonwood?  

    8.  Using what you know about the trade-off between seed number 
and seed size (e.g.,  fig. 12.7 ) and patterns of variation among 

plants,  predict  the  relative  number  of  seeds  produced  by  the 
various  plant  growth  forms  and  dispersal  strategies  listed  in 
 figure 12.8 ?  

    9.  Apply Winemiller’s model to plants. If you were to construct 
a strictly quantitative classification of plant life histories using 
Winemiller and Rose’s approach, what information would you 
need  about  the  plants  included  in  your  analysis?  How  many 
plant species would you need to have an idea of how variation 
in their life histories compares with those of animals (e.g., as in 
 fig. 12.22 )? Try to reconcile Grime’s plant classification with 
the  scheme  offered  by Winemiller  and  Rose. Where  are  they 
similar? How are they different?

 Competition 

   A section of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, rich in coral  species. 
Coral reefs are often sites of intense competition for limited space 
among corals, which compete using a wide variety of techniques, 
 including overgrowing neighboring coral colonies, digesting the  tissues 
of adjacent colonies, depositing mucus that contains stinging cells 
on neighboring colonies, and killing the tissues of nearby corals with 
 elongated “sweeper” tentacles.

Along a coral reef off the north coast of Jamaica, three 
spot damselfish guard small territories of less than 1 m 2 . These 
small territories are regularly spaced across the reef and con-
tain  most  of  the  resources  upon  which  damselfish  depend: 
nooks  and  crannies  for  shelter  against  predators,  a  carefully 
tended  patch  of  fast-growing  algae  for  food,  and  in  the  ter-
ritories of males, an area of coral rubble kept clean for spawn-
ing.  Damselfish  constantly  patrol  and  survey  the  borders  of

the two blennies shown in this photo often compete intensely for space. 

their territories, vigorously attacking any intruder that presents 
a threat to their eggs and developing larvae, or to their food 
supply. If you look carefully, however, you may find that not 
all  members  of  the  population  have  a  territory.  Damselfish 
without territories live in marginal areas around the territorial 
members, wandering from one part of the reef to another.   

 If you create a vacancy on the reef by removing one of the 
damselfish holding a territory, other damselfish appear within 
minutes to claim the vacant territory. Some of the new arrivals 
are threespot damselfish like the original resident, and some 
are cocoa damselfish, which generally live a bit higher on the 
reef face. These new arrivals fight fiercely for the vacated terri-
tory. The damselfish chase each other, nip each other’s flanks, 
and  slap  each  other  with  their  tails.  The  melee  ends  within 
minutes, and life among the damselfish settles back into a kind 
of tense tranquility. The new resident, which may have driven 
off a half dozen rivals, is usually another threespot damselfish. 
 This  example  demonstrates  several  things.  First,  individ-
ual damselfish maintain possession of their territories through 
ongoing  competition  with  other  damselfish,  and  this  competi-
tion takes the form of    interference competition    ,  which involves 
direct interactions between individuals. In the case of threespot 
and cocoa damselfish, interference competition takes the form 
of aggressive defense of territories. Other organisms engaging 
in interference competition produce chemical toxins that harm 
potential competitors. Still others interfere with competitors by 
growing over them, causing direct harm, or reducing the com-
petitor’s  access  to  resources,  such  as  food  or  light.  Second, 
though it may not appear so to the casual observer, there is a lim-
ited supply of suitable space for damselfish territories, a condi-
tion that ecologists call    resource limitation    .  Third, the threespot 
damselfish  are  subject  to     intraspecific  competition    ,   competi-
tion with members of their own species, as well as    interspecific 
competition    ,   competition  between  individuals  of  two  species 
that reduces the fitness of both. The effects of competition on the 
two competitors may not be equal, however. The individuals of 
one species may suffer greatly reduced fitness while those of the 
second are affected very little. The observation that threespots 
generally win in aggressive encounters with cocoa damselfish 
suggests this sort of competitive asymmetry. 

 Figure 13.2   Competition in a forest can be as intense as 
 competition on a coral reef. However, much of the competition in 
a forest takes place underground, where the roots of plants compete 
for water and nutrients.

 Competition is not always as dramatic as fighting damsel-
fish nor is it always resolved so quickly ( fig. 13.2 ). In a mature 
white pine forest in New Hampshire, tree roots grow throughout 
the soil taking up nutrients and water as they provide support. 
In 1922, James Toumey designed an experiment to determine 
whether the high density of pine roots suppresses the growth of 
other plants. Researchers cut a trench, 0.92 m deep, around a 
plot 2.74 m by 2.74 m in the middle of the forest. In so doing, 
they  cut  825  roots,  mainly  those  of  pines,  which  removed 
potential  competition  by  these  roots  for  soil  resources. They 
also established untrenched control plots on either side of the 
trenched plot and then watched as the results of their experi-
ment  unfolded.  The  experiment  continued  for  8  years,  with 
retrenching  every  2  years  and  over  100  roots  cut  each  time. 
By retrenching, the researchers maintained their experimental 
treatment, suppression of potential root competition.     

 In the end, this 8-year experiment (Toumey and Kienholz 
1931) yielded results as dramatic as those with the damsel-
fish. Vegetative cover in trenched plots of forest floor that had 
been released from root competition was 10 times higher than 
in the control plots. Apparently the roots of white pines exert 
interspecific competition for limited supplies of nutrients and 
water that is strong enough to suppress the growth of forest 
floor vegetation especially growth of herbaceous plants, hem-
lock, and white pine seedlings. The high density of white pine 
seedlings in trenched plots showed that intraspecific compe-
tition was occurring as well. Competition involving the use 
of such limited resources is called    resource    or    exploitative 
competition    .  

 Ecologists have long thought that competition is pervasive 
in nature. For instance, Darwin thought that interspecific com-
petition was an important source of natural selection. While 
ecologists  have  shown  that  interspecific  competition  sub-
stantially influences the distribution and abundance of many 
species, they have also questioned the assumption that compe-
tition is an all-important organizer of nature. Such  questioning 
has stimulated more careful research and more rigorous test-
ing of the influence of competition on populations.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 13.3  Outline the 23/2 self-thinning rule.
 13.4  Explain how the observation of self-thinning among 
plants provides evidence for intraspecific competition.

 13.5  Discuss studies demonstrating intraspecific compe-
tition among planthoppers (Prokelisia marginata) 
and terrestrial isopods (Porcellio scaber).

Laboratory and field studies reveal intraspecific competi-
tion.  
In chapter 11, we saw that slowing population growth 
at high densities produces a sigmoidal, or S-shaped, pattern 
in which population size levels off at carrying capacity. Our 
assumption in that discussion was that intraspecific competi-
tion for limited resources plays a key role in slowing popu-
lation  growth  at  higher  densities. The  effect  of  intraspecific 
competition  is  included  in  the  model  of  logistic  population 
growth. If competition is an important and common phenom-
enon in nature, then we should be able to observe it among 
individuals of the same species, individuals with identical or 
very  similar  resource  requirements. Thus  we  begin  our  dis-
cussion of competition with intraspecific competition.  

   Intraspecific Competition 
Among Plants 
 In chapter 7, we reviewed experiments by David Tilman and 
M.  Cowan  (1989)  that  showed  how  plants  alter  root:shoot 
ratios in response to availability of soil nitrogen (see fig. 7.26). 
The  same  experiments  also  included  evidence  for  intraspe-
cific  competition.  When  Tilman  and  Cowan  grew  the  grass 
Sorghastrum nutans  at low density (7 plants per pot) and high 
density (100 plants per pot), those grown at low density grew 
to a larger size at all nitrogen concentrations ( fig. 13.3 ). These 
results suggest that competition for nitrogen (resources) was 
more  intense  at  the  higher  plant  population  density.  Such 

competition for limited resources occurs in natural populations 
where it may lead to mortality among the competing plants. 

 The development of a stand of plants from the seedling 
stage  to  mature  individuals  suggests  competition  for  limited 
resources. Each spring as the seeds of annual plants germinate, 
their  population  density  often  numbers  in  the   thousands  per 
square meter. However, as the season progresses and individ-
ual plants grow, population density declines. This same pattern 
occurs in the development of a stand of trees. As the stand of 
trees develops, more and more biomass is composed of fewer 
and fewer individuals. This process is called    self-thinning    .  

 Self-thinning appears to result from intraspecific compe-
tition  for  limited  resources. As  a  local  population  of  plants 
develops,  individual  plants  take  up  increasing  quantities  of 
nutrients, water, and space for which some individuals com-
pete  more  successfully.  The  losers  in  this  competition  for 
resources  die,  and  population  density  decreases,  or  “thins,” 
as a consequence. Over time the population is composed of 
fewer and fewer large individuals. 

 One way to represent the self-thinning process is to plot 
total plant biomass against population density. If we plot the 
logarithm of plant biomass against the logarithm of plant den-
sity,  the  slope  of  the  resulting  line  averages  around   2 ½.  In 
other words, plant population density declines more rapidly 
than biomass increases ( fig. 13.4 ).     

 Another way to represent the self-thinning process is to 
plot the average weight of individual plants in a stand against 
density ( fig. 13.5 ). The slope of the line in such plots averages 
around    23/2.  Because self-thinning by many species of plants 
comes close to a    23/2  relationship, this relationship has come 
to be called the       23/2    self-thinning rule    .  The    23/2  self-thinning 
rule was first proposed by K. Yoda and colleagues (1963) and 
amplified by White and Harper (1970), who provided many 
additional  examples  (e.g.,  see   fig.  13.5 ).  Subsequently,  the 
self-thinning rule became widely accepted among ecologists.     

The self-thinning rule predicts that 
plants will decrease in population 
density (self-thin) as the total 
biomass of the population increases.

 Figure 13.5   Self-thinning in populations of alfalfa,  Medicago 
sativa  (data from White and Harper 1970).

 Recent  analyses  have  shown  that  self-thinning  in  some 
plant  populations  deviates  significantly  from  the     23/2   (or 
 2 ½ for biomass-numbers) slope. However, regardless of the 
precise  trajectory  followed  by  different  plant  populations, 
self-thinning  of  plant  populations  has  been  demonstrated 
repeatedly. The important point, from the perspective of our 
present discussion, is that self-thinning occurs in plant pop-
ulations  and  appears  to  be  the  consequence  of  intraspecific 
competition  for  limited  resources.  Resource  limitation  has 
also been demonstrated in experiments on intraspecific com-
petition within animal populations.  

  Intraspecific Competition 
Among Planthoppers 
 Ecologists  have  often  failed  to  demonstrate  that  insects,  par-
ticularly herbivorous insects, compete. However, one group of 
insects in which competition has been repeatedly demonstrated 
is the Homoptera, including the leafhoppers, planthoppers, and 
aphids. Robert Denno and George Roderick (1992), who studied 
interactions  among  planthoppers  (Homoptera,  Delphacidae), 
attribute the prevalence of competition among the Homoptera to 
their habit of aggregating, to their rapid population growth, and 
to the mobile nature of their food supply, plant fluids. 

 Denno and Roderick demonstrated intraspecific competi-
tion within populations of the planthopper  Prokelisia margin-
ata,  which lives on the salt marsh grass  Spartina alterniflora  
along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. The 
population density of  P. marginata  was controlled by enclos-
ing the insects with  Spartina  seedlings at densities of 3, 11, 
and 40 leafhoppers per cage, densities that are within the range 
at which they live in nature. At the highest density,  P. mar-
ginata  showed reduced survivorship, decreased body length, 
and increased developmental time ( fig. 13.6 ). These signs of 
intraspecific competition were probably the result of reduced

ily populated by planthoppers show reduced concentrations of 
protein, chlorophyll, and moisture. As  demonstrated in the fol-
lowing example, however, intraspecific interference competi-
tion may occur in the absence of obvious resource limitation.      

  Interference Competition Among Terrestrial 
Isopods 
 Edwin Grosholz (1992) used a field experiment to study the 
effects of a wide range of biotic interactions on the popula-
tion  biology  of  the  terrestrial  isopod   Porcellio  scaber.   This 
organism, which is associated with human activities such as 
farming  and  gardening  and  is  found  throughout  the  world, 
sometimes lives at densities in excess of 2,000 individuals per 
square meter. Such high densities suggest a strong potential 
for intraspecific competition. 

 Grosholz  conducted  his  experiments  on  an  outdoor 
grid of 48, 0.36  m 2  plots enclosed by aluminum flashing. To 
control  isopod  movements,  he  buried  the  flashing  12.5  cm 
into the soil and extended it 12.5 cm above the soil surface. 
Two experimental treatments were used: (1) to test for food 
limitation, the food within the enclosures was supplemented 
by  adding  sliced  carrots  and  potatoes,  and  (2)  to  test  for 
 density  effects,  study  plots  were  stocked  with  either  100  or

The competitive exclusion principle proposes that two spe-
cies with identical niches cannot coexist indefinitely, which 
leads to the prediction that coexisting species will have dif-
ferent niches.   As we saw earlier (see p. 200), the niche con-
cept was developed over a period of several decades; however, 
it  was  within  the  context  of  interspecific  competition  that  the 
importance of the niche concept was fully realized. The work 
of  G.  F.  Gause  (1934),  whose  principal  interest  was  interspe-
cific competition, helped ensure a prominent place for the niche 
concept in modern ecology. Particularly important was Gause’s  
competitive exclusion principle    ,  which states that two species 
with identical niches cannot coexist indefinitely. Gause experi-
mented with competition in the laboratory and obtained results 
indicating that when two species compete, one will be a more 
effective competitor for limited resources, that is, will be more 
effective at converting resources into offspring. As a consequence, 
the  more  effective  competitor  will  have  higher  fitness  (higher 
reproductive success) and will eventually exclude all individuals 
of the second species. The competitive exclusion principle set the 
niche concept in a broader context. After Gause’s experiments 
and studies, describing the niches of species was a stepping-stone 
to understanding interactions between species—a potential key 
to understanding the organization of nature. In the case of inter-
specific  competition,  the  competitive  exclusion  principle  leads 
to the prediction that species living together will generally have 
different niches, a concept we first encountered in chapter 1 in 
connection with Robert MacArthur’s warbler studies. 

 Why do we revisit the niche concept here? The reason is 
that we, like the first ecologists to use the term, need a concept 
that represents all the environmental interactions of a species. 
The niche concept carries us beyond the details of individual 
species’ requirements to a position where we can more easily 
consider the ecology of interactions between species, through 
differences, similarities, or complementarities of their niches. 
Thomas Schoener (2009) provides a comprehensive discussion 
of the various perspectives on the nature of the ecological niche. 
 Do you think it’s possible to completely describe Hutchin-
son’s   n -dimensional  hypervolume  niche  (see  p.  200)  for  any 
species? Probably not, since there are so many environmental 
factors that potentially influence survival and reproduction. For-
tunately, it appears that niches are, in some cases, determined 
mostly by a few environmental factors and therefore ecologists 
are able to apply a simplified version of Hutchinson’s compre-
hensive  niche  concept.  In  studies  of  animals,  ecologists  have 
frequently described niches in terms of their feeding biology.  

   The Feeding Niches of Darwin’s Finches 
 As  we  saw  in  chapter  10,  availability  of  suitable  food  sig-
nificantly  affects  the  survival  and  reproduction  of  Darwin’s 
finches.  In  other  words,  food  has  a  major  influence  on  the 
niches of Darwin’s finches. Because the kinds of food used 
by birds are largely reflected by the form of their beaks, David

by   P.  scaber,   indicating  that  food  was  not  limiting  survival .
However, survival was lower at the higher population density 
( fig.  13.7 ).  Grosholz  attributed  lower  survival  at  the  higher 
density  to  cannibalism,  a  common  occurrence  in  terrestrial 
isopods. The study offers interesting insights into the role that 
interference may play in intraspecific competition, even in the 
absence of obvious resource limitation.     

 As we move from discussions of intraspecific to interspe-
cific competition, we need to back up a bit and reconsider the 
niche. We  do  this  because  interspecific  competition  usually 
occurs  among  species  with  similar  environmental  require-
ments, that is, among species with similar niches. 

  Concept 13.1 Review 

1.   Do you think that Grosholz might have observed food 
limitation  if  he  had  used  higher  densities  of   Porcellio 
scaber  in his experiments?  

2.   How might using other indicators of competition, such 
as growth rate, reproductive rate, and size at maturity, 
have affected Grosholz’s conclusions regarding lack of 
food limitation in his study populations?

Lack (1947) linked differences in beak size and form among 
Darwin’s finches to differences in their feeding niches. Build-
ing  on  Lack’s  earlier  work,  Peter  Grant  (1986)  and  his  col-
leagues  represented  the  feeding  niches  of  Darwin’s  finches 
by their beak morphology. For instance, differences in beak 
size  among  small,  medium,  and  large  ground  finches  trans-
late directly into differences in diet. The large ground finch, 
 Geospiza magnirostris,  eats larger seeds; the medium ground 
finch,   G.  fortis,   eats  medium-sized  seeds;  while  the  small 
ground finch,  G. fuliginosa,  eats small seeds ( fig. 13.8 ).     

 The size of seeds that can be eaten by Darwin’s finches 
can  be  estimated  by  simply  measuring  the  depths  of  their 
beaks. Studies of seed use by  G. fortis  on Daphne Major Island 
showed clearly that even within species, beak size affects the 
composition  of  the  diet.  Within  this  population,  individuals 
with the deepest beaks fed on the hardest seeds, while individ-
uals with the smallest beaks fed on the softest seeds ( fig. 13.9 ).     
 The importance of beak size to seed use was also dem-
onstrated by the effects of the 1977 drought on the  G.  fortis  
population  of  Daphne  Major.  In  chapter  11,  we  saw  how 
this  drought  caused  substantial  mortality  in  this  population 
(see fig. 11.17). However, this mortality did not fall equally 
on all segments of the population. As seeds were depleted, the 
birds ate the smallest and softest seeds first, leaving the larg-
est and toughest seeds ( fig. 13.10 ). In other words, following 
the drought, not only were seeds in short supply, the remain-
ing seeds were also tougher to crack. Because they could not 
crack  the  remaining  seeds,  mortality  fell  most  heavily  on 
smaller birds with smaller beaks. Consequently, at the end of

dominated  by  larger  individuals  with  larger,  stronger  beaks 
that had survived by feeding on hard seeds ( fig. 13.11 ).         

 These  studies  show  that  beak  size  provides  significant 
insights into the feeding biology of Darwin’s ground finches. 
Since  food  is  the  major  determinant  of  survival  and  repro-
duction among these birds, beak morphology gives us a very 
good  picture  of  their  niches.  However,  the  niches  of  other 
kinds of organisms are determined by entirely different envi-
ronmental  factors.  Let’s  consider  the  niche  of  a  dominant 
 species in salt marshes.

 Figure 13.12   The salt marsh grass  Spartina anglica,  originated 
on the coast of England as a hybrid of European and North American 
 species of salt marsh grasses and has since spread to salt marshes in 
many parts of the world.

  The Habitat Niche of a Salt Marsh Grass 
 Biologists discovered  Spartina anglica  approximately one cen-
tury ago, as a new species recently produced by    allopolyploidy    
( fig. 13.12 ). Allopolyploidy is a process of speciation initiated 
by hybridization of two different species.  S. anglica  arose ini-
tially as a cross between  S. maritima,  a European species, and 
 S. alterniflora,  a North American species. At least one of these 
hybrid plants later doubled its chromosome number, making it 
capable of sexual reproduction, and produced a new species: 
 S. anglica.  From its center of origin in Lymington, Hampshire, 
England,  S. anglica  spread northward along the coasts of the 
British Isles. During this same period, it colonized the coast of 
France and was widely planted elsewhere in northwest Europe 
as  well  as  along  the  coasts  of  New  Zealand, Australia,  and

China. The Chinese population of this salt marsh grass, estab-
lished from only 21 plants in 1963, grew to cover thousands 
of  hectares.   S.  anglica   is  extensively  planted  for   stabilizing 
mudflats  because  it  is  more  tolerant  of  periodic  inundation 
and  water-saturated  soils  than  most  salt  marsh  plants.  This 
environmental tolerance is reflected in the distribution of the 
plant  in  northwestern  Europe,  where  it  generally  inhabits 
the most seaward zone of any of the salt marsh plants.     

 The  local  distribution  of   S.  anglica   in  the  British  Isles 
is  well  predicted  by  a  few  physical  variables  related  to  the 
duration and frequency of inundation by tides and waves. The 
lower and upper intertidal limits of the grass are mainly deter-
mined  by  the  magnitude  of  tidal  fluctuations  during  spring 
tides. Where tidal fluctuations are greater, both the lower and 
upper  limits  are  higher  on  the  shore.  However,  throughout 
its  British  range,  the  grass  generally  occupies  the  intertidal 
between mean high-water spring tides and mean high-water 
neap  tides  ( fig.  13.13 ). A  second  factor  that  determines  the 
local  distribution  of   S.  anglica   is  the     fetch     of  the  estuary. 
The fetch of a body of water is the longest distance over which 
wind can blow and is directly related to the maximum size of 
waves that can be generated by wind. All other factors being 
equal, larger waves occur on estuaries with greater fetch. The 
larger the fetch, the higher  S. anglica  must live in an estuary 
to avoid disturbance by waves.     

 The  upper  limit  of   S.  anglica ’s  distribution  within  the 
intertidal zone is also negatively correlated with latitude. In 
northerly locations within the British Isles, the grass does not 
occur quite as high in the intertidal zone as it does in the south. 
What factors might restrict the distribution at northern sites? 
One factor we should consider is that  S. anglica  is a C 4  plant. 
Remember from chapter 7 that C 4  grasses generally do bet-
ter in warm environments. In northerly locations,  S. anglica  
is  replaced  in  the  upper  intertidal  zone  by  C 3   plants.  Could 
it  be  that  competition  with  these  C 3   plants  at  northern  sites 
excludes  S. anglica  from the upper intertidal zone? We’ll take 
up this question later in chapter 13 when we discuss experi-
mental approaches to the study of competition.

competition to shape species niches?       

  13.3   Mathematical and 
Laboratory Models 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 13.10  Describe the competition coefficient.
 13.11  Predict competitive exclusion or coexistence of spe-

cies using graphs showing the orientations of the 
isoclines for zero population growth for two species 
involved in interspecific competition.

 13.12  Explain the general biological conditions for coex-
istence of two species according the Lotka-Volterra 
competition model.

 13.13  Describe how laboratory models of competition 
have provided insights into the biological details 
involved in interspecific competition between 
closely related species.

Mathematical and laboratory models provide a theoreti-
cal  foundation  for  studying  interspecific  competition  in 
nature.  
In  the  study  of  interspecific  competition,  math-
ematical and laboratory models have played complementary 
roles. Both mathematical and laboratory models are generally 
much  simpler  than  the  natural  circumstances  the  ecologist 
wishes  to  understand.  However,  while  sacrificing  accuracy, 
this simplicity offers a degree of control that ecologists would 
not have in most natural settings. 

 D.  B.  Mertz  (1972)  began  a  review  of  four  decades  of 
research on  Tribolium  beetle populations with an astute sum-
mary  of  the  characteristics  of  models  in  general  and  of  the 
“ Tribolium   model”  in  particular:  (1)  the   Tribolium  model   is 
an abstraction and simplification, not a facsimile, of nature; 
(2) except for the beetles themselves, it is a man-made con-
struct, partly empirical and partly deductive; and (3) it is used 
to provide insights into natural phenomena. The predictions of 
these simplified models can be tested in natural systems and 
either supported or falsified. If falsified, a theory can be modi-
fied to accommodate the new information. Ideally, scientific 
understanding  proceeds  as  a  consequence  of  this  exchange 
between theory and observation and experiment.  

   Modeling Interspecific 
Competition 
 As  we  saw  in  chapter  11,  the  model  of  logistic  population 
growth includes a term for intraspecific competition but can be 
expanded to include the influence of interspecific competition 

on  population  growth.  The  first  to  do  so  was  Vito  Volterra 
(1926), who was interested in developing a theoretical basis 
for  explaining  changes  in  the  composition  of  a  marine  fish 
community in response to reduced fishing during World War I. 
Alfred Lotka (1932b) independently repeated Volterra’s anal-
ysis and extended it using graphics to represent changes in the 
population densities of competing species during competition. 
 Let’s  retrace  the  steps  of  Lotka’s  and Volterra’s  model-
ing exercise, beginning with the logistic model for population 
growth discussed in chapter 11:

   = rmax N  (   K − N 
  )     
  dN ___ 
_____ 
dt

 
K

We  can  express  the  population  growth  of  two  species  of 
potential competitors with the logistic equation:

    = r1N1  (   
dN1 
____ 
  
dt

K1 − N1 
  )     
_______ 
K1

 

and

    = r2N2  (   
dN2 
____ 
  
dt

K2 − N2 
  )    
_______ 
K2

 

 where   N  1   and   N  2   are  the  population  sizes  of  species  1  and 
2,  K  1  and  K  2  are their carrying capacities, and  r    1  and  r    2  are 
the intrinsic rates of increase for species 1 and 2, which are 
expressed when their population sizes are very low and poten-
tially limiting resources, such as food or space, are abundant. 
 In these models, population growth slows as  N  increases 
and the relative level of intraspecific competition is expressed 
as the ratio of numbers to carrying capacity, either  N  1 / K  1  or 
 N  2 / K  2 .  The  assumption  here  is  that  resource  supplies  will 
diminish as population size increases due to intraspecific com-
petition for resources. Resource levels can also be reduced by 
interspecific competition. 

 Lotka  and  Volterra  included  the  effect  of  interspecific 

competition on the population growth of each species as:

    = r1N1  (   
dN1 
____ 
  
dt

K1 − N1 − a12N2 
  )     
______________ 

 
 
K1

and

    = r2N2  (   
dN2 
____ 
     
dt

K2 − N2 − a21N1 
  )   
______________ 

 
 
K2

 In these models, the rate of population growth of a species is 
reduced both by conspecifics (individuals of the same species) 
and by individuals of the competing species, that is, interspe-
cific competition. The effects of intraspecific competition (2 N  1  
and  2  N  2 ) are already included in the logistic models for popu-
lation growth. The effect of interspecific competition is incor-
porated into the Lotka-Volterra model by  2  a  12  N  2  and  2  a  21  N  1 . 
The terms  a  12  and  a  21  are called     competition  coefficients    and 
express the competitive effects of the competing species. Spe-
cifically,  a  12  is the effect of an individual of species 2 on an 

290 

Section IV 

 

Interactions

individual  of  species  1,  relative  to  the  competitive  effects  of 
an individual of species 1. Meanwhile,  a  21  is the effect of an 
individual of species 1 on an individual of species 2 relative 
to the competitive effects of an individual of species 2. In this 
model, interspecific competitive effects are expressed in terms 
of intraspecific equivalents. If, for example,  a  12  > 1, then the 
competitive effect of an individual of species 2 on the popula-
tion growth of species 1 is greater than that of an individual of 
species 1. If, on the other hand,  a  12  < 1, then the competitive 
effect of an individual of species 2 on the population growth of 
species 1 is less than that of an individual of species 1. 

 In general, the Lotka-Volterra model predicts coexistence 
of two species when, for both species, interspecific competi-
tion is weaker than intraspecific competition. Otherwise, one 
species  is  predicted  to  eventually  exclude  the  other.  These 
conclusions come from the following analysis. 

 Populations of species 1 and 2 stop growing when:   

    = r1N1  (   
dN1 
____ 
  
dt

K1 − N1 − a12N2 
  )  = 0 
______________ 

 
 
K1

and

    = r2N2  (   
dN2 
____ 
  
dt

K2 − N2 − a21N1 
  )  = 0
______________ 

 
 
K2

    That is, when:   

(K1 − N1 − a12N2) = 0     and     (K2 − N2 − a21N1) = 0 

Or,  rearranging  these  equations,  we  predict  that  population 
growth for the two species will stop when:

   N1 = K1 − a12N2     and     N2 = K2 − a21N1  

 These are equations for straight lines, called    isoclines of zero 
population growth    ,  where everywhere along the lines popu-
lation growth is stopped:
dN1 
____ 
     
dt

    = 0     and       

dN2 
____ 
dt

    = 0  

 Above an isocline of zero growth, the population of a species 
is decreasing; below it the population is increasing ( fig. 13.14 ).     
 The  isoclines  of  zero  population  growth  show  how  the 
environment can be filled up or, in other words, the relative 
population sizes of species 1 and species 2 that will deplete 
the critical resources. At one extreme, for example, for spe-
cies 1, the environment is completely filled by species 1 and 
species 2 is absent. This occurs where  N  1  5  K  1 . At the other 
extreme, again for species 1, the environment can be saturated 
entirely by species 2, while species 1 is absent. This occurs 
where  N  2   5   K  1 / a  12 . In between these extremes, the environ-
ment is saturated with a mixture of species 1 and 2. The graph 
of the isocline for zero population growth for species 2 can be 
interpreted in a similar way. 

 Putting  the  isoclines  of  zero  population  growth  for  the 
two species on the same axis allows us to predict if one spe-
cies  will  exclude  the  other  or  whether  the  two  species  will 
coexist. The precise prediction depends upon the relative ori-
entation of the two isoclines. As shown in  figure 13.14 , there 
are four possibilities. 

 The Lotka-Volterra model predicts that one species will 
exclude the other when the isoclines do not cross. If the iso-
cline for species 1 lies above that of species 2, species 1 will 
eventually exclude species 2. This exclusion occurs because 
all growth trajectories lead to the point where  N  1   5   K  1  and 
 N  2   5  0 (see  fig. 13.14 a  ).  Figure 13.14 b   portrays the opposite 
situation in which the isocline for species 2 lies completely 
above that of species 1 and species 2 excludes species 1. In

this  case,  all  trajectories  of  population  growth  lead  to  the 
point where  N  2   5   K  2  and  N  1   5  0. 

 Coexistence is possible only in the situations in which the 
isoclines cross. However, only one of these situations leads to 
stable coexistence.  Figure 13.14 c   shows the situation in which 
coexistence is possible at the point where the isoclines of zero 
population  growth  cross  but  coexistence  is  unstable.  In  this 
situation,  K  1  >  K  2 / a  21  and  K  2  >  K  1 / a  12  and most population 
growth trajectories lead either to the points where  N  1   5   K  1  and 
 N  2   5  0 or to where  N  2   5   K  2  and  N  1   5  0. The populations of 
species 1 and 2 may arrive at the point where the lines cross, 
but  any  environmental  variation  that  moves  the  populations 
off this point eventually leads to exclusion of one species by 
the other.  Figure 13.14 d   represents the only situation that pre-
dicts stable coexistence of the two species. In this situation, 
 K  2 / a  21  >  K  1  and  K  1 / a  12  >  K  2  and all growth trajectories lead to 
the point where the isoclines of zero population growth cross. 
 What  is  the  biological  meaning  of  saying  that  all  growth 
trajectories lead to the point where the isoclines of zero growth 
cross? What this means is that the relative abundances of species 
1 and 2 will eventually arrive at the point where the isoclines 
cross, a point where the abundances of both species are greater 
than zero. In this situation, each species is limited more by mem-
bers of their own species than they are by members of the other 
species. In other words, the Lotka-Volterra model predicts that 
species coexist when intraspecific competition is stronger than 
interspecific  competition.  This  prediction  is  supported  by  the 
results of laboratory experiments on interspecific competition.  

  Laboratory Models of Competition 
  Experiments with  Paramecia  
 G.  F.  Gause  (1934)  used  laboratory  experiments  to  test  the 
major  predictions  of  the  Lotka-Volterra  competition  model. 
During the course of his work Gause experimented with many 
organisms, but the most well known of his experimental sub-
jects were paramecia. Paramecia are freshwater, ciliated proto-
zoans that offer several advantages for laboratory work. First, 
since  they  are  small,  they  can  be  kept  in  large  numbers  in  a 
small space and some of their natural habitats are fairly well 
simulated by laboratory aquaria. In addition, paramecia feed on 
microorganisms, which can be cultured in the laboratory and 
provided in whatever concentration desired by the experimenter. 
 In  one  of  his  most  famous  experiments,  Gause  studied 
competition  between   Paramecium  caudatum   and   P.  aurelia.  
The question he posed was: Would one of these two species 
drive the other to extinction if grown together in microcosms 
where they were forced to compete with each other for a lim-
ited food supply? 

 Gause demonstrated resource limitation by growing pure 
populations of  P. caudatum  and  P. aurelia  in the presence of two 
different  concentrations  of  their  food,  the  bacterium   Bacillus 
pyocyaneus.  Gause observed sigmoidal growth with an obvious 
carrying capacity at both full- and half-strength concentrations 
of the food supply ( fig. 13.15 ). In a full-strength concentration 
of food, the carrying capacity of  P. aurelia  was 195. When food 
availability  was  halved,  the  carrying  capacity  of  this  species

was reduced to 105.  P. caudatum  showed a similar response to 
food concentration. In the presence of a full-strength concen-
tration  of  food,   P.  caudatum   had  a  carrying  capacity  of  137. 
At a half-strength concentration, the carrying capacity was 64. 
The nearly one-to-one correspondence between food level and 
the carrying capacities of these two species provides evidence 
that when grown alone, the carrying capacity was determined 
by intraspecific competition for food. These results set the stage 
for Gause’s experiment to determine whether interspecific com-
petition  for  food,  the  limiting  resource  in  this  system,  would 
lead to the exclusion of one of the competing species.     

 When grown together,  P. aurelia  survived, while the popu-
lation of  P. caudatum  quickly declined. The difference in results 
obtained at the two food concentrations supports the conclusion 
that competitive exclusion results from competition for food. At 
a full-strength food concentration, the decline in the  P. caudatum  
population was approaching exclusion by 16 days but exclusion 
was not complete. In contrast, at a half-strength food concentra-
tion,  P. caudatum  had been entirely eliminated by day 16.  

  Experiments with Flour Beetles 
  Tribolium,   beetles  of  the  family  Tenebrionidae,  infest  stored 
grains  and  grain  products. The  discovery  of  an  infestation  of 
these beetles in an urn of milled grain in the tomb of an Egyptian 
pharaoh buried about 4,500 years ago suggests that these beetles 
have been engaged in this occupation for some time. Their habit 
of attacking stored grains makes them a convenient laboratory 
model.  Since  all  life  stages  of   Tribolium   live  in  finely  milled 
flour,  small  containers  of  flour  provide  all  the  environmental

requirements  to  sustain  a  population.  R.  N.  Chapman  (1928) 
began working with laboratory populations of  Tribolium  at the 
University of Chicago in the 1920s, where ever since, work has 
focused on two species:  T. confusum  and  T. castaneum.  

 Thomas  Park  (1954)  worked  extensively  on  interspecific 
competition  between  these  two  species  under  six  environ-
mental  conditions,  including  hot-wet  (34 8 C,  70%  RH,  relative 
humidity)  and  cool-dry  (24 8 C,  30%  RH).  In  hot-wet  environ-
ments,  both  species  established  healthy  populations  that  per-
sisted over the entire duration of the experiment ( fig. 13.16 a  ). 
However,  when  grown 
these  conditions, 
 T. castaneum  usually excludes  T. confusum  ( fig. 13.16 b  ). In con-
trast, cool-dry conditions favor  T. confusum.  Under intermedi-
ate environmental conditions, each species did well when grown 
alone but the outcome of interspecific competition was not com-
pletely predictable. Under such intermediate conditions, the spe-
cies establishing itself in greater numbers first generally wins out 
in competition, a phenomenon known as the    priority effect    .

 How  can  we  interpret  the  results  of  these  laboratory 
experiments  in  terms  of  the  effects  of  competition  on  these 
species’ niches? Growing the two species separately showed 
that the fundamental niches of both species include a broad 
range  of  environmental  conditions.  However,  growing  the 
two  species  together  suggests  that  interspecific  competition 
restricts the realized niches of both species to fewer environ-
mental conditions. We turn now to consider how competition 
influences the niches of species in nature. 

  Concept 13.3 Review  

1. Paramecium  aurelia   and   P.  caudatum   coexisted  for  a 
long  period  when  fed  full-strength  food  compared  to 
when  they  were  fed  half  that  amount.  What  does  this 
contrast  in  the  time  to  competitive  exclusion  suggest 
about  the  role  of  food  supply  on  competition  between 
these two species?  

2.   Can  we  conclude  that  interspecific  competition  com-
monly  restricts  species  to  realized  niches  in  nature, 
based on the results of mathematical models and labora-
tory experiments?  

3.   Is there any way that predators could alter the outcome 
of  competition  as  shown  in   figure  13.14 a   ,   where  spe-
cies 1 excludes species 2, and in  figure 13.14 b   ,  where 
species 2 excludes species 1?

 13.17  Describe what decades of research indicates about 
competition in nature, not in mathematical or labo-
ratory models.

Competition can have significant ecological and evolution-
ary influences on the niches of species.   Competition can 
have  short-term  ecological  effects  on  the  niches  of  species 
by restricting them to realized niches, yet these species may 
retain their capacity to inhabit the fuller range of environments 
we call the fundamental niche. However, if competitive inter-
actions  are  strong  and  pervasive  enough,  they  may  produce 
an  evolutionary  response  in  the  competitor  population—an 
evolutionary response that changes the fundamental niche. In 
this section, we explore the evidence for both ecological and 
evolutionary influences on the niches of natural populations. 
Field  experiments  show  that  interspecific  competition  may 
restrict the niches of populations in nature.

   Niches and Competition 
Among Plants 
 Arthur Tansley (1917) conducted one of the first experiments 
to test whether competition was responsible for the separation 
of two species of plants on different soil types. In the introduc-
tion to his paper, Tansley pointed out that while the separation 
of  closely  related  plants  had  long  been  attributed  to  mutual 
competitive  exclusion,  it  was  necessary  to  perform  manipu-
lative  experiments  to  demonstrate  that  this  interpretation  is 
correct. That is exactly what Tansley did in pioneering work 
to account for the mutually exclusive distributions of  Galium 
saxatile   and   G.  sylvestre   (now   G.  pumilum ),  two  species  of 
small perennial plants commonly called bedstraw ( fig. 13.17 ). 
In  the  British  Isles,   G.  saxatile   is  largely  confined  to  acidic 
soils and  G. sylvestre  to basic limestone soils. 

       Tansley  conducted  his  experiment  at  the  Cambridge 
Botanical Garden from 1911 to 1917, where seeds of the two 
species  of  plants  were  sown  in  planting  boxes  of  acidic  and 
basic soils. The seeds were sowed in single-species plantings 
and  in  mixtures  of  the  two  species.  Both  species  germinated 
on both soil types, in both single- and mixed-species plantings 
( fig. 13.18 ). Like the paramecia studied by Gause, both  Galium  
species  established  healthy  populations  on  both  soil  types 
when grown by themselves and these single-species plantings 
persisted to the end of the 6-year study. However, as the two 
species grew in mixed plantings, Tansley observed clear com-
petitive dominance by each species on its normal soil type.   

 On  limestone  soils,   G.  sylvestre,   the  species  naturally 
found on limestone soils, overgrew and eliminated  G. saxatile,  
the acidic soil species, by the end of the first growing season. 
On  acidic  soils,  the  relationship  was  reversed  and   G.  saxa-
tile   was  competitively  dominant  but  competitive  exclusion 
was not completed. Growth by both species was so slow on 
the acidic soils that it took until the end of the 6-year experi-
ment for  G. saxatile  to completely cover the planting boxes 
containing acidic soils, a density attained by  G.  sylvestre  on 
limestone soils in just 1 year. However, among the abundant 

Figure 13.17  These two species of bedstraw grow predominately on 
different soil types:  Galium saxatile  (shown here) grows mainly on acidic 
soils, while  G. sylvestre (G. pumilum)  grows mainly on basic limestone soils.

Though G. saxatile is

 G. saxatile  in the mixed plantings, Tansley found a few “quite 
healthy” plants of  G. sylvestre.  

 Tansley was one of the first ecologists to use experiments 
to demonstrate the influence of interspecific competition on 
the niches of species. The fundamental niche of both species 
of   Galium   included  a  wider  variety  of  soil  types  than  they 
inhabit in nature. The results of this experiment suggest that 
interspecific competition restricts the realized niche of each 
species  to  a  narrower  range  of  soil  types.  Similar  patterns 
have been observed in intertidal environments.  

  Niche Overlap and Competition 
between Barnacles 
 Like  salt  marsh  plants,  the  barnacles   Balanus  balanoides   and 
 Chthamalus  stellatus   are  restricted  to  predictable  bands  in  the 
intertidal  zone.  We  saw  in  chapter  9  (see  fig.  9.8)  that  adult 
 Chthamalus   along  the  coast  of  Scotland  are  restricted  to  the 
upper intertidal zone, while adult  Balanus  are concentrated in the 
middle and lower intertidal zones. Joseph Connell’s observations 
(1961a,  1961b)  indicate  that   Balanus   is  limited  to  the  middle 
and lower intertidal zones because it cannot withstand the lon-
ger exposure to air in the upper intertidal zone. However, physi-
cal factors only partially explain the distribution of   Chthamalus.  
Connell noted that larval  Chthamalus  readily settle in the inter-
tidal zone below where the species persists as adults but that these 
colonists die out within a relatively short period. In the course of 
field experiments, Connell discovered that interspecific competi-
tion with  Balanus  plays a key role in determining the lower limit 
of  Chthamalus  within the intertidal zone. 

 Because barnacles are sessile, small, and grow in high den-
sities, they are ideal for field studies of survivorship. Their expo-
sure at low tide is an additional convenience for the researcher. 
Connell  established  several  study  sites  from  the  upper  to  the 

Middle intertidal zone

lower intertidal zones where he kept track of barnacle popula-
tions by periodically mapping the locations of every individual 
barnacle  on  glass  plates.  He  established  his  study  areas  and 
made his initial maps in March and April of 1954, before the 
main settlement by  Balanus  in late April. He divided each of the 
study areas in half and kept one of the halves free of  Balanus  by 
scraping them off with a knife. Connell determined which half 
of each study site to keep   Balanus -free by flipping a coin. 

 By periodically remapping the study sites, Connell was able 
to monitor interactions between the two species and the fates of 
individual barnacles. The results showed that in the middle inter-
tidal zone,  Chthamalas  survived at higher rates in the absence of 
 Balanus  ( fig. 13.19 ).  Balanus  settled in densities up to 49 indi-
viduals per square centimeter in the middle intertidal zone and 
grew quickly, crowding out  Chthamalus  in the process. In the 
upper intertidal zone, removing  Balanus  had no effect on  Chtha-
malus  survivorship because the population density of  Balanus  
was  too  low  to  compete  seriously.  Connell’s  results  provided 
direct  evidence  that   Chthamalus   is  excluded  from  the  middle 
intertidal zone by interspecific competition with  Balanus.      

 How  does  interspecific  competition  affect  the  niche  of 
 Chthamalus?   In  the  absence  of   Balanus,   it  can  live  over  a 
broad zone from the upper to the middle intertidal zones. Using 
the terminology of Hutchinson (1957), we can call this broad 
range of physical conditions the  fundamental   niche  of  Chtha-
malus.   However,  competition  largely  restricts    Chthamalus   to 
the upper intertidal zone, a more restricted range of physical 
conditions constituting the species’  realized   niche  ( fig. 13.20 ).   
 Does  variation  in  interspecific  competition  completely 
explain  the  patterns  seen  by  Connell? At  the  lowest  levels  in 
the  lower  intertidal  zone,   Chthamalus   suffered  high  mortal-
ity even in the absence of  Balanus  (see  fig. 13.19 ). What other 
factors might contribute to high rates of mortality by  Chthama-
lus  in the lower intertidal zone? Experiments have shown that 
this  species  can  withstand  periods  of  submergence  of  nearly

It turns out that the presence of predators in the lower intertidal 
zone introduces complications that we will discuss in  chapter 14

when we examine the influences of predators on prey popula-
tions. Intertidal plants are also subject to competition.  

  Competition and the Habitat 
of a Salt Marsh Grass 
 How do you think competition might affect populations of the 
salt marsh grass  Spartina anglica,  whose niche we discussed 
earlier in chapter 13? Field experiments have demonstrated that 
 S. anglica,  like  Chthamalus,  is restricted to its typical intertidal 
zone partly by interspecific competition with other salt marsh 
plants. In contrast to  Chthamalus,  however,  S. anglica  receives 
competitive  pressure  from  the  landward  side  of  its  intertidal 
distribution (Scholten and Rozema 1990; Scholten et al. 1987). 
 Does  this  reversal  in  the  direction  of  competitive  pres-
sure make sense? It should, since in the case of barnacles we 
have marine organisms for which greater physical challenge 
occurs as they inhabit areas higher in the intertidal zone. In 
the case of the salt marsh plants, we are dealing with organ-
isms  descended  from  terrestrial  ancestors  that  are  met  with 
increasing  physical  challenge  as  they  inhabit  areas  lower  in 
the intertidal zone. Similar experiments have been conducted 
on competition among desert rodents.  

  Competition and the Niches 
of Small Rodents 
 One  of  the  most  ambitious  and  complete  of  the  many  field 
experiments ecologists have conducted on competition among 
rodents  focused  on  desert  rodents  in  the  Chihuahuan  Desert 
near Portal, Arizona. This experiment, conducted by James H. 
Brown and his students and colleagues (Munger and Brown 
1981; Brown and Munger 1985), is exceptional in many ways. 
First, it was conducted at a large scale; the 20 ha study site 
includes 24 study plots, each 50 m by 50 m ( fig. 13.21 ). Sec-
ond,  the  experimental  trials  have  been  well  replicated,  both 
in space and in time. Third, the project has been long term; 
it  began  in  1977  and  is  ongoing. These  three  characteristics 
combine  to  demonstrate  subtle  ecological  relationships  and 
phenomena that would not otherwise be apparent.   

 The rodent species living on the Chihuahuan Desert study 
site can be divided into groups based upon size and feeding hab-
its.  Most  species  are     granivores    ,   rodents  that  feed  chiefly  on 
seeds. The large granivores consist of three species of kangaroo 
rats ( fig. 13.22 a  ) in the genus  Dipodomys—D. spectabilis,  120 g; 
 D.  ordi,   52  g;  and   D.  merriami,   45  g.  In  addition,  the  study 
site is home to four species of small granivores ( fig. 13.22 b  )— 
 Perognathus penicillatus,  17 g;  P. flavus,  7 g;  Peromyscus manic-
ulatus,  24 g;  Reithrodontomys megalotis,  11 g—and two species 
of small insectivorous rodents—  Onychomys leucogaster,  39 g, 
and  O. torridus,  29 g.     

 In  one  experiment,  Brown  and  his  colleagues  set  out  to 
determine whether large granivorous rodents ( Dipodomys  spp.) 
limit the abundance of small rodents on their Chihuahuan Desert 
study site. They also wanted to know whether the rodents might 
be competing for food. The researchers addressed their ques-
tions with a field experiment in which they enclosed 50 m by 

 Figure 13.21    Aerial photo showing the placement of 24 study 
plots, each 50 m by 50 m, in the Chihuahuan Desert near Portal, 
 Arizona (courtesy of J. H. Brown). 

50  m  study  plots  with  mouse-proof  fences. The  fences  were 
constructed with a wire mesh with 0.64 cm openings, which 
were too small for any of the rodent species to crawl through. 
They also buried the fencing 0.2 m deep so the mice couldn’t 
dig under it, and they topped the fences with aluminum flash-
ing so the mice couldn’t climb over it. This may sound like a 
lot of work, but to answer their questions, the researchers had 
to control the presence of rodents on the study plots. 

 The researchers next cut holes 6.5 cm in diameter in the 
sides of all the fences to allow all rodent species to move freely 
in and out of the study plots. With this arrangement in place, 
the  rodents  in  the  study  plots  were  trapped  live  and  marked 
once a month for 3 months. Following this initial monitoring 
period, the holes on four of eight study plots were reduced to 
1.9 cm, small enough to exclude  Dipodomys  but large enough 
to allow free movement of small rodents. Brown and his col-
leagues refer to these fences with small holes as semipermeable 
membranes, since they allow the movement of small rodents 
but exclude  Dipodomys,  the large granivores in this system. 

 If   Dipodomys   competes  with  small  rodents,  how  would 
you  expect  populations  of  small  rodents  to  respond  to  its 
removal? The researchers predicted that if competition among 
rodents is mainly for food, then small granivorous rodent pop-
ulations  would  increase  in  response  to   Dipodomys   removal, 
while insectivorous rodents would show little or no response. 

 The  results  of  the  experiment  were  consistent  with  the 
predictions. During the first 3 years of the experiment, small

Chihuahuan Desert: ( a ) the kangaroo rat,  Dipodomys  spp., a large 
 granivore; ( b ) a pocket mouse,  Perognathus  sp., a small granivore.

granivores  were  approximately  3.5  times  more  abundant  on 
the  Dipodomys  removal plots compared to the control plots, 
while  populations  of  small  insectivorous  rodents  did  not 
increase significantly ( fig. 13.23 ).     

 The results presented in  figure 13.23  support the hypoth-
esis that  Dipodomys  spp. competitively suppress populations 
of small granivores. But would they do so again in response 
to  another  experimental  manipulation? We  cannot  be  certain 
unless  we  repeat  the  experiment.  That’s  just  what  Edward 
Heske,  James  H.  Brown,  and  Shahroukh  Mistry  (1994)  did. 
In 1988, they selected eight other fenced study plots that they 
had been monitoring since 1977, installed their semipermeable 
barriers  on  four  of  the  plots,  and  removed   Dipodomys   from 
them. The result was an almost immediate increase in small 
granivore populations on the removal plots ( fig. 13.24 ). Brown 
and  his  students  and  colleagues  have  continued  to  monitor 
these study plots for more than 30 years. During this period, 
they have made discoveries about interactions among rodent 
species,  the  influences  of  a  changing  climate  on  the  veg-
etative  community,  and  the  great  impact  of  infrequent,  cata-
strophic  climatic  events  on  rodent  populations—discoveries 
that would have been impossible in a short-term field study. 
For  instance,  Katherine  H.  Thibault  and  James  H.  Brown 

(2008) report how a single, 2-hour storm “reset” the relative 
abundances of large and small granivores on their study plots 
and  how  the  altered  abundances  had  continued  through  the 
8 years prior to their publication. Undoubtedly, such discover-
ies will continue as long as monitoring of this landmark study 
is sustained. As we see next, long-term competition between 
two species can lead to evolutionary divergence in morphology.      

  Character Displacement 
 Because interspecific competition reduces the fitness of com-
peting individuals, those individuals that compete less should 
have higher fitness than individuals that compete more. Conse-
quently, interspecific competition has been predicted to lead to 
   character displacement   —the circumstance in which two spe-
cies differ more from each other in geographic areas where they 
occur together than where their distributions do not overlap. 

 Darwin’s finches  Geospiza fortis,  the medium ground finch, 
and   G.  fuliginosa,   the  small  ground  finch,  provide  one  of  the 
most convincing cases of character displacement. These two spe-
cies occur apart from each other, that is, they are     allopatric    ,  on 
Daphne  Major  and  Los  Hermanos  islands  and  occur  together, 
that  is,  they  are     sympatric    ,   on  the  island  of  Santa  Cruz  ( see 
fig.  13.25,  p.  298 ). Where  the  two  species  are  allopatric,  they 
have very similar beak sizes. However, where they are sympatric, 
the sizes of their beaks do not overlap. The allopatric  G.  fortis  
on Daphne Major have smaller beaks than those sympatric with 
 G.  fuliginosa   on  Santa  Cruz,  while  the   G.  fuliginosa   on  Los 
 Hermanos  Island  have  beaks  that  are  significantly  larger  than 
those sympatric with  G. fortis  on Santa Cruz. Since beak size cor-
relates with diet in Darwin’s finches, we can say that the sympat-
ric populations of the two species on Santa Cruz have different 
feeding  niches.  Natural  selection  has  apparently  favored  diver-
gence  in  the  beak  morphology  of  these  sympatric  populations 
(Lack 1947; Schluter, Price, and Grant 1985; and Grant 1986).     

 Other studies have demonstrated similar patterns of char-
acter displacement among a variety of animal species, includ-
ing   Cnemidophorus   lizards  on  islands  off  Baja  California, 
 Anolis  lizards on Caribbean islands, and sticklebacks inhabit-
ing small lakes around Vancouver Island, Canada. Character 
displacement has also been observed in laboratory populations 
of bean weevils. Many studies have provided preliminary data 
suggesting character displacement among populations but not 
establishing definitive evidence. Why is that? The main rea-
son is that a definitive demonstration requires a great deal of 
evidence that is difficult to provide. 

 Mark Taper and Ted Case (1992) list six criteria that must 

be met to build a definitive case for character displacement: 

    1.  Morphological differences between a pair of sympatric spe-
cies (e.g.,  G. fortis  and  G. fuliginosa  on Santa Cruz Island) 
are statistically greater than the differences between allo-
patric populations of the same species ( G. fortis  on Daphne 
Major and  G. fuliginosa  on Los Hermanos Island).  

    2.  The observed differences between sympatric and allopat-

ric populations have a genetic basis.  

    3.  Differences  between  sympatric  and  allopatric  popula-
tions  must  have  evolved  in  place  and  they  must  not  be

due  to  the  sympatric  and  allopatric  populations  having 
been derived from different founder populations already 
differing in the character under study (e.g., beak size).  

    4.  Variation  in  the  character  (e.g.,  beak  size)  must  have  a 

known effect on use of resources (e.g., seed sizes).  

    5.  There must be demonstrated competition for the resource 
under  question  (e.g.,  food)  and  competition  must  be 
directly  correlated  with  similarity  in  the  character 
(e.g., overlap in beak size).  

    6.  Differences in the character cannot be explained by dif-
ferences in the resources available to sympatric and allo-
patric populations (e.g., differences in the availability of 
seeds on one island versus another).    

 You  can  see  how  difficult  it  would  be  to  satisfy  all  six 
of these criteria. It is fitting that one of the few studies that 
addresses all six criteria reasonably well is that of Darwin’s 
finches (Grant 1986; Taper and Case 1992), in the place where 
Darwin started the whole discussion. Since these studies, there 
have  been  an  increasing  number  of  convincing  demonstra-
tions of character displacement (Dayan and Simberloff 2005).    

      Evidence for Competition in Nature 
 What  have  we  learned  since  Darwin  initiated  our  enduring 
discussion of the role of competition as an organizing force 
in  nature?  The  study  of  competition  has  gone  through  sev-
eral  phases.  There  was  an  early  theoretical  phase,  followed 
by work with laboratory models, which was in turn followed 
by  intensive  observation  and  experimentation  in  the  field. 

These phases were followed by a period of vigorous question-
ing of the assumption that competition is an important force 
in nature. One of the significant research developments dur-
ing this period was the testing of supposed cases of charac-
ter displacement against randomly assembled sets of species 
and the application of proper statistical analysis of patterns of 
morphological variation across communities (e.g., Simberloff 
and Boeklin 1981; Strong, Szyska, and Simberloff 1981). This 
questioning forced renewed attention to careful experimental 
design and stimulated a reanalysis of past research in order to 
weigh the existing evidence bearing on competition in nature. 
 Two of the first analyses were those of Thomas Schoener 
(1983)  and  Joseph  Connell  (1983),  both  of  whom  reviewed 
the  evidence  provided  by  field  experiments.  Schoener,  who 
reviewed  over  150  field  experiments  on  interspecific  com-
petition, reported that competition was found in 90% of the 
studies and among 76% of the species. Connell, who reviewed 
527 experiments on 215 species, found evidence of interspecific 
competition in about 40% of the experiments and about 50% 
of the species. Why is there such a difference in these results? 
One reason is that the researchers analyzed different groups of 
studies and used different criteria for including studies in their 
analyses. Connell only accepted effects on population density, 
or  closely  related  effects,  as  evidence  of  competition,  while 
Schoener accepted any negative effects, for example, effects 
on individual growth rate (Schoener 1985). Despite these dif-
ferences, the analyses indicate that competition is an impor-
tant force in the lives of many species. However, we may still 
have  a  biased  estimate  of  the  frequency  of  competition  in

Investigating the Evidence  13

 Field Experiments 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 13.18  Describe the difference between a typical laboratory 

experiment and a field experiment.

 13.19  Explain the importance of the several elements of a 

sound field experiment.

 Field experiments have played a key role in the assessment of 
the  importance  of  competitive  interactions  in  nature.  Joseph 
Connell (1974) and Nelson Hairston, Sr. (1989), two of the pio-
neers in the use of field experiments in ecology, outlined their 
proper design and execution. Connell points out that one of the 
most substantial differences between laboratory and field exper-
iments is that in the laboratory setting, the investigator controls 
all important factors but one, the factor of interest. In contrast, in 
field experiments, all factors are allowed to vary naturally (the 
investigator generally has no choice) while the factor of interest 
is controlled, or manipulated, by the investigator. 

 Both  laboratory  and  field  experiments  have  played  an 
important role in ecology, but it is the field experiment that pro-
vides the key to unlock the secrets of complex interactions in 
nature. Why is it that field experiments are more useful in this 
regard? Connell pointed out that compared to laboratory exper-
iments,  the  results  of  field  experiments  can  be  more  directly 
applied to understanding relationships in nature because “inter-
actions with other organisms, and the natural variation in the 
abiotic environment, are included in the experiment.” The best 
field experiments are those that are executed with the least dis-
turbance to the natural community. The utility of field experi-
ments, however, depends upon several design features. 

  Knowledge of Initial Conditions 
 To  test  for  change  in  response  to  experimental  manipula-
tion, you have to know what conditions were like before the 
manipulation.  Departures  from  initial  conditions  indicate  a 
response  to  the  experimental  treatments.  For  instance,  in  his 
experiments on competition between barnacles, Connell first 
estimated the initial population density of one of the species 
in all his study plots (see  fig. 13.19 ). Brown and his colleagues 
(Brown and Munger 1985; Heske, Brown, and Mistry 1994) 
were  also  careful  to  measure  the  population  densities  of  all 
rodent species in their study plots several times before exclud-
ing large granivorous rodents from their experimental plots.  

  Controls 
 As in laboratory experiments, field experiments must include 
controls. Without controls it would be impossible to determine 

whether  or  not  an  experimental  treatment  has  had  an  effect. 
Tansley (1917) created controls for his experiments on com-
petition by growing each of his potential competitors by them-
selves in acidic and basic soils. What was the control for the 
experiment  on  competition  among  desert  rodents?  Brown’s 
research team created controls by surrounding study plots with 
their mouse-proof fence but then cutting holes 6.5 cm in diam-
eter in the fences to allow large granivorous rodents to move 
freely into and out of the plots.  

  Replication 
 Field  experiments,  where  possible,  should  include  replica-
tion. Why? Ecological systems and environmental conditions 
are variable, both in time and space. Replication is intended 
to  capture  this  variation.  The  question  posed  by  the  experi-
menter is whether an experimental effect is apparent  despite  
variation.  Ecologists  use  statistics  to  make  such  a  judgment. 
Without replication, you would never know if the results could 
be repeated either in time or space. 

 What is considered acceptable study design has changed 
over  the  decades,  reflecting  increasing  familiarity  and  con-
cern for statistical analysis. In Tansley’s experiments on how 
competition  may  restrict  the  distribution  of   Galium   species 
to  particular  soils,  replication  was  totally  lacking.  In  Tans-
ley’s experiment, each condition (soil type) was represented 
just  one  time.  Connell’s  later  experiments  with  barnacles 
included some replication, but it was still limited at each tidal 
level.  However,  since  there  was  a  great  deal  of  consistency 
in  response  across  tidal  levels,  we  can  accept  that  competi-
tion acts as a significant force limiting barnacle distributions 
within the intertidal zone. In contrast to these earlier experi-
ments, the more recent experiments by Brown on competition 
among desert rodents were replicated sufficiently for statisti-
cal analysis and repeated a second time. 

 The reviews by Connell and Hairston provide a guide to 
field experimentation as it has been conducted in the past few 
decades. However, as we shall see in section VI, the need for 
experimentation at large scales is forcing ecologists to further 
expand their concept of experimental design. 

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  13  
    1.  Why did Brown’s research team (see p. 295) create con-
trols by completely fencing study plots and then cutting 
holes in their sides to allow free passage of rodents into 
and out of the plot? Why not just compare the density of 
small  rodents  in  the  large  granivore  removal  plots  with 
their densities in the surrounding desert?

nature, since ecologists may focus their studies of competition 
on species that they expect are competing. 

 After decades of criticism, reflection, and reanalysis, what 
can we say about the prevalence and importance of interspecific 
competition in nature? The  evidence supports the conclusion that 
competition is a common and important force that contributes to 
the organization of nature. However, the evidence also indicates 
that  the  importance  of  competition  varies  a  great  deal  among 
organisms  and  environments.  What  other  forces  besides  com-
petition may be responsible for the patterns of distribution and 
abundance that we observe in natural populations? We’ve already 
reviewed the influences of the physical environment (sections I, 
II,  and  III).  In  chapters  14  and  15  we  will  consider  two  other 
forms of biotic interaction: predation, herbivory, pariasitism, and 
disease in chapter 14 and mutualism in chapter 15. But first, let’s 
review how field experiments have been used to study competi-
tion between a native and an invasive marine snail.

but  lack  of  response  by  populations  of  insectivorous 
rodents suggest about the nature of competition between 
rodents in Brown’s Arizona study area (see  fig. 13.23 )?  
3.   Why  did  Brown  and  colleagues  repeat  their  large

  Applications 

 Competition between Native 

and Invasive Species    

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 13.20  Describe the field experiments used to study compe-
tition between Batillaria attramentaria, an invasive 
marine snail, and Cerithidea californica, a snail 
native to coastal California and Baja California.

 13.21  Explain the key difference in the biology of Batil-
laria and Cerithidea that indicates the mechanism 
underlying Batillaria’s competitive superiority.

 Some of the most significant contemporary environmental prob-
lems involve invasive species (see chapter 3, pp. 71–72). Because 
of  the  ecological  disruption  caused  by  invasive  species,  it  is 
important to understand the mechanisms allowing them to invade 
communities  of  native  species.  Such  studies  can  also  help  us 
improve our understanding of ecological relationships generally. 
 One  of  the  principal  mechanisms  thought  to  allow  intro-
duced species to invade communities of native species is superior 

competitive ability. James Byers (2000) used field experiments 
to explore the ecological relationships of native and an invasive 
species of mud snail on the Pacific Coast of North America. The 
native mud snail,  Cerithidea californica,  occurs from San Igna-
cio  Bay,  Mexico,  to  Tomales  Bay,  California.  Once  abundant 
throughout this range,  Cerithidea  has declined in abundance in 
some bays, while an invasive mud snail,  Batillaria attramentaria,
has increased in abundance. In places along the California coast 
where  Batillaria  has reached very high densities, for example up 
to 10,000 individuals per m 2  in Elkhorn Slough,  Cerithidea  has 
disappeared  entirely.   Batillaria   was  introduced  accidentally  to 
the California coast with the purposeful introduction of Japanese 
oysters early in the twentieth century. Because it does not have a 
planktonic larval stage,  Batillaria  has remained largely restricted 
to the bays where it was introduced. 

 Byers conducted his field studies of  Cerithidea  and  Batil-
laria  in one of the bays where they co-occur: Bolinas Lagoon, 
approximately 20 km north of San Francisco, California. In the 
first phase of his study, Byers determined the influence of  Ceri-
thidea  and  Batillaria  on their main food supply, benthic diatoms. 
He placed each of the snails in single-species groups in 35 cm 
diameter cages, imbedded in the sediments along a tidal channel 
within Bolinas Lagoon. The densities of  Cerithidea  and  Batil-
laria  in these cages were 0, 12, 23, 35, 46, 69, and 92 individuals. 
Byers set up several replicates of each of these snail densities. 

 When Byers compared the influences of  Cerithidea  and 
 Batillaria  on diatoms, he found no difference in their effect 
on diatom densities.  Figure 13.26  shows the average density 
of  diatoms  after  approximately  39  days  in  cages  containing 
a  low  density  (12  per  cage)  versus  a  higher  density  (92  per 
cage)  of  large  snails.  These  results  indicate  that  both  snail

species  reduce  diatom  cover  when  they  are  present  at  high 
population densities and that both  Cerithidea  and  Batillaria  
have the potential to reduce the availability of their food sup-
ply. This part of Byers’s experiment documents a potential for 
resource competition between the two species.     

 Having  shown  the  influence  of  the  snails  on  their  food 
supply,  Byers  next  explored  the  effects  of  snail  density  on 
their  growth  rates.  He  found  that  the  growth  rates  of  both 
 Cerithidea   and   Batillaria   decline  as  their  population  densi-
ties increase. However, at all population densities  Batillaria  
grows  faster  than   Cerithidea.   The  relative  growth  rates  of 
large individuals of these two species at densities of 12 and 
46  individuals  per  cage  are  shown  in   figure  13.27 .  These 
results indicate that  Batillaria  is much more efficient at con-
verting available food into its own biomass. At high densities 
of  92  per  cage,   Batillaria   continued  to  grow  at  a  relatively 
high rate, while  Cerithidea  lost weight.   

 Byers  used  field  experiments  to  show  the  potential  for 
competition between native and an invasive species. His work 
also  identified  the  mechanism  involved,  resource  competi-
tion.  In  subsequent  research,  Byers  and  Goldwasser  (2001) 
used the data generated by these experiments to build a com-

on  competitive  interactions  between  native  and  invasive 
species  has  the  potential  to  generate  information  that  will 
 predict the potential pathways of interaction between species 
and the time to competitive exclusion.     

 Competition,  interactions  between  individuals  that  reduce 
their fitness, is generally divided into  intraspecific competi-
tion,   competition  between  individuals  of  the  same  species, 
and   interspecific  competition,   competition  between  indi-
viduals  of  different  species.  Competition  can  take  the  form 
of  interference  competition,  involving  direct  interactions 
between  individuals  or  resource  competition  in  which  indi-
viduals compete through their dependence on the same limit-
ing resources. 

  Laboratory and field studies reveal intraspecific com-
petition.   Experiments  with  herbaceous  plants  show  that 
soil  nutrients  may  limit  plant  growth  and  that  competition 
for  nutrients  increases  with  plant  population  density.  Plants 
reflect their competition for resources, including water, light, 
and nutrients, through the process of self-thinning. Competi-
tion  among  leafhoppers  also  varies  with  population  density 
and  is  reflected  in  reduced  survivorship,  smaller  size,  and 
increased developmental time at higher population densities. 
Experiments  with  terrestrial  isopods  show  that  even  where 
there  is  no  food  shortage,  intraspecific  competition  through 
interference may be substantial. 

  The competitive exclusion principle proposes that two 
species  with  identical  niches  cannot  coexist  indefinitely, 
which leads to the prediction that coexisting species will 

have  different  niches.   The  niche  concept  was  developed 
early in the history of ecology and has had a prominent place 
in the study of interspecific competition because of the com-
petitive exclusion principle: two species with identical niches 
cannot coexist indefinitely. While a species’ niche is theoret-
ically  defined  by  a  very  large  number  of  biotic  and  abiotic 
factors,  Hutchinson’s   n -dimensional  hypervolume,  the  most 
important  attributes  of  the  niche  of  most  species,  can  often 
be  summarized  by  a  few  variables.  For  instance,  the  niches 
of  Darwin’s  finches  are  largely  determined  by  their  feeding 
requirements,  while  the  niche  of  a  salt  marsh  grass  can  be 
defined by tidal levels. 

  Mathematical and laboratory models provide a theo-
retical  foundation  for  studying  interspecific  competition 
in nature.  Lotka and Volterra independently  expanded the 
logistic  model  of  population  growth  to  represent  interspe-
cific  competition.  In  the  Lotka-Volterra  competition  model, 
the growth rate of a species depends both upon numbers of 
conspecifics  and  numbers  of  the  competing  species.  In  this 
model, the effect of one species on another is summarized by 
competition coefficients. In general, the Lotka-Volterra com-
petition model predicts coexistence of species when interspe-
cific competition is less intense than intraspecific competition. 
Competitive exclusion in laboratory experiments suggests the 

302

potential for competitive exclusion in nature. Even in the lab-
oratory, however, organisms yield results that are much less 
predictable than the predictions of the Lotka-Volterra compe-
tition equations. 

  Competition can have significant ecological and evolu-
tionary  influences  on  the  niches  of  species.   Field  experi-
ments  involving  organisms  from  herbaceous  plants  to  desert 
rodents  have  demonstrated  that  competition  can  restrict  the 
niches of species to a narrower set of conditions than they would 

otherwise occupy in the absence of competition.  Theoretically, 
natural selection may lead to divergence in the morphology of 
competing  species,  a  situation  called  character  displacement. 
After many decades of theoretical and experimental work on 
competition,  we  can  conclude  that  competition  is  a  common 
and  strong  force  operating  in  nature,  but  not  always  and  not 
everywhere.  Experimental  studies  of  competition  between 
native and invasive species have the potential to improve our 
general understanding of interspecific competition.

  Review Questions 

     1.  Design a greenhouse (glasshouse) experiment to test for intra-
specific competition within a population of herbaceous plants. 
Specify  the  species  of  plant,  the  volume  (or  size  of  pot)  and 
source of soil, the potentially limiting resource you will focus 
on  (e.g.,  Tilman  and  Cowan  [1989]  studied  competition  for 
nitrogen) and how you will manipulate it, and the measures of 
plant performance you will make.  

    2.  How can the results of greenhouse experiments on competition 
help us understand the importance of competition among natu-
ral populations? How can a researcher enhance the correspon-
dence of results between greenhouse experiments and the field 
situation?  

    3.  Explain how self-thinning in field populations of plants can be 
used to support the hypothesis that intraspecific competition is a 
common occurrence among natural plant populations.  

    4.  Researchers have characterized the niches of Darwin’s finches 
by beak size (which correlates with diet) and the niches of salt 
marsh  grasses  by  position  in  the  intertidal  zone.  How  would 
you characterize the niches of sympatric canid species such as 
red fox, coyote, and wolf in North America? Or felids, such as 
ocelots, pumas, and jaguars in South America? What character-
istics or environmental features do you think would be useful 
for  representing  the  niches  of  desert  plants?  Or  the  plants  in 
temperate forest or prairie?  

    5.  Explain why species that overlap a great deal in their fundamen-
tal niches have a high probability of competing. Now explain 
why species that overlap a great deal in their realized niches and 
live in the same area probably do not compete significantly.  

    6.  Draw the four possible ways in which Lotka’s (1932a) isoclines 
of zero population growth (see  fig. 13.14 ) can be oriented with 

respect to each other. Label the axes and the points where the 
isoclines intersect the horizontal and vertical axes. Explain how 
each situation represented by the graphs leads to either compet-
itive exclusion of one species or the other or stable or unstable 
coexistence.  

    7.  How was the amount of food that Gause (1934) provided in his 
experiment on competition among paramecia related to carry-
ing capacity? In Gause’s experiments on competition,  P. aurelia  
excluded  P. caudatum  faster when he provided half the amount 
of food than when he doubled the amount of food. Explain.  

    8.  In  his  experiments  on  competition  between   T.  confusum   and 
 T.  castaneum,   Park  (1954)  found  that  one  species  usually 
excluded the other species but that the outcome depended upon 
physical  conditions.  In  which  circumstances  did   T.  confusum  
have  the  competitive  advantage?  In  which  circumstances  did 
 T.  castaneum   have  the  competitive  advantage?  Could  Park 
predict the outcomes of these experiments with complete cer-
tainty? What does this suggest about competition in nature?  

    9.  Discuss how mathematical theory, laboratory models, and field 
experiments have contributed to our understanding of the ecol-
ogy  of  competition.  List  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of 
each approach.  

   10.  One of the conclusions that seems justified in light of several 
decades of studies of interspecific competition is that compe-
tition  is  a  common  and  strong  force  operating  in  nature,  but 
not  always  and  not  everywhere.  List  the  environmental  cir-
cumstances  in  which  you  think  intraspecific  and  interspecific 
competition would be most likely to occur in nature. In what 
circumstances do you think competition is least likely to occur? 
How would you go about testing your ideas?

Interactions

 Figure 14.1   This moose exploits the twigs and buds of woody 
plants for the food it needs to survive the cold northern winter.  Eventually, 
wolves may prey upon the moose to meet their needs for food.

moose reduces the mass of the small tree and adds to the grow-
ing energy store in its own large and complex stomach, energy 
stores that the moose will need to make it through one more 
northern  winter.  Then,  a  familiar  scent  catches  the  moose’s 
attention and, startled, it runs off.     

 Suddenly, the clearing where the moose had been feed-
ing  is  a  blur  of  bounding  forms  dashing  headlong  in  the 
direction the moose has gone—a pack of wolves in pursuit 
of its own meal. A portion of the pack has already run ahead 
of the moose and is cutting off its retreat. This time, unlike 
so many times before, the old moose will not escape. After 
a fierce struggle, the moose is down and the wolves settle 
in to feed. 

 But the wolves are not the only organisms to benefit from 
this great quantity of food. Within the intestines of the wolves 
live  several  species  of  parasitic  worms  that  will  soon  claim 
their  share  of  the  wolves’  hard-won  feast.  The  worms  will 
turn some of the energy and structural compounds they absorb 
into the infective stages of their own kind, which after being 
shed  into  the  environment  may  attach  themselves  to  other 
hosts, who will serve as their unwitting providers. 

 Some of the strongest links between populations are those 
between herbivore and plant, between predator and prey, and 
between parasite or pathogen and host. The conceptual thread 
that  links  these  diverse  interactions  between  species  is  that 
the  interaction  enhances  the  fitness  of  one  individual—the 
predator,  the  pathogen,  etc.—while  reducing  the  fitness  of 
the exploited individual—the prey, host, etc. Because of this 
common  thread  we  can  group  these  interactions  under  the 
heading of  exploitative interactions.  

 Let’s consider some of the most common forms of exploita-
tion. Herbivores consume live plant material but do not  usually 
kill plants.    Predators    kill and consume other organisms. Typi-
cal predators are animals that feed on other animals—wolves 
that eat moose, snakes that eat mice, etc.    Parasites    live on the 
tissues of their host, often reducing the fitness of the host, but 
not generally killing it. A    parasitoid    is an insect whose larva 
consumes  its  host  and  kills  it  in  the  process;  parasitoids  are 

functionally  equivalent  to  predators.     Pathogens     induce  dis-
ease, a debilitating condition, in their hosts. 

 As  clear  as  all  these  definitions  may  seem,  they  are 
fraught  with  semantic  problems.  Once  again,  we  are  faced 
with capturing the full richness of nature with a few restrictive 
definitions. For instance, not all predators are animals, a few 
are plants, some are fungi, and many are protozoans. When an 
herbivore kills the plant upon which it feeds, should we call it 
a predator? If an herbivore does not kill its food plants, would 
it be better to call it a parasite? What do we do with a parasite 
that  kills  its  host?  Is  it  then  a  predator  or  perhaps  a  patho-
gen?  The  point  of  these  questions  is  not  to  argue  for  more 
terminology but to argue for fewer, less restrictive terms. As 
is often the case, we are faced with a continuum of interesting 
and sometimes bewildering interactions involving millions of 
organisms. Let’s recognize the diversity and continuous varia-
tion facing the ecologist, put the restrictive definitions aside 
for the moment, and recognize what is common to all these 
interactions:    exploitation,    that is, one organism makes its liv-
ing at the expense of another.

 14.4  Describe examples of how parasites and pathogens 

alter host behavior.

 14.5  Explain how the parasite Adelina tribolii changes

   Exploitative interactions weave populations into a web of 
relationships  that  defy  easy  generalization.   By  conser-
vative  estimate  the  number  of  species  in  the  biosphere  is  on 
the  order  of  10  million. As  huge  as  this  number  may  seem, 
the number of exploitative interactions between species is far 
greater. Why is that? Because every one of those 10 million 
species  is  food  for  a  number  of  other  species  and  is  host  to 
a  variety  of  parasites  and  pathogens.  In  addition,  most  feed 
on other species. Exploitative interactions weave species into 
a  tangled  web  of  relationships.  For  instance,  K.  E.  Havens 
(1994)  estimated  that  the  approximately  500  known  species 
occupying  Lake  Okeechobee,  Florida,  are  linked  by  about 
25,000 exploitative interactions—50 times the number of spe-
cies! Exploitation provides much of the detail in the tapestry 
we call nature. In this section, we try to capture some of the 
richness of that tapestry by discussing the natural history of a 
number of interactions.  

   Parasites and Pathogens that 
Manipulate Host Behavior 
 The most obvious form of exploitation is when one organism 
consumes  part  or  all  of  another.  Exploitation,  however,  can

305

assume far more subtle forms. Some species alter the behav-
ior of the species they exploit. 

  Parasites that Alter the Behavior 
of Their Hosts 
 A number of parasites alter the behavior of their hosts in ways 
that  benefit  transmission  and  reproduction  of  the  parasite. 
Acanthocephalans, or spiny-headed worms, change the behav-
ior of amphipods, small aquatic crustaceans, in ways that make 
it more likely that infected amphipods will be eaten by a suit-
able vertebrate host, especially ducks, beavers, and muskrats. 
Uninfected amphipods avoid the light—that is, show    negative 
phototaxis.    They spend most of their time near the bottoms of 
ponds and lakes, away from well-lighted surface waters, where 
the surface-feeding vertebrate hosts of acanthocephalans spend 
the  majority  of  their  time.  In  contrast,  infected  amphipods 
swim toward light—that is, show    positive phototaxis,    a behav-
ior that places them near the pond surface in the path of feeding 
ducks, beavers, and muskrats (Bethel and Holmes 1977). Inter-
estingly, amphipod behavior remains unaltered until the acan-
thocephalan has reached a life stage, called a  cystacanth,  that 
is capable of infecting the vertebrate host. If eaten earlier, the 
acanthocephalan would die without completing its life cycle. 
 Janice Moore (1983, 1984a, and 1984b) studied a simi-
lar  parasite-host  interaction  involving  an  acanthocephalan, 
 Plagiorhynchus cylindraceus,  a terrestrial isopod or pill bug, 
 Armadillidium  vulgare,   and  the  European  starling,   Stur-
nus  vulgaris.   In  this  interaction,  the  pill  bug  serves  as  an 

intermediate  host  for   Plagiorhynchus,   which  completes  its 
life cycle in the starling ( fig. 14.2 ).     

 At the outset of her research, Moore predicted that  Pla-
giorhynchus  would alter the behavior of  Armadillidium.  She 
based  this  prediction  on  several  observations.  One  was  the 
relative frequency of infection of  Armadillidium  and starlings 
by  Plagiorhynchus.  Field studies had demonstrated that even 
where  Plagiorhynchus  infects only 1% of the  Armadillidium  
population, over 40% of the starlings in the area were infected. 
Some factor was enhancing rates of transmission to the star-
lings, and Moore predicted that it was altered host behavior. 
Moore thought that the size of  Plagiorhynchus  might also be 
a factor. At maturity, the cystacanth stage of  Plagiorhynchus  
grows  to  about  3  mm,  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  internal 
environment of an 8 mm pill bug! 

 Moore  brought   Armadillidium   into  the  laboratory  and 
established  two  laboratory  populations:  an  uninfected  con-
trol group and an infected experimental group. She infected 
half the laboratory populations of  Armadillidium  by feeding 
them pieces of carrot coated with  Plagiorhynchus  eggs, while 
keeping the remaining laboratory populations free of  Plagio-
rhynchus.  After 3 months, the  Plagiorhynchus  in the infected 
populations  matured  to  the  cystacanth  stage.  At  this  point 
Moore mixed the infected and uninfected populations. 

 Because   Plagiorhynchus   does  not  alter  the  outward 
appearance  of   Armadillidium,   Moore  could  not  determine 
whether an  Armadillidium  was infected or not until she dis-
sected  it  at  the  completion  of  an  experiment.  Consequently, 
all the behavioral experiments were conducted “blind”—that

Leaving shelter makes the

birds. When eaten by a bird, the 
mature Plagiorhynchus attaches 
to the bird’s intestinal wall.

is, without the possibility of observer bias due to prior knowl-
edge of the identity of experimental and control animals. 

 Moore found that  Plagiorhynchus  alters the behavior of 
 Armadillidium  in several ways. Infected  Armadillidium  spend 
less  time  in  sheltered  areas  and  more  time  in  low-humidity 
environments and on light-colored substrates. These changes 
in behavior would increase the time an  Armadillidium  spends 
in the open, where it could be easily seen and eaten by a bird. 
 In laboratory experiments Moore demonstrated that cap-
tive starlings consistently captured  Armadillidium  from light 
rather  than  dark  substrates.  She  provided  caged  starlings 
access to a mixture of 10 infected and 10 uninfected  Arma-
dillidium,   which  wandered  freely  across  the  bottom  of  the 
cage,  half  of  which  was  covered  by  black  sand  and  half  by 
white sand. Under these conditions, starlings ate 72% of the 
infected  Armadillidium  but only 44% of the uninfected indi-
viduals ( fig. 14.3 ). The starlings took isopods mainly from the 
surface of white sand, so it seems that the tendency of  Arma-
dillidium   to  seek  out  light  substrates  does  make  them  more 
vulnerable to predation by birds.     

 A critical step in this research was to determine whether 
the  changed  behavior  of  infected   Armadillidium   translates 
into their being eaten more frequently by wild birds. Moore 
collected the arthropods that starlings feed to their nestlings 
and from these collections estimated the rate at which they 
delivered   Armadillidium —about  one  every  10  hours.  Using 
this  delivery  rate  and  the  proportion  of  the   Armadillidium  
population  infected  by   Plagiorhynchus   (about  0.4%),  she 
was able to predict the expected rate of infection among star-
ling nestlings if the adults capture  Armadillidium  at random 
from the natural population. The proportion of infected nest-
lings was about twice the rate of infection predicted if star-
lings fed randomly on the  Armadillidium  population. These 
results support Moore’s hypothesis that the altered behavior 

Probably because of their more conspicuous 
behavior, a higher proportion of isopods infected 
with Plagiorhynchus were eaten by starlings.

 Moore  emphasized  that   Plagiorhynchus   does  not  just 
alter  Armadillidium ’s behavior but alters its behavior in a par-
ticular  way—in  a  way  that  increases  the  rate  at  which  star-
lings, the final host of the parasite, are infected.  

  A Plant Pathogen that Mimics Flowers 
 Every year the slopes of the southern Rocky Mountains are 
decorated with the colorful blossoms of wildflowers. Some 
of these wildflowers, however, are not quite what they seem. 
One  bright  yellow  and  sweet-smelling  “blossom”  is  actu-
ally produced by a pathogenic fungus that manipulates the 
growth of its host plant. This pathogen belongs to a group of 
fungi called rusts because of their rust-colored spores that 
appear  on  the  surface  of  the  infected  host  plant. This  par-
ticular rust is  Puccinia monoica,  and its hosts are mustard 
plants in the genus  Arabis. Arabis  spp. are herbaceous plants 
that spend anywhere from a few months to several years as 
a  rosette,  a  low-growing  growth  form  with  a  high  density 
of leaves. During the rosette stage  Arabis  invests heavily in 
root development and storage of energy in the roots. At the 
end of the rosette stage,  Arabis  grows tall quickly, a process 
called  bolting,  and flowers ( fig. 14.4 a  ). Once pollinated, the 
flowers form seeds that mature, completing the life cycle of 
 Arabis.  

       However,   Puccinia   completely  alters  the  life  history  of 
 Arabis.  It attacks the rosette stage, manipulating its develop-
ment  to  produce  a  growth  form  that  promotes  reproduction 
by the fungus and usually kills the plant.  Puccinia  infects the 
rosettes of  Arabis  in late summer and then invades the    meriste-
matic tissue,    the actively dividing tissue responsible for plant 
growth, during the following winter. As it invades the meriste-
matic tissue,  Puccinia  manipulates future development by the 
rosette. Infected rosettes elongate rapidly the following spring, 
maintain a high density of leaves along their entire length, and 
are topped by a cluster of bright yellow leaves. This cluster of 
yellow leaves forms a pseudoflower that looks very much like 
the flowers of the buttercup,  Ranunculus  spp. ( fig. 14.4 b  ). 

 The pseudoflowers of infected rosettes are produced by 
various  fungal  structures,  including  spermogonia  contain-
ing  spermatia  (fungal  reproductive  cells),  sexually  receptive 
fungal  hyphae,  and  secretions  of  sticky,  sugar-containing 
spermatial  fluid.  Most  rusts  require  outcrossing  for  sexual 
reproduction,  which  is  accomplished  by  insects  transferring 
spermatia from one fungus (thallus) to the receptive hyphae of 
another thallus. Barbara Roy (1993) found that the combina-
tion of yellow color and sugary fluid attracts a wide variety 
of flower-visiting insects, including butterflies, bees, and flies 
( fig.  14.5 ).  Flies,  the  most  common  visitor  to  pseudoflow-
ers at her Colorado study site, have been demonstrated to be 
effective carriers of rust spermatia.     

 Roy’s  studies  demonstrated  that   Puccinia   truncates  the 
life cycle of  Arabis  and in the process generally kills the host 
plant. The  Arabis  that survive attack by  Puccinia  may go on 
to flower but none form seeds. Thus, destruction by  Puccinia  
is total.

  The Entangling of Exploitation 
with Competition 
 We  often  arrange  our  thoughts  about  nature  in  neat  catego-
ries, like the chapters of this book. In chapter 13 we discussed 
competition,  in  chapter  14  we  discuss  exploitative  interac-
tions, and in chapter 15 we examine mutualism. Nature itself 
is not so neatly arranged, nor are natural phenomena so eas-
ily isolated. One process is usually connected to several oth-
ers. The distinction between exploitation and competition is 
blurred when competitors eat each other. 

  Predation, Parasitism, and Competition 
in Populations of  Tribolium  
 Thomas Park and his colleagues (Park 1948; Park et al. 1965) 
uncovered one of the very first examples of competitors eat-
ing each other during their work on competition among flour 
beetles. As  we  saw  in  chapter  13,  the  outcome  of  competi-
tion between  Tribolium castaneum  and  T. confusum  depended 
upon temperature and moisture. It turns out that the presence 
or absence of a protozoan parasite of  Tribolium, Adelina tri-
bolii,   also  influences  the  competitive  balance  between  flour 
beetle species. The effects of this parasite are also entangled 
with predation among the flour beetles and cannibalism, which 
we might think of as a form of intraspecific exploitation. 

 Figure 14.5   The pseudoflowers formed by  Arabis  holboellii  
infected by the fungus  Puccinia monoica,  such as the one shown 
here, are attractive to a wide variety of pollinating insects, such 
as this   Polygonia  butterfly.

Section IV 

 

Interactions

 Park  showed  that  various  strains  of   T.  castaneum   and 
T. confusum  differ in their rates of cannibalism. Of the two spe-
cies,  T. castaneum  is the most cannibalistic but it preys on the 
eggs of  T. confusum  at an even higher rate than it cannibalizes its 
own eggs. In the light of its predatory behavior, it’s not surprising 
that  T. castaneum  eliminated  T. confusum  in 84% of 76 competi-
tion experiments spanning a period of about 10 years. This pred-
atory strategy works best, however, in the absence of  Adelina.  

  Adelina  invades the cells of its host and lives its life as an 
intracellular parasite. Beetles become infected when they ingest 
the oocysts of this parasite, either as they feed on flour or as they 
consume infected larvae, pupae, or adult beetles. Once in the 
gut of the beetle, the oocyst eggs rupture, liberating a life stage 
of   Adelina   called  a   sporozoite.  The  sporozoites  penetrate  the 
beetle’s gut and enter the body cavity, or haemocoel. Once in 
the haemocoel, the sporozoites invade various cells, where they 
reproduce asexually and produce a second life stage called the 
 merozoite.   The  motile  merozoites  invade  yet  other  host  cells 
eventually, producing male and female sex cells that combine 
to form zygotes. The zygotes eventually give rise to new sporo-
zoites, which are encased in oocysts. Ingestion of these oocysts 
by another beetle completes the life cycle of  Adelina.  

 Several  biologists  before  Park  had  noted  that   Adelina
caused “sickness” and death among  Tribolium  populations. It 
was  Park,  however,  who  demonstrated  that   Adelina   reduces 
the  density  of   Tribolium   populations  and  can  alter  the  out-
come of competition between  T. confusum  and  T. castaneum. 
Adelina  strongly reduces the population density of  T. casta-
neum  populations but has little effect on  T. confusum  popula-
tions. In the absence of the parasite,  T. castaneum  won 12 of 
18 competitive contests against  T. confusum.  When the para-
site was included, however,  T. confusum  won 11 of 15 contests 
( fig. 14.6 ). In other words, parasitism completely reverses the 

In the absence of Adelina, 
T. castaneum outcompetes 
T. confusum most of the time.

However, in the presence of 
Adelina, T. confusum is 
usually the better competitor.

From  insects  to  African  lions,  interference  escalated  to  the 
point of predation appears to be a common occurrence among 
competitors.  However,  Park’s  experiments  with   Tribolium
indicate that parasites may make the outcome of a predaceous 
competitive strategy difficult to predict.

  14.2  Exploitation and Abundance 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 14.6  Outline the field experiment Lamberti and Resh 
used to determine the influence of the caddisfly 
Helicopsyche on algal biomass.

 14.7  Describe the experimental manipulations and control 

in the studies by Kalka, Smith, and Kalko to deter-
mine the relative influences of birds and bats on foli-
age arthropods in tropical forest.

 14.8  Discuss possible sources of uncertainty regarding 
the conclusion that foxes control hare populations 
in Sweden, which was based on hare population 
increases following parasite-caused fox mortality.

   Predators, parasites, and pathogens influence the distri-
bution, abundance, and structure of prey and host popu-
lations.   One of the main reasons ecologists are interested 
in  exploitative  interactions  between  species  is  that  these 
interactions  have  the  potential  to  influence  prey  and  host 
populations. A rapidly growing pool of studies suggests that 
predators,  parasites,  and  pathogens  substantially  affect  the 
abundance of the organisms they exploit.  

   A Herbivorous Stream Insect 
and Its Algal Food 
 Gary Lamberti and Vincent Resh (1983) studied the influence 
of a herbivorous stream insect on the algal and bacterial popu-
lations upon which it feeds. The herbivorous insect was the 
larval stage of the caddisfly (order Trichoptera)  Helicopsyche 
borealis.   This  insect  inhabits  streams  across  most  of  North 
America and is most notable for the type of portable shelter 
it  builds  as  a  larva. The  larvae  cement  sand  grains  together 
to  form  a  helical  portable  home  that  looks  just  like  a  small 
snail  shell.  In  fact,  the  species  was  originally  described  as 
a  freshwater  snail.  Larval   Helicopsyche   graze  on  the  algae 
and  bacteria growing on the exposed surfaces of submerged 
stones.  This  feeding  habit  requires  that   Helicopsyche   spend

considerable time out in the open, where it would be far more 
vulnerable to predators were it not for its case. 

 Lamberti and Resh found that larval  Helicopsyche  grow 
and develop through the summer and fall, attaining densities of 
over 4,000 individuals per square meter in Big Sulphur Creek, 
California. At this density, they make up about 25% of the total 
biomass  of  benthic  animals.  A  consumer  that  reaches  such 
high population densities clearly has the potential to reduce the 
density of its food supply. Lamberti and Resh got an indica-
tion of the potential of  Helicopsyche  to influence its food sup-
ply in a preliminary experiment. In this first experiment, they 
placed unglazed ceramic tiles (15.2 cm  3  7.6 cm) on the bot-
tom of the creek and followed colonization of these artificial 
substrates by algae and  Helicopsyche  over a period of 7 weeks. 
 Algae rapidly colonized the tiles, reaching peak density 
2 weeks after the tiles were placed in Big Sulphur Creek. The 
 Helicopsyche  population reached its highest density 1 week 
later. Algal biomass decreased from week 2 to week 5 of the 
study  and  then  rose  again  during  the  last  2  weeks,  as   Heli-
copsyche  numbers declined. These results ( fig. 14.7 ) suggest 
that the caddisfly larvae depleted their food supply.     

 In  a  follow-up  study,  the  researchers  used  an  exclusion 
experiment  to  test  for  the  effect  of   Helicopsyche   on  its  food 
supply ( fig. 14.8 ). They placed unglazed ceramic tiles in two 
336  grids  of  18  tiles  each.  One  grid  was  placed  directly  on 
the stream bottom, while the other was placed on a metal plate 
supported by an upside-down J-shaped metal bar. This arrange-
ment, which raised the tiles 15 cm above the bottom but still 
35 cm below the stream surface, allowed colonization of tiles 
by algae and most invertebrates while preventing colonization 
by   Helicopsyche.  Helicopsyche   could  not  colonize  the  tiles 

because  their  heavy,  snail-shaped  case  confines  them  to  the 
stream bottom. To reach the tiles,  Helicopsyche  would have to 
crawl up the J-shaped support bar, out of the water, and then 
back down, while most other invertebrates could colonize by 
either  drifting  downstream  with  the  current  or  by  swimming 
to the raised tiles. Lamberti and Resh coated the above-water 
parts of the bar with an adhesive to prevent adult  Helicopsyche  
from  crawling  down  to  the  tiles  to  deposit  their  eggs.  The 
experimental arrangement excluded  Helicopsyche  while allow-
ing other invertebrates to colonize the raised tiles. Such selec-
tive manipulations of natural populations are not easy to attain.   
 The results of this experiment clearly show that  Helico-
psyche  reduces the abundance of its food supply.  Figure 14.9  
shows  that  the  tiles  without   Helicopsyche   supported  higher 
abundances  of  both  algae  and  bacteria.  The  large  effect  of 
 Helicopsyche  on its food supply is apparent from paired pho-
tos of the experimental and control tiles at the beginning and 
the end of the experiment.     

 The influence of exploitation on populations is often best 
seen when populations are released from exploitation. This is 
what we saw when  Helicopsyche  were excluded from experi-
mental  habitats.  Similar  responses  occur  when  exploited 
populations are introduced into new environments free of sig-
nificant predators, herbivores, or pathogens.  

  Bats, Birds, and Herbivory 
in a Tropical Forest 
 The  dominant  herbivores  in  the  complex  three-dimensional 
framework  of  forests  are  arthropods.  At  times,  the  number 
and  biomass  of  herbivorous  arthropods  in  forests  can  be  so 

Chlorophyll a, which indicates 
algal biomass, increased 
quickly during the first 2 
weeks of the experiment.

Then, as Helicopsyche 
colonized the artificial 
substrates, algal 
biomass declined.

great that they, in combination with stressful physical condi-
tions, such as drought, cause large-scale tree mortality (e.g., 
Kane and Kolb 2010). Can predators limit arthropod numbers 
in forests? This question has been addressed by a number of 

researchers,  particularly  in  regard  to  the  potential  of  birds 
to  depress  forest  arthropod  numbers  (e.g.,  Holmes,  Schultz, 
and  Nothnagle  1979;  Marquis  and Whelan  1994; Van  Bael, 
Brawn, and Robinson 2008).

  Exploitative Interactions:  Predation, Herbivory, Parasitism, and Disease  

311

 Among the first to do so, Margareta Kalka, Adam Smith, 
and  Elisabeth  Kalko  (2008),  designed  an  experiment  to  dis-
tinguish between the influences of birds and bats on tropical 
forest arthropods. Many species of bats are known to feed on 
arthropods living on foliage in forests. These so called “foli-
age gleaning” bats are particularly common in tropical forests. 
Kalka, Smith, and Kalko conducted their research in a lowland 
tropical forest in Panama, where they, like previous research-
ers,  covered  plants  with  mesh  to  exclude  arthropod-feeding 
vertebrates. Unlike previous researchers, however, Kalka and 
her colleagues covered one set of plants during the day only 
and  another  set  of  plants  during  the  night  only. As  a  result, 
they excluded birds from plants that they covered during the 
day and bats from the plants that they covered at night. Their 
study included 43 plants with day exclosures ( 2  birds,  1  bats), 
42 plants with night exclosures ( 2 bats,  1 birds), and 35 uncov-
ered control plants. Previous studies that had used exclosures 
had left them in place for the duration of the study, excluding 
birds and bats, and therefore unable to distinguish between the 
influences of the two groups of predators. The research team 
covered and uncovered their experimental plants at the appro-
priate time each day for 10 weeks and visually censused the 
arthropods on all three sets of plants. 

 The  results  of  Kalka’s  study  showed  that  both  birds 
and  bats  reduce  foliage-living  arthropods  significantly 
( fig.  14.10 ).  However,  the  results  also  show  that  previous 
researchers  had  not  anticipated  the  great  effect  that  bats 
can  have  on  arthropod  densities  in  forests.  As  shown  in 
 figure 14.10a , plants from which birds had been excluded, 
but  that  continued  to  be  visited  by  bats,  supported  arthro-
pods  at  densities  65%  higher  than  control  plants.  Mean-
while, those plants from which bats had been excluded and 
on which birds could feed during the day supported 150% 
higher arthropod densities compared to control plants. With 
this well-designed experiment, Kalka, Smith, and Kalko dis-
entangled the influences of birds and bats and revealed the 
great potential of bats to limit arthropod numbers in tropical 
forests, a level of influence that appears to have been unsus-
pected  previously  by  most  researchers  working  on  foliage 
gleaning in tropical forests.  

    A Pathogenic Parasite, 
a Predator, and Its Prey 
 One  of  the  great  challenges  of  ecology  is  to  work  at  large 
scales.  Ecologists  rarely  have  the  opportunity  to  conduct 
large-scale  experiments;  however,  nature  sometimes  pro-
vides such opportunities. One such opportunity arose in Swe-
den when a pathogen severely reduced the population of red 
foxes,  Vulpes vulpes.  

 Erik Lindström and his colleagues (1994) at the Grimsö 
Wildlife  Research  Station  in  Örebro  County  reported  that 
mange mites,  Sarcoptes scabiei,  were first found infesting red 
foxes in north-central Sweden in 1975. The researchers stud-
ied the spread of mange because mange mites are a serious 
external parasite of foxes that causes hair loss, skin deterio-
ration,  and  death. Within  a  decade  of  its  arrival  in  Sweden,

mange had spread over the entire country ( fig. 14.11 ). As it 
spread, mange reduced the population of red foxes in Sweden 
by over 70%.   

 As  wildlife  ecologists,  Lindström’s  research  team  was 
keenly interested in how the prey of red foxes would respond. 
Would they find evidence of population control by this preda-
tor?  From  1972  to  1993,  the  research  team  studied  several 
prey  populations  as  well  as  red  fox  populations. They  used

between numbers of red foxes and mountain hares,  Lepus tim-
idus,  in Sweden. Following the reduction in the red fox popu-
lation,  the  number  of  mountain  hares  increased  two  to  four 
times. This is an especially thorough and convincing demon-
stration of the influence of a terrestrial vertebrate predator on 
its  prey  populations. The  study  also  suggests  that  red  foxes 
may have a significant influence on the cyclic abundance of 
some of their prey species. The dynamics of prey populations 
have been the subject of research by ecologists for some time. 
Studies of predation have been central to this research.   

  Concept 14.2 Review 

 1.   The patterns shown in  figure 14.7  suggest that  Helico-
psyche   depletes  its  algal  food  supply.  However,  Lam-
berti and Resh were not certain and so conducted their 
second set of experiments. Why could they not reach a 
firm conclusion regarding the effect of  Helicopsyche  on 
its food supply based on their first experiment?  

     2.   How  could  you  test  experimentally  for  the  combined 
influence of bats and birds on numbers of arthropods on 
foliage, as well as their individual contributions?

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 14.9  List the major hypotheses proposed to explain 

 snowshoe hare population cycles.

 14.10  Discuss the roles of food supply and predators in 

producing snowshoe hare population cycles.

 14.11  Explain how the field experiment by Krebs and his 
colleagues improved our understanding of the rela-
tive effects of food and predators on snowshoe hare 
populations, beyond what had been learned through 
observational studies.

 14.12  Describe the unique contributions of mathematical and 

laboratory models to the study of population cycles.

   Predator-prey, host-parasite, and host-pathogen relation-
ships  are  dynamic.  
In  the  last  section  we  saw  how  some 
predators, parasites, and pathogens affect the populations they 
exploit. The picture that emerges from these studies is that the 
biology of exploitation is complex. As complex as this emerg-
ing  picture  of  exploitation  may  be,  it  belies  an  even  deeper 
underlying complexity. In this section, we add another level 
of complexity as we take up the topic of  temporal dynamics.
Populations  of  a  wide  variety  of  predators  and  prey  are  not 
static but cycle in abundance over periods of days to decades.

snowshoe hare and lynx populations are driven by variation in 
amount of solar radiation as a consequence of sunspot cycles. 
He proposed that variation in intensity of solar radiation may 
directly affect snowshoe hares and their food supply and that 
lynx populations, in turn, respond to the changing abundance 
of the snowshoe hare, their main prey. 

 The sunspot hypothesis was rejected by D. MacLulich 
(1937) and P. Moran (1949), who showed that sunspot cycles 
do not match snowshoe hare population cycles. The second 
group of hypotheses, which Lloyd Keith (1963) referred to 
as “overpopulation theories,” suggested that periods of high 
population  growth  are  followed  by:  (1)  decimation  by  dis-
ease and parasitism, (2) physiological stress at high densities 
leading to increased mortality as a consequence of nervous 
disorders,  and  (3)  starvation  due  to  reduced  quantity  and 
quality of food at high population densities. An alternative 
to  the  overpopulation  hypothesis  was  that  cycles  like  that 
of the snowshoe hare are driven by predators. According to 
this hypothesis, predators increase in number in response to 
increasing prey availability and then eventually reduce prey 
populations.  

  Keith observed that none of these hypotheses completely 
accounts  for  population  cycles  in  snowshoe  hare  and  other 
northern  populations.  He  went  on  to  say  that,  “the  10-year 
cycle  is  not  likely  to  become  better  understood  by  further 
theorizing.  Clearly  the  present  need  is  for  comprehensive 
long-term investigations by a diversified team of specialists.” 
Heeding his own advice, Keith organized such studies. After 
three decades of research by his team and several other groups 
in North America and Europe, we now have a reasonable pic-
ture of the roles played by predators and food supply in pro-
ducing population cycles in the far north. 

  The Role of Food Supply 
 Snowshoe hares live in the boreal forests of North America. As

We have already seen in chapter 10 how periodic outbreaks 
of  voles  lead  to  local  increases  in  the  abundance  of  avian 
predators  due  to  numerical  responses  by  owls  and  kestrels 
( Korpimäki and Norrdahl 1991). 

 One of the best-studied cases of animal population cycles 
is that of the snowshoe hare,  Lepus americanus,  and the lynx, 
 Lynx canadensis,  one of the snowshoe hare’s chief predators 
( fig.  14.13 ). The  population  cycles  of  these  two  species  are 
especially  well  documented  because  the  Hudson  Bay  Com-
pany  kept  trapping  records  during  most  of  the  eighteenth, 
nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. Drawing on this unique 
historical  record  ecologists  were  able  to  estimate  the  rela-
tive abundances of Canadian lynx and snowshoe hare over a 
period of about 200 years. That record, shown in  figure 14.14 , 
demonstrates  a  remarkable  match  in  the  cycles  of  the  two 
populations.         

 By the 1950s, several hypotheses had been proposed to 
explain  these  and  other  cycles  among  northern  populations. 
Charles  Elton  (1924)  proposed  that  cycles  of  abundance  in 

Lynx and snowshoe hare 
populations show long-term 
cycles in population density.

This impressive record of population cycles led

LEARNING OUTCOMES

a  tributary  of  the  San  Francisco  River  in  southwestern  New 
Mexico. Suppose you are comparing the body sizes of loach 
minnows in populations exposed to predation by flathead cat-
fish, an introduced species, to populations not exposed to pre-
dation by this introduced fish. To do so you need to estimate 
body sizes in several populations. 

 Your sample from the San Francisco River was:

 When we introduced the sample mean, we pointed out how it 
is an estimate of the actual, or true, population mean. A sec-
ond sample from a population would probably have a differ-
ent sample mean and a third sample would have yet another. 
How  close  is  a  given  sample  mean  to  the  true  population 
mean? The answer to this question will depend on two fac-
tors: the variation within the population and the number of 
observations or measurements in our sample from the popu-
lation.  Here,  we  will  begin  to  build  a  way  of  representing 
the precision of a given estimate of a population mean. Our 
first  step  will  be  to  calculate  a  statistic  called  the  standard 
error of the mean, usually called the    standard error,       s _
 X .  The 
standard  error  is  calculated  from  the  sample  variance  (see 
chapter 4, p. 88) and the sample size as follows:

of  10  loach  minnows,  this  second  sample  included  50  loach 
minnows. The standard error calculated from this sample is:

paper birch,  Betula papyrifera.  Within the boreal forest, snow-
shoe hares associate with dense growths of understory shrubs, 
which  provide  both  cover  and  winter  food,  the  most  critical 
portion of the snowshoe hare’s food supply. 

 Snowshoe hares have the potential to reduce the quantity 
and quality of their food supply. The hares live up to the leg-
endary reproductive capacity of rabbits and hares. Estimated 
geometric  rate  of  increase,   l   (see  chapter  10),  during  the 
growth phase of a hare population cycle can average as high 
as 2.0. In other words, snowshoe hare populations can double 
in size each generation. Keith and his colleagues (1984) have 

observed snowshoe hare population densities of up to 1,100 
to  2,300  per  square  kilometer.  However,  local  densities  are 
highly  dynamic.  Keith  cites  100-fold  fluctuations  in  snow-
shoe hare densities in some areas and states that 10- to 30-fold 
fluctuations  are  common.  Similar  densities  are   sometimes 
observed in populations of the mountain hare,  Lepus  timidus,  
which  shows  pronounced  population  cycles  across  the 
 Eurasian taiga (Keith 1983) and which destroys considerable 
vegetation at high densities. 

 Snowshoe  hares  spend  the  long  northern  winter 
(6–8 months) browsing on the buds and small stems of shrubs

    Notice that because there were more minnows in this second 
sample, the size of the standard error is considerably smaller. 
In other words, our second sample mean is a more precise esti-
mate of the true population mean. This is shown in the form of 
a graph in  figure 1 . In  figure 1 a   the points indicate the sample 
means  for  our  two  samples  and  the  vertical  bars,  above  and 
below the points, are plus and minus one standard error. The 
same statistics are plotted in  figure 1 b   as a bar graph and only 
the  upper  standard  error  bar  is  shown,  which  is  a  common 
way to plot such data. In either case, the smaller standard error 

around the sample mean for the Gila River indicates that our 
estimate of the mean length of loach minnows in the population 
is more precise there than for the population in the San Fran-
cisco River. In Investigating the Evidence 15 (see p. 345) we 
will use the standard error to derive a more quantitative expres-
sion of precision called the confidence interval.     

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  14

mean, why, from a statistical perspective, is it always bet-

such as rose,  Rosa  spp., and willow,  Salix  spp. Where deep 
snow provides access, snowshoe hares browse on the saplings 
of  trees  such  as  spruce  and  aspen. The  most  nutritious  por-
tions of these shrubs and trees are the small stems (,4–5 mm 
diameter).  Over  the  winter,  each  hare  requires  about  300  g 
of these stems each day. In some areas, however, snowshoe 
hares have been observed to remove over 1,500 g of food bio-
mass per day, possibly wasting a great deal of potential food 
in the process. Feeding at these rates, one population of snow-
shoe hares reduced food biomass from 530 kg per hectare in 
late  November  to  160  kg  per  hectare  by  late  March.  Many 

ecologists  have  demonstrated  food  shortages  during  winters 
of peak snowshoe hare density. 

 Snowshoe  hares  also  influence  the  quality  of  their 
food  supply.  Feeding  by  snowshoe  hares  induces  chemical 
defenses in their food plants, defenses like those we discussed 
in chapter 7. Shoots produced after substantial browsing con-
tain  elevated  concentrations  of  terpene  and  phenolic  resins, 
defensive  chemicals  that  repel  hungry  hares.  Elevated  con-
centrations of plant defensive chemicals can persist for up to 
2 years after browsing by hares. The effect of these induced 
chemical  defenses  reduces   usable   food  supplies  during  the

population decline. Some ecologists suggest that plant defen-
sive responses may be the “timer” that produces 10-year pop-
ulation cycles in snowshoe hares.  

  The Role of Predators 
 The long historical record of lynx population cycles may have 
distracted ecologists from the fact that lynxs are only one of 
several  predators  that  feed  on  snowshoe  hares.  Other  major 
predators  of  snowshoe  hares  include  goshawks,   Accipiter 
gentilis;  great horned owls,  Bubo virginianus;  mink,  Mustela 
vison;  long-tailed weasels,  Mustela frenata;  red foxes,  Vulpes 
vulpes;  and coyotes,  Canis latrans.  Populations of these pred-
ators are known to cycle synchronously with snowshoe hare 
populations. Though the lynx is considered to be a specialist 
on snowshoe hares, the diet of a generalist predator such as 
the coyote may also be dominated by snowshoe hares. This is 
particularly true when snowshoe hare populations are at peak 
density.  A.  Todd  and  L.  Keith  (1983)  report  that  snowshoe 
hares made up 67% of the coyote diets in central Alberta, Can-
ada. Ecologists have estimated that predation can account for 
60% to 90% of snowshoe hare mortality during peak densities. 
 Research  by  Mark  O’Donoghue  and  several  colleagues 
from  Canada,  Argentina,  and  Alaska  (O’Donoghue  et  al. 
1997,  1998)  provides  clear  evidence  of  predator   functional 
response   (see  p.  164)  and   numerical  response   (see  p.  222) 
to increased hare densities. O’Donoghue and his colleagues 
focused  their  research  on  two  of  the  most  important  preda-
tors of adult snowshoe hares: lynx and coyotes. Their study 
shows that coyote and lynx numbers increase six- to seven-
fold, a numerical response, following increases in snowshoe 
hare populations. The two predators also showed functional 
responses  to  increased  hare  densities.  However,  coyote  and 
lynx functional responses differed in their timing and form. 
The lynx killed more hares when hare numbers were declin-
ing,  while  coyotes  showed  higher  predation  rates  when  the 
hare population was increasing. O’Donoghue and colleagues 
discovered that lynx show a clear type 2 functional response 
(see fig. 7.22) to increasing hare densities, reaching a maxi-
mum number of 1.2 hares per day at medium hare densities. 
In contrast, coyotes preyed on up to 2.3 hares per day at the 
highest  hare  densities  and  their  functional  response  showed 
no  signs  of  leveling  off. At  high  hare  densities,  coyote  and 
lynx  predation  rates  exceeded  their  daily  energetic  needs. 
Coyotes killed more hares early in the winter, caching many 
and retrieving them later in the season. In some instances indi-
vidual coyotes returned to eat hares over 4 months after they 
were  cached.  The  combination  of  numerical  and  functional 
responses  by  lynx  and  coyotes  indicate  great  potential  for 
these predators to reduce snowshoe hare populations. 

 In  summary,  several  decades  of  research  provided  evi-
dence that both predation and food can make substantial con-
tributions to snowshoe hare population cycles (Haukioja et al. 
1983; Keith 1983; Keith et al. 1984). The food availability and 
predation hypotheses are not mutually exclusive alternatives 
but rather are complementary. As hare populations increase, 
they  reduce  the  quantity  and  quality  of  their  food  supply. 
Reduced  food  availability,  which  leads  to  starvation  and 

weight  loss,  would  itself  likely  produce  population  decline. 
This potential decline is ensured and accelerated by high rates 
of mortality due to predation. As hare population density is 
reduced,  predator  populations  decline  in  turn,  plant  popula-
tions recover, and the stage is set for another increase in the 
hare population. This scenario was tested through a series of 
long-term experiments.   

  Experimental Test of Food 
and Predation Impacts 
 Charles  J.  Krebs  and  several  colleagues  (Krebs  et  al.  1995) 
conducted a large-scale, long-term experiment designed to sort 
out the tangle of conflicting evidence regarding the impacts of 
food and predation on snowshoe hare population cycles. Over 
a period of 8 years, Krebs and colleagues conducted one of the 
most ambitious field experiments to date. Their experimental 
plots  consisted  of  nine  1  km 2   blocks  of  undisturbed  boreal 
forest,  each  separated  from  other  experimental  blocks  by  a 
minimum of 1 km. Three blocks served as controls for com-
parison to the six other blocks where experimental treatments 
were  applied.  To  test  the  impact  of  food,  hares  were  given 
unlimited supplemental food on two experimental blocks dur-
ing the entire period of the study. To test for the possible influ-
ences of plant tissue quality on hare numbers, the researchers 
applied  a  nitrogen-potassium-phosphorus  fertilizer  from  the 
air to two of the experimental blocks. Finally, they built elec-
tric fences around two of the 1 km 2  blocks, which excluded 
mammalian predators but not hawks and owls. One of these 
predator reduction blocks received supplemental food. Krebs 
and  his  colleagues  report  that,  due  to  maintenance  require-
ments,  they  could  not  replicate  the  predator  reduction  and 
predator reduction  1  food experimental manipulations. They 
could not, since the fences on both predator reduction areas 
(8  km  of  fence)  had  to  be  checked  every  day  through  the 
winter,  when  temperatures  would  sometimes  dip  as  low  as 
 2 45   8 C. Krebs’s research team maintained these experimental 
conditions through one cycle in snowshoe hare numbers. 

 During  the  8  years  of  the  experiment,  the  researchers 
observed an increase in hare numbers to a peak, followed by 
a decline on all the study plots. The application of fertilizer 
increased plant growth within the fertilizer treatment blocks 
but did not increase numbers of snowshoe hares. Meanwhile 
compared  to  control  plots,  hare  numbers  increased  substan-
tially  on  food  addition,  predator  reduction,  and  predator 
reduction   1   food  study  plots.  Averaged  over  the  peak  and 
decline phases during the study, reducing predators doubled 
hare density, adding food tripled hare density, and excluding 
predators and adding food increased hare density to 11 times 
that  of  the  controls  ( fig.  14.15 ).  What  factors  contributed 
to  these  increased  densities  within  treatment  blocks?  Krebs 
and his colleagues found that higher densities on experimen-
tal  plots  were  the  result  of  both  higher  survival  and  higher 
reproduction.   

 After  approximately  70  years  of  research,  we  can  con-
clude that the population cycle in snowshoe hares is the result 
of an interaction among three trophic levels: the hares, their

food supply, and their predators. Krebs and colleagues (2001) 
point out, however, that in order to understand the controls on 
hare numbers, researchers have had to work with all three tro-
phic levels simultaneously. In addition, the critical experiment 
had to be done on a large scale and in the field. Still, a great 
deal of insight into this large-scale predator-prey system has 
come from laboratory and mathematical studies.  

  Population Cycles in Mathematical 
and Laboratory Models 
 Now  let’s  shift  our  focus  from  population  cycles  in  the  vast 
world of the boreal forest to population cycles in mathematical 
models  and  controlled  laboratory  conditions.   Mathematical 
and laboratory models offer population ecologists the opportu-
nity to manipulate variables that they cannot control in the field. 
Our  question  here  is  whether  predator-prey  or   parasite-host 
cycles can be produced in mathematical and laboratory models 
without the complications introduced by factors, such as the 
effects of the prey on its food supply and uncontrolled weather 
cycles. In other words, can the interactions among exploited 
populations themselves generate  population cycles of the type 
observed in snowshoe hares? The answer to this question is a 
qualified yes. 

  Mathematical Models 
 The  first  ecologists  to  model  predator-prey  interactions  math-
ematically were Alfred Lotka (1925) and Vito Volterra (1926). 
Both  researchers  built  their  models  based  on  observations  of 
interactions among natural populations. Lotka was impressed by 
the reciprocal oscillations of populations of moth and butterfly 

larvae and the parasitoids that attack them. Volterra was inspired 
by the response of marine fish populations to cessation of fishing 
during World War I. Volterra observed that the responses of fish 
populations were uneven. Predaceous fish, particularly sharks, 
increased in abundance, while the populations upon which they 
fed  decreased.  This  reciprocal  change  in  numbers  suggested 
that  predators  have  the  potential  to  reduce  the  abundance  of 
their prey. In this single observation, Volterra somehow saw the 
potential for predator-prey population cycles and suggested that 
similar cycles should occur in parasite-host and pathogen-host 
systems,  including  those  in  which  humans  are  involved. With 
these observations in mind, Lotka and Volterra then set out to 
build mathematical models that would produce the cycles that 
they thought occurred in nature. 

 The  Lotka-Volterra  predator-prey  equations  demon-
strated that very simple models will produce cycling of preda-
tor and prey populations (called predators and “hosts” in the 
discussion that follows to make the measuring of the terms in 
the equations clear). The basic Lotka-Volterra model assumes 
that the host population grows at an exponential rate and that 
host population size is limited by its predators:

dNh 
____ 
  
dt

     5 rhNh 2 pNhNp    

This  equation  models  change  in  the  host  population  size, 
where  r   h   N   h   represents exponential growth by the host popula-
tion. In the Lotka-Volterra model, exponential growth by the 
host population is opposed by deaths due to predation, which 
is represented by 2pNhNp, where  p  is the rate of predation,  N   h   
is again the number of hosts, and  N   p   is the number of predators. 
 On the other side of the predator-prey system, the Lotka-
Volterra model assumes that the rate of growth by the predator 
population is determined by the rate at which it converts the 
hosts  it  consumes  into  offspring  (new  predators)  minus  the 
mortality rate of the predator population:

dNp 
____ 
  
dt

     5 cpNhNp 2 dpNp    

Here again,  N   h   and  N   p   are the numbers of hosts and predators, 
respectively. The rate at which the predators convert hosts into 
offspring is cpNhNp, which is the rate at which they destroy hosts, 
pNhNp, times a conversion factor, c, the rate at which hosts are 
converted to predator offspring. In the Lotka-Volterra equation, 
the growth rate of the predator population is opposed by preda-
tor deaths, dpNp. Notice that in these equations the only variables 
are Nh and Np. All the other terms in the Lotka-Volterra model, 
p,  c,  dp,  and  rh,  are  constants.  The  Lotka- Volterra  predator-
prey model is summarized in  figure 14.16 .     

 Now let’s reflect on the behavior of this model. Because 
the  host  population  grows  at  an  exponential  rate,  its  popu-
lation  growth  accelerates  with  increasing  population  size. 
However, this tendency to grow faster and faster with increas-
ing   N   h    is  opposed  by  predation.  As   Nh   increases  the  rate 
of  predation,  pNhNp,  also  increases.  Consequently,  in  the 
Lotka-Volterra model, reproduction by the host is translated

immediately into destruction of hosts by the predator. In addi-
tion,  increased  predation,  pNhNp,  is  translated  directly  and 
immediately into more predators by cpNhNp. Increased num-
bers of predators increase the rate of predation since increas-
ing  Np  increases  pNhNp.  Growth  of  the  predator  population 
eventually reduces the host population, which in turn leads to 
declines in the predator population. So, like the host, predator 
success carries the seeds of its own destruction. 

 These  reciprocal  effects  of  prey  (host)  and  predator  pro-
duce oscillations in the two populations, which we can represent 
in two ways graphically. In  figure 14.17  a,  population oscilla-
tions are presented as we looked at them in snowshoe hare and 
lynx populations (see  fig. 14.14 ), while  figure 14.17 b   gives an 
alternative  representation.  The  time  axis  has  been  eliminated 
and  the  two  remaining  axes  represent  the  numbers  of  preda-
tors and prey. When we plot population data in this way, we see 
that the Lotka-Volterra model produces oscillations in predator 
and prey populations that follow an elliptical path, whose size 
depends upon the initial sizes of prey and predator populations. 
Whatever the ellipse size, however, the prey and predator popu-
lations just go round and round on the same path forever.     

 The prediction of eternal oscillations on a very narrowly 
defined  path  is  obviously  unrealistic.  Another  unrealistic 
assumption is that neither the prey nor the predator populations 

The Lotka-Volterra predator-prey 
model produces reciprocal oscillations 
in predator and prey populations.

are subject to carrying capacities. Another is that changes in 
either population are instantaneously translated into responses 
in the other population. Despite these unrealistic assumptions, 
Lotka and Volterra made valuable contributions to our under-
standing  of  predator-prey  systems.  They  showed  that  simple 
models  with  a  minimum  of  assumptions  produce  reciprocal 
cycles in populations of predator and prey analogous to those 
that biologists had observed in natural populations. They dem-
onstrated  that  predator-prey  interactions  themselves  can,  in 
theory, produce population cycles without any influences from 
an outside force such as climatic variation. Later refinements 
of the Lotka-Volterra model generate predictions and behave in 
ways more consistent with natural predator-prey systems. (The 
Lotka-Volterra equations can also be used to model parasite-
host, pathogen-host, or parasitoid-host populations.)  

  Laboratory Models 
 One  of  the  most  successful  attempts  to  produce  Lotka-
Volterra-type  population  cycles  in  the  laboratory  was  that 
of  Syunro  Utida  (1957)  of  Kyoto  University,  Japan.  Utida 
studied interactions between the adzuki bean weevil,  Callo-
sobruchus  chinensis,   and  a  hymenopteran  parasitoid  wasp, 
 Heterospilus  prosopidis,   which  attacks  the  bean  weevil. 
Adult weevils lay their eggs on adzuki beans,  Paseolus angu-
laris,   and  upon  hatching  the  larvae  feed  on  the  beans  until

they metamorphose into pupae. When they emerge from the 
pupal stage, the adult weevils mate and seek out new beans on 
which to lay their eggs. The entire life cycle, from egg to egg, 
takes approximately 20 days. While the weevil works at com-
pleting its life cycle, the parasitoid wasp searches for weevil 
larvae and pupae, where they lay their eggs. The larvae of the 
wasps feed on the larvae and pupae of the weevils and, in the 
process, kill them. Though the details of their behavior differ, 
the wasps are predators of the weevils, no less than are lynx 
predators of snowshoe hares. 

 Utida’s  experimental  populations  lived  in  petri  dishes 
1.8  cm  tall  by  8.5  cm  in  diameter  where  temperature  was 
maintained at a constant 30 8 C and relative humidity at 75%. 
Within the petri dishes Utida placed 10 g of adzuki beans with 
a water content of 15% and added a mixture of adult adzuki 
bean  weevils  and  parasitoid  wasps:  either  64  weevils  and 
8 wasps (population A), 8 weevils and 8 wasps ( population C), 
or 512 weevils and 128 wasps (population E). Every 10 days 
10 g of fresh beans were added, and the leavings of the old 
beans were placed in another dish. Any beetles moved with 
the spent food were recorded over a period of 20 days. 

 Utida  followed  population  C  for  47  beetle  generations, 
approximately  940  days,  after  which  a  mistake  in  handling 
killed the population. He followed population E for 82 gen-
erations,  approximately  1,640  days,  after  which  the  weevils 
died out. Population A was followed the longest, 112 genera-
tions, over 6 years, after which the population was acciden-
tally destroyed. It was only by following the beetle and wasp 
populations  for  so  many  generations  that  Utida  was  able  to 
see the pattern we look at now. 

 All three of the experimental populations showed the same 
cyclic  behavior  ( fig.  14.18 ).  For  several  generations  Utida 
observed  reciprocal  fluctuations  in  his  beetle  and  parasitoid 
populations that look very similar to those we saw for lynx and 
hare populations (see  fig. 14.14 ). After an initial phase of high-
magnitude oscillations, the population cycles were decreased 
in  amplitude,  remained  in  a  situation  of  low-amplitude  fluc-
tuations for some time, and then increased in amplitude once 
again. In population A, high-amplitude cycles continued for the 
first 20 generations, dampened out until about generation 30, 
and then resumed high-amplitude cycling until about genera-
tion 54, when the oscillations dampened out once again.   

 Utida’s results are analogous to the patterns of reciprocal 
fluctuation seen in the Lotka-Volterra model along with some 
behavior not predicted by the mathematical model. However, 
despite these differences, like the Lotka-Volterra model, Uti-
da’s laboratory model shows that parasitoid-host populations 
can show reciprocal oscillations without significant temporal 
variation in the physical environment. 

 G. Gause (1935) produced similar results when he stud-
ied  a  laboratory  population  of   Paramecium  aurelia   preying 
upon yeast. He followed the populations through three cycles, 
which took only 20 days. Though Gause’s experiments were 
much  shorter  than  Utida’s,  they  also  produced  oscillations 
like those predicted by the Lotka-Volterra model. 

 Utida’s  and  Gause’s  successes  make  work  with  labo-
ratory  models  look  far  easier  than  it  is.  Most  attempts  to 

These laboratory populations showed 
reciprocal oscillations of host and 
parasitoid numbers that continued for 
112 generations, or 6 years.

lations have failed. Most laboratory experiments have led to 
extinction of the predator or prey population in a fairly short 
period of time. To sustain oscillations even for a short period, 
researchers have generally had to provide the prey with ref-
uges  of  some  sort,  which  indicates  another  generalization 
about natural predator-prey systems. 

  Concept 14.3 Review 

      1.   When the coupled cycling of lynx and snowshoe hare 
populations  (see   fig.  14.14 )  was  first  described,  many 
concluded that lynx control snowshoe hare populations. 
Why are lynx not the primary factor controlling snow-
shoe  hare  populations  even  though  their  population 
cycles are highly correlated?  

     2.   Why is it not surprising that snowshoe hare populations 
are  controlled  by  a  combination  of  factors,  food  and 
predators (see  fig. 14.15 ), and not by a single environ-
mental factor?  

     3.   Both mathematical and laboratory models offer valuable 
insights into the dynamics of predator-prey systems. What 
are some advantages and limitations of each approach?

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 14.15  List the variety of “refuges” utilized by prey.
 14.16  Explain how the laboratory studies of Gause and 

Huffaker shed light on the importance of refuges to 
prey survival in the face of predation.

 14.17  Design an experiment to test the effectiveness of 

large numbers as a form of refuge, emphasizing the 
role of predator satiation. (You do not have to use 
live prey.)

 14.18  Discuss the ecology of fear as a way of creating 

refuges for some species.

   To persist in the face of exploitation, hosts and prey need 
refuges.   This section is about  refuges,  situations in which 
members  of  an  exploited  population  have  some  protection 
from predators and parasites. When we think of refuges, we 
generally think of an inaccessible place. There are, however, 
many other kinds of refuges. Many have nothing to do with 
places  and  most  do  not  provide  complete  security—just 
enough.  

   Refuges and Host Persistence in Laboratory 
and Mathematical Models 
 Gause’s  success  at  producing  cycles  in  populations  of 
Paramecium  aurelia   and  its  prey,   Saccharomyces  exiguus,
gives no hint of the difficulties he experienced in his earlier 
attempts.  Gause’s  first  attempts  to  produce  Lotka-Volterra 
population cycles involved  Paramecium caudatum  and one 
of its predators, another aquatic protozoan called  Didinium 
nasutum.   If  Gause  grew  these  organisms  in  a  simple  lab-
oratory  microcosm,   Didinium   quickly  consumed  all  the 
 Paramecium   ( fig.  14.19 ).  The  absence  of  a  refuge  for  the 
prey led eventually to extinction of both predator and prey 
populations. Gause responded in subsequent experiments by 
putting  some  sediment  on  the  bottom  of  his  microcosm  to 
provide a refuge for  Paramecium.  In this case, once  Didin-
ium  had eaten all of the  Paramecium  not hiding in bottom 
sediments, it starved and became extinct. Following the dis-
appearance of  Didinium  and the removal of predation pres-
sure, the population of  Paramecium  quickly increased. Here, 
a simple refuge for the prey population led to extinction of 
the predator.     

 Gause was only able to maintain oscillations in predator-
prey  populations  if  he  periodically  restocked  the  popula-
tions  from  his  laboratory  cultures.  In  this  experiment,  the 
microcosm contained no refuges for  Paramecium,  but every 
3 days Gause would take one of each organism from his pure 
laboratory cultures and add them to the experimental micro-
cosm.  Using  these  periodic  immigrations  he  was  able  to 
produce  Lotka-Volterra-type  predator-prey  oscillations  (see 
 fig. 14.19 ). To do so, however, the experimental system had to 
include a refuge for the prey and a reservoir for the predator

In the absence of 
refuges and 
immigration, both 
prey and predator 
populations 
became extinct.

Adding a refuge 
allowed the prey 
population to persist 
but the predators 
still became extinct.

However, 
immigration from 
source populations 
maintained 
oscillations in 
predator-prey 
populations.

(the  laboratory  cultures),  and  Gause  had  to  create  periodic 
immigrations  from  those  populations  to  the  experimental 
microcosm. 

 Are  these  experimental  requirements  entirely  artificial 
or do they correspond with anything we already know about 
natural  populations?  Actually,  Gause’s  experimental  results 
match  many  of  our  observations  in  natural  populations.  In 
chapter  9,  we  saw  that  on  larger  scales  populations  show 
clumped distributions. Most species are much more common 
in some parts of their range than in others. Then in chapter 10, 
we  saw  how  dispersal  is  an  important  contributor  to  popu-
lation  dynamics  and  that  some  local  populations  are  main-
tained entirely by dispersal from other areas. Some biologists 
have combined observations such as these to hypothesize the 
existence of population sources and population sinks—local 
populations  maintained  by  immigration  from  source  popu-
lations. In Gause’s experiment, the laboratory cultures were 
population hot spots, or sources, while the microcosms where 
predator  and  prey  interacted  were  population  sinks.  The 
requirements  of  Gause’s  experiment  are  consistent  with  the 
results of later experiments. 

 C. Huffaker (1958) set out to test whether Gause’s results 
could be reproduced in a situation in which the predator and 
prey are responsible for their own immigration and emigra-
tion among patches of suitable habitat. Huffaker chose the six-
spotted mite,  Eotetranychus sexmaculatus,  a mite that feeds 
on oranges, as the prey and the predatory mite  Typhlodromus

occidentalis,  which attacks  E. sexmaculatus,  as the predator. 
Huffaker’s  experimental  setups,  or  “universes”  as  he  called 
them, consisted of various arrangements of oranges, or com-
binations  of  oranges  and  rubber  balls,  separated  by  partial 
barriers to mite dispersal consisting of discontinuous strips of 
petroleum jelly. 

 An  important  point  of  natural  history  is  that  the  preda-
tory mite had to crawl in order to disperse from one orange 
to another, while the herbivorous mite can disperse either by 
crawling  or  by  “ballooning,”  a  means  of  aerial  dispersal. A 
mite balloons by spinning a strand of silk that can catch wind 
currents.  Huffaker  gave  the  herbivorous  mite  the  chance  to 
balloon by providing small wooden posts that could serve as 
launching  pads  and  by  having  a  fan  circulate  air  across  his 
experimental setup. 

 While Huffaker’s simpler experimental universes did not 
produce  predator-prey  oscillations,  his  most  elaborate  setup 
of 120 oranges did. These oscillations spanned several months 
( fig. 14.20 ). Huffaker observed three oscillations that spanned 
about  6  months.  They  were  maintained  by  the  dispersal  of 
predator and prey among oranges in a deadly game of hide-
and-seek,  in  which  the  prey  managed  to  keep  ahead  of  the 
predator  for  three  full  oscillations. These  results  are   similar 
to  those  obtained  by  Gause,  but  we  need  to  remember  that 
Huffaker did not directly manipulate dispersal. In Huffaker’s 
experiment both predator and prey moved from patch to patch 
under their own power.   

A complex array of 120 
oranges with numerous barriers 
of petroleum jelly and about 
5% of the area of each orange 
exposed to attack by mites.

Within this complex array 
herbivorous mites and their 
predators produced three full 
population oscillations.

 Figure 14.20    Environmental complexity and oscillations in 
 laboratory populations of a herbivorous mite and a predatory mite 
(data from Huffaker 1958). 

 The  importance  of  refuges  was  recognized  by  Lotka 
(1932a)  and  incorporated  into  his  mathematical  theory  of 
predator-prey relations. The starting point for his discussion 
was  the  Lotka-Volterra  predator-prey  equations  that  we  dis-
cussed previously:

dNh 
____ 
  
dt

dNp 
____ 
dt

    5 rhNh 2 pNhNp and   

    5 cpNhNp 2 dpNp    

The part of this equation that provided the starting point for 
Lotka’s discussion was  p,  the capture or consumption rate of 
the predator. Lotka pointed out that while it may be  reasonable 
to  assume  that   p   is  a  constant  for  a  particular  environment, 
its value should change from one environment to another if 
the environments differ structurally, particularly if there is a 
 difference  in  the  availability  of  refuges  in  the  two  environ-
ments. Specifically,  p  should be lower where the prey or hosts 
have  access  to  more  refuges. This  refinement  of  the  Lotka-
Volterra  predator-prey  model  anticipated  recent  theoretical 
analysis of the role that refuges and spatial diversity, in gen-
eral, play in the persistence of predator-prey and parasite-host 
systems.  While  Lotka’s  analysis  concentrated  on  physical 
refuges  that  could  shelter  terrestrial  prey,  he  recognized  the 
wide variety of forms that refuges could take. He pointed out, 
for  instance,  that  flight  is  a  refuge  for  birds  from   terrestrial 
predators.  

  Exploited Organisms and Their Wide Variety 
of “Refuges” 
While Lotka’s analysis concentrated on physical refuges that 
could shelter terrestrial prey, he recognized the wide variety 
of forms that refuges could take. He pointed out, for instance, 
that  flight  is  a  refuge  for  birds  from  terrestrial  predators. 
Large  size  can  also  serve  as  a  type  of  refuge.  For  example, 
while young African elephants may be vulnerable to preda-
tion by lions, adult elephants are not. However, most of our 
discussion has focused on “spatial” refuges.

  Space 
 Many forms of spatial refuge are familiar: burrows, trees, air, 
water (if faced with terrestrial predators), and land (if faced 
with aquatic predators). However, some spatial refuges differ 
in subtle ways from other areas. 

 The  invasive  cactus   Opuntia  stricta,   which  had  com-
pletely covered vast areas of Australia, was eventually con-
trolled by a combination of an introduced herbivorous insect, 
 Cactoblastis cactorum,  and pathogenic microbes. The intro-
duction of the insects did not drive the cactus to extinction, 
however. One reason for the persistence of the cactus is that 
it has a number of spatial refuges. Small isolated cactus pop-
ulations are difficult for  Cactoblastis  to find. This is a spatial 
refuge much like that designed into Huffaker’s experimental 
arrangement of oranges. In addition, the insects do not vig-
orously  attack  the  cactus  where  it  grows  on  nutrient-poor 
soils and/or above 600 to 900 m elevation, due to low quality 
of the cactus tissues or low temperatures.

Section IV 

 

Interactions

 St. John’s wort,  Hypericum perforatum,  persists in simi-
lar  refuges  in  the  face  of  attacks  by  the  beetle   Chrysolina 
quadrigemina,  one of the chief enemies of  Hypericum  in the 
Pacific Northwest region of the United States.  Hypericum  was 
introduced into areas along the Klamath River around 1900, 
and its population quickly grew to cover about 800,000 ha by 
1944. Following the release of the beetles, the area covered by 
St. John’s wort was reduced to less than 1% of its maximum 
coverage. This remnant population of the plant was concen-
trated in shady habitats, where, though it grows more poorly 
than  in  sunny  areas,  it  is  protected  from  the  beetles,  which 
avoid shade.  

  Protection in Numbers 
 Living in a large group provides a type of refuge. Aside from 
the potential of social groups to intimidate would-be preda-
tors, numbers alone can reduce the probability of an individual 
prey or host being eaten. We can make this prediction based 
solely on the work of C. S. Holling (1959) on the responses 
of  predators  to  prey  density.  In  chapter  7  we  looked  at  the 
functional  responses  of  several  predators  and  herbivores. 
Briefly, predator functional response results in increasing rate 
of  food  intake  as  prey  density  increases.  Eventually,  how-
ever, the predator’s feeding rate levels off at some maximum 
rate. In chapter 10 we looked at numerical response, a second 
component  of  predator  response  to  prey  density  that  results 
in  increased  predator  density  as  prey  density  increases.  As 
with  functional  response,  the  numerical  response  eventually 
 levels off at the point where further increases in prey density 
no  longer produce increased predator density. 

 Now let’s put functional response and numerical response 
together  to  predict  the  predator’s     combined  response     to 
increased prey density. We can combine the two responses by 
multiplying the number of prey eaten per predator times the 
number of predators per unit area:

Combined functional and 
numerical responses result in 
an increasing percent 
consumption of prey at low to 
medium prey densities.

However, at higher 
densities the percentage 
of prey consumed 
declines with increased 
prey density.

suggests  that  prey  can  reduce  their  individual  probability  of 
being  eaten  by  occurring  at  very  high  densities.  It  appears 
that this defensive tactic, which is called     predator satiation,    
is employed by a wide variety of organisms from insects and 
plants to marine invertebrates and  African antelope. Nowhere 
is predator satiation more apparent than among the periodical 
cicades of North America (fig. 14.22).   

  The Ecology of Fear and Refuges  
When  considering  the  effects  of  predators  on  prey  popu-
lations,  we  generally  focus  on  lethal  effects—that  is,  on 
predators  killing  their  prey.  However,  as  William  Ripple 
and Robert Beschta (Ripple and Beschta 2004, 2008) point 
out, predators can also influence prey populations by alter-
ing  their  behavior.  Such  behavioral  effects  of  predators

Area

By dividing the prey consumed per unit area by the popula-
tion density of the prey (prey consumed/area), we can deter-
mine the percentage of the prey population consumed by the 
predator. If we plot percentage of the prey consumed against 
prey density over a broad range of prey densities, the predic-
tion is that the percentage of the prey population consumed 
will be lower at high prey densities ( fig. 14.21 ).     

 Why should the percentage of the prey consumed by the 
predator  decline  at  high  prey  densities?  The  answer  to  this 
question, which may not be obvious at first, lies in the predator 
functional and numerical responses. We see this effect because 
both numerical and functional responses level off at intermedi-
ate prey densities; that is, beyond a certain threshold, further 
increases in prey density do not lead to either higher predator 
densities or increased feeding rates. Meanwhile, the density of 
the prey population continues to increase and the proportion 
of the prey eaten by predators declines. This work by Holling

lates into a biomass of 1,900 to 3,700 kg of cicadas per ha, the highest 
biomass of a natural population of terrestrial animals ever recorded.

on  prey  populations,  which  have  been  broadly  referred  to 
as  “the  ecology  of  fear,”  are  the  result  of  prey  avoiding 
high-risk  situations.  Ripple  and  Beschta  have  been  study-
ing  the  ecological  consequences  of  the  reintroduction  of 
gray wolves,  Canis lupus,  to Yellowstone National Park in 
1995–1996 ( fig. 14.23 a  ) and report that as wolf populations 
have increased, one of their major prey species, elk,   Cervus 
elaphus   ( fig.  14.23 b  ) ,   has  altered  its  distribution.  Most 
significantly,  elk  have  reduced  their  use  of  riparian  areas, 
where they may be more vulnerable to hunting wolf packs. 
As a consequence, wolves have created a refuge for some 
of the elk’s main food sources, especially riparian tree pop-
ulations  ( fig.  14.23 c  ),  particularly  willow,  which  are  now 
showing  renewed  growth  in  these  refuges,  maintained  not 
by physical barriers, but by fear.     

 How much wolves have influenced the observed recov-
ery  of  riparian  vegetation  in  Yellowstone  is  the  focus  of 
recent debate (e.g., Kauffman, Brodie, and Jules 2010, 2013; 
Beschta and Ripple 2013). However, the role of wolves and 
other  predators  in  altering  the  use  of  space  by  their  prey  is 
well  documented  across  a  wide  range  of  other  ecosystems 
(Laundré 2010; Latombe, Fortin, and Parrott 2014).

appropriate.

Models incorporating the ratio of prey to predator num-
bers better predict predator functional responses in many 
ecological  circumstances.  The  classical  Lotka-Volterra 
predator-prey  model  (see  fig.  14.16)  has  stimulated  a  vast 
amount  of  research  since  its  publication  in  the  early  twen-
tieth century. The utility of this model results partly from its 
simplicity.  However,  as  pointed  out  earlier,  that  simplicity 
includes  some  biologically  unrealistic  assumptions.  One  of

those assumptions is that the rate at which an individual preda-
tor consumes prey is determined solely by prey abundance. In 
this model, the size of the predator population has no effect on 
feeding rate by individual predators, whether the predator pop-
ulation is small or very large. Another assumption is that the 
conversion of prey to predator offspring is instantaneous, when, 
in fact, there can be substantial delays particularly among large 
predators with seasonal reproduction. Although these assump-
tions may be justified where predator population densities are 
very low or for micro-predators with fast life cycles, alternative 
models may be more appropriate in other systems.

Alternative Model for Trophic Ecology
Recognizing  the  shortcomings  of  the  Lotka-Volterra  model, 
Roger Arditi, now at the Sorbonne University in Paris and Lev 
Ginzburg,  of  Stony  Brook  University,  proposed  an  alternative 
approach (Arditi and Ginzburg 1989). The core of that pioneering 
work focused on the functional response of predators, which we 
explored graphically in chapter 7 (see figs. 7.22 and 7.23). Those 
figures in chapter 7 project the assumption that rates of consump-
tion by a predator are strictly a function of prey abundance:

g 5 g(N)

where g is the predator’s functional response, that is, its rate of 
prey consumption. In this model, functional response is deter-
mined only by the abundance of the prey, N. As a result, Arditi 
and Ginzburg referred to this type of model as prey-dependent 
functional response. A commonly used prey-dependent func-
tional response model was proposed by C. S. Holling (1959b), 
which, following the notation of Arditi and Ginzburg (2012) is:

g(N) 5   

aN

________ 
 
1 1 ahN

  

Here, the rate at which prey are consumed by a predator, g, 
depends on a, the searching efficiency; h, the handling time 
for  a  particular  type  of  prey;  and  N,  the  abundance  of  prey 
in the environment. This functional response is the result of 
predator  feeding  behavior  as  predators  search  for,  capture, 
and handle prey. In this model, the rate of prey consumption 
increases with prey density, eventually leveling off at higher 
prey  densities  where  consumption  rate  is  limited  by  how 
quickly a predator can capture and handle prey (fig. 14.24a).

Arditi  and  Ginzburg  proposed  that  a  functional  response 
model  based  entirely  on  predatory  behavior  by  individual 
predators  will  not  accurately  predict  rates  of  consumption  in 
many—perhaps  most—circumstances  in  nature.  In  particular, 
they were concerned that the number of predators in the environ-
ment can influence feeding rates in the predator population. For 
example, variation in predator population density may influence 
the l ikelihood of interference among predators. While predator 
interference  would  be  highly  unlikely  at  very  low  population 
densities, higher predator densities may well be accompanied by 
interference.  Consequently,  they  proposed  an  alternative  func-
tional response model based on the per capita availability of prey:

dependent model of

In the Arditi-Ginzburg model, a is not searching time, as in 
the Holling model, but the rate at which prey become available 
to the predator population, by whatever mechanism, while h is 
the handling time, just as in the Holling prey-dependent model. 
The  main  distinction  of  this  model  is  that  the  rate  of  prey 
consumption,  that  is,  the  functional  response,  is  determined 
by the ratio of prey numbers, N , to predator numbers, P—in 
other words, the per capita availability of prey (fig. 14.24b). A 
growing body of evidence supports the Arditi-Ginzburg model 
of ratio-dependent functional response.

Evidence for Ratio-Dependent Predation
In their 1989 paper, Arditi and Ginzburg extracted data from a 
study of predatory interactions between the Atlantic oyster drill, 
Urosalpinx cinerea, a predaceous snail, and its prey, the acorn 
barnacle,  Balanus  balanoides  (now  Semibalanus balanoides) 
(Katz 1985). In one set of field experiments, the author of that 
study,  Clifford  Katz  of  the  University  of  Connecticut,  varied 
both the density of the prey, acorn barnacles, and the density 
of the predator, Atlantic oyster drills. Consequently, the results 
of  this  experiment  provide  a  basis  for  evaluating  the  relative 
effectiveness  of  prey-dependent  versus  the  ratio-dependent 
models of functional response. When Katz analyzed the results 
of this experiment, he found that both prey density and predator 
density contributed significantly to feeding rates by the Atlan-
tic oyster drill. In their evaluation of the same data, Arditi and 
Ginzburg plotted feeding rate by the predator against two dif-
ferent independent variables: prey population density, N, or the 
ratio of prey numbers to predator numbers, N/P. The result of 
this graphing exercise clearly supports a ratio-dependent func-
tional response by the Atlantic oyster drill (fig. 14.25). 

The  two  and  a  half  decades  since  the  1989  publica-
tion  of  the Arditi-Ginzburg  ratio-dependent  model  has  been 
marked  by  controversy  and  discussion  between  supporters

of  the  traditional  prey-dependent  models  and  those  favor-
ing a ratio-dependent approach. As this discussion unfolded, 
evidence  in  support  of  the  ratio-dependent  Arditi-Ginzburg 
model increased, as a result of studies involving a wide diver-
sity of terrestrial and aquatic predators and prey. Some of the 
strongest support has come from studies of wolf and moose 
interactions  on  Isle  Royale,  a  544  km2  U.S.  National  Park 
(fig. 14.26). Moose colonized and established themselves on 
the island, which is located 24 km from the northern shore of 
Lake Superior, in the early twentieth century. Wolves arrived 
decades later in the 1940s. While wolves elsewhere generally 
feed on several species of prey, moose account for over 90% 
of  the  diets  of  Isle  Royale  wolves.  This  concentration  on  a 
single prey species combined with a near lack of immigration 

or emigration by either wolves or moose, makes Isle Royale 
an ideal natural laboratory for studying interactions between 
a  large  mammalian  predator  and  its  prey.  Only  one  wolf,  a 
lone male from Canada, is known to have immigrated to Isle 
Royale in 1997.

Systematic  study  of  interactions  between  moose  and 
wolves on Isle Royale began in 1958, with the founding of the 
Isle  Royale  moose-wolf  project.  Researchers  have  collected 
mountains of data since then, including, critically for the pur-
poses of this discussion, the number of moose and wolves on 
the island and the number of moose kills. Huge numbers of 
people, from paid professional researchers to volunteers, have 
been  needed  to  sustain  this  long-term,  large-scale  research 
project.  However,  since  the  1970s  Rolf  Peterson  and  John

Interactions

Based on increasing evidence in support of ratio- dependent 
models of functional response, Arditi and Ginzburg (2012) pro-
posed that such models become the standard view of predator-
prey interactions. They argue that such models are particularly 
appropriate  for  larger  scale  studies  of  larger  organisms  with 
slower life cycles. At the same time, they are careful to point out 
that prey-dependent models work well for accounting for feeding 
rates that are mainly the result of short-term predator behavior.

While we may think of predators as threats to ourselves 
or  to  livestock  or  crops,  many  predators  and  parasites  have 
been used to control populations of insects that attack crops or 
to control invasive weeds. As we shall see in the Applications 
section, the value of predators in management of agricultural 
pests is increasingly recognized.

 Figure 14.26   A wolf pack pursuing a moose across the winter 
landscape of Isle Royale National Park. Intensively studied for more 
than half a century, the interactions between wolves and moose on Isle 
Royale have become a model case study of predator-prey interactions. 

Concept 14.5 Review

Vucetich of Michigan Tech University have been at the cen-
ter of the Isle Royale moose–wolf project team. Significantly, 
comparative studies that they coauthored have verified that the 
Arditi-Ginzburg ratio-dependent model of functional response 
best accounts for variation in feeding rates by wolves preying 
on moose on Isle Royale, particularly at the scale of the whole 
island (Vucetich et al. 2002, Jost et al. 2005). A small sample 
of the data generated by the project is shown in figure 14.27, a 
scatter diagram of monthly wolf kill rates for a 41-year period 
against the ratio of moose to wolf numbers.

  1.  Why  do  the  points  representing  feeding  rates  by  one 
predator  in  figure  14.25  appear  in  exactly  the  same 
locations in the upper and lower panels, while the other 
points  representing  feeding  rates  for  two,  three,  and 
four  predators  do  not?  Do  these  differences  suggest 
hypotheses for where a prey-dependent model of func-
tional response may be appropriate?

  2.  What qualities of the Isle Royale moose-wolf interac-
tion make it ideal for the study of predator functional 
responses in nature? What are some of the major diffi-
culties associated with effectively studying this system?

Ongoing studies have shown that
variations in wolf feeding rates on Isle
Royal, such as these, are best
accounted for by the Arditi-Ginzburg
ratio-dependent model of functional
response.

  The Value of Pest Control by Bats: 

A Case Study 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 14.22  Outline the methods used to study the economic 

benefit of Brazilian free-tailed bats in the control of 
cotton bollworm in southwest Texas.

 14.23  Summarize the economic benefits of bats, resulting 

from their eating of insects.

 14.24  Explain why the economic benefit of bats to agri-

culture will usually vary from year to year.

 We  saw  earlier  in  the  chapter  that  bats  reduce  the  popula-
tion  density  of  arthropods  living  on  foliage  in  a  lowland 
tropical forest (see  fig 14.10 , p. 311). In the same study, the 
researchers found that plants from which bats were excluded 
not  only  supported  higher  densities  of  arthropods  but  also 
suffered over three times the amount of herbivore damage to 
leaves compared to plants to which bats had access (Kalka, 
Smith,  and  Kalko  2008).  Arthropods  of  many  kinds  also 
attack crop plants and reduce agricultural yields. In defense 
of their crops, farmers spend billions of dollars annually to 
control insect pests. Can bats be valuable allies to farmers in 
their attempts to protect crops? Research in a tropical coffee 
plantation  suggests  so.  Kimberly  Williams-Guillén,  Ivette 
Perfecto, and John Vandermeer (2008) discovered that bats 
limit arthropod numbers in a coffee plantation in an area of 
Mexico that would naturally support tropical dry forest (see 
chapter 2, p. 21). Where the researchers excluded bats dur-
ing the wet season, arthropod densities on coffee plants were 
84% higher. 

 If  bats  provide  some  protection  to  crops  from  insect 
pests,  how  much  might  their  pest  control  services  be 
worth?  This  is  the  question  addressed  by  a  team  of  U.S. 
and Mexican researchers working in an eight county region 
in  southwest  Texas  (Cleveland  et  al.  2006).  The  agricul-
tural production of the area includes 10,000 acres of cotton 
with  an  annual  value  of  $4.6  to  $6.4  million. The  area  is 
also  home  to  Brazilian  free-tailed  bats,   Tadarida    brasil-
iensis,  which emerge from their roosts in caves and under 
bridges in spectacular  feeding flights ( fig. 14.28a ). During 
a given night in the growing season, over 100 million Bra-
zilian free-tailed bats may be feeding on flying insects over 
south-central Texas. These are mostly female bats living in 
maternity colonies, where they give birth, generally to a sin-
gle pup, and raise their young. Lactating female  Brazilian 
free-tailed bats rear their pups to essentially adult size in 
6  to  7  weeks.  Consequently,  they  face  enormous  energy 
demands  and,  in  response,  a  lactating  female  Brazilian 
free-tailed bat ingests up to two-thirds of its body weight

in flying insects each night (Kunz, Whitaker, and  Wadanoli 
1995), including an abundance of moths ( fig. 14.28b ). One 
of  the  moths  commonly  found  in  the  diets  of  Brazilian 
free-tailed bats in south-central Texas is  Helicoverpa   zea.  
Though it feeds on a wide range of plants, the caterpillar 
of  H.   zea  is known as the cotton, or corn, bollworm, as a 
result  of  its  attacks  on  these  two  economically  important 
crop plants. In fact, the cotton bollworm is one of the most 
serious agricultural pests in the Americas, causing billions 
of dollars in damage to crops annually (Mitter, Poole, and 
Matthews 1993).     

 With millions of bats emerging from their roost sites, 
 flying  at  speeds  of  up  to  40  km  per  hour,  and  covering 
distances  that  may  exceed  100  km  per  night,  how  can  an 
ecologist,  or  even  a  team  of  ecologists,  keep  track?  One 
of the ways that the Cleveland team followed bats as they

 Figure 14.29   NEXRAD (NEXt generation RADar) Doppler radar is providing useful information on the foraging activities of Brazilian

and Austin, Texas. The emerging bats appear as irregular patches of green and blue. In the image, cave colonies are marked as circles, bridge

left  and  returned  to  their  roost  sites  was  with  NEXRAD 
(NEXt  generation RADar) Doppler radar ( fig. 14.29 ). The 
radar  images  gave  researchers  an  indication  of  the  direc-
tion  in  which  bats  left  their  roosts  to  feed  and  the  direc-
tion  from  which  they  returned.  Both  sets  of  directional 
data indicated that the bats were foraging over the agricul-
tural fields in their study area. To supplement radar track-
ing,  researchers  observed  bats  from  the  ground  to  verify 
that  they  are  feeding  over  agricultural  fields  at  the  time 
when  cotton  bollworm  moths  were  emerging  and  flying 
in  large  numbers  at  elevations  from  200  to  1,200  m  over 
the  fields.  Based  on  historic  estimates  of  numbers  in  the 
study  area  and  recent  census  data,  Cleveland  and  his  col-
leagues estimated that 1.5 million Brazilian free-tailed bats 
were feeding over the agricultural fields in their study area 
each night.     

 The study team assigned a value to pest control by Bra-
zilian  free-tailed  bats  in  the  study  area  using  an  avoided-
cost  approach.  Their  analysis  involved  two  costs.  The  first 
avoided cost was the value of the cotton crop that would have 
been  lost  without  bat  pest  control.  The  second  part  of  the 

calculation incorporated the cost of pesticides that were not 
applied due to pest control by bats. Based on a long series of 
calculations,  Cleveland’s  research  team  estimated  that  each 
Brazilian free-tailed bat consumes an average of 1.5 female 
bollworm  moths  each  night,  which  would  have  otherwise 
gone  on  to  deposit  eggs  on  a  cotton  plant.  Although  each 
female lays 600 to 1,000 eggs, survivorship among caterpil-
lars  is  low  as  a  result  of  losses  to  predators,  such  as  ants, 
parasites,  and  pathogens. Taking  these  sources  of  mortality 
into  account,  the  researchers  estimated  that  an  individual 
feeding rate by Brazilian free-tailed bats of 1.5 female moths 
per night would result in 5 fewer caterpillars damaging cot-
ton plants, which would, in turn, reduce the number of dam-
aged cotton bolls by 10 per night. By limiting the numbers of 
bollworms on the cotton crop, the Brazilian free-tailed bats 
would also delay the bollworm population reaching the den-
sity threshold at which farmers apply pesticides, resulting in 
the second avoided cost. 

 Using  the  avoided-cost  approach,  Cleveland’s  research 
team estimated that, during their study, the value of pest con-
trol by Brazilian free-tailed bats on their southwest Texas study

area was $741,000. They realized, however, that the value of 
this  pest  control  would  differ  across  years  ( fig.  14.30 ):  less 
valuable in years when cotton bollworm eggs and larvae had 
low  survival,  $121,000;  and  more  valuable  in  high-survival 
years, $1,725,000. Let’s put these numbers in context. Con-
sider that the study by Cleveland and his colleagues assigned 
a value to a single predator, Brazilian free-tailed bats, feed-
ing on a single agricultural pest, the cotton bollworm moths, 
relative to its impact on one crop, cotton, in a relatively small 
geographic area. How valuable are the pest control services of 
the other 41 species of insectivorous bats living in the United 
States  across  the  entire  country? A  recent  estimate  of  their 
value  by  Justin  Boyle,  Paul  Cryan,  Gary  McCracken,  and 
Thomas Kunz (2011) estimated the value of those services at 
$22.9 billion annually. However, even this estimated value is 
highly  limited  geographically  and  taxonomically,  since  it  is 
for bats only. How valuable are the services of  all  the preda-
tors, parasites, and pathogens of agricultural pests, not just in 
the United States, but globally? No one knows but, undoubt-
edly, the value would be astronomical, a fact that is increas-
ingly recognized.           

The estimated value of bat predation
over the study area ranged from
$121,000 to $1,725,00.

   Summary 

 The diversity of interactions between herbivores and plants, 
between predators and prey, and between parasites, parasit-
oids,  pathogens,  and  hosts  can  be  grouped  under  the  head-
ing of  exploitative interactions —interactions between species 
that  enhance  the  fitness  of  one  individual  at  the  expense  of 
another. 

  Exploitative interactions weave populations into a web 
of relationships that defy easy generalization.   The num-
ber of exploitative interactions between species far exceeds the 
number of species in the biosphere, and the nature of exploita-
tion goes far beyond the typical consumption of one organ-
ism by another. For instance, many parasites and pathogens 
manipulate host behavior to enhance their own fitness at the 
expense of the host. Spiny-headed worms alter the behavior of 
a variety of crustacean hosts in a way that increases the prob-
ability that the one host species will be eaten by another. A 
pathogenic fungus manipulates the growth program of its host 
plant in a way to produce “pseudoflowers,” structures aimed 
at promoting the reproduction of the pathogen. In the process, 
the pathogen usually kills the host plant and always renders it 
sterile. Predation by one flour beetle species on another can 
be used as a potent means of interference competition except 
in the presence of a protozoan parasite, which seems to give a 
competitive advantage to less predaceous species. 

  Predators,  parasites,  and  pathogens  influence  the 
distribution,  abundance,  and  structure  of  prey  and  host 
populations.   Herbivorous stream insects have been shown 
to  control  the  density  of  their  algal  and  bacterial  food. An 
experimental  study  in  Panama  showed  that  both  birds  and 
bats reduce foliage-living arthropods significantly in lowland 
tropical forests, with bats having the larger effect. A parasitic 
infestation reduced the red fox population in Sweden by 70%, 
which in turn led to increases in the abundance of several prey 
species  eaten  by  foxes.  This  parasitic  disease  revealed  the 
influence of a predator on its prey populations. 

  Predator-prey,  parasite-host,  and  host-pathogen  rela-
tionships  are  dynamic.   Populations  of  a  wide  variety  of 
predators and prey show highly dynamic fluctuations in abun-
dance ranging from days to decades. A particularly well- studied 
example of predator-prey cycles is that of snowshoe hares and 
their predators, which have been shown to result from the com-
bined  effects  of  the  snowshoe  hares  on  their  food  and  of  the 
predators on the snowshoe hare population. Mathematical mod-
els of predator-prey interactions by Lotka and Volterra suggest 
that  exploitative  interactions  themselves  can  produce  popula-
tion cycles without any influences from outside forces such as 
weather. Predator-prey cycles have also been observed in a few 
laboratory populations under restricted circumstances. 

330 

Section IV 

 

Interactions

  To  persist  in  the  face  of  exploitation,  hosts  and  prey 
need  refuges.   The  refuges  that  promote  the  persistence  of 
hosts and prey include secure places to which the exploiter has 
limited access. However, living in large groups can be consid-
ered as a kind of refuge, since it reduces the probability that 
an individual host or prey will be attacked. Growing to large 
size can also represent a kind of refuge when the prey species 
is faced by size-selective predators. Fear of predators can alter 
the distribution of herbivores creating a refuge plant as a result.
 The  Lotka-Volterra  predator-prey  model  assumes  that  the 
rate at which an individual predator consumes prey is determined 
solely by prey abundance. In this model, the size of the preda-
tor population has no effect on feeding rate by individual preda-
tors.  In  contrast,  the  Arditi-Ginzburg,  ratio- dependent  model 

proposes that both predator and prey abundance can influence 
predator functional response. A growing body of evidence indi-
cates that this alternative model is particularly appropriate for 
larger scale studies of larger organisms with slower life cycles.  
 Bats can be valuable allies to farmers in their attempts to 
protect  crops  from  arthropod  pests.  For  example,  exclosure 
experiments in a coffee plantation in Mexico showed that bats 
reduce arthropod population density on coffee plants. Mean-
while, Brazilian free-tailed bats appear to help significantly in 
the control of cotton bollworm in southwestern Texas, with the 
value of this control ranging from $121,000 to $1.7 million, 
depending on the level of survival by cotton bollworm eggs 
and  larvae.  Pest  control  by  insectivorous  bats  in  the  United 
States was estimated in 2011 at nearly $23 billion annually.

  Review Questions 

     1.  Predation is one of the processes by which one organism exploits 
another. Others are herbivory, parasitism, and disease. What dis-
tinguishes each of these processes, including predation, from the 
others?  We  can  justify  discussing  these  varied  processes  under 
the heading of exploitative interactions because each involves one 
organism  making  its  living  at  the  expense  of  another.  By  what 
“currency” would you measure that expense (e.g., energy, fitness)?  
    2.  How are manipulation of host behavior by spiny-headed worms 
and manipulation of plant growth by the rust  Puccinia monoica  
the same? How are they different? The details of these parasitic 
interactions are very different in many ways from the predatory 
behavior of lions on the savannas of Africa. How are the activi-
ties of spiny-headed worms, rusts, and lions similar?  

    3.  Predation by one flour beetle species on another can be used as a 
potent means of interference competition. However, the predatory 
strategy seems to fail consistently in the presence of the proto-
zoan parasite  Adelina tribolii.  Explain how the predatory strategy 
works in one environmental circumstance and fails in another.  

    4.  In chapter 14 we have seen how a herbivorous stream insect con-
trols the density of its food organisms, how a herbivorous moth 
larva and pathogenic microbes combine to control an introduced 
cactus population, and how decimation of a red fox population led 
to increases in the populations of the foxes’ prey. We do not know 
the specific environmental factors controlling most populations. 
Explain why such factors must exist. (Hint: Think back to our dis-
cussions of geometric and exponential growth in chapter 11.)  

    5.  Early  work  on  exploitation  focused  a  great  deal  of  attention 
on  predator-prey  relations.  However,  parasites  and  pathogens 
represent a substantial part of the discussions in chapter 14. Is 
this  representation  by  parasites  and  pathogens  just  the  result 
of biased choices by the author or do you think that parasites 

and pathogens have the potential to exert significant controls on 
natural populations? Justify your answer.  

    6.  Researchers  have  suggested  that  predators  could  actually 
increase  the  population  density  of  a  prey  species  heavily 
infected by a pathogenic parasite (Hudson, Dobson, and New-
born  1992).  Explain  how  predation  could  lead  to  population 
increases in the prey population.  

    7.  Explain  the  roles  of  food  and  predators  in  producing  cycles  of 
abundance in populations of snowshoe hare. Populations of many 
of the predators that feed on snowshoe hares also cycle substan-
tially. Explain population cycles among these predator populations.  
    8.  What  contributions  have  laboratory  and  mathematical  models 
made to our understanding of predator-prey population cycles? 
What  are  the  shortcomings  of  these  modeling  approaches? 
What are their advantages?  

    9.  We included spatial refuges, predator satiation, and size in our 
discussions of the role played by refuges in the persistence of 
exploited  species.  How  could  time  act  as  a  refuge?  Explain 
how  natural  selection  could  lead  to  the  evolution  of  temporal 
“refuges.” 

 10.   Joseph  Culp  and  Gary  Scrimgeour  (1993)  studied  the  timing 
of feeding by mayfly larvae in streams with and without fish. 
These  mayflies  feed  by  grazing  on  the  exposed  surfaces  of 
stones, where they are vulnerable to predation by fish, which in 
the streams studied are size-selective feeders and feed predomi-
nantly  during  the  day.  In  the  study  streams  without  fish,  both 
small and large mayflies have a slight tendency to feed during 
the day but feed at all hours of the day and night. In the streams 
with abundant fish populations, small mayflies fed around the 
clock, while large mayflies fed mainly at night. Explain these 
patterns in terms of time as a refuge and size-selective predation.

 15.1  Distinguish between mutualism and commensalism.
 15.2  Describe the ecological consequences of facultative 

versus obligate mutualism.  

P ositive interactions between species are found through-

out  the  biosphere.  A  hummingbird  darts  among  the 
red blossoms of a plant growing at the edge of a forest 
glade. As it inserts its bill into a flower, hovering to sip nec-
tar, the hummingbird head brushes up against the anthers of 
the flower and picks up pollen ( fig. 15.1 ). This pollen will be 
deposited on the stigmas of other flowers as the hummingbird 
goes about gathering its meal of nectar. The hummingbird dis-
perses the plant’s pollen in trade for a meal of nectar.     

 Belowground we encounter another partnership. The roots 
of the hummingbird-pollinated plant are intimately connected 
with fungi in an association called  mycorrhizae.  The hyphae of 
the mycorrhizal fungi extend out from the roots, increasing the 
capacity of the plant to harvest nutrients from the environment.

Interactions

 Figure 15.1   A female ruby-throated hummingbird,  Archilocus 
colubris,  feeding from a scarlet beebalm flower,  Monarda didyma.  
Hummingbirds feeding on nectar transfer pollen from flower to flower.

In  exchange  for  the  nutrients,  the  plant  delivers  sugars  and 
other products of photosynthesis to its fungal partner. 

 Meanwhile,  back  aboveground,  a  deer  enters  the  forest 
glade  and  wanders  over  to  the  plant  recently  visited  by  the 
hummingbird. The deer systematically grazes it to the ground, 
lightly chews the plant material, and then swallows it. As the 
plant  material  enters  the  deer’s  stomach,  it  is  attacked  by  a 
variety  of  protozoans  and  bacteria.  These  microorganisms 
break down and release energy from compounds such as cel-
lulose,  which  the  deer’s  own  enzymatic  machinery  cannot 
handle. In return, the protozoans and bacteria receive a steady 
food supply from the feeding activities of the deer as well as a 
warm, moist place in which to live. 

 These are examples of     mutualism   —that is, interactions 
between  individuals  of  different  species  that  benefit  both 
partners.  In  some  cases,  an  interaction  between  two  species 
benefits one of them, while the other is neither benefited nor 
harmed.  We  call  such  an  interaction  a   commensalism  (see 
chapter 17, p. 376). Some species can live without their mutu-
alistic  partners  and  so  the  relationship  is  called      facultative 
mutualism.    Other species are so dependent upon the mutu-
alistic relationship that they cannot live in its absence. Such a 
relationship is an     obligate mutualism.    It is a curious fact that 
though  observers  of  nature  as  early  as Aristotle  recognized 
such mutualisms, mutualistic interactions have received much 
less attention from ecologists than have either competition or 
exploitation.  Does  this  lack  of  attention  reflect  the  rarity  of 
mutualism in nature? As you will see in this chapter, mutual-
ism is virtually everywhere. 

 Mutualism may be common, but is it important? Does it 
contribute substantially to the ecological integrity of the bio-
sphere?  The  answer  to  both  these  questions  is  yes.  Without 
mutualism  the  biosphere  would  be  entirely  different.  Let’s 
remove some of the more prominent mutualisms from the bio-
sphere and consider the consequences. An earth without mutu-
alism would lack reef-building corals as we know them. So we 
can erase the Great Barrier Reef, the largest biological structure 
on earth, from our hypothetical world. We can also eliminate 
all the coral atolls that dot the tropical oceans as well as all the 

fringing reefs. The deep oceans would have no bioluminescent 
fishes or invertebrates. In addition, the deep-sea oases of life 
associated with ocean floor hydrothermal vents (see chapter 7, 
p. 155) would be reduced to nonmutualistic microbial species. 
 On land, there would be no animal-pollinated plants: no 
orchids, no sunflowers, and no apples. The pollinators them-
selves  would  also  be  gone:  no  bumblebees,  no  humming-
birds,  and  no  monarch  butterflies.  Gone,  too,  would  be  all 
the herbivores that depend on animal-pollinated plants. With-
out  plant-animal  mutualisms,  tropical  rain  forests,  the  most 
diverse terrestrial biome on the planet, would be all but gone. 
Many wind-pollinated plants would remain. However, many 
of  these  species  would  also  be  significantly  affected,  since 
approximately  90%  of  all  plants  form  mycorrhizae.  Those 
plants capable of surviving without mycorrhizal fungi would 
likely be restricted to the most fertile soils. 

 Even if wind-pollinated, nonmycorrhizal plants remained 
on  our  hypothetical  world  there  would  be  no  vast  herds  of 
 African hoofed mammals, no horses, and no elephants, camels, 
or even rabbits or caterpillars. There would be few herbivores 
to  feed  on  the  remaining  plants,  since  herbivores  and  detriti-
vores depend upon microorganisms to gain access to the energy 
and nutrients contained in plant tissues. The carnivores would 
disappear along with the herbivores. And so it would go. A bio-
sphere without mutualism would be biologically impoverished. 
 The impoverishment that would follow the elimination of 
mutualism, however, would go deeper than we might expect. 
Lynn Margulis and colleagues (Margulis and Fester 1991; Mar-
gulis  et  al.  2006) have amassed convincing evidence that all 
eukaryotes, both heterotrophic and autotrophic, originated as 
mutualistic associations between different organisms. Eukary-
otes  are  apparently  the  product  of  mutualistic  relationships 
so ancient that the mutualistic partners have become cellular 
organelles (e.g., mitochondria and chloroplasts) whose mutu-
alistic origins long went unrecognized. Consequently, without 
mutualism, all the eukaryotes, from  Homo sapiens  to the pro-
tozoans,  would  be  gone  and  the  history  of  life  on  earth  and 
biological richness would be set back about 1.4 billion years. 

 But back here in the present, let’s accept that mutualism is 
an integral part of nature and review what is known of the ecol-
ogy of mutualism. The first part of this brief review emphasizes 
experimental studies. Then, in the last part of chapter 15, we 
examine some theoretical approaches to the study of mutualism.

 15.8  Review experimental evidence that plant protection

   Plants benefit from mutualistic partnerships with a wide 
variety of bacteria, fungi, and animals.   Plants are the cen-
ter of mutualistic relationships that provide benefits ranging 
from nitrogen fixation and nutrient absorption to pollination 
and seed dispersal. It is no exaggeration to say that the integ-
rity of the terrestrial portion of the biosphere depends upon 
plant-centered mutualism. However, to understand the extent 
to which ecological integrity may depend upon these relation-
ships, we need careful observational studies and experiments. 
Here are some drawn from studies of mycorrhizae.  

   Plant Performance 
and Mycorrhizal Fungi 
 The  fossil  record  shows  that  mycorrhizae  arose  early  in  the 
evolution of land plants, perhaps as long as 400 million years 
ago. Over evolutionary time, a mutualistic relationship between 
plants and fungi evolved in which mycorrhizal fungi provide 
plants  with  greater  access  to  inorganic  nutrients  while  feed-
ing off the root exudates of plants. In 1885, Albert B. Frank 
was  the  first  to  correctly  recognize  that  mycorrhizae  involve 
a  mutualistic  relation  between  plants  and  fungi,  but  it  took 
over half a century for his revolutionary insights to be verified 
and accepted (Trappe 2005). The two most common types of 
mycorrhizae  are  (1)      arbuscular  mycorrhizal  fungi  (AMF),    
in which the mycorrhizal fungus produces     arbuscules,    sites of 
exchange between plant and fungus,     hyphae,    fungal filaments, 
and     vesicles,    fungal energy storage organs within root cortex 
cells, and (2)     ectomycorrhizae (ECM),    in which the fungus 
forms  a  mantle  around  roots  and  a  netlike  structure  around 
root  cells  ( fig.  15.2 ).  Mycorrhizae  are  especially  important 
in increasing plant access to phosphorus and other immobile 
nutrients (nutrients that do not move freely through soil), such 
as copper and zinc, as well as to nitrogen and water.     

  Mycorrhizae and the Water 
Balance of Plants 
 Mycorrhizal  fungi  appear  to  improve  the  ability  of  many 
plants  to  extract  soil  water.  Edie  Allen  and  Michael  Allen 
(1986)  studied  how  mycorrhizae  affect  the  water  relations 
of  the  grass   Agropyron  smithii   by  comparing  the  leaf  water 
potentials of plants with and without mycorrhizae.   Figure 15.3  
shows  that   Agropyron   with  mycorrhizae  maintained  higher 
leaf  water  potentials  than  those  without  mycorrhizae.  This 
means  that  when  growing  under  similar  conditions  of  soil 
moisture, the presence of mycorrhizae helped the grass main-
tain a higher water potential. Does this comparison show that 
mycorrhizae are directly responsible for the higher leaf water 
potential observed in the mycorrhizal grass? No, they do not.

 Figure 15.4   Effect of removing mycorrhizal hyphae on rate of 
transpiration by red clover (data from Hardie 1985).

These  higher  water  potentials  may  be  an  indirect  effect  of 
greater root growth resulting from the greater access to phos-
phorus provided by mycorrhizae.   

 Plants  with  greater  access  to  phosphorus  may  develop 
roots  that  are  more  efficient  at  extracting  and  conducting 
water; mycorrhizal fungi may not be directly involved in the 
extraction of water from soils. Kay Hardie (1985) tested this 
hypothesis directly with an ingenious experimental manipu-
lation  of  plant  growth  form  and  mycorrhizae.  First,  she 
grew  mycorrhizal  and  nonmycorrhizal  red  clover,   Trifolium 
pratense,  in conditions in which their growth was not limited 
by nutrient availability. These conditions produced plants with 
similar leaf areas and root:shoot ratios. Under these carefully 
controlled conditions, mycorrhizal red clover showed higher 
rates of transpiration than nonmycorrhizal plants. 

 Hardie  took  her  study  one  step  further  by  removing  the 
hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi from half of the red clover with 
mycorrhizae.  She  controlled  for  possible  side  effects  of  this 
manipulation by using a tracer dye to check for root damage and 
by handling and transplanting all study plants, including those in 
her control group. Removing hyphae significantly reduced rates 
of transpiration ( fig. 15.4 ), indicating a direct role of mycorrhi-
zal fungi in the water relations of plants.  Hardie suggests that 
mycorrhizal fungi improve water relations of plants by giving 
more extensive contact with moisture in the rooting zone and 
provide extra surface area for absorption of water.     

 So far, it seems that plants always benefit from mycor-
rhizae. That may not always be the case. Environmental con-
ditions may change the flow of benefits between plants and 
mycorrhizal fungi.  

  Nutrient Availability and 
the Mutualistic Balance Sheet 
 Mycorrhizae supply inorganic nutrients to plants in exchange 
for carbohydrates, but not all mycorrhizal fungi deliver nutrients 

to their host plants at equal rates. The relationship between fun-
gus and plant ranges from mutualism to parasitism, depending 
on the environmental circumstance and mycorrhizal species or 
even strains within species. 

 Nancy Johnson (1993) performed experiments designed 
to determine whether fertilization can select for less mutualis-
tic mycorrhizal fungi. Before discussing her experiments, we 
have to ask what would constitute a “less mutualistic” associ-
ation. In general, a less mutualistic relationship would be one 
in which there was a greater imbalance in the benefits to the 
mutualistic partners. In the case of mycorrhizae, a less mutu-
alistic mycorrhizal fungus would be one in which the fungal 
partner received an equal or greater quantity of photosynthetic 
product in trade for delivering a lower quantity of nutrients. 

 Johnson pointed out that there are several reasons to predict 
that fertilization would favor less mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi. 
The first is that plants vary the amount of soluble carbohydrates 
in  root  exudates  as  a  function  of  nutrient  availability.  Plants 
release more soluble carbohydrates in root exudates when they 
grow in nutrient-poor soils and decrease the amount of carbohy-
drates in root exudates as soil fertility increases. Consequently, 
fertilization of soils should favor strains, or species, of mycor-
rhizal  fungi  capable  of  living  in  a  low-carbohydrate  environ-
ment.  Johnson  suggested  that  the  mycorrhizal  fungi  capable 
of colonizing plants releasing low quantities of carbohydrates 
will probably be those that are aggressive in their acquisition of 
carbohydrates from their host plants, perhaps at the expense of 
host plant performance. She addressed this possibility using a 
mixture of field observations and greenhouse experiments. 

 In  the  first  phase  of  her  project,  Johnson  examined  the 
influence of inorganic fertilizers on the kinds of mycorrhizal 
fungi found in soils. She collected soils from 12 experimental 
plots in a field on the Cedar Creek Natural History Area in cen-
tral Minnesota that had been abandoned from agriculture for 
22 years. Six of the study plots had been fertilized with inor-
ganic fertilizers for 8 years prior to Johnson’s experiment, while 
the other six had received no fertilizer over the same period. 

 Johnson’s  samples  of  mycorrhizal  fungi  from  fertil-
ized  and  unfertilized  soils  showed  that  the  composition  of 
mycorrhizal  fungi  differed  substantially.  Of  the  12  mycor-
rhizal species occurring in the samples, unfertilized soil sup-
ported higher densities of three mycorrhizal fungi,  Gigaspora 
gigantea, G. margarita,  and  Scutellospora calospora,  whereas 
fertilized soil supported higher densities of one species,  Glo-
mus  intraradices.   Spores  of   G.  intraradices   accounted  for 
over  46%  of  the  spores  recovered  from  fertilized  soils  but 
only 27% of the spores from unfertilized soils. 

 Johnson  used  greenhouse  experiments  to  assess  how 
these  differences  in  the  composition  of  mycorrhizal  fungi 
might affect plant performance. She chose big bluestem grass, 
 Andropogon gerardii,  as a study plant for these experiments 
because it is native to the Cedar Creek Natural History Area 
and is well adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the area. Seed-
lings  of   Andropogon   were  planted  in  pots  containing  980  g 
of a 1:1 mixture of sterilized subsurface sand from the Cedar 
Creek Natural History Area and river-washed sand. Johnson 
added a composite sample of other soil microbes living in the 

 

Chapter 15 

  Mutualism 

335

soils  of  fertilized  and  unfertilized  study  plots.  She  prepared 
the composite by washing a composite soil sample from all 
fertilized  and  unfertilized  study  plots  with  deionized  water 
and passing this water through a 25  m m screen. 

 To each pot Johnson added a mycorrhizal “inoculum” of 
30 g of soil of one of three types: (1) a fertilized inoculum con-
sisting of 15 g of soil from fertilized study plots mixed with 
15 g of sterilized unfertilized soil, (2) an unfertilized inoculum 
consisting of 15 g of soil from unfertilized study plots mixed 
with 15 g of sterilized fertilized soil, or (3) a   nonmycorrhizal 
inoculum consisting of 30 g of a sterilized composite from the 
soils  of  fertilized  and  unfertilized  study  plots. The  first  two 
inocula acted as a source of mycorrhizal fungi for coloniza-
tion  of   Andropogon.  The  design  of   Johnson’s  experiment  is 
summarized in  figure 15.5 .     

 Pots were next assigned to one of four nutrient treatments 
in which Johnson added (1) no supplemental nutrients (None), 
(2) phosphorus only ( 1 P), (3) nitrogen only ( 1 N), or (4) both 
nitrogen and phosphorus ( 1 N 1 P). The subsurface sand from 
the Cedar Creek Natural History Area contained a fairly low 
concentration of nitrogen but considerably higher concentra-
tions of phosphorus. Nutrient additions were adjusted so that 
the supplemented treatments offered nitrogen and phosphorus 
concentrations comparable to those of the topsoil in the fertil-
ized study plots.

                 produced by three treatments.

 Johnson harvested five replicates of each of the treatments 
at two points in time: at 4 weeks, when  Andropogon  was actively 
growing, and at 12.5 weeks, when the grass was fully grown. At 
each harvest she measured several aspects of plant performance: 
plant height, shoot mass, and root mass; and at 12.5 weeks, she 
also recorded the number of inflorescences per plant. 

 At  12.5  weeks  shoot  mass  was  significantly  influenced 
by  nutrient  supplements  and  by  whether  or  not  plants  were 
mycorrhizal  but  not  by  the  source  of  the  mycorrhizal  inocu-
lum ( fig. 15.6 ). Shoot mass was greatest in the double nutrient 
supplement treatment ( 1 N 1 P), somewhat lower in the nitro-
gen supplement ( 1 N), and very low in the other two treatments 
(None and  1 P).  Figure 15.6 a   also indicates a definite influence

of mycorrhizae on performance. Shoot mass was significantly 
greater for mycorrhizal plants across all nutrient treatments.   

 Nutrient  supplements  and  mycorrhizae  also  signifi-
cantly  influenced  root:shoot  ratios  ( fig.  15.6 b  ).  As  we  saw 
in   chapter  7  (fig.  7.26),  plants  invest  differentially  in  roots 
and  shoots  depending  on  nutrient  and  light  availability.  It 
also appears that variation in investment is aimed at increas-
ing  supplies  of  resources  in  short  supply.  For  instance,  in 
 nutrient-poor  environments  many  plants  invest  dispropor-
tionately  in  roots  and  consequently  have  high  root:shoot 
ratios, which decline with increasing nutrient availability. The 
results of Johnson’s experiments are consistent with this gen-
eralization. Root:shoot ratios were highest in the treatments 
without nitrogen supplements (None and  1 P) and lowest in 
the treatments with nitrogen supplements ( 1 N and  1 N 1 P). 
In other words, higher plant investment in roots in the low-
nitrogen  treatments  suggests  greater  nutrient  limitation  than 
in the high-nitrogen treatments. 

 Now  let’s  look  a  bit  deeper  into  Johnson’s  results, 
where we find evidence for increased nutrient availability to 
mycorrhizal plants. In both the  1 N and “None” treatments, 
root:shoot  ratios  were  significantly  lower  in  plants  with 
mycorrhizae  ( fig.  15.6 b  ).  Mycorrhizal  plants  in  these  treat-
ments invest less in roots, suggesting that they have greater 
access  to  nutrients.  Here  we  also  see  a  hint  that  the  source 
of  the  inoculum  significantly  influenced  plant  performance. 
Plants in the  1 N 1 P treatment that were inoculated with soils 
from the unfertilized plots had slightly lower root:shoot ratios 
than  those  inoculated  with  soil  from  fertilized  plots.  These 
lower  root:shoot  ratios  suggest  that  the  mycorrhizal  fungi 
from  unfertilized  soils  were  supplying  their  plant  partners 
with more nutrients, freeing the plants to invest more of their 
energy budget in aboveground photosynthetic tissue. 

 Inflorescence  production  provides  the  strongest  evi-
dence for an effect of inoculum source on plant performance 
( fig.  15.6 c  ).   Andropogon   produced  inflorescences  only  in 
treatments  with  nitrogen  supplements  ( 1 N  and   1 N 1 P). 
Within these treatments, the mycorrhizal plants produced the 
greatest  number  of  inflorescences.  In  addition,   Andropogon  
inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi from the unfertilized plots 
and  grown  in  the   1 N 1 P  treatment  produced  the  greatest 
number of inflorescences of all. 

 In  summary,  Johnson’s  study  produced  results  that  bear 
directly  on  the  question  posed  at  the  outset  of  her  study:  Can 
fertilization of soil select for less mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi? 
 Andropogon  inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi from unfertilized 
soils showed faster shoot growth as young plants and produced 
more  inflorescences  when  mature.  These  results  suggest  that 
plants receive more benefit from association with the mycorrhi-
zal fungi from unfertilized soils. It appears that altering the nutri-
ent environment does alter the mutualistic balance sheet. 

 The results of Johnson’s experiments are consistent with the 
functional equilibrium model (Mooney 1972; Brouwer 1983), 
which proposes that the availability of belowground resources, 
mainly nutrients and water, and aboveground resources, mainly 
light, controls how plants allocate to roots, mycorrhizae, shoots, 
and leaves ( fig. 15.7 ). According to the model, plants growing 

in fertilized soils will allocate less energy to roots and mycor-
rhizae. Over the long term, this lower allocation by plants could 
shift  the  composition  of  the  mycorrhizal  fungal  community 
toward forms that compete well for reduced supplies of carbo-
hydrates and supply lower nutrients to the plant in exchange. 
However, ecologists are still far from having a complete under-
standing  of  the  factors  controlling  the  exchange  of  resources 
between plants and mycorrhizal fungi. Consequently, research-
ers from around the world, conducting research at local through 
global  scales,  have  proposed  many  different  models  as  they 
work  toward  a  better  understanding  of  this  key  mutualism  in 
terrestrial ecosystems (Johnson et al. 2006).     

 Plants engage in a wide variety of mutualisms with many 
other organisms. One of those involves associations that pro-
vide  protection  from  herbivores  and  competitors.  Writing 
about the natural history of mutualism, Daniel Janzen (1985) 
included  “plant-ant  protection  mutualisms”  as  one  of  his 
 general categories of mutualism. Janzen (1966, 1967a, 1967b) 
himself is responsible for studying one of the best known of 
these  mutualisms,  the  obligate  mutualism  between  ants  and 
swollen thorn acacias in Central America.   

  Ants and Swollen Thorn Acacias 
 The  ants  that  are  mutualistic  with  bullhorn,  or  swollen 
thorn,  acacias  are  members  of  the  genus   Pseudomyrmex   in 
the  subfamily  Pseudomyrmecinae. This  subfamily  of  ants  is 
dominated by genera and species that have evolved close rela-
tionships  with  living  plants.   Pseudomyrmex   spp.  are  gener-
ally associated with trees and show several characteristics that 
Janzen suggested are associated with arboreal living. They are 
generally fast and agile runners, have good vision, and forage 
independently. To this list, the  Pseudomyrmex  spp. associated 
with  swollen  thorn  acacias,  or  “acacia-ants,”  add  aggressive 
behavior toward vegetation and animals contacting their home 
tree,  larger  colony  size,  and  24-hour  activity  outside  of  the 
nest. This combination of characteristics means that any herbi-
vore attempting to forage on an acacia occupied by acacia-ants 
is met by a large number of fast, agile, and highly aggressive 
defenders and is given this reception no matter what time of 
the day or night it attempts to feed. Janzen listed six species 
of   Pseudomyrmex   with  an  obligate  mutualistic  relationship 
with swollen thorn acacias and refers to three additional unde-
scribed species. His experimental work focused principally on 
one species,  Pseudomyrmex ferruginea.  

 Worldwide, the genus  Acacia  includes over 700 species. 
Distributed  throughout  the  tropical  and  subtropical  regions 
around  the  world,  acacias  are  particularly  common  in  drier 
tropical  and  subtropical  environments.  The  swollen  thorn 
acacias,  which  form  obligate  mutualisms  with   Pseudomyr-
mex   spp.,  are  restricted  to  the  New  World,  where  they  are 
distributed from southern Mexico, through Central America, 
and into Venezuela and Colombia in northern South America. 
Across this region, swollen thorn acacias occur mainly in the 
lowlands up to 1,500 m elevation in areas with a dry season of 
1 to 6 months. Swollen thorn acacias show several character-
istics related to their obligate association with ants, including

enlarged thorns with a soft, easily excavated pith; year-round 
leaf  production;  enlarged  foliar  nectaries;  and  leaflet  tips 
modified into concentrated food sources called Beltian bod-
ies. The thorns provide living space, while the foliar nectar-
ies  provide  a  source  of  sugar  and  liquid.  Beltian  bodies  are 
a source of oils and protein. Resident ants vigorously guard 
these resources against encroachment by nearly all encroach-
ers, including other plants. 

 Janzen’s  detailed  natural  history  of  the  interaction 
between  bullhorn  acacia,   Acacia  cornigera,   and  ants  paints 
a rich picture of mutual benefits to both partners ( fig. 15.8 ). 
Newly mated  Pseudomyrmex  queens fly and run through the 
vegetation  searching  for  unoccupied  seedlings  or  shoots  of 
bullhorn  acacia. When  a  queen  finds  an  unoccupied  acacia, 

she excavates an entrance in one of the green thorns or uses 
one  carved  previously  by  another  ant.  The  queen  then  lays 
her first eggs in the thorn and begins to forage on her newly 
acquired home plant. She gets nectar for herself and her devel-
oping larvae from the foliar nectaries and gets additional solid 
food from the Beltian bodies. As time passes, the number of 
workers in the new colony increases, and while they take up 
all the chores of the colony, the queen shifts to a mainly repro-
ductive  function;  her  abdomen  enlarges  and  she  becomes 
increasingly sedentary.   

 In exchange for food and shelter, ants protect acacias from 
attack by herbivores and competition from other plants. Work-
ers have several duties, including foraging for themselves, the 
larvae, and the queen. One of their most important activities 

338

is  protecting  the  home  plant.  Workers  will  attack,  bite,  and 
sting nearly all insects they encounter on their home plant or 
any large herbivores, such as deer and cattle, that attempt to 
feed on the plant. They will also attack and kill any vegeta-
tion encroaching on the home tree. Workers sting and bite the 
branches of other plants that come in contact with their home 
tree  or  that  grow  near  its  base.  These  activities  keep  other 
plants from growing near the base of the home tree and prevent 
other trees, shrubs, and vines from shading it. Consequently 
the home plant’s access to light and soil nutrients is increased. 
 Once a colony has at least 50 to 150 workers, which takes 
about  9  months,  they  patrol  the  home  plant  day  and  night. 
About  one-fourth  of  the  total  colony  is  active  at  all  times. 
Eventually  colonies  grow  so  large  that  they  occupy  all  the 
thorns on the home tree and may even spread to  neighboring 
acacias. The queen, however, generally remains on the shoot 
that she colonized originally. When the colony reaches a size 
of  about  1,200  workers,  it  begins  producing  a  more  or  less 
steady  stream  of  winged  reproductive  males  and  females, 
which fly off to mate. The queens among them may eventu-
ally establish new colonies on other bullhorn acacias or one of 
the  other  Central American  swollen  thorn  acacias.  Colonies 
may eventually reach a total population of 30,000 workers. 

  Experimental Evidence for Mutualism 
 While  much  of  the  natural  history  of  this  mutualism  was 
known at the time Janzen conducted his studies, no one had 
experimentally tested the strength of its widely supposed ben-
efits. Janzen took his work beyond natural history to experi-
mentally test for the importance of ants to bullhorn acacias. It 
was clear that the ant needs swollen thorn acacias, but do the 
acacias need the ants? Janzen’s experiments concentrated on 
the influence of ants on acacia performance. He also tested the 
effectiveness of the ants at keeping acacias free of herbivorous 
insects. Janzen removed ants from acacias by clipping occu-
pied thorns or by cutting out entire shoots with their ants. He 
then measured the growth rate, leaf production, mortality, and 
insect population density on acacias with and without ants. 

 Janzen’s experiments demonstrated that ants significantly 
improve plant performance. Suckers growing from stumps of 

acacias  occupied  by  ants  lengthened  at  seven  times  the  rate 
of  suckers  without  ants  ( fig.  15.9 ).  Suckers  with  ants  were 
also more than 13 times heavier than suckers without ants and 
had more than twice the number of leaves and almost three 
times the number of thorns. Suckers with ants also survived at 
twice the rate of suckers without ants ( fig. 15.10 ).         

 What produces the improved performance of acacias with 
ants? Differences in plant performance were likely the result 
of increased competition with other plants and increased attack 
by herbivorous insects faced by acacias without their tending 
ants. Janzen found that acacias without ants had more herbivo-
rous insects on them than did acacias with ants ( fig. 15.11 ). 

Acacia shoots inhabited 
by ants grew much faster.

Janzen’s experiments suggest that bullhorn acacias need ants 
as much as the ants need the acacia. It appears that this is a 
truly mutualistic situation. Determining whether this relation-
ship is obligate for the acacia will require further research.    

  Potential Conflict between Mutualists 
 Most research on swollen thorn acacias has focused on their ant-
protection mutualisms. However, these trees depend on many 
other mutualistic relationships. Belowground, their roots shel-
ter nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules and harbor mycorrhizal 
fungi. Aboveground, besides sheltering swarms of  Pseudomyr-
mex,  ants that drive away herbivorous insects, the acacia’s flow-
ers depend on other insects, mainly bees, for pollination. The 
acacia’s ant guards could come into conflict with  pollinators in 
two ways. First, the ants could remove nectar from flowers and 
reduce their attractiveness to potential pollinators. Second, the 
ants could guard flowers, driving pollinators away. 

 This  potential  conflict  between  mutualists  of   swollen 
thorn  acacias  attracted  the  attention  of  Nigel  Raine,  Pat 
Willmer,  and  Graham  Stone  (2002),  researchers  from  three 
different British universities. They conducted their research at 
the Chamela Biological Station of the Universidad Nacional 
Autónoma de México, where they studied  Acacia hindsii  and 
its  ant  protector,   Pseudomyrmex  veneficus.   Raine,  Willmer, 
and Stone first examined the distribution of ants and pollina-
tors to see if they overlapped in space or time. They found that 
ant  and  pollinator  activity  overlaps  in  time.  However,  while 
ants and pollinators are active on  A. hindsii  at the same time, 
they rarely overlap spatially. The ants rarely visit acacia inflo-
rescences. Why is that? Raine, Willmer, and Stone observed 
that  the  foliar  nectaries  and  Beltian  bodies  used  by  the  ants 
occur on new growth, whereas flowers are restricted to older 
shoots.  In  addition,  in  contrast  to  acacia  species  that  do  not 
support protective ants, the inflorescences of  A.  hindsii  pro-
duce no nectar. Lack of nectar would make the flowers less

attractive  to  patrolling  ants.  Still,  because  new  and  older 
shoots can grow in close proximity, the researchers wondered 
whether some other factor might keep the ants from patrolling 
the inflorescences on older shoots. 

 Since  Willmer  and  Stone  (1997)  had  discovered  previ-
ously  that  the  flowers  of  some African  acacias  contained  an 
ant repellent, they tested for the presence of a repellent in the 
flowers of  A. hindsii  by rubbing several acacia tissues on the 
bark of branches actively patrolled by ants. The tissues tested 
were new inflorescences, old inflorescences, leaves, and buds. 
Each of these tissues was rubbed within 3 cm squares marked 
on the bark of patrolled branches using water-based markers. 
As  a  control,  Raine,  Willmer,  and  Stone  marked  one  set  of 
squares but did not rub any plant tissues on them. Once experi-
mental and control squares had been established, the research-
ers  watched  patrolling  ants,  noting  whether  they  entered 
experimental and control squares or avoided crossing them. 

  Figure  15.12   shows  the  results  of  the  repellent  experi-
ment.  Raine,  Willmer,  and  Stone  found  that  new  inflores-
cences were strongly repellent to patrolling ants and that older 
inflorescences,  though  repellent,  were  rejected  less  often. 
Meanwhile,  leaf  and  bud  rubbings  were  rejected  no  more 
frequently  than  were  control  squares.  In  summary,  protec-
tion and pollination mutualisms do not come into conflict on  
A. hindsii  because of spatial separation of inflorescences and 
resources used by guarding ants, and because  A. hindsii  inflo-
rescences lack a potential ant attractant (nectar) and instead 
contain a chemical repellent.     

 While tropical plant protection mutualisms are most often 
cited, there are many examples of mutualism between plants 
and  ants  in  the  temperate  zone. A  particularly  well-studied 
interaction is that between ants and the aspen sunflower,  Heli-
anthella quinquenervis.    

Avoidance by ants indicates the presence of 
a chemical repellent in acacia inflorescences 
that is not present in other tissues.

Interactions

  A Temperate Plant Protection 
Mutualism 
 Aspen sunflowers live in wet mountain meadows of the Rocky 
Mountains  from  Chihuahua,  Mexico,  to  southern  Idaho,  at 
elevations as low as 1,600 m in the northern part of its range 
to 4,000 m in the south. Ants are attracted to aspen sunflow-
ers  because  they  produce  nectar  at      extrafloral  nectaries,    
 nectar-producing structures outside of the flowers. In the case of 
aspen sunflowers, the extrafloral nectaries are associated with 
structures  called   involucral  bracts,   modified  leaves  that  first 
enclose the flower head prior to flowering and then surround 
the  base  of  the  flower  after  it  opens.  Some  early  researchers 
hypothesized that extrafloral nectaries function to attract ants, 
while others suggested that they are primarily excretory organs. 
 The  extrafloral  nectar  produced  by  aspen  sunflowers  is 
rich  in  sucrose  and  contains  high  concentrations  of  a  wide 
variety  of  amino  acids.  So,  like  the  swollen  thorn  acacias 
studied by Janzen, the aspen sunflower provides food to ants. 
In contrast to swollen thorn acacias, however, this sunflower 
does not provide living places. This contrast is general across 
temperate  ant-plant  mutualisms,  which  involve  food  as  an 
attractant but no living quarters. 

 David Inouye and Orley Taylor (1979) recorded five spe-
cies of ants on aspen sunflowers, including  Formica obscuripes, 
F. fusca, F. integroides planipilis, Tapinoma sessile,  and  Myrmica  
sp. These ants are not obligately associated with aspen sunflow-
ers and can be found tending aphids on other species of plants or 
even collecting flower nectar on some plants. However, Inouye 
and  Taylor  never  observed  them  collecting  nectar  from  aspen 
sunflower  blossoms  nor  tending  aphids  on  this  plant.  Appar-
ently, the extrafloral nectar produced by the aspen sunflower is a 
sufficient attractant. Ants find the plant so attractive that Inouye 
and Taylor observed up to 40 ants on a single flower stalk. 

 While the ants visiting the extrafloral nectaries of  Heli-
anthella  clearly derive benefit, it is not obvious that the plant 
receives  any  benefits  from  the  association.  What  benefits 
might this sunflower gain by having ants roaming around its 
flowers and flower buds? Inouye and Taylor proposed that the 
ants may protect the sunflower’s developing seeds from seed 
predators. In the central Rocky Mountains, the seeds of aspen 
sunflowers are attacked by a variety of seed predators, includ-
ing the larvae of two species of flies in the family Tephritidae, 
a fly in the family Agromyzidae, and a phycitid moth. These 
seed predators damaged over 90% of the seeds produced by 
some of the flowers at one of Inouye and Taylor’s study sites. 
 The high densities of ants that can occur on a single aspen 
sunflower certainly have the potential to deter seed predators, 
but these same ants might also interfere with pollination. This 
potential  for  interference  is  not  realized,  however,  because 
seed predators generally attack aspen sunflowers before they 
are fully mature and before they have formed ray florets, the 
“petals”  of  sunflowers,  daisies,  etc.  Prior  to  opening  of  the 
flower  bud,  when  tephridid  and  agromyzid  flies  try  to  ovi-
posit on the bud, ants visiting the extrafloral nectaries patrol 
the whole surface of the flower bud in large numbers. Later, 
the fully formed ray florets, which act as attractants for pol-
linators  (mainly  bumblebees),  form  a  screen  between  the 

involucral bracts and the flower head, reducing the potential 
for ants to interfere with pollinators. 

 The  question  asked  by  Inouye  and Taylor  was  whether 
or not the presence of ants on aspen sunflowers reduces the 
rate  of  attack  by  seed  predators.  They  addressed  this  ques-
tion in several ways. First, they compared rates of attack by 
seed predators on flowers tended by ants with rates of attack 
on flowers where ants were naturally absent. This comparison 
showed that flowers without ants suffered two to four times as 
much seed predation ( fig. 15.13 ). The researchers also found 
that  the  average  number  of  ants  per  flower  stalk  decreased 
with distance from an ant nest and that the plants with fewer 
ants suffered higher rates of seed damage by seed predators.     

 Next, Inouye and Taylor performed an experiment in which 
they prevented ants from moving onto some plants by applying 
a sticky barrier to the base of flower stalks. They used adjacent 
plants as controls. The results of Inouye and Taylor’s experi-
ment demonstrated that exclusion of ants from flowers resulted 
in significantly higher rates of seed predation ( fig. 15.14 ).     

 As  in  the  tropical  swollen  thorn  acacia-ant  mutualism, 
ants associated with aspen sunflowers provide protection while 
receiving substantial benefits in the form of food. Unlike the 
tropical system, the association between aspen sunflowers and 
ants incorporates a significant degree of flexibility. This flex-
ibility may be a hallmark of many temperate mutualisms. 

 Why does the relationship between ants and aspen sun-
flowers remain facultative? In other words, why hasn’t there 
been  strong  selection  for  an  obligate  relationship?  Continu-
ing studies by David Inouye provide clues. He estimated the 
abundance of aspen sunflowers on two study plots for more 
than two decades. This long-term study shows that every few 
years,  the  flower  heads  of  aspen  sunflowers  are  killed  by 
late  frosts.  From  1974  to  1995,  aspen  sunflowers  produced 
very few flower heads in 1976, 1981, 1985, 1989, and 1992 
( fig. 15.15 ). Inouye has continued to monitor his study plots 
(Inouye 2008) and has discovered that, due to earlier spring

snowmelt  with  global  warming,   Helianthella   flower  buds 
are  even  more  vulnerable  to  killing  by  late  spring  frosts 
( fig. 15.16 ). An ant species with an obligate mutualistic rela-
tionship with the aspen sunflower and that relied entirely on 
it as a source of nectar would not survive long. Inouye points 
out that, paradoxically, the frosts are beneficial to aspen sun-
flowers  in  the  long  run  because  they  reduce  populations  of 
seed predators such as tephritid flies, which have no place to 
lay their eggs when hard frost kills the flower heads. In the 
coevolutionary  relationships  between  the  aspen  sunflower 
and its predators, the physical environment plays a significant 
role.  In  temperate  climates  generally,  the  physical  environ-
ment seems to play as large a role as biological relationships 
in determining ecological patterns and processes.

  Mutualism

 If we venture into tropical seas and probe their inhabit-
ants, we soon uncover a wide variety of mutualistic relation-
ships at least as rich as those we examined between terrestrial 
plants and their partners. The most striking marine counter-
parts to the mutualisms of terrestrial plants are those centered 
around reef-building corals.

   Reef-building  corals  depend  upon  mutualistic  relation-
ships  with  algae  and  animals,  with  an  exchange  of  ben-
efits  paralleling  those  between  terrestrial  mutualists.   
Because of the importance of mutualism in the lives of reef-
building  corals,  it  appears  that  the  ecological  integrity  of 
coral reefs depends upon mutualism. Coral reefs show excep-
tional  productivity  and  diversity.  Recent  estimates  put  the 
number of species occurring on coral reefs at approximately 
0.5 million, and coral reef productivity is among the highest 
of any natural ecosystem. As we saw in chapter 3, the para-
dox is that this overwhelming diversity and exceptional pro-
ductivity occurs in an ecosystem surrounded by nutrient-poor 
tropical oceans. The key to explaining this paradox lies with 
mutualism;  in  this  case,  between  reef-building  corals  and 
unicellular algae called zooxanthellae, members of the phy-
lum Dinoflagellata. Most of these organisms are free-living 
unicellular marine and freshwater photoautotrophs.  

   Zooxanthellae and Corals 
 The association between corals and zooxanthellae is function-
ally similar to the relationship between plants and mycorrhi-
zal fungi. Zooxanthellae live within coral tissues at densities 
averaging approximately 1 million cells per square centimeter 
of coral surface. Like plants, zooxanthellae receive nutrients 
from  their  animal  partner.  In  return,  like  mycorrhizal  fungi, 
the coral receives organic compounds synthesized by zooxan-
thellae during photosynthesis. 

 One  of  the  most  fundamental  discoveries  concerning 
the  relationship  between  corals  and  zooxanthellae  is  that 
the  release  of  organic  compounds  by  zooxanthellae  is  con-
trolled  by  the  coral  partner.  Corals  induce  zooxanthellae  to 
release  organic  compounds  with  “signal”  compounds  that 

alter  the  permeability  of  the  zooxanthellae  cell  membrane. 
Zooxanthellae  grown  in  isolation  from  corals  release  very 
little organic material into their environment. However, when 
exposed to extracts of coral tissue, zooxanthellae immediately 
increase  the  rate  at  which  they  release  organic  compounds. 
This  response  appears  to  be  a  specific  chemically  mediated 
communication  between  corals  and  zooxanthellae.  Zooxan-
thellae do not respond to extracts of other animal tissues, and 
coral extracts do not induce leaking of organic molecules by 
any other algae that have been studied. 

 Corals  not  only  control  the  secretion  of  organic  com-
pounds by zooxanthellae, they also control the rate of zooxan-
thellae  population  growth  and  population  density.  In  corals, 
zooxanthellae  populations  grow  at  rates  1/10  to  1/100  the 
rates observed when they are cultured separately from corals. 
Corals  exert  control  over  zooxanthellae  population  density 
through their influence on organic matter secretion. Normally, 
unicellular algae show     balanced growth,    growth in which all 
cell constituents, such as nitrogen, carbon, and DNA, increase 
at the same rate. However, zooxanthellae living in coral tis-
sues  show  unbalanced  growth,  producing  fixed  carbon  at  a 
much higher rate than other cell constituents. Moreover, the 
coral stimulates the zooxanthellae to secrete 90% to 99% of 
this  fixed  carbon,  which  the  coral  uses  for  its  own  respira-
tion. Fixed carbon secreted and diverted for use by the coral 
could otherwise be used to produce new zooxanthellae, which 
would increase population growth. 

 What benefits do the zooxanthellae get out of their rela-
tionship with corals? The main benefit appears to be access 
to  higher  levels  of  nutrients,  especially  nitrogen.  Corals 
feed  on  zooplankton,  which  gives  them  a  means  of  captur-
ing  nutrients,  especially  nitrogen  and  phosphorus.  When 
corals metabolize the protein in their zooplankton prey, they 
excrete  ammonium  as  a  waste  product.  L.  Muscatine  and 
C.  D’Elia  (1978)  showed  that  coral  species  such  as   Tubas-
trea  aurea   that  do  not  harbor  zooxanthellae  continuously 
excrete ammonium into their environment, while corals such 
as  Pocillopora damicornis  do not excrete measurable amounts 
of ammonium ( fig. 15.17 ). What happens to the ammonium 
produced by  Pocillopora  during metabolism of the protein in 
their zooplankton prey? Muscatine and D’Elia suggested that 
this ammonium is immediately taken up by zooxanthellae as 
the coral excretes it. In addition to internal recycling of the 
ammonium  produced  by  their  coral  partner,  zooxanthellae 
also actively absorb ammonium from seawater. By absorbing 
nutrients from the surrounding medium and leaking very lit-
tle back into the environment, corals and their zooxanthellae 
gradually  accumulate  substantial  quantities  of  nitrogen.  So, 
as in tropical rain forest, large quantities of nutrients on coral 
reefs accumulate and are retained in living biomass.      

  A Coral Protection Mutualism 
 The  ant-acacia  mutualism  that  we  reviewed  previously  has 
a striking parallel on coral reefs. Corals in the genera  Pocil-
lopora   and   Acropora   host  a  variety  of  crabs  in  the  family 
 Xanthidae,  mainly   Trapezia   spp.  and   Tretralia   spp.  as  well

as a species of pistol shrimp,  Alpheus lottini.  In this mutualis-
tic relationship ( fig. 15.18 ), the crustaceans protect the coral 
from a wide variety of predators while the coral provides its 
crustacean partners with shelter and food.   

 Peter Glynn (1983) surveyed the coral-crustacean mutu-
alism  and  found  that  the  eastern,  central,  and  western  areas 
of the Pacific Ocean contain 13 species of corals that are pro-
tected by crustacean mutualists, including 17 species of crabs 
and 1 species of shrimp, all of which are found only on cor-
als in what is apparently an obligate mutualism. These crus-
taceans protect the corals from a variety of sea stars that prey 
on corals but especially from attacks by the crown-of-thorns 
sea star,  Acanthaster planci.  At the approach of the sea star, 
the crabs become highly disturbed and then attack by pinch-
ing and clipping the sea star’s spines and tube feet, grasping it 
and jerking it up and down and resisting its retreat. The mutu-
alistic shrimp also attacks the sea star by snipping spines and 
tube feet and making loud snapping sounds with an enlarged 
pincer specialized for the purpose. The loud popping sounds,

which  have  given  shrimp  in  the  genus   Alpheus   the  name 
“ pistol shrimp,” are so intense they stun small fish. 

 Glynn  used  field  and  laboratory  experiments  to  test 
whether  this  aggression  by  crustaceans  is  effective  at  repel-
ling  attacks  by  predatory  sea  stars.  He  conducted  a  field 
experiment at 8 to 12 m depth on a reef in Guam, where he 
removed the crustaceans from an experimental group of cor-
als  and  gave  sea  stars  a  choice  between  these  and  an  equal 
number of corals that retained their crustacean partners. Over 
a period of 2 days, the sea stars attacked the unprotected cor-
als at a much higher frequency ( fig. 15.19 ). Glynn obtained 
similar results in a laboratory study of the corals and crusta-
cean mutualists of Panama, in which sea stars attacked 85% 
of the unprotected colonies. These results show that the crus-
tacean mutualists of corals substantially improve the chances 
that a coral will avoid attack by sea stars.     

 Observations  by  Glynn  and  John  Stimson  (1990)  sug-
gest that mutualistic crabs also protect corals from other less 
conspicuous  attackers.  Glynn  observed  that  the  presence  of 
crabs seems to enhance the condition of coral tissues. Stim-
son found that when he removed crabs, corals showed tissue 
death in the deep axils of their branches and that these areas 
were soon invaded by algae, sponges, and tunicates. It appears 
that, in addition to protecting corals from the attacks of large 
predators, the activities of crabs promote the health and integ-
rity of coral tissues. If this is a mutualistic relationship, what 
do the crabs receive in return for their investment? 

 Like swollen thorn acacias, corals provide their crustacean 
mutualists  with  shelter  and  food.  The  corals  harboring  crabs 
and  pistol  shrimp  have  a  tightly  branched  growth  form  that 
offers shelter, and the crustaceans feed on the mucus produced 
by the corals.  Trapezia  spp., the most common crabs guarding 
pocilloporid corals, stimulate mucus flow from corals by insert-
ing their legs into coral polyps, a behavior not reported for any

other crabs. Corals contain large quantities of lipids that con-
stitute 30% to 40% of the dry weight of their tissues, much of 
which they release with mucus. This release may constitute up 
to 40% of the daily photosynthetic production by zooxanthellae. 
 The pocilloporid corals that host crustaceans concentrate 
some of this lipid into fat bodies that are 300 to 500  m m in 
length. Glynn suggested that the fat bodies produced by pocil-
loporid corals hosting protective crabs may be a part of their 
mutualistic  relationship.  Stimson  tested  this  hypothesis  by 
determining whether commensal crabs influence the produc-
tion of fat bodies by coral polyps. He conducted his experi-
ments at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology on Coconut 
Island in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. He collected colonies 
of  Pocillopora  8 to 10 cm in diameter from the midbay region 
of Kaneohe Bay, placed them in buckets of seawater, and took 
them back to the marine laboratory on Coconut Island. There, 
he  divided  the  corals  into  experimental  and  control  groups. 
He then removed crabs and pistol shrimp from the experimen-
tal  coral  colonies  by  “teasing”  them  out  with  a  small  wire. 
Corals  with  and  without  crabs  were  then  kept  separately  in 
outdoor tanks supplied with flowing seawater. 

 After  24  days,  Stimson  compared  the  number  of  fat 
bodies on corals with and without crabs. He also compared 
these experimental results with the density of fat bodies on 
 Pocillopora  in Kaneohe Bay that naturally hosted or lacked 
mutualistic crabs. The results of these experiments and field 
observations show clearly that  Pocillopora  increases its pro-
duction of fat bodies in the presence of crabs both in the lab-
oratory and in the field ( fig. 15.20 ). Stimson also examined 
the digestive tract of crabs inhabiting corals and found that it 
contained large quantities of lipids. At the same time, no sig-
nificant reductions in either the reproductive rate or growth 
rates  of  corals  supporting  crabs  were  found.  Stimson  con-
cluded that the relationship between corals and crabs is a true 
mutualism, with both partners receiving substantial benefit.   

The presence of crabs appears to 
stimulate increased fat body 
production by Pocillopora.

 The   extent   of  benefit  may  be  the  essential  factor  driv-
ing the evolution of mutualisms. In the following section, we 
review  theoretical  analyses  of  how  the  relative  benefits  and 
costs of an association influence the evolution of mutualistic 
relationships. 

  Concept 15.2 Review 

1.   If reef-building corals are placed in the dark, they will 
expel the zooxanthellae in their tissues. What does this 
suggest concerning controls on the relationship between 
corals and zooxanthellae?  

2.   In terms of costs and benefits, why might corals expel 

their zooxanthellae when placed in the dark?       

  15.3  Evolution of Mutualism 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 15.13  Interpret the elements of Keeler’s model for the evo-

lution of mutualism.

 15.14  Use specific examples, to elaborate on the conditions 

under which Keeler’s model for the evolution of 
mutualism predicts that a mutualism will persist.

 15.15  Explain the application of Keeler’s model to the evo-

lution of a facultative plant protection mutualism.

   Theory  predicts  that  mutualism  will  evolve  where  the 
benefits of mutualism exceed the costs.   We have reviewed 
several complex mutualisms both on land and in marine envi-
ronments.  There  are  many  others  ( fig.  15.21 ),  every  one  a 
fascinating  example  of  the  intricacies  of  nature.  Ecologists 
not only study the present biology of those mutualisms, but 
also seek to understand the conditions leading to their evolu-
tion and persistence. Theoretical analyses point to the relative 
costs and benefits of a possible relationship as a key factor in 
the evolution of mutualism.     

 Modeling of mutualism has generally taken one of two 
approaches.  The  earliest  attempts  involved  modifications 
of  the  Lotka-Volterra  equations  to  represent  the  population 
dynamics  of  mutualism.  The  alternative  approach  has  been 
to model mutualistic interactions using cost-benefit analysis 
to explore the conditions under which mutualisms can evolve 
and persist. In chapters 13 and 14, where we discussed models 
of competition and predation, we focused on the population 
dynamic approach to modeling species interactions. Here, we 
concentrate on cost-benefit analyses of mutualism.    

  Kathleen Keeler (1981, 1985) developed models to rep-
resent the relative costs and benefits of several types of mutu-
alistic  interactions. Among  them  are  two  of  the  mutualistic 
interactions  we  discussed  earlier  in  this  chapter:  ant-plant 
protection  mutualisms  and  mycorrhizae.  Keeler’s  approach 
requires that we consider a population polymorphic for mutu-
alism  containing  three  kinds  of  individuals:  (1)   successful 
mutualists,   which  give  and  receive  measurable  benefits  to

 X ,  which is an estimate of variation among means of samples 
drawn from a population. Here, we will use the standard error 
to calculate a     confidence interval.    A confidence interval is a 
range of values within which the true population mean occurs 
with a particular probability. That probability, which is called 
the     level of confidence,    is calculated as 1 minus the signifi-
cance level,  a , which is generally 0.05:

 A Student’s  t  table, available in most statistics textbooks, sum-
marizes  the  values  of  a  statistical  distribution  known  as  the 
Student’s   t   distribution. The  value  of   t   we  use  for  calculating 
a confidence interval is determined by the degrees of freedom 
( n   2  1) and the significance level, which in this case is  a   5  0.05. 
Let’s calculate a 95% confidence interval using the body 
length measurements for the sample of loach minnows,  Tiar-
oga  cobitis,   that  we  used  to  calculate  a  mean  and  standard 
error in chapter 14 (see p. 314):

__
 X  5 56.2 mm
 
s _
 X  5 1.96 mm

 This  sample  of  body  lengths  included  measurements  of 
10 fish ( n   5  10) and so the degrees of freedom for this sample 
( n   2  1) is 9. Using a significance level of 0.05 and degrees of 
freedom of 9, we find that the critical value of  t  from a Student’s 
 t  table is 2.26 (table A.1, p. 529, of Appendix A). Therefore, the 
95% confidence interval calculated from this sample is:
__
   Confidence interval for μ 5  
 X  6 s _

 X  × t

                                    5 56.2 mm 6 1.96 mm × 2.26

                         5 56.2 mm 6 4.43 mm

   With  this  confidence  interval,  we  can  say  that  there  is  a  95% 
probability that the true mean body length in this population of 
loach minnows is somewhere between 60.63 mm (56.2 mm  1  
4.43 mm) and 51.77 mm (56.2 mm  2  4.43 mm). 

 This  is  shown  graphically  in   figure  1 ,  along  with  the 
mean  and  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  sample  of  loach 
minnows from the Gila River that we first considered in chap-
ter 14 (p. 314). Notice that the 95% confidence interval for 
the  Gila  River  sample  is  much  smaller.  This  smaller  confi-
dence interval is the result of the larger sample size from the 
Gila River ( n   5  50), which produced a smaller standard error   
 (s _
 X   5  0.88)   and  a  smaller  critical   t   value  (2.01),  since  the 
degrees of freedom is 49. As a consequence of having a larger 
sample,  our  estimate  of  the  true  population  mean  has  been 
narrowed to a much smaller range for the Gila River popula-
tion of loach minnows.

benefits  to  another  organism  but,  for  some  reason,  do  not 
receive any benefit in return; and (3)  nonmutualists,  neither 
giving nor receiving benefit from a mutualistic partner. The 
bottom  line  in  Keeler’s  approach  is  that  for  a  population  to 
be  mutualistic,  the  fitness  of  successful  mutualists  must  be 
greater  than  the  fitness  of  either  unsuccessful  mutualists  or 
nonmutualists. In addition, the combined fitness of success-
ful  and  unsuccessful  mutualists  must  exceed  that  of  the  fit-
ness of nonmutualists. If these conditions are not met, Keeler 
proposed that natural selection will eventually eliminate the 
mutualistic interaction from the population. 

 In general, we can expect mutualism to evolve and persist 
in a population when and where mutualistic individuals have 
higher fitness than nonmutualistic individuals. 

 Keeler represented the fitness of nonmutualists as:

wnm 5 fitness of nonmutualists     

 (Fitness has been traditionally represented by the symbol w 
and though it might be clearer to use another symbol, such as  f,  

the  traditional  symbol  is  used  here.)  Keeler  represents  the 
 fitness of mutualists as:

the fitness of nonmutualists. Why do we have to combine the 
 fitness of successful and unsuccessful mutualists? Remember 
that both confer benefit to their partner, but only the success-
ful mutualists receive benefit in return. 

 The analysis is more convenient if we think of these rela-
tionships in terms of     selection coefficients,    the relative selec-
tive costs associated with being either a successful mutualist, 
an unsuccessful mutualist, or a nonmutualist:

   s 5 1 2 w     and     w 5 (1 2 s).

 Using  selective  coefficients,  Keeler  expressed  the  selective 
cost of being a successful mutualist, an unsuccessful mutual-
ist, or a nonmutualist as:

sms 5 (H)(1 2 A)(1 2 D) 1 IA 1 ID 
smu 5 (H)(1 2 D) 1 IA 1 ID

where:

   H  5   the proportion of the plant tissue damaged in the 

absence of any defenses  

  D  5   the amount of protection given to the plant tissues by 
defenses other than ants (e.g., chemical defenses), so, 
1  2  D is the amount of tissue damage that would occur 
in spite of these alternative defenses  

  A  5   the amount of herbivory prevented by ants (so, again, 
1  2  A is the amount of herbivory that occurs in spite 
of ants)

 Using these selective coefficients we can express  Keeler’s condi-
tions for evolution and persistence of the ant-plant mutualism as:

p(1 1 sms) 1 q(1 2 smu) > 1 2 snm    

into which Keeler substituted the relationships given in equa-
tions (4), (5), and (6). By simplifying the resulting equation, 
she produced the following expression of benefits relative to 
costs:

p[H (1 2 D) A] > IA      

   Facultative Ant-Plant 
Protection Mutualisms 
 Keeler applied her cost-benefit model to facultative mutualisms 
involving  plants  with  extrafloral  nectaries  and  ants  that  feed 
at the nectaries and provide protection to the plant in return. 
These are mutualisms like that between  Helianthella quinque-
nervis   and  ants,  which  we  discussed  earlier  in   Concept  15.1 
on plant mutualism. Her model is not appropriate for obligate 
mutualisms like that between swollen thorn acacias and their 
mutualistic  ants.  In  addition,  Keeler  wrote  her  model  from 
the perspective of the plant side of the mutualism. Let’s step 
through the general model and connect each of the terms with 
the ecology of facultative plant-ant protection mutualisms. 

 In this model, w ms  is the fitness of a plant that produces 
extrafloral nectaries and that successfully attracts ants effec-
tive at guarding it, while w mu  is the fitness of a plant that pro-
duces extrafloral nectaries but that has not attracted enough 
ants to mount a successful defense. You may remember that 
Inouye and Taylor found that  Helianthella  far away from ant 
nests  attracted  few  ants.  These  plants  would  correspond  to 
Keeler’s unsuccessful mutualists. In addition, Keeler includes 
the fitness of nonmutualistic plants, w nm , which would be the 
fitness of individuals of a plant such as  Helianthella  that does 
not produce extrafloral nectaries. 

 Keeler’s  model  represents  potential  benefits  to  the  host 

plant as:

where:

p[H (1 2 D)A]    

   p  5   the proportion of the plant population attracting suffi-

cient ants to mount a defense   

Keeler’s model represents the plant’s costs of mutualism as:

IA 5 n[m 1 d (a 1 c 1 h)]   

 where:

   n  5  the number of extrafloral nectaries per plant  
  m  5  the energy content of nectary structures  
  d  5   the period of time during which the nectaries 

are active  

  a  5  costs of producing amino acids in nectar  
  c  5  costs of producing the carbohydrates in nectar  
  h  5  costs of providing water for nectar    

 Again,  Keeler’s  hypothesis  is  that  for  mutualism  to   persist, 
benefits must exceed costs. In terms of her model:

   p[H(1 2 D)A] > IA 

This model proposes that for a facultative ant-plant mutualism 
to evolve and persist, the proportion of the plant’s energy bud-
get that ants save from destruction by herbivores must exceed 
the proportion of the plant’s energy budget that is invested in 
extrafloral nectaries and nectar. 

 The  details  of  Keeler’s  model  offer  insights  into  what 
conditions may produce higher benefits than costs. First, and 
most obviously, I A , the proportion of the plant’s energy bud-
get that is invested in extrafloral nectaries and nectar should 
be low. This means that plants living on a tight energy budget, 
for example, plants living in a shady forest understory, should 
be less likely to invest in attracting ants than those living in 
full sun. Higher benefits result from (1) a high probability of 
attracting ants—that is, high p; (2) a high potential for her-
bivory, H; (3) low effectiveness of alternative defenses, low 
D, and (4) highly effective ant defense, high A. 

 The  task  for  ecologists  is  to  determine  how  well  these 
requirements of the model match values of these variables in 
nature.

1.   Suppose  you  discover  a  mutant  form  of   Helianthella 
quinquenervis  that does not produce extrafloral nectar-
ies. What  does  Keller’s  theory  predict  concerning  the 
relative  fitness  of  these  mutant  plants  and  the  typical 
ones that produce extrafloral nectaries?  

2.   According to Keller’s theory, under what general con-
ditions  would  the  mutant   Helianthella  quinquenervis,
lacking extrafloral nectaries, increase in frequency in a 
population and displace the typical plants that produce 
extrafloral nectaries?

 Mutualism and Humans 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 15.18  Describe the guiding behavior of the greater honey 
guide, particularly the information conveyed by the 
bird to humans, as traditionally understood by the 
Boran people of East Africa.

 15.19  Summarize the mutual benefits between humans and 

the greater honey guide.

 15.20  Explain the experimental and observational evi-

dence in support of the traditional understanding of 
guiding behavior by the greater honey guide.

 Mutualism has been important in the lives and livelihood of 
humans for a long time. Historically, much of agriculture has 
depended upon mutualistic associations between species and 
much of agricultural management has been aimed at enhanc-
ing mutualisms, such as nitrogen fixation, mycorrhizae, and 
pollination to improve crop production. Agriculture itself has 
been  viewed  as  a  mutualistic  relationship  between  humans 
and crop and livestock species. However, there may be some 
qualitative differences between agriculture, as it has been gen-
erally practiced, and mutualisms among other species. How 
much  of  agriculture  is  pure  exploitation  and  how  much  is 
truly mutualistic remains an open question. 

 There is, however, at least one human mutualism that fits 
comfortably among the earlier discussions in this chapter, a 
mutualism involving communication between humans and a 
wild species with clear benefit to both. This mutualism joins 
the traditional honey gatherers of Africa with the greater honey-
guide,   Indicator  indicator   ( fig.  15.22 ).  Honey  gathering  has 
long been an important aspect of African cultures, important 
enough  that  there  are  scenes  of  honey  gathering  in  rock  art 
painted  over  20,000  years  ago  (Isack  and  Reyer  1989).  No 
one knows how long humans have gathered honey in Africa, 
but  it  is  difficult  to  imagine  the  earliest  hominids  resisting 
such  sweet  temptation.  Whenever  honey  gathering  began, 
humans have apparently had a capable and energetic partner 
in their searches.         

  Guiding Behavior 
 The mutualistic association between humans and honeyguides 
may have developed from an earlier association between the 
bird  and  the  ratel,  or  honey  badger,   Mellivora  capensis.  The 
honey badger is a powerful animal, well equipped with strong 
claws and powerful muscles to rip open bees’ nests, that readily 
follows honeyguides to bees’ nests. The honey badger, though 
secretive,  has  been  observed  often  following   honeyguides 
while  vocalizing.  African  honey   gatherers  also  vocalize  to 
attract honeyguides, and Friedmann (1955) reported that some 
of their vocalizations imitate the calls of honey badgers. 

 The  most  detailed  and  quantitative  study  of  this  mutual-
ism to date is that of H. Isack of the National Museum of Kenya 
and H.-U. Reyer of the University of Zurich (Isack and Reyer 
1989), who studied the details of the interaction of the greater 
honeyguide with the Boran people of northern Kenya. The Boran 
regularly follow honeyguides and have developed a penetrating 
whistle that they use to attract them. The whistle can be heard 
over 1 km away, and Isack and Reyer found that it doubles the 
rate at which Boran honey gatherers encounter honeyguides. If 
they are successful in attracting a honeyguide, the average amount 
of time it takes to find a bees’ nest is 3.2 hours. Without the aid 
of a  honeyguide the average search time per bees’ nest is about 
8.9  hours. This  is  an  underestimate  of  the  true  time,  however, 
since  Isack  and  Reyer  did  not  include  days  in  which  no  bees’ 
nests were found in their analysis. The benefit of the association 
to the bird seems apparent from Isack and Reyer’s analysis, since 
they report that 96% of the nests to which the Boran were guided 
would have been inaccessible to the birds without human help.

  Mutualism

 The greater honeyguide attracts the attention of a human 
by flying close and calling as it does so. Following this initial 
attention-getting behavior, the bird will fly off in a particular 
direction and disappears for up to 1 minute. After reappearing, 
the  bird  again  perches  in  a  conspicuous  spot  and  calls  to  the 
following humans. As the honey gatherers follow, they whis-
tle, bang on wood, and talk loudly in order to “keep the bird 
interested.” When the honey gatherers approach the perch from 
which the honeyguide is calling, the bird again flies off, call-
ing and displaying its white tail feathers as it does so, only to 
reappear at another conspicuous perch a short time later. This 
sequence of leading, following, and leading is repeated until the 
bird and the following honey gatherers arrive at the bees’ nest. 
 Isack, who is a Boran, interviewed Boran honey gather-
ers  to  determine  what  information  they  obtained  from  hon-
eyguides. The main purpose of the study was to test assertions 
by the honey gatherers that the bird informs them of (1) the 
direction  to  the  bees’  nest,  (2)  the  distance  to  the  nest,  and 
(3) when they arrive at the location of the nest. The data gath-
ered by Isack and Reyer support all three assertions. 

 Honey gatherers reported that the bird indicated direction 
to the bees’ nest on the basis of the direction of its guiding 
flights. One method used by Isack and Reyer to test how well 
flight direction indicated direction was to induce honeyguides 
to guide them from the same starting point to the same known 

The paths taken by a honeyguide

them  to  a  bees’  nest  from  seven  different  starting  points 
( fig. 15.23 b  ). The result was a consistent tendency by the bird 
to lead directly to the site of the bees’ nest.     

 The  Boran  honey  gatherers  said  that  three  variables 
decrease  as  distance  to  the  nest  decreases:  (1)  the  time  the 
bird stays out of sight during its first disappearance follow-
ing the initial encounter, (2) the distance between stops made 
by the bird on the way to the bees’ nest, and (3) the height of 
the perch on the way to the nest. Data gathered by Isack and 
Reyer support all three statements ( fig. 15.24 ).   

Honeyguide stays in sight longer if it 
begins guiding far from a bees, nest.

Section IV 

 

Interactions

After arriving at a bees’ nest, the honeyguide 
gives a few distinctive indication calls and 
then perches silently near the nest.

On the way to a bees’ nest a 
honeyguide uses a particular call 
and responds to a human voice 
by increasing call frequency.

 Figure 15.25   Vocal communication between honeyguides and humans.

 The  honey  gatherers  also  report  that  they  can  deter-
mine  when  they  arrive  in  the  vicinity  of  a  bees’  nest  by 
changes  in  the  honeyguide’s  behavior  and  vocalizations 
( fig.  15.25 ).  Isack  and  Reyer  observed  several  of  these 
changes.  While  on  the  path  to  a  bees’  nest  a  honeyguide 
emits a distinctive guiding call and will answer human calls 
by  increasing  the  frequency  of  the  guiding  call.  On  arriv-
ing  at  a  nest,  the  honeyguide  perches  close  to  the  nest  and 
gives  off  a  special  “indication”  call. After  a  few  indication 
calls, it remains silent and does not answer to human sounds. 
If  approached  by  a  honey  gatherer,  a  honeyguide  flies 
in  a  circle  around  the  nest  location  before  perching  again 
nearby.     

 Isack and Reyer observe that their data do not allow them 
to test other statements by the Boran honey gatherers, including 
that when bees’ nests are very far away (over 2 km) the honey-
guide will “deceive” the gatherers about the real distance to the 
nest by stopping at shorter intervals. Isack and Reyer add, how-
ever, that they have no reason to doubt these other statements, 
since all others have been supported by the data they were able 
to collect. What these data reveal is a rich mutualistic interaction 
between wild birds and humans. The results of Isack and Reyer’s 
study caused Robert May (1989) to wonder how much important 
ecological knowledge may reside with the dwindling groups of 
native people living in the tropical regions of the world, regions 
about which the field of ecology has so little information.     

   Summary 

  Mutualism,  interactions between individuals that benefit both 
partners, is a common phenomenon in nature that has appar-
ently made important contributions to the evolutionary history 
of  life  and  continues  to  make  key  contributions  to  the  eco-
logical integrity of the biosphere. Mutualisms can be divided 
into those that are  facultative,  where species can live without 
their mutualistic partners, and  obligate,  where species are so 
dependent on the mutualistic relationship that they cannot live 
without their mutualistic partners. 

  Plants  benefit  from  mutualistic  partnerships  with 
a  wide  variety  of  bacteria,  fungi,  and  animals.   Mutu-
alism  provides  benefits  to  plants  ranging  from  nitrogen 
fixation and enhanced nutrient and water uptake to pollina-
tion and seed dispersal. Ninety percent of terrestrial plants 
form  mutualistic  relationships  with  mycorrhizal  fungi, 
which make substantial contributions to plant performance. 

Mycorrhizae,  which  are  mostly  either  vesicular-arbuscular 
mycorrhizae  or  ectomycorrhizae,  are  important  in  increas-
ing  plant  access  to  water,  nitrogen,  phosphorus,  and  other 
nutrients. In return for these nutrients, mycorrhizae receive 
energy-rich root exudates. Experiments have shown that the 
mutualistic  balance  sheet  between  plants  and  mycorrhizal 
fungi  can  be  altered  by  the  availability  of  nutrients.  Plant-
ant  protection  mutualisms  are  found  in  both   tropical  and 
 temperate  environments.  In  tropical  environments,  many 
plants  provide  ants  with  food  and  shelter  in  exchange  for 
protection  from  a  variety  of  natural  enemies.  In  temperate 
environments, mutualistic plants provide ants with food but 
not shelter in trade for protection. 

  Reef-building  corals  depend  upon  mutualistic  rela-
tionships  with  algae  and  animals,  with  an  exchange  of 
benefits  paralleling  those  between  terrestrial  mutualists.  

 

Chapter 15 

  Mutualism 

351

The coral-centered mutualisms of tropical seas show striking 
parallels with terrestrial plant-centered mutualisms. Mutu-
alistic  algae  called  zooxanthellae  provide  reef-building  cor-
als  with  their  principal  energy  source;  in  exchange  for  this 
energy,  corals  provide  zooxanthellae  with  nutrients,  espe-
cially nitrogen, a scarce resource in tropical seas. The mutual-
ism  between  corals  and  zooxanthellae  appears  to  be  largely 
under the control of the coral partner, which chemically solic-
its the release of organic compounds from zooxanthellae and 
controls zooxanthellae population growth. Crabs and shrimp 
protect some coral species from coral predators in exchange 
for food and shelter. 

  Theory  predicts  that  mutualism  will  evolve  where 
the benefits of mutualism exceed the costs.   Keeler built 
a  cost-benefit  model  for  the  evolution  and  persistence  of 
 facultative  plant-ant  protection  mutualisms  in  which  the 
benefits  of  the  mutualism  to  the  plant  are  represented  in 
terms of the proportion of the plant’s energy budget that ants 
protect from damage by herbivores. The model assesses the 

costs of the mutualism to the plant in terms of the proportion 
of the plant’s energy budget invested in extrafloral nectaries 
and the water, carbohydrates, and amino acids contained in 
the  nectar.  The  model  predicts  that  the  mutualism  will  be 
favored  where  there  are  high  densities  of  ants  and  poten-
tial  herbivores  and  where  the  effectiveness  of  alternative 
defenses is low. 

 Humans have developed a variety of mutualistic relation-
ships  with  other  species,  but  one  of  the  most  spectacular  is 
that between the greater honeyguide and the traditional honey 
gatherers  of  Africa.  In  this  apparently  ancient  mutualism, 
humans  and  honeyguides  engage  in  elaborate  communica-
tion and cooperation with clear benefit to both partners. The 
mutualism offers the human side a higher rate of discovery of 
bees’ nests, while the honeyguide gains access to nests that it 
could not raid without human help. Careful observations have 
documented that the honeyguide informs the honey gatherers 
of the direction and distance to bees’ nests as well as of their 
arrival at the nest.

  Review Questions 

     1.  List and briefly describe mutualistic relationships that seem to 

contribute to the ecological integrity of the biosphere.  

    2.  What  contributions  do  mycorrhizal  fungi  make  to  their  plant 
partners? What  do  plants  contribute  in  return  for  the  services 
of mycorrhizal fungi? How did Hardie (1985) demonstrate that 
mycorrhizae improve the water balance of red clover? How do 
mycorrhizae  improve  the  capacity  of  plants  to  take  up  water 
from their environment?  

    3.  Outline the experiments of Johnson (1993), which she designed 
to test the possibility that artificial fertilizers may select for less 
mutualistic  mycorrhizal  fungi.  What  evidence  does  Johnson 
present in support of her hypothesis?  

    4.  Explain how mycorrhizal fungi may have evolved from ances-
tors  that  were  originally  parasites  of  plant  roots.  Do  any  of 
Johnson’s results (1993) indicate that present-day mycorrhizal 
fungi may act as parasites? Be specific.  

    5.  Janzen (1985) encouraged ecologists to take a more experimen-
tal approach to the study of mutualistic relationships. Outline 
the details of Janzen’s own experiments on the mutualistic rela-
tionship between swollen thorn acacias and ants.  

    6.  Inouye  and Taylor’s  study  (1979)  of  the  relationship  between 
ants and the aspen sunflower,  Helianthella quinquenervis,  pro-
vides  a  reasonable  representative  of  temperate  ant-plant  pro-
tection  mutualisms.  Compare  this  mutualism  with  that  of  the 
tropical mutualism between swollen thorn acacias and ants.  

    7.  How  are  coral-centered  mutualisms  similar  to  plant-centered 
mutualisms?  How  are  they  different? The  exchanges  between 
mutualistic  partners  in  both  systems  revolve  around  energy, 
nutrients,  and  protection.  Is  this  an  accident  of  the  cases  dis-
cussed or are these key factors in the lives of organisms?  

    8.  Outline  the  benefits  and  costs  identified  by  Keeler’s  (1981, 
1985)  cost-benefit  model  for  facultative  ant-plant  mutualism. 
From what perspective does Keeler’s model view this mutual-
ism? From the perspective of plant or ant? What would be some 
of  the  costs  and  benefits  to  consider  if  the  model  were  built 
from the perspective of the other partner?  

    9.  How could you change the Lotka-Volterra model of competi-
tion  we  discussed  in  chapter  13  into  a  model  of  mutualism? 
Would the resulting model be a cost-benefit model or a popula-
tion dynamic model?  

   10.  Outline  how  the  honeyguide-human  mutualism  could  have 
evolved  from  an  earlier  mutualism  between  honeyguides  and 
honey  badgers.  In  many  parts  of  Africa  today,  people  have 
begun to abandon traditional honey gathering in favor of keep-
ing domestic bees and have also begun to substitute refined sug-
ars  bought  at  the  market  for  the  honey  of  wild  bees.  Explain 
how, under these circumstances, natural selection might elimi-
nate guiding behavior in populations of the greater honeyguide. 
(In  areas  where  honey  gathering  is  no  longer  practiced,  the 
greater honeyguide no longer guides people to bees’ nests.)

  D ifferent areas within the same region may differ sub-

stantially in the number of species they support. Vast 
areas of flat or gently sloping land in the hot deserts 
of North America are dominated by a single species of shrub, 
the creosote bush,  Larrea tridentata.  While grasses and forbs 
grow  in  the  spaces  between  these  shrubs,  creosote  bushes 
make up most of the plant biomass. In these areas, you can 
travel many kilometers and see only subtle changes in a land-
scape dominated by a single species of plant ( fig. 16.1 ).       

 The uniformity of the creosote flats contrasts sharply with 
the  biological  diversity  of  other  places  in  these  hot  deserts 
( fig. 16.2 ). For instance, a rich variety of plant life-forms covers 

 

Chapter 16 

  Species Abundance and Diversity 

353

 In chapters 13 to 15 we focused on competition,  predation, 
and  mutualism  between  pairs  of  species.  We  now  consider 
patterns  and  processes  that  involve  a  larger  number  of  spe-
cies. With this shift in focus, we enter the realm of community 
ecology. A     community    is an association of interacting species 
inhabiting some defined area. Ecologists may study the plant 
community on a mountainside, the insect community associ-
ated with a particular species of tree, or the fish  community 
on a coral reef. The key point here is that communities gener-
ally consist of many species that potentially interact in all of 
the ways discussed in chapters 13 to 15. 

 Community  ecologists  seek  to  understand  how  various 
abiotic  and  biotic  aspects  of  the  environment  influence  the 
structure  of  communities.      Community  structure     includes 
attributes  such  as  the  number  of  species,  the  relative  abun-
dance  of  species,  and  the  kinds  of  species  comprising  a 
community. 

 Because it is difficult to study large numbers of species, 
most  community  ecologists  work  with  restricted  groups  of 
organisms, focusing, for example, on communities of plants, 
mammals,  or  insects.  Some  community  ecologists  restrict 
their focus even more by studying guilds of species. A     guild    
is a group of organisms that all make their living in a similar 
way. Examples of guilds include the seed-eating animals in an 
area of desert, the fruit-eating birds in a tropical rain forest, 
and the filter-feeding invertebrates in a stream. Some guilds 
consist  of  closely  related  species,  whereas  others  are  taxo-
nomically heterogeneous. For instance, the fruit-eating birds 
on  many  South  Pacific  islands  consist  mainly  of  pigeons, 
whereas the seed-eating guild in the Sonoran Desert includes 
mammals, birds, and ants. 

 The  main  users  of  the  guild  concept  have  been  animal 
ecologists.  Similar  terms  used  by  botanists  are      life-form     or 
growth  form.  The  life-form  of  a  plant  is  a  combination  of 
its  structure  and  its  growth  dynamics.  Plant  life-forms  have 
been classified in various ways and we have used an informal 
classification since chapter 1, where we discussed life-forms 
such as trees, vines, annual plants, sclerophylous vegetation, 
grasses, and forbs. 

 Like  the  members  of  an  animal  guild,  plants  of  similar 
life-form exploit the environment in similar ways. As a conse-
quence, plant community ecologists have often concentrated 
their attention on plants of similar life-form by studying the 
ecology  of  tree,  herb,  or  shrub  communities.  By  studying 
animal guilds or plant life-forms, ecologists focus their ener-
gies on a manageable and coherent portion of the community, 
manageable  in  terms  of  number  of  species  and  coherent  in 
terms of ecological requirements. 

 In  1959,  G.  Evelyn  Hutchinson  wrote  a  paper  with  the 
captivating title, “Homage to Santa Rosalia or Why Are There 
So  Many  Kinds  of  Animals?”  This  paper  stimulated  gen-
erations of ecologists to explore biological diversity. One of 
the  most  fundamental  questions  that  we  still  address  today 
is  what  controls  the  number  and  relative  abundance  of  spe-
cies  in  communities.  These  two  properties  are  the  focus  of 
chapter 16.

Organ Pipe  Cactus National Monument in southern Arizona. 
Here grow ocotillo, consisting of several slender branches 2 
to 3 m tall springing from a common base, palo verde trees 
with  green  bark  and  tiny  leaves,  and  mesquite,  which  reach 
the  size  of  medium-sized  trees.  In  addition,  there  are  cactus 
such as the low-growing prickly pears and the shrublike teddy 
bear chollas. The most striking are the column-shaped squat 
barrel cactus, the organ pipe cactus, with its densely packed 
slender columns, and the saguaro, a massive cactus that towers 
over all the other plant species. Among these larger plants also 
grow a wide variety of small shrubs, grasses, and forbs.     

 The creosote flats, dominated by one species of shrub, con-
vey an impression of great uniformity. The vegetation of Organ 
Pipe Cactus National Monument, consisting of a large number 
of species of many different growth forms, gives the impres-
sion of high diversity. The ecologist is prompted to ask what 
factors  control  this  difference  in  diversity.  Joseph  McAuliffe 
(1994) has been able to explain much of the variation in woody 
plant diversity and dominance by  L. tridentata  across Sonoran 
Desert landscapes by differences in soil age, frequency of dis-
turbance by erosion, and soil depth (see chapter 21).

   16.1  Species Abundance 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 16.3  Construct a grid for plotting a lognormal distribu-

tion, paying particular attention to the labeling of the 
x-axis and y-axis.

 16.4  Summarize evidence that the relative abundances 
of a wide variety of organisms approximates a log-
normal distribution.

Most species are moderately abundant; few are very abun-
dant or extremely rare.   The relative abundance of species 
is one of the most fundamental aspects of community struc-
ture.  This  property  is  so  fundamental  that  George  Sugihara 
(1980) referred to it as “minimal community structure.” We 
began our discussion of the abundance of species in chapter 9, 
where  we  explored  the  relationship  between  body  size  and 
abundance and considered the various forms of rarity. In this 
section, we expand our perspective by addressing the follow-
ing  question: What  will  you  find  if  you  go  out  into  a  com-
munity and quantify the abundance of species within a group 
of  taxonomically  or  ecologically  related  organisms  such  as 
beetles, birds, shrubs, or diatoms? 

 It turns out that there are regularities in the relative abun-
dance of species in communities that hold, whether you exam-
ine plants in a forest, moths in that forest, or algae inhabiting a 
nearby stream. If you thoroughly sample groups of organisms 
such as these, you will come across a few abundant species 
and a few that are very rare. Most species will be moderately 
abundant. This pattern was first quantified by Frank Preston 
(1948, 1962a, 1962b), who carefully studied the relative abun-
dance of species in collections and communities. The “distri-
bution of commonness and rarity” among species described 
by Preston is one of the best documented patterns in natural 
communities.  

   The Lognormal Distribution 
 How  do  we  think  about  the  abundance  of  organisms?  Pres-
ton  suggested  that  we  think  of  abundance  in  relative  terms 
and  say,  for  example,  that  one  species  is  twice  as  abundant 
as  another.  This  common  way  of  expressing  relative  abun-
dance led Preston to graph the abundance of species in collec-
tions as frequency distributions, where the classes of species 
abundance were intervals of 1–2, 2–4, 4–8, 8–16, etc., indi-
viduals. Preston made each interval twice the preceding one 
and plotted them on a log 2  scale (e.g., log 2  of 1  5  0, log 2  of 
2  5  1, log 2  of 4  5  2, etc.). Preston’s graphs plot log 2  of spe-
cies abundance against the number of species in each abun-
dance  interval. When  the  relative  abundance  of  species  was 
plotted in this way, he consistently obtained results like those 
shown in  figure 16.3 .   

  Figure 16.3 a   shows the relative abundance of  desert plants. 
Robert Whittaker (1965) plotted these abundances using cov-
erage  rather  than  numbers  of  individuals,  which  correlates

with our discussions in chapter 9 of how to represent the rela-
tive abundance of plants. Notice that few species were repre-
sented by more than 8% cover or less than 0.15% cover. Most 
species  had  intermediate  coverage.  Whittaker’s  plot  shows 
the  most  distinctive  feature  of  Preston’s   distributions—that 
is, they are approximately “bell-shaped,” or “normal.” Such a 
distribution is called a     lognormal distribution.    

  Figure  16.3 b    shows  the  relative  abundance  of  86  spe-
cies of birds breeding near Westerville, Ohio, over a 10-year 
period (Preston 1962a). Notice that few species were repre-
sented by over 64 individuals or by a single individual. Like 
Whittaker’s plants, most species showed intermediate levels 
of abundance, producing another lognormal distribution. 

 In most lognormal distributions, only a portion of a bell-
shaped curve is apparent. For instance, neither  figure 16.4 a   nor 
16.4 b  presents a complete normal curve. However,   figure 16.4 b,
a sample of moths from Lethbridge, Alberta, comes closer to a 
complete curve. Preston suggested that much of the difference 
between  the  two  curves  results  from  a  difference  in  sample

  Concept 16.1 Review 

      1.   Why do smaller samples result in only part of the bell-
shaped  curve  that  is  characteristic  of  the  lognormal 
distribution?  

     2.   Why did the massive sampling efforts associated with 
the moth collections shown in  figure 16.4  reveal only a 
portion of the lognormal distribution, while the studies 
of birds and plants produced the nearly complete log-
normal distributions shown in  figure 16.3 ?       

  16.2  Species Diversity 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 16.5  Distinguish between species richness and species 

evenness.

 16.6  Calculate a Shannon-Wiener diversity index, H′.
 16.7 
Interpret species rank-abundance curves for con-
trasting communities.

   A combination of the number of species and their relative 
abundance defines species diversity.   Ecologists define     spe-
cies diversity    on the basis of two factors: (1) the number of 
species in the community, which ecologists usually call      species 
richness,    and (2) the relative abundance of species, or     species 
evenness.     The  influence  of  species  richness  on  community 
diversity is clear. A community with 20 species is obviously 
less  diverse  than  one  with  80  species. The  effects  of  species 
evenness on diversity are more subtle but easily illustrated. 

  Figure  16.5   contrasts  two  hypothetical  forest  commu-
nities.  Both  forests  contain  five  tree  species,  so  they  have 
equal  levels  of  species  richness.  However,  community   b   is 
more diverse than community  a  because its species evenness 
is higher. In community  b,  all five species are equally abun-
dant, each comprising 20% of the tree community. In contrast, 
84% of the individuals in community  a  belong to one species, 
while  each  of  the  remaining  species  constitutes  only  4%  of 
the community. On a walk through the two forests, you would 
almost certainly form an impression of higher species diver-
sity in community  b,  despite equal levels of species richness 
in the two forests. That impression can be quantified.      

   A Quantitative Index 
of Species Diversity 
 Ecologists have developed many indices of species diversity, 
the  values  of  which  depend  upon  levels  of  species  richness 
and evenness. Let’s apply one of the commonly used indices 
of species diversity to our hypothetical forest communities. 

 A commonly applied measure of species diversity is the 

Shannon-Wiener index:

  s

H′ = −  ∑ 
     pi loge pi 
  
  i = 1

Preston 1948). 

size. While  the  sample  of  moths  from  Saskatoon  contained 
approximately  87,000  individuals  belonging  to  277   species, 
the  sample  from  Lethbridge  contained  an  incredible 
303,251  individuals belonging to 291 species. If the sample 
from Saskatoon had contained 300,000 individuals, it would 
have  contained  more  species,  producing  a  more  complete 
lognormal  curve.  Ecologists  have  found  that  the  more  you 
sample  a  community,  the  more  species  you  will  find.  The 
common species show up in even small samples, but a great 
deal of sampling effort is needed to capture the rare species.   

 So,  how  do  we  explain  the  lognormal  distribution  of 
commonness and rarity? Robert May (1975) proposed that the 
lognormal distribution is the product of many random envi-
ronmental variables acting upon the populations of many spe-
cies. In other words, the lognormal distribution is a statistical 
expectation. 

 Is the lognormal distribution just a mathematical artifact 
or does it reflect important biological processes? Building on 
the  pioneering  studies  of  Robert  MacArthur  (1957,  1960), 
George Sugihara (1980) suggested that the lognormal distri-
bution  is  a  consequence  of  the  species  within  a  community 
subdividing  niche  space.  However,  regardless  of  its  origins, 
the lognormal distribution is important because it allows us to 
predict the distribution of abundance among species. As we 
shall see in chapter 22, the lognormal distribution has led to 
other valuable insights into the organization of nature.

  Communities and Ecosystems

Communities a and b both contain five 
tree species.  However, because 
community b has greater species 
evenness, it has higher species diversity.

Community a is dominated by 
one of its five species and so has 
lower species diversity than…

…community b, which has 
the same five species but in 
equal proportions.

   s   5  the number of species in the community    

 To calculate  H  9 , determine the proportions of each species in 
the study community, pi, and the log  e   of each  p   i  . Next, mul-
tiply each  p   i   times log  e    p   i   and sum the results for all species 
from species 1 to species s, where  s   5  the number of  species 
in the community, that is:

Since this sum will be a negative number, the Shannon- Wiener 
index calls for taking its opposite, that is: 

 s
−  ∑ 
  
       
  i = 1

The minimum value of  H  9  is 0, which is the value of  H  9  for 
a community with a single species, and increases as species 
richness and species evenness increase. 

  Table 16.1  shows how to calculate  H  9  for our two hypo-
thetical  forest  communities.  The  different  values  of   H  9   for 
the  two  communities  reflect  the  difference  in  species  even-
ness that we see when we compare the two forests depicted in 
 figure 16.5 .  H  9  for community  b,  the community with higher 
species evenness, is 1.610, while  H  9  for community  a  is 0.662. 
We can also use a graph to contrast communities  a  and  b.

curve     provides  us  with  important  information  about  a  com-
munity,  information  accessible  at  a  glance.   Figure  16.6   plots 
the abundance rank of each tree species in communities  a  and 
 b   (see   fig.  16.5 )  against  its  proportional  abundance. The  rank-
abundance curve for community  b  shows that all five species are 
equally abundant, while the rank-abundance curve for commu-
nity  a  shows its dominance by the most abundant tree species.

by the rank-abundance curves for two actual animal communi-
ties.  Figure 16.7  shows rank-abundance curves for the Trichop-
tera (insects called caddisflies that have an aquatic larval stage)

emerging from two kinds of aquatic habitat in northern Portugal. 
The trichopteran community in coastal ponds at Mira contains 
about 18 species, while the mountain stream community at Relva 
includes 79 species. In addition, a few abundant species dominate 
the coastal pond community, while the mountain stream commu-
nity shows a more even distribution of individuals among spe-
cies. This difference in species evenness is shown by the much 
steeper rank-abundance curve for the coastal pond community.   
 Two reef fish communities from the Gulf of California pro-
vide a more subtle contrast in rank-abundance patterns. The reef 
fish  communities  yielded  approximately  similar  numbers  of 
species (52 versus 57) but differed substantially in species even-
ness. The community of the central Gulf of California showed 
a  more  even  distribution  of  individuals  among  species.  This 
greater  evenness  is  depicted  in   figure  16.8 ,  which  shows  that 
after about the tenth most abundant species, the rank-abundance 
curve for the central Gulf of California lies above the curve for 
the northern Gulf. Rank-abundance curves will provide a useful 
representation of community structure in later discussions.     

  Concept 16.2 Review 

      1.   Pollution of streams generally reduces the diversity of 
Trichoptera  (see   fig.  16.7 ),  and  several  other  groups 
of stream insects, by reducing both species richness and 
species evenness. Why?  

     2.   Suppose you sample an area and find the five species 
of forest trees listed in  table 16.1  in the following pro-
portions: 0.35, 0.25, 0.15, 0.15, and 0.10. What is the 
 Shannon-Wiener  diversity  of  this  community,   c,   com-
pared to communities  a  and  b  in  Table 16.1 ?

birds and those of algae and plants.

 16.12  Design a study to test your hypothesis to explain the 

generally found negative relationship between soil 
fertility and richness of plants and mycorrhizal fungi.

Species diversity is higher in complex environments.   How 
does environmental structure affect species diversity? This is 
one of the most fundamental questions we can ask about com-
munities.  In  general,  species  diversity  increases  with  envi-
ronmental  complexity  or  heterogeneity.  However,  an  aspect 
of environmental structure important to one group of organ-
isms  may  not  have  a  positive  influence  on  another  group.

Consequently, you must know something about the ecological 
requirements of species to predict how environmental struc-
ture  affects  their  diversity.  In  other  words,  you  must  know 
something about their niches.  

   Forest Complexity 
and Bird Species Diversity 
 In chapter 13, we saw that competition can significantly influ-
ence the niches of species. If competition acts to produce diver-
gence in the niches of species, what would you expect to find 
if  you  characterized  the  niches  of  closely  related,  coexisting 
species? The competitive exclusion principle (see chapter 13) 
leads  us  to  predict  that  coexisting  species  will  have  signifi-
cantly different niches. As we saw in chapter 1, that is precisely 
what Robert MacArthur (1958) found when he examined the 
ecology  of  five  species  of  warblers  that  live  together  in  the 
forests of northeastern North America (see fig. 1.3). 

 What does MacArthur’s study of warbler niches have to 
do  with  the  influence  of  environmental  complexity  on  spe-
cies  diversity?  MacArthur’s  results  suggest  that  since  these 
species  forage  in  different  vegetative  strata,  their  distribu-
tions may be influenced by variation in the vertical structure 
of vegetation. He explored this possibility on Mount Desert 
Island,  Maine,  where  he  measured  the  relationship  between 
volume of vegetation above 6 m and the abundance of war-
blers ( fig. 16.9 ). The number of warbler species at the study 
sites increased with forest stature. The study sites with greater 
volume of vegetation above 6 m supported more warbler spe-
cies. In other words, MacArthur found that warbler diversity 
increased  as  the  stature  of  the  vegetation  increased.  These 
results formed the foundation of later studies of how foliage 
height diversity influences bird species diversity.     

 MacArthur  was  one  of  the  first  ecologists  to  quantify 
the  relationship  between  species  diversity  and  environmen-
tal  heterogeneity.  He  quantified  the  diversity  of  species  and 

The number of warbler 
species and their overall 
abundance increased

the complexity of the environment using the Shannon-Wiener 
index,  H  9 . He measured environmental complexity as foliage 
height diversity, which increased with the number of vegeta-
tive  layers  and  with  an  even  distribution  of  vegetative  bio-
mass  among  three  vertical  layers,  0  to  0.6  m,  0.6  to  7.6  m, 
and >7.6 m. MacArthur’s foliage height diversity, like species 
diversity,  increases  with  richness  (the  number  of  vegetative 
layers) and evenness (how evenly vegetative biomass is dis-
tributed among layers). 

 Robert MacArthur and John MacArthur (1961) measured 
foliage height diversity and bird species diversity in 13 plant 
communities  in  northeastern  North  America,  Florida,  and 
Panama. The vegetative communities included in their study 
ranged from grassland to mature deciduous forest, with foli-
age  height  diversity  that  ranged  from  0.043  to  1.093.  Plant 
communities with greater foliage height diversity supported 
more diverse bird communities ( fig. 16.10 ). MacArthur and 
his  colleagues  went  on  to  study  the  relationship  between 
foliage height diversity and bird species diversity in a wide 
variety of temperate, tropical, and island settings, from North 
America to Australia. They again found a positive correlation 
between  foliage  height  diversity  and  bird  species  diversity. 
The combined weight of the evidence from North and Cen-
tral America  and Australia  suggests  that  the  relationship  is 
not one of chance, but instead reflects something about the 
way that birds in these environments subdivide space.     

 How is environmental complexity related to the diversity 
of  other  organisms  besides  birds?  Ecological  studies  have 
shown  positive  relationships  between  environmental  com-
plexity and species diversity for many groups of organisms, 
including  mammals,  lizards,  plankton,  marine  gastropods, 
and reef fish. Notice, however, that this list of organisms is 
dominated by animals. How does environmental complexity 
affect diversity of plants?

 Estimating the Number of Species in Communities 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 16.13  Explain the difficulties involved in trying to estimate 

the total number of species in a community.

 16.14  Discuss ways to reduce the effort necessary for 

making a comparison of the relative species rich-
ness of communities.

 How many species are there? This is one of the most fundamen-
tal questions that an ecologist can ask about a community. With 
increasing threats to biological diversity, species richness is also 
one of the most important community attributes we might mea-
sure.  For  instance,  estimates  of  species  richness  are  critical  for 
determining  areas  suitable  for  conservation,  for  diagnosing  the 
impact of environmental change on a community, or for identify-
ing critical habitat for rare or threatened species. However, deter-
mining  the  number  of  species  in  a  community  is  not  a  simple 
undertaking.  Sound  estimates  of  species  richness  for  most  taxa 
require a carefully designed, standardized sampling program. Here 
we will review some of the basic factors that an ecologist needs to 
consider when designing such a sampling program to gather infor-
mation about species richness within and among communities. 

  Sampling Effort 
 The number of species recorded in a sample of a community 
increases with higher sampling effort. We reviewed a highly 
simplified example of this in chapter 6 (see p. 136), where we 
considered how numbers of quadrats influenced estimates of 
species richness in the benthic community of a small Rocky 
Mountain  stream.  In  that  example,  a  relatively  small  sample 
size was required. However, often far more effort is required. 
For  example,  Petri  Martikainen  and  Jari  Kouki  (2003)  esti-
mated that to verify the presence or absence of threatened bee-
tle species in the boreal forests of Finland required a sample 
of over 400 beetle species. They also suggested that a sample 
of over 100,000 individual beetles may be required to assess 
just 10 forest areas in Finland for their suitability to serve as 
conservation areas for threatened beetle species. To reduce the 
sampling effort required to estimate species richness, commu-
nity ecologists and conservationists often focus on groups of 
organisms that are reliable indicators of species richness.  

  Indicator Taxa 
 Because of the great cost and time of making thorough inventories 
of species diversity, ecologists have proposed a wide variety of taxa 
as  indicators  of  overall  biological  diversity.  Indicator  taxa  have 
generally been well-known and conspicuous groups of organisms 
such as birds and butterflies. However, it appears that indicator 
taxa need to be chosen with caution. For example, John Lawton 
of  Imperial  College  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  12  colleagues 

(Lawton et al. 1998) attempted to characterize biological diversity 
along a disturbance gradient in the tropical forest of Cameroon, 
Africa, using indicator taxa. In addition to birds and butterflies, 
Lawton and his colleagues sampled flying beetles, beetles living 
in  the  forest  canopy,  canopy  ants,  leaf-litter  ants,  termites,  and 
soil  nematodes.  They  sampled  these  taxa  from  1992  to  1994 
and spent several more years sorting and cataloging the approxi-
mately 2,000 species collected. This work required approximately 
10,000 s cientist hours. Unfortunately, the conclusion at the end 
of this massive study was that no one group serves as a reliable 
indicator  of  species  richness  for  other  taxonomic  groups.  Law-
ton and his colleagues estimated that their survey included from 
 one-tenth  to  one-hundredth  the  total  number  of  species  in  their 
study site. Citing their own experience, they concluded that char-
acterizing the full biological diversity of just 1 hectare of tropical 
forest would require from 100,000 to 1 million scientist hours. As 
a consequence of these time constraints, ecologists will likely con-
tinue to focus their studies of diversity on smaller groups of taxa. 
However, even with a restricted taxonomic focus, it is important to 
standardize sampling across study communities.  

  Standardized Sampling 
 Standardizing  sampling  effort  and  technique  is  generally  nec-
essary to provide a valid basis for comparing species richness 
across  communities.  For  example,  Frode  Ødegaard  of  the 
Norwegian  Institute  for  Nature  Research  took  great  care  to 
standardize sampling as he compared species richness among 
plant-feeding beetles living in a tropical dry forest and in a tropi-
cal rain forest in Panama (Ødegaard 2006). Ødegaard sampled 
both forests from a canopy crane of the sort discussed in chap-
ter 1 (see p. 7) that provided access to similar areas of forest 
(~0.8 ha). He standardized the amount of time he spent sampling 
each tree or vine and he used the same sampling techniques in 
both  forests.  Ødegaard  also  sampled  the  beetles  on  approxi-
mately the same number of plant  species—50  species in the dry 
forest and 52 in the rain forest. His efforts resulted in the capture 
of very similar numbers of individual beetles in the two forests: 
35,479 in dry forest versus 30,352 in rain forest. However, his 
collections in rain forest included 37% more beetle species than 
in  dry  forest:  1,603  species  in  rain  forest  versus  1,165  in  dry 
forest. Because Ødegaard took care to standardize sampling, we 
can conclude that the species richness of plant-feeding beetles 
was probably higher at his rain forest study site. If his sampling 
efforts were uneven, we could not reach such a conclusion. 

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  16 
     1.  A complete list of species has not been determined for any 

area of substantial habitat anywhere on earth. Why not?  

    2.  Why  do  most  surveys  of  species  diversity  focus  on 
restricted groups of relatively well-known organisms such 
as plants, mammals, and butterflies?

  Niches, Heterogeneity, and the Diversity of 
Algae and Plants 
 The existence of approximately 300,000 species of terrestrial 
plants presents a multitude of opportunities for specialization 
by  animals.  Consequently,  high  plant  diversity  can  explain 
much  of  animal  diversity.  However,  how  do  we  explain  the 
diversity of primary producers? G. Evelyn Hutchinson (1961) 
described  what  he  called  “the  paradox  of  the  plankton.”  He 
suggested that communities of phytoplankton present a para-
dox because they live in relatively simple environments (the 
open waters of lakes and oceans) and compete for the same 
nutrients  (nitrogen,  phosphorus,  silica,  etc.),  yet  many  spe-
cies can coexist without  competitive exclusion. This situation 
seemed  paradoxical  because  it  appears  to  violate  the  com-
petitive exclusion principle. The diversity of terrestrial plants 
presents a similar paradox. This paradox is sufficiently vex-
ing that Joseph Connell (1978) proposed that environmental 
heterogeneity is not sufficient to account for terrestrial plant 
diversity, especially in tropical rain forests. 

 After  some  decades  of  theoretical  and  empirical  work, 
however, it appears that environmental complexity can account 
for  a  significant  portion  of  the  diversity  among  both  plank-
tonic algae and terrestrial plants. As with animals, in order to 
study the influence of environment on diversity of plants and 
algae, we need to understand the nature of their niches.  

  The Niches of Algae 
and Terrestrial Plants 
 The  niches  of  algae  appear  to  be  defined  by  their  nutrient 
requirements.  The  importance  of  nutrient  requirements  to 
the niches of phytoplankton was demonstrated by David Til-
man  (1977).  Tilman  conducted  experiments  on  competition 

between freshwater diatoms. His experiments were similar to 
those conducted by G. F. (1934; also see chapter 13), on com-
petition between paramecium. However, in addition to dem-
onstrating  competitive  exclusion,  Tilman’s  experiments  also 
showed the conditions that allowed coexistence of diatom spe-
cies. Exclusion or coexistence depended upon the ratio of two 
essential nutrients, silicate, SiO 2   22  , and phosphate, PO 4   32  . 

 When  Tilman  grew  the  diatoms   Asterionella  formosa  
and  Cyclotella meneghiniana  by themselves, they established 
and  maintained  stable  populations.  However,  when  he  grew 
them  together,   Asterionella   sometimes  excluded   Cyclotella,  
and  sometimes  the  two  species  coexisted.  The  outcome  of 
Tilman’s experiments depended upon the ratio of silicate to 
phosphate ( fig. 16.11 ). At high ratios  Asterionella  eventually 
excluded  Cyclotella.  However, at lower ratios the two species 
coexisted.  At  the  lowest  ratio,   Cyclotella   was  numerically 
dominant over  Asterionella.      

 How  can  we  explain  Tilman’s  results?  It  turns  out  that 
 Asterionella  takes up phosphorus at a much higher rate than 
does  Cyclotella.  Tilman reasons that at high ratios of silicate 
to phosphate,  Asterionella  is able to deplete the environment 
of phosphorus and consequently eliminate  Cyclotella.  How-
ever,  when  ratios  are  low,  silicate  limits  the  growth  rate  of 
 Asterionella  and it cannot deplete phosphate. Consequently, 
when ratios are low,  Asterionella  cannot exclude  Cyclotella.  
At these low ratios, silicate limits the growth rate of  Asterio-
nella,   while  phosphate  limits  the  growth  rate  of   Cyclotella.  
Consequently, in the presence of low ratios of silicate to phos-
phate, the two diatoms coexist. 

 What do the results of Tilman’s experiments have to do 
with the relationship of environmental complexity to species 
diversity?  The  implication  is  that  if  the  ratio  of  silicate  to 
phosphate varies across a lake, then  Asterionella  will domi-
nate some areas, while elsewhere  Cyclotella  will dominate. 

 Now,  how  might  we  characterize  the  niches  of  terres-
trial plants? A. Tansley’s experiments (1917) on competition 

Asterionella dominates 
where phosphorus is 
most limiting to 
population growth.

The two species coexist 
where the population of 
each is limited by a 
different nutrient.

Cyclotella dominates 
where silicate is 
most limiting to 
population growth.

between  Galium  species, which we discussed in chapter 13, 
provide insights into the niches of terrestrial plants. You may 
recall  that  Tansley  studied  two  species:   G.  saxatile,   which 
grows mainly on acidic soils, and  G.  sylvestre,  which grows 
mainly  on  basic  soils.  When  these  two  plants  competed 
against  each  other  in  an  experimental  garden,  each  did  best 
on the soil type that it occupies in nature. Like the diatoms 
 Asterionella  and  Cyclotella,  the niches of  G. saxatile  and  G. 
sylvestre  are significantly influenced by the chemical charac-
teristics of the environment, in this case of the soil. 

 We can define the niches of algae and plants on the basis 
of  their  nutrient  requirements  and  responses  to  constraining 
physical  or  chemical  conditions,  such  as  moisture  and  pH. 
Therefore, from the perspective of plants and algae, variation 
in  the  availability  of  limiting  nutrients,  such  as  silicate  and 
phosphate, and variation in physical and chemical conditions, 
such as temperature, moisture, and pH, contribute to environ-
mental complexity.  

  Complexity in Plant Environments 
 Let’s look first at environmental heterogeneity in an aquatic 
environment. Martin Lebo and his colleagues (1993) studied 
spatial variation in nutrient and particulate concentrations in 
Pyramid Lake, Nevada, which has a surface area of approxi-
mately 450 km 2  and a maximum depth of 102 m. 

 Pyramid Lake, like other lakes, is not a uniform chemi-
cal  solution. All  of  the  nutrients  studied  by  the  researchers 
showed  substantial  variation  across  the  lake.   Figure  16.12  
shows that nitrate (NO 32 ) ranged from >20  m g per liter (L  2 1 ) 
near the inflow of the Truckee River to <5  m gL  2 1  along the 
western  and  northeastern  shores.  Silicate  (SiO 2 )  reached 
maximum concentrations of >300  m gL  2 1  at the inflow of the 
Truckee  River  and  then  decreased  progressively  northward, 

The concentration of NO3 
varies more than fourfold 
across Pyramid Lake.

Silicate concentrations 
also vary substantially 
across the lake.

reaching  a  minimum  of  <200   m gL  2 1   in  the  north-central 
portion  of  the  lake.  Other  nutrients  also  showed  substantial 
variation  across  Pyramid  Lake,  but  their  pattern  of  varia-
tion differed from that shown by nitrate and silicate. In other 
words,  different  parts  of  the  lake  offer  distinctive  growing 
conditions for phytoplankton. This environmental complexity 
should allow for phytoplankton diversity.     

 Now, let’s look at variation in nutrient concentrations in a 
terrestrial environment. Our example concerns an abandoned 
agricultural field, a situation where we might expect low envi-
ronmental heterogeneity. We can expect reduced heterogene-
ity in an abandoned field because agricultural practices such 
as  plowing,  land  leveling,  and  fertilizer  applications  would 
reduce spatial variation across fields. 

 G.  Robertson  and  a  team  of  researchers  (1988)  quanti-
fied variation in nitrogen and moisture across an abandoned 
agricultural  field.  Their  study  site  was  located  in  southeast 
Michigan, on the E. S. George Reserve, a 490 ha natural area 
maintained  by  the  University  of  Michigan.  Farmers  cleared 
the field of its original oak-hickory forest and plowed the land 
sometime  before  1870.  Crop  raising  continued  on  the  field 
until the early 1900s, when most of the land was converted to 
pasture. Then, in 1928, the cattle were removed and the nature 
reserve was established. Though grazing by cattle has ceased, 
a dense population of white-tail deer,  Odocoileus virginianus,  
continue to graze the site. 

 Robertson and his colleagues focused their measurements 
on  a  0.5  ha  (69  m   3   69  m)  subplot  within  the  old  field  in 
which they measured several soil variables, including nitrate 
concentration and soil moisture, at 301 sampling points. This 
large number of sampling points over a small area provided 
sufficient data to construct a detailed map of soil properties. 
 Figure  16.13   shows  considerable  patchiness  in  both  nitrate 
and moisture. Both variables show at least tenfold differences 
across  the  study  plot.  In  addition,  nitrate  concentration  and 
moisture don’t appear to correlate well with each other; hot 
spots for nitrates were not necessarily hot spots for moisture. 
The researchers concluded that soil conditions show sufficient 
spatial variability to affect the structure of plant communities.     
 We  can  see  from  these  studies  that  algal  and  plant 
resources  change  substantially  across  aquatic  and  terrestrial 
environments.  Now  let’s  examine  how  spatial  heterogeneity 
in  these  resources  may  affect  the  distribution  and  diversity 
of plants.  

  Soil and Topographic Heterogeneity 
and the Diversity of Tropical Forest Trees 
 Carl Jordan (1985) studied the relationship between vegeta-
tion  and  soils  in  the Amazon  forest.  His  studies  led  him  to 
conclude  that  tropical  forest  diversity  is  organized  in  two 
ways: (1) a large number of  species  live within most tropical 
forest communities; (2) there are a large number of plant  com-
munities  in a given area, with each community being distinc-
tive in regard to species composition. 

 Jordan’s studies showed that variation in soil characteris-
tics influences the number of plant communities in an area. He

found that slight differences in soil properties foster entirely 
different plant communities.  Figure 16.14  shows six different 
plant communities that Jordan observed in a distance of just 
500 m and an elevation range of less than 8 m. In the study 
area, the subsoil was clay weathered from a granitic bedrock. 
Sand, deposited on top of the clay, varied in thickness depend-
ing upon local topography. Topography also determined the 
depth of the soil above groundwater.     

 Diverse  mixed  forests  occurred  on  the  tops  of  hills, 
where  clay  was  close  to  the  surface.  Where  the  topogra-
phy  dipped  toward  streambeds  and  the  thickness  of  the 
sand layer increased, Jordan found a forest dominated by a 
tree in the legume family called yévaro,  Eperua purpurea.  
Though  the  yévaro  community  was  less  diverse  than  the 
mixed  forest, it was taller and supported higher plant growth 
rates.  In  addition,  a  distinctive  forest  called  igapó  grew 

along  the  edges  of  the  streams  in  areas  that  flooded 
seasonally. 

 Away from streams on sandy soil, small changes in eleva-
tion  produced  substantial  changes  in  water  availability  and 
plant communities. Near streams but above the level of sea-
sonal flooding, there was another plant community known as 
caatinga. Still on sand but 1 to 2 m above the caatinga there 
was a low-stature forest known as campina. Finally, at eleva-
tions greater than 2 m above stream level, where water drains 
through  the  coarse  sandy  soil  fast  enough  to  induce  water 
stress, Jordan found a shrub community known as bana. He 
observed that while their local names vary, similar plant com-
munities, associated with local variations in soil quality and 
topography, occur throughout the Amazon basin. Analogous 
variation in plant communities in response to differences in 
soil properties have also been observed in temperate regions.

  Species Abundance and Diversity

  Algal and Plant Species Diversity 
and Increased Nutrient Availability 
 Ecologists  have  repeatedly  observed  a  negative  relationship 
between nutrient availability and algal and plant species diver-
sity.  In  other  words,  as  nutrient  supplies  increase,  diversity 
of plants and algae declines. Michael Huston (1980, 1994a) 
reported  a  negative  correlation  between  nutrient  availability 
and plant species diversity in Costa Rican forests, a relation-
ship also reported for African and Asian forests.  Figure 16.15  
shows this relationship for a series of study plots in rain for-
ests in Ghana. A similar negative correlation has been found 
between nutrient availability and diversity of diatoms.   

 Adding  nutrients  to  water  or  soils  generally  reduces  the 
diversity of plants and algae. The results of such experiments 
suggest  a  causal  linkage  between  nutrient  availability  and 
diversity. For instance, in the Park Grass Experiment, research-
ers have fertilized a grassland at the Rothamsted Experimen-
tal Station in Great Britain since 1856 (Kempton 1979). One 
result  of  that  experiment  has  been  a  steady  decline  in  plant 
diversity on the fertilized plots ( fig. 16.16 ). While control plots 
have retained their diversity for over 100 years, the number of 
species on the fertilized plots has declined from 49 to 3. Also 
notice that  figure 16.16  shows that rank-abundance curves have 
gotten steeper over time, indicating declining species evenness.  

  Nitrogen Enrichment and Ectomycorrhizal 
Fungus Diversity 
 Ecologists working in areas of high deposition of atmospheric 
nitrogen have recorded apparent declines in fungal diversity. 
However, most of these observations of reduced diversity have 
been  based  on  declines  in  diversity  of  aboveground  fruiting 
bodies,  such  as  mushrooms.  Such  evidence  may  not  reflect 
declines  in  fungal  diversity  but  shifts  from  aboveground  to 
belowground growth. To address this possibility, Erik Lilles-
kov, Timothy Fahey, Thomas Horton, and Gary Lovett (2002) 
studied  the  diversity  and  composition  of  ectomycorrhizal 
fungi  along  a  gradient  of  nitrogen  deposition  on  the  Kenai 

The highest number of 
species are found in areas 
with lowest soil fertility.

Peninsula, Alaska. The study was focused on areas downwind 
from a fertilizer plant that emits gaseous ammonia. In 1992, 
nitrogen was deposited on the forested landscape at rates rang-
ing from 20 kg per hectare per year in areas near the fertilizer 
plant to 1 kg per hectare per year several  kilometers away. 

 Lilleskov and his colleagues sampled soil nutrients, espe-
cially  nitrogen,  and  ectomycorrhizal  fungi  at  five  sites.  The 
sites all supported mature stands of white spruce,  Picea glauca,  
and  Alaska  paper  birch,   Betula  kenaica.   The  research  team 
sampled the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the roots of 
white spruce trees and identified them using a mix of morpho-
logical and molecular techniques. Lilleskov and his colleagues 
documented  a  strong  gradient  in  soil  nitrogen  at  their  study 
sites, particularly in the organic horizon. The gradient in soil 
nitrogen corresponded to a decline in pH. Associated with this 
gradient in soil nitrogen was a clear decline in the number of 
ectomycorrhizal  fungi  taxa  across  the  sites  ( fig.  16.17 ).  The 
research team hypothesized that the shift in diversity and com-
position was the  result of  a change  from species specialized 
for efficient uptake of nitrogen, under conditions of low avail-
ability, to dominance by acid-tolerant ectomycorrhizal fungi, 
specialized  for  conditions  of  high  soil  fertility. The  research 
team recommends tying future studies of ectomycorrhizal fun-
gal communities with studies of ecosystem processes. It would 
also  be  interesting  to  determine  whether  nitrogen  deposition 
creates less spatially complex environments for ectomycorrhi-
zal fungi, as it apparently does for primary producers.     

 So, it appears that environmental complexity can account 
for a portion of plant species diversity. Can complexity account 
for all of plant diversity? Environmental diversity across Jor-
dan’s Amazonian study sites accounts for a great deal of plant 
diversity but it does not tell us how, for instance, over 300 tree 
species can coexist on a single hectare of Amazonian rain forest. 
To explain such high diversity within relatively homogeneous 
areas, ecologists have turned to the influences of disturbance.

  Concept 16.3 Review 

1.   Does Tilman’s finding that  Asterionella  and  Cyclotella
exclude each other under certain conditions but coexist 
under other conditions violate the competitive  exclusion 
principle (see chapter 13, p. 286)?  

2.   Can  we  link  increased  nutrient  availability  during  the 
Park  Grass  Experiment  with  decreased  environmental 
complexity?  

3.   Suppose  you  discover  that  the  fish  species  inhabiting 
small, isolated patches of coral reef use different verti-
cal zones on the reef face—some species live down near 
the sand, some live a bit higher on the reef, and some 
higher still. Based on this pattern of zonation, can you 
predict how reef structure should affect the diversity of 
fish living on such reefs?       

  16.4  Disturbance and Diversity 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 16.15  Define disturbance.
 16.16  Outline the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.
 16.17  Discuss evidence in support of the intermediate 

disturbance hypothesis.

Intermediate levels of disturbance promote higher  diversity.
For  several  chapters  we  have  assumed  that  environmental 
conditions remain more or less stable. Ecologists refer to this 
state as one of     equilibrium.    In an equilibrial system, stabil-
ity  is  maintained  by  opposing  forces.  The  Lotka-Volterra 

competition models (see chapter 13) and predator-prey mod-
els (see chapter 14) assumed a constant physical environment. 
In  laboratory  studies  of  competition,  researchers  have  gen-
erally  maintained  constant  environmental  conditions.  Even 
earlier  in  this  chapter  when  we  discussed  the  influences  of 
environmental complexity on species diversity, there was an 
underlying assumption of a stable environmental equilibrium. 
However,  most  natural  environments  are  subject  to  various 
forms of disturbance. 

  The Nature and Sources 
of Disturbance 
 What  is  disturbance?  The  answer  to  this  question  is  not  as 
simple  as  it  may  seem. What  constitutes  disturbance  varies 
from one organism to another and from one environment to 
another. A disturbance for one organism may have little or no 
impact on another, and the nature of disturbance may be quite 
different in different environments. Wayne Sousa (1984), who 
examined the role of disturbance in structuring natural com-
munities, defined disturbance as “a discrete, punctuated kill-
ing,  displacement,  or  damaging  of  one  or  more  individuals 
(or colonies) that directly or indirectly creates an opportunity 
for  new  individuals  (or  colonies)  to  become  established.” 
P. S. White and S. Pickett (1985) defined disturbance as “any 
relatively discrete event in time that disrupts ecosystem, com-
munity  or  population  structure  and  changes  resources,  sub-
strate  availability,  or  the  physical  environment.”  They  also 
caution, however, that we must be mindful of spatial and tem-
poral  scale.  For  instance,  disturbance  to  bryophyte  (mosses 
and liverworts) communities growing on boulders along the 
margin of a stream can occur at spatial scales of fractions of 
meters  and  annual  temporal  scales  that  are  irrelevant  to  the 
surrounding forest community. 

 There are innumerable potential sources of  disturbance 
to communities. White and Pickett listed 26 major sources 
of disturbance, roughly divided into abiotic forces, such as 
fire, hurricanes, ice storms, and flash floods; biotic  factors, 
such  as  disease  and  predation;  and  human-caused  distur-
bance.  Regardless  of  the  source,  we  can  classify  distur-
bances by a smaller set of characteristics. We will focus our 
discussion of disturbance on two characteristics: frequency 
and intensity.  

  The Intermediate 
Disturbance Hypothesis 
 Joseph  Connell  (1975,  1978)  proposed  that  disturbance  is  a 
prevalent  feature  of  nature  that  significantly  influences  the 
diversity  of  communities.  He  questioned  the  assumption  of 
equilibrial conditions made by most competition-based mod-
els of diversity. Instead, he proposed that high diversity is a 
consequence of continually changing conditions, not of com-
petitive  accommodation  at  equilibrium,  and  proposed  the 
intermediate  disturbance  hypothesis,     which  predicts  that 
intermediate  levels  of  disturbance  promote  higher  levels  of 
diversity ( fig. 16.18 ).

 Connell suggested that both high and low levels of distur-
bance would lead to reduced diversity. He reasoned that if dis-
turbance is frequent and intense, the community will consist 
of those few species able to colonize and complete their life 
cycles between the frequent disturbances. He also predicted 
that diversity will decline if disturbances are infrequent and 
of  low  intensity.  In  the  absence  of  significant  disturbance, 
the  community  is  eventually  limited  to  the  species  that  are 
the most effective competitors, effective either because they 
are the most efficient at using limited resources or the most 
effective at interference competition. 

 How  can  intermediate  levels  of  disturbance  promote 
higher diversity? Connell suggested that at intermediate levels 
of disturbance, there is sufficient time between disturbances 
for a wide variety of species to colonize but not enough time 
to allow competitive exclusion.  

  Disturbance and Diversity 
in the Intertidal Zone 
 Wayne Sousa (1979a) studied the effects of disturbance on 
the diversity of marine algae and invertebrates growing on 
boulders in the intertidal zone. Disturbance to this commu-
nity comes mainly from ocean waves generated by winter 
storms.  These  waves,  which  can  exceed  2.5  m  in  height, 
are large enough to overturn intertidal boulders, killing the 
algae and barnacles growing on their upper surfaces. Mean-
while, the newly exposed underside of the boulder is avail-
able for colonization by algae and marine invertebrates. 

 Because  boulders  of  different  sizes  turn  over  at  differ-
ent frequencies and in response to waves of different heights, 
Sousa predicted that the level of disturbance experienced by 
the community living on boulder surfaces depends upon boul-
der  size.  Smaller  boulders  are  turned  over  more  frequently 
and  therefore  experience  a  high  frequency  of  disturbance, 

Chapter 16 

  Species Abundance and Diversity 

365

middle-sized boulders experience an intermediate level of dis-
turbance, and large boulders experience the lowest frequency 
of disturbance. 

 Sousa  quantified  the  relationship  between  boulder  size 
and probability of being moved by waves by measuring the 
force required to dislodge boulders of different sizes. He mea-
sured  the  exposed  surface  area  of  a  series  of  boulders  and 
then measured the force required to dislodge each. To make a 
measurement he wrapped a chain around a boulder, attached a 
spring scale to the chain, and pulled in the direction of incom-
ing waves until the boulder moved. He recorded the number 
of kilograms registered on the scale when the boulder moved 
and  then  converted  his  measurements  to  force  expressed 
in  newtons  (newtons  [N]   5   kg   3   9.80665). As  you  might 
expect, there was a positive relationship between size and the 
force required to move boulders. What was Sousa assuming 
as he made these measurements? He assumed that the force 
required  to  move  a  boulder  with  his  apparatus  was  propor-
tional to the force required for waves to move it. 

 Sousa verified this assumption by documenting the rela-
tionship between his force measurements and movement by 
waves.  He  established  six  permanent  study  sites  and  mea-
sured  the  force  required  to  move  the  boulders  in  each.  He 
next  mapped  the  locations  of  boulders  by  photographing 
the study plots and then checked for boulder movements by 
taking  additional  photographs  monthly  for  2  years.  Sousa 
divided  the  boulders  in  the  study  sites  into  three  classes 
based on the force required for movement: (1) ≤49 N, (2) 50 
to 294 N, and (3) >294 N. These classes translated into fre-
quent movement (42% per month  5  frequent disturbance), 
intermediate movement (9% per month  5  intermediate dis-
turbance), and infrequent movement (1% per month  5  infre-
quent disturbance). 

 The  number  of  species  living  on  boulders  varied  with 
frequency of disturbance ( fig. 16.19 ). Most of the frequently 
disturbed  boulders  supported  a  single  species,  few  sup-
ported five species, and none supported six or seven species. 
Most of the boulders experiencing a low frequency of dis-
turbance supported one to three species, few supported six 
species,  and  none  supported  seven.  The  boulders  support-
ing  the  greatest  diversity  of  species  were  those  subject  to 
intermediate levels of disturbance. Most of these supported 
three to five species, many supported six species, and some 
supported seven.    

  Disturbance and Diversity 
in Temperate Grasslands 
 Can  several  species  coexist  where  there  is  a  single  limiting 
resource?  The  Lotka-Volterra  competition  equations  (see 
chapter 13) predict that under such circumstances, one species 
will eventually exclude all others. However, as Sousa’s work 
shows,  even  where  species  compete  for  a  single  resource, 
such as space in the intertidal zone, several species may coex-
ist if disturbance prevents competitive exclusion. David Til-
man  (1994)  reached  a  similar  conclusion  in  regard  to  plant 
diversity within North American prairies.

 Figure 16.19    Levels of disturbance and diversity of marine algae and invertebrates on intertidal boulders (data from Sousa 1979a). 

 What sorts of disturbance have been important in grass-
lands? Historically, the magnitude of disturbance on the North 
American prairie ranged from trampling by bison herds and 
fire to the death of an individual plant. One of the most impor-
tant  and  ubiquitous  sources  of  disturbance  to  grasslands  is 
burrowing by mammals. 

 April  Whicker  and  James  Detling  (1988)  proposed 
that  prairie  dogs  ( Cynomys   spp.),  which  occupied  about 
40   million  ha  of  North  American  grasslands  as  late  as 
1919, were an important source of disturbance on the North 
 American prairies. Prairie dogs are herbivorous rodents that 
weigh approximately 1 kg as adults and live in colonies con-
taining  10  to  55  individuals  per  hectare.  Prairie  dogs  build 
extensive  burrow  systems  that  are  1  to  3  m  deep  and  about 
15  m  long,  with  tunnel  diameters  of  10  to  13  cm  and  two 
entrances. To build a burrow with these dimensions a prairie 
dog must excavate 200 to 225 kg of soil, which it deposits in 
mounds 1 to 2 m in diameter around burrow entrances. 

 Burrowing  and  grazing  by  prairie  dogs  have  substan-
tial  effects  on  the  structure  of  plant  communities  at  sev-
eral  spatial  scales.   Figure  16.20   shows  the  areas  of Wind 
Cave  National  Park  occupied  by  prairie  dogs.  Because  of 
the activities of these rodents, each of these areas supports 
vegetative  communities  distinctive  from  the  surround-
ing  landscape. Within  a  colony,  prairie  dog  activities  cre-
ate  patchiness  on  a  smaller  scale,  with  areas  of  forbs  and 
shrubs,  grass  and  forbs,  and  grass  within  the  surrounding 
matrix of prairie grassland. Whicker and Detling estimate 
that  plant  species  diversity  is  greatest  in  areas  experienc-
ing  intermediate  levels  of  disturbance  by  prairie  dogs 
( fig. 16.21 ).       

 How  does  disturbance  by  prairie  dogs  foster  higher 
diversity? The mechanisms underlying this effect are essen-
tially  the  same  as  those  operating  in  the  intertidal  boulder 
field  studied  by  Sousa.  By  burrowing  and  piling  earth  and 

by grazing and clipping vegetation, prairie dogs remove veg-
etation from areas around their burrows. These bare patches 
are  then  open  for  colonization  by  plants.  However,  some 
plant species are more likely to colonize these open patches. 
Those species investing most heavily in dispersal are usually 
the first to arrive. However, these early colonists can be dis-
placed by better competitors that arrive later. The persistence 
of both good colonizers and good competitors in a plant com-
munity depends upon intermediate levels of disturbance. Too 
much  disturbance  and  the  community  is  dominated  by  the 
good colonizers; too little disturbance and the better competi-
tors dominate. 

 Because they have been considered an agricultural pest, 
various  control  programs  have  reduced  prairie  dog  popula-
tions by about 98% during the last century. The extermination 
also  eliminated  their  dynamic  influences  on  plant  commu-
nities.  However,  other  burrowing  mammals  remain  in  large 
numbers. One of the most important of these are the pocket 
gophers of the family Geomyidae. Though pocket gophers are 
much smaller than prairie dogs, weighing from 60 to 900 g, 
their effects on grassland and arid land communities are con-
siderable. The  mounds  that  gophers  create  during  their  bur-
rowing  may  cover  as  much  as  25%  to  30%  of  the  ground 
surface,  which  increases  heterogeneity  in  light  availability 
and soil nitrogen, which in turn fosters increased plant species 
richness. 

 The  influences  of  prairie  dogs  and  pocket  gophers  on 
plant  communities  are  a  consequence  of  a  combination  of 
physical disturbances due to burrowing and to feeding, since 
both are herbivores. How might disturbance by humans affect 
the  diversity  of  plant  and  animal  communities?  We  are  all 
well acquainted with examples of how severe disturbance by 
humans reduces biological diversity. In the following section, 
we  consider  the  effects  of  moderate  disturbance  by  humans 
on diversity.

  Concept 16.4 Review 

1.   Could  protecting  forests  that  once  burned  with  regu-
lar frequency, due to lightning strikes, lead to reduced 
plant  diversity  within  a  mountain  forest  landscape  of 
25 km 2  (~10 mi 2 )?  

2.   If disturbance can foster higher species diversity, why 
is human disturbance often (though not always) associ-
ated with reduced species diversity?  

3.   According to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, 
could human disturbance sustain higher levels of spe-
cies diversity than in the absence of human disturbance?

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 16.18  Explain how the effects of disturbance by humans 

on diversity are consistent with the predictions of the 
intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

 16.19  Describe the effects of urbanization on the diversity 

and composition of bird communities.

 The effects of disturbance by humans are all around us. Hous-
ing developments cover the countryside as human populations 
continue  their  rapid  growth.  Deforestation  continues  at  an 
alarming rate in both temperate and tropical regions. Indus-
tries  pollute  air  and  water.  While  the  destructive  effects  of 
disturbance by humans may seem outside the realm of what 
we’ve discussed so far, they are not. The destruction of nat-
ural  communities  that  we  often  associate  with  humans  is  a 
consequence  of  the  extreme  levels  of  disturbance  of  which 
our species is capable ( fig. 16.22 ). These are the high levels 
of  disturbance  that  the  intermediate  disturbance  hypothesis 
(see   fig.  16.18 )  predicts  will  lead  to  reduced  diversity.  Not 
surprisingly,  human  disturbance  threatens  thousands  of  spe-
cies  with  extinction. The  International  Union  for  Conserva-
tion of Nature lists habitat destruction by humans as the most 
 serious threat to endangered species worldwide (IUCN 2007). 
Environments  disturbed  by  human  activity  are  not,  how-
ever,  devoid  of  life  and  some,  such  as  the  chalk  grasslands 
of Europe, support higher diversity under traditional manage-
ment  (e.g.,  Bobbink  and Willems  1987,  1991). As  we  shall 
now see, even urban environments can support surprising lev-
els of diversity.

 Figure 16.22    Human populations and activity are a major source of disturbance. For example,  (a)  housing developments generally simplify natu-
ral ecosystems and feed demand for natural resources such as  (b)  the wood harvested from this clear-cut forest and  (c)  the coal from this mountaintop 
which is mined to supply electrical power to human populations. The growing energy demands of our population and our reliance on fossil fuels are 
driving global warming, disturbing habitats far beyond human population centers, for example,  (d)  by melting Arctic sea ice, which is prime hunting 
habitat for polar bears,  Ursus maritimus.  

  Urban Diversity 
 One of the developing ecological frontiers, urban ecology, can 
be found where the majority of people around the world live: in 
urban environments. And, the proportion of people who are city 
dwellers is growing rapidly. In developed countries, the percent-
age of people living in cities stands at about 80%, a proportion 
that  will  be  approached  in  developing  countries  over  the  next 
50 years (Grimm et al. 2008). It is essential then that we better 
understand the ecology of cities, including their biological diver-
sity and their functioning as ecosystems (see chapter 19, p. 432). 
 While urbanization is considered a major threat to biodiver-
sity, Stuart Pickett, Director of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study 
Long  Term  Ecological  Research  (LTER)  Program,  points  out 
that ongoing studies are revealing that the urban biota is diverse, 
often much more so than commonly thought (Pickett et al. 2008). 
Studies of urban diversity have included plants, land snails, bee-
tles,  butterflies,  spiders,  fish,  aquatic  invertebrates,  mammals, 
and one of the most studied groups of organisms: birds. 

 Urbanization has been shown to reduce both bird species 
richness  and  evenness  in  Phoenix,  Arizona,  and  Baltimore, 

Maryland  (Shochat  et  al.  2010),  an  effect  observed  in  many 
other  urban  settings.  It  turns  out,  however,  that  landscapes 
exposed to some degree of human land use can support sub-
stantial levels of bird diversity. In a study of bird species rich-
ness along gradients of land use intensity, Robert Blair (2004) 
recorded the highest number of bird species in areas of interme-
diate use in both northern California and southwestern Ohio. 
 Figure 16.23  a  shows that bird species richness peaked in the 
middle of gradients of land use intensity, peaking in both study 
areas in golf courses. One of the drivers of change in bird spe-
cies  richness  along  these  gradients,  is  habitat  modification. 
Habitat changes from the nature preserve to the business dis-
trict along these gradients included decreases in tree and shrub 
cover and increases in coverage by pavement and buildings. As 
might be expected, grassland and lawn coverage was highest on 
golf courses. As we saw in chapter 5, these urban centers would 
also  have  higher  average  temperatures  (see  p.  122),  another 
facet of environment change associated with urbanization.   

 However,  patterns  of  species  richness  do  not  tell  the 
whole  story.  The  composition  of  the  bird  communities  also 
changed  markedly.  Most  significantly,  the  richness  of  native

ate disturbance (golf courses) than at sites of lower disturbance (nature preserves and open space) or at sites of higher disturbance (residential, office/ 
apartments, and business neighborhoods). (b) Reduced presence of native woodland bird species was observed at all levels of land use intensity (data 
from Blair 2004). 

woodland  birds  decreased  as  land  use  inten-
sity  increased  in  both  California  and  Ohio 
( fig. 16.23  b ). As bird species associated with 
natural woodland vegetation declined in rep-
resentation  along  the  gradients,  they  were 
replaced by other, generally more widespread 
species,  such  as  non-native  house  sparrows, 
 Passer    domesticus,   and  starlings,   Sturnus  
 vulgarus.  As  a  result,  the  similarity  between 
the  bird  communities  at  the  California  and 
Ohio  study  sites  increased  toward  the  urban 
core of the study gradients, where these wide-
spread, generalist species were most common 
( fig.  16.24 ).  This  pattern  gives  some  insight 
into the basis for concerns that an increasingly 
urbanized world will contribute to a homog-
enized global biota—that is, urbanization will 
reduce  regional  differences  in  biodiversity 
(McKinney  2002;  Blair  2004).  Pickett  and 
his colleagues (2008) counter this concern by 
pointing out that the diversity of other groups 
of organisms; for example, ground beetles and 
plants, do not seem to be as adversely affected 
by  urbanization.  The  exponential  growth  in 
studies of urban ecology will likely soon pro-
duce the information needed to address these 
differences in perspectives, and perhaps, rem-
edy remaining concerns about the ecological 
consequences of urbanization.      

The level of similarity between the California and
Ohio study sites increases with degree of urbanization.

intensity in Palo Alto, California and Oxford, Ohio. Because the most disturbed sites sup-
port more bird species with widespread distributions and fewer native local birds, the bird

most disturbed urban sites (data from Blair 2004).

Section V 

  Communities and Ecosystems

   Summary 

 A  community  is an association of interacting species inhabit-
ing some defined area. Examples of communities include the 
plant  community  on  a  mountainside,  the  insect  community 
associated with a particular species of tree, and the fish com-
munity  on  a  coral  reef.  Community  ecologists  often  restrict 
their  studies  to  groups  of  species  that  all  make  their  living 
in a similar way. Animal ecologists call such groups  guilds,  
while  plant  ecologists  use  the  term   life-form.   The  field  of 
community ecology concerns how the environment influences 
 community  structure,   including  the  relative  abundance  and 
diversity of species, the subjects of chapter 16. 

  Most species are moderately abundant; few are very 
abundant or extremely rare.  Frank Preston (1948)  graphed 
the  abundance  of  species  in  collections  as  distributions  of 
species  abundance,  with  each  abundance  interval  twice  the 
preceding  one.  Preston’s  graphs  were  approximately  “bell-
shaped” curves and are called “lognormal” distributions. Log-
normal distributions, which describe the relative abundance of 
organisms ranging from algae and terrestrial plants to birds, 
may result from many random environmental variables acting 
upon the populations of a large number of species or may be a 
consequence of how species subdivide resources. Regardless 
of the underlying mechanisms, the lognormal distribution is 
one of the best described patterns in community ecology. 

  A  combination  of  the  number  of  species  and  their 
relative  abundance  defines  species  diversity.   Two  major 
factors define the diversity of a community: (1) the number of 
species in the community, which ecologists usually call  spe-
cies  richness,   and  (2)  the  relative  abundance  of  species,  or 
 species evenness.  One of the most commonly applied indices 
of species diversity is the Shannon-Wiener index:

 s
H′ = −  ∑ 
  
      pi loge pi 
  i = 1

   The  relative  abundance  and  diversity  of  species  can  also  be 
portrayed using  rank-abundance curves.  Accurate estimates of 
species richness require carefully designed sampling programs. 

  Species diversity is higher in complex environments.  
Robert MacArthur (1958) discovered that five coexisting war-
bler species feed in different layers of forest vegetation and 
that  the  number  of  warbler  species  in  North American  for-
ests increases with increasing forest stature. Various investi-
gators have found that the diversity of forest birds increases 
with  increased  foliage  height  diversity.  The  niches  of  algae 
can be defined by their nutrient requirements. Heterogeneity 
in physical and chemical conditions across aquatic and terres-
trial environments can account for a significant portion of the 
diversity  among  planktonic  algae  and  terrestrial  plants.  Soil 
characteristics  and  depth  to  groundwater  strongly  influence 
the  nature  of  local  plant  communities  in  the Amazon  River 
basin. Increased nutrient availability correlates with reduced 
algal and plant diversity. 

  Intermediate  levels  of  disturbance  promote  higher 
diversity.   Joseph  Connell  (1975,  1978)  proposed  that  high 
diversity is a consequence of continually changing conditions, 
not of competitive accommodation at equilibrium. He proposed 
the   intermediate  disturbance  hypothesis,   which  predicts  that 
intermediate levels of disturbance foster higher levels of diver-
sity. At intermediate levels of disturbance, a wide array of spe-
cies  can  colonize  open  habitats,  but  there  is  not  enough  time 
for the most effective competitors to exclude the other species. 
Wayne Sousa (1979a), who studied the effects of disturbance on 
the diversity of sessile marine algae and invertebrates growing 
on intertidal boulders, found support for the intermediate distur-
bance hypothesis. Diversity in prairie vegetation also appears to 
be higher in areas receiving intermediate levels of disturbance. 
The effect of disturbance on diversity appears to depend upon a 
trade-off between dispersal and competitive abilities. 

 The effects of human disturbance fall within the frame-
work of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. While less 
intensely used parts of the urban landscape can support high 
levels of bird diversity, intense urbanization reduces bird spe-
cies richness and substantially alters bird species composition. 
For a number of other groups of organisms, however, ongoing 
studies are revealing a surprisingly diverse urban biota.

  Review Questions 

     1.  What  is  the  difference  between  a  community  and  a  popula-
tion? What are some distinguishing properties of communities? 
What is a guild? Give examples. What is a plant life-form? Give 
examples.  

    2.  Draw  a  “typical”  lognormal  distribution.  Include  properly 
labeled horizontal ( x ) and vertical (y) axes. You can use the log-
normal distributions included in chapter 16 as models.  

    3.  Suppose you are a biologist working for an international conser-
vation organization concerned with studying and conserving bio-
logical diversity. On one of your assignments you are sent out to 
explore the local biotas of several regions. As part of your  survey 
work, you are to take large quantitative samples of the copepods of 
the North Atlantic, the butterflies of central New Guinea, and the 
ground-dwelling beetles of southwest Africa. Using the lognormal 
distribution, predict the patterns of relative abundance of species 
you expect to see within each of these groups of organisms.  

    4.  What are species richness and species evenness? How does each 
of these components of species diversity contribute to the value of 
the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H  ')? How do species even-
ness and richness influence the form of rank-abundance curves?  
    5.  Compare  the  “trophic”  niches  of  warblers  and  diatoms  as 
described by MacArthur (1958) and Tilman (1977). Why is it 
important that the ecologist be familiar with the niches of study 
organisms before exploring relationships between environmen-
tal complexity and species diversity?   

    6.  Communities  in  different  areas  may  be  organized  in  different 
ways.  For  instance,  C.  Ralph  (1985)  found  that  in  Patagonia 

in Argentina, as foliage height diversity increases, bird species 
diversity  decreases.  This  result  is  exactly  the  opposite  of  the 
pattern observed by MacArthur (1958) and others reviewed in 
chapter  16.  Design  a  study  aimed  at  determining  the  environ-
mental  factors  determining  variation  in  bird  species  diversity 
across Ralph’s Patagonian study sites.  

    7.  According  to  the  intermediate  disturbance  hypothesis,  both 
low  and  high  levels  of  disturbance  can  reduce  species  diver-
sity. Explain possible mechanisms producing this relationship. 
Include trade-offs between competitive and dispersal abilities in 
your discussion.  

    8.  The  dams  that  have  been  built  on  many  rivers  often  stabilize 
river flow by increasing flows below the dam during droughts 
and decreasing the amount of flooding during periods of high 
rainfall. Using the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, predict 
how stabilized flows would affect the diversity of river organ-
isms below reservoirs.  

    9.  Humans have been living in the tropical rain forests of the New 
World for at least 11,000 years. During this period, disturbance 
by  humans  has  been  a  part  of  these  tropical  rain  forests.  Use 
the intermediate disturbance hypothesis to explain how recent 
disturbances  threaten  the  biological  diversity  of  these  forests, 
while earlier disturbances apparently did not.  

   10.  Why  do  introduced  predators  possibly  threaten  the  species 
diversity of a community such as Lake Victoria, while indige-
nous predators do not? Think in evolutionary timescales as you 
develop your answer to this question.

   The sea otter,  Enhydra lutris,  lives in nearshore environments from the 
Kuril Islands in the northwest Pacific Ocean to Alaska and Canada south to 
California. Despite living at relatively low population densities and being 
one of the smallest marine mammals, sea otters have great ecological 
 influence on the communities in which they live. Because of that influence, 
which is exerted largely through their feeding on grazing benthic inverte-
brates, ecologists generally refer to sea otters as a  keystone species.

  LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 17.1  Describe the major components of the Antarctic 

 17.2 

pelagic food web.
Interpret the feeding interactions indicated by a 
food web.

S ome of the most easily documented examples of interac-

tions  within  communities  are  feeding  relationships.  The 
feeding relationships in the ocean around Antarctica, one 
of the most productive marine environments on earth, provides a 
well-known example. Phytoplankton, especially diatoms, thrive 
in these frigid, windswept seas, where they are food for  grazing 
zooplankton. One of the most important of these  zooplankton are 
krill, shrimplike crustaceans. Krill are prey for a wide  variety of 
larger plankton-feeding species, including crabeater seals, pen-
guins, flying seabirds, and many species of fish and squid. The 
best known of the krill feeders are the baleen whales that once 
gathered in huge numbers to feed in Antarctic waters ( fig. 17.1 ).     
 The krill-feeding fishes and squid are eaten by predaceous 
species,  including  emperor  penguins,  larger  fish,  and  Weddell

and Ross seals. Leopard seals, a highly carnivorous species, feed 
on penguins and the smaller seals. Finally, the ultimate predators 
in this community are the killer whales, which eat seals, includ-
ing leopard seals, and even attack and consume baleen whales. 
Huge  populations  of  organisms  live  in  the  oceans  surrounding 
Antarctica, all bound together in a tangle of feeding relationships. 
 How can we go beyond a confusing verbal description to a 
useful and easily understood summary of the feeding relation-
ships within communities? One of the earliest approaches to the 
study of communities was to describe who eats whom. Since the 
beginning of the twentieth century, ecologists have meticulously 
described the feeding relationships in hundreds of communities. 
The resulting feeding relationships came to be called food webs. 
If we define a community as an association of interacting species, 
a moment’s reflection will show that a    food web    ,  a summary of 
the feeding interactions within a community, is one of the most 
basic and revealing descriptions of community structure. A food 
web is, essentially, a community portrait based on feeding rela-
tionships  ( fig.  17.2 ).  Other  community  portraits  could  be  pro-
duced using competitive or mutualistic relationships.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 17.3  Describe the influence of foundation species on 

communities.

 17.4  Discuss the pros and cons of emphasizing strong 

interactions in food web studies.

 17.5  Predict how the community food web associated 

with Phragmites australis would change if the

removed from the ecosystem.

A food web summarizes the feeding relations in a community.
The  earliest  work  on  food  webs  concentrated  on  simplified 
communities. One of the first of those food webs described 
the  feeding  relations  on  Bear  Island  in  the  high  Arctic. 
 Summerhayes and Elton (1923) studied the feeding relations 
there because they believed that the high Arctic, with few spe-
cies, would be the best place to begin the study of food webs. 
 The work of Summerhayes and Elton revealed that even 
in these “impoverished faunas,” feeding relations are complex 
and  difficult  to  study,  but  they  are  much  more  manageable 
than the food webs of more diverse communities.  

   Detailed Food Webs Reveal Great Complexity 
 One study by Kirk Winemiller (1990), who described the feed-
ing relations among freshwater fishes, gives a hint of the great 
complexity of many food webs. Winemiller studied the aquatic 
food  webs  at  two  locations  in  the  savannas,  or  “llanos,”  of 
 Venezuela and at two other sites in the lowlands of Costa Rica. 
His study sites supported from 20 to 88 fish species. One of 
Winemiller’s least species-rich study sites was a medium-sized 
stream called Caño Volcán. This stream flows through the pied-
mont of the Andes and supports 20 fish species. 

 Winemiller represented the food webs at his study sites in var-
ious ways. In some he only included the “common” fish species 

whose  aggregate  abundance  comprised  95%  of  the  individuals 
in his collections. These common-fish webs excluded many rare 
species. Winemiller also constructed food webs that excluded the 
weakest trophic links, those comprising less than 1% of the diet. 

 Let’s look at the results from Caño Volcán, the  simplest 
fish community.  Figure 17.3  a  shows that even when only the 
10 most common fish at Caño Volcán are included in the food 
web, it remains remarkably complex. The most comprehensible 
of Winemiller’s food webs, though still complex, were those 
that  focused  on  the  strongest  trophic  links  only  ( fig.  17.3  b ). 
In addition to simplifying food web structure, focusing on the 
strongest feeding relationships identifies and emphasizes the 
more biologically significant trophic interactions.    

  Strong Interactions and Food Web Structure 
 Robert Paine (1980) suggested that, in many cases, the feeding 
activities of a few species have a dominant influence on com-
munity  structure.  He  called  these  influential  trophic  relations 
  strong  interactions    .   Paine  also  suggested  that  the  defining 
 criterion for a strong interaction is not necessarily quantity of 
energy flow but rather degree of influence on community struc-
ture. We will revisit this topic later in the following section on 
keystone  species,  but  for  now,  let’s  look  at  how  recognizing 
interaction strength can affect depictions of food webs. 

 Paine’s distinction between strong and weak interactions 
within  food  webs  has  been  used  to  model  the   interactions 
within  at  least  one  terrestrial  food  web.  Teja  Tscharntke 
(1992)  has  worked  intensively  on  a  food  web  associated 
with the wetland reed  Phragmites australis.  This reed grows 
in large stands along the shores of rivers and other wetlands, 
where it is a dominant, or foundation, species. Foundation 
species  are  those  that  have  substantial  influences  on  com-
munity structure as a consequence of their high biomass; for 
example, abundant phragmites, an abundant tree in a forest, 
or  a  coral  on  a  reef. Tscharntke’s  study  site  was  along  the 
Elbe River near Hamburg in northwest Germany. Along the 
river,  Phragmites  is attacked by  Giraudiella inclusa,  a fly in 
the family Cecidomyidae, whose larvae develop within galls

Even a food web with only 10 
fish species and their foods 
can be very complex.

Removing weak feeding 
relationships produces a picture 
of the community that is only a 
bit more comprehensible.

called “ricegrain” galls. At the study sites  Phragmites  is also 
attacked by  Archanara geminipuncta,  a moth in the family 
Noctuidae, whose larvae bore into the stems of  Phragmites.  
Stem-boring  by   A.  geminipuncta   induces   Phragmites   to 
form  side  shoots,  a  response  that  provides  additional  sites 
for oviposition by the gall maker  G. inclusa.  

 Tscharntke discovered that at least 14 species of parasitoid 
wasps attack  G. inclusa.  In winter, blue tits,  Cyanistes caeruleus  
( fig.  17.4 ),  move  into  stands  of   Phragmites,   where  they  peck 
open the galls formed by  G. inclusa  and eat the larvae, causing 
mortality in this population as well as in its parasitoids.     

 Tscharntke  represented  these  trophic  interactions  with  a 
food web that captures the essential interactions among species 

Figure 17.4  The blue tit,  Cyanistes caeruleus,  is a Eurasian 
 relative of the chickadees of North America that, like chickadees, gleans 
insects from vegetation.

in this community ( fig. 17.5 ). Though Tscharntke’s web still con-
tains plenty of complexity, his depiction focuses the reader on the 
most important interactions in the community.  Figure 17.5  sug-
gests that feeding by blue tits strongly influences the parasitoids 
 Aprostocetus calamarius  and  Torymus arundinis  and their host, 
 G. inclusa,  in large gall clusters on main shoots. The other series 
of strong interactions involves the parasitoids  Aprostocetus gra-
tus  and  Platygaster quadrifarius,  which attack the  G. inclusa  that 
inhabit small gall clusters in side shoots of  Phragmites.  These 
side shoots are in turn stimulated by the stem-boring larvae of the 
moth  A. geminipuncta.  Notice that blue tits only weakly influ-
ence populations on this side of the web.     

 By distinguishing between weak and strong interactions, 
Tscharntke produced an easily understood food web to rep-
resent  the  study  community.  Identifying  strong  interactions 
allows  us  to  determine  which  species  may  have  the  most 
 significant influences on community structure. 

  Concept 17.1 Review 

      1.   What are the main advantages of including only strong 

linkages in a food web?  

     2.   What was the primary way by which Tscharntke simpli-
fied the food web representing the interactions of blue 
tits  and  feeding  on  insects  living  on  the  wetland  reed 
 Phragmites australis  (see  fig. 17.5 )?  

     3.   In  what  other  main  way  did  Tscharntke  simplify  his 
study  of  trophic  interactions  in  the  wetland  along  the 
Elbe River?       

Identifying the strong 
feeding interactions in this 
food web suggests that the 
top predator should affect 
mainly the species on the 
left side of the web.

  17.2  Indirect Interactions 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 17.6  Distinguish between direct interactions and indirect 

interactions.

 17.7  Explain how interactions between beavers and the 

leaf beetle, Chrysomela confluens, represent an 
 indirect commensalism.

 17.8  Outline the field experiments that demonstrated that 
the relationship between Brassica nigra and Nassella 
pulchra is apparent competition.

 17.9  Predict how the results of the experiment  summarized 
in figure 17.7 would have been changed, if the interac-
tion between Brassica nigra and  Nassella pulchra was 
actually direct competition, with small herbivorous 
mammals playing no role in the interaction.

Indirect  interactions  between  species  are  fundamental  to 
communities.   Food  webs  emphasize   direct   trophic  interac-
tions between species.    Direct interactions    between two species, 
including competition, predation, herbivory and mutualism (see 
chapters 13, 14, and 15), involve positive or negative effects of one 
species on another without the involvement of an intermediary 
species. However, direct interspecific interactions can also result 
in ecologically significant  indirect  interactions between species. 
In    indirect interactions    ,  one species affects another through a 
third, intermediary species. Indirect interactions include trophic 
cascades, which we discuss in detail in chapter 18 (see p. 401), 
apparent competition, and indirect mutualism or commensalism.  

   Indirect Commensalism 
    Commensalism    is an interaction between two species in which 
one species is benefited and the other is neither benefited nor 
harmed.     Indirect  commensalism     occurs  when  the  activities 
of  one  species  indirectly—that  is,  through  an  intermediary 
 species—benefit  another  species  without  itself  being  helped 
or harmed. Gregory Martinsen, Elizabeth Driebe, and Thomas 
Whitham of Northern Arizona University uncovered an indirect 
commensalism ( fig. 17.6 ) in which beavers,  Castor canadensis,
indirectly  benefit  an  herbivorous  beetle  species,   Chrysomela 
confluens,  through their effects on cottonwood trees,  Populus
spp.  (Martinsen,  Driebe,  and  Whitham  1998). As  Martinsen, 
Driebe, and Whitham studied populations of  C. confluens  along 
the Weber River in northern Utah, they encountered higher den-
sities  of   C.  confluens   in  areas  where  beaver  foraging  activity 
was greatest. In these areas, the beetles were concentrated on 
cottonwood sprouts growing from the stumps of trees that had 
been felled by beavers. Searching for a mechanism to explain 
these  higher  beetle  concentrations,  Martinsen,  Driebe,  and 
Whitham found that, compared to leaves on undamaged cotton-
wood  trees,  the  leaves  on  stump  sprouts  had  higher  concen-
trations  of  the  defensive  chemicals  used  by  cottonwood  trees 
to  repel  beavers  and  other  herbivorous  mammals.  However, 
C. confluens  is not repelled by the tree’s defensive chemicals and 
instead uses them for its own defense. In addition, the leaves on 

Chemical changes in cottonwood 
leaves of sprouts growing on stumps 
of beaver-felled trees provide better 
nutrition for Chrysomela confluens 
compared to leaves on intact trees.

Figure 17.6    An indirect commensalism. Beavers positively 
affect a leaf beetle population by felling cottonwood trees, inducing a 
leaf chemistry in the sprouts growing from the resulting stumps that 
repels beavers but is favorable to the leaf beetles (based on data from 
 Martinsen, Driebe, and Whitham 1998).  

stump sprouts were also higher in nitrogen compared to leaves 
on uncut trees,  making them a better food source for the beetles, 
which grew 20% larger and developed 10% faster when  feeding 
on them. This is an example of a  commensalism— beaver activ-
ity  creates  better  conditions  for  the  beetle  population,  with-
out itself being affected. However, because the positive effect 
of beavers on the beetles is mediated through a third species, 
 cottonwood trees, it is an  indirect  commensalism.  

  Apparent Competition 
 Ecologists  generally  infer  interspecific  competition,  where 
interactions  between  the  individuals  of  two  species  have  a 
negative impact on their fitness. However, ecologists are dis-
covering  that  in  some  cases  these  competition-like  effects 
are  the  result  of     apparent  competition    ,   in  which  negative 
impacts are the result of two species sharing a predator or her-
bivore or by one species facilitating populations of a predator 
or herbivore of the second species. For example, if two prey 
species share a predator, increases in one of the prey popula-
tions may lead to increased numbers of the predator, which 
feed on and depress populations of the second prey species.

 John  Orrock,  Martha  Witter,  and  O.  J.  Reichman  (2008) 
found that an assumed competitive interaction between an inva-
sive  exotic  plant  and  a  bunchgrass  native  to  the  grasslands  of 
California is actually  apparent  competition. The invasive exotic 
plant, black mustard,  Brassica nigra,  has been long implicated 
in the competitive displacement of plants native to the California 
grasslands, including the native perennial bunchgrass,  Nassella 
pulchra.  However, Orrock, Witter, and Reichman hypothesized 
that   N.  pulchra   populations  might  be  limited  more  by  small 
mammalian herbivores and granivores than by competition with 
 B. nigra.  They tested their hypothesis using a field experiment in 
which they established 14 study sites at varying distances from 
patches of  B. nigra.  At each study site, they applied three experi-
mental treatments: (1) a fenced exclosure that excluded all small 

mammals, mainly mice, ground squirrels, and rabbits; (2) a con-
trol  consisting  of  a  fenced  area  that  produced  the  disturbance 
associated  with  constructing  an  exclosure  but  allowed  small 
mammal  entry;  and  (3)  an  unfenced  control.  The  researchers 
cultivated and broadcast  N. pulchra  seeds in each of their treat-
ments during the growing season and then followed germination 
of seedlings and establishment of adult plants through spring, 
summer, and fall. They estimated small mammal activity using 
live traps during late summer, a time of peak mammal activity.

a  consequence,  the  densities  of  both  seedlings  and  adult 
 N.  pulchra   were  reduced  in  control  plots,  where  small 
herbivorous  mammals  had  access,  near   B.  nigra   patches. 
 However,  where  small  mammals  were  excluded,  seedling 
and adult  N. pulchra  densities were high regardless of their 
distance from  B. nigra  patches. Orrock, Witter, and Reich-
man propose that  B. nigra  patches provide areas of protec-
tive  cover  for  the  small  mammals  in  their  study  area  from 
which  they  forage  across  the  surrounding  landscape.  The 
result  is  a  gradient  of  decreasing  herbivore  pressure  away 
from   B.  nigra   patches,  producing  a  gradient  of  increasing 
density  in  the   N.  pulchra   population  with  distance  from  
B. nigra  patches. Orrock, Witter, and Reichman concluded 
that  while  the  distribution  patterns  suggest  competition,   B. 
nigra  actually suppresses  N. pulchra  indirectly by sheltering 
mammalian herbivores that feed on the native grass. In short, 
this is an example of apparent competition ( fig. 17.8 ).

  Nassella pulchra  were the result of direct competition, with 
small herbivorous mammals playing no significant role?       

  17.3  Keystone Species 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 17.10  Define keystone species.
 17.11  Distinguish between keystone species and dominant, 

or foundation, species.

 17.12  Discuss Paine’s experiments that led to his proposing 

the keystone species hypothesis.

 17.13  Outline the various mechanisms by which keystone 

species influence the structure of communities.

   The feeding activities of a few keystone species may control 
the  structure  of  communities.   Robert  Paine  (1966,  1969) 
proposed that the feeding activities of a few species have inor-
dinate  influences  on  community  structure.  He  called  these 
    keystone species     , a concept that was later refined with fur-
ther research (see p. 386). Paine’s keystone species hypothesis 
emerged  from  a  chain  of  reasoning.  First,  he  proposed  that 
predators  might  keep  prey  populations  below  their   carrying 
capacity.  Next,  he  reasoned  the  potential  for  competitive 
exclusion  would  be  low  in  populations  kept  below   carrying 
capacity.  Finally,  he  concluded  that  if  keystone  species 
reduced the likelihood of competitive exclusion, their activi-
ties would increase the number of species that could  coexist 
in  communities.  In  other  words,  Paine  predicted  that  some 
predators may increase species diversity.

  Species Interactions and Community Structure

   Food Web Structure and Species Diversity 
 Paine  began  his  studies  by  examining  the  relationship 
between  overall  species  diversity  within  food  webs  and 
the  proportion of the community represented by predators. 
He  cited   studies  that  demonstrated  that  as  the  number  of 
species in marine  zooplankton communities increases, the 
proportion that are  predators also increases. For instance, 
the  zooplankton   community  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean  over 
continental  shelves  includes  81  species,  16%  of  which 
are  predators.  In  contrast,  the  zooplankton  community  of 

the Sargasso Sea contains 268 species, 39% of which are 
predators (Grice and Hart 1962). Paine set out to determine 
if similar patterns occur in marine intertidal communities. 
 Paine  described  a  food  web  from  the  intertidal  zone  at 
Mukkaw Bay, Washington, which lies in the north temperate 
zone  at  49 8   N. This  food  web  is  typical  of  the  rocky  shore 
community along the west coast of North America ( fig. 17.9 ). 
The base of this food web consists of nine dominant intertidal 
invertebrates: two species of chitons, two species of limpets, 
a mussel, three species of acorn barnacles, and one species of

gooseneck barnacle. Paine pointed out that the sea star  Pisas-
ter  commonly consumes two other prey species in other areas, 
bringing  the  total  food  web  diversity  to  13  species.  Ninety 
percent  of  the  energy  consumed  by  the  middle  level  preda-
tor,  Thais,  consists of barnacles. Meanwhile the top predator, 
 Pisaster,  obtains 90% of its energy from a mixture of chitons 
(41%), mussels (37%), and barnacles (12%).     

 Paine  also  described  a  subtropical  food  web  (31 8   N) 
from the northern Gulf of California, a much richer web that 
included  45  species.  However,  like  the  food  web  at  Muk-
kaw Bay, Washington, the subtropical web was topped by a 
single predator, the sea star  Heliaster kubinijii  ( see fig. 17.9 ). 
 However, six predators occupy middle levels in the subtropical 
web, compared to one middle level predator at Mukkaw Bay. 
Because four of the five species in the snail family Columbel-
lidae are also predaceous, the total number of predators in the 
subtropical web is 11. These predators feed on the 34 species 
that form the base of the food web. Despite the presence of 
many more species in this subtropical web, the top predator, 
 Heliaster,  obtains most of its energy from sources similar to 
those used by  Pisaster  at Mukkaw Bay.  Heliaster  obtains 74% 
of its energy directly from a mixture of bivalves, herbivorous 
gastropods, and barnacles. 

 Paine  found  that  as  the  number  of  species  in  his  inter-
tidal  food  webs  increased,  the  proportion  of  the  web  repre-
sented by predators also increased, a pattern similar to that in 
the zooplankton communities that had helped inspire Paine’s 
hypotheses. As Paine went from Mukkaw Bay to the north-
ern Gulf of California, overall web diversity increased from 
13 species to 45 species, a 3.5-fold increase. However, at the 
same time, the number of predators in the two webs increased 
from 2 to 11, a 5.5-fold increase. According to Paine’s preda-
tion hypothesis, this higher proportion of predators produces 
higher predation pressure on prey populations, which in turn 
promotes the higher diversity in the Gulf of California inter-
tidal  zone.  Encouraged  by  these  patterns,  Paine  designed  a 
field  experiment  to  evaluate  his  hypothesis  that  intertidal 
predators enhance species diversity.  

  Experimental Removal of Sea Stars 
 For  his  first  experiment,  Paine  removed  the  top  predator 
from the intertidal food web at Mukkaw Bay and monitored 
the response of the community. He chose two study sites in the 
middle intertidal zone that extended 8 m along the shore and 
2 m vertically. One site was designated as a control and the 
other  as  an  experimental  site.  He  removed   Pisaster   from 
the  experimental  site  and  relocated  them  in  another  portion 
of the intertidal zone. Each week Paine checked the experi-
mental site for the presence of  Pisaster  and removed any that 
might have moved in since his last visit. 

 Paine followed the response of the intertidal community 
to sea star removal for 2 years. Over this interval, the diver-
sity  of  intertidal  invertebrates  in  the  control  plot  remained 
constant  at  15,  while  the  diversity  within  the  experimental 
plot  declined  from  15  to  8,  a  loss  of  7  species. This  reduc-
tion  in  species  diversity  supported  Paine’s  keystone  species 

hypothesis.  However,  if  this  reduction  was  due  to  competi-
tive  exclusion,  what  was  the  resource  over  which  species 
competed? 

 As we saw in chapters 11 and 13, the most common lim-
iting  resource  in  the  rocky  intertidal  zone  is  space.  Within 
3 months of removing  Pisaster  from the experimental plot, the 
barnacle  Balanus glandula  occupied 60% to 80% of the avail-
able space. One year after Paine removed  Pisaster, B. glandula  
was crowded out by mussels,  Mytilus californianus,  and goose-
neck barnacles,  Pollicipes polymerus.  Benthic algal populations 
also  declined  because  of  a  lack  of  space  for  attachment. The 
herbivorous chitons and limpets also left, due to a lack of space 
and a shortage of food. Sponges were also crowded out and a 
nudibranch that feeds on sponges also left. After 5 years, the 
 Pisaster  removal plot was dominated by two species: the mus-
sel,  M. californianus,  and the gooseneck barnacle,  P. polymerus.  
 This experiment showed that  Pisaster  is a keystone spe-
cies. When Paine removed it from his study plot, the commu-
nity collapsed. However, did this one experiment demonstrate 
the  general  importance  of  keystone  species  in  nature?  To 
demonstrate this we need more experiments and observations 
across a wide variety of communities. Paine followed his work 
at Mukkaw Bay with a similar experiment in New Zealand. 

 The  intertidal  community  along  the  west  coast  of  
New  Zealand  is  similar  to  the  intertidal  community  along 
the  Pacific  coast  of  North  America.  The  top  predator  is 
a  sea  star,    Stichaster  australis,   that  feeds  on  a  wide  vari-
ety  of   invertebrates,  including  barnacles,  chitons,  limpets, 
and  a  mussel,   Perna  canaliculus.   During  9  months  follow-
ing  Paine’s  removal  of  sea  stars,  the  number  of  species  in 
the  removal  plot  decreased  from  20  to  14  and  the  coverage 
of the area by the mussel increased from 24% to 68%. As in 
 Mukkaw Bay, the removal of a predaceous sea star produced 
a decrease in species  richness and a significant increase in the 
density of a major prey species. Again, the mechanism under-
lying   disappearance  of  species  from  the  experimental  plot 
was competitive exclusion due to competition for space. 

 These results show that intertidal communities thousands 
of kilometers apart that do not share any species of algae or 
genera  of  invertebrates  are  influenced  by  similar  biologi-
cal  processes  ( fig.  17.10 ).  This  is  reassurance  to  ecologists 
 seeking  general  ecological  principles.  However,  the  two 
 communities  are  not  identical.  The  New  Zealand  intertidal 
community includes a large brown alga,  Durvillea antarctica,  
that  vigorously  competes  for  space  with  the  mussel   Perna.  
The mussel  M. californianus  does not face such a competitive 
challenge in the North American intertidal zone.   

 In a second removal experiment, Paine removed both the 
sea  star   Stichaster   and  the  large  brown  alga   Durvillea   from 
two  different  study  plots. The  result  was  far  more  dramatic 
than  when  Paine  had  removed  the  sea  star  only. After  only 
15  months,   Perna   dominated  the  study  area  and  excluded 
nearly  all  other  flora  and  fauna,  covering  68%  to  78%  of 
the  space  in  the  two  removal  sites.  Paine’s  studies  in  North 
America and New Zealand provide substantial support for the 
keystone species hypothesis. Many other studies quickly fol-
lowed the lead taken by Paine’s pioneering work.

  Snail Effects on Algal Diversity 
 Studies of how herbivorous intertidal snails influence the diver-
sity  of  intertidal  algae  by  Jane  Lubchenco  (1978)  increased 
our understanding of the ecological details on which the influ-
ences of a keystone species can depend. Lubchenco observed 
that  previous studies had indicated that herbivores sometimes 
increase  plant  diversity,  sometimes  decrease  plant  diversity, 
and sometimes seem to do both. She proposed that to resolve 
these  apparently  conflicting  results  it  would  be  necessary 
to   understand  (1)  the  food  preferences  of  herbivores,  (2)  the 
 competitive  relationships  among  plant  species  in  the  local 
 community, and (3) how competitive relationships and feeding 
preferences  vary  across  environments.  Lubchenco  used  these

criteria  to  guide  her  study  of  the  influences  of  an  intertidal 
snail,  Littorina littorea,  on the structure of an algal community. 
 Lubchenco  studied  the  feeding  preferences  of   Littorina  
in  the  laboratory.  Her  experiments  indicated  that  algae  fell 
into  low,  medium,  or  high  preference  categories.  Generally, 
highly preferred algae were small, ephemeral, and tender like 
the green algae,  Enteromorpha  spp., while most tough, peren-
nial  species  like  the  red  alga   Chondrus  crispus   were  never 
eaten or eaten only if the snail was given no other choice. 

that

the  absence  of 

 Lubchenco also studied variation in the abundance of algae 
and  Littorina  in tide pools. She found that tide pools with high 
densities  of   Enteromorpha,   one  of  the  snail’s   favorite  foods, 
 contained low densities (4/m 2 ) of snails. In contrast, pools with 
high  densities  of   Littorina   (233–267/m 2 )  were   dominated  by 
 Chondrus,  a species for which the snail shows low  preference. 
Lubchenco  reasoned 
 Littorina,  
  Enteromorpha   competitively  displaces   Chondrus.   She  tested 
this  idea  by  removing  the   Littorina   from  one  of  the  pools  in 
which they were present in high density and  introducing them to 
a pool in which  Enteromorpha  was dominant. Lubchenco moni-
tored a third pool with a high density of the snails as a control. 
 The  results  of  Lubchenco’s  removal  experiment  were 
clear  ( fig.  17.11 ).  While  the  relative  densities  of   Chondrus, 
 Enteromorpha,  and other ephemeral algae remained  relatively 
constant in the control pool, the density of   Enteromorpha  declined 
with  the  introduction  of   Littorina.   Meanwhile,    Enteromorpha  
quickly increased in density and came to  dominate the pool from 
which  Lubchenco  had  removed  the  snails.  In  addition,  as  the 
 Enteromorpha  population in this pool increased, the  population 
of  Chondrus  declined.  Lubchenco began another addition and 
removal experiment in two other pools in the fall to check for 
seasonal  effects  on   feeding  and  competitive  relations.  This 
 second removal  experiment  produced results almost identical to 
the first. Where   Littorina  were added, the   Enteromorpha  popu-
lation  declined,  whereas  the    Chondrus   population  increased. 
Where  the  snails  were  removed,  the   Chondrus   population 
declined, while the  Enteromorpha  population increased.     

 What controls the local population density of  Littorina?  
Apparently, the green crab,  Carcinus maenus,  which lives in 
the canopy of  Enteromorpha,  preys upon young snails and can 
prevent the juveniles from colonizing tide pools. Adult  Litto-
rina  are much less vulnerable to  Carcinus  but rarely move to 
new tide pools. Populations of  Carcinus  are in turn controlled 
by  seagulls.  Here  again,  we  begin  to  see  the  complexity  of 
a local food web and the influences that trophic interactions 
within webs can have on community structure. 

 So,  within  tide  pools   Enteromorpha   can  outcompete 
the other tide pool algae for space and  Enteromorpha  is the 
preferred food of  Littorina.  How might feeding by the snails 
affect the diversity of algae within tide pools? The relation-
ship between the snails and the algal species they exploit is 
similar to the situation studied by Paine, where mussels were 
the  competitively  dominant  species  and  one  of  the  major 
foods of the sea star  Pisaster.  

 Lubchenco examined the influence of  Littorina  on algal 
diversity by observing the number of algal species living in 
tide pools occupied by various densities of snails ( fig. 17.12 ).

As the density increased from low to medium, the number of 
algal species increased. Then, as the density increased further, 
from medium to high, the number of algal species declined.     

 How  would  you  explain  these  results?  At  low  density, 
the  feeding  activity  by   Littorina   is  not  sufficient  to  prevent 
 Enteromorpha  from dominating a tide pool and crowding out 
some other species. At medium densities, the snail’s feeding, 
which  concentrates  on  the  competitively  dominant  species, 
prevents competitive exclusion and so increases algal diver-
sity. However, at high densities, the feeding requirements of 
the population are so high that the snails eat their preferred 
algae as well as less-preferred species. Consequently, intense 
grazing by snails at high density reduces algal diversity. 

 What  would  happen  if   Littorina   preferred  to  eat  com-
petitively  inferior  species  of  algae?  This  is  precisely  the 
 circumstance that occurs on emergent substrata, rock  surfaces 
that  are  not  submerged  in  tide  pools  during  low  tide.  On 
these  emergent  habitats,  the  competitively  dominant  algae 
are  species in the genera  Fucus  and  Ascophyllum,  algae for 
which the snails show low preference. On emergent substrata, 
the snails continue to feed on ephemeral, tender algae such as 
 Enteromorpha,   largely  ignoring   Fucus   and   Ascophyllum.   In 
this circumstance, Lubchenco found that algal diversity was 
highest when  Littorina  densities were low ( see fig. 17.12 ). 

 Lubchenco’s  research  improved  our  understanding  of 
how trophic interactions can affect community structure. Her 
work  demonstrated  that  the  influence  of  consumers  upon 
the structure of food webs depends upon their feeding pref-
erences,  the  density  of  local  consumer  populations,  and  the 
relative  competitive  abilities  of  prey  species.  While  Lub-
chenco moved the field well beyond the conceptual view held 
by  ecologists  when  Paine  first  proposed  the  keystone  spe-
cies hypothesis, one basic element of the original hypothesis 
remained: Consumers can exert substantial control over food 
web structure; they can act as keystones. 

 Can  predators  act  as  keystone  species  in  environments 
other than the intertidal zone? Here is an example from a riv-
erine environment.  

  Fish as Keystone Species 
in River Food Webs 
 Mary  Power  (1990)  tested  the  possibility  that  fish  can 
 significantly alter the structure of food webs in rivers. She con-
ducted  her  research  on  the  Eel  River  in  northern   California, 
where  most  precipitation  falls  from  October  to  April, 
 sometimes  producing  torrential  winter  flooding.   During  the 
summer, however, the flow of the Eel River averages less than 
1 m 3  per second. 

 In  early  summer,  the  boulders  and  bedrock  of  the  Eel 
River are covered by a turf of the filamentous alga  Cladophora  
( fig.  17.13 ).  However,  the  biomass  of  the  algae  declines  by 
midsummer  and  what  remains  has  a  ropy,  prostrate  growth 
form and a “webbed” appearance. These mats of  Cladophora  
support dense populations of larval midges in the fly family 
Chironomidae.  One  chironomid,   Pseudochironomus  rich-
ardsoni,   is  particularly  abundant.   Pseudochironomus   feeds

 Chironomids  are  eaten  by  predatory  insects  and  the 
young (known as  fry ) of two species of fish: a minnow called 
the California roach,  Hesperoleucas symmetricus,  and three-
spined sticklebacks,  Gasterosteus aculeatus.  These small fish 
are  eaten  by  young  steelhead  trout,   Oncorhynchus  mykiss.

Here, we will use the confidence intervals calculated from samples 
of two populations to create a visual comparison of the populations. 
 Suppose you are studying the recovery of the food web 
of a mountain stream from the effects of a flood. Part of your 
study involves estimating the biomass of each of the consum-
ers  in  the  food  web.  One  of  the  species  you  are  studying  is 
 Neothremma alicia,  a small species of caddisfly, an insect in 
the order Trichoptera, that spends its larval stage grazing on

In  your  study  site  there  are  two  forks  in  a  stream,  one  that 
flooded 2 months before you took your sample, and one that 
did not flood. Otherwise, the two forks of the stream are simi-
lar. The following are the dry weights (milligrams) of  N. alicia  
that you collected in 0.1 m 2  quadrats in each study stream:

 These  sample  means  and  confidence  intervals  are  plotted  in 
 figure 1. Recall from chapter 15 (p. 345) that the true popula-
tion means for each of the study populations has a 95% chance 
of falling somewhere within the 95% confidence intervals. Now 
notice that the 95% confidence intervals for the two samples do 
not overlap. This indicates that there is less than a 5% chance 
that the two samples were drawn from populations of  N. alicia  
with the same mean biomass per unit area. In other words, we 
have  a  basis  for  saying  that  there  is  a  statistically  significant 
difference in biomass of  N. alicia  in the two study streams. In 
chapter 18, we will take a somewhat different approach to mak-
ing a statistical comparison of these two populations (p. 406).

Steelhead  and  large  roach  eat  predatory  invertebrates,  and 
large roach also feed directly upon benthic algae. These inter-
actions form the Eel River food web pictured in  figure 17.14 . 
 Power asked whether or not the two top predators in the 
Eel River food web, roach and steelhead, significantly influ-
ence web structure. She tested the effects of these fish on food 
web structure by using 3 mm mesh to cage off 12 areas 6 m 2  in 
the riverbed. The mesh size of these cages prevented the pas-
sage of large fish but allowed free movement of aquatic insects 
and stickleback and roach fry. Power excluded fish from six of 
her cages and placed 20 juvenile steelhead and 40 large roach 
in each of the other six cages. These fish densities were within 
the range observed around boulders in the open river. 

 Significant differences between the exclosures and enclo-
sures  soon  emerged.  Algal  densities  were  initially  similar; 

however,  enclosing  fish  over  an  area  of  streambed  signifi-
cantly  reduced  algal  biomass  ( fig.  17.15 ).  In  addition,  the 
 Cladophora  within cages with fish had the same ropy, webbed 
appearance as  Cladophora  in the open river.         

 How do predatory fish decrease algal densities? The key 
to answering this question lies with the Eel River food web 
(see  fig. 17.14 ). Steelhead feed heavily on predatory insects, 
young  roach,  and  sticklebacks.  Lower  densities  of  these 
smaller  predators  within  the  enclosures  decreased  predation 
on chironomids. Higher densities of the herbivorous chirono-
mids increased the feeding pressure on algal populations. This 
explanation  is  supported  by  the  results  of  Power’s  experi-
ment in which enclosures contained lower densities of preda-
tory insects and fish fry and higher densities of chironomids 
( fig. 17.16 ). By enclosing and excluding fish from sections of

Figure 17.17    What is a keystone species (data from Power et al. 1996)?  

the Eel River, Power, like Paine and Lubchenco, who worked 
in the intertidal zone, demonstrated that fish act as keystone 
species in the Eel River food web.     

 All of the examples that we have discussed so far have 
been  aquatic.  Do  terrestrial  communities  also  contain  key-
stone  species?  An  increasing  body  of  evidence  indicates 
that  they  do,  particularly  in  tropical  forests  (see  p.  389  and 
 fig. 17.22 ), where they create a “trophic cascade” (see p. 376). 
 Many  studies  of  food  webs  and  keystone  species  have 
been  done  since  Robert  Paine’s  classic  study  of  the  inter-
tidal  food  web  at  Mukkaw  Bay,  Washington.  The  studies 
have revealed a great deal of biological diversity, which has 
prompted  biologists  to  ask  what  characterizes  keystone  spe-
cies. This reflection is necessary to avoid the possibility that 
the term may become so inclusive that it becomes meaning-
less.  The  conclusions  reached  by  a  conference  designed  to 
address this question are summarized in  figure 17.17  (Power 
et al. 1996). The conference participants were careful to dis-
tinguish  between  keystone  and  dominant  or  foundation  spe-
cies.  In  contrast  to  foundation  species,  keystone  species  are 
those  that,  despite  low  biomass,  exert  strong  effects  on  the 
structure of the communities they inhabit. As we shall see in 
the following discussion, those strong effects are not always 
positive, particularly where they involve invasive species. 

  Concept 17.3 Review 

1.   Paine discovered that intertidal invertebrate communi-
ties  of  higher  diversity  include  a  higher  proportion  of 
predator species. Did this pattern confirm Paine’s pre-
dation hypothesis?  

  17.4  Mutualistic Keystones 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 17.16  Explain how mutualistic species may act as keystone 

species.

 17.17  Compare the research approaches used to 

 document the roles of cleaner wrasses and ants 
as keystones in their respective communities. 

Mutualists can act as keystone species.   Returning to the 
classification of Power and colleagues shown in  figure 17.17 , 
the only requirements for keystone status is that the species in 
 question have relatively low biomass in the community and 
that  it  has  a  high  impact  on  community  structure.  Increas-
ingly,  ecologists  are   discovering  that  many  mutualistic  spe-
cies meet these  requirements. One such group are the cleaner 
fishes on coral reefs.  

   A Cleaner Fish as a Keystone Species 
 Many  species  of  fish  on  coral  reefs  clean  other  fish  of  ecto-
parasites. This relationship, which involves the cleaner fish and 
its clients, has been shown to be a true mutualism. One of the 
most widely distributed cleaner fish in the Indo-Pacific region 
is the cleaner wrasse,  Labroides dimidiatus  (see fig. 15.21 a ). 
The  feeding  activity  of  cleaner  wrasses  is  intense. Alexandra 
Grutter of the University of Queensland, Australia, has shown 
that a single cleaner wrasse can remove and eat 1,200 parasites 
from  client  fishes  per  day.  She  also  performed  experiments 
 (Grutter  1999)  that  documented  that  fish  on  reefs  without 
cleaner wrasses harbor approximately four times the number of 
parasitic isopods as those living on reefs with cleaner wrasses. 
 What  effect  might  cleaning  activity  by   L.  dimidiatus
have on the diversity of fish on coral reefs? This is the ques-
tion  addressed  with  a  series  of  field  experiments  by  Red-
ouan Bshary of the University of Cambridge. Bshary studied 
the  effects  of  cleaner  wrasses  on  reef  fish  diversity  at  Ras 
Mohammed National Park, Egypt (Bshary 2003). The study 
area  consists  of  a  sandy  bottom  area  approximately  400  m 
from shore dotted with reef patches in water depths from 2 
to  6  m.  Bshary  chose  46  reef  patches  separated  from  other 
patches  by  at  least  5  m  of  sandy  bottom.  He  identified  and 
counted  the  fish  species  present  during  dives  on  these  reefs 
and noted the presence or absence of cleaner wrasses on each 
reef  patch.  Bshary  recorded  29  natural  disappearances  or 
appearances of cleaner wrasses during his study. In addition, 
he performed experimental removals of cleaner wrasses from

 Seed-dispersing  ants  are  important  to  the  persistence  of 
fynbos plants because they bury seeds in sites where they are 
safe from seed-eating rodents and from fire. Fires are character-
istic of Mediterranean shrublands such as the fynbos, and seeds 
are the only life stage of many fynbos plants to survive fires. 
Consequently, ant dispersal is critical to the survival of many 
plant  species.  In  a  comparison  of  seedling  recruitment  fol-
lowing fire, Christian found substantial reductions in seedling 
recruitment  by  plants  producing  large  seeds  in  areas  invaded 
by Argentine ants ( fig. 17.20 ). Meanwhile small-seeded plants, 
whose dispersers are less affected by Argentine ants, showed no

there were none. 

 Bshary followed the responses of the fish community to 
natural disappearances and experimental removals and  natural 
 colonization and experimental introductions. In doing so, he 
gained insights into the influence of these tiny mutualists on 
reef fish diversity.  Figure 17.18  summarizes the responses of 
fish communities on reef patches 4 months following the nat-
ural or experimental addition or removal of cleaner wrasses. 
Bshary observed a median reduction in fish species richness 
of  approximately  24%  where  cleaner  wrasses  disappeared 
or were removed. Where cleaner wrasses were added, either 
naturally or experimentally, he observed a median increase in 
fish species richness of 24%. Bshary’s results indicate that the 
cleaner wrasse acts as a keystone species on the coral reefs of 
the Red Sea. Mutualists that act as keystone species have also 
been found on land.    

  Seed Dispersal Mutualists 
as Keystone Species 
 It appears that ants that disperse seeds have a significant influ-
ence on the structure of plant communities in the species-rich 
fynbos  of  South Africa.  Caroline  Christian  (2001)  observed 
that native ants disperse 30% of the seeds in the shrublands 
of  the  fynbos.  The  plants  attract  the  services  of  these  dis-
persers  with  food  rewards  on  the  seeds  called  elaiosomes. 
However, the Argentine ant,  Linepithema humile  ( fig. 17.19 ), 
which does not disperse seeds, has invaded these shrublands. 
Christian documented how the invading Argentine ants have 
displaced (as they have in other regions) many of the native 
ant species in the fynbos. In addition, she discovered that the 
native  ant  species  most  impacted  by Argentine  ant  invasion 
are those species most likely to disperse larger seeds.     

Figure 17.19  The Argentine ant,  Linepithema humile,  has invaded 
and disrupted ant communities in many geographic regions. In the 
 fynbos of South Africa, invading Argentine ants are displacing  keystone 
ant species, which threatens the exceptional plant diversity of the fynbos.

Recruitment of seedlings 
by large-seeded plants is 
strongly suppressed 
following fires in areas 
invaded by Argentine ants.

reduction in recruitment following fire. Christian’s results, like 
Bshary’s, reveal the influence of mutualists acting as keystone 
species within the communities they occupy. Other studies are 
revealing the importance of other mutualists, such as pollinators 
and mycorrhizal fungi, as keystone species. 

Native hunters in 
Amazonian Peru 
hunt 18% of 
available nonflying 
mammal species.      

However, the few mammal 
species hunted make up 
over 75% of available 
mammal biomass.      

  Concept 17.4 Review 

1.   Bshary  studied  changes  in  fish  species  richness  in 
response to both natural and experimental removals and 
additions of the cleaner fish  Labroides dimidiatus  (see 
 fig. 17.18 ). Why did he not just focus on the response of 
fish species richness to natural additions and removals 
of the cleaner fish?  

     2.   In  many  regions,  native  pollinator  insects  seem  to  be 
declining. Why is this a cause for concern among con-
servationists and ecologists?    

  Applications 

 Human Modification of Food Webs 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 17.18  Explain how human hunting of a relatively small 

percentage of animal species in tropical rain 
 forest can have a massive impact on the rain forest 
community.

 17.19  Describe how farmers have used ants as keystone 
species to reduce pest populations in agricultural 
ecosystems.

 People  have  long  manipulated  food  webs  both  as  a  conse-
quence  of  their  own  feeding  activities  and  by  introducing 
or deleting species from existing webs. In addition, many of 
these manipulations have focused on keystone species. Con-
sequently,  either  consciously  or  unwittingly,  people  have, 
themselves, acted as keystone species in communities.   

  The Empty Forest: Hunters and Tropical Rain 
Forest Animal Communities 
 The current plight of the tropical rain forest is well known. 
However,  Kent  Redford  (1992)  points  out  that  with  few 
exceptions, most studies of human impact on the tropical rain 
forest have concentrated on direct effects of humans on vege-
tation, mainly on deforestation. Redford expands our view by 
examining the effects of humans on animals. The picture that 
emerges from this analysis is that humans have so reduced the 
population densities of rain forest animals in many areas that 
they no longer play their keystone roles in the system, a situa-
tion Redford calls “ecologically extinct.”

Figure 17.21  Highly selective hunting by Amazonian natives 
(data from Redford 1992).

 Redford estimated that subsistence hunting, a major source 
of  protein  for  many  rural  people,  results  in  an  annual  death 
toll of approximately 14 million mammals and 5  million birds 
and reptiles within the Brazilian Amazon. He estimated further 
that commercial hunters, seeking skins, meat, and feathers, kill 
an  additional  4  million  animals   annually.   Consequently,  the 
total take by hunters within the Brazilian Amazon is approxi-
mately  23  million  individual  animals.  However,  this  figure 
underestimates the total number of animal deaths, since many 
wounded animals escape from hunters only to die. Including 
those fatally wounded animals that escape, Redford places the 
annual deaths within the Brazilian Amazon at approximately 
60 million animals. 

 Hunters  generally  concentrate  on  a  small  percentage 
of  larger  bird  and  mammal  species,  however.  For  instance, 
Redford  estimated  that  at  Cocha  Cashu  Biological  Station 
in  Manu  National  Park,  located  in  the Amazon  River  basin 
in  eastern  Peru,  hunters  concentrate  on  9%  of  the  319  bird 
species and 18% of the 67 mammal species. Because hunters 
generally concentrate on the larger species, this small portion 
of the total species pool makes up about 52% of the total bird 
biomass and approximately 75% of the total mammalian bio-
mass around Manu National Park ( fig. 17.21 ).     

 As impressive as all these numbers are, there remains a 
critical question: Do hunters reduce the local densities of the

The fire ant, Solenopsis,

of arthropods on corn.

natural enemies and studies of the influences of keystone spe-
cies, citing studies of the influences of herbivores on plant com-
munities and the effects of predators on intertidal communities. 
In their own experiments, Risch and Carroll demonstrated how 
predation by  Solenopsis  in the corn and squash agro-ecosystem 
reduces  the  number  of  arthropods  and  the  arthropod  diversity 
( fig. 17.23 ). This study showed how  Solenopsis  could act as a 
keystone species to the benefit of the agriculturist.     

 The conceptual breakthrough represented by the work of 
Risch and Carroll is impressive. However, their work had been 
anticipated, 1,700 years earlier, by farmers in southern China. 
H. Huang and P. Yang (1987) cite Ji Han, who, in  a.d.  304, 
wrote “Plants and Trees of the Southern Regions” in which he 
included the following: 

  The  Gan  (mandarin  orange)  is  a  kind  of  orange  with  an 
exceptionally sweet and delicious taste . . . In the market, 
the natives of Jiao-zhi [southeastern China and North Viet-
nam] sell ants stored in bags of rush mats. The nests are 
like thin silk. The bags are all attached to twigs and leaves, 
which, with the ants inside the nests, are for sale. The ants 
are reddish-yellow in color, bigger than ordinary ants. In 
the south, if the Gan trees do not have this kind of ant, the 
fruits will be damaged by many harmful insects and not a 
single fruit will be perfect.  

 Now,  17  centuries  after  the  observations  of  Ji  Han,  we 
know this ant as the citrus ant,  Oecophylla smaragdina.  The 
use of this ant to control herbivorous insects in citrus orchards 
was  unknown  outside  of  China  until  1915.  In  1915, Walter 
Swingle, a plant physiologist who worked for the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, was sent to China to search for varieties 
of oranges resistant to citrus canker, a disease that was dev-
astating citrus groves in Florida. While on this trip, Swingle 
came across a small village where the main occupation of the 
people was growing ants for sale to orange growers. The ant 
was the same one described by Ji Han in  a.d.  304. 

  Oecophylla,  a weaver ant, uses silk to construct a nest by 
binding leaves and twigs together. These ants spend the night 
in their nest. During the day, the ants spread out over the home

birds  and  mammals  they  hunt?  The  answer  is  yes.  Redford 
estimated that moderate to heavy hunting pressure in rain for-
ests reduces mammalian biomass by about 80% to 93% and 
bird biomass by about 70% to 94%. 

 There may be cause for concern, however, that goes beyond 
the losses of these immense numbers of animals. As you might 
expect, many large rain forest mammals and birds may act as 
keystone species ( fig. 17.22 ). If so, their decimation will have 
effects that ripple through the entire community. The first to 
suggest a keystone role for the large animals preferred by rain 
forest  hunters  was  John Terborgh  (1988),  who  presented  his 
hypothesis in a provocative essay titled, “The Big Things That 
Run the World.” Terborgh’s hypothesis has been supported by 
a variety of studies. He observed that in the absence of pumas 
and  jaguars  on  Barro  Colorado  Island,  Panama,  medium-
sized mammal species are over 10 times more abundant than 
in  areas  still  supporting   populations  of  these  large  cats.  In 
other studies, Terborgh and colleagues  (Terborgh et al. 2001, 
2006) documented changes in  community  structure following 
the  isolation  of  small  tropical  forest  fragments  on  islands  in 
a  Venezuelan hydroelectric impoundment that excluded large 
predators.  The  consequent  changes  in  community  structure 
were  so  massive  that  Terborgh  and  colleagues  characterized 
them as “ecological meltdown.” Such observations prompted 
Redford to warn, “We must not let a forest full of trees fool 
us into believing all is well.” Tropical rain forest conservation 
must also include the large, and potentially keystone, animal 
species that are vulnerable to hunting by humans.      

  Ants and Agriculture: Keystone Predators for 
Pest Control 
 In 1982, Stephen Risch and Ronald Carroll published a paper 
describing  how  the  predaceous  fire  ant,   Solenopsis  geminata,  
acts as a keystone predator in the food web of the corn and squash 
agroecosystem  in  southern  Mexico.  While  “natural  enemies” 
had been used to control insect pests for some time, Risch and 
Carroll put these efforts into a community context. They drew 
conceptual parallels between biological control of insects with

tree as they forage for insects. Farmers place a nest in a tree 
and then run bamboo strips between trees so that the ants can 
have  access  to  more  than  one  tree.  The  ants  will  eventually 
build nests in adjacent trees and can colonize an entire orchard. 
 The ants harvest protein and fats when they gather insects 
from their home tree, but they have other needs as well. They 
also need a source of liquid and carbohydrates, and they get 
these materials by cultivating Homoptera, known as soft-scale 
insects  or  mealy  bugs,  which  produce  nectar.  The  ants  and 
soft-scale insects have a mutualistic relationship in which the 
ants transport the insects from tree to tree and protect them 
from  predators.  In  return  the  ants  consume  the  nectar  pro-
duced  by  the  soft-scale  insects.  Because  of  this  mutualism 
with the soft-scale insect, which can itself be a serious pest 
of citrus, several early agricultural scientists expressed skep-
ticism  that   Oecophylla   would  be  an  effective  agent  for  pest 
control in citrus. They suggested that the use of this ant could 
produce infestations by soft-scale insects. 

 Despite these criticisms, all Chinese citrus growers inter-
viewed  insisted  that   Oecophylla   is  effective  at  pest  control 
and  that  the  damage  caused  by  soft-scale  insects  is  minor. 
Research done by Yang appears to have solved this apparent 
contradiction. Comparing orange trees treated with chemical 
insecticides to those protected by  Oecophylla,  Yang recorded 
higher  numbers  of  soft-scale  insects  in  the  trees  tended  by 
ants. However, these higher numbers did not appear to cause 
serious  damage  to  the  orange  trees.  When  Yang  inspected 
the soft-scale insects closely, he found that they were heav-
ily infested with the larvae of parasitic wasps. He also found 
that  the  ants  did  not  reduce  populations  of  lacewing  larvae 
and ladybird beetles, predators that feed on soft-scale insects. 
Huang  and Yang  concluded  that   Oecophylla   is  effective  at 
pest control because while it attacks the principal, larger pests 
of citrus, it does not reduce populations of other predators that 
attack  the  smaller  pests  of  citrus,  such  as  soft-scale  insects, 
aphids, and mites ( fig. 17.24 ).     

 The  association  between   Oecophylla   and  citrus  trees 
seems similar to that between ants and acacias (see chapter 15). 
There is a difference, however. Humans maintain  Oecophylla  
as a substantial component of the food web in citrus orchards. 
Not only have specialized farmers historically cultivated and

17 centuries.

distributed the ants,  Oecophylla  must also be protected from 
the winter cold. The ant cannot survive the winter in southeast 
China in orange trees. Consequently, farmers must generally 
provide shelter and food for the ants during winter. 

 The labor and expense of maintaining these ants through 
the winter may be reduced by mixed plantings of orchard trees. 
Farmers  in  Shajian  village  in  the  Huaan  district  of  southeast 
China have successfully maintained  Oecophylla  over the winter 
in mixed plantings of orange and pomelo trees. During winter 
the ants are mostly in pomelo trees, which are larger and have 
thicker  foliage  than  orange  trees,  characteristics  that  reduce 
cooling rates on winter nights. In this situation, farmers do not 
have to add new nests of  Oecophylla  each spring. Gradually, 
the ant has become integrated into the mixed citrus and pomelo 
orchards and requires little special care from the farmers. 

 The  farmers  of  southeast  China  have  employed   Oeco-
phylla  as a keystone species in a complex citrus-based food 
web for a long time. However, the results would not be the 
same with just any ant species. The citrus growers required a 
species that acts in a particular way. One wonders how long 
farmers  of  the  region  had  experimented  with  this  species 
before Ji Han wrote his account of their activities in  a.d.  304.     

  A  food  web  summarizes  the  feeding  relations  in  a  com-
munity.  The  earliest  work  on  food  webs  concentrated  on 
simplified  communities  in  areas  such  as  the Arctic  islands. 
The  level  of  food  web  complexity  increased  substantially,  
however, as researchers began to study complex communities. 
Studies of the food webs of tropical freshwater fish communi-
ties revealed highly complex networks of trophic interaction 
that  persisted  even  in  the  face  of  various  simplifications. A 
focus on strong interactions can simplify food web structure 
and  identify  those  interactions  responsible  for  most  of  the 
energy flow in communities. 

  Indirect interactions between species are fundamental 
to communities.   Direct interspecific interactions can result in 
ecologically significant  indirect  interactions between species. 
In indirect interactions, one species affects another through a 
third,  intermediary  species.  Indirect  interactions  include  tro-
phic  cascades,  apparent  competition,  and  indirect  mutualism 
or  commensalism.  Indirect  commensalism  occurs  when  the 
activities of one species indirectly—that is, through an inter-
mediary species—benefit another species without itself being 
helped or harmed. In apparent competition, negative effects of 
one species on another are the result of the two species sharing

a predator or herbivore or by one species facilitating popula-
tions of a predator or herbivore of the second species. 

  The  feeding  activities  of  a  few  keystone  species  may 
control the structure of communities.   Robert Paine (1966) 
 proposed that the feeding activities of a few species have inor-
dinate  influences  on  community  structure.  He  predicted  that 
some predators may increase species diversity by reducing the 
probability of competitive exclusion. Manipulative studies of 
predaceous  species  have  identified  many  keystone  species, 
including sea stars and snails in the marine intertidal zone and 
fish  in  rivers.   Jane  Lubchenco  (1978)  demonstrated  that  the 
influence of consumers on community structure depends upon 
their  feeding  preferences,  their  local  population  density,  and 
the relative competitive abilities of prey species. Keystone spe-
cies are those that, despite low biomass, exert strong effects on 
the structure of the communities they inhabit. 

  Mutualists  can  act  as  keystone  species.   Experimen-
tal studies have shown that cleaner fish, species that remove 

parasites  from  other  fish,  act  as  keystone  species  on  coral 
reefs. Removing cleaner fish produces a decline in reef fish 
species richness. Ants that disperse plant seeds in the fynbos 
of  South Africa  have  been  shown  to  have  major  influences 
on  plant  community  structure.  Where  invading  ants  have 
displaced  the  mutualistic  dispersing  ants,  the  plant  com-
munity  suffers  a  decline  in  species  richness  following  fires. 
Other mutualistic organisms that may act as keystone species 
include pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi. 

 People have long manipulated food webs both as a con-
sequence of their own feeding activities and by introducing or 
deleting species from existing food webs. In addition, many 
of  these  manipulations  have  been  focused  on  keystone  spe-
cies.  Hunters  in  tropical  rain  forests  have  been  responsible 
for removing keystone animal species from large areas of the 
rain  forests  of  Central  and  South America.  Chinese  farmers 
have used ants as keystone predators to control pests in citrus 
orchards for over 1,700 years.

  Review Questions 

     1.  Winemiller  (1990)  deleted  “weak”  trophic  links  from  one  set 
of food webs that he described for fish communities in Venezu-
ela (see  fig. 17.3 ). What was his criterion for designating weak 
interactions?  Earlier,  Paine  (1980)  suggested  that  ecologists 
could learn something by focusing on “strong” links in commu-
nities. How did Paine’s criterion for determining a strong link 
differ from Winemiller’s?  

    2.  What is a keystone species? Paine (1966, 1969) experimented 
with  two  sea  stars  that  act  as  keystone  species  in  their  inter-
tidal communities along the west coast of North America and in 
New Zealand. Describe how the intertidal communities in these 
two  areas  are  similar.  Describe  the  differences  between  these 
two  communities  and  the  differences  in  the  design  of  Paine’s 
experiments in these two areas.  

    3.  Explain  how  the  experiments  of  Lubchenco  (1978)  showed 
that  feeding  preferences,  population  density,  and  competitive 
relations  among  food  species  all  potentially  contribute  to  the 
influences  of  “keystone”  consumers  on  the  structure  of  com-
munities. What refinements did the work of Lubchenco add to 
the keystone species hypothesis?  

    4.  When  Power  (1990)  excluded  predaceous  fish  from  her  river 
sites,  the  density  of  herbivorous  insect  larvae  (chironomids) 
decreased. Use the food web described by Power to explain this 
response.  

    5.  Using Tscharntke’s food web (1992) shown in  figure 17.5 , pre-
dict which species would be most affected if you excluded the 
bird at the top of the web,  Parus caeruleus.  What species would 
be affected less? Assume that  P. caeruleus  is a keystone species 
in this community.  

    6.  Some  paleontologists  have  proposed  that  overhunting  caused 
the extinction of many large North American mammals at the 
end of the Pleistocene about 11,000 and 10,000 years ago. The 
hunters  implicated  by  paleontologists  were  a  newly  arrived 
predatory  species,   Homo  sapiens.   Offer  arguments  for  and 
against this hypothesis.  

    7.  All the keystone species work we have discussed in chapter 17 
has concerned the influences of animals on the structure of com-
munities. Can other groups of organisms act as keystones? What 
about parasites and pathogens?

 Ecosystem  ecologists  study  the  flows  of  energy,  water, 
and nutrients in ecosystems and, as suggested by Tansley, pay 
as much attention to physical and chemical processes as they 
do  to  biological  ones.  Some  fundamental  areas  of  interest 
for  ecosystem  ecologists  are  primary  production,  secondary 
 production, and nutrient cycling. We will discuss the first two 
topics in chapter 18 and nutrient cycling in chapter 19. 

 We saw in chapter 7 how the photosynthetic machinery 
of plants uses solar energy to synthesize sugars. In chapter 7, 
we  considered  photosynthesis  from  the  perspective  of  the 
individual grass, tree, or cactus. Here we step back from the 
biochemical and physiological details of photosynthesis, and 
back even from the individual organism, to look at photo syn-
thesis at the level of the whole ecosystem. 

    Primary  production     is  the  production  of  new  organic 
matter, or biomass, by autotrophs in an ecosystem  during some 
period of time, for example, per hour or per year.  Ecosystem 
ecologists  distinguish  between  gross  and  net 
 primary 
 production.     Gross  primary  production     is  the  total  amount 
of  biomass produced by all the autotrophs in the  ecosystem. 
   Net primary production    is the amount of biomass left over 
after autotrophs have met their own energetic needs. Net pri-
mary production is gross primary production minus respira-
tion by primary producers; it is the amount of energy in the 
form of biomass available to the consumers in an ecosystem. 
 Secondary production is the production of biomass by het-
erotrophic  consumer  organisms  feeding  on  plants,  animals, 
microbes, fungi, or detritus during some period of time, for 
example, per hour or per year. Secondary production, which 
is  analogous  to  net  primary  production,  includes  consumer 
growth, reproduction, and, at the population level, mortality. 
Ecologists have measured primary production in a variety of 
ways but mainly as the rate of carbon uptake by primary pro-
ducers or by the amount of biomass or oxygen produced. 

 We discussed feeding biology from a variety of perspec-
tives in previous chapters. In chapter 7, we examined the biol-
ogy of herbivores, detritivores, and carnivores. In chapter 14, 
we discussed the ecology of exploitative interactions, and in 
chapter 17, we used food webs as a means of representing the 
trophic  structure  of  communities.  Ecosystem  ecologists  are 
also concerned with trophic structure but have taken a differ-
ent approach than population and community ecologists. 

 Ecosystem  ecologists  have  simplified  the  trophic  struc-
ture  of  ecosystems  by  arranging  species  into  trophic  levels 
based on the predominant source of their nutrition. A     trophic 
level     is  a  position  in  a  food  web  and  is  determined  by  the 
number of transfers of energy from primary producers to that 
level. Primary producers occupy the first trophic level in eco-
systems since they use inorganic forms of energy, principally 
light,  to  convert  CO 2   into  biomass.  Herbivores  and  detriti-
vores  are  often  called  primary  consumers  and  occupy  the 
second  trophic  level.  Carnivores  feeding  on  herbivores  and 
detritivores  are  called  secondary  consumers  and  occupy  the 
third trophic level. Predators that feed on carnivores occupy 
a  fourth  trophic  level.  Since  each  trophic  level  may  contain 
several  species,  in  some  cases  hundreds,  an  ecosystem  per-
spective simplifies trophic structure.

source of energy to power all biological activity, such as the singing of 
this tree frog and the growth of the plant on which it sits.

In most ecosystems, sunlight provides the ultimate 

absorbed  by  the  molecules  in  organisms,  soil,  and  water, 
increasing  their  kinetic  state  and  raising  the  temperature  of 
the forest. Forest temperature affects the rate of biochemical 
reactions and transpiration by forest vegetation. 

 Forest  plants  use  photosynthetically  active  radiation,  or 
PAR  (see  chapter  7),  to  convert  CO 2   into  sugars  and  other 
forms of biomass, a process referred to as carbon fixation. The 
plants  use  some  of  the  chemical  energy  in  biomass  to  meet 
their own energy needs. Some fixed carbon goes directly into 
plant growth: to produce new leaves, to lengthen the tendrils 
of vines, to grow new root hairs, and so forth. Some biomass 
is stored as nonstructural carbohydrates, which act as energy 
stores in roots, seeds, or fruits. 

 A portion of the biomass produced by forest vegetation 
is  consumed  by  herbivores,  some  is  consumed  by  detriti-
vores, and some ends up as soil organic matter. The energy 
contained in the biomass produced by forest vegetation pow-
ers bird flight through the forest canopy and fuels the muscle 
contractions of earthworms as they burrow through the forest 
soil. The  forest  vegetation is sunlight transformed, as are all 
the associated  bacteria, fungi, and animals and all their activi-
ties ( fig. 18.1 ).     

 We  can  view  a  forest  as  a  system  that  absorbs,  trans-
forms,  and  stores  energy.  In  this  view,  physical,  chemical, 
and   biological  structures  and  processes  are  inseparable. 
When  we  look  at  a  forest  (or  stream  or  coral  reef)  in  this 
way,  we  view  it  as  an  ecosystem. As  we  saw  in  chapter  1, 
an ecosystem is a  biological community plus all of the abi-
otic factors  influencing that community. The term  ecosystem  
and  its  definition  were  first  proposed  in  1935  by  the  Brit-
ish ecologist Arthur  Tansley, who realized the importance of 
considering organisms and their environment as an integrated 
system.  Tansley  wrote:  “Though  the  organisms  may  claim 
our primary interest, . . . we cannot separate them from their 
special environment, with which they form one physical sys-
tem. It is the [eco]systems so formed which, from the point 
of view of the ecologist, are the basic units of nature on the 
face of the earth.”

Section V 

  Communities and Ecosystems

 Primary  production,  the  conversion  of  inorganic  forms 
of energy into organic forms, is a key ecosystem process. All 
consumer organisms, including humans, depend upon primary 
production for their existence. Because of its importance and 
because rates of primary production vary substantially from 
one ecosystem to another, ecosystem ecologists study the fac-
tors controlling rates of primary production in ecosystems. 

 Patterns of natural variation in primary production pro-
vide  clues  to  the  environmental  factors  that  control  this 
key  ecosystem  process.  Experiments  test  the  importance  of 
those controls. In chapter 18, we discuss the major patterns 
of  variation  in  primary  production  in  terrestrial  and  aquatic 
ecosystems  and  key  experiments  designed  to  determine  the 
mechanisms producing those patterns. In the last sections of 
chapter 18, we consider secondary production and the use of 
stable isotope analysis to verify feeding habits of consumers.  

   18.1  Patterns of Terrestrial 

Primary Production 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 18.4  Describe the relationship between evapotranspiration 
and net primary production in terrestrial ecosystems.
 18.5  Discuss evidence showing that nutrient  availability 

can limit primary production in terrestrial 
ecosystems.

 18.6  Design an experiment to test whether  nutrient 

 availability limits primary production in a 
 particular terrestrial ecosystem.

Terrestrial  primary  production  is  generally  limited  by 
temperature,  moisture,  and  nutrients.   As  we  surveyed 
the  major  terrestrial  biomes  in  chapter  2,  you  probably  got 
a  sense  of  the  geographic  variation  in  rates  of  primary  pro-
duction. Perhaps you also developed a feeling for the major 
environmental  correlates  with  that  variation.  The  variables 
most  highly  correlated  with  variation  in  terrestrial  primary 
production  are   temperature   and   moisture.   Highest  rates  of 
terrestrial  primary  production  generally  occur  under  warm, 
moist conditions.  

   Actual Evapotranspiration 
and Terrestrial Primary Production 
 Michael  Rosenzweig  (1968)  estimated  the  influence  of 
moisture and temperature on rates of primary production by 
plotting the relationship between annual net primary produc-
tion  and  annual  actual  evapotranspiration.  Annual     actual 
evapotranspiration  (AET)     is  the  total  amount  of  water 
that   evaporates  and  transpires  off  a  landscape  during  the 
course of a year and is measured in millimeters of water per 
year. The AET   process  is  affected  by  both  temperature  and 
 precipitation. The  ecosystems  showing  the  highest  levels  of 
primary  production are those that are warm and receive large

 Relationship between actual evapotranspiration and 

amounts  of  precipitation.  Conversely,  ecosystems  show  low 
levels  of  AET  either  because  they  receive  little  precipita-
tion, are very cold, or both. For instance, both hot deserts and 
 tundra exhibit low levels of AET. 

  Figure 18.2  shows Rosenzweig’s plot of the positive rela-
tionship between net primary production and AET, adjusted 
by later analyses by Michael Kaspari, Sean O’Donnell, and 
James  Kercher  (2000).  Tropical  forests  show  the  highest 
levels of net primary production and AET. At the other end 
of the spectrum, hot, dry deserts and cold, dry tundra show 
the  lowest  levels.  Intermediate  levels  occur  in  temperate 
 forests, temperate grasslands, woodlands, and high-elevation 
 forests.  Figure 18.2  shows that AET accounts for a significant 
 proportion of the variation in annual net primary production 
among terrestrial ecosystems.     

 Rosenzweig’s analysis attempts to explain variation in pri-
mary production across the whole spectrum of terrestrial eco-
systems. What controls variation in primary  production within 
similar ecosystems? Osvaldo E. Sala and his  colleagues (1988) 
at  Colorado  State  University  explored  the  factors   controlling 
primary  production  in  the  central  grassland  region  of  the 
United States. Their study was based on data collected by the 
U.S.  Department  of Agriculture  Soil  Conservation  Service  at 
9,498 sites. To make this large data set more manageable, the 
researchers grouped the sites into 100 representative study areas. 
 The  study  areas  extended  from  Mississippi  and Arkan-
sas in the east, to New Mexico and Montana in the west, and 
from  North  Dakota  to  southern  Texas.  Primary  production

known that adding fertilizers to soil can increase agricultural 
production. However, it was not until the nineteenth century 
that  scientists  began  to  quantify  the  influence  of  specific 
nutrients,  such  as  nitrogen  (N)  or  phosphorus  (P),  on  rates 
of primary production. Justus Liebig (1840) pointed out that 
nutrient supplies often limit plant growth. He also suggested 
that  nutrient  limitation  to  plant  growth  could  be  traced  to  a 
single limiting nutrient. This hypothetical control of primary 
production by a single nutrient was later called “Liebig’s Law 
of the Minimum.” We now know that Liebig’s perspective was 
too simplistic. Usually several factors, including a number of 
nutrients,  simultaneously  affect  levels  of  terrestrial  primary 
production. However, his work led the way to a concept that 
remains true today; variation in soil fertility can significantly 
affect rates of terrestrial primary production. 

 Ecologists have increased primary production by adding 
nutrients to a wide variety of terrestrial ecosystems, includ-
ing arctic tundra, alpine tundra, grasslands, deserts, and for-
ests.  For  instance,  Gaius  Shaver  and  Stuart  Chapin  (1986) 
studied  the  potential  for  nutrient  limitation  in  arctic  tun-
dra.  They  added  commercial  fertilizer  containing  nitrogen, 
phosphorus,  and  potassium  to  several  tundra  ecosystems  in 
Alaska. They made a single application of fertilizer to half of 
their experimental plots and two applications to the remain-
ing experimental plots. 

 Shaver  and  Chapin  measured  net  primary  production 
at their control and experimental sites 2 to 4 years after the 
first  nutrient  additions.  Nutrient  additions  increased  net  pri-
mary  production  (by  23%–300%)  at  all  of  the  study  sites. 
The response to fertilization was substantial and clear at most 
study sites. Four years after the initial application of fertilizer, 
net primary production on Kuparuk Ridge, for instance, was 
twice as high on the fertilized plots compared to the unfertil-
ized control plots ( fig. 18.4 ).

was highest in the eastern grassland study areas and lowest in 
the western study areas. This east–west variation corresponds 
to the westward changes from tall-grass prairie to short-grass 
prairie that we reviewed in chapter 2. Sala and his colleagues 
found  that  this  east–west  variation  in  primary  production 
among grassland ecosystems correlated significantly with the 
amount of rainfall ( fig. 18.3 ).   

 Compare the plot by Sala and his colleagues (see  fig. 18.3 ) 
with the one constructed by Rosenzweig (see  fig. 18.2 ). How 
are  they  similar?  How  are  they  different?  Both  graphs  have 
primary production plotted on the vertical axis as a dependent 
variable. However, while the Rosenzweig plot includes eco-
systems ranging from tundra to tropical rain forest, the plot by 
Sala and his colleagues includes grasslands only. In addition, 
different  variables  are  plotted  on  the  horizontal  axes  of  the 
two graphs. While Rosenzweig plotted actual evapotranspira-
tion, which depends upon temperature and precipitation, Sala 
and his colleagues plotted precipitation only. They found that 
including temperature in their analysis did not improve their 
ability to predict net primary production. 

 These researchers found strong correlations between AET 
or  precipitation  and  rates  of  terrestrial  primary  production. 
However, their models did not completely explain the varia-
tion in primary production among the study ecosystems. For 
instance,  in   figure  18.2   ecosystems  with  annual AET   levels 
of  500  to  600  mm  of  water  showed  annual  rates  of  primary 
production ranging from 300 to 1,000 g per square meter. In 
 figure 18.3 , grassland ecosystems receiving 400 mm of annual 
precipitation had annual rates of primary  production ranging 
from about 100 to 250 g per square meter. These  differences 
in primary production challenge ecologists for an explanation.

explained  by  differences  in  soil  fertility.  Farmers  have  long

  Communities and Ecosystems

 Nutrient  additions  to  alpine  tundra  indicate  that  the 
response  of  ecosystems  to  nutrient  addition  is  affected  by 
prior  nutrient  availability.  William  Bowman  and  his  col-
leagues (1993) added nutrients to the alpine tundra on Niwot 
Ridge,  Colorado.  They  conducted  their  experiment  in  adja-
cent  dry  alpine  and  wet  alpine  meadows  at  an  elevation  of 
3,510 m. One of four treatments was applied in both the dry 
and wet alpine meadows: (1) control (no nutrient additions), 
(2)  nitrogen  added,  (3)  phosphorus  added,  and  (4)  nitrogen 
and  phosphorus  added.  The  researchers  then  measured  soil 
nitrogen  and  phosphorus  concentrations  and  annual  net  pri-
mary production in each study plot. 

 Initial concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorus were 
higher  in  the  wet  meadow  ecosystem.  And  while  fertilizing 
raised the concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorus in the 
dry meadow, fertilizing the wet meadow raised the concentra-
tion of nitrogen but not phosphorus. 

 Fertilizing produced greater increases in primary produc-
tion in the dry meadow than in the wet meadow. Adding nitro-
gen to the dry meadow increased primary production by 63%. 
Adding nitrogen  and  phosphorus increased primary produc-
tion by 178%. In contrast, the wet meadow showed relatively 
smaller but statistically significant responses to the additions 
of both nitrogen and phosphorus ( fig. 18.5 ). Bowman and his 
colleagues  suggest  that  these  results  show  that  nitrogen  is 
the main nutrient limiting net primary production in the dry 
meadow  and  that  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  jointly  limit  net 
primary production in the wet meadow.     

 Experiments  such  as  these  have  shown  that  despite  the 
major  influence  of  temperature  and  moisture  on  rates  of 
 primary  production  in  terrestrial  ecosystems,  variation  in 
nutrient  availability  can  also  have  measurable  influence. As 
we shall see in the next section, nutrient availability is the main 
factor limiting primary production in aquatic ecosystems.

  Concept 18.1 Review 

1.   Why was precipitation alone, without temperature, suf-
ficient to account for most of the variation in grassland 
net  primary  production  across  central  North  America 
(see  fig. 18.3 )?  

2.   How are the desert dune ecosystem and the arctic and 
alpine  tundra  ecosystems  indicated  in   figure  18.2   the 
same?  

 3.   How  would  actual  evapotranspiration  and  net  primary 
production  in  the  desert  dune  ecosystem,  which  is  a 
hot desert, and the arctic and alpine tundra ecosystems 
likely respond to a significant increase in precipitation?     

  18.2  Patterns of Aquatic 
Primary Production 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 18.7  Summarize the main factors limiting primary 

 production in aquatic ecosystems.

 18.8  Outline the types of evidence used to demonstrate 
nutrient limitation of primary production in aquatic 
ecosystems.

 18.9  Compare nutrient limitation in freshwater and 

marine ecosystems.

Aquatic primary production is generally limited by nutri-
ent  availability.   Limnologists  and  oceanographers  have 
measured rates of primary production and nutrient concentra-
tions  in  many  lakes  and  at  many  coastal  and   oceanic  study 
sites. These studies have produced one of the best- documented 
patterns  in  the  biosphere:  the  positive   relationship  between 
nutrient availability and rate of primary production in aquatic 
ecosystems.  

  Patterns and Models 
 A quantitative relationship between phosphorus, an essential 
plant nutrient, and phytoplankton biomass was first described 
for  a  series  of  lakes  in  Japan  (Hogetsu  and  Ichimura  1954; 
Ichimura  1956;  Sakamoto  1966).  The  ecologists  studying 
this  relationship  found  a  remarkably  good  correspondence 
between total phosphorus and phytoplankton biomass.   Later, 
Dillon and Rigler (1974) described a similar positive relation-
ship between phosphorus and phytoplankton biomass for lake 
ecosystems throughout the Northern Hemisphere ( fig. 18.6 ).     
 The data from Japan and North America strongly support 
the hypothesis that nutrients, particularly phosphorus, control 
phytoplankton biomass in lake ecosystems. However, what is 
the relationship between phytoplankton biomass and the rate 
of primary production? This relationship was explored by Val 
Smith (1979) for 49 lakes of the north temperate zone. The 
data  from  these  lakes  showed  a  strong  positive  correlation

 A whole lake experiment shows the effect of nutrient 

about  the  same  biomass  of  phytoplankton  as  two  reference 
lakes ( fig. 18.7 ). However, when experimenters began  adding 
nutrients,  the  phytoplankton  biomass  in  Lake  226  quickly 
surpassed that in the reference lakes. Phytoplankton  biomass 
remained  elevated  in  Lake  226  until  the  experimenters 
stopped adding fertilizer at the end of 1980. Then, from 1981 
to  1983  the  phytoplankton  biomass  in  Lake  226  declined 
significantly. 

     In  conclusion,  both  correlations—between  phosphorus 
concentration and rate of primary production, and whole lake 
experiments,  involving  nutrient  additions—support  the  gen-
eralization that nutrient availability controls rates of primary 
production in freshwater ecosystems. Now, let’s examine the 
evidence for this relationship in marine ecosystems.  

  Global Patterns of Marine 
Primary Production 
 The geographic distribution of net primary production in the 
sea  indicates  a  positive  influence  of  nutrient  availability  on 
rates  of  primary  production.  Oceanographers  have  observed 
that the highest rates of primary production by marine phy-
toplankton  are  generally  concentrated  in  areas  with  higher 
levels  of  nutrient  availability  ( fig.  18.8 ).  The  highest  rates 
of primary production are concentrated along the margins of 
continents  over  continental  shelves  and  in  areas  of  upwell-
ing. Along continental margins nutrients are renewed by run-
off  from  the  land  and  by  biological  or  physical  disturbance 
of bottom sediments. As we saw in chapter 3, the upwelling 
that  brings   nutrient-laden  water  from  the  depths  to  the  sur-
face is concentrated along the west coasts of continents and 
around the continent of Antarctica, areas that appear dark red 
on  figure 18.8 , indicating high to very high rates of primary 
production.

 Relationship between phosphorus concentration and 

between chlorophyll concentrations and between total phos-

ecologists  have  extended  these  correlational  studies  of  the 
relationship  between  nutrient  availability  and  primary  pro-
duction  by  manipulating  nutrient  availability  in  entire  lake 
ecosystems.  

  Whole Lake Experiments 
on Primary Production 
 The  Experimental  Lakes Area  was  founded  in  northwestern 
Ontario, Canada, in 1968, as a place in which aquatic ecolo-
gists  could  manipulate  whole  lake  ecosystems  (Mills  and 
Schindler  1987;  Findlay  and  Kasian  1987).  For  instance, 
 ecologists  manipulated  nutrient  availability  in  a  lake  called 
Lake 226. They used a vinyl curtain to divide Lake 226 into 
two 8 ha basins, each containing about 500,000 m 3  of water. 
Think  about  these  numbers  for  a  second.  This  was  a  huge 
 experiment! Each subbasin of Lake 226 was fertilized from 
1973 to 1980. The researchers added a mixture of carbon in 
the form of sucrose and nitrate to one basin, which increased 
phytoplankton  biomass two to four times, and carbon, nitrate, 
and  phosphate  to  the  other  basin,  which  increased  phyto-
plankton biomass four to eight times. They stopped fertilizing 
the lakes after 1980 and then studied the recovery of the Lake 
226 ecosystem from 1981 to 1983. 

 Both sides of Lake 226 responded significantly to nutri-
ent additions. Prior to the manipulation, Lake 226 supported

 Geographic variation in marine primary production (data from F.A.O. 1972). 

 Meanwhile,  the  central  portions  of  the  major  oceans 
show  low  levels  of  nutrient  availability  and  low  rates  of 
 primary  production.  The  main  source  of  nutrient  renewal 
in  the  surface  waters  of  the  open  ocean  is  vertical  mixing. 
 Vertical mixing is generally blocked in open tropical oceans 
by a permanent thermocline. Consequently, the surface waters 
of  open   tropical  oceans  contain  very  low  concentrations  of 
 nutrients  and  show  some  of  the  lowest  rates  of  marine  pri-
mary production. 

 What  is  the  experimental  evidence  for  nutrient  limita-
tion  of  marine  primary  production?  Edna  Granéli  and  her 
 colleagues  (1990)  have  used  nutrient  enrichment  to  test 
whether nutrient availability limits primary production in the 
Baltic Sea. 

 In a test using a single algal species, Granéli added nutri-
ents to filtered seawater from a series of study sites. She added 
nitrate to one experimental group, phosphates to another, and 
nothing to a third group of flasks ( fig. 18.9 ). Notice that the 
flasks with additional nitrate showed increased chlorophyll  a  
concentrations  at  all  sites,  while  the  flasks  with  additional 
phosphate had chlorophyll  a  concentrations very similar to the 
control flasks. What do these results indicate? They suggest 
that the rate of primary production in the Baltic Sea is limited 
by nutrients. However, in contrast to most freshwater lakes, 
the limiting nutrient appears to be nitrogen, not phosphorus.   

 Granéli  did  similar  enrichment  studies  along  a  series 
of stations in the Kattegat, the Belt Sea, and the Skagerrak, 
where the salinity approaches that of the open ocean. How-
ever, in this second series of experiments, she used indigenous 
phytoplankton rather than a single standardized test species. 
Once again the concentrations of chlorophyll  a  were higher in 

the flasks to which nitrate had been added whereas the control 
and phosphate treatment groups were virtually indistinguish-
able. Again, the results indicate nitrogen limitation along vir-
tually the entire study area. 

 Dillon and Rigler suggested that limnologists pay atten-
tion to the scatter of points around lines showing a relation-
ship  between  nutrient  concentrations  and  phytoplankton 
biomass (F.A.O. 1972). We call that scatter of points  residual 
variation.   Residual  variation  is  that  proportion  of  variation 
not  explained  by  the  independent  variable,  in  this  case,  by 
nutrient concentration. Dillon and Rigler suggested that envi-
ronmental  factors  besides  nutrient  availability  significantly 
influence phytoplankton biomass. One of those factors is the 
intensity of predation on the zooplankton that feed on phyto-
plankton. As we shall see next, primary producer diversity can 
also influence rates of primary production in both terrestrial 
and aquatic ecosystems. 

  Concept 18.2 Review 

      1.   Suppose  that  when  you  add  nitrogen  to  one-half  of  a 
lake, you observe no change in phytoplankton biomass, 
but when you add phosphorus to the other half of the 
lake, phytoplankton biomass more than doubles. What 
is the most likely explanation of your results?  

     2.   Suppose you fertilize a lake with nitrogen only, phos-
phorus only, and nitrogen plus phosphorus and observe 
no change in phytoplankton biomass. What is the most 
likely explanation of your results?

18.3  Primary Producer Diversity 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 18.10  List several components of overall biodiversity.
 18.11  Distinguish between plant species diversity and plant 

functional diversity.

 18.12  Discuss experimental evidence for a positive 

relationship between primary producer diversity 
and primary production in terrestrial and aquatic 
ecosystems.

Primary producer diversity contributes to higher primary 
production.  Studies  reviewed  in  sections  18.1  and  18.2 

 demonstrate clearly that physical and chemical factors affect 
rates  of  primary  production  in  both  terrestrial  and  aquatic 
 ecosystems. However, researchers have found that a  number 
of  biological  factors  can  also  influence  rates  of  primary 
 production. In section 18.3, we consider the contributions of 
primary  producer  diversity  to  rates  of  primary  production. 
Our discussions of diversity thus far have focused on species
diversity, the subject of chapter 16. We should note,  however, 
that  several  other  aspects  of  biological  diversity,  generally 
shortened  to  biodiversity,  are  of  potential  importance  to 
 ecological  processes,  including  primary  production.  Other 
facets of biodiversity include genetic, physiological, anatomi-
cal, and ecosystem diversity.

Terrestrial Plant Diversity 
and Primary Production
David Tilman of the University of Minnesota and  colleagues 
have done extensive research on the influences of plant diver-
sity  on  ecosystem  processes,  including  primary   production. 
In  an  early  study  (Tilman  et  al.  2001),  they  examined 
the  effects  of  plant  species  diversity  and  plant  functional 
groups  on   primary  production.  A  plant  functional  group
consists  of  plants  with  similar  physiological  and  anatomi-
cal   characteristics  that  influence  their  seasonality,  resource 
requirements, and life histories. Examples of plant functional 
groups include C3 grasses (see chapter 7, p. 152), which grow 
best at cool temperatures, C4 grasses (see chapter 7, p. 153), 
which grow best in warm conditions, and legumes, which fix 
nitrogen. Additional functional groups included in the study 
were forbs and woody plants.

Tilman and colleagues estimated primary production on 
168 study plots, each measuring 9 m by 9 m, where the team 
varied  the  number  of  plant  species  and  the  plant  functional 
groups  present. The  species  planted  in  the  study  plots  were 
chosen randomly from a pool of 18 species and varied from 
1 species, which were monocultures, up to a maximum of 16. 
Plots were seeded with 10 g of seed per m2 in May 1994 and 
5 g per m2 in May 1995, with the seed mass divided equally 
among the species planted. To maintain the experimental con-
ditions,  researchers  regularly  weeded  study  plots  to  remove 
any species not part of the experimental design. 

Primary  production  was  estimated  once  per  year  for 
7  years,  during  the  period  of  peak  living  plant  biomass  on 
study  plots.  Aboveground  primary  production  in  each  plot 
was estimated by clipping the aboveground plant biomass in 
four 0.1 m by 3.0 m strips per plot. Below ground, root pro-
duction  was  estimated  from  three  5  cm  diameter  by  30  cm 
deep  soil  cores  taken  in  each  clipped  strip. Areas  sampled 
were clipped and cored only once during the 7 years of the 
study. In the laboratory, plant biomass samples were sorted, to 
separate living from nonliving biomass, dried, and weighed.

The results of the study indicate strong influences of plant 
diversity  on  primary  production.  The  number  of  plant  spe-
cies  (i.e.,  plant  species  richness),  in  experimental  plots  was 
positively correlated with both aboveground and total  primary 
production  during  all  7  years  of  the  study.  Figure  18.10

shows the positive relationship between plant  species  richness 
and  aboveground  primary  production  and  total   biomass 
 (aboveground plus belowground biomass) in 2000, the seventh 
year of the study. In that year, plots planted with 16 species 
averaged nearly three times the aboveground  primary produc-
tion and total biomass observed in plots planted with a single 
species (i.e., in monocultures). Functional group composition 
was  also  important.  In  particular,  experimental  plots  planted 
with  two  particular  plant  functional  groups,  nitrogen-fixing 
legumes  and  C4  grasses,  supported  higher  levels  of  primary 
production  on  average.  Follow-up  analyses  indicated  that 
functional group composition and plant species richness were 
of  approximately  equal  importance  to  primary  production. 
The  joint  effects  of  species  richness  and  functional  groups 
strengthened during the course of the experiment, accounting 
for approximately one third of variation in primary production 

across study plots at the beginning of the study and increasing 
to two thirds of the variation by the end.

How do the effects of diversity on rates of primary pro-
duction  in  terrestrial  ecosystems  compare  to  the  effects  of 
chemical  and  physical  factors?  In  some  cases,  biological 
influences on primary production have been shown to be just 
as significant as those of temperature, moisture, and nutrients. 
For  example,  David  Tilman,  Peter  Reich,  and  Forest  Isbell 
found that increasing plant species richness in experimental 
plots  from  4  to  16  species  increased  primary  production  as 
much  as  adding  54  kg  of  nitrogen  fertilizer  per  hectare  per 
year (Tilman, Reich, and Isbell 2012). 

Algal Diversity and Aquatic Primary 
Production
Primary  producer  diversity  has  also  been  shown  to  increase 
primary  production  in  experimental  aquatic  ecosystems.  For 
example,  Bradley  Cardinale  of  the  University  of  Michigan 
studied  the  influence  of  algal  species  richness  on  nutrient 
uptake and algal biomass in 150 small experimental streams 
(Cardinale 2011). The results of his study show a clear increase 
in nitrate uptake and biomass with increasing number of algal 
species. The positive effect of diversity was particularly strong 
in Cardinale’s study in experiments that provided varied physi-
cal conditions analogous to those found in nature (fig. 18.11).

One of the greatest challenges to ecology is to determine 
the extent to which knowledge gained from small-scale experi-
mental studies, such as those of Tilman and Cardinale, can be 
extrapolated to patterns and processes occurring on landscape 
and  regional  scales. A  number  of  studies  indicate  that  higher 
primary  producer  diversity  is  associated  with  higher  primary 
production at these larger scales. For example, using data from 
1,157 lakes in the United States, Emily Zimmerman and Bradley 
Cardinale (2014) found that, along with availability of nitrogen 
and phosphorus, algal diversity significantly correlated with lake 
primary production. On land, tree diversity has been linked to 
higher primary production across a sample of 12,000 Canadian 
and  54,000  Spanish  forest  study  plots  (Paquette  and  Messier 
2011; Ruiz-Benito et al. 2014). In the next section we consider 
the effects of consumers on rates of primary production.

Concept 18.3 Review

  1.  What  component  of  species  diversity  (see  chapter  16, 
p. 360) did Tilman’s research group manipulate in their 
studies?  What  other  components  of  species  diversity 
could influence rates of primary production?

  2.  What does the effect of legumes on primary production 
in  the  Tilman  experiment  suggest  about  other  factors 
limiting production on the experimental plots?

  3.  If plant species richness and functional group composi-
tion accounted for one third to two thirds of variation 
in  primary  production  across  study  plots,  what  other 
 factors likely accounted for the remainder of  differences 
in primary production among plots?

production.  More  recently,  ecologists  have  discovered  that 
primary production is also affected by consumers. Ecologists 
refer  to  the  influences  of  physical  and  chemical  factors  on 
ecosystems, such as temperature and nutrients, as     bottom-up 
controls.     The  influences  of  consumers  on  ecosystems  are 
known as    top-down controls.    In the previous two sections we 
discussed bottom-up controls on rates of primary production. 
Here we discuss top-down control.  

  Piscivores, Planktivores, and Lake 
Primary Production 
 Stephen  Carpenter,  James  Kitchell,  and  James  Hodgson 
(1985)  proposed  that  while  nutrient  inputs  determine  the 
potential  rate  of  primary  production  in  a  lake,  piscivorous 
and planktivorous fish can cause significant deviations from 
potential primary production. In support of their hypothesis, 
Carpenter and his colleagues (1991) cited a negative correla-
tion between zooplankton size, an indication of grazing inten-
sity, and primary production. 

 Carpenter  and  Kitchell  (1988)  proposed  that  the  influ-
ences  of  consumers  on  lake  primary  production  propagate 
through food webs. Since they visualized the effects of con-
sumers coming from the top of food webs to the base, they 
called these effects on ecosystem properties    trophic  cascades.  
A trophic cascade involves effects of predators on prey that 
alter  abundance,  biomass,  or  productivity  of  a  population, 
community, or trophic level across more than one link in the 
food web ( fig. 18.12 ). Because predators’ influence on eco-
system properties, such as primary production, occur through 
their effects on intermediary species, trophic cascades involve 
indirect interactions (see p. 376).   

 Carpenter  and  Kitchell  (1993)  interpreted  the  trophic 
cascade  in  their  study  lakes  as  follows:  Piscivores,  such  as 
largemouth bass, feed on planktivorous fish and invertebrates. 
Because of their influence on planktivorous fish, largemouth 
bass indirectly affect populations of zooplankton. By reduc-
ing populations of planktivorous fish, largemouth bass reduce 
feeding  pressure  on  zooplankton  populations.  Large-bodied 
zooplankton,  the  preferred  prey  of  size-selective  planktivo-
rous  fish  (see  chapter  7),  soon  dominate  the  zooplankton 
community. A dense population of large zooplankton reduces 
phytoplankton  biomass  and  the  rate  of  primary  production. 
This  interpretation  of  the  trophic  cascade  is  consistent  with 
the negative correlation between zooplankton body size and 
primary  production  reported  by  Carpenter  and  his  research 
team. This hypothesis is summarized in  figure 18.13 .   

 Carpenter and Kitchell tested their trophic cascade model 
by manipulating the fish communities in two lakes and using 
a  third  lake  as  a  control.   Figure  18.14   shows  the  overall 
design of their experiment. Two of the lakes contained sub-
stantial populations of largemouth bass. A third lake had no 
bass, due to occasional winterkill, but contained an abundance 
of  planktivorous  minnows.  The  researchers  removed  90% 
of  the  largemouth  bass  from  one  experimental  lake  and  put 
them into the other. They simultaneously removed 90% of the 
planktivorous minnows from the second lake and introduced

 “cascading” indirect interactions. 

 The trophic cascade hypothesis, a result of 

them to the first. They left a reference lake unmanipulated as 
a control.   

 The  responses  of  the  study  lakes  to  the  experimen-
tal  manipulations  support  the  trophic  cascade  hypothesis 
(see   fig.  18.14 ).  Reducing  the  planktivorous  fish  population 
led to reduced rates of primary production. In the absence of 
planktivorous minnows, the predaceous invertebrate   Chaoborus  
became  more  numerous.   Chaoborus   fed  heavily  upon  the 
smaller  herbivorous  zooplankton,  and  the  herbivorous  zoo-
plankton assemblage shifted in dominance from small to large 
species.  In  the  presence  of  abundant,  large  herbivorous  zoo-
plankton, phytoplankton biomass and rate of primary produc-
tion declined. 

 Adding planktivorous minnows produced a complex eco-
logical response. Increasing the planktivorous fish population 
led to increased rates of primary production. However, though 
the researchers increased the population of planktivorous fish 
in  this  experimental  lake,  they  did  so  in  an  unintended  way. 
Despite the best efforts of the researchers, a few bass remained. 
So, by introducing a large number of minnows, they basically 
fed  the  remaining  bass. An  increased  food  supply  combined 
with  reduced  population  density  induced  a  strong  numeri-
cal  response  by  the  bass  population  (see   chapter  10).  The 
manipulation increased the reproductive rate of the remaining 
largemouth  bass  50-fold,  producing  an  abundance  of  young 
largemouth bass that feed voraciously on zooplankton. 

 The lake ecosystem responded to the increased biomass 
of  planktivorous  fish  (young  largemouth  bass)  as  predicted 
at  the  outset  of  the  experiment.  The  biomass  of  zooplank-
ton  decreased  sharply,  the  average  size  of  herbivorous 
 zooplankton decreased, and phytoplankton biomass and pri-
mary  production increased. 

The trophic cascade model 
predicts that manipulating 
piscivore biomass will lead to 
changes in biomass and 
production of planktivores, 
herbivores, and phytoplankton.

 The results of these whole lake experiments show that 
the trophic activities of a few species can have large effects 
on  primary  production.  Since  this  experiment,   consumers 
have been shown to influence primary production in many 
terrestrial ecosystems.   

  Grazing by Large Mammals and Primary 
Production on the Serengeti 
 The  Serengeti-Mara,  a  25,000  km 2   grassland  ecosystem  that 
straddles the border between Tanzania and Kenya, is one of the 
last ecosystems on earth where great numbers of large mammals 
still roam freely. Sam McNaughton (1985) reported estimated 
densities  of  the  major  grazers  in  the  Serengeti  that  included 
1.4  million  wildebeest,   Connochaetes  taurinus  albujubatus;  
600,000 Thomson’s gazelle,  Gazella thomsonii;  200,000 zebra, 
 Equus burchelli;  52,000 buffalo,  Syncerus  caffer;  60,000 topi, 
 Damaliscus  korrigum;   and  large  numbers  of  20  additional 
grazing  mammals.  McNaughton  estimated  that  these  grazers 
consume an average of 66% of the annual primary production 
on the Serengeti. In light of this estimate, the potential for con-
sumer influences on primary production seems very high. 

 Over  two  decades  of  research  on  the  Serengeti  ecosys-
tem in Tanzania led McNaughton to appreciate the complex 
interrelations of abiotic and biotic factors there. For instance, 
both soil fertility and rainfall stimulate plant production and 
the  distributions  of  grazing  mammals.  However,  grazing 
mammals  also  affect  water  balance,  soil  fertility,  and  plant 
production. 

 As  you  might  predict,  the  rate  of  primary  production 
on the Serengeti is positively correlated with the quantity of 
rainfall. However, McNaughton (1976) also found that graz-
ing can increase primary production. He fenced in some areas 
in  the  western  Serengeti  to  explore  the  influence  of  herbi-
vores  on  production. The  migrating  wildebeest  that  flooded 
into the study site grazed intensively for 4 days, consuming 
 approximately 85% of plant biomass. 

 During  the  month  after  the  wildebeest  left  the  study 
area,  biomass  within  the  enclosures  decreased,  whereas 
the  biomass  of  vegetation  outside  the  enclosures  increased 
( fig. 18.15 ). Grazing increases the growth rate of many grass 
species, a response to grazing called  compensatory growth.  
The  mechanisms  underlying  compensatory  growth  include 
lower rates of respiration due to lower plant biomass, reduced

 The compensatory growth observed by McNaughton was

ently,  light  grazing  is  insufficient  to  produce  compensatory 
growth  and  very  heavy  grazing  reduces  the  capacity  of  the

 Grazing intensity and primary production of 

have substantial influences on its rate of primary production. 
As McNaughton put it, “African ecosystems cannot be under-
stood  without  close  consideration  of  the  large  mammals. 
These  animals  interact  with  their  habitats  in  complex  and 
powerful patterns influencing ecosystems for long periods.”     

 What  McNaughton  and  his  colleagues  described  is 
essentially  the  bottom  portion  of  a  potential  trophic  cas-
cade  in  which  the  feeding  activities  of  herbivores  have  a 
major influence on primary production. The full trophic cas-
cade  would  include  the  10  species  of  major  carnivores  on 
the  Serengeti,  including  lions,  hyenas,  African  wild  dogs, 
leopards,  and   cheetahs.  Consistent  with  the  requirements 
for  a  trophic  cascade,  these  predators  appear  to  control  the 
numbers  of  small  and  medium-size  mammalian  herbivores 
(<150 kg) on the Serengeti (Sinclair, Mduma, and Brashares 
2003). When predators were removed from a portion of the 
Serengeti for 8 years, the populations of five species of her-
bivores,  for  which  there  were  data,  increased  several-fold. 
Populations  of  these  herbivores  decreased  in  density  once 
the predators returned to the area. Unfortunately, there is no 
information on how primary production may have responded 
during the period of increased herbivore densities.  We have 
already  considered another system that may qualify as a ter-
restrial  trophic   cascade,  involving  wolves,  elk,  and  ripar-
ian  willow  and  aspen  trees  (Ripple  and  Beschta  2004;  see 
p. 322).  However, the role of wolves in that system remains 
a focal point for debate and more time will be required to see 
how  primary  producers  ultimately  respond  to  the  return  of 
wolves to the Yellowstone landscape.

In section 18.4 we’ve reviewed how consumers can influ-
ence  rates  of  primary  production.  In  the  next  section,  we 
explore the connection between rates of primary production 
and consumer production.

  Concept 18.4 Review 

1.   In  their  initial  studies,  leading  to  the  trophic  cascade 
hypothesis, Stephen Carpenter and his colleagues (1991) 
found a negative correlation between zooplankton size 
and phytoplankton primary production. What does this 
mean (see Investigating the Evidence 7, p. 168)?  

2.   Since increased phytoplankton biomass decreases water 
clarity in lakes, how should increased fishing pressure 
on the bass population in a lake ecosystem, such as that 
pictured in  figure 18.12 , affect lake clarity?  

3.   Why  is  it  more  difficult  to  obtain  evidence  for  trophic 
cascades in terrestrial ecosystems such as the Serengeti, 
compared to the lakes studied by Carpenter and Kitchell?     

  18.5  Secondary Production 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 18.17  Define ecological efficiency, including ranges of 

ecological efficiencies in nature.

 18.18  Calculate secondary production from changes in 

mean density and consumer mass.

 18.19  Discuss the influence of enrichment of primary 
production on secondary production by primary 
 consumers and predators.

 18.20  Summarize how studies of consumer responses to enri-
chment support ratio-dependent predator-prey models.

Ecosystems  with  greater  primary  production  gener-
ally support higher levels of secondary production.   We 
began chapter 18 with a partial and highly qualitative energy 
budget for a forest: Sunlight shines down on the canopy of a 
forest—some is reflected, some is converted to heat energy, 
and some is absorbed by chlorophyll and fuels photosynthe-
sis. The energy budgets of ecosystems reveal that with each 
transfer or conversion of energy, some energy is lost. Some 
of the most ecologically significant of those energy losses take 
place as energy flows from one trophic level to another. While 
focusing on trophic levels can lead to better understanding of 
ecosystem  processes,  we  should  not  forget  that  trophic  level 
energy relations are an aggregate of processes occurring at the 
level  of  individual  organisms,  for  example,  as  an  herbivore 
feeds on a plant or a predator consumes its prey. As a model 
of energy relations of individuals, figure 18.17 summarizes the 
fate of energy consumed by carp studied in a laboratory set-
ting. As with any consumer, food ingested by a carp has sev-
eral fates. As food is digested, some of its constituents and the 
energy they bear are assimilated, while components of the food 
are egested as feces. Following assimilation, a small amount of 
energy is lost in the excretion of nitrogen waste products, while 
much more is lost in respiration as the individual carp meets 
its  own  energy  needs. The  remaining  food  and  the  energy  it 
contains goes into growth and reproduction. This remainder is 
secondary production at the level of the individual organism. 
Secondary production calculations at the population level must 
also incorporate mortality along with growth and reproduction.
One  of  the  very  first  ecologists  to  quantify  the  flux  of 

energy through ecosystems was Raymond Lindeman.

   Investigating the Evidence  18

 Comparing Two Populations with the  t -Test 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 18.21  Compare two populations statistically using a t-test.
 18.22  Given a value of t, degrees of freedom for a 

 particular t-test, and a table of critical t values, 
judge whether the means of some measurements 
made for two populations are different statistically.

 In  chapter  17,  we  used  confidence  intervals  to  compare  the 
biomasses of two populations of the diatom-feeding caddisfly, 
Neothremma alicia.  That comparison indicated that the popu-
lation living in a stream that had flooded recently had a lower 
biomass per unit area. Here, we will use the same samples of 
the  two  populations  to  test  for  significant  differences  using 
a    t  -test,    a method for statistical comparison of two samples. 
The   t -test  involves  calculating  the  statistic   t   and  comparing 
the value with a table of critical values of  t.  The hypothesis 
is  that  the  populations  from  which  the  samples  were  drawn 
have the same mean, and the alternative hypothesis is that the 
population means are different. If the calculated  t  statistic is 
less than  the critical value of  t,  the hypothesis that the popula-
tions are not different is accepted. If the calculated  t  statistic is 
greater than  the critical value of  t,  this hypothesis is rejected. 
 As  an  example,  let’s  use  the   t -test  to  compare  our  two 

samples of  N. alicia:

  A Trophic Dynamic View of Ecosystems 
 Raymond Lindeman (1942) received his Ph.D. from the Uni-
versity of Minnesota in 1941, where his studies of the ecology 
of Cedar Bog Lake led him to a view of ecosystems far ahead 
of  its  time.  Lindeman  went  from  Minnesota  to Yale  Univer-
sity, where his association with G. E. Hutchinson from 1941 
to 1942, led to the publication of a revolutionary paper with the 
provocative title, “The Trophic-Dynamic Aspect of Ecology.” 
In this paper, Lindeman articulated a view of ecosystems cen-
tered on flows of energy through ecosystems that remains influ-
ential to this day. Like Tansley before him, Lindeman pointed 
out the difficulty and artificiality of separating organisms from 

their environment and promoted an ecosystem view of nature. 
Lindeman concluded that the ecosystem concept is fundamen-
tal to the study of    trophic dynamics,    which he defined as the 
transfer of energy from one part of an ecosystem to another. 

 Lindeman suggested grouping organisms within an ecosys-
tem into trophic levels: primary producers, primary consumers, 
secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, and so forth. In this 
scheme, each trophic level feeds on the one immediately below 
it.  Energy  enters  the  ecosystem  as  primary  producers  engage 
in photosynthesis using solar energy to convert CO 2  into bio-
mass. Energy is transferred from one level to the next through 
 consumption,  only  a  portion  of  which  is  assimilated  (some  is

t 5 3.480    

At this point in our  t -test, we need to compare the calculated 
 t  with the appropriate critical value. Again, we need to know 
two  factors:  the  desired  level  of  significance,  which  will  be 
P < 0.05, and the degrees of freedom. In this case we use the 
pooled degrees of freedom:

DFpooled 5 DFf 1 DFu 5 8 1 8 5 16    

The critical value of Student’s  t  for P < 0.05 and  DF   5  16, 
is 2.12. Since our calculated value of  t,  3.480, is greater than 
this critical value, the probability that the population means are 
the same is  less than  0.05. Therefore, we reject the hypothesis 
that the mean biomass of  N. alicia  per unit area is the same in 
the two streams and accept the alternative hypothesis that the 
mean biomass of this caddisfly differs in the two streams. 

   C  RITIQUING THE   E  VIDENCE 18  
     1.  How would the outcome of our statistical comparison of 
the two  Neothremma alicia  populations have been affected 
if  we  had  chosen  a  level  of  significance  of  P  <  0.01 
(see Appendix Table A.1)?     

defecated), and only a portion of that becomes  production (some 
is respired), which results an increase in consumer mass. The 
percentage of biomass produced at a lower trophic level that is 
transferred to biomass produced at the next higher trophic level 
is called     ecological efficiency,    which varies from about 5% to 
20%. As a result, the quantity of energy production decreases 
with each successive trophic level, which results in a pyramid-
shaped  distribution  of  energy  among  trophic  levels.  Linde-
man called these trophic pyramids “Eltonian pyramids,” since 
Charles Elton (1927) was the first to propose that the distribu-
tion of energy among trophic levels is shaped like a pyramid. 

  Figure 18.18  shows the distribution of annual production 
among trophic levels in Cedar Bog Lake and in Lake Mendota, 
Wisconsin. As  predicted  by  Elton,  the  distribution  of  energy 
production across trophic levels in both lakes is shaped like a 
pyramid. This shape results from energy losses between trophic 

levels.  Ecologists  have  proposed  that  these  energy  losses  are 
also a major contributor to limiting the number of trophic levels 
in ecosystems. For instance, Lake Mendota supports four tro-
phic levels, while Cedar Bog Lake includes only three.   

 Following Lindeman’s pioneering work, many other ecolo-
gists have studied energy flow.   Secondary production is key to 
understanding energy flow in ecosystems. A leader in the study 
of secondary production, Arthur C. Benke of the  University of 
Alabama,  has  focused  particularly  on  the  potential  of  second-
ary production studies to reveal otherwise hidden details of eco-
system, community, and population processes (e.g., Benke and 
Huryn 2010; Benke 2011). He has also been active in connecting 
research ecologists and students to the methods of secondary pro-
duction to facilitate work on this aspect of ecosystem function. 
In one of his contributions, Benke outlined a straightfor-
ward approach to estimating secondary production: following 

408 

Section V 

  Communities and Ecosystems

a cohort, or age group, of individuals over time, beginning with 
birth  or  hatching  (Waters  1977;  Benke  2010).  Figure  18.19 
gives a snapshot from one of Benke’s own cohort production 
studies in which he estimated secondary production of a com-
munity  of  dragonfly  larvae  living  in  a  South  Carolina  pond 
(Benke 1976). The data plotted in figure 18.19 are for dragon-
flies of the genus Epitheca, which occurred in the study pond 
as two indistinguishable species. Benke sampled these dragon-
fly  larvae  12  times  over  a  10-month  period  from  just  after 
hatching at the end of May to just before their emerging from 
the  pond  as  aerial  adults  at  the  end  of  March  the  following 
year. Notice that the density of Epitheca larvae declines over 
the  sampling  period,  as  their  average  mass  increases.  This 
typical  pattern  is  the  result  of  the  combined  effects  of  larval 
mortality and growth of survivors over time. As demonstrated in 
figure  18.19,  estimates  of  changes  in  population  density 
and  average  mass  provide  a  basis  for  calculating  secondary 

production between sampling periods. As shown, Benke’s sam-
pling  produced  an  estimate  of  secondary  production  between 
sampling periods 7 and 8 of 187.9 mg/m2. Adding up production 
calculations for all sampling intervals in figure 18.19 would give 
an estimate of total secondary production over the course of the 
study, which Benke calculated at 1,927.6 mg/m2/yr. Although 
biomass can easily be converted to energy equivalents, in this 
and many other studies, secondary production is expressed as 
biomass per unit area per unit time. This convention is followed 
in the studies reviewed in the next section.

  Primary and Secondary Production 

409

addressing these questions, let’s step back and consider that the 
relation  between  primary  and  secondary   production  does  not 
occur in the abstract but results from the rates at which consum-
ers feed on their food resources. These are precisely the interac-
tions represented by alternative models reviewed in  chapter 14, 
where we compared the accuracy of functional response predic-
tions  made  by  prey-dependent  versus  ratio-dependent  models 
of  predator-prey  interactions  (see  p.  312).  These  two  classes 
of  predator-prey  models  also  make  contrasting  predictions  of 
how  increased  primary  production,  commonly  referred  to  as 
“enrichment”,  will  affect  abundance  (biomass  or  numbers) 
of  consumers  (Arditi  and  Ginzburg  1989).  In  an  ecosystem 
with  three  trophic  levels,  both  models  predict  a  proportional 
increase in abundance of predators occupying the top trophic 
level  (fig.  18.20).  In  contrast,  while  prey-dependent  models 
predict no change in primary consumer abundance in response 
to enrichment, the ratio-dependent model predicts that primary 
consumer  abundance  will  increase  proportionally  to  the  level 
of enrichment. In fact, the ratio-dependent model predicts pro-
portional  increases  in  abundance  of  consumers  at  all  trophic 
levels  in  response  to  enrichment  regardless  of  the  number  of 
trophic  levels  in  the  ecosystem.  In  contrast,  prey-dependent 
models  predict  that  an  increase  in  abundance  proportional  to 
degree of enrichment will occur only at the top trophic level. 
For example, in the ecosystem with three trophic levels shown 
in figure 18.20, the prey-dependent models assume that feed-
ing by top predators prevents an increase in primary consumer 
abundance. According to prey-dependent models, abundance at 
lower trophic levels may show nonlinear increases, decreases, 
or remain unchanged with enrichment. However, experimental 
and observational studies show clearly that increased primary 
production is associated with greater abundance of consumers 
at all trophic levels, providing strong and growing support for 
the predictions of ratio-dependent predator-prey models (e.g., 
Bishop et al. 2006; Hanson and Peters 1984).

How  does  enrichment  affect  secondary  production? 
There  is  clear  evidence  that  increased  primary  production

fosters  greater  secondary  production  in  terrestrial,  and 
aquatic ecosystems (e.g., McNaughton et al. 1989; Ware and 
Thomson  2005  et  al.). As  a  sample  from  an  extensive  lit-
erature, figure 18.21 shows the positive correlation between 
annual precipitation and herbivore secondary production in 
African savanna ecosystems (Coe, Cumming, and  Phillipson 
1976).  Because  primary  production  in  these  savannas  is 
tightly  coupled  with  rainfall  (Chamaille-Jammes,  Fritz, 
and  Murindagomo  2014;  Zhu  and  Southworth  2013),  the 
authors of this study could use annual precipitation in place 
of direct measurements of savanna primary production. 

How does increased primary production affect production 
at levels above primary consumers? Figure 18.22 shows how 
availability of leaf litter in a detritus-based stream ecosystem 
influenced secondary production (Wallace et al. 1999). As on 
African savannas, secondary production by primary consum-
ers, in this case, production of detritivores, rose with increased 
availability of food. In addition, there was a positive correla-
tion between primary consumer production and predator pro-
duction in this stream ecosystem. As Benke and Huryn (2010) 
suggested, the results of this study, and the many other studies 
of secondary production , have helped link ecosystem ecology 
to population and community ecology. In the Applications sec-
tion, we review an invaluable tool to verifying the feeding hab-
its of organisms, which are fundamental to energy flow studies. 

Concept 18.5 Review

  1.  How can energy losses between trophic levels limit the 

number of trophic levels in an ecosystem?

  2.  Is  it  possible  for  two  consumer  populations  to  have 

equal biomass but differ in secondary production?

  3.  Would  secondary  production  in  a  stream  ecosystem 
dependent on inputs of detritus from a surround  forest 
change,  if  detrital  inputs  to  the  stream,  for  example 
leaves falling from nearby trees, were reduced? How so?

 Using Stable Isotope Analysis to Study 

Feeding Habits 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
 18.23  Outline how stable isotope analysis can be used to 
determine the trophic level occupied by consumer 
organisms in an ecosystem.

 18.24  Discuss how stable isotope analysis is revealing 
information about the trophic ecology of species 
that would be hidden to traditional sources of 
 information on diets, such as stomach analysis.

 One of the fundamental steps in studying trophic relations in 
ecosystems  is  to  determine  what  organisms  eat.  While  this 
task may sound easy, for many organisms, it is not. If food 
items are easily identified and feeding habits are well studied 

and  do  not  change  significantly  over  time  or  from  place  to 
place, you may accurately identify feeding habits. However, 
if feeding habits are variable or if food items are difficult to 
identify, it may be difficult to assign organisms accurately to a 
particular trophic position in the ecosystem. One of the most 
useful  tools  for  making  such  assignments  is  stable  isotope 
analysis (see chapter 6, p. 145). 

  Using Stable Isotopes to Identify Sources 
of Energy in a Salt Marsh 
 The main energy source in a salt marsh in eastern North Amer-
ica is primary production by the salt marsh grass  Spartina alter-
niflora,  most of which is consumed as detritus. The detritus of 
 S. alterniflora  is carried into tidal creeks at high tide, where it is 
consumed by a variety of organisms, including crabs, oysters, 
and mussels. However,  S. alterniflora  is not the only potential 
source of food for these organisms. The waters of the salt marsh 
also contain organic matter from upland plants and carry phyto-
plankton. How much might these other food sources contribute 
to energy flow through the salt marsh ecosystem? 

 Bruce Peterson, Robert Howarth, and Robert Garritt (1985) 
used stable isotopes to determine the relative contributions of 
 S.  alterniflora,   phytoplankton,  and  upland  plants  to  the  nutri-
tion of the ribbed mussel,  Geukensia demissa,  a dominant filter- 
feeding species in the New England salt marsh they studied. The 
researchers pointed out that determining the trophic structure of 
salt marshes is difficult because detritus from different sources 
is difficult to identify visually, because there are several poten-
tial sources of detritus, and because organisms may frequently 
change their feeding habits.  

 To  overcome  these  difficulties,  Peterson  and  his  col-
leagues  used  the  ratios  of  stable  isotopes  of  carbon,  nitro-
gen, and sulfur. They used the stable isotopes of these three 
elements because their ratios are different in phytoplankton, 
upland  C 3   plants  (see  chapter  7),  and   S.  alterniflora,   a  C 4  
grass ( fig. 18.23 ). Upland plants, with a    d13C 5 228.6  0/00 ,

 Variation in isotopic composition of ribbed mussels,  Geukensia demissa,  by distance inland in a New England salt marsh (data from 

are  the  most  depleted  of   13 C,  whereas   S.  alterniflora,  
with  a  d13C  5  213.1  0/00,    is  the  least  depleted.  Stable  iso-
topes  of  sulfur  and  nitrogen  are  also  distributed  differ-
ently  among  these  potential  energy  sources.  For  instance, 
 S.  alterniflora,   with  a  d34S  5  22.4     0/00,   has  the  lowest 
relative  concentration  of   34 S,  whereas  plankton,  with  a 
   d34S 5 118.8 0/00,  have the highest concentration of  34 S.   

 Using  these  differences  in  isotopic  concentrations,  the 
researchers were able to identify the relative contributions of 
potential food sources to the diet of the mussel ( fig. 18.24 ). 
Their  analyses  showed  that   Geukensia   gets  most  of  its 
energy from plankton and  S. alterniflora  but that the relative 

contributions of these two food sources depends upon loca-
tion. In the interior of the marsh, the mussel feeds mainly on 
 S.  alterniflora,   but  near  the  mouth  of  the  marsh,  it  depends 
mainly on plankton. This is an example of how analyses of 
stable isotopes can provide us with a window to the otherwise 
hidden biology of species.    

 Stable  isotope  analyses  continue  to  improve  our  under-
standing  of  energy  flow  through  ecosystems.  While  energy 
flows  through  ecosystems  in  a  one-way  path,  the  elements, 
or nutrients, upon which organisms depend are recycled and 
may be used over and over again. The cycling of these nutri-
ents is the subject of chapter 19.    

  Summary 

 We can view a forest, a stream, or an ocean as a system that 
absorbs, transforms, and stores energy. In this view, physical, 
chemical, and biological structures and processes are insepa-
rable. When we look at natural systems in this way, we view 
them as ecosystems. An  ecosystem  is a biological community 
plus all of the abiotic factors influencing that community. 

  Primary  production,   the  production  of  new  biomass  by 
autotrophs, is one of the most important ecosystem processes. 
The rate of primary production is the amount of biomass pro-
duced over some interval of time. Gross primary production is 
the total amount of biomass produced by all the autotrophs in 
the ecosystem. Net primary production is the amount of  biomass 
left over after autotrophs have met their own energetic needs. 

  Terrestrial  primary  production  is  generally  limited 
by  temperature,  moisture,  and  nutrients.   The  variables 
most  highly  correlated  with  variation  in  terrestrial  primary 
production are temperature and moisture. Highest rates of ter-
restrial primary production occur under warm, moist condi-
tions. Temperature and moisture conditions can be combined 
in a single measure called annual actual evapotranspiration, 
or AET,  which  is  the  total  amount  of  water  that  evaporates 
and  transpires  off  a  landscape  during  the  course  of  a  year. 
Annual AET is positively correlated with net primary produc-
tion in terrestrial ecosystems. However, significant variation 
in  terrestrial  primary  production  results  from  differences  in 
soil fertility. 

412 

Section V 

  Communities and Ecosystems

  Aquatic  primary  production  is  generally  limited  by 
nutrient availability.   One of the best documented patterns 
in the biosphere is the positive relationship between nutrient 
availability and rate of primary production in aquatic ecosys-
tems. Phosphorus concentration usually limits rates of primary 
production in freshwater ecosystems, while nitrogen concen-
tration usually limits rates of marine primary production. 

Primary  producer  diversity  contributes  to  higher 
primary  production.  Experimental  field  studies  indicate 
strong  influences  of  plant  diversity  and  plant  functional 
group composition on primary production. Primary producer 
diversity has also been shown to increase primary production 
in  experimental  aquatic  ecosystems.  The  results  of  experi-
mental  studies  of  the  influence  of  biodiversity  on  primary 
production are supported by patterns of variation in nature.

  Consumers  can  influence  rates  of  primary  produc-
tion in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through trophic 
cascades.   Piscivorous  fish  can  indirectly  reduce  rates 
of  primary  production  in  lakes  by  reducing  the  density  of 
 plankton-feeding  fish,  an  effect  called  a  trophic  cascade. 
Reduced density of planktivorous fish can lead to increased 
density  of  herbivorous  zooplankton,  which  can  reduce  the 
densities  of  phytoplankton  and  rates  of  primary  production. 
Intense grazing by large mammalian herbivores on the Seren-
geti  increases  annual  net  primary  production  by  inducing 
compensatory growth in grasses. 

  Ecosystems  with  greater  primary  production 
 generally support higher levels of secondary production.  
Ecosystem  ecologists  have  simplified  the  trophic  structure 
of ecosystems by arranging species into trophic levels based 
upon the predominant source of their nutrition. A trophic level 
is determined by the number of transfers of energy from pri-
mary  producers  to  that  level. As  energy  is  transferred  from 
one  trophic  level  to  another,  energy  is  lost  due  to  limited 
assimilation, respiration by consumers, and heat production. 
As a result of these losses, the quantity of energy in an eco-
system decreases with each successive trophic level, forming 
a pyramid-shaped distribution of energy among trophic lev-
els. Estimates of changes in population density and average 
mass  of  consumers  provide  a  basis  for  calculating  second-
ary  production  between  sampling  periods. A  positive  corre-
lation  between  primary  and  secondary  production  has  been 
demonstrated in terrestrial, freshwater, estuarine, and marine 
ecosystems.  Patterns  of  consumer  abundance  in  response  to 
enrichment are consistent with predictions of ratio-dependent 
models of predator-prey interactions. 

Stable  isotope  analysis  can  be  used  to  trace  the  flow 
of energy through ecosystems. The ratios of different stable 
isotopes of important elements such as nitrogen and carbon 
are generally different in different parts of ecosystems. As a 
consequence,  ecologists  can  use  isotopic  ratios  to  study  the 
trophic structure and energy flow through ecosystems.

  Review Questions 

     1.  Population, community, and ecosystem ecologists study struc-
ture and process. However, they focus on different natural char-
acteristics.  Contrast  the  important  structures  and  processes  in 
a  forest  from  the  perspectives  of  population,  community,  and 
ecosystem ecologists.  

    2.  M. Huston (1994b) pointed out that the well-documented pattern 
of increasing annual primary production from the poles to the 
equator is strongly influenced by the longer growing season at 
low latitudes. The following data are from table 14.10 in Huston. 
The data cited by Huston are from Whittaker and Likens (1975).

   Complete the missing data to compare the  monthly  production 
of boreal, temperate, and tropical forests. How does this short-
term perspective of primary production in high-, middle-, and 
low-latitude  forests  compare  to  an  annual  perspective?  How 
does the short-term perspective change our perception of tropi-
cal versus high-latitude forests?  

    3.  Many  migratory  birds  spend  approximately  half  the  year  in 
temperate  forests  during  the  warm  breeding  season  and  the 
other half of the year in tropical forest. Given the analyses you 
made in question 2, which forest appears to be more productive 
from the perspective of these migratory birds?  

    4.  Field  experiments  demonstrate  that  variation  in  soil  fertility 
influences  terrestrial  primary  production.  However,  we  can-
not  say  that  nutrients  exert  primary  control.  That  role  is  still 
attributed  to  temperature  and  moisture.  Why  do  ecologists 
still  attribute  the  main  control  of  terrestrial  primary  produc-
tion  to  temperature  and  moisture?  Consider  the  difference  in 
primary  production  between  arctic  tundra  and  tropical  forest 

 

Chapter 18 

  Primary and Secondary Production

(see  fig. 18.2 ) and the extent to which nutrient additions (Shaver 
and Chapin 1986) changed primary production in tundra.  

    5.  Shaver  and  Chapin  (1986)  pointed  out  that  though  the  tundra 
ecosystems they studied consistently increased primary produc-
tion in response to fertilization, individual species and growth 
forms  showed  more  variation  in  response.  Some  species  and 
growth  forms  showed  no  response,  while  others  decreased 
production  on  the  fertilized  plots.  What  do  these  differences 
in  response  say  about  using  the  responses  of  individual  spe-
cies to predict responses at the ecosystem level? What about the 
reverse—can we predict the responses of individual species or 
growth forms from ecosystem-level responses?  

    6.  Compare the pictures of trophic structure that emerged from 
our  discussions  of  food  webs  in  chapter  17  with  those  in 
chapter 18. What are the strengths of each perspective? What 
are their limitations?  

    7.  Suppose you are studying a community of small mammals that 
live on the boundary between a riverside forest and a semidesert 
grassland.  One  of  your  concerns  is  to  discover  the  relative 
contributions of the grassland and the forest to the nutrition of 
small mammals living between the two ecosystems. Design a 
research program to find out. (Hint: The grassland is dominated 
by C 4  grasses and the forest by C 3  plants.)  

    8.  Most of the energy that flows through a forest ecosystem flows 
through  detritus-based  food  chains,  and  the  detritus  consists 
mainly of dead plant tissues (e.g., leaves and wood). In contrast, 
most of the energy flowing through a pelagic marine or freshwater 
ecosystem flows through grazing food chains with phytoplankton 
constituting the major primary producers. Ecologists have deter-
mined that on average, a calorie or joule of energy takes only sev-
eral days to pass through the pelagic ecosystem but a quarter of a 
century to pass through the forest ecosystem. Explain.  

    9.  In chapter 17, we examined the influences of keystone species on 
the structure of communities. In chapter 18, we reviewed trophic 
cascades. Discuss the similarities and differences between these two 
concepts.  Compare  the  measurements  and  methods  of  ecologists 
studying keystone species versus those studying trophic cascades.  
   10.  The  studies  of  nutrient  limitation  of  aquatic  primary  produc-
tion that we reviewed focused almost entirely on lakes within 
the  temperate  zone.  Suppose  you  are  an  ecologist  interested 
in determining whether primary production in tropical lakes is 
subject to similar control by nutrient availability. Design a study 
to find out what controls rates of primary production in tropi-
cal lakes. Use all the sources of information at your disposal, 
including published research, surveys of natural variation, and 
large- and small-scale experiments.

 19.2  Summarize the ecological significance of nutrient 

cycling studies.

  E xchange of nutrients between organisms and their envi-

ronment  is  one  of  the  essential  aspects  of  ecosystem 
function. A diatom living in the surface waters of a lake 
absorbs an ion of phosphate from the surrounding water. It incor-
porates the phosphate into some of its DNA as it replicates its 
chromosomes during cell division. A few hours later, one of the 
diatom’s daughter cells is eaten by a cladoceran, an algae-feeding 
member  of  the  zooplankton.  The  cladoceran  incorporates  the

phosphate into a molecule of ATP. The cladoceran lives 2 days 
more  and  then  is  eaten  by  a  planktivorous  minnow.  Within 
the minnow, the phosphate is combined with a lipid to form a 
phospholipid molecule in the cell membrane of one of the min-
now’s neural cells. A few weeks later, the minnow is eaten by a 
northern pike and the phosphate is incorporated into part of the 
pike’s skeleton. During the following winter, the pike dies and its 
tissues are attacked by bacteria and fungi that gradually decom-
pose the pike, including its skeleton. During decomposition, the 
phosphate is dissolved in the surrounding water. The following 
spring the very same ion of phosphate is taken up by another dia-
tom, completing its cycle through the lake ecosystem ( fig. 19.1 ).     
 In chapter 18, we saw that energy makes a one-way trip 
through ecosystems. In contrast, elements such as phosphorus 
(P), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and iron (Fe) are 
used over and over. Elements that are required for the devel-
opment,  maintenance,  and  reproduction  of  organisms  are 
called   nutrients.   Ecologists  refer  to  the  use,  transformation, 
movement, and reuse of nutrients in ecosystems as     nutrient 
cycling    .  Because of the physiological importance of nutrients, 
their relative scarcity, and their influence on rates of primary 
production, nutrient cycling is one of the most significant eco-
system processes studied by ecologists. 

 Our understanding of nutrient cycles has developed under 
the guidance of ecosystem ecologists motivated by a passion 
for the movement of elements through the biosphere and who 
often  worked  in  obscurity.  For  many  of  these  scientists,  few 
things are more stimulating than spending long hours debat-
ing  about  the  main  factors  controlling  the  rate  of  mass  loss 

by  decomposing  logs,  or  how  microbial  uptake  might  affect 
the availability of nitrogen by plants growing under different 
climatic regimes. However, a passion for nutrient cycles is no 
longer limited to academic circles but now energizes people of 
all walks of life from around the world. This shift in interest 
is driven mainly by the looming consequences of our having 
dramatically altered some key nutrient cycles. The best known 
of these human-driven changes is the current imbalance in the 
carbon cycle that has resulted in a buildup of carbon dioxide 
in  earth’s  atmosphere,  accompanied  by  global  warming  (see 
chapter 23). However, other critical cycles are also out of bal-
ance  and  most  scientists  now  agree  that  the  fate  of  the  bio-
sphere, from the health of coral reefs to the state of the global 
economy, quite literally hangs on how well we understand and 
manage  nutrient  cycles,  especially  the  carbon  cycle.  Three 
nutrient cycles play especially prominent roles: the  phospho-
rus cycle,  the  nitrogen cycle,  and the  carbon cycle.  In the next 
few pages we review the major features of each of these cycles.

   Nutrient cycles involve the storage of chemical elements in 
nutrient pools, or compartments, and the flux, or transfer, 
of nutrients between pools.   While there are details that are 
unique to each nutrient cycle, there are some features that are 
common to all. One of those common features is that nutrients 
are stored in nutrient pools. A     nutrient pool    is the amount of a 
particular nutrient stored in a portion, or compartment, of an eco-
system. In addition, all nutrient cycles are, as the name implies, 
dynamic, with     nutrient flux    moving nutrients between the pools 
of an ecosystem. A major interest of ecologists studying nutrient 
cycling is to understand the factors controlling the distribution 
of nutrients among pools and the rates of nutrient flux among 
them. Theoretically, in a closed ecosystem, nutrients would cycle 
round and round as suggested by the phosphorus cycling shown 
in  figure 19.1 . However, ecosystems are not closed and nutrients 
may be lost from the ecosystem to a nutrient sink. A      nutrient 
sink     is  a  part  of  the  biosphere  where  a  particular  nutrient  is 
absorbed faster than it is released. For example, the phosphorus 
in the hypothetical lake in  figure 19.1  could be lost to bottom 
sediments as an insoluble precipitate. Ecosystems may also gain 
nutrients from nutrient sources. A     nutrient source    is a portion of 
the biosphere where a particular nutrient is released faster than it 
is absorbed. For example, burning of fossil fuels acts as a source 
of carbon dioxide to the global ecosystem. We begin our discus-
sion of the details of nutrient cycles with the phosphorus cycle.  

   The Phosphorus Cycle 
 Phosphorus is essential to the energetics, genetics, and struc-
ture of living systems. For instance, phosphorus forms part 
of the ATP, RNA, DNA, and phospholipid molecules. While 
of great biological importance, phosphorus is not very abun-
dant in the biosphere. Consequently, phosphorus cycling has 
received a great deal of attention from ecosystem ecologists. 
 In  contrast  to  carbon  and  nitrogen,  the  global  phospho-
rus  cycle  does  not  include  a  substantial  atmospheric  pool 
( fig.  19.2 ).  The  largest  quantities  of  phosphorus  occur  in 
mineral  deposits  and  marine  sediments.  Sedimentary  rocks 
that are especially rich in phosphorus are mined for fertilizer 
and applied to agricultural soils. Soil may contain substantial 
quantities of phosphorus. However, much of the phosphorus in 
soils occurs in chemical forms not directly available to plants.   
 Phosphorus  is  slowly  released  to  terrestrial  and  aquatic 
ecosystems through the weathering of rocks. As phosphorus 
is released from mineral deposits, it is absorbed by plants and 
recycled  within  ecosystems.  Mycorrhizae  generally  play  a 
key role in the uptake of phosphorus by plants in terrestrial 
ecosystems. However, much phosphorus is washed into rivers 
and eventually finds its way to the oceans, where it will remain 
in dissolved form until eventually finding its way to the ocean 
sediments.  Ocean  sediments  will  be  eventually  transformed 

 

Chapter 19 

  Nutrient Cycling and Retention 

417

into  phosphate-bearing  sedimentary  rocks  that  through  geo-
logical uplift can form new land. William Schlesinger (1991) 
points out that the phosphorus released by the weathering of 
sedimentary rocks has made at least one passage through the 
global phosphorus cycle.  

  The Nitrogen Cycle 
 Nitrogen  is  important  to  the  structure  and  functioning  of 
organisms. It forms part of key biomolecules such as amino 
acids,  nucleic  acids,  and  the  porphyrin  rings  of  chlorophyll 
and hemoglobin. In addition, as we saw in chapter 18, nitro-
gen supplies may limit rates of primary production in marine 
and  terrestrial  environments.  Because  of  its  importance  and 
relative scarcity, nitrogen has drawn a great deal of attention 
from ecosystem ecologists. 

 Like the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle also includes a 
major atmospheric pool in the form of molecular nitrogen, N 2  
( fig. 19.3 ). However, few organisms can use this atmospheric 
supply of molecular nitrogen directly. These organisms, called 
nitrogen  fixers,  include  (1)  the  cyanobacteria,  or  blue-green 
algae, of freshwater, marine, and soil environments, (2) cer-
tain free-living soil bacteria, (3) bacteria associated with the 
roots  of  leguminous  plants,  and  (4)  actinomycetes  bacteria, 

associated with the roots of alders,  Alnus,  and several other 
species of woody plants.   

 Because of the strong triple bonds between the two nitro-
gen atoms in the N 2  molecule, nitrogen fixation is an energy- 
demanding process. During nitrogen fixation, N 2  is reduced 
to  ammonia,  NH 3 .  Nitrogen  fixation  takes  place  under 
anaerobic conditions in terrestrial and aquatic environments, 
where  nitrogen-fixing  species  oxidize  sugars  to  obtain  the 
required  energy.  Nitrogen  fixation  also  occurs  as  a  physical 
process associated with the high pressures and energy gener-
ated by lightning. Ecologists propose that all of the nitrogen 
cycling  within  ecosystems  ultimately  entered  these  cycles 
through nitrogen fixation by organisms or lightning. There is 
a relatively large pool of nitrogen cycled in the biosphere but 
only a small entryway through nitrogen fixation. 

 Humans  have  overcome  this  limitation  and  increased 
agricultural  production  globally  by  rotating  crops  capable 
of nitrogen fixation and through the industrial fixation of N2 
to  produce  ammonium  (NH4)  fertilizer.  These  processes,  in 
addition to sources of nitrogen resulting from combustion of 
fossil fuels, have more than doubled the amount of nitrogen 
entering the biosphere (see chapter 23, p. 515). 

 Once  nitrogen  is  fixed  by  nitrogen-fixing  organisms,  it 
becomes  available  to  other  organisms  within  an  ecosystem. 

Annual N fixation by 
lightning is small 
compared to biological 
fixation.

Section V 

  Communities and Ecosystems

Upon the death of an organism, the nitrogen in its tissues can 
be released by fungi and bacteria involved in the decompo-
sition  process.  These  fungi  and  bacteria  release  nitrogen  as 
ammonium, NH 4   1  , a process called ammonification. Ammo-
nium can be converted to nitrate, NO 3   2  , by other bacteria in 
a process called nitrification. Ammonium and nitrate can be 
used  directly  by  bacteria,  fungi,  or  plants.  The  nitrogen  in 
dead  organic  matter  can  also  be  used  directly  by  mycorrhi-
zal fungi, which can be passed on to plants. The nitrogen in 
 bacterial, fungal, and plant biomass may pass on to popula-
tions of animal consumers or back to the pool of dead organic 
matter, where it will be recycled again. 

 Nitrogen may exit the organic matter pool of an ecosystem 
through  denitrification.  Denitrification  is  an  energy-yielding 
process that occurs under anaerobic conditions and converts 
nitrate to molecular nitrogen, N 2 . The molecular nitrogen pro-
duced by denitrifying bacteria moves into the atmosphere and 
can only reenter the organic matter pool through nitrogen fixa-
tion. Ecologists estimate that the mean residence time of fixed 
nitrogen  in  the  biosphere  is  about  625  years. They  estimate 
that the mean residence time of phosphorus in the biosphere is 
on the order of thousands of years.  

  The Carbon Cycle 
 Carbon is an essential part of all organic molecules, and, car-
bon compounds such as carbon dioxide, CO 2 , and methane, 

CH 4 ,  as  constituents  of  the  atmosphere,  substantially  influ-
ence  global  climate.  This  connection  between  atmospheric 
carbon  and  climate  has  drawn  all  nations  of  the  planet  into 
discussions of the ecology of carbon cycling. 

 Carbon moves between organisms and the atmosphere as 
a consequence of two reciprocal biological processes: photo-
synthesis and respiration ( fig. 19.4 ). Photosynthesis removes 
CO 2   from  the  atmosphere,  whereas  respiration  by  primary 
producers  and  consumers,  including  decomposers,  returns 
carbon to the atmosphere in the form of CO 2 . In aquatic eco-
systems, CO 2  must first dissolve in water before being used 
by aquatic primary producers. Once dissolved in water, CO 2  
enters a chemical equilibrium with bicarbonate, HCO 3   2  , and 
2  . Carbonate may precipitate out of solution 
carbonate, CO 3   
as calcium carbonate and may be buried in ocean sediments.     
 While  some  carbon  cycles  rapidly  between  organisms 
and  the  atmosphere,  some  remains  sequestered  in  relatively 
unavailable forms for long periods of time. Carbon in soils, 
peat, fossil fuels, and carbonate rock would generally take a 
long time to return to the atmosphere. During modern times, 
however,  fossil  fuels  have  become  a  major  source  of  atmo-
spheric CO 2  as humans have tapped into fossil fuel supplies to 
provide energy for their economic systems. 

 The massive burning of fossil fuels, beginning with the 
industrial  revolution,  has  increased  concentrations  of  atmo-
spheric CO 2  (see chapter 23). However, the rate of buildup has 
been significantly slower than scientists would predict given 

Carbon coming from destruction of 
vegetation is approximately 40% of 
fossil fuel burning.

the rate of emissions to the atmosphere by fossil fuel burn-
ing minus known carbon sinks. As indicated in  figure 19.4 , 
the oceans are a known carbon sink, since the amount of car-
bon they absorb annually exceeds their emissions by 20 15  g. 
Ecologists  have  assumed  that  the  missing  carbon  sink  was 
terrestrial, but where? The best current estimates are that the 
missing carbon sink is formed by a combination of northern 
and  tropical  forests  (Stephens  et  al.  2007).  However,  much 
more  research  needs  to  be  done  to  verify  that  these  forests 
are the missing sinks, to estimate the relative rates of carbon 
uptake by the two forest types, and to understand how to sus-
tain this critical uptake of atmospheric CO 2 . 

 Ecosystem  ecologists  study  the  factors  controlling  the 
movement,  storage,  and  conservation  of  nutrients  within 
ecosystems. You can see broad outlines of these processes in 
 figures  19.2 ,   19.3 ,  and   19.4 .  However,  much  remains  to  be 
learned, especially concerning the factors controlling rates of 
nutrient  exchange  within  and  between  ecosystems.  Nutrient 
exchange is substantially affected by the process of decompo-
sition, which is the subject of the next section. 

  Concept 19.1 Review 

      1.   Do the oceans act as a source or a sink for phosphorus 

(refer to  fig. 19.2 )?

tion  and  denitrification  on  land  and  in  the  oceans 
(see  fig. 19.3 )?  

     3.   What are two ways in which the cutting of tropical for-
ests and replacing them with lower productivity cattle 
pastures affect the global carbon balance?       

  19.2  Rates of Decomposition 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 19.6  Describe the processes of mineralization and 

decomposition.

 19.7  Explain the importance of decomposition to nutrient 

cycling.

 19.8  Outline the main factors controlling rates of decom-

position in terrestrial ecosystems.

 19.9  Compare the controls on decomposition rates in 

terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

   Decomposition  rate  is  influenced  by  temperature,  mois-
ture,  and  chemical  composition  of  litter  and  the  envi-
ronment.   The  rate  at  which  nutrients,  such  as  nitrogen 
and  phosphorus,  are  made  available  to  the  primary  pro-
ducers  is  determined  largely  by  the  rate  at  which  nutrient 
supplies  are  converted  from  organic  to  inorganic  forms. 
This  conversion  from  organic  to  inorganic  form  is  called 
     mineralization    .   Mineralization  takes  place  principally  dur-
ing      decomposition    ,  which is the breakdown of organic matter 
accompanied by the release of carbon dioxide. Consequently, 

ecosystem ecologists consider decomposition as a key eco-
system process. 

 Decomposition of organic matter involves chemical and 
physical processes such as leaching and fragmentation of lit-
ter, and biological processes dominated by fungi and bacteria. 
The fine hyphae of fungi can penetrate litter and release exter-
nal digestive enzymes that speed decomposition. Fragmenta-
tion and ingestion of litter by invertebrates also plays a key 
role during decomposition processes. 

 The rate of decomposition in ecosystems is significantly 
influenced by temperature, moisture, and the chemical com-
position of both plant litter and the environment. The chemi-
cal characteristics of plant litter that influence decomposition 
rates  include  nitrogen  concentration,  phosphorus  concentra-
tion,  carbon:nitrogen  ratio,  and  lignin  content.  Ecologists 
have studied how several of these variables affect rates of leaf 
decomposition in Mediterranean ecosystems.  

   Decomposition in Two Mediterranean 
Woodland Ecosystems 
 Antonio Gallardo and José Merino (1993) studied how chemi-
cal  and  physical  factors  affect  rates  of  decomposition  of  leaf 
litter in two Mediterranean woodland ecosystems. Their study 
sites were located at Doñana Biological Reserve and Monte La 
Sauceda in southwestern Spain. The mean annual temperature 
at the two sites differs by only 0.5 8 C: 16.7 8 C at Doñana ver-
sus 16.2 8 C at Monte La Sauceda. Both study sites experience 
Mediterranean  climates  with  wet  winters  and  dry  summers 
(see  fig.  2.22).  However,  they  differ  significantly  in  average 
annual rainfall. Doñana Biological Reserve is located at 20 m 
elevation and receives about 500 mm of rain annually, whereas 
Monte La Sauceda is located at 432 m elevation and receives 
about 1,600 mm of rain annually. These two sites were ideally 
suited to study the effects of moisture on rates of decomposition. 
 Gallardo  and  Merino  also  explored  the  effects  of  litter 
chemistry  on  decomposition  by  including  leaves  from  nine 
species  of  native  trees  and  shrubs  that  differed  significantly 
in chemical composition. Chemical differences among leaves 
included  differences  in  concentrations  of  tannins,  lignin, 
nitrogen, and phosphorus. You may remember from  chapter 2 
(see fig. 2.23) that many of the native plants from areas with 
a  Mediterranean  climate  produce  tough  or  sclerophylous 
leaves.  Gallardo  and  Merino  also  explored  the  influence  of 
leaf toughness on decomposition rate. They estimated tough-
ness by measuring the amount of force required for a 1.2 mm 
diameter rod to penetrate the leaves of each species. 

 Approximately  2  g  of  air-dried  leaves  from  each  of  the 
study  species  was  put  into  several  nylon  mesh  “litter  bags” 
and  placed  at  the  Doñana  Biological  Reserve  and  at  Monte 
La Sauceda. The litter bags had a mesh size of 1 mm—small 
enough to reduce the loss of small leaves, yet large enough to 
permit aerobic microbial activity and entry of small soil inver-
tebrates. Every 2 months, Gallardo and Merino retrieved litter 
bags from each study site. They followed this routine for 2 years. 
 In the laboratory, the researchers measured the mass of 
leaf tissue remaining in each of 6 to 10 replicate litter bags

for each leaf species.  Figure 19.5  shows that the amount of 
leaf mass lost by ash leaves,  Fraxinus angustifolia,  was much 
higher at Monte La Sauceda. This higher decomposition rate 
probably reflects the higher precipitation at that site.   

 Though all types of leaves decomposed faster at Monte La 
Sauceda, differences in decomposition rates among leaf spe-
cies were similar at the two sites. For instance, the leaves of 
ash,  Fraxinus,  showed the greatest mass loss at both study sites, 
while  the  oak,   Quercus  lusitanica,   showed  the  lowest  mass 
loss at both study sites. Differences in mass loss by the nine 
plant species studied reflected differences in the physical and 
chemical characteristics of their leaves. Gallardo and Merino 
found that the best predictor of mass loss at the Doñana site 
was the ratio of toughness to nitrogen content, toughness/%N, 
and that mass loss was a power function of this ratio:

   Mass = 545[toughness/%N]−0.38 

This  is  the  equation  for  the  line  shown  in   figure  19.6 . This 
equation indicates that tougher leaves with lower concentra-
tions of nitrogen decomposed at a lower rate.     

 The greater mass losses at Monte La Sauceda demonstrate 
a  positive  influence  of  moisture  on  rates  of  decomposition, 
while  differences  in  decomposition  rates  among  leaf  species 
show the influences of chemical composition on decomposi-
tion. Even toughness, which is a physical property, is a conse-
quence of chemical composition, especially the concentration 
of lignin. As we will see in the next example, the ratio of lignin 
concentration to nitrogen content in leaves is also highly corre-
lated with decomposition rates in temperate forest ecosystems.

 In  both  the  New  Hampshire  and  North  Carolina  for-
ests, the researchers found a negative correlation between the 
leaf  mass  remaining  after  1  year  of  decomposition  and  the 
ratio of lignin to nitrogen concentrations in leaves, % lignin:
% N. In other words, leaves with higher lignin:nitrogen ratios 
lost  less  mass  during  the  year-long  study. As  you  can  see  in 
  figure 19.7 , the amount of leaf mass remaining was lower at the 
North Carolina site than at the New Hampshire site. What fac-
tors were responsible for these higher rates of decomposition at

 Influence of lignin and nitrogen content of leaves on 

the North Carolina site? Melillo and his colleagues suggested 
that higher nitrogen availability in the soils at the North Caro-
lina site may contribute to the higher rates of decomposition 
observed there. However, higher temperatures at the North Car-
olina site may also contribute to higher decomposition rates.   

 Studies in both temperate and Mediterranean regions sug-
gest that rates of decomposition are positively correlated with 
temperature and moisture. Can we combine these two factors 
into  one?  In  chapter  18,  we  reviewed  how  ecologists  study-
ing  the  effect  of  climate  on  terrestrial  primary  production 
combined temperature and precipitation into a single measure 
called actual evapotranspiration, or AET. Vernon Meentemeyer 
(1978) analyzed the relationship between AET and decompo-
sition and found a significant positive relationship ( fig. 19.8 ).     
 If  decomposition  rates  increase  with  increased  evapo-
transpiration, how would you expect rates of decomposition in 
tropical and temperate ecosystems to compare? As you prob-
ably predicted, rates of decomposition are generally higher in 
tropical  ecosystems. The  average  annual  mass  loss  in  tropi-
cal forests shown in  figure 19.9  is 120%, or three times the 
average rate measured in temperate forests. These higher rates 
probably reflect the effects of higher AET in tropical forests 
and indicate complete decomposition in less than a year.     

 Soil nutrient content has also been shown to have a strong 
positive effect on rates of nutrient cycling in tropical forests. 
Three forest ecologists, Masaaki Takyu, Shin-Ichiro Aiba, and 
Kanehiro  Kitayama,  took  advantage  of  natural  variation  in

tended to have higher nutrient content compared to soils on 
the other rock types in the study, especially on lower slopes 
( fig.  19.10 ). Two  older  rock  types  were  both  approximately 
40 million years old. One, a Tertiary sedimentary rock, sup-
ported soils that were considerably more fertile than the other, 
an ultrabasic rock.

formed on three rock types and at two topographic positions in 
Borneo (means, 1 standard deviation) (data from Takyu, Aiba, and 
Kitayama 2003). 

 Takyu,  Aiba,  and  Kitayama’s  study  clearly  demon-
strated the influence of soil fertility on rates of decomposi-
tion  and  nutrient  cycling.  Because  all  study  sites  were  at 
approximately  the  same  elevation  and  all  were  on  south-
facing  aspects,  the  research  team  was  able  to  isolate  the 
influences of geological conditions, especially soil charac-
teristics. Takyu, Aiba, and Kitayama found higher rates of 
aboveground  net  primary  production,  higher  rates  of  litter 
fall, and higher rates of decomposition on sites with higher 
concentrations  of  soluble  phosphorus  in  topsoil,  particu-
larly on soils formed on the lower slopes of Quaternary and 
Tertiary rock formations. These results show that while cli-
mate may have a primary influence on decomposition rates, 
within  climatic  regions  nutrient  availability  has  an  eco-
logically  significant  effect  on  decomposition  and  nutrient 
cycling rates. 

 In  summary,  decomposition  in  terrestrial  ecosystems  is 
influenced  by  moisture,  temperature,  soil  fertility,  and  the 
chemical composition of litter, especially the  concentrations 
of nitrogen and lignin. With the obvious exception of mois-
ture,  these  factors  also  influence  decomposition  rates  in 
aquatic ecosystems, which we examine next.  

  Decomposition in Aquatic Ecosystems 
 Jack Webster  and  Fred  Benfield  (1986)  reviewed  what  was 
known  about  the  decomposition  of  plant  tissues  in  fresh- 
water ecosystems. Among the most important variables that 
emerged  from  their  analysis  were  leaf  species,  temperature, 
and nutrient concentrations in the aquatic ecosystem. 

 Webster  and  Benfield  summarized  the  rates  of  leaf 
breakdown  for  596  types  of  woody  and  nonwoody  plants 
decaying  in  aquatic  ecosystems  and  found  that  the  aver-
age  daily  breakdown  rate  varied  more  than  tenfold. As  in 

terrestrial  ecosystems,  the  chemical  composition  of  litter 
significantly  influences  rates  of  decomposition  in  aquatic 
ecosystems. 

 Mark Gessner and Eric Chauvet (1994) studied the influ-
ence  of  litter  chemistry  on  the  rate  of  leaf  decomposition. 
Their study site was a stream in the French Pyrenees. They 
included the leaves of several species of trees. The research-
ers found that leaves with a higher lignin content decomposed 
at a slower rate ( fig. 19.11 ). What causes this? Gessner and 
Chauvet showed that a higher lignin content inhibits coloniza-
tion  of  leaves  by  fungi,  the  main  organisms  responsible  for 
decomposition of leaves in streams.   

 The  nutrient  content  of  stream  water  can  also  influence 
rates  of  decomposition.  Keller  Suberkropp  and  Eric  Chauvet 
(1995) studied how water chemistry affects rates of leaf decom-
position,  using  the  leaves  of  yellow  poplar,   Liriodendron 
tulipifera.   They  placed  the  leaves  in  several  temperate  zone 
streams differing in water chemistry. The leaves in their litter 
bags decayed as an exponential function of time, following the 
relationship:

mt = m0e−kt

    where:

    m   t   is the mass of leaves at time  t   
   m  0  is the initial mass of leaves  
   e  is the base of the natural logarithms  
   t  is time in days  
   k  is the daily rate of mass loss    

 We  can  use  the  constant   k   as  an  index  of  decay  rate  under 
particular  environmental  conditions.  Suberkropp  and 
Chauvet found that  k  varied significantly among their study 
streams  . It turned out that leaves decayed faster—that is, had 
higher   k,   in  streams  with  higher  concentrations  of  nitrates 
( fig. 19.12 ). This result is consistent with the suggestion by 
Melillo’s research team that higher rates of decomposition at

Investigating the Evidence  19

  Assumptions for Statistical Tests 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 19.10  Summarize the importance of the normal distribu-
tion to the t-test and to estimating 95% confidence 
intervals.

 19.11  List some characteristics of ecological systems that 

do not generally show a normal distribution.

 In chapter 18 (p. 406) we compared samples from two popu-
lations using the  t -test to judge whether there was a statisti-
cally  significant  difference  between  the  populations. While 
the  t -test is one of the most valuable tools for comparisons 
of pairs of samples, like any tool there are situations where 
it is appropriate to use a  t -test and others where it is not. The 
 t -test is based on a number of assumptions, as are other sta-
tistical tests. 

 One  requirement  of  the   t -test  is  that  the  populations 
being  compared  have  equal  variances.  Another  assump-
tion of the  t -test is that each of the samples is drawn from a 
population with a    normal distribution    .  We first considered 
this assumption in chapter 3 (p. 52), when we discussed the 
assumptions  underlying  calculating  the  sample  mean  as  a 
way of estimating the average, or typical, in a population. As 
we saw, the sample mean was appropriate for one population 
(a sample of seedling heights) but not appropriate for another 

(a  sample  of  stream  invertebrate  densities)  that  we  consid-
ered. A  normal  distribution  is  also  assumed  for  calculating 
95% confidence intervals (p. 345) and for regression analysis 
(p. 188). 

 Let’s consider the assumption of a normal distribution in 
a bit more detail. A normal distribution has a particular shape. 
As  shown  in   figure  1 ,  a  normal  distribution  is  bell-shaped 
and proportioned in such a way that predictable percentages 
of  the  observations,  or  measurements,  will  fall  within  one, 
two, or three standard deviations of the mean (see chapter 4, 
p. 88). If the characteristic of interest is not normally distrib-
uted, then we cannot be certain, for instance, that a 95% con-
fidence  interval  will  be  accurate  or  that  two  sample  means 
compared using a  t -test are statistically different. Fortunately, 
many of the kinds of measurements made by ecologists, such 
as weights of individuals, body lengths or lengths of append-
ages,  running  speeds,  or  rates  of  photosynthesis,  have  nor-
mal  distributions.  In  addition,  the  fit  of  measurements  to  a 
normal distribution does not have to be exact. For example, 
the   t -test  will  produce  reliable  results  if  the  distribution  of 
measurements is fairly symmetrical around the mean. Also, 
the   t -test  can  give  reliable  results  with  some  differences  in 
variances,  as  long  as  the  sizes  of  samples  being  compared 
are similar.     

 However, there are some important attributes of ecologi-
cal  systems  that  are  not  distributed  normally. These  include 
population  densities  (numbers  per  unit  area)  of  plants  or

animals,  proportions  of  different  species  in  a  community, 
 percentage of time that an animal spends in different activi-
ties, and exponential rates of litter decay. One way to analyze 
such  data  is  to  use  statistical  methods  that  do  not  assume  a 
normal distribution. We entered this area in chapter 3 (p. 52) 
where we discussed the sample median. We will explore this 
area further in chapters 20 to 22. 

  C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  19 
     1.  Suppose you sample two populations for a characteristic 
that has a normal distribution in both populations but is 
much more variable in one of the populations compared 
to the other. In general, would it be appropriate to test for 
statistical differences in the characteristic in the two popu-
lations using a  t -test?     

Yellow poplar leaves 
decompose faster in streams 
with higher nitrate content.

Rate of leaf decomposition 
increased rapidly as phosphorus 
concentration increased.

Rate then leveled off at 
higher concentrations 
of phosphorus.

  Concept 19.2 Review 

      1.   During the past 30 years, thousands of papers have been 
published on decomposition within ecosystems. Why have 
ecologists spent so much time studying decomposition?  

     2.   The concentration of atmospheric CO 2 , which continues 
to  rise  (see  chapter  23,  p.  520),  has  been  shown  to  be 
associated with an increased lignin content of the leaves 
of some plant species. Why is this potential change in 
leaf  chemistry,  in  response  to  increased  atmospheric 
CO 2 , an active area of research by ecosystem ecologists?  
     3.   How  are  the  results  of  Suberkropp  and  Chauvet  (see 
 fig. 19.12 ) and Rosemond (see  fig. 19.13 ) similar? How 
do their results differ?

 Stream nitrate and decomposition of  Liriodendron  

one of their study sites was due to higher availability of soil

 Amy Rosemond and several colleagues of the University 
of  Georgia  conducted  a  similar  study  in  streams  draining  a 
tropical  forest  in  Costa  Rica  (Rosemond  et  al.  2002).  They 
placed leaves of  Ficus insipida,  a tree that commonly grows 
along streams in Central America, at 16 stream sites that var-
ied substantially in phosphorus concentration. Leaf decompo-
sition  rate  increased  markedly  as  phosphorus  concentration 
increased to about 20  m g per liter, after which decomposition 
rate leveled off ( fig. 19.13 ).   

 As in terrestrial ecosystems, litter chemistry and nutrient 
availability  in  the  environment  affect  decomposition  rates 
in  aquatic  ecosystems.  The  patterns  discussed  in  this  sec-
tion emphasize the role played by the physical and chemical 
environment  in  the  process  of  decomposition. As  we  shall 
see in the next section, however, animals and plants can also 
significantly affect the nutrient dynamics of ecosystems.

  19.3  Organisms and Nutrients 
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 19.12  Describe the phenomenon of nutrient spiraling in 

stream ecosystems.

 19.13  Predict how changes in velocity of nutrient move-
ment (V) and time required for a nutrient atom to 
cycle (T) affect spiraling length (S).

 19.14  Explain the relationship between nutrient spiraling 

length and stream retentiveness. 

 19.15  Discuss the influence of organisms on nutrients in 

aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

 19.16  Explain the relationship between the N:P ratios of 

aquatic vertebrates and the ratio of N:P that they 
excrete.

   Plants and animals can modify the distribution and cycling 
of nutrients in ecosystems.   How much do particular organ-
isms  affect  ecosystem  processes? With  the  threats  of  global 
change and mass extinction looming ever larger, this is one of 
the most important questions of our time. We do not yet know 
enough to offer a satisfying answer to this important question, 
but  the  information  we  do  possess  indicates  that  individual 
plant and animal species can substantially influence the distri-
bution and dynamics of nutrients within ecosystems.  

   Nutrient Cycling in Streams and Lakes 
 Before we consider how stream animals influence the dynam-
ics of nutrient turnover in streams, we have to consider some 
special  features  of  this  ecosystem. As  we  saw  in  chapter  3, 
the  most  distinctive  feature  of  stream  and  river  ecosystems 
is water flow. Jack Webster (1975) was the first to point out 
that  because  nutrients  in  streams  are  subject  to  downstream 
transport,  there  is  little  nutrient  cycling  in  one  place. Water 
currents move nutrients downstream. Webster suggested that 
rather  than  a  stationary  cycle,  stream  nutrient  dynamics  are 
better  represented  by  a  spiral.  He  coined  the  term      nutrient 
spiraling    to describe stream nutrient dynamics. 

 As  an  atom  of  a  nutrient  completes  a  cycle  within  a 
stream,  it  may  pass  through  several  ecosystem  components 
such as an algal cell, an invertebrate, a fish, or a detrital frag-
ment. Each of these ecosystem components may be displaced 
downstream  by  current  and  therefore  contribute  to  nutrient 
spiraling. The length of stream required for an atom of a nutri-
ent to complete a cycle is called the     spiraling length    .  Spiral-
ing length is related to the rate of nutrient cycling and average 
velocity  of  nutrient  movement  downstream.  Denis  Newbold 
and his colleagues (1983) represented spiraling length,  S,  as:

S = VT    

where  V  is the average velocity at which a nutrient atom moves 
downstream  and   T   is  the  average  time  for  a  nutrient  atom  to 
complete a cycle. If velocity,  V,  is low and the time to complete 
a  nutrient  cycle,   T,   is  short,  nutrient  spiraling  length  is  short. 

Where spiraling lengths are short, a particular nutrient atom may 
be used many times before it is washed out of a stream system. 
 The tendency of an ecosystem to retain nutrients is called 
nutrient  retentiveness    .   In  stream  ecosystems,  retentiveness 
is inversely related to spiraling length. Short spiraling lengths 
are  equated  with  high  retentiveness  and  long  spiraling 
lengths with low retentiveness. Any factors that influence spi-
raling length affect nutrient retention by stream ecosystems. 

  Stream Invertebrates 
and Spiraling Length 
 Nancy Grimm (1988) showed that aquatic macroinvertebrates 
significantly increase the rate of nitrogen cycling in Sycamore 
Creek, Arizona. Streams in the arid American Southwest sup-
port  high  levels  of  macroinvertebrate  biomass.  Grimm  esti-
mated  invertebrate  population  densities  as  high  as  110,000 
individuals per square meter and dry biomass as high as 9.62 g 
per square meter. More than 80% of macroinvertebrate bio-
mass in Sycamore Creek was made up of species that feed on 
small organic particles, a feeding group that stream ecologists 
call  collector-gatherers.  The collector-gatherers of Sycamore 
Creek  are  dominated  by  two  families  of  mayflies,  Baetidae 
and Tricorythidae, and one family of Diptera, Chironomidae. 
 Grimm  quantified  the  influence  of  macroinvertebrates  on 
the nitrogen dynamics in the creek, where primary production is 
limited by nitrogen availability. She developed nitrogen budgets 
for stream invertebrates, mainly insect larvae and snails, by quan-
tifying  their  rates  of  nitrogen  ingestion,  egestion  (defecation), 
excretion, and accumulation during growth. By combining these 
rates with her estimates of macroinvertebrate biomass, Grimm 
was able to estimate the contribution of macroinvertebrates to 
the nutrient dynamics of the Sycamore Creek ecosystem. 

 Her measurements indicated that macroinvertebrates could 
play  an  important  role  in  nutrient  spiraling.  To  determine 
whether they play such a role, what information do we need? 
We  need  to  know  how  much  of  the  available  nitrogen  they 
ingest. If invertebrates ingest a large proportion of the nitro-
gen pool, then their influences on nitrogen spiraling may be 
substantial.   Grimm measured the nutrient retention of Syca-
more  Creek  as  the  daily  difference  between  nitrogen  inputs 
and outputs in her study area. Grimm set this rate of retention 
as 100% and then expressed her estimates of flux rates as a 
percentage of this total ( fig. 19.14 ). Daily nitrogen ingestion 
rates by macroinvertebrates averaged about 131%. How can 
ingestion rates be greater than 100%? What this means is that 
the collector-gatherers in the study stream reingest nitrogen in 
their feces. This is a well-known habit of detritivores, many of 
which gain more nutritional value from their food by process-
ing it more than once.   

 Grimm suggests that rapid recycling of nitrogen by mac-
roinvertebrates may increase primary production in Sycamore 
Creek. Stream macroinvertebrates excreted and recycled 15% 
to 70% of the nitrogen pool as ammonia. By their high rates of 
feeding  on  the  particulate  nitrogen  pool  and  their  high  rates 
of excretion of ammonia, the macroinvertebrates of the creek 
reduce the  T  in the equation for spiral length,  S   5   VT.  This effect

  The Effect of Vertebrate Species 
on Nutrient Cycling in Aquatic Ecosystems 
 As we saw in chapter 7, organisms allocate nutrients in differ-
ent ways. In general, adult animals of a given species main-
tain a relatively constant nutrient content of their body. Most 
herbivores  and  detritivores  must  overcome  large  differences 
between the low nutrient content of their food and their own 
elemental  requirements  (see  chapter  7,  p.  157).  Remember 
that  when  an  element  is  in  high  demand,  it  will  be  seques-
tered from food to build tissues, whereas other elements will 
be egested or excreted. Therefore, differences in the ratio of 
nitrogen:phosphorus  (N:P)  for  different  species  could  influ-
ence the ratio of N:P recycled into the environment. 

 Michael  Vanni,  Alexander  Flecker,  James  Hood,  and 
Jenifer Headworth (2002) sought to find out how animal spe-
cies identity and N:P ratio affect nutrient cycling in the Rio 
Las  Marías,  a  tropical  stream  in Venezuela. They  measured 
the N:P ratio of 26 fish species and 2 amphibian species. The 
species  in  the  study  had  diets  of  mainly  algae  and  detritus. 
Excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus was quantified by con-
fining individuals of each species in a plastic bag containing 
filtered stream water for about 1 hour and then analyzing the 
nutrient content of the water. 

 Vanni  and  his  colleagues  found  a  negative  correlation 
between the excretion ratios of N:P and the N:P of each spe-
cies ( fig. 19.15 ). The N:P ratios of fish and amphibians varied 
from  about  4  to  23. This  variation  in  N:P  ratio  was  mainly 

caused  by  differences  in  allocation  of  phosphorus  for  each 
species. For example, armored catfish species (Loricariidae) 
had the highest phosphorus content and lowest N:P. These fish 
species require large amounts of phosphorus relative to other 
fish and amphibians to make their bonelike armor. As a result, 
armored  catfish  had  a  low  N:P  ratio  and  excreted  relatively 
less phosphorus than fish and tadpole species with higher N:P 
ratios and lower phosphorus demands.     

Loricariids have a high P
requirement, so they have
low P excretion rates and
higher N:P excretion
ratios than...

of nutrients within prairie ecosystems. This should not be sur-
prising since these researchers estimate that prairie dogs con-
sume or waste 60% to 80% of the net annual production from 
the grass-dominated areas around their colonies. One result of 
this heavy grazing is that aboveground biomass is reduced by 
33% to 67% and the young grass tissue that remains is higher 
in nitrogen content ( fig. 19.18 ). This higher nitrogen content 
may influence the behavior of bison, which spend a dispropor-
tionate amount of their time grazing near prairie dog colonies. 
   Bison  and  other  large  herbivorous  mammals,  such  as 
moose and African buffalo, may also influence the cycling of 
nutrients within terrestrial ecosystems. Sam McNaughton and 
his  colleagues  (1988)  report  a  positive  relationship  between 
grazing intensity and the rate of turnover of plant biomass in 
the Serengeti Plain of eastern Africa.   Figure 19.19  suggests 
that increased grazing increases the rate of nutrient cycling.

 freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems during and after spawning. 

 Salmon transport nutrients from marine to 

 How important is the transport of nutrients by animals across 
ecosystem  boundaries?  The  life  cycle  of  anadromous  Pacific 
salmon, ( Oncorhynchus  spp .)  is a dramatic example of how ani-
mals  can  affect  nutrient  cycling  across  ecosystem  boundaries 
(see chapter 12, p. 258).  Oncorhynchus  spp. spend most of their 
lives at sea before they return to spawn and die in the streams and 
lakes where they were born. Annual spawning of  Oncorhynchus  
spp .  provides an important seasonal food resource for mammals 
and  birds,  and  the  marine-derived  nutrients  from  salmon  car-
casses are utilized by multiple trophic levels in both freshwater 
and terrestrial ecosystems ( fig. 19.16 ; Naiman et al. 2002).   

 As we shall see in the next section, consumers can also 
substantially affect nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.   

  Animals and Nutrient Cycling 
in Terrestrial Ecosystems 
 As we saw in chapter 16, burrowing animals, such as prairie 
dogs  and  pocket  gophers,  affect  local  plant  diversity. These 
burrowers also alter the distribution and abundance of nitro-
gen within their ecosystems. 

 Pocket gophers can significantly affect their ecosystems 
because,  as  we  discussed  in  chapter  16,  their  mounds  may 
cover  as  much  as  25%  to  30%  of  the  ground  surface.  This 
deposition  represents  a  massive  reorganization  of  soils  and 
a substantial energy investment, since the cost of burrowing 
is 360 to 3,400 times that of aboveground movements. Esti-
mates of the amount of soil deposited in mounds by gophers 
range from 10,000 to 85,000 kg per hectare per year. 

 Nancy  Huntly  and  Richard  Inouye  (1988)  found  that 
pocket gophers altered the nitrogen cycle at the Cedar Creek 
Natural History Area in Minnesota by bringing nitrogen-poor 
subsoil to the surface ( fig. 19.17 ). The result was greater hor-
izontal heterogeneity in nitrogen availability and greater het-
erogeneity in light penetration. These effects on the nitrogen 
cycle in prairie ecosystems help explain some of the positive 
influences that pocket gophers have on plant diversity.     

 April Whicker  and  James  Detling  (1988)  found  that  the 
feeding activities of prairie dogs also influence the distribution

 Effect of grazing on time required for turnover of 

 McNaughton  has  built  a  model  for  nutrient  cycling  in 
grasslands  that  distinguishes  between  decomposition  and 
grazing.  He  proposes  that  having  a  grazer  pathway  in  an 
ecosystem  speeds  up  the  rate  of  nutrient  cycling.  Conse-
quently, the large herbivores of the Serengeti are functionally 
similar to the collector-gatherer invertebrates of streams (see 
 fig.  19.15 ).  Both  groups  of  organisms  speed  up  the  rate  of 
nutrient cycling in their ecosystems. As we shall see, plants 
can also have substantial influences on the nutrient dynamics 
of ecosystems.  

  Plants and the Nutrient 
Dynamics of Ecosystems 
 Plants  are  not  simply  the  passive  recipients  of  influences 
from the physical environment or from animals and microbes.  
 Plants species can influence ecosystem nutrient dynamics by 
a variety of mechanisms. Differences in plant species traits, 
such  as  nutrient  uptake,  allocation,  and  loss  affect  nutrient 
cycling. 

 In general, plants in low-nutrient ecosystems tend to grow 
more  slowly  to  decrease  their  nutrient  demand  and  allocate 
more resources to roots to access nutrients in the soil. Plants 
in these ecosystems produce litter with high-lignin and low-
nutrient content that decomposes slowly and deters herbivory. 
Ecosystems  with  greater  nutrient  availability  generally  sup-
port plants species that grow rapidly and that allocate more 
to shoots and leaves that contain nutrient levels that promote 
decomposition. 

 Studies  mentioned  earlier  in  this  chapter  showed  that 
within an ecosystem, plant species exhibit wide variation in 
the lignin, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content of their 
leaves, which affects rates of decomposition and mineraliza-
tion of nutrients. In the following study, we will see how an 
introduced plant can modify nutrient levels in an ecosystem. 

  An Introduced Tree 
and Hawaiian Ecosystems 
 The  Hawaiian  Islands  have  been  intensely  invaded  by  both 
animals  and  plants.  The  native  flora  included  approximately 
1,200 species, of which over 90% were found nowhere else on 
earth. Humans have added approximately 4,600 exotic species 
to the Hawaiian flora. As you might expect, many of these exotic 
species significantly affect native populations, communities, and 
ecosystems. Peter Vitousek and Lawrence Walker (1989) found 
that an invading nitrogen-fixing tree,  Myrica faya,  is altering the 
nitrogen dynamics of ecosystems in Hawaii. 

  Myrica   is  a  native  of  the  Canary,  Azore,  and  Madeira 
Islands  in  the  North Atlantic,  where  it  grows  on  lava  flows 
and volcanic soils. The tree was introduced to Hawaii in the 
late  1800s  as  an  ornamental  or  medicinal  plant  and  then,  in 
the  1920s  and  1930s,  was  planted  widely  by  the  Hawaiian 
Territorial Department of Forestry for watershed reclamation. 
The species now occurs on five of the largest of the Hawaiian 
Islands.  Myrica  in Hawaii is highly invasive, quickly spreading 
over thousands of hectares. It has the potential to modify the 
nutrient  dynamics  of  Hawaiian  ecosystems  because  it  main-
tains a mutualistic relationship with a nitrogen-fixing fungus. 
 Vitousek and Walker studied the influence of  Myrica  on 
ecosystem properties in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. 
Their study site was located near the summit of Kilauea Vol-
cano at an elevation of 1,100 to 1,250 m. In one of their study 
areas,  Myrica  is codominant with the native tree  Metrosideros 
polymorpha.  

 Vitousek and Walker estimated the rate of nitrogen fixa-
tion by  Myrica  in order to assess the rate at which the species 
adds nitrogen to the ecosystem. They put the contributions of 
nitrogen fixation by the tree into context by also estimating 
the  other  nitrogen  inputs  to  the  ecosystem.  They  identified 
several indigenous sources of nitrogen fixation that included 
lichens, bacteria, and algae. Another major source of nitrogen 
to their study ecosystem was nitrogen in precipitation. 

 In the area where  Myrica  is codominant with the native tree 
 Metrosideros,  nitrogen fixation by  Myrica  is clearly the single 
largest source of nitrogen input to the ecosystem ( fig. 19.20 ). 
As  you  might  expect,  the  leaf  tissues  of   Myrica   contain  a 
higher  concentration  of  nitrogen  than  those  of   Metrosideros  
( fig. 19.21 ). The higher nitrogen content of the leaves is associ-
ated with a higher rate of decomposition and greater nitrogen 
release during decomposition. The result of these processes is 
increased nitrogen content in the soils associated with  Myrica.        
 In  summary,  invasive  plants  can  substantially  alter  the 
nutrient dynamics of ecosystems. Vitousek and Walker sug-
gest that the effects of invading species on ecosystem prop-
erties  may  offer  the  opportunity  to  trace  the  influences  of 
individual  species  through  the  ecosystem  and  back  to  the 
population. Native species undoubtedly have similar effects. 
However,  the  effects  of  invading  species  are  often  more 
apparent,  particularly  where  they  are  changing  fundamental 
characteristics of entire ecosystems. 

 The introduction of exotic plants to ecosystems may be con-
sidered as a type of disturbance. In the next section, we review 
how disturbance increases rates of nutrient loss from ecosystems.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 19.17  Describe the effects of disturbance by deforestation 
on nutrient loss from the Hubbard Brook Experimen-
tal Forest.

 19.18  Predict what would have happened to nutrient losses 
during the deforestation experiment at the Hubbard 
Brook Experimental Forest, if Likens and Bormann 
had not applied herbicides on their deforested basin 
over a period of 3 years.

 19.19  Explain why the Bear Brook ecosystem exports 

more phosphorus than it receives as inputs on some 
years, while in other years, it exports less than it 
receives as inputs.

   Disturbance  generally  increases  nutrient  loss  from 
ecosystems.  
In the previous section we saw how macroin-
vertebrates may increase nutrient retention by stream ecosys-
tems.  In  this  section,  we  consider  evidence  that  disturbance 
affects  nutrient retention.  

   Disturbance and Nutrient 
Loss from Forests 
 As Gene Likens and Herbert Bormann watched, work crews 
felled the trees covering an entire stream basin in the Hubbard 
Brook Experimental Forest of New Hampshire. The felling of 
these trees was a key part of an experiment that Likens and 
Bormann had designed to study how forests affect the loss of 
nutrients, such as nitrogen, from forested lands (Bormann and 
Likens 1994; Likens and Bormann 1995). They had studied 
two small stream valleys for 3 years before cutting the trees 
in  one  of  the  valleys.  The  undisturbed  stream  valley  would 
act as a control against which to compare the response of the 
deforested stream valley ( fig. 19.22 ).     

 Before they deforested the experimental basin, Likens and 
Bormann inventoried the distribution of nutrients. Those mea-
surements indicated that over 90% of the nutrients in the ecosys-
tem were tied up in soil organic matter. Most of the rest, 9.5%, 
was in vegetation. They estimated the rates at which some organ-
isms fix atmospheric nitrogen and the rates at which weathering 
releases nutrients from the granite bedrock of the stream basins. 
They also measured the input of nutrients to the forest ecosys-
tem from precipitation and nutrient outputs with stream water. 
The annual nutrient outputs in streamflow amounted to less than 
1% of the amount contained within the forest ecosystems. After 
this  preliminary  work,  Likens  and  Bormann  cut  the  trees  on 
their experimental stream basin. They then used herbicides to 
suppress regrowth of vegetation in their experimental basin and 
continued to apply herbicides for 3 years. 

 The increased rates of nutrient loss following forest cut-
ting were dramatic. The connection between forest cutting and 
increased nutrient output is shown clearly by plotting nutrient 
concentrations in the streams draining experimental and con-
trol stream basins.  Figure 19.23  shows the highly significant 

(see  chapter  20).  Monica  Turner  and  her  colleagues  (2009) 
demonstrated biological influences on nutrient retention from 
forest ecosystems following the stand-replacing fires of 1988 
in Yellowstone  National  Park,  Wyoming.  These  forests  are 
dominated by lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta ) with a diverse 
understory plant community of understory plants that quickly 
regenerated following the fire (Turner et al. 2003). The studies of 
the Yellowstone fires suggests that the young, rapidly growing  
P.  contorta   forest  and  understory  vegetation  was  a  nitrogen 
sink in the ecosystem. Turner’s work also indicates that not 
all ecosystems lose nutrients following a disturbance and that 
many factors affect nutrient retention over time. 

 What do these results suggest about the role of vegeta-
tion in preventing losses of nitrogen from forest ecosystems? 
Over the short term, at least, uptake by vegetation in ecosys-
tems with high rates of plant growth should be able to rapidly 
reduce nitrogen loss following disturbance. 

 Now let’s consider how disturbance affects nutrient losses 
from  stream  ecosystems,  where  nutrient  loss  appears  to  be 
highly episodic and associated with disturbance during flooding.  

  Flooding and Nutrient Export 
by Streams 
 How do the nutrient dynamics of stream ecosystems respond 
to  variations  in  streamflow?  Judy  Meyer  and  Gene  Likens 
(1979)  examined  the  long-term  dynamics  of  phosphorus  in 
Bear Brook, a stream ecosystem in the Hubbard Brook Exper-
imental  Forest.  They  found  that  during  periods  of  average 
flow, the ratio of annual phosphorus inputs to exports varied 
from 0.56 to 1.6 and that the balance depended upon stream 
discharge. Meyer and Likens found that exports were highly 
episodic and associated with periods of high flow. 

 How  did  Meyer  and  Likens  determine  the  phospho-
rus  dynamics  of  Bear  Brook  ecosystem?  They  measured 
the  geological  and  meteorological  inputs  and  the  geological 
exports of phosphorus in the stream, which they divided into 

Clear-cutting the experimental 
basin increased losses of 
nitrates more than 10 times.

three  size  fractions:  (1)  dissolved  phosphorus,  < 0.45   m m, 
(2) phosphorus associated with fine particles, 0.45  m m to 1 mm, 
and (3) phosphorus associated with coarse particles, >1 mm. 

 Meyer  and  Likens  inventoried  the  movement  and  storage 
of phosphorus in the Bear Brook ecosystem. They measured the 
inputs of dissolved phosphorus at 12 seeps (areas of groundwater 
input)  along  the  length  of  the  stream.  They  also  measured 
meteorological  inputs,  which  included  precipitation  and  forest 
litter  falling  or  blowing  into  the  stream.  The  only  significant 
export  of  phosphorus  in  the  ecosystem  was  transport  with 
streamflow. The researchers measured the amount of particulate 
matter transported by the Bear Brook ecosystem by collecting 
the organic matter deposited behind the weir (a small dam used 
to measure streamflow) on the stream and by collecting organic 
matter  captured  by  nets  set  at  seven  sites. They  estimated  the 
amount  of  organic  matter  stored  by  removing  all  the  organic 
matter in 42 randomly located 1 m 2  areas of stream bottom. 

 During  1974  to  1975,  Meyer  and  Likens  estimated  an 
almost exact balance between inputs and exports of phospho-
rus,  with  approximately  1,250  mg  of  phosphorus  per  square 
meter  of  input  and  approximately  1,300  mg  of  phosphorus 
per square meter of output. Despite a balance between input 
and output, their data indicated significant transformation of 
phosphorus-size  fractions.  Phosphorus  inputs  to  Bear  Brook 
were  almost  evenly  divided  between  dissolved  (28%),  fine 
particulate  (37%),  and  coarse  particulate  (35%)  fractions. 
However, 62% of exports were fine particulates. Clearly, phys-
ical and biological processes converted dissolved and coarse 
particulate forms of phosphorus into fine particulate forms. 

 Meyer and Likens used their estimates to reconstruct the 
long-term phosphorus dynamics of Bear Brook. During 1974 
to 1975, the ratio of phosphorus export to input was almost 
exactly  one  (1.04).  However,  the  Meyer  and  Likens  model 
of phosphorus dynamics indicated considerable year-to-year 
variation  in  this  ratio  during  the  period  from  1963  to  1975, 
which included the wettest and driest years in the 20-year pre-
cipitation  record  for  the  area.  The  predicted  ratio  of  output 
to input over this interval was highly correlated with annual 
streamflow. The ratio ranged from 0.56 in the driest year to 
1.6 in the wettest year ( fig. 19.24 ). In other words, during the 
driest  year  only  56%  of  phosphorus  inputs  were  exported, 
while during the wettest year exports amounted to 160% of 
inputs. In wet years the stream ecosystem’s standing stocks of 
phosphorus were reduced by high levels of export.   

 The  patterns  of  inputs  and  exports  of  phosphorus  from 
Bear  Brook  were  highly  pulsed  during  Meyer  and  Likens’ 
study ( fig. 19.25 ). They estimated that from 1974 to 1975, 48% 
of total annual input of phosphorus to Bear Brook entered dur-
ing 10 days and that 67% of exports left the ecosystem during 
10 days. The annual peak in phosphorus input was associated 
with autumn leaf fall, and an annual pulse of export was asso-
ciated  with  spring  snowmelt.  Most  phosphorus  export,  how-
ever, was irregular because it was driven by flooding caused 
by intense storms that may occur during any month of the year. 
If we consider floods as a source of disturbance, the behavior 
of stream ecosystems is consistent with the generalization that 
disturbance increases the loss of nutrients from ecosystems.     

During years of low 
streamflow, Bear Brook 
stores phosphorus.

During high flow years, 
Bear Brook exports more 
phosphorus than it receives.

 Aquatic ecologists study the nutrient dynamics of aquatic 
ecosystems like Bear Brook because, as we saw in chapter 18, 
nutrient availability is a key regulator of aquatic primary produc-
tion. As we shall see in the Applications section, nutrient enrich-
ment of ecosystems by human activity is a worldwide problem.

 Human activity increasingly affects ecosystem nutrient cycles. 
Agriculture  and  forestry  can  remove  nutrients  from  ecosys-
tems.  However,  increasingly,  human  activity  enriches  ecosys-
tems  with  nutrients,  especially  with  nitrogen  (see  chapter  23) 
and phosphorus. Nitrogen enrichment comes from a variety of 
sources: combustion of fossil fuels, agricultural fertilizers, land 
clearing, forest burning, industry, and animal waste. 

 Nitrogen  from  anthropogenic  sources  enters  the  atmo-
sphere  as  emissions  or  particulates,  producing  air  pollution. 
Nitrogen  fertilization  occurs  when  biologically  available 
forms  of  nitrogen  fall  from  the  atmosphere  as  either      wet  
(precipitation) or     dry    (dry fall)     deposition    .  In the temperate 
coastal forests of southern Chile, far from urban and indus-
trial centers, inputs from nitrogen deposition amount to about 
0.1 to 1.0 kg per hectare per year. In contrast, in the Nether-
lands,  with  its  high  population  density  and  intense  agricul-
ture, the deposition of nitrogen to forest ecosystems adds up 
to about 60 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year. 

 Humans  are  also  a  major  source  of  nutrient  inputs  to 
aquatic  ecosystems.  Nutrient  enrichment  of  aquatic  ecosys-
tems can result in water quality problems and     eutrophication    ,
a process generally resulting in increased primary production, 
anoxic conditions, and reduced biodiversity. Benjamin Peierls 
and his colleagues (1991) examined the relationship of human 
population density within river basins and nitrate concentra-
tion and export by 42 major rivers. These rivers, which deliver 
approximately 37% of the total freshwater flow to the oceans, 
support human population densities ranging from 1 to 1,000 
individuals per square kilometer. 

 Peierls noted that while the concentration and export of 
nitrate  by  rivers  is  affected  by  complex  biotic,  abiotic,  and 
anthropogenic  factors,  a  single  variable,  human  population 
density, explains most of the variation in nitrate concentration 
and export ( fig. 19.26 ). The most probable sources of nitrate 
enrichment  of  river  ecosystems  are  sewage  disposal,  atmo-
spheric deposition, agriculture, and deforestation, all of which 
generally increase with increased human population density. 
The broad range of sources of nitrate is one of the main rea-
sons why is difficult to control nitrogen pollution.

 Human population density and nitrate export from 

 Cities are home to an increasing proportion of the human 
population.  Worldwide,  more  people  live  in  or  near  urban 
areas than in the more rural countryside. This concentration of 
people in cities is also associated with the concentration and 
transformation of energy, materials, and waste in a small area, 
which can have disproportionate impacts on nutrient cycling. 
Prompted by a need for better understanding of urban areas, 
ecological studies of nutrient pools and fluxes within whole 
watersheds, like those of Hubbard Brook Experimental For-
est, are being applied to these human-dominated ecosystems. 
 One of the first questions asked by ecologists is whether 
urban ecosystems within a watershed are a source or a sink for 
nutrients. Peter Groffman and his colleagues (2004) compared 
the  nitrogen  budgets  of  forested,  agricultural,  and  urbanized 
watersheds as part of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study LTER (see 
chapter 1, p. 9 and chapter 16, p. 368) with surprising results. 
They constructed a budget by calculating inputs and outputs of 
nitrogen for each watershed type. Nitrate concentrations were 
measured as a major component of nitrogen outputs in streams 
draining each watershed. As expected, mean nitrate concentra-
tions were very low in the forested watershed ( fig. 19.27 ). How-
ever, nitrate levels in dense urban areas were lower than those in 
either the suburban or agricultural watersheds.   

 What  caused  higher  nitrate  concentrations  in  streams 
draining  the  agricultural  and  suburban  watersheds?  First, 
Groffman  and  his  colleagues  compared  nitrogen  inputs  into 
the  different  watersheds.  All  of  these  watersheds  receive 
similar amounts of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. The first 
major difference in inputs was in the application of fertilizers. 
Estimates of nitrogen inputs from fertilizers were highest for 
agricultural  areas,  but  application  rates  of  fertilizer  to  resi-
dential  lawns  in  suburban  areas  were  also  substantial. They 
also  found  that  centralized  urban  sanitary  systems  can  leak 
nitrogen,  but  are  controllable.  In  contrast,  residential  septic 
systems  in  suburban  areas  are  designed  to  discharge  nitrate 
and can contribute to nitrate concentrations in streams.

 Nitrate export in streams draining watersheds with 

 The difference in nitrogen outputs from these watersheds 
could  not  be  explained  by  inputs  alone. Another  surprising 
result of Groffman’s study was that the suburban watershed 
retained  an  estimated  75%  of  nitrogen  inputs,  approach-
ing  retention  values  of  forested  watersheds  (95%).  So  even 
though the suburban areas had higher nitrogen inputs, only a 
quarter of this nitrogen was exported downstream. Groffman 
and  his  colleagues  attribute  this  high  capacity  for  nitrogen 
retention in suburban areas to actively growing lawns, wood-
lots,  and  riparian  areas  that  serve  as  nitrogen  sinks.  These 

   Summary 

permeable  areas  within  the  watershed  have  the  potential  to 
decrease  nitrogen  export  to  surface  water  through  biologi-
cal uptake and denitrification of nitrate. High nitrogen reten-
tion has also been observed for the large metropolitan area of 
Phoenix, Arizona (Baker et al. 2001). These results call into 
question a common assumption that human alteration of the 
environment limits ecological processes in urbanized areas. 

 If  urban  areas  can  retain  a  large  proportion  of  nitrogen 
inputs, why do we observe high nitrate export to rivers world-
wide dominated by human activity? Studies of nitrogen bud-
gets  in  cities  are  very  limited  and,  to  date,  incomplete.  For 
instance, the nitrogen budget for Baltimore did not include the 
large flux of food into and sewage out of the study watersheds. 
Wastewater is piped out for treatment on much larger streams 
or bays where wastewater effluent can be safely discharged. 
Most  cities  around  the  globe  are  facing  the  challenge  of 
minimizing  nitrogen  pollution  without  proper  infrastructure 
and planning. In a review of urban ecological studies, Emily 
Bernhardt and her colleagues (2008) suggest that cities need 
to  integrate  nitrogen  reduction  strategies  into  their  manage-
ment plans to minimize impacts on water quality. However, 
while  scientists  can  make  recommendations  based  on  their 
research,  they  do  not  make  or  implement  policy.  Cities  are 
dynamic,  complex,  socio-ecological  systems  that  require 
close cooperation of scientists, managers, and citizens to min-
imize nutrient pollution. 

 In  summary,  we  know  there  is  a  direct  connection 
between  human  activity  and  nutrient  enrichment  of  ecosys-
tems and that nutrient enrichment has a number of negative 
consequences. Application of an ecosystem approach to stud-
ies of nitrogen pools and fluxes within urban watersheds has 
advanced our understanding of nutrient cycling in urban sys-
tems, but much work remains at this frontier of ecology.     

  Nutrient cycles involve the storage of chemical elements in 
nutrient pools, or compartments, and the flux, or trans-
fer,  of  nutrients  between  pools.     The  elements  organisms 
require for development, maintenance, and reproduction are 
called   nutrients.   Ecologists  refer  to  the  use,  transformation, 
movement,  and  reuse  of  nutrients  in  ecosystems  as   nutri-
ent  cycling.   The   carbon,  nitrogen,   and   phosphorus  cycles  
have  played  especially  prominent  roles  in  studies  of  nutri-
ent cycling. The rate of CO 2  buildup in the atmosphere has 
been significantly slower than scientists would predict given 
the rate of emissions to the atmosphere by fossil fuel burning 
minus known carbon sinks. The best current estimates are that 
the missing carbon sink is formed by a combination of north-
ern and tropical forests. 

  Decomposition  rate  is  influenced  by  temperature, 
moisture,  and  chemical  composition  of  litter  and  the  
 environment.   The rate of decomposition affects the rate at 
which nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are made 
available to primary producers. Rates of decomposition in 

terrestrial ecosystems are higher under warm, moist condi-
tions.  The  rate  of  decomposition  in  terrestrial  ecosystems 
increases   with  nitrogen  content  and  decreases  with  the 
lignin content of litter. The chemical composition of litter 
and  the  availability  of  nutrients  in  the  surrounding  envi-
ronment  also  influence  rates  of  decomposition  in  aquatic 
ecosystems. 

  Plants and animals can modify the distribution and 
cycling  of  nutrients  in  ecosystems.    The  dynamics  of 
nutrients  in  streams  are  best  represented  by  a  spiral  rather 
than  a  cycle. The  length  of  stream  required  for  an  atom  of 
a nutrient to complete a cycle is called the spiraling length. 
Stream macroinvertebrates can substantially reduce spiraling 
length  of  nutrients  in  stream  ecosystems. Animals  can  also 
alter  the  distribution  and  rate  of  nutrient  cycling  in  terres-
trial ecosystems. The nitrogen and phosphorus composition 
of  different  species  of  fish  was  correlated  with  the  ratio  of 
N:P  they  excreted.  Spawning  salmon  can  increase  nutrient 
availability  into  streams  and  lakes.  Nitrogen-fixing  plants 

434 

Section V

increase the quantity and rates of nitrogen cycling in terres-
trial ecosystems. 

  Disturbance  generally  increases  nutrient  loss  from 
ecosystems.     Vegetation  exerts  substantial  control  on  nutri-
ent retention by terrestrial ecosystems. Vegetative controls on 
nutrient loss from forest ecosystems are important after dis-
turbance by fire. Nutrient loss by stream ecosystems is highly 
pulsed and associated with disturbance by flooding. 

 Nutrient  enrichment  by  humans  is  altering  aquatic  and 
terrestrial  ecosystems.  Nitrate  concentration  and  export  by 
the earth’s major rivers correlate directly with human popula-
tion density. A study of an urban watershed showed that cities 
can  have  higher  nutrient  retention  than  previously  expected. 
 Ecosystem-scale studies can be used as a tool to improve man-
agement of urban areas and to address challenging water quality 
problems.

  Review Questions 

     1.  Of  all  the  naturally  occurring  elements  in  the  biosphere,  why 
have  the  cycles  of  carbon,  nitrogen,  and  phosphorus  been  so 
intensively studied by ecologists? (Hint: Think about the kinds of 
organic molecules of which these elements are constituents. Also 
think back to our discussions, in chapter 18, of the influences of 
nitrogen and phosphorus on rates of primary production.)  

    2.  Parmenter  and  Lamarra  (1991)  studied  decomposition  of  fish 
and waterfowl carrion in a freshwater marsh. During the course 
of their studies they found that the soft tissues of both fish and 
waterfowl decomposed faster than the most rapidly decompos-
ing plant tissues. Explain the rapid decomposition of these ani-
mal carcasses.  

    3.  Review  figure  18.2,  in  which  Rosenzweig  (1968)  plotted  the 
relationship  between  actual  evapotranspiration  and  net  pri-
mary  production.  How  do  you  think  that  decomposition  rates 
change across the same ecosystems? Using what you learned in 
 chapter 19, design an experiment to test your hypothesis.  

    4.  Melillo, Aber, and Muratore (1982) suggested that soil fertility 
may influence the rate of decomposition in terrestrial ecosys-
tems. Design an experiment to test this hypothesis. If you test 
for the effects of soil fertility, how will you control for the influ-
ences of temperature, moisture, and litter chemistry?  

    5.  Many rivers around the world have been straightened and deep-
ened to improve conditions for navigation. Side effects of these 
changes include increased average water velocity and decreased 
movement of water into shallow riverside environments such as 
eddies and marginal wetlands. What are the probable influences 
of these changes on nutrient spiraling length? Use the model of 
Newbold et al. (1983) in your discussion.  

    6.  Likens and Bormann (1995) found that vegetation substantially 
influences the rate of nutrient loss from small stream catchments 
in the northern hardwood forest ecosystem. How do vegetative 

biomass and rates of primary production in these forests affect 
their capacity to regulate nutrient loss? How much do you think 
vegetation affects nutrient movements in desert ecosystems?  

    7.  McNaughton, Ruess, and Seagle (1988) proposed that grazing 
by large mammals increases the rate of nitrogen cycling on the 
savannas of East Africa. Explain how passing through a large 
mammal could increase the rate of breakdown of plant biomass. 
In chapter 18, we also saw how grazing mammals may increase 
the rate of primary production on the savanna. How might the 
disappearance of the large mammals of East Africa affect eco-
system processes on the savanna?  

    8.  The fynbos of South Africa is famous for the exceptional diver-
sity  of  its  plant  community.  Witkowski  (1991)  showed  that 
invading   Acacia   are  enriching  the  fynbos  soil  with  nitrogen. 
How might enriching soil nitrogen affect plant diversity in this 
ecosystem? What mechanisms would likely produce your pre-
dicted changes?  

    9.  Kauffman and his colleagues (1993) estimated that burning the 
tropical forest at their study site resulted in the loss of approxi-
mately 21 kg per hectare of phosphorus. This quantity is about 
11%  to  17%  of  the  total  pool  of  phosphorus.  If  total  annual 
inputs of phosphorus to the ecosystem, mainly by rain and “dry 
fall,” amount to about 0.2 kg per hectare per year (Murphy and 
Lugo  1986),  how  long  would  it  take  these  inputs  to  make  up 
for a single agricultural burn such as that created by Kauffman 
and his colleagues? Assuming a constant rate of loss, how many 
burns would it take to totally exhaust existing supplies?  

   10.  If rates of decomposition are higher in ecosystems with higher 
nutrient availability, how should nutrient enrichment affect rates 
of  decomposition?  Because  of  its  effects  on  fungal  diversity, 
could nutrient enrichment of ecosystems affect rates of decom-
position differently over the short term versus the long term?

Vancouver visited the inlet to what is today called  Glacier Bay, 
Alaska  ( fig.  20.1 ).  He  could  not  pass  beyond  the  inlet  to  the

changes will transform this aquatic ecosystem into a forest.

bay, however, because his way was blocked by a mountain of 
ice. Vancouver  and Vancouver  (1798)  described  the  scene  as 
follows: “The shores of the continent form two large open bays 
which were terminated by compact solid mountains of ice, ris-
ing perpendicularly from the water’s edge, and bounded to the 
north  by  a  continuation  of  the  united  lofty  frozen  mountains 
that extend eastward from Mount Fairweather.”     

 In 1879, John Muir explored the coast of Alaska, rely-
ing heavily on Vancouver’s earlier descriptions. Muir (1915) 
commented in his journal that Vancouver’s descriptions were 
excellent  guides  except  for  the  area  within  Glacier  Bay. 
Where Vancouver  had  met  “mountains  of  ice,”  Muir  found 
open water. He and his guides from the Hoona tribe paddled 
their  canoe  through  Glacier  Bay  in  rain  and  mist,  feeling 
their way through uncharted territory. They eventually found 
the glaciers, which Muir estimated had retreated 30 to 40 km 
up the glacial valley since Vancouver’s visit 85 years earlier. 
 Muir found no forests at the upper portions of the bay. He 
and his party had to build their campfires with the stumps and 
trunks  of  long-dead  trees  exposed  by  the  retreating  glaciers. 
Muir recognized that this “fossil wood” was a remnant of a for-
est that had been covered by advancing glaciers centuries earlier. 

He also saw that plants quickly colonized the areas uncovered 
by glaciers and that the oldest exposed areas, where Vancouver 
had met his mountains of ice, already supported forests. 

 Muir’s observations in Glacier Bay were published in 1915 
and  read  the  same  year  by  the  ecologist  William  S.  Cooper. 
Encouraged by Muir’s descriptions, Cooper visited Glacier Bay 
in 1916 in what was the beginning of a lifetime of study (Cooper 
1923, 1931, 1939). Cooper saw Glacier Bay as the ideal labora-
tory for the study of ecological    succession    ,  the change in plant, 
animal, and microbial communities in an area following distur-
bance or the creation of new substrate. Glacier Bay was ideal 
for the study of succession because the history of glacial retreat 
could be accurately traced back to 1794 and perhaps farther. 

 Cooper ultimately made four expeditions to Glacier Bay. 
His work and that of later ecologists produced a detailed pic-
ture of succession there. Several species of plants colonize an 
area during the first 20 years after it is exposed by the retreat-
ing glacier. These plants, the first in a successional sequence, 
form a    pioneer community    .  The most common members of 
the pioneer community are horsetail,  Equisetum varietaum;  
willow  herb,   Epilobium  latifolium;   willows,   Salix   sp.;  cot-
tonwood  seedlings,   Populus  trichocarpa;   mountain  avens, 
 Dryas drummondii;  and Sitka spruce,  Picea sitchensis.  

 About 30 years after an area is exposed, the pioneer com-
munity gradually grades into a community dominated by mats 
of  Dryas,  a dwarf shrub. These  Dryas  mats also contain scat-
tered  alder,   Alnus  sinuata,  Salix,  Populus,   and   Picea.   Then, 
about 40 years after glacial retreat, the community changes into 
a shrub-thicket dominated by  Alnus.  Soon after the closure of 
the  Alnus  thicket, however,  Populus  and  Picea  will grow above 
it, covering about 50% of the area on sites 50 to 70 years old. 
 In 75 to 100 years, succession leads to a forest commu-
nity dominated by  Picea.  Mosses carpet the understory of this 
spruce  forest  and  here  and  there  grow  seedlings  of  western 
hemlock,  Tsuga   heterophylla,  and mountain hemlock,  Tsuga 
mertensiana.  Eventually, the population of  Picea  declines and 
the forests are dominated by  Tsuga.  On landscapes with shal-
low slopes these hemlock forests eventually give way to mus-
keg, a landscape of peat bogs and scattered tussock meadows. 
 Because succession around Glacier Bay occurs on newly 
exposed  geological  substrates,  not  significantly  modified 
by  organisms,  ecologists  refer  to  this  process  as     primary 
 succession    .  Primary succession also occurs on newly formed 
volcanic  surfaces  such  as  lava  flows.  In  areas  where  distur-
bance destroys a community without destroying the soil, the 
subsequent  succession  is  called     secondary  succession    .   For 
instance, secondary succession occurs after agricultural lands 
are abandoned or after a forest fire. 

 Succession generally ends with a community whose pop-
ulations remain stable until disrupted by disturbance. This late 
successional  community  is  called  the     climax   community    .  
The  nature  of  the  climax  community  depends  upon  envi-
ronmental  circumstances.  The  communities  we  discussed 
in  chapter  2—temperate  forests,  grasslands,  etc.—were 
essentially  the  climax  communities  for  each  of  the  climatic 
regimes  that  we  considered. The  climax  community  around 
Glacier Bay is determined by the prevailing climate and local

topography.  On  well-drained,  steep  slopes,  the  climax  com-
munity is hemlock forest. In poorly drained soil on shallow 
slopes, the climax community is muskeg. 

 Studies  of  succession  show  that  communities  and  ecosys-
tems are not static but constantly change in response to distur-
bance, environmental change, and their own internal dynamics. 
In  many  cases,  the  general  direction  of  change  in  community 
structure and ecosystem processes is predictable, at least over the 
short term. The patterns of change in community and ecosystem 
properties during succession and the mechanisms responsible for 
those changes are subjects covered in chapter 20. We also con-
sider a companion topic: community and ecosystem stability.  

   20.1   Community Changes During 

Succession

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 20.4  Outline the major community changes during primary 

succession at Glacier Bay, Alaska.

 20.5  Compare patterns of community change during 

succession in various environments, for example, 
between stream communities and forest communities.

 20.6  Explain the difference in time required for pri-

mary forest succession at Glacier Bay, Alaska, and 
secondary succession on the Piedmont Plateau of 
North Carolina. 

   Community changes during succession include increases 
in  species  diversity  and  changes  in  species  composition. 
Some  of  the  most  detailed  studies  of  ecological  succes-
sion have focused on succession leading to a forest climax. 
Though primary and secondary forest succession require dif-
ferent amounts of time, the changes in species diversity that 
occur in each appear remarkably similar.  

   Primary Succession at Glacier Bay 
 We  have  already  reviewed  the  basic  patterns  of  primary  suc-
cession around Glacier Bay. Now we return to Glacier Bay to 
examine successional changes in species diversity and composi-
tion. William Reiners, Ian Worley, and Donald Lawrence (1971) 
studied changes in plant diversity during succession at Glacier 
Bay.  They  worked  at  sites  carefully  chosen  for  similarity  in 
physical features but differing substantially in age. Their eight 
study sites were below 100 m elevation and were on glacial till, 
an unstratified and unsorted material deposited by a glacier. All 
had  moderate  slopes.  The  study  sites  ranged  in  age—that  is, 
time since glacial retreat, from 10 to 1,500 years. 

 Their youngest site, which was approximately 10 years 
old, supported a pioneer community of scattered  Epilobium, 
Equisetum,  and  Salix.  Site 2 was about 23 years old and sup-
ported a mix of pioneer species and clumps of  Populus  and 
 Dryas.  Site 3, which was approximately 33 years old, sup-
ported  a  mat  of   Dryas   enclosing  clumps  of   Salix,  Populus,  

and   Alnus.   Site  4  was  44  years  old  and  was  dominated  by 
a  mat  of   Dryas   with  few  open  patches.  Site  5,  which  was 
approximately 108 years old, was dominated by a thicket of 
Alnus   and   Salix   with  enough  emergent   Populus   and   Picea
to form a partial canopy. Site 6 was a 200-year-old forest of 
Picea.  Using geological methods, Reiners and his colleagues 
dated site 7 at 500 years and site 8 at 1,500 years. Both sites 
were located on Pleasant Island, which because it is located 
outside  the  mouth  of  Glacier  Bay  had  escaped  the  most 
recent glaciation, which had destroyed the forests along the 
bay. Site 7 was an old forest of  Tsuga  that contained a few 
Picea.  Site 8 was a muskeg with scattered lodgepole pines, 
Pinus contorta.  

 The total number of plant species in the eight study sites 
increased with plot age. As you can see in  figure 20.2 , spe-
cies richness increased rapidly in the early years of succession 
at Glacier Bay and then more slowly during the later stages, 
approaching a possible plateau in species richness.     

 Not  all  groups  of  plants  increased  in  diversity  through-
out succession.  Figure 20.3  shows that while the species rich-
ness of mosses, liverworts, and lichens reached a plateau after 
about a century of succession, the diversity of tall shrubs and 
trees increased until the middle stages of succession and then 
declined in later stages. In contrast, the diversity of low shrubs 
and herbs continued to increase throughout succession.     

 The pattern of increased species richness with time that 
Reiners  and  his  colleagues  described  for  the  successional 
sequence around Glacier Bay is one that we will see several 
times in the examples that follow. However, the tempo of suc-
cession  is  far  different.  The  late  successional  climax  com-
munity at Glacier Bay was 1,500 years old. In the following 
example of secondary succession, the climax forest commu-
nity  was  150  to  200  years  old,  approximately  one-tenth  the 
age of the climax community studied at Glacier Bay.  

During succession at Glacier 
Bay, the number of plant 
species increased rapidly for 
the first 200 years and then 
began to level off.

 Succession of plant growth forms at Glacier Bay, 

  Secondary Succession 
in Temperate Forests 
 The  Piedmont  Plateau  of  eastern  North  America  includes 
some of the most convenient places to study secondary suc-
cession. The deciduous forests of this region were intensively 
cleared  and  cultivated  beginning  approximately  three  cen-
turies  ago. As  fields  were  abandoned  and  new  forest  areas 
cleared,  the  region  was  progressively  converted  to  a  patch-
work of abandoned fields of various ages interspersed with a 
few areas of undisturbed forest. 

 This  situation  provided  Henry  J.  Oosting  (1942)  with 
study sites in virtually every stage of secondary succession for 
his now classic studies of succession in the Piedmont  Plateau 
of North Carolina. David Johnston and Eugene Odum (1956) 
described the pattern of succession on the Piedmont Plateau as 
follows. The first species to colonize and dominate abandoned 
fields  are  crabgrass,   Digitaria  sanguinalis,   and  horseweed, 
 Erigeron  canadense.   During  the  second  year  of  succession, 
the fields are dominated by either aster,  Aster pilosis,  or rag-
weed,  Ambrosia artemisiifolia.  A few years later the field is 
covered by broomsedge,  Andropogon virginicus,  with a scat-
tering of shrubs and small trees. Pine seedlings may appear 
as early as the third year and may form a closed canopy in 
10  to  15  years.  Pine  seedlings  cannot  grow  in  the  shade  of 
larger  pines  but  the  seedlings  of  many  deciduous  trees  can. 
Consequently, 40- to 50-year-old pine forests generally have 
a well-developed understory of young deciduous trees. These 
deciduous trees, especially oak,  Quercus,  and hickory,  Carya,  
become the dominant trees by about 150 years, and the pines 
decline to a few scattered individuals. Because  Quercus  and 
 Carya  can reproduce in their own shade, the late successional 
oak-hickory forest is considered the climax stage. 

 Oosting’s data show that the number of woody plant species 
increased during secondary succession on the Piedmont Plateau 

( fig. 20.4 ). The successional sequence began with a single spe-
cies of woody plant invading soon after fields were abandoned 
and began to level off at 50 to 60 species after approximately 
150 years. This increase in species richness follows a logarith-
mic pattern like the one we saw at Glacier Bay.     

 How does animal diversity change across the same suc-
cessional  sequence?  Johnston  and  Odum  studied  the  birds 
living on thirteen 20-acre study sites ranging in successional 
age  from  1  to  150  years  and  supporting  vegetation  ranging 
from grassland to mature oak-hickory forest. The increase in 
bird diversity across this successional sequence closely paral-
leled the increase in woody plant diversity observed by Oost-
ing ( fig. 20.5 ). During the grass-forb stage of succession, the 
bird  community  consisted  of  2  species  generally  associated 

Number of woody plant 
species begins to level off 
after about 100 to 150 years.

with grasslands. In the grass-shrub stage, the diversity of birds 
increased to 8 to 13 species. In 25- to 35-year-old pine forests, 
the diversity of birds was 10 to 12 species, increasing to 22 to 
24 species in the later stages of succession.     

 In summary, over a period of approximately one and a half 
centuries, abandoned fields in eastern North America undergo 
successional changes in plant and bird communities that involve 
changes in species composition and increases in species diver-
sity. Similar successional changes occur in the marine intertidal 
zone but on an even shorter timescale: approximately one and a 
half years instead of one and a half centuries.  

  Succession in Rocky 
Intertidal Communities 
 When  we  discussed  the  influence  of  disturbance  on  local  spe-
cies  diversity  in  chapter  16,  we  saw  how  an  intertidal  boulder 
stripped of its cover of attached organisms was soon colonized 
by algae and barnacles ( fig. 20.6 ). Looking back on that pattern 
of community change we can now see it as an example of eco-
logical succession. Wayne Sousa (1979a, 1979b) showed that the 
first species to colonize open space on intertidal boulders were a 
green alga in the genus  Ulva  and the barnacle  Chthamalus fissus.  
The  next  arrivals  were  several  species  of  perennial  red  algae: 
 Gelidium coulteri, Gigartina leptorhynchos, Rhodoglossum affine,  

and  Gigartina canaliculata.  Finally, if there was no disturbance 
for 2 to 3 years,  G. canaliculata  grew over the other species and 
dominated 60% to 90% of the space.     

 Sousa explored succession on intertidal boulders with sev-
eral  experiments.  In  one  of  them,  he  followed  succession  on 
small boulders that he had cleaned and stabilized. As in forest 
succession, the number of species increased with time ( fig. 20.7 ). 
Notice in the figure that the average number of species increased 
until about 1 to 1.5 years and then leveled off at about five species.   
 Primary  forest  succession  around  Glacier  Bay  may 
require  about  1,500  years,  and  secondary  forest  succession 
on the Piedmont Plateau takes about 150 years. Meanwhile, 
the successional changes described by Sousa occurred within 
about  1.5  years.  In  the  next  example,  ecological  succession 
within a desert stream occurs in less than 2 months.  

  Succession in Stream Communities 
 Rapid  succession  has  been  well  documented  in  Sycamore 
Creek, Arizona, which has been studied for nearly two decades 
by Stuart Fisher and his colleagues (1982). Sycamore Creek, 
a  tributary  of  the  Verde  River,  lies  approximately  32  km 
northeast of Phoenix, Arizona, where it drains approximately 
500  km 2   of  mountainous  desert  terrain.  Evaporation  nearly 
equals precipitation within the Sycamore Creek catchment, so 
flows are generally low and often intermittent. However, the 
creek is subject to frequent flash floods with sufficient power 
to completely disrupt the community and initiate succession. 
 Fisher’s  research  team  reported  on  the  successional 
events following one such flood. Intense floods occurred on 
Sycamore Creek on August 6, 12, and 16, of 1979, with peak 
flows of 7, 3, and 2 m 3  per second, respectively. Floods of this 
intensity mobilize the stones and sand of the stream, scour-
ing some areas and depositing sediments in others. In the pro-
cess, most stream organisms are destroyed. The three floods 

The number of species of 
macroinvertebrates and 
macroalgae leveled off

of August 1979 eliminated approximately 98% of algal and 
invertebrate biomass in Sycamore Creek. 

 In  63  days  following  these  floods,  Fisher  and  his  col-
leagues observed rapid changes in both the diversity and com-
position  of  algae  and  invertebrates.  Patterns  among  primary 
producers were especially clear. Two days after the floods, the 
majority of the stream bottom consisted of bare sand with some 
patches of diatoms. Five days after the flood, diatoms covered 
about half the streambed. Within 13 to 22 days, diatoms almost 
completely covered the stream bottom. Other algae, especially 
blue-green algae and mats consisting of a mixture of the green 
alga  Cladophora  and blue-green algae, appeared in significant 
quantities by day 35. By day 63, the bottom of Sycamore Creek 
consisted of a patchwork of areas dominated by diatoms, blue-
green  algae,  and  mats  of   Cladophora   and  blue-green  algae. 
The diversity of diatoms and other algae, as measured by H9 
(see chapter 16), leveled off after only 5 days and then began to 
decline after about 50 days ( fig. 20.8 ).     

 Invertebrate  diversity  was  strongly  influenced  by  a  sin-
gle dominant species of crane fly, family Tipulidae,  Crypto-
labis  sp. ( fig. 20.9 ). Large numbers of  Cryptolabis  larvae in 
Sycamore  Creek  depressed  H9  diversity  for  all  collections 
except for the collection on day 35, when most of the popu-
lation  emerged  as  adults.  Throughout  their  collections  over 
the 63-day period of the study, the researchers reported that 
they  collected  38  to  43  species  of  aquatic  invertebrates  out 
of a total of 48 species collected during their studies. In other 
words, most macroinvertebrate species survived the flood.   

 Where  did  these  invertebrate  species  find  refuge  from 
the devastating floods of August 1979? The invertebrate com-
munity  of  Sycamore  Creek  is  dominated  by  insects  whose 
adults are terrestrial. During the floods of August, many adult 
insects  were  in  the  aerial  stage  and  the  flood  passed  under 
them. These aerial adults were the source of most invertebrate 
recolonization of the flood-devastated Sycamore Creek.

 As  we  have  just  seen,  ecological  succession  involves 
predictable changes in community structure. Succession also 
leads to predictable changes in ecosystem structure and func-
tion. These ecosystem changes with succession are the subject 
of the next section.

secondary forest succession in the Southeastern United 
States occur at such different rates (compare  figs. 20.2

   Ecosystem changes during succession include increases in 
biomass,  primary  production,  respiration,  and  nutrient 
retention.   As succession changes the diversity and compo-
sition of communities, ecosystem properties change as well. 
In the last section, we saw how plant and animal community 
structure changes during primary and secondary succession. 
In  this  section,  we  review  evidence  that  many  ecosystem 
properties also change during succession. For instance, many 
properties  of  soils,  such  as  the  nutrient  and  organic  matter 
content, change during the course of succession.  

 figure 20.11  shows, the organic content, moisture, and nitro-
gen concentrations of the soil all increased substantially. Over 
the  same  successional  sequence,  soil  bulk  density,  pH,  and 
phosphorus concentration all decreased.     

 We  can  also  see  from  these  ecological  studies  that  the 
physical and biological properties of ecosystems are insepa-
rable.  Organisms  acting  upon  mineral  substrates  contribute 
to the building of soils upon which spruce forests eventually 
grow around Glacier Bay. Soils, in turn, strongly influence the 
kinds of organisms that grow in a place.  

   Ecosystem Changes at Glacier Bay 
 Stuart  Chapin  and  his  colleagues  (1994)  documented  sub-
stantial  changes  in  ecosystem  structure  during  succession 
at  Glacier Bay. They focused on four study areas of approx-
imately  2  km 2   each.  Their  first  site  had  been  deglaciated 
about 5 to 10 years and was in the pioneer stage. Their sec-
ond site had been deglaciated 35 to 45 years and was domi-
nated by a mat of  Dryas.   Dryas  was just beginning to invade 
this site when it was studied by Reiners’ group more than 
20 years earlier. The third site had been deglaciated about 
60 to 70 years and was in the alder,  Alnus,  stage. This site 
was studied by Reiners when it was a young thicket of alder 
and by Cooper when it was in the pioneer stage. The fourth 
site studied by Chapin and his colleagues had been degla-
ciated 200 to 225 years earlier and was a forest of spruce, 
 Picea,  as it was when studied by Reiners and by Cooper. 

 Chapin and his research team measured changes in sev-
eral ecosystem characteristics across these study sites. One of 
the most fundamental characteristics was the quantity of soil. 
Total soil depth and the depth of all major soil horizons all 
show significant increases from the pioneer community to the 
spruce stage ( fig. 20.10 ).   

 Several other ecologically important soil properties also 
changed during succession at the Glacier Bay study sites. As

  Four Million Years of Ecosystem Change 
 The detailed knowledge of ecosystem change that has emerged 
through  studies  at  Glacier  Bay, Alaska,  is  impressive.  How-
ever,  the  sequence  of  ages  represented  by  the  study  sites  at 
Glacier  Bay,  what  ecologists  call  a      chronosequence    ,   is  lim-
ited. In 1794, when Captain George Vancouver encountered a 
wall of ice at the mouth of Glacier Bay, the island of Kauai in 
the Hawaiian Island chain supported forest ecosystems grow-
ing on soils that had developed on lava flows that were over 
4  million  years  old. The  Hawaiian  Islands  have  formed  over 
a  hot  spot  on  the  Pacific  tectonic  plate  and  have  been  trans-
ported on that plate to the northwest, forming a chain of islands 
that vary greatly in age. The youngest island in the group is the 
big island of Hawaii, which is currently growing over the hot 
spot. The big island is made up of volcanic rocks that vary from 
fresh lava flows to flows that are approximately 150,000 years 
old. Meanwhile, the islands to the northwest are sequentially 
older. As in Glacier Bay, teams of ecologists have probed the 
chronosequence represented by the Hawaiian Island chain for 
information  on  ecosystem  development.  However,  in  Hawaii 
the chronosequence spans not hundreds of years but millions. 
 Lars Hedin, Peter Vitousek, and Pamela Matson (2003) 
examined  nutrient  distributions  and  losses  on  a  chronose-
quence of forest ecosystems on the islands of Hawaii, Molo-
kai,  and  Kauai.  The  youngest  ecosystems,  which  were  on 
Hawaii,  had  developed  on  basaltic  lava  flows  that  were 
300;  2,100;  20,000;  and  150,000  years  old. The  study  site 
on  Molokai  had  developed  on  rocks  that  were  1.4  million 
years old and the oldest study site, which was on Kauai, was 
4.1  million  years  old.  All  sites  currently  have  an  average 
annual  temperature  of  about  16 8 C  and  receive  approxi-
mately  2,500  mm  of  precipitation  annually.  They  also  all 
support  forest  communities  dominated  by  the  native  tree, 
 Metrosideros polymorpha.  

 Over the chronosequence represented by their six study 
sites,  Hedin,  Vitousek,  and  Matson  encountered  significant 
changes in a wide range of soil features. Earlier studies had 
demonstrated  that  primary  production  in  the  Hawaiian  for-
est ecosystems is limited by nitrogen early in succession and

is  absent  from  fresh  lava,  increased  in  soils  over  the  first 
150,000 years of the chronosequence ( fig. 20.12 ). As we saw, 
analogous increases in soil organic matter also occur over the 
course of succession at Glacier Bay (see  fig. 20.11 ). However, 
in  the  Hawaiian  chronosequence,  organic  matter  was  lower 
at  the  1.4  and  4.1  million-year-old  sites.   Figure  20.12   also

shows that changes in soil nitrogen content followed almost 
precisely the pattern exhibited by soil organic matter.   

 The pattern of change in the total phosphorus content of 
soils was remarkably different ( fig. 20.13 ). The total amount 
of phosphorus in soils showed no obvious pattern of change 
with  site  age.  However,  the  forms  of  phosphorus  changed 
substantially  over  the  chronosequence. Weatherable  mineral 
phosphorus  was  largely  depleted  by  20,000  years.  Mean-
while, the percentage of soil phosphorus in refractory forms, 
which are not readily available to plants, increased, varying 
from 68% to 80% of total phosphorus across ecosystems that 
had  developed  on  lava  flows  20,000  years  old  or  older.  On 
these older soils, primary production is limited by phosphorus 
availability.     

 Hedin, Vitousek, and Matson found changes in rates of 
nutrient loss across the chronosequence. Over the course of 
4  million  years  of  ecosystem  development,  these  tropical 
forest  ecosystems  show  progressively  higher  rates  of  nitro-
gen loss but decreased rates of phosphorus loss ( fig. 20.14 ). 
In other words, for approximately 2,000 years these ecosys-
tems  are  highly  retentive  of  nitrogen,  but  as  nitrogen  con-
tent increases in their soils, they begin to lose nitrogen at a 
higher rate. Most losses are due to leaching to groundwater. 
In contrast, as phosphorus becomes progressively less avail-
able, and eventually limiting to primary production, in these

ecosystems,  they  become  more  retentive  of  phosphorus. As 
we shall see in the next example, intact vegetative cover may 
play a key role in nutrient retention in forest ecosystems.    

  Recovery of Nutrient Retention 
Following Disturbance 
 In chapter 19, we saw how felling trees in the Hubbard Brook 
Experimental Forest substantially increased nutrient losses. Let’s 
look again at this experiment by Bormann and Likens (1981) to 
see what it showed about succession and nutrient retention. 

 Briefly,  Bormann  and  Likens  monitored  a  control  and 
an  experimental  stream  catchment  for  3  years  prior  to  their 
experimental  treatment.  They  then  cut  the  forest  on  their 
experimental catchment and suppressed regrowth of vegeta-
tion with herbicides for 3 years (Likens et al. 1978). By sup-
pressing vegetative growth, they delayed succession. 

 When  herbicide  applications  were  stopped,  succes-
sion  proceeded  and  nutrient  losses  by  the  forest  ecosystem 
decreased  dramatically. As  you  can  see  in   figure  20.15 ,  the 
herbicide  suppressed  vegetative  growth  on  the  experimental 
catchment for at least 3 consecutive years. It was during this 
period that the experimental catchment lost large quantities of 
nutrients, including calcium, potassium, and nitrate.   

 When  herbicide  applications  stopped  in  1969,  Likens’s 
group  observed  simultaneous  increases  in  primary  produc-
tion and decreases in nutrient loss. However, the researchers 
point out that uptake by vegetation cannot account completely 
for  reduced  nutrient  loss  and  that  losses  of  calcium,  potas-
sium, and nitrate all peaked during the time when herbicide 
was still being applied. They suggest that some of the reduced 
losses during this period can be attributed to reduced amounts 
of  these  nutrients  in  the  ecosystem.  In  other  words,  nutri-
ent  losses  were  reducing  nutrient  pools.  However,  vegeta-
tive  uptake  is  clearly  implicated  since  once  succession  was 
allowed to occur, nutrient losses from the experimental catch-
ment  declined  rapidly.  Though  losses  of  nitrate  returned  to 
predisturbance levels within 4 years, calcium and potassium 
losses  remained  elevated  above  predisturbance  levels  even 
after 7 years of forest succession. 

  A Model of Ecosystem Recovery 
 As a result of their observations on the Hubbard Brook Experi-
mental Forest, Bormann and Likens proposed a model for recov-
ery of ecosystems from disturbance ( fig. 20.16 ). Their “biomass 
accumulation model” divides the recovery of a forest ecosystem 
from disturbance into four phases: (1) a reorganization phase of 
10 to 20 years, during which the forest loses biomass and nutri-
ents, despite accumulation of living biomass; (2) an aggradation 
phase of more than a century, when the ecosystem accumulates 
biomass,  eventually  reaching  peak  biomass;  (3)  a  transition 
phase, during which biomass declines somewhat from the peak 
reached  during  the  aggradation  phase;  and  (4)  a  steady  state 
phase, when biomass fluctuates around a mean level.     

 How well does the biomass accumulation model repre-
sent the process of forest succession? Does a similar sequence 
of stages occur during succession in other ecosystems? For

instance,  do  ecosystems  eventually  reach  a  steady  state? 
The  generality  of  the  biomass  accumulation  model  can  be 
tested on ecosystems, such as Sycamore Creek, Arizona, that 
undergo rapid succession. Such ecosystems give the ecologist 
the chance to study multiple successional sequences. As we 
will see in the following example, the patterns of ecosystem 
change  during  succession  on  Sycamore  Creek  suggest  that 
several ecosystem features eventually reach a steady state.   

  Succession and Stream Ecosystem Properties 
 Patterns similar to those proposed by the biomass accumula-
tion model were recorded by Fisher’s research group during 
just 63 days of postflood succession in Sycamore Creek, Ari-
zona. Algal  biomass  increased  rapidly  for  the  first  13  days 
following disturbance and then increased more slowly from 
day 13 to day 63 ( fig. 20.17 ). Sixty-three days after the flood, 
algal biomass showed clear signs of leveling off. The biomass 
of invertebrates, the chief animal group in Sycamore Creek, 
increased  rapidly  for  22  days  following  the  flood  and  then, 
like the algal portion of the ecosystem, began to level off.   

 Ecosystem  metabolic  parameters  showed  even  clearer 
signs  of  leveling  off  before  the  end  of  the  63-day  study 
( fig. 20.18 ). Gross primary production (see chapter 18), mea-
sured  as  grams  of  O 2   produced  per  square  meter  per  day, 
increased  very  rapidly  until  day  13,  increased  more  slowly 
between days 13 and 48, and then leveled off between days 48 
and 63. Total ecosystem respiration, measured as oxygen con-
sumption per square meter per day, increased quickly for only 
5 days after the flood and then began to level off. Respiration 
by  invertebrates,  which  at  its  maximum  represented  about 
20% of total ecosystem respiration, leveled off by day 63.   

 Nancy Grimm (1987) studied nitrogen dynamics in Syca-
more Creek following floods that occurred from 1981 to 1983.

 Ecosystem processes during succession in  Sycamore 

As in the earlier studies by Fisher and his colleagues (1982), 
Grimm found that during succession, algal biomass and whole 
ecosystem metabolism quickly reached a maximum and then 
leveled off, as did the quantity of nitrogen in the system. 

 In addition, however, Grimm examined patterns of nitro-
gen  retention  during  stream  succession.  She  estimated  the 
nitrogen  budget  in  each  of  her  study  reaches  by  comparing 
the nitrogen inputs at the upstream end to nitrogen outputs at the 
downstream end. Each 60 to 120 m study reach began where 
subsurface  flows  upwelled  to  the  surface  and  ended  down-
stream, where water disappeared into the sand. Grimm used the 
ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen entering the study reach in 
the upwelling zone to the amount leaving at the lower end as a 
measure of nitrogen retention by the stream ecosystem. 

  Figure 20.19  shows that in the early stages of succession, 
approximately equal amounts of dissolved inorganic nitrogen 
entered and left Grimm’s study reaches. The level of retention 
increased  rapidly  during  succession,  leveling  off  at  nearly 
200  mg  N  per  square  meter  per  day,  about  28  days  after  a 
flood.  In  other  words,  the  study  reach  was  accumulating 
200 mg N per square meter per day. Then, between 28 days 
and 90 days after the flood, the study reach showed progres-
sively lower retention until it eventually exported more dis-
solved inorganic nitrogen than came in with groundwater.       

 The  results  of  Grimm’s  study  raise  several  questions. 
First, what mechanisms underlie retention? Grimm attributes 
most retention by the Sycamore Creek ecosystem to uptake 
by algae and invertebrates, since levels of nitrogen retention 
are consistent with the rates at which nitrogen was accumu-
lated by algal and animal populations. What causes the stream 
reaches to eventually export nitrogen? Grimm suggested that 
at 90 days postflood, her study sites may have stopped accu-
mulating biomass or may have even begun to lose biomass.

 The  major  point  here  is  that  succession,  which  produces 
changes  in  species  composition  and  species  diversity,  also 
changes the structure and function of ecosystems ranging from 
forests to streams. However, we are left with a major question 
concerning this important ecological process. What mechanisms 
drive  succession?  Ecologists  have  proposed  that  the  mecha-
nisms underlying succession may fall into one of three catego-
ries. Those mechanisms are the subject of the next section. 

  Concept 20.2 Review 

1.   Why are the changes in soil properties during the course 
of succession documented by Stuart Chapin and his col-
leagues ecologically significant?  

2.   What would equal levels of nitrogen input and output in 
the stream reaches (sections) studied by Nancy Grimm 
indicate?  

3.   How are the biomass accumulation model of Bormann 
and Likens (see  fig. 20.16 ) and Grimm’s observations 
of  changes  in  nitrogen  retention  during  succession  in 
Sycamore Creek similar?       

  20.3  Mechanisms of Succession
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 20.11  Describe the mechanisms involved in facilitation, 
tolerance, and inhibition models of successional 
change.

 20.12  Discuss experiments that revealed the existence 

of inhibition and facilitation during succession in 
marine intertidal communities.

 20.13  Describe the roles of inhibition and facilitation dur-

ing forest succession.

 20.14  Explain how inhibition and facilitation can operate 

simultaneously during succession at Glacier Bay, 
Alaska. 

   Mechanisms that drive ecological succession include facil-
itation, tolerance, and inhibition.   An early model for suc-
cessional  change  proposed  by  Frederic  E.  Clements  (1916) 
emphasized the role of facilitation as a driver of ecological 
succession. Later, Joseph Connell and Ralph Slatyer (1977) 
proposed  three  alternative  models  of  succession:  (1)  facili-
tation,  (2)  tolerance,  and  (3)  inhibition.  This  classic  paper 
stimulated ecologists to think beyond facilitation and to also 
consider tolerance and inhibition as mechanisms underlying 
successional change ( fig. 20.20 ).        

  Facilitation 
 The     facilitation  model     proposes  that  many  species  may 
attempt  to  colonize  newly  available  space  but  only  certain 
species, with particular characteristics, are able to establish 
themselves. These species, capable of colonizing new sites, 
are  called  pioneer  species.  According  to  the  facilitation 
model, pioneer species modify the environment in such a way 
that it becomes less suitable for themselves and more suitable 
for species characteristic of later successional stages. In other 
words, these early successional species “facilitate” coloniza-
tion  by  later  successional  species.  Early  successional  spe-
cies disappear as they make the environment less suitable for 
themselves and more suitable for other species. Replacement 
of  early  successional  species  by  later  successional  species 
continues in this way until resident species no longer facili-
tate colonization by other species. This final stage in a chain 
of facilitations and replacements is the climax community.   

  Tolerance 
 According to the    tolerance model    ,  the initial stages of colo-
nization are not limited to a few pioneer species. Juveniles of 
species dominating at climax can be present from the earli-
est stages of succession. Second, species colonizing early in 
succession  do  not  facilitate  colonization  by  species  charac-
teristic of later successional stages. They do not modify the 
environment  in  a  way  that  makes  it  more  suitable  for  later 
successional  species.  Later  successional  species  are  simply 
those tolerant of environmental conditions occurring later in 
succession.  The  climax  community  is  established  when  the 
list of tolerant species has been exhausted.  

  Inhibition 
 Like the tolerance model, the    inhibition model    assumes that 
any  species  that  can  survive  in  an  area  as  an  adult  can  colo-
nize the area during the early stages of succession. However, 
the  inhibition  model  proposes  that  the  early  occupants  of  an 
area modify the environment in a way that makes the area less

suitable  for  both  early  and  late  successional  species.  Simply, 
early arrivals inhibit colonization by later arrivals. Later succes-
sional species can only invade an area if space is opened up by 
disturbance of early colonists. In this case, succession culmi-
nates in a community made up of long-lived, resistant species. 
The  inhibition  model  assumes  that  late  successional  species 
come to dominate an area simply because they live a long time 
and resist damage by physical and biological factors. 

 Which of these models does the weight of evidence from 
nature  support? As  you  will  see  in  the  following  examples, 
most studies of succession support the facilitation model, the 
inhibition model, or some combination of the two.  

  Successional Mechanisms 
in the Rocky Intertidal Zone 
 What mechanisms drive succession by algae and barnacles in 
the intertidal boulder fields studied by Sousa (see  fig. 20.7 )? 
The  alternative  mechanisms  proposed  by  Sousa  were  those 
of  Connell  and  Slatyer:  facilitation,  tolerance,  and  inhibi-
tion. Sousa used a series of experiments to test for the occur-
rence of these alternative mechanisms. He conducted his first 
experiments on 25 cm 2  plots on concrete blocks placed in the 

intertidal zone. In this experiment, Sousa explored the influ-
ence of  Ulva  on recruitment by later successional red algae by 
keeping  Ulva  out of four experimental plots and leaving four 
other control plots undisturbed. This experiment showed that 
 Ulva  strongly inhibits recruitment by red algae ( fig. 20.21 ).     

Removing Ulva increased 
colonization by the late- 
successional alga, Gigartina.

Low colonization by 
Gigartina suggests 
that Ulva inhibited 
colonization of 
control plots.

Section V 

  Communities and Ecosystems

 In a second set of experiments, Sousa studied the effects 
of  the  middle  successional  species   Gigartina  leptorhyn-
chos  and  Gelidium  on establishment of the late successional 
 Gigartina canaliculata.  He selectively removed middle suc-
cessional species from a set of four experimental plots while 
simultaneously monitoring another set of four control plots. 
These experiments were conducted in 100 cm 2  areas on natural 
substrate, dominated by either  G. leptorhynchos  or   Gelidium.  
When Sousa removed these middle successional species, the 
experimental plots were quickly reinvaded by  Ulva  and even-
tually by significantly higher densities of  G. canaliculata,  the 
late  successional  species.  The  effects  of  these  successional 
algae support the inhibition model for succession. 

 The inhibition model of succession proposes that early 
successional  species  are  more  vulnerable  to  a  variety  of 
physical and biological factors that cause mortality. If algal 
succession in the intertidal boulder fields studied by Sousa 
follows the inhibition model, then early successional species 
should be more vulnerable to various sources of mortality. 

 Sousa  addressed  the  question  of  relative  vulnerability 
of algal species with several experiments. In one, he studied 
the relative vulnerability of intertidal algae to physical stress, 
especially exposure to air, intense sunlight, and drying wind. 
He studied the vulnerabilities of the five dominant algal spe-
cies in his study area by tagging 30 individuals of each  species 
and  monitoring  their  survivorship  for  2  months  during  a 
period when low tide occurred during the afternoon, when air 
temperatures are highest. The results of this study show that 
the early successional species,  Ulva,  had lower survivorship 
than the middle or late successional species ( fig. 20.22 ).   

 Sousa  also  designed  several  different  field  and  labora-
tory experiments to explore differential vulnerability to her-
bivores. The results of all these experiments indicated that the 
early successional species  Ulva  is more vulnerable to herbi-
vores  than  are  later  successional  species.  These  results  and 
those of the several other manipulations performed by Sousa 
support the inhibition model of succession. 

 Some studies of intertidal succession, however, have dem-
onstrated facilitation. Teresa Turner (1983) pointed out that the 
bulk of intertidal studies had supported the inhibition model and 
that  the  few  studies  documenting  facilitation  had  shown  that 
facilitation was not obligate. However, she went on to report a 
case of obligate facilitation during intertidal succession. 

 Turner described the successional sequence at her Ore-
gon study site as follows. High waves during winter storms 
create open space in the lower intertidal zone. In May, these 
open  areas  are  colonized  by   Ulva,   the  same  early  colonist 
of  open  areas  in  Sousa’s  study  area,  over  1,000  km  south 
of  Turner’s  study  site.   Ulva   is  eventually  replaced  by  sev-
eral  middle  successional  species,  especially  the  red  algae 
 Rhodomela  larix,  Cryptosiphonia  woodii,   and   Odonthalia 
floccosa.  Through this middle stage, the pattern of succes-
sion appears much as that in the intertidal boulder field stud-
ied by Sousa. However, in the lower intertidal area studied 
by  Turner,  the  dominant  late  successional  species  was  not 
an  alga  but  a  flowering  plant,  the  surfgrass   Phyllospadix 
scouleri.

 Turner proposed that recruitment of  Phyllospadix  by seeds 
depends upon the presence of macroscopic algae. The seeds of 
 Phyllospadix   are  large  and  bear  two  parallel,  barbed  projec-
tions. These projections hook and hold the seeds to attached 
algae. From this attached position, the seed germinates, first 
producing leaves and then roots by which the plant will anchor 
itself to the underlying rock. Once established,  Phyllospadix  
spreads and consolidates space by vegetative growth. 

 Turner  tested  whether  recruitment  by   Phyllospadix   is 
facilitated by attached algae by clearing eight 0.25 m 2  plots 
of all attached algae. She then compared the number of new 
 Phyllospadix   seeds  in  these  plots  with  the  number  in  eight 
nearby control plots. The control plots remained undisturbed 
with their algal populations intact except that all  Phyllospadix  
seeds were removed at the start of the study. Turner’s control 
areas were dominated by the red alga  Rhodomela larix,  a spe-
cies prominent in the middle successional stages in her study 
area and to which  Phyllospadix  seeds attach. 

 Turner  set  up  and  manipulated  her  study  plots  in  Sep-
tember and then checked them the following March, after the 
period of seed dispersal. Over the fall and winter a brown alga, 
 Phaeostrophion  irregulare,   colonized  the  removal  plots  but 
the bladelike form of this species apparently does not allow 
attachment by  Phyllospadix  seeds. When Turner checked the

removal and control plots, she found a total of 48 seeds, 46 
on the control plots (all attached to  Rhodomela ) and 2 on the 
removal  plots  ( fig.  20.23 ).  Both  seeds  on  the  removal  plots 
were attached to two isolated branches of  Rhodomela  that had 
sprouted from remnant holdfasts.     

 During 3 years, Turner systematically searched an area of 
about 200 m 2  for  Phyllospadix  seeds and found a total of 298. All 
were attached to algae. These data support the hypothesis that 
middle  successional  algae  facilitate  recruitment  and  establish-
ment of  Phyllospadix  and that this facilitation is obligate. As a 
consequence of Turner’s study and others, we can say that facili-
tation  and  inhibition  occur  during  intertidal  succession.  Other 
research, which we review in the next example, has shown that 
facilitation and inhibition also occur during forest succession.  

  Successional Mechanisms in Forests 
 We now turn from succession in the marine intertidal zone, 
a place where succession occurs in a matter of a few years, 
to succession in temperate forests. Temperate forest succes-
sion  takes  hundreds  of  years  to  complete  and  so  cannot  be 
observed directly within the period of a typical research proj-
ect. Therefore, most research on the mechanisms driving suc-
cession in temperate forests has focused on the earliest stages. 

  Mechanisms in Old Field Succession 
 Catherine  Keever  (1950)  studied  succession  on  old  fields 
of the Piedmont Plateau of North Carolina. She conducted 
some of the earliest experiments on the mechanisms regu-
lating the early stages of succession in temperate forests. As 
we saw earlier in this chapter, the first species to colonize 
and dominate abandoned fields is generally crabgrass,  Digi-
taria  sanguinalis.    Digitaria   is  usually  followed  by  horse-
weed,   Erigeron  canadense.   During  the  second  year  of 
 succession, many fields are dominated by aster,  Aster pilo-
sis.  A few years later the fields are covered by broomsedge, 
 Andropogon  virginicus.   The  objective  of  Keever’s  study 

Chapter 20 

  Succession and Stability 

449

was to determine the causes of this early pattern of species 
replacements. 

 Keever’s experiments showed that  Erigeron  inhibits the 
growth of  Aster  and so the replacement of  Erigeron  by  Aster  
follows the inhibition model. However,  Aster  stimulates the 
growth of its successor,  Andropogon,  so this second species 
replacement  follows  the  facilitation  model. Therefore,  early 
succession on the Piedmont Plateau of eastern North Amer-
ica appears to involve a mixture of mechanisms. As the fol-
lowing  example  shows,  a  complex  mixture  of  mechanisms 
is  also  involved  in  primary  succession  of  forests  on  glacial 
substrates.  

  Mechanisms of Primary Succession 
Following Deglaciation 
 The complex mechanisms underlying succession were well 
demonstrated  by  the  detailed  studies  of  Chapin’s  research 
team  (1994).  They  combined  field  observations,  field 
experiments,  and  greenhouse  experiments  to  explore  the 
mechanisms underlying primary succession at Glacier Bay, 
Alaska.  They  found  that  no  single  factor  or  mechanism 
determines  the  pattern  of  primary  succession  at  Glacier 
Bay, Alaska. 

  Figure 20.24  summarizes the complex influences of four 
successional  stages  on  establishment  and  growth  of  spruce 
seedlings. During the pioneer stage, there is some inhibition 
of  spruce  germination.  Any  spruce  seedlings  that  become 
established, however, have high survivorship but low growth 
rates. Spruce seedling growth rates and nitrogen supplies are 
increased  somewhat  during  the   Dryas   stage.  However,  this 
facilitation  during  the   Dryas   stage  is  offset  by  poor  germi-
nation and survivorship, along with increased seed predation 
and mortality.   

 Strong facilitation of spruce seedlings first occurs in the 
alder stage. During this stage, germination and survivorship 
remain  low  and  seed  mortality,  root  competition,  and  light 
competition are significant. However, these inhibitory effects 
are offset by increased soil organic matter, nitrogen, mycor-
rhizal  activity,  and  growth  rates.  The  net  effect  of  alder  on 
spruce seedlings is facilitation. 

 In the spruce stage, the net influence on spruce seedlings 
is inhibitory. Germination is high during the spruce stage but 
this is counterbalanced by several inhibitory effects. Growth 
rates  and  survivorship  are  low  and  nitrogen  availability  is 
reduced. In addition, seed predation and mortality, root com-
petition, and light competition are all high. 

 These results remind us that nature is far more complex 
and subtle than models such as that proposed by Connell and 
Slatyer. However, the Connell and Slatyer model challenged 
ecologists to think more broadly about succession and to go 
out and conduct field tests of alternative successional mecha-
nisms.  Their  response  produced  today’s  improved  under-
standing of the process of ecological succession. 

 In this and the previous two sections, we have discussed 
community and ecosystem changes and the mechanisms pro-
ducing those changes. In the next section, we consider a com-
panion topic: community and ecosystem stability.

Stability

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 20.15  Define the concepts of stability, resistance, and resil-

ience as applied to ecological communities.

 20.16  Describe how altering the fertilizer mix in the Park 
Grass Experiment changed community composition.

 20.17  Discuss how the Park Grass Experiment indicated 

relative stability in community composition over time.
 20.18  Explain how level of taxonomic resolution (plant growth 

forms versus individual species) influences perception 
of community stability in the Park Grass Experiment.
 20.19  Discuss how geologic features affect community 

resilience in Sycamore Creek. 

   Community stability may be due to lack of disturbance or 
community resistance or resilience in the face of disturbance.    

 The simplest definition of    stability    is the absence of change. 
A community or ecosystem may be stable for a variety of rea-
sons. One reason may be that there has been no disturbance. 
For  instance,  the  benthic  communities  of  the  deep  sea  may 
remain  stable  over  long  periods  of  time  because  of  constant 
physical  conditions.  The  type  of  stability  resulting  from  an 
absence of disturbance, if it exists, is not particularly interest-
ing to ecologists. 

 Ecologists are more interested in how communities and 
ecosystems may remain stable even when exposed to potential 
disturbance. Consequently, ecologists generally define stabil-
ity as the persistence of a community or ecosystem in the face 
of  disturbance.  Stability  may  result  from  two  very  different 
characteristics.     Resistance     is  the  ability  of  a  community  or 
ecosystem to maintain structure and/or function in the face of 
potential disturbance. However, stability may also result from 
the ability of a community to return to its original structure 
after  a  disturbance.  The  ability  to  bounce  back  after  distur-
bance is called     resilience    .  A resilient community or ecosys-
tem may be completely disrupted by disturbance but quickly 
return to its former state. 

 Ecologists ask many questions about stability. Are some 
communities  and  ecosystems  more  resistant  than  others? 
What  factors  determine  differences  in  resistance  among 
communities  and  ecosystems?  Are  some  ecosystems  and 
communities  more  resilient  than  others?  What  factors 
determine  the  rate  of  recovery  of  community  structure 
and ecosystem processes following disturbance? However, 
few  studies  have  been  conducted  at  scales  appropriate  to 
address these questions. One of the main problems faced by 
ecologists interested in community and ecosystem stability 
is the need to conduct detailed studies over a long period 
of time. There are a few studies that meet this requirement; 
one of them is the Park Grass Experiment.

  Lessons from the Park 
Grass Experiment 
 The Park Grass Experiment is the prototype of all long-term 
experimental studies in ecology. It was started at the Rotham-
sted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire, England, between 
1856 and 1872. The purpose of the experiment was to study 
the  effects  of  several  fertilizer  treatments  on  the  yield  and 
structure of a hay meadow community. Because the Park Grass 
Experiment has continued without interruption for one and a 
half centuries, it provides one of the most valuable records of 
long-term  community  dynamics. That  record  provides  some 
unique insights into the nature of community stability. 

 Jonathan  Silvertown  (1987)  used  data  from  the  Park 
Grass Experiment to respond to the suggestion that existing 
studies  do  not  conclusively  demonstrate  that  any  ecological 
community  is  stable.  Silvertown  pointed  out  that  the  Park 
Grass Experiment is one of the few studies of terrestrial com-
munities  that  have  been  carried  out  in  sufficient  detail  and 
over sufficient time to provide a test of stability. 

 The composition of the plant community at the Park Grass 
Experiment  has  been  monitored  since  1862.  This  record 
reveals at least one level of stability. Over this period, virtu-
ally no new species have colonized the meadow. Changes in 
the community have occurred as a consequence of increases 
or decreases in species already present in the meadow at the 
beginning of the experiment. 

 Silvertown  used  variation  in  community  composition 
as a measure of stability. He represented composition as the 
proportion of the community consisting of grasses, legumes, 
or other species. The analysis of composition was restricted 
to the period from 1910 to 1948 to avoid the early period of 
the experiment when the meadow community was adjusting 
to  the  various  fertilizer  treatments.   Figure  20.25   shows  the 
relative proportions of grasses, legumes, and other plants on 
plots receiving three different treatments: plot 3, no fertilizer; 
plot 7, P, K, Na, and Mg; and plot 14, N, P, K, Na, and Mg. 
The differences in vegetation on the three plots were mostly 
produced by the different fertilizer treatments and developed 
early in the Park Grass Experiment.     

 The proportion of grasses, legumes, and other plants in 
the study plots varied from year to year, mainly in response 
to  variation  in  precipitation.  Despite  this  annual  variation, 
 figure  20.25   indicates  that  the  proportions  of  three  plant 
groups remained remarkably similar over the interval of the 
study. A quantitative analysis of trends in biomass revealed 
no  significant  changes  in  the  biomass  of  the  three  plant 
groups  in  plots  3  and  7  and  only  a  minor,  but  statistically 
significant,  decrease  in  the  biomass  of  grasses  on  plot  14. 
In  other  words,  the  data  presented  in   figure  20.25   show 
remarkable  stability  in  the  proportion  of  grasses,  legumes, 
and other species. 

 Does the stability of Silvertown’s three major groups of 
plants  in  the  Park  Grass  Experiment  hold  up  if  we  examine 
community structure at the species level? It turns out that while 
the proportions of grasses, legumes, and other species remained 
fairly  constant,  populations  of  individual   species  changed 

substantially. Mike Dodd and his colleagues (1995) used cen-
sus data from 1920 to 1979 to examine plant population trends. 
The result of their analysis showed that some species increased 
in abundance, some decreased, some showed no trend, while 
others increased and then decreased ( fig. 20.26 ).     

 The  contrasting  results  obtained  by  Silvertown  and  by 
Dodd’s project suggest that whether a community or ecosys-
tem  appears  stable  may  depend  upon  how  we  view  it. At  a 
very  coarse  level  of  resolution,  the  Park  Grass  community 
has remained absolutely stable. It was a meadow community 
when the Park Grass Experiment began in 1856 and it remains 
so today. When Silvertown increased the resolution to distin-
guish between grasses, legumes, and other species, the com-
munity again appeared stable. However, when Dodd and his 
colleagues increased the resolution still further and examined 
trends in the abundances of individual species, the Park Grass 
community no longer appeared stable. 

 Are there stable natural communities? The answer to this 
question may depend upon how you make your measurements. 
The ecologist interested in addressing any question concerning 
community stability is faced with several practical problems. 
Generally,  an  adequate  study  requires  a  great  deal  of  time, 
which limits the possibility of replication. One solution to this 
problem is to study communities and ecosystems, such as Syc-
amore Creek, Arizona, that undergo more frequent disturbance 
and  show  relatively  rapid  recovery.  These  systems  offer  the 
opportunity to compare recoveries from multiple disturbances.  

  Replicate Disturbances 
and Desert Stream Stability 
 Numerous  studies  of  disturbance  and  recovery  in  Sycamore 
Creek,  Arizona,  have  produced  a  highly  detailed  picture  of 
community, ecosystem, and population responses. This detailed 
picture  suggests  that  ecologists  have  just  begun  to  probe  the 
subtleties of ecological stability. For instance, one study shows 
that resistance in the spatial structure of the  Sycamore Creek 
ecosystem underlies spatial variation in ecosystem resilience. 
Maury Valett and his colleagues (1994) studied the interactions 
between surface and subsurface waters in Sycamore Creek in 
order  to  study  the  influence  of  these  linkages  on  ecosystem 
resilience. They tested the hypothesis that ecosystem resilience 
is higher where hydrologic linkages between the surface and 
subsurface  water  increase  the  supply  of  nitrogen.  They  pro-
posed a controlling role for nitrogen because it is the nutrient 
that limits primary production in Sycamore Creek. 

 Valett  and  his  colleagues  intensely  studied  two  stream 
sections at middle elevations in the 500 km 2  Sycamore Creek 
catchment. They measured the flow of water between the sur-
face and subsurface along these reaches with devices called 
 piezometers.   Piezometers  can  be  used  to  measure  the  verti-
cal hydraulic gradient, which indicates the direction of flow 
between  surface  water  and  water  flowing  through  the  sedi-
ments  of  a  streambed.  Positive  vertical  hydraulic  gradients 
indicate flow from the streambed to the surface in areas called 
upwelling  zones.  Negative  vertical  hydraulic  gradients  indi-
cate flow from the surface to the streambed, which occurs in

downwelling zones. Zero vertical hydraulic gradients indicate 
no  net  exchange  between  surface  waters  and  water  flowing 
within the sediments. Areas with zero vertical hydraulic gra-
dients are called stationary zones. 

 Valett  and  his  colleagues  measured  vertical  hydraulic 
gradient  along  the  lengths  of  both  study  sections,  produc-
ing hydrologic maps for both. The upper end of each study 
reach was an upwelling zone. The middle reaches were sta-
tionary zones and the lower reaches were downwelling zones. 

  Figure 20.27  shows the distributions of these zones across one 
of the study reaches.   

 The concentration of nitrate in surface water in the two 
study reaches varies directly with vertical hydraulic gradient 
( fig.  20.28 ).  Upwelling  zones,  which  are  fed  by  nitrate-rich 
waters upwelling from the sediments, have the highest con-
centrations of nitrate. Nitrate concentrations gradually decline 
with distance downstream through the stationary and down-
welling zones.

upwelling zones is so much higher than in downwelling zones, 
they concluded that the rate of ecosystem recovery is higher 
in upwelling zones. This pattern supports their hypothesis that 
algal communities in upwelling zones are more resilient.   

 The  team  also  found  that  while  flash  floods  devastated 
the  biotic  community,  the  spatial  arrangement  of  upwell-
ing,  stationary,  and  downwelling  zones  remained  stable.  In 
other words, this aspect of the spatial structure of the Syca-
more  Creek  ecosystem  is  highly  resistant  to  flash  flooding. 
The location of upwelling, stationary, and downwelling zones 
remained stable after numerous intense floods. 

 The spatial stability of the Sycamore Creek ecosystem in 
the face of potential disturbance is an example of ecosystem 
resistance. However, what is the source of this stable spatial 
structure?  This  spatial  stability  can  be  explained  by  consid-
ering  geomorphology,  especially  the  distribution  of  bedrock. 
Subsurface water is forced to the surface in areas where bed-
rock lies close to the surface. Upwelling zones in Sycamore 
Creek are located in such areas, and since flooding does not 
move  bedrock,  the  locations  of  upwelling  zones  are  stable. 
Therefore, this aspect of ecosystem stability is controlled by 
landscape  structure.  Consequently,  the  ecologist  trying  to 
understand  the  organization  and  dynamics  of  the  Sycamore 
Creek ecosystem must consider the structure of the surround-
ing landscape. Landscape ecology is the subject of chapter 21.

  Concept 20.4 Review 

 The higher concentrations of nitrate in the upper reaches 
of each study section are associated with higher algal produc-
tion.   Figure  20.29   indicates  that  algal  biomass  accumulates 
at a higher rate in upwelling zones compared to downwelling 
zones.  Valett  and  his  colleagues  used  rate  of  algal  biomass 
accumulation  as  a  measure  of  rate  of  recovery  from  distur-
bance. Because the rate at which algal biomass accumulates in

Investigating the Evidence  20

 Variation Around the Median 

 LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 20.20  Define the interquartile range for a set of samples 

from which a median has been determined.

 20.21  Calculate an interquartile range for a set of samples 

of a population.

 20.22  Describe the circumstance in which it is appropriate 
to use a median and interquartile range to represent 
a population sample instead of a mean and variance.

The question we consider now is how to represent variation in 
samples  drawn  from  populations  in  which  measurements  or 
observations do not have normal distributions. When analyz-
ing normally distributed measurements, depending on our pur-
pose, we can estimate and represent variation using the range, 
variance,  standard  deviation,  standard  error,  or  95%  confi-
dence interval. However, most of these indices of variation are 
not appropriate for non-normal distributions. 

 To help us consider how to represent variation when ana-
lyzing non-normal distributions, let’s return to a sample of may-
fly nymphs that we considered in Investigating the Evidence 3 
of chapter 3 ( table 1 ). Suppose you are studying the recovery 
of this population following disturbance by a flash flood. The 
sample was taken from the south fork of Tesuque Creek, New 
Mexico, a high mountain stream of the southern Rocky Moun-
tains. This fork had flooded 1 year before the sample was taken.

 In  Investigating  the  Evidence  3,  we  determined  the  median 
density of  B. bicaudatus  in the disturbed fork ( table 1 ) as:
Sample median 5 4 1 5 5 4.5 B. bicaudatus per 0.1 m2 quadrat

    The median density of  B. bicaudatus  in the undisturbed fork 
( table 2 ) is:               

Sample median 5 38 1 42

              5 40 B. bicaudatus per 0.1 m2 quadrat

 The  median  indicates  that  the  density  of   B.  bicaudatus   is 
10 times higher in the undisturbed fork. Now, how can we repre-
sent the variation around these medians? One common method 
to represent variation in cases such as these is to divide the sam-
ples into four equal parts, called quartiles, and use the range of 
measurements between the upper bound of the lowest quartile 
and  the  lower  bound  of  the  highest  quartile.  This  representa-
tion of variation in a sample is called the    interquartile range    .

The massive impacts of human activity on earth’s ecosystems 
(see fig. 16.22, p. 368) present us with pressing challenges. 
One  is  to  conserve  the  surviving  biodiversity  of  the  planet. 
The  second  challenge  is  to  restore  damaged  ecosystems  to 
acceptable levels of biodiversity, physical structure, and eco-
system functioning, a process called ecological  restoration. 
A specialized area within the science of ecology, restoration 
ecology,  focuses  on  exploring  ways  to  improve  the  effec-
tiveness  of  ecological  restoration  by  providing  a  conceptual 
framework  to  guide  such  work.  The  concepts  derived  from

  Notice that the interquartile range for the undisturbed fork is 
from 32 to 58; for the disturbed fork, the interquartile range is 
2 to 8. Notice that 50% of the quadrat counts in each sample 
fall within this range. The medians and interquartile ranges for 
each of the populations are plotted in  figure 1 , which shows 
that they do not overlap. However, is there a statistically signif-
icant difference in density in the two stream forks? To answer 
that question, we will need a method for comparing samples 
that does not assume a normal distribution. We will make that 
comparison in chapter 21.

studies  of  ecological  succession  have  much  to  contribute  to 
ecological  restoration  (Walker,  Walker,  and  Hobbs  2007). 
Some ecologists have even gone so far as to define ecologi-
cal  restoration  as  “essentially  the  manipulation  of  succes-
sion in order to achieve some predetermined goal” (Walker, 
Velázquez, and Shiels 2009).

Applying Succession Concepts 
to Restoration
As we saw earlier in the chapter, succession involves changes 
occurring over the course of decades to centuries, while eco-
logical  restoration  is  generally  restricted  to  time  scales  of 
years  to  a  few  decades.  Consequently,  the  practitioners  of 

ecological  restoration  attempt  to  accelerate  the  process  of 
succession.  Successional  studies  have  shown  that  a  broad 
range  of  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  factors  influ-
ence  the  process.  Potentially  influential  factors  include  the 
abiotic characteristics of sites, differences in plant dispersal 
rates, ease of plant establishment, interaction between plant 
species, and herbivory. While some of these environmental 
factors facilitate successional change in community and eco-
system  properties,  others  inhibit  change.  Table  20.1  lists  a 
number of factors that affect the timing and course of suc-
cession along with actions that can be taken during restora-
tion to counteract or reinforce their effects. Some results of 
applying these restoration principles are explored in the fol-
lowing case studies.

Restoring Tropical Forest
Tropical forests are increasingly the focus of intense economic 
activity  ranging  from  clearing  for  agriculture  to  mining.  For 
instance,  the  mining  of  bauxite,  an  ore  of  aluminum,  occurs 
mainly in tropical and subtropical regions and can have major 
impacts on these landscapes (fig. 20.30). As a result, there is an 
increasing demand for restoration of these diverse ecosystems. 
A research group in Brazil recently studied restoration of 
tropical forest impacted by bauxite mining in Central Ama-
zonia (Dias et al. 2012). The type of forest the group focused 
on, the igapó, is particularly challenging because of its peri-
odic flooding, which shortens the growing season and limits 
the use of fertilizers that can cause eutrophication of wetlands 
connected to the flooded forest. 

The research group tested whether adding forest floor lit-
ter collected in undisturbed igapó and seeding could increase 
the effectiveness of restoration on bauxite mine tailings. Their 
research  addresses  two  of  the  factors  affecting  succession 
listed in table 20.1: physical and chemical stressors and plant 
dispersal rates. Adding organic matter to the soil surface helps 

 Figure 20.30  
 Bauxite mines, such as this one near Perth,  Australia, 
can remove vegetation from large areas and produce massive tailing piles. 
Ecological restoration is generally needed to stabilize exposed soils and 
tailings to prevent erosion and sedimentation damage to nearby ecosystems. 

to  reduce  soil  drying  and  eventually  adds  organic  matter  to 
the bauxite tailings. Seeding the site with preferred plant spe-
cies augmented natural plant dispersal processes. In addition, 
seeding  provided  the  research  group  with  an  opportunity  to 
ensure that nitrogen-fixing plants would colonize the tailings 
and add nitrogen to the nutrient-poor bauxite tailings in a form 
with  less  chance  of  contributing  to  wetland  eutrophication. 
The  positive  contributions  of  litter  addition  and  seeding  to 
promoting succession on bauxite tailings included faster plant 
growth, greater leaf area, increased plant species richness, and 
higher seedling densities, a result presented in figure 20.31.

Encouraging  dispersal  of  the  many  bird-dispersed  seeds 
in  tropical  forests  can  also  augment  dispersal  of  plants  onto 
tropical forest restoration sites. This was the approach taken by 
Aaron Shiels and Lawrence Walker in their studies of restoration 
of landslides on steep mountain slopes of the Luquillo Experi-
mental Forest in Puerto Rico (Shiels and Walker 2003). They 
augmented the deposition of bird-dispersed seeds onto the land-
slides under study by placing perches, made of tree branches 
from  the  surrounding  forests,  on  some  of  their  study  plots. 
Bird-dispersed  seeds  were  found  only  below  their  introduced 
perches. Control study plots without perches received inputs of 
wind-dispersed seeds only. Consequently, perches increased the 
diversity of seeds on experimental plots (fig. 20.32).

Both litter and seed
additions increased
seeding densities.

Restoring Logging Road Beds
A  dense  network  of  roads  is  one  of  the  common  legacies 
of  timber  harvests  (fig.  20.33).  These  logging  roads  have  a 
number  of  environmental  impacts,  including  heavy  erosion 
and  sedimentation  of  nearby  watercourses.  In  a  2013  study 
of road decommissioning in northern Idaho, Rebecca Lloyd, 
Kathleen Lohse, and Ty Ferré compared the results of simply 
abandoning logging roads and allowing succession to proceed 
with recontouring roads and their surroundings to restore the 
original contours of the site. In their study, the team examined 
both vegetation establishment and changes in soil characteris-
tics on three types of sites: control areas on which a road had 
never been built, abandoned roads, and recontoured roads. 

The team found that recontouring accelerated restoration. 
After just 10 years, the amount of bare ground on recontoured 
sites  had  decreased  to  levels  only  observed  on  abandoned 
roads after 30 years (fig. 20.34). The vegetation on 10-year-old 
recontoured road sites was still very different from that estab-
lished on sites where roads had never been built. However, the 

 Figure 20.33   Logging roads, such as this one in Oregon, which 
create a surface bare of vegetation and a topographic anomaly in the 
landscape, are a significant source of erosion and of sedimentation in

soil properties on recontoured sites were comparable to those 
on the control sites, while dramatically different from those on 
abandoned roads (fig. 20.35). In fact, the 10-year recontoured

and control sites were statistically indistinguishable in regard 
to five properties measured in the O and A soil horizons of the 
study  sites.  In  regard  to  soil  properties  at  least,  recontoured 
sites had been restored to a pre-disturbance condition in just 
10 years. Based on the results of their study, Lloyd, Lohse, and 
Ferré proposed  that simply abandoning logging roads sets them 

off in a successional trajectory that leads to an alternative state 
of structure and ecosystem function. In other words, abandon-
ment will not lead to restoration to ecological conditions com-
parable to those prevailing before disturbance by road building. 
This  is  an  excellent  example  of  how  restoration  ecology  can 
inform the process of ecological restoration practice.       

   Summary 

  Succession  is the change in plant, animal, and microbial com-
munities in an area following disturbance or the creation of 
new substrate.  Primary succession  occurs on newly exposed 
geological  substrates  not  significantly  modified  by  organ-
isms.  Secondary succession  occurs in areas where disturbance 
destroys a community without destroying the soil. Succession 
generally ends with a climax community whose populations 
remain stable until disrupted by disturbance. 

  Community  changes  during  succession  include 
increases  in  species  diversity  and  changes  in  species 
 composition.    Primary forest succession around Glacier Bay 
may require about 1,500 years, while secondary forest succes-
sion  on  the  Piedmont  Plateau  takes  about  150  years.  Mean-
while, succession in the intertidal zone requires 1 to 3 years and 
succession within a desert stream occurs in less than 2 months. 
Despite the great differences in the time required, all these suc-
cessional sequences show increased species diversity over time. 
  Ecosystem changes during succession include increases 
in biomass, primary production, respiration, and nutrient 
retention.     Succession  at  Glacier  Bay  produces  changes  in 
several ecosystem properties, including increased soil depth, 
organic  content,  moisture,  and  nitrogen.  Over  the  same  suc-
cessional  sequence,  several  soil  properties  show  decreases, 
including  soil  bulk  density,  pH,  and  phosphorus  concentra-
tion. During ecosystem development on lava flows in Hawaii, 
organic matter and nitrogen content of soils increased over the 
first 150,000 years and then declined by 1.4 and 4.1 million 
years.  Weatherable  mineral  phosphorus  in  soils  was  largely 
depleted on lava flows 20,000 years old or older. The percent-
age of soil phosphorus in refractory form made up the major-
ity  of  phosphorus  on  lava  flows  20,000  years  old  or  older. 
Nitrogen  losses  from  these  ecosystems  increased  over  time, 
while phosphorus losses decreased. Succession at the Hubbard 

Brook  Experimental  Forest  increased  nutrient  retention  by 
the  forest  ecosystem.  Several  ecosystem  properties  change 
predictably  during  succession  in  Sycamore  Creek,  Arizona, 
including biomass, primary production, respiration, and nitro-
gen retention. 

  Mechanisms  that  drive  ecological  succession  include 
facilitation, tolerance, and inhibition.     Most studies of suc-
cession support the facilitation model, the inhibition model, or 
some combination of the two. Both facilitation and inhibition 
occur during intertidal succession. Facilitation and inhibition 
also occur during secondary and primary forest succession. 

  Community  stability  may  be  due  to  lack  of  distur-
bance  or  community  resistance  or  resilience  in  the  face 
of disturbance.    Ecologists  generally  define  stability  as  the 
persistence of a community or ecosystem in the face of distur-
bance. Resistance is the ability of a community or ecosystem 
to maintain structure and/or function in the face of potential 
disturbance. The  ability  to  bounce  back  after  disturbance  is 
called resilience. A resilient community or ecosystem may be 
completely disrupted by disturbance but quickly returns to its 
former  state.  Studies  of  the  Park  Grass  Experiment  suggest 
that our perception of stability is affected by the scale of mea-
surement. Studies in Sycamore Creek indicate that resilience 
is  sometimes  influenced  by  resource  availability  and  that 
resistance may result from landscape-level phenomena. 

 The  massive  impacts  of  human  activity  on  earth’s  eco-
systems challenge us to restore them to acceptable levels of 
biodiversity,  physical  structure,  and  ecosystem  function-
ing,  a  process  called  ecological  restoration.  Restoration  is 
informed  by  a  specialized  area  of  ecological  studies:  resto-
ration ecology. Ecological restoration draws substantially on 
the concepts of ecological succession to accelerate the pace 
of restoration.

  Review Questions 

     1.  As  we  saw  in   figure  20.5 ,  Johnston  and  Odum  (1956)  docu-
mented substantial change in the richness of bird species in a 
successional sequence going from the earliest stages in which 
the  plant  community  was  dominated  by  grasses  and  forbs  to 
mature oak-hickory forests. Use MacArthur’s (see chapter 16) 
studies (1958, 1961) of foliage height diversity and bird diver-
sity  to  explain  the  patterns  of  diversity  increase  observed  by 
Johnston and Odum.  

    2.  Would you expect the number of species to remain indefinitely 
at the level shown in  figure 20.7 ? Space on large, stable boulders 
in Sousa’s study site is dominated by the algal  G. canaliculata  
and support 2.3 to 3.5 species, not the 5 shown in  figure 20.7 . 
Explain. (Hint: How long did Sousa follow his study boulders?)  
    3.  The  successional  studies  in  Sycamore  Creek  produced  pat-
terns  of  variation  in  diversity  that  differed  significantly  from 
those observed during primary succession at Glacier Bay (see 
 fig.  20.2 ),  old  field  succession  on  the  Piedmont  Plateau 
(see  fig. 20.4 ), or algal and barnacle succession in the intertidal 
zone (see  fig. 20.7 ). The main difference was that Fisher and 
colleagues (1982) observed initial increases in species diversity 
followed  by  declines.  In  contrast,  studies  of  forest  and  inter-
tidal  succession  showed  increases  in  diversity  but  no  obvious 
declines. What  may  have  been  responsible  for  these  different 
results? How might have differences in the longevity of species 
contributed  to  the  different  patterns  observed  by  researchers? 
(Hint: Think  about  what  we  might  observe  in  the  other  com-
munities if they were studied for a longer period of time.)  

    4.  In most studies of forest succession such as that of Reiners and 
colleagues  (1971)  and  Oosting  (1942),  researchers  study  suc-
cession  by  comparing  sites  of  various  ages.  This  approach  is 
called  a  “space  for  time  substitution.”  What  are  some  major 
assumptions of a space for time substitution? What contribution 
might  the  Glacier  Bay  system  make  to  testing  some  of  those 
assumptions?  Why  is  this  approach  often  necessary?  What 
advantages for studying succession are offered by systems like 
Sycamore Creek?  

    5.  The rapid succession shown by the Sycamore Creek ecosystem 
is  impressive.  How  might  natural  selection  influence  the  life 
cycles of the organisms living in Sycamore Creek? Imagine a 
creek that floods about twice per century. How quickly would 
you expect the community and ecosystem to recover following 
one of these rare floods? Explain your answer in terms of natu-
ral selection by flooding on the life cycles of organisms.  

    6.  In  the  studies  of  mechanisms  underlying  succession,  ecolo-
gists have found a great deal of evidence for both facilitation 
and inhibition. However, they have found little evidence for the 
tolerance model. Explain this lack of support for the tolerance 
model.  

    7.  When Mount St. Helens in Washington erupted in 1980, it cre-
ated  a  gradient  in  disturbance.  In  the  pumice  plains  near  the 
eruption, the devastation was almost total. The extent of distur-
bance was much less in the farthest reaches of the blast zone. 
How might the rate of forest succession be related to intensity 
of disturbance around Mount St. Helens? Design a study to test 
your ideas, including a hypothetical map of the blast zone, the 
location of study sites, a list of the variables you would mea-
sure, a timetable for your study (assume you or your successors 
study the system for as long as you like), and a list of results 
that would support or contradict your hypothesis.  

    8.  Ecological succession has been compared to the development 
of an organism and the climax community to a kind of super-
organism.  F.  E.  Clements  (1916,  1936)  was  the  best-known 
proponent  of  this  idea,  and  H. A.  Gleason  (1926,  1939),  the 
best-known early opponent of the idea of a community as a kind 
of superorganism. Gleason proposed that species are distributed 
independently of each other and that most overlaps in distribu-
tions are the result of coincidence, not mutual interdependence. 
Most  modern  ecologists  hold  a  view  more  similar  to  that  of 
Gleason. Which of the following graphs showing hypothetical 
distributions  of  species  along  an  environmental  gradient  sup-
ports the superorganismic view of communities? How does the

climates  during  the  history  of  the  earth.  Some  of  the  mass

suggest  about  a  future  biosphere  increasingly  disturbed  by  a

bance hypothesis (see chapter 16) figure into your answer?

I  n every region on earth and at every stage in history, human 

survival has required a basic understanding of landscapes. 
In contemporary ecology, a     landscape    is a heterogeneous 
area  consisting  of  distinctive  patches—which  landscape 
ecologists  refer  to  as      landscape elements   —organized  into  a 
mosaic-like  pattern.  The  elements  of  a  mountain  landscape 
may include forests, meadows, bogs, and streams, while those

apparent in the sharp contrasts in plant cover between the patches of

such a place would include sources of patch distribution and structure 
and the exchanges of materials, energy, and organisms across patch 
boundaries.

in  an  urban  landscape  include  parks,  industrial  districts,  and 
residential areas. 

 While  our  distant  ancestors  did  not  articulate  a  formal 
definition  of  landscape,  their  lives  and  livelihoods  clearly 
reflected  their  understanding  of  landscape  structure  and 
process.  Hunters  and  gatherers  were  familiar  with  variation 
across the landscapes in which they lived. They learned where 
to find plants useful as food or medicines, and where to find 
game animals, including where the animals hid, fed, watered, 
and  how  they  moved  with  the  seasons.  Later,  pastoralists 
learned how to locate forage for livestock, how the most pro-
ductive pastures changed with the seasons and between years 
of drought and years with ample rain, and where in the land-
scape predators and other dangers were likely to be encoun-
tered ( fig. 21.1 ). Settled agriculturalists learned which areas 
were  most  suitable  for  planting  row  crops,  which  were  best 
for orchards and vineyards, and how to work and shape the 
land  to  guide  the  movement  of  water  and  avoid  soil  losses 
( fig. 21.2 ). The establishment of cities required managing the 
movements of food, waste, and water between the urban cen-
ter and the surrounding agricultural and wild lands ( fig. 21.3 ).           
 With  mounting  environmental  pressures  from  human 
populations,  the  need  for  understanding  landscapes  has 
grown,  not  diminished,  and  that  growing  need  has  created 
the modern science of landscape ecology. Jianguo Wu and 
Richard  Hobbs  (2007),  of  Arizona  State  University  and 
University  of  Western,  Australia,  respectively,  point  out 
that  the  precise  meaning  of  the  term  “landscape  ecology,” 
first coined by the German geographer Carl Troll (1939), is 
still  debated  among  landscape  ecologists.  However,  draw-
ing from its many definitions, Wu and Hobbs identify a the-
matic thread uniting the discipline and on that basis define 
     landscape ecology    as “the science and art of studying and 
influencing  the  relationship  between  spatial  pattern  and 
ecological processes across hierarchical levels of biological 
organization and different scales in space and time.” Though 
most  landscape  ecologists  have  worked  at  larger  spatial 
scales, the concepts of landscape ecology have been applied 
to  spatial  patterns  and  ecological  processes  ranging  from

detailed knowledge of local landscapes, especially the locations of good 
forage, water, and shelter.

 Figure 21.2    Successful agriculturalists must have a basic 
 understanding of landscape structure and process. These terraced rice

those relevant to ground beetles moving across a few meters 
of  grassland  (Wiens,  Schooley,  and  Weeks  1997)  to  very 
large  regional  scales  measured  in  thousands  of  km 2 . Also, 
while  the  concepts  of  landscape  ecology  were  first  devel-
oped in terrestrial settings (Forman and Godron 1986; For-
man 1995; Turner, Gardner, and O’Neill 2001), they can be 
applied in aquatic environments as well. 

 Three facets of landscape ecology distinguish it from the 
other subdisciplines of ecology presented in this text. The first 
is  that  landscape  ecology  is  generally  highly  interdisciplin-
ary. Gunther Tress, Bärbel Tress, and Gary Fry (2005) point 
out that     interdisciplinary research    involves researchers from 
multiple disciplines working closely to produce an understand-
ing that integrates across disciplines. Interdisciplinary research 
can  include  several  scientific  disciplines  or  extend  beyond 
the  boundaries  of  the  natural  sciences  into  the  social  sci-
ences  and  humanities. The  second  characteristic  distinguish-
ing landscape ecology from other subdisciplines is that it has 
included humans and human influences on landscapes since its 

462 

Section VI

beginnings. As a consequence, landscape ecology often plays 
a  central  role  where  ecologists  attempt  to  restore  degraded 
landscapes (see Applications, p. 479). Third, and perhaps most 
central to the discipline, landscape ecology focuses on under-
standing  the  extent,  origin,  and  ecological  consequences  of 
spatial heterogeneity across multiple spatial scales. 

 The full conceptual scope of landscape ecology cannot be 
covered in a single chapter (see Wu 2013). However, we will 
sample  the  discipline  by  reviewing  some  studies  concerning 
core areas of landscape ecology. In earlier chapters we discussed 
structure, process, and change within the context of populations, 
communities, and ecosystems. In this chapter we revisit struc-
ture, process, and change within the context of landscapes.  

   21.1  Landscape Structure 
   LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 21.3  Describe landscape structure, including the roles of 
patches and matrix in defining landscape structure.
 21.4  Discuss how variation in number and shapes of eco-
system patches (e.g., forest fragments) contribute to 
landscape structure.

 21.5  Explain how patch shape contributes to edge effect.
 21.6  Explain how a unit of measure can influence the esti-
mated perimeter of a patch (e.g., a patch of forest or 
an oceanic island).

 21.7  Discuss the implications of Mandelbrot’s ideas to 
the ecology of different organisms (e.g., eagles ver-
sus barnacles).

Landscape  structure  includes  the  size,  shape,  composi-
tion,  number,  and  position  of  patches,  or  landscape  ele-
ments, in a landscape.   Much of ecology focuses on studies 
of structure and process; landscape ecology is no exception. 
We are all familiar with the structure, or anatomy, of organ-
isms. In chapter 9, we discussed the structure of populations, 
and in chapters 16 to 20 we considered the structure of com-
munities  and  ecosystems.  However,  what  constitutes  land-
scape structure?     Landscape structure    consists mainly of the 
size, shape, composition, number, and position of patches, or 
landscape elements, within a landscape. As you look across a 
landscape you can usually recognize its constituent ecosys-
tems  as  distinctive  patches,  which  might  consist  of  woods, 
fields, ponds, marshes, or towns. Landscape ecologists define 
a     patch    as a relatively homogeneous area that differs from its 
surroundings—for example, an area of forest surrounded by 
agricultural fields. The patches within a landscape form the 
mosaic that we call landscape structure. The background in 
this mosaic is called the     matrix,    which is the element within 
the landscape that is the most continuous, spatially. 

 Most questions in landscape ecology require that ecolo-
gists  quantify  landscape  structure.  The  following  examples 
show  how  this  has  been  done  on  some  landscapes  and  how 
some aspects of landscape structure are not obvious without 
quantification.  

   The Structure of Six Landscapes in Ohio 
 In  1981,  G.  Bowen  and  R.  Burgess  published  a  quantitative 
analysis of several Ohio landscapes. These landscapes consisted 
of forest patches surrounded by other types of ecosystems. Six 
of the 10 km by 10 km areas analyzed are shown in  figure 21.4.  
If you look carefully at this figure you see that the landscapes, 
which are named after nearby towns, differ considerably in total 
forest cover, the number of forest patches, the average area of 
patches,  and  the  shapes  of  patches.  Some  of  the  landscapes 
are well forested, and others are not. Some contain only small 
patches of forest, while others include some large patches. In 
some landscapes, the forest patches are long and narrow, while 
in  others  they  are  much  wider. These  general  differences  are 
clear enough, but we would find it difficult to give more precise 
descriptions unless we quantified our impressions.     

 First,  let’s  consider  total  forest  cover.  Forest  cover  var-
ies  substantially  among  the  six  landscapes.  The  Concord 
landscape, with 2.7% forest cover, is the least forested. At the 
other extreme, forest patches cover 43.6% of the Washington 
landscape. Differences between these extremes are clear, but 
what  about  some  of  the  less  obvious  differences?  Compare 
the Monroe and Somerset landscapes (see  fig. 21.4 ) and try 
to estimate which is more forested and by how much. Somer- 
set  may  appear  to  have  greater  forest  cover,  but  how  much 
more? You may be surprised to discover that Somerset, with 
22.7% forest cover, has twice the forest cover of the Monroe 
landscape, which includes just 11.8% forest cover ( fig. 21.5 ). 
This substantial difference could mean the difference between 
persistence and local extinction for some forest species.   

 Now let’s examine the size of forest patches in each of 
the landscapes. Again, the median area of forest patches dif-
fers significantly across the landscapes. The smallest median 
areas are in the Monroe landscape, 3.6 ha, and the Concord 
landscape, 4.1 ha. The Washington landscape has the largest 
median patch area. 

 Now,  look  back  at   figure  21.4   and  try  to  estimate  which 
of the landscapes contains the greatest number, or highest den-
sity, of forest patches. The Somerset landscape, with 244 forest 
patches, has the highest patch density, and the Monroe landscape, 
with 180 patches, has the next highest density of forest patches. 
Obviously, the Concord landscape has the lowest density of for-
est patches, with only 46. The Boston landscape, with 86 forest 
patches, contains the next lowest density of forest patches. 

 Now  let’s  look  at  a  more  subtle  feature  of  landscape 
structure: patch shape. Bowen and Burgess quantified patch 
shape  by  the  ratio  of  patch  perimeter  to  the  perimeter  (cir-
cumference) of a circle with an area equal to that of the patch. 
Their formula was:

 How do you translate differences in the value of this index 
into  shape?  If   S   is  about  equal  to  one,  the  patch  is  approxi-
mately  circular.  Increasing  values  of   S   indicate  less  circular 
patch  shapes.  High  values  of   S   generally  indicate  elongate 
patches and a long perimeter relative to area. In other words, 
such patches have more edge habitat relative to interior habitat. 
 The edges of habitat patches, such as forest patches sur-
rounded  by  agricultural  lands,  do  not  have  sharply  defined 
boundaries. Instead, the edges of such habitats are     ecotones,    
which are characterized by physical and biological transitions 
from one ecosystem type to another. Ecotones often support 
a mix of species from both ecosystems, for which they rep-
resent a transition, plus some species unique to the ecotone. 
Consequently, ecotones are often areas of distinctive ecologi-
cal  conditions  and  higher  species  richness  compared  to  the 
ecosystems  on  either  side  of  an  ecotone—a  phenomenon 
referred  to  as      edge effect.    The  species  associated  with  eco-
tones are often called “edge” species, while those associated 
with  the  interiors  of  ecosystems  away  from  an  ecotone  are 
called “interior” species. We will revisit the ecological signifi-
cance of edges in chapter 23 (see p. 517).

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

 Bowen and Burgess calculated the shapes,  S,  for the for-
est patches in each of their landscapes and then determined 
the median shape for each ( fig. 21.6 ). The Concord landscape, 
with a median  S  of 1.16, contains the most circular patches of 
the six landscapes. The Washington landscape, with a median 
 S  of 1.6, contains the least circular patches. As we shall see in 
the next example, landscape ecologists have developed meth-
ods for representing landscape structure that go well beyond 
the classical methods used by Bowen and Burgess.   

 Historically,  geometry,  which  means  “earth  measure-
ment,”  could  only  offer  rough  approximations  of  complex 
landscape  structure.  Today,  an  area  of  mathematics  called 
 fractal geometry  can be used to quantify the structure of com-
plex natural shapes. Fractal geometry was developed by Ben-
oit Mandelbrot (1982) to provide a method for describing the 
dimensions of natural objects as diverse as ferns, snowflakes, 
and  patches  in  a  landscape.  Fractal  geometry  offers  unique 
insights into the structure of nature.  

  The Fractal Geometry of Landscapes 
 During  the  development  of  fractal  geometry,  Mandelbrot 
asked a deceptively simple question: “How long is the coast 
of Great Britain?” This is analogous to estimating the perim-
eter of a patch in a landscape. Think about this question. At 
first,  you  might  expect  there  to  be  only  one,  exact  answer. 
For simple shapes with smooth outlines such as squares and 
circles,  the  assumption  of  a  single  answer  is  approximately 
correct. However, an estimate of the perimeter of a complex 
shape often depends upon the size of the measuring device. 
In other words, if you measure the coastline of Great Britain, 
you will find that your measurement depends upon the size 
of the ruler you use. If you were to step off the perimeter of 
Great Britain in 1 km lengths, which is like using a ruler 1 km 

Patch shape determines factors such as ratio of perimeter
to area, which can affect factors such as physical
environment of the patch interior and exposure of forest
interior species to certain parasites.

Patches in the Washington
landscape were much less 
circular than in the
Boston landscape.

long, you would get a smaller estimate than if you made your 
measurements with a 100 m ruler. If you measured the coast-
line with a 10 cm ruler you would get an even larger estimate 
of the perimeter. The reason that a larger ruler gives a smaller 
estimate is that the large ruler misses many of the nooks and 
crannies along the coast. These smaller features show up in 
estimates made with smaller rulers. 

 Mandelbrot’s  answer  to  his  question  about  the  British 
coastline was “Coastline length depends on the scale at which 
it is measured!” We can see the ecological significance of this 
finding  by  considering  some  of  its  consequences  to  organ-
isms.  Bruce  Milne  (1993)  measured  the  coastline  of Admi-
ralty Island off the coast of southeastern Alaska. He made his 
measurements from the perspective of two very different ani-
mal residents of the island, bald eagles and barnacles. 

 Milne considered how the measured length of Admiralty 
Island’s coastline depends upon the length of the measuring 
device.  Figure 21.7  plots ruler length on the horizontal axis 
and  estimated  length  of  coastline  on  the  vertical  axis.  The 
straight line that joins the dots slopes downward to the right. 
As  Mandelbrot  suggested,  the  estimated  coastline  length 
decreases as ruler length increases.   

 Now, what “ruler” are bald eagles and barnacles using? 
The  distribution  of  eagle  nests  around Admiralty  Island  are 
about 0.782 km apart. This measurement of inter-nest distance 
gives us an estimate of the length of coastline required by a 
bald eagle territory on the island. In contrast, barnacles range 
from  1  to  a  few  centimeters  in  basal  diameter  and  they  are 

Stepping off the coastline in 1 km 
lengths produces an estimate of 
shoreline length of about 800 km. 

A 10 km ruler produces an 
estimated shoreline length 
of about 400 km.

sedentary. Barnacles only need a small area of solid surface 
to attach themselves and are often packed side by side along 
a  rocky  shore.  Milne  estimated  that  an  individual  barnacle 
requires about 2 cm (0.00002 km) of coastline. 

 Milne assumed that the eagles are, in effect, using a ruler 
0.782 km long to step off the perimeter of the island and that 
barnacles  use  a  ruler  0.00002  km  long.  Milne’s  analysis  esti-
mates that from the eagle’s perspective, the perimeter of Admi-
ralty Island is just a bit over 760 km. However, to a barnacle 
stepping off the coastline with its tiny ruler, the perimeter is over 
11,000 km! Any of us would probably have assumed that the 
barnacle population “sees” a lot more of the spatial complexity 
around Admiralty Island. However, without Mandelbrot’s frac-
tal geometry, it would be difficult to predict that the difference 
in island perimeter for eagles and barnacles would be as great as 
760 versus 11,000 km. At the conclusion of his analysis, Milne 
challenges us to imagine how long the coastline of Admiralty 
Island must be from the perspective of crude oil molecules. This 
is the length of coastline that determines the cost of a thorough 
cleanup after oil spills like that of the  Exxon Valdez  ( fig. 21.8 ). 
 As in other areas of science, describing aspects of landscape 
structure, such as the length of the coastline of Admiralty Island 
or the size, shape, and number of forest patches in Ohio land-
scapes, is not an end in itself. Landscape ecologists study land-
scape  structure  because  it  influences  landscape  processes  and 
change. These are the next topics in the following discussions. 

  Concept 21.1 Review 

1.   In  the  landscapes  shown  in   figure  21.4 ,  what  is  patch 

and what is matrix?  

2.   The  populations  of  many  forest  bird  species  in  east-
ern North America have declined following deforesta-
tion and fragmentation of forest habitat (see  fig. 21.4 ), 
whereas  many  birds  associated  with  open  grassland 
habitats  have  thrived.  From  a  landscape  perspective, 
how could forest succession (chapter 20, pp. 435–439) 
change this situation?

After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 21.9  Discuss how landscape structure influences the 

movement of mammals.

 21.10  Explain why habitat patch size and habitat corridors 
would be an important consideration in planning for 
conservation of a species, such as the Glanville fritil-
lary butterfly.

 21.11  Explain how understanding the chemistry of a lake 

may require looking beyond the boundary of the 
lake to consider the broader landscape context. 

  Figure 21.8    Perspective on landscapes: fractal geometry tells us 
that the length of coastline accessible to ( a ) the oil molecules spilling 
from the hold of an oil tanker, such as the  Exxon Valdez  (the larger ship 
shown in this photo) is much greater than that used by ( b ) bald eagles.  

   Landscape  structure  influences  processes  such  as  the 
flow of energy, materials, and species across a landscape.
Landscape  ecologists  study  how  the  size,  shape,  composi-
tion,  number,  and  position  of  ecosystems  in  the  landscape 
affect     landscape processes.    Though less familiar than physi-
ological  and  ecosystem  processes,  landscape  processes  are 
responsible  for  many  important  ecological  phenomena.  In 
chapter  20  (see  fig.  20.28),  we  saw  how  landscape  struc-
ture, especially the location of shallow bedrock, controls the 
exchange of nutrients between subsurface and surface waters 
and  local  rates  of  primary  production  in  Sycamore  Creek,

Arizona. As we will see in the following examples, landscape 
structure affects other ecologically important processes such 
as the dispersal of organisms, extinction of local populations, 
and the flux of water between groundwater and lakes.  

   Landscape Structure 
and the Dispersal of Mammals 
 Landscape  ecologists  have  proposed  that  landscape  structure, 
especially the size, number, and isolation of habitat patches, can 
influence the movement of organisms between potentially suit-
able habitats. For instance, populations of desert bighorn sheep 
live in the isolated mountain ranges of the southwestern United 
States and northern Mexico, with individuals moving frequently 
among the ranges ( fig. 21.9 ). The group of subpopulations of des-
ert bighorn sheep living in an area such as the deserts of southern 
California constitute a metapopulation (see p. 224). The rate of 
movement of individuals between such subpopulations can sig-
nificantly affect the persistence of a species in a landscape.   

 Human  activity  often  produces  habitat  fragmentation, 
which occurs where a road cuts through a forest, a housing 

(a)

(b)

development  eliminates  an  area  of  shrubland,  or  tracts  of 
tropical rain forest are cut to plant pastures. Because habitat 
fragmentation is increasing, ecologists study how landscape 
structure  affects  the  movements  of  organisms,  movements 
that  might  mean  the  difference  between  population  persis-
tence and local extinction. 

 James  Diffendorfer,  Michael  Gaines,  and  Robert  Holt 
(1995) studied how patch size affects the movements of three 
small mammal species: cotton rats,  Sigmodon hispidus,  prai-
rie  voles,   Microtus  ochrogaster,   and  deer  mice,   Peromyscus 
maniculatus.  They divided a 12 ha prairie landscape in Kansas 
into eight 5,000 m 2  areas. The prairie vegetation was mowed 
to maintain three patterns of fragmentation ( fig. 21.10 ). The 
least  fragmented  areas  consisted  of  large,  50  m  by  100  m 
patches.  The  areas  with  medium  fragmentation  each  con-
tained 6 medium 12 m by 24 m patches. The most fragmented 
landscapes contained 10 or 15 small 4 m by 8 m patches.   

 The researchers predicted that animals would move farther 
in the more fragmented landscapes consisting of small habitat 
patches. In fragmented landscapes, individuals must move far-
ther to find mates, food, and cover. They also predicted that 
animals would stay longer in the more isolated patches within 
fragmented  landscapes.  Consequently,  the  proportion  of  ani-
mals moving would decrease with habitat fragmentation. 

 The rodent populations were monitored on the study site by 
trapping them with Sherman live traps and tagging newly caught 
individuals twice each month from August 1984 to May 1992. 
Over the course of their 8-year study, Diffendorfer, Gaines, and 
Holt  amassed  a  data  set  consisting  of  23,185  captures.  They 
used these data to construct movement histories for individual 
animals in order to test their predictions. They expressed move-
ments as  mean square distances,  a measurement that estimates 
the size of an individual’s home range. A home range is the area 
that an animal occupies on a daily basis. 

 The behavior of two of the three study species supports 
the hypothesis that small mammals move farther in more frag-
mented landscapes. As predicted,  Peromyscus  and  Microtus,

Influence of patch size on small mammal movements within experimental landscapes (means, 1 standard error) (data from 

living in small patches, moved farther than individuals living 
in medium or large patches ( fig. 21.11 ). However, the move-
ments of  Sigmodon  in medium and large patches did not differ 
significantly.   

 The proportion of  Sigmodon, Microtus,  and  Peromyscus  
moving within the 5,000 m 2  experimental areas supported the 
hypothesis  that  animal  movements  decrease  with  habitat 
fragmentation (see  fig. 21.11 ). A larger proportion of  Sigmo-
don  moved within large patch areas than moved within areas 
with medium patches. Because few  Sigmodon  were captured 
within small patch areas, their movements within these areas 
could  not  be  analyzed. A  larger  proportion  of   Microtus   and 
 Peromyscus   moved  within  large  and  medium  patches  than 
moved within small patches. 

 In summary, this experiment shows a predictable relation-
ship between landscape structure and the movement of organ-
isms across landscapes. As the following example shows, those 
movements may be crucial to maintaining local populations.  

  Habitat Patch Size and Isolation and 
the Density of Butterfly Populations 
 Ilkka Hanski, Mikko Kuussaari, and Marko Nieminen (1994) 
found that the local population density of the Glanville fritil-
lary butterfly,  Melitaea cinxia,  is significantly affected by the 
size  and  isolation  of  habitat  patches  (see  chapter  4,  p.  94). 
The  researchers  studied  a  metapopulation  (see  chapter  10, 
p. 224) of these butterflies on Åland Island in southwestern 
Finland.  Their  study  site  consisted  of  15.5  km 2   of  country-
side, a landscape consisting of small farms, cultivated fields, 
pastures, meadows, and woods ( fig. 21.12 ). Within this land-
scape, habitat suitable for the butterfly consisted of patches of 
their larval food plant,  Plantago lanceolata,  which generally 
occurs in pastures and meadows.   

 Figure 21.12    Much of the landscape of southwestern Finland 
 consists of a patchwork of pastures, meadows, and woods. 

 There were 50 patches of potential habitat within the study 
area. Forty-two of these patches were occupied by the butter-
flies in 1991. The patches ranged in area from 12 to 46,000 m 2  
and supported populations ranging from 0 to 2,190 individu-
als. The habitat patches also varied in their degree of isolation 
from other habitat patches. The distance from habitat patches 
to  the  nearest  occupied  patch  varied  from  30  m  to  1.6  km. 
However, Hanski and his colleagues found that, from a statisti-
cal perspective, the best index of isolation combined distances 
to neighboring habitat patches and the numbers of butterflies 
living on those patches. 

 Habitat patch area influenced both the size and density of 
the populations. Total population size within a patch increased 
with patch area. However, population density decreased as patch 

468 

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

area increased ( fig. 21.13 ). Thus, though large habitat patches 
supported larger numbers of individuals than smaller patches, 
population density was lower on large patches.   

 The  team  also  found  that  more  isolated  patches  sup-
ported  lower  densities  of  butterflies.  Isolation  influences 
local population density in these populations because local 
populations  are  partly  maintained  by  immigration  of   Meli-
taea  from other patches. For instance, during 1 week of sam-
pling  the  butterflies  in  one  patch,  about  15%  of  the  males 
and  30%  of  the  females  were  recaptures  from  surrounding 
patches. 

 This  experiment  determined  that  area  and  isolation  of 
patches  strongly  influence  the  size  and  density  of   Melitaea  
populations. One conclusion that we can draw from these pat-
terns is that landscape structure is important for understand-
ing the distribution and abundance of the butterflies. It turns 
out  that  landscape  structure  also  affects  the  persistence  of 
local  populations.  Between  1991  and  1992,  Hanski  and  his 
colleagues recorded three extinctions of local populations and

 The studies by Diffendorfer and colleagues and Hanski 
and colleagues show that the movement of organisms and the 
characteristics  of  local  populations  are  significantly  influ-
enced by landscape structure.  

  Habitat Corridors and 
Movement of Organisms 
 One long-standing approach to reducing the negative impact 
of  fragmentation  and  isolation  on  populations  has  been  to 
connect  habitat  fragments  with  corridors  of  similar  habitat. 
Despite the logic of the approach, evidence for the effective-
ness  of  habitat  corridors  to  promote  movement  of  organ-
isms  between  habitat  patches  has  been  scant.  Experimental 
 evidence, in particular, has been lacking. Recently, however, a 
number of experimental studies have filled many of the gaps 
in  our  understanding  of  the  effects  of  habitat  corridors  on 
movement by organisms. 

 Nick Haddad and Kristen Baum (Haddad 1999;  Haddad 
and  Baum  1999)  studied  the  influence  of  corridors  on  the 
movements  of  butterflies  associated  with  early  successional 
habitats. Their study site was the Savannah River Site, South 
Carolina, a National Environmental Research Park, where they 
created patches of open habitat in dense 40- to 50-year-old for-
ests of pine. Patches of open habitat were squares, 128 m on a 
side, with an area of 1.64 ha, the approximate size of forestry 
clear-cuts in the surrounding region. With the help of the staff 
of  the  Savannah  River  Institute,  Haddad  and  Baum  created 
27 openings: 8 that were isolated and 19 that were connected 
by corridors of open habitat to other patches. Within each patch 
all trees were removed and the slash (debris) was burned. 

 In a study of movements of butterflies between patches, 
Haddad (1999) focused his attention on two butterfly species: 
the common buckeye,  Junonia coenia,  and the variegated frit-
illary,  Euptoieta claudia.  Both of these species are specialized 
for life in early successional habitats and avoid pine forests. 
Haddad used mark and recapture techniques to study butterfly 
movements. He marked a total of 1,260 common buckeye but-
terflies  and  189  variegated  fritillaries.  Haddad  subsequently 
recaptured 239 common buckeye butterflies and 47 variegated 
fritillaries. His results showed clearly that corridors increased 
the frequency of movements by both butterfly species between 
patches. In a companion study Haddad and Baum (1999) also 
documented higher densities of both butterfly species in open 
habitats connected by corridors ( fig. 21.14 ).     

 However,  the  influences  of  corridors  on  movement  of 
organisms between open habitats within the Savannah River Site 
extend far beyond butterflies. Research conducted by a team of 
10  investigators  (Tewksbury  et  al.  2002)  also  showed  higher 
rates  of  movement  by  common  buckeye  and  variegated  fritil-
lary butterflies between patches connected by corridors. They 
also discovered higher rates of pollination of plants growing in 
connected  patches  and  higher  rates  of  seed  dispersal,  mainly 
by birds. In summary, these studies and many others have now

system in northern Wisconsin. Morgan Lake, which receives 
the  bulk  of  its  water  from  precipitation,  occupies  the  upper 
end  of  this  continuum.  Lakes  such  as  this  one  occupy  high 
points in the hydrologic flow system and are called “hydro-
logically  mounded”  lakes. These  lakes  are  sources  of  water 
for the rest of the hydrologic flow system. Crystal Lake and 
Sparkling Lake, which occupy intermediate positions within 
the hydrologic flow system and receive significant inflows of 
groundwater, are “groundwater flow through” lakes. Finally, 
at the lower end of the flow system are the “drainage” lakes 
that  receive  significant  surface  drainage  as  well  as  ground-
water  drainage.  Webster  and  her  colleagues  estimated  that 
 Morgan  Lake  receives  no  groundwater  inflow,  while  Trout

shown  that  habitat  corridors  can  facilitate  the  movement  of 
organisms between otherwise isolated habitat fragments. 

 As we will see in the next example, landscape structure 
can  also  influence  the  chemical  and  physical  characteristics 
of ecosystems.  

  Landscape Position and Lake Chemistry 
 Katherine Webster  and  her  colleagues  (1996)  at  the  Center 
for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin and the U.S. 
Geological Survey explored how the position of a lake in a 
landscape affects its chemical responses to drought. Drought 
can affect a wide range of lake ecosystem properties, includ-
ing nutrient cycling and the concentrations of dissolved ions. 
However, two lakes may respond differently to drought. For 
instance,  while  drought  increased  the  concentration  of  dis-
solved  substances  in  Lake  239  at  the  Experimental  Lakes 
Area in Ontario, it decreased them in Nevins Lake, Michigan. 
 Webster and her colleagues set out to determine whether 
the contrasting chemical responses of lakes to drought can be 
explained by the position of the lake in the landscape. They 
worked in northern Wisconsin, where they defined the land-
scape  position  of  a  lake  as  its  location  within  a  hydrologic 
flow system. The team quantified the position of a lake within 
a hydrologic flow system as the proportion of lake water sup-
plied by groundwater. 

 The sources of water for a lake are precipitation, surface 
water,  and  groundwater  flow.  Different  lakes  receive  differ-
ent proportions of their water from these sources, and these 
proportions  depend  upon  a  lake’s  position  in  the  landscape.

Suppose you are studying the exchange of organic matter between 
forests and streams and the landscape you are studying is a mosaic 
of patches of two forest types: deciduous and coniferous. Part of 
your study involves determining whether there is a difference in 
the amount of detritus in streams draining patches of deciduous 
forest versus those draining coniferous forest. In an initial phase 
of the study, you take random measurements of the amounts of 
detritus  (g  dry  weight  per  m 2 )  in  two  streams:  one  draining  a 
deciduous forest patch and one draining a coniferous forest patch:

  Your hypothesis is that there is no difference in the amounts 
of  detritus  that  these  two  streams  contain.  However,  it  turns 
out  that  the  distribution  of  detritus  within  the  streams  is  not 
normal, and so a sample mean will not accurately reflect the 
typical  amount  of  detritus  per  square  meter. Also,  a   t -test  is 
not  appropriate  for  making  a  statistical  comparison  of  detri-
tus standing stock in the two ecosystems. The alternative is to 
use  a  statistical  test  that  does  not  assume  a  normal  distribu-
tion  and  compares  medians   not   means.  One  such  procedure 
is the Mann-Whitney test, which uses ranks of measurements 
or observations made in two populations, rather than the mea-
surements themselves to make a statistical comparison. Here 
are the same data ordered (ranked) from smallest to largest:

  We  can  now  calculate  the  Mann-Whitney  statistic   U   for  the 
two streams. Let’s begin with the stream draining the decidu-
ous forest:

 The Mann-Whitney statistic for the coniferous stream can be 
calculated in the same way as:

 Or more simply as:

Uc 5 (nd) (nc) 2 Ud
Uc 5 (7)(7) 2 43
Uc 5 6   

 At this point in the Mann-Whitney procedure, the larger of the 
two  U  values is compared to a table of critical values (Appen-
dix, table A.2). The applicable critical values are determined 
by  significance  level,  generally  P  <  0.05,  and  the  sample 
sizes,  n  1  and  n  2 , which in this case are  n   d    5  7 and  n   c    5  7. 
Examining  table A.2,  we  find  that  the  critical  value  of  the 
Mann-Whitney test statistic for our comparison is 41. Since 
 U   d    5  43 is greater than 41, we reject the hypothesis that the 
two streams contain the same standing stock of detritus and 
accept  the  alternative  hypothesis  that  the  standing  stocks  of 
detritus in these two particular streams are different.

Lake, at the lower end of the hydrologic flow system, receives 
35% of its inflow as groundwater.     

 The  responses  of  these  seven  lakes  to  a  drought  were 
studied from 1986 to 1990. As you might expect, the levels 
of the lakes dropped during this 4-year drought. However, the 
amount of drop in lake level was related to a lake’s position 
in  the  landscape  ( fig.  21.16 ). The  level  of  Morgan  Lake,  at 
the upper end of the hydrologic flow system, dropped 0.7 m, 
while  the  levels  of  Vandercook,  Big  Muskellunge,  Crystal, 
and Sparkling lakes, in the middle of the hydrologic flow sys-
tem, dropped 0.9 to 1.0 m. Meanwhile, the levels of Trout and 
Allequash lakes, the two drainage lakes at the lower end of the 
hydrologic flow system, dropped very little.           

 Landscape  position  also  significantly  influenced  a  lake’s 
chemical  responses  to  the  drought. The   concentrations   of  dis-
solved  ions  such  as  calcium  (Ca 2 1  )  and  magnesium  (Mg 2 1  ) 
increased in the majority of the lakes. However, the increase in 
ion concentration was highest at the upper and lower ends of the 
hydrologic flow system. Meanwhile, the combined  mass  of Ca 2 1  
and Mg 2 1   increased in the three lakes at the lower end but did 
not change in Morgan Lake, at the upper end of the flow system, 
and either decreased or did not change in the lakes occupying the 
middle portions of the hydrologic flow system (see  fig. 21.16 ). 

 The researchers concluded that the increased mass of Ca 2 1   
and Mg 2 1   seen at the lower end of the hydrologic flow system 
was due to an increased proportion of inflows from groundwater 
and surface water, sources rich in Ca 2 1   and Mg 2 1  . The declines 
in mass of Ca 2 1   and Mg 2 1   in Big Muskellunge Lake are likely 
due to reduced inflow of ion-rich groundwater. The stability of 
Ca 2 1   and Mg 2 1   mass in Morgan Lake was attributed to its isola-
tion from the groundwater flow system. Morgan Lake receives 
almost no groundwater even during wet periods. Regardless of 
the  mechanisms,  the  chemical  responses  of  these  lakes  to  the 
drought were related to their positions in the landscape. 

 In the first section of this chapter, we reviewed the con-
cept of landscape structure. In this section, we explored the 

connection  between  landscape  structure  and  landscape  pro-
cesses.  But  what  creates  landscape  structure?  Landscape 
structure,  like  the  structure  of  populations,  communities, 
and ecosystems, changes in response to an interplay between 
dynamic  processes.  We  explore  the  sources  of  landscape 
structure and change in the next section.

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

   Landscapes  are  structured  and  change  in  response  to 
geological processes, climate, activities of organisms, and 
fire.   What  creates  the  patchiness  we  see  in  landscapes? 
Many  forces  combine  in  numerous  ways  to  produce  the 
patchiness that we call landscape structure. In this section, we 
review examples of how geological processes, climate, organ-
isms, and fire contribute to landscape structure.  

   Geological Processes, Climate, 
and Landscape Structure 
 The geological features produced by processes such as volca-
nism, sedimentation, and erosion provide a primary source of 
landscape structure. For instance, the alluvial deposits along 
a river valley provide growing conditions different from those 
on thin, well-drained soils on nearby hills. A volcanic cinder 
cone in the middle of a sandy plain offers different environ-
mental  conditions  than  the  surrounding  plain  ( fig.  21.17 ). 
Distinctive  ecosystems  may  develop  on  each  of  these  geo-
logical surfaces, creating patchiness in the landscape. In the 
following example, we shall see how distinctive soils contrib-
ute to vegetative patchiness in a Sonoran Desert landscape.   

  Soil and Vegetation Mosaics 
in the Sonoran Desert 
 The Sonoran Desert includes many long, narrow mountain 
ranges  separated  by  basins  or  valleys. The  mountains  and 
basins in this region originated in movements of the earth’s 
crust that began 12 to 15 million years ago. As the moun-
tains were uplifted and the adjacent basins subsided, erosion 
removed  materials  from  the  mountain  slopes. This  eroded 
material was deposited in the surrounding basins, forming 
sloping  plains,  or   bajadas,   at  the  bases  of  the  mountains. 
Sediment deposits in these basins may be over 3 km deep. 

Tucson Mountains

 From a distance, the bajadas of the Sonoran Desert may 
appear  to  be  uniform  environments,  especially  against  the 
backdrop of a rugged desert mountain (see fig. 16.1). How-
ever, Joseph McAuliffe (1994) has shown that bajadas in the 
Sonoran  Desert  near Tucson, Arizona,  consist  of  a  complex 
mosaic of distinctive     landforms.    His studies have shown that 
intermittent  erosion  and  deposition  operating  over  the  past 
2 million years have produced a complex landscape. 

 McAuliffe established study sites on the bajadas of three 
mountain  ranges,  where  he  studied  soils  and  plant  distribu-
tions. In all three study areas, he found a wide range of soil 
types and plant distributions that corresponded closely to soil 
age and structure. 

 Let’s  look  at  some  of  the  patterns  McAuliffe  found  on 
the  bajada  associated  with  the  northern  end  of  the  Tucson 
Mountains. Going from left to right in  figure 21.18 , the first

soils  you  see  are  of  early  Pleistocene  age  and  are  approxi-
mately 1.8 to 1.9 million years old. Going northward along 
the bajada, to the right in  figure 21.18 , the next soils in the 
sequence  date  from  the  middle  to  late  Pleistocene  and  are 
hundreds of thousands of years old. These soils are followed 
by Holocene deposits that are less than 11,000 years old and 
are associated with an ephemeral desert water course called 
Wildhorse Wash. Near the Holocene soils, McAuliffe found 
soils  that  dated  from  the  late  Pleistocene.  These  soils  were 
25,000 to 75,000 years old.   

 In  the  space  of  a  few  kilometers,  McAuliffe  found 
patches  of  soil  that  were  (1)  almost  2  million  years  old, 
(2) hundreds of thousands of years old, (3) tens of thousands 
of years old, and (4) less than 11,000 years old. Because soil-
building processes occur over long periods of time, these soils 
of vastly different ages also differ substantially in structure. 
 Figure 21.19  shows McAuliffe’s drawings of typical profiles 
of  Holocene,  middle  to  late  Pleistocene,  and  early  Pleisto-
cene soils. The Holocene soils had low amounts of clay and 
calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) and poorly developed soil hori-
zons. They also lacked a  caliche layer,  a hardpan soil horizon 
formed by precipitation of CaCO 3 . Middle to late Pleistocene 
soils had a much higher clay content than Holocene soils, and 
early Pleistocene soils contained even more clay. These clay 
layers in the older soil profiles are called     argillic horizons.    
Middle to late and early Pleistocene soils also contained more 
CaCO 3  and were underlain by a thick layer of caliche.   

 These differences in soil structure influence the distribu-
tions of perennial plants across the Tucson Mountain bajada 
( fig.  21.20 ).  McAuliffe  found  that  the  relative  abundances 
of  two  shrubs,   Larrea  tridentata   and   Ambrosia  deltoidea,  
accounted for much of the variation in perennial plant distri-
butions and that plant distributions map clearly onto soils of 
different  ages.  For  instance,   Ambrosia   is  most  abundant  on 
middle to late Pleistocene soils, whereas  Larrea  dominates on 
Holocene  soils  and  on  early  Pleistocene  soils.  Other  peren-
nial plant species dominate on the eroding side slopes of early 
Pleistocene soils. Climate also influences landscape structure.    

  Climate and Landscape Structure 
 The soils studied by McAuliffe show evidence of the particular 
climate in which they formed. The soil mosaic along the bajada 
east  of  the  Tucson  Mountains  consists  of  patches  of  mate-
rial  deposited  during  floods  originating  in  these  mountains 
from nearly 2 million years ago to less than 11,000 years ago. 
The  deposits  were  laid  down  during  times  when  the  climate 
produced  intense  storms  that  caused  flooding  and  erosion. 
Materials eroded from mountain slopes were deposited as allu-
vium on the surrounding bajadas. 

 These alluvial deposits were gradually changed, and these 
changes were dependent upon climate. Two of the prominent 
features of the older soils studied by McAuliffe were the for-
mation of a clay-rich argillic horizon and the formation of a 
CaCO 3 -rich caliche layer. Both of these soil features are the

result  of  water  transport.  Clay  particles  are  transported  as  a 
colloidal  suspension,  whereas  the  CaCO 3   is  transported  in 
dissolved form. Consequently, the clays precipitate out of sus-
pension higher in the soil profile than the CaCO 3 . The result 
is the layering of an argillic horizon over a caliche layer as 
shown in  figure 21.19.  

 Water, working on alluvial deposits, is responsible for the 
soil structure observed by McAuliffe, but it was water deliv-
ered to the landscape under particular climatic conditions. We 
can get a clue about those conditions by observing some soil 
characteristics. We know that argillic horizons are deposited 
by  water.  However,  the  soils  described  by  McAuliffe  also 
offer clues that the action of water was highly episodic. The 
argillic horizon in these soils is red, and this red color is the 
result  of  a  buildup  of  iron  oxides.  Oxidation  of  iron  could 
have only occurred in an oxidizing environment. Because soil 
saturated with water quickly becomes anoxic, the presence of 
oxidized iron in the argillic horizon indicates that these soils 
were  formed  when  conditions  were  intermittently  wet.  In 
other words, the soils along the bajada of the Tucson Moun-
tains  formed  under  particular  climatic  conditions.  Different 
climatic conditions would have produced different soils and, 
perhaps, different plant distributions. 

 While geological processes and climate set the basic tem-
plate for landscape structure, the activities of organisms can 
be  an  additional  source  of  landscape  structure  and  change. 
In the following example, we consider how the activities of 
humans and other species can change landscape structure.   

  Organisms and Landscape Structure 
 Organisms of all sorts influence the structure of landscapes. 
Organisms  that  cause  changes  in  the  physical  environ-
ment  sufficient  to  influence  the  structure  of  landscapes, 

ecosystems, or communities are often referred to as     ecosys-
tem engineers    (Jones, Lawton, and Shachak 1994). While 
the following discussion focuses on the influences of ani-
mals,  plants  create  much  of  the  distinctive  patchwork  we 
call landscape structure. For an example of how plants can 
create  landscape  structure,  think  back  to  chapter  9,  where 
we  discussed  the  distribution  of  Larrea  tridentata  in  the 
Sonoran and Mojave Deserts (see figure 9.12, p. 206). By 
shading the ground and retaining leaf litter under their can-
opies,  these  widely  dispersed  desert  shrubs  create  patches 
of  reduced  temperature  variation  and  higher  fertility.  By 
adding  these  distinctive  patches,  Larrea  alters  landscape 
structure. 

 Of  all  species,  humans  are  the  most  dominant  modi-
fiers  of  landscapes.  Many  studies  of  landscape  change 
have  focused  on  the  conversion  of  forest  to  agricultural 
landscapes.  In  North  America,  an  often-cited  example  of 
this  sort  of  landscape  change  is  that  of  Cadiz  Township, 
Green  County,  Wisconsin  ( fig.  21.21 ).  In  1831,  approxi-
mately 93.5% of Cadiz Township was forested. By 1882 the 
percentage  of  forested  land  had  decreased  to  27%  and  by 
1902 forest cover had fallen to less than 9%. Between 1902 
and 1950 the total area of forest decreased again to 3.4%. 
Similar changes in landscape structure have been observed 
throughout  the  midwestern  region  of  the  United  States. 
However, in some other forested regions of North America 
and Europe, the pattern of recent landscape change has been 
different.   

 In eastern North America, many abandoned farms have 
reverted to forest and in these landscapes forest cover has 
increased. Recent increases in forest cover have also been 
observed in some parts of northern Europe. One such area 
is the Veluwe region in the central Netherlands.  Maureen 
Hulshoff (1995) reviewed the landscape changes that have

occurred in the Veluwe region during the past 1,200 years. 
The  Veluwe  landscape  was  originally  dominated  by  a 
mixed deciduous forest. Then, from  a.d.  800 to 1100, peo-
ple  gradually  occupied  the  area  and  cut  the  forest.  Con-
sequently, forests were gradually converted to heathlands, 
which  are  landscapes  dominated  by  low  shrubs  and  used 
for livestock foraging. Later, small areas of cropland were 
interspersed  with  the  extensive  heathlands.  During  the 
tenth and eleventh centuries, some areas were devegetated 
completely  and  converted  to  areas  of  drifting  sand.  The 
problem  of  drifting  sand  continued  to  increase  until  the 
end of the nineteenth century, when the Dutch government 
began planting pine plantations on the Veluwe landscape, a 
practice that continued into the twentieth century. 

  Figure 21.22  shows the changes in the composition of the 
Veluwe  landscape  from  1845  to  1982.  The  greatest  change 
over this period was a shift in dominance from heathlands to 
forests. In 1845, heathlands made up 66% of the landscape, 
while forests constituted 17%. By 1982, coverage by heath-
lands had fallen to 12% of the landscape and forest coverage 
had risen to 64%. The figure also shows modest but ecologi-
cally significant changes in the other landscape elements. The 
area of drift sand reached a peak in 1898 and then dropped 
and held steady at 3% to 4% from 1957 to 1982. Urban areas 
established a significant presence beginning in 1957. Finally, 
coverage  by  agricultural  areas  has  varied  from  9%  to  16% 
over the study interval, the least variation shown by any of the 
landscape elements.     

 As  total  coverage  by  forest  and  heathlands  changed 
within the Veluwe landscape, the number and average area of 
forest and heath patches also changed. These changes indicate 
increasing fragmentation of heathlands and decreasing frag-
mentation  of  forests.  For  instance,  between  1845  and  1982, 
the number of forest patches declined, while the average area 
of  forest  patches  increased.  During  this  period,  the  number 
of  heath  patches  increased  until  1957.  Between  1957  and 
1982, the number of heath patches decreased as some patches 
were eliminated. The average area of heath patches decreased 
rapidly between 1845 and 1931 and then remained approxi-
mately stable from 1931 to 1982. 

 During the period that Cadiz Township in Wisconsin was 
losing forest cover, this landscape element was increasing in 
the Veluwe district of the Netherlands. These two examples 
show  how  human  activity  has  changed  landscape  structure. 
However, what forces drive human influences on landscapes? 
In both Cadiz Township and the Veluwe landscape, the driv-
ing  forces  were  economic. A  developing  agricultural  econ-
omy converted Cadiz Township from forest to farmland. The 
Veluwe  landscape  was  converted  from  heathland  to  forest 
as the local sheep-raising economy collapsed in response to 
the introduction of synthetic fertilizers and inexpensive wool 
from Australia. 

 At  the  beginning  of  the  twenty-first  century,  economi-
cally motivated human activity continues to change the struc-
ture  of  landscapes  all  over  the  globe.  We  examine  current 
trends in land cover at the global scale in chapter 23. Before

we do that, however, let’s examine the effects of some other 
species on landscape structure. 

 Many  animal  species  modify 

landscape  structure 
( fig. 21.23 ). African elephants feed on trees and often knock 
them down in the process. As a consequence, these elephants 
can gradually change woodland to grassland. Alligators main-
tain  ponds  in  the  Florida  Everglades,  a  landscape  element 
upon which many species depend to survive droughts. Small 
species can also change landscapes. Kangaroo rats,  Dipodo-
mys  spp., of the American Southwest dig burrow systems that 
modify the structure of the soil, the distribution of nutrients, 
and the distribution of plants to such an extent that the result 
is  recognizable  from  aerial  photos.  Similar  effects  on  land-
scape structure are created by termites and ants.   

 One of the most adept modifiers of landscapes is the bea-
ver,  Castor canadensis  ( fig. 21.24 ). Beavers alter landscapes 
by  cutting  trees,  building  dams  on  stream  channels,  and 
flooding  the  surrounding  landscape.  Beaver  dams  increase 
the extent of wetlands in the landscape, alter the hydrologic 
regime of the catchment, and trap sediments, organic matter, 
and  nutrients. The  selective  cutting  of  trees  adds  patchiness 
to  the  plant  community  and  reduces  the  abundance  of  tree

2,563 ha, was dominated by forest. In 1927, moist meadow, wet 
meadow, and pond ecosystems covered only 200 ha. By 1988, 
moist meadows, wet meadows, and beaver ponds covered over 
2,600 ha and boreal forest was limited to 102 ha. Between 1927 
and 1988, beavers transformed most of the landscape. 

 The  changes  in  landscape  structure  induced  by  beavers 
substantially alter landscape processes such as nutrient reten-
tion.  Beaver  activity  between  1927  and  1988  increased  the 
quantity of most major ions and nutrients in the areas affected 
by  impoundments  ( fig.  21.26 ).  The  total  quantity  of  nitro-
gen increased by 72%, while the amounts of phosphorus and 
potassium increased by 43% and 20%, respectively. The quan-
tities of calcium, magnesium, iron, and sulfate stored in the 
landscape were increased by even greater amounts.

species preferred as food. These effects add several novel eco-
systems to the landscape.     

 These  influences  of  beavers  on  landscape  structure  once 
shaped the face of entire continents. At one time, beavers modi-
fied  nearly  all  the  temperate  stream  valleys  in  the  Northern 
Hemisphere. The range of beavers in North America extended 
from arctic tundra to the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts of 
northern  Mexico,  a  range  of  approximately  15  million  km 2 . 
Before European colonization, the North American beaver pop-
ulation numbered 60 to 400 million individuals. However, fur 
trappers eliminated beavers from much of their historical range 
and  nearly  drove  them  to  extinction.  With  protection,  North 
American  beaver  populations  are  recovering  and  large  areas 
once again show the influence of beavers on landscape structure. 
 Carol  Johnston  and  Robert  Naiman  and  their  colleagues 
have carefully documented the substantial effects of beavers on 
landscape structure (e.g., Naiman et al. 1994). Much of their 
work  has  focused  on  the  effects  of  beavers  on  the  298  km 2  
Kabetogama  Peninsula  in  Voyageurs  National  Park,  Minne-
sota. Following their near extermination, beavers reinvaded the 
Kabetogama  Peninsula  beginning  about  1925.  From  1927  to 
1988 the number of beaver ponds on the peninsula increased 
from 64 to 834, a change in pond density from 0.2 to 3.0 per 
square kilometer. Over this 63-year period, the area of new eco-
systems created by beavers, including beaver ponds, wet mead-
ows, and moist meadows, increased from 200 ha, about 1% of 
the peninsula, to 2,661 ha, about 13% of the peninsula. Forag-
ing by beavers altered another 12% to 15% of upland areas. 

 Beaver  activity  has  changed  the  Kabetogama  Peninsula 
from  a  landscape  dominated  by  boreal  forest  to  a  complex 
mosaic of ecosystems.  Figure 21.25  shows how beavers have 
changed  a  45  km 2   catchment  on  the  peninsula. These  maps 
show that, between 1940 and 1986, beavers increased land-
scape complexity within this catchment. Similar changes have 
occurred over nearly the entire peninsula.   

 Naiman and his colleagues quantified the effects of beaver 
over 214 km 2 , or 72%, of the Kabetogama Peninsula. Within 
this area, there are about 2,763 ha of low-lying area that can be 
impounded by beavers. In 1927, the majority of the landscape,

 Naiman and his colleagues offer three possible explana-
tions for increased ion and nutrient storage in this landscape: 
(1)  beaver  ponds  and  their  associated  meadows  may  trap 
materials  eroding  from  the  surrounding  landscape,  (2)  the 
rising waters of the beaver ponds may have captured nutri-
ents formerly held in forest vegetation, and (3) the habitats 
created  by  beavers  may  have  altered  biogeochemical  pro-
cesses  in  a  way  that  promotes  nutrient  retention. Whatever 
the  precise  mechanisms,  beaver  activity  has  substantially 
altered landscape structure and processes on the Kabetogama 
Peninsula.  

  Fire and the Structure 
of a Mediterranean Landscape 
 Fire  contributes  to  the  structure  of  landscapes  ranging  from 
tropical savanna to boreal forest. However, fire plays a partic-
ularly prominent role in regions with a Mediterranean climate. 
As we saw in chapter 2, terrestrial ecosystems in regions with 
Mediterranean climates, which support Mediterranean wood-
lands  and  shrublands,  are  subject  to  frequent  burning.  Hot, 
dry summers combined with vegetation rich in essential oils 
create ideal conditions for fires, which can be easily ignited 
by lightning or humans. In regions with a Mediterranean cli-
mate, fire is responsible for a great deal of landscape structure 
and change. 

 Richard  Minnich  (1983)  used  satellite  photos  to  recon-
struct the fire history of southern California and northern Baja 
California,  Mexico,  from  1971  to  1980,  and  found  that  the 
landscapes of both areas consist of a patchwork of new and 
old burns. Though these regions experience similar Mediterra-
nean climates and support similar natural vegetation, their fire 
histories diverged significantly in the early twentieth century. 
For  centuries,  natural  lightning-caused  fires  burned,  some-
times for months, until they went out naturally. In addition, 
Spanish and Anglo-American residents would set fire to the 
land routinely to improve grazing for cattle and sheep. Then, 
early in the twentieth century, various government agencies in

southern California began to suppress fires in order to protect 
property within an increasingly urbanized landscape. 

 Minnich  proposed  that  the  different  fire  histories  of 
southern California and northern Baja California might pro-
duce landscapes of different structure. He suggested that fire 
suppression  allowed  more  biomass  to  accumulate  and  set 
the stage for large, uncontrollable fires. His specific hypoth-
esis was that the average area burned by wildfires would be 
greater in southern California. 

 Minnich  tested  his  hypothesis  using  satellite  images 
taken from 1972 to 1980 ( fig. 21.27 ). He found that between 
1972 and 1980 the total area burned in the two regions was 
fairly similar ( fig. 21.28 ). However, the size of burns differed 
significantly between the two regions. The frequency of small 
burns below 1,000 ha was higher in northern Baja  California, 
while  large  burns  above  3,000  ha  were  more  frequent  in 
southern California. Consequently, median burn size in south-
ern California, 3,500 ha, was over twice that observed in Baja 
California, 1,600 ha ( see fig. 21.28 ).

 In this section, we have seen how geological processes, 
climate,  the  activities  of  organisms,  and  fire  can  contribute 
to  landscape  structure  and  change.  Because  human  activity 
has often greatly altered landscape structure, there is growing 
interest in landscape restoration. That is the subject that we 
take up in the Applications section. 

  Concept 21.3 Review 

1.   How are “landscape engineers” similar to keystone spe-

cies? How are they different?  

2.   Can a dominant species of tree in a forest or coral on a coral 

reef (see fig. 17.17, p. 386) be an ecosystem engineer?  

3.   The patterns shown in  figure 21.28  support Minnich’s 
hypothesis  that  fire  protection  in  southern  California 
would produce a difference in median burn area. How-
ever, do these results show conclusively that the differ-
ences in burn area in the two regions are the result of 
different fire management practices?

 Restoring a Riverine Landscape

 Rivers and their floodplains form a complex, highly dynamic 
landscape  that  includes  river,  riparian  forest,  marsh,  oxbow 
lake, and wet meadow ecosystems. Historically, these ecosys-
tems actively exchanged organisms, inorganic nutrients, and 
organic energy sources. The key linkage between these land-
scape elements was periodic flooding. 

 Floods  connect  rivers  with  their  associated  floodplain 
ecosystems,  and  the  rates  and  timing  of  many  ecologi-
cal  processes  are  determined  by  the  “flood-pulse”  (Junk, 
 Bayley,  and  Sparks  1989;  Bayley  1995).  Floods  determine 
the  form  of  the  riverine  landscape  by  depositing  silt  on 
floodplains,  isolating  oxbow  lakes,  and  creating  new  river 
channels. Floods increase rates of decomposition and nutri-
ent  cycling  in  floodplain  environments.  Many  species  of 
river fish use floodplains as spawning and nursery grounds 
and  many  riparian  plants  require  flooding  for  germination 
and establishment. 

 Over  the  past  century,  water  management  by  building 
dams,  channelizing  rivers,  constructing  flood  levees,  and 
diverting water for irrigation has cut the historic connections 

between most rivers and their floodplains. However, there is 
growing recognition of the value of these historic connections 
for  maintaining  water  quality  and  for  supporting  biological 
diversity. Consequently, governments all over the world have 
begun programs of river restoration. Some of the most ambi-
tious of these projects focus on the Rhine River in Germany 
and the Kissimmee River in south Florida, which we discuss 
in the following section.   

  Riverine Restoration: 
The Kissimmee River 
 The  Kissimmee  River  flows  from  its  headwaters  in  Lake 
Kissimmee southward into Lake Okeechobee. The historical 
landscape of the Kissimmee River included a highly braided, 
meandering channel that flowed approximately 166 km from 
headwaters to mouth. Periodic flooding by the river flooded 
its 1.5 to 3 km wide floodplain, inundating several different 
types of ecosystems, including oxbow lakes and four major 
types  of  marshes. The  river  flooded  approximately  94%  of 
its  floodplain  during  about  half  of  the  year.  During  some 
periods the Kissimmee floodplain would remain completely 
flooded  for  2  to  4  years.  The  Kissimmee  flooded  more  of 
its floodplain and for longer periods than any other river in 
North America. 

 Before  flood  control,  the  relationship  of  the  Kissim-
mee River to its floodplain was similar to that of large tropi-
cal rivers, such as the Amazon River in South America and 
Niger River in Africa. This tight linkage between river and 
floodplain was very important to the birds, fish, and aquatic 
invertebrates  of  the  Kissimmee.  The  landscape  supported 
48  species  of  fish,  16  species  of  wading  birds,  22  species 
of ducks and other water birds, and hundreds of species of 
aquatic  invertebrates,  the  lives  of  most  of  which  were  tied 
to the Kissimmee’s annual flooding cycle. The flood pulse 
was also critical to nutrient cycling and to maintaining high 
water quality. 

 Rapid human population growth in the early 1940s, fol-
lowed  by  extensive  flooding  that  lasted  from  1947  to  1948, 
created pressures for flood control on the Kissimmee River. 
From 1962 to 1970, the river was converted from a braided, 
meandering river to a series of five reservoirs connected by 
canals  ( fig.  21.29 ).  Flow  out  of  Lake  Kissimmee  and  along 
the canals is controlled by six separate flow control structures. 
These flood control measures transformed the 166 km mean-
dering Kissimmee River into a canal 9 m deep, 100 m wide, 
and 90 km long ( fig. 21.30 ). They also eliminated 14,000 ha 
of wetlands within the Kissimmee landscape. Most of the for-
mer  river  channels  were  either  filled  in  by  materials  dug  to 
form the canal system, dried out, or reduced to such low flows 
that  they  were  choked  by  vegetation,  especially  by  intro-
duced species of floating water plants such as water hyacinth, 
Eichhornia crassipes.        

 These  environmental  changes  had  a  severe  impact 
on  many  populations  and  ecosystem  processes.  Winter-
ing  waterfowl  populations  declined  by  92%.  The  popula-
tion of largemouth bass, an important sport fish, declined. 

480 

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

Largemouth  bass  were  replaced  by  nongame  species  that 
tolerate low oxygen concentrations. Populations of riverine 
invertebrates  were  reduced  and  replaced  by  invertebrates 
of  lake  and  pond  ecosystems.  Eliminating  the  flood  pulse 
greatly reduced the exchange of nutrients, organic matter, 
and organisms between the river and floodplain ecosystems. 

Stabilized water levels nearly eliminated spawning and for-
aging  habitats  for  adult  fish  and  refuge  and  rearing  areas 
for larval and juvenile fish. Ecologists estimated that dry-
ing the floodplain wetlands along the Kissimmee resulted 
in  a  loss  of  6  billion  freshwater  prawns,   Palaemonetes 
paludosus.

includes refilling approximately 35 km of artificial channel to restore

 The  public  soon  recognized  the  negative  ecological 
consequences  of  the  Kissimmee  flood  control  project  and 
exerted political pressure to restore the river to premanage-
ment conditions (Cummins and Dahm 1995; Koebel 1995; 
Toth et al. 1995; Dahm et al. 1995). These pressures even-
tually produced the Kissimmee restoration project. A lim-
ited test restoration was conducted from 1984 to 1990. The 
project included fluctuating water levels within one of the 
reservoirs  to  return  flooding  to  about  1,080  ha  of  flood-
plain.  Water  managers  built  weirs  on  the  canal  to  divert 
water  into  remnant  river  channels  and  created  a  series  of 
marshes. 

 The Kissimmee River floodplain landscape showed dra-
matic responses to these initial restoration efforts. Native veg-
etation that had historically dominated the system responded 
positively,  while  exotic  vegetation  and  vegetation  from 
uplands showed signs of decline. Flow through remnant chan-
nels transported accumulated detritus into the canal system. 
Riverine  invertebrates  recolonized  remnant  river  channels, 
and fish quickly moved into the flooded areas. Fish requiring 
higher  levels  of  dissolved  oxygen  again  dominated  restored 
areas. Large numbers of waterfowl also quickly moved into 
the new marshes. 

 In response to these encouraging results, water manag-
ers began a far more ambitious plan to restore a large por-
tion of the Kissimmee River system. The restoration project 
will  take  about  15  years  and  restore  about  70  km  of  river 
channels  to  a  more  natural  condition  and  about  11,000  ha 
of wetlands. The projected costs of repairing the damage to 
the Kissimmee landscape is $500 million. The Kissimmee 
restoration will consist of two parts. First, water managers 
will regulate water in the headwaters of the river to include 
a more natural flood pulse. Second, much of the Kissimmee 
canal  will  be  eliminated  and  water  will  be  returned  to  the 
braided river channels. Several kilometers of the  Kissimmee 
canal  will  be  filled  ( fig.  21.31 ),  and  some  water  control 
structures  will  be  removed.  In  addition,  14  km  of  river 

channel that were filled during the excavation of the canal 
will be excavated.   

 The  first  phase  of  the  Kissimmee  River  restoration 
was completed in 2001. This phase included filling 12 km 
of the 90 km drain canal, which required 9.2 million m 3  of 
earth  fill.  Restoration  crews  also  constructed  two  sections 
of new river channel totaling 2.4 km in length and reestab-
lished 24 contiguous km of river. They also used explosives 
to demolish one of the main water control structures on the 
drain canal. 

 The keys to this restoration effort involve restoration of 
landscape structure and landscape processes. First, water man-
agers will restore historical landscape structure by restoring 
the complex channel network and reestablishing the historic 
floodplain  marshes.  Second,  they  will  restore  the  dominant 
landscape  process,  the  historic  flood  pulse.  Restoration  of 
flooding will reestablish the hydrologic connections between 
the river and floodplain ecosystems, connections that promote 
exchanges  of  nutrients,  energy,  and  species  among  ecosys-
tems in the Kissimmee River landscape. 

 This  is  the  largest  landscape  restoration  project  ever 
undertaken.  The  restoration  of  the  Kissimmee  River  land-
scape  is  also  one  of  the  largest  ecological  experiments  ever 
conducted  and  will  be  a  significant  test  of  the  predictive 
ability  of  ecological  theory. The  project  includes  models  of 
expected  population,  community,  ecosystem,  and  landscape 
responses  as  well  as  careful  monitoring  of  those  responses. 
As  it  goes  forward,  ecologists  will  watch  to  see  how  well 
their predictions compare to the actual responses of the sys-
tem. The Kissimmee River restoration project is linked to an 
even larger project: the Comprehensive Everglades Restora-
tion  Plan,  or  CERP,  which  encompasses  nearly  47,000  km 2  
of central and southern Florida. CERP will take an estimated 
30 years to complete at a cost of nearly $8 billion. The lessons 
learned on the Kissimmee River and in CERP will help with 
future efforts aimed at restoring the structure and processes of 
damaged landscapes.

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

   Summary 

 A landscape is a heterogeneous area composed of several eco-
systems.  The  ecosystems  making  up  a  landscape  generally 
form a mosaic of visually distinctive patches. These patches 
are called  landscape elements. Landscape ecology  is the study 
of landscape structure and processes. 

  Landscape  structure  includes  the  size,  shape,  com-
position,  number,  and  position  of  patches,  or  landscape 
elements,  in  a  landscape.    Most  questions  in  landscape 
ecology require that ecologists quantify landscape structure. 
Until recently, however, geometry, which means “earth mea-
surement,”  could  offer  only  rough  approximations  of  com-
plex landscape structure. Edge effects and ecotones increase 
on a landscape as habitats are fragmented. Today, an area of 
mathematics called fractal geometry can be used to quantify 
the  structure  of  complex  natural  shapes.  One  of  the  find-
ings of fractal geometry is that the length of the perimeter of 
complex shapes depends upon the size of the device used to 
measure the perimeter. One implication of this result is that 
organisms of different sizes may use the environment in very 
different ways. 

  Landscape  structure  influences  processes  such  as 
the flow of energy, materials, and species across a land-
scape.    Landscape ecologists have proposed that landscape 
structure, especially the size, number, and isolation of habitat 
patches, can influence the movement of organisms between 
potentially  suitable  habitats.  The  group  of  subpopulations 
living  on  such  habitat  patches  make  up  a  metapopulation. 
Studies  of  the  movements  of  small  mammals  in  a  prairie 
landscape  show  that  a  smaller  proportion  of  individuals 
moves in more fragmented landscape but that the individuals 
that do move will move farther. The local population density 
of the Glanville fritillary butterfly,  Melitaea cinxia,  is lower 
on larger and on isolated habitat patches. Small populations 
of this butterfly and desert bighorn sheep are more vulnera-
ble to local extinction. Habitat corridors have been shown to 
increase rates of movement among isolated habitat patches. 
The  source  of  water  for  lakes  in  a Wisconsin  lake  district 

is  determined  by  their  positions  in  the  landscape,  which 
in  turn  determine  their  hydrologic  and  chemical  responses 
to drought. 

  Landscapes  are  structured  and  change  in  response 
to geological processes, climate, activities of organisms, 
and fire.    Geological features produced by processes such 
as volcanism, sedimentation, and erosion interact with cli-
mate  to  provide  a  primary  source  of  landscape  structure. 
In the Sonoran Desert, plant distributions map clearly onto 
soils  of  different  ages  and  form  a  vegetative  mosaic  that 
closely  matches  soil  mosaics.  This  mosaic  will  gradually 
shift as geological processes and climate gradually change 
the soil mosaic. While geological processes and climate set 
the basic template for landscape structure, the activities of 
organisms (ecosystem engineers), from plants to elephants, 
can  be  an  additional  source  of  landscape  structure  and 
change.  Economically  motivated  human  activity  changes 
the structure of landscapes all over the globe. Beavers can 
quickly change landscape structure and processes over large 
regions. Fire contributes to the structure of landscapes rang-
ing  from  tropical  savanna  to  boreal  forest.  However,  fire 
plays a particularly prominent role in regions with a Medi-
terranean climate. 

 Because  human  activity  has  often  altered  landscape 
structure and processes in undesirable ways, there is growing 
pressure  and  interest  in  landscape  restoration.  Some  of  the 
most ambitious current restoration efforts focus on the res-
toration of riverine landscapes. Rivers and their floodplains 
form  a  complex,  highly  dynamic  landscape  that  includes 
river,  riparian  forest,  marsh,  oxbow  lake,  and  wet  meadow 
ecosystems.  Over  the  past  century,  water  management  by 
building dams, channelizing rivers, constructing flood levees, 
and diverting water for irrigation has cut the historic connec-
tions  between  most  rivers  and  their  floodplains. The  resto-
ration of the Kissimmee River landscape is also one of the 
largest ecological experiments ever conducted and will be a 
significant test of the predictive ability of ecological theory.

  Review Questions 

     1.  How does landscape ecology differ from ecosystem and com-
munity ecology? What questions might an ecosystem ecologist 
ask about a forest? What questions might a community ecolo-
gist ask about the same forest? Now, what kinds of questions 
would a landscape ecologist ask about a forested landscape?  

    2.  How should the  area  of forest patches in an agricultural land-
scape affect the proportion of bird species in a community that 
are associated with forest edge habitats? How should patch area 
affect the presence of birds associated with forest interiors?  

    3.  The green areas represent forest fragments surrounded by agri-
culture. Landscapes 1 and 2 contain the same total forest area. 

Which landscape, 1 or 2, will contain more forest interior spe-
cies? Explain.    

    4.  How might the  shapes  of forest patches in a landscape affect 
the proportion of birds in the community associated with forest-
edge  habitat?  How  might  patch  shape  affect  the  presence  of 
birds associated with forest interior?  

    5.  Consider the options for preserving patches of riverside forest 
shown in landscapes 3 and 4. Again, the two landscapes contain 
the  same  total  area  of  forest  but  the  patches  in  the  two  land-
scapes differ in shape. Which of the two would be most domi-
nated by forest-edge species?  

Landscape 1

Landscape 2

Landscape 3 

Landscape 4 

    6.  How do the positions of patches in a landscape affect the move-
ment  of  individuals  among  habitat  patches  and  among  portions 
of a metapopulation? Again, consider the hypothetical landscapes 
shown in  question 5 . Which of the two landscapes would promote 
the highest rate of movement of individuals between forest patches? 
Can you think of any circumstances in which it might be desirable 
to reduce the movement of individuals across a landscape? (Hint: 
Think of the potential threat of pathogens that are spread mainly by 
direct contact between individuals within a population.)  

    7.  Use fractal geometry and the niche concept (see chapters 9, 13, 
and 16) to explain why the canopy of a forest should accom-
modate more species of predaceous insects than insectivorous 
birds. Assume that the numbers of bird and predaceous insect 
species are limited by competition. (Hint: Milne’s study [1993] 
of barnacles and bald eagles on Admiralty Island should pro-
vide a beginning for your argument.)  

    8.  Analyses such as Milne’s comparison (1993) of bald eagles and 
barnacles  demonstrate  that  organisms  of  different  sizes  inter-
act with the environment at very different spatial scales. With 
this in mind consider the experiments of Diffendorfer and col-
leagues  (1995)  on  the  influence  of  habitat  fragmentation  on 
movement  patterns  of  small  mammals.  Think  about  the  size 
of their experimental study area (see  fig. 21.10 ). How might a 
manipulation of this size have affected the movements of prairie 
birds? How would their manipulation have affected the move-
ments of ground-dwelling beetles?  

    9.  How  do  the  activities  of  animals  affect  landscape  heteroge-
neity? You might use either beaver or human activity as your 
model. What parallels can you think of between the influence of 
animal activity on landscape heterogeneity and the intermediate 
disturbance hypothesis? Which is concerned with the effect of 
disturbance on species diversity?

 22.2  Outline some of the research topics that are part of 

geographic ecology.

  G eographic ecology began on June 5, 1799, as Alexan-

der von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland sailed out of 
the port of Coruña in northwest Spain.   Their small 
Spanish ship managed to slip past a British naval blockade 
and  sail  on,  first  to  the  Canary  Islands  and  then  to  South 
America.  Humboldt  was  a  Prussian  engineer  and  scien-
tist  and  Bonpland  was  a  French  botanist.  Humboldt  came 
equipped  with  the  finest  scientific  instruments  of  the  time 

 

Chapter 22

and was prepared to systematically survey the lands that he 
and Bonpland would visit. He wrote a letter to a friend a few 
hours before his ship left port outlining his purpose for the 
expedition: “I shall try to find out how the forces of nature 
interreact  upon  one  another  and   how  the  geographic  envi-
ronment influences plant and animal life  [emphasis added].” 
 Humboldt  and  Bonpland  carried  passports  issued  by  the 
court  of  King  Carlos  IV  of  Spain,  giving  them  permission  to 
conduct scientific studies throughout the Spanish Empire, which 
then stretched from California to Texas in North America and 
south to the tip of South America. They had complete access to 
a vast area of the earth’s surface that was essentially unexplored 
scientifically, and they put that access to productive use. Because 
their  discoveries  were  so  numerous  and  their  explorations  so 
thorough, Simón Bolívar, the liberator of most of Spanish Amer-
ica, referred to Humboldt as “the discoverer of the New World.” 
 Humboldt’s  expedition  was  one  of  the  most   ambitious 
scientific explorations of the age (Helfrich 2004). During the 
course of their expedition, Humboldt and Bonpland traveled 
nearly  10,000  km  through  South  and  North America.  They 
traveled on foot, by canoe, or on horseback, visiting latitudes 
ranging between 12 8  S and 52 8  N. They also climbed to nearly 
5,900 m on the slopes of Chimborazo, the highest ascent by 
anyone in history up to that time ( fig. 22.1 ).   

 The physical feats of their expedition, however, never took 
precedent  over  their  scientific  purpose.  For  instance,  on  their 
climb of Chimborazo, they faced the uncertain dangers of high 
altitude. Yet, as blood oozed from their lips and gums, Humboldt 
and Bonpland recorded the altitudinal distributions of plants and 
animals. Later, Humboldt organized their observations of climate 
and plant distributions into ingenious visual representations of 
plant geography. What he did not accomplish, he inspired others 
to do. One of those inspired to follow in Humboldt’s footsteps 
was Charles Darwin. Darwin said that his reading of Humboldt’s 
expedition to South America set the course of his whole life. 

 Robert H. MacArthur (1972) defined    geographic  ecology    
as  the  “search  for  patterns  of  plant  and  animal  life  that  can 
be put on a map.” MacArthur’s map might include an archi-
pelago of islands, a region, or a series of continents. Today we 
would add to MacArthur’s definition that geographic ecology 
is the study of ecological structure and process at large geo-
graphic scales. Though geographic ecology began long before 
MacArthur,  with  explorers  such  as  Humboldt,  Darwin,  and 
Wallace,  MacArthur  put  an  indelible  quantitative  stamp  on 
the field when he and E. O. Wilson published their first mod-
els of island biogeography. 

 The development of geographic ecology continues as new 
generations  of  scientists  equipped  with  a  diversity  of  tools, 

 Figure 22.1    On the slopes of Chimborazo, a 6,310 m high volcanic peak in the Andes Mountains of Ecuador, Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé 
Bonpland meticulously recorded the altitudinal distributions of plants.

both ancient and modern, search for the elusive patterns that 
can be put on maps. There is a heightened sense of urgency, 
however, as the prospect of global climate change presses us 
to  understand  the  forces  controlling  large-scale  patterns  of 
biological diversity and the geographic ranges of species. The 
breadth of geographic ecology is as vast as its subject. Con-
sequently, we concentrate our discussions in this chapter on 
just a few aspects of the field: island biogeography, latitudinal 
patterns of species diversity, and the influences of large-scale 
regional and historical processes on biological diversity.  

   22.1   Area, Isolation, 

and Species Richness 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 22.3  Discuss the relationships of area and isolation to spe-

 22.4 

cies richness on islands.
Interpret graphical evidence for the influences of 
island area and island isolation on species richness.
 22.5  Explain why studies of species richness on oceanic 
islands can be applied to understanding patterns of 
species richness on habitat patches, such as moun-
tains and lakes, on continents.

   On  islands  and  habitat  patches  on  continents,  species 
richness increases with area and decreases with isolation.    
 A quantitative relationship between area and number of spe-
cies was first developed by Olof Arrhenius (1921), a pioneer 
in the area of geographic ecology. Arrhenius made his obser-
vations on islands near Stockholm, Sweden, where he worked 
within several plant communities that he identified by names 
such as  herb–Pinus wood and shore association.  He counted 
the number of species within areas of various sizes and then 
developed  a  mathematical  description  of  the  relationship 
between area sampled and number of plant species. However, 
Arrhenius worked at scales much smaller than the geographic 
focus  of  this  chapter.  To  see  the  first  quantitative  work  on 
geographic patterns, we have to move to a later time. 

  Island Area and Species Richness 
 Frank  Preston  (1962a)  examined  the  relationship  between 
number of species and the area of islands in the West Indies. 
As shown in  figure 22.2  a,  the fewest bird species live on the 
smallest islands and the most on the largest islands, which are 
Cuba  and  Hispaniola.  The  relationship  between  island  area 
and number of species is not just a property of bird assem-
blages.  Sven  Nilsson,  Jan  Bengtsson,  and  Stefan Ås  (1988) 
explored  patterns  of  species  richness  among  woody  plants, 
carabid beetles, and land snails on 17 islands in Lake Mälaren, 
Sweden. The islands ranged in area from 0.6 to 75 ha and all 
were forested. The researchers were careful to choose islands 
that showed few or no signs of human disturbance. One of the 
results of their study was that island area was the best single 
predictor of species richness in all three groups of organisms.

area and number of carabid beetles.   

 When most of us think of islands, the picture that gener-
ally comes to mind is a small bit of land in the middle of an 
ocean. However, many habitats on continents are so isolated 
that they can be considered islands. 

  Habitat Patches on Continents: Mountain Islands 
 The many isolated mountain ranges that extend across the south-
western regions of North America are now continental islands. 
During  the  late  Pleistocene,  11,000  to  15,000  years  ago,  for-
est and woodland habitats extended unbroken from the Rocky 
Mountains to the Sierra Nevada in California. Then as the Pleis-
tocene ended and the climate warmed, forest and alpine habitats 
contracted to the tops of the high mountains scattered across the 
American Southwest. As montane habitats retreated to higher 
elevations, woodland, shrubland, grassland, or desert scrub veg-
etation invaded the lower elevations. As a consequence of these

changes, once-continuous forest and alpine vegetation was con-
verted to a series of island-like habitat patches associated with 
mountains and therefore called  montane.  

 As montane vegetation contracted to mountaintops, mon-
tane  animals  followed.  Mark  Lomolino,  James  H.  Brown, 
and  Russell  Davis  (1989)  studied  the  diversity  of  montane 
mammals on isolated mountains in the American Southwest. 
They focused on the distributions of 26 species of nonflying 
 forest mammals that occur on 27 montane islands. They chose 
mountain ranges that had been studied thoroughly enough so 
that their mammal faunas were well known. The list of spe-
cies,  which  included  shrews,  ermine,  squirrels,  chipmunks, 
and voles, was limited to species that show a strong associa-
tion with montane environments. 

 The team found that montane mammal richness was posi-
tively correlated with habitat area. As  figure 22.3  shows, the 
area of the 27 montane islands ranged from less than 7 km 2  to 

Number of montane 
mammal species increases 
as the area of available

them ranged from 1 to 16. The strongly positive relationship 
between montane area and richness of montane mammal spe-
cies in the American Southwest described by Lomolino and 
his colleagues has held up in the face of repeated testing and 
analysis (Lawlor 1998).    

  Lakes as Islands 
 Lakes can also be considered as habitat islands—aquatic envi-
ronments isolated from other aquatic environments by land. 
However, lakes differ widely in their degree of isolation. Seep-
age lakes, which receive no surface drainage, are completely 
isolated, while drainage lakes, which have stream inlets and/
or outlets, are less isolated (see chapter 21). 

 William Tonn and John Magnuson (1982) studied patterns 
of  species  composition  and  richness  among  fish  inhabiting 
lakes in northern Wisconsin. They focused their research on 
18 lakes in the Northern Highlands Lake District of  Wisconsin 
and  Michigan.  The  study  was  conducted  in  Vilas  County, 
Wisconsin, which includes over 1,300 lakes ( fig. 22.4 ). With 
so  many  lakes  at  their  disposal,  Tonn  and  Magnuson  could 
match  lakes  carefully  for  a  variety  of  characteristics. All  18 
study  lakes  had  similar  bottom  substrates  and  similar  maxi-
mum depths. However, the lakes spanned a considerable range 
of surface area (2.4–89.8 ha). Ten of the lakes were drainage 
lakes or spring fed and eight lakes were seepage lakes. Eight 
lakes had a history of low oxygen content during winter.     

 Tonn and Magnuson collected a total of 23 species, 22 
in summer and 18 in winter. If we combine their winter and 
summer collections on each lake and plot total species rich-
ness against area, there is a significant positive relationship 
(see  fig. 22.4 ). Once again, we see that the number of spe-
cies increases with the area of an insular environment. How-
ever, these researchers worked with a single lake district. Is 
there  a  relationship  between  lake  area  and  diversity  when 
lakes from several regions are included in the analysis? 

 Clyde  Barbour  and  James  H.  Brown  (1974)  studied 
patterns  of  species  richness  across  a  worldwide  sample  of 
70 lakes. The lakes in their sample ranged in area from 0.8 to 
436,000 km 2 , while the number of fish species ranged from

ship between area and fish species richness.   

  Island Isolation and Species Richness 
 There  is  often  a  negative  relationship  between  the  isolation 
of an island and the number of species it supports. However, 
because  organisms  differ  substantially  in  dispersal  rates,  an 
island that is very isolated for one group of organisms may be 
completely accessible to another group. 

  Marine Islands 
 Robert  MacArthur  and  Edward  O. Wilson  (1963)  found  evi-
dence that isolation reduces bird diversity on Pacific islands. In 
 figure 22.5 , islands less than 800 km from New Guinea, a poten-
tial source of colonists to the other islands, are represented by 
gold dots; islands greater than 3,200 km from New Guinea are 
represented by red dots; islands at intermediate distances from 

For a given area, islands near New 
Guinea support more bird species 
than those farther away.

New Guinea are represented by blue dots. How does  figure 22.5  
indicate an effect of isolation on species richness? Compare the 
relative numbers of species on islands of approximately equal 
area  but  that  lie  at  different  distances  from  New  Guinea.  On 
average, those closest to New Guinea support a larger number 
of bird species than those at intermediate or far distances.   

 Comparative  studies  of  diversity  patterns  on  islands 
remind  us  that  different  organisms  have  markedly  different 
dispersal abilities. Mark Williamson (1981) summarized the 
data for the relationship between island area and species rich-
ness for various groups of organisms inhabiting the Azore and 
Channel Islands. The Azore Islands lie approximately 1,600 km 
west of the Iberian Peninsula, while the Channel Islands are 
very near the coast of France. While vastly different in dis-
tance  from  mainland  areas,  both  island  groups  experience 
moist temperate climates and have biotas that are of European 
origin.  Consequently,  a  comparison  of  their  biotas  should 
reveal the potential influence of isolation on diversity. 

  Figure 22.6  shows Williamson’s summary of species area 
relationships for ferns and fernlike plants (pteridophytes) and 
land-  and  water-breeding  birds.  Both  groups  of  organisms 
show a positive relationship between island area and diversity 
on both the Channel and Azore Islands. However, while birds 
show a clear influence of isolation on diversity, pteridophytes 
do  not.  Notice  that  bird  species  richness  is  lower  on Azore 
Islands compared to Channel Islands of similar size. Mean-
while, pteridophyte diversity is similar on islands of compa-
rable size in the two island groups.     

 These  differences  in  pattern  show  that  the  1,600  km  of 
ocean between the Azore Islands and the European mainland 
reduces  the  diversity  of  birds  but  not  pteridophytes.  These 
differences in the effect of isolation reflect differences in the 
dispersal rates of these organisms. While land birds must fly 
across water barriers, pteridophytes produce large quantities 
of  light  spores  that  are  easily  dispersed  by  wind.  One  spe-
cies  of  pteridophyte,  bracken  fern,  has  naturally  established 
populations  throughout  the  globe,  including  New  Guinea, 
Britain,  Hawaii,  and  New  Mexico.  When  we  consider  the 
potential effects of isolation on diversity, we must also con-
sider the  dispersal capabilities of the study organisms.  

The distant Azore Islands support fewer 
bird species than the Channel Islands, 
which are near the coast of Europe.

In contrast, distance does not 
reduce the diversity of ferns and 
their allies on the Azore Islands.

  Isolation and Habitat Islands 
on Continents 
 Has an isolation effect been observed across habitat islands on 
continents?  Lomolino,  Brown,  and  Davis  (1989),  whom  we 
have already discussed, found a strong negative relationship 
between isolation and the number of montane mammal spe-
cies living on mountaintops across the  American Southwest. 
They measured isolation as the distance of a mountain range 
from potential sources of colonists. Colonists can immigrate 
from the southern Rocky Mountains, with 23 montane mam-
mal  species,  or  from  the  Mogollon  Rim,  with  16  montane 
mammal species. For mountains closer to the southern Rocky 
Mountains, isolation was measured as the distance from the 
mountain island to the nearest point of the Rocky Mountains. 
If the mountain was closer to the Mogollon Rim, the research-
ers  used  a  composite  measure  of  distance  that  weighted  the 
distances to the Mogollon Rim and the southern Rocky Moun-
tains by the diversities of their montane mammals.  Figure 22.7  
shows the results of their analysis, which shows a strong nega-
tive relationship between isolation (distance to species source 
areas) and species richness of montane mammals. The analy-
sis clearly shows that both area and isolation affect the diver-
sity of mammals on habitat patches on continents.     

 What does the negative effect of isolation on these moun-
tain mammal populations indicate about local assemblages? 
The  higher  diversity  of  mountain  islands  near  the  southern 
Rocky Mountains and/or to the Mogollon Rim suggests that 
montane mammals continue to disperse across the interven-
ing woodlands and grasslands. Without immigration, near and 
far  mountains  of  equal  area  would  support  similar  numbers 
of  montane  mammal  species.  This  result  suggests  that  the 
diversity of organisms on islands is maintained by a dynamic 
process that involves ongoing colonization. A dynamic rather 
than a static view of island diversity is the foundation of an 
equilibrium model of island biogeography that we discuss in 
the next section. 

Number of montane mammal 
species declines with 
increasing distance from 
source of potential colonists.

  Concept 22.1 Review 

1.   In  chapter  21  we  discussed  the  influences  of   habitat 
fragmentation from the perspective of populations (see 
figs. 21.11 and 21.12). Drawing from the information in 
this section, how do you think fragmentation will affect 
species  richness—for  instance,  the  number  of  bird 
 species living in forest fragments?  

2.   In   figure  22.7 ,  the  number  of  mammal  species  on  the 
isolated mountain ranges varies greatly for a given dis-
tance from large montane areas, for instance, at a dis-
tance of 150 km. What is the likely source of much of 
this variation?       

  22.2   The Equilibrium Model of Island 

Biogeography  
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 22.6  Summarize the equilibrium model of island 

biogeography.

 22.7  Explain how the observation of species turnover on 
the California Channel Islands supports the equilib-
rium model of island biogeography.

 22.8  Discuss experimental evidence in support of the 

equilibrium model of island biogeography.

  Species richness on islands can be modeled as a dynamic 
balance between immigration and extinction of species. 
The  examples  we  just  reviewed  show  clear  relationships 
between  species  richness  and  island  area  and  isolation. 
When  confronted  with  such  a  pattern,  scientists  look  for 
explanatory mechanisms. What mechanisms might increase 
species  richness  on  large  islands  and  reduce  richness  on 
small  and  isolated  islands?  MacArthur  and Wilson  (1963, 
1967) proposed a model that explained patterns of species 
diversity on islands as the result of a balance between rates 
of  immigration  and  extinction  ( fig.  22.8 ).  This  model  is 
called the    equilibrium model of island biogeography    .    

  Figure 22.8  shows that the model presents rates of immi-
gration  and  extinction  as  a  function  of  numbers  of  species 
on  islands.  How  might  rates  of  immigration  and  extinction 
be  influenced  by  the  numbers  of  species  on  an  island?  To 
answer this question, we need to understand what MacArthur 
and  Wilson  meant  by  rates  of  immigration  and  extinction. 
They  defined  the   rate  of  immigration   as  the  rate  of  arrival 
of  new  species on an island.  Rate of extinction  was the rate 
at which species went extinct on the island.  MacArthur and 
Wilson reasoned that rates of immigration would be highest 
on a new island with no organisms, since every species that 
arrived  at  the  island  would  be  new.  Then  as  species  began 
to  accumulate  on  an  island,  the  rate  of  immigration  would 
decline, since fewer and fewer arrivals would be new species. 
They called the point at which the immigration line touches 

490 

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

According to the equilibrium model of island biogeography, the 
number of species on an island is determined by a balance 
between species immigration and extinction.

The equilibrium model of island biogeography explained variation in 
number of species on islands by the influences of isolation and area 
on rates of immigration and extinction.

The rate of immigration of new 
species to an island decreases as 
the number of species on the 
island increases.

Meanwhile, the rate of species 
extinction on the island 
increases as the number of 
species present increases.

The model predicted higher 
rates of immigration to islands 
nearer a source of colonists.

The model predicted 
high rates of extinction 
on small islands.

the horizontal axis  P  because it is the point representing the 
entire “pool” of species that might immigrate to the island. 

 How  might  numbers  of  species  on  an  island  affect  the 
rate of extinction? MacArthur and Wilson predicted that the 
rate of extinction would rise with increasing numbers of spe-
cies on an island for three reasons: (1) the presence of more 
species  creates  a  larger  pool  of  potential  extinctions,  (2)  as 
the number of species on an island increases, the population 
size of each must diminish, and (3) as the number of species 
on an island increases, the potential for competitive interac-
tions between species will increase. 

 Since  the  immigration  line  falls  and  the  extinction  line 
rises as number of species increases, the two lines must cross 
as shown in  figure 22.8 . What is the significance of the point 
where  the  two  lines  cross?  The  point  where  the  two  lines 
cross  predicts  the  number  of  species  that  will  occur  on  an 
island. Thus,  the  equilibrium  model  represents  the  diversity 
of species on islands as a result of a dynamic balance between 
immigration and extinction. 

 MacArthur and Wilson used the equilibrium model to pre-
dict how island size and isolation should affect rates of immigra-
tion and extinction. They proposed that the rate of immigration 
is mainly determined by an island’s distance from a source of 
immigrants, for example, the distance of an oceanic island from 
a mainland. They proposed that rates of extinction on islands 
would be determined mainly by island size. These predictions 
are represented in  figure 22.9 . Notice that the figure predicts 
that large, near islands will support the greatest number of spe-
cies, whereas small, far islands will support the lowest number 

S small, far

The model explains the 
low number of species 
on small, isolated islands.

The model also accounts 
for high number of species 
on large, near islands.

Island distance and area and rates of immigration and 

of  species.  The  model  predicts  that  small,  near  islands  and 
large, far islands will support intermediate numbers of species. 
   The predictions of the equilibrium model of island bio-
geography are consistent with the patterns of island diversity 
reviewed  in  the  previous  section.  Large  islands  hold  more 
species than small islands, and islands near sources of immi-
grants  hold  more  species  than  islands  far  from  sources  of 
immigrants. We should expect the equilibrium model to be 
consistent  with  known  variation  in  species  richness  across 
islands, since MacArthur and Wilson designed their model to 
explain the known patterns. Did the equilibrium model make 
any new predictions? The main new predictions were (1) that 
island diversity is the outcome of a highly dynamic balance 
between  immigration  and  extinction  and  (2)  that  the  rates 
of immigration and extinction are determined mainly by the 
isolation and area of islands. In other words, the equilibrium 
model predicts that the species composition on islands is not 
static but changes over time. Ecologists call this change in 
species composition    species turnover    .   

   Species Turnover on Islands 
 Turnover of bird species was demonstrated on the  California 
Channel  Islands  by  Jared  Diamond  (1969).  Diamond  sur-
veyed  the  birds  of  the  nine  California  Channel  Islands  in

Figure 22.10   Extinction and immigration of bird species on the California Channel Islands between 1917 and 1968 (data from Diamond 1969). 

1968, approximately 50 years after an earlier survey by A. B. 
Howell. The islands range in area from less than 3 to 249 km 2  
and  lie  12  to  61  km  from  the  coast  of  southern   California 
( fig. 22.10 ). Howell had thoroughly censused all of the islands 
except for San Miguel and Santa Rosa Islands, where he had 
difficulty  getting  permission  to  do  bird  surveys.  In  his  later 
study, Diamond had full access to all the islands and was able 
to survey all land and water birds.     

 The  results  of  Diamond’s  study  support  the  equilibrium 
model  of  island  biogeography.  The  number  of  bird  species 
inhabiting  the  California  Channel  Islands  remained  almost 
constant over the 50 years between the two censuses. However, 
this stability in numbers of species was the result of an approxi-
mately equal number of immigrations and extinctions on each 
of the islands (see  fig. 22.10 ). Diamond’s study is an excellent 
example of how theory can guide field ecology. He discovered 
the dynamics underlying the diversity of birds on the California 
Channel  Islands  because  he  went  out  to  test  the  MacArthur-
Wilson equilibrium model of island biogeography. Additional 
insights into this model have been provided by experiments.  

  Experimental Island Biogeography 
 As  Diamond  conducted  his  surveys  of  the  California  Chan-
nel  Islands,  Daniel  Simberloff  and  Edward  O. Wilson  were 
engaged  in  experimental  studies  of  mangrove  islands  in  the 
Florida  Keys  (Wilson  and  Simberloff  1969;  Simberloff  and 
Wilson  1969).  The  Florida  Keys  support  very  large  stands 
of  mangroves,  which  are  dominated  by  the  red  mangrove, 
  Rhizophora  mangle.   Many  of  these  stands  occur  as  small 
islands  that  lie  hundreds  of  meters  from  the  nearest  large 
patch of mangroves ( fig. 22.11 ). Simberloff and Wilson chose 
eight of these small mangrove islands for their experimental 
study.  Their  study  islands  were  roughly  circular  and  varied 
from 11 to 18 m in diameter and 5 to 10 m in height. The dis-
tance of islands from large areas of mangroves that could act 
as a source of colonists varied from 2 to 1,188 m.     

 The main fauna inhabiting the small mangrove islands of 
the  Florida  Keys  are  arthropods,  chiefly  insects.  Simberloff 
and  Wilson  estimated  that  of  the  approximately  4,000  spe-
cies of insects in the Florida Keys, about 500 species inhabit 

492 

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

number in the thousands, are convenient places to test the equilibrium 
model of island biogeography. 

mangroves. Of these 500 species, about 75 commonly live on 
small mangrove islands. In addition to insects, the mangroves 
supported  15  species  of  spiders  and  other  arthropods.  The 
number of insect species on the experimental islands averaged 
20 to 40 and the number of spider species ranged from 2 to 10. 
 Simberloff and Wilson chose two of the islands to act as 
controls and designated the six others as experimental islands. 
They carefully surveyed all the islands prior to defaunating the 
experimental islands. The islands were defaunated by enclos-
ing  them  with  a  tent  and  then  fumigating  with  methyl  bro-
mide. Fumigating was done at night to avoid heat damage to 
the mangrove trees. Simberloff and Wilson examined the trees 
immediately after fumigating and found that, with the possible 
exception of some wood-boring insect larvae, all arthropods had 
been killed. They followed recolonization by periodically cen-
susing the arthropods on each island for approximately 1 year. 
 The  number  of  species  recorded  on  the  two  control 
islands was virtually identical at the beginning and end of the 
experiment. Though the number did not change significantly 
over the period of study, Simberloff and Wilson reported that 
species  composition  changed  considerably.  In  other  words, 
there had been species turnover on the control islands, a result 
consistent with the equilibrium model of island biogeography. 
 The equilibrium model was also supported by the recoloni-
zation studies of the experimental islands. Following defaunation, 
the number of arthropod species increased on all of the islands. 
All the islands, except the farthest island, eventually supported 
about the same number of species as they did prior to defauna-
tion ( fig. 22.12 ). Again, however, the composition of arthropods 
on  the  islands  was  substantially  different,  indicating  species 
turnover. Species turnover is also indicated by the colonization 
histories of individual islands, which include many examples of 
species appearing and then disappearing from the community.   

 Island colonization can be followed either by removing 
the organisms from existing islands, as Simberloff and Wilson 
did when they defaunated their mangrove islands, or by creat-
ing new islands. Many new islands formed in a large lake in 
southern Sweden when the level of the lake was dropped at 
the end of the nineteenth century. Fortunately, some biologists 

The number of species on the near 
island soon equaled predefaunation 
levels, while the number of species 
on the far island was still below the  
original level.

recognized  the  rare  opportunity  offered  by  the  new  islands 
and studied their colonization by plants. These studies have 
continued for a century.  

  Colonization of New Islands by Plants 
 The  site  of  this  long-term  study  is  Lake  Hjälmaren,  which 
covers about 478 km 2  in Sweden ( fig. 22.13 ). The level of Lake 
Hjälmaren  was  lowered  1.3  m  between  1882  and  1886  and 
exposed many new islands. The first plant surveys of the new 
islands were conducted in 1886, and the islands were surveyed 
again  in  1892,  from  1903  to  1904,  from  1927  to  1928,  and 
from 1984 to 1985. Håkan Rydin and Sven-Olov Borgegård 
(1988)  summarized  the  earlier  surveys  of  these  new  islands 
and  conducted  their  own  surveys  in  1985.  The  result  was  a 
unique long-term record of the colonization of 40 islands.     

 The study islands vary in area from 65 m 2  to over 25,000 m 2  
and support a limited diversity of plants. Rydin and Borgegård 
estimated  that  approximately  700  species  of  plants  occur 
around Lake Hjälmaren. Of these 700 plant species, the num-
ber recorded on individual islands during the first century of 
their existence varied from 0 to 127. As expected, this variation 
in species richness correlated positively with island area over 
the entire history of the islands and accounted for 44% to 85% 
of the variation in species richness among islands. Measures 
of island isolation accounted for 4% to 10% of the variation in 
plant species richness among islands through the 1903–1904 
census. Island isolation did not account for significant varia-
tion in species richness among islands in subsequent censuses. 
 Rydin  and  Borgegård  used  the  censuses  of  30  islands 
to  estimate  rates  of  plant  immigration  and  extinction  (see 
 fig.  22.13 ).  The  historical  record   documents  many   immigra-
tions and extinctions. There was a slight excess of immigrations 
over extinctions on small- and medium-sized islands during the

entire 100 years of record. What do these higher rates of immi-
gration indicate? They show that small and medium islands con-
tinue to accumulate species. In contrast, large islands attained 
approximately equal rates of immigration and extinction some-
time between 1928 and 1985. Over this period, approximately 
30  plants  became  extinct  on  each  large  island  and  another 
30 new species arrived. In other words, it appears that the num-
ber of species may have reached equilibrium on large islands.

biogeography.  Plant  species  richness  on  the  islands  of  Lake 
Hjälmaren,  like  arthropod  richness  on  the  mangrove  islands 
studied by Simberloff and Wilson, appears to be maintained by 
a dynamic interplay between immigration and local extinction. 
Many  studies  support  the  basic  predictions  of  the  equilibrium 
model of island biogeography. However, many questions remain. 
 For  instance,  why  do  larger  islands  support  more  spe-
cies? Is the greater species richness on large islands due to a 
direct effect of area or do large islands support higher species 
richness because they include a greater diversity of habitats? 
Rydin and Borgegård found that measures of habitat diversity 
on the study islands accounted for only 1% to 2% of the varia-
tion  in  plant  species  richness.  However,  they  point  out  that 
while some large islands with few habitats support low num-
bers of plant species, some small islands, with diverse habi-
tats, support higher species richness than would be expected 
on the basis of area alone. The researchers point out that it is 
very difficult to separate the effects of habitat diversity from 
the effects of area. As we shall see in the next example, there is 
at least one experiment that came close to demonstrating that 
species richness on islands can be directly affected by area.  

  Manipulating Island Area 
 Daniel Simberloff (1976) tested the effect of island area on 
species  richness  experimentally.  He  surveyed  the  arthro-
pods  inhabiting  nine  mangrove  islands  that  ranged  in  area 
from  262  to  1,263  m 2 .  The  distance  of  these  islands  from 
large areas of mangrove forest ranged from 2 to 432 m. The 
islands were up to five times the size of the mangrove islands 
that  he  and  Wilson  had  fumigated  in  their  earlier  study  of 
recolonization,  and  therefore  contained  a  larger  number  of 
arthropod species. 

 Simberloff kept one island as a control, while reducing 
the area of the eight other islands by 32% to 76%. Island area 
was reduced during low tide by removing whole sections of 
the islands. Workers cut mangroves off below the high tide 
level and loaded the cut trees and branches on a barge. They 
then moved the cut material away from the island, where they 
sank it into deeper water (green mangrove wood sinks). Sim-
berloff  reduced  the  area  of  four  experimental  islands  twice 
and the area of the other four experimental islands once only. 
 The  results  of  Simberloff’s  experiment  show  a  positive 
relationship  between  area  and  species  richness.  In  all  cases 
where  island  area  was  reduced,  species  richness  decreased 
( fig.  22.14 ).  Meanwhile,  species  richness  on  the  control 
island,  which  was  not  changed  in  area,  increased  slightly. 
Additional insights are offered by the contrasting histories of 
islands whose areas were reduced once and those whose areas 
were reduced twice. For instance, the area of Mud 2 island was 
reduced from 942 to 327 m 2  and the richness of its arthropod 
fauna fell from 79 to 62 species. The area of Mud 2 was not 
reduced  further,  and  its  arthropod  richness  remained  almost 
constant.  Meanwhile,  the  islands  whose  area  was  reduced 
twice  lost  species  with  each  reduction  in  area.  Simberloff’s 
results showed that area itself, without increased habitat het-
erogeneity, has a positive influence on species richness.

  Island Biogeography Update 
 The  equilibrium  theory  of  island  biogeography  has  had  a 
major  influence  on  the  disciplines  of  biogeography  and 
ecology. However, much has been discovered in the 40-plus 
years  since  MacArthur  and  Wilson  proposed  their  theory. 
For instance, James Brown and Astrid Kodric-Brown (1977) 
showed how higher rates of immigration to near islands can 
reduce  extinction  rates.  As  a  consequence,  we  now  know 
that,  contrary  to  the  original  MacArthur-Wilson  model, 
island  distance  from  sources  of  colonists  can  influence 
rates  of  extinction.  Similarly,  Mark  Lomolino  (1990)  also 
extended  the  original  model  when  he  proposed  the  target 
hypothesis,  demonstrating  that  island  area  can  have  a  sig-
nificant effect on rates of immigration to islands. Brown and 
Lomolino (2000) pointed out that we have also discovered 
that species richness is not in equilibrium on many islands. 
In  addition,  we  now  know  that  species  richness  on  islands 
is  affected  by  differences  among  species  groups  in  their 
speciation,  colonization,  and  extinction  rates. And  perhaps 
most  significantly,  area  and  isolation  are  only  two  of  sev-
eral  environmental  factors  that  affect  species  richness  on 
islands. Brown and Lomolino suggest that we may be on the 
eve  of  another  revolution  in  theories  that  will  replace 
the  MacArthur-Wilson model. If so, it will be the result of 
research  largely  inspired  by  their  theory  as  well  as  by  our 
fascination for the islands themselves. 

 Experiments  on  islands,  such  as  those  of  Simberl-
off  and  Wilson,  demonstrate  the  value  of  an  experimental 
approach to answering ecological questions. However, there 
are important ecological patterns that occur over such large 
scales that experiments are virtually impossible. The ecolo-
gists who study these large-scale patterns must rely on other 
approaches.  In  the  next  section,  we  discuss  one  of  these 
important large-scale patterns: latitudinal variation in species 
richness. 

  Concept 22.2 Review 

      1.   Why are virtually all estimates of immigration and extinc-

tion rates on islands underestimates of the true rates?  

     2.   What result would have been grounds for Diamond to 
reject  the  equilibrium  model  of  island  biogeography 
based on his studies of the California Channel Islands 
(see  fig. 22.10 )?  

     3.   In the course of studies by Simberloff and Wilson (1969) 
and  Simberloff  (1976),  several  mangrove  islands  were 
defaunated and several were partially destroyed to reduce 
island area. Do such experiments raise ethical issues?       

  22.3   Latitudinal Gradients 

in Species Richness 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 22.9  Describe the typical latitudinal gradient in species 

richness seen in various groups of organisms, such as 
birds, butterflies, and trees.

 22.10  Outline the major hypotheses proposed to explain 

typical latitudinal gradients in species richness.

 22.11  Discuss the contribution of area to latitudinal and 

continental patterns of species richness.

   Species richness generally increases from middle and high 
latitudes to the equator.   
 Most groups of organisms are more 
species-rich in the tropics. This well-known increase in species 
richness toward the equator became apparent by the middle of 
the eighteenth century as taxonomists, led by Carolus Linnaeus, 
described  tropical  species  sent  back  to  Europe  by  explorers. 
These explorers and later naturalists, such as Humboldt, Darwin, 
and Wallace, described overwhelming biological diversity in the 
tropics. Today, two and a half centuries later, we are still trying 
to catalog this diversity and do not even know its full extent. 

Latitudinal Gradient Hypotheses
  Figures  22.15   and   22.16   show  examples  of  how  plant  spe-
cies  richness  (Reid  and  Miller  1989)  and  bird  species  rich-
ness  (Dobzhansky  1950)  decrease  toward  the  poles.  Despite 
some  exceptions  to  the  equatorial  peak  in  species  diversity 
( fig. 22.17 ), the pattern of increased numbers of species in the 
tropics is pervasive and dramatic. This pattern challenges ecolo-
gists for an explanation. Many mechanisms have been proposed 
to  explain  latitudinal  gradients  in  species  richness.  James  H. 
Brown  (1988)  grouped  the  hypotheses  proposed  to  explain 
geographic gradients in species richness into six categories.        

  Time Since Perturbation 
 The   time  since  perturbation  hypothesis   proposes  that  there 
are more species in the tropics because the tropics are older 
and they are disturbed less frequently. That is, more species 
occur in the tropics because (1) there has been more time for

from Central to North America (data from Dobzhansky 1950).  

   Latitudinal variation in number of bird species 

speciation and (2) less frequent perturbation reduces extinc-
tion rates. The proponents of this hypothesis assume that the 
tropics have remained relatively stable whereas middle and 
high latitudes have been repeatedly disrupted by the advance 
and retreat of glaciers. However, in chapter 16 we saw that 
intermediate levels of disturbance may increase local diver-
sity. In counterpoint to this hypothesis, Joseph Connell (1978) 
proposed that the extraordinary diversity of tropical rain for-
ests and coral reefs is maintained by frequent disturbance.  

  Productivity 
 The  authors  of  the   productivity  hypothesis   observe  that  two 
of  the  most  diverse  environments  on  earth,  coral  reefs  and 
tropical  rain  forests,  are  also  extraordinarily  productive. 
This  hypothesis  proposes  that  high  productivity  contributes 
to  high  species  richness.  It  assumes  that  with  more  energy 
to divide among organisms, specialized consumers will have 
larger  populations.  Since  larger  populations  generally  have 
lower  probabilities  of  extinction  than  smaller  populations, 
extinction  rates  should  be  lower  in  more  productive  envi-
ronments.  However,  Brown  points  out  that  this  hypothesis 

must somehow explain the reduction in species diversity that 
accompanies nutrient enrichment and increased primary pro-
duction (see chapter 16).  

  Environmental Heterogeneity 
 The  environmental heterogeneity hypothesis  proposes that the 
tropics  contain  more  species  because  they  are  more  hetero-
geneous  than  temperate  regions.  Daniel  Janzen  (1967)  and 
George  Stevens  (1989)  pointed  out  that,  compared  to  high- 
latitude species, most tropical species occur in far fewer envi-
ronments along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. 

 Michael  Rosenzweig  (1992),  however,  cautioned  that 
we  cannot  consider  habitat  structure  independently  of  the 
organisms  living  in  a  region.  Species  within  more  diverse 
communities tend to subdivide the environment more finely. 
Consequently,  species  diversity  and  habitat  heterogeneity 
are  not  necessarily  independent  factors.  For  instance,  when 
George Cox and Robert Ricklefs (1977) estimated the number 
of  habitats  used  by  birds  in  Panama  versus  four  Caribbean 
islands, they found an inverse relationship between numbers 
of  species  and  the  number  of  habitats  used  by  the  birds.  In 
other words, birds appeared to restrict their habitat use in the 
presence of more species.  

  Favorableness 
 The   favorableness  hypothesis   proposes  that  the  tropics  pro-
vide  a  more  favorable  environment  than  do  high  latitudes. 
As  we  saw  in  chapter  2,  the  variation  in  temperature  in 
high-latitude  environments  is  much  greater  than  in  tropical 
environments.  Biologists  have  proposed  that  the  correspon-
dence  between  low  diversity  and  the  physical  variability  of 
high  latitudes  is  no  accident.  While  many  species  are  well 
adapted to physically harsh conditions, most species on earth 
are  not.  Biologists  have  proposed  that  physically  extreme 
 environments restrict the diversity of organisms.  

496 

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

  Niche Breadths and Interspecific Interactions 
 Biologists have tried to explain latitudinal gradients in species 
diversity  with  several  hypotheses  concerning  relative  niche 
breadths and interspecific interactions. Their hypotheses have 
included:

     1.  Tropical  species  are  limited  more  by  biological  factors 

than by physical factors.  

    2.  Tropical species are affected more by interspecific inter-

actions than by intraspecific interactions.  

    3.  The niches of tropical species overlap more than those of 
higher-latitude  species  and  so  tropical  species  compete 
more intensively.  

    4.  Tropical  species  are  more  specialized—that  is,  have 
 narrower niches, and therefore compete less intensively 
than species at higher latitudes.  

    5.  Tropical  species  are  more  subject  to  controls  by  preda-

tors, parasites, and pathogens.  

    6.  Compared  to  temperate  species,  tropical  species  are 

involved in more mutualistic interactions.    

 Brown suggested that these hypotheses present the ecologist 
with a number of difficulties. Notice that some of these hypoth-
eses are contradictory. In addition, they are difficult to test and 
do not address the primary differences between the tropics and 
higher latitudes. For instance, even if the niches of tropical species 
differ consistently from those of species at higher latitudes, we 
must determine the causes of those differences. Brown suggests 
that biological processes, such as competition and predation, must 
play a secondary role in determining species diversity gradients. 
He proposes that the ultimate causes of geographic gradients in 
species richness must be physical differences between the tropics 
and higher latitudes. The following hypothesis uses differences in 
physical settings to explain latitudinal patterns of diversity.  

  Differences in Speciation 
and Extinction Rates 
 Ultimately, the number of species in a particular area reflects 
the rate at which new species have been added to the species 
pool minus the rate at which they have disappeared. Species 
are added to species pools by either immigration or  speciation. 
However, Rosenzweig (1992) proposed that when we consider 
the diversity of whole biogeographic provinces, immigration 
can be largely discounted and speciation will be the primary 
source of new species. Species are removed from species pools 
by extinction. So, tropical species richness is greater than at 
higher latitudes because the  tropics  have experienced  higher 
rates of speciation and/or lower rates of extinction. However, 
Brown would remind us here that we need to determine the 
physical  mechanisms  that  produce  differences  in  speciation 
and extinction rates in tropical versus higher latitudes.   

  Area and Latitudinal Gradients 
in Species Richness 
 John Terborgh (1973) and Michael Rosenzweig (1992) pro-
posed that the greater species richness of the tropics can be 
explained  by  the  greater  area  covered  by  tropical  regions. 

It  may  not  be  immediately  apparent  that  the  tropics,  which 
mainly  occupy  the  area  between  the  tropics  of  Cancer  and 
Capricorn, include a greater area of both land and water than 
do higher latitudes. The reason for this is that the typical world 
map is based upon the  Mercator Projection,  a projection that 
increases the apparent area at high latitudes. However, if you 
look at a world globe, you will immediately see that the tropi-
cal areas of the earth constitute a vast area. 

 Is  there  a  greater  land  surface  area  in  the  tropics? 
Rosenzweig quantified the amount of land surface area in 
various latitudinal zones using a computer map of the earth. 
He divided the globe into tropical ( 6  26 8  of latitude), sub-
tropical  (26 8 –36 8 ),  temperate  (36 8 – 46 8 ),  boreal  (46 8 –56 8 ), 
and tundra (> 56 8 ). He then measured the area of land within 
these latitudinal zones and found that the area of land within 
the tropics far exceeds that of other areas ( fig. 22.18 ).     

 Not only is there more land (and water) at tropical lati-
tudes, but in addition, temperatures are more uniform across 
this tropical belt. This pattern was put in the context of geo-
graphic ecology by Terborgh, who plotted mean annual tem-
peratures  against  latitude.  As   figure  22.19   shows,  there  is 
little difference in mean annual temperatures between about 
0 8  and 25 8  latitude. Because this temperature pattern occurs 
both  north  and  south  of  the  equator,  mean  annual  tempera-
ture changes little over about 50 8  of latitude within the trop-
ics.  However,  above  25 8   latitude,  mean  annual  temperature 
declines linearly with latitude. What is the biological signifi-
cance of this latitudinal pattern of temperature variation? One 
implication is that tropical organisms can disperse over large 
areas and not meet with significant changes in temperature.     

 How do patterns of temperature variation affect rates of 
speciation  and  extinction?  Rosenzweig  proposed  that  the 
larger area of tropical regions should reduce extinction rates 
in two ways. First, large, physically similar areas will allow 
tropical species to be distributed over a larger area. Within 
these larger areas, there should be more refuges in which to 

There is considerably more land 
area in the tropics than in other 
ecological zones.

 Rosenzweig  also  proposed  that  larger  species  ranges 
should  increase  rates  of  allopatric  speciation.  He  reasoned 
that  geographic  barriers,  such  as  mountain  ranges  or  deep 
canyons, are more likely to form within large species ranges 
than within small species ranges. Therefore, since geographic 
isolation  initiates  allopatric  speciation,  speciation  rates  are 
likely to be higher in tropical regions. 

 Earlier  in  this  chapter,  we  saw  that  species  rich-
ness increases with island area. However, do larger continents 
also harbor more species? We explore this question in the fol-
lowing example.  

  Continental Area and Species Richness 
 Karl Flessa (1975, 1981) was the first to examine the relation-
ship between continental area and species richness. He found 
a  strong  positive  relationship  between  mammalian  richness 
and  the  area  of  continents,  large  islands,  and  island  groups. 
Flessa  found  a  significant  positive  relationship  whether  his 
index  of  mammalian  richness  was  total  number  of  orders, 
families,  or  genera.  James  H.  Brown  (1986)  performed  an 
analysis similar to Flessa’s; however, he restricted his analysis 
to  the  five  major  continents  plus  two  large  tropical  islands, 
Madagascar  and  New  Guinea.  Brown  also  excluded  flying 
mammals  and  analyzed  patterns  of  mammalian  diversity  at 
the level of genera and species. Like Flessa, Brown found a 
strong positive relationship between mammalian richness and 
area  ( fig.  22.20 ).  Madagascar,  with  the  smallest  land  area, 
supports  the  lowest  mammalian  richness.  Eurasia,  with  the 
largest land area, supports the greatest mammalian diversity. 
The continents of Australia, South America, North America, 
and Africa, with intermediate areas, contain intermediate lev-
els of mammalian richness.     

 What do these analyses by Flessa and Brown have to do 
with higher tropical species richness? Rosenzweig proposed 

Figure 22.20   Relationship between area of continents and large islands 
and number of nonflying terrestrial mammals (data from Brown 1986). 

that the greater area of the tropics (see  fig. 22.18 ) is a primary 
cause  of  the  higher  diversity.  If  differences  in  area  produce 
differences in species richness, then we should see a positive 
relationship  between  continental  area  and  species  richness. 
Flessa and Brown have shown such a relationship. Now, let’s 
go back to the tropics. 

 Do  tropical  regions  with  different  areas  differ  in  species 
richness? If Rosenzweig’s explanation for the greater tropical 
diversity  is  correct,  tropical  regions  of  different  areas  should 
support  different  levels  of  biological  diversity.  Rosenzweig 
examined  patterns  of  diversity  among  fruit- eating  mammals 
and  plants  in  tropical  rain  forests  ranging  from  Australia  to 
 Amazonia. The result was a strong positive relationship between 
area  and  diversity,  a  result  that  supports  the  area  hypothesis 
( fig. 22.21 ). The smallest area of tropical rain forest, Australia, 
contains the smallest number of fruit-eating mammal and plant 
species. Amazonia,  with  the  largest  rain  forest  area,  contains 
the greatest number of fruit-eating mammal and plant species.   
 In summary, many factors may contribute to higher trop-
ical species richness, including (1) time since perturbation, 
(2) productivity, (3) environmental heterogeneity, (4) favor-
ableness,  (5)  niche  breadths  and  interspecific  interactions, 
and (6) differences in speciation and extinction rates. How-
ever,  several  lines  of  evidence  support  the  hypothesis  that 
differences in surface area play a primary role in determining 
latitudinal  gradients  in  species  richness.  Can  we  conclude 
that we fully understand the mechanisms underlying latitu-
dinal gradients in diversity? Brown concluded that while we 
are close to understanding the mechanisms controlling varia-
tion in species richness across islands, “The distributions of 
species and higher taxa within continents are more complex 
and for the most part remain to be deciphered.” As we shall 
see in the next section, some of that unexplained complex-
ity is due to historical and regional differences between the 
continents.

  Concept 22.3 Review 

1.   Why is there no one factor that seems to explain latitu-

dinal gradients in species diversity?  

2.   What major pattern do patterns of island diversity and 

continental diversity have in common?       

  22.4   Historical and Regional 

Influences  

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 22.12  Discuss evidence for historical influences on 

regional differences in species richness.

 22.13  Explain how historical factors related to the pro-
cesses of speciation and extinction can influence 
regional differences in species richness.

  Long-term  historical  and  regional  processes  can  signifi-
cantly influence species richness and diversity.   
 Area and 
isolation  explain  much  of  the  variation  in  species  diversity 
and composition across islands. Area appears to account for 
much of the variation in biological diversity across continents. 
Additional variation in local diversity appears to be due to dif-
ferences in habitat heterogeneity, disturbance, predation, and 
successional age of the local community, factors that we dis-
cussed in chapters 16, 17, and 20. However, as the following 
examples show, these factors are not adequate to explain many 
geographic differences in biological diversity and community 
organization. Robert Ricklefs (1987) pointed out that in many 

cases, unique historical and geographic factors appear to have 
produced significant regional differences in species richness.  

   Exceptional Patterns of Diversity 
 There  are  major  differences  in  species  richness  that  cannot 
be  explained  by  differences  in  area.  For  instance,  consider 
the  regions  with  Mediterranean  climates  that  we  discussed 
in  chapter  2  (see  fig.  2.22),  which  support  Mediterranean 
woodlands  and  shrublands.  Such  regions  include  the  Cape 
region  of  South  Africa  (90,000  km 2 ),  southwestern  Aus-
tralia  (320,000  km 2 ),  and  the  California  Floristic  Province 
(324,000 km 2 ). These regions have similar climates but differ 
significantly in area. Which of these areas should contain the 
greatest number of species? The positive relationship between 
area  and  species  richness  that  we  have  seen  repeatedly  ear-
lier in this chapter, leads us to predict that southwestern Aus-
tralia  and  the  California  Floristic  Province,  with  more  than 
three times the area of the Cape region of South Africa, will 
contain  the  greatest  biological  diversity.  Southwestern Aus-
tralia and the California Floristic Province have the same area 
and approximately the same number of species. However, as 
  figure 22.22  shows, the Cape region, the smallest area, con-
tains more than twice the number of plant species as the other 
two regions.   

 The failure of area to explain a significant regional diversity 
pattern is not unique to this example. For instance, Roger Latham 
and Robert Ricklefs (1993) reported a striking contrast in diver-
sity of temperate zone trees that cannot be explained by an area 
effect. As we saw in chapter 2, the temperate forest biome covers 
approximately equal areas in Europe  (1.2 million km 2 ), Eastern
Asia (1.2 million km 2 ), and Eastern North America (1.8 million 
km 2 ). The species area relationship would lead us to predict that 
these three regions would support approximately equal levels of 
biological diversity. However,  figure 22.23  shows that Eastern 

The plant diversity of the Cape 
region of South Africa is far greater 
than that of either southwestern 
Australia or California.

Investigating the Evidence  22

 Sample Size Revisited 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 22.14  Discuss sample size as it relates to large-scale geo-

graphic studies.

 22.15  Contrast the challenges related to sample size 
faced by researchers doing large-scale ecologi-
cal research versus those doing laboratory-based 
research on ecological questions (e.g., research on 
competitive interactions among microorganisms).

 In chapter 6 (see p. 136) we considered the number of samples 
necessary to obtain a reasonably precise estimate of the num-
ber of species in two simple communities. In chapter 16 (see 
p. 359) we reconsidered the same question in relation to very 
complex communities, concluding that, in some situations, the 
sampling efforts required for precise estimates of the number 
of  species  must  be  intense.  In  general,  the  sample  size  nec-
essary to detect statistically significant differences, or effects, 
increases with the variation of the system under study. Here we 
consider  another  question,  “What  determines  sample  size?” 
Another way of putting this question is, “What is a replicate 
observation or measurement?” 

 For  small-scale  studies,  the  answers  to  these  questions 
are  clear.  For  instance,  in  laboratory  studies  of  the  running 
performance of an animal species, or the photosynthetic rate 
of a plant species, the number of individuals measured would 
determine sample size. In an experimental field study of the 
effects of nitrogen availability on plant diversity, the number 
of field plots in which the investigator manipulated soil nitro-
gen  would  determine  sample  size.  However,  the  answers  to 
these  questions  may  not  be  as  obvious,  as  ecologists  begin 
to address larger-scale ecological problems. For example, in 
chapter 21, we compared the standing stocks of detritus in two 
streams (see p. 466), one that drained a deciduous forest and 
one  that  drained  a  coniferous  forest,  and  found  significant 
differences between the two streams. In that comparison, the 

number  of  measurements  of  detritus  standing  stock  in  each 
stream, which was 7, determined the sample size. 

 However,  based  on  the  comparison  of  the  two  study 
streams,  can  we  conclude  that  streams  draining  conifer  for-
ests,   in  general,   contain  higher  standing  stocks  of  detritus 
compared to deciduous forest streams? We cannot reach such 
a general conclusion. Why not? The basic reason is that the 
study outlined in chapter 21 included only one stream drain-
ing each type of forest. In other words, relative to the general 
relationship  between  type  of  forest  and  amount  of  detritus 
in  associated  streams,  our  sample  size  was  one.  Even  if  we 
made 100 measurements of detritus in the two study streams 
and, as a consequence, obtained very precise estimates of the 
amount of detritus that each held, the sample size relative to 
the broader question would still be one stream of each type. 

 How do we increase sample size for such a study? To do 
so we would need to locate and study several streams associ-
ated  with  deciduous  forests  and  coniferous  forests.  Ideally, 
we  would  sample  beyond  a  particular  landscape  and  include 
streams in several landscapes throughout a region. The number 
of   different   streams  of  each  type  that  we  sampled  within  the 
region would determine the sample size. To make statements 
beyond  the  regional  scale,  we  would  need  to  sample  several 
regions  within  a  continent.  The  requirements  of  ecological 
research at very large scales soon taxes the limited resources 
of any single investigator or team of investigators. As a conse-
quence, ecologists studying at large spatial scales increasingly 
turn to computer-based systems for data gathering and analysis, 
a topic discussed in the Applications section. Another way to 
increase our ability to make inferences is to utilize information 
gathered and published by other research teams. Doing so puts 
local and regional studies in broader contexts. In chapter 23, we 
discuss some approaches to searching this literature (p. 520). 

 C RITIQUING THE  E VIDENCE  22 
   1.  How might whole-earth scale, global ecology be affected 

by sample size considerations? 

Asia contains nearly three times more tree species than Eastern 
North America and nearly six times more species of trees than 
Europe. 

 Let’s discuss another example, this time involving birds. 
In chapter 16 we reviewed several studies that showed a posi-
tive  relationship  between  foliage  height  diversity  and  bird 
species diversity. These studies of bird communities showed 
that  greater  vertical  heterogeneity  in  the  plant  community 
(foliage height diversity) is associated with greater bird spe-
cies  diversity  in  areas  as  widespread  as  Northeastern  North 

America,  Puerto  Rico,  Panama,  and  Australia  (e.g.,  see 
fig. 16.10). However, biologists have found that this positive 
relationship is not universal.           

 John Ralph (1985) studied the relationship between foli-
age  height  diversity  and  bird  species  diversity  in  northern 
Patagonia, Argentina. He chose study sites distributed along a 
50 km moisture gradient in which annual precipitation ranged 
from 200 to 2,500 mm annually. This precipitation gradient 
produced  a  gradient  in  vegetative  structure  from  grasslands 
and shrublands through beech forests. Contrary to what had

been found in other regions, Ralph found a negative correla-
tion between foliage height diversity and bird species diver-
sity ( fig. 22.24 ). He recorded higher diversity in shrub habitats 
than in beech forests with greater foliage height diversity.      

  Historical and Regional Explanations 
 How can we explain these exceptional patterns of biological 
diversity? What mechanisms produced these patterns that are 
contrary  to  generalizations  discussed  in  this  chapter  and  in 
earlier chapters? In each case, it appears that geography and 
history offer convincing explanations. 

  The Cape Floristic Region of South Africa 
 Pauline Bond and Peter Goldblatt (1984) attributed the unusual 
species richness of the Cape floristic region to several historic 
and geographic factors. Selection for a distinctively Mediter-
ranean flora in southern Africa began during the late Tertiary 
period, about 26 million years ago. At that time, the climate 
became progressively cooler and drier, conditions that selected 
for  succulence,  fire  resistance,  and  smaller,  sclerophylous 
leaves. The  initial  sites  for  evolution  of  the  Cape  flora  were 
likely in south-central Africa, not in the Cape region itself. At 
that time, Africa lay farther south and the Cape region had a 
cool, moist climate and supported an evergreen forest. 

 As  Africa  drifted  northward,  the  climate  of  southern 
Africa became more arid and the ancestors of today’s Cape 
flora gradually migrated toward the Cape region. By the time 
Africa  neared  its  present  latitudinal  position  during  the  late 
Pliocene,  about  3  million  years  ago,  southern  Africa  was 
very arid and the Cape region had a Mediterranean climate. 
Bond and Goldblatt suggest that plant speciation within this 
region was promoted by the highly dissected landscape, the 
existence of a wide variety of soil types, and repeated expan-
sion,  contraction,  and  isolation  of  plant  populations  during 

the climatic fluctuations of the Pleistocene. They suggest that 
extinction rates were reduced by the existence of substantial 
refuge areas, even during times of peak aridity.  

  The Diversity of Temperate Trees 
 How did Eastern Asia, Eastern North America, and Europe, 
three temperate regions of approximately equal area and cli-
mate,  end  up  with  such  different  numbers  of  tree  species? 
Latham and Ricklefs offer persuasive geographic and histori-
cal reasons. They propose that we need to consider what trees 
in  the  three  regions  faced  during  the  last  glacial  period  and 
how those conditions may have affected extinction rates. 

 Refer to chapter 2 and study the distributions of temper-
ate forest in Eastern Asia, Eastern North America, and Europe 
(see fig. 2.28). Now examine the distributions of mountains 
in Eastern Asia, Eastern North America, and Europe shown in 
figure 2.37. Notice that while there are no mountain barriers 
to north–south movements of organisms in Eastern Asia and 
Eastern  North America,  the  mountains  in  Europe  form  bar-
riers that are oriented east to west. Now imagine what hap-
pened  to  a  tree  species  as  glaciers  began  to  advance  during 
the  last  ice  age  and  the  climate  of  Europe  became  progres-
sively colder. Temperate trees would have had their southward 
retreat largely cut off by mountain ranges running east to west. 
 This hypothesis proposes that the lower species richness of 
European trees has been at least partly a consequence of higher 
extinction rates during glacial periods. How would you test this 
hypothesis? Latham and Ricklefs searched the fossil record for 
extinctions in the three regions. They estimated the number of 
genera that have become extinct in the three regions during the 
last 30 to 40 million years. Their analysis showed that most of 
the plant genera that once lived in Europe have become extinct. 
A larger proportion of genera has become extinct in Europe than 
in either Eastern Asia or Eastern North America ( fig. 22.25 ).     

A much higher percentage of tree 
genera have become extinct in 
Europe than in East Asia or 
eastern North America.

 Now  consider  Eastern  North America. The  only  moun-
tain  range,  the  Appalachians,  runs  north  to  south.  Conse-
quently,  in  Eastern  North  America,  temperate  trees  had  an 
avenue of retreat in the face of advancing glaciers and cooling 
climate. The movement of temperate tree populations in the 
face of climate change has been well documented by paleon-
tologists such as Margaret Davis (see fig. 10.6). There are also 
no mountain barriers in Eastern Asia, where temperate trees 
can migrate even farther south than in Eastern North America. 
 Higher  rates  of  extinction  during  glacial  periods  can 
explain the lower diversity of trees in Europe. However, why 
does Eastern North America include fewer tree species than 
Eastern Asia?  Latham  and  Ricklefs  conclude  that  the  fossil 
record and present-day distributions of temperate trees indi-
cate that most temperate tree taxa originated in Eastern Asia. 
These Asian taxa subsequently dispersed to Europe and North 
America. In addition, after the dispersal routes between East-
ern  Asia  and  Eastern  North  America  were  closed  off,  spe-
ciation  continued  in Asia,  producing  several  endemic Asian 
genera. In other words, there are fewer tree species in Eastern 
North America because most taxa originated in Eastern Asia 
and never dispersed to North America.  

  Bird Diversity in the Beech Forests 
of South America 
 Why do the structurally complex beech forests of South Amer-
ica support lower bird diversity than the simpler shrub habi-
tats?  Dolph  Schluter  and  Robert  Ricklefs  (1993)   suggested 
that the lower bird diversity in beech forests may be due to 
the restricted geographic distribution of these temperate for-
ests in South America. The shrub habitats where Ralph (1985) 
recorded the greatest diversity of birds occupy a much larger 
area within South America. 

Chapter 22 

  Geographic Ecology

501

 In addition to their small area, South American beech for-
ests are also isolated from subtropical and tropical forests by vast 
areas of arid and semiarid vegetation. The biota of these forests 
includes endemic species of frogs, birds, and mammals, which 
suggests that South American beech forests have been isolated 
for a long time. Schluter and Ricklefs suggested that small area 
and isolation may account for the low diversity of birds in South 
American  beech  forests.  They  cite  the  relationship  found  by 
Ralph as, “a convincing demonstration of how effects of local 
habitat on species diversity may be superseded by regional ones.” 
 In summary, much geographic variation in species rich-
ness  can  be  explained  by  historical  and  regional  processes. 
The ecologist interested in understanding patterns of diversity 
at large spatial scales must consider processes occurring over 
similarly  large  scales  and  over  long  periods  of  time. As  we 
shall see in chapter 23, a large-scale, long-term perspective is 
also essential for understanding global ecology. 

  Concept 22.4 Review 

1.   Why  should  history  have  such  a  strong  influence  on 

regional diversity patterns?  

2.   How  does  the  combined  evidence  from  studies  of  the 
flora of Mediterranean regions ( fig. 22.22 ) and the diver-
sity  of  trees  in  temperate  forest  regions  increase  con-
fidence  that  historical  differences  can  outweigh  the 
potential influence of area on diversity?

 22.17  Explain how remote sensing has revolutionized the

 In  1972,  Robert  MacArthur  defined  geographic  ecology  as 
the study of patterns you can put on a map. Spatial distribu-
tions that can be put on maps are still the center of geographic 
ecology, but the nature of “maps” has changed tremendously. 
Modern tools have revolutionized the field. Today, geographic 
ecologists generally record their data on geographic informa-
tion  systems,  which  are  computer-based  systems  that  store, 
analyze, and display geographic information. In addition, the 
geographic ecologists of today also have access to more infor-
mation  of  greater  accuracy  because  of  remote  sensing  and 
global positioning systems.    

502 

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

  Global Positioning Systems 
 What is the location? This is one of the most basic questions 
the  geographer  can  ask.  Scientists,  engineers,  navigators, 
and explorers have spent centuries devising methods to mea-
sure  elevation,  latitude,  and  longitude.  Recent  technological 
advances have improved the accuracy of these measurements. 
 Alexander von Humboldt, the founder of geographic ecol-
ogy, would appreciate these recent technological advances. As 
he explored South and North America, he carefully determined 
the latitude, longitude, and elevation of important geographic 
features. For instance, Humboldt was particularly interested in 
verifying the existence and location of a waterway called the 
Casiquiare Canal. The Casiquiare reportedly connected the Ori-
noco River with the Rio Negro, which flows into the Amazon. 
A connection between two major river systems would make the 
Casiquiare unique, but its existence was widely doubted. 

 Humboldt  halted  his  expedition  at  the  junction  of  the 
Casiquiare and the Rio Negro so that he could record the lati-
tude  and  longitude.  Biting  insects  tormented  the  explorers  as 
they waited for nightfall. Luckily, that night the clouds parted 
and Humboldt could see the stars well enough to take sightings 
and determine their position. At other times, he was not so lucky. 
He once waited for nearly a month for the weather to clear suffi-
ciently to make his sightings on the stars. Today, equipped with 
a global positioning system, Humboldt could have determined 
the latitude and longitude of the junction of the Casiquiare and 
the Rio Negro any time he wished, regardless of weather. 

 A    global positioning system (GPS)    determines locations 
on the earth’s surface, including latitude, longitude, and alti-
tude, using satellites as reference points. These satellites, which 
orbit  the  earth  at  a  height  of  about  21,000  km,  continuously 
transmit their position and the time. The satellites keep track 
of time with an extremely accurate atomic clock that loses or 
gains 1 second in about 30,000 years. A global positioning sys-
tem receives the signals broadcast by these satellites. Because 
the system also includes an extremely accurate clock, the time 
required  for  the  satellite  signal  to  reach  the  receiver  can  be 
used as a measure of the distance between the two. With mea-
surements of the distance to four satellites, a global positioning 
system  can  determine  the  latitude,  longitude,  and  altitude  of 
any point on earth with great accuracy ( fig. 22.26 ).     

 While  navigation  satellites  and  global  positioning  sys-
tems  can  accurately  locate  places  on  the  ground,  other  sat-
ellites  provide  a  wealth  of  other  information  about  those 
localities. These “remote sensing” satellites transmit pictures 
of the earth that are extremely valuable to ecologists.  

  Remote Sensing 
    Remote  sensing     refers  to  gathering  information  about  an 
object without direct contact with it, mainly by gathering and 
processing electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected by 
the  object.  Using  this  definition,  the  original  remote  sensor 
was the eye. However, we generally associate remote sensing 
with technology that extends the senses, technology ranging 
from binoculars and cameras to satellite-mounted sensors. 

 Remote sensing satellites are generally fitted with  electro-
optical sensors that scan several bands of the electromagnetic 

By measuring the distance to four 
satellites, a global positioning 
system can accurately determine

spectrum.  These  sensors  convert  electromagnetic   radiation 
into  electrical  signals  that  are  in  turn  converted  to  digital 
values  by  a  computer.  These  digital  values  can  be  used  to 
construct an image. The earliest of the  Landsat  satellites mon-
itored four bands of electromagnetic radiation, two bands of 
visible  light  (0.5–0.6   m m  and  0.6–0.7   m m),  and  two  bands 
in the near infrared (0.7–0.8  m m and 0.8–1.1  m m). From this 
beginning,  satellite  imaging  systems  have  gotten  progres-
sively  more  sophisticated  both  in  terms  of  the  number  of 
wavelengths scanned and the spatial resolution. 

 Satellite-based  remote  sensing  has  produced  detailed 
images  of  essentially  every  square  meter  of  the  earth’s  sur-
face. These images provide very useful information to ecol-
ogists,  especially  for  landscape  and  geographic  ecology. 
Ecologists have used remote sensing to monitor the biomass 
of vegetation using indices of “greenness.” In the arid Ameri-
can Southwest, vegetative biomass indicates the positions of 
moist mountain areas. 

 Mountain Islands 
in the American Southwest 
 Norman  Roller  and  John  Colwell  (1986)  reviewed  how  sat-
ellites  gathering  information  at  a  coarse  level  of  resolution 
could  be  useful  for  conducting  ecological  surveys,  particu-
larly when those surveys concern large geographic areas. Ear-
lier in this chapter, we discussed one such survey conducted 
by Lomolino and his colleagues on the mammals of montane 
“islands”  in  the  American  Southwest.  In  their  study,  these 
researchers relied principally on a 1982 map of the vegetation 
of the area. They could have also used satellite imagery from 
the same region to delineate their study areas. 

In the satellite image shown in figure 22.27, red, orange 
and yellow patches in New Mexico and Arizona correspond 
to the forested montane islands studied by Lomolino and his

idea of the complexity of that patchiness. Some phytoplank-
ton patchiness occurs far out at sea, and there is also a high 
degree of temporal variation in patch location. Patches of high 
production  that  form  along  coastlines  can  move  offshore  at 
rates of 2 to 7 km per day. It would be impossible for a ship 
moving at less than 30 km per hour to capture such spatially 
and temporally complex patterns of production. However, the 
satellite that took the image shown in  figure 22.28  can scan 
a path 1,600 km wide with a resolution of about 1 km 2  and 
resample the same area at 5- to 6-day intervals. 

 This  example  and  the  previous  one  show  that  satellite-
based  remote  sensing  can  gather  large  amounts  of  data  over 
large areas. This ability solves some of the sampling problems 
associated  with  studying  large-scale  ecological  phenomena. 
However, these large quantities of data create another problem. 
Ecologists need a system for storing, sorting, analyzing, and dis-
playing these large quantities of geographic information. This is 
the problem addressed by geographic information systems.   

  Geographic Information Systems 
 In  the  days  of  Humboldt,  geographers  often  had  too  little 
data. Today,  with  new  tools  for  gathering  great  quantities  of 
information,  geographers  and  geographic  ecologists  can  be 
overwhelmed  by  data.     Geographic  information   systems    ,  
computer-based  systems  for  storing,  sorting,  analyzing,  and 
displaying  geographic  data,  are  designed  to  handle  large 

colleagues. However, unlike a static map, satellite estimates 
of plant biomass can be made frequently and offer the pos-
sibility  of  detecting  temporal  variation.  This  is  particularly 
important in a region like the American Southwest that expe-
riences high year-to-year variability in precipitation and plant 
production.

  Marine Primary Production from Space 
 Mary Jane Perry (1986) demonstrated the use of remote sens-
ing  to  study  marine  primary  production.  In  chapter  21,  we 
concentrated on patchiness in terrestrial environments. How-
ever, marine environments are also highly patchy, especially 
in regard to primary production ( fig. 22.28 ). Perry pointed out 
that we know little about interannual variation in marine pri-
mary production, particularly in the open ocean.     

 The main reasons we know little about the dynamics of 
production in the open ocean are that (1) the open ocean eco-
system is so vast, covering approximately 332 million km 2 , 
(2)  there  are  limited  numbers  of  oceanographic  ships  and 
other sea-based sampling devices, and (3) open ocean studies 
are  expensive.  Perry  proposed  that  satellite  remote  sensing 
of  ocean  color  is  the  best  tool  at  our  disposal  for  studying 
regional and global marine primary production.  Figure 22.28  
shows a remote sensing image taken along the west coast of 
North America. The  colors  indicate  concentrations  of  chlo-
rophyll  a,  a measure of phytoplankton biomass. The image 
indicates a high degree of patchiness; higher concentrations 
of  phytoplankton  occur  in  a  narrow  coastal  band.  The  fig-
ure also shows that the coastal waters supporting high phy-
toplankton biomass are also colder than offshore areas. What 
process  is  suggested  by  the  combination  of  cold  water  and 
high  phytoplankton  biomass?  The  combination  suggests 
coastal  upwelling,  which  brings  nutrient-rich  deep  water  to 
the surface. 

 Perry  reports  that  though  oceanographers  had  long 
known that phytoplankton populations are patchy, they had no 

 Figure 22.27   Higher vegetative biomass in this satellite image 
of the American Southwest occurs mainly on mountain ranges, many 
of which are distributed across the arid region as isolated islands of 
elevated production (Collatz et al. 2014).

quantities  of  data.  Sometimes  geographic  information  sys-
tems  are  confused  with  computerized  mapmaking.  While 
these systems can produce maps, they do much more. Much of 
population ecology is concerned with understanding the fac-
tors controlling the distribution and abundance of organisms. 
However, the geographic context of populations often has been 
lost. Geographic information systems preserve this geographic 
information.  Because  they  preserve  geographic  context,  the 

systems provide ecologists with a valuable tool for exploring 
large-scale population responses to climate change. 

 As we shall see in chapter 23, rapid global change chal-
lenges  the  field  of  ecology  to  address  large-scale  environ-
mental  questions.  As  ecologists  address  these  compelling 
questions,  geographic  information  systems,  global  position-
ing systems, and remote sensing will be increasingly valued 
parts of their tool kit.     

   Summary 

  Geographic  ecology   focuses  on  large-scale  patterns  of  dis-
tribution  and  diversity  of  organisms,  such  as  island  bioge-
ography,  latitudinal  patterns  of  species  diversity,  and  the 
influences of large-scale regional and historical processes on 
biological diversity. 

  On islands and habitat patches on continents, species 
richness increases with area and decreases with isolation.  
Larger oceanic islands support more species of most groups 
of  organisms  than  small  islands.  Isolated  oceanic  islands 
generally  contain  fewer  species  than  islands  near  mainland 
areas.  Many  habitats  on  continents  are  so  isolated  that  they 
can  be  considered  as  islands.  Species  richness  on  habitat 
islands, such as mountain islands in the American Southwest, 
increases  with  area  and  decreases  with  isolation.  Lakes  can 
also be considered as habitat islands. They are aquatic envi-
ronments isolated from other aquatic environments by land. 
Fish species richness generally increases with lake area. Spe-
cies richness is usually negatively correlated with island iso-
lation.  However,  because  organisms  differ  substantially  in 
dispersal rates, an island that is very isolated for one group 
of organisms may be completely accessible to another group. 
  Species richness on islands can be modeled as a dynamic 
balance  between  immigration  and  extinction  of  species.  
The  equilibrium  model  of  island  biogeography  proposes  that 
the  difference  between  rates  of  immigration  and  extinction 
determines  the  species  richness  on  islands.  The  equilibrium 
model  of  island  biogeography  assumes  that  rates  of  species 
immigration to islands are mainly determined by distance from 
sources of immigrants. The model assumes that rates of extinc-
tion on islands are determined mainly by island size. The pre-
dictions of the equilibrium model of island biogeography are 
supported  by  observations  of  species  turnover  on  the  islands 
and by colonization studies of mangrove islands in Florida and 
new islands in Lake Hjälmaren, Sweden. 

  Species richness generally increases from middle and 
high latitudes to the equator.   Most groups of organisms are 
more species-rich in the tropics. Many factors may contribute 

to  higher  tropical  species  richness,  including  (1)  time  since 
perturbation,  (2)  productivity,  (3)  environmental  heteroge-
neity, (4) favorableness, (5) niche breadths and interspecific 
interactions, and (6) differences in speciation and extinction 
rates.  Several  lines  of  evidence  support  the  hypothesis  that 
differences in surface area play a primary role in determining 
latitudinal gradients in species richness. 

  Long-term  historical  and  regional  processes  can  sig-
nificantly  influence  species  richness  and  diversity.   Much 
geographic variation in species richness can be explained by his-
torical and regional processes. Some exceptional situations that 
seem to have resulted from unique historical and regional pro-
cesses include the exceptional species richness of the Cape floris-
tic region of South Africa, the high species richness of temperate 
trees in east Asia, and the low bird diversity in beech forests of 
South America. The ecologist interested in understanding large-
scale patterns of species richness must consider processes occur-
ring over similarly large scales and over long periods of time. 

 Global  positioning  systems,  remote  sensing,  and  geo-
graphic information systems are important tools for effective 
geographic ecology. A global positioning system determines 
locations on the earth’s surface, including latitude, longitude, 
and altitude, using satellites as reference points. Remote sens-
ing satellites are generally fitted with electro-optical sensors 
that  scan  several  bands  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum. 
These sensors convert electromagnetic radiation into electri-
cal  signals  that  are  in  turn  converted  to  digital  values  by  a 
computer.  These  digital  values  can  be  used  to  construct  an 
image. Geographic information systems are computer-based 
systems that store, analyze, and display geographic informa-
tion.  Global  positioning  systems,  remote  sensing,  and  geo-
graphic  information  systems  are  increasingly  valuable  parts 
of the ecologist’s tool kit. Ecologists are using these new tools 
to study large-scale, dynamic ecological phenomena such as 
interannual  variation  in  regional  terrestrial  primary  produc-
tion,  dynamics  of  marine  primary  production,  and  potential 
population responses to climate change.

   The  numbers  are  expressed  in  two  ways:  as  simple  measure-
ments and counts and as the logarithms of area and numbers of 
species. Use these data to plot your own species–area relation-
ship. Plot area on the horizontal axis and number of species on 
the vertical axis. First plot the simple measurements of area and 
species number on one graph, and then plot the logarithms of 
area and species number on another graph. Which gives you the 
tightest relationship between area and species richness?  

    2.  Refer to  figure 22.5 , which MacArthur and Wilson (1963) used 
to show how isolation affects species richness on islands. Find 
a  detailed  map  of  the  Pacific  Ocean  and  locate  New  Guinea. 
Next  locate  as  many  of  the  “near,”  “intermediate,”  and  “far” 
islands on the map as you can. This will give you a better sense 
of  the  distances  represented  by  the  islands.  How  do  the  num-
bers of species on near, intermediate, and far islands support the 
hypothesis that island isolation tends to reduce species richness?  
    3.  We  discussed  how  Diamond  (1969)  documented  immigrations 
and extinctions on the California Channel Islands by comparing 
his  censuses  of  the  birds  of  the  islands  with  the  birds  recorded 
over  50  years  earlier.  Disregarding  the  numbers  for  San  Miguel 
and Santa Rosa Islands, which were not well censused in 1917, 
Diamond showed that an average of approximately six bird species 
became extinct on California Channel Islands between 1917 and 
1968. During the same period, an average of approximately five 
new bird species immigrated to the islands. Diamond suggested 
that his estimates of immigration and extinction were likely under-
estimates of the actual rates. Explain why his  comparative study 
produced underestimates of rates of immigration and extinction.  

    4.  Diamond’s estimates (1969) of numbers of species immigrating 
and numbers that became extinct (six versus five) were virtu-
ally identical. Is this near equality in numbers of extinction and 
immigration  consistent  with  the  equilibrium  model  of  island 
biogeography? Explain.

    5.  Suppose you are about to study the bird communities on the islands 
shown above, which are identical in area but lie at different distances 
from  the  mainland. According  to  the  equilibrium  model  of  island 
biogeography, which of the islands should experience higher rates of 
immigration? What does the equilibrium model of island biogeogra-
phy predict concerning relative rates of extinction on the two islands?  
    6.  Now, suppose you are going to study the bird communities on 
the  islands  shown  below,  which  lie  equal  distances  from  the 
mainland but differ in area. According to the equilibrium model 
of  island  biogeography,  what  should  be  the  relative  rates  of 
immigration to the two islands? On which islands should rates 
of extinction be lowest? Explain.

    7.  Review  the  major  hypotheses  proposed  to  explain  the  higher 
species richness of tropical regions compared to temperate and 
high-latitude regions. How are each of these hypotheses related 
to relative rates of speciation and extinction in tropical regions 
and temperate and high-latitude regions?  

    8.  Explain  how  speciation  and  extinction  rates  might  be  affected 
by the area of continents. What evidence is there to support your 
explanation? What does the influence of area on rates of extinc-
tion  and  speciation  have  to  do  with  higher  species  richness  in 
tropical regions compared to temperate and high- latitude regions?  
    9.  Ricklefs (1987) pointed out that many large-scale contrasts in 
species richness and composition cannot be explained by local 
processes such as competition and predation. Ricklefs proposed 
that  differences  in  history  and  geography  can  leave  a  unique 
stamp on regional biotas. The mammals of Australia, including 
kangaroos,  koalas,  and  duck-billed  platypuses,  are  one  of  the 
best-known examples of a unique biota. How have history and 
geography, as opposed to local processes, combined to produce 
this unique assemblage of mammals?  

   10.  Most examples of regional and latitudinal variation in species 
richness  cited  in  this  chapter  have  been  terrestrial.  Consider 
regional variation in marine biotas. Like birds on land, fish are 
one of the best-studied groups of marine organisms. Moyle and 
Cech (1982) cite the following patterns of fish species richness:

   As you can see, fish species richness decreases northward on both 
coasts. However, the Pacific coast generally supports a larger num-
ber of species. This contrast may be another situation requiring 
historical- and geographic-level explanations. Explore and explain 
this contrast in species richness using information from the fields 
of  marine  biology,  oceanography,  and  ichthyology.  Moyle  and 
Cech (1982) and Briggs (1974) are good starting points.

After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 23.1  Discuss the significance of the Apollo 8 photo of 
earth to perception of the planet by people around 
the world.

 23.2  Sketch the structure of earth’s atmosphere.
 23.3  Explain how the greenhouse effect influences earth’s 

surface temperature.

 23.4  Outline how human activities, through agriculture 
and industry, are impacting the global environment.

  D uring the final days of December 1968, the  Apollo 8

mission to the moon transmitted images of the earth 
rising above the moon’s horizon. For the first time, 
in  color,  we  could  see  how  earth  appears  from  our  nearest 

   View of North and South America from 35,000 km above earth. The 
necessity to address major environmental challenges, and having the 
tools to do so, have combined to make global ecology one of the most 
active and widely discussed areas of science.

about 50 km. Above the troposphere are two other layers, the 
    mesosphere    and the     thermosphere    .  

 The  atmosphere  surrounding  the  earth  significantly 
modifies  earth’s  environment.  For  instance,  the  atmosphere 
reduces the amount of ultraviolet light that reaches the surface 
of the earth. This shielding by the atmosphere is performed 
principally by ozone, a trace gas with an extremely important 
function. The atmosphere also helps keep the surface of the 
earth warm, a phenomenon called the     greenhouse effect    .  

 How does the greenhouse effect work? The wavelengths 
and intensities of energy radiated by the earth into space indi-
cate an object with a temperature of about –18 8 C. However, 
the average temperature at the earth’s surface is about 15 8 C. 
This 33 8 C difference between predicted and actual tempera-
ture results from heat trapped near the earth’s surface by the 
atmosphere ( fig. 23.2 ). This heat is trapped by the greenhouse 
gases, which include water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, 
ozone,  nitrous  oxide,  and  chlorofluorocarbons.  Notice  that 
several of these greenhouse gases are products of biological 
activity.  Like  the  glass  of  a  greenhouse,  these  gases  absorb 
infrared radiation emitted by a solar-heated earth and reemit 
most of that energy back to the earth.     

 Let’s look briefly at a budget of solar energy for the earth. 
About 30% of the solar energy shining on earth is reflected 
back into space by clouds, by particles in the atmosphere, or 
by the surface of the earth. Approximately 70% of the solar 
energy  shining  on  the  earth  is  absorbed  either  by  the  atmo-
sphere  or  by  the  earth’s  surface.  This  energy  is  reemitted 
as  infrared  radiation.  Some  of  the  infrared  radiation  from 
the  atmosphere  is  radiated  into  space,  and  some  is  radiated 
toward the surface of the earth. Most of the infrared radiation 
from the earth’s surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases in 
the  atmosphere  and  radiated  back  to  the  earth’s  surface.  By 
radiating infrared radiation back to the earth’s surface, green-
house  gases  trap  heat  energy  and  raise  the  earth’s  surface 
temperature. 

 We  should  remember  that  the  atmosphere  is  not  static. 
The atmosphere and the oceans are in continuous motion as 
a  consequence  of  the  uneven  heating  of  the  earth’s  surface. 
In chapters 2 and 3 we reviewed the major patterns of atmo-
spheric  and  oceanic  circulation  (see  figs.  2.4,  2.5,  and  3.5). 
These  circulatory  systems  link  the  various  regions  of  the 
globe  into  a  single  physical  system  by  moving  heat  energy 
and  materials  from  one  part  of  the  biosphere  to  another. 
Because of global circulation, pollutants produced in one part 
of the globe eventually reach all parts of the globe. 

 Biological activity is largely responsible for the current 
composition  of  earth’s  atmosphere,  particularly  the  concen-
trations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane. While the 
effect  of  life  on  atmospheric  composition  is  usually  associ-
ated with human activity, major biological influences on the 
atmosphere began about 2 billion years ago. The early atmo-
sphere lacked oxygen and likely contained higher concentra-
tions  of  carbon  dioxide  and  hydrogen. Atmospheric  oxygen 
began  increasing  about  2  billion  years  ago  with  the  appear-
ance of oxygen-producing photosynthesis. 

 Figure 23.1   Oasis in space: earthrise over the moon’s horizon.

neighbor in the solar system ( fig. 23.1 ). The human response 
to the sight of the earth framed by a bleak lunar landscape is 
captured by the words of the  Apollo 8  astronauts: “ The earth 
from here is a grand oasis in the . . . vastness of space.”     

 That  image,  of  earth  as  a  shining  blue  ball  against  the 
blackness of space, instantaneously changed the perspective 
that most people held of the planet and made it easier to think 
of the earth as a single ecological system. 

 At the beginning of the twenty-first century, it is impor-
tant  that  we  keep  that  perspective  alive.  The  rapid  pace  of 
global change challenges ecologists to study ecological phe-
nomena at a global scale. Peter Vitousek (1994) pointed out 
that  this  is  the  first  generation  in  history  with  the  tools  to 
examine how humanity has changed the earth. However, he 
also reminds us that this may be the last generation that has 
a chance to affect the course of those changes significantly. 

 Because  many  global-scale  phenomena  are  mediated 
through the atmosphere, let’s look briefly at the structure and 
origins of earth’s atmospheric system.  

  The Atmospheric Envelope 
and the Greenhouse Earth  
 The earth is wrapped in an atmospheric envelope that makes 
the biosphere a hospitable place for life as we know it. Clean, 
dry air at the earth’s surface is approximately 78.08% nitro-
gen,  20.94%  oxygen,  0.93%  argon,  0.03%  carbon  dioxide, 
and  less  than  0.00005%  ozone.  Air  also  contains  variable 
concentrations of water vapor and trace quantities of helium, 
hydrogen,  krypton,  methane,  and  neon.  The  concentrations 
of  these  gases  change  with  altitude.  The  highest  concentra-
tions of atmospheric gases occur in the     troposphere    ,  a layer 
extending from the earth’s surface to an altitude of 9 to 16 km. 
However,  ozone  is  most  concentrated  in  the      stratosphere    ,  
which extends from the troposphere outward to an altitude of

 James Walker (1986) referred to the shift in atmospheric 
composition that eventually produced today’s aerobic atmo-
sphere  as  “the  most  severe  pollution  episode  in  the  history 
of  the  earth.”  Why  did  he  refer  to  oxygen  as  a  pollutant? 
To answer this question we need to remember what sorts of 
organisms inhabited the earth of 2 billion years ago. The first 
life-forms  appeared  about  3.5  billion  years  ago.  Geologi-
cal evidence indicates that the atmosphere when these early 
organisms lived was free of oxygen. Consequently, the earli-
est organisms were anaerobes, for which oxygen is a deadly 
poison. As  is  widely  known,  the  composition  of  the  atmo-
sphere is once again changing, this time in response to human 
activity. 

 Our  discussion  begins  with  a  large-scale  atmosphere-
ocean  system  that  has  global  effects  on  ecological  systems. 
From this general discussion of climatic systems we review 
some key human influences on the biosphere. Vitousek (1994) 
discussed  three  aspects  of  global  change  caused  by  human 
activity:  (1)  changes  in  the  nitrogen  cycle,  (2)  changes  in 
landscapes,  and  (3)  changes  in  atmospheric  CO 2 .  Because 
these  environmental  changes  influence  global  climate  and 
biological diversity ( fig. 23.3 ), it is important to understand 
their causes and interactions.

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 23.5  Discuss the history of how the Southern Oscillation 

was discovered.

 23.6  Explain the relationship between the Southern Oscil-

lation and El Niño and La Niña.

 23.7  Outline oceanic and climatic conditions during El 

Niños and La Niñas.

 23.8  Discuss the influences of the El Niño Southern 

Oscillation on populations and ecosystems around 
the world.

  The El Niño Southern Oscillation, a large-scale atmospheric 
and oceanic phenomenon, influences ecological systems on 
a global scale.   Large-scale atmospheric and oceanic systems 
exert  global-scale  influences  on  ecological  systems.  One  of 
the most thoroughly studied of these large-scale systems is the 
 El  Niño  Southern  Oscillation.   The  name      El  Niño     originated 
when this climatic system seemed limited to the west coast of 
South America.  During  an  El  Niño,  a  warm  current  appears

off the west coast of Peru, generally during the Christmas sea-
son  (El  Niño  refers  to  the  Christ  child). The  term      Southern 
Oscillation    refers to an oscillation in atmospheric pressure that 
extends across the Pacific Ocean. Before we discuss the behav-
ior and effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, let’s review 
the historical origins of our present-day knowledge of the sys-
tem. This knowledge, which we take for granted today, took 
most of the twentieth century to gather.  

   The Historical Thread 
 In  1904,  Gilbert  Walker,  a  British  mathematician,  was 
appointed Director General of Observatories in India. Walker 
arrived in India shortly after a disastrous famine from 1899 
to 1900 caused by crop failures during a drought. This tragic 
event led him to search for a way to predict the rainfall asso-
ciated  with  the  Asian  monsoons.  Walker  (1924)  eventually 
found a correspondence between barometric pressure across 
the Pacific Ocean and the amount of rain falling during the 
monsoons. He found that reduced barometric pressure in the 
eastern  Pacific  was  accompanied  by  increased  barometric 
pressure  in  the  western  Pacific.  In  a  similar  fashion,  when 
the  barometric  pressure  fell  in  the  western  Pacific,  it  rose 
in the eastern Pacific. Walker called this oscillation in baro-
metric pressure the Southern Oscillation.

Strongly negative values of 
the Southern Oscillation Index 
are associated with El Niño 
events and strongly positive 
values with La Niña events.

 Figure 23.4   The Southern Oscillation Index shows the difference 
in barometric pressures between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia.

 Today, meteorologists monitor the state of the Southern 
Oscillation with the Southern Oscillation Index. The value of the 
index  is  determined  by  the  difference  in  barometric  pres-
sure between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia ( fig. 23.4 ). Walker 
noticed  that  low  values  of  the  Southern  Oscillation  Index 
were  associated  with  drought  in Australia,  Indonesia,  India, 
and  parts  of Africa. Walker  also  suggested  that  winter  tem-
peratures in Canada were somehow connected to the Southern 
Oscillation. His studies led him to a global perspective on cli-
mate, a perspective well ahead of his time. Walker was highly 
criticized for suggesting a climatic link between such widely 
separated regions. However, he did not waver from his view. 
He  assured  his  critics  that  the  climatic  connection  between 
regions would eventually be explained when the proper mea-
surements could be made.     

 The  connection  between  Walker’s  Southern  Oscillation 
and patterns of ocean temperature during El Niños was even-
tually  described  by  Jacob  Bjerknes  (1966,  1969),  a  profes-
sor at the University of California at Los Angeles. Bjerknes 
began developing his capacity for large-scale perspectives as 
a young scientist in Norway, where he worked on the dynam-
ics of storms in temperate regions. His later work produced a 
global perspective that connected El Niño with the Southern 
Oscillation, which Walker had studied 40 years earlier. 

 Bjerknes was able to connect the Southern Oscillation with 
El Niño because of a fortuitous coincidence. A strong El Niño 
from 1957 to 1958 coincided with the International Geophysi-
cal Year,  during  which  oceanographic  vessels  made  simulta-
neous observations across the Pacific and Indian Oceans. For 
the first time, scientists had extensive oceanographic data dur-
ing a strong El Niño. Those data showed that the warm waters 

510

associated with El Niño were not limited to the west coast of 
South America but extended far out into the Pacific Ocean. 

 Bjerknes proposed that the gradient in sea surface temper-
ature across the central Pacific Ocean produces a large-scale 
atmospheric circulation system that moves in the plane of the 
equator, as shown in  figure 23.5 . Air over the warmer western 
Pacific rises, flows eastward in the upper atmosphere, and then 
sinks over the eastern Pacific. This air mass then flows west-
ward along with the southeast trade winds, gradually warming 
and gathering moisture. This westward-flowing air eventually 

During a La Niña, the location 
of storm generation in the 
Pacific moves westward.

During an El Niño, the location 
of major storm generation 
moves eastward.

joins  the  rising  air  in  the  western  Pacific. As  this  warm  and 
moist air rises, it forms rain clouds. Bjerknes called this atmo-
spheric system     Walker circulation    after Sir Gilbert Walker.     
 Bjerknes, like Walker before him, possessed a global per-
spective  before  it  became  commonplace.  Eugene  Rasmusson 
(1985) referred to Bjerknes’s model, which coupled oceanic and 
atmospheric circulation, as a “grand hypothesis.” This hypoth-
esis  stimulated  decades  of  research  and  has  led  to  a  greatly 
enhanced understanding of the El Niño Southern Oscillation.  

  El Niño and La Niña 
 The El Niño Southern Oscillation is a highly dynamic, large-scale 
weather system that involves variation in sea surface temperature 
and barometric pressure across the Pacific and Indian Oceans. 
We discuss the El Niño Southern Oscillation here because recent 
discoveries show that this system drives a great deal of climatic 
variability around the globe. This system affects the climate of 
North America, South America, Australia, southern Asia, Africa, 
and parts of southern Europe ( fig. 23.6 ). This climatic variability 
has substantial influences on the distribution of organisms, struc-
ture of communities, and ecosystem processes.     

 During the mature phase of an El Niño, the sea surface 
in  the  eastern  tropical  Pacific  Ocean  is  much  warmer  than 
average and the barometric pressure over the eastern Pacific 
is lower than average. The combination of warm sea surface 
temperatures and low barometric pressure promotes the for-
mation of storms over the eastern Pacific Ocean. These storms 
bring  increased  precipitation  to  much  of  North  and  South 
America. During an El Niño, the sea surface in the western 
Pacific is cooler than average and the barometric pressure is 
higher than average. These conditions produce drought over 
much of the western Pacific region, including Australia.

 Periods  of  lower  sea  surface  temperature  and  higher 
than  average  barometric  pressure  in  the  eastern  tropical 
Pacific have been named     La Niñas    .  La Niña brings drought 
to  much  of  North  and  South America.  During  La  Niñas,  a 
pool  of  warm  seawater  moves  far  into  the  western  Pacific. 
This warm water combined with lower barometric pressures 
in the western Pacific Ocean generates many storms. Con-
sequently, La Niña brings higher than average precipitation 
to the western Pacific. It appears that La Niñas and El Niños 
represent opposite extremes in the El Niño Southern Oscil-
lation cycle. 

 While  often  associated  with  the  tropics,  the  influence 
of  the  El  Niño  Southern  Oscillation  extends  well  into  tem-
perate  regions.  For  instance,  El  Niños  are  associated  with 
higher  than  average  precipitation  over  much  of  the  western 
and southeastern United States and adjacent regions of Mex-
ico.  La  Niñas  are  consistently  associated  with  drought  over 
most  of  the  same  region. The  El  Niño  Southern  Oscillation 
also  affects  temperatures  over  large  geographic  areas.  Dur-
ing  El  Niños,  much  of  the  northern  United  States,  Canada, 
and Alaska are much warmer than average. During La Niñas, 
these regions are colder than average. As you might expect, 
this global climate system affects ecological systems around 
the globe.  

  El Niño and Marine Populations 
 Some  of  the  most  dramatic  ecological  responses  to  El  Niño 
occur  in  marine  populations  along  the  west  coast  of  South 
America. Long before the recent discovery of the global extent 
of its effects, El Niño was known to produce declines in coastal 
populations  of  anchovies  and  sardines  and  the  seabirds  that 
feed  upon  them.  How  does  El  Niño  induce  these  population 
declines? They are produced by changes in the pattern of sea 
surface  temperatures  and  coastal  circulation.   Figure  23.7  b  
shows  sea  surface  temperatures  off  the  west  coast  of  South 
America during average conditions. Notice that under average 
conditions, coastal waters are relatively cool along most of the 

west coast of South America and that a tongue of cool water 
extends  westward  toward  the  open  Pacific  Ocean.  This  cool 
water is brought to the surface by upwelling. Upwelling along 
the  coast  is  driven  by  the  southeast  trade  winds,  while  the 
offshore upwelling is driven by the east winds of the Walker 
circulation.     

 With the onset of an El Niño, the easterly winds slacken 
and the pool of warm water in the western Pacific moves east-
ward.  Eventually  this  pool  of  warm  water  reaches  the  west 
coast of South America and then moves north and south along 
the coast ( fig. 23.7  a ). During the mature phase of an El Niño, 
the warm surface water along the west coast of South America 
shuts off upwelling. Consequently, the supply of nutrients that 
upwelling  usually delivers to surface waters is also shut off. 
A lower nutrient supply reduces primary production by phy-
toplankton.  This  decline  in  primary  production  reduces  the 
supply of food available to consumers in the coastal food web 
and  is  followed  by  declines  in  populations  of  fish  and  their 
predators. 

 Remote  sensing  of  phytoplankton  pigments  in  surface 
waters  around  the  Galápagos  Islands  shows  that  the  1982–
1983  El  Niño  reduced  average  primary  production  and  dra-
matically  changed  the  location  of  production  “hot  spots.” 
 Figure  23.8   shows   the  concentration  of  phytoplankton  pig-
ments,  mainly  chlorophyll   a,   around  the  Galápagos  Islands 
before and during the 1982–1983 El Niño. The image made 
on  February  1,  1983,  shows  the  normal  patterns  when  the 
southeast trade winds produce upwelling on the western sides 
of the islands. These upwelling areas, which are shown in red 
and orange, are especially apparent west of the large islands 
of  Fernandina  and  Isabela.  Large  areas  of  high  phytoplank-
ton  production  extended  for  approximately  150  km  west  of 
these  islands.  On  February  1,  the  mean  pigment  concentra-
tion for surface waters around the Galápagos archipelago was 
0.30 mg per cubic meter.   

 A shift in wind direction reduced average phytoplankton 
biomass  and  shifted  the  location  of  high  production  areas. 
After  February  1,  the  trade  winds  became  progressively

weaker and variable in direction. By March 28, the areas of 
high phytoplankton biomass had shifted far to the east. 

 Changes in the rate and distribution of primary produc-
tion, such as those shown in  figure 23.8 , induced reproduc-
tive failure, migration, and widespread death among seabird 
populations in the Galápagos Islands and along the west coast 
of South America during the 1982–1983 El Niño. Many sea-
birds abandoned their nests with the onset of this El Niño and 
migrated either north or south along the coast of South Amer-
ica. Virtually no birds reproduced and most of the migrating 
birds  starved.  Population  declines  were  dramatic. The  adult 
populations  of  three  seabird  species  on  the  coast  of  Peru 
declined from 6.01 million to 330,000 between March 1982 
and May 1983, a population decline of approximately 95%. 

 The 1982–1983 El Niño also had a major impact on fur 
seal  and  sea  lion  populations,  mainly  through  reductions  in 
food supply ( fig. 23.9 ). Fur seals and sea lions both feed on 
fish.  The  main  food  fish  for  the  South  American  fur  seal, 
 Arctocephalus australis,  is the anchoveta,  Engraulis ringens. 
Engraulis   normally  lives  at  depths  of  0  to  40  m.  However, 
during the 1982–1983 El Niño, it moved away from fur seal 
colonies to cooler water at depths of up to 100 m.     

 In  response,  fur  seals  dived  deeper  and  shifted  their 
diets to other fishes. Both on the mainland and on the Galá-
pagos,  female  fur  seals  increased  their  foraging  time.  Since 
females are away from their young while foraging, the pups

a rocky island. Populations of southern fur seals off the Pacific coast of 
South America and around the Galápagos Islands are decimated when

in both populations did not get enough food and all died. On 
the  Galápagos,  nearly  100%  of  mature  male  fur  seals  died, 
while the mortality of adult females and nonterritorial males 
was approximately 30%. A large fur seal colony at Punta San 
Juan, Peru, declined from 6,300 to 4,200 individuals. 

 As  the  previous  examples  show,  El  Niño  has  well- 
documented  effects  on  marine  populations  along  the  coast

of South America. However, as we shall see in the following 
examples, El Niño can have ecological effects that extend far 
from the west coast of South America.  

  El Niño and the Great Salt Lake 
 El Niño can influence weather in continental areas far from the 
central Pacific Ocean (see  fig. 23.6 ). The exceptionally strong El 
Niño of 1982 to 1983 was the source of many  moisture-bearing 
storms that penetrated deep into the interior of North America. 
These  storms  substantially  increased  precipitation  within  the 
basin of the Great Salt Lake. Another wet period, within this lake 
basin, soon followed with the El Niño of 1986 to 1987. The effects 
of increased precipitation on the Great Salt Lake ecosystem were 
dramatic. Between 1983 and 1987, the level of the lake rose 3.7 m 
and its salinity decreased from over 100 to 50 g per liter. 

 Wayne  Wurtsbaugh  and  Therese  Smith  Berry  of  Utah 
State University documented the ecological responses to these 
physical changes (Wurtsbaugh and Smith Berry 1990; Wurts-
baugh 1992). Prior to the 1982–1983 El Niño, high salinity 
limited the zooplankton community of the Great Salt Lake to 
a few salt-tolerant species, especially the brine shrimp,  Arte-
mia franciscana.  How high was the salinity of the lake? For 
comparison, the salinity of the open ocean is about 34 to 35 g 
per liter. At 100 g per liter, the lake’s salinity was nearly three 
times that of seawater. However, by 1985 to 1987, the lake’s 
salinity  dropped  to  approximately  50  g  per  liter,  only  50% 
higher than seawater, and the open lake was invaded by the 
predaceous insect  Trichocorixa verticalis.  

 Wurtsbaugh and Smith Berry found that the invasion of 
the  predatory  insects  induced  a  trophic  cascade  (see  chap-
ter 18) in the pelagic zone of the Great Salt Lake ( fig. 23.10 ). 
Predation  reduced  the  population  of  brine  shrimp  from 
approximately  12,000  to  74  per  cubic  meter.  Though  other 
grazing  zooplankton  moved  into  the  lake  when  its  salinity 
dropped, the overall grazing rate was still greatly reduced. As 
predicted  by  the  trophic  cascade  model,  phytoplankton  bio-
mass increased significantly. This increase in phytoplankton 
biomass was accompanied by reduced water transparency and 
greatly reduced nutrient concentrations in lake water.   

 Then from 1987 to 1990, the level of the lake fell 2.8 m 
and  the  salinity  returned  to  over  100  g  per  liter.  With  this 
increase in salinity, nearly all the changes observed in the Great 
Salt Lake ecosystem were reversed.  Trichocorixa  was elimi-
nated from the open lake, brine shrimp populations increased, 
and  phytoplankton  biomass  declined.  This  example  shows 
how  a  large-scale  climate  system  can  control  local  commu-
nity and ecosystem structure and processes. This example also 
suggests  that  ecological  responses  to  global  climate  change 
are  complicated  by  biological  interactions  and  phenomena 
such as trophic cascades and keystone species effects.

abundant rainfall. Because of the El Niño Southern Oscilla-
tion,  much  of Australia  alternates  between  periods  of  scar-
city and plenty. This environmental fluctuation has profound 
effects on populations of animals and plants. 

  Episodic Establishment by Perennial Plants 
 Many plants infrequently establish new cohorts of seedlings. 
Episodic plant establishment is particularly common in arid 
and semiarid regions. Graham Harrington (1991) studied the 
effects  of  soil  moisture  on  survival  of  the  narrow-leaf  hop-
bush,   Dodonaea  attenuata,   in  a  semiarid  grass  and  shrub 
community  in  New  South Wales, Australia.  Over  a  97-year 
period from 1884 to 1981, there were apparently only three 

514

periods of widespread establishment of this plant: during the 
1890s, in 1952, and in 1974. All three of these periods were 
associated  with  the  La  Niña  side  of  the  El  Niño  Southern 
Oscillation.  This  association  suggests  that  plant  community 
structure over much of Australia is significantly influenced by 
the El Niño Southern Oscillation. However, more quantitative 
studies  of  plant  establishment  in Australia  will  be  required 
before we can fully understand its relationship to this climate 
system. A great deal more quantitative information is avail-
able on the effects of climate on kangaroo populations.  

  El Niño and Kangaroo Populations 
 The influences of the El Niño Southern Oscillation on  Australian 
populations are clearly reflected in the biology of the red kan-
garoo,  Macropus rufus.  This animal, which can reach a weight 
of 93 kg and a length of about 2.5 m, is the largest of the kan-
garoos and the largest of the Australian herbivores ( fig. 23.11 ). 
As we saw in chapter 9, red kangaroos occupy nearly the entire 
arid and semiarid interior of Australia (see fig. 9.2). The range 
occupied by red kangaroos is a region where occasional moist 
periods are interspersed with severe droughts.     

 The reproductive biology of the red kangaroo is not tied to 
any fixed seasonal cycle but responds rapidly to changing environ-
mental conditions, particularly increased rainfall and vegetative 
production.  Neville  Nicholls  (1992)  described  the  reproductive 
response of red kangaroos to a wet period as follows. During wet 
years, when food is plentiful, female red kangaroos will simul-
taneously  have  a  juvenile,  or  “joey,”  following  her,  a  younger 
offspring in her pouch nursing, and a quiescent embryo that will 
enter the pouch as soon as the current occupant leaves. As soon 
as this replacement occurs, the mother mates again, producing 
another embryo that will develop to the point where it is ready to 
enter the pouch. These relay tactics enable female red kangaroos 
to produce independent offspring at 240-day intervals. 

 Under  marginal  conditions,  females  continue  to  repro-
duce.  However,  most  young  die  soon  after  they  leave  the 
pouch. If food becomes even more scarce, females will stop 
lactating  and  the  young  die  in  the  embryo  stage.  Red  kan-
garoos  stop  breeding  only  in  response  to  severe,  prolonged 
droughts. During droughts, these kangaroos wander widely in 
search of food. Females range over areas greater than 18 km 2  
and males over areas of about 36 km 2 . During severe droughts, 
females, which may reach sexual maturity as young as 15 to 
20 months old, may not breed until they are over 3 years old. 
 When abundant rains finally come, the female hormonal 
system  responds  rapidly.  The  kangaroos  breed  quickly  and 
young  enter  the  pouch  within  60  days  of  the  onset  of  sig-
nificant  rainfall.  Nicholls  suggests  that  this  strategy  ensures 
a  short  interval  between  the  return  of  good  conditions  and 
recruitment  of  young  into  the  population.  By  reproducing 
large  numbers  of  young  when  conditions  are  favorable,  the 
animals increase the size of the adult population that will face 
each drought induced by El Niño. 

 Stuart  Cairns  and  Gordon  Grigg  (1993)  quantified  how 
rainfall  in  southern  Australia  affected  populations  of  red 
 kangaroos ( fig. 23.12 ). The study population reached a peak 
of 2,175,000 in 1981 and then declined to 745,000 by 1984. 
This  decline  was  a  response  to  drought  associated  with  the 
1982–1983 El Niño. The population rebounded in 1985, held 
approximately steady through 1986, but then declined some-
what in 1987, during another El Niño. Then, in the last of the 
records analyzed by Cairns and Grigg, the population began 
to  grow  rapidly  in  response  to  the  abundant  rains  and  plant 
production induced by the 1988–1989 La Niña. This record 
suggests  a  tight  coupling  of   M.  rufus   populations  to  the  El 
Niño  Southern  Oscillation. This  coupling  is  a  mirror  image 
of the influences of El Niño on Galápagos finch populations 
(see fig. 11.17).     

 In  many  situations,  biologists  studying  local  popula-
tions  must  consider  the  influences  of  large-scale  systems 
such  as  the  El  Niño  Southern  Oscillation.  Increasingly,

ecologists must consider the effects of human modifications 
of the global environment. Because of the increasing size of 
the human population and the intensity of human activity, we 
are rapidly modifying global nutrient cycles, the face of the 
land, and even the composition of the atmosphere. The effects 
of the growing human population on the global environment 
are the subject of the next three sections. 

  Concept 23.1 Review 

1.   How are the influences of El Niño and La Niña related 
to the concepts of top-down versus bottom-up control 
of populations, communities, and ecosystems (p. 401)?  
2.   How  does  the  example  of  El  Niño  and  the  Great  Salt 
Lake confound the concepts of top-down and bottom-up 
control?  

3.   The example of El Niño and the Great Salt Lake might 
lead  us  to  what  general  conclusion  concerning  the 
 concepts of top-down and bottom-up control?        

  23.2   Human Activity and 

the Global Nitrogen Cycle 

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 23.9  Summarize the major contributors of fixed nitrogen 

to the global nitrogen cycle, including human and 
nonhuman sources.

 23.10  Describe the increase in human contributions to the 

global nitrogen cycle during the twentieth century.

Human activity has greatly increased the quantity of fixed 
nitrogen  cycling  through  the  biosphere.   When  we 
reviewed the nitrogen cycle in chapter 19, we saw that nitro-
gen enters the cycle through the process of nitrogen fixation. 
For millions of years, the only organisms that could fix nitro-
gen  were  nitrogen-fixing  bacteria  and  some  actinomycete 
fungi. Then, as humans developed intensive agricultural and 
industrial processes that fix nitrogen, we began to manipulate 
the nitrogen cycle on a massive scale. 

 How  has  human  activity  altered  the  nitrogen  cycle? To 
address  this  question,  we  need  to  review  the  sources  and 
amounts of nitrogen fixed in the absence of human manipu-
lation. Vitousek  (1994)  summarized  the  natural  background 
levels  of  nitrogen  fixation  as  follows: The  nitrogen  fixed  in 
terrestrial environments by free-living nitrogen-fixing bacte-
ria and nitrogen-fixing plants totals approximately 100 terra-
grams (Tg) of nitrogen (N) per year (1 Tg  5  10 12  g). Nitrogen 
fixation in marine environments adds an additional 5 to 20 Tg 
N per year; fixation by lightning adds about 10 Tg N per year. 
These estimates of nonhuman sources of fixed nitrogen total 
approximately 130 Tg N per year. 

 Human  additions  to  the  nitrogen  cycle  now  exceed 
historical sources of fixed nitrogen. One of the traditional 

ways  that  humans  have  manipulated  the  nitrogen  cycle  is 
by  planting  agricultural  land  with  nitrogen-fixing  crops. 
At some point, agriculturists learned that rotating legumes 
such as alfalfa and soybeans with grains such as oats and 
maize could increase crop yields. We now know that those 
increased grain yields are due mainly to nitrogen additions 
to the soil by the legumes. Vitousek estimated that  nitrogen- 
fixing crops fix about 30 Tg N per year. Agriculturists also 
apply nitrogen fertilizers produced through industrial pro-
cesses that fix nitrogen. The nitrogen fixed by the fertilizer 
industry amounts to more than 80 Tg N per year. Finally, 
Vitousek  estimated  that  the  internal  combustion  engines 
in cars, trucks, and other conveyances emit about 25 Tg N 
per  year  as  oxides  of  nitrogen.  V.  Smil  (1990)  estimated 
the total emission of nitrogen from all combustion of fos-
sil fuels, including coal-fired electrical generation as well 
as  internal  combustion  engines,  at  35 Tg  N  per  year. The 
main  point  here  is  that  nitrogen  fixation  resulting  from 
human activity fixes more nitrogen (135–145 Tg N versus 
130  Tg  N)  than  all  other  sources  of  fixed  nitrogen  com-
bined ( fig. 23.13 ).   

 The massive human contribution to the global nitrogen 
cycle  is  a  recent  phenomenon.  For  instance,  the  industrial 
production of fertilizers dates from the early twentieth cen-
tury,  and Vitousek  estimated  that  50%  of  all  the  commer-
cial  fertilizer  produced  prior  to  1993  was  applied  to  land 
between  1982  and  1993.   Figure  23.14   shows  that  human 
contributions  to  the  global  nitrogen  cycle  have  increased 
exponentially.     

 By creating environmental conditions favorable to some 
species and unfavorable to others, large-scale nitrogen enrichment 
threatens  the  health  of  ecosystems  and  biological  diversity. 
As we shall see in the next section, however, changes in land 
cover pose a more direct threat to biological diversity.

  23.3  Changes in Land Cover  
LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 23.11  List some major changes to land cover as a result of 

human activity.

 23.12  Discuss global patterns in tropical deforestation.
 23.13  Explain how edge effects compound the impacts of 

tropical deforestation.

Rapid changes in global patterns of land use threaten bio-
logical diversity.   Humans have changed the face of the earth. 
Human  activities,  mainly  agriculture  and  urbanization,  have 
significantly altered one-third to one-half of the ice-free land 
surface of the earth. Marshes have been drained and filled to 
build urban areas or airports. Tropical forests have been cut and 
converted to pasture. The courses of rivers have been changed. 
The Aral Sea in central Asia has been so starved for water that 
it is nearly dry. Vitousek suggested that changes in land cover 
may  be  the  greatest  single  threat  to  biological  diversity  (see 
 fig. 23.3 ). Let’s review some of the changes in land cover and 
the mechanisms that make landscape changes such a powerful 
threat to biological diversity. A widely cited example of land 
cover change is the cutting of tropical forests.  

   Tropical Deforestation 
 The  cutting  and  clearing  of  tropical  forests  continues  at  an 
alarming rate. This deforestation is alarming because tropical 
forests support half or more of earth’s species and appear to 
influence global climate. Eliminating these forests may lead 
to losses of thousands of potentially useful species and sub-
stantial  changes  in  world  climate.  In  the  face  of  worldwide 
concern,  we  need  accurate  estimates  of  the  state  of  tropical 
forests. However, estimates of deforestation rates vary widely. 
 How  much  tropical  forest  is  there?  How  much  tropical 
forest has been cut? What are the current rates of deforesta-
tion?  David  Skole  and  Compton  Tucker  (1993)  provide  us 
with  answers  to  some  of  these  questions.  These  research-
ers  reported  that  tropical  forest  occurs  in  73  countries  and 
once covered 11,610,350 km 2 . However, three-fourths of the 
world’s tropical forests occur in just 10 countries ( fig. 23.15 ). 
The largest single tract of tropical forest, nearly one-third of 
the total, occurs in Brazil. Brazil is also the country with the 
highest rate of deforestation.   

 While  there  has  been  general  agreement  that  rates  of 
deforestation in Brazil are high, estimates of those rates vary 
widely. Skole and Tucker set out to provide an accurate esti-
mate of deforestation rates in the Amazon Basin. They based 
their estimate on photographs taken by  Landsat  satellites in 
1978  and  1988.  The  images  they  used,   Landsat   Thematic 
Mapper photos, provide high-resolution information. As you 
can  see  in   figure  23.16 ,  Thematic  Mapper  photos  clearly 
show  areas  of  deforestation,  regrowth  on  deforested  plots, 
and areas of isolated forest. Skole and Tucker entered these 
high-resolution images into a geographic information system 
(see chapter 22, pp. 503–504), which they used to create com-
puterized maps of deforestation within the Amazon Basin.

 Let’s look at the maps in  figure 23.17  and see what they 
tell us. First, notice that large areas—cerrado—colored light 
brown  in  the  map,  were  not  forested.  These  areas,  concen-
trated  in  the  southeastern  Amazon  Basin,  have  a  semiarid 
climate and support scrubby vegetation. Some areas, shown 
in light violet, were covered by clouds and could not be ana-
lyzed. Skole and Tucker used the 1978 image to estimate the 
amount of deforestation that had occurred prior to 1978. They 
then  compared  the  1978  and  1988  photos  to  determine  the 
amount of deforestation during that decade. They divided the 
Amazon Basin into 16 km by 16 km squares for their analy-
sis. One of those areas is enlarged in an inset on  figure 23.17 . 
These  insets  show  the  amount  of  deforestation  in  1978  and 
in 1988. Notice that the deforested area in the inset increased 
significantly between 1978 and 1988.     

 Skole and Tucker used their analyses of 16 km by 16 km 
areas to estimate the percentage of the land surface that had 
been  deforested  across  the  entire  Amazon  Basin.  On  their 
maps, white indicates completely forested areas, while vari-
ous  colors  indicate  increasing  degrees  of  deforestation.  At 
one end of their spectrum, gray indicates 0.25% to 5% defor-
ested; at the other end, red indicates 90% to 100% deforested. 
Notice that the color of the area covered by the inset is purple 
on the 1978 map and green on the 1988 map. Change in color 
on the map of the entire basin from 1978 to 1988 reflects the 
increase in deforested area during that period. 

 How much of the Brazilian Amazon has been deforested? 
Skole and Tucker estimated that by 1978, 78,000 km 2  had been 
deforested. They also estimated that the annual rate of defor-
estation  between  1978  and  1988  was  about  15,000  km 2   per 
year. While this estimate indicates considerable deforestation, 
it is considerably lower than earlier estimates that ranged from 
21,000 to 80,000 km 2  per year. Skole and Tucker estimated that 
the total area deforested by 1988 was 230,000 km 2 . This esti-
mate, which was slightly lower than the official estimate by the 
Brazilian government, is probably the most accurate estimate 
of deforestation within the Amazon Basin made to date. 

  Edge Effects and Forest Fragmentation 
 The area of forest removed does not give a complete picture of 
the ecological effects of deforestation. When a tract of forest 
is cut, the adjacent forest is affected by changes in the physi-
cal environment along its edges, by reduced habitat area, and 
by isolation. Let’s look at the nature of these “edge effects” in 
Amazonian forest fragments. 

 In 1979, Brazil’s National Institute for Research in Ama-
zonia  and  the World Wildlife  Fund  began  a  long-term  study 
of  tropical  forest  fragmentation.  This  research  project  took 
advantage  of  a  Brazilian  law  that  requires  that  50%  of  land 
developed in the Amazon Basin remain forested. The research-
ers  worked  with  ranchers  to  leave  forested  tracts  in  particu-
lar areas to facilitate research on the ecological influences of

ferent physical environments than intact forest. 

forest fragment size and isolation. The fragments studied were 
1, 10, 100, and 200 ha ( fig. 23.18 ). These were compared to 
areas of 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 ha in undisturbed forest.   

 When  a  small  fragment  of  forest  is  isolated  by  cut-
ting  the  surrounding  forest,  its  edge  is  exposed  to  greater 
amounts of solar radiation and wind. Wind and sun combine 
to change the physical environment within forest fragments. 
The  physical  environment  along  forest  edges  is  hotter  and 
drier  and  the  intensity  of  solar  radiation  is  higher.  These 
physical  changes,  in  turn,  affect  the  structure  of  the  forest 
community. Tree mortality is higher along the edges of for-
est  fragments  and  the  forest  overstory  decreases  while  the 
thickness of the understory vegetation increases. Fragmen-
tation  also  decreases  the  diversity  of  many  animal  groups, 
including monkeys, birds, bees, and carrion and dung bee-
tles.  Some  of  these  reductions  in  animal  populations  may 
have significant impacts on key ecological processes such as 
pollination and decomposition. 

 Because  edge  effects,  isolation,  and  reduced  habitat 
area negatively affect biological diversity within tropical for-
est  fragments,  Skole  and  Tucker  extended  their  analysis  of 
deforestation  in  the Amazon  Basin  to  include  these  effects. 
They  assumed  that  edge  effects  extend  for  1  km  from  the 
forest edge. Edge effects more than doubled the area—from 
230,000  to  588,000  km 2 —of Amazonian  forest  affected  by 
deforestation.  

  A Global Perspective 
 Skole  and  Tucker  provided  a  detailed  picture  of  land  cover 
changes  in  the Amazon  Basin.  However,  what  is  the  global 
rate of tropical deforestation? No one can answer this ques-
tion precisely, but the best estimates indicate that 52% to 64% 
of  tropical  deforestation  occurs  outside  Brazil.  Therefore,  a 
conservative estimate of the global rate of deforestation from 
1978 to 1988 would be approximately 30,000 km 2  per year. 

 How  much  land  cover  change  is  occurring  outside  the 
tropics? Though most people have focused on tropical defor-
estation, massive deforestation has occurred in temperate and 
boreal regions. As we saw in chapter 2, the temperate forest 
regions of Europe, eastern China, Japan, and North America 

 Figure 23.19   Deforestation is not limited to the tropics: 
 deforestation in a temperate forest of the Pacific Northwest of the 
United States.

support  some  of  the  densest  human  populations  on  earth. 
Large  areas  of  Europe  were  deforested  by  the  Middle Ages 
(Williams  1990),  and  much  of  the  forest  of  eastern  North 
America  was  cut  by  the  middle  1800s  (see  fig.  21.21). The 
majority  of  old-growth  temperate  forests  in  north  western 
North America has been cut ( fig. 23.19 ), and the remaining 
old-growth  forests  are  threatened  by  deforestation.  In  addi-
tion,  vast  areas  of  boreal  forest  are  being  cut  in  Russia  and 
Canada. As you can see, deforestation is not limited to tropi-
cal regions.     

 R. Kates, B. Turner, and W. Clark (1990) estimated that 
human  activity  has  transformed  approximately  half  the  ice-
free land cover of the earth. In the process, many of the major 
terrestrial biomes of the earth (see chapter 2) have been highly 
fragmented.  Others,  such  as  tropical  dry  forest,  have  been 
nearly eliminated by conversion to agriculture. Because of the 
negative effect of reduced area on diversity (see chapter 22), 
these massive land conversions present a major threat to global 
diversity. That is why Vitousek suggested that human-caused 
changes to land cover constitute the greatest direct threat to 
global diversity (see  fig. 23.3 ). However, land cover changes 
also have the potential to contribute, directly and indirectly, to 
rapid global climate change. One of the ways that deforesta-
tion may affect global climate is by altering the influence of 
forests  on  atmospheric  concentrations  of  CO 2 .  The  connec-
tion  between  atmospheric  composition,  human  activity,  and 
global climate is the subject of the next section. 

  Concept 23.3 Review 

      1.   Why is reducing forest area through deforestation a fun-

damental threat to biodiversity (see chapter 22)?  

     2.   How does fragmentation of habitat as a result of human 
changes  in  land  cover  threaten  populations  (see  chap-
ters 4, 10, and 21, pp. 94–95, 224–225 and 462–465)?  

     3.   Why  is  the  ecological  impact  of  deforestation  always 

greater than the area of forest removed?

 23.14  Discuss the essential role of literature search in sci-

entific research.

 23.15  Summarize tactics for conducting searches of the 

scientific literature.

 Throughout  this  series  of  discussions  of  investigating  the 
 evidence, we have emphasized one main source of evidence—
original research. While original research is the foundation on 
which science rests, our emphasis has neglected one of the most 
valuable  sources  of  information,  the  published  literature.  A 
researcher in any discipline needs to keep up with developments 
in his or her areas of interest and in related areas. In addition, 
some researchers may use published literature to weigh the evi-
dence for or against some hypothesis or theory. In the section 
in chapter 13 titled “Evidence for Competition in Nature” (see 
p. 000), we reviewed three studies that took such an approach. 
Students of ecology may use published literature to learn more 
about a particular subject, to read additional papers by research-
ers  whose  work  interests  them,  or  to  do  literature  surveys  in 
support  of  their  own  independent  research. As  pointed  out  in 
the preface of this book, however, the explosive pace of scien-
tific discovery makes staying current very difficult. Fortunately, 
there are now many databases and searching tools that can help. 
 The databases available for searching ecological literature 
are far too many to review here. So, we’ll focus on three con-
temporary  ones:   Biosis,  Cambridge  Scientific  Abstracts,   and

SciSearch,   which  are  widely  available  in  university  libraries 
and include many journals of significance to ecology. Some of 
their characteristics are listed in the accompanying table. 

 The  important  point  here  is  that  these  databases  provide 
access  to  millions  of  published  papers  often  covering  several 
decades of research. Of course, few people would want to spend 
the  time  laboriously  sorting  through  all  those  articles.  Fortu-
nately, each of these databases includes a powerful search tool 
that will help you locate articles of interest. Let’s consider some 
basic tips on how to use these tools to conduct an effective search. 
 You should generally begin your search by summarizing 
your  subject  or  research  interest.  Next,  divide  your  subject 
into  major  concepts  or  key  terms.  Be  sure  to  think  of  alter-
native  terms  for  the  same  subject—for  example,  beetles  or 
 Coleoptera,  daisy  or Asteraceae,  competition  or  interference. 
Next determine the time period in which you are interested. For 
instance, do you want only the most current literature on your 
subject or do you want all literature available in the database? 
 Once  you  have  your  terms  listed  and  have  selected  a 
time period, try a search using one or more terms. If you get 
too many references, too few references, or unwanted refer-
ences, you can use Boolean Logical Operators to adjust your 
search. The main Boolean Logical Operators are  and,   or,  and 
 not.   The operator  or  will  broaden  your search and will gener-
ally yield more references. For instance, the search specified 
by  “daisy   or   Asteraceae”  will  retrieve  references  contain-
ing  either  daisy  or  Asteraceae. In contrast the operator  and
will   narrow   your  search. The  search  specified  by  “daisy   or
Asteraceae   and   desert”  will  retrieve  references  containing 
either   daisy   or  Asteraceae,  but  restrict  the  list  of  references 

Human activity is changing the composition of the atmo-
sphere. 
 Industrial activity has increased steadily since about 
the  year  1800.  Over  the  same  period,  atmospheric  CO 2   has 
increased  steadily.  The  evidence  discussed  here  shows  that 
most of this atmospheric increase is due to the burning of fossil 
fuels. Vitousek pointed out that recent increases in atmospheric 
CO 2  concentration are likely to affect global climate and will 
certainly  affect  the  biota  of  all  terrestrial  ecosystems.  The 
effect of human activity on atmospheric CO 2  and other gases is 
one of the most thoroughly studied aspects of global ecology. 
 The  concentration  of  CO 2   in  the  atmosphere  has  been 
dynamic over much of earth’s history. Scientists have very 
carefully  reconstructed  atmospheric  composition  by  study-
ing air bubbles trapped in ice. As ice built up on glaciers in 
places such as Greenland and Antarctica, air spaces within 
the ice preserved a record of the ancient atmosphere. A record 
of  atmospheric  composition  during  the  last  160,000  years 
was extracted and analyzed by a joint team of scientists from 

 

Chapter 23

to  those  concerned  with  these  flowers  in   desert  areas.   The 
search specified by “daisy  or  Asteraceae  and  alpine” would 
yield literature on these flowers in alpine zones. If you want 
to exclude certain types of references from your search, you 
may choose to use the operator  not.  For example the search 
“daisy  or  Asteraceae  not  sunflower” will exclude references 
that include the term sunflower. 

 Another  useful  tool  for  refining  searches  is  the  wild 
card. A wild card is used to locate references including a par-

Selected electronic databases that cover the ecological literature

 This review is intended to suggest only general guide-
lines to searching literature. There are many other databases 
besides the ones listed here, and the creators of all of them 
work  very  hard  to  improve  the  functioning  of  their  prod-
ucts. As  a  consequence,  the  operating  details  of  the  vari-
ous  databases  are  highly  dynamic.  Therefore,  you  should 
periodically review the tips and instructions provided with 
any database that you might use. The main point of this dis-
cussion is to open a door to the rich world of ecological lit-
erature, to the world of discovery. Exploring that world can 
quickly extend your knowledge of the discipline of ecology 
far beyond the introduction provided by this textbook.

France  and  the  former  Soviet  Union  (Lorius  et  al.  1985; 
 Barnola et al. 1987). This international team studied a 2,083 m 
core of ice drilled by Soviet scientists and engineers near the 
Antarctic station of Vostok. Vostok, located in eastern Ant-
arctica at a latitude of over 78 8  S, has a mean annual tem-
perature  of  –55 8 C,  ideal  conditions  for  preserving  samples 
of the atmosphere in ice. The Vostok research station sits on 
the  high  antarctic  plateau,  where  the  ice  is  about  3,700  m 
thick. The  amazing  physical  feat  of  extracting  such  a  long 
ice core in such difficult physical circumstances is equaled 
by the dramatic climatic record contained within the Vostok 
ice core. 

 To extract air trapped within ice, scientists place sections 
of an ice core into a chamber and create a vacuum, remov-
ing traces of the current atmosphere in the process. The ice, 
still under vacuum, is then crushed and the air it contains is 
released  into  the  chamber.  Sampling  devices  then  measure 

the  CO 2   concentration  of  the  air  released  from  the  ice. The 
 Barnola team made 66 measurements of CO 2  along the length 
of the Vostok ice core. The scientists made measurements of 
CO 2  every 25 m along the length of the ice core from about 
850 m depth to the bottom of the core. These lower sections 
of the core correspond to ages from 50,000 to 160,000 years. 
Because there were many fractures in the core above 850 m 
depth, the upper portion of the core was generally sampled at 
intervals greater than 25 m. 

  Figure  23.20   shows  the  variation  in  CO 2   concentration 
revealed by the Vostok ice core. The core indicated two very 
large fluctuations in atmospheric CO 2  concentration. Overall, 
it shows that CO 2  concentrations have oscillated between low 
concentrations of approximately 190 to 200 parts per  million 
(ppm)  and  high  concentrations  of  260  to  280  ppm.  About 
160,000 years ago, the atmospheric concentration of CO 2  was 
less than 200 ppm. This early period in the Vostok ice core 

522 

Section VI

corresponds to an ice age. Then, about 140,000 years ago, the 
atmospheric concentration of CO 2  began to rise abruptly. This 
rise in CO 2  corresponds to a warmer interglacial period. High 
levels  of  CO 2   persisted  until  about  120,000  years  ago.  The 
concentration of CO 2  then declined and remained at relatively 
low concentrations until about 13,000 years ago, when atmo-
spheric CO 2  again increased abruptly.   

 Notice that the fluctuations in CO 2  within the Vostok ice 
core correspond to variation in temperature ( see fig. 23.20 ). 
The periods of low CO 2  correspond to the low temperatures 
 experienced during ice ages, while the periods of high CO 2  
correspond to warmer, interglacial periods. 

 The  most  recent  measurements  in  the  Vostok  ice  core 
are about 2,000 years old. How has atmospheric CO 2  varied 
during the most recent 2,000 years? W. Post and colleagues 
(1990)  assembled  atmospheric  CO 2   records  from  a  number 
of sources to estimate atmospheric concentrations during the 
last 1,000 years ( fig. 23.21 ). The first 700 years of the record 
come from the South Pole ice core, which was analyzed by 
Ulrich Siegenthaler and colleagues (1988) of the University 
of Bern, Switzerland. This record shows that the concentra-
tion  of  CO 2   remained  relatively  constant  for  approximately 
800 years. Another study at the University of Bern provided a 
CO 2  record for the most recent 200 years (Friedli et al. 1986). 
This  part  of  the  CO 2   record  comes  from  the  Siple  ice  core, 
from Siple Station at about 75 8  S latitude. While the Siple ice 
core does not allow us to look as far back in time as the Vostok 
record, it provides a very detailed estimate of recent concen-
trations of atmospheric CO 2 . H. Friedli and colleagues dated 
the beginning of the Siple record at about  a.d.  1744. At that 
time, about two and a half centuries ago, the atmospheric con-
centration of CO 2  was about 277 ppm. This estimated concen-
tration is almost identical to those made by the Siegenthaler 
team for the same time period using the South Pole ice core. 
Therefore,  both  the  South  Pole  and  Siple  ice  cores  indicate 
that the CO 2  concentration in the middle 1700s was approx-
imately  the  same  as  at  the  end  of  the Vostok  record,  about 
2,000 years earlier.       

 The  Siple  record  showed  that  CO 2   increased  exponen-
tially  from  1744  to  1953.  The  Friedli  team  estimated  the 
1953  concentration  of  CO 2   at  315  ppm.  However,  the  trace 
in CO 2  concentrations shown in  figure 23.21  extends beyond 
1953 and above 315 ppm. Where do these later measurements 
come from? These later CO 2  concentrations are direct mea-
surements made on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, by Charles Keeling 
and his associates over a period of about 40 years (Keeling 
and Whorf 1994). 

 Keeling’s  measurements  complement  the  ice  core  data 
from the Vostok, South Pole, and Siple stations in two ways. 
First,  they  extend  the  record  into  the  present.  Second,  they 
help  validate  the  measurements  of  CO 2   made  from  the  ice 
cores. How do Keeling’s measurements lend credence to the 
ice core data? Look carefully at the plot of CO 2  concentrations 
shown in  figure 23.21 . Notice that two of the measurements 
made from the Siple ice core overlap the period when Keel-
ing and his team made measurements at Mauna Loa. Notice 
also that the two estimates made independently by Keeling at 

Mauna Loa and by Friedli and his colleagues from the Siple 
ice core are almost identical. 

 The  data  in   figure  23.21   indicate  that  during  the  nine-
teenth  and  twentieth  centuries  the  concentration  of  atmo-
spheric  CO 2   increased  dramatically. This  period  of  increase 
coincides  with  the  Industrial  Revolution.  However,  what 
evidence  is  there  that  human  activity  caused  this  observed 

The CO2 concentration in the 
atmosphere has varied substantially 
over time, and temperature has 
varied directly with changing CO2.

increase? Vitousek provided evidence by pointing out that the 
annual increase in atmospheric carbon in the form of CO 2  is 
about  3,500  Tg  (1  Tg   5   10 12   g),  while  the  annual  burning 
of  fossil  fuels  releases  about  5,600  Tg  carbon  as  CO 2 .  So, 
fossil fuel burning alone produces more than enough CO 2  to 
account for recent increases in atmospheric concentrations. 

 If  we  look  carefully  at  the  pattern  of  CO 2   increase 
between  1860  and  1960  we  find  additional  evidence  for  a 
human  influence.   Figure  23.22   shows  three  interruptions  in 
the  otherwise  steady  increase  in  the  burning  of  fossil  fuels. 
Those periods correspond to three major disruptions of global 
economic  activity:  World  War  I,  the  Great  Depression,  and 
World War II. At the end of each of these major global upheav-
als, the increase in atmospheric CO 2  resumed. These patterns 
provide circumstantial evidence that humans are responsible 
for the modern increase in atmospheric CO 2 . However, there 
is also direct evidence.     

 Additional  evidence  that  human  industrial  activity  is 
at  the  heart  of  recent  increases  in  atmospheric  CO 2   comes 
from analyses of atmospheric concentrations of various car-
bon isotopes (see chapter 18). One of the most useful carbon 
isotopes  for  determining  the  contribution  of  fossil  fuels  to 
atmospheric CO 2  is radioactive  14 C. Because  14 C has a half-
life of 5,730 years, fossil fuels, which have been buried for 
millions  of  years,  contain  very  little  of  this  carbon  isotope. 
Consequently, burning fossil fuel adds CO 2  to an atmosphere 
that has little  14 C. If fossil fuel additions are a major source of 
increased atmospheric CO 2 , then the relative concentration of 
 14 C in the atmosphere should be declining. 

 A recent decline in atmospheric  14 C was first described 
by  Hans  Suess  (1955),  a  scientist  with  the  U.S.  Geologi-
cal  Survey.  Suess  made  his  discovery  by  analyzing  the   14 C 
content  of  wood.  He  analyzed  the   14 C  content  of  wood  laid 
down by single trees at various times during their growth. He 
found that annual growth rings laid down in the late 1800s had 

 Figure 23.23    The Suess effect (data from Bacastow and Keeling 1974). 

significantly higher concentrations of  14 C than those laid down 
in the 1950s. Suess proposed that the  14 C content in wood was 
being  progressively  reduced  because  burning  of  fossil  fuels 
was reducing the atmospheric concentration of  14 C. Because 
of his pioneering work, reduced atmospheric  14 C as a conse-
quence of fossil fuel burning is called the     Suess effect    .  

 Robert  Bacastow  and  Charles  Keeling  (1974)  compiled 
 14 C data from several studies of  14 C in trees and plotted the 
date when the wood was formed against the relative  14 C con-
tent of the wood. As  figure 23.23  shows, the concentration of 
 14 C was fairly stable from  a.d.  1700 until about 1850. After 
1850,  14 C concentrations in wood declined significantly. The 
line shows the predictions of  14 C made by a model built by 
Bacastow  and  Keeling. Their  model  made  these  predictions 
based  upon  global  patterns  of  fossil  fuel  burning  and  esti-
mated  rates  of  exchange  of  carbon  between  the  ocean,  the 
earth’s biota, and the atmosphere.    

  Depletion and Recovery 
of the Ozone Layer 
 In  1985,  scientists  of  the  British Antarctic  Survey  had  dis-
covered a major reduction in the amount of ozone, O 3 , in the 
stratosphere over the Antarctic. Stratospheric ozone absorbs 
potentially harmful ultraviolet light, particularly UV-B light, 
or radiation. Because high-energy, UV-B radiation is capable 
of destroying biological molecules and damaging living tis-
sue,  the  ozone  layer  is  critical  for  the  well-being  of  life  on 
earth.  The  British  scientific  team  also  analyzed  historical 
measurements of ozone, which demonstrated clearly that the 
total amount of ozone over the Antarctic had been declining 
since the 1970s. Depletion of earth’s ozone layer was not the 
first sign of human influence on the environment. However, it 
was a clear and dramatic indication that human impact on the 
environment had achieved truly global proportions. 

524 

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

 Though the ozone hole was centered over the Antarctic 
far from most human population centers, its discovery gener-
ated widespread concern. Perhaps the greatest fear was that 
the  breakdown  of  the  ozone  layer  over  the Antarctic  might 
be a prelude to breakdown of the protective ozone layer over 
the entire earth, endangering humans as well as crops, wild 
plants, and animals. Other scientists had warned that the ozone 
layer was threatened by human activities. However, it was the 
discovery of the ozone hole that aroused world concern and 
stimulated international action. Attention was quickly focused 
on stopping the production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, 
organic  chemicals  containing  carbon,  chlorine,  and  fluorine 
that were widely used as refrigerants. Because CFCs are very 
stable molecules, their concentrations in the atmosphere grad-
ually increased after their introduction in the 1930s. By the 
1970s,  the  concentrations  of  CFCs  had  been  increased  suf-
ficiently that they could be detected everywhere. 

 Chlorofluorocarbon molecules circulate in the lower atmo-
sphere long enough to eventually move into the stratosphere, 
where they are exposed to a great deal more highly energetic 
ultraviolet  light.  As  CFCs  break  down,  they  release  chlo-
rine, which can act as a catalyst to destroy ozone molecules. 
A single chlorine atom released in the stratosphere can continue 
to destroy ozone molecules until it is removed by some atmo-
spheric process. Therefore, a small amount of chlorine released 
in the stratosphere can deplete the ozone layer substantially. 

 World  concern  over  the  dangers  associated  with  ozone 
depletion  prompted  the  1987  Montreal  Protocol  on  Sub-
stances  that  Deplete  the  Ozone  Layer,  which  has  been 
signed by 180 countries. The goal of the Montreal Protocol 
is  to  reduce  and  eventually  eliminate  emissions  of  human- 
generated  substances  that  deplete  ozone  and  may  represent 
a model for international cooperation on a complex environ-
mental problem. As a result of the protocol, global production 
of CFCs has been reduced from over 1 million tons annually 
to less than 50,000 tons in 2003. 

 Figure 23.24    The ozone hole in September 2003. Even as 
 scientists verified that the rate of ozone depletion was declining, the 
second-largest ozone hole ever discovered developed over Antarctica. 

 How has the ozone hole over the Antarctic changed since 
its discovery in 1985? It grew reaching its maximum area, so 
far, in 2000, when it covered nearly 29.9 million km 2 (NASA 
2011) . In 2002, the Antarctic ozone hole closed quickly, sug-
gesting  that  the  ozone  layer  was  recovering.  However,  the 
third largest ozone hole was recorded in 2003, when it reached 
28.4  million km 2  ( fig. 23.24 ). Encouragingly, the year 2003 also 
saw the first reported evidence that the ozone layer is recover-
ing, when several scientists reported (Newchurch et al. 2003) 
evidence for a slowdown in stratospheric ozone loss from 1997 
to 2003. By 2012, the maximum extent of the Antarctic ozone 
hole had decreased to 21.1 million km2 and was showing clear 
signs of stabilizing (fig. 23.25). It appears that cooperation by 
the international community in the banning of CFCs has begun 
to reverse the process of ozone depletion. Atmospheric scien-
tists predict that recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer will 
likely take at least another half century (Kramarova et al. 2014; 
Kuttippurath et al. 2013). However, the news of ozone recov-
ery says clearly that we not only have the capacity to seriously 
damage the biosphere, but where we have the will, we can also 
act to restore it.    

The maximum size of the
ozone hole over the Antarctic
appears to have stabilized.

Impacts of Global Climate Change

LEARNING OUTCOMES
After studying this section you should be able to do the following:

 23.20  Summarize evidence that the earth has warmed over 

the past century.

 23.21  Outline the threats of global climate change to 

biodiversity.

 23.22  Describe how predicted climate change would 
impact human populations and infrastructure.

How will human-caused changes in atmospheric composition 
and associated climate change affect earth’s ecosystems and 
human populations? In 1957 Roger Revelle and Hans Suess 
wrote:  “Human  beings  are  now  carrying  out  a  large-scale 
geophysical  experiment  of  a  kind  that  could  not  have  hap-
pened in the past nor be reproduced in the future. Within a few 
centuries we are returning to the atmosphere and oceans the 
concentrated organic carbon stored in sedimentary rocks over 
hundreds of millions of years. This experiment, if adequately 
studied and documented, may yield a far-reaching insight into 
the processes determining weather and climate.”

Half  a  century  after  Revelle  and  Suess  made  their  pro-
phetic statement, the results of the unprecedented experiment 
are being recorded around the planet. During the past century, 
the average global temperature has risen approximately 0.8°C. 
There is broad agreement among earth scientists that increased 
atmospheric  concentration  of  greenhouse  gases,  especially 
CO2, is a major contributor to global warming. This consen-
sus follows from an understanding of the basic physics of the 
greenhouse effect (see pp. 507–508). Climate models predict 
that without reductions in emissions of CO2 and other green-
house  gases,  global  temperatures  will  increase  an  additional 
2.6° to 4.8°C over the next century (U.S. National Academy 
of Sciences and The Royal Society 2014). Evidence that the 
earth system continues to warm includes temperature records 
from long-term ground and satellite measurements, melting of 
glaciers and arctic sea ice, reductions in Northern Hemisphere 
spring snow cover, increasing ocean heat content, and continu-
ing sea level rise. Based on observations of responses to exist-
ing  warming  and  modeling  studies,  scientists  predict  a  wide 
range of environmental and economic consequences of rapid 
global warming (National Research Council 2013). 

Shifts in Biodiversity and Widespread 
Extinction of Species
Earth’s  biota  is  responding  to  climate  change.  We  reviewed 
how plant and animal species are shifting their distributions in 
chapter 10 (see p. 237) and how the phenologies of species are 
changing in chapter 12 (see p. 278). Chapter 1 also included ref-
erences to evidence of evolutionary adaptation of species to past 
and present climate change (see p. 2). Since earth’s  temperature 

Chapter 23 

  Global Ecology

525

has  varied  substantially  during  its  history  (see  fig.  23.20, 
p.  522),  why  are  scientists  concerned  about  how  continued 
warming may threaten biodiversity? Major reasons for the con-
cern are the magnitude and speed of contemporary warming. 
The earth has warmed 4° to 5°C since the last ice age; how-
ever, that warming took place over approximately 7,000 years. 
Current  climate  models  are  predicting  a  similar  magnitude 
of warming by the end of this century, a rate of warming over 
10 times faster. This pace of change and estimates of contem-
porary rates of species extinction have led scientists to suggest 
we are in the middle of a mass extinction comparable to past 
mass extinctions, such as the one that included the demise of the 
dinosaurs (Robertson et al. 2004; Barnosky et al. 2011).

Climate change is in the process of altering the dynamics 
of entire ecosystems. Climate models indicate that regions now 
supporting  tropical  rain  forest  will  be  subject  to  drying  with 
projected  climate  change  sufficient  to  threaten  the  existence 
of  these  especially  diverse  ecosystems.  Global  warming  has 
already contributed to forest dieback in temperate zones around 
the world as a result of increased incidence of disease and insect 
attack  (Anderegg,  Kane,  and  Anderegg  2013).  For  instance, 
mass mortality across vast areas of conifer forest in the Rocky 
Mountains has occurred in the past decade (fig. 23.26). Forest 
dieback  accompanied  by  increased  temperatures  and  drought 
has produced a greater frequency and extent of wildfires around 
the world. These wildfires not only disrupt forest ecosystems, 
but  also  cause  extensive  damage  to  human  infrastructure,  as 
seen in the western United States (fig. 23.27). 

Threats  to  biodiversity  are  not  limited  to  the  terrestrial 
environment. Global warming and ocean acidification threaten 
marine  biodiversity,  including  coral  reef  ecosystems.  Ocean 
warming challenges coral reefs, because, as we saw in chapter 3 
(see p. 55), reef-building corals have narrow temperature toler-
ances. In addition, the increasing atmospheric concentration of 
CO2 pushes more of the gas into solution in the oceans where 
it  is  lowering  the  pH  of  seawater.  This  ocean  acidification, 
which inhibits formation of shells and coral skeletons, poses a 
grave threat to coral reefs, the pinnacle of marine diversity and 
productivity. Acidification coupled with elevated temperatures 

Figure 23.26   Drought combined with warmer winters resulted in 
a beetle infestation that caused massive conifer mortality in the moun-
tains of northern Colorado.

may lead to the disappearance of coral reefs by the end of the 
century (Pandolfi et al. 2011). The loss of coral reefs, which 
are habitat for many commercially important fish populations, 
will have a major negative impact on the food supplies of hun-
dreds of millions of people. This is only one of many negative 
impacts of climate change on human populations.

Human Impacts of Climate Change
The  list  of  how  climate  change  can  potentially  affect  human 
populations is very long. However, discussion of just a few of 
those effects shows their potential significance. One prediction 
of climate models is that a warmer atmosphere, holding more 
water vapor, will be a source of increased frequency of intense 
precipitation  events.  The  consequences  of  such  events  can  be 
catastrophic to infrastructure, including bridges, roadways, and 
drainage systems, and to human safety. For instance, in 1999, 
two storms that dropped over 110 cm of rain in Vargas State, 
Venezuela, produced thousands of landslides in the mountainous 
terrain, flooding, and debris flows. Some of the boulders carried 
by the Venezuelan flooding were more than 10 m in diameter.  
The massive debris flows triggered by the storm buried entire 
coastal  towns,  causing  approximately  $2  billion  in  property 
damage  (fig.  23.28).  In  addition,  the  storm  and  its  aftermath 
killed an estimated 19,000 people. Intense rainfall and flooding 
can  also  increase  exposure  of  people  to  water-borne  diseases 
such as cholera and polio, especially in developing countries. 

A  warmer  earth  is  also  expected  to  experience  an 
increased frequency of severe drought, especially in semiarid 
regions. More frequent heat waves are also likely. Heat waves 
combined with drought are predicted to increase the frequency 
of crop failures and to disrupt food supplies. In addition, heat 
waves are a source of direct physiological stress and mortality 
in human populations. For instance, a heat wave in the sum-
mer of 2003 contributed to the deaths of over 70,000 people in 
Europe (Robine et al. 2008). 

Shifting of the distribution of earth’s tropical biota north-
ward  and  to  higher  elevations  carries  potential  health  con-
sequences.  Environmental  scientists  have  been  particularly 
concerned  with  the  potential  spread  of  insect-transmitted 
tropical diseases such as malaria and dengue fever to cooler 

climates. Recent events appear to justify those concerns. For 
example, locally acquired cases of dengue fever were recorded 
in Texas in 2004–2005 and in southern Florida in 2009–2013 
(Eisen and Moore 2013; USGS 2013). Meanwhile, malaria-
transmitting  mosquitoes  are  shifting  their  distributions  to 
higher elevations in the mountains of Africa.

Sea level rise will impact coastal populations. Melting of 
glaciers and polar ice is already producing sea level rise that 
will eventually flood critical coastal areas, if not stopped. Such 
flooding  would  create  a  human  and  economic  disaster.  As 
we saw in chapter 11, human populations are concentrated in 
coastal regions (see fig. 11.23, p. 254). Much of economic activ-
ity and critical infrastructure is also concentrated along coasts. 
For example, in 2011 coastal regions in the United States alone 
contributed approximately $6.6 trillion to the national economy 
(National Research Council 2013). Unfortunately, much of the 
infrastructure that this economic activity requires is vulnerable 
to coastal flooding. Similar concentrations of economic activity 
and infrastructure occur in Asia and Europe. The direct human 
impact is also potentially serious. Extensive flooding of low-
lying countries, such as Bangladesh, has the potential to create 
hundreds of millions of climate refugees.

It would be easy to give up in the face of what predicted 
climate  change  threatens.  However,  there  is  much  that  can 
be  done  to  mitigate  its  effects  and  stave  off  the  worst-case 
scenarios.  Ironically,  when  the  time  for  action  has  arrived, 
many voices from stakeholders in the status quo counsel us 
to  proceed  slowly.  Encouragingly,  the  potential  damage  of 
climate change is rallying individuals and governments every-
where to work toward reducing climate-related threats to the 
 biosphere—ultimately,  our  only  life  support  system.  In  our 
quest to reduce and hopefully reverse human damage to the 
earth, ecological knowledge will play a key role. As a student 
of ecology, you have built a foundation for being an informed 
participant in the discussion of how to address one of the most 
daunting challenges of our age.

 single-story homes in its path killing an estimated 19,000 people. 

 

   Summary 

Chapter 23 

  Global Ecology 

527

 This chapter focuses on global-scale processes and phenom-
ena, including large-scale weather systems and global change 
induced  by  humans.  We  are  the  only  species  that  exerts 
global-scale influences on the environment. 

 The  earth  is  wrapped  in  an  atmospheric  envelope  that 
makes the biosphere a hospitable place for life as we know 
it. The earth’s atmosphere reduces the amount of ultraviolet 
light reaching the surface. The atmosphere also helps to keep 
the surface of the earth warm through the  greenhouse effect.  
The surface of the earth is kept warmer than it would be by 
the greenhouse gases, including water vapor, methane, ozone, 
nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and carbon dioxide. 

  The El Niño Southern Oscillation, a large-scale atmo-
spheric  and  oceanic  phenomenon,  influences  ecological 
systems  on  a  global  scale.   The  El  Niño  Southern  Oscil-
lation is a highly dynamic, large-scale weather system that 
involves variation in sea surface temperature and barometric 
pressure  across  the  Pacific  and  Indian  Oceans.  During  the 
mature  phase  of  an  El  Niño,  the  sea  surface  in  the  eastern 
tropical Pacific Ocean is much warmer than average and the 
barometric  pressure  over  the  eastern  Pacific  is  lower  than 
average. El Niño brings increased precipitation to much of 
North and parts of South America and drought to the western 
Pacific. Periods of lower sea surface temperature and higher 
than  average  barometric  pressures  in  the  eastern  tropical 
Pacific have been named La Niñas. La Niña brings drought 
to much of North and South America and higher than aver-
age  precipitation  to  the  western  Pacific.  The  variation  in 
weather caused by the El Niño Southern Oscillation has dra-
matic  effects  on  marine  and  terrestrial  populations  around 
the world. 

  Human activity has greatly increased the quantity of 
fixed  nitrogen  cycling  through  the  biosphere.   For  mil-
lions of years, the only organisms that could fix nitrogen were 
nitrogen-fixing  bacteria  and  some  actinomycete  fungi.  The 
total amount of nitrogen fixed by these historical sources is 
approximately 130 Tg N per year. The nitrogen now fixed as 
a consequence of human activity is about 135 to 145 Tg N per 
year, more than all nonhuman sources of fixed nitrogen com-
bined. Large-scale nitrogen enrichment may threaten biologi-
cal diversity by creating environmental conditions favorable 
to some species at the expense of others. 

  Rapid changes in global patterns of land use threaten 
biological  diversity.   Human  activities,  mainly  agriculture 
and urbanization, have significantly altered one-third to one-
half of the ice-free land surface of the earth. A widely cited 
example of land cover change is tropical deforestation. From 
1978 to 1988, the rate of deforestation in the Amazon Basin of 
Brazil averaged about 15,000 km 2  per year. By 1988, the total 
area deforested within the Amazon Basin was 230,000 km 2 . 
By  adding  in  edge  effects  and  the  effects  of  isolation,  the 
area of Amazonian forest affected by deforestation increases 
from 230,000 km 2  to 588,000 km 2 . The global rate of tropical 
deforestation from 1978 to 1988 was about 30,000 km 2  per 
year. Massive deforestation has also occurred outside of the 
tropics. Because of the negative effect of reduced habitat area 
on diversity, these massive land conversions present a major 
threat to global biological diversity. 

  Human  activity  is  changing  the  composition  of  the 
atmosphere.   Analyses  of  air  trapped  in  ice  show  that  the 
concentration  of  CO 2   in  the  atmosphere  has  varied  widely 
during  the  last  160,000  years  and  closely  parallels  varia-
tion  in  global  temperatures.  High  levels  of  atmospheric 
CO 2   have  corresponded  to  higher  global  temperatures.  The 
buildup  of  atmospheric  CO 2   during  the  past  two  centuries 
has reached levels of atmospheric CO 2  not equaled in the past 
160,000  years.  The  present  level  of  CO 2   in  the  atmosphere 
is strongly influenced by burning of fossil fuels. Increases in 
atmospheric CO 2  concentration are associated with increased 
global temperatures and a variety of environmental impacts. 
Encouragingly,  the  response  of  the  global  community  to 
ozone depletion by CFCs and evidence of recent ozone recov-
ery suggest that we have the potential to address and remedy 
global-scale environmental problems. 

 Based  on  observations  of  responses  to  existing  warm-
ing  and  modeling  studies,  scientists  predict  a  wide  range 
of  environmental  and  human  consequences  as  a  result  of 
rapid global warming. The pace of climate change and esti-
mates of contemporary rates of species extinction have led 
a number of scientists to suggest that we are in the middle 
of  a  mass  extinction  comparable  to  past  mass  extinctions. 
Environmental  scientists  predict  serious  impacts  of  cli-
mate change on human populations, economic systems, and 
infrastructure.

Section VI 

  Large-Scale Ecology

  Review Questions 

     1.  Ecologists  are  now  challenged  to  study  global  ecology.  The 
apparent  role  played  by  humans  in  changing  the  global  envi-
ronment makes it imperative that we understand the workings 
of  the  earth  as  a  global  system.  However,  this  study  requires 
approaches that are significantly different from those that can 
be applied to traditional areas of ecological study. Historically, 
much of ecology focused on small areas and short-term studies. 
What  are  some  of  the  main  differences  between  global  ecol-
ogy  and,  for  instance,  the  study  of  interspecific  competition 
(see chapter 13) or forest succession (see chapter 20)? How will 
these differences affect the design of studies at the global scale?  
    2.  Geologists,  atmospheric  scientists,  and  oceanographers  have 
been conducting global-scale studies for some time. What role 
will  information  from  these  disciplines  play  in  the  study  of 
global ecology? Why will global ecological studies generally be 
pursued by interdisciplinary teams? How can ecologists play a 
useful role in global studies?  

    3.  What  changes  in  sea  surface  temperatures  and  atmospheric 
pressures  over  the  Pacific  Ocean  accompany  El  Niño?  What 
physical changes accompany La Niña? How do El Niño and La 
Niña affect precipitation in North America, South America, and 
Australia?  

    4.  Review evidence that the El Niño Southern Oscillation signifi-
cantly  influences  populations  around  the  globe.  Much  of  our 
discussion in chapter 23 focused on the effects of the El Niño 
Southern  Oscillation  on  populations.  Considering  our  discus-
sions in chapters 18 and 19 of physical controls on rates of ter-
restrial  primary  production  and  decomposition,  how  does  the 
El Niño Southern Oscillation likely affect these ecosystem pro-
cesses in Australia or the American Southwest? How would you 
test your ideas?  

    5.  In chapter 23, we briefly discussed how humans have more than 
doubled the quantity of fixed nitrogen cycling through the bio-
sphere. In chapter 15, we reviewed studies by Nancy Johnson 
(1993) on the effects of fertilization on the mutualistic relation-
ship between mycorrhizal fungi and grasses. The increases in 
fixed nitrogen cycling through the biosphere, particularly that 
portion deposited by rain, are analogous to a global-scale fer-
tilization experiment. Reasoning from the results of Johnson’s 

study, how should increased fixed nitrogen supplies affect the 
relationship  between  mycorrhizal  fungi  and  their  plant  part-
ners? How would you test your ideas?  

    6.  As we saw in chapters 18 and 19, nitrogen availability seems to 
control  the  rates  of  several  ecosystem  processes.  How  should 
nitrogen  enrichment  affect  rates  of  primary  production  and 
decomposition  in  terrestrial,  freshwater,  and  marine  environ-
ments? How could you test your ideas? What role might geo-
graphic comparisons play in your studies?  

    7.  Ecologists predict that global diversity is threatened by land use 
change and by the reductions in habitat area and the fragmen-
tation  that  accompany  land  use  change. Vitousek  (1994)  sug-
gested that land use change may be the greatest current threat 
to biological diversity (see  fig. 23.3 ). What role do studies of 
diversity on islands and species area relationships on continents 
(see chapter 22) play in these predictions?  

    8.  Skole  and  Tucker  (1993)  documented  the  rate  and  extent  of 
recent  deforestation  in  the Amazon  Basin  in  Brazil. This  is  a 
prominent example of the land cover changes that likely threaten 
biological diversity. However, scientists have documented agri-
cultural activity in New World tropical forests beginning at least 
6,000 years ago. What makes present-day deforestation in the 
Amazon Basin different from this historical activity? What does 
the  long  history  of  agriculture  in  the  Amazon  Basin  suggest 
about the potential for coexistence of agriculture and biological 
diversity there?  

    9.  Review the long-term atmospheric CO 2  record as revealed by 
studies  of  air  trapped  in  ice  cores.  What  is  the  evidence  that 
burning  of  fossil  fuels  is  responsible  for  recent  increases  in 
atmospheric CO 2  concentrations?  

   10.  What evidence is there that variation in atmospheric CO 2  con-
centration  is  linked  to  variation  in  global  temperatures?  In 
recent years, the governments of most countries of the world 
have been working hard to develop international agreements 
to regulate CO 2  emissions. Why are these governments con-
cerned? How might rapid changes in global temperatures lead 
to  the  extinction  of  large  numbers  of  species?  How  might 
changes  in  global  temperatures  affect  agriculture  around 
the world?

The above values were computed as described by Zar (1996: App 16). More extensive tables of chi-square are found in Rohlf and Sokal (1995:24–25) and Zar (1996:App 13–16). 
Values of chi-square for degrees of freedom (n) greater than 40 may be approximated very accurately (Zar, 1984:482), as follows:

 Glossary 

  A 
   abundance     the total number of individuals, or biomass, of a species 

present in a specified area.  (p. 200)   

   abyssal  zone     a  zone  of  the  ocean  depths  between  4,000  and 

6,000 m.  (p. 49)   

   acclimation     physiological  adjustment  to  change  in  a  particular 

environmental factor, such as temperature or salinity.  (p. 107)   

   actual evapotranspiration (AET)     the amount of water lost from an 
ecosystem to the atmosphere due to a combination of evaporation 
and transpiration by plants.  (p. 394)   

   adaptation     an evolutionary process that changes anatomy, physiol-
ogy, or behavior, resulting in an increased ability of a population 
to live in a particular environment. The term is also applied to the 
anatomical, physiological, or behavioral characteristics produced 
by this process.  (p. 7, 78)   

   adhesion-adapted     a  term  applied  to  seeds  with  hooks,  spines,  or 

barbs that disperse by attaching to passing animals.  (p. 263)   

   aeroecology     the  interdisciplinary  study  of  ecology  of  the  earth’s 
atmospheric boundary layer and the myriad airborne organisms that 
depend on this environment for their existence. Relevant disciplines 
include atmospheric science, animal behavior, ecology, evolution, 
earth science, computational biology, and engineering.  (p. 3)   

   age distribution     the distribution of individuals among age groups 

in a population; often called age structure.  (p. 227)   

   agriculture     the  growing  of  crops  and  livestock  for  human  con-

sumption.  (p. 96)   

   A horizon     a biologically active soil layer consisting of a mixture of 
mineral materials, such as clay, silt, and sand, as well as organic 
material, derived from the overlying O horizon; generally charac-
terized by leaching.  (p. 18)   

   allele     one of the alternative forms of the same gene.  (p. 79)   
   allele  frequencies     the  proportions  of  alternative  forms  of  a  gene 

(alleles) in a population of organisms.  (p. 84)   

   allopatric     describes the condition in which populations or species 

have nonoverlapping geographic ranges.  (p. 296)   

   allopolyploidy     a process of speciation initiated by hybridization of 

two different species.  (p. 288)   

   allozyme     alternative  form  of  a  particular  enzyme  which  differs 
structurally but not functionally from other allozymes coded for 
by different alleles at the same locus.  (p. 93)
