ABOUT THE AUTHORS

A L A N  P.  T R U J I L L O Al Trujillo is a professor in the Earth, Space, and Aviation
Sciences Department at Palomar College in San Marcos, California. He received
his bachelor s degree in geology from the University of California at Davis and
his  master s  degree  in  geology  from  Northern  Arizona  University, afterwards
working for several years in industry as a developmental geologist, hydrogeolo-
gist, and  computer  specialist. Al  began  teaching  at  Palomar  in  1990. In  1997,
he was  awarded  Palomar s  Distinguished  Faculty  Award  for  Excellence  in
Teaching and in 2005 he received Palomar s Faculty Research Award. He has
co-authored Introductory Oceanography with Hal Thurman and is a contributing
author  for  the  textbooks  Earth and  Earth  Science. In  addition  to  writing  and
teaching, Al works as a naturalist and lecturer aboard natural history expedition
vessels in Alaska and the Sea of Cortez/Baja California. His research interests
include beach processes, sea cliff erosion, and computer applications in oceanog-
raphy. As a hobby, he collects sand and is a member of the International Sand Collectors Society; he also serves as the
organization s Oceanography Division Advisor. Al and his wife, Sandy, have two children, Karl and Eva.

H A R O L D  V.   T H U RM A N Hal Thurman retired in May 1994, after 24 years of teaching
in the Earth Sciences Department at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California. In-
terest in geology led to a bachelor s degree from Oklahoma A&M University, followed
by seven years working as a petroleum geologist, mainly in the Gulf of Mexico, where his
interest  in  the  oceans  developed. He  earned  a  master s  degree  from  California  State
University at Los Angeles and then joined the Earth Sciences faculty at Mt. San Antonio
College. Other books that Hal has co-authored include Introductory Oceanography with
Alan Trujillo as well as a marine biology textbook. He has also written articles on the Pa-
cific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic Oceans for the 1994 edition of World Book Encyclope-
dia and  served  as  a  consultant  on  the  National  Geographic  publication  Realms  of  the
Sea. He still enjoys going to sea on vacations with his wife, Iantha.

PREFACE

The sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net 

of wonder forever.

Jacques-Yves Cousteau,
oceanographer, underwater videographer,
and explorer (circa 1963)

To the Student
Welcome! You re about to embark on a journey that is far from
ordinary. Over the course of this term, you will discover the cen-
tral role the oceans play in the vast global system of which you are
a part.

This book s content was carefully developed to provide a foun-
dation in science by examining the vast body of oceanic knowledge.
This  knowledge  includes  information  from  a  variety  of  scientific
disciplines geology, chemistry, physics, and biology as they relate
to the oceans. However, no formal background in any of these disci-
plines is required to successfully master the subject matter contained
within  this  book. Our  desire  is  to  have  you  take  away  from  your
oceanography  course  much  more  than  just  a  collection  of  facts.
Instead, we  want  you  to  develop  a  fundamental  understanding  of
how the oceans work or why the oceans behave the way that they do.
This book is intended to help you in your quest to know more
about  the  oceans. Taken  as  a  whole, the  components  of  the
ocean its sea floor, chemical constituents, physical components,
and life forms
comprise one of Earth s largest interacting, inter-
related, and interdependent systems. Because humans are begin-
ning  to  impact  Earth  systems, it  is  important  to  understand  not
only  how  the  oceans  operate, but  also  how  the  oceans  interact
with Earth s other systems (such as its atmosphere, biosphere, and
hydrosphere) as part of a larger picture. Thus, this book uses a sys-
tems  approach  to  highlight  the  interdisciplinary  relationships
among  oceanographic  phenomena  and  how  those  phenomena
affect other Earth systems.

To  that  end and  to help  you  make the  most of  your  study
time we focused the presentation in this book by organizing the
material around three essential components:

1. Concepts: General  ideas  derived  or  inferred  from  specific
instances or occurrences (for instance, the concept of density
can be used to explain why the oceans are layered).

2. Processes: Actions or occurrences that bring about a result (for
instance, the process of waves breaking at an angle to the shore
results in the movement of sediment along the shoreline).

3. Principles: Rules or laws concerning the functioning of natu-
ral  phenomena  or  mechanical  processes  (for  instance, the
principle of sea floor spreading suggests that the geographic
positions of the continents have changed through time).

Interwoven within these concepts, processes, and principles are
hundreds  of  photographs, illustrations, real-world  examples, and
applications  that  make  the  material  relevant  and  accessible  (and
maybe sometimes even entertaining) by bringing the science to life.
Ultimately, it  is  our  hope  that  by  understanding  how  the
oceans work, you will develop a new awareness and appreciation
of all aspects of the marine environment and its role in Earth sys-
tems. To this end, the book has been written for you, the student
of  the  oceans. So  enjoy  and  immerse  yourself! You re  in  for  an
exciting ride.

To the Instructor
The  tenth  edition  of  Essentials  of  Oceanography is  designed  to
accompany an introductory college-level course in oceanography
taught to students with no formal background in mathematics or
science. As in previous editions, the goal of this edition of the text-
book is to clearly present the relationships of scientific principles
to ocean phenomena in an engaging and meaningful way.

This  edition  has  greatly  benefited  from  being  thoroughly
reviewed by hundreds of students who made numerous suggestions
for  improvement. A  few  comments  by  former  students  about  the
book include, I  really enjoyed the textbook we read as part of the
class.As a student, I found it not only easier to read but also a lot more
informative than other textbooks. The authors of the book seemed to
have a lot more human qualities about them than the authors of other
textbooks I ve read. This makes reading Essentials of Oceanography
entertaining at times. and  What I really liked about the book is that
it s a welcoming textbook open and airy.You could almost read it at
bedtime like a story because of all the interesting pictures.

This edition has been reviewed in detail by a host of instruc-
tors from leading institutions across the country. As one reviewer
of the ninth edition remarked, The textbook does an outstanding
job  of  distilling  down  complicated  topics  in  astronomy, geology,
chemistry, and physics, all of which are incorporated in the field of
oceanography, that are easily understandable by students taking an
introductory course in the subject. Even for those who do not have
a  strong  science  background, the  plentiful  figures  present  each
topic very clearly.

The 16-chapter format of this textbook is designed for easy cov-
erage  of  the  material  in  a  15-  or  16-week  semester. For  courses
taught on a 10-week quarter system, instructors may need to select
those chapters that cover the topics and concepts of primary rele-
vance to their course. Chapters are self-contained and can thus be
covered in any order. Following the introductory chapter (Chapter 1,
which  covers  the  general  geography  of  the  oceans; a  historical
perspective  of  oceanography; the  reasoning  behind  the  scientific

Preface

method; and a discussion of the origin of Earth, the atmosphere, the
oceans, and  life  itself), the  four  major  academic  disciplines  of
oceanography are represented in the following chapters:

Greater emphasis on the ocean s role in Earth systems

Feature boxes
following four themes:

several of them new reorganized around the

Geological oceanography (Chapters 2, 3, 4, and parts of Chap-
ters 10 and 11)

Chemical oceanography (Chapter 5 and part of Chapter 11)

* HISTORICAL FEATURES: These boxes focus on historical
developments  in  oceanography  that  tie  into  chapter
topics.

Physical oceanography (Chapters 6-9 and parts of Chapters 10
and 11)

* RESEARCH  METHODS  IN  OCEANOGRAPHY: These
boxes highlight how oceanographic knowledge is obtained.

Biological oceanography (Chapters 12 15)

One  of  the  most  significant  additions  to  the  book  is  a  new

interdisciplinary  chapter  The  Oceans  and  Climate  Change
(Chapter  16), which  focuses  on  the  important  environmental
issue  of  human-caused  global  climate  change  and  its  impact  on
the ocean.

We strongly believe that oceanography is at its best when it
links  together  several  scientific  disciplines  and  shows  how  they
are  interrelated  in  the  oceans. Therefore, this  interdisciplinary
approach is a key element of every chapter.

What s New in This Edition?
Changes in this edition are designed to increase the readability,
relevance, and  appeal  of  this  book. Major  changes  include  the
following:

The  new  chapter  The  Oceans  and  Climate  Change (Chap-
ter 16), which includes content that was previously included in
Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 10; in addition, it presents some of the lat-
est scientific findings about human-caused climate change and
its impact on the ocean

Incorporation  of  comments  from  hundreds  of  students  who
thoroughly reviewed and edited the previous edition in small
focus group discussions and one-on-one meetings with author
Al Trujillo

A new feature called  Chapter at a Glance at the beginning of
each chapter that focuses attention on the most important con-
cepts covered within each chapter

The geoscience animations library, which is a suite of 45 state-
of-the-art  computer  animations  that  have  been  created  by
Al Trujillo and a panel of geoscience educators to help students
visualize some of the most challenging oceanographic concepts

Addition  of  seven  new  oceanographic  animations  that  have
been specifically designed for this edition

Inclusion of new Web Videos, which are an extensive suite of
hand-selected  short  video  clips  available  online  that  show
oceanographic processes in action

Addition of Encounter Earth activities that illustrate interest-
ing oceanographic features with interactive online maps

Updating of information throughout the text to include some
of  the  most  recent  developments  in  oceanography, such  as
recent satellite missions and deep-ocean observations

* OCEANS AND PEOPLE: These boxes illustrate the inter-

action of humans and the ocean environment.

* FOCUS ON THE ENVIRONMENT: These boxes emphasize
environmental issues, which are an increasingly important
component of the book.

Addition of several new tables that better organize and sum-
marize important data

New Web boxes and Web tables on the Online Study Guide
that contain some of the existing boxes and summary tables
from the previous edition to reduce the length of the book

Addition of an extensive array of updated photos and illustra-
tions to improve the illustration package and make the figures
more consistent throughout

Standardization of all graphs throughout the text to make the
data easier to read and understand

Thoroughly  reviewed  and  edited  text  in  all  chapters, in  a
continued effort to refine the style and clarity of the writing

A detailed list of specific chapter-by-chapter changes is avail-
able at http://daphne.palomar.edu/atrujillo.

In addition, this edition continues to offer some of the previ-

ous edition s most popular features, including the following:

Extensive rigor and depth of material

Students Sometimes Ask . . . questions, which contain actual

student questions along with the authors  answers

Use  of  the  international  metric  system  (Système  Interna-
tional  [SI]  units), with  comparable  English  system  units  in
parentheses

Explanation of word etymons (etumon =  sense of a word) as
new  terms  are  introduced, in  an  effort  to  demystify  scientific
terms by showing what the terms actually mean

Use of bold print on key terms, which are defined when they
are introduced and are included in the glossary

Key Concept statements that denote important concepts as

they are discussed in each chapter

A  Chapter in Review summary at the end of each chapter

line quizzes including critical thinking exercises, animations,
Web videos, and relevant Internet links

The New Instructional Package
For the Student

The student-friendly Premium Online Study Guide with eText
(http://www.mygeoscienceplace.com), which is designed to func-
tion  as  a  study  tool, a  one-stop  source  for  additional  oceano-
graphic resources including visualizations, and a launching pad
for further exploration. Content for the site was written by au-
thor Al Trujillo and is tied, chapter-by-chapter, to the text.

* To  help  students  understand  difficult  concepts: The  site
contains student animations
a suite of 45 animations that
aid  in  visualizing  complex  oceanographic  concepts  and
processes. These animations have been specifically crafted
by a team of geoscience educators to aid student learning
by  allowing  the  user  to  control  the  action. For  example,
students can fully examine how an animation develops by
replaying it, controlling its pace, and stopping and starting
the animation anywhere in its sequence. In order to facili-
tate effective study, Al Trujillo  has  written accompanying
narrations for each animation.

* To  aid  in  reviewing  the  text  material: The  site  contains
several self-testing modules, including multiple choice and
true/false, multiple  answer, and  image-labeling  exercises.
Answers, once  submitted, are  automatically  graded  for
instant feedback.

* To encourage and enable further exploration: Every chapter
contains both general and chapter-specific annotated links to
some of the best oceanography sites on the World Wide Web.
Students can also subscribe to RSS feeds to stay up-to-date on
oceanographic  discoveries. Web  videos contain  some  of  the
best short video clips of oceanographic processes in action.

Acknowledgments
We are indebted to many individuals for their helpful comments
and suggestions during the revision of this book. Al Trujillo is in-
debted to his colleagues at Palomar Community College for their
keen interest in the project, for allowing him to use some of their
creative ideas in the book, and for continuing to provide valuable
feedback. They are simply the finest colleagues imaginable. A par-
ticularly big thank you goes to Patty Deen for her continuing sup-
port and for recognizing the contribution the book makes to the
Oceanography Program at Palomar.

Adam Petrusek of Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic,
deserves special recognition for his many suggestions for improving
the  text. Adam  translated  a  previous  edition  of  the  textbook  into
Czech, and in the process, he thoroughly reviewed every part of it.

Many  people  were  instrumental  in  helping  the  text  evolve
from its manuscript stage. My chief liaison at Pearson Education,
Geoscience Editor-in-Chief Nicole Folchetti, expertly guided the
project and helped overcome several hurdles in order to get the
book  published. Copy  Editor  Kitty  Wilson  did  a  superb  job  of
editing the manuscript, in many cases catching obscure errors that
had  persisted  throughout  several  previous  editions. Assistant
Editor Sean Hale kept the book on track by making sure dead-
lines were met along the way. Media Producers Angela Bernhardt
and Lee Ann Doctor  provided key  initiative  and support in  the
creation of the electronic supplements that accompany this book,
including the newly revised Online Study Guide and all of its out-
standing  features. Some  of  these  new  features  include  the Web
videos, which were researched by Mike Lubby, and the Encounter
Earth links, which were coordinated by Crissy Dudonis. New pho-
tos were found by Photo Researcher Roman Barnes, and the entire
photo program was overseen by Science Photo Programs Manager
Travis  Amos. The  Australian  animations  studio  Cadre  demon-
strated  rare  patience  and  creativity  while  updating  existing  ani-
mations  and  creating  new  ones. The  Pearson  art  studios  did  a
beautiful  job of  modernizing many  of  the figures  to  make them
more consistent throughout. The artful design of the text, includ-
ing  text  wrapping  and  image  placement, was  developed  by Art
Director Mark Ong and Prentice Hall s design department. Last

Preface

but not least, Production Editor Karpagam Jagadeesan deserves
special recognition for her encouragement all the way from India
during  the  many  long  hours  of  turning  the  manuscript  into  the
book you see today.

Al Trujillo would also like to thank his students, whose ques-

tions provided the material for the  Students Sometimes Ask . . .
sections  and  whose  continued  input  has  proved  invaluable  for
improving the text. Because scientists (and all good teachers) are
always experimenting, thanks also for allowing yourselves to be a
captive audience with which to conduct my experiments.

Al Trujillo also thanks his patient and understanding family
for putting up with his absence during the long hours of preparing
The  Book. Finally, appreciation  is  extended  to  the  chocolate
manufacturers Hershey, See s, and Ghirardelli for providing inspi-
ration. A heartfelt thanks to all of you!

Oceanography is not so much a science as a collection of scientists who

find common cause in trying to understand the complex nature of the ocean.
In the vast salty seas that encompass the earth, there is plenty of room for
persons trained in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering to practice
their specialties. Thus, an oceanographer is any scientifically trained person
who spends much of his [or her] career on ocean problems.

Willard Bascom, Oceanographer and Explorer (1980)

INTRODUCTION

Welcome to a book about the oceans. As you read this book, we hope that it elicits a sense of wonder
and a spirit of curiosity about our watery planet. The ocean represents many different things to dif-
ferent people. To some, it is a wilderness of beauty and tranquility, a refuge from hectic civilized lives.
Others see it as a vast recreational area that inspires either rest or physical challenge. To others, it
is  a  mysterious  place  that  is  full  of  unknown  wonders. And  to  others, it  is  a  place  of  employment
unmatched by any on land. To be sure, its splendor has inspired artists, writers, and poets for cen-
turies. Whatever your view, we hope that understanding the way the oceans work will increase your
appreciation of the marine environment. Above all, take time to admire the oceans.

Essentials  of  Oceanography was  first  written  to  help  students  develop  an  awareness  about  the
that  is, develop  an  appreciation  for  the  oceans  by  learning  about  oceanic
marine  environment
processes (how the oceans behave) and their interrelationships (how physical entities are related to
one another in the oceans). In this tenth edition, our goal is the same: to give the reader the scientific
background to understand the basic principles underlying oceanic phenomena. In this way, one can
then make informed decisions about the oceans in the years to come. We hope that some of you will
be inspired so much by the oceans that you will continue to study them formally or informally in the
future. (For  those  who  may  be  considering  a  life-long  career  in  oceanography, see  Appendix  V,

Careers in Oceanography, for some tips and practical advice.)

I.1 What Is Oceanography?
Oceanography (ocean =  the  marine  environment, graphy =  the  name  of  a  descriptive  science)  is
literally the description of the marine environment. Although the term was first coined in the 1870s
at the beginning of scientific exploration of the oceans, this definition does not fully portray the extent
of  what  oceanography  encompasses: Oceanography  is  much  more  than  just  describing marine
phenomena. Oceanography  could  be  more  accurately  called  the  scientific  study  of  all  aspects  of
the marine environment. Hence, the field of study called oceanography could (and maybe should) be
called oceanology (ocean = the marine environment, ology = the study of). However, the science of
studying the oceans has traditionally been called oceanography. It is also called marine science and
includes the study of the water of the ocean, the life within it, and the (not so) solid Earth beneath it.
Since prehistoric time, people have used the oceans as a means of transportation and as a source
of  food. However, the  importance  of  ocean  processes  has  been  studied  technically  only  since  the
1930s. The impetus for these studies began with the search for offshore petroleum and expanded with
the emphasis on ocean warfare during World War II. In fact, it was during World War II that the great
expansion  in  oceanography, which  continues  today, began. The  realization  by  governments  of  the

research, the growth in the number of ocean scientists at work, and the increasing
sophistication of scientific equipment have made it feasible to study the ocean on
a scale and to a degree of complexity never before attempted nor even possible.
Historically, those who make their living fishing in the ocean go where the physi-
cal  processes  of  the  oceans  offer  good  fishing. But  how  marine  life  interrelates
with  ocean  geology, chemistry, and  physics  to  create  good  fishing  grounds  has
been more or less a mystery until only recently when scientists in these disciplines
began to investigate the oceans with new technology. Along with these expanded
studies came the realization of how much of an impact humans are beginning to
have  on  the  ocean. As  a  result, much  recent  research  has  been  concerned  with
documenting human impacts on the ocean.

Oceanography is typically divided into different academic disciplines (or sub-
fields) of study. The four main disciplines of oceanography that are covered in this
book are as follows:

Geological oceanography, which is the study of the structure of
the  sea  floor  and  how  the  sea  floor  has  changed  through
time; the creation of sea floor features; and the history of
sediments deposited on it.

GEOLOGY

sea floor tectonics
coastal processes
sediments
hydrologic cycle

Chemical  oceanography, which  is  the  study  of  the
chemical composition and properties of seawater; how
to  extract  certain  chemicals  from  seawater; and  the
effects of pollutants.

Physical  oceanography, which  is  the  study  of  waves,
tides, and  currents; the  ocean atmosphere  relationship
that influences weather and climate; and the transmission of
light and sound in the oceans.

Biological  oceanography, which  is  the  study  of  the vari-
ous  oceanic  life  forms  and  their  relationships  to  one
another; adaptations  to  the  marine  environment; and
developing sustainable methods of harvesting seafood.

Other  disciplines  include  ocean  engineering, marine

oceanography often examines in detail all the different dis-
ciplines of oceanography, it is frequently described as being an
interdisciplinary science, or one covering all the disciplines of sci-
ence as they apply to the oceans (Figure I.1). The content of this book includes the
broad  range  of  interdisciplinary  science  topics  that  comprises  the  field  of
oceanography. In essence, this is a book about all aspects of the oceans.

I.2 How Are Earth s Oceans Unique?
The oceans are the largest and most prominent feature on Earth. In fact, they are
the single most defining feature of our planet. As viewed from space, our planet is a
beautiful blue, white, and brown globe (see the chapter-opening photo in Chapter 1).
It is our oceans of liquid water that set us apart in the solar system. No other body
in  the  solar  system  has  a  confirmed  ocean; however, recent  satellite  missions
have revealed a spidery network of fluid-filled cracks on Jupiter s moon Europa
(Figure  I.2), which  almost  certainly  betrays  the  presence  of  an  ocean  of  liquid
water beneath its icy surface. Another of Jupiter s moons, Callisto, may also have 
a liquid ocean beneath its cold, icy crust. Yet another tantalizing possibility for a
nearby  world  with  an  ocean  beneath  its  icy  surface  is  Saturn s  tiny  moon
Enceladus, which displays geysers of water vapor and ice that have recently been
analyzed  and, remarkably, contain  salt. And  evidence  continues  to  mount  that

Introduction

Saturn s giant moon Titan with its thick obscuring atmosphere may possess seas of
liquid  hydrocarbons. Currently, there  is  much  debate  in  the  United States  as  to
which of these moons is the best target to send a follow-up space mission for the
detection of life outside Earth. Still, the fact that our planet has so much water, and
in the liquid form, is unique in the solar system.

The oceans determine where our continents end and have thus shaped political
boundaries and human history.The oceans conceal many features; in fact, the majority
of Earth s geographic features are on the ocean floor. Remarkably, there was once
more known about the surface of the moon than about the floor of the oceans! Fortu-
nately, our knowledge of both has increased dramatically over the past few decades.

The oceans influence climate and weather all over the globe

even in conti-
nental  areas  far  from  any  ocean through  an  intricate  pattern  of  currents  and
heating/cooling mechanisms that scientists are only now beginning to understand.
The oceans are also the lungs of the planet, taking carbon dioxide gas 
out
of  the  atmosphere  and  replacing  it  with  oxygen  gas 
Some  scientists  have
estimated that the oceans supply as much as 70% of the oxygen humans breathe.
The oceans are essential  to all life and are in  large part responsible for  the
development of life on Earth, providing a stable environment in which life could
evolve over millions of years. Today, the oceans contain the greatest number of liv-
ing  things on the  planet, from microscopic  bacteria and  algae  to the largest  life
form alive today (the blue whale). Interestingly, water is the major component of
nearly every life form on Earth, and our own body fluid chemistry is remarkably
similar to the chemistry of seawater.

FIGURE I.2 Jupiter s moon Europa. Europa s network of
dark fluid-filled cracks suggests the presence of an ocean 
beneath its icy surface. If the presence of an ocean is con-
firmed, Europa would become the only other body in the
solar system besides Earth that has an ocean of liquid water.

The oceans hold many secrets waiting to be discovered, and new discoveries
about the oceans are made nearly every day. The oceans are a source of food, min-
erals, and energy that remains largely untapped. More than half of the world pop-
ulation lives in coastal areas near the oceans, taking advantage of the mild climate,
an inexpensive form of transportation, and vast recreational opportunities. Unfor-
tunately, the oceans are also the dumping ground for many of society s wastes. In
fact, the oceans are currently showing alarming strains caused by pollution, over-
fishing, invasive species, and climate change, among other things.

I.3 What Is Rational Use of Technology?
Many  stresses  have  been  put  on  the  oceans  by  an  ever-increasing  human
population. For instance, population studies reveal that more than 50% of world
population some 3.2 billion people live along the coastline, and more than 80%
of all Americans live within an hour s drive from an ocean or the Great Lakes. In
the future, these figures are expected to increase. In the United States, for example,
8 of the 10 largest cities are in coastal environments, and 3600 people move to the
coast every day. By 2025, as much as 75% of the global population is expected to
live at the coast. Clearly, coastal regions are desirable places to live (Figure I.3).

Human migration to the coasts will further mar fragile coastal ocean ecosys-
tems. Specifically, the surge in coastal population has resulted in increasing amounts
of industrial waste and sewage disposal at sea, large volumes of polluted runoff, and
increasing  use  of  seawater  for  human  benefit  (for  example, using  seawater  as  a
coolant  in  coastal  power  plants). Coastal  habitats  have  also  come  under  intense
pressure  as  more  development  has  occurred, resulting  in  coastal  wetlands  being
filled in even though they are vital to the cleansing of runoff waters, and their diver-
sity and high productivity support coastal fisheries. In addition, all this development
and its ecological impacts will pose immense challenges for coastal communities, in-
cluding increased demands on energy, infrastructure, and the supply of freshwater.
Although it may seem as if humans have severely and irreversibly damaged the
oceans, our impact has mostly been felt in coastal areas. The world s oceans are a
vast habitat that has not yet been lethally damaged. Humans have been able to in-
flict only minor damage here and there along the margins of the oceans. However,

as our technology makes us more powerful, the threat of irreversible harm becomes
greater. For instance, in the open ocean (those areas far from shore), deep-ocean
mining and nuclear waste disposal have been proposed. How do we as a society deal
with these increased demands on the marine environment? How do we regulate the
ocean s use? One of the first steps is to understand how the oceans work and, at the
same time, increase our understanding of how human actions affect the oceans.

If  used  wisely, our  technology  can  actually  reduce  the  threat  of  irreversible
harm. Which path will we take? We all need to carefully evaluate our own actions
and  the  effects  those  actions  have  on  the  environment. In  addition, we  need  to
make conscientious decisions about those we elect to public office. Some of you
may even have direct responsibility for initiating legislation that affects our envi-
ronment. It is our hope that you, as a student of the marine environment, will gain
enough  knowledge  while  studying  oceanography  to  help  your  community  (and
perhaps even your nation) make rational use of technology in the oceans.

Our environment, our health, our economic prospect, our

national defense, the foods we eat and the air we breathe
even our genetic future will depend upon how wisely we
apply the technologies that become available. And to do
this we need a population of scientists, but also of citizens,
of workers, of administrators, of policy makers . . . who
can grasp the scientific way of thinking.

INTRODUCTION 
TO PLANET  EARTH

It seems perplexing that our planet is called  Earth when 70.8% of its surface is covered by oceans.
Many  early  human  cultures  that  lived  near  the  Mediterranean  (medi * middle, terra * land)  Sea
envisioned  the  world  as  being  composed  of  large  landmasses  surrounded  by  marginal  bodies  of
water (Figure 1.1). How surprised they must have been when they ventured into the larger oceans of
the world. Our planet is misnamed  Earth because we live on the land portion of the planet. If we
were marine animals, our planet would probably be called  Ocean, Water, Hydro, Aqua, or even

Oceanus to indicate the prominence of Earth s oceans.

1.1 How Many Oceans Exist on Earth?
A world map (Figure 1.2) shows how extensive our oceans really are. Notice that the oceans dominate
the surface area of the globe. For those people who have traveled by boat across an ocean (or even
flown across one in an airplane), the one thing that immediately strikes them is that the oceans are
enormous. Notice, also, that the oceans are interconnected and form a single continuous body of sea-
water, which is why the oceans are commonly referred to as a  world ocean (singular, not plural).
For instance, a vessel at sea can travel from one ocean to another, whereas it is impossible to travel
on land from one continent to most others without crossing an ocean. In addition, the oceans contain
97.2% of all the water on or near Earth s surface, so the volume of the oceans is immense.

The Four Principal Oceans, Plus One
Our world ocean can be divided into four principal oceans (plus an additional ocean), based on the
shape of the ocean basins and the positions of the continents (Figure 1.2).

PACIFIC  OCEAN The  Pacific  Ocean is  the  world s  largest  ocean, covering  more  than  half  of  the
ocean surface area on Earth (Figure 1.3b). The Pacific Ocean is the single largest geographic feature
on the planet, spanning more than one-third of Earth s entire surface. The Pacific Ocean is so large
that all of the continents could fit into the space occupied by it with room left over! Although the
Pacific Ocean is also the deepest ocean in the world (Figure 1.3c), it contains many small tropical
islands. It was named in 1520 by explorer Ferdinand Magellan s party in honor of the fine weather
they encountered while crossing into the Pacific (paci * peace) Ocean.

ATLANTIC OCEAN The Atlantic Ocean is about half the size of the Pacific Ocean and is not quite
as  deep  (Figure  1.3). It  separates  the  Old World  (Europe, Asia, and Africa)  from  the  New World
(North and South America). The Atlantic Ocean was named after Atlas, who was one of the Titans in
Greek mythology.

The four principal oceans are the Pacific, Atlantic,
Indian, and Arctic Oceans. An additional ocean, the
Southern or Antarctic Ocean, is also recognized.

FIGURE 1.1 An early map of the world. The world according
to the Greek Herodotus in 450 B.C., showing the prominence of
the Mediterranean Sea surrounded by the continents of Europe,
Libya (Africa), and Asia. Seas are labeled  mare and are shown
as a band of water encircling the land.

INDIAN  OCEAN The  Indian  Ocean is  slightly  smaller  than  the Atlantic  Ocean
and has about the same average depth (Figure 1.3). It is mostly in the Southern
Hemisphere (south of the equator, or below 0 degrees latitude in Figure 1.2). The
Indian Ocean was named for its proximity to the subcontinent of India.

ARCTIC OCEAN The Arctic Ocean is about 7% the size of the Pacific Ocean and
is only a little more than one-quarter as deep as the rest of the oceans (Fig-
ure 1.3). Although it has a permanent layer of sea ice at the surface, the ice is only
a few meters thick. The Arctic Ocean was named after
its  location  in  the Arctic  region, which  exists  beneath
the  northern  constellation  Ursa  Major, otherwise
known as the Big Dipper, or the Bear (arktos * bear).

SOUTHERN OCEAN, OR ANTARCTIC OCEAN Oceanog-
raphers recognize an additional ocean near the continent
of Antarctica  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere  (Figure  1.2).
Defined by the meeting of currents near Antarctica called
the  Antarctic  Convergence, the  Southern  Ocean, or
Antarctic  Ocean, is  really  the  portions  of  the  Pacific,
Atlantic, and  Indian  Oceans  south  of  about  50  degrees
south  latitude. This  ocean  was  named  for  its  location  in
the Southern Hemisphere.

Oceans versus Seas: What Are 
the Seven Seas?
What is the difference between a sea and an ocean? In
common  use, the  terms  sea and  ocean are  often
used  interchangeably. For  instance, a  sea star  lives  in
the ocean; the ocean is full of seawater; sea ice forms in
the ocean; and one might stroll the seashore while living in ocean-front property.
Technically, however, a sea is defined as follows:

Smaller and shallower than an ocean (this is why the Arctic Ocean might be
more appropriately considered a sea)

Sailing the seven seas is a familiar phrase in liter-

Today, the world ocean is generally divided

oceans  are  counted  as  seas  and  the  Pacific  and
Atlantic Oceans are arbitrarily split at the equator, a
more modern count of the seven  seas includes: (1) the
North  Pacific, (2)  the  South  Pacific, (3)  the  North
Atlantic, (4)  the  South  Atlantic, (5)  the  Indian, (6)  the
Arctic, and (7) the Southern or Antarctic.

COMPARING  THE  OCEANS  TO  THE  CONTINENTS Figure 1.3d shows that  the
average depth of the world s oceans is 3729 meters1 (12,234 feet). This means that
there must be some extremely deep areas in the ocean to offset the shallow areas
close to shore. Figure 1.3d also shows that the deepest depth in the oceans (the
Challenger  Deep  region  of  the  Mariana  Trench, which  is  near  Guam)  is  a
staggering 11,022 meters (36,161 feet) below sea level.

How  do  the  continents  compare  to  the  oceans?  Figure  1.3d shows  that  the
average  height  of  the  continents  is  only  840 meters  (2756  feet), illustrating  that
the average height of the land is not very far above sea level. The highest moun-
tain in the world (the mountain with the greatest height above sea level) is Mount
Everest in the Himalaya Mountains of Asia, at 8850 meters (29,035 feet). Even so,
Mount Everest is a full 2172 meters (7126 feet) shorter than the Mariana Trench
is deep. The mountain with the greatest total height from base to top is Mauna Kea
on  the  island  of  Hawaii  in  the  United  States. It  measures  4206  meters  (13,800
feet)  above  sea  level  and  5426  meters  (17,800  feet)  from  sea  level  down  to  its
base, for  a  total  height  of  9632  meters  (31,601  feet). The  total  height  of  Mauna
Kea is 782 meters (2566 feet) higher than Mount Everest, but it is still 1390 meters
(4560 feet) shorter than the Mariana Trench is deep. In essence, no mountain on
Earth is taller than the Mariana Trench is deep.

1Throughout this book, metric measurements are used (and the corresponding English measure-
ments follow in parentheses). See Appendix I, Metric and English Units Compared, for conversion
factors between the two systems of units.

The deepest part of the ocean is the Mariana

bathysphere.

Have humans ever explored the deepest ocean
trenches? Could anything live there?

Humans  have  indeed  visited  the  deepest  part  of
the oceans where  there  is  crushing  high  pressure,
complete darkness, and near-freezing water temper-
atures half  a  century  ago!  In  January  1960,  U.S.
Navy  Lt.  Don  Walsh  and  explorer  Jacques  Piccard
descended to the bottom of the Challenger Deep region
of  the  Mariana  Trench  in  the  Trieste,  a  deep  diving
bathyscaphe (bathos * depth, scaphe * a small ship)
(Figure  1.4).  At  9906  meters  (32,500  feet),  the
men  heard  a  loud  cracking  sound  that  shook  the
cabin. They were unable to see that a 7.6-centimeter
(3-inch)  Plexiglas  viewing  port  had  cracked  (miracu-
lously, it held for the rest of the dive). More than five
hours after leaving the surface, they reached the bot-
tom,  at  10,912  meters  (35,800  feet) a  record
depth  of  human  descent  that  has  not  been  broken
since. They did see some life forms that are adapted
to  life  in  the deep:  a  small  flatfish,  a  shrimp,  and
some  jellyfish.  Other  notable  voyages  to  the  deep
ocean in submersibles are discussed in Box 1.1.

1.2 How Was Early Exploration 

of the Oceans Achieved?

In spite of the ocean s huge extent over the surface area of Earth, it has not pre-
vented  humans  from  exploring  its  furthest  reaches. Since  early  times, humans
have  developed  technology  that  has  allowed  civilizations  to  travel  across  large
stretches of open ocean. Today, we can cross even the Pacific Ocean in less than a
day by airplane. Even so, much of the deep ocean remains out of reach and woe-
fully unexplored. In fact, the surface of the Moon has been mapped more accu-
rately  than  most  parts  of  the  sea  floor. Yet  satellites  at  great  distances  above
Earth are being used to gain knowledge about our watery home.

Early History
Humankind probably first viewed the oceans as a source of food. Archeological
evidence suggests that when boat technology was developed about 40,000 years
ago, people probably traveled the oceans. Most likely, their vessels were built to
move upon the ocean s surface and transport oceangoing people to new fishing
grounds. The oceans also provided an inexpensive and efficient way to move large
and heavy objects, facilitating trade and interaction between cultures.

PACIFIC NAVIGATORS The peopling of the Pacific Islands (Oceania) is somewhat
perplexing  because  there  is  no  evidence  that  people  actually  evolved  on  these
islands. Their  presence  required  travel  over  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of
kilometers of open ocean from the continents (probably in small vessels of that
time double  canoes, outrigger  canoes, or  balsa  rafts)  as  well  as  remarkable
navigation skills (Box 1.2). The islands in the Pacific Ocean are widely scattered,
so  it  is  likely  that  only  a  fortunate  few  of  the  voyagers  made  landfall  and  that
many others perished during voyages. Figure 1.5 shows the three major inhabited
island regions in the Pacific Ocean: Micronesia (micro * small, nesia * islands),
Melanesia (mela * black, nesia * islands), and Polynesia (poly * many, nesia *
islands), which covers the largest area.

VOYAGES TO INNER SPACE: VISITING THE DEEP-OCEAN FLOOR IN SUBMERSIBLES

For as long as people have been harvesting
the  bounty  of  the  oceans  and  traveling
across  it  in  vessels, they  have  dreamed  of
plumbing  the  mysterious  depths  of  the
deep  ocean, an  area  known  as 
inner
space. However, the inaccessibility of the
deep  ocean  and  its  harsh  conditions  have
limited human exploration. One way to ex-
plore  the  deep  ocean  is  in  vessels  called
submersibles that  can  transport  surface
conditions to the intense pressure at depth.
History  credits  Alexander  the  Great
with  the  first  descent  in  a  sealed  water-
proof  container;
this  reportedly  took
place in 332 B.C. Unfortunately, there is no
record  of  what  Alexander s  submersible
looked  like. Much  later, the  submarine,
which  can  submerge, propel  itself  under-
water, and  surface  under  its  own  power,
was  developed. Because  submarines  are
difficult to detect, they can be used to sink
enemy  ships. The  earliest  report  of  a

submarine  used  in  warfare  is  from  the
early  16th  century, when  Greenlanders
used  sealskins  to  waterproof  a  three-
person, oar-powered  submarine, which
was  used  to  drill  holes  in  the  sides  of
Norwegian ships.

In  1934, reaching  even  deeper  depths
for  scientific  exploration  was  the  goal  for
naturalist William Beebe and his engineer-
associate  Otis  Barton. They  used  a  sub-
mersible  called  a  bathysphere (bathos *
depth, sphere * ball) to observe marine life
in the clear waters off Bermuda. The bathy-
sphere (Figure 1A) a heavy steel ball with
small windows was suspended from a ship
and lowered to a then-record depth of 923
meters  (3028  feet), allowing  the  first  de-
scriptions of the deep. Prior to this historic
dive, the farthest down a living human had
descended was 160 meters (525 feet)!

In 1964, the research submersible Alvin
(Figure  1B)  from  Woods  Hole  Oceano-

graphic  Institution  began  to  explore  the
deep  ocean. At  7.6  meters  (25  feet)  long,
Alvin can  carry  a  crew  of  one  pilot  and
two  scientists  to  a  depth  of  4000  meters
(13,120  feet)  and  maneuver  independ-
ently  along  the  sea  floor. Alvin has  com-
pleted  4500  dives  and  transported  more
than 12,000 people into the deep for study
and retrieval of samples. Under the direc-
tion  of  famed  oceanographer  Robert
Ballard, some  notable  accomplishments
of  Alvin include  discovering  unique  life
forms along hydrothermal vents (sea floor
hot  springs)  in  1977  and  locating  the
sunken wreck of the RMS Titanic in 1985
(see  Web  Box  6.1). In  2009, a  major
makeover  was  undertaken  to  update
Alvin s  components  and  substantially
increase  its diving  range. Currently, the
deepest-diving  manned  submersible 
is
Shinkai  6500, a  Japanese  research  vessel
that can dive to 6500 meters (21,320 feet).

record depth of 923 meters (3028 feet) in this steel bathysphere, which weighed 2268
kilograms (5000 pounds). To combat the high pressure at depth, the bathysphere had
walls that were 0.5 meter (1.5 feet) thick and small windows made of fused quartz.

HOW DO SAILORS KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AT SEA?: 
FROM STICK CHARTS TO SATELLITES

How  do  you  know  where  you  are  in  the
ocean, without  roads, signposts, or  any
land in sight? How do you determine the
distance  to  a  destination?  How  do  you
find your way back to a good fishing spot
or  where  you  have  discovered  sunken
treasure? Sailors have relied on a variety
of  navigation  tools  to  help  answer  ques-
tions such as these by locating where they
are at sea.

Some of the first navigators were the
Polynesians. Remarkably, the Polynesians
were able to successfully navigate to small
islands  located  at  great  distances  across
the Pacific Ocean. These early navigators
must have been very aware of the marine
environment and been able to read subtle
differences in the ocean and sky. The tools
they used to help them navigate between
islands  included  the  Sun  and  Moon, the
nighttime  stars, the  behavior  of  marine
organisms, various  ocean  properties, and
an  ingenious  device  called  a  stick  chart
(Figure 1C). These stick charts accurately
depicted  the  consistent  pattern  of  ocean
waves. By  orienting  their  vessels  relative
to  this  regular  ocean  wave  direction,
sailors could successfully navigate at sea.

The  bent  wave  directions  let  them  know
when they were getting close to an island
even  one  that  was  located  beyond  the
horizon.

The  importance  of  knowing  where
you  are  at  sea  is  illustrated  by  a  tragic
incident  in  1707, when  a  British  battle
fleet  was  more  than  160  kilometers  (100
miles)  off  course  and  ran  aground  in  the
Isles of Scilly near England, with the loss
of  four  ships  and  nearly  2000  men.
Latitude (location  north  or  south)  was
relatively  easy  to  determine  at  sea  by
measuring  the  position  of  the  Sun  and
stars  using  a  device  called  a  sextant
(sextant * sixth, in reference to the instru-

ment s  arc, which  is  one-sixth  of  a  circle)
(Figure 1D).The accident occurred because
the  ship s  crew  had  no  way  of  keeping
track  of  their  longitude (location  east  or
west; see  Appendix  III, Latitude  and
Longitude on  Earth ). To determine  lon-
gitude, which is a function of time, it was
necessary to know the time difference be-
tween a reference meridian and when the
Sun was directly overhead of a ship at sea
(noon  local  time). The  pendulum-driven
clocks in use in the early 1700s, however,
would  not  work  for  long  on  a  rocking
ship at sea. In 1714, the British Parliament
offered a £20,000 prize (about $20 million
today) for developing a device that would

shows islands (represented by shells at the junctions
of the sticks), regular ocean wave direction (repre-
sented by the straight strips), and waves that bend
around islands (represented by the curved strips).
Similar stick charts were used by early Polynesian
navigators.

No  written  records  of  Pacific  human  history  exist  before  the  arrival  of
Europeans in the 16th century. Nevertheless, the movement of Asian peoples into
Micronesia and Melanesia is easy to imagine because distances between islands
are relatively short. In Polynesia, however, large distances separate island groups,
which must have presented great challenges to ocean voyagers. Easter Island, for
example, at the southeastern corner of the triangular-shaped Polynesian islands
region, is more than 1600 kilometers (1000 miles) from Pitcairn Island, the next
nearest island. Clearly, a voyage to the Hawaiian Islands must have been one of

gitude within half a degree or 30 nautical
miles (34.5 statute miles) after a voyage to
the West Indies.

A  cabinetmaker 

in  Lincolnshire,
England, named  John  Harrison began
working in 1728 on such a timepiece, which
was  dubbed  the  chronometer (chrono *
time, meter * measure)  Harrison s  first
chronometer, H-1, was successfully tested in
1736, but he received only £500 of the prize
because the device was deemed too com-
plex, costly, and  fragile. Eventually, his
more  compact  fourth  version, H-4
which  resembles  an  oversized  pocket
watch  (Figure  1E) was  tested  during  a
trans-Atlantic  voyage 
in  1761. Upon
reaching Jamaica, it was so accurate that it
had lost only five seconds of time, a longi-
tude error of only 0.02 degree, or 1.2 nau-
tical  miles  (1.4  statute  miles)!  Although
Harrison s chronometer greatly exceeded
the  requirements  of  the  government, the

committee in charge of the prize withheld
payment, mostly  because  the  astronomers
on the board wanted the solution to come
from  measurement  of  the  stars. Because
the  committee  refused  to  award  him  the
prize  without  further  proof, a  second  sea
trial  was  conducted  in  1764, which  con-
firmed his success. Harrison was reluctantly
granted  £10,000. Only  when  King  George
III intervened in 1773 did Harrison finally
receive  the  remaining  prize  money  and
recognition for his life work at age 80.

surface. Position is determined by very ac-
curate  measurement  of  the  time  of  travel
of  radio  signals  from  at  least  four  of  the
satellites  to  receivers  on  board  a  ship  (or
on  land). Thus, a  vessel  can  determine  its
exact latitude and longitude to within a few
meters a  small  fraction  of  the  length  of
most  ships. Navigators from  days  gone  by
would be amazed at how quickly and accu-
rately  a  vessel s  location can  be  deter-
mined, but they might say that it has taken
all the adventure out of navigating at sea.

the nearest inhabited islands, the Marquesas Islands (Figure 1.5).

Archeological  evidence  suggests  that  humans  from  New  Guinea  may  have
occupied  New  Ireland  as  early  as  4000  or  5000  B.C. However, there  is  little  evi-
dence of human travel farther into the Pacific Ocean before 1100 B.C. By then, the
Lapita, a  group  of  early  people  who  are  thought  to  have  come  from  island
Southeast Asia and produced a distinctive type of pottery, had traveled on to Fiji,
Tonga, and Samoa (Figure 1.5, yellow arrow). From there, Polynesians sailed on to

the Marquesas (about 30 B.C.), which appear to have been the starting point for
voyages to the far reaches of the island Pacific (Figure 1.5, green arrows), includ-
ing  the  Hawaiian  Islands  (about  300  A.D.)  and  New  Zealand  (about  800  A.D.).
Surprisingly, new  genetic  research  suggests  that  Polynesians  populated  Easter
Island relatively recently, about 1200 A.D.

Despite the obvious Polynesian backgrounds of the Hawaiians, the Maori of
New Zealand, and the Easter Islanders, an adventurous biologist/anthropologist
named  Thor  Heyerdahl proposed  that  voyagers  from  South America  may  have
reached  islands  of  the  South  Pacific  before  the  coming  of  the  Polynesians.
To prove  his  point, in  1947  he  sailed  the  Kon  Tiki
a  balsa  raft  designed  like
those  that  were  used  by  South  American  navigators  at  the  time  of  European
discovery
from South America to the Tuamotu Islands, a journey of more than
11,300 kilometers (7000 miles) (Figure 1.5, red arrow). Although the remarkable
voyage of the Kon Tiki demonstrates that early South Americans could have trav-
eled to Polynesia just as easily as early Asian cultures, anthropologists can find no
evidence  of  such  a  migration. Further, comparative  DNA  studies  show  a
strong genetic relationship between the peoples of Easter Island and
Polynesia, but none between these groups and natives in coastal

The Greek astronomer-geographer Pytheas
sailed northward in 325 B.C. using a simple yet
elegant  method  for  determining 
latitude
(one s position north or south) in the Northern
Hemisphere. His  method  involved  measuring
the angle between an observer s line of sight to
the North Star and line of sight to the northern
horizon.2 Despite  Pytheas s  method  for  deter-
mining latitude, it was still impossible to accurately

determine longitude (one s position east or west).

One  of  the  key  repositories  of  scientific  knowl-
edge  at  the  time  was  the  Library  of  Alexandria in
Alexandria, Egypt, which was founded in the 3rd century
B.C. by  Alexander  the  Great. It  housed  an  impressive  collec-
tion of written knowledge that attracted scientists, poets, philoso-
phers, artists, and  writers  who  studied  and  researched  there. The
Library of Alexandria soon became the intellectual capital of the world,

60°

featuring history s greatest accumulation of ancient writings.

As  long  ago  as  450  B.C., Greek  scholars  became  convinced  that  Earth
was round using lines of evidence such as the way ships disappeared beyond the
horizon  and  the  shadows  of  Earth  that  appeared  during  eclipses  of  the  Moon.
This  inspired  the  Greek  Eratosthenes (pronounced  AIR-uh-TOS-thuh-neez )

(276 192 B.C.), the second librarian at the Library of Alexandria, to cleverly use
the shadow of a stick in a hole in the ground and elementary geometry to deter-
mine Earth s circumference. His value of 40,000 kilometers (24,840 miles) com-
pares well with the true value of 40,032 kilometers (24,875 miles) known today.

An  Egyptian-Greek  named  Claudius  Ptolemy (c. 85  A.D. c. 165  A.D.)  pro-
duced a map of the world in about 150 A.D. that represented the extent of Roman
knowledge  at  that  time. The  map  included  the  continents  of  Europe, Asia, and
Africa, as did earlier Greek maps, but it also included vertical lines of longitude
and horizontal lines of latitude, which had been developed by Alexandrian schol-
ars. Moreover, Ptolemy showed the known seas to be surrounded by land, much
of which was as yet unknown and proved to be a great enticement to explorers.

Ptolemy  also  introduced  an  (erroneous)  update  to  Eratosthenes s  surpris-
ingly accurate estimate of Earth s circumference. Unfortunately, Ptolemy wrongly
depended on flawed calculations and an overestimation of the size of Asia, so he
determined Earth s circumference to be 29,000 kilometers (18,000 miles), which is
about 28% too small. Remarkably, nearly 1500 years later, Ptolemy s error caused
explorer  Christopher  Columbus  to  believe  he  had  encountered  parts  of  Asia
rather than a new world.

The Middle Ages
After the destruction of the Library of Alexandria in 415 A.D. (in which all of its
contents were burned) and the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 A.D., the achieve-
ments  of  the  Phoenicians, Greeks, and  Romans  were  mostly  lost. Some  of  the
knowledge, however, was retained by the Arabs, who controlled northern Africa
and Spain. The Arabs used this knowledge to become the dominant navigators in
the Mediterranean Sea area and to trade extensively with East Africa, India, and
southeast Asia. The Arabs  were  able  to  trade  across  the  Indian  Ocean  because
they  had  learned  how  to  take  advantage  of  the  seasonal  patterns  of  monsoon
winds. During the summer, when monsoon winds blow from the southwest, ships
laden  with  goods  would  leave  the  Arabian  ports  and  sail  eastward  across  the
Indian Ocean. During the winter, when the trade winds blow from the northeast,
ships would return west.3

Meanwhile, in the rest of southern and eastern Europe, Christianity was on
the rise. Scientific inquiry counter to religious teachings was actively suppressed
and the knowledge gained by previous civilizations was either lost or ignored. As
a result, the Western concept of world geography degenerated considerably dur-
ing these so-called Dark Ages. For example, one notion envisioned the world as a
disk with Jerusalem at the center.

In northern Europe, the Vikings of Scandinavia, who had excellent ships and
good navigation skills, actively explored the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 1.6). Late in
the  10th  century, aided  by  a  period  of  worldwide  climatic  warming, the Vikings
the  Red   Thorvaldson sailed  westward
colonized  Iceland. In  about  981, Erik 
from Iceland and discovered Greenland. He may also have traveled further west-
ward  to  Baffin  Island. He  returned  to  Iceland  and  led  the  first  wave  of Viking
colonists to Greenland in 985. Bjarni Herjolfsson sailed from Iceland to join the
colonists, but he sailed too far southwest and is thought to be the first Viking to
have  seen  what  is  now  called  Newfoundland. Bjarni  did  not  land  but  instead
returned  to  the  new  colony  at  Greenland. Leif  Eriksson, son  of  Erik  the  Red,
became intrigued by Bjarni s stories about the new land Bjarni had seen. In 995,
Leif bought Bjarni s ship and set out from Greenland for the land that Bjarni had
seen to the southwest. Leif spent the winter in that portion of North America and
named the land Vinland (now Newfoundland, Canada) after the grapes that were
found there. Climatic cooling and inappropriate farming practices for the region

caused  these Viking  colonies  in  Greenland  and Vinland  to  struggle  and  die  out 
by about 1450.

The Age of Discovery in Europe
The 30-year period from 1492 to 1522 is known as the Age of Discovery. During
this time, Europeans explored the continents of North and South America and the
globe was circumnavigated for the first time. As a result, Europeans learned the
true extent of the world s oceans and that human populations existed elsewhere
on newly  discovered continents and islands with cultures vastly different from
those familiar to European voyagers.

Why  was  there  such  an  increase  in  ocean  exploration  during  the  Age  of
Discovery? One reason was that Sultan Mohammed II had captured Constantinople
(the capital of eastern Christendom) in 1453, a conquest that isolated Mediterranean
port cities from the riches of India,Asia, and the East Indies (modern-day Indonesia).
As a result, the Western world had to search for new Eastern trade routes by sea.

The  Portuguese, under  the  leadership  of  Prince  Henry  the  Navigator
(1392 1460), led  a  renewed  effort  to  explore  outside  Europe. The  prince  estab-
lished  a  marine  institution  at  Sagres  to  improve  Portuguese  sailing  skills. The
treacherous journey around the tip of Africa was a great obstacle to an alterna-
tive trade route. Cape Agulhas (at the southern tip of Africa) was first rounded by
Bartholomeu Diaz in 1486. He was followed in 1498 by Vasco da Gama, who con-
tinued  around  the  tip  of Africa  to  India, thus  establishing  a  new  Eastern  trade
route to Asia.

Meanwhile, the  Italian  navigator  and  explorer  Christopher  Columbus was
financed by Spanish monarchs to find a new route to the East Indies across the
Atlantic  Ocean. During  Columbus s  first  voyage  in  1492, he  sailed  west  from
Spain  and  made  landfall  after  a  two-month  journey  (Figure  1.7). Columbus
believed  that  he  had  arrived  in  the  East  Indies  somewhere  near  India, but
Earth s circumference had been substantially underestimated, so he was unaware
that  he  had  actually  arrived  in  uncharted  territory  in  the  Caribbean. Upon  his
return to Spain and the announcement of his discovery, additional voyages were

What is NOAA? What is its role in oceanographic 
research?

NOAA  (pronounced  NO-ah )  stands  for  National
Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  and  is  the
branch  of  the  U.S.  Commerce  Department  that
oversees  oceanographic  research.  Scientists  at
NOAA  work  to  ensure  wise  use  of  ocean  resources
through  the  National  Ocean  Service,  the  National
Oceanographic  Data  Center,  the  National  Marine
Fisheries Service, and the National Sea Grant Office.
Other  U.S.  government  agencies  that  work  with
oceanographic  data 
the  U.S.  Naval
Oceanographic  Office,  the  Office  of  Naval  Research,
the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Geological Survey
(coastal  processes  and  marine  geology).  The  NOAA
Website is at http://www.noaa.gov/. Recently, sev-
eral  senior  federal  officials  have  proposed  merging
NOAA  and  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  to  form  an
integrated Earth Systems Science Agency (ESSA).

planned. During the next 10 years, Columbus made three more trips across the
Atlantic.

Even though Christopher Columbus is widely credited with discovering North
America, he never actually set foot on the continent.4 Still, his journeys inspired
other navigators to explore the  New World. For example, in 1497, only five years
after Columbus s first voyage, Englishman John Cabot landed somewhere on the
northeast coast of North America. Later, Europeans first saw the Pacific Ocean in
1513, when Vasco Núñez de Balboa attempted a land crossing of the Isthmus of
Panama and sighted a large ocean to the west from atop a mountain.

The culmination of the Age of Discovery was a remarkable circumnavigation
of the globe initiated by Ferdinand Magellan (Figure 1.7). Magellan left Spain in
September 1519, with five ships and 280 sailors. He crossed the Atlantic Ocean,
sailed down the eastern coast of South America, and traveled through a passage
to  the  Pacific  Ocean  at  52  degrees  south  latitude, now  named  the  Strait  of
Magellan  in  his  honor. After  landing  in  the  Philippines  on  March  15, 1521,
Magellan was killed in a fight with the inhabitants of these islands. Juan Sebastian
del  Caño completed  the  circumnavigation  by  taking  the  last  of  the  ships, the
Victoria, across the Indian Ocean, around Africa, and back to Spain in 1522. After
three years, just one ship and 18 men completed the voyage.

Following these voyages, the Spanish initiated many others to take gold from
the  Aztec  and  Inca  cultures  in  Mexico  and  South  America. The  English  and
Dutch, meanwhile, used smaller, more maneuverable ships to rob the gold from
bulky  Spanish  galleons, which  resulted  in  many  confrontations  at  sea. The  mar-
itime dominance of Spain ended when the English defeated the Spanish Armada
in  1588. With  control  of  the  seas, the  English  thus  became  the  dominant  world
power

a status they retained until early in the 20th century.

The Beginning of Voyaging for Science
The  English  realized  that  increasing  their  scientific  knowledge  of  the  oceans
would  help  maintain  their  maritime  superiority. For  this  reason, Captain  James
Cook (1728 1779), an English navigator and prolific explorer (Figure 1.8), under-
took three voyages of scientific discovery with the ships Endeavour, Resolution,
and  Adventure between  1768  and  1779. He  searched  for  the  continent  Terra
Australis ( Southern Land, or Antarctica) and concluded that it lay beneath or
beyond  the  extensive  ice  fields  of  the  southern  oceans, if  it  existed  at  all. Cook
also  mapped  many  previously  unknown  islands, including  the  South  Georgia,
South Sandwich, and Hawaiian islands. During his last voyage, Cook searched for
the fabled  northwest passage from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean and
stopped in Hawaii, where he was killed in a skirmish with native Hawaiians.

Cook s expeditions added greatly to the scientific knowledge of the oceans.
He determined the outline of the Pacific Ocean and was the first person known to
cross the Antarctic Circle in his search for Antarctica. Cook initiated systematic
sampling of subsurface water temperatures, measuring winds and currents, taking
soundings (which are depth measurements that, at the time, were taken by lower-
ing a long rope with a weight on the end to the sea floor), and collecting data on
coral  reefs. Cook  also  discovered  that  a  shipboard  diet  containing  the  German
staple sauerkraut prevented his crew from contracting scurvy, a disease that inca-
pacitated sailors. Scurvy is caused by a vitamin C deficiency and the cabbage used
to make sauerkraut contains large quantities of vitamin C. Prior to Cook s discovery
about  preventing  scurvy, the  malady  claimed  more  lives  than  all  other  types  of
deaths at sea, including contagious disease, gunfire, and shipwreck. In addition, by
proving  the  value  of  John  Harrison s  chronometer  as  a  means  of  determining

History of Oceanography . . . To Be Continued
Much has changed from the early days of studying the oceans. Today, oceanogra-
phers  use  many  high-technology  tools, such  as  state-of-the-art  research  vessels
that routinely use sonar to map the sea floor, remotely operated data collection
devices, robotics, sea floor observation networks, sophisticated computer models,
and  Earth-orbiting  satellites. Many  of  these  tools  are  featured  throughout  this
book. Further, additional events in the history of oceanography can be found as
historical feature boxes in subsequent chapters. These boxed features are identi-
fied  by  the  Historical  Feature theme  and  introduce  an  important  historical
event that is related to the subject of that particular chapter.

1.3 What Is the Nature of Scientific

Inquiry?

In modern society, scientific studies are increasingly used to substantiate the need
for action. However, there is often little understanding of how science operates.
For  instance, how  certain  are  we  about  a  particular  scientific  theory?  How  are
facts different from theories?

The overall goal of science is to discover underlying patterns in the natural
world and then to use this knowledge to make predictions about what should or
should not be expected to happen given a certain set of circumstances. Scientists
develop explanations about the causes and effects of various natural phenomena

formally conducted than is implied in this figure.

(such as why Earth has seasons or what the structure of matter is). This work is
based  on  an  assumption  that  all  natural  phenomena  are  controlled  by  under-
standable  physical  processes  and  the  same  physical  processes  operating  today
have  been  operating  throughout  time. Consequently, science  has  demonstrated
remarkable power in allowing scientists to describe the natural world accurately,
to identify the underlying causes of natural phenomena, and to better predict future
events that rely on natural processes.

Science supports the explanation of the natural world that best explains all
available  observations. Scientific  inquiry  is  formalized  into  what  is  called  the
scientific method, which is used to formulate scientific theories (Figure 1.9).

Observations
The  scientific  method  begins  with  observations, which  are  occurrences  we  can
measure  with  our  senses. They  are  things  we  can  manipulate, see, touch, hear,
taste, or  smell, often  by  experimenting  with  them  directly  or  by  using  sophisti-
cated tools (such as a microscope or telescope) to sense them. If an observation is
repeatedly confirmed that is, made so many times that it is assumed to be com-
pletely valid then it can be called a scientific fact.

Hypothesis
As observations are being made, the human mind attempts to sort out the obser-
vations in a way that reveals some underlying order or pattern in the objects or
phenomena  being  observed. This  sorting  process which  involves  a  lot  of  trial
and error
seems to be driven by a fundamental human urge to make sense of
our  world. This  is  how  hypotheses (hypo * under, thesis * an  arranging)  are
made. A hypothesis is sometimes labeled as an informed or educated guess, but it
is more than that. A hypothesis is a tentative, testable statement about the general
nature of the phenomena observed. In other words, a hypothesis is an initial idea
of how or why things happen in nature.

Suppose  we  want  to  understand  why  whales  breach (that  is, why  whales
sometimes  leap  entirely  out  of  water). After  scientists  observe  breaching  many
times, they can organize their observations into a hypothesis. For instance, one hy-
pothesis  is  that  a  breaching  whale  is  trying  to  dislodge  parasites  from  its  body.
Scientists often have multiple working hypotheses (for example, whales may use
breaching to communicate with other whales). If a hypothesis cannot be tested, it
is not scientifically useful, no matter how interesting it might seem.

Testing
Hypotheses are used to predict certain occurrences that lead to further research
and  the  refinement  of  those  hypotheses. For  instance, the  hypothesis  that  a
breaching whale is trying to dislodge its parasites suggests that breaching whales
have more parasites than whales that don t breach. Analyzing the number of par-
asites  on  breaching  versus  nonbreaching  whales  would  either  support  that
hypothesis or cause it to be recycled and modified. If observations clearly suggest
that  the  hypothesis  is  incorrect  (the  hypothesis  is  falsified), then  it  must  be
dropped and other alternative explanations of the facts must be considered.

In science, the validity of any explanation is determined by its coherence with
observations in the natural world and its ability to predict further observations.
Only  after  much  testing  and  experimentation usually  done  by  many  experi-
menters using a wide variety of repeatable tests does a hypothesis gain validity
where it can be advanced to the next step.

How can I accept a scientific idea if its just 
a theory?

When most people use the word  theory  in everyday
life,  it  usually  means  an  idea  or  a  guess  (such  as
the all-too-common  conspiracy  theory ),  but  the
word has a much different meaning in science. In sci-
ence, a theory is not a guess or a hunch. It s a well-
substantiated, well-supported, well-documented expla-
nation  for observations about the natural world. It s a
powerful  tool  that  ties  together  all  the  facts  about
something,  providing  an  explanation  that  fits  all  the
observations  and  can  even  be  used  to  make  predic-
tions.  In  science,  theory  is  the  ultimate  goal;  it s  the
well-proven explanation of how things work.

There is also the misconception that in science,
once a theory is proven, it becomes a law. That s not
how it works. In science, we collect facts, or observa-
tions,  we  use  laws  to  describe  them,  and  a  theory
to explain them. For example, the law of gravity is a
description  of  the  force;  then  there  is  the theory of
gravitational attraction, which explains why the force
occurs. Theories don t get  promoted  to a law by an
abundance of proof, and so a theory never becomes
a  law.  That  doesn t  mean  that  scientists  are  unsure
of  theories;  in  fact,  theories  are  as  close  to  proven 
as  anything  in  science  can  be.  So,  don t  discount  a
scientific idea because it s  just a theory.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Science supports the explanation of the natural
world that best explains all available observations.
Because new observations can modify existing 
theories, science is always developing.

Theory
If a hypothesis has been strengthened by additional observations and if it is success-
ful in predicting additional phenomena, then it can be advanced to what is called a
theory (theoria * a looking at) A theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some
aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws (descriptive generaliza-
tions about the behavior of an aspect of the natural world), logical inferences, and
tested hypotheses. A theory is not a guess or a hunch. Rather, it is an understanding
that develops from extensive observation, experimentation, and creative reflection.
In science, theories are formalized only after many years of testing and verify-
ing predictions. Thus, scientific theories are those that have been rigorously scruti-
nized to the point where most scientists agree that they are the best explanation
of  certain  observable  facts. Examples  of  prominent, well-accepted  theories  that
are held with a very high degree of confidence include biology s theory of evolu-
tion (which is discussed later in this chapter) and geology s theory of plate tecton-
ics (which will be covered in the next chapter).

Theories and the Truth
We ve  seen  how  the  scientific  method  is  used  to  develop  theories, but  does  sci-
ence  ever  arrive  at  the  undisputed  truth ?  Science  never  reaches  an  absolute
truth because we can never be certain that we have all the observations, especially
considering that new technology will be available in the future to examine phe-
nomena in different ways. New observations are always possible, so the nature of
scientific truth is subject to change. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that sci-
ence arrives at that which is probably true, based on the available observations.

It is not a downfall of science that scientific ideas are modified as more obser-
vations are collected. In fact, the opposite is true. Science is a process that depends
on  reexamining  ideas  as  new  observations  are  made. Thus, science  progresses
when new observations yield new hypotheses and modification of theories. As a
result, science is littered with hypotheses that have been abandoned in favor of
later  explanations  that  fit  new  observations. One  of  the  best  known  is  the  idea
that Earth was at the center of the universe, a proposal that was supported by the
apparent daily motion of the Sun, Moon, and stars around Earth.

The statements of science should never be accepted as the  final truth. Over
time, however, they generally form a sequence of increasingly more accurate state-
ments. Theories are the endpoints in science and do not turn into facts through accu-
mulation of evidence. Nevertheless, the data can become so convincing that the ac-
curacy of a theory is no longer questioned. For instance, the heliocentric (helios *
sun, centric * center) theory of our solar system states that Earth revolves around
the Sun rather than vice versa. Such concepts are supported by such abundant obser-
vational and experimental evidence that they are no longer questioned in science.

Is there really such a formal method to science as the scientific method sug-
gests? Actually, the work of scientists is much less formal and is not always done
in  a  clearly  logical  and  systematic  manner. Like  detectives  analyzing  a  crime
scene, scientists  use  ingenuity  and  serendipity, visualize  models, and  sometimes
follow hunches in order to unravel the mysteries of nature.

1.4 How Were Earth and the Solar

System Created?

Earth is the third of eight major planets5 in our solar system that revolve around
the Sun (Figure 1.10). Evidence suggests that the Sun and the rest of the solar sys-
tem  formed  about  5  billion  years  ago  from  a  huge  cloud  of  gas  and  space  dust

5Pluto, which used to be considered the ninth planet in our solar system, was reclassified by the
in 2006, along with other similar bodies.

called  a  nebula (nebula * a  cloud)  Astronomers  base  this  hypothesis  on  the
orderly nature of our solar system and the consistent age of meteorites (pieces of
the  early  solar  system). Using  sophisticated  telescopes, astronomers  have  also
been able to observe distant nebula in various stages of formation (Figure 1.11).
In  addition, more  than  300  planets  have  been  discovered  outside  our  solar
system including  one  that  is  about the size of Earth by  detecting the  telltale
wobble of distant stars.

The Nebular Hypothesis
According to the nebular hypothesis (Figure 1.12), all bodies in the solar system
formed from an enormous cloud composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with
only a small percentage of heavier elements. As this huge accumulation of gas and
dust revolved around its center, the Sun began to form as magnetic fields and tur-
bulence  worked  with  the  force  of  gravity  to  concentrate  particles. In  its  early
stages, the  diameter  of  the  Sun  may  have  equaled  or  exceeded  the  diameter  of
our entire planetary system today.

As  the  nebular  matter  that  formed  the  Sun  contracted, small  amounts  of  it
were left behind in eddies, which are similar to small whirlpools in a stream. The
material in these eddies was the beginning of the protoplanets (proto * original,
planetes * wanderer)  and  their  orbiting  satellites, which  later  consolidated  into
the present planets and their moons.

Protoearth
Protoearth looked  very  different  from  Earth  today. Its  size  was  larger  than
today s Earth, and there were neither oceans nor any life on the planet. In addi-
tion, the  structure of  the deep Protoearth is thought  to have been  homogenous
(homo * alike, genous * producing), which means that it had a uniform composition

throughout. The  structure  of  Protoearth  changed, however,
when  its  heavier  constituents  migrated  toward  the  center  to
form a heavy core.

During  this  early  stage  of  formation, many  meteorites
from  space  bombarded  Protoearth  (Figure  1.13). In  fact, a
leading theory states that the Moon was born in the aftermath
of a titanic collision between a Mars-size planet named Theia
and  the  Protoearth. While  most  of  Theia  was  swallowed  up
and incorporated into the magma ocean it created on impact,
the collision also flung a small world s worth of vaporized and
molten rock into orbit. Over time, this debris coalesced into a
sphere and created Earth s orbiting companion, the Moon.

During  this  early  formation  of  the  protoplanets  and  their
satellites, the Sun condensed into such a hot, concentrated mass
that forces within its interior began releasing energy through a
process known as a fusion (fusus * melted) reaction. A fusion
reaction  occurs  when  temperatures  reach  tens  of  millions  of
degrees and hydrogen atoms (a * not, tomos * cut) combine to
form helium atoms, releasing large amounts of energy.6 Not only
does  the  Sun  emit  light, but  it  also  emits  ionized (electrically
charged) particles that make up the solar wind. During the early
stages  of  creation  of  the solar  system, this  solar  wind  blew
away the nebular gas that remained from the formation of the
planets and their satellites.

Meanwhile, the protoplanets closest to the Sun (including
Earth) were heated so intensely by solar radiation that their
initial  atmospheres  (mostly  hydrogen  and  helium)  boiled
away. In  addition, the  combination  of  ionized  solar  particles
and  internal  warming  of  these  protoplanets  caused  them  to

result, all matter

even the matter that comprises our bodies originated as stardust long ago.

drastically shrink in size. As the protoplanets continued to contract, heat was pro-
duced  deep  within  their  cores  from  the  spontaneous  disintegration  of  atoms,
called radioactivity (radio * ray, acti * to cause).

Density and Density Stratification
Density, which is an extremely important physical property of matter, is defined
as mass per unit volume. In common terms, an easy way to think about density is
that it is a measure of how heavy something is for its size. For instance, an object
that has a low density is light for its size (like a dry sponge, foam packing, or a
surfboard). Conversely, an object that has a high density is heavy for its size (like
cement, most  metals, or  a  large  container  full  of  water). Note  that  density  has
nothing to do with the thickness of an object; some objects (like a stack of foam
packing) can be thick but have low density. In reality, density is related to molecu-
lar  packing, with  higher  packing  of  molecules  into  a  certain  space  resulting  in
higher density. As we ll see, the density of Earth s layers dramatically affects their
positions within Earth. In subsequent chapters, we ll also explore how the density
of air masses affects their properties and how the density of water masses influ-
ences their position and movement.

The  release  of  internal  heat  was  so  intense  that  Earth s  surface  became
molten. Once Earth became a ball of hot liquid rock, the elements were able to
segregate  according  to  their  densities  in  a  process  called  density  stratification
(strati * a layer, fication * making), which occurs because of gravitational separation.
The  highest-density  materials  (primarily  iron  and  nickel)  concentrated  in  the

core, whereas progressively lower-density components (primarily rocky material)
formed concentric spheres around the core. If you ve ever noticed how oil-and-
vinegar  salad  dressing  settles  out  into  a  lower-density  top  layer  (the  oil)  and  a
higher-density bottom layer (the vinegar), then you ve seen how density stratifi-
cation causes separate layers to form.

Earth s Internal Structure
As a result of density stratification, Earth became a layered sphere based on den-
sity, with  the  highest-density  material  found  near  the  center  of  Earth  and  the
lowest-density  material  located  near  the  surface. Let s  examine  Earth s  internal
structure and the characteristics of its layers.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION VERSUS PHYSICAL PROPERTIES The cross-sectional
view of Earth in Figure 1.14 shows that Earth s inner structure can be subdivided
according to its chemical composition (the chemical makeup of Earth materials) or
its  physical  properties  (how  the  rocks  respond  to  increased  temperature  and
pressure at depth).

CHEMICAL  COMPOSITION Based  on  chemical  composition, Earth  consists  of
three  layers: the  crust, the  mantle, and  the  core (Figure  1.14). If  Earth  were
reduced to the size of an apple, then the crust would be its thin skin. It extends

from the surface to an average depth of about 30 kilometers (20 miles). The crust
is  composed  of  relatively  low-density  rock, consisting  mostly  of  various  silicate
minerals (common rock-forming minerals with silicon and oxygen). There are two
types of crust, oceanic and continental, which will be discussed in the next section.
Immediately below the crust is the mantle. It occupies the largest volume of the
three layers and extends to a depth of about 2885 kilometers (1800 miles).The man-
tle is composed of relatively high-density iron and magnesium silicate rock.

Beneath the mantle is the core. It forms a large mass from 2885 kilometers
(1800 miles) to the center of Earth at 6371 kilometers (3960 miles). The core is
composed of even higher-density metal (mostly iron and nickel).

PHYSICAL  PROPERTIES Based  on  physical  properties, Earth  is  composed  of
five layers (Figure 1.14): the inner core, the outer core, the mesosphere (mesos *
middle, sphere * ball), the asthenosphere (asthenos * weak, sphere * ball), and
the lithosphere (lithos * rock, sphere * ball).

The  lithosphere  is  Earth s  cool, rigid, outermost  layer. It  extends  from  the
surface to an average depth of about 100 kilometers (62 miles) and includes the
crust plus the topmost portion of the mantle. The lithosphere is brittle (brytten *
to shatter), meaning that it will fracture when force is applied to it. As will be dis-
cussed in Chapter 2, Plate Tectonics and the Ocean Floor, the plates involved in
plate tectonic motion are the plates of the lithosphere.

Beneath  the  lithosphere  is  the  asthenosphere. The  asthenosphere  is  plastic
(plasticus * molded), meaning that it will flow when a gradual force is applied to
it. It extends from about 100 kilometers (62 miles) to 700 kilometers (430 miles)
below the surface, which is the base of the upper mantle. At these depths, it is hot
enough to partially melt portions of most rocks.

Beneath the asthenosphere is the mesosphere. The mesosphere extends to a
depth  of  about  2885  kilometers  (1800  miles), which  corresponds  to  the  middle
and  lower  mantle. Although  the  asthenosphere  deforms  plastically, the  mesos-
phere is rigid, most likely due to the increased pressure at these depths.

Beneath  the  mesosphere  is  the  core. The  core  consists  of  the  outer  core,
which is liquid and capable of flowing, and the inner core, which is rigid and does
not flow. Again, the increased pressure at the center of Earth keeps the inner core
from flowing.

NEAR  THE  SURFACE The  top  portion  of  Figure  1.16 shows  an  enlargement  of
Earth s layers closest to the surface.

Lithosphere The  lithosphere is a relatively  cool, rigid  shell that  includes all the
crust  and  the  topmost  part  of  the  mantle. In  essence, the  topmost  part  of  the
mantle  is  attached  to  the  crust  and  the  two  act  as  a  single  unit, approximately
100 kilometers (62 miles) thick. The expanded view in Figure 1.16 shows that the
crust  portion  of  the  lithosphere  is  further  subdivided  into  oceanic  crust  and
continental crust, which are compared in Table 1.1.

Oceanic versus Continental Crust Oceanic crust underlies the ocean basins and
is composed of the igneous rock basalt, which is dark colored and has a relatively
high density of about 3.0 grams per cubic centimeter.7 The average thickness of
the oceanic crust is only about 8 kilometers (5 miles). Basalt originates as molten
magma beneath Earth s crust (typically from the mantle), some of which comes
to the surface during underwater sea floor eruptions.

Continental crust is composed mostly of the lower-density and lighter-colored
igneous rock granite.8 It has a density of about 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. The

7Water has a density of 1.0 grams per cubic centimeter. Thus, basalt with a density of 3.0 grams per
cubic centimeter is three times denser than water.
8At the surface, continental crust is often covered by a relatively thin layer of surface sediments.
Below these, granite can be found.

face, it is all part of the lithosphere.

Asthenosphere The  asthenosphere  is  a  relatively  hot, plastic
region  beneath  the  lithosphere. It  extends  from  the  base  of
the lithosphere to a depth of about 700 kilometers (430 miles)
and  is  entirely  contained  within  the  upper  mantle. The
asthenosphere  can  deform  without  fracturing  if  a  force  is
applied  slowly. This  means  that  it  has  the  ability  to  flow  but
has high viscosity (viscosus * sticky). Viscosity is a measure of
a  substance s  resistance  to  flow.9 Studies  indicate  that  the
high-viscosity asthenosphere is flowing slowly through time; this
has  important  implications  for  the  movement  of  lithospheric
plates.

the vertical movement of crust

ISOSTATIC  ADJUSTMENT Isostatic  (iso =  equal, stasis =
standing) adjustment
is the
result of the buoyancy of Earth s lithosphere as it floats on the
denser, plasticlike  asthenosphere  below. Figure  1.17, which
shows a container ship floating in water, provides an example
of isostatic adjustment. It shows that an empty ship floats high
in the water. Once the  ship  is loaded  with  cargo, though, the
ship  undergoes  isostatic  adjustment  and  floats  lower  in  the
water (but hopefully won t sink!). When the cargo is unloaded,
the ship isostatically adjusts itself and floats higher again.

Similarly, both continental and oceanic crust float on the
denser  mantle  beneath. Oceanic  crust  is  denser  than  conti-
nental  crust, however, so  oceanic  crust  floats  lower  in  the
mantle because of isostatic adjustment. Oceanic crust is also
thin, which creates low areas for the oceans to occupy. Areas
where the continental crust is thickest (such as large moun-
tain  ranges  on  the  continents)  float  higher  than  continental
crust  of  normal 
isostatic

thickness, also  because  of

adjustment. These mountains are similar to the top of a floating iceberg
they
float high because there is a very thick mass of crustal material beneath them,
plunged deeper into the asthenosphere. Thus, tall mountain ranges on Earth are
composed  of  a  great  thickness  of  crustal  material  that  in  essence  keeps  them
buoyed up.

Areas that are exposed to an increased or decreased load experience isostatic
adjustment. For instance, during the most recent ice age (which occurred during
the Pleistocene Epoch between about 1.8 million and 10,000 years ago), massive
ice sheets alternately covered and exposed northern regions such as Scandinavia
and  northern  Canada. The  additional  weight  of  ice  several  kilometers  thick
caused these areas to isostatically adjust themselves lower in the mantle. Since the
end of the ice age, the reduced load on these areas caused by the melting of ice
caused  these  areas  to  rise  and  experience  isostatic  rebound, which  continues
today. The rate at which isostatic rebound occurs gives scientists important infor-
mation about the properties of the upper mantle.

Further, isostatic adjustment provides additional evidence for the movement of
Earth s tectonic plates. Because continents isostatically adjust themselves by moving
vertically, then they must not be firmly fixed in one position on Earth. If this is true,
the plates that contain these continents should certainly be able to move horizontally
across Earth s surface. This idea will be explored in more detail in the next chapter.

1.5 How Were Earth s Atmosphere 

and Oceans Created?

The creation of Earth s atmosphere is related to the creation of the oceans; both
are a direct result of density stratification.

Origin of Earth s Atmosphere
Where did the atmosphere come from? As previously mentioned, Earth s initial
atmosphere consisted of leftover gases from the nebula, but those particles were
blown out to space by the Sun s solar wind. After that, a second atmosphere was
most likely expelled from inside Earth by a process called outgassing. During the
period  of  density  stratification, the  lowest-density  material  contained  within
Earth was composed of various gases. These gases rose to the surface and were
expelled to form Earth s early atmosphere.

What was the composition of these atmospheric gases? They are believed to
have been similar to the gases emitted  from volcanoes, geysers, and hot springs
today: mostly water vapor (steam), with small amounts of carbon dioxide, hydro-
gen, and other gases. The composition of this early atmosphere was not, however,
the same composition as today s atmosphere. The composition of the atmosphere
changed over time because of the influence of life (as will be discussed shortly)
and possibly because of changes in the mixing of material in the mantle.

Origin of Earth s Oceans
Where did the oceans come from? Their origin is directly linked to the origin of
the atmosphere. Figure 1.18 shows that as Earth cooled, the water vapor released
to the atmosphere during outgassing condensed and fell to Earth. Evidence sug-
gests that by at least 4 billion years ago, most of the water vapor from outgassing
had accumulated to form the first permanent oceans on Earth.

THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  OCEAN  SALINITY The  relentless  rainfall  that  landed
on  Earth s  rocky  surface  dissolved  many  elements  and  compounds  and  carried
them  into  the  newly  forming  oceans. Even  though  Earth s  oceans  have  existed
since  early  in  the  formation  of  the  planet, its  chemical  composition  must  have

Earth has differences in composition and physical
properties that create layers such as the

Have the oceans always been salty? Are the oceans
growing more or less salty through time?

It  is  likely  that  the  oceans  have  always  been  salty
because  wherever  water  comes  in  contact  with  the
rocks of Earth s crust, some of the minerals dissolve.
This  is  the  source  of  salts  in  the  oceans,  whether
from stream runoff or dissolving directly from the sea
floor.  Today,  new  minerals  are  forming  on  the  sea
floor  at  the  same  rate  as  dissolved  materials  are
added.  Thus,  the  salt  content  of  the  ocean  is  in  a
steady  state,   meaning  that  it  is  not  increasing  or
decreasing.

Interestingly, these questions can also be answered
by studying the proportion of water vapor to chloride
ion, Cl+, in ancient marine rocks. Chloride ion is im-
portant  because  it  forms  part  of  the  most  common
salts  in  the  ocean  (for  example,  sodium  chloride,
potassium  chloride,  and  magnesium  chloride).  Also,
chloride ion is produced by outgassing, like the water
vapor that formed the oceans. Currently, there is no
indication that the ratio of water vapor to chloride ion
has fluctuated throughout geologic time, so it can be
reasonably  concluded  that  the  oceans   salinity  has
been relatively constant through time.

Originally, Earth had no oceans. The oceans 
(and atmosphere) came from inside Earth as a 
result of outgassing and were present by 
at least 4 billion years ago.

changed. This is because the high carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide content in the
early  atmosphere  would  have  created  a  very  acidic  rain, capable  of  dissolving
greater amounts of minerals in the crust than occurs today. In addition, volcanic
gases  such  as  chlorine  became  dissolved  in  the  atmosphere. As  rain  fell  and
washed  to  the  ocean, it  carried  some  of  these  dissolved  compounds, which
accumulated in the newly forming oceans.10 Eventually, a balance between inputs
and  outputs  was  reached, producing  an  ocean  with  a  chemical  composition
similar to today s oceans. Further aspects of the oceans  salinity are explored in
Chapter 5, Water and Seawater.

1.6 Did Life Begin in the Oceans?
The  fundamental  question  of  how  life  began  on  Earth  has  puzzled  humankind
since ancient times and has recently received a great amount of scientific study.
The evidence required to understand our planet s prebiotic environment and the
events that led to first living systems is scant and difficult to decipher. Still, the in-
ventory of current views on life s origin reveals a broad assortment of opposing
positions. One  recent  hypothesis  is  that  the  organic  building  blocks  of  life  may
have arrived embedded in meteors, comets, or cosmic dust. Alternatively, life may
have  originated  around  hydrothermal  vents hot  springs on  the  deep-ocean
floor. Yet  another  idea  is  that  life  originated  in  certain  minerals  that  acted  as
chemical catalysts within rocks deep below Earth s surface.

According to the fossil record on Earth, the earliest known life forms were prim-
itive bacteria that lived in sea floor rocks about 3.5 billion years ago. Unfortunately,
Earth s geologic record for these early times is so sparse and the rocks so deformed
by Earth processes that the rocks no longer reveal life s precursor molecules. In addi-
tion, there is no direct evidence of Earth s environmental conditions (such as its tem-
perature, ocean acidity, or the exact composition of the atmosphere) at the time of
life s origin. Still, it is clear that the basic building blocks for the development of life
were  available  from  materials  already  present  on  the  early  Earth. And  the  oceans
were the most likely place for these materials to interact and produce life.

The Importance of Oxygen to Life
Oxygen, which comprises almost 21% of Earth s present atmosphere, is essential
to human life for two reasons. First, our bodies need oxygen to  burn (oxidize)
food, releasing energy to our cells. Second, oxygen in the upper atmosphere in the
form of ozone (ozone * to smell11) protects the surface of Earth from most of the
Sun s  harmful  ultraviolet  radiation  (which  is  why  the  atmospheric  ozone  hole
over Antarctica has generated such concern).

Evidence  suggests  that  Earth s  early  atmosphere  (the  product  of  outgassing)
was different from Earth s initial hydrogen helium atmosphere and different from
the  mostly  nitrogen oxygen  atmosphere  of  today. The  early  atmosphere  probably
contained large percentages of water vapor and carbon dioxide and smaller percent-
ages of hydrogen, methane, and ammonia but very little free oxygen (oxygen that is
not  chemically  bound  to  other  atoms). Why  was  there  so  little  free  oxygen  in  the
early atmosphere? Oxygen may well have been outgassed, but oxygen and iron have
a strong affinity for each other.12 As a result, iron in Earth s early crust would have
reacted with the outgassed oxygen immediately, removing it from the atmosphere.

Without  oxygen  in  Earth s  early  atmosphere, moreover, there  would  have
been no ozone layer to block most of the Sun s ultraviolet radiation. The lack of a

most important developmental milestones.

Stanley Miller s Experiment
In 1952, a 22-year-old graduate student of chemist Harold Urey at the University
of Chicago named Stanley Miller (Figure 1.19b) conducted a laboratory experi-
ment that had profound implications about the development of life on Earth. In
Miller s experiment, he exposed a mixture of carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia,
hydrogen, and  water  (the  components  of  the  early  atmosphere  and  ocean)  to
ultraviolet  light  (from  the  Sun)  and  an  electrical  spark  (to  imitate  lightning)
(Figure  1.19a). By  the  end  of  the  first  day, the  mixture  turned  pink  and  after  a
week it was a deep, muddy brown, indicating the formation of a large assortment
of  organic  molecules  including  amino  acids, which  are  the  basic  components  of
life, and other biologically significant compounds.

Miller s now-famous laboratory experiment of a simulated primitive Earth in

a  bottle which  has  been  duplicated  and  confirmed  numerous  times  since
demonstrated that vast amounts of organic molecules could have been produced
in Earth s early oceans, often called a  prebiotic soup. This  prebiotic soup, per-
haps spiced by extraterrestrial molecules aboard comets, meteorites, or interplan-
etary  dust, was  fueled  by  raw  materials  from  volcanoes, certain  minerals  in  sea
floor  rocks, and  undersea  hydrothermal  vents. On  the  early  Earth, the  mixture
was energized by lightning, cosmic rays, and the planet s own internal heat, and is
thought to have created life s precursor molecules about 4 billion years ago.

Exactly how these simple organic compounds in the  prebiotic soup assem-
bled themselves into more complex molecules
such as proteins and DNA and
then into the first living entities remains one of the most tantalizing questions in
science. Recent research suggests that with the vast array of organic compounds
available in the  prebiotic soup, several kinds of chemical reactions led to increas-
ingly more elaborate molecular complexes. Among these complexes, some began
to carry out functions associated with the basic molecules of life. As the products
of one generation became the building blocks for another, complex molecules, or
polymers, emerged over many generations that could store and transfer informa-
tion. Such genetic polymers ultimately became encapsulated within cell-like mem-
branes  that  were  also  present  in  Earth s  primitive  broth. The  resulting  cell-like
complexes thereby housed self-replicating molecules capable of multiplying and

Earth. However, Ive heard that the oceans came
from outer space as icy comets. Which one is true?

Comets, being about half water, were once widely held
to  be  the  source  of  Earth s  oceans.  During  Earth s
early development, space debris left over from the ori-
gin of the solar system bombarded the young planet,
and there could have been plenty of water supplied to
Earth.  However,  spectral  analyses  of  the  chemical
composition of three comets Halley, Hyakutake, and
Hale-Bopp during  near-Earth  passes  they  made  in
1986, 1996, and 1997, respectively, revealed a cru-
cial  chemical  difference  between  the  hydrogen  in
comet  ice  and  that  in  Earth s  water.  If  comets  sup-
plied  large  quantities  of  water  to  Earth,  much  of
Earth s water would still exhibit the telltale type of hy-
drogen  identified  in  comets.  Instead,  this  type  of  hy-
drogen  is  exceedingly  rare  in  water  on  Earth.
Assuming  that  the  compositions  of  these  three
comets  are  representative  of  all  comets,  it  seems
unlikely that comets supplied much water to Earth.

THE VOYAGE OF HMS BEAGLE: HOW IT SHAPED CHARLES DARWIN S THINKING
ABOUT THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION

Nothing in biology makes sense
except in the light of evolution.

Geneticist Theodosius
Dobzhansky (1973)

In the early 19th century, the English nat-
uralist  Charles  Darwin (1809 1882)  pro-
posed  the  theory  of  evolution by  natural
selection, which  explains  how  biologic
processes operating in nature produce the
many  diverse  and  remarkable  species  on
Earth. Many  of  the  observations  upon
which  he  based  the  theory  were  made
aboard the vessel HMS Beagle during its
famous expedition from 1831 to 1836 that
circumnavigated the globe (Figure 1F).

Darwin  became  interested  in  natural
history  during  his  student  days  at
Cambridge  University, where  he  was
studying to become a minister. Because of
the  influence  of  John  Henslow, a  profes-
sor of botany, he was selected to serve as
an unpaid naturalist on the HMS Beagle.
The  Beagle
from  Devonport,
England, on  December  27, 1831, under
the  command  of  Captain  Robert  Fitzroy.
The  major  objective  of  the  voyage  was
to complete  a  survey  of  the  coast  of
Patagonia  (Argentina)  and  Tierra  del
Fuego  and 
chronometric

to  make 

sailed 

measurements. The  voyage  allowed  the
22-year- old Darwin who was often sea-
sick to  disembark  at  various  locations
and study  local plants and  animals. What
particularly influenced his thinking about
evolution were the discovery of fossils in
South  America  and  the  identification  of
14 closely related species of finches in the
Galápagos  Islands. These  finches  differ
greatly in the configuration of their beaks
(Figure 1F, left  inset), which are suited to
their  diverse  feeding  habitats. After  his
return  to  England, he  noted  the  adapta-
tions  of  finches  and  other  organisms  liv-
ing  in  different  habitats  and  concluded
that  all  organisms  change  slowly  over
time as a product of their environment.

Darwin recognized the similarities be-
tween  birds  and  mammals  and  reasoned
that they must have evolved from reptiles.
Patiently  making  observations  over  many
years, he  also  noted  the  similar  skeletal
framework of species such as bats, horses,
giraffes, elephants, porpoises, and humans,
which led him to establish relationships be-
tween  various  groups. Darwin  suggested
that the differences between species were
the result of adaptation over time to differ-
ent environments and modes of existence.

In  1858, Darwin  hastily  published 
a  summary  of  his  ideas  about  natural

selection  because  fellow  naturalist  Alfred
Russel Wallace, working half a world away
in  what  is  now  Indonesia, had  independ-
ently  discovered  the  same  idea. A  year
later, Darwin  published  his  remarkable
masterwork  On  the  Origin  of  Species  by
Means  of  Natural  Selection (Figure  1F,
right inset), in which he provided extensive
and  compelling  evidence  that  all  living
beings
including humans have evolved
from  a  common  ancestor. At  the  time,
Darwin s  ideas  were  highly  controversial
because  they  stood  in  stark  conflict  with
what most people believed about the ori-
gin  of  humans. Darwin  also  produced
important  publications  on  subjects  as
diverse  as  barnacle  biology, carnivorous
plants, and the formation of coral reefs.

Over 150 years later, Darwin s theory
of evolution is still considered a landmark
influence  in  the  scientific  understanding
of the underlying biologic processes oper-
ating  in  nature. Evolution  is  now  as  well
established  by  argument  and  evidence
and reproducible experiment as any truth
in science and as well established a theory
as any in the history of science. Discoveries
made  since  Darwin s  time
including
genetics  and  the  structure  of  DNA
confirm  how  the  process  of  evolution
works. In  fact, most  of  Darwin s  ideas

Organic molecules were produced in a simulation of
Earth s early atmosphere and ocean, suggesting
that life most likely originated in the oceans.

hence evolving genetic information. Many specialists consider this emergence of
genetic replication to be the true origin of life.

Evolution and Natural Selection
Every living organism that inhabits Earth today is the result of evolution by the
process  of  natural  selection that  has  been  occurring  since  life  first  existed  on
Earth. The theory of evolution states that groups of organisms adapt and change
with the passage of time, causing descendants to differ morphologically and phys-
iologically from their ancestors (Box 1.3). Certain advantageous traits are natu-
rally  selected  and  passed  on  from  one  generation  to  the  next. Evolution  is  the
process  by  which  various  species (species * a  kind)  have  been  able  to  inhabit
increasingly numerous environments on Earth.

As we shall see, when species adapt to Earth s various environments, they can
also modify the environments in which they live. This modification can be local-
ized or nearly global in scale. For example, when plants emerged from the oceans

have  been  so  thoroughly  accepted  by
scientists that they are now the underpin-
nings  of  the  modern  study  of  biology.
That s  why  the  name  Darwin is  synony-

mous  with  evolution. In  2009, to  com-
memorate Darwin s birth and his accom-
plishments, the  Church  of  England  even

ogy for misunderstanding you and, by get-
ting our first reaction wrong, encouraging
others to misunderstand you still.

and inhabited the land, they changed Earth from a harsh and bleak landscape as
barren as the Moon to one that is green and lush.

Plants and Animals Evolve
The  very  earliest  forms  of  life  were  probably  heterotrophs (hetero * different,
trophos * nourishment). Heterotrophs  require  an  external  food  supply, which
was  abundantly  available  in  the  form  of  nonliving  organic  matter  in  the  ocean
around  them. Autotrophs (auto * self, trophos * nourishment), which  can
manufacture their own food supply, evolved later. The first autotrophs were prob-
ably similar to present-day anaerobic (an * without, aero * air) bacteria, which
live without atmospheric oxygen. They may have been able to derive energy from
inorganic  compounds  at  deep-water  hydrothermal  vents  using  a  process  called
chemosynthesis (chemo * chemistry, syn * with, thesis * an arranging).13 In fact,

13More details about chemosynthesis are discussed in Chapter 15, Animals of the Benthic Environment.

the recent detection of microbes deep within the ocean crust as well as the discov-
ery of 3.2-billion-year-old microfossils of bacteria from deep-water marine rocks
support the idea of life s origin on the deep-ocean floor in the absence of light.

PHOTOSYNTHESIS  AND  RESPIRATION Eventually, more  complex  single-celled
autotrophs evolved. They developed a green pigment called chlorophyll (chloro *
green, phyll * leaf), which captures the Sun s energy through cellular photosynthesis
(photo * light, syn * with, thesis * an arranging). In photosynthesis (Figure 1.20,
top), plant  cells  capture  light  energy  and  store  it  as  sugars. In  cellular  respiration
(respirare * to  breathe)  (Figure  1.20, middle), sugars  are  oxidized  with  oxygen,
releasing  stored  energy  that  is  used  as  a  source  of  energy  by  the  organism  that
consumes the plant to carry on various life processes.

Not  only  are  photosynthesis  and  respiration  chemically  opposite  processes,
they are also complementary because the products of photosynthesis (sugars and
oxygen)  are  used  during respiration and the  products  of respiration  (water  and
carbon dioxide) are used in photosynthesis (Figure 1.20, bottom). Thus, autotrophs
(algae and plants) and heterotrophs (most bacteria and animals) have developed
a mutual need for each other.

The  oldest  fossilized  remains  of  organisms  are  primitive  photosynthetic
bacteria recovered from rocks formed on the sea floor about 3.5 billion years ago.
However, the  oldest  rocks  containing  iron  oxide  (rust)
an  indicator  of  an
oxygen-rich atmosphere did not appear until about 2.4 billion years ago. Thus,
photosynthetic  organisms  needed  about  a  billion  years  to  develop  and  begin
producing  abundant  free  oxygen  in  the  atmosphere. At  the  same  time, when  a
large amount of oxygen-rich (ferric) iron sank to the base of the mantle, it may
have  been  heated  by  the  core, risen  as  a  plume  to  the  ocean  floor, and  begun
releasing large amounts of oxygen through outgassing about 2.5 billion years ago.

THE GREAT OXIDATION EVENT/OXYGEN CRISIS Based on the chemical makeup
of  certain  rocks, Earth s  atmosphere  became  oxygen  rich  about  2.45  billion  years
ago called  the  great  oxidation  event and  fundamentally  changed  Earth s  ability
to support life. Particularly for anaerobic bacteria, which had grown successfully in
an  oxygen-free  world, all  this  oxygen  was  nothing  short  of  a  catastrophe! This  is
because  the  increased  atmospheric  oxygen  caused  the  ozone  concentration  in  the
upper  atmosphere  to  build  up, thereby  shielding  Earth s  surface  from  ultraviolet

FIGURE 1.21 The effect of plants on

tosynthetic cells (inset) became established in
the ocean, Earth s atmosphere was enriched in
oxygen and depleted of carbon dioxide. As 
organisms died and accumulated on the ocean
floor, some of their remains were converted to
oil and gas. The same process occurred on
land, sometimes producing coal.

radiation and  effectively  eliminating  anaerobic  bacteria s  food  supply  of  organic
molecules  (recall  that  Stanley  Miller s  experiment  created  organic  molecules  but
needed ultraviolet light). In addition, oxygen (particularly in the presence of light) is
highly reactive with organic matter. When anaerobic bacteria are exposed to oxygen
and light, they are killed instantaneously. By 1.8 billion years ago, the atmosphere s
oxygen  content  had  increased  to  such  a  high  level  that  it  began  causing  the
extinction of many anaerobic organisms. Nonetheless, descendants of such bacteria
survive  on  Earth  today  in  isolated  microenvironments  that  are  dark  and  free  of
oxygen, such as deep in soil or rocks, in garbage, and inside other organisms.

Although oxygen is very reactive with organic matter and can even be toxic, it
also  yields  nearly  20  times  more  energy  than  anaerobic  respiration a  fact  that
some organisms exploited. For example, blue-green algae, which are also known as
cyanobacteria (kuanos * dark blue), adapted to and thrived in this new oxygen-
rich environment. In doing so, they altered the composition of the atmosphere.

CHANGES  TO  EARTH S  ATMOSPHERE Remarkably,
the  development  and
successful  evolution  of  photosynthetic  organisms  are  greatly  responsible  for  the
world as we know it today (Figure 1.21). By the trillions, these microscopic organisms
transformed  the  planet  by  capturing  the  energy  of  the  Sun  to  make  food  and
releasing  oxygen  as  a  waste  product. By  this  process, these  organisms  reduced  the
high amount of carbon dioxide in the early atmosphere and gradually replaced it with
free oxygen. This created a third and final atmosphere on Earth: one that is oxygen
rich (about 21% today). Little by little, these tiny organisms turned the atmosphere
into breathable air, opening the way to the diversity of life that followed.

The graph in Figure 1.22 shows how the concentration of atmospheric oxygen
has varied during the past 600 million years. When atmospheric oxygen concen-
trations are high, organisms thrive and rapid speciation occurs. At such times in
the past, insects grew to gargantuan proportions, reptiles took to the air, and the
forerunners  of  mammals  developed  a  warm-blooded  metabolism. More  oxygen
was dissolved in the oceans, too, and so marine biodiversity increased. At other
times  when  atmospheric  oxygen  concentrations  fell  precipitously, biodiversity

was smothered. In fact, some of the planet s worst mass extinctions are associated
with sudden drops in atmospheric oxygen.

The  remains  of  ancient  plants  and  animals  buried  in  oxygen-free  environ-
ments have become the oil, natural gas, and coal deposits of today. These deposits,
which are called fossil fuels, provide more than 90% of the energy humans con-
sume to power modern society. In essence, humans depend not only on the food
energy stored in today s plants but also on the energy stored in plants during the
geologic past

in the form of fossil fuels.

Because of increased burning of fossil fuels for home heating, industry, power
generation, and transportation during the industrial age, the atmospheric concen-
tration of carbon dioxide and other gases that help warm the atmosphere has in-
creased, too. Scientists  predict  that  these  human  emissions  will  increase  global
warming and cause serious environmental problems in the not-too-distant future.
This phenomenon, referred to as the atmosphere s enhanced greenhouse effect, is
discussed in Chapter 16, The Oceans and Climate Change.

1.7 How Old Is Earth?
How can Earth scientists tell how old a rock is? It can be a difficult task to tell if a
rock is thousands, millions, or even billions of years old unless the rock contains
telltale fossils. Fortunately, Earth scientists can determine how old most rocks are
by  using  the  radioactive  materials  contained  within  rocks. In  essence, this  tech-
nique involves reading a rock s internal  rock clock.

Radiometric Age Dating
Most rocks on Earth (as well as those from outer space) contain small amounts of
radioactive materials such as uranium, thorium, and potassium. These radioactive
materials  spontaneously  break  apart  or  decay  into  atoms  of  other  elements.
Radioactive  materials  have  a  characteristic  half-life, which  is  the  time  required
for one-half of the atoms in a sample to decay to other atoms. The older the rock
is, the  more  radioactive  material  will  have  been  converted  to  decay  product.
Analytical instruments can accurately measure the amount of radioactive mate-
rial and the amount of resulting decay product in rocks. By comparing these two
quantities, the  age  of  the  rock  can  thus  be  determined. Such  dating  is  referred
to as radiometric (radio * radioactivity, metri * measure) age dating and is an ex-
tremely powerful tool for determining the age of rocks.

Figure 1.23 shows an example of how radiometric age dating works. It shows
how uranium 235 decays into lead 207 at a rate of which one-half of the atoms
turn  into  lead  every  704  million  years. By  counting  the  number  of  each  type  of
atom in a rock sample, one can tell how long it has been decaying (as long as the
sample  does  not  gain  or  lose  atoms). Using  uranium  and  other  radioactive

Earth is 4.6 billion years old.

between  geologic  periods  were  based  on  major  extinction  episodes  as  recorded
in the  fossil  record. As  radiometric  age  dates  became  available, they  were  also
included on the geologic time scale. The oldest-known rocks on Earth, for exam-
ple, are  about  4.3  billion  years  old, and  the  oldest-known  crystals  within  rocks
have been dated at up to 4.4 billion years old.14 In all, the time scale indicates that
Earth is 4.6 billion years old, but few rocks survived its molten youth, a time when
Earth was being bombarded by meteorites.

14Recent research suggests that crystals this old imply that significant continental crust must have
formed on Earth early on, perhaps by nearly 4.5 billion years ago.

Chapter in Review

Water covers 70.8% of Earth s surface. The world ocean is a single inter-
connected body of water, which is large in size and volume. It can be divided
into four principal oceans (the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic Oceans),
plus an additional ocean (the Southern or Antarctic Ocean). Even though
there is a technical distinction between a sea and an ocean, the two terms
are used interchangeably. In comparing the oceans to the continents, it is
apparent that the average land surface does not rise very far above sea level
and that there is not a mountain on Earth that is as tall as the ocean is deep.

In the Pacific, people who populated the Pacific Islands may have been
the first great navigators. In the Western world, the Phoenicians were mak-
ing  remarkable  voyages  as  well. Later  the  Greeks, Romans, and  Arabs
made  significant  contributions  and  advanced  oceanographic  knowledge.
During  the  Middle  Ages, the  Vikings colonized  Iceland  and  Greenland
and made voyages to North America.

The Age of Discovery in Europe renewed the Western world s interest
in  exploring  the  unknown. It  began  with  the  voyage  of  Christopher
Columbus in  1492  and  ended  in  1522  with  the  first  circumnavigation  of
Earth by a voyage initiated by Ferdinand Magellan. Captain James Cook
was one of the first to explore the ocean for scientific purposes.

The scientific method is used to understand the occurrence of physical
events or phenomena and can be stated as science supports explanation of
the natural world that best explains all available observations. Steps in the
scientific  method  include  making  observations and  establishing  scientific
facts; forming  one  or  more  hypotheses (a  tentative, testable  statement
about  the  general  nature  of  the  phenomena  observed); extensive  testing
and  modification  of  hypotheses; and, finally, developing  a  theory (a  well-
substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can in-
corporate  facts, laws, logical  inferences, and  tested  hypotheses). Science
never arrives at the absolute  truth ; rather, science arrives at what is prob-
ably true based on the available observations and can continually change
because of new observations.

Our solar system, consisting of the Sun and eight major planets, probably
formed from a huge cloud of gas and space dust called a nebula. According
to  the  nebular  hypothesis, the  nebular  matter  contracted  to  form  the
Sun, and the planets were formed from eddies of material that remained.
The  Sun, composed  of  hydrogen  and  helium, was  massive  enough  and

concentrated enough to emit large amounts of energy from fusion. The Sun
also emitted ionized particles that swept away any nebular gas that remained
from the formation of the planets and their satellites.

Protoearth, more  massive  and  larger  than  Earth  today, was  molten  and
homogenous. The  initial  atmosphere, composed  mostly  of  hydrogen  and
helium, was later driven off into space by intense solar radiation. Protoearth
began  a  period  of  rearrangement  called  density  stratification and  formed  a
layered internal structure based on density, resulting in the development of the
crust, mantle, and core. Studies of Earth s internal structure indicate that brit-
tle plates of the lithosphere are riding on a plastic, high-viscosity asthenosphere.
Near the surface, the lithosphere is composed of continental and oceanic crust.
Continental crust consists mostly of granite and oceanic crust consists mostly
of basalt. Continental crust is lower in density, lighter in color, and thicker than
oceanic crust. Both types float isostatically on the denser mantle below.

Outgassing produced an early atmosphere rich in water vapor and car-
bon dioxide. Once Earth s surface cooled sufficiently, the water vapor con-
densed  and  accumulated  to  give  Earth  its  oceans. Rainfall  on  the  surface
dissolved compounds that, when carried to the ocean, made it salty.

Life is thought to have begun in the oceans. Stanley Miller s experiment
showed  that  ultraviolet  radiation  from  the  Sun  and  hydrogen, carbon
dioxide, methane, ammonia, and inorganic molecules from the oceans may
have combined to produce organic molecules such as amino acids. Certain
combinations  of  these  molecules  eventually  produced  heterotrophic  or-
ganisms (which cannot make their own food) that were probably similar
to present-day anaerobic bacteria. Eventually, autotrophs evolved that had
the  ability  to  make  their  own  food  through  chemosynthesis. Later, some
cells  developed  chlorophyll, which  made  photosynthesis possible  and  led
to the development of plants.

Photosynthetic organisms altered the environment by extracting carbon
dioxide  from  the  atmosphere  and  also  by  releasing  free  oxygen, thereby
creating today s oxygen-rich atmosphere. Eventually, both plants and ani-
mals evolved into forms that could survive on land.

Radiometric  age  dating is  used  to  determine  the  age  of  most  rocks.
Information  from  extinctions  of  organisms  and  from  age  dating  rocks
comprises  the  geologic  time  scale, which  indicates  that  Earth  has  experi-
enced a long history of changes since its origin 4.6 billion years ago.

a Multiple compelling lines of 

evidence support the theory 
of plate tectonics, which
states that Earth is
composed of a patchwork
of thin, rigid plates that
move with respect to one
another.

a Three different plate 

boundaries exist: 
(1) divergent boundaries,
where plates are moving
apart, (2) convergent
boundaries, where plates
are colliding, and 
(3) transform boundaries,
where plates are sliding
past one another.

a The detection of plate 

motion by satellites 
confirms that plates are
currently moving; the 
positions of the continents
and oceans have changed
in the past and will likely
continue to change in 
the future.

It is just as if we were to refit the torn pieces of a newspaper by matching
their edges and then check whether the lines of print run smoothly across.
If they do, there is nothing left but to conclude that the pieces were in fact
joined in this way.

Alfred Wegener,
The Origins of Continents and Oceans (1929)

PLATE TECTONICS AND THE
OCEAN FLOOR

Each year at various locations around the globe, several thousand earthquakes and dozens of volcanic
eruptions occur, both of which indicate how remarkably dynamic our planet is. These events have
occurred throughout history, constantly changing the surface of our planet, yet only a few decades ago
most scientists believed the continents were stationary over geologic time. Since that time, a bold new
theory has been advanced that helps explain surface features and phenomena on Earth, including:

The worldwide locations of volcanoes, faults, earthquakes, and mountain building
Why mountains on Earth haven t been eroded away
The origin of most landforms and ocean floor features
How the continents and ocean floor formed and why they are different
The continuing development of Earth s surface
The distribution of past and present life on Earth

This revolutionary new theory is called plate tectonics (plate * plates of the lithosphere; tekton * to
build), or  the new global geology. According to the theory of plate tectonics, the outermost portion of
Earth is composed of a patchwork of thin, rigid plates1 that move horizontally with respect to one
another, like icebergs floating on water. As a result, the continents are mobile and move about on
Earth s surface, controlled by forces deep within Earth.

The interaction of these plates as they move builds features of Earth s crust (such as mountain belts,
volcanoes, and  ocean  basins). For  example, the  tallest  mountain  range  on  Earth  is  the  Himalaya
Mountains that extend through India, Nepal, and Bhutan. This mountain range contains rocks that were
deposited millions of years ago in a shallow sea, providing testimony of the power and persistence of
plate tectonic activity.

In this chapter, we ll examine the early ideas about the movement of plates, the evidence for those
ideas, and how they led to the theory of plate tectonics.Then we ll explore features of plate boundaries
and some applications of plate tectonics, including what our planet may look like in the future.

2.1 What Evidence Supports Continental Drift?
Alfred Wegener (Figure 2.1), a German meteorologist and geophysicist, was the first to advance the
idea of mobile continents in 1912. He envisioned that the continents were slowly drifting across the
globe and called his idea continental drift. Let s examine the evidence that Wegener compiled that
led him to formulate the idea of drifting continents.

1These thin, rigid plates are pieces of the lithosphere that comprise Earth s outermost portion and contain oceanic and/or
continental crust, as described in Chapter 1.

How long has plate tectonics been operating on
Earth? Will it ever stop?

It s difficult to say with certainty how long plate tecton-
ics has been operating because our planet has been so
dynamic since its early history, regularly recycling most
of Earth s crust. However, recently discovered ancient
volcanic rock sequences uplifted onto Greenland show
telltale characteristics of tectonic activity and suggest
that plate tectonics has been operating for at least the
last 3.8 billion years of Earth history.

Plate motion has typically been assumed to be an
active  and  continuous  process,  with  new  sea floor
constantly  being  formed  while  old  sea  floor  is  being
destroyed. Recent research, however, suggests that
plates  may  move  more  actively  at  times,  then  slow
down  or  even  stop,  and  then  start  up  again.  The
reasons for this intermittent plate motion appear to
be  related  to  plate  distribution  and  changes  in  the
amount of heat released from Earth.

Looking  into  the  future,  the  forces  that  drive
plates will likely decrease until plates no longer move.
This is because plate tectonic processes are powered
by heat released from within Earth (which is of a finite
amount).  The  erosional  work  of  water,  however,  will
continue to erode Earth s features. What a different
world  it  will be  then an  Earth with  no earthquakes,
no volcanoes, and no mountains. Flatness will prevail!

Fit of the Continents
The idea that continents particularly South America and Africa fit together like
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle originated with the development of reasonably accurate
world maps. As far back as 1620, Sir Francis Bacon wrote about how the continents
appeared to fit together. However, little significance was given to this idea until
1912, when Wegener used the shapes of matching shorelines on different continents
as a supporting piece of evidence for continental drift.

Wegener suggested that during the geologic past, the continents collided to
form  a  large  landmass, which  he  named  Pangaea (pan * all, gaea * Earth)
(Figure 2.2). Further, a huge ocean, called Panthalassa (pan * all, thalassa * sea)
surrounded Pangaea. Panthalassa included several smaller seas, including the
Tethys (Tethys * a Greek sea goddess) Sea. Wegener s evidence indicated that as
Pangaea  began  to  split  apart, the  various  continental  masses  started  to  drift
toward their present geographic positions.

Wegener s attempt at matching shorelines revealed considerable areas of crustal
overlap and large gaps. Some of the differences could be explained by material
deposited by rivers or eroded from coastlines.What Wegener didn t know at the time
was that the shallow parts of the ocean floor close to shore are underlain by materi-
als similar to those beneath continents. In the early 1960s, Sir Edward Bullard and
two associates used a computer program to fit the continents together (Figure 2.3).
Instead of using the shorelines of the continents as Wegener had done, Bullard
achieved the best fit (for example, with minimal overlaps or gaps) by using a depth of
2000 meters (6560 feet) below sea level. This depth corresponds to halfway between
the shoreline and the deep-ocean basins; as such, it represents the true edge of the
continents. By using this depth, the continents fit together remarkably well.

Matching Sequences of Rocks and Mountain Chains
If the continents were once together, as Wegener had hypothesized, then evidence
should  appear  in  rock  sequences  that  were  originally  continuous  but  are  now
separated by large distances. To test the idea of drifting continents, geologists began
comparing the rocks along the edges of continents with rocks
found in  adjacent positions  on  matching continents. They
wanted to see if the rocks had similar types, ages, and struc-
tural styles (the type and degree of deformation). In some
areas younger rocks had been deposited during the millions
of years since the continents separated, covering the rocks
that held the key to the past history of the continents. In other
areas, the rocks had been eroded away. Nevertheless, in many
other areas, the key rocks were present.

Moreover, these studies showed that many rock sequen-
ces from one continent were identical to rock sequences on
an adjacent continent although the two were separated by
an  ocean. In  addition, mountain  ranges  that  terminated
abruptly at the edge of a continent continued on another con-
tinent across an ocean basin, with identical rock sequences,
ages, and structural styles. Figure 2.4 shows, for example, how
similar  rocks  from  the  Appalachian  Mountains  in  North
America match up with identical rocks from the British Isles
and the Caledonian Mountains in Europe.

Wegener noted the similarities in rock sequences on
both sides of the Atlantic and used the information as a
supporting  piece  of  evidence  for  continental  drift. He
suggested that mountains such as those seen on opposite
sides  of  the  Atlantic  formed  during  the  collision  when
Pangaea was formed. Later, when the continents split apart,

FIGURE 2.1 Alfred Wegener, circa 1912 1913. Alfred Wegener (1880 1930),
shown here in his research station in Greenland, was one of the first scientists to
suggest that continents are mobile.

once-continuous  mountain  ranges  were  separated. Confirmation  of  this  idea
exists in a similar match with mountains extending from South America through
Antarctica and across Australia.

Glacial Ages and Other Climate Evidence
Wegener also noticed the occurrence of past glacial activity in areas now tropical
and suggested that it, too, provided supporting evidence for drifting continents.
Currently, the only places in the world where thick continental ice sheets occur are
in the polar regions of Greenland and Antarctica. However, evidence of ancient
glaciation is found in the lower latitude regions of South America, Africa, India,
and Australia.

These deposits, which have been dated at 300 million years old, indicate
one of two possibilities: (1) There was a worldwide ice age, and even tropical
areas were covered by thick ice, or (2) some continents that are now in tropical
areas were once located much closer to one of the poles. It is unlikely that
the entire  world  was  covered  by  ice  300  million  years  ago  because  coal
deposits from  the  same  geologic  age  now  present  in  North  America  and
Europe originated as vast semitropical swamps. Thus, a reasonable conclusion
is that some of the continents must have been closer to the poles than they are
today.

Another type of glacial evidence indicates that certain continents have
moved  from  more  polar  regions  during  the  past  300  million  years. When
glaciers  flow, they  move  and  abrade  the  underlying  rocks, leaving  grooves
that indicate the direction of flow. The arrows in Figure 2.5a show how the
glaciers would have flowed away from the South Pole on Pangaea 300 million
years ago. The direction of flow is consistent with the grooves found on many
continents  today  (Figure  2.5b), providing  additional  evidence  for  drifting
continents.

Many examples of plant and animal fossils indicate very different climates
than today. Two such examples are fossil palm trees in Arctic Spitsbergen and
coal deposits in Antarctica. Earth s past environments can be interpreted from
these rocks because plants and animals need specific environmental conditions
in which to live. Corals, for example, generally need seawater above 18 degrees
centigrade (°C) or 64 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) in order to survive. When fossil
corals  are  found  in  areas  that  are  cold  today, two  explanations  seem  most
plausible: (1) Worldwide climate has changed dramatically; or (2) the rocks have
moved from their original location.

Latitude (distance north or south of the equator), more than anything else,
determines climate. Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that Earth s axis
of rotation has changed significantly throughout its history, so the climate at
any particular latitude must not have changed significantly either. Thus, fossils
that come from climates that seem out of place today must have moved from
their original location through the movement of the continents as Wegener
proposed.

Distribution of Organisms
To add credibility to his argument for the existence of the supercontinent of
Pangaea, Wegener cited documented cases of several fossil organisms found
on different landmasses that could not have crossed the vast oceans presently
separating  the  continents. For  example, the  fossil  remains  of  Mesosaurus
(meso * middle, saurus * lizard), an extinct, presumably aquatic reptile that
lived about 250 million years ago, are located only in eastern South America
and western Africa (Figure 2.6). If Mesosaurus had been strong enough to swim
across an ocean, why aren t its remains more widely distributed?

Wegener s idea of continental drift provided an elegant solution to this
problem. He suggested that the continents were closer together in the geologic
past, so Mesosaurus didn t have to be a good swimmer to leave remains on two
different continents. Later, after Mesosaurus became extinct, the continents
moved to their  present-day  positions, and a  large ocean  now separates  the
once-connected  landmasses. Other  examples  of  similar  fossils  on  different
continents  include  those  of  plants, which  would  have  had  a  difficult  time
traversing a large ocean.

Before continental drift, several ideas were proposed to help explain the
curious pattern of these fossils, such as the existence of island stepping stones or
a  land  bridge. It  was  even  suggested  that  at  least  one  pair  of  land-dwelling
Mesosaurus survived the arduous journey across several thousand kilometers of
open ocean by rafting on floating logs. However, there is no evidence to support
the idea of island stepping stones or a land bridge and the idea of Mesosaurus
rafting across an ocean seems implausible.

Wegener also cited the distribution of present-day organisms as evidence to
support the concept of drifting continents. For example, modern organisms with
similar ancestries clearly had to evolve in isolation during the last few million
years. Most obvious of these are the Australian marsupials (such as the kangaroos,
koalas, and wombats), which have a distinct similarity to the marsupial opossums
found in the Americas.

Objections to the Continental 
Drift Model
Wegener first published his ideas in The Origins of
Continents and Oceans in 1915, but the book did not
attract much attention until it was translated into
English, French, Spanish, and Russian in 1924. From
that point until his death in 1930,2 his drift hypothe-
sis received much hostile criticism and sometimes
open  ridicule
from  the  scientific  community
because  of  the  mechanism  he  proposed  for  the
movement of the continents. Wegener suggested the
continents plowed through the ocean basins to reach
their  present-day  positions  and  that  the  leading
edges  of  the  continents  deformed  into  mountain
ridges because of the drag imposed by ocean rocks.
Further, the driving mechanism he proposed was a
combination  of  the  gravitational  attraction  of
Earth s equatorial bulge and tidal forces from the
Sun and Moon.

Scientists rejected the idea as too fantastic and
contrary  to  the  laws  of  physics. Debate  over  the
mechanism of drift concentrated on the long-term
behavior of the substrate and the forces that could
move continents laterally. Material strength calculations, for example, showed
that ocean rock was too strong for continental rock to plow through it. Further,
analysis of gravitational and tidal forces indicated that they were too small to
move the great continental landmasses. Even without an acceptable mechanism,
many geologists who studied rocks in South America and Africa accepted conti-
nental drift because it was consistent with the rock record. North American
geologists most of whom were unfamiliar with these Southern Hemisphere
rock sequences

remained highly skeptical.

As  compelling  as  his  evidence  may  seem  today, Wegener  was  unable  to
convince  the  scientific  community  as  a  whole  of  the  validity  of  his  ideas.
Although his hypothesis was correct in principle, it contained several incorrect
details, such as the driving mechanism for continental motion and how conti-
nents move across ocean basins. In order for any scientific viewpoint to gain
wide acceptance, it must explain all available observations and have supporting
evidence from a wide variety of scientific fields. This supporting evidence would
not come until more details of the nature of the ocean floor were revealed,
which, along with new technology that enabled scientists to determine the orig-
inal positions of rocks on Earth, provided additional observations in support of
drifting continents.

2.2 What Evidence Supports Plate

Tectonics?

Very little new information about Wegener s continental drift hypothesis was
introduced between the time of Wegener s death in 1930 and the early 1950s.
However, studies of the sea floor using sonar that were initiated during World
War II and continued after the war provided critical evidence in support of

2Wegener perished in 1930, during an expedition in Greenland while collecting data to help support
his idea of continental drift.

Alfred Wegener used a variety of interdisciplinary
information from land to support continental drift.
However, he did not have a suitable mechanism or
any information about the sea floor.

drifting  continents. In  addition, technology  unavailable  in Wegener s  time
enabled scientists to analyze the way rocks retained the signature of Earth s
magnetic field. These developments caused scientists to reexamine continental
drift and advance it into the more encompassing theory of plate tectonics.

3The properties of a magnetic field can be explored easily enough with a bar magnet and some iron
particles. Place the iron particles on a table and place a bar magnet nearby. Depending on the
strength of the magnet, you should get a pattern resembling that in Figure 2.7a.

or N for north and S for south) that cause magnetic objects to align parallel to
its magnetic field. In addition, notice in Figures 2.7b and 2.7c that Earth s geo-
graphic North Pole (the rotational axis) and Earth s magnetic north pole (mag-
netic north) do not coincide.

fire,
ROCKS  AFFECTED  BY  EARTH S  MAGNETIC  FIELD Igneous (igne
a mass) either
ous
underground  or  after  volcanic  eruptions  at  the  surface  that  produce  lava
(lavare
to wash). Nearly all igneous rocks contain magnetite, a naturally
magnetic iron mineral. Particles of magnetite in magma align themselves with
Earth s magnetic field because magma and lava are fluid. Once molten material
cools  and  solidifies, internal  magnetite  particles  are  frozen  into  position,
thereby recording the angle of Earth s magnetic field at that place and time. In
essence, grains  of  magnetite  serve  as  tiny  compass  needles  that  record  the
strength and orientation of Earth s magnetic field. Unless the rock is heated to
the temperature where magnetite grains are again mobile, these magnetite
grains contain information about the magnetic field where the rock originated,
regardless of where the rock subsequently moves.

Magnetite  is  also  deposited  in  sediments. As  long  as  the  sediment  is
surrounded by water, the magnetite particles can align themselves with Earth s
magnetic  field. After  sediment  is  buried  and  solidifies  into  sedimentary
(sedimentum settling) rock, the particles are no longer able to realign them-
selves if they are subsequently moved. Thus, magnetite grains in sedimentary
rocks  also  contain  information  about  the  magnetic  field  where  the  rock
originated. Although other rock types have been used successfully to reveal
information about Earth s ancient magnetic field, the most reliable ones are
igneous rocks that have high concentrations of magnetite such as basalt, which
is the rock type that comprises oceanic crust.

PALEOMAGNETISM The  study  of  Earth s  ancient  magnetic  field  is  called
paleomagnetism (paleo
ancient). The scientists who study paleomagnetism
analyze magnetite particles in rocks to determine not only their north south
direction but also their angle relative to Earth s surface. The degree to which a
magnetite  particle  points  into  Earth  is  called  its  magnetic  dip, or  magnetic
inclination.

Magnetic  dip  is  directly  related  to  latitude. Figure  2.7b shows  that  a  dip
needle does not dip at all at Earth s magnetic equator. Instead, the needle lies
horizontal to Earth s surface. At Earth s magnetic north pole, however, a dip
needle points straight into the surface. A dip needle at Earth s magnetic south
pole is also vertical to the surface, but it points out instead of in. Thus, magnetic
dip increases with increasing latitude, from 0 degrees at the magnetic equator to
90 degrees at the magnetic poles. Because magnetic dip is retained in magnetically
oriented rocks, measuring the dip angle reveals the latitude at which the rock ini-
tially formed. Done with care, paleomagnetism is an extremely powerful tool for
interpreting where rocks first formed. Based on paleomagnetic studies, convincing
arguments could finally be made that the continents had drifted relative to one
another.

APPARENT  POLAR  WANDERING When magnetic dip data for rocks on the
continents were used to determine the apparent position of the magnetic north
pole over time, it appeared that the magnetic pole was wandering or moving
through time. For example, Figure 2.8a shows the magnetic polar wandering
curves for North America and Eurasia. Both curves have a similar shape but,
for all rocks older than about 70 million years, the pole determined from North

What causes Earths magnetic field?

Studies of Earth s magnetic field and research in the
field  of  magnetodynamics  suggest  that  convective
movement  of  fluids  in  Earth s  liquid  iron nickel  outer
core is the cause of Earth s magnetic field. The most
widely accepted view is that Earth s magnetic field is
created by strong electrical currents generated by a
dynamo  process  resulting  from  the  flow  of  molten
iron in Earth s outer core. Earth s magnetic field is so
complex  that  it  has  only  recently  been  successfully
modeled  using  some  of  the  world s  most  powerful
computers.  Interestingly,  the  Sun  and  most  other
planets  (and  even  some  planets  moons) also exhibit
magnetic fields.

What changes to Earths environment would occur
when the magnetic poles reverse?

During  a  reversal,  compasses  would  likely  show
incorrect  directions,  and  people  could  have  difficulty
navigating. The same goes for those fish, birds, and
mammals that sense the magnetic field during migra-
tions  (see  Box  2.1).  The  decrease  in  strength  also
reduces  the  protection  that  the  magnetic  field
provides  against  cosmic  rays  and  particles  coming
from the Sun, and this could disrupt low-Earth-orbiting
satellites as well as some communication and power
grid systems. Also, the aurora, which is a phenome-
non of light in the sky known as the Northern Lights,
might be visible at much lower latitudes. On the bright
side,  we  know  that  life  on  Earth  has  successfully
survived  previous  magnetic  reversals,  so  reversals
might  not  be  as  dangerous  as  they  are  sometimes
portrayed  (such  as  in  the  2003  science  fiction  film
The Core, which is full of scientific inaccuracies).

American rocks lies to the west of that determined from Eurasian rocks. There
can  be  only  one  north  magnetic  pole  at  any  given  time, however, and  it  is
unlikely  that  its  position  has  changed  very  much  through  time  because  it
always nearly coincides with Earth s rotational axis. This discrepancy implies
that the magnetic pole remained stationary while North America and Eurasia
moved relative to the pole and relative to each other. Figure 2.8b shows that
when the continents are moved into the positions they occupied when they
were part of Pangaea, the two wandering curves match up, providing strong
evidence that the continents have moved throughout geologic time.

MAGNETIC POLARITY REVERSALS Magnetic compasses on Earth today follow
lines of magnetic force and point toward magnetic north. It turns out, however,
that the polarity (the directional orientation of the magnetic field) has reversed
itself  periodically  throughout  geologic  time. In  essence, the  north  and  south
magnetic poles switch. Figure 2.9 shows how ancient rocks have recorded the
switching of earth s magnetic polarity through time.

Paleomagnetic studies reveal that about 170 major reversals have occurred in
the past 76 million years. The pattern of switching of Earth s magnetic field is highly
irregular but occurs about every 250,000 years or so. On average, it takes several
hundred to several thousand years for a change in polarity to occur; it is identified in
rock sequences by a gradual decrease in the intensity of the magnetic field of one
polarity, followed by a gradual increase in the intensity of the magnetic field of
opposite polarity.

Earth s magnetic north pole which does not coincide with the geographic
North Pole was discovered at Canada s Cape Adelaide in 1831; since that time,
it s  been  migrating  northwest  by  about  50  kilometers  (30  miles)  each  year
(Figure 2.7c). At this rate, Earth s magnetic pole will pass within 400 kilometers
(250 miles) of the geographic North Pole in 2018 and will be in Siberia by 2050.
In addition, evidence suggests that Earth s magnetic field has also been weaken-
ing during the past 2000 years, which may be an indication that Earth s current
normal polarity may reverse itself. In fact, the last major reversal of Earth s
magnetic poles occurred 780,000 years ago, which suggests that the next one is
overdue.

PALEOMAGNETISM  AND  THE  OCEAN FLOOR Paleomagnetism had certainly
proved  its  usefulness  on  land, but, up  until  the  mid-1950s, it  had  only  been
conducted on continental rocks. Would the ocean floor also show variations in
magnetic  polarity? To  test this idea, the U.S. Coast  and  Geodetic  Survey  in

DO SEA TURTLES (AND OTHER ANIMALS) USE EARTH S MAGNETIC 
FIELD FOR NAVIGATION?

Sea turtles travel great distances across
the open ocean so they can lay their eggs
on  the  island  where  they  themselves
were hatched. Interestingly, this behav-
ior  of  migrating  to  remote,
isolated
islands thousands of kilometers from the
closest  continent  may  have  gradually
evolved as ocean basins widened due to
plate movement, separating the turtles
feeding and breeding grounds. How do
the  turtles  know  where  an  island  is
located, and how do they navigate at sea
during their long voyage?

Radio  tagging  of  green  sea  turtles
(Chelonia  mydas; Figure  2A)  indicates
that  during  their  migration, they  often
travel in an essentially straight-line path
to reach their destination. One hypothe-
sis suggests that, like the Polynesian nav-
igators (see Box 1.2), sea turtles use wave
direction  to  help them steer. However,
studies  of  their  migration  route  reveal
that  green  sea  turtles  continue  along  a
straight-line path that is independent of
wave direction.
Research 

in  magnetoreception,
which is the study of an animal s ability
to  sense  magnetic  fields, suggests  that
sea  turtles  may  use  Earth s  magnetic
field for navigation. For instance, turtles
can distinguish between different mag-
netic inclination angles, which in effect
would allow them to sense latitude. Sea
turtles  can  also  distinguish  magnetic
field intensity, which gives a rough indi-
cation of longitude. By sensing these two
magnetic  field  properties, a  sea  turtle
could determine its position at sea and
relocate  to  a  tiny  island  thousands  of
kilometers away. Like any good naviga-
tor, sea turtles may also use other tools,
such  as  olfactory  (scent)  clues, Sun
angles,
local  landmarks, and  oceano-
graphic phenomena.

Other animals may also use magnetic
properties to navigate. For example, some
whales and dolphins may detect and follow
the magnetic stripes on the sea floor during
their  movements, which  may  help  to
explain  why  whales  sometimes  beach
themselves. In  addition, certain  bacteria
use  the  magnetic  mineral  magnetite  to
align  themselves  parallel  to  Earth s
magnetic  field. Subsequently, magnetite
has been found in many other organisms
that have a  homing ability, including fish,
honeybees, birds, turtles, lobsters, cows, and
even humans. What remains unclear is how
these  animals  detect
and  potentially
use Earth s magnetic field. Recent find-
ings by a research team studying rainbow
trout have traced magnetically receptive
fibers  of  nerves  back  to  the  brain, more

closely  linking  a  magnetic  sense  with  an
organism s sensory system.

Do humans have an innate ability to
use  Earth s  magnetic  field  for  naviga-
tion?  Studies  conducted  on  humans
indicate that the majority of people can
identify  north  after  being  blindfolded
and  disoriented. Interestingly, many
people point south instead of north, but
this direction is along the lines of mag-
netic force. Similarly, migratory animals
that  rely  on  magnetism  for  navigation
will  not  be  confused  by  a  reversal  in
Earth s  magnetic  field  and  will  still  be
able  to  get  to  where  they  need  to  go.
Exactly  how  organisms  navigate  with
their  magnetic  sense  seems  likely  to
remain  one  of  the  most  puzzling
questions in sensory biology.

conjunction  with  scientists  from  Scripps  Institution
of Oceanography undertook an extensive deep-water
mapping program off Oregon and Washington in 1955.
Using  a  sensitive  instrument  called  a  magnetometer
(magneto * magnetism, meter * measure), which  is
towed  behind  a  research  vessel, the  scientists  spent
several weeks at sea moving back and forth in a regularly
spaced  pattern, measuring  Earth s  magnetic  field  and
how it was affected by the magnetic properties of rocks
on the ocean floor.

When the scientists analyzed their data, they found
that the entire surveyed area had a pattern of north south
stripes in a surprisingly regular and alternating pattern of
above-average and below-average magnetism. What was
even more surprising was that the pattern appeared to be
symmetrical with respect to a long mountain range that
was fortuitously in the middle of their survey area.

Detailed paleomagnetism studies of this and other
areas  of  the  sea  floor  confirmed  a  similar  pattern  of
alternating stripes of above-average and below-average
magnetism. These stripes are called magnetic anomalies
(a * without, nomo * law; an anomaly is a departure
from normal conditions). The ocean floor had embedded
in  it  a  regular  pattern  of  alternating  magnetic  stripes
unlike anywhere on land.

Researchers had a difficult time explaining why the
ocean  floor  had  such  a  regular  pattern  of  magnetic
anomalies. Nor could they explain how the sequence on
one side of the underwater mountain range matched the sequence on the oppo-
site side
in essence, they were a mirror image of each other. To understand
how this pattern could have formed, more information was needed about ocean
floor features and their origin.

Sea Floor Spreading and Features 
of the Ocean Basins
Geologist Harry Hess (1906 1969), when he was a U.S. Navy captain in World
War II, developed the habit of leaving his depth recorder on at all times while
his ship was traveling at sea. After the war, compilation of these and many
other depth records  showed extensive  mountain ridges near the centers of
ocean basins and extremely deep, narrow trenches at the edges of ocean basins.
In 1962, Hess published History of Ocean Basins, which contained the idea of
sea floor spreading and the associated circular movement of rock material in
as  the  driving
the  mantle
mechanism (Figure 2.10). He suggested that new ocean crust was created at the
ridges, split apart, moved away from the ridges, and later disappeared back into
the  deep  Earth  at  trenches. Mindful  of  the  resistance  of  North  American
scientists to the idea of continental drift, Hess referred to his own work as

convection  (con * with, vect * carried) cells

geopoetry.

As it turns out, Hess s initial ideas about sea floor spreading have been con-
firmed. The mid-ocean ridge (Figure 2.10) is a continuous underwater mountain
range that winds through every ocean basin in the world and resembles the seam
on a baseball. It is entirely volcanic in origin, wraps one-and-a-half times around
the globe, and rises more than 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) above the surrounding
deep-ocean floor. It even rises above sea level in places such as Iceland. New
ocean floor forms at the crest, or axis, of the mid-ocean ridge. By the process of

sea floor spreading, new ocean floor is split in two and carried away from the axis,
replaced by the upwelling of volcanic material that fills the void with new strips
of sea floor. Sea floor spreading occurs along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge,
which is referred to as a spreading center. One way to think of the mid-ocean
ridge is as a zipper that is being pulled apart. Thus, Earth s zipper (the mid-ocean
ridge) is becoming unzipped!

At the same time, ocean floor is being destroyed at deep ocean trenches.
Trenches are the deepest parts of the ocean floor and resemble a narrow crease or
trough (Figure 2.10). Some of the largest earthquakes in the world occur near
these  trenches; they  are  caused  by  a  plate  that  bends  downward  and  slowly
plunges back into Earth s interior. This process is called subduction (sub = under,
duc = lead), and the sloping area from the trench along the downward-moving
plate is called a subduction zone.

In 1963, geologists Frederick Vine and Drummond Matthews of Cambridge
University  combined  the  seemingly  unrelated  pattern  of  magnetic  sea  floor
stripes with the process of sea floor spreading to explain the perplexing pattern
of alternating and symmetric magnetic stripes on the sea floor (Figure 2.11). Vine
and  Matthews  interpreted  the  pattern  of  above-average  and  below-average
magnetic polarity episodes embedded in sea floor rocks to be caused by Earth s
magnetic  field  alternating  between  normal polarity  (similar  to  today s
magnetic pole position in the north) and  reversed polarity (with the magnetic
pole to the south). They proposed that the pattern could be created when newly
formed rocks at the mid-ocean ridge are magnetized with whichever polarity
exists on Earth during their formation. As those rocks are slowly moved away
from the crest of the mid-ocean ridge, they maintain their original polarity and
subsequent rocks record the periodic switches of Earth s magnetic polarity. The
result is an alternating pattern of magnetic polarity stripes that are symmetric
with respect to the mid-ocean ridge.

The pattern of alternating reversals of Earth s magnetic field as recorded
in the sea floor was the most convincing piece of evidence set forth to support
the concept of sea floor spreading
and, as a result, continental drift. However,
the  continents  weren t  plowing  through  the  ocean  basins  as  Wegener  had
envisioned. Instead, the  ocean  floor  was  a  conveyer  belt  that  was  being

The plate tectonic model states that new sea floor is

continuously formed at the mid-ocean ridge and destroyed at the trenches, with
the continents just passively riding along on the conveyer. By the late 1960s,
most geologists had changed their stand on continental drift in light of this new
evidence.

Other Evidence from the Ocean Basins
Even though the tide of scientific opinion had indeed switched to favor a mobile
Earth, additional evidence from the ocean floor would further support the ideas
of continental drift and sea floor spreading.

AGE OF THE OCEAN FLOOR In the late 1960s, an ambitious deep-sea drilling
program was initiated to test the existence of sea floor spreading. One of the
program s primary missions was to drill into and collect ocean floor rocks for
radiometric  age  dating. If  sea  floor  spreading  does  indeed  occur, then  the
youngest sea floor rocks would be atop the mid-ocean ridge and the ages of
rocks would increase on either side of the ridge in a symmetric pattern.

The map in Figure 2.12, showing the age of the ocean floor beneath deep-sea
deposits, is based on the pattern of magnetic stripes verified with thousands of
radiometrically age-dated samples. It shows the ocean floor is youngest along the
mid-ocean ridge, where new ocean floor is created, and the age of rocks increases

2.2 What Evidence Supports Plate Tectonics?

the mid-ocean ridge. Farther away from the mid-ocean ridge, the rocks increase linearly in age in either direction. Ages shown are

with increasing distance in either direction away from the axis of the ridge. The
symmetric  pattern  of  ocean  floor  ages  confirms  that  the  process  of  sea  floor
spreading must indeed be occurring.

The Atlantic Ocean has the simplest and most symmetric pattern of age distri-
bution in Figure 2.12. The pattern results from the newly formed Mid-Atlantic
Ridge that rifted Pangaea apart. The Pacific Ocean has the least symmetric pattern
because many subduction zones surround it. For example, ocean floor east of the
East Pacific Rise that is older than 40 million years old has already been subducted.
The ocean floor in the northwestern Pacific, about 180 million years old, has not yet
been subducted. A portion of the East Pacific Rise has even disappeared under
North America. The age bands in the Pacific Ocean are wider than those in the
Atlantic  and  Indian  Oceans, which  suggests  the  rate  of  sea  floor  spreading  is
greatest in the Pacific Ocean.

Recall from Chapter 1 that the ocean is at least 4 billion years old. However,
the oldest ocean floor is only 180 million years old (or 0.18 billion years old), and
the majority of the ocean floor is not even half that old (see Figure 2.12). How
could the ocean floor be so incredibly young while the oceans themselves are so
phenomenally old? According to plate tectonic theory, new ocean floor is created
at the mid-ocean ridge by sea floor spreading and moves off the ridge to eventu-
ally be subducted and remelted in the mantle. In this way, the ocean floor keeps
regenerating itself. The floor beneath the oceans today is not the same one that
existed beneath the oceans 4 billion years ago.

If the rocks that comprise the ocean floor are so young, why are continental
rocks so old? Based on radiometric age dating, the oldest rocks on land are about
4 billion years old. Many other continental rocks approach this age, implying that
the same processes that constantly renew the sea floor do not operate on land.

48

Chapter 2

Plate Tectonics and the Ocean Floor

Rather, evidence suggests that continental rocks, because of their low density, do
not get recycled by the process of sea floor spreading and thus remain at Earth s
surface for long periods of time.

HEAT  FLOW The heat from Earth s interior is released to the surface as heat
flow. Current models indicate that this heat moves to the surface with magma in
convective motion. Most of the heat is carried to regions of the mid-ocean ridge
spreading centers (see Figure 2.10). Cooler portions of the mantle descend along
subduction zones to complete each circular-moving convection cell.

Heat flow measurements show the amount of heat flowing to the surface
along the mid-ocean ridge can be up to eight times greater than the average
amount flowing to other parts of Earth s crust. Additionally, heat flow at deep-sea
trenches, where ocean floor is subducted, can be as little as one-tenth the average.
Increased heat flow at the mid-ocean ridge and decreased heat flow at subduction
zones is what would be expected based on thin crust at the mid-ocean ridge and a
double thickness of crust at the trenches (see Figure 2.10).

WORLDWIDE  EARTHQUAKES Earthquakes are  sudden  releases  of  energy
caused by fault movement or volcanic eruptions. The map in Figure 2.13a shows
that most large earthquakes occur along ocean trenches, reflecting the energy
released during subduction. Other earthquakes occur along the mid-ocean ridge,
reflecting the energy released during sea floor spreading. Still others occur along
major faults in the sea floor and on land, reflecting the energy released when
moving plates contact other plates along their edges. The two maps in Figure 2.13
show that the distribution of worldwide earthquakes closely matches the locations
of plate boundaries.

The Acceptance of a Theory
The accumulation of lines of evidence such as those mentioned in this section,
along with many other lines of evidence in support of moving continents, has
convinced scientists of the validity of continental drift. Since the late 1960s, the
concepts of continental drift and sea floor spreading have been united into a
much more encompassing theory known as plate tectonics, which describes the
movement of  the  outermost  portion  of  Earth  and the  resulting  creation  of
continental  and  sea  floor  features. These  tectonic  plates  are  pieces  of  the
lithosphere (lithos * rock, sphere * ball)  that  float  on  the  more  fluid
asthenosphere (asthenos * weak, sphere * ball) below.4

Although several mechanisms have been proposed for the force or forces
responsible for driving this motion, none of them are able to explain all aspects of
plate motion. However, recent research based on a simple model of lithosphere
and mantle interactions suggests that two major tectonic forces may act in unison
on the leading edges of subducting plates (slabs) to generate the observed plate
movements: (1) slab pull, which is generated by a subducting plate that pulls the
rest of the plate behind it, and (2) slab suction, which is created as a subducting
plate drags against the viscous mantle and causes the mantle to flow in toward the
subduction zone, thereby sucking in nearby plates much in the same way pulling a
plug from a bathtub draws floating objects toward it. If this model is true, then the
unequal distribution of heat within Earth, which was thought to be the underlying
driving force for plate movement, may not be nearly as important as a driving
mechanism.

Since  the  acceptance  of  the  theory  of  plate  tectonics, much  research  has

focused on understanding various features associated with plate boundaries.

How fast do plates move, and have they always
moved at the same rate?

Currently, plates move an average of 2 to 12 centime-
ters (1 to 5 inches) per year, which is about as fast as
a  person s  fingernails  grow.  A  person s  fingernail
growth is dependent on many factors, including hered-
ity, gender, diet, and amount of exercise but averages
about 8 centimeters (3 inches) per year. This may not
sound very fast, but the plates have been moving for
millions of years. Over a very long time, even an object
moving slowly will eventually travel a great distance.
For instance, fingernails growing at a rate of 8 cen-
timeters (3 inches) per year for 1 million years would
be 80 kilometers (50 miles) long!

Evidence shows that the plates were moving faster
millions  of  years  ago  than  they  are  moving  today.
Geologists can determine the rate of plate motion in
the past by analyzing the width of new oceanic crust
produced by sea floor spreading, since fast spreading
produces more sea floor rock. (Using this relationship
and by examining Figure 2.12, you should be able to
determine whether the Pacific Ocean or the Atlantic
Ocean  had  a  faster  spreading  rate.)  Recent  studies
using this same technique indicate that about 50 mil-
lion years ago, India attained a speed of 19 centimeters
(7.5 inches) per year. Other research indicates that
about 530 million years ago, plate motions may have
been as high as 30 centimeters (1 foot) per year! What
caused these rapid bursts of plate motion? Geologists
are not sure why plates moved more rapidly in the past,
but increased heat release from Earth s interior is a
likely mechanism.

are associated with a
Plate boundaries where plates interact with each other
great deal of tectonic activity, such as mountain building, volcanic activity, and
earthquakes. In fact, the first clues to the locations of plate boundaries were the
dramatic tectonic events that occur there. For example, Figure 2.13 shows the
close correspondence between worldwide earthquakes and plate boundaries.
Further, Figure 2.13b shows that Earth s surface is composed of seven major
plates along with many smaller ones. Close examination of Figure 2.13b shows
that the boundaries of plates do not always follow coastlines and, as a conse-
quence, nearly all plates contain both oceanic and continental crust.5 Notice also
that about 90% of plate boundaries occur on the sea floor.

There are three types of plate boundaries, as shown in Figure 2.14. Divergent
(di * apart, vergere * to incline) boundaries are found along oceanic ridges where
new lithosphere is being added. Convergent (con * together, vergere * to incline)
boundaries are found where plates are moving together and one plate subducts
beneath the other. Transform (trans * across, form * shape) boundaries are found
where lithospheric plates slowly grind past one another. Table 2.1 summarizes
characteristics, tectonic processes, features, and examples of these plate boundaries.

Divergent Boundary Features
Divergent plate boundaries occur where two plates move apart, such as along the
crest of the mid-ocean ridge where sea floor spreading creates new oceanic litho-
sphere (Figure 2.15). A common feature along the crest of the mid-ocean ridge is
a rift valley, which is a central downdropped linear depression (Figure 2.16). Pull-
apart  faults  located  along  the  central  rift  valley  show  that  the  plates  are
continuously being pulled apart rather than being pushed apart by the upwelling
of material beneath the mid-ocean ridge. Upwelling of magma beneath the mid-
ocean ridge is simply filling in the void left by the separating plates of lithosphere.
In the process, sea floor spreading produces about 20 cubic kilometers (4.8 cubic
miles) of new ocean crust worldwide each year.

Figure 2.17 shows how the development of a mid-ocean ridge creates an
ocean basin. Initially, molten material rises to the surface, causing upwarping
and thinning of the crust. Volcanic activity produces vast quantities of high-
density basaltic rock. As the plates begin to move apart, a linear rift valley is
formed and volcanism continues. Further splitting apart of the land a process
called rifting
and more spreading cause the area to drop below sea level.
When this occurs, the rift valley eventually floods with seawater and a young
linear  sea  is  formed. After  millions  of  years  of  sea  floor  spreading, a  full-
fledged ocean basin is created with a mid-ocean ridge in the middle of the two
landmasses.

52

Chapter 2

Plate Tectonics and the Ocean Floor

FIGURE 2.15 Divergent boundary at the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge. Most divergent plate boundaries occur along the
crest of the mid-ocean ridge, where sea floor spreading
creates new oceanic lithosphere.

Two different stages of ocean basin development are shown in the map of
East Africa in Figure 2.18. First, the rift valleys are actively pulled apart and are at
the rift valley stage of formation. Second, the Red Sea is at the linear sea stage. It
has rifted apart so far that the land has dropped below sea level. The Gulf of
California in Mexico is another linear sea. The Gulf of California and the Red Sea
are two of the youngest seas in the world, having been created only a few million
years ago. If plate motions continue rifting the plates apart in these areas, they will
eventually become large oceans.

OCEANIC  RISES  VERSUS  OCEANIC  RIDGES The rate at which the sea floor
spreads apart varies along the mid-ocean ridge and dramatically affects its
appearance. Faster spreading, for instance, produces broader and less rugged
segments of the global mid-ocean ridge system. This is because fast-spreading
segments of the mid-ocean ridge produce vast amounts of rock, which move
away from the spreading center at a rapid rate and consequently undergo less
thermal contraction and subsidence than slower-spreading segments do. In
addition, central rift valleys on slow-spreading segments tend to be larger and
better developed.

valley looking south from Laki volcano in Iceland, which
sits atop the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The rift valley is
marked by the linear row of volcanoes extending from
the bottom of the photo to the horizon that are split in
half. Note the bus (red circle) for scale.

The gently sloping and fast-spreading parts of the mid-ocean ridge are
called oceanic rises. For example, the East Pacific Rise (Figure 2.19, bottom)
between the Pacific and Nazca Plates is a broad, low, gentle swelling of the sea
floor with a small, indistinct central rift valley and has a spreading rate as high
as  16.5  centimeters  (6.5 inches)  per  year.6 Conversely, steeper-sloping  and
slower-spreading areas of the mid-ocean ridge are called oceanic ridges. For
instance, the  Mid-Atlantic  Ridge (Figure  2.19, top)  between  the  South
American and African Plates is a tall, steep, rugged oceanic ridge that has an
average spreading rate of 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) per year and stands as much
as 3000 meters (10,000 feet) above the surrounding sea floor. Its prominent
central rift valley is as much as 32 kilometers (20 miles) wide and averages 2
kilometers (1.2 miles) deep.

Recently, a new class of spreading centers called ultra-slow spreading centers
has also been recognized. These spreading centers, which were discovered along

the Southwest Indian and Arctic segments of
the  mid-ocean  ridge, are  characterized  by
spreading  rates  less  than  2  centimeters  (0.8
inch) per year, a deep rift valley, and volcanoes
that occur only at widely spaced intervals. The
ultra-slow ridges are spreading so slowly, in fact,
that  Earth s  mantle  itself  is  exposed  on  the
ocean floor in great slabs of rock between these
volcanoes.

EARTHQUAKES ASSOCIATED WITH DIVERGENT
BOUNDARIES The amount of energy released
by earthquakes along divergent plate boundaries
is closely related to the spreading rate. The faster
the sea floor spreads, the less energy is released
in  each  earthquake. Earthquake  intensity  is
usually measured on a scale called the seismic
moment  magnitude, which  reflects  the  energy
released  to  create  very  long-period  seismic
waves. Because it more adequately represents
larger  magnitude  earthquakes, the  moment
magnitude scale is increasingly used instead of
the well-known Richter scale and is represented
by the symbol Mw. Earthquakes in the rift valley
of the slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge reach
a  maximum  magnitude  of  about  Mw
* 6.0
whereas  those  occurring  along  the  axis  of  the
fast-spreading East Pacific Rise seldom exceed
Mw

* 4.5.7

East Pacific Rise

Convergent Boundary Features
Convergent  boundaries where  two  plates
move  together  and  collide
result  in  the
destruction of ocean crust as one plate plunges
below the other and is remelted in the mantle.
One feature associated with a convergent plate
boundary  is  a  deep-ocean  trench, which  is  a
deep and narrow depression on the sea floor
that  marks  the  beginning  of  the  subduction
zone. Another feature is an arc-shaped row of
highly  active  and  explosively  erupting  volca-
noes called a volcanic arc that parallels the trench and occurs above the subduc-
tion zone. Volcanic arcs are formed by the downgoing plate in the subduction
zone heating up and releasing superheated gases mostly water
that cause the
overlying mantle to partially melt. This molten rock, which is more buoyant than
the rock around it, slowly rises up to the surface and feeds the active volcanoes.

Figure 2.20 shows the three subtypes of convergent boundaries that result from

interactions between the two different types of crust (oceanic and continental).

OCEANIC CONTINENTAL  CONVERGENCE When  an  oceanic  plate  and  a
continental plate converge, the denser oceanic plate is subducted (Figure 2.20a).
The oceanic plate becomes heated as it is subducted into the asthenosphere and
releases superheated gases that partially melt the overlying mantle, which rises to

7Note that each one-unit increase of earthquake magnitude represents an increase of energy release
of about 30 times.

the surface through the overriding continental plate. The rising
basalt-rich magma mixes with the granite of the continental crust,
producing  lava  in  volcanic  eruptions  at  the  surface  that  is
intermediate in composition between basalt and granite. One type
of volcanic rock with this composition is called andesite, named
after  the Andes  Mountains  of  South America  because  it  is  so
common  there. Because  andesite  magma  is  more  viscous  than
basalt  magma  and  contains  such  high  gas  content, andesitic
volcanic  eruptions  are  usually  quite  explosive  and  have
historically  been  very  destructive. The  result  of  this  volcanic
activity on the continent above the subduction zone produces a
type of volcanic arc called a continental arc. Continental arcs are
created by andesitic volcanic eruptions and by the folding and
uplifting associated with plate collision.

If the spreading center producing the subducting plate is
far  enough  from  the  subduction  zone, an  oceanic  trench
becomes well developed along the margin of the continent. The
Peru Chile Trench is an example, and the Andes Mountains are
the associated continental arc produced by partially melting the
mantle  above  the  subducting  plate. If  the  spreading  center
producing the subducting plate is close to the subduction zone,
however, the trench is not nearly as well developed. This is the
case where the Juan de Fuca Plate subducts beneath the North
American Plate off the coasts of Washington and Oregon to
produce the Cascade Mountains continental arc (Figure 2.21).
Here, the Juan de Fuca Ridge is so close to the North American
Plate  that  the  subducting  lithosphere  is  less  than  10  million
years old and has not cooled enough to become very deep. In
addition, the large amount of sediment carried to the ocean by
the Columbia River has filled most of the trench with sediment.
Many of the Cascade volcanoes of this continental arc have
been active within the last 100 years. Most recently, Mount St.
Helens erupted in May 1980, killing 62 people. Box 2.2 presents
information about a new high-tech sea floor observatory on the
Juan de Fuca Plate.

OCEANIC OCEANIC  CONVERGENCE When two oceanic plates
converge, the denser oceanic plate is subducted (Figure 2.20b).
Typically, the older oceanic plate is denser because it has had more
time  to  cool  and  contract. This  type  of  convergence  produces
the deepest trenches in the world, such as the Mariana Trench
in the  western  Pacific  Ocean. Similar  to  oceanic continental
convergence, the  subducting  oceanic  plate  becomes  heated,
releases  superheated  gases, and  partially  melts  the  overlying
mantle. This buoyant molten material rises to the surface and fuels
the active volcanoes, which occur as an arc-shaped row of volcanic
islands  that  is  a  type  of  volcanic  arc  called  an  island  arc. The
molten material is mostly basaltic because there is no mixing with
granitic rocks from the continents, and the eruptions are not nearly
as destructive. Examples of island arc/trench systems are the West
Indies s Leeward and Windward Islands/Puerto Rico Trench in the
Caribbean Sea and the Aleutian Islands/Aleutian Trench in the
North Pacific Ocean.

CONTINENTAL CONTINENTAL  CONVERGENCE When  two  continental  plates
converge, which one is subducted? you might expect that the older of the two
(which is most likely the denser one) will be subducted. Continental lithosphere

forms differently than oceanic lithosphere, however, and old continental lithosphere
is no denser than young continental lithosphere. It turns out that neither subducts
because both are too low in density to be pulled very far down into the mantle.
Instead, a tall uplifted mountain range is created by the collision of the two plates
(Figure 2.20c).These mountains are composed of folded and deformed sedimentary
rocks  originally  deposited  on  the  sea  floor  that  previously  separated  the  two
continental plates. the oceanic crust itself may subduct beneath such mountains. A
prime example of continental continental convergence is the collision of India with
Asia (Figure 2.22). It began 45 million years ago and has created the Himalaya
mountains, presently the tallest mountains on Earth.

EARTHQUAKES  ASSOCIATED  WITH  CONVERGENT  BOUNDARIES Both
spreading  centers  and  trench  systems  are  characterized  by  earthquakes, but
in different ways. Spreading centers have shallow earthquakes, usually less than
10 kilometers (6 miles) deep. Earthquakes in the trenches, on the other hand, vary
from near the surface down to 670 kilometers (415 miles) deep, which are the
deepest earthquakes in the world. These earthquakes are clustered in a band
about 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) thick that closely corresponds to the location of
the subduction zone. In fact, the subducting plate in a convergent plate boundary

THE NEPTUNE PROJECT: AN INTERACTIVE SEA FLOOR OBSERVATORY

The earth, ocean, and planetary sciences
are shifting from an intermittent expedi-
tionary mode of identifying  what s out
there to  a  sustained, on-site  presence
that enables scientists to explore natural
systems  in  real-time. This  shift  arises  in
part from the rapidly expanding develop-
ments in the computational, robotic, com-
munications, and sensor industries and in
part  from  a  growing  awareness  of  the
complexity  and  interactive  dynamics  of
many  natural  systems  over  long  time
spans. Several  countries  are  engaged
in developing  remote-controlled  obser-
vatories to monitor the sea floor and its
adjacent  components. One  of  the  most
elaborate is the North East Pacific Time-
series Undersea Networked Experiments,
or NEPTUNE, which is also the name of
Roman mythology s god of the sea.

in  Seattle  and 

The NEPTUNE project is a multina-
tional partnership between the University
of  Washington 
the
University of Victoria, Canada, aimed at
establishing a cutting-edge sea floor obser-
vatory system designed to monitor tectonic
activity  along  the  Juan  de  Fuca  tectonic
plate  in  the  northeast  Pacific  Ocean
(Figure  2B). To  accomplish  its  goals, the
project  seeks  to  establish  a  network  of
fiber-optic/power cables that will encircle
and cross the Juan de Fuca Plate. Between
30 and 50 experimental sites will be estab-
lished at nodes along the cables.These sites
will be instrumented to interact with vari-
ous geological, physical, chemical, and bio-
logical phenomena. Sensor networks will
monitor activity between nodes and will
include multipurpose robotic underwater
vehicles that will reside at depth, recharge
at  nodes, and  respond  to  events  such  as
submarine volcanic eruptions.The network
will  provide  real-time  information  and

capabilities 

NEPTUNE, which is expected to be
fully  operational  in  2012, will  enable
regional-scale, long-term, real-time obser-
vations and experiments within the ocean,
on the sea floor, and beneath the sea floor.
The  network  will  be  a  resource  for  the
scientific  and  educational  communities,
much as a research vessel is an observa-

tional platform open to a wide range of
users. For the first time, researchers, as well
as decision makers and shore-based learn-
ers of all ages, will be able to participate in
detailed  studies  and  experiments  on  a
wide  area  of  sea  floor  and  ocean  for
decades  rather  than  just  hours  or  days.
With an anticipated life span of 30 years,
the network will provide unprecedented
interdisciplinary measurements of oceanic
variables.

subducting plate must actually bend as it dives below the surface. In addition, thick
crust associated with convergent boundaries  tends to store more energy than
the thinner crust at divergent boundaries. Also, mineral structure changes occur at
the higher pressures encountered deep below the surface, which are thought to
produce changes in volume that lead to some of the most powerful earthquakes in
the world. In fact, the largest earthquake ever recorded was the 1960 Chilean
earthquake near the Peru Chile Trench, which had a magnitude of M

Plate Tectonics and the Ocean Floor

Transform Boundary Features
A global sea floor map (such as the one inside the front cover of this book) shows
that the mid-ocean ridge is offset by many large features oriented perpendicular
(at right angles) to the crest of the ridge. What causes these offsets? They are
formed because spreading at a mid-ocean ridge only occurs perpendicular to the
axis of a ridge and all parts of a plate must move together. As a result, offsets are
oriented perpendicular to the ridge and parallel to each other to accommodate
spreading of a linear ridge system on a spherical Earth. In addition, the offsets
allow different segments of the mid-ocean ridge to spread apart at different rates.
These offsets
give the mid-ocean ridge a zigzag appear-
ance. There are thousands of these transform faults, some large and some small,
which dissect the global mid-ocean ridge.

called transform faults

OCEANIC  VERSUS  CONTINENTAL  TRANSFORM  FAULTS There are two types
of transform faults. The first and most common type occurs wholly on the ocean
floor  and  is  called  an  oceanic  transform  fault. The  second  type  cuts  across  a
continent and is called a continental transform fault. Regardless of type, though,
transform faults always occur between two segments of a mid-ocean ridge, as
shown in Figure 2.23.

EARTHQUAKES ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSFORM BOUNDARIES The movement
of one plate past another a process called transform faulting produces shallow
but often strong earthquakes in the lithosphere. Magnitudes of Mw * 7.0 have been
recorded along some oceanic transform faults. One of the best studied faults in the
world is California s San Andreas Fault, a continental transform fault that runs from
the Gulf of California past San Francisco and beyond into northern California.
Because  the  San Andreas  Fault  cuts  through  continental  crust, which  is  much
thicker than oceanic crust, earthquakes are considerably larger than those produced
by oceanic transform faults, sometimes up to Mw * 8.5.

Because California experiences large periodic earthquakes, many people are
mistakenly concerned that it will  fall off into the ocean during a large earth-
quake along the San Andreas Fault. These earthquakes occur as the Pacific Plate
continues to move to the northwest past the North American Plate at a rate of
about 5 centimeters (2 inches) a year. At this rate, Los Angeles (on the Pacific
Plate) will be adjacent to San Francisco (on the North American Plate) in about
18.5 million years
a length of time for about 1 million generations of people to
live their lives. Although California will never fall into the ocean, people living
near this fault should be very aware they are likely to experience a large earth-
quake within their lifetime.

2.4 Testing the Model: What Are Some

Applications of Plate Tectonics?

One  of  the  strengths  of  plate  tectonic  theory  is  how  it  unifies  so  many
seemingly separate events into a single consistent model. Let s look at a few
examples that illustrate how plate tectonic processes can be used to explain the
origin of features that, up until the acceptance of plate tectonics, were difficult
to explain.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
The three main types of plate boundaries are
divergent (plates moving apart such as at the mid-
ocean ridge), convergent (plates moving together
such as at an ocean trench), and transform
(plates sliding past each other such as at a
transform fault).

Tectonic Settings of

Hotspots and Mantle Plumes

tures near plate boundaries, it did not seem to explain the origin of intraplate

plate boundary. For instance, how can plate tectonics explain volcanic islands
near  the  middle  of  a  plate?  Areas  of  intense  volcanic  activity  that  remain
in more or less the same location over long periods of geologic time and are
unrelated to plate boundaries are called hotspots.8 For example, the continuing
volcanism in Yellowstone National Park and Hawaii are caused by hotspots.

Why is there so much volcanic activity at hotspots? The plate tectonic model
infers  that  hotspot  volcanism  is  caused  by  the  presence  of  mantle  plumes
(pluma * a soft feather), which are columnar areas of hot molten rock that arise
from  deep  within  the  mantle. Mantle  plumes  are  most  likely  related  to  the
positions of convection cells in the mantle. There appear to be several types of
mantle plumes: Some come from the core mantle boundary, while others have a
shallower source. Recent research reveals that the core mantle boundary is not
a  simple  smooth  dividing  zone  but  has  many  regional  variations, which  has
implications for the development of mantle plumes. Currently, there is vigorous
scientific debate regarding mantle plumes and volcanism at hotspots, mainly
because the seismic data to support or disprove the plume model have so far
been inconclusive.9 In fact, new studies suggest that hotspots are neither deep
phenomenon nor fixed in position over geologic time as assumed in the stan-
dard plume model.

Worldwide, more than 100 hotspots have been active within the past 10 million
years. Figure 2.24 shows the global distribution of prominent hotspots today. In

8Note that a hotspot is different from either a volcanic arc or a mid-ocean ridge (both of which are
related to plate boundaries), even though all are marked by a high degree of volcanic activity.

general, hotspots do not coincide with plate boundaries. Notable exceptions are
those that are near divergent boundaries where the lithosphere is thin, such as at the
Galápagos Islands and Iceland. In fact, Iceland straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (a
divergent plate boundary). It is also directly over a 150-kilometer- (93-mile)-wide
mantle plume, which accounts for its remarkable amount of volcanic activity so
much that it has caused Iceland to be one of the few areas of the global mid-ocean
ridge that rise high above sea level.

Throughout the Pacific Plate, many island chains are oriented in a north-
westward-southeastward  direction. The  most  intensely  studied  of  these  is
the Hawaiian  Islands Emperor  Seamount  Chain in  the  northern  Pacific
Ocean (Figure  2.25). What  created  this  chain  of  more  than  100  intraplate
volcanoes that stretch over 5800 kilometers (3000 miles)? Further, what caused
the prominent bend in the overall direction that occurs in the middle of the
chain?

To help answer these questions, examine the ages of the volcanoes in the
chain. Every volcano in the chain has long since become extinct, except the vol-
cano Kilauea on the island of Hawaii, which is the southeasternmost island of the
chain. The age of volcanoes progressively increases northwestward from Hawaii
(Figure  2.25). To  the  northwest, the  volcanoes  increase  in  age  past  Suiko
Seamount (65 million years old) to Detroit Seamount (81 million years old) near
the Aleutian Trench.

These age relationships suggest that the Pacific Plate has steadily moved
northwestward while the underlying mantle plume remained relatively stationary.
The resulting Hawaiian hotspot created each of the volcanoes in the chain. As
the plate moved, it carried the active volcano off the hotspot and a new volcano
began forming, younger in age than the previous one. A chain of extinct volcanoes
that is progressively older as one travels away from a hotspot is called a nematath
(nema * thread, tath * dung or manure), or a hotspot track. Evidence suggests

that about 47 million years ago, the Pacific Plate shifted from a northerly to a
northwesterly direction. This change in plate motion can account for the bend
(large elbow) in Figure 2.25 about halfway through the chain, separating the
Hawaiian Islands from the Emperor Seamounts. If this is true, then other hotspot
tracks throughout the Pacific Plate should show a similar bend at roughly the
same time, but most do not.

Recent research that may help resolve this disparity indicates that hotspots
do not remain completely stationary. In fact, several studies have shown that
most hotspots move at less than 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) per year but some like
Hawaii may have moved faster in the geologic past. Even if Hawaii s hotspot had
moved faster in the past, it did not do so in a way that would have created the
sharp bend in the Hawaiian Emperor track seen in Figure 2.25. Moreover, recent
plate reconstructions suggest that the observed bend in the Hawaiian Emperor
chain was created by a combination of the changing motion of the Pacific Plate
(mainly as a result of changes in plate motions near Australia and Antarctica)
and the slow movement of the Hawaiian hotspot itself. Other hotspot tracks may
have  been  at  least  partially  created  by  motion  of  their  hotspots  as  well.
Remarkably, hotspots appear to be moving in the exact opposite direction of
plates, so hotspots may still be useful for tracking plate motions.

In the future, what will become of Hawaii

the island that currently resides on
the hotspot? Based on the hotspot model, the island will be carried to the northwest
off the hotspot, become inactive, and eventually be subducted into the Aleutian
Trench, like all the rest of the volcanoes in the chain to the north of it. In turn, other
volcanoes will build up over the hotspot. In fact, a 3500-meter (11,500-foot) volcano

named Loihi already exists 32 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of Hawaii. Still 1 kilo-
meter (0.6 mile) below sea level, Loihi is volcanically active and, based on its current
rate of activity, it should reach the surface sometime between 30,000 and 100,000
years from now. As it builds above sea level, it will become the newest island in the
long chain of volcanoes created by the Hawaiian hotspot.

Seamounts and Tablemounts
Many areas of the ocean floor (most notably on the Pacific Plate) contain tall
volcanic peaks that resemble many volcanoes on land. These large volcanoes are
called seamounts if they are cone-shaped on top, like an upside-down ice cream
cone. Some volcanoes are flat on top unlike anything on land and are called
tablemounts, or guyots, after Princeton University s first geology professor, Arnold
Guyot.10 Until the theory of plate tectonics, it was unclear how the differences
between  seamounts  and  tablemounts  could  have  been  produced. The  theory
explains why tablemounts are flat on top and also explains why the tops of some
tablemounts have shallow-water deposits despite being located in very deep water.
The origin of many seamounts and tablemounts is related to the volcanic
activity occurring at hotspots; others are related to processes occurring at the
mid-ocean ridge (Figure 2.26). Because of sea floor spreading, active volcanoes
(seamounts) occur along the crest of the mid-ocean ridge. Some may be built
up so high they rise above sea level and become islands, at which point wave
erosion becomes important. When sea floor spreading has moved the seamount
off its source of magma (whether it is a mid-ocean ridge or a hotspot), the top
of the seamount can be flattened by waves in just a few million years. This
flattened seamount now a tablemount
continues to be carried away from its
source  and, after  millions  of  years, is  submerged  deeper  into  the  ocean.
Frequently, tops of tablemounts contain evidence of shallow-water conditions
(such as ancient coral reef deposits) that were carried with them into deeper
water.

seamounts and tablemounts are transported into deeper water, sometimes 
carrying with them evidence of their tops once reaching shallow water.

Coral Reef Development
On his voyage aboard the HMS Beagle, the famous naturalist
Charles Darwin11 noticed a progression of stages in coral reef
development. He hypothesized  that  the origin  of  coral  reefs
depended  on  the  subsidence  (sinking)  of  volcanic  islands
(Figure 2.27) and published the concept in The Structure and
Distribution of Coral Reefs in 1842. What Darwin s hypothesis
lacked was a mechanism for how volcanic islands subside. Much
later, advances in plate tectonic theory and samples of the deep
structure  of  coral  reefs  provided  evidence  to  help  support
Darwin s hypothesis.

Reef-building corals are colonial animals that live in shal-
low, warm, tropical seawater and produce a hard skeleton of
limestone. Once corals are established in an area that has the
conditions necessary for their growth, they continue to grow
upward layer by layer with each new generation attached to
the skeletons of its predecessors. Over millions of years, a thick
sequence  of  coral  reef  deposits  may  develop  if  conditions
remain favorable.

Stages of Coral Reef

Development

The three stages of development in coral reefs are called fringing, barrier,
and atoll. Fringing reefs (Figure 2.27a) initially develop along the margin of a
landmass (an island or a continent) where the temperature, salinity, and turbidity
(cloudiness) of the water are suitable for reef-building corals. Often, fringing
reefs are associated with active volcanoes whose lava flows run down the flanks
of the volcano and kill the coral. Thus, these fringing reefs are not very thick or
well developed. Because of the close proximity of the landmass to the reef, runoff
from  the  landmass  can  carry  so  much  sediment  that  the  reef  is  buried. The
amount of living coral in a fringing reef at any given time is relatively small, with
the greatest concentration in areas protected from sediment and salinity changes.
If sea level does not rise or the land does not subside, the process stops at the
fringing reef stage.

The barrier reef stage follows the fringing reef stage. Barrier reefs are linear
or  circular  reefs  separated  from  the  landmass  by  a  well-developed  lagoon
(Figure 2.27b). As the landmass subsides, the reef maintains its position close to
sea level by growing upward. Studies of reef growth rates indicate most have
grown 3 to 5 meters (10 to 16 feet) per 1000 years during the recent geologic
past. Evidence suggests that some fast-growing reefs in the Caribbean have
grown more than 10 meters (33 feet) per 1000 years. Note that if the landmass
subsides  at  a  rate  faster  than  coral  can  grow  upward, the  coral  reef  will  be
submerged in water too deep for it to live.

The largest reef system in the world is Australia s Great Barrier Reef, a
series of more than 3000 individual reefs collectively in the barrier reef stage
of development, home to hundreds of coral species and thousands of other
reef-dwelling organisms. The Great Barrier Reef lies 40 kilometers (25 miles)
or more offshore, averages 150 kilometers (90 miles) in width, and extends for
more than 2000 kilometers (1200 miles) along Australia s shallow northeastern

plate movement. About 30 million years ago, the Great
Barrier Reef began to develop as northern Australia moved
into tropical waters that allowed coral growth.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Many independent lines of evidence, such as the 
detection of plate motion by satellites, provide 
strong support for the theory of plate tectonics.

Australia reached water warm enough to grow coral before the southern parts
did. In other areas of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, smaller barrier
reefs are found around the tall volcanic peaks that form tropical islands.

The atoll (atar * crowded together) stage (Figure 2.27c) comes after the
barrier reef stage. As a barrier reef around a volcano continues to subside, coral
builds  up  toward  the  surface. After  millions  of  years, the  volcano  becomes
completely submerged, but the coral reef continues to grow. If the rate of subsi-
dence is slow enough for the coral to keep up, a circular reef called an atoll is
formed. The atoll encloses a lagoon usually not more than 30 to 50 meters (100 to
165  feet)  deep. The  reef  generally  has  many  channels  that  allow  circulation
between the lagoon and the open ocean. Buildups of crushed-coral debris often
form narrow islands that encircle the central lagoon (Figure 2.29) and are large
enough to allow human habitation.

Alternatively, a new theory has been put forward to explain the origin of coral
atolls. The theory suggests that glacial cycles cause sea level to fluctuate, leading to
episodes of reef exposure and dissolution when global sea level is lower during ice
ages, alternating with coral reef submergence and deposition when sea level is
higher during interglacial stages. Instead of the slow growth of ring-shaped coral
above a sinking volcanic island, this alternating cycle may be responsible for the
formation of coral atolls. More about sea level change is discussed in Chapter 10,
The Coast: Beaches and Shoreline Processes, and Chapter 16, The Oceans and

Climate Change.

Detecting Plate Motion with Satellites
Since the late 1970s, orbiting satellites have allowed the accurate positioning
of locations on Earth. (This technique is also used for navigation by ships
at sea; see  Box  1.2.)  If  the  plates  are  moving, satellite  positioning  should
show this movement over time. The map in Figure 2.30 shows locations that
have been measured in this manner and confirms that locations on Earth are
indeed  moving  in  good  agreement  with  the  direction  and  rate  of  motion
predicted by plate tectonics. Successful prediction that locations on Earth
are moving with respect to one another very strongly supports plate tectonic
theory.

2.5 How Has Earth Changed in the

Past, and How Will It Look in the
Future?

One of the most powerful features of any scientific theory is its ability to predict
occurrences. Let s examine how plate tectonics can be used to predict the loca-
tions of the continents and oceans in the past, as well as the implications it has for
their future configurations on Earth.

The Past: Paleogeography
The  study  of  historical  changes  of  continental  shapes  and  positions  is  called
paleogeography (paleo * ancient, geo * earth, graphy * the name of a descriptive
science). As a result of paleogeographic changes, the size and shape of ocean basins
have changed as well.

Figure 2.31 is a series of world maps showing the paleogeographic reconstruc-
tions of Earth at 60-million-year intervals. At 540 million years ago, many of the

present-day  continents  are  barely  recognizable. North  America  was  on  the
equator and rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Antarctica was on the equator and was
connected to many other continents.

Between  540  and  300  million  years  ago, the  continents  began  to  come
together to form Pangaea. Notice that Alaska had not yet formed. Continents
are  thought  to  add  material  through  the  process  of  continental  accretion
(ad * toward, crescere * to grow). Like adding layers onto a snowball, bits and
pieces of continents, islands, and volcanoes are added to the edges of continents
and create larger landmasses.

From 180 million years ago to the present, Pangaea separated and the conti-
nents  moved  toward  their  present-day  positions. North  America  and  South
America rifted away from Europe and Africa to produce the Atlantic Ocean. In
the Southern Hemisphere, South America and a continent composed of India,
Australia, and Antarctica began to separate from Africa.

By 120 million years ago, there was a clear separation between South America
and Africa, and India had moved northward, away from the Australia Antarctica
mass, which began moving toward the South Pole.As the Atlantic Ocean continued
to open, India moved rapidly northward and collided with Asia about 45 million
years ago. Australia had also begun a rapid journey to the north since separating
from Antarctica.

One  major  outcome  of  global  plate  tectonic  events  over  the  past  180
million years has been the creation of the Atlantic Ocean, which continues to
grow as the sea floor spreads along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. At the same time,
the  Pacific  Ocean  continues  to  shrink  due  to  subduction  along  the  many
trenches that surround it and continental plates that bear in from both the east
and west.

The Future: Some Bold Predictions
Using plate tectonics, a prediction of the future positions of features on Earth can
be made based on the assumption that the rate and direction of plate motion will
remain the same. Although these assumptions may not be entirely valid, they do
provide a framework for the prediction of the positions of continents and other
Earth features in the future.

Figure 2.32 is a map of what the world may look like 50 million years from
now, showing many notable differences compared to today. For instance, the east
African rift valleys may enlarge to form a new linear sea and the Red Sea may be
greatly enlarged from rifting there. India may continue to plow into Asia, further
uplifting the Himalaya Mountains. As Australia moves north toward Asia, it may
use New Guinea like a snowplow to accrete various islands. North America and
South America may continue to move west, enlarging the Atlantic Ocean and
decreasing the size of the Pacific Ocean. The land bridge of Central America may
no longer connect North and South America; this would dramatically alter ocean
circulation. Finally, the thin sliver of land that lies west of the San Andreas Fault
may become an island in the North Pacific, soon to be accreted onto southern
Alaska.

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K ...

Will the continents come back together and form a
single landmass anytime soon?

Yes,  it  is  very  likely  that  the  continents  will  come
back  together,  but  not  anytime  soon.  Because  all
the  continents  are  on  the  same  planetary  body,  a
continent  can  travel  only  so  far  before  it  collides
with  other  continents.  Recent  research  suggests
that the continents may form a supercontinent once
every 500 million years or so. It has been 200 million
years since Pangaea split up, so we have only about
300 million years to establish world peace!

K E Y   C O N C E P T
The geographic positions of the continents and
ocean basins are not fixed in time or place.
Rather, they have changed in the past and will 
continue to change in the future.

Plate Tectonics and the Ocean Floor

2.6 Plate Tectonics ...To Be Continued
Since its inception by Alfred Wegener nearly 100 years ago, plate tectonics has
been supported by a wealth of scientific evidence
some of which has been
presented in this chapter. Although there are still details to be worked out (such
as  the  exact  driving  mechanism), it  has  been  universally  accepted  by  Earth
scientists today because it helps explain so many observations about our planet.
Further, it has led to predictive models that have been  used to  successfully
understand Earth behavior. One such example is the Wilson cycle (Figure 2.33),

named in honor of geophysicist John Tuzo Wilson, for his contribution to the
early ideas of plate tectonics. The Wilson cycle uses plate tectonic processes to
show the distinctive life cycle of ocean basins during their formation, growth,
and destruction over many millions of years.

In the embryonic stage of the Wilson cycle, a heat source beneath the litho-
sphere creates uplift and begins to split a continent apart. The juvenile stage is
characterized by further spreading, downdropping, and the formation of a nar-
row, linear sea. The mature stage is where an ocean basin is fully developed,
with  a  mid-ocean  ridge  that  runs  down  the  middle  of  the  ocean  basin.
Eventually, a subduction zone occurs along the continental margin and the
plates  come  back  together, producing  the  declining  stage  where  the  ocean
basin shrinks. The terminal stage occurs when the plates come back together,
creating  a  progressively  narrower  ocean. Finally, in  the  suturing  stage, the
ocean disappears, the continents collide, and tall uplifted mountains are cre-
ated. Over time as the uplifted mountains erode, the stage is set to repeat the
cycle again.

Not only is plate tectonic activity primarily responsible for the creation of
landforms, but it also plays a prominent role in the development of ocean floor
features which is the topic of the next chapter. Armed with the knowledge
of plate tectonic processes you ve gained from this chapter, understanding the
history and development of ocean floor features in various marine provinces
will be a much simpler task.

Chapter in Review

According to the theory of plate tectonics, the outermost portion of Earth
is  composed  of  a  patchwork  of  thin, rigid  lithospheric  plates  that  move
horizontally with respect to one another. The idea began as a hypothesis
called continental drift proposed by Alfred Wegener at the start of the 20th
century. He suggested that about 200 million years ago, all the continents
were combined into one large continent (Pangaea) surrounded by a single
large ocean (Panthalassa).

Many lines of evidence were used to support the idea of continental
including  the  similar  shape  of  nearby  continents, matching
drift,
sequences of rocks and mountain chains, glacial ages and other climate
evidence, and  the  distribution  of  fossil  and  present-day  organisms.
Although this evidence suggested that continents have drifted, other
incorrect assumptions about the mechanism involved caused many geol-
ogists and geophysicists to discount this hypothesis throughout the first
half of the 20th century.

More convincing evidence for drifting continents was introduced in the
1960s, when paleomagnetism the  study of Earth s ancient  magnetic
field was developed and the significance of features of the ocean floor
became better known. The paleomagnetism of the ocean floor is perma-
nently  recorded  in  oceanic  crust  and  reveals  stripes  of  normal  and
reverse magnetic polarity in a symmetric pattern relative to the mid-
ocean ridge.

Harry Hess advanced the idea of sea floor spreading. New sea floor
is created at the crest of the mid-ocean ridge and moves apart in oppo-
site directions  and  is  eventually  destroyed  by  subduction  into  an
ocean trench. This  helps  explain  the  pattern  of  magnetic  stripes  on

the sea floor and why sea floor rocks increase linearly in age in either
direction  from  the  axis  of  the  mid-ocean  ridge. Other  supporting
evidence for plate tectonics includes oceanic heat flow measurements
and the pattern of worldwide earthquakes. The combination of evidence
convinced geologists of Earth s dynamic nature and helped advance the
idea  of  continental  drift  into  the  more  encompassing  plate  tectonic
theory.

As new crust is added to the lithosphere at the mid-ocean ridge (divergent
boundaries where plates move apart), the opposite ends of the plates are
subducted into the mantle at ocean trenches or beneath continental mountain
ranges such as the Himalayas (convergent boundaries where plates come
together). Additionally, oceanic ridges and rises are offset and plates slide
past one another along transform faults (transform boundaries where plates
slowly grind past one another).

Tests of the plate tectonic model indicate that many features and phenom-
ena provide support for shifting plates. These include mantle plumes and
their associated hotspots that record the motion of plates past them, the
origin of flat-topped tablemounts, stages of coral reef development, and
the detection of plate motion by accurate positioning of locations on Earth
using satellites.

The  positions  of  various  sea  floor  and  continental  features  have
changed in the past, continue to change today, and will look very different
in the future.

The North Atlantic Sea Floor.

The sea floor has many interesting features, some of 
which are completely different from those on land. 
Recent improvements in technology have aided exploration
of the sea floor and given scientists the ability to create
high-resolution maps like this one, which shows deep 
areas in dark blue and shallow areas in yellow-green; 
high elevations on land are shown in pink.

Could the waters of the Atlantic be drawn off so as to expose to view this
great sea-gash which separates the continents, and extends from the Arctic
to the Antarctic, it would present a scene most rugged, grand, and
imposing.

tonic processes.

MARINE PROVINCES

What  does  the  shape  of  the  ocean  floor  look  like?  Over  a  century  and  a  half  ago, most  scientists
believed that the ocean floor was completely flat and carpeted with a thick layer of muddy sediment
containing little of scientific interest. Further, it was believed that the deepest parts were somewhere
in the middle of the ocean basins. However, as more and more vessels crisscrossed the seas to map
the ocean floor and to lay transoceanic cables, scientists found the terrain of the sea floor was highly
varied and included deep troughs, ancient volcanoes, submarine canyons, and great mountain chains.
It was unlike anything on land and, as it turns out, some of the deepest parts of the oceans are actually
very close to land!

As marine geologists and oceanographers began to analyze the features of the ocean floor, they
realized that certain features had profound implications not only for the history of the ocean floor,
but also for the history of Earth. How could all these remarkable features have formed, and how can
their origin be explained? Over long periods of time, the shape of the ocean basins has changed as
continents  have  ponderously  migrated  across  Earth s  surface  in  response  to  forces  within  Earth s
interior. The ocean basins as they presently exist reflect the processes of plate tectonics (the topic of
the previous chapter), which help explain the origin of sea floor features.

Soundings
The first recorded attempt to measure the ocean s depth was conducted in the Mediterranean Sea
in  about  85  B.C. by  a  Greek  named  Posidonius. His  mission  was  to  answer  an  age-old  question:
How deep  is  the  ocean?  Posidonius s  crew  made  a  sounding1 by  letting  out  nearly  2  kilometers

1A sounding refers to a probe of the environment for scientific observation and was borrowed from atmospheric scientists,
who released probes called soundings into the atmosphere. Ironically, the term does not actually refer to sound; the use of
sound to measure ocean depths came later.

Sonar and Echolocation

(1.2 miles)  of  line  before  the  heavy  weight  on  the  end  of  the  line  touched
bottom. Sounding  lines  were  used  for  the  next  2000  years  by  voyagers  who
used them to probe the ocean s depths. The standard unit of ocean depth is the
fathom (fathme * outstretched arms2), which is equal to 1.8 meters (6 feet).

The first systematic bathymetric measurements of the oceans were made in
1872  aboard  the  HMS  Challenger, during  its  historic  three-and-a-half-year  voy-
age.3 Every  so  often, Challenger s  crew  stopped  and  measured  the  depth, along
with many other ocean properties. These measurements indicated that the deep-
ocean floor was not flat but had significant relief (variations in elevation), just as
dry land does. However, determining bathymetry by making occasional soundings
rarely gives a complete picture of the ocean floor. For instance, imagine trying to
determine what the surface features on land look like while flying in a blimp at an
altitude of several kilometers on a foggy night, using only a long weighted rope to
determine your height above the surface. This is similar to how bathymetric meas-
urements were collected from ships using sounding lines.

Echo Soundings
The presence of mid-ocean undersea mountains had long
been  known, but  recognition  of  their  full  extent  into  a
connected  worldwide  system  had  to  await  the  invention
and  use  of  the  echo  sounder, or  fathometer, in  the  early
1900s. An  echo  sounder  sends  a  sound  signal  (called
a ping)  from  the  ship  downward  into  the  ocean, where
it produces  echoes  when  it  bounces  off  any  density
difference, such  as  marine  organisms  or  the  ocean  floor
(Figure 3.1). Water is a good transmitter of sound, so the
time  it  takes  for  the  echoes  to  return4 is  used  to  deter-
mine  the  depth  and  corresponding  shape  of  the  ocean
floor. In  1925, for  example, the  German  vessel  Meteor
used echo sounding to identify the underwater mountain
range  running  through  the  center  of  the  South  Atlantic
Ocean.

Echo sounding, however, lacks detail and often gives an
inaccurate  view  of  the  relief  of  the  sea  floor. For  instance,
the  sound  beam  emitted  from  a  ship  4000  meters  (13,100  feet)  above  the  ocean
floor  widens  to  a  diameter  of  about  4600  meters  (15,000  feet)  at  the  bottom.
Consequently, the first echoes to return from the bottom are usually from the clos-
est (highest) peak within this broad area. Nonetheless, most of our knowledge of
ocean bathymetry has been provided by the echo sounder.

Because sound from echo sounders bounces off any density difference, it was
discovered that echo sounders could detect and track submarines. During World
War II, antisubmarine warfare inspired many improvements in the technology of

seeing into the ocean using sound.

During and after World War II, there was great improvement in sonar tech-
nology. For example, the precision depth recorder (PDR), which was developed
in the 1950s, uses a focused high-frequency sound beam to measure depths to a
resolution  of  about  1  meter  (3.3  feet). Throughout  the  1960s, PDRs  were  used

2This term is derived from the method used to bring depth sounding lines back on board a vessel by
hand. While hauling in the line, workers counted the number of arm-lengths collected. By measuring
the length of the person s outstretched arms, the amount of line taken in could be calculated. Much
later, the distance of 1 fathom was standardized to equal exactly 6 feet.
3For more information about the accomplishments of the Challenger expedition, see Box 5.2.
4This technique uses the speed of sound in seawater, which varies with salinity, pressure, and temperature
but averages about 1507 meters (4945 feet) per second.

extensively and provided a reasonably good representa-
tion of the ocean floor. From thousands of research ves-
sel tracks, the first reliable global maps of sea floor ba-
thymetry  were  produced. These  maps  helped  confirm
the ideas of sea floor spreading and plate tectonics.

Modern  acoustic (akouein * to  hear)  instruments
that  use  sound  to  map  the  sea  floor  include  multibeam
echo  sounders (which  use multiple  frequencies  of  sound
simultaneously)  and  side-scan  sonar (an  acronym  for
sound navigation and ranging). Seabeam the first multi-
beam echo sounder made it possible for a survey ship to
map the features of the ocean floor along a strip up to 60
kilometers (37 miles) wide. Multibeam systems use sound
emitters directed away from both sides of a survey ship,
with  receivers  permanently  mounted  on  the  ship s  hull.
Multibeam  instruments  emit  multiple  beams  of  sound
waves, which  are  reflected  off  the  ocean  floor. As  the
sound  waves  bounce  back  with  different  strengths  and
timing, computers analyze these differences to determine
the depth and shape of the sea floor, and whether the bot-
tom is rock, sand, or mud (Figure 3.2). In this way, multi-
beam  surveying  provides  incredibly  detailed  imagery  of
the seabed. Because its beams of sound spread out with depth, multibeam systems
have resolution limitations in deep water.

In deep water or where a detailed survey is required, side-scan sonar can pro-
vide enhanced views of the sea floor. Side-scan sonar systems such as Sea MARC
(Sea Mapping  and  Remote  Characterization)  and  GLORIA (Geological  Long-
Range Inclined Acoustical instrument) can be towed behind a survey ship to pro-
duce a detailed strip map of ocean floor bathymetry (Figure 3.3). To maximize its

can produce a detailed image of sea floor bathymetry.

SEA FLOOR MAPPING FROM SPACE

Recently, satellite  measurements  of  the
ocean  surface  have  been  used  to  make
maps  of  the  sea  floor. How  does  a  satel-
lite which  orbits  at  a  great  distance
above  the  planet  and  can  view  only  the
ocean s  surface obtain  a  picture  of  the
sea floor?

The  answer  lies  in  the  fact  that  sea
floor  features  directly  influence  Earth s
gravitational  field. Deep  areas  such  as
trenches  correspond  to  a  lower  gravita-
tional attraction, and large undersea objects

such as seamounts exert an extra gravita-
tional  pull. These  differences  affect  sea
level, causing  the  ocean  surface  to  bulge
outward  and  sink  inward  mimicking  the
relief  of  the  ocean  floor. A  2000-meter
(6500-foot)-high  seamount, for  example,
exerts a small but measurable
gravitational pull on the water
around  it, creating  a  bulge  2
meters  (7  feet)  high  on  the
ocean  surface. These  irregu-
larities  are  easily  detectable

by satellites, which  use  microwave beams
to measure sea level to within 4 centime-
ters  (1.5  inches)  accuracy. After  correc-
tions  are  made  for  waves, tides, currents,
and  atmospheric  effects,

resolution, a side-scan instrument can be towed behind a ship on a cable so that it

flies just above the ocean floor.

Although multibeam and side-scan sonar produce very detailed bathymetric
maps, mapping the sea floor by ship is an expensive and time-consuming process.
A  research  vessel  must  tediously  travel  back  and  forth  throughout  an  area 
(a process called  mowing the lawn ) to produce an accurate map of bathymetric

ocean  floor  bathymetry  (Figure  3A). For
example, Figure  3B compares  two  differ-
ent maps of the same area: one based on
bathymetric data from ships (top) and the
other  based  on  satellite  measurements
(bottom), which shows much higher reso-
lution of sea floor features.

mation  was  recently  declassified, Walter
Smith  of  the  National  Oceanic  and
Atmospheric  Administration  and  David
Sandwell  of  Scripps 
Institution  of
Oceanography began producing sea floor
maps  based  on  the  shape  of  the  sea  sur-
face. What  is  unique  about  these  re-
searchers   maps  is  that  they  provide  a
view  of  Earth  similar  to  being  able  to
drain  the  oceans  and  view  the  ocean
floor directly. Their map of ocean surface
gravity (Figure 3C) uses depth soundings

to  calibrate  the  gravity  measurements.
Although  gravity  is  not  exactly  bathyme-
try, this new map of the ocean floor clearly
delineates  many  ocean  floor  features,
such as  the  mid-ocean  ridge, trenches,
seamounts, and nemataths (island chains).
In  addition, this  new  mapping  technique
has  revealed  sea  floor  bathymetry  in
areas where  research  vessels  have  not
conducted surveys.

features  (see  Figure  3.2). Unfortunately, only  a  small  percentage  of  the  ocean
floor has been mapped in this way. An Earth-orbiting satellite, on the other hand,
can observe large areas of the ocean at one time. Consequently, satellites are in-
creasingly used to determine ocean properties. Remarkably, technology exists to
allow the ocean floor to be mapped by an orbiting satellite (Box 3.1). Recent U.S.
oceanographic satellite missions and their objectives are listed in Web Table 3.1.

Sending pings of sound into the ocean (echo sound-

Seismic Reflection Profiles
Oceanographers  who  want  to  know  about
ocean  structure  beneath  the  sea  floor  use
strong  low-frequency  sounds  produced  by  ex-
plosions  or  air  guns, as  shown  in  Figure  3.4.
These sounds penetrate beneath the sea floor
and  reflect  off  the boundaries between differ-
ent rock or sediment layers, producing seismic
reflection  profiles, which  have  applications  in
mineral and petroleum exploration.

3.2 What Does Earth s

Hypsographic
Curve Reveal?

Figure  3.5 illustrates  Earth s  hypsographic
(hypos * height, graphic * drawn) curve, which
shows the relationship between the height of the
land and the depth of the oceans. The bar graph
(Figure  3.5, left  side)  gives  the  percentage  of
Earth s surface area at various ranges of elevation
and depth.The cumulative curve (Figure 3.5, right
side) gives the percentage of surface area from the
highest peaks to the deepest depths of the oceans.
Together, they show that 70.8% of Earth s surface
is covered by oceans and that the average depth of
the ocean is 3729 meters (12,234 feet) while the
average  height  of  the  land  is  only  840  meters
(2756 feet). The difference, recalling our discus-
sion  of  isostasy  in  Chapter  1, results  from  the
greater  density  and  lesser  thickness  of  oceanic
crust as compared to continental crust.

The  cumulative  hypsographic  curve  (Fig-
ure 3.5, right side) shows five differently sloped
segments. On  land, the  first  steep  segment  of
the  curve  represents  tall  mountains, while  the
gentle slope represents low coastal plains (and
continues  just  offshore, representing  the  shal-
low parts of the continental margin). The first slope below sea level represents steep
areas  of  the  continental  margins  and  also  includes  the  mountainous  mid-ocean
ridge. Further offshore, the longest, flattest part of the whole curve represents the
deep-ocean basins, followed by the last steep part, which represents ocean trenches.
The shape of the hypsographic curve can be used to support the existence of plate
tectonics on Earth. Specifically, the two flat areas and three sloped areas of the curve
show that there is a very uneven distribution of area at different depths and eleva-
tions. If there were no active mechanism involved in creating such features on Earth,
the bar graph portions would all be about the same length and the cumulative curve
would be a straight line. Instead, the variations in the curve suggest that plate tectonics
is actively working to modify Earth s surface. The flat portions of the curve represent
various  intraplate  elevations  both  on  land  and  underwater  while  the  slopes  of  the
curve represent mountains, continental slopes, the mid-ocean ridge, and deep-ocean
trenches, all  of  which  are  created  by  plate  tectonic  processes. Interestingly, hypso-
graphic curves constructed for other planets and moons using satellite data have been
used to determine if plate tectonics is actively modifying the surface of these worlds.

The  ocean  floor  can  be  divided  into  three  major  provinces  (Figure  3.6):
(1) continental  margins, which  are  shallow-water  areas  close  to  continents,
(2) deep-ocean basins, which are deep-water areas farther from land, and (3) the

ocean. Plate tectonic processes (discussed in the previous chapters) are integral to
the formation of these provinces. Through the process of sea floor spreading, mid-
ocean ridges and deep-ocean basins are created. Elsewhere, as a continent is split
apart, new continental margins are formed.

Passive Versus Active Continental Margins
Continental  margins  can  be  classified  as  either  passive  or  active, depending  on
their proximity to plate boundaries. Passive margins (Figure 3.7, left side) are em-
bedded  within  the  interior  of  lithospheric  plates  and  are  therefore  not  in  close
proximity to any plate boundary. Thus, passive margins usually lack major tectonic
activity (such as large earthquakes, eruptive volcanoes, and mountain building).

The East Coast of the United States, where there is no plate boundary, is an
example of a passive continental margin. Passive margins are usually produced by
rifting of continental landmasses and continued sea floor spreading over geologic
time. Features  of  passive  continental  margins  include  the  continental  shelf, the
continental  slope, and  the  continental  rise  that  extends  toward  the  deep-ocean
basins (Figures 3.7 and 3.8).

Active margins (Figure 3.7, right side) are associated with lithospheric plate
boundaries  and  are  marked  by  a  high  degree  of  tectonic  activity. Two  types  of
active  margins  exist. Convergent  active  margins are  associated  with  oceanic
continental convergent plate boundaries. From the land to the ocean, features in-
clude an onshore arc-shaped row of active volcanoes, then a narrow shelf, a steep
slope, and an offshore trench that delineates the plate boundary. Western South
America, where the Nazca Plate is being subducted beneath the South American
Plate, is an example of a convergent active margin. Transform active margins are
less common and are associated with transform plate boundaries. At these loca-
tions, offshore faults usually parallel the main transform plate boundary fault and
create linear islands, banks (shallowly submerged areas), and deep basins close to
shore. Coastal California along the San Andreas Fault is an example of a trans-
form active margin.

Continental Shelf
The continental shelf is defined as a generally flat zone extending from the shore
beneath the ocean surface to a point at which a marked increase in slope angle
occurs, called the shelf break (Figure 3.8). It is usually flat and relatively feature-
less  because  of  marine  sediment  deposits  but  can  contain  coastal  islands, reefs,
and raised banks. The underlying rock is granitic continental crust, so the conti-
nental shelf is geologically part of the continent. Accurate sea floor mapping is es-
sential  for  determining the  extent of  the continental  shelf, which has  come  into
question recently in the Arctic Ocean. The general bathymetry of the continental
shelf can usually be predicted by examining the topography of the adjacent land.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Passive continental margins lack a plate boundary
and have different features than active continental
margins, which include a plate boundary 
(either convergent or transform).

With few exceptions, the coastal topography extends beyond the shore and onto
the continental shelf.

The average width of the continental shelf is about 70 kilometers (43 miles), but
it  varies  from  a  few  tens  of  meters  to  1500  kilometers  (930  miles). The  broadest
shelves  occur  off  the  northern  coasts  of  Siberia  and  North America  in  the Arctic
Ocean. The average depth at which the shelf break occurs is about 135 meters (443
feet). Around the continent of Antarctica, however, the shelf break occurs at 350 me-
ters (2200 feet). The average slope of the continental shelf is only about a tenth of a
degree, which is similar to the slope given to a large parking lot for drainage purposes.

FIGURE 3.9 Continental borderland. A continental 
borderland, like the one offshore Southern California, con-
sists of a series of islands, shallow banks, and deep basins.
It is a result of its proximity to the San Andreas Fault, a
major transform plate boundary.

Sea  level  has  fluctuated  over  the  history  of  Earth,
causing the shoreline to migrate back and forth across the
continental  shelf. When  colder  climates  prevailed  during
the most recent ice age, for example, more of Earth s water
was frozen as glaciers on land, so sea level was lower than
it is today. During that time, more of the continental shelf
was exposed.

The  type  of  continental  margin  will  determine  the
shape and features associated with the continental shelf.
For  example, the  east  coast  of  South  America  has  a
broader  continental  shelf  than  its  west  coast. The  east
coast  is  a  passive  margin, which  typically  has  a  wider
shelf. In contrast, the convergent active margin present
along the west coast of South America is characterized
by a narrow continental shelf and a shelf break close to
shore. For  transform  active  margins  such  as  along
California, the  presence  of  offshore  faults  produces  a
continental shelf that is not flat. Rather, it is marked by
a high degree of relief (islands, shallow banks, and deep
basins) called a continental borderland (Figure 3.9).

Continental Slope
The  continental  slope, which  lies  beyond  the
shelf  break,
is  where  the  deep-ocean  basins
begin. Total relief in this region is similar to that
found in mountain ranges on the continents. The
break at the top of the slope may be from 1 to 5
kilometers (0.6 to 3 miles) above the deep-ocean

basin at its base. Along convergent active margins where the slope de-
scends into submarine trenches, even greater vertical relief is measured.
Off the west coast of South America, for instance, the total relief from
the top of the Andes Mountains to the bottom of the Peru Chile Trench
is about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles).

Worldwide, the slope of the continental slopes averages about 4 de-
grees but varies from 1 to 25 degrees.5 A study that compared different con-
tinental slopes in the United States revealed that the average
slope is just over 2 degrees.Around the margin of the Pacific
Ocean, the  continental  slopes  average  more  than  5  de-
grees because of the presence of convergent active mar-
gins that drop directly into deep offshore trenches. The
Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the other hand, contain
many  passive  margins, which  lack  plate  boundaries.
Thus, the amount of relief is lower and slopes in these

oceans average about 3 degrees.

river valleys created by the erosive power of rivers when sea level was lower and
the continental shelf was exposed. Although some canyons are directly offshore
from where rivers enter the sea, the majority of them are not. Many, in fact, are
confined exclusively to the continental slope. In addition, submarine canyons con-
tinue  to  the  base  of  the  continental  slope, which  averages  some  3500  meters
(11,500  feet)  below  sea  level. There  is  no  evidence, however, that  sea  level  has
ever been lowered by that much.

Side-scan sonar surveys along the Atlantic coast indicate that the continental
slope is dominated by submarine canyons from Hudson Canyon near New York
City  to  Baltimore  Canyon  in  Maryland. Canyons  confined  to  the  continental
slope are straighter and have steeper canyon floor gradients than those that ex-
tend into the continental shelf. These characteristics suggest the canyons are cre-
ated on the continental slope by some marine process and enlarge into the conti-
nental shelf through time.

Both  indirect  and  direct  observation  of  the  erosive  power  of  turbidity
(turbidus * disordered) currents (Box 3.2) has suggested that they are responsi-
ble for carving submarine canyons. Turbidity currents are underwater avalanches
of muddy water mixed with rocks and other debris. The sediment portion of tur-
bidity currents comes from sea floor materials that move across the continental
shelf into the head of a submarine canyon and accumulate there, setting the stage
for initiation of a turbidity current. Trigger mechanisms for turbidity currents in-
clude shaking by an earthquake, the oversteepening of sediment that accumulates
on  the  shelf, hurricanes  passing  over  the  area, and  the  rapid  input  of  sediment
from flood waters. Once a turbidity current is set in motion, the dense mixture of
water and debris moves rapidly downslope under the force of gravity and carves
the  canyon  as  it  goes, resembling  a  flash  flood  on  land. Turbidity  currents  are
strong enough to transport huge rocks down submarine canyons and do a consid-
erable amount of erosion over time.

Continental Rise
The continental rise is a transition zone between the continental margin and the
deep-ocean floor comprised of a huge submerged pile of debris. Where did all this
debris come from, and how did it get there?

The existence of turbidity currents suggests that the material transported by
these currents is responsible for the creation of continental rises. When a turbidity
current  moves  through  and  erodes  a  submarine  canyon, it  exits  through  the
mouth of the canyon. The slope angle decreases and the turbidity current slows,
causing  suspended  material  to  settle  out  in  a  distinctive  type  of  layering  called
graded bedding that grades in size upward (Figure 3.10a, inset). As the energy of
the  turbidity  current  dissipates, larger  pieces  settle  first, then  progressively
smaller pieces settle, and eventually even very fine pieces settle out, which may
occur weeks or months later.

An  individual  turbidity  current  deposits  one  graded  bedding  sequence. The
next turbidity current may partially erode the previous deposit and then deposit
another graded bedding sequence on top of the previous one. After some time, a
thick  sequence  of  graded  bedding  deposits  can  develop  one  on  top  of  another.
These  stacks  of  graded  bedding  are  called  turbidite  deposits (Figure  3.10c), of
which the continental rise is composed.

As viewed from above, the deposits at the mouths of submarine canyons are
fan, lobate, or apron shaped (Figure 3.10a and 3.10e). Consequently, these deposits
are called deep-sea fans, or submarine fans. Deep-sea fans create the continental
rise  when  they  merge  together  along  the  base  of  the  continental  slope. Along
convergent  active  margins, however, the  steep  continental  slope  leads  directly
into  a  deep-ocean  trench. Sediment  from  turbidity  currents  accumulates  in  the
trench and there is no continental rise.

A GRAND  BREAK : EVIDENCE FOR TURBIDITY CURRENTS

w

How  do  earthquakes  and  telephone  ca-
bles  help  explain  how  turbidity  currents
move  across  the  ocean  floor  and  carve
submarine canyons? In 1929, the M
* 7.2
Grand  Banks  earthquake  in  the  North
Atlantic Ocean severed some of the trans-
Atlantic  telegraph  cables  that  lay  across
the sea floor south of Newfoundland near
the earthquake epicenter (Figure 3D). At
first, it  was  assumed  that  sea  floor  move-
ment  caused  all  these  breaks. However,
analysis  of  the  data  revealed  that  the  ca-
bles  closest  to  the  earthquake  broke  si-
multaneously with the earthquake, but ca-
bles  that  crossed  the  slope  and  deeper
ocean  floor  at  greater  distances  from  the
earthquake  were  broken  progressively

later  in  time. It  seemed  unusual  that  cer-
tain cables were affected by the failure of
the slope due to ground shaking  but oth-
ers were broken several minutes later.

The mystery was solved several years
later, when  reanalysis  of  the  event  sug-
gested  that  the  earthquake  triggered  a
major submarine landslide and initiated a
turbidity current, which moved down the
slope and was responsible for the succes-
sive  cable  breaks. How  fast  do  turbidity
currents  move?  By  studying  the  pattern
of  broken  cables, scientists  determined
that  the  turbidity  current  in  this  case
reached speeds of about 80 kilometers (50
miles)  per  hour  on  the  steep  portions  of
the  continental  slope  and  about  24  kilo-

meters  (15  miles)  per  hour  on  the  more
gently  sloping  continental  rise. The  study
showed  that  turbidity  currents  can  reach
high  speeds  and  are  strong  enough  to
break  underwater  cables, suggesting  that
they  must  be  powerful  enough  to  erode
submarine canyons.

Further  evidence  of  turbidity  currents
comes from several sonar studies that have
documented turbidity currents. For instance,
a study of Rupert Inlet in British Columbia,
Canada, monitored  turbidity  currents  mov-
ing  through  an  underwater  channel. These
studies indicate that submarine canyons are
carved by turbidity currents over long peri-
ods  of  time, just  as  canyons  on  land  are
carved by running water.

One of the largest deep-sea fans in the world is the Indus Fan, a passive margin
fan that extends 1800 kilometers (1100 miles) south of Pakistan (Figure 3.10d). The
Indus River carries extensive amounts of sediment from the Himalaya Mountains to
the coast. This sediment eventually makes its way down the submarine canyon and
builds the fan, which, in some areas, has sediment that is more than 10 kilometers (6.2
miles) thick. The Indus Fan has a main submarine canyon channel extending seaward
onto the fan but soon divides into several branching distributary channels. These dis-
tributary channels are similar to those found on deltas, which form at the mouths of
streams. On the lower fan, the surface has a very low slope, and the flow is no longer

confined to channels, so it spreads out and forms lay-
ers of fine sediment across the fan surface. The Indus
Fan  has  so  much  sediment, in  fact, that  it partially
buries an active mid-ocean ridge, the Carlsberg Ridge!

3.4 What Features Exist

in the Deep-Ocean
Basins?

The  deep-ocean  floor  lies  beyond  the  continental
margin province (the shelf, slope, and the rise) and
contains a variety of features.

Abyssal Plains
Extending from the base of the continental rise into
the deep-ocean basins are flat depositional surfaces
with  slopes  of  less  than  a  fraction of  a  degree  that
cover  extensive  portions  of  the  deep-ocean  basins.
These abyssal (a * without, byssus * bottom) plains
average  between  4500  meters  (15,000  feet)  and
6000  meters  (20,000  feet)  deep. They  are  not  liter-
ally  bottomless, but  they  are  some  of  the  deepest
(and flattest) regions on Earth.

Abyssal plains are formed by fine particles of sediment slowly drifting onto
the  deep-ocean  floor. Over  millions  of  years, a  thick  blanket  of  sediment  is
produced  by  suspension  settling as  fine  particles  (analogous  to  marine  dust )
accumulate  on  the  ocean  floor. With  enough  time, these  deposits  cover  most
irregularities  of  the  deep  ocean, as  shown  in  Figure  3.12. In  addition, sediment
traveling in turbidity currents from land adds to the sediment load.

The type of continental margin determines the distribution of abyssal plains.
For  instance, few  abyssal  plains  are  located  in  the  Pacific  Ocean; instead, most
occur in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The deep-ocean trenches found on the
convergent  active  margins  of  the  Pacific  Ocean  prevent  sediment  from  moving
past the continental slope. In essence, the trenches act like a gutter that traps sed-
iment  transported  off  the  land  by  turbidity  currents. On  the  passive  margins  of
the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, however, turbidity currents travel directly down
the  continental  margin  and  deposit  sediment  on  the  abyssal  plains. In  addition,
the distance from the continental margin to the floor of the deep-ocean basins in
the  Pacific  Ocean  is  so  great  that  most  of  the  suspended  sediment  settles  out
before it reaches these distant regions. Conversely, the smaller size of the Atlantic
and  Indian  Oceans  does  not  prevent  suspended  sediment  from  reaching  their
deep-ocean basins.

Volcanic Peaks of the Abyssal Plains
Poking through the sediment cover of the abyssal plains are a variety of volcanic
peaks, which  extend  to  various  elevations  above  the  ocean  floor. Some  extend
above sea level to form islands while others are just below the surface (see Web
Box 3.2). Those that are below sea level but rise more than 1 kilometer (0.6 mile)
above the deep-ocean floor and have a pointy top like an upside-down ice cream
cone  are  called  seamounts. Worldwide, there  are  more  than  50,000  known
seamounts, and  scientists  estimate  that  seamounts  could  number  as  high  as
200,000. On  the  other  hand, if  a  volcano  has  a  flattened  top, it  is  called  a

the  minimum  height  of  a  seamount

tablemount, or guyot. The origin of seamounts and tablemounts was discussed as a
piece of supporting evidence for plate tectonics in Chapter 2 (refer to Figure 2.26).
Volcanic features on the ocean floor that are less than 1000 meters (0.6 mile)
tall
are  called  abyssal  hills, or  seaknolls.
Abyssal hills are one of the most abundant features on the planet (several hun-
dred thousand have been identified) and cover a large percentage of the entire
ocean basin floor. Many are gently rounded in shape, and they have an average
height of about 200 meters (650 feet). Most abyssal hills are created by stretching
of crust during the creation of new sea floor at the mid-ocean ridge.

In  the  Atlantic  and  Pacific  Oceans, many  abyssal  hills  are  found  buried
beneath  abyssal  plain  sediment. In  the  Pacific  Ocean, the  abundance  of  active
margins  traps  land-derived  sediment  and  so  the  rate  of  sediment  deposition  is
lower. Consequently, extensive regions dominated by abyssal hills have resulted;
these  are  called  abyssal  hill  provinces. The  evidence  of  volcanic  activity  on  the
bottom of the Pacific Ocean is particularly widespread. In fact, more than 20,000
volcanic peaks are known to exist on the Pacific sea floor.

Ocean Trenches and Volcanic Arcs
Along passive margins, the continental rise commonly occurs at the base of the
continental  slope  and  merges  smoothly  into  the  abyssal  plain. In  convergent
active  margins, however, the  slope  descends  into  a  long, narrow, steep-sided
ocean trench. Ocean trenches are deep linear scars in the ocean floor, caused
by the collision of two plates along convergent plate margins (as discussed in
Chapter  2). The  landward  side  of  the  trench  rises  as  a  volcanic  arc that  may
produce  islands  (such  as  the  islands  of  Japan, an  island  arc)  or  a  volcanic
mountain range along the margin of a continent (such as the Andes Mountains,
a continental arc).

The  deepest  portions  of  the  world s  oceans  are  found  in  these  trenches. In
fact, the deepest point on Earth s surface
is found
in  the  Challenger  Deep  area  of  the  Mariana  Trench. The  majority  of  ocean
trenches  are  found  along  the  margins  of  the  Pacific  Ocean  (Figure  3.13), while
only a few exist in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

THE  PACIFIC  RING  OF  FIRE The Pacific Ring of Fire occurs along the margins
of  the  Pacific  Ocean. It  has  the  majority  of  Earth s  active  volcanoes  and  large
earthquakes  because  of  the  prevalence  of  convergent  plate  boundaries  along
the Pacific  Rim. A  part  of  the  Pacific  Ring  of  Fire  is  South America s  western
coast, including  the  Andes  Mountains  and  the  associated  Peru Chile  Trench.
Figure  3.14 shows  a  cross-sectional  view  of  this  area  and  illustrates  the
tremendous amount of relief at convergent plate boundaries where deep-ocean
trenches are associated with tall volcanic arcs.

3.5 What Features Exist Along 

the Mid-Ocean Ridge?

The  global  mid-ocean  ridge  is  a  continuous, fractured-looking  mountain  ridge
that  extends  through  all  the  ocean  basins. The  portion  of  the  mid-ocean  ridge
found in the North Atlantic Ocean is called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Figure 3.15),
which dwarfs all mountain ranges on land. As discussed in Chapter 2, the mid-ocean
ridge results from sea floor spreading along divergent plate boundaries. The enor-
mous  mid-ocean  ridge  forms  Earth s  longest  mountain  chain, extending  across
some 75,000 kilometers (46,600 miles) of the deep-ocean basin. The width of the
mid-ocean ridge averages about 1000 kilometers (620 miles). The mid-ocean ridge
is a topographically high feature, extending an average of 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles)

above the  surrounding  sea  floor. The  mid-ocean  ridge  contains  only a  few  scat-
tered  islands, such  as  Iceland  and  the  Azores, where  it  peeks  above  sea  level.
Remarkably, the mid-ocean ridge covers 23% of Earth s surface.
The mid-ocean ridge is entirely volcanic and is composed of
basaltic lavas characteristic of the oceanic crust. Along most of its
crest  is  a  central  downdropped  rift  valley created  by  sea  floor
spreading  (rifting)  where  two  plates  diverge  (see, for  example,
Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16). Along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, for
example, is  a  central  rift  valley  that  is  as  much  as  30  kilometers 
(20 miles) wide and 3 kilometers (2 miles) deep. Here, molten rock
presses upward toward the sea floor, setting off earthquakes, creat-
ing  jets  of  superheated  seawater, and  eventually  solidifying  to
form new oceanic crust. Cracks called fissures (fissus * split) and
faults are commonly observed in the central rift valley. Swarms of
small earthquakes occur along the central rift valley caused by the
injection of magma into the sea floor or rifting along faults.

What effect does all this volcanic activity along the
mid-ocean ridge have at the oceans surface?

Sometimes  an  underwater  volcanic  eruption  is  large
enough  to  create  what  is  called  a  megaplume of
warm, mineral-rich water that is lower in density than
the  surrounding  seawater  and  thus  rises  to  the
surface.  Remarkably,  a  few  research  vessels  have
reported experiencing the effects of a megaplume at
the surface while directly above an erupting sea floor
volcano!  Researchers  on  board  describe  bubbles  of
gas and steam at the surface, a marked increase in
water temperature, and the presence of enough vol-
canic  material  to  turn  the  water  cloudy.  In  terms  of
warming the ocean, the heat released into the ocean
at  mid-ocean  ridges  is  probably  not  very  significant,
mostly  because  the  ocean  is  so  good  at  absorbing
and redistributing heat.

in Chapter 2, the differences in overall shape are caused by
the fact that oceanic ridges (such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge)
spread  more  slowly  than  oceanic  rises  (such  as  the  East
Pacific Rise).

Volcanic Features
Volcanic features associated with the mid-ocean ridge include
tall  volcanoes  called  seamounts6 (Figure  3.16a)  and  recent
underwater lava flows. When hot basaltic lava spills onto the
sea floor, it is exposed to cold seawater that chills the margins
of the lava. This creates  pillow lavas or pillow basalts, which
are  smooth, rounded  lobes  of  rock  that  resemble  a  stack  of
bed pillows (Figure 3.16b and 3.16c).

Although  most  people  are  usually  not  aware  of  it, fre-
quent volcanic activity is common along the mid-ocean ridge.
In fact, 80% of Earth s volcanic activity takes place on the sea
floor, and  every  year  about  12  cubic  kilometers  (3  cubic
miles)  of  molten  rock  erupts  underwater. The  amount  of
erupted lava along the mid-ocean ridge is large enough to fill
an  Olympic-sized  swimming  pool  every  three  seconds!
Bathymetric  studies  along  the  Juan  de  Fuca  Ridge  off
Washington  and  Oregon, for  example, revealed  that  50  mil-
lion cubic meters (1800 million cubic feet) of new lava were released sometime be-
tween  1981  and  1987. Subsequent  surveys  of  the  area  indicated  many  changes
along the mid-ocean ridge, including new volcanic features, recent lava flows, and
depth changes of up to 37 meters (121 feet). Interest in the continuing volcanic ac-
tivity along the Juan de Fuca Ridge has led to the development of a permanent sea
floor observation system there (see Box 2.2). Other parts of the mid-ocean ridge,
such as East Pacific Rise, also experience frequent volcanic activity (Box 3.3).

Hydrothermal Vents
Other  features  in  the  central  rift  valley  include  hydrothermal  (hydro * water,
thermo * heat) vents. Hydrothermal vents are sea floor hot springs created when
cold  seawater  seeps  down  along  cracks  and  fractures  in  the  ocean  crust  and  ap-
proaches an underground magma chamber (Figure 3.17). The water picks up heat

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

Has anyone seen pillow lava forming?

Amazingly, yes! In the 1960s, an underwater film crew ventured to Hawaii
during an eruption of the volcano Kilauea, where lava spilled into the sea.
They braved high water temperatures and risked being burned on the red-
hot lava but filmed some incredible footage. Underwater, the formation of
pillow lava occurs where a tube emits molten lava directly into the ocean.
When hot lava comes into contact with cold seawater, it forms the charac-
teristic smooth and rounded margins of pillow basalt. The divers also exper-
imented with a hammer on newly formed pillows and were able to initiate
new lava outpourings.

6In a number of cases, researchers have discovered seamounts that initially formed along the crest of
the mid-ocean ridge and have been split in two as the plates spread apart.

and dissolved substances and then works its way back toward the surface through
a complex plumbing system, exiting through the sea floor. The temperature of the
water that rushes out of a particular hydrothermal vent determines its appearance:

Warm-water vents have water temperatures below 30°C (86°F) and generally
emit water that is clear in color.
White smokers have water temperatures from 30° to 350°C (86° to 662°F) and
emit water that is white because of the presence of various light-colored com-
pounds, including barium sulfide.
Black smokers have water temperatures above 350°C (662°F) and emit water
that is black because of the presence of dark-colored metal sulfides, including
iron, nickel, copper, and zinc.

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

If black smokers are so hot, why isnt there steam coming out
of them instead of hot water?

Indeed, black smokers emit water that can be up to four times the boiling
point  of  water  at  the  ocean s  surface  and  hot  enough  to  melt  lead.
However, the depth where black smokers are found results in much higher
pressure  than  at  the  surface.  At  these  higher  pressures,  water  has  a
much higher boiling point. Thus, water from hydrothermal vents remains in
the liquid state instead of turning into water vapor (steam).

Many black smokers spew out of chimney-like structures (Figure 3.17b) that
can be up to 60 meters (200 feet) high and were named for their resemblance to
factory smokestacks belching clouds of smoke. The dissolved metal particles often
come out of solution, or precipitate,7 when the hot water mixes with cold seawa-
ter, creating coatings of mineral deposits on nearby rocks. Chemical analyses of
these deposits reveal that they are composed of various metal sulfides and some-
times even silver and gold.

In  addition, most  hydrothermal  vents  foster  unusual  deep-ocean  ecosystems
that include organisms such as giant tubeworms, large clams, beds of mussels, and
many other creatures most of which were new to science when they were first en-
countered. These organisms are able to survive in the absence of sunlight because
the vents discharge hydrogen sulfide gas, which is metabolized by archaeons8 and
bacteria and provides a food source for other organisms in the community. Recent
studies of active hydrothermal vent fields indicate that vents have short life spans of
only a few years to several decades, which has important implications for the organ-
isms  that  depend  on  hydrothermal  vents. The  interesting  associations  of  these
organisms are discussed in Chapter 15, Animals of the Benthic Environment.

Fracture Zones and Transform Faults
The mid-ocean ridge is cut by a number of transform faults, which offset spread-
ing  zones. Oriented  perpendicular  to  the  spreading  zones, transform  faults  give
the  mid-ocean  ridge  the  zigzag appearance  seen  in Figure 3.15. As  described in
Chapter 2, transform faults occur to accommodate spreading of a linear ridge sys-
tem on a spherical Earth and because different segments of the mid-ocean ridge
spread apart at different rates.

7A chemical precipitate is formed whenever dissolved materials change from existing in the dissolved
state to existing in the solid state.

RECOVERING OCEANOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT STUCK IN LAVA

Although  the  mid-ocean  ridge  is  one  of
the most active features on the planet and
experiences an abundance of volcanic ac-
tivity, nobody  has  ever  directly  observed
an  undersea  volcanic  eruption  there.
However, a team of oceanographers on a
research cruise to the East Pacific Rise in
2006 came close to this remarkable feat.

The  story  starts  a  year  earlier, when
scientists  deployed  12  ocean-bottom  seis-
mometers (OBSs) over a  few square kilo-
meters of sea floor along an unusually ac-
tive portion of the East Pacific Rise that is
about  725  kilometers  (450  miles)  south  of
Acapulco, Mexico, and  2.5  kilometers  (1.6
miles)  deep. The  OBSs each  about  the
size and weight of a small refrigerator are
designed to stay on the sea floor for up to a
year  and  collect  seismic  data. Researchers
returned in 2006, thinking that they would
simply  recover  the  instruments  and  send
down others. When the research vessel sent
a sonar signal to the OBSs to release their

weights and use their floats to return to the
surface, only four came bobbing up. That s
when  the  scientists  suspected  that  a  vol-
canic  eruption  had  occurred. Three  other
OBSs  responded  to  the  signal  but  did  not
come to the surface, and five other instru-
ments  were  not  heard  from, presumably
because they were buried in lava.

in  recent 

Two  months  later, scientists  returned
with  a  camera-equipped  sled  that  is  towed
behind  a  ship  and  were  able  to  locate  the
three  OBSs  embedded 
lava.
Although they tried to nudge and pry them
loose  with  the  sled, the  OBSs  were  thor-
oughly  stuck. Wanting  to  retrieve  the  stuck
OBSs with the hope that they had recorded
data while riding out an active sea floor lava
flow, the  scientists  had  to  wait  until  a  year
later, when the tethered robotic vehicle Jason
was sent down to try to free the instruments.
Using Jason s video camera and its mechani-
cal  arms  controlled  remotely  from  a  com-
mand center on the ship, the crew was able to

pry away large chunks of lava that locked the
instruments in place.After much yanking, two
of the OBSs finally broke free and rose to the
surface, with  help  from  attached  floats.
Although  the  researchers  attempted  to  free
the  third  OBS, it  was  never  recovered  be-
cause it was stuck too tightly in lava.

The  recovered  OBS 

instruments

although badly scorched from the hot lava
(Figure  3E) had  usable  data  that  have
given  researchers  new  information  about
the  volcanic  processes  that  occur  at  the
mid-ocean  ridge. This  and  other  evidence
suggests that the fresh lava had erupted for
six  hours  straight, heating  and  darkening
the water above it and spreading along the
ridge  for  more  than  16  kilometers  (10
miles).The researchers consider themselves
lucky  to  have  fortuitously  caught  Earth s
crust in the very act of ripping itself apart,
documenting  swarms  of  undersea  earth-
quakes and culminating in a volcanic erup-
tion that buried their instruments in lava.

East Pacific Rise trapped this and several other OBS in-
struments in lava. The yellow plastic covering protects
glass ball floats that are normally used to raise the
instrument to the surface; additional attached floats are
shown above the OBS. Scientists freed the device by
using a robotic vehicle to remove chunks of lava that
were embedded into the instrument and singed its outer
casing. Inset (right) shows marine geologist Dan Fornari

The mid-ocean ridge is created by plate divergence
and typically includes a central rift valley, faults and
fissures, seamounts, pillow basalts, hydrothermal
vents, and metal sulfide deposits.

On the Pacific Ocean sea floor, where scars are less rapidly covered by sedi-
ment  than  in  other  ocean  basins, transform  faults  are  prominently  displayed
(Figure 3.18). Here, they extend for thousands of kilometers away from the mid-
ocean ridge and have widths of up to 200 kilometers (120 miles). These extensions,
however, are not transform faults. Instead, they are fracture zones.

What  is  the  difference  between  a  transform  fault  and  a  fracture  zone?  Fig-
ure 3.19 shows  that  both  run  along  the  same  long  linear  zone  of  weakness  in

Earth s crust. In fact, by following the
same zone of weakness from one end
to  the  other, it  changes  from  a  frac-
ture  zone  to  a  transform  fault  and
back again to a fracture zone.A trans-
form fault is a seismically active area
that  offsets  the  axis  of  a  mid-ocean
ridge. A  fracture  zone, on  the  other
hand, is  a  seismically  inactive  area
that  shows  evidence  of  past  trans-
form  fault  activity. A  helpful  way  to
visualize  the  difference  is  that  trans-
form faults occur between offset seg-
ments  of  the  mid-ocean  ridge, while
fracture zones occur beyond the off-
set segments of the mid-ocean ridge.
The  relative  direction  of  plate
motion  across  transform  faults  and
fracture zones further differentiates
these  two  features. Across  a  trans-
form  fault, two  lithospheric  plates
(b)
are  moving  in  opposite  directions. Across  a  fracture  zone  (which  occurs  entirely
within  a  plate), there  is  no  relative  motion  because  the  parts  of  the  lithospheric
plate  cut  by  a  fracture  zone  are  moving  in  the  same  direction  (Figure  3.19).
Transform  faults  are  actual  plate  boundaries, whereas  fracture  zones  are  not.
Rather, fracture zones are ancient, inactive fault scars embedded within a plate.

In  addition, earthquake  activity  is  different  in  transform  faults  and  fracture
zones. Earthquakes shallower than 10 kilometers (6 miles) are common when plates
move  in  opposite  directions  along  transform  faults. Along  fracture  zones, where
plate motion is in the same direction, seismic activity is almost completely absent.

Oceanic Islands
Some of the most interesting features of ocean basins
are islands, which are unusually tall features that reach
from  the  sea  floor  all  the  way  above  sea  level. There
are three basic types of oceanic islands: (1) islands as-
sociated  with  volcanic  activity  along  the  mid-ocean
ridge (such as Ascension Island along the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge); (2)  islands  associated  with  hotspots  (such  as
the  Hawaiian  Islands  in  the  Pacific  Ocean); and  (3)
islands that are island arcs and associated with conver-
gent plate boundaries (such as the Aleutian Islands in
the  Pacific  Ocean). Note  that  all  three  types  are  vol-
canic  in  origin. In  addition, there  is  a  fourth  type  of
island: islands that are parts of continents (such as the British Isles off Europe),
but these occur close to shore and thus do not occur in the deep ocean.

Chapter in Review

Bathymetry  is  the  measurement  of  ocean  depths  and  the  charting  of
ocean floor topography. The varied bathymetry of the ocean floor was first
determined using soundings to measure water depth. Later, the develop-
ment of the echo sounder gave ocean scientists a more detailed represen-
tation of the sea floor. Today, much of our knowledge of the ocean floor
has  been  obtained  using  various  multibeam  echo  sounders or  side-scan
sonar instruments (to make detailed bathymetric maps of a small area of
the  ocean  floor); satellite  measurement of  the  ocean  surface  (to  produce
maps of the world ocean floor); and seismic reflection profiles (to examine
Earth structure beneath the sea floor).

Earth s hypsographic curve shows the amount of Earth s surface area at
different elevations and depths. The distribution of area is uneven with re-
spect  to  height  above  or  below  sea  level. The  shape  of  the  curve  also
reflects the existence of plate tectonic processes.

Continental  margins  can  be  either  passive (not  associated  with  any  plate
boundaries) or active (associated with convergent or transform plate bound-

aries). Extending from the shoreline is the generally shallow, low relief, and
gently  sloping  continental  shelf, which  can  contain  various  features  such  as
coastal islands, reefs, and banks. The boundary between the continental slope
and the continental shelf is marked by an increase in slope that occurs at the
shelf break. Cutting deep into the slopes are  submarine canyons, which re-
semble  canyons  on  land  but  are  created  by  erosive  turbidity  currents.
Turbidity currents deposit their sediment load at the base of the continental
slope, creating deep-sea fans that merge to produce a gently sloping conti-
nental  rise. The  deposits  from  turbidity  currents  (called  turbidite  deposits)
have characteristic sequences of graded bedding.Active margins have similar
features although they are modified by their associated plate boundary.

The continental rises gradually become flat, extensive, deep-ocean abyssal
plains, which form by suspension settling of fine sediment. Poking through the
sediment cover of the abyssal plains are numerous volcanic peaks, including
volcanic  islands, seamounts, tablemounts, and  abyssal  hills. In  the  Pacific
Ocean, where sedimentation rates are low, abyssal plains are not extensively
developed, and abyssal hill provinces cover broad expanses of ocean floor.

Along the margins of many continents especially those around the Pacific
Ring of Fire are deep linear scars called ocean trenches that are associated
with convergent plate boundaries and volcanic arcs.

The mid-ocean ridge is a continuous mountain range that winds through all
ocean basins and is entirely volcanic in origin. Common features associated
with  the  mid-ocean  ridge  include  a  central  rift  valley, faults  and  fissures,
seamounts, pillow basalts, hydrothermal vents, deposits of metal sulfides, and
unusual  life  forms. Segments  of  the  mid-ocean  ridge  are  either  oceanic

a Marine sediments contain 

a record of Earth history
dating back millions of
years; by analyzing sedi-
ment cores, scientists 
have identified extinctions,
global climate change, and
plate motions.

a Four main types of marine

sediment exist: (1) litho-
genous = derived from rock,
(2) biogenous = derived
from organisms, (3) hy-
drogenous = derived from
water, and (4) cosmoge-
nous = derived from outer
space.

a Marine sediments provide a

variety of important re-
sources, including petro-
leum, gas hydrates, sand
and gravel, evaporite salts,
phosphorite, and man-
ganese nodules and crusts.

When I think of the floor of the deep sea, the single, overwhelming fact

that possesses my imagination is the accumulation of sediments. I see 
always the steady, unremitting, downward drift of materials from above,
flake upon flake, layer upon layer. . . . For the sediments are the materials
of the most stupendous snowfall the Earth has ever seen.

Rachel Carson,
The Sea Around Us (1956)

MARINE SEDIMENTS

Why are sediments (sedimentum = settling) interesting to oceanographers? Although ocean sediments
are little more than eroded particles and fragments of dirt, dust, and other debris that have settled
out of the water and accumulated on the ocean floor (Figure 4.1), they reveal much about Earth s
history. For example, sediments provide clues to past climates, movements of the ocean floor, ocean
circulation patterns, and nutrient supplies for marine organisms. By examining cylindrical  cores of
sediment collected from the sea floor and interpreting them (Figure 4.2), oceanographers can ascer-
tain the timing of major extinctions, global climate change, and the movement of plates. In fact, most
of what is known of Earth s past geology, climate, and biology has been learned through studying
ancient marine sediments.

Over time, sediments can become lithified (lithos = stone, fic = making)

turned to rock and
form sedimentary rock. More than half of the rocks exposed on the continents are sedimentary rocks
deposited in ancient ocean environments and uplifted onto land by plate tectonic processes. Perhaps
surprisingly, even  the  tallest  mountains  on  the  continents
far  from  any  ocean contain  telltale
marine fossils, which indicate that these rocks originated on the ocean floor in the geologic past. For
example, the summit of the world s tallest mountain (Mount Everest in the Himalaya Mountains)
consists of limestone, which is a type of rock that originated as sea floor deposits.

Particles of sediment come from worn pieces of rocks, as well as living organisms, minerals dis-
solved in water, and outer space. Clues to sediment origin are found in its mineral composition and
its texture (the size and shape of its particles).

This chapter is organized around Table 4.1, which shows the classification of marine sediments
according to type, composition, sources, and main locations found. The chapter begins with a brief
discussion about what sediments reveal about Earth history and how sediments are collected. As you
work through the remainder of this chapter, note that each of the four main types of sediment are
discussed (Table 4.1, first column). Then, within each type of sediment, the composition (Table 4.1,
second column), origin (third column), and distribution (fourth column) are examined. Finally, the
chapter concludes with a discussion of the resources that sediments provide.

4.1 Why Are Marine Sediments 

Important?

Marine sediments provide a wealth of information about past conditions on Earth; in fact, sediments
of the deep-ocean floor represent one of the few complete and undisturbed records of Earth history
over the past several hundred million years. As sediment accumulates on the ocean floor, it preserves
materials that existed in the overlying water column. By carefully analyzing these materials, Earth

the water.

scientists can infer past conditions such as sea surface temperature, nutrient sup-
ply, abundance of marine life, atmospheric winds, ocean current patterns, volcanic
eruptions, major extinction events, changes in Earth s climate, and the movement
of tectonic plates. The study of how the ocean, atmosphere, and land have inter-
acted to produce changes in ocean chemistry, circulation, biology, and climate is
called  paleoceanography (paleo  * ancient, ocean  * the  marine  environment,
graphy * the name of a descriptive science), which relies on sea floor sediments
to gain insight into these past changes.

Recent paleoceanographic studies, for example, have linked changes in deep-
ocean circulation  with rapid  climate change. In  the North Atlantic  Ocean, cold,
relatively salty water sinks and forms a body of water called North Atlantic Deep
Water. Water  in  this  deep  current  circulates  through  the  global  ocean, driving
deep-ocean circulation and global heat transport and, thus, impacting global cli-
mate. Widely viewed as one of the most climatically sensitive regions on Earth,
North  Atlantic  sea  floor  sediments  from  the  past  several  million  years  have
revealed that the region has experienced abrupt changes to its ocean-atmosphere
system, triggered by fluctuations of fresh water from melting glaciers. Understanding
the  timing, mechanisms, and  causes  of  this  abrupt  climate  change  is  one  of  the
major challenges facing paleoceanography today.

Collecting sediments suitable for analysis from the deep ocean is an arduous
process. During  early  exploration  of  the  oceans, a  bucket-like  device  called  a
dredge was used to scoop up sediment from the deep-ocean floor for analysis. This
technique, however, was limited to gathering samples from just the surface of the
a hollow steel tube with a heavy weight on
ocean floor. Later, the gravity corer
top was thrust into the sea floor to collect the first cores (cylinders of sediment
and rock). Although the gravity corer could sample below the surface, its depth of
penetration was limited. Today, specially designed ships perform rotary drilling to
collect cores from the deep ocean (Box 4.1).

aspects of Earth history.

COLLECTING THE HISTORICAL RECORD OF THE DEEP-OCEAN FLOOR

In 1963, the U.S. National Science Founda-
tion  funded  a  program  that  borrowed
drilling technology from the offshore oil in-
dustry to obtain long sections of core from
deep below the surface of the ocean floor.
The  program  united  four  leading  oceano-
graphic 
institutions  (Scripps  Institution
of Oceanography  in  California; Rosenstiel
School  of  Atmospheric  and  Oceanic
Studies at the University of Miami, Florida;
Lamont-Doherty  Earth  Observatory  of
Columbia University in New York; and the
Woods  Hole  Oceanographic  Institution
in Massachusetts)  to  form  the  Joint 
Oceanographic  Institutions  for  Deep  Earth 
Sampling  (JOIDES). The  oceanography
departments  of  several  other  leading  uni-
versities later joined JOIDES.

The first phase of the Deep Sea Drilling
Project (DSDP) was initiated in 1968 when
the  specially  designed  drill  ship  Glomar
Challenger was  launched. It  had  a  tall
drilling rig resembling a steel tower. Cores
could be collected by drilling into the ocean
floor in water up to 6000 meters (3.7 miles)
deep. From the initial cores collected, scien-
tists  confirmed  the  existence  of  sea  floor
spreading by documenting that (1) the age
of  the  ocean  floor  increased  progressively
with distance from the mid-ocean ridge; (2)
sediment  thickness  increased  progressively
with distance from the mid-ocean ridge; and
(3) Earth s magnetic field polarity reversals
were recorded in ocean floor rocks.

Although the oceanographic research
program was initially financed by the U.S.
government, it  became  international  in
1975, when West Germany, France, Japan,
the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union
also  provided  financial  and  scientific  sup-
port. In 1983, the Deep Sea Drilling Project
became  the  Ocean  Drilling  Program
(ODP), with  20  participating  countries
under  the  supervision  of  Texas  A&M
University  and  a  broader  objective  of
drilling the thick sediment layers near the
continental margins.

In  1985, the  Glomar  Challenger was
decommissioned  and  replaced  by  the  drill
ship JOIDES Resolution (Figure 4A). The
new ship also has a tall metal drilling rig to
conduct  rotary  drilling. The  drill  pipe  is  in
individual  sections  of  9.5  meters  (31  feet),
and  sections  can  be  screwed  together  to

make a single string of pipe up to 8200 me-
ters (27,000 feet) long (Figure 4B). The drill
bit, located at the end of the pipe string, ro-
tates as it is pressed against the ocean bot-
tom and can drill up to 2100 meters (6900
feet)  below  the  sea  floor. Like  twirling  a
soda straw into a layer cake, the drilling op-
eration crushes the rock around the outside
and retains a cylinder of rock (a core sam-
ple) on the inside of the hollow pipe. Cores
can  then  be  raised  to  the  surface  from  in-
side  the  pipe  and  are  analyzed  with  state-
of-the-art laboratory facilities on board the
Resolution. Worldwide, more  than  2000
holes  have  been  drilled  into  the  sea  floor
using  this  method, allowing  the  collection
of  cores  that  provide  scientists  with  valu-
able  information  about  Earth  history  as
recorded in sea floor sediments.

In  2003, the  ODP  was  replaced  by
the Integrated  Ocean  Drilling  Program
(IODP), whose  main  participants  are
Japan, the United States, and the European
Union. This  new  international  effort  will
not rely on just one drill ship, but will use
multiple vessels for exploration. One of the
new vessels that began operations in 2007 is
a  state-of-the-art  drill  ship  named  Chikyu
(which means  Planet Earth in Japanese)
that  can  drill  up  to  7000  meters  (23,000

feet) below the sea floor, with plans to up-
grade the vessel with new drilling technol-
ogy to allow it to drill even deeper, perhaps
as  deep  as  through  Earth s  crust  into  the
mantle. The program s primary objective is
to collect cores that will allow scientists to
better understand Earth history and Earth
system  processes, including  the  properties
of the deep crust, climate change patterns,
earthquake mechanisms, and the microbiol-
ogy of the deep-ocean floor.

4.2 What Is Lithogenous Sediment?
Lithogenous  (lithos * stone, generare * to  produce)  sediment is  derived  from
preexisting  rock  material  that  originates  on  the  continents  or  islands  from  ero-
sion, volcanic eruptions, or blown dust. Note that lithogenous sediment is some-
times referred to as terrigenous (terra * land, generare * to produce) sediment.

Origin of Lithogenous Sediment
Lithogenous  sediment  begins  as  rocks  on  continents  or  islands. Over  time,
weathering agents  such  as  water, temperature  extremes, and  chemical  effects
break rocks into smaller pieces, as shown in Figure 4.3. When rocks are in smaller
pieces, they can be more easily eroded (picked up) and transported. This eroded
material is the basic component of which all lithogenous sediment is composed.

Eroded  material  from  the  continents  is  carried  to  the  oceans  by  streams,
wind, glaciers, and gravity (Figure 4.4). Each year, stream flow alone carries about
20  billion  metric  tons  (22  billion  short  tons)  of  sediment  to  Earth s  continental
margins; almost 40% is provided by runoff from Asia.

Transported sediment can be deposited in many environments, including bays
or lagoons near the ocean, as deltas at the mouths of rivers, along beaches at the
shoreline, or further offshore across the continental margin. It can also be carried
beyond the continental margin to the deep-ocean basin by turbidity currents, as
discussed in Chapter 3.

The greatest quantity of lithogenous material is found around the margins of
the  continents, where  it  is  constantly  moved  by  high-energy  currents  along  the
shoreline and in deeper turbidity currents. Lower-energy currents distribute finer
components  that  settle  out  onto  the  deep-ocean  basins. Microscopic  particles
from wind-blown dust or volcanic eruptions can even be carried far out over the
open ocean by prevailing winds. These particles either settle into fine layers as the
velocity of the wind decreases or disperse into the ocean when they serve as nu-
clei around which raindrops and snowflakes form.

Composition of Lithogenous Sediment
The composition of lithogenous sediment reflects the material from which it was
derived. All rocks are composed of discrete crystals of naturally occurring com-
pounds called minerals. One of the most abundant, chemically stable, and durable
minerals in Earth s crust is quartz, composed of silicon and oxygen in the form of
SiO2
the same composition as ordinary glass. Quartz is a major component of
most  rocks. Because  quartz  is  resistant  to  abrasion, it  can  be  transported  long

distances  and  deposited  far  from  its  source  area. The  majority  of  lithogenous
deposits

such as beach sands are composed primarily of quartz (Figure 4.5).

A  large  percentage  of  lithogenous  particles  that  find  their  way  into  deep-
ocean sediments far from continents are transported by prevailing winds that re-
move  small  particles  from  the  continents   subtropical  desert  regions. The  map

in Figure 4.6 shows a close relationship between the location of microscopic frag-
ments of lithogenous quartz in the surface sediments of the ocean floor and the
strong  prevailing  winds  in  the  desert  regions  of  Africa, Asia, and  Australia.
Satellite observations of dust storms (Figure 4.6, inset) confirm this relationship.
Sediment is not the only item transported by wind. In fact, there has been recent
documentation of the transportation of a variety of airborne substances
includ-
ing viruses, pollutants, and even living insects
from Africa all the way across the
Atlantic Ocean to North America.

Sediment Texture
One of the most important properties of lithogenous sediment is its texture, in-
cluding its grain size.1 The Wentworth scale of grain size (Table 4.2) indicates that
particles can be classified as boulders (largest), cobbles, pebbles, granules, sand,
silt, or clay (smallest). Sediment size is proportional to the energy needed to lay
down a deposit. Deposits laid down where wave action is strong (areas of high en-
ergy) may be composed primarily of larger particles
cobbles and boulders. Fine-
grained particles, on the other hand, are deposited where the energy level is low
and the current speed is minimal. When clay-sized particles many of which are
flat are deposited, they tend to stick together by cohesive forces. Consequently,
higher-energy conditions than what would be expected based on grain size alone
are required to erode and transport clays. In general, however, lithogenous sedi-
ment tends to become finer with increasing distance from shore. This relationship
is mostly because high-energy transporting media predominate close to shore and
lower-energy conditions exist in the deep-ocean basins.

The texture of lithogenous sediment also depends on its sorting. Sorting is a
measure of the uniformity of grain sizes and indicates the selectivity of the trans-
portation process. For example, sediments composed of particles that are primarily
the same size are well sorted such as in coastal sand dunes, where winds can only
pick up a certain size particle. Poorly sorted deposits, on the other hand, contain a
variety of different sized particles and indicate a transportation process capable of
picking up clay- to boulder-sized particles. An example of poorly sorted sediment
is that which is carried by a glacier and left behind when the glacier melts.

Distribution of Lithogenous Sediment
Marine  sedimentary  deposits  can  be  categorized  as  either  neritic  or  pelagic.
Neritic  (neritos * of  the  coast) deposits are  found  on  continental  shelves  and
in shallow  water  near  islands; these  deposits  are  generally  coarse  grained.
Alternatively, pelagic  (pelagios * of  the  sea) deposits are  found  in  the  deep-
ocean  basins  and  are  typically  fine  grained. Moreover, lithogenous  sediment  in
the  ocean  is  ubiquitous: At  least  a  small  percentage  of  lithogenous  sediment  is
found nearly everywhere on the ocean floor.

NERITIC  DEPOSITS Lithogenous  sediment  dominates  most  neritic  deposits.
Lithogenous  sediment  is  derived  from  rocks  on  nearby  landmasses, consists  of
coarse-grained deposits, and accumulates rapidly on the continental shelf, slope,
and  rise. Examples  of  lithogenous  neritic  deposits  include  beach  deposits,
continental shelf deposits, turbidite deposits, and glacial deposits.

Beach Deposits Beaches are made of whatever materials are locally available.
Beach materials are composed mostly of quartz-rich sand that is washed down to
the  coast  by  rivers  but  can  also  be  composed  of  a  wide  variety  of  sizes  and

1Sediment grains are also known as particles, fragments, or clasts.

How effective is wind as a transporting agent?

Any material that gets into the atmosphere including
dust from dust storms, soot from forest fires, specks
of  pollution,  and  ash  from  volcanic  eruptions is
transported by wind and can be found as deposits on
the  ocean  floor.  Every  year,  wind  storms  lift  an  esti-
mated 3 billion metric tons (3.3 billion short tons) of
this  material  into  the  atmosphere,  where  it  gets
transported  around  the  globe.  As  much  as  three-
quarters of these particles mostly dust come from
Africa s Sahara Desert; once airborne, they are car-
ried  out  across  the  Atlantic  Ocean  (see  Figure  4.6).
Much of this dust falls in the Atlantic, and that s why
ships  traveling  downwind  from  the  Sahara  Desert
often arrive at their destinations quite dusty. Some of
it falls in the Caribbean (where the pathogens it con-
tains  have  been  linked  to  stress  and  disease  among
coral reefs), the Amazon (where its iron and phospho-
rus fertilize nutrient-poor soil), and across the south-
ern  United  States  as  far  west  as  New  Mexico.  The
dust  also  contains  bacteria  and  pesticides even
African  desert  locusts  have  been  transported  alive
across the Atlantic during strong wind storms!

Continental  Shelf  Deposits At the end of the last ice age (about 18,000 years
ago), glaciers  melted  and  sea  level  rose. As  a  result, many  rivers  of  the  world
today deposit their sediment in drowned river mouths rather than carry it onto
the  continental  shelf  as  they  did  during  the  geologic  past. In  many  areas, the
sediments  that  cover  the  continental  shelf
called  relict (relict  * left  behind)
sediments were  deposited  from  3000  to  7000  years  ago  and  have  not  yet  been
covered by more recent deposits. These sediments presently cover about 70% of
the  world s  continental  shelves. In  other  areas, deposits  of  sand  ridges  on  the

continental  shelves  appear  to  have  been  formed  more  recently  than  the  most
recent ice age and at present water depths.

Turbidite Deposits As discussed in Chapter 3, turbidity currents are underwater
avalanches that periodically move down the continental slopes and carve submarine
canyons. Turbidity currents also carry vast amounts of neritic material. This material
spreads  out  as  deep-sea  fans, comprises  the  continental  rise, and  gradually  thins
toward  the  abyssal  plains. These  deposits  are  called  turbidite  deposits and  are
composed of characteristic layering called graded bedding (see Figure 3.10).

Glacial  Deposits Poorly  sorted  deposits  containing  particles  ranging  from
boulders to clays may be found in the high-latitude2 portions of the continental
shelf. These  glacial  deposits were  laid  down  during  the  most  recent  ice  age  by
glaciers that covered the continental shelf and eventually melted. Glacial deposits
are currently forming around the continent of Antarctica and around Greenland
by ice rafting. In this process, rock particles trapped in glacial ice are carried out
to  sea  by  icebergs  that  break  away  from  coastal  glaciers. As  the  icebergs  melt,
lithogenous particles of many sizes are released and settle onto the ocean floor.

PELAGIC DEPOSITS Turbidite deposits of neritic sediment on the continental rise
can  spill  over  into  the  deep-ocean  basin. However, most  pelagic  deposits  are
composed  of  fine-grained  material  that  accumulates  slowly  on  the  deep-ocean
floor. Pelagic lithogenous sediment includes particles that have come from volcanic
eruptions, windblown dust, and fine material that is carried by deep-ocean currents.

Abyssal Clay Abyssal clay is composed of at least 70% (by weight) fine, clay-sized
particles  from  the  continents. Even  though  they  are  far  from  land, deep  abyssal
plains  contain  thick  sequences  of  abyssal  clay  deposits  composed  of  particles
transported great distances by winds or ocean currents and deposited on the deep-
ocean  floor. Because  abyssal  clays  contain  oxidized  iron, they  are  commonly  red-
brown or buff in color and are sometimes referred to as red clays.The predominance
of abyssal clay on abyssal plains is caused not by an abundance of clay settling on the
ocean floor but by the absence of other material that would otherwise dilute it.

2High-latitude regions are those far from the equator (either north or south); low latitudes are areas
close to the equator.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Lithogenous sediment is produced from preexisting
rock material, is found on most parts of the ocean
floor, and can occur as thick deposits close to
land.

Chapter 4 Marine Sediments

4.3 What Is Biogenous Sediment?
Biogenous (bio * life, generare * to produce) sediment (also called biogenic sed-
iment) is derived from the remains of hard parts of once-living organisms.

Origin of Biogenous Sediment
Biogenous  sediment  begins  as  the  hard  parts  (shells, bones, and  teeth)  of  living
organisms  ranging  from  minute  algae  and  protozoans  to  fish  and  whales. When
organisms that produce hard parts die, their remains settle onto the ocean floor
and can accumulate as biogenous sediment.

Biogenous  sediment  can  be  classified  as  either  macroscopic  or  microscopic.
Macroscopic biogenous sediment is large enough to be seen without the aid of a
microscope and includes shells, bones, and teeth of large organisms. Except in cer-
tain tropical beach localities where shells and coral fragments are numerous, this
type of sediment is relatively rare in the marine environment, especially in deep
water where fewer organisms live. Much more abundant is microscopic biogenous
sediment, which contains particles so small they can only be seen well through a
microscope. Microscopic organisms produce tiny shells called tests (testa * shell)
that begin to sink after the organisms die and continually rain down in great num-
bers  onto  the  ocean  floor. These  microscopic  tests  can  accumulate  on  the  deep-
ocean floor and form deposits called ooze (wose * juice). As its name implies, ooze
resembles very fine-grained, mushy material.3 Technically, biogenous ooze must con-
tain at least 30% biogenous test material by weight. What comprises the other part
up to 70% of an ooze? Commonly, it is fine-grained lithogenous clay that is deposited
along  with  biogenous  tests  in  the  deep  ocean. By  volume, much  more  microscopic
ooze than macroscopic biogenous sediment exists on the ocean floor.

The organisms that contribute to biogenous sediment are chiefly algae (alga
* seaweed)  and  protozoans (proto  * first, zoa  * animal). Algae  are  primarily
aquatic, eukaryotic,4 photosynthetic organisms, ranging in size from microscopic
single cells to large organisms like giant kelp. Protozoans are any of a large group
of single-celled, eukaryotic, usually microscopic organisms that are generally not
photosynthetic.

Composition of Biogenous Sediment
The two most common chemical compounds in biogenous sediment are calcium
carbonate (
Often, the
the  hydrated
silica  is  chemically  combined  with  water  to  produce 
form of silica, which is called opal.

which forms the mineral calcite) and silica

nH2O,

SILICA Most  of  the  silica  in  biogenous  ooze  comes  from  microscopic  algae
called diatoms (diatoma = cut in half) and protozoans called radiolarians (radio =
a spoke or ray).

Because  diatoms  photosynthesize, they  need  strong  sunlight  and  are  found
only  within  the  upper, sunlit  surface  waters  of  the  ocean. Most  diatoms  are  free-
floating, or planktonic (planktos = wandering). The living organism builds a glass
greenhouse out of silica as a protective covering and lives inside. Most species have
two parts to their test that fit together like a petri dish or pillbox (Figure 4.7a). The
tiny tests are perforated with small holes in intricate patterns to allow nutrients to

this term, imagine walking barefoot across the deep-ocean floor and having the fine sediment there

pass in and waste products to pass out. Where diatoms are
abundant  at  the  ocean  surface, thick  deposits  of  diatom-
rich ooze can accumulate below on the ocean floor. When
this ooze lithifies, it becomes diatomaceous earth,5 a light-
weight  white  rock  composed  of  diatom  tests  and  clay 
(Box 4.2).

Radiolarians  are  microscopic  single-celled  proto-
zoans, most  of  which  are  also  planktonic. As  their  name
implies, they often have long spikes or rays of silica pro-
truding  from  their  siliceous  shell  (Figure  4.7b). They  do
not  photosynthesize  but  rely  on  external  food  sources
such  as  bacteria  and  other  plankton. Radiolarians  typi-
cally display well-developed symmetry, which is why they
have been described as the  living snowflakes of the sea.

The accumulation of siliceous tests of diatoms, radio-
larians, and  other  silica-secreting  organisms  produces
siliceous ooze (Figure 4.7c).

CALCIUM  CARBONATE Two  significant  sources  of
calcium  carbonate  biogenous  ooze  are  the  foraminifers
(foramen = an opening)
and  microscopic  algae  called  coccolithophores (coccus  =
berry, lithos = stone, phorid = carrying).

close relatives of radiolarians

Coccolithophores  are  single-celled  algae, most  of
which  are  planktonic. Coccolithophores  produce  thin
plates  or  shields  made  of  calcium  carbonate, 20  or  30  of
which  overlap  to  produce  a  spherical  test  (Figure  4.8a).
Like  diatoms, coccolithophores  photosynthesize, so  they
need  sunlight  to  live. Coccolithophores  are  about  10  to
100 times smaller than most diatoms (Figure 4.8b), which
is  why  coccolithophores  are  often  called  nannoplankton
(nanno = dwarf, planktos = wandering).

When the organism dies, the individual plates (called
coccoliths) disaggregate and can accumulate on the ocean
floor as coccolith-rich ooze. When this ooze lithifies over
time, it forms a white deposit called  chalk, which is used
for  a  variety  of  purposes  (including  writing  on  chalk-
boards). The White  Cliffs  of  southern  England  are  com-
posed of hardened, coccolith-rich calcium carbonate ooze,
which was deposited on the ocean floor and has been up-
lifted  onto  land  (Figure  4.9). Deposits  of  chalk  the  same
age  as  the  White  Cliffs  are  so  common  throughout
Europe, North  America, Australia, and  the  Middle  East
that the geologic period in which these deposits formed is
named the Cretaceous (creta = chalk) Period.

Foraminifers  are  single-celled  protozoans, many  of  which  are  planktonic,
ranging in size from microscopic to macroscopic. They do not photosynthesize, so
they must ingest other organisms for food. Foraminifers produce a hard calcium
carbonate test in which the organism lives (Figure 4.8c). Most foraminifers pro-
duce a segmented or chambered test, and all tests have a prominent opening in
one end. Although very small in size, the tests of foraminifers resemble the large
shells that one might find at a beach.

Deposits  comprised  primarily  of  tests  of  foraminifers, coccoliths, and  other

calcareous-secreting organisms are called calcareous ooze (Figure 4.8d).

common  products  (Figure  4C). The  main
uses of diatomaceous earth include

filters (for refining sugar, separating im-
purities  from  wine, straining  yeast  from
beer, and filtering swimming pool water)

mild  abrasives  (in  toothpaste,
facial
scrubs, matches, and household cleaning
and polishing compounds)

absorbents  (for  chemical  spills, in  cat
litter, and as a soil conditioner)

chemical  carriers  (in  pharmaceuticals,
paint, and even dynamite)

Other  products  from  diatomaceous
earth include optical-quality glass (because
of the pure silica content of diatoms) and
space shuttle tiles (because they are light-
weight  and  provide  good  insulation). It  is
also used as an additive in concrete, a filler

in  tires, an  anticaking  agent, a  natural
pesticide, and  is  even  used  as  a  building
stone in the construction of houses.

Further, the vast majority of oxygen that
all animals breathe is a by-product of photo-
synthesis by diatoms. In addition, each living
diatom contains a tiny droplet of oil. When
diatoms die, their tests containing droplets of
oil accumulate on the sea floor and are the
beginnings  of  petroleum  deposits, such  as
those found offshore California.

Given  their  many  practical  applica-
tions, it is difficult to imagine how differ-
ent our lives would be without diatoms!

Diatoms  are  microscopic  single-celled
photosynthetic  organisms. Each  one  lives
inside a protective silica test, most of which
contain  two  halves  that  fit  together  like  a
shoebox and its lid. First described with the
aid of a microscope in 1702, their tests are
exquisitely  ornamented  with  holes, ribs,
and  radiating  spines  unique  to  individual
species. The  fossil  record  indicates that di-
atoms have been on Earth since the Jurassic
Period  (180  million  years  ago),
and at least 70,000 species of di-
atoms have been identified.

Diatoms live for a few days
to as much as a week, can repro-
duce  sexually  or  asexually, and
occur  individually  or  linked  to-
gether  into  long  communities.
They  are  found  in  great  abun-
dance floating in the ocean and in
certain  freshwater  lakes  but can
also be found in many diverse en-
vironments, such as on the under-
sides of polar ice, on the skins of
whales, in soil, in thermal springs,
and even on brick walls.

When  marine  diatoms  die,
their 
tests  rain  down  and
accumulate  on  the  sea  floor  as
siliceous  ooze. Hardened  de-
posits  of  siliceous  ooze, called
diatomaceous  earth, can  be  as
much as 900 meters (3000 feet)
thick. Diatomaceous earth con-
sists  of  billions  of  minute  silica
tests  and  has  many  unusual
properties: It is lightweight, has
an  inert  chemical  composition,
is  resistant  to  high  tempera-
tures, and has excellent filtering
properties. Diatomaceous earth

Distribution of Biogenous Sediment
Biogenous sediment is one of the most common types of pelagic deposits. The dis-
tribution of biogenous sediment on the ocean floor depends on three fundamen-
tal processes: (1) productivity, (2) destruction, and (3) dilution.

Productivity is the number of organisms present in the surface water above
the ocean floor. Surface waters with high biologic productivity contain many liv-
ing and reproducing organisms
conditions that are likely to produce biogenous
sediments. Conversely, surface waters with low biologic productivity contain too
few organisms to produce biogenous oozes on the ocean floor.

Destruction occurs  when  skeletal  remains  (tests)  dissolve  in  seawater  at
depth. In some cases, biogenous sediment dissolves before ever reaching the sea
floor; in  other  cases, it  is  dissolved  before  it  has  a  chance  to  accumulate  into
deposits on the sea floor.

Dilution occurs  when  the  deposition  of  other  sediments  decreases  the  per-
centage of the biogenous sediment found in marine deposits. For example, other
types of sediments can dilute biogenous test material below the 30% necessary to

classify it as ooze. Dilution occurs most often because of the
abundance  of  coarse-grained  lithogenous  material  in  neritic
environments, so biogenous oozes are uncommon along conti-
nental margins.

NERITIC DEPOSITS Although neritic deposits are dominated
by  lithogenous  sediment, both  microscopic  and  macroscopic
biogenous  material  may  be  incorporated  into  lithogenous
sediment in neritic deposits. In addition, biogenous carbonate
deposits are common in some areas.

Carbonate  Deposits Carbonate minerals  are  those  that
in  their  chemical  formula such  as  calcium
contain 
carbonate,
Rocks  from  the  marine  environment
composed primarily of calcium carbonate are called limestones.
Most  limestones  contain  fossil  marine  shells, suggesting  a
biogenous origin, while others appear to have formed directly
from  seawater  without  the  help  of  any  marine  organism.
Modern  environments  where  calcium  carbonate  is  currently
forming  (such  as  in  the  Bahama  Banks, Australia s  Great
Barrier Reef, and the Persian Gulf) suggest that these carbonate
deposits occurred in shallow, warm-water shelves and around
tropical islands as coral reefs and beaches.

Ancient  marine  carbonate  deposits  constitute  2%  of  Earth s  crust  and
25%  of  all  sedimentary  rocks  on  Earth. In  fact, these  marine  limestone
deposits form the underlying bedrock of Florida and many midwestern states,
from Kentucky to Michigan and from Pennsylvania to Colorado. Percolation
of groundwater through these deposits has dissolved the limestone to produce
sinkholes and, in some cases, spectacular caverns.

Stromatolites Stromatolites are  lobate  structures  consisting  of  fine  layers  of
carbonate  that  form  in  specific  warm, shallow-water  environments  such  as  the
high  salinity  tidal  pools  in  shark  bay, western  Australia  (Figure  4.10).
Cyanobacteria6 produce these deposits by trapping fine sediment in mucous mats.
Other  types  of  algae  produce  long  filaments  that  bind  carbonate  particles
together. As layer upon layer of these algae colonize the surface, a bulbous structure

from about 1 to 3 billion years ago conditions
were ideal for the development of stromatolites,
so  stromatolitic  structures  hundreds  of  meters
high can be found in rocks from these ages.

PELAGIC  DEPOSITS Microscopic  biogenous
sediment (ooze) is common on the deep-ocean
floor  because  there  is  so  little  lithogenous
sediment deposited at great distances from the
continents  that  could  dilute  the  biogenous
material.

Siliceous Ooze Siliceous ooze contains at least
30%  of  the  hard  remains  of  silica-secreting
organisms. When  the  siliceous  ooze  consists
mostly  of  diatoms, it  is  called  diatomaceous
ooze.When it consists mostly of radiolarians, it is
called radiolarian ooze. When it consists mostly
of  single-celled  silicoflagellates another  type
of protozoan it is called silicoflagellate ooze.

The  ocean  is  undersaturated  with  silica  at  all  depths, so  the  destruction  of
siliceous  biogenous  particles  by  dissolving  in  seawater  occurs  continuously  and
slowly at all depths. How can siliceous ooze accumulate on the ocean floor if it is
being dissolved? One way is to accumulate the siliceous tests faster than seawater
can dissolve them. For instance, many tests sinking at the same time will create a
deposit of siliceous ooze on the sea floor below (Figure 4.11).7 Once buried be-
neath other siliceous tests, they are no longer exposed to the dissolving effects of
seawater. Thus, siliceous ooze is commonly found in areas below surface waters
with high biologic productivity of silica-secreting organisms.

Calcareous  Ooze  and  the  CCD Calcareous  ooze  contains  at  least  30%  of
the hard  remains  of  calcareous-secreting  organisms. When  it  consists  mostly  of
coccolithophores, it is called coccolith ooze. When it consists mostly of foraminifers,
it is called foraminifer ooze. One of the most common types of foraminifer ooze is
Globigerina  ooze, named  for  a  foraminifer  that  is  especially  widespread  in  the
Atlantic and South Pacific oceans. Other calcareous oozes include pteropod oozes
and ostracod oozes.

The destruction of calcium carbonate varies with depth. At the warmer sur-
face  and  in  the  shallow  parts  of  the  ocean, seawater  is  generally  saturated  with
calcium carbonate, so calcite does not dissolve. In the deep ocean, however, the
colder water contains greater amounts of carbon dioxide, which forms carbonic
acid and causes calcareous material to dissolve. The higher pressure at depth also
helps speed the dissolution of calcium carbonate.

The depth in the ocean at which the pressure is high enough and the amount
of carbon dioxide in deep-ocean waters is great enough to begin dissolving cal-
cium carbonate is called the lysocline (lusis = a loosening, cline = slope). Below
the  lysocline, calcium  carbonate  dissolves  at  an  increasing  rate  with  increasing
depth  until  the  calcite  compensation  depth  (CCD)8 is  reached  (Figure  4.12).

FIGURE 4.11 Accumulation of siliceous ooze. Siliceous
ooze accumulates on the ocean floor beneath areas of high
productivity, where the rate of accumulation of siliceous tests
is greater than the rate at which silica is being dissolved.

7An analogy to this is trying to get a layer of sugar to form on the bottom of a cup of hot coffee. If a few
grains of sugar are slowly dropped into the cup, a layer of sugar won t accumulate. If a whole bowl full
of sugar is dumped into the coffee, however, a thick layer of sugar will form on the bottom of the cup.
8Because the mineral calcite is composed of calcium carbonate, the calcite compensation depth is also
known as the calcium carbonate compensation depth, or the carbonate compensation depth. All go
by the handy abbreviation CCD.

How Calcareous Ooze

Can Be Found 
Beneath the CCD

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Biogenous sediment is produced from the hard 
remains of once-living organisms. Microscopic
biogenous sediment is especially widespread and
forms deposits of ooze on the ocean floor.

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

Ive been to Hawaii and seen a black sand beach.
Because it forms by lava flowing into the ocean that is
broken up by waves, is it hydrogenous sediment?

No. Many active volcanoes in the world have black sand
beaches that are created when waves break apart dark-
colored  volcanic  rock.  The  material  that  produces  the
black sand is derived from a continent or an island, so it
is considered lithogenous sediment. Even though molten
lava sometimes flows into the ocean, the resulting black
sand could never be considered hydrogenous sediment
because the lava was never dissolved in water.

At the CCD and greater depths, sediment does not usually contain much calcite
because it readily dissolves; even the thick tests of foraminifers dissolve within a
day or two. The CCD, on average, is 4500 meters (15,000 feet) below sea level, but,
depending  on  the  chemistry  of  the  deep  ocean, may  be  as  deep  as  6000  meters
(20,000  feet)  in  portions  of  the  Atlantic  Ocean, or  as  shallow  as  3500  meters
(11,500  feet)  in  the  Pacific  Ocean. The  depth  of  the  lysocline  also  varies  from
ocean to ocean but averages about 4000 meters (13,100 feet).

Because  of  the  CCD, modern  carbonate  oozes  are  generally  rare  below
5000 meters  (16,400  feet). Still, buried  deposits  of  ancient  calcareous  ooze  are
found  beneath  the  CCD. How  can  calcareous  ooze  exist  below  the  CCD? The
necessary  conditions  are  shown  in  Figure  4.13. The  mid-ocean  ridge  is  a  topo-
graphically high feature that rises above the sea floor. It often pokes up above the
CCD, even though the surrounding deep-ocean floor is below the CCD. Thus, cal-
careous ooze deposited on top of the mid-ocean ridge will not be dissolved. Sea
floor spreading causes the newly created sea floor and the calcareous sediment on
top of it to move into deeper water away from the ridge, eventually being trans-
ported below the CCD. This calcareous sediment will dissolve below the CCD un-
less  it  is  covered  by  a  deposit  that  is  unaffected  by  the  CCD  (such  as  siliceous
ooze or abyssal clay).

The map in Figure 4.14 shows the percentage (by weight) of calcium carbon-
ate in the modern surface sediments of the ocean basins. High concentrations of
calcareous  ooze  (sometimes  exceeding  80%)  are  found  along  segments  of  the
mid-ocean ridge, but little is found in deep-ocean basins below the CCD. For ex-
ample, in  the  northern  Pacific  Ocean one  of  the  deepest  parts  of  the  world
ocean there is very little calcium carbonate in the sediment. Calcium carbonate
is also rare in sediments accumulating beneath cold, high-latitude waters where
calcareous-secreting organisms are relatively uncommon.

Table 4.3 compares the environmental conditions that can be inferred from
siliceous and calcareous oozes. It shows that siliceous ooze typically forms below
cool surface water regions, including areas of upwelling where deep-ocean water
comes to the surface and supplies nutrients that stimulate high rates of biological
productivity. Calcareous ooze, on the other hand, is found on the shallower areas
of the ocean floor beneath warmer surface water.

Origin of Hydrogenous Sediment
Seawater contains many dissolved materials. Chemical reactions within seawater
cause  certain  minerals  to  come  out  of  solution, or  precipitate (change  from  the
dissolved to the solid state). Precipitation usually occurs when there is a change in
conditions, such as a change in temperature or pressure or the addition of chemi-
cally active fluids. To make rock candy, for instance, a pan of water is heated and
sugar is added. When the water is hot and the sugar dissolved, the pan is removed
from the heat and the sugar water is allowed to cool. The change in temperature
causes the sugar to become oversaturated, which causes it to precipitate. As the
water  cools, the  sugar  precipitates  on  anything  that  is  put  in  the  pan, such  as
pieces of string or kitchen utensils.

ules including some that are cut in half, revealing their central
nucleation object and layered internal structure. (b) A por-
tion of the South Pacific Ocean floor about 4 meters (13 feet)

Composition and Distribution of
Hydrogenous Sediment
Although  hydrogenous  sediments  represent  a  relatively  small
portion of the overall sediment in the ocean, they have many differ-
ent  compositions  and  are  distributed  in  diverse  environments  of
deposition.

MANGANESE  NODULES Manganese  nodules are  rounded, hard
lumps of manganese, iron, and other metals typically 5 centimeters
(2  inches)  in  diameter  up  to  a  maximum  of  about  20  centimeters
(8 inches). When  cut  in  half, they  often  reveal  a  layered  structure
formed  by  precipitation  around  a  central  nucleation
object  (Figure  4.15a). The  nucleation  object  may  be  a
piece of lithogenous sediment, coral, volcanic rock, a fish
bone, or  a  shark s  tooth. Manganese  nodules  are  found
on  the  deep-ocean  floor  at  concentrations  of  about  100
nodules  per  square  meter  (square  yard). In  some  areas,
they  occur  in  even  greater  abundance  (Figure  4.15b),
resembling  a  scattered  field  of  baseball-sized  nodules.
The formation of manganese nodules requires extremely
low  rates  of  lithogenous  or  biogenous  input  so  that  the
nodules are not buried.

The  major  components  of  these  nodules  are  man-
ganese  dioxide  (around  30%  by  weight)  and  iron  oxide
(around 20%). The element manganese is important for
making high-strength steel alloys. Other accessory metals
present  in  manganese  nodules  include  copper  (used  in
electrical wiring, in pipes, and to make brass and bronze),
nickel (used to make stainless steel), and cobalt (used as
an  alloy  with  iron  to  make  strong  magnets  and  steel
tools). Although the concentration of these accessory metals is usually less than
1%, they can exceed 2% by weight, which may make them attractive exploration
targets in the future.

The  origin  of  manganese  nodules  has  puzzled  oceanographers  since  man-
ganese  nodules  were  first  discovered  in  1872  during  the  voyage  of  HMS
Challenger.9 If  manganese  nodules  are  truly  hydrogenous  and  precipitate  from
seawater, then how can they have such high concentrations of manganese (which
occurs  in  seawater  at  concentrations  often  too  small  to  measure  accurately)?
Furthermore, why are the nodules on top of ocean floor sediment and not buried
by the constant rain of sedimentary particles?

Unfortunately, nobody has definitive answers to these questions. Perhaps the
creation of manganese nodules is the result of one of the slowest chemical reac-
tions known on average, they grow at a rate of about 5 millimeters (0.2 inch) per
million years. Recent research suggests that the formation of manganese nodules
may be aided by bacteria and an as-yet-unidentified marine organism that inter-
mittently lifts and rotates them. Other studies reveal that the nodules don t form
continuously over time but in spurts that are related to specific conditions such as
a  low  sedimentation  rate  of  lithogenous  clay  and  strong  deep-water  currents.
Remarkably, the larger the nodules are, the faster they grow. The origin of man-
ganese nodules is widely considered the most interesting unresolved problem in
marine chemistry.

PHOSPHATES Phosphorus-bearing compounds (phosphates) occur abundantly
as  coatings  on  rocks  and  as  nodules  on  the  continental  shelf  and  on  banks  at

depths shallower than 1000 meters (3300 feet).
Concentrations  of  phosphates  in  such  deposits
commonly  reach  30%  by  weight  and  indicate
abundant  biological  activity  in  surface  water
above  where  they  accumulate. Because  phos-
phates are valuable as fertilizers, ancient marine
phosphate deposits that have been uplifted onto
land  are  extensively  mined  to  supply  agricul-
tural needs.

CARBONATES The  two  most  important  car-
bonate minerals in marine sediment are aragonite
and  calcite. Both  are  composed  of  calcium
carbonate 
but  aragonite  has  a
different crystalline  structure  that  is  less stable
and changes into calcite over time.

(CaCO3)

As  previously  discussed, most  carbonate
deposits  are  biogenous  in  origin. However,
hydrogenous carbonate deposits can precipitate
directly  from  seawater  in  tropical  climates  to
form  aragonite  crystals  less  than  2  millimeters
(0.08 inch) long. In addition, oolites
(oo = egg,
are small calcite spheres 2 millimeters (0.08 inch) or less in diame-
lithos = rock)
ter that have layers like an onion and form in some shallow tropical waters where
concentrations  of 
are  high. Oolites  are  thought  to  precipitate  around  a
nucleus and grow larger as they roll back and forth on beaches by wave action,
but some evidence suggests that a type of algae may aid their formation.

METAL SULFIDES Deposits of metal sulfides are associated with hydrothermal
vents and black smokers along the mid-ocean ridge. These deposits contain iron,
nickel, copper, zinc, silver, and other metals in varying proportions. Transported
away  from  the  mid-ocean  ridge  by  sea  floor  spreading, these  deposits  can  be
found throughout the ocean floor and can even be uplifted onto continents.

EVAPORITES Evaporite  minerals form  where  there  is  restricted  open  ocean
circulation  and where  evaporation  rates  are  high, such  as  in  the  Mediterranean
Sea  (see  Web  Box  4.1). As  water  evaporates  from  these  areas, the  remaining
seawater  becomes  saturated  with  dissolved  minerals, which  then  begin  to
precipitate. Heavier than seawater, they sink to the bottom or form a white crust
of evaporite minerals around the edges of these areas (Figure 4.16). Collectively
termed  salts, some evaporite minerals, such as halite (common table salt, NaCl),

4.5 What Is Cosmogenous Sediment?
Cosmogenous  (cosmos * universe, generare * to  produce) sediment is  derived
from extraterrestrial sources.

Origin, Composition, and Distribution 
of Cosmogenous Sediment
Forming  an  insignificant  portion  of  the  overall  sediment  on  the  ocean  floor,
cosmogenous  sediment  consists  of  two  main  types: microscopic  spherules and
macroscopic meteor debris.

116

Chapter 4 Marine Sediments

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Cosmogenous sediment is produced from materials
originating in outer space and includes microscopic
space dust and macroscopic meteor debris.

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

How are scientists able to identify cosmogenous 
sediment? I mean, how can they tell that its 
extraterrestrial?

Cosmogenous  sediment  can  be  differentiated  from
other  sediment  types  primarily  by  its  structure  but
also by its composition. Cosmogenous  sediment can
be  either  silicate  rock  or  rich  in  iron both  of  which
are  common  compositions  of  lithogenous  sediment.
However, glassy fragments indicative of melting (called
tektites)  are  uniquely  cosmogenous,  as  are  iron-
rich  spherules  (see  Figure  4.17).  Compositionally,
cosmogenous  particles  from  outer  space  typically
contain more nickel than those that originate in other
ways;  most  of  the  nickel  in  Earth s  crust  has  sunk
below the surface during density stratification early in
Earth s history.

Microscopic  spherules  are  small  globular  masses. Some  spherules  are  com-
posed of silicate rock material and show evidence of being formed by extraterres-
trial  impact  events  on  Earth  or  other  planets  that  eject  small  molten  pieces  of
crust into space. These tektites (tektos = molten) then rain down on Earth and can
form  tektite  fields. Other  spherules  are  composed  mostly  of  iron  and  nickel
(Figure 4.17) that form in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter
and are produced when asteroids collide. This material constantly rains down on
Earth as a general component of space dust or micrometeorites that float harm-
lessly through the atmosphere. Although about 90% of micrometeorites are de-
stroyed by frictional heating as they enter the atmosphere, it has been estimated
that  as  much  as  300,000  metric  tons  (330,000  short  tons)  of  space  dust  reach
Earth s surface each year, which equates to about 10 kilograms (22 pounds) every
second of every day! The iron-rich space dust that lands in the oceans often dis-
solves in seawater. Glassy tektites, however, do not dissolve as easily and some-
times comprise minute proportions of various marine sediments.

Macroscopic meteor debris is rare on Earth but can be found associated with
meteor  impact  sites. Evidence  suggests  that  throughout  time  meteors  have  col-
lided with Earth at great speeds and that some larger ones have released energy
equivalent to the explosion of multiple large nuclear bombs. To date, nearly 200
meteorite impact structures have been identified on Earth, most of them on land
but new ones are being discovered on the ocean floor (Box 4.3). The debris from
meteors
settles out around the impact site and is ei-
ther  composed  of  silicate  rock  material  (called  chondrites)  or  iron  and  nickel
(called irons).

4.6 What Mixtures of Sediment Exist?
Lithogenous  and  biogenous  sediment  rarely  occur  as  absolutely  pure  deposits
that do not contain other types of sediment. For instance,

Most calcareous oozes contain some siliceous material, and vice versa (see, for
example, Figure 4.8d).
The abundance of clay-sized lithogenous particles throughout the world and
the ease with which they are transported by winds and currents means that these
particles are incorporated into every sediment type.
The composition of biogenous ooze includes up to 70% fine-grained litho-
genous clays.
Most lithogenous sediment contains small percentages of biogenous particles.
There are many types of hydrogenous sediment.
Tiny amounts of cosmogenous sediment are mixed in with all other sediment
types.

Deposits  of  sediment  on  the  ocean  floor  are  usually  a  mixture  of  different
sediment  types. Figure  4.18 shows  the  distribution  of  sediment  across  a  passive
continental  margin  and  illustrates  how  mixtures  can  occur. Typically, however,
one type of sediment dominates, which allows the deposit to be classified as pri-
marily lithogenous, biogenous, hydrogenous, or cosmogenous.

WHEN THE DINOSAURS DIED: THE CRETACEOUS TERTIARY (K T) EVENT

the  dinosaurs

The  extinction  of 
and two-thirds  of  all  plant  and  animal
species on Earth (including many marine
species) occurred about 66 million years
ago. This  extinction  marks  the  boundary
between  the  Cretaceous  (K)  and Tertiary
(T) Periods of geologic time and is known
as the K T event. Did slow climate change
lead  to  the extinction of these  organisms,
or  was  it  a  catastrophic  event? Was  their
demise related to disease, diet, predation,
or volcanic activity? Earth scientists have
long sought clues to this mystery.

In  1980, geologist  Walter  Alvarez,
his father, Nobel  Physics  Laureate  Luis
Alvarez, and two nuclear chemists, Frank
Asaro  and  Helen  Michel, reported  that
deposits  collected  in  northern  Italy  from
the K T boundary contained a clay layer
with high proportions of the metallic ele-
ment iridium (Ir). Iridium is rare in rocks
from Earth but occurs in greater concen-
tration in meteorites. Therefore, layers of
sediment that contain unusually high con-
centrations  of  iridium  suggest  that  the
material may be of extraterrestrial origin.
Additionally,
the  clay  layer  contained
shocked quartz grains, which indicate that
an  event  occurred  with  enough  force  to
fracture and partially melt pieces of quartz.
Other  deposits  from  the  K T  boundary
revealed  similar  features, supporting  the
idea  that  Earth  experienced  an  extrater-
restrial  impact  at  the  same  time  that  the
dinosaurs died.

One problem with the impact hypothe-
sis, however, is  that  volcanic  eruptions  on
Earth could create similar clay deposits en-
riched  in  iridium  and  containing  shocked

quartz. In fact, large outpourings of basaltic
volcanic  rock  in  India  (called  the  Deccan
Traps) and other locations had occurred at
about the same time as the dinosaur extinc-
tion. Also,
if  there  was  a  catastrophic
meteor impact, where was the crater?

In the early 1990s the Chicxulub (pro-
nounced  SCHICK-sue-lube )  Crater off
the Yucatán  coast  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico
was  identified  as  a  likely  candidate  be-
cause  of  its  structure, age, and  size. Its
structure  is  comparable  to  other  impact
craters  in  the  solar  system, and  its  age
matches the K T event. At 190 kilometers
(120  miles)  in  diameter, it  is  the  largest
impact crater on Earth. To create a crater
this  large, a  10-kilometer  (6-mile)-wide
meteoroid  composed  of  rock  and/or  ice
traveling  at  speeds  up  to  72,000  kilome-
ters  (45,000  miles)  per  hour  must  have

slammed  into  Earth  (Figure  4D). The
impact probably bared the sea floor in the
area  and  created  huge  waves
estimated
to  be  more  than  900  meters  (3000  feet)
high that traveled throughout the oceans.
This impact is thought to have kicked up
so  much  dust  that  it  blocked  sunlight,
chilled Earth s surface, and brought about
the  extinction  of  dinosaurs  and  other
species. In  addition, acid rains and global
fires may have added to the environmen-
tal disaster.

Supporting  evidence  for  the  meteor
impact  hypothesis  was  provided  in  1997
by  the  Ocean  Drilling  Program  (ODP).
Previous  drilling  close  to  the  impact
site did  not  reveal  any  K T  deposits.
Evidently, the  impact  and  resulting  huge
waves  had  stripped  the  ocean  floor  of  its
sediment. However, at  1600  kilometers

usually contain biogenous, hydrogenous, and cosmogenous particles, these consti-
tute only a minor percentage of the total sediment mass.

Pelagic Deposits
Figure  4.19 shows  that  pelagic  deposits  are  dominated  by  biogenous  calcareous
oozes (blue shading), which are found on the relatively shallow deep-ocean areas
along the mid-ocean ridge. Biogenous siliceous oozes are found beneath areas of

(1000 miles) from the impact site, some of
the  telltale  sediments  were  preserved  on
the sea floor. Drilling into the continental
margin  off  Florida  into  an  underwater
peninsula called the Blake Nose, the ODP
scientific  party  recovered  cores  from  the
K T  boundary  that  contain  a  complete
record of the impact (Figure 4E).

The  cores  reveal  that  before  the  im-
pact, the layers of Cretaceous-age sediment
are  filled  with  abundant  fossils  of  calcare-
ous  coccoliths  and  foraminifers  and  show
signs  of  underwater  landslide  activity
perhaps  the  effect  of  an  impact-triggered
earthquake. Above this calcareous ooze is a
20-centimeter (8-inch) thick layer of rubble
containing evidence of an impact: spherules,
tektites, shocked  quartz  from  hard-hit  ter-
restrial rock even a 2-centimeter (1-inch)
piece of reef rock from the Yucatán penin-
sula! This  layer  is  also  rich  in  iridium, just
like  other  K T  boundary  sequences. Atop
this  layer  is  a  thick, gray  clay  deposit  con-
taining meteor debris and severely reduced
numbers of coccoliths and foraminifers. Life
in  the  ocean  apparently  recovered  slowly,
taking  at  least  5000  years  before  sediment
teeming with new Tertiary-age microorgan-
isms began to be deposited.

Convincing  evidence  of  the  K T  im-
pact from this and other cores along with
the  observation  of  Comet  Shoemaker-
Levy s  1994  spectacular  collision  with
Jupiter  suggests  that  Earth  has  experi-
enced many such extraterrestrial impacts
over geologic time. In fact, nearly 200 im-
pact craters have been identified on Earth
so  far. Statistics  show  that  an  impact  the
size  of  the  K T  event  should  occur  on
Earth about once every 100 million years,
severely  affecting  life  on  Earth  as  it  did
the  dinosaurs. Nevertheless, their  extinc-
tion  made  it  possible  for  mammals  to
eventually  rise  to  the  position  of  domi-
nance they hold on Earth today.

unusually  high  biologic  productivity  such  as  the  North  Pacific, Antarctic  (light
green shading, where diatomaceous ooze occurs), and the equatorial Pacific (dark
green shading, where radiolarian ooze occurs). Fine lithogenous pelagic deposits
of abyssal clays (light brown shading) are common in deeper areas of the ocean
basins. Hydrogenous and cosmogenous sediment comprise only a small propor-
tion of pelagic deposits in the ocean.

clay  covers  38%  and  siliceous  oozes  14%  of  the  world  ocean  floor  area. The
graph also shows that the amount of ocean basin floor covered by calcareous
ooze decreases in deeper basins because they generally lie beneath the CCD.
The  dominant  oceanic  sediment  in  the  deepest  basin the  Pacific
is  abyssal
clay (see also Figure 4.19). Calcareous ooze is the most widely deposited sedi-
ment  in  the  shallower  Atlantic  and  Indian  Oceans. Siliceous  oozes  cover  a

the equatorial region (for radiolarians) and high latitudes (for diatoms). Table

How Sea Floor Sediments Represent Surface
Conditions
Microscopic  biogenous  tests  should  take  from  10  to  50  years  to  sink  from  the
ocean surface where the organisms lived to the abyssal depths where biogenous
ooze accumulates. During this time, even a sluggish horizontal ocean current of
only 0.05 kilometer (0.03 mile) per hour could carry tests as much as 22,000 kilo-
meters (13,700 miles) before they settled onto the deep-ocean floor. Why, then, do
biogenous tests on the deep-ocean floor closely reflect the population of organ-
isms  living  in  the  surface  water  directly  above?  Remarkably, about  99%  of  the
particles that fall to the ocean floor do so as part of fecal pellets, which are pro-
duced by tiny animals that eat algae and protozoans living in the water column,
digest their tissues, and excrete their hard parts. These pellets are full of the re-
mains of algae and protozoans from the surface waters (Figure 4.21) and, though
still small, are large enough to sink to the deep-ocean floor in only 10 to 15 days.

Worldwide Thickness of Marine Sediments
Figure 4.22 is a map of marine sediment thickness. The map shows that areas of
thick sediment accumulation occur on the continental shelves and rises, especially
near the mouths of major rivers. The reason sediments in these locations are so

of coccoliths and other debris.

Are there any areas of the ocean floor where no
sediment is being deposited?

Various  types  of  sediment  accumulate  on  nearly  all
areas of the ocean floor in the same way dust accu-
mulates  in  all  parts  of  your  home  (which  is  why  ma-
rine sediment is often referred to as  marine dust ).
Even  the  deep-ocean  floor  far  from  land  receives
small  amounts  of  windblown  material,  microscopic
biogenous particles, and space dust. There are some
places  in  the  ocean,  however,  where  very  little  sedi-
ment  accumulates.  A  few  such  places  include  the
South Pacific Bare Zone east of New Zealand, which
has a combination of factors that limit sediment accu-
mulation; along the continental slope, where there is
active erosion by turbidity and other deep-ocean cur-
rents; and along the mid-ocean ridge, where the age
of  the  sea  floor  is  so  young  (because  of  sea  floor
spreading)  and  the  rates  of  sediment  accumulation
far  from  land  are  so  slow  that  there  hasn t  been
enough time for sediments to accumulate.

thick  is  because  they  are  close  to  major  sources  of  lithogenous  sediment.
Conversely, areas where marine sediments are thinnest are where the ocean floor
is young, such as along the crest of the mid-ocean ridge. Since sediments accumu-
late slowly in the deep ocean and the sea floor is continually being created here,
there hasn t been enough time for much sediment to accumulate. However, as the
sea  floor  moves  away  from  the  mid-ocean  ridge, it  gets  progressively  older  and
carries a thicker pile of sediments.

4.8 What Resources Do Ocean

Sediments Provide?

The sea floor is rich in potential mineral and organic resources. Much of these re-
sources, however, are not easily accessible, so their recovery involves technologi-
cal challenges and high cost. Nevertheless, let s examine some of the most appeal-
ing exploration targets.

Energy Resources
The main energy resources associated with marine sediments are petroleum and
gas hydrates.

PETROLEUM The  ancient  remains  of  microscopic  organisms, buried  within
marine  sediments  before  they  could  decompose, are  the  source  of  today s
petroleum (oil  and  natural  gas)  deposits. Of  the  nonliving  resources  extracted
from the oceans, more than 95% of the economic value is in petroleum products.
The  percentage  of  world  oil  produced  from  offshore  regions  has  increased
from small amounts in the 1930s to more than 30% today. Most of this increase
results  from  continuing  technological  advancements  employed  by  offshore
drilling platforms (Figure 4.23). Major offshore reserves exist in the Persian Gulf,
in the Gulf of Mexico, off Southern California, in the North Sea, and in the East
Indies. Additional reserves are probably located off the north coast of Alaska and
in the Canadian Arctic, Asian seas, Africa, and Brazil. With almost no likelihood
of finding major new reserves on land, future offshore petroleum exploration will
continue  to  be  intense, especially  in  deeper  waters  of  the  continental  margins.
However, a major drawback to offshore petroleum exploration is the inevitable
oil spills caused by inadvertent leaks or blowouts during the drilling process.

GAS  HYDRATES Gas hydrates, which are also known as clathrates (clathri * a
lattice) are unusually compact chemical structures made of water and natural gas.
They form only when high pressures squeeze chilled water and gas molecules into
an  icelike  solid. Although  hydrates  can  contain  a  variety  of  gases
including
carbon  dioxide, hydrogen  sulfide, and  larger  hydrocarbons  such  as  ethane  and
propane methane hydrates are by far the most common hydrates in nature. Gas
hydrates  occur  beneath  Arctic  permafrost  areas  on  land  and  under  the  ocean
floor, where they were discovered in 1976.

In deep-ocean sediments, where pressures are high and temperatures are low,
water and natural gas combine in such a way that the gas is trapped inside a lattice-
like cage  of  water  molecules. Vessels  that  have  drilled  into  gas  hydrates  have
retrieved cores of mud mixed with chunks or layers of gas hydrates that fizzle and
decompose quickly when they are exposed to the relatively warm, low-pressure
conditions at the ocean surface. Gas hydrates resemble chunks of ice but ignite
when lit by a flame because methane and other flammable gases are released as
gas hydrates vaporize (Figure 4.24).

Most  oceanic  gas  hydrates  are  created  when  bacteria  break  down  organic
matter trapped in sea floor sediments, producing methane gas with minor amounts

4.8 What Resources Do Ocean Sediments Provide?

123

of ethane and propane. These gases can be incorporated into gas hydrates under
high-pressure  and  low-temperature  conditions. Most  ocean  floor  areas  below
525 meters (1720 feet) provide these conditions, but gas hydrates seem to be con-
fined to continental margin areas, where high productivity surface waters enrich
ocean floor sediments below with organic matter.

Studies  of  the  deep-ocean  floor  reveal  that  at  least  50  sites  worldwide  may
contain extensive gas hydrate deposits. Research suggests that at various times in
the geologic past, changes in sea level or sea floor instability have released large
quantities  of  methane, which  oxidizes  and  produces  carbon  dioxide. The  release
of methane  from  the  sea  floor  can  affect  global  climate  as  methane  and  carbon
dioxide important greenhouse gases
increase in the atmosphere. In fact, recent
analysis of sea floor sediments off Norway suggests an abrupt increase in global
temperature about 55 million years ago was driven by an explosive release of gas
hydrates from the sea floor. Sudden releases of methane hydrates have also been
linked to underwater slope failure, which can cause seismic sea waves or tsunami
(see Chapter  8, Waves and Water Dynamics ). In  addition, methane seeps sup-
port a rich community of organisms, many of which are species new to science.

Some  estimates  indicate  that  as  much  as  20  quadrillion  cubic  meters
(700 quadrillion cubic feet) of methane are locked up in sediments containing gas
hydrates. This is equivalent to about twice as much carbon as Earth s coal, oil, and
conventional gas reserves combined (Figure 4.25), so gas hydrates may potentially
be the world s largest source of usable energy. One of the major drawbacks in ex-
ploiting reserves of gas hydrate is that they rapidly decompose at surface tempera-
tures and pressures. Another problem is that they are typically spread too thinly
within  the  sea  floor  for  economical  recovery. Nonetheless, a  Japanese  research
team is currently evaluating the economic potential of methane hydrates found in
the Nankai Trough off Japan and could begin producing methane as early as 2016.

Other Resources
Other  resources  associated  with  marine  sediments  include  sand  and  gravel,
evaporative salts, phosphorite, and manganese nodules and crusts.

SAND AND GRAVEL The offshore sand and gravel industry is second in economic
value  only  to  the  petroleum  industry. Sand  and  gravel, which  includes  rock
fragments that are washed out to sea and shells of marine organisms, is mined by
offshore barges using a suction dredge. This material is primarily used as aggregate
in concrete, as a fill material in grading projects, and on recreational beaches.

Offshore  deposits  are  a  major  source  of  sand  and  gravel  in  New  England,
New York, and  throughout  the  Gulf  Coast. Many  European  countries, Iceland,
Israel, and Lebanon also depend heavily on such deposits.

Some offshore sand and gravel deposits are rich in valuable minerals. Gem-
quality diamonds, for example, are recovered from gravel deposits on the conti-
nental  shelf  offshore  of  South Africa  and Australia, where  waves  rework  them
during low stands of the sea. Sediments rich in tin have been mined offshore of
southeast Asia from Thailand to Indonesia. Platinum and gold have been found in
deposits  offshore  of gold  mining  areas  throughout  the  world, and some  Florida
beach  sands  are  rich  in  titanium. The  largest  unexplored  potential  for  metallic
minerals  in  offshore  sand  deposits  may  exist  along  the  west  coast  of  South
America, where rivers have transported Andean metallic minerals.

EVAPORATIVE  SALTS When  seawater  evaporates,
in
concentration until they can no longer remain dissolved, so they precipitate out of
solution and form salt deposits (Figure 4.26). The most economically useful salts
are gypsum and halite. Gypsum is used in plaster of Paris to make casts and molds
and is the main component in gypsum board (wallboard or sheet rock).

When will we run out of oil?

Not any time soon. However, from an economic per-
spective, when the world runs completely out of oil a
finite  resource is  not  as  relevant  as  when  produc-
tion begins  to  taper  off. When  this happens,  we  will
run  out  of  the  abundant and  cheap oil  on  which  all
industrialized  nations  depend.  Several  oil-producing
countries  are  already  past  the  peak  of  their  produc-
tion including  the  United  States  and Canada,  which
topped out in 1972. Current estimates indicate that
sometime between now and 2040, more than half of
all  known  and  likely-to-be-discovered  oil  will  be  gone.
After  that,  it  will  be  increasingly  more  costly  to  pro-
duce oil, and prices will rise dramatically unless de-
mand declines proportionately or other sources such
as  coal,  extra-heavy  oil,  tar  sands,  or  gas  hydrates
become readily available.

Scammon s Lagoon, Baja California, Mexico. Low-lying areas

Halite common  table  salt

is  widely  used  for  seasoning, curing, and  pre-
serving foods. It is also used to de-ice roads, in water conditioners, in agriculture,
and in the clothing industry for dying fabric.

In  addition, halite  is  used  in  the  production  of  chemicals  such  as  sodium
hydroxide  (to  make  soap  products), sodium  hypochlorite  (for  disinfectants,
bleaching agents, and PVC piping), sodium chlorate (for herbicides, matches, and
fireworks), and hydrochloric acid (for use in chemical applications and for clean-
ing scaled pipes). The manufacture and use of salt is one of the oldest chemical
industries.10

PHOSPHORITE  (PHOSPHATE  MINERALS) Phosphorite is  a  sedimentary  rock
consisting of various phosphate minerals containing the element phosphorus, an
important  plant  nutrient. Consequently, phosphate  deposits  can  be  used  to
produce  phosphate  fertilizer. Although  there  is  currently  no  commercial
phosphorite  mining  occurring  in  the  oceans, the  marine  reserve  is  estimated  to
exceed  45  billion  metric  tons  (50  billion  short  tons). Phosphorite  occurs  in  the
ocean at depths of less than 300 meters (1000 feet) on the continental shelf and
slope in regions of upwelling and high productivity.

Some  shallow  sand  and  mud  deposits  contain  up  to  18%  phosphate. Many
phosphorite deposits occur as nodules, with a hard crust formed around a nucleus.
The nodules may be as small as a sand grain or as large as 1 meter (3.3 feet) in di-
ameter and may contain more than 25% phosphate. For comparison, most land
sources  of  phosphate  have  been  enriched  to  more  than  31%  by  groundwater
leaching. Florida, for example, has large phosphorite deposits and supplies about
one-quarter of the world s phosphates.

MANGANESE  NODULES  AND  CRUSTS Manganese  nodules are  rounded,
hard, golf-  to  tennis-ball-sized  lumps  of  metals  that  contain  significant
concentrations  of  manganese, iron, and  smaller  concentrations  of  copper,
nickel, and cobalt, all of which  have a  variety of economic  uses. In the 1960s,
mining companies began to assess the feasibility of mining manganese nodules
from  the  deep-ocean  floor  (Figure  4.27). The  map  in  Figure  4.28 shows  that
vast  areas  of  the  sea  floor  contain  manganese  nodules, particularly  in  the
Pacific Ocean.

Technologically, mining the deep-ocean floor for manganese nodules is possi-
ble. However, the  political  issue  of  determining  international  mining  rights  at
great distances from land has hindered exploitation of this resource. In addition,
environmental concerns about mining the deep-ocean floor have not been fully
addressed. Evidence suggests that it takes at least several million years for man-
ganese nodules to form and that their formation depends on a particular set  of
physical and chemical conditions that probably do not last long at any location. In
essence, they  are  a  nonrenewable  resource  that  will  not  be  replaced  for  a  very
long time once they are mined.

Of  the  five  metals  commonly  found  in  manganese  nodules, cobalt  is  the
only  metal  deemed  strategic (essential  to  national  security)  for  the  United
States. It is required to produce dense, strong alloys with other metals for use
in high-speed cutting tools, powerful permanent magnets, and jet engine parts.
At present, the United States must import all of its cobalt from large deposits
in  southern  Africa. However, the  United  States  has  considered  deep-ocean
nodules and crusts (hard coatings on other rocks) as a more reliable source of
cobalt.

10An interesting historical note about salt is that part of a Roman soldier s pay was in salt. That por-
tion was called the salarium, from which the word salary is derived. If a soldier did not earn it, he was
not worth his salt.

In  the  1980s  cobalt-rich  manganese  crusts  were  discovered  on  the  upper
slopes of islands and seamounts that lie relatively close to shore and within the
jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  and  its  territories. The  cobalt  concentrations
in these  crusts  are  about  one-and-a-half  times  as  rich  as  the  best African  ores
and  at  least  twice  as  rich  as  deep-sea  manganese nodules. However, interest in
mining these deposits has faded because of lower metal prices from land-based
sources.

Chapter 4 Marine Sediments

Chapter in Review

Sediments that accumulate on the ocean floor are classified by origin as
lithogenous (derived  from  rock), biogenous (derived  from  organisms),
hydrogenous (derived  from  water), or  cosmogenous (derived  from  outer
space).

The  existence  of  sea  floor  spreading  was  confirmed  when  the Glomar
Challenger began the Deep Sea Drilling Project to sample ocean sediments
and  the  underlying  crust, which  was  continued  by  the  Ocean  Drilling
Program s JOIDES  Resolution. Today, the  Integrated  Ocean  Drilling
Program continues  the  important  work  of  retrieving  sediments  from  the
deep-ocean  floor. Analysis  and  interpretation  of  marine  sediments  reveal
that Earth has had an interesting and complex history including mass extinc-
tions, the drying of entire seas, global climate change, and movement of plates.

Lithogenous  sediments  reflect  the  composition  of  the  rock  from  which
they were derived. Sediment texture determined in part by the size, sort-
is  affected  greatly  by  how  the  particles
ing, and  rounding  of  particles
were  transported  (by  water, wind, ice, or  gravity)  and  the  energy  condi-
tions under which they were deposited. Coarse lithogenous material domi-
nates neritic deposits that accumulate rapidly along the margins of conti-
nents, while fine abyssal clays are found in pelagic deposits.

(SiO2)

(CaCO3)

Biogenous  sediment  consists  of  the  hard  remains (shells, bones, and
from
teeth)  of  organisms. These  are  composed  of  either  silica
diatoms and radiolarians or calcium carbonate
from foraminifers
and  coccolithophores. Accumulations  of  microscopic  shells (tests)  of
organisms must comprise at least 30% of the deposit for it to be classified
as  biogenic  ooze. Biogenous  oozes  are  the  most  common  type  of  pelagic
deposits. The rate of biological productivity relative to the rates of destruc-
tion and dilution of biogenous sediment determines whether abyssal clay
or oozes will form on the ocean floor. Siliceous ooze will form only below
areas  of  high  biologic  productivity  of  silica-secreting  organisms  at  the
surface. Calcareous  ooze will  form  only  above  the  calcite  compensation
depth  (CCD)

the  depth  where  seawater  dissolves  calcium  carbonate

although it can be covered and transported into deeper water through sea
floor spreading.

Hydrogenous  sediment includes  manganese  nodules, phosphates, car-
bonates, metal sulfides, and evaporites that precipitate directly from water
or are formed by the interaction of substances dissolved in water with ma-
terials on the ocean floor. Hydrogenous sediments represent a relatively
small proportion of marine sediment and are distributed in many diverse
environments.

Cosmogenous sediment is composed of either macroscopic meteor debris
(such  as  that  produced  during  the  K T  impact  event)  or  microscopic 
iron nickel and silicate spherules that result from asteroid collisions or extra-
terrestrial impacts. Minute amounts of cosmogenous sediment are mixed
into most other types of ocean sediment.

Although most ocean sediment is a mixture of various sediment types, it
is usually dominated by lithogenous, biogenous, hydrogenous, or cosmoge-
nous material.

The  distribution  of  neritic  and  pelagic  sediment  is  influenced  by  many
factors, including proximity to sources of lithogenous sediment, productiv-
ity of microscopic marine organisms, the depth of the ocean floor, and the
distribution  of  various  sea  floor  features. Fecal  pellets rapidly  transport
biogenous particles to the deep-ocean floor and cause the composition of
sea floor deposits to match the organisms living in surface waters immedi-
ately above them.

The most valuable nonliving resource from the ocean today is petroleum,
which  is  recovered  from  below  the  continental  shelves  and  used  as  a
source  of  energy. Gas  hydrates include  vast  deposits  of  icelike  material
that  may  someday  be  used  as  a  source  of  energy. Other  important  re-
sources include sand and gravel (including deposits of valuable minerals),
evaporative salts, phosphorite, and manganese nodules and crusts.

WATER AND SEAWATER

Why are temperature extremes found at places far from the ocean, while those areas close to the
ocean rarely experience severe temperature variations? The mild climates found in coastal regions
are made possible by the unique thermal properties of water. These and other properties of water,
which stem from the arrangement of its atoms and how its molecules stick together, give water the
ability to store vast quantities of heat and to dissolve almost everything.

Water is so common we often take it for granted, yet it is one of the most peculiar substances on
Earth. For example, almost every other liquid contracts as it approaches its freezing point, but water
actually expands as it freezes. Thus water stays at the surface as it starts to freeze, and ice floats a
rare property shared by very few other substances. If its nature were otherwise, all temperate-zone
lakes, ponds, rivers, and even oceans would eventually freeze solid from the bottom up, and life as we
know it could not exist. Instead, a floating skin of ice cocoons life in the liquid water beneath a layer
of insulation, enabling it to persist under the frozen surface.

The chemical properties of water are also essential for sustaining  all forms of life. In  fact, the
primary  component  of  all  living  organisms  is  water. The  water  content  of  organisms, for  instance,
ranges from about 65% (humans) to 95% (most plants) to 99% in some jellyfish. Water is the ideal
medium to have within our bodies because it facilitates chemical reactions. Our blood, which serves
to  transport  nutrients  and  remove  wastes  within  our  bodies, is  83%  water. The  very  presence  of
water on our planet makes life possible, and its remarkable properties make our planet livable.

The  overall  electrical  charge  of  most  atoms  is  balanced  because  each  atom
contains an equal number of protons and electrons. An oxygen atom, for example,
has  eight  protons  and  eight  electrons. Most  oxygen  atoms  also  have  eight  neu-
trons, which do not affect the overall electrical charge because neutrons are elec-
trically  neutral. The  number  of  protons  is  what  distinguishes  atoms  of  the  118
known chemical elements from one another. For example, an oxygen atom (and
only an oxygen atom) has eight protons. Similarly, a hydrogen atom (and only a
hydrogen atom) has one proton, a helium atom has two protons, and so on (for
more details, see Appendix IV, A Chemical Background: Why Water has 2 H s
and 1 O ). In some cases, an atom will lose or gain one or more electrons and thus
have an overall electrical charge. These atoms are called ions (ienai

 to go).

The Water Molecule
A molecule (molecula
a mass) is a group of two or more atoms held together
by mutually shared electrons. It is the smallest form of a substance that can exist
yet still retain the original properties of that substance. When atoms combine with
other atoms to form molecules, they share or trade electrons and establish chemi-
cal bonds. For instance, the chemical formula for water
indicates that a
water  molecule  is  composed  of  two  hydrogen  atoms  chemically  bonded  to  one
oxygen atom.

H2O

GEOMETRY Atoms can be represented as spheres of various sizes, and the more
electrons  the  atom  contains, the  larger  the  sphere. It  turns  out  that  an  oxygen
atom (with eight electrons) is about twice the size of a hydrogen atom (with one
electron). A water molecule consists of a central oxygen atom covalently bonded
to the two hydrogen atoms, which are separated by an angle of about 105 degrees
(Figure 5.2a). The covalent (co
to be strong) bonds in a water
molecule are due to the sharing of electrons between oxygen and each hydrogen
atom. They are relatively strong chemical bonds, so a lot of energy is needed to
break them.

Figure 5.2c letter symbols are used to represent the atoms in water (O for oxygen,

atoms are on the same side of the oxygen atom. This curious bend in the geometry of
the water molecule is the underlying cause of most of the unique properties of water.

POLARITY The  bent  geometry  of  the  water  molecule  gives  a  slight  overall
negative charge to the side of the oxygen atom and a slight overall positive charge
to the side of the hydrogen atoms (Figure 5.2a). This slight separation of charges

Based on simple symmetry considerations and charge separations, a water
molecule should have its two hydrogen atoms on opposite sides of the oxy-
gen  atom,  thus  producing  a  linear  shape  like  many  other  molecules.  But
water s odd shape where both hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the
oxygen atom stems from the fact that oxygen has four bonding sites, which
are  evenly  spaced  around  the oxygen  atom.  No  matter  which  two  bonding
sites are occupied by hydrogen atoms, it results in the curious bend of the

end  of  another. Water  molecules  have  polarity, too, so  they  orient  themselves
relative  to  one  another. In  water, the  positively  charged  hydrogen  area  of  one
water molecule interacts with the negatively charged oxygen end of an adjacent
water  molecule, forming  a  hydrogen  bond (Figure  5.3). The  hydrogen  bonds
between  water  molecules  are  much  weaker  than  the  covalent  bonds  that  hold
individual  water  molecules  together. In  essence, weaker  hydrogen  bonds  form
between adjacent  water  molecules  and  stronger  covalent  bonds  occur  within
water molecules.

Even though hydrogen bonds are weaker than covalent bonds, they are strong
enough  to  cause  water  molecules  to  stick  to  one  another  and  exhibit  cohesion
(cohaesus * a  clinging  together). The  cohesive  properties  of  water  cause  it  to
bead up on a waxed surface, such as a freshly waxed car. They also give water its
surface tension. Water s surface has a thin  skin that allows a glass to be filled just
above the brim without spilling any of the water. Surface tension results from the
formation of hydrogen bonds between the outermost layer of water molecules and
the underlying molecules. Water s ability to form hydrogen bonds causes it to have
the highest surface tension of any liquid except the element mercury.2

WATER:  THE  UNIVERSAL  SOLVENT Water  molecules  stick  not  only  to  other
water molecules, but also to other polar chemical compounds. In doing so, water
molecules can reduce the attraction between ions of opposite charges by as much
as 80 times. For instance, ordinary table salt
consists of
an  alternating  array  of  positively  charged  sodium  ions  and  negatively  charged
chloride  ions  (Figure  5.4a). The  electrostatic  (electro * electricity, stasis *
standing) attraction between oppositely charged ions produces an ionic (ienai *
to go) bond. When solid NaCl is placed in water, the electrostatic attraction (ionic
bonding) between the sodium and chloride  ions is reduced  by 80  times. This, in
turn, makes  it  much  easier  for  the  sodium  ions  and  chloride  ions  to  separate.
When the ions separate, the positively charged sodium ions become attracted to
the  negative  ends  of  the  water  molecules, the  negatively  charged  chloride  ions
become attracted to the positive ends of the water molecules (Figure 5.4b), and
the salt is dissolved in water. The process by which water molecules completely
surround ions is called hydration (hydra * water, ation * action or process).

Because water molecules interact with other water molecules and other polar
molecules, water is able to dissolve nearly everything.4 Given enough time, water

3Sodium is represented by the letters Na because the Latin term for sodium is natrium.
4If water is such a good solvent, why doesn t oil dissolve in water? As you might have guessed, the
chemical structure of oil is remarkably nonpolar. With no positive or negative ends to attract the
polar water molecule, oil will not dissolve in water.

How can it be that water a liquid at room tempera-
ture can be created by combining hydrogen and
oxygen two gases at room temperature?

It is true that combining two parts hydrogen gas with
one part oxygen gas produces liquid water. This can
be  accomplished  as  a  chemistry  experiment,  al-
though care should be taken because much energy is
released during the reaction (don t try this at home!).
Oftentimes, when combining two elements, the prod-
uct  has  very  different  properties  than  the  pure  sub-
stances.  For  instance,  combining  elemental  sodium
Cl2
(Na), a highly reactive metal, with pure chlorine 
a toxic nerve gas, produces cubes of harmless table

salt  (NaCl).  This  is  what  most  people  find  amazing
about chemistry.

can dissolve more substances and in greater quantity than any other known sub-
stance. This is why water is called  the universal solvent. It is also why the ocean
contains  so  much  dissolved  material an  estimated  50  quadrillion  tons  (50  mil-
lion billion tons) of salt which makes seawater taste  salty.

5.2 What Other Important Properties

Does Water Possess?

Water s other important properties include its thermal properties (such as water s
freezing and boiling points, heat capacity, and latent heats) and its density.

Water s Thermal Properties
Water exists on Earth as a solid, a liquid, and a gas and has the ability to store and
release  great  amounts  of  heat. Water s  thermal  properties  influence  the  world s
heat budget and are in part responsible for the development of tropical cyclones,
worldwide wind belts, and ocean surface currents.

HEAT, TEMPERATURE, AND CHANGES OF STATE Matter around us is usually in
one of the three common states: solid, liquid, or gas.5 What must happen to change
the  state of a  compound? The attractive  forces between  molecules  or ions in  the
substance  must  be  overcome  if  the  state  of  the  substance  is  to  be  changed  from
solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. These attractive forces include hydrogen bonds
and  van  der Waals  forces. The  van  der Waals  forces named  for  Dutch  physicist
Johannes Diderik van der Waals (1837 1923) are relatively weak interactions that
become significant only when molecules are very close together, as in the solid and
liquid states (but not the gaseous state). Energy must be added to the molecules or
ions so they can move fast enough to overcome these attractions.

What form of energy changes the state of matter? Very simply, adding or re-
moving heat is what causes a substance to change its state of matter. For instance,
adding  heat  to  ice  cubes  causes  them  to  melt  and  removing  heat  from  water
causes  ice  to  form. Before  proceeding, let s  clarify  the  difference  between  heat
and temperature:

Heat is the energy transfer from one body to another due to a difference in tem-
perature. Heat  is  proportional  to  the  energy  level  of  moving  molecules  and
thus is the total internal energy both kinetic (kinetos * moving) energy and
potential (potentia * power) energy
transferred from one body to another.
For example, water can exist as a solid, liquid, or gas depending on the amount
of  heat  added. Heat  may  be  generated  by  combustion  (a  chemical  reaction
commonly called  burning ), through other chemical reactions, by friction, or
from  radioactivity; it  can  be  transferred  by  conduction, by  convection, or  by
radiation. A calorie (calor * heat) is the amount of heat required to raise the
temperature  of  1  gram  of  water6 by  1  degree  centigrade. The  familiar  calo-
ries used to measure the energy content of foods is actually a kilocalorie, or
1000 calories. Although the metric unit for thermal energy is the joule, calories
are directly tied to some of water s thermal properties, as will be discussed in
the next section.

5Plasma is widely recognized as a fourth state of matter distinct from solids, liquids, and normal gases.
Plasma is a gaseous substance in which atoms have been ionized that is to say, stripped of electrons.
Plasma television monitors take advantage of the fact that plasmas are strongly influenced by electric
currents.
6One gram (0.035 ounce) of water is equal to about 10 drops.

FIGURE 5.5 Water in the three states of matter:
Solid, liquid, and gas. Diagram showing the three states of
matter in which water is found on Earth and the processes 
associated with changes from one state to another. Blue 
arrows (*) indicate heat released by water (which warms the
environment) as it changes state; red arrows (+) indicate
heat absorbed by water (which cools the environment).

Temperature is the direct measure of the average kinetic energy of the mole-
cules that make up a substance. The greater the temperature, the greater the
kinetic energy of the substance. Temperature changes when heat energy is
added to or removed from a substance. Temperature is usually measured in
degrees centigrade (°C) or degrees Fahrenheit (°F).

Figure 5.5 shows water molecules in  the  solid, liquid, and  gaseous states. In
the solid state (ice), water has a rigid structure and does not normally flow over
short  time  scales. Intermolecular  bonds  are  constantly  being  broken  and  re-
formed, but the molecules remain firmly attached. That is, the molecules vibrate
with energy but remain in relatively fixed positions. As a result, solids do not con-
form to the shape of their container.

In the liquid state (water), water molecules still interact with each other, but
they  have  enough  kinetic energy  to flow  past  each other  and  take  the shape of
their  container. Intermolecular  bonds  are  being  formed  and  broken  at  a  much
greater rate than in the solid state.

In  the  gaseous  state (water  vapor), water  molecules  no  longer  interact  with
one  another  except  during  random  collisions. Water  vapor  molecules  flow  very
freely, filling the volume of whatever container they are placed in.

WATER S FREEZING AND BOILING POINTS If enough heat energy is added to a
solid, it  melts  to  a  liquid. The  temperature  at  which  melting  occurs  is  the
substance s  melting  point. If  enough  heat  energy  is  removed  from  a  liquid, it
freezes  to  a  solid. The  temperature  at  which  freezing  occurs  is  the  substance s
freezing point, which is the same temperature as the melting point (Figure 5.5).
For pure water, melting and freezing occur at 0°C (32°F).7

If enough heat energy is added to a liquid, it converts to a gas. The tempera-
ture at which boiling occurs is the substance s boiling point. If enough heat energy
is removed from a gas, it condenses to a liquid. The highest temperature at which
condensation  occurs  is  the  substance s  condensation  point, which  is  the  same
temperature as the boiling point (Figure 5.5). For pure water, boiling and conden-
sation occur at 100°C (212°F).

Both the freezing and boiling points of water are unusually high compared to
other similar substances. As shown in Figure 5.6, if water followed the pattern of

additional heat energy is required to overcome its hydrogen bonds and van der
Waals forces. Thus, if not for the unusual geometry and resulting polarity of the
water molecule, all water on Earth would be boiled away and life as we know it
would not exist.

WATER S HEAT CAPACITY AND SPECIFIC HEAT Heat capacity is the amount of
heat energy required to raise the temperature of a substance by 1 degree centigrade.
Substances that have high heat capacity can absorb (or lose) large quantities of
heat with only a small change in temperature. Conversely, substances that change
temperature  rapidly  when  heat  is  applied such  as  oil  or  metals have  lower
heat capacity.

The  heat  capacity  per  unit  mass  of  a  body, called  specific  heat  capacity or
more simply specific heat, is used to more directly compare the heat capacity of
substances. For  example, as  shown  in  Figure  5.7, pure  water  has  a  high  specific
heat  capacity  that  is  exactly  1  calorie  per  gram,9 whereas  other  common  sub-
stances have much lower specific heats. Note that metals such as iron and copper
which heat up rapidly when heat is applied have capacity values that are about
10 times lower than water.

Why does water have such high heat capacity? The reason is because it takes
more energy to increase the kinetic energy of hydrogen-bonded water molecules
than it does for substances in which the dominant intermolecular interaction is the
much weaker van der Waals force. As a result, water gains or loses much more heat
than other common substances while undergoing an equal temperature change. In
addition, water resists any change in temperature, as you may have observed when
heating a large pot of water.When heat is applied to the pot, which is made of metal
that has a low heat capacity, the pot heats up quickly. The water inside the pot, how-
ever, takes a long time to heat up (hence, the tale that a watched pot never boils but
an unwatched pot boils over!). Making the water boil takes even more heat because
all  the  hydrogen  bonds  must  be  broken. The  exceptional  capacity  of  water  to
absorb large  quantities of  heat  helps explain why water  is  used in  home heating,
industrial and automobile cooling systems, and home cooking applications.

WATER S  LATENT  HEATS When  water  undergoes  a  change
of state that is, when ice melts or water freezes, or when water
boils  or  water  vapor  condenses a  large  amount  of  heat  is
absorbed or released. The amount of heat absorbed or released
is  due  to  water s  high  latent  (latent
hidden)  heats  and  is
closely related to water s unusually high heat capacity. As water
evaporates from your skin, it cools your body by absorbing heat
(this is why sweating cools your body). Conversely, if you ever
have  been  scalded  by  water  vapor
steam you  know  that
steam  releases  an  enormous  amount  of  latent  heat  when  it
condenses to a liquid.

Beginning with 1 gram of ice (lower left), the addition
of 20 calories of heat raises the temperature of the ice
by  40  degrees, from 
to  0°C  (point  a on  the
graph). The temperature remains at 0°C (32°F) even
though  more  heat  is  being  added, as  shown  by  the
plateau  on  the  graph  between  points  a and  b. The
temperature  of  the  water  does  not  change  until  80
more  calories  of  heat  energy  have  been  added. The
latent heat of melting is the energy needed to break
the  intermolecular  bonds  that  hold  water  molecules
rigidly  in  place  in  ice  crystals. The  temperature
remains  unchanged  until  most  of  the  bonds  are
broken and the mixture of ice and water has changed
completely to 1 gram of water.

(c) In the gaseous state, there are no hydrogen bonds and the

After  the  change  from  ice  to  liquid  water  has
occurred at 0°C, additional heat raises the water tem-
perature  between  points  b and  c in  Figure  5.8. As  it
does, it  takes  1  calorie  of  heat  to  raise  the  tempera-
ture of the gram of water 1°C (or 1.8°F). Therefore, another 100 calories must be
added before the gram of water reaches the boiling point of 100°C (212°F). So far,
a total of 200 calories has been added to reach point c.

Latent Heat of Vaporization The graph in Figure 5.8 flattens out again at 100°C,
between  points  c and  d. This  plateau  represents  the  latent  heat  of  vaporization,
which is 540 calories per gram for water. This is the amount of heat that must be
added  to  1  gram  of  a  substance  at  its  boiling  point  to  break  the  intermolecular
bonds and complete the change of state from liquid to vapor (gas).

The drawings in Figure 5.9, which show the structure of water molecules in
the solid, liquid, and gaseous states, help explain why the latent heat of vaporiza-
tion is so much greater than the latent heat of melting. To go from a solid to a liq-
uid, just  enough  hydrogen  bonds  must  be  broken  to  allow  water  molecules  to
slide past one another. To go from a liquid to a gas, however, all of the hydrogen
bonds must be completely broken so that individual water molecules can move
about freely.

Latent  Heat  of  Evaporation Sea surface temperatures average 20°C (68°F) or
less. How, then, does liquid water convert to vapor at the surface of the ocean? the
conversion of a liquid to a gas below the boiling point is called evaporation. At
ocean  surface  temperatures, individual  molecules  converted  from  the  liquid  to
the gaseous state have less energy than do water molecules at 100°C. To gain the
additional  energy  necessary  to  break  free  of  the  surrounding  ocean  water
molecules, an individual molecule must capture heat energy from its neighbors. In
other  words, the  molecules  left  behind  have  lost  heat  energy  to  those  that
evaporate, which explains the cooling effect of evaporation.

It  takes  more  than  540  calories  of  heat  to  produce  1  gram  of  water  vapor
from the ocean surface at temperatures less than 100°C. At 20°C (68°F), for in-
stance, the  latent  heat  of evaporation is 585 calories per gram. More heat is re-
quired  because more hydrogen bonds must be  broken. At  higher  temperatures,
liquid water has fewer hydrogen bonds because the molecules are vibrating and
jostling about more.

Latent  Heat  of  Condensation When  water  vapor  is  cooled  sufficiently, it
condenses  to  a  liquid  and  releases  its  latent  heat  of  condensation into  the
surrounding air. On a small scale, the heat released is enough to cook food; this is
how a  steamer works. On a large scale, the heat released is sufficient to power
large thunderstorms and even hurricanes (see Chapter 6, Air Sea Interaction ).

Heat absorbed

Latent Heat of Freezing Heat is also released when water freezes. The amount
of heat released when water freezes is the same amount that was absorbed when
the water was melted in the first place. Thus, the latent heat of freezing is identical
to  the  latent  heat  of  melting. Similarly, the  latent  heats  of  vaporization  and
condensation are identical.

GLOBAL THERMOSTATIC EFFECTS The thermostatic (thermos * heat, stasis *
standing) effects of  water  are  those  properties  that  act  to  moderate  changes  in
temperature, which in turn affect Earth s climate. For example, the huge amount
of heat energy exchanged in the evaporation condensation cycle helps make life
possible on Earth. The Sun radiates energy to Earth, where some is stored in the
oceans. Evaporation removes this heat energy from the oceans and carries it high
into the atmosphere. In the cooler upper atmosphere, water vapor condenses into
clouds, which are the basis of precipitation (mostly rain and snow) that releases
latent  heat  of  condensation. The  map  in  Figure  5.10 shows  how  this  cycle  of
evaporation  and  condensation  removes  huge  amounts  of  heat  energy  from  the
low-latitude oceans and adds huge amounts of heat energy to the heat-deficient
higher  latitudes. In  addition, the  heat  released  when  sea  ice  forms  further
moderates Earth s high-latitude regions.

The exchange of latent heat between ocean and atmosphere is very efficient.
For every gram of water that condenses in cooler latitudes, the amount of heat re-
leased to warm these regions equals the amount of heat removed from the tropical
ocean when that gram of water was evaporated initially. The end result is that the
thermal  properties  of  water  have  prevented  wide  variations  in  Earth s  tempera-
ture, thus  moderating  Earth s  climate. Because  rapid  change  is  the  enemy  of  all
life, our planet s moderated climate is one of the main reasons life exists on Earth.
Another  thermostatic  effect  of  the  ocean  can  be  seen  in  Figure  5.11, which
shows the temperature difference between day and night. The map shows that in
the ocean, there is only a small difference in temperature between day and night
while  the  land  experiences  a  much  greater  variation. This  difference  between
ocean and land is due to the higher heat capacity of water, which gives it the ability
to absorb the daily gains and minimize the daily losses of heat energy much more

Water s unique thermal properties include water s

Water Density
Recall from Chapter 1 that density is mass per unit volume and can be thought of
as how heavy something is for its size. Ultimately, density is related to how tightly
the molecules or ions of a substance are packed together. Typical units of density
are grams per cubic centimeter
. Pure water, for example, has a density of
1.0 g>cm3

. Temperature, salinity, and pressure all affect water density.

1g>cm32

The  density  of  most  substances  increases  as  temperature  decreases. For
example, cold air sinks and warm air rises because cold air is denser than warm
air. Density  increases  as  temperature  decreases  because  the  molecules  lose
energy and slow down, so the same number of molecules occupy less space. This
shrinkage caused by cold temperatures, called thermal contraction, also occurs in
water, but only to a certain point. As pure water cools to 4°C (39°F), its density in-
creases. From  4°C  down  to  0°C  (32°F), however, its  density  decreases. In  other
words, water  stops  contracting  and  actually  expands, which  is  highly  unusual
among  Earth s  many  substances. The  result  is  that  ice  is  less  dense  than  liquid
water, so ice floats on water. For most other substances, the solid state is denser
than the liquid state, so the solid sinks.

Why is ice less dense than water? Figure 5.12 shows how molecular packing
changes as water approaches its freezing point. From points a to c in the figure,
the  temperature  decreases  from  20°C  (68°F)  to  4°C  (39°F)  and  the  density

Lower temperature

amount of thermal motion decreases, so the water mole-
cules  occupy  less  volume. As  a  result, the  window  at
point  c contains  more  water  molecules  than  the  win-
dows at points a or b. When the temperature is lowered
below  4°C  (39°F), the  overall  volume  increases  again
because  water  molecules  begin  to  line  up  to  form  ice
crystals. Ice crystals are bulky, open, six-sided structures
in which water molecules are widely spaced. Their char-
acteristic  hexagonal  shape  (Figure  5.13)  mimics  the
hexagonal molecular structure resulting from hydrogen
bonding between water molecules (see Figure 5.9a). By
the time water fully freezes (point e), the density of the
ice  is  much  less  than  that  of  water  at  4°C  (39°F), the
temperature at which water achieves its maximum density.
When water freezes, its volume increases by about
9%. Anyone  who  has  put  a  beverage  in  a  freezer  for
to cool it down and inadvertently
forgotten about it has experienced the volume increase
associated with water s expansion as it freezes usually
resulting  in  a  burst  beverage  container  (Figure  5.14).
The force exerted when ice expands is powerful enough
to break apart rocks, split pavement on roads and side-
walks, and crack water pipes.

FIGURE 5.12 Water density as a function of tempera-
ture and the formation of ice. The density of freshwater
(red curve) as it freezes (right to left); the density of a typical
liquid is also shown (green curve). Water reaches its maxi-
mum density at 4°C, but below that water becomes less 
dense as ice begins to form. At 0°C, ice forms, its crystal 
structure expands dramatically, and density decreases.
As a result, ice floats.

Increasing  the  pressure  or  adding  dissolved  sub-
stances decreases the temperature of maximum density
for freshwater because the formation of bulky ice crystals is inhibited. Increasing
pressure increases the number of water molecules in a given volume and inhibits
the  number  of  ice  crystals  that  can  be  created. Increasing amounts  of  dissolved
substances inhibits the formation of hydrogen bonds, which further restricts the
number of ice crystals that can form. To produce ice crystals equal in volume to
those that could be produced at 4°C (39°F) in freshwater, more energy must be
removed, causing a reduction in the temperature of maximum density.

Dissolved solids reduce the freezing point of water, too. It s one of the reasons
why most seawater never freezes, except near Earth s frigid poles (and even then,
only at the surface). It s also why salt is spread on roads and sidewalks during the
winter in cold climates. The salt lowers the freezing point of water, allowing ice-
free roads and sidewalks at temperatures that are several degrees below freezing.
Web Table 5.1 summarizes the physical and biological significance of the un-

usual properties of seawater.

5.3 How Salty Is Seawater?
What is the difference between pure water and seawater? One of the most obvi-
ous  differences  is  that  seawater  contains  dissolved  substances  that  give  it  a  dis-
tinctly  salty  taste. These  dissolved  substances  are  not  simply  sodium  chloride
(table  salt)
they  include  various  other  salts, metals, and  dissolved  gases. The
oceans, in fact, contain enough salt to cover the entire planet with a layer more
than  150  meters  (500  feet)  thick  (about  the  height  of  a  50-story  skyscraper).
Unfortunately, the  salt  content  of  seawater  makes  it  unsuitable  for  drinking  or
irrigating most crops and causes it to be highly corrosive to many materials.

FIGURE 5.13 Snowflakes. Scanning electron photomicro-
graph of actual snowflakes magnified about 500 times.
Hexagonal snowflakes indicate the internal structure of
water molecules held together by hydrogen bonds.

Salinity
Salinity (salinus * salt)  is  the  total  amount  of  solid  material  dissolved  in  water
including dissolved gases (because even gases become solids at low enough tem-
peratures)  but  excluding  dissolved  organic  substances. Salinity  does  not include

fine particles being held in suspension (turbidity) or solid material in contact with
water because these materials are not dissolved. Salinity is the ratio of the mass of
dissolved substances to the mass of the water sample.

The salinity of seawater is typically about 3.5%, about 220 times saltier than
freshwater. Seawater with a salinity of 3.5% indicates that it also contains 96.5%
pure  water, as  shown  in Figure  5.15. Because  seawater  is  mostly  pure  water, its
physical properties are very similar to those of pure water, with only slight varia-
tions.

Figure 5.15 and Table 5.1 show that the elements chlorine, sodium, sulfur (as
the sulfate ion), magnesium, calcium, and potassium account for over 99% of the
dissolved  solids  in  seawater. More  than  80  other  chemical  elements  have  been
identified  in  seawater most  in  extremely  small  amounts
and  probably  all  of
Earth s naturally occurring elements exist in the sea. Remarkably, trace amounts
of dissolved components in seawater are vital for human survival (Box 5.1).

1

Salinity is often expressed in parts per thousand

For example, as 1% is
one part in 100,
is one part in 1000. When converting from percent to parts per
thousand, the decimal is simply moved one place to the right. For instance, typical
seawater salinity of 3.5% is the same as 
Advantages of expressing salinity in
parts per thousand are that decimals are often avoided and values convert directly
to  grams  of  salt  per  kilogram  of  seawater. For  example,
seawater  has 
35 grams of salt in every 1000 grams of seawater.10

FIGURE 5.14 Glass bottle shattered by frozen water.
This glass bottle was filled with water, sealed, and put into a
freezer. As water freezes, it expands by 9% as it forms 
hydrogen bonds and forms an open lattice structure, which
increased the pressure and caused the bottle to fracture.

Determining Salinity
Early methods of determining seawater salinity involved evaporating a carefully
weighed  amount  of  seawater  and  weighing  the  salts  that  precipitated  from  it.
However, the  accuracy  of  this  time-consuming  method  is  limited  because  some
water can remain bonded to salts that precipitate and some substances can evaporate
along with the water.

sometimes reported in p.s.u., or practical salinity units, which are equivalent to parts per thousand.

Another  way  to  measure  salinity  is  to  use  the  principle  of  constant  propor-
tions, which was firmly established by chemist William Dittmar when he analyzed
the  water  samples  collected  during  the  Challenger Expedition  (Box  5.2). The
principle of constant proportions states that the major dissolved constituents re-
sponsible for the salinity of seawater occur nearly everywhere in the ocean in the
exact  same  proportions, independent  of  salinity. The  ocean, therefore, is  well
mixed. When  salinity  changes, moreover, the  salts  don t  leave  (or  enter)  the

HOW TO AVOID GOITERS

FIGURE 5A A woman with goiters.

The nutritional label on containers of salt
usually  proclaims  this  product  contains
iodine, a  necessary  nutrient. Why  is  io-
dine  necessary  in  our  diets?  It  turns  out
that if a person s diet contains an insuffi-
cient amount of iodine, a potentially life-
threatening  disease  called  goiters (guttur

throat) may result (Figure 5A).

Iodine  is  used  by  the  thyroid  gland,
which  is  a  butterfly-shaped  organ  lo-
cated  in  the  neck  in  front  of  and  on  ei-
ther side of the trachea (windpipe). The
thyroid  gland  manufactures  hormones
that regulate cellular metabolism essen-
tial  for  mental  development  and  physi-
cal growth. If people lack iodine in their
diet, their  thyroid  glands  cannot  func-
tion  properly. Often, this  results  in  the
enlargement  or  swelling  of  the  thyroid
gland. Severe  symptoms  include  dry
skin, loss of hair, puffy face, weakness of
muscles, weight 
increase, diminished
vigor, mental  sluggishness, and  a  large
nodular growth on the neck called a goi-
ter. If proper steps are not taken to cor-
rect  this  disease, it  can  lead  to  cancer.
Iodine ingested regularly often begins to
reverse  the  effects. In  advanced  stages,
surgery  to  remove  the  goiter  or  expo-
sure  to  radioactivity  is  the  only  course 
of action.

How  can  you  avoid  goiters?  Fortu-
nately, goiters can be prevented with a diet
that  contains  just  trace  amounts of  iodine.
Where can you get iodine in your diet? All
products  from  the  sea  contain  trace
amounts of iodine because iodine is one of
the  many  elements  dissolved  in  seawater.
Sea  salt, seafood, seaweed, and  other  sea
products  contain  plenty  of  iodine  to  help
prevent goiters. Although goiters are rarely
a  problem  in  developed  nations  like  the
United States, goiters pose a serious health
hazard  in  many  underdeveloped  nations,
especially  those  far  from  the  sea. In  the
United  States, however, many  people  get
too much iodine in their diet, leading to the
overproduction of hormones by the thyroid
gland. That s  why  most  stores  that  sell
iodized  salt  also  carry  noniodized  salt
for those  people  who  have  a  hyperthyroid
(hyper
the  thyroid
gland)  condition  and  must  restrict  their
intake of iodine.

ocean, but  water  molecules  do. Seawater  has  constancy  of  composition, so  the
concentration  of  a  single  major  constituent  can  be  measured  to  determine  the
total salinity of a given water sample. The constituent that occurs in the greatest
abundance and is the easiest to measure accurately is the chloride ion,
The
weight of this ion in a water sample is its chlorinity.

Cl-.

In  any  sample  of  ocean  water  worldwide, the  chloride  ion  accounts  for
55.04%  of  the  total  proportion  of  dissolved  solids  (Figure  5.15 and Table  5.1).
Therefore, by measuring only the chloride ion concentration, the total salinity of a
seawater sample can be determined using the following relationship:

Salinity 

= 1.80655 * chlorinity

Standard seawater consists of ocean water analyzed for chloride ion content
to  the  nearest  ten-thousandth  of  a  part  per  thousand  by  the  Institute  of
Oceanographic Services in Wormly, England. It is then sealed in small glass vials
called ampules and sent to laboratories throughout the world for use as a refer-
ence standard in calibrating analytical equipment.

55.04%). However, if you actually divide this, you will get 1.81686, which is different from the original
value by 0.57%. Empirically, oceanographers found that seawater s constancy of composition is an
approximation and have agreed to use 1.80655 because it more accurately represents the total salinity
of seawater.

THE HMS CHALLENGER EXPEDITION: BIRTH OF OCEANOGRAPHY

Oceanography  as  a  scientific  discipline
began in 1872 with the HMS Challenger ex-
pedition, the  first  large-scale  voyage  with
the  express  purpose  of  studying  the  ocean
for scientific purposes. What inspired such a
voyage? One of the principal scientific dis-
putes in the mid 1800s was initiated by one
of the most influential biologists of his time,
Edwin Forbes (see Web Box 15.1), who as-
serted  that  life  below  about  550  meters
(1800 feet) was impossible because of high
pressure and lack of light. Could life exist in
the deep ocean? If so, what were the physi-
cal  and  chemical  conditions  there?  What
was the nature of sea floor deposits?

In 1871, the Royal Society of England
recommended that funds be raised for an
expedition  to  investigate  the  distribution
of life in the sea as well as the physical and
chemical  conditions  of  the  water  column
from  the  surface  to  the  sea  floor. The
British  government  agreed  to  sponsor
such an expedition and in 1872, a reserve
warship  was  refitted  to  support  scientific
studies  and  renamed  HMS  Challenger
(Figure  5B,
inset). It  contained  a  staff 
of  six scientists  under  the  direction  of
Charles  Wyville  Thomson, a  professor  of

natural history at Scotland s University of
Edinburgh.

From time to time during the course of
the voyage, the ship would stop to measure
the water depth using a sounding line, the
bottom temperature with newly developed
thermometers  that  could  withstand  the
high  pressure  at  depth, and  atmospheric
and meteorologic conditions. In addition, a
sample of the bottom water was collected,
and  the  bottom  sediment  was  dredged.
Other measurements included trawling the
bottom for life using a net, collecting organ-
isms  at  the  surface, determining  tempera-
ture at various depths, gathering samples of
seawater  from  certain  depths, and  record-
ing surface and deep-water currents.

Challenger returned in May 1876, after
circumnavigating  the  globe  for  nearly
three and a half years (Figure 5B). During
the  127,500-kilometer  (79,200-mile)  voy-
age, the scientists performed 492 deep-sea
soundings, dredged  the  bottom  133  times,
trawled the open water 151 times, took 263
water temperature readings, and collected
water samples from as deep as 1830 meters
(6000  feet). As  with  most  other  oceano-
graphic  expeditions,
the  real  work  of

analyzing  the  data  was  just  beginning. In
fact, it took nearly 20 years to compile the
expedition results into 50 volumes.

Major accomplishments of the voyage
included  verifying  the  existence  of  life  at
all  ocean  depths  (thus  proving  Forbes
wrong),
classifying  4717  new  marine
species, measuring  a  then-record  water
depth  of  8185  meters  (26,850  feet)  in  the
Mariana  Trench  in  the  western  North
Pacific  Ocean, demonstrating  that  the
ocean floor was not flat but had significant
relief, and discovering manganese nodules.
Pioneering  work  on  the  chemistry  of
the oceans was completed, too. Analysis by
chemist William Dittmar of 77 ocean water
samples  collected  during  the  Challenger
expedition revealed that the oceans had a
remarkably  consistent  chemical  composi-
tion, even  down  to  minor  dissolved  sub-
stances. Not  only  were  the  ratios  between
various  salts  constant  at  the  surface  from
ocean to ocean, but they were also constant
at  depth. This  relationship  is  the  basis  of
what is now known as the principle of con-
stant  proportions or  Forchammer s  princi-
ple, which  has  contributed  greatly  to  the
understanding of ocean salinity.

to transmit electric current), which increases as more substances are dissolved in
water (Figure 5.16). Salinometers can determine salinity to resolutions of better

Comparing Pure Water and Seawater
Table 5.2 compares various properties of pure water and seawater. Because sea-
water is 96.5% water, most of its physical properties are very similar to those of
pure water. For instance, the color of pure water and seawater is identical.

The  dissolved  substances  in  seawater, however, give  it  slightly  different  yet
important physical properties as compared to pure water. For example, recall that
dissolved substances interfere with pure water changing state. The freezing points
and boiling points in Table 5.2 show that dissolved substances decrease the freez-
ing point and increase the boiling point of water. Thus, seawater freezes at a tem-
perature 1.9°C (3.4°F) lower than pure water. Similarly, seawater boils at a temper-
ature 0.6°C (1.1°F) higher than pure water. As a result, the salts in seawater extend
the range of temperatures in which water is a liquid. The same principle applies to
antifreeze used in automobile radiators. Antifreeze lowers the freezing point of the
water in a radiator and increases the boiling point, thus extending the range over
which  the  water  remains  in  the  liquid  state. Antifreeze, therefore, protects  your
radiator from freezing in the winter and from boiling over in the summer.

Other  important  properties  of  seawater  (such  as  pH  and  density)  are

discussed in later parts of this chapter.

What is the strategy behind adding salt to a pot of
water when making pasta? Does it make the water 
boil faster?

Adding  salt  to  water  will  not  make  the  water  boil
faster. It will, however, make the water boil at a slightly
higher  temperature  because  dissolved  substances
raise its boiling point (and lower its freezing point; see
Table  5.2).  Thus,  the  pasta  will  cook  in  slightly  less
time. In addition, the salt adds flavoring, so the pasta
may  taste  better,  too.  Be  sure  to  add  the  salt after
the  water  has  come  to  a  boil,  though,  or  it  will  take
longer  to  reach  a  boil.  This  is  a  wonderful  use  of
chemical principles helping you to cook better!

Ive seen the labels on electric cords warning against
using electrical appliances close to water. Are these
warnings because waters polarity allows electricity to
be transmitted through it?

Yes and no. Water molecules are polar, so you might as-
sume that water is a good conductor of electricity. Pure
water is a very poor conductor, however, because water
molecules  are  neutral  overall  and  will  not  move  toward
the  negatively  or  positively  charged  pole  in  an  electrical
system. If an electrical appliance is dropped into a tub of
absolutely pure water, the water molecules will transmit
no electricity. Instead, the water molecules will simply ori-
ent  their  positively  charged  hydrogen  ends  toward  the
negative  pole  of  the  appliance  and  their  negatively
charged  oxygen  ends  toward  its  positive  pole,  which
tends to neutralize the electric field. Interestingly, it is the
dissolved  substances  that  transmit  electrical  current
through  water  (see  Figure  5.16).  Even  slight  amounts,
such as those in tap water, allow electricity to be trans-
mitted. That s why there are warning labels on the elec-
tric  cords  of  household  appliances  that  are  commonly
used in the bathroom, such as  blow dryers,  electric ra-
zors, and heaters. That s also why it is recommended to
stay  out  of  any  water
during a lightning storm!

5.4 Why Does Seawater Salinity Vary?
Using salinometers and other techniques, oceanographers have determined that
salinity varies from place to place in the oceans.

Salinity Variations
In  the  open  ocean  far  from  land, salinity  varies  between  about  33  and 
In
coastal  areas, salinity  variations  can  be  extreme. In  the  Baltic  Sea, for  example,
salinity averages only 
because physical conditions create brackish (brak *
salt, ish * somewhat) water. Brackish water is produced in areas where freshwa-
ter (from rivers and high rainfall) and seawater mix. In the Red Sea, on the other
hand, salinity  averages 
because  physical  conditions  produce  hypersaline
(hyper * excessive, salinus * salt) water. Hypersaline water is typical of seas and
inland bodies of water that experience high evaporation rates and limited open-
ocean circulation.

38

42

.

Some  of  the  most  hypersaline  water  in  the  world  is  found  in  inland  lakes,
which are often called seas because they are so salty. The Great Salt Lake in Utah,
for example, has a salinity of

dissolved  solids  and  is  almost  10  times  saltier  than  seawater. As  a  result, hyper-
saline  waters  are  so  dense  and  buoyant  that  one  can  easily  float  (Figure  5.17),
even with arms and legs sticking up above water level! Hypersaline waters also
taste much saltier than seawater.

330

,

36.4

Salinity of seawater in coastal areas also varies seasonally. For example, the
in
salinity  of  seawater  off  Miami  Beach, Florida, varies  from  about 
October  to 
in  May  and  June  when  evaporation  is  high. Offshore  of
Astoria, Oregon, seawater  salinity  is  always  relatively  low  because  of  the  vast
freshwater input from the Columbia River. Here, surface water salinity can be as
low as 
in April and May (when the Columbia River is at its maximum flow
0.3
rate) and 

in October (the dry season).

Other  types  of  water  have  much  lower  salinity. Tap  water, for  instance, has
salinity  somewhere  below

Processes Affecting Seawater Salinity
Processes  affecting  seawater  salinity  change  either  the  amount  of  water  (
H2O
molecules) or the amount of dissolved substances within the water. Adding more
water, for instance, dilutes the dissolved component and lowers the salinity of the
sample. Conversely, removing  water  increases  salinity. Changing  the  salinity  in
these ways does not affect the amount or the composition of the dissolved compo-
nents, which  remain  in  constant  proportions. Let s  first  examine  processes  that
affect the amount of water in seawater before turning our attention to processes
that influence dissolved components.

PROCESSES  THAT  DECREASE  SEAWATER  SALINITY Table 5.3 summarizes the
processes  affecting  seawater  salinity. Precipitation, runoff (stream  discharge),
melting  icebergs, and  melting  sea  ice  decrease seawater  salinity  by  adding  more
freshwater to the ocean. Precipitation is the way atmospheric water returns to Earth
as rain, snow, sleet, and hail. Worldwide, about three-quarters of all precipitation falls
directly  back  into  the  ocean  and  one-quarter  falls  onto  land. Precipitation  falling
directly into the oceans adds freshwater, reducing seawater salinity.

Most of the precipitation that falls on land returns to the oceans indirectly as
stream runoff. Even though this water dissolves minerals on land, the runoff is rel-
atively pure water, as shown in Table 5.4. Runoff, therefore, adds mostly water to
the ocean, causing seawater salinity to decrease.

Icebergs are chunks of ice that have broken free (calved) from a glacier when
it flows into an ocean or marginal sea and begins to melt. Glacial ice originates as
snowfall in high mountain areas, so icebergs are composed of freshwater. When
icebergs  melt  in  the  ocean, they  add  freshwater, which  is  another  way  in  which
seawater salinity is reduced.

Sea ice forms when ocean water freezes in high-latitude regions and is com-
posed primarily of freshwater. When warmer temperatures return to high-latitude
regions in the summer, sea ice melts in the ocean, adding mostly freshwater with a
small amount of salt to the ocean. Seawater salinity, therefore, is decreased.

PROCESSES  THAT  INCREASE  SEAWATER  SALINITY The formation of sea ice
and  evaporation  increase seawater  salinity  by  removing  water  from  the  ocean
(Table  5.3). Sea  ice  forms  when  seawater  freezes. Depending  on  the  salinity  of
seawater and the rate of ice formation, about 30% of the dissolved components in
seawater  are  retained  in  sea  ice. This  means  that 
seawater  creates  sea  ice
with  about 
). Consequently, the  formation  of
sea  ice  removes  mostly  freshwater  from  seawater, increasing  the  salinity  of  the
remaining unfrozen water. High-salinity water also has a high density, so it sinks
below the surface.

Recall that evaporation is the conversion of water molecules from the liquid
state to the vapor state at temperatures below the boiling point. Evaporation re-
moves  water  from  the  ocean,
its  dissolved  substances  behind.
Evaporation, therefore, increases seawater salinity.

THE  HYDROLOGIC  CYCLE Figure  5.18 shows  how  the  hydrologic  (hydro *
water, logos * study of) cycle relates the processes that affect seawater salinity.
These  processes  recycle  water  among  the  ocean, the  atmosphere, and  the
continents, so  water  is  in  continual  motion  between  the  different  components

What would happen to a person if he or she drank
seawater?

It depends on the quantity. The salinity of seawater is
about four times greater than that of your body fluids.
In  your  body,  seawater  causes  your  internal  mem-
branes  to  lose  water  through osmosis (osmos * to
push) which transports water molecules from higher
concentrations (the normal body chemistry of your in-
ternal  fluids)  to  areas  of  lower  concentrations  (your
digestive tract containing seawater). Thus, your natu-
ral  body  fluids  would  move  into  your  digestive  tract
and eventually be expelled, causing dehydration.

Don t worry too much if you ve inadvertently swal-
lowed some seawater. As a nutritional drink, seawa-
ter  provides  seven  important  nutrients  and  contains
no  fat,  cholesterol,  or  calories.  Some  people  even
claim that drinking a small amount of seawater daily
gives  them  good  health!  However,  beware  of  micro-
bial  contaminants  in  seawater  such  as  viruses  and
bacteria that can often exist in great quantities.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Various surface processes either decrease seawa-
ter salinity (precipitation, runoff, icebergs melting, 
or sea ice melting) or increase seawater salinity
(sea ice forming and evaporation).

Dissolved Components Added to and Removed 
from Seawater
Seawater salinity is a function of the amount of dissolved components in seawa-
ter. Interestingly, dissolved  substances  do  not  remain  in  the  ocean  forever.
Instead, they  are  cycled  into  and  out  of  seawater  by  the  processes  shown  in
Figure 5.19. These processes include stream runoff in which streams dissolve ions
from continental rocks and carry them to the sea, and volcanic eruptions, both on
the land and on the sea floor. Other sources include the atmosphere (which con-
tributes gases) and biologic interactions.

Stream  runoff  is  the  primary  method  by  which  dissolved  substances  are
added  to  the  oceans. Table  5.4 compares  the  major  components  dissolved  in
stream water with those in seawater. It shows that streams have far lower salinity
and  a  vastly  different  composition  of  dissolved  substances  than  seawater. For
example, bicarbonate ion 
is the most abundant dissolved constituent in
stream water yet is found in only trace amounts in seawater. Conversely, the most
abundant dissolved component in seawater is the chloride ion 
which exists
in very small concentrations in streams.

If stream water is the main source of dissolved substances in seawater, why
do the components of the two not match each other more closely? One of the rea-
sons  is  that  some  dissolved  substances  stay  in  the  ocean  and  accumulate  over
time. Residence time is the average length of time that a substance resides in the
ocean. Long residence times lead to higher concentrations of the dissolved sub-
stance. The  sodium  ion 
for  instance, has  a  residence  time  of  260  million
years, and, as a result, has a high concentration in the ocean. Other elements such
as  aluminum  have  a  residence  time  of  only  100  years  and  occur  in  seawater  in
much lower concentrations.

You mentioned that when seawater freezes, it pro-
duces ice with about 
salinity. Once that ice
melts, can a person drink it with no ill effects?

Early  Arctic  explorers  found  out  the  answer  to  your
question  by  necessity.  Some  of  these  explorers  who
traveled by ship in high-latitude regions became inad-
vertently or purposely entrapped by sea ice (see, for
example, Web  Box  7.1,  which  describes  the  voyage
of the Fram). Lacking other water sources, they used
melted  sea  ice.  Although  newly  formed  sea  ice  con-
tains  little  salt,  it  does  trap  a  significant  amount  of
brine (drops of salty water). Depending on the rate of
freezing,  newly  formed  ice  may  have  a  total  salinity
from 4 to 
The more rapidly it forms, the more
brine  it  captures  and  the  higher  the  salinity.  Melted
sea ice with salinity this high doesn t taste very good,
and  it  still causes  dehydration, but not as  quickly as
drinking 
seawater  does.  Over  time,  however,
the brine will trickle down through the coarse struc-
ture of the sea ice, so its salinity decreases. By the
time it is a year old, sea ice normally becomes rela-
tively  pure.  Drinking  melted  sea  ice  enabled  these
early explorers to survive.

Is Seawater Acidic or Basic?

149

Are the oceans becoming saltier through time? This might seem logical since
new dissolved components are constantly being added to the oceans and because
most salts have long residence times. However, analysis of ancient marine organ-
isms and sea floor sediments suggests that the oceans have not increased in salin-
ity over time. This must be because the rate at which an element is added to the
ocean equals the rate at which it is removed, so the average amounts of various el-
ements remain constant (this is called a steady-state condition).

Materials  added  to  the  oceans  are  counteracted  by  several  processes  that
cycle dissolved substances out of seawater. When waves break at sea, for example,
sea  spray  releases  tiny  salt  particles  into  the  atmosphere  where  they  may  be
blown over land before being washed back to Earth. The amount of material leav-
ing the ocean in this way is enormous: According to a recent study, as much as 3.3
billion  metric  tons  (3.6  billion  short  tons)  of  salt  as  sea  spray  enter  the  atmos-
phere each year. Another example is the infiltration of seawater along mid-ocean
ridges near hydrothermal vents (see Figure 5.17), which incorporates magnesium
and sulfate ions into sea floor mineral deposits. In fact, chemical studies of seawa-
ter  indicate  that  the  entire  volume  of  ocean  water is  recycled  through  this  hy-
drothermal circulation system at the mid-ocean ridge approximately every 3 mil-
lion  years. As  a  result, the  chemical  exchange  between  ocean  water  and  the
basaltic crust has a major influence on the composition of ocean water.

Dissolved  substances  are  also  removed  from  seawater  in  other  ways.
Calcium, carbonate, sulfate, sodium, and silicon are deposited in ocean sediments
within the shells of dead microscopic organisms and animal feces. Vast amounts of
dissolved substances can be removed when inland arms of seas dry up, leaving salt
deposits called evaporites (such as those beneath the Mediterranean Sea; see Web
Box  4.1). In  addition, ions  dissolved  in  ocean  water  are removed  by adsorption
(physical attachment) to the surfaces of sinking clay and biologic particles.

5.5 Is Seawater Acidic or Basic?
when dissolved in water.
An acid is a compound that releases hydrogen ions 
The resulting solution is said to be acidic. A strong acid readily and completely re-
leases  hydrogen  ions  when  dissolved  in  water. An  alkaline or  a  base is  a  com-
pound that releases hydroxide ions 
when dissolved in water. The resulting
solution  is  said  to  be  alkaline or  basic. A  strong  base  readily  and  completely
releases hydroxide ions when dissolved in water.

(OH-)

(H+)

Both  hydrogen  ions  and  hydroxide  ions  are  present  in  extremely  small
amounts  at  all  times  in  water  because  water  molecules  dissociate  and  reform.
Chemically, this is represented by the equation:

dissociate
H2O ¡ H+

reform

+ OH- 

(5.2)

Note that if the hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in a solution are due only to
the  dissociation  of  water  molecules, they  are  always  found  in  equal  concentra-
tions, and the solution is consequently neutral.

When  substances  dissociate  in  water, they  can  make  the  solution  acidic  or
basic. For  example, if  hydrochloric  acid  (HCl)  is  added  to  water, the  resulting
solution will be acidic because there will be a large excess of hydrogen ions from
the dissociation of the HCl molecules. Conversely, if a base such as baking soda
) is added to water, the resulting solution will be
(sodium bicarbonate,
basic because there will be an excess of hydroxide ions 
from the dissocia-
tion of 

molecules.

neutral solution such as pure water is 7.0. A decrease of
one pH unit corresponds to a 10-fold increase in the con-
centration  of  hydrogen  ions, making  the  water  more
acidic, whereas a change of one unit upward corresponds
to a 10-fold decrease, making the water more alkaline.

Ocean  surface  waters  have  a  pH  that  averages
about 8.1 and ranges from about 8.0 to 8.3, so seawater
is  slightly  alkaline. Water  in  the  ocean  combines  with
carbon  dioxide  to  form  a  weak  acid, called  carbonic

reactions 

The  equations  below  Figure  5.21 show  how  these
chemical 
involving  carbonate  minimize
changes  in  the  pH  of  the  ocean  in  a  process  called
buffering. Buffering protects the ocean from getting too
acidic or too basic, similar to how buffered aspirin pro-
tects  sensitive  stomachs. For  example, if  the  pH  of  the
ocean increases (becomes too basic), it causes 
to
and  pH  drops. Conversely, if  the  pH  of  the
release 
ocean decreases (becomes too acidic),
combines
with 
to  remove  it, causing  pH  to  rise. In  this  way,
buffering prevents large swings of ocean water pH and
allows  the  ocean  to  stay  within  a  limited  range  of  pH
values. Recently, however, increasing amounts of carbon
dioxide  from  human emissions  are  beginning  to  enter
the ocean and change the ocean s pH by making it more
acidic. For  more  details  on  this, see  Chapter  16, The
Oceans and Climate Change.

Deep-ocean  water  contains  more  carbon  dioxide
than  surface  water  because  deep  water  is  cold  and  has
the  ability  to  dissolve  more  gases. Also, the  higher  pressures  of  the  deep  ocean
further aid the dissolution of gases in seawater. Because carbon dioxide combines
with  water  to  form  carbonic  acid, why  isn t  the  cold  water  of  the  deep  ocean
highly acidic? When microscopic marine organisms that make their shells out of
calcium carbonate (calcite) die and sink into the deep ocean, they neutralize the
acid  through  buffering. In  essence, these  organisms  act  as  an  antacid for  the

but it varies significantly from place to place at

Surface Salinity Variation
Figure 5.22 shows how salinity varies at the surface with latitude. The red curve
shows  temperature, which  decreases  at  high  latitudes  and  increases  near  the
equator. The green curve shows salinity, which is lowest at high latitudes, highest
at the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, and dips near the equator.

Why does surface salinity vary in the pattern shown in Figure 5.22? At high
latitudes, abundant  precipitation  and  runoff  and  the  melting  of  freshwater  ice-
bergs  all  decrease  salinity. In  addition, cool  temperatures  limit  the  amount  of
evaporation that takes place (which would increase salinity). The formation and
melting of sea ice balance each other out in the course of a year and are not a fac-
tor in changes in salinity.

The  pattern  of  Earth s  atmospheric  circulation  (see  Chapter  6, Air-Sea
Interaction ) causes warm dry air to descend at lower latitudes near the Tropics
of Cancer and Capricorn, so evaporation rates are high and salinity increases. In
addition, little  precipitation  and  runoff  occur  to  decrease  salinity. As  a  result,
the regions  near  the  Tropics  of  Cancer  and  Capricorn  are  the  continental  and
maritime deserts of the world.

If water molecules are so good at dissolving almost
everything, then why does pure water have a neutral
pH of 7.0?

Indeed, pure water s neutral pH might seem surpris-
ing  in  light  of  its  tremendous  ability  to  dissolve  sub-
stances.  Intuitively,  it  seems  like  water  should  be
acidic  and  thus  have  a  low  pH.  However,  pH  meas-
ures  the  amount  of  hydrogen  ions

152

Chapter 5 Water and Seawater

Temperatures  are  warm  near  the  equator, so  evaporation  rates  are  high
enough to increase salinity. Increased precipitation and runoff partially offsets the
high  salinity, though. For  example, daily  rain  showers  are  common  along  the
equator, adding water to the ocean and lowering its salinity.

The map  in Figure 5.23 shows how ocean surface salinity varies worldwide.
Notice  how  the  overall  pattern  matches  the  graph  in  Figure  5.22. The Atlantic
Ocean s  higher  overall  salinity  is  caused  by  its  proximity  to  land, which  experi-
ences  continental  effect. This  causes  high  rates  of  evaporation  in  the  narrow
Atlantic, particularly along the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn.

Salinity Variation with Depth
Figure  5.24 shows  how  seawater  salinity  varies  with  depth. The  graph  displays
data for the open ocean far from land and shows one curve for high-latitude re-
gions and one for low-latitude regions.

For low-latitude regions (such as in the tropics), the curve begins at the sur-
face with relatively high salinity (as was discussed in the preceding section). Even
at the  equator, surface salinity is still  relatively  high. With  increasing depth, the
curve swings toward an intermediate salinity value.

For high-latitude regions (such as near Antarctica or in the Gulf of Alaska),
the curve begins at the surface with relatively low salinity (again, see the discussion
in the preceding section). With increasing depth, the curve also swings toward an
intermediate salinity value that approaches the value of the low-latitude salinity
curve at the same depth.

These two curves, which together resemble the outline of a wide Champagne
glass, show  that  salinity  varies  widely  at  the  surface, but  very  little  in  the  deep
ocean. Why is this so? It occurs because all the processes that affect seawater salin-
ity  (precipitation, runoff, melting  icebergs, melting  sea  ice, sea  ice  forming, and
evaporation) occur at the surface and thus have no effect on deep water below.

about  300  meters  (980  feet)  and  1000  meters  (3300  feet). For  the  low-latitude

an  increase in  salinity. In  both  cases, this  layer  of  rapidly  changing  salinity  with

of different salinity in the ocean.

at  4°C
The  density  of  pure  water  is  1.000  gram  per  cubic  centimeter 
(39°F). This value serves as a standard against which the density of all other sub-
stances can be measured. Seawater contains various dissolved substances that in-
crease  its  density. In  the  open  ocean, seawater  density  averages  between  1.022
and 
(depending on its salinity). Thus, the density of seawater is 2 to
3% greater than pure water. Unlike freshwater, seawater continues to increase in
density until it freezes at a temperature of 
(28.6°F) (recall that below 4°C,
the density of freshwater actually decreases; see Figure 5.12). At its freezing point,
however, seawater  behaves  in  a  similar  fashion  to  freshwater: Its  density
decreases dramatically, which is why sea ice floats, too.

Factors Affecting Seawater Density
The  ocean, like  Earth s  interior, is  layered  according  to  density. Low-density
water exists near the surface and higher density water occurs below. Except for
some shallow inland seas with a high rate of evaporation that creates high salinity
water, the highest-density water is found at the deepest ocean depths. Let s exam-
ine how temperature, salinity, and pressure influence seawater density by express-

Of these three factors, only temperature and salinity influence the density of
surface water. Pressure influences seawater density only when very high pressures
are encountered, such as in deep-ocean trenches. Still, the density of seawater in
the deep ocean is only about 5% greater than at the ocean surface, showing that
despite  tons  of  pressure  per  square  centimeter, water  is  nearly  incompressible.
Unlike air, which can be compressed and put in a tank for scuba diving, the mole-
cules in liquid water are already close together and cannot be compressed much
more. Therefore, pressure has the least effect on influencing the density of surface
water and can largely be ignored.

11A relationship where one variable decreases as a result of another variable s increase is known as an
inverse relationship, in which the two variables are inversely proportional.

Differences in ocean density cause the ocean to be lay-
ered. Seawater density increases with decreased tem-
perature, increased salinity, and increased pressure.

(low latitudes) and curves b and d (high latitudes).

Temperature, on the other hand, has the greatest influence on surface seawa-
ter density because the range of surface seawater temperature is greater than that
of salinity. In fact, only in the extreme polar areas of the ocean, where tempera-
tures are low and remain relatively constant, does salinity significantly affect den-
sity. Cold water that also has high salinity is some of the highest-density water in
the world. The density of seawater
influences  currents  in  the  deep  ocean  because  high-density  water  sinks  below
less-dense water.

Temperature and Density Variation with Depth
The four graphs in Figure 5.25 show how seawater temperature and density vary
with  depth  in  both  low-latitude  and  high-latitude  regions. Let s  examine  each
graph individually.

Figure  5.25a shows  how  temperature  varies  with  depth  in  low-latitude
regions, where surface waters are warmed by high Sun angles and constant length
of  days. However, the  Sun s  energy  does  not  penetrate  very  far  into  the  ocean.
Surface water temperatures remain relatively constant until a depth of about 300
meters (980 feet) because of good surface mixing mechanisms such as surface cur-
rents, waves, and  tides. Below  300  meters  (980  feet), the  temperature  decreases
rapidly  until  a  depth  of  about  1000  meters  (3300  feet). Below  1000  meters, the
water s low temperature again remains constant down to the ocean floor.

Figure 5.25b shows how temperature varies with depth in high-latitude regions,
where  surface  waters  remain  cool  year-round  and  deep-water  temperatures  are
about the  same  as  the surface. The temperature  curve for  high-latitude  regions,
therefore, is a straight vertical line, which indicates uniform conditions at the sur-
face and at depth.

The density curve for low-latitude regions in Figure 5.25c shows that density
is relatively low at the surface. Density is low because surface water temperatures
are high. (Remember that temperature has the greatest influence on density and
temperature is inversely proportional to density.) Below the surface, density re-
mains constant also until a depth of about 300 meters (980 feet) because of good
surface mixing. Below 300 meters (980 feet), the density increases rapidly until a
depth of about 1000 meters (3300 feet). Below 1000 meters, the water s low den-
sity again remains constant down to the ocean floor.

The  density  curve  for  high-latitude  regions  (Figure  5.25d)  shows  very  little
variation  with  depth. Density  is  relatively  high  at  the  surface  because  surface
water temperatures are low. Density is high below the surface, too, because water

How Does Seawater Density Vary With Depth?

temperature is also low. The density curve for high-latitude regions, therefore, is a
straight  vertical  line, which  indicates  uniform  conditions  at  the  surface  and  at
depth. These conditions allow cold high-density water to form at the surface, sink,
and initiate deep-ocean currents.

Temperature is the most important factor influencing seawater density, so the
temperature graphs (Figure 5.25a and Figure 5.25b) strongly resemble the corre-
sponding  density  graphs  (Figure  5.25c and  Figure  5.25d, respectively). The  only
difference is that they are a mirror image of each other, illustrating that tempera-
ture and density are inversely proportional to one another.

Thermocline and Pycnocline
Analogous  to  the  halocline  (the  layer  of  rapidly  changing  salinity  shown  in 
Figure 5.24), the  low-latitude  temperature  graph  in  Figure  5.25a displays  a
curving  line  that  indicates  a  layer  of  rapidly  changing  temperature  called  a
thermocline (thermo * heat, cline * slope). Similarly, the  low-latitude  density
graph in Figure 5.25c displays a curving line that indicates a pycnocline (pycno *
density, cline * slope), which is a layer of rapidly changing density. Note that the
high-latitude  graphs  of  temperature  (Figure  5.25b)  and  density  (Figure  5.25d)
lack both a thermocline and a pycnocline, respectively, because these lines show a
constant value with depth (they are straight lines and don t curve). Like a halo-
cline, a thermocline and a pycnocline typically occur between about 300 meters
(980 feet) and 1000 meters (3300 feet) below the surface. The temperature differ-
ence  between  water  above  and  below  the  thermocline  can  be  used  to  generate
electricity (see Web Box 5.1).

When a pycnocline is established in an area, it presents an incredible barrier
to mixing between low-density water above and high-density water below. A pyc-
nocline  has  a  high  gravitational  stability  and  thus  physically  isolates  adjacent
layers of water.12 The pycnocline results from the combined effect of the thermo-
cline  and  the  halocline, because  temperature  and  salinity  influence  density. The
interrelation of these three layers determines the degree of separation between
the upper-water and deep-water masses.

There are essentially three distinct water masses based on density. The mixed
surface  layer occurs  above  a  strong  permanent  thermocline  (and  corresponding
pycnocline). The  water  is  uniform  because  it  is  well  mixed  by  surface  currents,
waves, and tides. The thermocline and pycnocline occur in a relatively low-density
layer  called  the  upper  water, which  is  well  developed  throughout  the  low  and
middle latitudes. Denser and colder deep water extends from below the thermocline/
pycnocline to the deep-ocean floor.

At  depths  above  the  main  thermocline, divers  often  experience  lesser  ther-
moclines  (and  corresponding  pycnoclines)  when  descending  into  the  ocean.
Thermoclines can develop in swimming pools, ponds, and lakes, too. During the
spring and fall, when nights are cool but days can be quite warm, the Sun heats
the surface water of the pool yet the water below the surface can be quite cold.
If the  pool  has  not  been  mixed, a  thermocline  isolates  the  warm  surface  layer
from the deeper cold water. The cold water below the thermocline can be quite a
surprise for anyone who dives into the pool!

In  high-latitude  regions, the  temperature  of  the  surface  water  remains  cold
year round, so there is very little difference between the temperature at the sur-
face and in deep water below. Thus, a thermocline and corresponding pycnocline
rarely develop in high-latitude regions. Only during the short summer when the
days  are  long  does  the  Sun  begin  to  heat  surface  waters. Even  then, the  water

12This is similar to a temperature inversion in the atmosphere, which traps cold (high-density) air
underneath warm (low-density) air.

5.8 What Methods Are Used 
to Desalinate SeaWater?

Earth s  expanding  population  uses  freshwater  in  greater  volumes  each  year. In
the future, experts warn that more people worldwide will experience water short-
age problems, even with increased water use efficiency. Because human need for
water is growing yet its supply is dwindling, several countries have begun to use
the ocean as a source of freshwater. Desalination, or salt removal from seawater,
can provide freshwater for business, home, and agricultural use.

Although seawater is mostly just water molecules, its ability to form hydrogen
bonds, easily dissolve so many substances, and resist changes in temperature and
state makes seawater difficult to desalinate. This is why desalination is so energy-
intensive  and  so  expensive. The  high  cost  of  desalination, however, is  only  one
issue. Recent  studies, for  example, indicate  that  desalination  can  have  unwanted
environmental  effects  through  the  production  of  highly  concentrated  salt  brines
and  potential  negative  effects  on  marine  life. Still, using  the  sea  as  a  source  of
freshwater is attractive to many coastal communities that have few other sources.
Currently, there are more than 13,000 desalination plants worldwide, with the
majority very small and located in arid regions of the Middle East, Caribbean, and
Mediterranean. The United States produces only about 10% of the world s desalted
water, primarily  in  Florida. To  date, only  a  limited  number  of  desalination  plants
have been built along the California coast, primarily because the cost of desalina-
tion is generally higher than the costs of other water supply alternatives available in
California (such as water transfers and groundwater pumping) but also because the
extensive  permitting  process  is  an  impediment  to  building  desalination  facilities.
However, as  drought  conditions  occur  and  concern  over  water  availability  in-
creases, desalination projects are being proposed at numerous locations in the state.
Because desalinated water requires a lot of energy and thus is expensive to
produce, most desalination plants are small-scale operations. In fact, desalination
plants  provide  less  than  0.5%  of  human  water  needs. More  than  half  of  the
world s desalination plants use distillation to purify water, while most of the re-
maining plants use membrane processes.

Distillation
The  process  of  distillation (distillare * to  trickle)  is  shown  schematically  in
Figure 5.26. In  distillation, saltwater  is  boiled  and  the  resulting  water  vapor  is
passed through a cooling condenser where it condenses and is collected as fresh-
water. This simple procedure is very efficient at purifying seawater. For instance,
distillation  of  35
,
which is about 10 times fresher than bottled water, so it needs to be mixed with
*
less pure water to make it taste better. Distillation is expensive, however, because
it requires large amounts of heat energy to boil the saltwater. Because of water s
high latent heat of vaporization, it takes 540 calories to convert only 1 gram (0.035
ounce) of water at the boiling point to the vapor state.13 Increased efficiency, such
as using the waste heat from a power plant, is required to make distillation practi-
cal on a large scale.

seawater  produces  freshwater  with  a  salinity  of  only  0.03

*

13Even at 100% efficiency, it still requires a whopping 540,000 calories of heat energy to produce 1
liter (about 1 quart) of distilled water.

5.8 What Methods Are Used to Desalinate Seawater?

Solar distillation, which is also known as solar humidification, does not require
supplemental  heating  and  has  been  used  successfully  in  small-scale  agricultural
experiments in arid regions such as Israel, West Africa, and Peru. Solar humidifi-
cation  is  similar  to  distillation  in  that  saltwater  is  evaporated  in  a  covered  con-
tainer, but the water is heated by direct sunlight instead (Figure 5.26). Saltwater
in the container evaporates, and the water vapor that condenses on the cover runs
into collection trays. The major difficulty lies in effectively concentrating the en-
ergy of sunlight into a small area to speed evaporation.

Membrane Processes
Electrolysis can be used to desalinate seawater, too. In this method, two volumes
of  freshwater one  containing  a  positive  electrode  and  the  other  a  negative
electrode are placed on either side of a volume of seawater. The seawater is sep-
arated  from  each  of  the  freshwater  reservoirs  by  semipermeable  membranes.
These membranes are permeable to salt ions but not to water molecules. When an
electrical current is applied, positive ions such as sodium ions are attracted to the
negative  electrode, and  negative  ions  such  as  chloride  ions  are  attracted  to  the
positive electrode. In time, enough ions are removed through the membranes to
convert the seawater to freshwater. The major drawback to electrolysis is that it
requires large amounts of energy.

Reverse osmosis (osmos * to push) may have potential for large-scale desali-
nation. In osmosis, water molecules naturally pass through a thin, semipermeable
membrane from a freshwater solution to a saltwater solution. In reverse osmosis,
water  on  the  salty  side  is  highly  pressurized  to  drive  water  molecules but  not
salt  and  other  impurities
through  the  membrane  to  the  freshwater  side  (Fig-
ure  5.27). A  significant  problem  with  reverse  osmosis  is  that  the  membranes
are flimsy, become clogged, and must be replaced frequently. Advanced compos-
ite materials may help eliminate these problems because they are sturdier, pro-
vide better filtration, and last up to 10 years.

Worldwide, at  least  30  countries  are  operating  reverse  osmosis  units. Saudi
Arabia where energy from oil is cheap but water is scarce has the world s largest
reverse osmosis plant, which produces 485 million liters (128 million gallons) of de-
salted water daily. The largest plant in the United States opened in 2008 in Tampa
Bay, Florida, and produces up to 95 million liters (25 million gallons) of freshwater
per day, which provides about 10% of the drinking water supply of the Tampa Bay
region. Once permits are obtained, a new facility in Carlsbad, California, is designed
to  produce  twice as  much  freshwater  as  the Tampa  Bay  plant. Reverse osmosis  is
also used in many household water purification units and aquariums.

Other Methods of Desalination
Seawater selectively excludes dissolved substances as it freezes a process called
freeze separation. As a result, the salinity of sea ice (once it is melted) is typically
70%  lower  than  seawater. To  make  this  an  effective  desalination  technique,
though, the  water  must  be  frozen  and  thawed  multiple  times, with  the  salts
washed  from  the  ice  between  each  thawing. Like  electrolysis, freeze  separation
requires large amounts of energy, so it may be impractical except on a small scale.
Yet  another  way  to  obtain  freshwater  is  to  melt  naturally  formed  ice.
Imaginative  thinkers  have  proposed  towing  large  icebergs  to  coastal  waters  off
countries that need freshwater. Once there, the freshwater produced as the ice-
bergs melt could be captured and pumped ashore. Studies have shown that tow-
ing large Antarctic icebergs to arid regions would be technologically feasible and,
for certain Southern Hemisphere locations, economically feasible, too.

Other  novel  approaches  to  desalination  include  crystallization  of  dissolved
components  directly  from  seawater, solvent  demineralization  using  chemical
catalysts, and even making use of salt-eating bacteria!

Chapter 5 Water and Seawater

Chapter in Review

Water s remarkable properties help make life as we  know it possible on
Earth. These properties include the arrangement of its atoms, how its mol-
ecules stick together, its ability to dissolve almost everything, and its heat
storage capacity.

1

H2O

The water molecule is composed of one atom of oxygen and two atoms of
. The two hydrogen atoms, which are covalently bonded
hydrogen
to the oxygen atom, are attached to the same side of the oxygen atom and
produce a bend in the geometry of a water molecule. This geometry makes
water  molecules  polar, which  allows  them  to  form  hydrogen  bonds  with
other water molecules or other substances and gives water its remarkable
properties. Water, for example, is  the universal solvent because it can hy-
drate charged particles (ions), thereby dissolving them.

Water  is  one  of  the  few  substances  that  exists  naturally  on  Earth  in  all
three  states  of  matter (solid, liquid, gas). Hydrogen  bonding  gives  water
unusual thermal properties, such as a high freezing point 
and
a high heat capacity and high specific heat
boiling point 
(1 calorie per gram), a high latent heat of melting (80 calories per gram),
and  a  high  latent  heat  of  vaporization  (540  calories  per  gram). Water s
high heat capacity and latent heats have important implications in regulat-
ing global thermostatic effects.

Salinity is the amount of dissolved solids in ocean water. It averages about
35 grams of dissolved solids per kilogram of ocean water (35 parts per thou-
chloride,
sand [
sodium, sulfate, magnesium, calcium, and  potassium account  for  over
99%  of  the  dissolved  solids  in  ocean  water. These  ions  always  occur  in  a
constant proportion in any seawater sample, so salinity can be determined
by measuring the concentration of only one typically, the chloride ion.

The physical properties of pure water and seawater are remarkably simi-
lar, with a few notable exceptions. Compared to pure water, seawater has a
higher pH, density, and boiling point (but a lower freezing point).

Dissolved components in seawater are added and removed by a variety of
processes. Precipitation, runoff, and the melting of icebergs and sea ice add
freshwater to seawater and decrease its salinity. The formation of sea ice
and evaporation remove freshwater from seawater and increase its salin-
ity. The hydrologic cycle includes all the reservoirs of water on Earth, in-
cluding  the  oceans, which  contain  97%  of  Earth s  water. The  residence
time of various elements indicates how long they stay in the ocean and im-
plies that ocean salinity has remained constant through time.

A  natural  buffering  system based  on  the  chemical  reaction  of  carbon
dioxide  in  water  exists  in  the  ocean. This  buffering  system  regulates  any
changes in pH, creating a stable ocean environment.

The salinity of surface water varies considerably due to surface processes,
with  the  maximum  salinity  found  near  the  Tropics  of  Cancer  and
Capricorn  and  the  minimum  salinity  found  in  high-latitude  regions.
Salinity also varies with depth down to about 1000 meters (3300 feet), but
below  that  the  salinity  of  deep  water  is  very  consistent. A  halocline  is  a
layer of rapidly changing salinity.

Seawater  density 

increases  as  temperature  decreases  and  salinity
increases, though  temperature  influences  surface  seawater  density  more
strongly than salinity (the influence of pressure is negligible). Temperature
and density vary considerably with depth in low-latitude regions, creating
a  thermocline (layer  of  rapidly  changing  temperature)  and  corresponding
pycnocline (layer of rapidly changing density), both of which are generally
absent in high latitudes.

Although  desalination  of  seawater is  costly, it  provides  freshwater for
business, home, and agricultural use. Distillation, solar humidification, elec-
trolysis, freeze separation, and reverse osmosis are methods currently used
to desalinate seawater.

by the tilt of Earth s axis,

AIR SEA INTERACTION

One of the most remarkable things about our planet is that the atmosphere and the ocean act as one
interdependent system. Observations of the atmosphere ocean system show that what happens in
one causes changes in the other. Further, the two parts of this system are linked by complex feed-
back loops, some of which reinforce a change and others that nullify any changes. Surface currents in
the  oceans, for  instance, are  a  direct  result  of  Earth s  atmospheric  wind  belts. Conversely, certain
atmospheric weather phenomena are manifested in the oceans. In order to understand the behavior
of the atmosphere and the oceans, their mutual interactions and relationships must be examined.

Solar energy heats the surface of Earth and creates atmospheric winds, which, in turn, drive most
of the surface currents and waves in the ocean. Radiant energy from the Sun, therefore, is responsi-
ble  for  motion  in  the  atmosphere  and  the  ocean. Recall  from  Chapter  5 that  the  atmosphere  and
ocean use the high heat capacity of water to constantly exchange this energy, shaping Earth s global
weather patterns in the process.

Periodic extremes of atmospheric weather, such as droughts and profuse precipitation, are re-
lated  to  periodic  changes  in  oceanic  conditions. For  instance, it  was  recognized  as  far  back  as  the
1920s that El Niño an ocean event was tied to catastrophic weather events worldwide. What is as
yet unclear, however, is if changes in the ocean produce changes in the atmosphere that lead to El
Niño  conditions or  vice  versa. El  Niño Southern  Oscillation  events  are  discussed  in  Chapter  7,

Ocean Circulation.

Air sea interactions have important implications in global warming, too. A multitude of recent
studies have confirmed that the atmosphere is experiencing unprecedented warming as a result of
human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that absorb and trap heat in the atmos-
phere. This atmospheric heat is being transferred to the oceans and has the potential to cause wide-
spread marine ecosystem changes. This issue is discussed in Chapter 16, The Oceans and Climate
Change.

In this chapter, we ll examine the redistribution of solar heat by the atmosphere and its influ-
ence on oceanic conditions. First, large-scale phenomena that influence air sea interactions are stud-
ied, and then smaller scale phenomena are examined.

6.1 What Causes Earth s Seasons?
Earth revolves around the Sun along an elliptical path (Figure 6.1). The plane traced by Earth s orbit
is called the ecliptic. Earth s axis of rotation is not perpendicular ( upright ) on the ecliptic; rather, it
tilts at an angle of 23.5 degrees. Figure 6.1 shows that throughout the yearly cycle, Earth s axis always
points in the same direction, which is toward Polaris, the North Star.

FIGURE 6.1 Earth s seasons. As Earth 
orbits the Sun during one year, its axis of rota-
tion constantly tilts 23.5 degrees from perpendi-
cular (relative to the plane of the ecliptic) and
always points in the same direction, causing dif-
ferent areas to experience vertical rays of the
Sun. This tilt causes Earth to have seasons, such
as when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted 
toward the Sun during the summer (left inset),
and away from the Sun during the winter 
(right inset).

The tilt of Earth s rotational axis (and not its elliptical path) causes Earth to

have seasons. Spring, summer, fall, and winter occur as follows:

At the vernal equinox (vernus * spring; equi * equal, noct * night), which occurs
on or about March 21, the Sun is directly overhead along the equator. During
this  time, all  places  in  the  world  experience  equal  lengths  of  night  and  day
(hence the name equinox). In the Northern Hemisphere, the vernal equinox is
also known as the spring equinox.
At the summer solstice (sol * the Sun, stitium * a stoppage), which occurs on
or about June 21, the Sun reaches its most northerly point in the sky, directly
overhead along the Tropic of Cancer, at 23.5 degrees north latitude (Figure 6.1,
left inset). To an observer on Earth, the noonday Sun reaches its northernmost
or southernmost position in the sky at this time and appears to pause hence
the term solstice before beginning its next six-month cycle.
At the autumnal (autumnus * fall) equinox, which occurs on or about September 23,
the Sun is directly overhead along the equator again. In the Northern Hemisphere,
the autumnal equinox is also known as the fall equinox.
At the winter solstice, which occurs on or about December 22, the Sun is directly
overhead along the Tropic of Capricorn, at 23.5 degrees south latitude (Figure 6.1,
right inset). In the Southern Hemisphere, the seasons are reversed.Thus, the winter
solstice is the time when the Southern Hemisphere is most directly facing the Sun,
which is the beginning of the Southern Hemisphere summer.

Because Earth s rotational axis is tilted 23.5 degrees, the Sun s declination (angu-
lar  distance  from  the  equatorial  plane)  varies  between  23.5  degrees  north  and
23.5  degrees  south  of  the  equator  on  a  yearly  cycle. As  a  result, the  region
between  these  two  latitudes  (called  the  tropics)  receives  much  greater  annual
radiation than polar areas.

Seasonal  changes in the  angle  of the Sun and the length of  day profoundly
influence Earth s climate. In the Northern Hemisphere, for example, the longest
day occurs on the summer solstice and the shortest day on the winter solstice.

6.2

How Does Uneven Solar Heating Affect Earth?

163

Daily heating of Earth also influences climate in most locations. Exceptions
to this pattern occur north of the Arctic Circle (66.5 degrees north latitude) and
south of the Antarctic Circle (66.5 degrees south latitude), which at certain times
of the year do not experience daily cycles of daylight and darkness. For instance,
during  the  Northern  Hemisphere  winter, the  area  north  of  the  Arctic  Circle
receives no direct solar radiation at all and experiences up to six months of dark-
ness. At the same time, the area south of the Antarctic Circle receives continuous
radiation ( midnight Sun ), so it experiences up to six months of light. Half a year
later, during the Northern Hemisphere summer (the Southern Hemisphere winter),
the situation is reversed.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Earth s axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees, which
causes the Northern and Southern Hemispheres to
take turns  leaning toward  the Sun every six months
and results in the change of seasons.

6.2 How Does Uneven

Solar Heating Affect
Earth?

The side of Earth facing the Sun (the daytime side)
receives a tremendous dose of intense solar energy.
This energy drives the global ocean atmosphere en-
gine, creating pressure and density differences that
stir currents and waves in both the atmosphere and
the ocean.

Distribution of Solar Energy
If Earth were a flat plate in space, with its flat side
directly facing the Sun, sunlight would fall equally
on all parts of Earth. Earth is spherical, however,
so  the  amount  and  intensity  of  solar  radiation
received at higher latitudes are much less than at
lower  latitudes. The  following  factors  influence
the amount of radiation received at low and high
latitudes:

High angle of incidence
at (A) in the low latitudes
creates a small "solar
footprint" (solar energy
is focused on a narrow
area of Earth's surface)

Sunlight  strikes  low  latitudes  at  a  high  angle, so
the radiation is concentrated in a relatively small
area (area A in Figure 6.2). Sunlight strikes high
latitudes  at  a  low  angle, so  the  same  amount  of
radiation is spread over a larger area (area  B in
Figure 6.2).
Earth s atmosphere absorbs some radiation, so less radiation strikes Earth
at high latitudes than at low latitudes, because sunlight passes through more
of the atmosphere at high latitudes.
The albedo (albus * white) of various Earth materials is the percentage
of incident radiation that is reflected back to space. The average albedo
of  Earth s  surface  is  about  30%. More  radiation  is  reflected  back  to
space at high latitudes because ice has a much higher albedo than soil or
vegetation.
The angle at which sunlight strikes the ocean surface determines how much is
absorbed and how much is reflected. If the Sun shines down on a smooth sea
from directly overhead, only 2% of the radiation is reflected, but if the Sun is
only 5 degrees above the horizon, 40% is reflected back into the atmosphere
(Table 6.1). Thus, the ocean reflects more radiation at high latitudes than at low
latitudes.

identical beams of sunlight strike Earth. At A, the light beam
is focused on a narrow area of Earth s surface and produces 
a smaller  solar footprint ; at B, the light beam is dispersed
across a wide area and produces a larger  solar footprint.
Additionally, more light is reflected at B. Thus, the amount 
of solar energy received at higher latitudes is much less than
that at lower latitudes.

Because  of  all  these  reasons, the  intensity  of  radiation  at  high  latitudes  is

greatly decreased compared with that falling in the equatorial region.

Other  factors  influence  the  amount  of  solar  energy  that  reaches  Earth. For
example, the amount of radiation received at Earth s surface varies daily because
Earth  rotates  on  its  axis  so  the  surface  experiences  daylight  and  darkness  each
day. In addition, the amount of radiation varies annually due to Earth s seasons,
as discussed in the previous section.

Oceanic Heat Flow
Close to the poles, much incoming solar radiation strikes Earth s surface at low
angles. Combined with the high albedo of ice, more energy is reflected back into
space than absorbed. In contrast, between about 35 degrees
north latitude and 40 degrees south latitude,1 sunlight strikes
Earth  at  much  higher  angles  and  more  energy  is  absorbed
than reflected back into space. The graph in Figure 6.3 shows
how incoming sunlight and outgoing heat combine on a daily
basis for a net heat gain in low-latitude oceans and a net heat
loss in high-latitude oceans.

Based  on  Figure  6.3, you  might  expect  the  equatorial
zone to grow progressively warmer and the polar regions to
grow progressively cooler. The polar regions are always con-
siderably  colder  than  the  equatorial  zone, but  the  tempera-
ture  difference remains  the  same  because  excess  heat  is
transferred from the equatorial zone to the poles. How is this
accomplished? Circulation in both the oceans and the atmos-
phere transfers the heat.

6.3 What Physical Properties

Does the Atmosphere
Possess?

The  atmosphere  transfers  heat  and  water  vapor  from
place to place  on  Earth. Within  the  atmosphere, complex
relationships exist among air composition, temperature, den-
sity, water vapor  content, and  pressure. Before  we  apply
these relationships, let s examine the atmosphere s composition and some of its
physical properties.

1Note that this latitudinal range extends farther into the Southern Hemisphere because the Southern
Hemisphere has more ocean surface area in the middle latitudes than the Northern Hemisphere does.

6.3 What Physical Properties Does the Atmosphere Possess?

165

Composition of the Atmosphere
Figure 6.4 lists the composition of dry air and shows that the atmosphere consists
almost entirely of nitrogen and oxygen. Other gases include argon (an inert gas),
carbon dioxide, and others in trace amounts. Although these gases are present in
very small amounts, they can trap significant amounts of heat within the atmos-
phere. For more about how these gases trap heat in the atmosphere, see Chapter 16,

The Oceans and Climate Change.

Temperature Variation in the Atmosphere
Intuitively, it seems logical that the higher one goes in the atmosphere, the warmer
it should be since it s closer to the Sun. However, as unusual as it seems, the atmos-
phere is actually heated from below. Moreover, the Sun s energy passes through
the  Earth s  atmosphere  and  heats  the  Earth s  surface  (both  land  and  water),
which  then  reradiates  this  energy  as  heat  into  the  atmosphere. This  process  is
known as the greenhouse effect and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 16,

The Oceans and Climate Change.

Figure 6.5 shows a temperature profile of the atmosphere. The lowermost por-
tion  of  the  atmosphere, which  extends  from  the  surface  to  about  12  kilometers
(7 miles), is called the troposphere (tropo * turn, sphere * a ball) and is where all
weather is produced. The troposphere gets its name because of the abundance of
mixing that occurs within this layer of the atmosphere, mostly as a result of being
heated from below. Within the troposphere, temperature gets cooler with altitude
to the point that at high altitudes, the air temperature is well below freezing. If you
have ever flown in a jet airplane, for instance, you may have noticed that any water
on the wings or inside your window freezes during a high-altitude flight.

Density Variation in the Atmosphere
It may seem surprising that air has density, but since air is composed of mol-
ecules, it certainly does. Temperature has a dramatic effect on the density of
air. At higher temperatures, for example, air molecules move more quickly,
take up more space, and density is decreased. Thus, the general relationship
between density and temperature is as follows:

Warm air is less dense, so it rises; this is commonly expressed as  heat rises.
Cool air is more dense, so it sinks.

Figure  6.6 shows  how  a  radiator  (heater)  uses  convection  to  heat  a
room. The heater warms the nearby air and causes it to expand. This expan-
sion makes the air less dense, causing it to rise. Conversely, a cold window
cools the nearby air and causes it to contract, thereby becoming more dense,
which causes it to sink. A convection (con * with, vect * carried) cell forms,
composed of the rising and sinking air moving in a circular fashion, similar to
the convection in Earth s mantle discussed in Chapter 2.

Atmospheric Water Vapor Content
The amount of water vapor in air depends in part on the air s temperature.
Warm air, for instance, can hold more water vapor than cold air because the
air  molecules  are  moving  more  quickly  and  come  into  contact  with  more
water vapor. Thus, warm air is typically moist, and, conversely, cool air is typ-
ically dry. As a result, a warm, breezy day speeds evaporation when you hang
your laundry outside to dry.

Water vapor influences the density of air. The addition of water vapor decreases
the density of air because water vapor has a lower density than air. Thus, humid air
is less dense than dry air.

Atmospheric Pressure
Atmospheric  pressure  is  1.0  atmosphere2 (14.7  pounds  per  square  inch)  at  sea
level  and  decreases  with  increasing  altitude. Atmospheric  pressure  depends  on
the weight of the column of air above. For instance, a thick column of air produces
higher atmospheric pressure than a thin column of air. An analogy to this is water
pressure in a swimming pool: The thicker the column of water above, the higher
the  water  pressure. Thus, the  highest  pressure  in  a  pool  is  at  the  bottom  of  the
deep end.

Similarly, the thicker column of air at sea level means air pressure is high at
sea  level  and  decreases  with  increasing  elevation. When  sealed  bags  of  potato
chips or pretzels are taken to a high elevation, the pressure is much lower than
where they were sealed, sometimes causing the bags to burst! You may also have
experienced this change in pressure when your ears  popped during the takeoff
or landing of an airplane or while driving on steep mountain roads.

Changes in atmospheric pressure cause air movement as a result of changes
in the molecular density of the air. The general relationship is shown in Figure 6.7,
which indicates that:

A column of cool, dense air causes high pressure at the surface, which will lead
to sinking air (movement toward the surface and compression).
A column of warm, less dense air causes low pressure at the surface, which will
lead to rising air (movement away from the surface and expansion).

In addition, sinking air tends to warm because of its compression, while rising
air  tends  to  cool  due  to  expansion. Note  that  there  are  complex  relationships
among air composition, temperature, density, water vapor content, and pressure.

Movement of the Atmosphere
Air  always moves from high-pressure regions toward low-pressure regions. This
moving air is called wind. If a balloon is inflated and let go, what happens to the
air  inside  the  balloon?  It  rapidly  escapes, moving  from  a  high-pressure  region

FIGURE 6.7 High and low atmospheric pressure
zones. A column of cool, dense air causes high 
pressure at the surface (left), which will
lead to sinking air. A column of warm,
less dense air causes low pressure at 
the surface (right), which will
lead to rising air.

How Does the Coriolis Effect Influence Moving Objects?

inside the balloon (caused by the balloon pushing on the air inside) to the lower-
pressure region outside the balloon.

An Example: A Nonspinning Earth
Imagine  for  a  moment  that  Earth  is  not  spinning  on  its  axis  but  that  the  Sun
rotates  around  Earth, with  the  Sun  directly  above  Earth s  equator  at  all  times
(Figure  6.8). Because  more  solar  radiation  is  received  along  the  equator
than  at  the  poles, the  air  at  the  equator  in  contact  with  Earth s  surface  is
warmed. This warm, moist air rises, creating low pressure at the surface. This
rising air cools (see Figure 6.5) and releases its moisture as rain. Thus, a zone
of low pressure and much precipitation occurs along the equator.

Cool air

Warm air

As the air along the equator rises, it reaches the top of the troposphere and
begins to move toward the poles. Because the temperature is much lower at high
altitudes, the air cools, and its density increases. This cool, dense air sinks at the
poles, creating high pressure at the surface. The sinking air is quite dry because
cool air cannot hold much water vapor. Thus, there are high pressure and clear,
dry weather at the poles.

Which way will surface winds blow? Air always moves from high pressure to
low pressure, so air travels from the high pressure at the poles toward the low
pressure  at  the  equator. Thus, there  are strong  northerly  winds  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere  and  strong  southerly  winds  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere.3 The  air
warms  as  it  makes  its  way  back  to  the  equator, completing  the  loop  (called  a
convection cell or circulation cell; see Figure 6.6).

Is this fictional case of a nonspinning Earth a good analogy for what is really
happening on Earth? Actually, it is not, even though the principles that drive the
physical movement of air remain the same whether Earth is spinning or not. Let s
now examine how Earth s spin influences atmospheric circulation.

6.4 How Does the Coriolis Effect

Influence Moving Objects?

The  Coriolis  effect changes  the  intended  path  of  a  moving  body. Named  after
Gaspard Gustave de Coriolis, the French engineer who first calculated its influ-
ence in 1835, it is often incorrectly called the Coriolis force. It does not accelerate
the  moving  body, so  it  does  not  influence  the  body s  speed. As  a  result, it  is  an
effect and not a true force.

The Coriolis effect causes moving objects on Earth to follow curved paths. In
the Northern Hemisphere, an object will follow a path to the right of its intended
direction; in the Southern Hemisphere, an object will follow a path to the left of
its  intended  direction. The  directions  right  and  left  are  the  viewer s  perspective
looking in the direction in which the object is traveling. For example, the Coriolis
effect very slightly influences the movement of a ball thrown between two people.
In  the  Northern  Hemisphere, the  ball  will  veer  slightly  to  its  right  from  the
thrower s perspective.

The Coriolis effect acts on all moving objects. However, it is much more pro-
nounced on objects traveling long distances, especially north or south. This is why
the Coriolis effect has a dramatic effect on atmospheric circulation and the move-
ment of ocean currents.

The Coriolis effect is a result of Earth s rotation toward the east. More specif-
ically, the difference in the speed of Earth s rotation at different latitudes causes

3Notice that winds are named based on the direction from which they are moving.

Is it true that the Coriolis effect causes water to
drain one way in the Northern Hemisphere and the
other way in the Southern?

In  most  cases,  no.  Theoretically,  the  water
moves too slowly and the distance across a basin in
your home is too small to generate a Coriolis-induced
whirlpool (vortex) in such a basin. If all other effects
are  nullified,  however,  the  Coriolis  effect  comes  into
play  and  makes  draining  water  spiral  counterclock-
wise  north  of  the  equator  and  the  other  way  in  the
Southern Hemisphere (the same direction that hurri-
canes spin). But the Coriolis effect is extremely weak
on small systems like a basin of water. The shape and 
irregularities of the basin, local slopes, or any exter-
nal movement can easily outweigh the Coriolis effect
in determining the direction in which water drains.

If Earth is spinning so fast, why dont we feel it?

Despite Earth s constant rotation, we have the illusion
that  Earth  is  still.  The  reason  that  we  don t  feel  the
motion is because Earth rotates smoothly and quietly,
and  the  atmosphere  moves  along  with  us.  Thus,  all
sensations we receive tell us there is no motion and
the ground is comfortably at rest

the Coriolis effect. In reality, objects travel along straight-line paths,4 but Earth
rotates underneath them, making the objects appear to curve. Let s look at two
examples to help clarify this.

Example 1: Perspectives and Frames of 
Reference on a Merry-Go-Round
A merry-go-round is a useful experimental apparatus with which to test some of
the concepts of the Coriolis effect. A merry-go-round is a large circular wheel that
rotates around its center. It has bars that people hang onto while the merry-

go-round spins, as shown in Figure 6.9.

person

Imagine that you are on a merry-go-round that is spinning counter-
clockwise  as  viewed  from  above  (Figure  6.9). As  you  are  spinning,
what will happen to you if you let go of the bar? If you guessed that
you  would  fly  off  along  a  straight-line  path  perpendicular  to  the
merry-go-round (Figure 6.9, path A), that s not quite right. Your an-
gular  momentum  would  propel  you  in  a  straight  line  tangent to
your  circular  path  on  the  merry-go-round  at  the  point  where  you
let  go (Figure 6.9, path  B). The law  of  inertia states that a  moving
object will follow a straight-line path until it is compelled to change
that  path by  other forces. Thus, you  would follow a  straight-line  path
(path  B)  until  you  collide  with  some  object  such  as  other  playground
equipment  or  the  ground. From  the  perspective  of  another  person  on  the
merry-go-round, your departure along path B would appear to curve to the right
due to the merry-go-round s rotation.

Imagine  you  are  again  on  the  merry-go-round, spinning  counterclockwise,
but you are now joined by another person who is facing you directly but on the
opposite side of the merry-go-round. If you were to toss a ball to the other per-
son, what  path  would  it  appear  to  follow?  Even  though  you  threw  the  ball
straight at the other person, from your perspective the ball s path would appear
to curve to the right. That s because the frame of reference (in this example, the
merry-go-round) has rotated during the time that it took the ball to reach where
the  other  person  had  been  (Figure  6.9). A  person  viewing  the  merry-go-round
from  directly  overhead  would  observe  that  the  ball  did  indeed  travel  along  a
straight-line  path  (Figure  6.9, path  C), just  as  your  path  was  straight  when  you
let go of the merry-go-round bar. Similarly, the perspective of being on the rotat-
ing  Earth  causes  objects  to  appear  to  travel  along  curved  paths. This  is  the
Coriolis effect. The merry-go-round spinning in a counterclockwise direction is
analogous  to  the  Northern  Hemisphere  because, as  viewed  from  above  the
North Pole, Earth is spinning counterclockwise. Thus, moving objects appear to
follow  curved  paths  to  the  right of  their  intended  direction  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere.

If the other person on the merry-go-round had thrown a ball toward you, it
would also appear to have curved. From the perspective of the other person, the
ball  would  appear  to  curve  to  its  right, just  as  the  ball  you  threw  curved. From
your perspective, however, the ball thrown toward you would appear to curve to
its left. The perspective to keep in mind when considering the Coriolis effect is the
one looking in the same direction that the object is moving.

To  simulate  the  Southern  Hemisphere, the  merry-go-round  would  need  to
rotate  in  a  clockwise direction, which  is  analogous  to  Earth  when  viewed  from
above the South Pole. Thus, moving objects appear to follow curved paths to the
left of their intended direction in the Southern Hemisphere.

4Newton s first law of motion (the law of inertia) states that every body persists in its state of rest or of
uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces imposed upon it.

Example 2: A Tale of Two Missiles
The distance that a point on Earth has to travel in a day is shorter with increasing
latitude. A location near the pole, for example, travels in a circle not nearly as far
in a day as will an area near the equator. Because both areas travel their respec-
tive  distances  in  one  day, the  velocity  of  the  two  areas  must  not  be  the  same.
Figure  6.10a shows  that  as  Earth  rotates  on  its  axis, the  velocity  decreases  with
latitude, ranging  from  more  than  1600  kilometers  (1000  miles)  per  hour  at  the
equator to 0 kilometers per hour at the poles. This change in velocity with latitude
is the true cause of the Coriolis effect. The following example illustrates how veloc-
ity changes with latitude.

Imagine  that  we  have  two  missiles  that  fly  in  straight  lines  toward  their
destinations. For  simplicity, assume  that  the  flight  of  each  missile  takes  one
hour  regardless  of  the  distance  flown. The  first  missile  is  launched  from  the
North Pole toward New Orleans, Louisiana, which is at 30 degrees north lati-
tude (Figure 6.10b). Does the missile land in New Orleans? Actually, no. Earth
rotates eastward at 1400 kilometers (870 miles) per hour along the 30 degrees
latitude  line  (Figure  6.10a), so  the  missile  lands  somewhere  near  El  Paso,
Texas, 1400  kilometers  west  of  its  target. From  your  perspective  at  the  North
Pole, the path of the missile appears to curve to its right in accordance with the
Coriolis effect. In reality, New Orleans has moved out of the line of fire due to
Earth s rotation.

The  second  missile  is  launched  toward  New  Orleans  from  the  Galápagos
Islands, which  are  directly  south  of  New  Orleans  along  the  equator  (Fig-
ure 6.10b). From their position on the equator, the Galápagos Islands are moving
east  at  1600  kilometers  (1000  miles)  per  hour, 200  kilometers  (124  miles)  per
hour faster than New Orleans (Figure 6.10a). At takeoff, therefore, the missile is
also moving toward the east 200 kilometers per hour faster than New Orleans.
Thus, when  the  missile  returns  to  Earth  one  hour  later  at  the  latitude  of  New
Orleans, it will land offshore of Alabama, 200 kilometers east of New Orleans.
Again, from  your  perspective  on  the  Galápagos  Islands, the  missile  appears  to
curve to its right. Keep in mind that both of these missile examples ignore fric-
tion, which would greatly reduce the amount the missiles deflect to the right of
their intended courses.

Why are space missions launched from low-latitude
regions?

The reason that the United States launches its space
missions  from  Florida  is  to  take  advantage  of  Earth s
additional  rotational  speed  at  lower  latitudes  (note  ar-
rows  in  Figure  6.10a),  thereby  giving  space  vehicles
more  momentum  once  they  get  into  space.  And,  the
further south you go, the more momentum the rockets
naturally  obtain;  that s  why  some  countries  (such  as
France) launch rockets from their territories in tropical
islands. In fact, the multinational company Sea Launch
currently  operates  a  floating  launching  pad  along  the
equator about 1600 kilometers (1000 miles) south of
Hawaii.

Ive heard that the Coriolis effect is really a force but
it is often described as a fictitious force. What is a
fictitious force?

The forces you feel in a moving car
those that push
you back into your seat when the driver steps on the
gas  or  throw  you  sideways  when  the  car  makes
sharp  turns are  everyday  examples  of  fictitious
forces. In general, these influences arise because the
natural frame of reference for a given situation (such
as the car) is itself accelerating.

A classic example of these types of apparent influ-
ences  involves  the  Coriolis  force   and  a  pendulum.
Consider  a  back-and-forth  swinging  pendulum  that  is
suspended directly over the North Pole. To an earthly
observer, it would appear to rotate 360 degrees every
day and thus would seem to be acted upon by a side-
ways  force  (that  is,  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of
swing). If you viewed this pendulum from a stationary
point in outer space, however, it would appear to swing
in a single, fixed plane while Earth turned underneath
it. From this outer-space perspective, there is no side-
ways force deflecting the pendulum s sway. That is why
the somewhat pejorative term  fictitious  is attached to
this  force  and  also  why  Coriolis  is  more  properly
termed  an  effect  (not  a  true  force).  Similarly,  in  the
car, no real force pushes you back into your seat, your
senses  notwithstanding;  what  you  feel  is  the  moving
frame of reference caused by the car s acceleration.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
The Coriolis effect causes moving objects to curve
to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the
left in the Southern Hemisphere. It is at its maxi-
mum at the poles and is zero at the equator.

Changes in the Coriolis Effect with Latitude
The first missile (shot from the North Pole) missed the target by 1600 kilometers
(1000 miles), while the second missile (shot from the Galápagos Islands) missed its
target by only 200 kilometers (124 miles). What was responsible for the difference?
Not only does the rotational velocity of points on Earth range from 0 kilometers
per hour at the poles to more than 1600 kilometers (1000 miles) per hour at the
equator, but the rate of change of the rotational velocity (per degree of latitude)
increases as the pole is approached from the equator.

For example, the rotational velocity differs by 200 kilometers (124 miles) per
hour between the equator (0 degrees) and 30 degrees north latitude. From 30 degrees
north latitude to 60 degrees north latitude, however, the rotational velocity differs
by 600 kilometers (372 miles) per hour. Finally, from 60 degrees north latitude to
the North Pole (where the rotational velocity is zero), the rotational velocity dif-
fers by more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) per hour.

Thus, the  maximum  Coriolis  effect  is  at  the  poles, and  there  is  no  Coriolis
effect at the equator. The magnitude of the Coriolis effect depends much more,
however, on the length of time the object (such as an air mass or ocean current) is
in motion. Even at low latitudes, where the Coriolis effect is small, a large Coriolis
deflection is possible if an object is in motion for a long time. In addition, because
the Coriolis effect is caused by the difference in velocity of different latitudes on
Earth, there is no Coriolis effect for those objects moving due east or due west
along the equator.

For a summary of the Coriolis effect, see Web Table 6.1.

6.5 What Global Atmospheric
Circulation Patterns Exist?

Figure 6.11 shows atmospheric circulation and the corresponding wind belts on a
spinning Earth, which presents a more complex pattern than that of the fictional
nonspinning Earth (Figure 6.8).

Circulation Cells
The greater heating of the atmosphere over the equator causes the air to expand,
to decrease in density, and to rise. As the air rises, it cools by expansion because
the pressure is lower, and the water vapor it contains condenses and falls as rain
in  the  equatorial  zone. The  resulting  dry  air  mass  travels  north  or  south  of  the
equator. Around 30 degrees north and south latitude, the air cools off enough to
become denser than the surrounding air, so it begins to descend, completing the
loop  (Figure  6.11). These  circulation  cells  are  called  Hadley  cells after  noted
English meteorologist George Hadley (1685 1768).

In addition to Hadley cells, each hemisphere has a Ferrel cell between 30 and 60

degrees latitude and a polar cell between 60 and 90 degrees latitude.The Ferrel cell
named after American meteorologist William Ferrel (1817 1891), who invented the
three-cell per hemisphere model for atmospheric circulation is not driven solely by
differences in solar heating; if it were, air within it would circulate in the opposite di-
rection. Similar to the movement of interlocking gears, the Ferrel cell moves in the di-
rection that coincides with the movement of the two adjoining circulation cells.

Pressure
A column of cool, dense air moves toward the surface and creates high pressure. The
descending air at about  30  degrees north and south latitude creates high-pressure
zones called the subtropical highs. Similarly, descending air at the poles creates high-
pressure regions called the polar highs.

What  kind  of  weather  is  experienced  in  these  high-pressure  areas?
Descending air is quite dry and it tends to warm under its own weight, so these
areas typically experience dry, clear, fair conditions. The conditions are not neces-
sarily warm (such as at the poles)

just dry and associated with clear skies.

A column of warm, low density air rises  away from the surface and creates
the
low pressure. Thus, rising air creates a band of low pressure at the equator
equatorial low and at about 60 degrees north and south latitude the subpolar low.

What is the origin of the name horse latitudes?

The  term horse latitudes supposedly  originates  from
the  days  when  Spanish  sailing  vessels  transported
horses across the Atlantic to the West Indies. Ships
would  often  become  becalmed  in  mid-ocean  due  to
the  light  winds  in  these  latitudes,  thus  severely  pro-
longing  the  voyage;  the  resulting  water  shortages
would make it necessary for crews to dispose of their
horses  overboard  (see  the  chapter-opening  quote).
Alternatively,  the  term  might  also  have  originated  by
seamen  who  were  paid  an  advance  called  the  dead
horse   before  a  long  voyage.  A  few  months  into  the
voyage, the  dead horse  was officially worked off; this
was  also  about  the  same  time  sailing  vessels  were
stuck  in  the  middle  of  the  ocean  without  wind,  so
these regions became known as the horse latitudes.

The weather in areas of low pressure is dominated by cloudy conditions with lots
of precipitation, because rising air cools and cannot hold its water vapor.

Wind Belts
that is, the part that is closest to
The lowermost portion of the circulation cells
the surface
generates the major wind belts of the world. The masses of air that
move across Earth s surface from the subtropical high-pressure belts toward the
equatorial  low-pressure  belt  constitute  the  trade  winds. These  steady  winds  are
named from the term to blow trade, which means to blow in a regular course. If
Earth did not rotate, these winds would blow in a north south direction. In the
Northern Hemisphere, however, the northeast trade winds curve to the right due
to  the  Coriolis  effect  and  blow  from  northeast  to  southwest. In  the  Southern
Hemisphere, on the other hand, the southeast trade winds curve to the left due to
the Coriolis effect and blow from southeast to northwest.

Some of the air that descends in the subtropical regions moves along Earth s sur-
face to higher latitudes as the prevailing westerly wind belts. Because of the Coriolis
effect, the  prevailing  westerlies  blow  from  southwest  to  northeast  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere and from northwest to southeast in the Southern Hemisphere.

Air  moves  away  from  the  high  pressure  at  the  poles, too, producing  the  polar
easterly wind belts. The Coriolis effect is maximized at high latitudes, so these winds
are deflected strongly. The polar easterlies blow from the northeast in the Northern
Hemisphere, and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere. When the polar
easterlies come into contact with the prevailing westerlies near the subpolar low pres-
sure belts (at 60 degrees north and south latitude), the warmer, less dense air of the
prevailing westerlies rises above the colder, more dense air of the polar easterlies.

Boundaries
The boundary between the two trade wind belts along the equator is known as
the  doldrums (doldrum * dull)  because, long  ago, sailing  ships  were  becalmed
there by the lack of winds. Sometimes stranded for days or weeks, the situation
was unfortunate but not life-threatening: Daily rain showers supplied sailors with
plenty  of  freshwater. Today, meteorologists  refer  to  this  region  as  the
Intertropical  Convergence  Zone  (ITCZ), because  it  is  the  region  between  the
tropics where the trade winds converge (Figure 6.11).

The boundary between the trade winds and the prevailing westerlies (centered
at 30 degrees north or south latitude) is known as the horse latitudes. Sinking air in
these  regions  causes  high  atmospheric  pressure  (associated  with  the  subtropical
high pressure) and results in clear, dry, and fair conditions. Because the air is sink-
ing, the horse latitudes are known for surface winds that are light and variable.

The  boundary  between  the  prevailing  westerlies  and  the  polar  easterlies  at
60 degrees  north  or  south  latitude  is  known  as  the  polar  front. This  is  a  battle-
ground for different air masses, so cloudy conditions and lots of precipitation are
common here.

Clear, dry, fair conditions are associated with the high pressure at the poles, so
precipitation is minimal. The poles are often classified as cold deserts because the
annual precipitation is so low.

Table 6.2 summarizes the characteristics of global wind belts and boundaries.

Circulation Cells: Idealized or Real?
The three-cell  model of atmospheric circulation first proposed by  Ferrel  pro-
vides a simplified model of the general circulation pattern on Earth. This circu-
lation model is idealized and does not always match the complexities observed

and  polar  cells. Nonetheless, it  generally  matches  the  pattern  of  major  wind
belts  of  the  world  and  provides  a  general  framework  for  understanding  why
they exist.

Further, the following factors significantly alter the idealized wind, pressure,

and atmospheric circulation patterns illustrated in Figure 6.11:

1. The tilt of Earth s rotation axis, which produces seasons

2. The  lower  heat  capacity  of  continental  rock  compared  to  seawater,5 which
makes the air over continents colder in winter and warmer in summer than
the air over adjacent oceans

3. The uneven distribution of land and ocean over Earth s surface, which partic-

ularly affects patterns in the Northern Hemisphere

During winter, therefore, the continents usually develop atmospheric high-
pressure  cells  from  the  weight  of  cold  air  centered  over  them  and, during  the
summer, they usually develop low-pressure cells (Figure 6.12). In fact, such sea-
sonal shifts in atmospheric pressure over Asia cause monsoon winds, which have
a dramatic effect on Indian Ocean currents and will be discussed in Chapter 7,
Ocean Circulation. In general, however, the patterns of atmospheric high- and
low-pressure zones shown in Figure 6.12 corresponds closely to those shown in
Figure 6.11.

Global  wind  belts  have  had  a  profound  effect  on  ocean  explorations
(Box 6.1). The world s wind belts also closely match the pattern of ocean surface
currents, which are discussed in Chapter 7, Ocean Circulation.

5An object that has low heat capacity heats up quickly when heat energy is applied. Recall from
Figure 5.7 that water has one of the highest specific heat capacities of common substances.

6.6 What Weather and Climate

Patterns Does the Ocean Exhibit?

Because of the ocean s huge extent over Earth s surface and also because of water s
unusual thermal properties, the ocean dramatically influences global weather and
climate patterns.

Weather Versus Climate
Weather describes  the  conditions  of  the  atmosphere  at  a  given  time  and  place.
Climate is  the  long-term  average  of  weather. If  we  observe  the  weather  condi-
tions in an area over a long period, we can begin to draw some conclusions about
its climate. For instance, if the weather in an area is dry over many years, we can
say that the area has an arid climate.

Winds
Recall that air always moves from high pressure toward low pressure and that the
movement of air is called wind. However, as air moves away from high-pressure
regions and toward low-pressure regions, the Coriolis effect modifies its direction.
In the Northern Hemisphere, for example, air moving from high to low pressure
curves to the right and results in a counterclockwise6 flow of air around low-pressure
cells  [called  cyclonic  (kyklon * moving  in  a  circle)  flow]. Similarly, as  the  air
leaves the high-pressure region and curves to the right, it establishes a clockwise
flow of air around high-pressure cells (called anticyclonic flow). Figure 6.13 shows
how a screwdriver can help you remember how air moves around high- and low-
pressure regions: High pressures are similar to a high screw that needs to be tight-
ened, so a screwdriver would be turned clockwise; low pressures are similar to a
tightened  screw  that  needs  to  be  loosened, so  a  screwdriver  would  be  turned

6These directions are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere.

WHY CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS NEVER SET FOOT ON NORTH AMERICA

The 
Italian  navigator  and  explorer
Christopher  Columbus is widely credited
with  discovering  North  America  in  the
year 1492. However, America was already
populated  with  many  natives, and  the
Vikings  predated  his  voyage  to  North
America  by  about  500  years. Moreover,
the pattern of the major wind belts of the
world  prevented  his  sailing  ships  from
reaching continental North America dur-
ing his four voyages.

Rather than sailing east, Columbus was
determined to reach the East Indies (today
the  country  of  Indonesia)  by  sailing  west
across the Atlantic Ocean.An astronomer in
Florence, Italy, named Toscanelli was the first
to suggest such a route in a letter to the king
of  Portugal. Columbus 
later  contacted
Toscanelli  and  was  told
how  far  he  would  have  to
sail  west  to  reach  India.
Today, we  know  that  this
distance  would  have  car-
ried him just west of North
America.

After  years  of  diffi-
culties  in  initiating  the
voyage, Columbus 
re-
ceived the financial back-
ing  of  the  Spanish  mon-
archs  Ferdinand  V  and
Isabella I. He set sail with
88  men  and  three  ships
(the  Niña, the  Pinta, and
the  Santa  María)  on
August  3, 1492, from  the  Canary  Islands
off  Africa  (Figure  6A). The  Canary
Islands  are  located  at  28  degrees  north
latitude  and  are  within  the  northeast
trade winds, which blow steadily from the
northeast  to  the  southwest. Instead  of
sailing directly west, which would have al-
lowed Columbus to reach central Florida,
the  map 
that
Columbus sailed a more southerly route.

in  Figure  6A shows 

During  the  morning  of  October  12,
1492, the first land was sighted; this is gen-
erally believed to have been Watling Island
in  the  Bahama  Islands  southeast  of
Florida. Based on the inaccurate informa-

tion  he  had  been  given, Columbus  was
convinced that he had arrived in the East
Indies  and  was  somewhere  near  India.
Consequently, he  called  the  inhabitants
Indians, and the area is known today as
the West  Indies. Later  during  this  voyage,
he  explored  the  coasts  of  Cuba  and
Hispaniola (the island comprising modern-
day Haiti and the Dominican Republic).

On his return journey, he sailed to the
northeast  and  picked  up  the  prevailing
westerlies, which  transported  him  away
from  North  America  and  toward  Spain.
Upon  his  return  to  Spain  and  the  an-
nouncement  of  his  discovery, additional
voyages  were  planned. Columbus  made
three  more  trips  across  the  Atlantic
Ocean, following  similar  paths  through

the  Atlantic. Thus, his  ships  were  con-
trolled  by  the  trade  winds  on  the  out-
bound  voyage  and  the  prevailing  wester-
lies  on  the  return  trip. During  his  next
voyage,
in  1493, Columbus  explored
Puerto Rico and the Leeward Islands and
established  a  colony  on  Hispaniola. In
1498, he  explored  Venezuela  and  landed
on  South  America, unaware  that  it  was
a new  continent  to  Europeans. On  his
last voyage  in  1502, he  reached  Central

counterclockwise. Because  winter  high-pressure  cells  are  replaced
by  summer  low-pressure  cells  over  the  continents, wind  patterns
associated with continents often reverse themselves seasonally.

SEA  AND  LAND  BREEZES Other  factors  that  influence  regional
winds, especially in coastal areas, are sea breezes and land breezes
(Figure 6.14). When an equal amount of solar energy is applied to
both land and ocean, the land heats up about five times more due to
its lower heat capacity. The land heats the air around it and, during
the afternoon, the warm, low-density air over the land rises. Rising
air creates a low-pressure region over the land, pulling the cooler
air over the ocean toward land, creating what is known as a sea
breeze. At  night, the  land  surface  cools  about  five  times  more
rapidly than the ocean and cools the air around it. This cool,
high-density  air  sinks, creating  a  high-pressure  region  that
causes  the  wind  to  blow  from  the  land. This  is  known  as  a
land breeze, and it is most prominent in the late evening and
early morning hours.

Rising air

Storms and Fronts
At  very  high  and  very  low  latitudes, there  is  little
daily  and  minor  seasonal  change  in  weather.7
Equatorial  regions  are  usually  warm, damp, and
typically  calm, because  the  dominant  direction  of
air movement in the doldrums is upward. Midday
rains  are  common, even  during  the  supposedly
dry season. It is within the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees north or

south latitude where storms are common.

Storms are  atmospheric  disturbances  characterized  by  strong  winds, pre-
cipitation, and often thunder and lightning. Due to the seasonal change of pres-
sure systems over continents, air masses from the high and low latitudes may
move  into  the  middle  latitudes, meet, and  produce  severe  storms. Air  masses
are large volumes of air that have a definite area of origin and distinctive char-
acteristics. Several  air  masses  influence  the  United  States, including  polar  air
masses  and  tropical  air  masses  (Figure  6.15). Some  air  masses  originate  over
land (c * continental) and are therefore dryer, but most originate over the sea
(m  * maritime) and are moist. Some are colder (P  * polar; A  * Arctic) and
some are warm (T * tropical). Typically, the United States is influenced more
by polar air masses during the winter and more by tropical air masses during
the summer.

As  polar  and  tropical  air  masses  move  into  the  middle  latitudes, they  also
move  gradually  in  an  easterly  direction. A  warm  front is  the  contact  between
a warm  air  mass  moving  into  an  area  occupied  by  cold  air. A  cold  front is  the
contact  between  a  cold  air  mass  moving  into  an  area  occupied  by  warm  air
(Figure 6.16).

These confrontations are brought about by the movement of the jet stream,
which is a narrow, fast-moving, easterly flowing air mass. It exists above the mid-
dle  latitudes  just  below  the  top  of  the  troposphere, centered  at  an  altitude  of
about 10 kilometers (6 miles). It usually follows a wavy path and may cause un-
usual weather by steering a polar air mass far to the south or a tropical air mass
far to the north.

FIGURE 6.13 High- and low-pressure regions and air
flow. As air moves away from a high-pressure region (H) 
toward a low-pressure region (L), the Coriolis effect causes
the air to curve to the right in the Northern Hemisphere.
This results in clockwise winds around high-pressure 
regions (anticyclonic flow) and counterclockwise winds
around low-pressure regions (cyclonic flow). One way to 
remember this is to think of high pressures as being similar 
to a high screw that needs tightening (clockwise motion) 
and low pressures as being similar to a tightened screw 
that needs loosening (counterclockwise motion).

Regardless of whether a warm front or cold front is produced, the warmer,
less-dense  air  always  rises  above  the  denser  cold  air. The  warm  air  cools  as  it
rises, so  its  water  vapor  condenses  as  precipitation. A  cold  front  is  usually
steeper, and  the  temperature  difference  across  it  is  greater  than  a  warm  front.
Therefore, rainfall along a cold front is usually heavier and briefer than rainfall
along a warm front.

Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes)
Tropical cyclones (kyklon * moving in a circle) are huge rotating masses of low
pressure  characterized  by  strong  winds  and  torrential  rain. They  are  the  largest
storm systems on Earth, though they are not associated with any fronts. In North
and South America, tropical cyclones are called hurricanes (Huracan * Taino god
of wind); in the western North Pacific Ocean, they are called typhoons (tai-fung *
great  wind); and  in  the  Indian  Ocean, they  are  called  cyclones. No  matter  what
they are called, tropical cyclones can be highly destructive. In fact, the energy con-
tained in a single hurricane is greater than that generated by all energy sources in
the United States over the past 20 years.

ORIGIN Remarkably, what  powers  tropical  storms  is  the  release  of  vast
amounts  of  water s  latent  heat  of  condensation8 that  is  carried  within  water
vapor  and  is  released  as  water  condenses  to  form  clouds  in  a  hurricane.
A tropical  cyclone  begins  as  a  low-pressure  cell  that  breaks  away  from
the equatorial  low-pressure  belt  and  grows  as  it  picks  up  heat  energy  in  the

following  manner. Surface  winds feed  moisture  (in  the  form  of  water  vapor)
into the storm. When water evaporates, it stores tremendous amounts of heat in
the  form  of  latent  heat  of  evaporation. When  water  vapor  condenses  into  a
liquid (in this case, clouds and rain), it releases this stored heat
latent heat of
condensation into the surrounding atmosphere, which causes the atmosphere
to warm and the air to rise. This rising air causes surface pressure to decrease,
drawing additional warm moist surface air into the storm. This air, as it rises and
cools, condenses  into  clouds  and  releases  even  more  latent  heat, further
powering  the  storm  and  continuously  repeating  itself, each  time  intensifying
the storm.

Tropical storms are classified according to their maximum sustained wind speed:

If winds are less than 61 kilometers (38 miles) per hour, the storm is classified
as a tropical depression.
If  winds  are  between  61  and  120  kilometers  (38  and  74  miles)  per  hour, the
storm is called a tropical storm.
If  winds  exceed  120  kilometers  (74  miles)  per  hour, the  storm  is  a  tropical
cyclone.

The  Saffir-Simpson  Scale of  hurricane  intensity  (Table  6.3)  further  divides
tropical cyclones into categories based on wind speed and damage. In some cases,
in fact, the wind in tropical cyclones attains speeds as high as 400 kilometers (250
miles) per hour!

Worldwide, about 100 storms grow to hurricane status each year. The condi-

tions needed to create a hurricane are as follows:

Hurricanes

The  Coriolis  effect, which  causes  the  hurricane  to  spin  counterclockwise
in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. No
hurricanes  occur  directly  on  the  equator  because  the  Coriolis  effect  is
zero there.9

These conditions are found during the late summer and early fall, when the
tropical and subtropical oceans are at their maximum temperature. Even though
hurricanes  sometimes  form  outside  of  hurricane  season  (Box  6.2), the  official
Atlantic basin hurricane season is from June 1 to November 30 each year. These
dates conventionally delimit the period when most tropical cyclones form in the
Atlantic basin.

MOVEMENT When  hurricanes  are  initiated  in  the  low  latitudes, they  are
affected by the trade winds and  generally move  from east to west across ocean
basins. Hurricanes typically last from 5 to 10 days and sometimes migrate into the
middle latitudes  (Figure  6.17). In  rare  cases, hurricanes  have  done  considerable
damage  to  the  northeast  United  States  and  have  even  affected  Nova  Scotia,
Canada. Figure 6.17 also shows how hurricanes are affected by the Coriolis effect:
In  the  Northern  Hemisphere, they  curve  to  the  right  and  in  the  Southern
Hemisphere, they curve to the left. Moreover, this serves to carry them out of the
tropics  and  over  land  or  cooler  water, where  their  energy  source  is  cut  off,
eventually causing the hurricane to dissipate.

The  diameter  of  a  typical  hurricane  is  less  than  200  kilometers  (124  miles),
although  extremely  large  hurricanes  can  exceed  diameters  of  800  kilometers
(500 miles). As air moves across the ocean surface toward the low-pressure cen-
ter, it  is  drawn  up  around  the  eye  of  the  hurricane (Figure  6.18). The  air  in  the
vicinity  of  the  eye  spirals  upward, so  horizontal  wind  speeds  may  be  less  than
15 kilometers (25 miles) per hour. The eye of the hurricane, therefore, is usually
calm. Hurricanes are composed of spiral rain bands where intense rainfall caused
by severe thunderstorms can produce tens of centimeters (several inches) of rain-
fall per hour.

TYPES OF DESTRUCTION Destruction from hurricanes is caused by high winds
and flooding from intense rainfall. Storm surge, however, causes the majority of a
hurricane s coastal destruction. In fact, storm surge is responsible for 90% of the
deaths associated with hurricanes.

When a hurricane develops over the ocean, its low-pressure center produces
a  low  hill of  water  (Figure  6.19). As  the  hurricane  migrates  across  the  open
ocean, the  hill  moves  with  it. As  the  hurricane  approaches  shallow  water  near
shore, the portion of the hill over which the wind is blowing shoreward produces a
mass of elevated, wind-driven water. This mass of water
can
be as high as 12 meters (40 feet), resulting in a dramatic increase in sea level at
the  shore, large  storm  waves, and  tremendous  destruction  to  low-lying  coastal
areas (particularly if it occurs at high tide). In addition, the area of the coast that
is hit with the right front quadrant of the hurricane where onshore winds fur-
ther  pile  up  water
experiences  the  most  severe  storm  surge  (Figure  6.19).
Table 6.3 shows typical storm surge heights associated with Saffir-Simpson hurricane
intensities.

HISTORIC DESTRUCTION Periodic destruction from hurricanes occurs along the
East  Coast  and  the  Gulf  Coast  regions  of  the  United  States. In  fact, the  most
deadly  natural  disaster  in  U.S. history  was  caused  by  a  hurricane  that  struck
Galveston  Island, Texas, in  September  1900. Galveston  Island  is  a  thin  strip  of

9An unusual confluence of weather conditions in 2001 created the first-ever documented instance of
a tropical cyclone almost directly over the equator. Statistical models indicate that such an event oc-
curs only once every 300 400 years.

THE RECORD-BREAKING 2005 ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON: HURRICANES
KATRINA, RITA, AND WILMA

Although  the  official  Atlantic  hurricane
season extends  each  year  from  June  1  to
November 30, the 2005 Atlantic hurricane
season  persisted  into  January  2006  and
was  the  most  active  season  on  record,
shattering  numerous  records. For  exam-
ple, a  record  27  named  tropical  storms
formed, of which a record 15 became hur-
ricanes. Of these, seven strengthened into
major  hurricanes, a  record-tying  five  be-
came Category 4 hurricanes and a record
four  reached  Category  5  strength, the
highest  categorization  for  hurricanes  on
the  Saffir-Simpson  Scale  of  hurricane  in-
tensity  (see Table  6.3). For  the  first  time
ever, NOAA s  National  Hurricane
Center, which  oversees  the  naming  of
Atlantic Hurricanes, ran out  of the  usual
names for storms and resorted to naming
storms using the Greek alphabet.

The most notable storms of the 2005
season  were  the  five  Category  4  and
Category  5  hurricanes: Dennis, Emily,
Katrina, Rita, and  Wilma. These  storms
made  a  combined  twelve  landfalls  as
major hurricanes (Category 3 strength or
higher) throughout Cuba, Mexico, and the
Gulf  Coast  of  the  United  States, causing
more  than  $100  billion  in  damages  and
over 2000 deaths.

Hurricane  Katrina,

the 
hurricane 

sixth-
strongest  Atlantic 
ever
recorded, was the costliest and one of the
deadliest  hurricanes 
in  U.S. history.
Katrina  formed  over  the  Bahamas  on
August  23  and  crossed  southern  Florida
as  a  moderate  Category  1  hurricane  be-
fore passing over the warm Loop Current
and  strengthening  rapidly  in  the  Gulf  of
Mexico, causing  it  to  become  one  of  the
strongest hurricanes ever recorded in the
Gulf. The  storm  weakened  considerably
before  making  its  second  landfall  as  a
Category  3  storm  on  the  morning  of
August  29  in  southeast  Louisiana  (Fig-
ure 6B). Still, Katrina was the largest hur-
ricane  of  its  strength  to  make  landfall  in
the  United  States  in  recorded  history;
its sheer  size  caused  devastation  over  a

hurricane of its strength to make landfall in the United States in recorded
history, had a diameter of about 670 kilometers (415 miles); its counter-
clockwise direction of flow and prominent central eye are also visible.
Katrina caused levees to breach and flooded New Orleans (bottom),
which caused damages of more than $75 billion and claimed at least 
1600 lives.

cane. Rita s 6-meter (20-foot) storm surge
caused extensive damage along the coasts
of  Louisiana  and  extreme  southeastern
Texas, completely destroying some coastal
communities  and  causing  $10  billion  in
damage.

the 

same 

Later  during 

season,
Hurricane  Wilma  set  numerous  records
for  both  strength  and  seasonal  activity.
Wilma was only the third Category 5 ever
to develop during the month of October,
and its pressure of 88,200 Pascal (882 mil-
libars, or  0.871  atmosphere)  ranked  it  as
the most intense hurricane ever recorded
in  the  Atlantic  basin. Its  maximum  sus-
tained  near-surface  wind  speed  reached
282 kilometers (175 miles) per hour, with
gusts up to 320 kilometers (200 miles) per
hour. Wilma  made  several  landfalls, with
the  most  destructive  effects  felt  in  the
Yucatán  Peninsula  of  Mexico, Cuba, and
southern Florida. At least 62 deaths were
reported, and  damage  was  estimated  at
$16  to  20  billion  ($12.2  billion  in  the
United States), ranking Wilma among the
top  10  costliest  hurricanes  ever  recorded
in  the  Atlantic  and  the  sixth  costliest
storm in U.S. history. Wilma also affected
11  countries  with  winds  or  rainfall, more
than any other hurricane in recent history.

radius  of  370  kilometers  (230  miles).
Katrina s 9-meter (30-foot) storm surge
the  highest  ever  recorded  in  the  United
States
caused  severe  damage  along  the
coasts  of  Mississippi, Louisiana, and
Alabama.

Worse yet, Katrina was on a collision
course  with  New  Orleans. This  scenario
was  considered  a  potential  catastrophe
because  nearly  all  of  the  New  Orleans
metropolitan area is below sea level along
Lake  Pontchartrain. Even  without  a  di-
rect hit, the storm surge from Katrina was
forecast  to  be  greater  than  the  height  of
the  levees  protecting  New  Orleans. This
risk  of  devastation  was  well  known; sev-
eral previous studies warned that a direct
hurricane  strike  on  New  Orleans  could
lead  to  massive  flooding, which  would
lead to  thousands  of  drowning deaths, as
well as many more suffering from disease
and  dehydration  after  the  hurricane
passed. Although  Katrina  passed  to  the
east  of  New  Orleans, levees  separating
Lake  Pontchartrain  from  New  Orleans
were  breached  by  Katrina s  high  winds,
storm  surge, and  heavy  rains, ultimately
flooding  roughly  80%  of  the  city  and
many  neighboring  areas  (Figure  6B).
Damages  from  Katrina  are  estimated  to

have been $75 billion, easily making it the
costliest  hurricane  in  U.S. history. The
storm  also  left  hundreds  of  thousands
homeless  and  killed  at  least  1600  people,
making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since
the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. The lack
of  adequate  disaster  response  by  the
Federal  Emergency  Management Agency
(FEMA) led to a U.S. Senate investigation
in 2006 that recommended disbanding the
agency  and  creating  a  new  National
Preparedness and Response Agency.

Hurricane  Rita  set  records  as  the
fourth  most  intense  Atlantic  hurricane
ever recorded and the most intense tropi-
cal  cyclone  observed  in  the  Gulf  of
Mexico, breaking the record set by Katrina
just  three  weeks  earlier. Rita  reached  its
maximum intensity on September 21, with
sustained  winds  of  290  kilometers  (180
miles)  per  hour  and  an  estimated  mini-
mum  pressure  of  89,500  Pascal  (895  mil-
libars, or  0.884  atmosphere). Hurricane
Rita s  unusually  rapid  intensification  in
the  Gulf  can  likely  be  attributed  to  its
passage  over  the  warm  Loop  Current  as
well  as  higher-than-normal  sea  surface
temperatures in the Gulf. Rita made land-
fall  on  September  24  near  the  Texas-
Louisiana  border  as  a  Category  3  hurri-

sand called a barrier island located in the Gulf of Mexico off Texas (Figure 6.20).
In 1900, it was a popular beach resort that averaged only 1.5 meters (5 feet) above
sea  level. At  least  6000  people  in  and  around  Galveston  were  killed  when  the
hurricane s 6-meter (20-foot)-high storm surge completely submerged the island,
accompanied by heavy rainfall and winds of 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour.

Category 4 hurricanes like the one in 1900 that made landfall in Galveston
have  been  surpassed  by  Category  5  hurricanes  only  three  times  in  the  United
States: (1)  in  1935, an  unnamed  hurricane10 flattened  the  Florida  Keys; (2)  in
1969, Hurricane  Camille  struck  Mississippi; and  (3) in  1992, Hurricane Andrew
came ashore in southern Florida, with winds as high as 258 kilometers (160 miles)
per  hour, ripping  down  every  tree  in  its  path  as  it  crossed  the  Everglades.
Hurricane Andrew did more than $26.5 billion of damage in Florida and along
the Gulf Coast. In the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, more than 250,000 people
were left homeless and although most people heeded the warnings to evacuate,
54 were killed.

In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch proved to be one of the most devastating
tropical cyclones to affect the Western Hemisphere. At its peak, it was estimated to
have winds of 290 kilometers (180 miles) per hour a strong Category 5 hurricane.

10Prior to 1950, Atlantic hurricanes were not named, but this hurricane is often referred to as the
Labor Day Hurricane because it came ashore then. Today, hurricanes are named by forecasters
using an alphabetized list of female and male names.

FIGURE 6.17 Historic tropical cyclone tracks. Color-coded map showing the intensity and paths of tropical cyclones (which, depending on the area,
can also be called hurricanes or typhoons) over the past 150 years. Cyclones originate in low-latitude regions that have warm ocean surface temperatures
(red shading). Once formed, cyclones are influenced by the trade winds, so generally travel from east to west. Note that cyclones curve to the right north of
the equator and to the left south of the equator because of the Coriolis effect, which causes cyclones to track away from the tropics into cooler water or
land (and sometimes into the middle latitudes), where they die out.

It hit Central America with winds of 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour and as
much as 130 centimeters (51 inches) of total rainfall, causing widespread flooding
and mudslides in Honduras and Nicaragua that destroyed entire towns. The hurri-
cane resulted in more than 11,000 deaths, left more than 2 million homeless, and
caused more than $10 billion in damage across the region.

In September 2008, Hurricane Ike reached Category 4 in the Gulf of Mexico
and made landfall near Galveston in low-lying Gilchrist,Texas, as a Category 2 hur-
ricane. Ike resulted in 146 deaths and $24 billion in damages (Figure 6.21), making
it  the  third  costliest  U.S. hurricane  of  all  time, behind  only  Hurricane  Katrina
(2005) and Hurricane Andrew (1992).

The majority of the world s tropical cyclones are formed in the waters north
of  the  equator  in  the  western  Pacific  Ocean. These  storms, called  typhoons, do
enormous damage to coastal areas and islands in Southeast Asia (see Figure 6.17).
Other areas of the world such as Bangladesh experience tropical cyclones on
a regular basis. Bangladesh borders the Indian Ocean and is particularly vulnera-
ble because it is a highly populated and low-lying country, much of it only 3 me-
ters (10 feet) above sea level. In 1970, a 12-meter (40-foot)-high storm surge from
a tropical cyclone killed an estimated 1 million people. Another tropical cyclone

hit  the  area  in  1972  that  caused  up  to
500,000  deaths. In  1991, Hurricane
Gorky s  winds  of  233  kilometers  (145
miles  per  hour)  and  large  storm  surge
caused  extensive  damage  and  killed
200,000 people.
Even islands near the centers of ocean
basins  can  be  struck  by  hurricanes. The
Hawaiian  Islands, for  example, were  hit  hard  by
Hurricane Dot in August 1959 and by Hurricane Iwa
in  November  1982. Hurricane  Iwa  hit  very  late  in  the
hurricane season and produced winds up to 130 kilometers
(81  miles)  per  hour. Damage  of  more  than  $100  million
occurred on the islands of Kauai and Oahu. Niihau, a small island
that is inhabited by 230 native Hawaiians, was directly in the path of the storm
and suffered  severe  property  damage  but no  serious  injuries. Hurricane  Iniki
roared across the islands of Kauai and Niihau in September 1992, with 210-kilo-
meter  (130-mile)-per-hour  winds. It  was  the  most  powerful  hurricane  to  hit  the
Hawaiian  Islands  in  the  last  100  years, with  property  damage
that approached $1 billion.

Hurricanes will continue to be a threat to life and property.
Because  of  more  accurate  forecasts  and  prompt  evacuation,
however, the loss of life has been decreasing. Property damage,
on  the  other  hand, has  been  increasing  because  increasing
coastal  populations  have  resulted  in  more  and  more  construc-
tion along the coast. Inhabitants of areas subject to a hurricane s
destructive force must be made aware of the danger so that they
can be prepared for its eventuality.

The Ocean s Climate
Patterns
Just  as  land  areas  have  climate  pat-
terns, so do regions of the oceans. The
open  ocean  is  divided  into  climatic
regions  that  run  generally  east west
(parallel to lines of latitude) and have
relatively  stable  boundaries  that  are
somewhat  modified  by  ocean  surface
currents (Figure 6.22).

The  equatorial region  spans  the
equator, which  gets  an  abundance  of
solar radiation. As a result, the major

air  movement  is  upward  because  heated  air  rises. Surface  winds, therefore, are
weak and variable, which is why this region is called the doldrums. Surface waters
are warm and the air is saturated with water vapor. Daily rain showers are com-
mon, which keeps surface salinity relatively low. The equatorial regions just north
or south of the equator are also the breeding grounds for tropical cyclones.

Tropical regions  extend  north  or  south  of  the  equatorial  region  up  to  the
Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, respectively. They are characterized
by  strong  trade  winds, which  blow  from  the  northeast  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere  and  from  the  southeast  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere. These  winds
push  the  equatorial  currents  and  create  moderately  rough  seas. Relatively
little precipitation falls at higher latitudes within tropical regions, but precipita-
tion increases toward the equator. Once tropical cyclones form, they gain energy
here as large quantities of heat are transferred from the ocean to the atmosphere.
Beyond the tropics are the subtropical regions. Belts of high pressure are cen-
tered there, so the dry, descending air produces little precipitation and a high rate
of evaporation, resulting in the highest surface salinities in the open ocean (see
Figure 5.23). Winds are weak and currents are sluggish, typical of the horse lati-
tudes. However, strong  boundary  currents  (along  the  boundaries  of  continents)
flow  north  and  south, particularly  along  the  western  margins  of  the  subtropical
oceans.

The  temperate regions (also called  the  middle  latitudes or  midlatitudes)  are
characterized by strong westerly winds (the prevailing westerlies) blowing from
the  southwest  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  and  from  the  northwest  in  the
Southern  Hemisphere  (see  Figure  6.11). Severe  storms  are  common, especially
during  winter, and  precipitation  is  heavy. In  fact, the  North  Atlantic  is  noted
for fierce  storms, which  have  claimed  many  ships  and  numerous  lives  over  the
centuries.

The subpolar region experiences extensive precipitation due to the subpolar
low. Sea ice covers the subpolar ocean in winter, but it melts away, for the most
part, in summer. Icebergs are common, and the surface temperature seldom ex-
ceeds 

in the summer months.

5°C (41°F)

Surface temperatures remain at or near freezing in the polar regions, which
are covered with ice throughout most of the year. The polar high pressure domi-
nates  the  area, which  includes  the  Arctic  Ocean  and  the  ocean  adjacent  to
Antarctica. There  is  no  sunlight  during  the  winter  and  constant  daylight  during
the summer.

Hurricane Ike, which made landfall in Gilchrist, Texas, was
the third most destructive hurricane to ever make landfall 
in the United States.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Hurricanes are intense and sometimes destructive
tropical storms that form where water temperatures
are high, where there is an abundance of warm moist
air, and where they can spin.

6.7 How Do Sea Ice and Icebergs Form?
Low temperatures in high-latitude regions cause a permanent or nearly perma-
nent  ice  cover  on  the  sea  surface. The  term  sea  ice is  used  to  distinguish  such
masses of frozen seawater from icebergs, which are also found at sea but originate
by  breaking  off  (calving)  from  glaciers  that  originate  on  land. Sea  ice  is  found
throughout  the year  around  the  margin  of Antarctica, within  the Arctic  Ocean,
and in the extreme high-latitude region of the North Atlantic Ocean.

Formation of Sea Ice
Sea ice is ice that forms directly from seawater (Figure 6.23). It begins as small,
needle-like, hexagonal (six-sided) crystals, which eventually become so numerous
that a slush develops. As the slush begins to form into a thin sheet, it is broken
by wind  stress  and  wave  action  into  disk-shaped  pieces  called  pancake  ice
(Figure 6.23a). As further freezing occurs, the pancakes coalesce to form ice floes
(flo * layer).

The  rate  at  which  sea  ice  forms  is  closely  tied  to  temperature  conditions.
Large quantities of ice form in relatively short periods when the temperature falls

to  extremely  low  levels  [such  as  temperatures  below  *30 C  (*22 F)]. Even  at
these  low  temperatures, the  rate  of  ice  formation  slows  as  sea  ice  thickens
because the ice (which has poor heat conduction) effectively insulates the under-
lying  water  from  freezing. In  addition, calm  water  enables  pancake  ice  to  join
together more easily, which aids the formation of sea ice.

The process of sea ice formation tends to be a self-perpetuating process. As
sea ice forms at the surface, only a small percentage of the dissolved components
can be accommodated into the crystalline structure of ice. As a result, most of the
dissolved substances remain in the surrounding seawater, which causes its salinity
to increase. Recall from Chapter 5 that increasing the amount of dissolved materials

decreases the freezing point of water, which doesn t appear to enhance ice forma-
tion. However, also recall that increasing the salinity of water increases its density
and  its  tendency  to  sink. As  it  sinks  below  the  surface, it  is  replaced  by  lower-
salinity (and lower-density) water from below, which will freeze more readily than
the high salinity water it replaced, thereby establishing a circulation pattern that
enhances the formation of sea ice.

Recent satellite analyses of the extent of Arctic Ocean sea ice shows that it
has decreased dramatically in the past few decades. This accelerated melting ap-
pears to be linked to shifts in Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation pat-
terns that have caused the region to experience anomalous warming. For more on
this topic, see Chapter 16, The Oceans and Climate Change.

Formation of Icebergs
Icebergs are bodies of floating ice broken away from a glacier (Figure 6.24a) and
so are quite distinct from sea ice. Icebergs are formed by vast ice sheets on land,
which grow from the accumulation of snow and slowly flow outward to the sea.
Once at the sea, the ice either breaks up and produces icebergs there, or, because
it is less dense than water, it floats on top of the water, often extending a great dis-
tance away from shore before breaking up under the stress of current, wind, and
wave action. Most calving occurs during the summer months when temperatures
are highest.

In the Arctic, icebergs originate primarily by calving from glaciers that extend
to  the  ocean  along the  western  coast  of  Greenland  (Figure  6.24b). Icebergs are
also  produced  by  glaciers  along  the  eastern  coasts  of  Greenland, Ellesmere
Island, and other Arctic islands. In all, about 10,000 or so icebergs are calved off
these  glaciers  each  year. Many  of  these  icebergs  are  carried  by  the  East
Greenland Current and the West Greenland Current (Figure 6.24b, arrows) into
North Atlantic shipping lanes, where they become navigational hazards. In recog-
nition of this fact, the area is called Iceberg Alley; it is here that the luxury liner
RMS  Titanic hit an iceberg and sank (see Web Box 6.1). Because of their large
size, some of these icebergs take several years to melt, and, in that time, they may
be carried as far south as 40 degrees north latitude, which is the same latitude as
Philadelphia.

SHELF  ICE In Antarctica, where glaciers cover nearly the entire continent, the
edges of glaciers form thick floating sheets of ice called  shelf  ice that break off
and produce vast plate-like icebergs (Figures 6.24c and 6.24d). In March 2000, for
example, a  Connecticut-sized  iceberg  (11,000  square  kilometers  or  4250  square
miles) known as B-15 and nicknamed  Godzilla broke loose from the Ross Ice
Shelf  into  the  Ross  Sea. By  comparison, the  largest  iceberg  ever  recorded  in
Antarctic  waters  was  nearly  three  times  the  size  of  B-15  and  measured  an
incredible  335  by  97  kilometers  (208  by  60  miles)
about  the  same  size  as
Connecticut and Massachusetts combined.

The icebergs have flat tops that may stand as much as 200 meters (650 feet)
above the ocean surface, although most rise less than 100 meters (330 feet) above
sea  level, and  as  much  as  90%  of  their  mass  is  below  waterline. Once  icebergs
are created, ocean  currents  driven  by  strong  winds  carry  the  icebergs  north,
where they eventually melt. Because this region is not a major shipping route, the
icebergs pose little serious navigation hazard except for supply ships traveling to
Antarctica. Officers  aboard  ships  sighting  these  gigantic  bergs  have, in  some
cases, mistaken them for land!

The rate at which Antarctica is producing icebergs especially large icebergs

has  recently  increased, most  likely  as  a  result  of  Antarctic  warming. For  more
information  about Antarctic  warming  and  its  relationship  to  climate  change, see
Chapter 16, The Oceans and Climate Change.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Sea ice is created when seawater freezes; 
icebergs form when chunks of ice break off 
from coastal glaciers that reach the sea.

6.8 Can Power from Wind Be
Harnessed as a Source of
Energy?

The  uneven  heating  of  Earth  by  the  Sun  drives  various
small- and large-scale winds. These winds, in turn, can be
harnessed  to  turn  windmills  or  turbines  that  generate
electricity. At  various  places  on  land  where  the  wind
blows constantly, wind farms have been constructed that
consist  of  hundreds  of  large  turbines  mounted  on  tall
towers, thereby  taking  advantage  of  this  renewable,
clean energy source. Similar facilities could be built off-
shore, where the wind generally blows harder and more
steadily  than  on  land. Figure  6.25 shows  the  offshore
areas where the potential for wind farms exist.

June - August

Some offshore wind farms have already been built and
many  more  are  in  the  planning  stage. In  the  North  Sea
north of windswept northern Europe, for example, about 100
sea-based turbines are already operating (Figure 6.26), with
hundreds more planned. In fact, Denmark generates 18%
of its power by wind more than any other country and
hopes to increase its proportion of wind power to 50% by
2030. In  the  United  States, America s  first  offshore  wind
farm, Cape  Wind, is  scheduled  to  be  built  on  Horseshoe
Shoal  in  Nantucket  Sound, Massachusetts, 8  kilometers
(5 miles) south of Cape Cod. The wind farm expects to be
fully functional in 2011 with 130 wind turbines capable of
producing  420  megawatts  of  power, which  is  capable  of
supplying  the  energy  needs  of  nearly  350,000  average 
U.S. homes.

Air Sea Interaction

Chapter in Review

The atmosphere and the ocean act as one interdependent system, linked
by complex feedback loops. There is a close association between most at-
mospheric and oceanic phenomena.

(ITCZ). The boundary between the trade winds and the prevailing wester-
lies  is  called  the  horse  latitudes. The  boundary  between  the  prevailing
westerlies and the polar easterlies is called the polar front.

The  Sun  heats  Earth s  surface  unevenly  due  to  the  change  of  seasons
(caused by the tilt of Earth s rotational axis, which is 23.5 degrees from verti-
cal) and the daily cycle of sunlight and darkness (Earth s rotation on its axis).
The uneven distribution of solar energy on Earth influences most of the phys-
ical properties of the atmosphere (such as temperature, density, water vapor
content, and pressure differences) that produce atmospheric movement.

The Coriolis effect influences the paths of moving objects on Earth and is
caused by Earth s rotation. Because Earth s surface rotates at different ve-
locities at different latitudes, objects in motion tend to veer to the right in
the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The
Coriolis  effect  is  nonexistent  at  the  equator  but  increases  with  latitude,
reaching a maximum at the poles.

More solar energy is received than is radiated back into space at low lati-
tudes than at high latitudes. On the spinning Earth, this creates three circu-
lation cells in each hemisphere: a Hadley cell between 0 and 30 degrees lat-
itude, a  Ferrel  cell between  30  and  60  degrees  latitude, and  a  polar  cell
between  60  and  90  degrees  latitude. High-pressure  regions, where  dense
air descends, are located at about 30 degrees north or south latitude and at
the poles. Belts of low pressure, where air rises, are generally found at the
equator and at about 60 degrees latitude.

The  movement  of  air  within  the  circulation  cells  produces  the  major  wind
belts of the world. The air at Earth s surface that is moving away from the sub-
tropical highs produces trade winds moving toward the equator and prevailing
westerlies moving toward higher latitudes. The air moving along Earth s sur-
face from the polar high to the subpolar low creates the polar easterlies.

The tilt of Earth s axis of rotation, the lower heat capacity of rock material
compared to seawater, and the  distribution of  continents modify the wind
and pressure belts of the idealized three-cell model. However, the three-cell
model closely matches the pattern of the major wind belts of the world.

Weather describes the conditions of the atmosphere at a given place and
time, while climate is the long-term average of weather. Atmospheric motion
(wind) is always from high-pressure regions toward low-pressure regions. In
the  Northern  Hemisphere, therefore, there  is  a  counterclockwise  cyclonic
movement of  air  around  low-pressure  cells  and  a  clockwise  anticyclonic
movement around  high-pressure  cells. Coastal  regions  commonly  experi-
ence sea and land breezes, due to the daily cycle of heating and cooling.

Many  storms  are  due  to  the  movement  of  air  masses. In  the  middle  lati-
tudes, cold  air  masses  from  higher  latitudes  meet  warm  air  masses  from
lower latitudes and create cold and warm fronts that move from west to east
across  Earth s  surface. Tropical  cyclones  (hurricanes)  are  large, powerful
storms that mostly affect tropical regions of the world. Destruction caused by
hurricanes is caused by storm surge, high winds, and intense rainfall.

The ocean s climate patterns are closely related to the distribution of solar
energy and the wind belts of the world. Ocean surface currents somewhat
modify oceanic climate patterns.

In high latitudes, low temperatures freeze seawater and produce sea ice,
which forms as a slush and breaks into pancakes that ultimately grow into
ice floes. Icebergs form when chunks of ice break off glaciers that form on
Antarctica, Greenland, and  some  Arctic  islands. Floating  sheets  of  ice
called shelf ice near Antarctica produce the largest icebergs.

Calm winds characterize the boundaries between the major wind belts of
the  world. The  boundary  between  the  two  trade  wind  belts  is  called  the
doldrums, which  coincides  with  the  Intertropical  Convergence  Zone

Winds can be harnessed as a source of power. There is vast potential for
developing this clean, renewable resource and several offshore wind farm
systems currently exist.

OCEAN CIRCULATION

Ocean currents are masses of ocean water that flow from one place to another. The amount of water
can be large or small, currents can be at the surface or deep below, and the phenomena that create
them can be simple or quite complex. Simply put, currents are water masses in motion.

Huge current systems dominate the surfaces of the major oceans. These currents transfer heat
from warmer to cooler areas on Earth, just as the major wind belts of the world do. Wind belts trans-
fer about two-thirds of the total amount of heat from the tropics to the poles; ocean surface currents
transfer the other third. Ultimately, energy from the Sun drives surface currents and they closely fol-
low the pattern of the world s major wind belts. As a result, the movement of currents has aided the
travel of prehistoric people across ocean basins. Ocean currents also influence the abundance of life
in surface waters by affecting the growth of microscopic algae, which are the basis of most oceanic
food webs.

More  locally, surface  currents  affect  the  climates  of  coastal  continental  regions. Cold  currents
flowing toward the equator on the western sides of continents produce arid conditions. Conversely,
warm currents flowing poleward on the eastern sides of continents produce warm, humid conditions.
Ocean  currents, for  example, contribute  to  the  mild  climate  of  northern  Europe  and  Iceland,
whereas conditions at similar latitudes along the Atlantic coast of North America (such as Labrador)
are much colder. Additionally, water sinks in high-latitude regions, initiating deep currents that help
regulate the planet s climate.

7.1 How Are Ocean Currents Measured?
Ocean currents are either wind driven or density driven. Moving air masses particularly the major
wind belts of the world set wind-driven currents in motion. Wind-driven currents move water hori-
zontally and occur primarily in the ocean s surface waters, so these currents are called surface cur-
rents. Density-driven  circulation, on  the  other  hand, moves  water  vertically  and  accounts  for  the
thorough mixing of the deep masses of ocean water. Some surface waters become high in density
through  low  temperature  and/or  high  salinity
sinks and spreads slowly beneath the surface, so these currents are called deep currents.

and  so  sink  beneath  the  surface. This  dense  water

Surface Current Measurement
Surface currents rarely flow in the same direction and at the same rate for very long, so measuring
average flow rates can be difficult. Some consistency, however, exists in the overall surface current
pattern worldwide. Surface currents can be measured directly or indirectly.

September 1993. Red colors are areas that have higher
than normal sea level; blue colors are areas that are
lower than normal. White arrows indicate the flow di-
rection of currents, with longer arrows indicating
faster flow rates.

DIRECT  METHODS Two  main  methods  are  used  to
measure  currents  directly. In  one, a  floating  device  is
released  into  the  current  and  tracked  through  time.
Typically, radio-transmitting  float  bottles  or  other  devices
are used (Figure 7.1a), but other accidentally released items
also make good drift meters (Box 7.1). The other method is
done from a fixed position (such as a pier) where a current-
measuring device, such as the propeller flow meter shown in
Figure 7.1b, is lowered into the water. Propeller devices can
also  be  towed  behind  ships, and  the  ship s  speed  is  then
subtracted to determine a current s true flow rate.

INDIRECT  METHODS Three  different  methods  can  be
used to measure surface currents  indirectly. Water flows
parallel  to  a  pressure  gradient, so  one  method  is  to
determine  the  internal  distribution  of  density  and  the
corresponding  pressure  gradient  across  an  area  of  the
ocean. A  second  method  uses  radar  altimeters
such
as those  launched  aboard  Earth-observing  satellites
today
to determine the lumps and bulges at the ocean
surface, which are a result of the shape of the underlying
sea  floor  (see  Box  7.1)  as  well  as  current  flow. From
these data, dynamic  topography maps  can  be  produced
that show  the  speed  and  direction  of  surface  currents
(Figure 7.2). A third method uses a Doppler flow meter to
transmit low-frequency sound signals through the water.
The flow meter measures the shift in frequency between
the  sound  waves  emitted  and  those  backscattered  by
particles in the water to determine current movement.

(b)

Deep Current Measurement
The great depth at which deep currents exist makes them even more difficult to
measure  than  surface  currents. Most  often, they  are  mapped  using  underwater
floats  that  are  carried  within  deep  currents. One  such  unique  oceanographic

RUNNING SHOES AS DRIFT METERS: JUST DO IT

Any  floating  object  can  serve  as  a
makeshift  drift  meter, as  long  as  it  is
known  where  the  object  entered  the
ocean  and  where  it  was  retrieved. The
path  of  the  object  can  then  be  inferred,
providing  information  about  the  move-
ment of surface currents. If the time of re-
lease  and  retrieval  are  known, the  speed
of  currents  can  also  be  determined.
Oceanographers have long used drift bot-
tles (a floating  message in a bottle or a
radio-transmitting device set adrift in the
ocean) to track the movement of currents.
Many  objects  have  inadvertently  be-
come  drift  meters  when  ships  lose  cargo

at  sea. Worldwide, in  fact, as  many  as
10,000  shipping  containers  are  lost  over-
board each year. In this way, Nike athletic
shoes  and  colorful  floating  bathtub  toys
(Figure 7A, right inset) have advanced the
understanding  of  current  movement  in
the North Pacific Ocean.

In  May  1990, the  container  vessel
Hansa Carrier was en route from Korea to
Seattle, Washington, when  it  encountered
a  severe  North  Pacific  storm. The ship
was transporting 12.2-meter (40-foot)-long 
rectangular  metal  shipping  containers,
many  of  which  were  lashed  to  the  ship s
deck for the voyage. During the storm, the

ship lost 21 deck containers overboard, in-
cluding five that held Nike athletic shoes.
The  shoes  floated, so  those  that  were  re-
leased  from  their  containers  were  carried
east  by  the  North  Pacific  Current. Within
six  months, thousands  of  the  shoes  began
to  wash  up  along  the  beaches  of Alaska,
Canada, Washington, and  Oregon  (Figure
7A, map), more  than  2400  kilometers
(1500  miles)  from  the  site  of  the  spill. A
few shoes were found on beaches in north-
ern  California, and  over  two  years  later,
shoes  from  the  spill  were  even  recovered
from  the  north  end  of  the  Big  Island  of
Hawaii!

Continued from page 195 . . .

Even though the shoes had spent con-
siderable  time  drifting  in  the  ocean, they
were  in  good  shape  and  wearable  (after
barnacles  and  oil  were  removed). Because
the  shoes  were  not  tied  together, many
beachcombers  found  individual  shoes  or
pairs that did not match. Many of the shoes
retailed  for  around  $100, so  people  inter-
ested in finding matching pairs placed ads in
newspapers or attended local swap meets.

With  help  from  the  beachcombing
public  (as  well  as  lighthouse  operators),
information  on  the  location  and  number
of  shoes  collected  was  compiled  during
the  months  following  the  spill. Serial
numbers  inside  the  shoes  were  traced  to
individual  containers, and  they  indicated
that  only  four  of  the  five  containers  had
released their shoes; evidently, one entire
container  sank  without  opening. Thus, a
maximum of 30,910 pairs of shoes (61,820

individual  shoes)  were  released. The  al-
most instantaneous release of such a large
number  of  drift  items  helped  oceanogra-
phers  refine  computer  models  of  North
Pacific  circulation. Before  the  shoe  spill,
the  largest  number  of  drift  bottles  pur-
posefully released at one time by oceanog-
raphers  was  about  30,000. Although  only
2.6%  of  the  shoes  were  recovered, this
compares favorably with the 2.4% recov-
ery  rate  of  drift  bottles  released  by
oceanographers conducting research.

In  January  1992, another  cargo  ship
lost  12  containers  during  a  storm  to  the
north  of  where  the  shoes  had  previously
spilled. One  of  these  containers  held
29,000 packages of small, floatable, color-
ful  plastic  bathtub  toys  in  the  shapes  of
blue  turtles, yellow  ducks, red  beavers,
and green frogs (Figure 7A, insets). Even
though  the  toys  were  housed  in  plastic
packaging  glued  to  a  cardboard  backing,

studies showed that after 24 hours in sea-
water, the  glue  deteriorated  and  more
than 100,000 of the toys were released.

The  floating  bathtub  toys  began  to
come ashore in southeast Alaska 10 months
later, verifying  the  computer  models. The
models  indicate  that  many  of the  bathtub
toys  will  continue  to  be  carried  by  the
Alaska  Current,
eventually  dispersing
throughout the North Pacific Ocean. Some
may  find  their  way  into  the Arctic  Ocean,
where  they  could  spend  time  within  the
Arctic Ocean ice pack. From there, the toys
may drift into the North Atlantic, eventually
washing up on beaches in northern Europe,
thousands  of  kilometers  from  where  they
were accidentally released into the ocean.

such  as  Curtis

program that began in 2000 is called Argo, which is a global array of free-drifting
profiling floats (Figure 7.3b) that move vertically and measure the temperature,
salinity, and  other  water  characteristics of the upper  2000 meters (6600 feet) of
the ocean. Once deployed, each float sinks to a particular depth, drifts for up to 10
days collecting data, then resurfaces and transmits data on its location and ocean
variables, which are made publically available within hours. Each float then sinks
back down to a programmed depth and drifts for up to another 10 days collecting
more data before resurfacing and repeating the cycle. In 2007, the goal of the pro-
gram was achieved with the launch of the 3000th Argo float; currently, there are
nearly  3300  floats  operating  worldwide  (Figure  7.3a). The  program  will  allow

oceanographers  to  develop  a  forecasting  system  for  the  oceans  analogous  to
weather forecasting on land.

Other  techniques  used  for  measuring  deep  currents  include  identifying  the
distinctive  temperature  and  salinity  characteristics  of  a  deep-water  mass  or  by
tracking telltale chemical tracers. Some tracers are naturally absorbed into seawater,
while others are intentionally added. Some useful tracers that have inadvertently
been added to seawater include tritium (a radioactive isotope of hydrogen pro-
duced by nuclear bomb tests in the 1950s and early 1960s) and chlorofluorocar-
bons (freons and other gases now thought to be depleting the ozone layer).

7.2 How Are Ocean Surface Currents

Organized?

Surface currents occur within and above the pycnocline (layer of rapidly changing
density) to a depth of about 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) and affect only about 10% of
the world s ocean water.

Origin of Surface Currents
In a simplistic case, surface currents develop from friction between the ocean and
the  wind  that  blows  across  its  surface. Only  about  2%  of  the  wind s  energy  is
transferred to the ocean surface, so a 50-knot1 wind will create a 1-knot cur-
rent. You can simulate this on a tiny scale simply by blowing gently and
steadily across a cup of coffee.

NORTH

AMERICA

If there were no continents on Earth, the surface currents would

generally follow the major wind belts of the world. In each hemi-
sphere, therefore, a current would flow between 0 and 30 degrees
latitude as a result of the trade winds, a second would flow be-
tween 30 and 60 degrees latitude as a result of the prevailing
westerlies, and a third would flow between 60 and 90 degrees
latitude as a result of the polar easterlies.

In  reality, however, ocean  surface  currents  are  driven
by more than just the wind belts of the world. The distribu-
tion of continents on Earth is one factor that influences the
nature and the direction of flow of surface currents in each
ocean  basin. As  an  example, Figure  7.4 shows  how  the
trade winds and prevailing westerlies create large circular-
moving loops of water in the Atlantic Ocean basin, which is
bounded  by  the  irregular  shape  of  continents. These  same
wind belts affect the other ocean basins, so a similar pattern
of  surface  current  flow  also  exists  in  the  Pacific  and  Indian
Oceans. Other  factors  that  influence  surface  current  patterns
include gravity, friction, and the Coriolis effect.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Wind-induced surface currents are measured 
with floating objects, by satellites, or by other 
techniques. Density-induced deep currents 
are measured using submerged floats, 
water properties, or chemical tracers.

gyres (gyros = a circle). Figure 7.5 shows the world s five subtropical gyres: (1) the
North  Atlantic  Subtropical  Gyre, (2)  the  South  Atlantic  Subtropical  Gyre,
(3) the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, (4) the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre, and
(5) the  Indian  Ocean  Subtropical  Gyre (which  is  mostly  within  the  Southern
Hemisphere). The reason they are called subtropical gyres is because the center of
each  gyre  coincides  with  the  subtropics  at  30  degrees  north  or  south  latitude. As
shown  in  Figures  7.4 and  7.5, subtropical  gyres  rotate  clockwise  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Studies of floating
objects (see Box 7.1) indicate that the average drift time in a smaller subtropical gyre
such as the North Atlantic Gyre is about three years, whereas in larger subtropical
gyres such as the North Pacific Gyre it is about six years.

Oceanographers  have  given  names  to  the  gyres  to  honor  explorers  and
seafarers both human and nonhuman, but especially drifters who have circled
and traversed their great expanses:

The  North Atlantic  Subtropical  Gyre is named  the  Columbus  Gyre after  the
first mariner to exploit its currents in both outbound and homeward journeys
(see Box 6.1).
The  South  Atlantic  Subtropical  Gyre  is  named  the  Navigator  Gyre after
Portugal s  Prince  Henry  the  Navigator, who  founded  Europe s  first  naviga-
tional school and launched oceanography s Age of Discovery (see Chapter 1).
The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre is named the Turtle Gyre in honor of sea
turtles that cross the widest ocean leaving and returning to their ancient breed-
ing beaches in Japan (see Box 2.1).
The South Pacific Subtropical Gyre is named the  Heyerdahl  Gyre after Thor
Heyerdahl, a  fearless  explorer scientist  that  proved  an  ancient  voyage  from
South America to Polynesia was possible by reenacting it (see Chapter 1).
The Indian Ocean s gyre is named the Majid Gyre after the great 15th-century
Arab mariner and author Ahmad Bin Majid, whose maps guided the Portuguese
in their globe-spanning voyages.

aDenotes an eastern boundary current of a gyre, which is relatively slow, wide, and shallow (and is also a cold-water current).
bDenotes a western boundary current of a gyre, which is relatively fast, narrow, and deep (and is also a warm-water current).

Generally, each subtropical gyre is composed of four main currents that flow
progressively into one another (Table 7.1). The North Atlantic (Columbus) Gyre,
for instance, is composed of the North Equatorial Current, the Gulf Stream, the
North Atlantic Current, and the Canary Current (Figure 7.5). Let s examine each
of the four main currents that comprise subtropical gyres.

Equatorial  Currents The  trade  winds, which  blow  from  the  southeast  in  the
Southern Hemisphere and from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere, set in
motion  the  water  masses  between  the  tropics. The  resulting  currents  are  called
equatorial  currents, which  travel  westward  along  the  equator  and  form  the
equatorial  boundary  current  of  subtropical  gyres  (Figure  7.5). They  are  called
north  or  south  equatorial  currents, depending  on  their  position  relative  to  the
equator.

Western Boundary Currents When equatorial currents reach the western portion
of  an  ocean  basin, they  must  turn  because  they  cannot  cross  land. The  Coriolis
effect deflects these currents away from the equator as western boundary currents,
which  comprise  the  western  boundaries  of  subtropical  gyres. Western  boundary
currents  are  so  named  because  they  travel  along  the  western  boundary  of  their
respective  ocean  basins.2 For  example, the  Gulf  Stream  and  the  Brazil  Current,

2Notice that western boundary currents are off the eastern coasts of adjoining continents. It s easy to be
confused about this because we have a land-based perspective. From an oceanic perspective, however,
the western side of the ocean basin is where western boundary currents reside.

Chapter 7

Ocean Circulation

K E Y   C O N C E P T
The principal ocean surface current pattern consists
of subtropical and subpolar gyres that are large, 
circular-moving loops of water powered by the 
major wind belts of the world.

which  are  shown  in  Figure  7.5, are  western  boundary  currents. They  come  from
equatorial regions, where water temperatures are warm, so they carry warm water
to higher latitudes. Note that Figure 7.5 shows warm currents as red arrows.

Northern  or  Southern  Boundary  Currents Between 30 and 60 degrees latitude,
the  prevailing  westerlies  blow  from  the  northwest  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere
and from  the  southwest  in  the  Northern Hemisphere. These  winds direct ocean
surface  water  in  an  easterly  direction  across  an  ocean  basin  [see  the  North
Atlantic  Current  and  the Antarctic  Circumpolar  Current  (West Wind  Drift)  in
Figure  7.5]. In  the  Northern  Hemisphere, these  currents  comprise  the  northern
parts  of  subtropical  gyres  and  are  called  northern  boundary  currents; in  the
Southern Hemisphere, they comprise the southern parts of subtropical gyres and
are called southern boundary currents.

Eastern Boundary Currents When currents flow back across the ocean basin, the
Coriolis  effect  and  continental  barriers  turn  them  toward  the  equator, creating
eastern boundary currents of subtropical gyres along the eastern boundary of the
ocean basins. Examples of eastern boundary currents include the Canary Current
and the Benguela Current,3 which are shown in Figure 7.5. They come from high-
latitude  regions  where  water  temperatures  are  cool, so  they  carry  cool  water  to
lower latitudes. Note that Figure 7.5 shows cold currents as blue arrows.

EQUATORIAL COUNTERCURRENTS A large volume of water is driven westward
due to the north and south equatorial currents. The Coriolis effect is minimal near
the  equator, so  the  majority  of  the  water  is  not  turned  toward  higher  latitudes.
Instead, the  water  piles  up  along  the  western  margin  of  an  ocean  basin, which
causes average sea level on the western side of the basin to be as much as 2 meters
(6.6 feet) higher than on the eastern side. The water on the western margins then
flows  downhill  under  the  influence  of  gravity, creating  narrow  equatorial
countercurrents that  flow  to  the  east  counter  to  and  between  the  adjoining
equatorial currents.

Figure 7.5 shows that an equatorial countercurrent is particularly apparent in
the Pacific Ocean. This is because of the large equatorial region that exists in the
Pacific Ocean and because of a dome of equatorial water that becomes trapped in
the  island-filled  embayment  between  Australia  and  Asia. Continual  influx  of
water from equatorial currents builds the dome and creates an eastward counter-
current  that  stretches  across  the  Pacific  toward  South America. The  equatorial
countercurrent  in  the Atlantic  Ocean, on  the  other  hand, is  not  nearly  as  well
defined because of the shapes of the adjoining continents, which limit the equato-
rial area that exists in the Atlantic Ocean. The presence of an equatorial counter-
current in the Indian Ocean is strongly influenced by the monsoons, which will be
discussed later in this chapter.

SUBPOLAR GYRES Northern or southern boundary currents that flow eastward
as  a  result  of  the  prevailing  westerlies  eventually  move  into  subpolar  latitudes
(about  60  degrees  north  or  south  latitude). Here, they  are  driven  in  a  westerly
direction  by  the  polar  easterlies, producing  subpolar  gyres that  rotate  opposite
the  adjacent  subtropical  gyres. Subpolar  gyres  are  smaller  and  fewer  than
subtropical  gyres. Two  examples  include  the  subpolar  gyre  in  the  Atlantic
Ocean between Greenland and Europe (named the Viking Gyre in honor of the
Viking voyages during the Middle Ages) and in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica
(Figure 7.5).

3Currents are often named for a prominent geographic location near where they pass. For instance,
the Canary Current passes the Canary Islands, and the Benguela Current is named for the Benguela
Province in Angola, Africa.

Other Factors Affecting Ocean 
Surface Circulation
Several other factors influence circulation patterns in subtropical
gyres, including Ekman spiral and Ekman transport, geostrophic
currents, and western intensification of subtropical gyres.

EKMAN  SPIRAL  AND  EKMAN  TRANSPORT During  the
voyage  of  the  Fram (Web  Box  7.1), Norwegian  explorer
Fridtjof Nansen observed that Arctic Ocean ice moved 20 to 40
degrees  to  the  right  of  the  wind  blowing  across  its  surface
(Figure  7.6). Not  only  ice  but  surface  waters  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere  were  also  observed  to  move  to  the  right  of  the
wind  direction; in  the  Southern  Hemisphere, surface  waters
move to the left of the wind direction. Why does surface water
move in a direction different than the wind? V. Walfrid Ekman
(1874 1954), a Swedish physicist, developed a circulation model in 1905 called the
Ekman  spiral (Figure  7.7)  that  explains  Nansen s  observations  as  a  balance
between frictional effects in the ocean and the Coriolis effect.

100 meters

The Ekman spiral describes the speed and direction of flow of surface waters at
various  depths. Ekman s  model  assumes  that  a  uniform  column  of  water  is  set  in
motion  by  wind  blowing  across  its  surface. Because  of  the  Coriolis  effect, the
immediate surface water moves in a direction 45 degrees to the right of the wind (in
the  Northern  Hemisphere). The  surface  water  moves  as  a  thin 
layer on  top  of
deeper layers of water. As the surface layer moves, other layers beneath it are set in
motion, thus passing the energy of the wind down through the water column just like
how a deck of cards can be fanned out by pressing on and rotating only the top card.
Current  speed  decreases  with  increasing  depth, however, and  the  Coriolis
effect increases curvature to the right (like a spiral). Thus, each successive layer
of water  is  set  in  motion  at  a  progressively  slower  velocity, and  in  a  direction
progressively to the right of the one above it. At some depth, a layer of water may
move in a direction exactly opposite from the wind direction that initiated it! If the
water is deep enough, friction will consume the energy imparted by the wind and
no motion will occur below that depth. Although it depends on wind speed and
latitude, this stillness normally occurs at a depth of about 100 meters (330 feet).

What does an Ekman spiral look like at the surface?
Is it strong enough to disturb ships?

The  Ekman  spiral  creates  different  layers  of  surface
water  that  move  in  slightly  different  directions  at
slightly  different  speeds.  It  is  too  weak  to  create 
eddies or whirlpools (vortexes) at the surface and so
presents no danger to ships. In fact, the Ekman spiral
is  unnoticeable  at  the  surface.  It  can  be  observed,
however,  by  lowering  oceanographic  equipment  over
the side of a vessel. At various depths, the equipment
can  be  observed  to  drift  at  various  angles  from  the
wind direction according to the Ekman spiral.

Figure 7.7 shows the spiral nature of this movement with increasing depth from
the ocean s surface. The length of each arrow in Figure 7.7 is proportional to the
velocity of the individual layer, and the direction of each arrow indicates the direc-
tion it moves.4 Under ideal conditions, therefore, the surface layer should move at
an angle of 45 degrees from the direction of the wind. All the layers combine, how-
ever, to create a net water movement that is 90 degrees from the direction of the
wind. This average movement, called Ekman transport, is 90 degrees to the right in
the Northern Hemisphere and 90 degrees to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.

Ideal conditions rarely exist in the ocean, so the actual movement of sur-
face currents deviates slightly from the angles shown in Figure 7.7. Generally, sur-
face currents move at an angle somewhat less than 45 degrees from the direction
of the wind and Ekman transport in the open ocean is typically about 70 degrees
from the wind direction. In shallow coastal waters, Ekman transport may be very
nearly the same direction as the wind.

GEOSTROPHIC CURRENTS Ekman transport deflects surface water to the right
in  the  Northern  Hemisphere, so  a  clockwise  rotation  develops  within  an  ocean
basin  and  produces  a  Subtropical  Convergence of  water  in  the  middle  of  the
gyre, causing water literally to pile up in the center of the subtropical gyre. Thus,
there  is  a  hill  of  water  within  all  subtropical  gyres  that  is  as  much  as  2  meters
(6.6 feet) high.

Surface water in a Subtropical Convergence tends to flow downhill in response
to gravity. The Coriolis effect opposes gravity, however, deflecting the water to the
right in a curved path (Figure 7.8a) into the hill again. When these two factors bal-
ance, the net effect is a  geostrophic  (geo * earth, strophio * turn) current that
moves in a circular path around the hill and is shown in Figure 7.8a as the path of
ideal  geostrophic  flow.5 Friction  between  water  molecules, however, causes  the
water to move gradually down the slope of the hill as it flows around it. This is the
path of actual geostrophic flow labeled in Figure 7.8a.

If  you  reexamine  the  satellite  image  of  sea  surface  elevation  in  Figure  7.2,
you ll see that the hills of water within the subtropical gyres of the Atlantic Ocean
are clearly visible. The hill in the North Pacific is visible as well, but the elevation
of the equatorial Pacific is not as low as expected because the map shows condi-
tions during a moderate El Niño event,6 so there is a well-developed warm and
anomalously high equatorial countercurrent. Figure 7.2 also shows very little dis-
tinction between the North and South Pacific gyres. Moreover, the South Pacific
(Heyerdahl)  Gyre  hill  is  less  pronounced than  in  other gyres, mostly because  it
covers  such  a  large  area; it  lacks  confinement  by  continental  barriers  along  its
western margin; and because of interference by numerous islands (really the tops
of tall sea floor mountains). The South Indian Ocean hill is rather well developed
in the figure, although its northeastern boundary stands high because of the influx
of warm Pacific Ocean water through the East Indies islands.

WESTERN INTENSIFICATION OF SUBTROPICAL GYRES Figure 7.8a shows that
the apex (top) of the hill formed within a rotating gyre is closer to the western
boundary than the center of the gyre. As a result, the western boundary currents
of  the  subtropical  gyres  are  faster, narrower, and  deeper  than  their  eastern
boundary  current  counterparts. For  example, the  Kuroshio  Current  (a  western
boundary current) of the North Pacific (Turtle) Gyre is up to 15 times faster, 20
times  narrower, and  five  times  as  deep  as  the  California  Current  (an  eastern
boundary  current). This  phenomenon  is  called  western  intensification, and

4The name Ekman spiral refers to the spiral observed by connecting the tips of the arrows shown in
Figure 7.7.
5The term geostrophic for these currents is appropriate, since the currents behave as they do because
of Earth s rotation.
6El Niño events are discussed later in this chapter, under  Pacific Ocean Circulation.

rium around the hill.

currents affected by this phenomenon are said to be western intensified. Note that
the  western  boundary  currents  of  all subtropical  gyres  are  western  intensified,
even in the Southern Hemisphere.

A number of factors cause western intensification, including the Coriolis effect.
The Coriolis effect increases toward the poles, so eastward-flowing high-latitude water
turns toward the equator more strongly than westward-flowing equatorial water turns
toward higher latitudes. This causes a wide, slow, and shallow flow of water toward
the  equator  across  most  of  each  subtropical  gyre, leaving  only  a  narrow  band
through which the poleward flow can occur along the western margin of the ocean
basin. If a constant volume of water rotates around the apex of the hill in Figure
7.8b, then the velocity of the water along the western margin will be much greater
than  the  velocity  around  the  eastern  side.7 In  Figure  7.8b, the  lines  are  close

7A good analogy for this phenomenon is a funnel: In the narrow end of a funnel, the flow rates are
speeded up (such as in western intensified currents) in the wide end, the flow rates are sluggish (such
as in eastern boundary currents).

together  along  the  western  margin, indicating  the  faster  flow. The  end  result  is  a
high-speed western boundary current that flows along the hill s steeper westward
slope and a slow drift of water toward the equator along the more gradual eastern
slope. Table 7.2 summarizes the differences between western and eastern boundary
currents of subtropical gyres.

Ocean Currents and Climate
Ocean surface currents directly influence the climate of adjoining landmasses. For
instance, warm  ocean  currents  warm  the  nearby  air. This  warm  air  can  hold  a
large  amount  of  water  vapor, which  puts  more  moisture  (high  humidity)  in  the
atmosphere. When  this  warm, moist  air  travels  over  a  continent, it  releases  its
water  vapor  in  the  form  of  precipitation. Continental  margins  that  have  warm
ocean currents offshore (Figure 7.9, red arrows) typically have a humid climate.
The  presence  of  a  warm  current  off  the  East  Coast  of  the  United  States  helps
explain why the area experiences such high humidity, especially in the summer.

Conversely, cold  ocean  currents  cool  the  nearby  air, which  is  more  likely  to
have low water vapor content. When the cool, dry air travels over a continent, it
results in very little precipitation. Continental margins that have cool ocean currents
offshore (Figure 7.9, blue arrows) typically have a dry climate. The presence of a cold
current off California is part of the reason why the climate is so arid there.

7.3 What Causes Upwelling 

and Downwelling?

Upwelling is  the  vertical  movement  of  cold, deep, nutrient-rich  water  to  the
surface; downwelling is the vertical movement of surface water to deeper parts of
the ocean. Upwelling hoists chilled water to the surface. This cold water, rich in

nutrients, creates  high  productivity (an  abundance  of  microscopic  algae), which
establishes the base of the food web and, in turn, supports incredible numbers of
larger marine life like fish and whales. Downwelling, on the other hand, is associ-
ated  with  much  lower  amounts  of  surface  productivity  but  carries  necessary
dissolved oxygen to those organisms living on the deep-sea floor.

Upwelling and downwelling provide important mixing mechanisms between

surface and deep waters and are accomplished by a variety of methods.

Diverging Surface Water
Current divergence occurs when surface waters move away from an
area on the ocean s surface, such as along the equator. As shown in
Figure 7.10, the South Equatorial Current occupies the area along the
geographical  equator (most  notably  in  the  Pacific  Ocean; see  Fig-
ure 7.5), while the meteorological equator (where the doldrums exist)
typically occurs a few degrees of latitude to the north. As the southeast
trade  winds  blow  across  this  region, Ekman  transport  causes  surface
water north of the equator to veer to the right (northward) and water
south of the equator to veer to the left (southward). The net result is a
divergence of surface currents along the geographical equator, which
causes  upwelling  of  cold, nutrient-rich  water. Because  this  type  of
upwelling is common along the equator especially in the Pacific
it is
called  equatorial  upwelling, and  it  creates  areas  of  high  productivity
that are some of the most prolific fishing grounds in the world.

winds pass over the geographical equator to the meteorologi-
cal equator, they cause water within the South Equatorial
Current north of the equator to veer to the right (northward)
and water south of the equator to veer to the left (south-
ward). Thus, surface water diverges, which causes equatorial
upwelling.

Downwelling

FIGURE 7.11 Downwelling caused by convergence of
surface currents. Where surface currents converge, water
piles up and slowly sinks downward, creating downwelling.

Converging Surface Water
Current convergence occurs when surface waters move toward each other. In the
North Atlantic Ocean, for instance, the Gulf Stream, the Labrador Current, and the
East Greenland Current all come together in the same vicinity. When currents con-
verge, water  stacks  up  and  has  no  place  to  go  but  downward. The  surface  water
slowly sinks in a process called downwelling (Figure 7.11). Unlike upwelling, areas
of downwelling are not associated with prolific marine life because the necessary
nutrients are not continuously replenished from the cold, deep, nutrient-rich water
below the surface. Consequently, downwelling areas have low productivity.

Coastal Upwelling and Downwelling
Coastal  winds  can  cause  upwelling  or  downwelling  due  to  Ekman  transport.
Figure 7.12 shows  a  coastal  region  along  the  west  coast  of  a  continent  in  the
Northern  Hemisphere  with  winds  moving  parallel  to  the  coast. If  the  winds  are
from  the  north  (Figure  7.12a), Ekman  transport  moves  the  coastal  water  to  the
right  of  the  wind  direction, causing  the  water  to  flow  away  from the  shoreline.
Water rises from below to replace the water moving away from shore in a process
called  coastal  upwelling. Areas where coastal upwelling occurs, such as the West
Coast of the United States, are characterized by high concentrations of nutrients,
resulting in high biological productivity and rich marine life. This coastal upwelling
also  creates  low  water  temperatures  in  areas  such  as  San  Francisco, providing  a
natural form of air conditioning (and much cool weather and fog) in the summer.
If the winds are from the south, Figure 7.12b shows that Ekman transport still
moves  the  coastal  water  to  the  right  of  the  wind  direction  but, in  this  case, the
water flows toward the shoreline. The water stacks up along the shoreline and has
nowhere  to  go  but  down, in  a  process  called  coastal  downwelling. Areas  where
coastal downwelling occurs have low productivity and a lack of marine life. If the
winds  reverse, areas  that  are  typically  associated  with  coastal  downwelling  can
experience upwelling.

A similar situation exists for coastal winds and upwelling/downwelling in the
Southern  Hemisphere, except  that  Ekman  transport  is  to  the  left of  the  wind
direction.

Other Causes of Upwelling
Figure  7.13 shows  how  upwelling  can  be  created  by  offshore  winds, sea  floor
obstructions, or a sharp bend in a coastline. Upwelling also occurs in high-latitude
regions, where  there  is no  pycnocline  (a  layer of  rapidly  changing  density). The

sal of the wind direction still causes Ekman transport to the right but results in water pil-

Upwelling and downwelling cause vertical mixing

cold, deep, nutrient-rich water to the surface, which
results in high productivity.

absence of a pycnocline allows significant vertical mix-
ing between high-density cold surface water and high-
density  cold  deep  water  below. Thus, both  upwelling
and downwelling are common in high latitudes.

7.4 What Are the Main
Surface Circulation
Patterns in Each
Ocean?

The pattern of surface currents varies from ocean to
ocean  depending  upon  the  geometry  of  the  ocean
basin, the  pattern  of  major  wind  belts, seasonal  fac-
tors, and other periodic changes.

Antarctic Circulation
Antarctic circulation is dominated by the movement of
water  masses  in  the  southern  Atlantic, Indian, and
Pacific Oceans south of about 50 degrees south latitude.

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the only cur-
rent that completely circumscribes Earth and is allowed
to do so because of the lack of land at high southern lat-
itudes. It  meets  its  greatest  restriction  as  it  passes
through  the  Drake  Passage [named  for  the  famed
English  sea  captain  and  ocean  explorer  Sir  Francis
Drake (1540 1596)] between  the Antarctic  Peninsula
and  the  southern  islands  of  South America, which  is
about 1000 kilometers (600 miles) wide. Although the
current is not speedy [its maximum surface velocity is
about  2.75  kilometers  (1.65  miles)  per  hour], it  trans-
ports more water (an average of about 130 million cubic
meters per second8) than any other surface current.

ANTARCTIC  CONVERGENCE  AND  DIVERGENCE The
Antarctic Convergence (Figure 7.14) or Antarctic Polar Front is
where  colder, denser, Antarctic  waters  converge  with  (and  sink
sharply below) warmer, less dense sub-Antarctic waters at about 50
degrees  south latitude. The  Antarctic  Convergence  marks  the

northernmost boundary of the Southern or Antarctic Ocean.
The  East  Wind  Drift, a  surface  current  propelled  by  the  polar  easterlies,
moves from an easterly direction around the margin of the Antarctic continent. The
East Wind Drift is most extensively developed to the east of the Antarctic Peninsula
in the Weddell Sea region and in the area of the Ross Sea (Figure 7.14). As the East
Wind Drift and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current flow around Antarctica in oppo-
site directions, they create a surface divergence. Recall that the Coriolis effect de-
flects moving masses to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, so the East Wind Drift
is  deflected  toward  the  continent  and  the  Antarctic  Circumpolar  Current  is  de-
flected away from it. This creates a divergence of currents along a boundary called
the Antarctic Divergence. The Antarctic Divergence has abundant marine life in the
Southern Hemisphere summer because of the mixing of these two currents, which
supplies nutrient-rich water to the surface through upwelling.

Atlantic Ocean Circulation
Figure 7.15 shows Atlantic Ocean surface circulation, which consists of two large
subtropical  gyres: the  North Atlantic  (Columbus)  Gyre  and  the  South Atlantic
(Navigator) Gyre.

the  North Atlantic. The  rest  is  turned  southward  as

THE  GULF  STREAM The  Gulf  Stream is  the  best
studied of all ocean currents. It moves northward along the East Coast of
the United States, warming coastal states and moderating winters in these
and northern European regions.

Figure 7.16 shows the network of currents in the North Atlantic Ocean
that  contribute  to  the  flow  of  the  Gulf  Stream. The  North  Equatorial
Current moves parallel to the equator in the Northern Hemisphere, where
it  is  joined  by  the  portion  of  the  South  Equatorial  Current  that  turns
northward along the South American coast. This flow then splits into the
Antilles Current, which passes along the Atlantic side of the West Indies,
and  the  Caribbean  Current, which  passes  through  the  Yucatán  Channel
into the Gulf of Mexico. These masses reconverge as the Florida Current.

The Florida Current flows close to shore over the continental shelf at a rate
that  at  times  exceeds  35  Sverdrups. As  it  moves  off  North  Carolina s  Cape
Hatteras and flows across the deep ocean in a northeasterly direction, it is called
the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream is a western boundary current, so it is subject to
western intensification. Thus, it is only 50 to 75 kilometers (31 to 47 miles) wide,
but it reaches depths of 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) and speeds from 3 to 10 kilome-
ters (2 to 6 miles) per hour, making it the fastest current in the world ocean.

The  western  boundary  of  the  Gulf  Stream  is  usually  abrupt, but  it  periodi-
cally migrates closer to and farther away from the shore. Its eastern boundary is
very difficult to identify because it is usually masked by meandering water masses
that change their position continuously.

The Sargasso Sea The Gulf Stream gradually merges eastward with the water of
the  Sargasso  Sea. The  Sargasso  Sea  is  the  water  that  circulates  around  the
rotation center of the North Atlantic gyre. The Sargasso Sea can be thought of as
the  stagnant  eddy  of  the  North Atlantic  (Columbus)  Gyre. Its  name  is  derived

BENJAMIN FRANKLIN: THE WORLD S MOST FAMOUS PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHER

Benjamin Franklin (Figure 7B, inset) is well
known as a scientist, inventor, economist,
statesman, diplomat, writer, poet, interna-
tional  celebrity, and  one  of  the  founding
fathers of the United States. He even held
the position of deputy postmaster general
of  the  colonies  from  1753  to  1774.
Remarkably, he  also  became  known  as
one  of  the  first  physical  oceanographers
because he contributed greatly to the un-
derstanding  of  the  Gulf  Stream, a  North
Atlantic  Ocean  surface  current. Why
would a postmaster general be interested
in an ocean current?

Franklin  became  interested  in  North
Atlantic  Ocean  circulation  patterns  be-
cause he needed to explain why mail ships
coming from Europe to New England took
about two weeks less time when they took
a longer, more southerly route than when
they took a more direct, northerly route. In
about  1769  or  1770, Franklin  mentioned
this dilemma to his cousin, a Nantucket sea
captain named Timothy Folger. Folger told
Franklin  that  a  strong  current  with  which
the mail ships were unfamiliar was imped-
ing their journey because it flowed against
them. The whaling ships were familiar with
the  current  because  they  often  hunted
whales  along  its  boundaries. The  whalers
often met the mail ships within the current
and  told  their  crews  they  would  make
swifter  progress  if  they  avoided  the  cur-
rent. The British captains of the mail ships,
however, would  not  accept  advice  from
simple American fishers, so they continued
to make slow progress within the current.
If the winds were light, their ships were ac-
tually carried backward!

including  directions 

Folger sketched the current on a map
for  Franklin,
for
avoiding  it  by  taking  a  more  southerly
route  when  sailing  from  Europe  to North
America. Franklin  then  asked  other  ship
captains  for  information  concerning  the
movement  of  surface  waters  in  the  North
Atlantic  Ocean. Franklin  inferred  that
there  was  a  significant  current  moving
northward  along  the  eastern  coast  of  the
United  States, which  then  headed  east
across  the  North  Atlantic. He  concluded
that this current was responsible for aiding
the progress of ships traveling through the
North  Atlantic  to  Europe  and  slowing
ships traveling in the reverse direction. He
subsequently measured the temperature of
the  current  himself  and  first  published  a

map of the current in 1777 based on these
observations and distributed it to the cap-
tains  of  the  mail  ships  (who  initially  ig-
nored it). This strong current is named the
Gulf Stream because it carries warm water
from the Gulf of Mexico and because it is
narrow  and  well  defined similar  to  a
stream, but in the ocean.

In 1969, six scientists studied the Gulf
Stream  aboard  a  submersible  vessel  that
was allowed to float for a month underwa-
ter wherever the current took her. During
the  vessel s  2640-kilometer  (1650-mile)
journey, the scientists observed and meas-
ured  the  properties  of  and  cataloged  life
forms  within  the  Gulf  Stream. Appropri-
ately  enough, the  vessel  was  named  the
Ben Franklin.

from a type of floating marine alga called Sargassum (sargassum * grapes) that
abounds on its surface.

The  transport  rate  of  the  Gulf  Stream  off  Chesapeake  Bay  is  about  100
Sverdrups,9 which  suggests  that  a  large  volume  of  water  from  the  Sargasso  Sea
has combined with the Florida Current to produce the Gulf Stream. By the time

9The Gulf Stream s flow of 100 Sverdrups equates to a volume of about 100 major league sport 
stadiums passing by the southeast U.S. coast each second and is more than 100 times greater than the 
combined flow of all the world s rivers!

Atlantic Current, the Canary Current, and the North Equatorial Current. Some water
splits off in the North Atlantic, where it becomes cold and dense, so it sinks. The Sargasso
Sea occupies the stagnant eddy in the middle of the subtropical gyre.

the  Gulf  Stream  nears  Newfoundland, however, the  transport  rate  is  only
40 Sverdrups, which suggests that a large volume of water has returned to the dif-
fuse flow of the Sargasso Sea.

Warm- and Cold-Core Rings The mechanisms that produce the dramatic loss
of  water  as  the  Gulf  Stream  moves  northward  are  yet  to  be  determined.
Meanders, however, may  cause  much  of  it. Meanders (Menderes * a  river  in
Turkey  that  has  a  very  sinuous  course)  are  snakelike  bends  in  the  current  that
often disconnect from the Gulf Stream and form large rotating masses of water
called vortexes (vortexes = to turn), which are more commonly known as eddies or
rings. Figure  7.17 shows  several  of  these  rings, which  are  noticeable  near  the
center  of  each  image. The  figure  also  shows  that  meanders  along  the  north
boundary  of  the  Gulf  Stream  pinch  off  and  trap  warm  Sargasso  Sea  water  in
eddies  that  rotate  clockwise, creating  warm-core  rings (yellow)  surrounded  by
cooler  (blue  and  green)  water. These  warm  rings  contain  shallow, bowl-shaped
masses of warm water about 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) deep, with diameters of about

Is the Gulf Stream rich in life?

The  Gulf  Stream  itself isn t  rich  in  life,  but  its
boundaries often  are.  The  oceanic  areas  that  have
abundant marine life are typically associated with cool
water either in high-latitude regions, or in any region
where  upwelling  occurs.  These  areas  are  constantly
resupplied with oxygen- and nutrient-rich water, which
results  in  high  productivity.  Warm-water  areas  de-
velop  a  prominent  thermocline  that  isolates  the  sur-
face  water  from  colder,  nutrient-rich  water  below.
Nutrients used up in warm waters tend not to be re-
supplied. The Gulf Stream, which is a western intensi-
fied, warm-water current, is therefore associated with
low  productivity  and  an  absence  of  marine  life.  New
England fishers knew about the Gulf Stream (Box 7.2)
because they sought their catch along the sides of the
current, where mixing and upwelling occur.

Actually, all western intensified currents are warm
and  are  associated  with  low  productivities.  The
Kuroshio Current in the North Pacific Ocean, for exam-
ple,  is  named  for  its  conspicuous  absence  of  marine
life.  In  Japanese, Kuroshio means  black  current,   in
reference to its clear, lifeless waters.

100  kilometers  (60  miles). Warm-core  rings  remove  large  volumes  of  water  as
they disconnect from the Gulf Stream.

Cold nearshore water spins off to the south of the Gulf Stream as counter-
clockwise-rotating  cold-core  rings (green)  surrounded  by  warmer  (yellow and
red-orange)  water  (Figure  7.17). The  cold  rings  consist  of  spinning  cone-shaped
masses of cold water that extend over 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) deep. These rings
may exceed 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter at the surface. The diameter of
the cone increases with depth and sometimes reaches all the way to the sea floor,
where cones have a tremendous impact on sea floor sediment. Cold rings move
southwest  at  speeds  of  3  to  7  kilometers  (2  to  4  miles)  per  day  toward  Cape
Hatteras, where they often rejoin the Gulf Stream.

Both warm- and cold-core rings maintain not only unique temperature char-
acteristics, but  also  unique  biological  populations. Studies  of  rings  have  found
they  are  isolated  habitats  for  either  warm-water  organisms  in  a  cold  ocean  or,
conversely, cold-water organisms in a warmer ocean. The organisms can survive
as long as the ring does; in some cases, rings have been documented to last as long
as two years. In addition, cold-core rings are typically associated with high nutri-
ent  levels  and  an  abundance  of  marine  life  while  warm-core  rings  are  zones  of
downwelling that lack nutrients and are deficient in marine life.

OTHER  NORTH  ATLANTIC  CURRENTS Southeast  of  Newfoundland, the  Gulf
Stream continues in an easterly direction across the North Atlantic (Figure 7.16).
Here  the  Gulf  Stream  breaks  into  numerous  branches, many  of  which  become
cold and dense enough to sink beneath the surface. As shown in Figure 7.15, one
major  branch  combines  the  cold  water  of  the  Labrador  Current with  the  warm
Gulf  Stream, producing  abundant  fog  in  the  North  Atlantic. This  branch
eventually  breaks  into  the  Irminger  Current, which  flows  along  Iceland s  west
coast, and the Norwegian Current, which moves northward along Norway s coast.
The other major branch crosses the North Atlantic as the North Atlantic Current
(also called the North Atlantic Drift, emphasizing its sluggish nature), which turns
southward to become the cool Canary Current. The Canary Current is a broad,
diffuse southward flow that eventually joins the North Equatorial Current, thus
completing the gyre.

CLIMATIC  EFFECTS  OF NORTH ATLANTIC CURRENTS The warming effects of
the  Gulf  Stream  are  far  ranging. The  Gulf  Stream  not  only  moderates
temperatures  along  the  East  Coast  of  the  United  States  but  also  in  northern
Europe  (in  conjunction  with  heat  transferred  by  the  atmosphere). Thus, the
temperatures across the Atlantic at different latitudes are much higher in Europe
than  in  North  America  because  of  the  effects  of  heat  transfer  from  the  Gulf
Stream  to  Europe. For  example, Spain  and  Portugal  have  warm  climates, even
though they are at the same latitude as the New England states, which are known
for severe winters. The warming that northern Europe experiences because of the
Gulf Stream is as much as 9°C (20°F), which is enough to keep high-latitude Baltic
ports ice free throughout the year.

The  warming  effects  of  western  boundary  currents  in  the  North  Atlantic
Ocean  can  be  seen  on  the  average  sea  surface  temperature  map  for  February
shown  in  Figure  7.9b. Off  the  east  coast  of  North  America  from  latitudes 
20  degrees  north  (the  latitude  of  Cuba)  to  40  degrees  north  (the  latitude
of Philadelphia), for  example, there  is  a  20°C  (36°F)  difference  in  sea  surface
temperatures. On the eastern side of the North Atlantic, on the other hand, there
is only a 5°C (9°F) difference in temperature between the same latitudes, indicating
the moderating effect of the Gulf Stream.

The  average  sea  surface  temperature  map  for  August  (see  Figure  7.9a)  also
shows  how  the  North  Atlantic  and  Norwegian  Currents  (branches  of  the  Gulf
Stream)  warm  northwestern  Europe  compared  with  the  same  latitudes  along  the

Indian Ocean
Circulation

Because of the shape and posi-
tion of India, the Indian Ocean
exists  mostly  in  the  Southern
Hemisphere. From  November
to March, equatorial circulation
in  the  Indian  Ocean  is  similar
to  that  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean,
with 
two  westward-flowing
equatorial  currents  (North  and  South  Equatorial  Currents)  sepa-
rated by an eastward-flowing Equatorial Countercurrent. As com-
pared  to  circulation  in  the  Atlantic, however, the  Equatorial
Countercurrent in the Indian Ocean lies in a more southerly posi-
tion  because  most  of  the  Indian  Ocean  lies  in  the  Southern
Hemisphere. The shape of the Indian Ocean basin and its proximity
to the high mountains of Asia cause it to experience strong seasonal
changes.

Cape

MONSOONS The  winds  of  the  northern  Indian  Ocean  have  a
seasonal pattern called  monsoon (mausim = season) winds. During
winter, air  over  the  Asian  mainland  rapidly  cools, creating  high
atmospheric pressure, which causes the wind to blow from southwest
Asia off the continent and out over the ocean (Figure 7.18a, green arrows). These
northeast trade winds are called the northeast monsoon. During this season, there
is little precipitation because the air associated with the high pressure over land is
so dry.

During  summer, the  winds  reverse. Because  of  the  lower  heat  capacity  of
rocks  and  soil compared  with  water, the Asian  mainland  warms  faster  than  the
adjacent ocean, creating low atmospheric pressure over the continent. As a result,
the winds blow strongly from the Indian Ocean onto the Asian landmass (Figure
7.18b, green arrows), giving rise to the southwest monsoon, which may be thought
of as a continuation of the southeast trade winds across the equator. During this
season, there is heavy precipitation on land because the air brought in from the
Indian Ocean is warm and full of moisture.

Not  only  does  this  seasonal  cycle  affect  weather  patterns  on  land, it  also
affects  surface  current  circulation  in  the  Indian  Ocean. In  fact, the  northern
Indian  Ocean  is  the  only  place  in  the  world  where  reversing  seasonal  winds

actually cause major ocean surface currents to switch direction. During the win-
tertime  northwest  monsoon  (Figure  7.18a), offshore  winds  cause  the  North
Equatorial  Current  to  flow  from  east  to  west  and  its  extension, the  Somali
Current, flows  south along  the  coast  of Africa. An  Equatorial  Countercurrent is
also established. During the summertime southwest monsoon (Figure 7.18b), the
winds  reverse, causing  the  North  Equatorial  Current  to  be  replaced  by  the
Southwest  Monsoon  Current, which  flows  in  the  opposite  direction. The  winds
cause the Somali Current to reverse as well, which flows rapidly northward with
velocities approaching 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) per hour and feeds the Southwest
Monsoon Current. By October, the northeast trade winds are reestablished and
the North Equatorial Current reappears (Figure 7.18a).

The  movement  of  winds  during  the  summertime  southwest  monsoon  also
affects sea surface temperatures, which cool near the Arabian Peninsula because of
upwelling  as  water  is  drawn  away  from  shore. This  cool  water  also  supports  large
populations of phytoplankton during the summer southwest monsoon (Figure 7.19).
Studies  of  productivity  in  the  Indian  Ocean  show  that  upwelling  has  increased  in
recent  years  due  to  stronger  winds  caused  by  warming  of  the  Eurasian  landmass,
resulting in higher than normal summer productivity in the Arabian Sea.

INDIAN OCEAN SUBTROPICAL GYRE Surface circulation in the southern Indian
Ocean (the Indian Ocean Subtropical Gyre, or Majid Gyre) is similar to subtropical
gyres observed in other southern oceans. When the northeast trade winds blow, the
South  Equatorial  Current  provides  water  for  the  Equatorial  Countercurrent  and
the Agulhas Current,10 which flows southward along Africa s east coast and joins
the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (West Wind Drift). The Agulhas Retroflection is

created when the Agulhas Current makes an abrupt turn
as it meets the strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current (see
the  chapter-opening  satellite  image). Turning  northward
out  of  the  Antarctic  Circumpolar  Current  is  the  West
Australian  Current, an  eastern  boundary  current  that
merges  with  the  South  Equatorial  Current, completing
the gyre.

LEEUWIN  CURRENT Eastern  boundary  currents  in
other  subtropical  gyres  are  cold  drifts  toward  the
equator that produce arid coastal climates [that is, they
receive less than 25 centimeters (10 inches) of rain per
year]. In  the  southern  Indian  Ocean, however, the
Leeuwin Current displaces the West Australian Current
offshore. The  Leeuwin  Current  is  driven  southward
along  the Australian  coast  from  the  warm-water  dome
piled  up  in  the  East  Indies  by  the  Pacific  equatorial
currents.

The  Leeuwin  Current  produces  a  mild  climate  in
southwestern  Australia, which  receives  about  125  cen-
timeters  (50  inches)  of  rain  per  year. During  El  Niño
events, however, the  Leeuwin  Current  weakens, so  the
cold Western Australian Current brings drought instead.

Pacific Ocean Circulation
Two large subtropical gyres dominate the circulation pattern in the Pacific Ocean,
resulting in surface water movement and climatic effects similar to those found in
the Atlantic. However, the Equatorial Countercurrent is much better developed
in the Pacific Ocean than in the Atlantic (Figure 7.20), largely because the Pacific
Ocean basin is larger and more unobstructed than the Atlantic Ocean.

NORMAL CONDITIONS Normal conditions in the Pacific Ocean are a bit of a
misnomer  because  they  are  experienced  so  infrequently. As  we ll  see, various
atmospheric  and  oceanic  disturbances  dominate  conditions  in  the  Pacific. Still,
normal conditions provide a baseline from which to measure these disturbances.

Subtropical  Gyre (Turtle  Gyre)  includes  the  North  Equatorial  Current, which
flows  westward  into  the  western  intensified  Kuroshio  Current11 near Asia. The
warm waters of the Kuroshio Current make Japan s climate warmer than would
be expected for its latitude. This current flows into the North Pacific Current, which
connects  to  the  cool-water  California  Current. The  California  Current  flows  south
along the coast of California to complete the loop. Some North Pacific Current water
also flows to the north and merges into the Alaskan Current in the Gulf of Alaska.

South  Pacific  Subtropical  Gyre Figure  7.20 also  shows how  the  South  Pacific
Subtropical Gyre (Heyerdahl Gyre) includes the South Equatorial Current, which
flows  westward  into  the  western  intensified  East  Australian  Current.12 From
there,
it  joins  the  Antarctic  Circumpolar  Current  (West  Wind  Drift)  and

11Kuroshio is pronounced  kuhr-ROH-shee-oh. Because of its proximity to Japan, the Kuroshio
Current is also called the Japan Current.
12Note that the western intensified East Australian Current was named because it lies off the east coast
of Australia, even though it occupies a position along the western margin of the Pacific Ocean basin.

FISHERIES  AND  THE  PERU  CURRENT The  cool  waters  of  the
Peru  Current  have  historically  been  one  of  Earth s  richest
fishing grounds. What conditions produce such an abundance
of  fish?  Figure  7.21a shows  that  along  the  west  coast  of
South  America, coastal  winds  create  Ekman  transport
that moves water away from shore, causing upwelling of
cool, nutrient-rich  water. This  upwelling 
increases
productivity and results in an abundance of marine life,
including  small  silver-colored  fish  called  anchovetas
(anchovies)  that  become  particularly  plentiful  near
Peru  and  Ecuador. Anchovies provide  a  food  source
for  many  larger  marine  organisms  and  also  supply
Peru s  commercial 
industry, which  was
established  in  the  1950s. Anchovies  had  been  so
abundant in the waters off South America that by 1970
Peru  was  the  largest  producer  of  fish  from  the  sea  in
the world, with a peak production of 12.3 million metric
tons (13.5 million short tons), accounting for about one-
quarter of all fish from the sea worldwide.

WALKER  CIRCULATION Figure  7.21a shows  that  high
pressure and sinking air dominate the coastal region of South
America, resulting  in  clear, fair, and  dry  weather. On  the  other
side of the Pacific, a low-pressure region and rising air create cloudy
conditions  with  plentiful  precipitation  in  Indonesia, New  Guinea, and
northern  Australia. This  pressure  difference  causes  the  strong  southeast
trade  winds  to  blow  across  the  equatorial  South  Pacific. The  resulting
atmospheric circulation cell in the equatorial South Pacific Ocean is named
the  Walker  Circulation  Cell (green  arrows)  after  Sir  Gilbert  T. Walker
(1868 1958), the  British  meteorologist  who  first  described  the  effect  in
the 1920s.

PACIFIC  WARM  POOL The  southeast  trade  winds  set  ocean  water  in
motion, which  also  moves  across  the  Pacific  toward  the  west. The  water
warms as it flows in the equatorial region and creates a wedge of warm water on
the  western  side  of  the  Pacific  Ocean, called  the  Pacific  warm  pool (see  Fig-
ure 7.9). Due  to  the  movement  of  equatorial  currents  to  the  west, the  Pacific
warm pool is thicker along the western side of the Pacific than along the eastern
side. The  thermocline beneath  the  warm  pool  in  the  western  equatorial  Pacific
occurs  below  100  meters  (330  feet)  depth. In  the  eastern  Pacific, however, the
thermocline is within 30 meters (100 feet) of the surface. The difference in depth
of  the  thermocline  can  be  seen  by  the  sloping  boundary  between  the  warm
surface water and the cold deep water in Figure 7.21a.

EL  NIÑO SOUTHERN  OSCILLATION  (ENSO)  CONDITIONS Historically, Peru s
residents  knew  that  every  few  years, a  current  of  warm  water  reduced  the
population  of  anchovies  in  coastal  waters. The  decrease  in  anchovies  caused  a
dramatic decline not only in the fishing industry, but also in marine life such as sea
birds  and  seals  that  depended  on  anchovies  for  food. The  warm  current  also
brought  about  changes  in  the  weather usually  intense  rainfall
and  even
brought such interesting items as floating coconuts from tropical islands near the

equator. At first, these events were called años de abundancia (years of abundance)
because  the  additional  rainfall  dramatically  increased  plant  growth  on  the
normally arid land. What was once thought of as a joyous event, however, soon
became associated with the ecological and economic disaster that is now a well-
known consequence of the phenomenon.

This  warm-water  current  usually  occurred  around  Christmas  and  thus  was
given the name El Niño, Spanish for  the child,
in reference to baby Jesus. In the
1920s, Walker was the first to recognize that an east west atmospheric pressure
seesaw  accompanied  the  warm  current  and  he  called  the  phenomenon  the
Southern  Oscillation. Today, the  combined  oceanic  and  atmospheric  effects  are

The amount of anchovies produced by Peru is im-
pressive! Besides a topping for pizza, what are
some other uses of anchovies?

Anchovies  are  an  ingredient  in  certain  dishes,  hors
d oeuvres, sauces, and salad dressing, and they are
also  used  as  bait  by  fishers.  Historically,  however,
most  of  the  anchoveta caught  in  Peruvian  waters
were  exported  and  used  as  fishmeal  (consisting  of
ground  anchovies).  The  fishmeal,  in  turn,  was  used
largely in pet food and as a high-protein chicken feed.
As unbelievable as it may seem, El Niños affected the
price  of  eggs!  Prior  to  the  collapse  of  the  Peruvian
anchoveta fishing  industry  in  1972 1973,  El  Niño
events  significantly  reduced 
the  availability  of
anchovetas.  This  drastically  cut  the  export  of  an-
chovies  from  Peru,  causing  U.S.  farmers  to  pursue
more  expensive  options  for  chicken  feed.  Thus,  egg
prices typically increased.

The collapse of the anchoveta fishing industry in
Peru was triggered by the 1972 1973 El Niño event
but was caused by chronic overfishing in prior years
(see  Web  Box  13.2).  Interestingly,  the  shortage  of
fishmeal  after  1972 1973  led  to  an  increased  de-
mand for soyameal, an alternative source of high-qual-
ity protein. Increased demand for soyameal increased
the  price  of  soy  commodities,  thereby  encouraging
U.S.  farmers  to  plant  soybeans  instead  of  wheat.
Reduced production of wheat, in turn, caused a major
global food crisis all triggered by an El Niño event.

called  El  Niño Southern  Oscillation  (ENSO), which  periodically  alter-
nate between warm and cold phases and cause dramatic environmental
changes.

ENSO Warm Phase (El Niño) Figure 7.21b shows the atmospheric and
oceanic  conditions  during  an  ENSO  warm  phase, which  is  known  as
El Niño. The  high  pressure  along  the  coast  of  South America  weakens,
reducing  the  difference  between  the  high-  and  low-pressure  regions  of
the  Walker  Circulation  Cell. This, in  turn, causes  the  southeast  trade
winds to diminish. In very strong El Niño events, the trade winds actually
blow in the reverse direction.

Without the trade winds, the Pacific Warm Pool that has built up on
the western side of the Pacific begins to flow back across the ocean to-
ward South America. Aided by an increase in the flow of the Equatorial
Countercurrent, the Pacific Warm Pool creates a band of warm water that
stretches  across  the  equatorial  Pacific  Ocean  (Figure  7.22a). The  warm
water  usually  begins  to  move  in  September  of  an  El  Niño  year  and
reaches South America by December or January. During strong to very
strong El Niños, the water temperature off Peru can be up to 10°C (18°F)
higher  than  normal. In  addition, the  average  sea  level  can  increase  as
much  as  20  centimeters  (8  inches), simply  due  to  thermal  expansion  of
the warm water along the coast.

As  the  warm  water  increases  sea  surface  temperatures  across  the
equatorial  Pacific, temperature-sensitive  corals  are  decimated  in Tahiti,
the Galápagos, and other tropical Pacific islands. In addition, many other
organisms are affected by the warm water (see Web Box 13.2). Once the
warm water reaches South America, it moves north and south along the
west coast of the Americas, increasing average sea level and the number
of tropical hurricanes formed in the eastern Pacific.

The flow of warm water across the Pacific also causes the sloped ther-
mocline  boundary  between  warm  surface  waters  and  the  cooler  waters
below to flatten out and become more horizontal (Figure 7.21b). Near Peru,
upwelling brings warmer, nutrient-depleted water to the surface instead of
cold, nutrient-rich water. In fact, downwelling can sometimes occur as the
warm water stacks up along coastal South America. Productivity diminishes
and most types of marine life in the area are dramatically reduced.

As the warm water moves to the east across the Pacific, the low-pres-
sure zone also migrates. In a strong to very strong El Niño event, the low
pressure  can  move  across  the  entire  Pacific  and  remain  over  South
America. The  low  pressure  substantially  increases  precipitation  along
the
coastal  South  America. Conversely, high  pressure  replaces 
Indonesian  low, bringing  dry  conditions  or, in  strong  to  very  strong  El  Niño
events, drought conditions to Indonesia and northern Australia.

In some instances, conditions opposite of El Niño
ENSO Cool Phase (La Niña)
prevail  in  the  equatorial  South  Pacific; these  events  are  known  as  ENSO  cool
phase or  La  Niña (Spanish for  the female child ). Figure 7.21c shows La Niña
conditions, which are similar to normal conditions but more intensified because
there is a larger pressure difference across the Pacific Ocean. This larger pressure
difference creates stronger Walker Circulation and stronger trade winds, which in
turn cause more upwelling, a shallower thermocline in the eastern Pacific, and a
band  of  cooler  than  normal  water  that  stretches  across  the  equatorial  South
Pacific (Figure 7.22b).

La Niña conditions commonly occur following an El Niño. For instance, the
1997 1998 El Niño was followed by several years of persistent La Niña conditions.
The alternating pattern of El Niño La Niña conditions since 1950 is shown by the
multivariate ENSO index (Figure 7.23), which is calculated using a weighted aver-
age  of  atmospheric  and  oceanic  factors  including  atmospheric  pressure, winds,

Do El Niño events occur in other ocean basins?

Yes,  the  Atlantic  and  Indian  Oceans  both  experience
events  similar  to  the  Pacific s  El  Niño.  These  events
are not nearly as strong, however, nor do they influ-
ence  worldwide  weather  phenomena  to  the  same 
extent  as  those  that  occur  in  the  equatorial  Pacific
Ocean. The great width of the Pacific Ocean in equa-
torial latitudes is the main reason that El Niño events
occur more strongly in the Pacific.

In the Atlantic Ocean, this phenomenon is related
to  the  North  Atlantic  Oscillation  (NAO),  which  is  a 
periodic  change  in  atmospheric  pressure  between
Iceland  and  the  Azores  Islands.  This  pressure  differ-
ence determines the strength of the prevailing west-
erlies  in  the  North  Atlantic,  which  in  turn  affects
ocean surface currents there. The Atlantic Ocean pe-
riodically  experiences  NAO  events,  which  sometimes
cause  intense  cold  in  the  northeast  United  States,
unusual  weather  in  Europe,  and  heavy  rainfall  along
the normally arid coast of southwest Africa.

How  Often  Do  El  Niño  Events  Occur? Records  of  sea  surface  temperatures
over  the  past  100  years  reveal  that  throughout  the  20th  century, El  Niño
conditions occur on average about every 2 to 10 years, but in a highly irregular
pattern. In some decades, for instance, there has been an El Niño event every few
years, while  in  others  there  may  have  been  only  one. Figure  7.23 shows  the
pattern  since  1950, revealing  that  the  equatorial  Pacific  fluctuates  between
El Niño and La Niña conditions, with only a few years that could be considered
conditions  (represented  by  an  ENSO  index  value  close  to  zero).
Typically, El Niño events last for 12 to 18 months and are followed by La Niña
conditions that usually exist for a similar length of time. However, some El Niño
or La Niña conditions can last for several years.

normal

Recently recovered sediments from a South American lake provide a contin-
uous 10,000-year record of the frequency of El Niño events. The sediments indi-
cate that between 10,000 and 7000 years ago, no more than five strong El Niños
occurred  each  century. The  frequency  of  El  Niños  then  increased, peaking  at
about  1200  years  ago  (and  coinciding  with  the  early  Middle  Ages  in  Europe),
when they occurred every three years or so. If the pattern observed in the lake
sediments  continues, researchers  predict  that  there  should  be  an  increase  in
El Niños in the early part of the 22nd century.

El Niño events

especially severe ones may occur more frequently as a re-
sult  of  increased  global  warming. For  instance, the  two  most  severe  El  Niño
events in the 20th century occurred in 1982 1983 and 1997 1998. Presumably, in-
creased  ocean  temperatures  could  trigger  more  frequent  and  more  severe  El
Niños. However, this pattern could also be a part of a long-term natural climate
cycle. Recently, oceanographers have recognized a phenomenon called the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which lasts 20 to 30 years and appears to influence
Pacific  sea  surface  temperatures. Analysis  of  satellite  data  suggests  that  the
Pacific Ocean has been in the warm phase of the PDO from 1977 to 1999 and that
it  is  now  in  its  cool  phase, which  may  suppress  the  initiation  of  El  Niño  events
during the next few decades.

Effects  of  El  Niños  and  La  Niñas Mild  El  Niño  events  influence  only  the
equatorial  South  Pacific  Ocean  while  strong  to  very  strong  El  Niño  events  can
influence worldwide weather. Typically, stronger El Niños alter the atmospheric
jet  stream  and  produce  unusual  weather  in  most  parts  of  the  globe. Sometimes
the weather is drier than normal; at other times, it is wetter. The weather may also
be  warmer  or  cooler  than  normal. It  is  still  difficult  to  predict  exactly  how  a
particular El Niño will affect any region s weather.

Figure 7.24 shows how very strong El Niño events can result in flooding, ero-
sion, droughts, fires, tropical storms, and effects on marine life worldwide. These
weather perturbations also affect the production of corn, cotton, and coffee. More
locally, the satellite images in Figure 7.25 show that sea surface temperatures off
western North America are significantly higher during an El Niño year.

Even  though  severe  El  Niños  are  typically  associated  with  vast  amounts  of
destruction, they  can  be  beneficial  in  some  areas. Tropical  hurricane  formation,
for instance, is generally suppressed in the Atlantic Ocean, some desert regions
receive  much-needed  rain, and  organisms  adapted  to  warm-water  conditions
thrive in the Pacific.

La Niña events are associated with sea surface temperatures and weather phe-
nomena opposite  to  those  of  El  Niño. Indian  Ocean  monsoons, for  instance, are
typically drier than usual in El Niño years but wetter than usual in La Niña years.

Examples from Recent El Niños Recent El Niños provide an indication of the
variability of the effects of El Niño events. For instance, in the winter of 1976, a
moderate  El  Niño  event  coincided  with  northern  California s  worst  drought  of
the 20th century, showing that El Niño events don t always bring torrential rains
to the western United States. During that same winter, the eastern United States
experienced record cold temperatures.

THE 1982 1983 EL NIÑO The 1982 1983 El Niño is the strongest ever recorded,
causing far-ranging effects around the globe. Not only was there anomalous warming
in the tropical Pacific, but the warm water also spread along the west coast of North
America, influencing sea surface temperatures as far north as Alaska. Sea level was
higher than normal (due to thermal expansion of the water), which, when high surf
was experienced, caused damage to coastal structures and increased coastal erosion.
In addition, the jet stream swung much farther south than normal across the United
States, bringing a series of powerful storms that resulted in three times normal rainfall
across the southwestern United States. The increased rainfall caused severe flooding
and landslides as well as higher than normal snowfall in the Rocky Mountains.Alaska
and western Canada had a relatively warm winter, and the eastern United States had
its mildest winter in 25 years.

El Niño is a combined oceanic atmospheric 
phenomenon that occurs periodically in the tropical
Pacific Ocean, bringing warm water to the east. 
La Niña describes conditions opposite of El Niño.

The  full  strength  of  El  Niño  was  experienced  in  western  South  America.
Normally arid Peru was drenched with more than 3 meters (10 feet) of rain, caus-
ing extreme flooding and landslides. Sea surface temperatures were so high for so
long that temperature-sensitive coral reefs across the equatorial Pacific were dec-
imated. Marine mammals and sea birds, which depend on the food normally avail-
able in the highly productive waters along the west coast of South America, went
elsewhere or died. In the Galápagos Islands, for example, over half of the island s
fur seals and sea lions died of starvation during the 1982 1983 El Niño.

French  Polynesia  had  not  experienced  a  hurricane  in  75  years; in  1983, it
endured  six. The  Hawaiian  Island  of  Kauai  also  experienced  a  rare  hurricane.
Meanwhile, in Europe, severe cold weather prevailed.Worldwide, droughts occurred
in Australia, Indonesia, China, India, Africa, and Central America. In all, more than
2000 deaths and at least $10 billion in property damage ($2.5 billion in the United
States) were attributed to the 1982 1983 El Niño event.

THE 1997 1998 EL NIÑO The 1997 1998 El Niño event began several months
earlier  than  normal  and  peaked  in  January  1998. The  amount  of  Southern
Oscillation and sea surface warming in the equatorial Pacific was initially as strong
as  the  1982 1983  El  Niño, which  caused  a  great  deal  of  concern. However, the
1997 1998 El Niño weakened in the last few months of 1997 before reintensifying
in early 1998. The impact of the 1997 1998 El Niño was felt mostly in the tropical
Pacific, where  surface  water  temperatures  in  the  eastern  Pacific  averaged  more
than  4°C  (7°F)  warmer  than  normal, and, in  some  locations, reached  up  to  9°C
(16°F)  above  normal  (see  Figure  7.22a). High  pressure  in  the  western  Pacific
brought  drought  conditions  that  caused  wildfires  to  burn  out  of  control  in
Indonesia. Also, the  warmer  than  normal  water  along  the  west  coast  of  Central
and North America increased the number of hurricanes off Mexico.

In  the  United  States, the  1997 1998  El  Niño  caused  killer  tornadoes  in  the
Southeast, massive  blizzards  in  the  upper  Midwest, and  flooding  in  the  Ohio
River Valley. Most of California received twice the normal rainfall, which caused
flooding and landslides in many parts of the state. The lower Midwest, the Pacific
Northwest, and  the  eastern  seaboard, on  the  other  hand, had  relatively  mild
weather. In all, the 1997 1998 El Niño caused 2100 deaths and $33 billion in prop-
erty damage worldwide.

Predicting El Niño Events The 1982 1983 El Niño event was not predicted, nor
was it recognized until it was near its peak. Because it affected weather worldwide
and  caused  such  extensive  damage, the  Tropical  Ocean Global  Atmosphere
(TOGA) program was initiated in 1985 to study how El Niño events develop. The
goal  of  the TOGA  program  was  to  monitor  the  equatorial  South  Pacific  Ocean
during  El  Niño  events  to  enable  scientists  to  model  and  predict  future  El  Niño
events. The  10-year  program  studied  the  ocean  from  research  vessels, analyzed
surface  and  subsurface  data  from  radio-transmitting  sensor  buoys, monitored
oceanic phenomena by satellite, and developed computer models.

These models have made it possible to predict El Niño events since 1987 as
much  as  one  year  in  advance. After  the  completion  of  TOGA, the  Tropical
Atmosphere and Ocean (TAO) project (sponsored by the United States, Canada,
Australia, and Japan) has continued to monitor the equatorial Pacific Ocean with
a series of 70 moored buoys, providing real-time information about the conditions
of the tropical Pacific that is available on the Internet. Although monitoring has
improved, the causes of El Niño events are still not fully understood.

7.5 What Deep-Ocean Currents Exist?
Deep currents occur in the deep zone below the pycnocline, so they influence about
90% of all ocean water. Density differences create deep currents. Although these
density differences are usually small, they are large enough to cause denser waters

water masses sink below the surface, they can be identified
based on their characteristic temperature, salinity, and result-
ing density.

to sink. Deep-water currents move larger volumes of water and are much slower
than surface currents. Typical speeds of deep currents range from 10 to 20 kilome-
ters (6 to 12 miles) per year. Thus, it takes a deep current an entire year to travel the
same distance that a western intensified surface current can move in one hour.

Because the density variations that cause deep ocean circulation are caused
by differences in temperature and salinity, deep-ocean circulation is also referred
to as thermohaline (thermo * heat, haline * salt) circulation.

Origin of Thermohaline Circulation
Recall  from  Chapter  5 that  an  increase  in  seawater  density  can  be  caused  by  a
decrease in  temperature  or  an  increase in  salinity. Temperature, though, has  the
greater influence on density. Density changes due to salinity are important only in
very high latitudes, where water temperature remains low and relatively constant.
Most water involved in deep-ocean currents (thermohaline circulation) origi-
nates in high latitudes at the surface. In these regions, surface water becomes cold
and its salinity increases as sea ice forms. When this surface water becomes dense
enough, it  sinks, initiating  deep-ocean  currents. Once  this  water  sinks, it  is  re-
moved from the physical processes that increased its density in the first place, so
its temperature and salinity remain largely unchanged for the duration it spends
in  the  deep  ocean. Thus, a  temperature salinity  (T S)  diagram can  be  used  to
identify deep-water masses based on their characteristic temperature, salinity, and
resulting density. Figure 7.26 shows a T S diagram for the North Atlantic Ocean.

As these surface-water masses become dense and are
sinking  (downwelling)  in  high-latitude  areas, deep-water
masses are also rising to the surface (upwelling). Because
the water temperature in high-latitude regions is the same
at  the  surface  as it  is  down  below, the  water  column  is
isothermal, there  is  no  thermocline  or  associated  pycno-
cline (see Chapter 5), and upwelling and downwelling can
easily be accomplished.

Sources of Deep Water
In southern subpolar latitudes, huge masses of deep water form beneath sea ice
along  the  margins  of  the  Antarctic  continent. Here, rapid  winter  freezing  pro-
duces  very  cold, high-density  water  that  sinks  down  the  continental  slope  of
Antarctica and becomes Antarctic Bottom Water, the densest water in the open
ocean (Figure 7.27). Antarctic Bottom Water slowly sinks beneath the surface and
spreads into all the world s ocean basins, eventually returning to the surface per-
haps 1000 years later.

In  the  northern  subpolar  latitudes, large  masses  of  deep  water  form  in  the
Norwegian Sea. From there, the deep water flows as a subsurface current into the
North Atlantic, where it becomes part of the North Atlantic Deep Water. North
Atlantic Deep Water also comes from the margins of the Irminger Sea off south-
eastern  Greenland, the  Labrador  Sea, and  the  dense, salty  Mediterranean  Sea.
Like Antarctic Bottom Water, North Atlantic Deep Water spreads throughout the
ocean basins. It is less dense, however, so it layers on top of the Antarctic Bottom
Water (Figure 7.27).

Surface-water masses converge within the subtropical gyres and in the Arctic
and Antarctic. Subtropical  Convergences  do  not  produce  deep  water, however,
because  the  density  of  warm  surface  waters  is  too  low  for  them  to  sink. Major
sinking  does  occur, however, along  the  Arctic  Convergence and  Antarctic
Convergence (Figure 7.27, inset). The deep-water mass formed from sinking at the
Antarctic  Convergence  is  called  the  Antarctic  Intermediate  Water mass  (Fig-
ure 7.27), which remains one of world s most poorly studied water masses.

Figure 7.27 also shows that the highest density water is found along the ocean
bottom, with  less-dense  water  above. In  low-latitude  regions, the  boundary  be-
tween the warm surface water and the deeper cold water is marked by a promi-
nent  thermocline  and  corresponding  pycnocline  that  prevent  vertical  mixing.
There  is  no  pycnocline  in  high-latitude  regions, so  substantial  vertical  mixing
(upwelling and downwelling) occurs.

7.5 What Deep-Ocean Currents Exist?

225

This same general pattern of layering based on density occurs in the Pacific
and Indian Oceans as well. They have no source of Northern Hemisphere deep
water, however, so  they  lack  a  deep-water mass. In  the  northern  Pacific  Ocean,
the low salinity of surface waters prevents them from sinking into the deep ocean.
In  the  northern  Indian  Ocean, surface  waters  are  too  warm  to  sink. Oceanic
Common  Water, which  is  created  when  Antarctic  Bottom  Water  and  North
Atlantic Deep Water mix, lines the bottoms of these basins.

Worldwide Deep-Water Circulation
For every liter of water that sinks from the surface into the deep ocean, a liter of
deep water must return to the surface somewhere else. However, it is difficult to
identify specifically where this vertical flow to the surface is occurring. It is generally
believed  that  it  occurs  as  a  gradual, uniform  upwelling  throughout  the  ocean
basins and that it may be somewhat greater in low-latitude regions, where surface
temperatures are higher. Alternatively, recent research on turbulent mixing rates
between  deep-ocean  and  surface  waters  in  the  Southern  Ocean  suggests  that
deep water traveling across rugged bottom topography is a major factor in pro-
ducing the upwelling that returns deep water toward the surface.

CONVEYER-BELT CIRCULATION An integrated model combining deep thermo-
haline  circulation  and  surface  currents  is  shown  in  Figure  7.28. Because  the
overall  circulation  pattern  resembles  a  large  conveyer  belt, the  model  is  called
conveyer-belt circulation. Beginning in the North Atlantic, surface water carries
heat  to  high  latitudes  via  the  Gulf  Stream. During  the  cold  winter  months, this
heat is transferred to the overlying atmosphere, warming northern Europe.

Cooling  in  the  North  Atlantic  increases  the  density  of  this  surface  water
to the  point  where  it  sinks  to  the  bottom  and  flows  southward, initiating  the
lower limb of the  conveyor. Here, seawater flows downward at a rate equal to
100 Amazon Rivers and begins its long journey into the deep basins of all the
world s  oceans. This  limb  extends  all  the  way  to  the  southern  tip  of  Africa,
where  it  joins  the  deep  water  that  encircles  Antarctica. The  deep  water  that

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Thermohaline circulation describes the movement 
of deep currents, which are created at the surface 
in high latitudes where they become cold and dense,
so they sink.

FIGURE 7.29 Power from ocean currents. A prototype
of an ocean current power system, which uses a field of un-
derwater turbines anchored to the ocean floor. As currents
flow past the turbines, they turn the rotors and generate 
electricity. The turbines can swivel on their anchors to face
oncoming currents, so this system is also useful in locations
where strong tidal flows occur.

encircles Antarctica includes deep water that descends along the margins of the
Antarctic continent. This mixture of deep waters flows northward into the deep
Pacific and Indian Ocean basins, where it eventually surfaces and completes the
conveyer  belt  by  flowing  west  and  then  north  again  into  the  North  Atlantic
Ocean.

DISSOLVED  OXYGEN  IN  DEEP  WATER Cold  water  can  dissolve  more  oxygen
than  warm  water. Thus, deep-water  circulation  brings  dense, cold, oxygen-
enriched water from the surface to the deep ocean. During its time in the deep
ocean, deep water becomes enriched in nutrients as well, due to decomposition of
dead organisms and the lack of organisms using nutrients there.

At  various  times  in  the  geologic  past, warmer  water  probably  constituted
a larger  proportion  of deep oceanic waters. As a  result, the oceans  had  a lower
oxygen concentration than today because warm water cannot hold as much oxy-
gen. Moreover, the oxygen content of the oceans has probably fluctuated widely
throughout time.

If  high-latitude  surface  waters  did  not  sink  and  eventually  return  from  the
deep sea to the surface, the distribution of life in the sea would be considerably
different. There would be very little life in the deep ocean, for instance, because
there  would  be  no  oxygen  for  organisms  to  breathe. In  addition, life  in  surface
waters might be significantly reduced without the circulation of deep water that
brings nutrients to the surface.

7.6 Can Power From Currents Be

Harnessed as a Source of Energy?

The  movement  of  ocean  currents  has  often  been  considered  to  be  capable  of
providing a source of renewable, clean energy similar to wind farms (see Chapter 6)
but  underwater. In  fact, currents  carry  much  more  energy  than  winds  because
water has about 800 times the density of air, so currents have the potential to generate
even more power than wind farms do.

One  location  that  has  received  much  consideration  as  a  site  for  harnessing
power from ocean currents is the Florida Gulf Stream Current System, which is a
fast, western  intensified  surface  current  that  runs  along  the  East  Coast  of  the
United States. In fact, researchers have determined that at least 2000 megawatts13
of electricity could be recovered from this ocean current system along the south-
east coast of Florida alone.

Various devices that have been proposed to extract the energy in ocean cur-
rents all involve some sort of mechanism for converting the movement of water
into  electrical  energy. For  example, a  series  of  underwater  turbines  similar  to
windmills  could  be  placed  within  a  current  and  anchored  to  the  ocean  floor
(Figure 7.29). The turbines can swivel on their anchors to face oncoming currents,
so this system is also useful in locations where strong reversing tidal flows occur.
Such a system of six turbines has been successfully tested in the East River near
New York City. Once this system is expanded to its capacity of 300 turbines, it will
have the ability to generate about 10 megawatts of electricity. However, systems
such  as these are  expensive, difficult  to  maintain, and can  be dangerous to ship
traffic. In addition, placing any moving machinery into the marine environment is
problematic because seawater tends to corrode most materials. Still, similar tur-
bine systems powered by currents are in use in Strangford Lough, Ireland, and are
planned for offshore South Korea.

13Each megawatt of electricity is enough to serve the energy needs of about 800 average U.S. homes.

Chapter in Review

Ocean currents are masses of water that flow from one place to another
and  can  be  divided  into  surface  currents  that  are  wind  driven  and  deep
currents  that  are  density  driven. Currents  can  be  measured  directly  or
indirectly.

Surface currents occur within and above the pycnocline. They consist of
circular-moving  loops  of  water  called  gyres, set  in  motion  by  the  major
wind belts of the world. They are modified by the positions of the conti-
nents, the Coriolis effect, and other factors. There are five major subtropi-
cal gyres in the world, which rotate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere
and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Water is pushed toward
the center of the gyres, forming low  hills of water.

The  Ekman  spiral influences  shallow  surface  water  and  is  caused  by
winds and the Coriolis effect. The average net flow of water affected by the
Ekman  spiral  causes  the  water  to  move  at  90-degree  angles  to  the  wind
direction. At the center of a gyre, the Coriolis effect deflects the water so
that it tends to move into the hill, whereas gravity moves the water down
the hill. When gravity and the Coriolis effect balance, a geostrophic current
flowing parallel to the contours of the hill is established.

The apex (top) of the hill is located to the west of the geographical center
of the gyre due to Earth s rotation. A phenomenon called western intensifi-
cation occurs in which western boundary currents of subtropical gyres are
faster, narrower, and deeper than their eastern boundary counterparts.

Upwelling and downwelling help vertically mix deep and surface waters.
Upwelling the  movement  of  cold, deep, nutrient-rich  water  to  the
stimulates  biologic  productivity  and  creates  a  large  amount  of
surface
marine life. Upwelling and downwelling can occur in a variety of ways.

Antarctic circulation is dominated by a single large current, the Antarctic
Circumpolar Current (West Wind Drift), which flows in a clockwise direc-
tion around Antarctica and is driven by the Southern Hemisphere s pre-
vailing  westerly  winds. Between  the Antarctic  Circumpolar  Current  and
the Antarctic  continent  is  a  current  called  the  East Wind  Drift, which  is
powered  by  the  polar  easterly  winds. The  two  currents  flow  in  opposite
directions, so  the  Coriolis  effect  deflects  them  away  from  each  other,
creating the Antarctic Divergence, an area of abundant marine life due to
upwelling and current mixing.

The North Atlantic (Columbus) Gyre and the South Atlantic (Navigator)
Gyre dominate circulation in the Atlantic Ocean. A poorly developed equa-
torial  countercurrent  separates  these  two  subtropical  gyres. The  highest
velocity and best studied ocean current is the Gulf Stream, which carries
warm  water  along  the  southeastern  U.S. Atlantic  coast. Meanders  of  the

227

Gulf  Stream  produce  warm-  and  cold-core  rings. The  warming  effects  of
the Gulf Stream extend along its route and reach as far away as northern
Europe.

The Indian Ocean consists of one gyre, the Indian Ocean (Majid) Gyre,
which exists mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. The monsoon wind sys-
tem, which changes direction with the seasons, dominates circulation in the
Indian Ocean. The monsoons blow from the northeast in the winter and
from the southwest in the summer.

Circulation  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  consists  of  two  subtropical  gyres: the
North Pacific (Turtle) Gyre and the South Pacific (Heyerdahl) Gyre, which
are separated by a well-developed equatorial countercurrent.

A periodic disruption of normal sea surface and atmospheric circulation
patterns  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  is  called  El  Niño Southern  Oscillation
(ENSO). The warm phase of ENSO (El Niño) is associated with the east-
ward movement of the Pacific warm pool, halting or reversal of the trade
winds, a  rise  in  sea  level  along  the  equator, a  decrease  in  productivity
along  the  west  coast  of  South  America, and, in  very  strong  El  Niños,
worldwide changes in weather. El Niños fluctuate with the cool phase of
ENSO (La Niña conditions), which are associated with cooler than normal
water in the eastern tropical Pacific.

Deep  currents  occur  below  the  pycnocline. They  affect  much  larger
amounts  of  ocean  water  and  move  much  more  slowly  than  surface  cur-
rents. Changes  in temperature  and/or salinity  at the  surface create slight
increases  in  density, which  set  deep  currents  in  motion. Deep  currents,
therefore, are called thermohaline circulation.

The deep ocean is layered based on density. Antarctic Bottom Water, the
densest  deep-water  mass  in  the  oceans, forms  near Antarctica  and  sinks
along the continental shelf into the South Atlantic Ocean. Farther north,
at  the  Antarctic  Convergence, the  low-salinity  Antarctic  Intermediate
Water sinks to an intermediate depth dictated by its density. Sandwiched
between  these  two  masses  is  the  North  Atlantic  Deep  Water, which  has
high nutrient levels after hundreds of years in the deep ocean. Layering in
the  Pacific  and  Indian  oceans  is  similar, except  there  is  no  source  of
Northern Hemisphere deep water.

Worldwide  circulation  models  that  include  both  surface  and  deep  cur-
rents resemble a conveyer belt. Deep currents carry oxygen into the deep
ocean, which is extremely important for life on the planet.

Ocean currents can be harnessed as a source of power. Although there is
vast  potential  for  developing  this  clean, renewable  resource, significant
problems must be overcome to make this a practical source of energy.

Surfer riding a giant wave at Maverick s.
Maverick s in Half Moon Bay off central California is rated
as the world s top big wave surf spot. A unique combination
of oceanographic factors produces waves so large here
that only the most accomplished surfers even attempt to
wade into the surf zone.

a Most waves are generated
by storms, which produce
wave energy that is trans-
mitted across entire ocean
basins; as a wave passes, 
it causes the water to go
around in a circular orbit.

a As waves come into shallow
water, their physical charac-
teristics change (waves gets
slower, higher, and steeper),
which cause waves to break
in the surf zone.

a Tsunami are fast and long

waves generated by seismic
events such as underwater
fault movement; their alter-
nating surges and with-
drawals at the coast are
often very destructive.

There s no time to put on survival suits or grab a life vest; the boat s moving

through the most extreme motion of her life and there isn t even time to
shout. The refrigerator comes out of the wall and crashes across the galley.
Dirty dishes cascade out of the sink. The TV, the washing machine, the VCR
tapes, the men, all go flying. And, seconds later, the water moves in.

WAVES AND WATER
DYNAMICS

What combination of oceanographic factors causes waves to reach extreme heights at places such as
Maverick s? This site, which is rated as the world s premier big wave surf spot, is located 0.5 kilometer
(0.3 mile) offshore of Pillar Point in Half Moon Bay along the central California coast. One factor is
that Maverick s is located offshore of a prominent point of land, which, as will be explained in this
chapter, tends to concentrate wave energy due to wave refraction. Another factor is that the point
juts directly into the North Pacific Ocean, which is known for its wintertime storms and giant waves.
Still another factor is that the shoreline abruptly rises from deep depths to a shallowly submerged
rock reef, which causes waves to build up to extreme heights in a very short distance. These factors
combined  with  cold  ocean  temperatures, unforgiving  boulders  just  below  the  surface, and  the
presence of large sharks make the site challenging to even the most skilled surfers. Still, surfing com-
petitions are held every year at Maverick s for those brave enough to catch some of the world s most
extreme waves.

Most  waves  are  driven  by  the  wind  and  are  relatively  small, so  release  their  energy  gently,
although ocean storms can build up waves to extreme heights. When these waves come ashore, they
often  produce  devastating  effects or, in  the  case  at  Maverick s, a  wild  ride. Waves  are  moving
energy traveling along the interface between ocean and atmosphere, often transferring energy from
a storm far out at sea over distances of several thousand kilometers. That s why, even on calm days,
the ocean is in continual motion as waves travel across its surface.

8.1 What Causes Waves?
All waves begin as disturbances; the energy that causes ocean waves to form is called a disturbing
force. A rock thrown into a still pond, for example, creates waves that radiate out in all directions.
Releases of energy, similar to the rock hitting the water, are the cause of all waves.

Wind blowing across the surface of the ocean generates most ocean waves. The waves radiate

out in all directions, just as when the rock is thrown into the pond, but on a much larger scale.

The movement of fluids with different densities can also create waves. These waves travel along
the interface (boundary) between two different fluids. Both the air and the ocean are fluids, so waves
can be created along interfaces between and within these fluids as follows:

Along an air water interface, the movement of air across the ocean surface creates ocean waves
(simply called waves).
Along an air air interface, the movement of different air masses creates atmospheric waves, which
are often represented by ripplelike clouds in the sky. Atmospheric waves are especially common
when cold fronts (high-density air) move into an area.

Can internal waves break?

Internal  waves  do  not  break  in  the  way  that  surface
waves break in the surf zone because the density dif-
ference across an interface at depth is much smaller
than that between the atmosphere and the surface.
When  internal  waves  approach  the  edges  of  conti-
nents,  however,  they  do  undergo  similar  physical
changes as waves in the surf zone. This causes the
waves to build up and expend their energy with much
turbulent  motion,  in  essence  breaking   against  the
continent.

Along  a  water water  interface, the  movement  of  water  of  different  densities
creates  internal  waves, as  shown  in  Figure  8.1a. Because  these  waves  travel
along  the  boundary  between  waters  of  different  density, they  are  associated
with a pycnocline.1 Internal waves can be much larger than surface waves, with
heights  exceeding  100  meters  (330  feet). Tidal  movement, turbidity  currents,
wind  stress, or  even  passing  ships  at  the  surface  create  internal  waves, which
can sometimes be observed from space (Figure 8.1b). Internal waves can even
be a hazard for submarines: If submarines are caught in an internal wave while
testing  their  depth  limits, the  submarines  can  inadvertently  be  carried  to
depths  exceeding  their  designed  pressure  strength. At  the  surface, parallel
slicks caused by a film of surface debris may indicate the presence of internal
waves  below. On  a  smaller  scale, internal  waves  are  prominently  featured
sloshing back and forth in  desktop oceans, which contain two fluids that do
not mix.

Mass movement  into the ocean, such  as  coastal landslides  or large icebergs
that  fall  from  coastal  glaciers, also  creates  waves. These  waves  are  commonly
called splash waves (see Web Box 8.1 for a description of a large splash wave).

Another way in which large waves are created involves the uplift or down-
dropping of large areas of the sea floor, which can release large amounts of en-
ergy  to  the  entire  water  column  (compared  to  wind-driven  waves, which  affect
only  surface  water). Examples  include  underwater  avalanches  (turbidity  cur-
rents), volcanic  eruptions, and  fault  slippage. The  resulting  waves  are  called
seismic  sea  waves or  tsunami, which  are  discussed  later  in  this  chapter.
Fortunately, tsunami occur infrequently. When they do, however, they can flood
coastal areas and cause large amounts of destruction.

The tides are also a type of wave, in this case caused mainly by the gravita-
tional pull of the Moon and to a lesser extent, the Sun. The tides are actually very
extensive, low, and  highly  predictable  waves  that  are  discussed  in  Chapter  9,

Tides.

Human activities also cause ocean waves. When ships travel across the ocean,
they leave behind a wake, which is a wave. In fact, smaller boats are often carried
along in the wake of larger ships, and marine mammals sometimes play there.

In  all  cases, though, some  type  of  energy  release  creates  waves. Figure  8.2
shows the distribution of energy in waves, indicating that most ocean waves are
wind generated.

8.2 How Do Waves Move?
Waves are energy in motion. Waves transmit energy by means of cyclic movement
through matter. The medium itself (solid, liquid, or gas) does not actually travel in
the direction of the energy that is passing through it. The particles in the medium
simply  oscillate, or  cycle, back  and  forth, up  and  down, or  around  and  around,
transmitting  energy  from  one  particle  to  another. If  you  thump  your  fist  on  a
table, for example, the energy travels through the table as waves that someone sit-
ting at the other end can feel, but the table itself does not move.

Waves  move  in  different  ways. Simple  progressive  waves (Figure  8.3)  are
waves  that  oscillate  uniformly  and  progress  or  travel  without  breaking.
Progressive  waves  may  be  longitudinal, transverse, or  a  combination  of  the  two
motions, called orbital.

push  and  pull

In longitudinal waves (also known as push pull waves), the particles that vibrate
in  the  same  direction  that  the  energy  is  traveling, like  a  spring
whose  coils  are  alternately  compressed  and  expanded. The  shape  of  the  wave
(called a waveform) moves through the medium by compressing and decompressing

as it goes. Sound, for instance, travels as longitudinal waves. Clapping your hands
initiates  a  percussion  that  compresses  and  decompresses  the  air  as  the  sound
moves through a room. Energy can be transmitted through all states of matter
gaseous, liquid, or solid by this longitudinal movement of particles.

In transverse waves (also known as side-to-side waves), energy travels at right
angles to the direction of the vibrating particles. If one end of a rope is tied to a
doorknob while the other end is moved up and down (or side to side) by hand, for
example, a waveform progresses along the rope and energy is transmitted from
the motion of the hand to the doorknob. The waveform moves up and down (or
side to side) with the hand, but the motion is at right angles to the direction in
which energy is transmitted (from the hand to the doorknob). Generally, trans-
verse  waves  transmit  energy  only  through  solids, because  the  particles  in  solids
are bound to one another strongly enough to transmit this kind of motion.

Longitudinal and transverse waves are called body waves because they trans-
fer energy through a body of matter. Ocean waves are body waves, too, because
they  transmit  energy  through  the  upper  part  of  the  ocean  near  the  interface
between  the  atmosphere  and  the  ocean. The  movement  of  particles  in  ocean
waves involves components of  both longitudinal and transverse waves, so parti-
cles  move  in  circular  orbits. Thus, waves  at  the  ocean  surface  are  orbital  waves
(also called interface waves).

8.3 What Characteristics Do Waves

Possess?

Figure 8.4a shows the characteristics of an idealized ocean wave. The simple, uni-
form, moving waveform transmits energy from a single source and travels along
the ocean atmosphere interface. These waves are also called sine waves because
their uniform shape resembles the oscillating pattern expressed by a sine curve.
Even though idealized waveforms do not exist in nature, they help us understand
wave characteristics.

Wave Terminology
As an idealized wave passes a permanent marker (such as a pier piling), a succes-
sion  of  high  parts  of  the  waves, called  crests, alternate  with  low  parts, called
troughs. Halfway between the crests and the troughs is the still water level, or zero
energy level. This is the level of the water if there were no waves. The wave height,
designated by the symbol H, is the vertical distance between a crest and a trough.
The horizontal distance between any two corresponding points on successive
waveforms, such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough, is the wavelength, L.
Wave steepness is the ratio of wave height to wavelength:

path.  These waves transmit

(liquids and/or gases).

If  the  wave  steepness  exceeds 
7, the  wave  breaks (spills  forward)
because  the  wave  is  too  steep  to
support  itself. A  wave  can  break
anytime  the  1:7  ratio  is  exceeded,
either along the shoreline or out at
sea. This ratio also dictates the max-
imum  height  of  a  wave. For  exam-
ple, a  wave  7  meters  long  can  only
be  1  meter high; if  the  wave  is  any
higher than that, it will break.

The  time 

it  takes  one  full
wave one  wavelength to  pass  a
fixed position (like a pier piling) is
the  wave  period, T. Typical  wave
periods  range  between  6  and  16
seconds. The  frequency (f)  is  de-
fined as the number of wave crests
passing  a  fixed  location  per  unit  of  time  and  is  the  inverse  of  the
period:

Circular Orbital Motion
Waves can travel great distances across ocean basins. In one study,
waves  generated  near  Antarctica  were  tracked  as  they  traveled
through the Pacific Ocean basin. After more than 10,000 kilometers
(over  6000 miles), the  waves finally expended  their energy  a  week
later  along  the  shoreline  of  the  Aleutian  Islands  of  Alaska. The
water  itself  doesn t  travel  the  entire  distance, but  the  waveform
does. As the wave travels, the water passes the energy along by moving in a circle.
This movement is called circular orbital motion.

Observation of an object floating in the waves reveals that it moves not only
up and down, but also slightly forward and backward with each successive wave.
Figure  8.5 shows  that  a  floating  object  moves  up  and  backward  as  the  crest
approaches, up and forward as the crest passes, down and forward after the crest,
down  and  backward  as  the  trough  approaches, and  rises  and  moves  backward
again as the next crest advances. When the movement of the rubber ducky shown
in Figure 8.5 is traced as a wave passes, it can be seen that the ducky moves in a
circle and returns close to its original position.2 This motion allows a waveform
(the wave s shape) to move forward through the water while the individual water
particles that transmit the wave move around in a circle and return to essentially
the same place. Wind moving across a field of wheat causes a similar phenomenon:
The wheat itself doesn t travel across the field, but the waves do.

The circular orbits of an object floating at the surface have a diameter equal
to the wave  height (Figure  8.4a). Figure 8.4b shows that circular  orbital motion

2Actually, the circular orbit does not quite return the floating object to its original position because
the half of the orbit accomplished in the trough is slower than the crest half of the orbit. This 
results in a slight forward movement (net mass transport), which is called wave drift.

dies out quickly below the surface. At some depth below the surface, the circular
orbits become so small that movement is negligible. This depth is called the wave
base, and  it is equal  to  one-half  the  wavelength (L/2)  measured  from  still  water
level. Only  wavelength  controls  the  depth  of  the  wave  base, so  the  longer  the
wave, the deeper the wave base.

The  decrease  of  orbital  motion  with  depth  has  many  practical  applications.
For  instance, submarines  can  avoid  large  ocean  waves  simply  by  submerging
below the wave base. Even the largest storm waves will go unnoticed if a subma-
rine submerges to only 150 meters (500 feet). Floating bridges and floating oil rigs
are constructed so that most of their mass is below wave base, so they will be un-
affected by wave motion. In fact, offshore floating airport runways have been de-
signed using similar principles (Figure 8.6). In addition, seasick scuba divers find
relief  when  they  submerge  into  the  calm, motionless  water  below  wave  base.
Finally, as you walk from the beach into the ocean, you reach a point where it is
easier to dive under an incoming wave than to jump over it. It is easier to swim
through the smaller orbital motion below the surface than to fight the large waves
at the surface.

Deep-Water Waves
If the water depth (d) is greater than the wave base (L/2), the waves are called
deep-water waves (Figure 8.7a). Deep-water waves have no interference with the
ocean bottom, so they include all wind-generated waves in the open ocean, where
water depths far exceed wave base.

Wave speed (S) is the rate at which a wave travels. Numerically, it is the dis-

tance traveled divided by the travel time; for a wave, it can be calculated as:

FIGURE 8.5 A floating rubber ducky shows circular 
orbital motion. As a wave passes to the right, the motion 
of a floating rubber ducky resembles that of a circle, which 
is known as circular orbital motion.

Wave speed is more correctly known as celerity (C), which is different from
the traditional concept of speed. Celerity is used only in relation to waves where
no mass is in motion, just the waveform.

According to the equations that govern the movement of progressive waves,
the speed of deep-water waves is dependent upon (1) wavelength and (2) several
other variables (such as gravitational attraction) that remain constant on Earth.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
The ocean transmits wave energy by circular orbital
motion, where the water particles move in circular
orbits and return to approximately the same location.

FIGURE 8.6 Floating runway, Japan. This floating run-
way called  Mega-Float was built offshore Yokosuka in
Tokyo Bay, Japan, and is the world s largest, with a length of
1000 meters (3300 feet). Stable structures such as runways
and bridges can use submerged pontoons to float at the
ocean s surface as long as the majority of the structure s mass
is below wave base.

So, by  filling  in  the  constants  with  numbers, the  equation  for  wave
speed of deep-water waves varies only with wavelength and becomes
(in meters per second):

The  graph  in  Figure  8.8 uses  the  above  equations  to  relate  the
wavelength, period, and speed of deep-water waves. Of the three vari-
ables, the wave period is usually easiest to measure. Since all three vari-
ables are related, the other two can be determined using Figure 8.8. For
example, the vertical red line in Figure 8.8 shows that a wave with a pe-
riod of 8 seconds has a wavelength of 100 meters. Thus, the speed of the
wave is shown by the horizontal red line in Figure 8.8, which is:

In  summary, the  general  relationship  shown  by  Equations  8.3
through  8.8  (and  shown  in  Figure  8.8)  for  deep-water  waves  is  the
longer the wavelength, the faster the wave travels. A fast wave does not
necessarily have a large wave height, however, because wave speed de-
pends only on wavelength.

FIGURE 8.7 Characteristics of deep-water, shallow-
water, and transitional waves. (a) Deep-water waves,
showing the diminishing size of the circular orbits with 
increasing depth. (b) Transitional waves, which are 
intermediate between deep-water and shallow-water 
waves. (c) Shallow-water waves, where the ocean floor 
interferes with circular orbital motion, causing the orbits 
to become more flattened. Diagrams are not to scale.

Shallow-Water Waves
Waves in which depth (d) is less than  1
20 of the wavelength (L/20) are
called shallow-water waves, or long waves (Figure 8.7c). Shallow-water
waves are said to touch bottom or feel bottom because they touch the
ocean floor, which interferes with the wave s orbital motion.

The speed of shallow-water waves is influenced only by gravitational acceler-
ation (g) and water depth (d). Since gravitational acceleration remains constant
on Earth, the equation for wave speed becomes (in meters per second):

S 

in meters per second

= 3.13

(8.10)

Equations  8.9  and  8.10  show  that  wave  speed  in  shallow-water  waves  is
determined only by water depth, where  the  deeper the water, the faster the wave
travels.

Examples  of  shallow-water  waves  include  wind-generated  waves  that  have

earthquakes  in  the  ocean  floor; and  the  tides,
which are a type of wave generated by the gravi-
tational  attraction  of  the  Moon  and  the  Sun.
Tsunami and the tides are very long wavelength
waves, which  far  exceed  even  the  deepest  ocean
water depths.

Particle motion in shallow-water waves is in
a  very  flat  elliptical  orbit  that  approaches  hori-
zontal  (back-and-forth)  oscillation. The  vertical
component of particle motion decreases with in-
creasing  depth  below  sea  level, causing  the  or-
bits to become even more flattened.

Deep-water waves exist in water that is deeper than
wave base and move at speeds controlled by wave-
length; shallow-water waves exist in water shallower
than 1

trolled by water depth; transitional waves are 
intermediate between the two.

Transitional Waves
Waves  that  have  some  characteristics  of  shal-
low-water  waves  and  some  of  deep-water  waves  are  called  transitional  waves.
The wavelengths of transitional waves are between two times and twenty times
the water depth (Figure 8.7b). The wave speed of shallow-water waves is a func-
tion  of  water  depth; for  deep-water  waves, wave  speed  is  a  function  of  wave-
length. Thus, the  speed  of  transitional  waves  depends  partially  on  water  depth
and partially on wavelength.

8.4 How Do Wind-Generated 

Waves Develop?

Most ocean waves are generated by the wind and so are termed wind-generated
waves.

Wave Development
The life history of a wind-generated wave includes its origin in a windy region of
the ocean, its movement across great expanses of open water without subsequent
aid of wind, and its termination when it breaks and releases its energy, either in
the open ocean or against the shore.

CAPILLARY  WAVES,  GRAVITY  WAVES,  AND  THE  SEA As  the  wind  blows
over  the  ocean  surface, it  creates  pressure  and  stress. These  factors  deform  the
ocean surface into small, rounded waves with V-shaped troughs and wavelengths
less  than  1.74  centimeters  (0.7  inch). Commonly  called  ripples, these  waves  are
called capillary waves by oceanographers (Figure 8.9, left). The name comes from
capillarity, a  property  that  results  from  the  surface
tension of water.3

As capillary wave development increases, the sea
surface  takes  on  a  rougher  appearance. The  water
catches more  of  the  wind, allowing  the  wind  and
ocean  surface  to  interact  more  efficiently. As  more
energy  is  transferred  to  the  ocean, gravity  waves
develop. These are symmetric waves that have wave-
lengths  exceeding  1.74  centimeters  (0.7  inch)  (Fig-
ure 8.9, middle).

The length of gravity waves is generally 15 to 35 times their height. As addi-
tional  energy  is  gained, wave  height  increases  more  rapidly  than  wavelength.

FIGURE 8.9 Wind creates capillary and gravity waves.
As wind increases (left to right), the height and wavelength of
waves increase; they begin as capillary waves and progress to
gravity waves. When the wave steepness (H/L) exceeds a 1:7
ratio, the waves become unstable and break. (Not to scale.)

The crests  become  pointed  and  the
troughs  are  rounded, resulting  in  a
trochoidal (Trokhos * wheel) wave-
form (Figure 8.9, right).

Energy imparted by the wind in-
creases the height, length, and speed
of  the  wave. When  wave  speed
equals  wind  speed, neither  wave
height  nor  wavelength  can  change
because  there  is  no  net  energy  ex-
change and the wave has reached its
maximum size.

The  area  where  wind-driven
waves  are  generated  is  called  the
sea, or sea area. It is characterized by
choppiness  and  waves  moving  in
many  directions. The  waves  have  a
variety  of  periods  and  wavelengths
(most  of  them  short)  due  to  fre-
quently  changing  wind  speed  and
direction.

FIGURE 8.10 The  sea  and swell. As wind blows across
the  sea (red dashed line), wave size increases with increas-
ing wind speed, duration, and fetch. As waves advance be-
yond their area of origination, they advance across the ocean
surface and become sorted into uniform, symmetric swell.

FACTORS  AFFECTING  WAVE  ENERGY Figure  8.10 shows  the  factors  that
determine the amount of energy in waves. These factors are (1) the wind speed,
(2)  the  duration the  length  of  time  during  which  the  wind  blows  in  one
direction, and  (3)  the  fetch the  distance  over  which  the  wind  blows  in  one
direction.

Wave height is directly related to the energy in a wave. Wave heights in a sea
area are usually less than 2 meters (6.6 feet), but waves with heights of 10 meters
(33 feet) and periods of 12 seconds are not uncommon. As  sea waves gain en-
ergy, their steepness increases. When steepness reaches a critical value of 1

ocean breakers
form. The Beaufort Wind Scale and the state
of the sea (Table 8.1), which was initially devised by Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort
(1774 1857) of the British Navy, describes the appearance of the sea surface from
dead calm conditions to hurricane-force winds.

called whitecaps

Figure  8.11 is  a  map  based  on  satellite  data  of  average  wave  heights  during
October 3 12, 1992. The waves in the Southern Hemisphere are particularly large
because the prevailing westerlies between 40 and 60 degrees south latitude reach the
highest  average  wind  speeds  on  Earth, creating  the  latitudes  called  the  Roaring
Forties, Furious Fifties, and  Screaming Sixties.

HOW  HIGH  CAN  WAVES  BE? According to a U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office
bulletin  published  in  the  early  1900s, the  theoretical  maximum  height  of  wind-
generated  waves  should  be  no  higher  than  18.3  meters  (60  feet); this  became
known  as  the  60-foot  rule. Although  there  were  some  isolated  eyewitness
accounts of larger waves, the U.S. Navy considered any sightings of waves over 60
feet to be exaggerations. Certainly, embellishment of reported wave height under
conditions of extremely rough seas would be understandable. For many years, the

60-foot rule was accepted as fact.

Careful  observations  made  aboard  the  152-meter  (500-foot)-long  U.S. Navy
tanker  USS  Ramapo in  1933  proved  the  60-foot  rule incorrect. The  ship  was
caught in a typhoon in the western Pacific Ocean and encountered 108-kilometer-
(67-mile-) per-hour winds en route from the Philippines to San Diego. The resulting
waves were symmetrical, uniform, and had a period of 14.8 seconds. Because the
Ramapo was traveling with the waves, the vessel s officers were able to measure the
waves  accurately. The  officers  used  the  dimensions  of  the  ship, including  the  eye

than an 11-story building! These waves proved to be a
record that still stands today for the largest authenti-
cally  recorded  wind-generated  waves, shattering  the
60-foot  rule. Although  the  Ramapo was  largely
undamaged, other ships traveling in rough seas aren t
always  so  lucky  (Figure  8.13). In  fact, several  large
ships disappear at sea every year simply due to enor-
mous waves.

cally recorded wave by sighting from the bridge across the

(112 feet) was calculated based on geometric relationships 
of the vessel and the waves.

FULLY  DEVELOPED  SEA For  a  given  wind  speed,
Table 8.2 lists the minimum fetch and duration of wind
beyond which the waves cannot grow. Waves cannot grow because an equilibrium
condition, called  a  fully  developed  sea, has  been  achieved. Waves  can  grow  no
further  in  a  fully  developed  sea  because  they  lose  as  much  energy  breaking  as
whitecaps under the force of gravity as they receive from the wind.Table 8.2 also lists
the average characteristics of waves resulting from a fully developed sea, including
the height of the highest 10% of the waves.

Ship in Big Waves

SWELL As waves generated in a sea area move toward its margins, wind speeds
diminish  and  the  waves  eventually  move  faster  than  the  wind. When  this  occurs,
wave  steepness  decreases  and  waves  become  long-crested  waves  called  swells
(swellan * swollen), which are uniform, symmetrical waves that have traveled out of
their area of origination. Swells move with little loss of energy over large stretches of
the ocean surface, transporting energy away from one sea area and depositing it in
another. The  movement  of  swells  to  distant  areas  is  the  reason  why  there  can  be
waves at a shoreline even though there is no wind.

Waves with longer wavelengths travel faster and thus
leave  the  sea  area  first. They  are  followed  by  slower,
shorter wave trains, or groups of waves. The progression
from long, fast waves to short, slow waves illustrates the
principle  of  wave  dispersion (dis * apart, spargere * to
scatter)
the sorting of waves by their wavelength. Waves
of many wavelengths are present in the generating area.
Wave  speed  depends  on  wavelength  in  deep  water  (see
Figure  8.8), however, so  the  longer  waves  outrun the
shorter ones. The distance over which waves change from
a  choppy  sea to  uniform  swell  is  called  the  decay  dis-
tance, which can be up to several hundred kilometers.

As a group of waves leaves a sea area and becomes
a swell wave train, the leading wave keeps disappearing.
However, the same number of waves always remains in
the group because as the leading wave disappears, a new
wave replaces it at the back of the group (Figure 8.14).
For example, if four waves are generated, the lead wave
keeps dying out as the wave train travels, but one is cre-
ated  in  the  back, so  the  wave  train  stays  four  waves.
Because  of  the  progressive  dying  out  and  creation  of
new waves, the group moves across the ocean surface at
only half the velocity of an individual wave in the group.

FIGURE 8.13 Wave damage on the aircraft carrier
Bennington. The Bennington returns from heavy seas 
encountered in a typhoon off Okinawa in 1945 with part 
of its reinforced steel flight deck bent down over its bow.
Damage to the flight deck, which is 16.5 meters (54 feet)
above still water level, was caused by large waves.

Interference Patterns
When swells from different storms run together, the waves clash, or interfere with
one  another, giving  rise  to  interference  patterns. An  interference  pattern  pro-
duced when two or more wave systems collide is the sum of the disturbance that

I know that swell is what surfers hope for. Is swell 
always big?

Not  necessarily.  Swell  is  defined  as  waves  that  have
moved out of their area of origination, so these waves
do not have to be a certain wave height to be classi-
fied as swell. It is true, however, that the uniform and
symmetrical shape of most swell delights surfers.

What is the difference between  groundswell  and
wind swell ?

The  term  groundswell was  originally  a  sailor s  word
(and is now a surfer s term) for deep-ocean swell, such
as  might  be  generated  by  a  distant  storm  or  earth-
quake.  In  its  original  sense,  groundswell  referred  to
waves so huge that their troughs bared the  ground
of the sea bottom. Groundswell is essentially the same
thing as wind swell, although groundswell often refers
to very large waves from a distant origin whereas wind
swell refers to smaller, locally produced waves.

FIGURE 8.14 Movement of a wave train. As energy in
the leading waves (a, waves 1 and 2) is transferred into circu-

by new waves from behind (b). Even though new waves take
up the lead (c and d), the length of the wave train and the
total number of waves remain the same. This causes the
group speed to be one-half that of the individual wave.

FIGURE 8.15 Constructive, destructive, and mixed 
interference patterns. Constructive interference (left) 
occurs when waves of the same wavelength come together 
in phase (crest to crest and trough to trough), producing waves
of greater height. Destructive interference (center) occurs
when overlapping waves have identical characteristics but
come together out of phase, resulting in a canceling ef-
fect. More commonly, waves of different lengths and
heights encounter one another and produce a com-
plex, mixed interference pattern (right).

Destructive interference

Mixed interference

the  interference  pattern  results  in  a  wave  with  the  same  wavelength  as  the  two
overlapping  wave  systems, but  with  a  wave  height  equal  to  the  sum  of  the
individual wave heights (Figure 8.15, left).

Datum

DESTRUCTIVE  INTERFERENCE Destructive  interference
occurs when wave trains having the same wavelength come
together  out  of  phase, meaning  the  crest  from  one  wave
coincides with the trough from a second wave. If the waves
have  identical  heights, the  sum  of the  crest  of  one  and  the
trough  of  another  is  zero, so  the  energies  of  these  waves
cancel each other (Figure 8.15, center).

MIXED  INTERFERENCE In  most  ocean  areas, it  is  likely
that two or more swells of different heights and lengths will
come  together  and  produce  a  mixture  of  constructive  and
destructive  interference. In  this  scenario, a  more  complex
mixed  interference pattern  develops  (Figure  8.15, right).
Mixed interference patterns explain the varied sequence of
higher  and  lower  waves  called  surf  beat that  most  people
notice at the beach as well as other irregular wave patterns
that occur when two or more swells approach the shore. In
the open ocean, several swell systems often interact, creating
complex  wave  patterns  (Figure  8.16), and  sometimes, large
waves that can be hazardous to ships (Box 8.1).

8.5 How Do Waves Change

in the Surf Zone?

Most waves generated in the sea area by storm winds move
across  the  ocean  as  swell. These  waves  then  release  their
energy  along  the  margins  of  continents  in  the  surf  zone,

ROGUE WAVES: SHIPS BEWARE!

Rogue waves are massive, solitary, sponta-
neous  ocean  waves  that  can  reach  enor-
mous  height  and  often  occur  at  times
when normal ocean waves are not unusu-
ally  large. In  a  sea  of  2-meter  (6.5-foot)
waves, for  example, a  20-meter  (65-foot)
rogue wave may suddenly appear. Rogue
means  unusual
and, in  this  case, the
large. Rogue
waves  are  unusually 
waves
superwaves,
monster  waves, sleeper  waves, or  freak
are defined as individual waves of
waves
exceptional  height  or  abnormal  shape
that  are  more  than  twice  the  average  of
the  highest  one-third  of  all  the  wave
heights  in  a  given  wave  record. Mariners
often  describe  rogue  wave  crests  as
mountains of water and their troughs as
holes  in  the  sea,
creating  a  roller-

sometimes  called 

coaster ride that can be disastrous.

Because  of  their  size  and  destructive
power, rogue waves have been popularized
in literature and movies such as The Perfect
Storm and the recent film remake Poseidon.
The  impressive  size  of  some  rogue  waves
makes them quite hazardous to oil-drilling
platforms and vessels at sea. In 1966, for ex-
ample, the Italian luxury liner Michelangelo
received  extensive  damage  from  a  rogue
wave  it encountered during a  storm in the
North  Atlantic  (Figure  8A). In  a  nearby
area  in  1995, the  giant  luxury  liner  Queen
Elizabeth II, which carries 1500 passengers,
plowed through a 29-meter (95-foot) wave
generated by Hurricane Luis.

In the open ocean, 1 wave in 23 will be
over twice the height of the wave average,
1 in 1175 will be three times as high, and 1
in  300,000  will  be  four  times  as  high. The
chances of a truly monstrous wave, there-
fore, are  only  1 
in  several  billion.
Nevertheless, rogue  waves  do  occur, and
satellite  observations  over  a  three-week
period in 2001 confirmed that rogue waves
occur  more  frequently  than  were  previ-
ously  thought: The  study  documented
more  than  10  individual  giant  waves
around  the  globe  of  over  25  meters  (82
feet)  in  height. Even  with  satellite  moni-
toring of ocean waves (see Web Table 3.1),
it  remains difficult  to forecast  specifically

FIGURE 8A Damage to the Michelangelo from a rogue wave. In April 1966, while making
a crossing of the North Atlantic Ocean, the Italian luxury liner Michelangelo encountered a
rogue wave amid a storm. As the wave crashed aboard the ship, it ripped off part of the ship s
bow, tore a hole in its superstructure, smashed bridge windows 24 meters (80 feet) above the 
waterline, killed three people, and injured dozens more.

when or where rogue waves will arise. For
instance, the  17-meter  (56-foot)  NOAA
research  vessel  R/V  Ballena was  flipped
and sunk in 2000 by a 4.6-meter (15-foot)
rogue wave off the California coast while
conducting  a  survey  in  shallow, calm
water. Fortunately, the  three  people  on
board survived the incident.

Worldwide  each  year, about  10  large
ships  such  as  supertankers  or  container-
ships are reported missing without a trace;
as many as 1000 vessels of all sizes are lost
each year, with rogue waves the suspected
cause of many of the sinkings. Still, scien-
tists  lack  detailed  shipboard  measure-
ments  of  rogue  waves  because  they  tend
to  appear  without  warning, and  bobbing
ships make poor observations platforms.

The main cause of rogue waves is the-
orized to be an extraordinary case of con-
structive wave interference where multiple

waves  overlap  in-phase  to  produce  an  ex-
tremely large wave. Rogue waves also tend
to  occur  more  frequently  near  weather
fronts  and  downwind  from  islands  or
shoals. Recent modeling of the wave condi-
tions in the Pacific that caused a Japanese
fishing  vessel  to  capsize  in  2008  suggests
that rogue waves can be created when the
low-  and  high-frequency  components  of
ordinary ocean waves interact and channel
their energy into a narrow frequency band.
Another way in which rogue waves can
be  created  is  when  strong  ocean  currents
focus  and  amplify  opposing  swells. Such
conditions exist along the  Wild Coast off
the  southeast  coast  of  Africa, where  the
Agulhas Current flows directly against large
Antarctic  storm  waves, creating  rogue
waves that can crash onto a ship s bow, over-
come  its  structural  capacity, and  sink  even
large, well-constructed ships (Figure 8B).

FIGURE 8.17 Physical changes of a wave in the surf
zone. As waves approach the shore and encounter water
depths of less than one-half wavelength, the waves  feel bot-
tom. The wave speed decreases and waves stack up against
the shore, causing the wavelength to decrease. This results in
an increase in wave height to the point where the wave
steepness is increased beyond the 1:7 ratio, causing the wave
to pitch forward and break in the surf zone.

Wave Motion and
Wave Refraction

which is the zone of breaking waves. Breaking waves exemplify power and per-
sistence, sometimes  moving  objects  weighing  several  tons. In  doing  so, energy
from a distant storm can travel thousands of kilometers until it is finally expended
along a distant shoreline in a few wild moments.

Physical Changes as Waves Approach Shore
As  deep-water  waves  of  swell  move  toward  continental  margins  over  gradually
shoaling (shold * shallow)  water, they  eventually  encounter  water  depths  that
are less than one-half of their wavelength (Figure 8.17) and become transitional
waves. Actually, any shallowly submerged obstacle (such as a coral reef, sunken
wreck, or sand bar) will cause waves to release some energy. Navigators have long
known that breaking waves indicate dangerously shallow water.

Many physical changes occur to a wave as it encounters shallow water, becomes
a shallow-water wave, and breaks. The shoaling depths interfere with water particle
movement at the base of the wave, so the wave speed decreases. As one wave slows,
the following waveform, which is still moving at its original speed, moves closer to
the wave that is being slowed, causing a decrease in wavelength.Although some wave
energy is lost due to friction, the wave energy that remains must go somewhere, so
wave height increases. This increase in wave height combined with the decrease in
wavelength  causes  an  increase  in  wave  steepness (H/L). When  the  wave  steepness
reaches the 1:7 ratio, the waves break as surf (Figure 8.17).

If the surf is swell that has traveled from distant storms, breakers will develop rel-
atively near shore in shallow water. The horizontal motion characteristic of shallow-
water waves moves water alternately toward and away from the shore as an oscilla-
tion. The surf will be characterized by parallel lines of relatively uniform breakers.

If the surf consists of waves generated by local winds, the waves may not have
been sorted into swell. The surf may be mostly unstable, deep-water, high-energy
waves with steepness already near the 1:7 ratio. In this case, the waves will break
shortly after feeling bottom some distance from shore, and the surf will be rough,
choppy, and irregular.

When the water depth is about one and one-third times the wave height, the
crest  of  the  wave  breaks, producing  surf.4 When  the  water  depth  becomes  less
than 1
20 the wavelength, waves in the surf zone begin to behave like shallow-water
waves (see Figure 8.7). Particle motion is greatly impeded by the bottom, and a
significant transport of water toward the shoreline occurs (Figure 8.17).

4Using this relationship provides a handy way of estimating water depth in the surf zone: The depth
of the water where waves are breaking is one and one-third times the breaker height.

How Do Waves Change in the Surf Zone?

245

Waves break in the surf zone because particle motion near the bottom of the
wave is severely restricted, slowing the waveform. At the surface, however, individ-
ual orbiting water particles have not yet been slowed because they have no contact
with the bottom. In addition, the wave height increases in shallow water. The dif-
ference in speed between the top and bottom parts of the wave causes the top part
of the wave to overrun the lower part, which results in the wave toppling over and
breaking. Breaking waves are analogous to a person who leans too far forward. If
you don t catch yourself, you may also  break something when you fall.

Breakers and Surfing
There are three main types of breakers. Figure 8.18a shows a spilling breaker, which
is a turbulent mass of air and water that runs down the front slope of the wave as it
breaks. Spilling breakers result from a gently sloped ocean bottom, which gradually
extracts energy from the wave over an extended distance  and produces breakers
with  low  overall  energy. As  a  result, spilling  breakers  have  a  longer  life  span
and give surfers a long but somewhat less exciting ride than other breakers.

Figure 8.18b shows a plunging breaker, which has a curling crest that moves
over an air pocket. The curling crest occurs because the particles in the crest liter-
ally  outrun  the  wave, and
there 
is  nothing  beneath
them  to support  their  mo-
tion. Plunging breakers form
on  moderately  steep  beach
slopes and are the best waves
for surfing (see the chapter-
opening photo).

K E Y   C O N C E P T
As waves come into shallow water and feel bottom,
their speed and wavelength decrease while their
wave height and wave steepness increase; this 
action causes waves to break.

breaker, resulting from a gradual beach slope.
(b) Plunging breaker, resulting from a steep

When the ocean bottom
has  an  abrupt  slope,
the
wave  energy  is  compressed
into  a  shorter  distance  and
the wave will surge forward,
creating  a  surging  breaker
(Figure  8.18c). These  waves

Surfing is  analogous  to
riding  a  gravity-operated
water  sled  by  balancing  the
forces  of  gravity  and  buoy-
ancy. The  particle  motion  of
ocean waves (see Figure 8.4)
shows  that  water  particles
move up into the front of the
crest. This  force, along  with
the  buoyancy  of  the  surf-
board, helps  maintain  a
surfer s position in front of a
breaking wave. The trick is to
perfectly balance the force of

Why is surfing so much better along the West Coast
of the United States than along the East Coast?

There  are  three  main  reasons  why  the  U.S.  West
Coast has better surfing conditions:

The waves are generally bigger in the Pacific. The
Pacific  is  larger  than  the  Atlantic,  so  the  fetch  is
larger,  allowing  bigger  waves  to  develop  in  the
Pacific.
The beach slopes are generally steeper along the
West  Coast.  Along  the  East  Coast,  the  gentle
slopes  often  create  spilling  breakers,  which  are
not  as  favorable  for  surfing.  The  steeper  beach
slopes  along  the  West  Coast  cause  plunging
breakers, which are better for surfing.
The  wind  is  more  favorable.  Most  of  the  United
States  is  influenced  by  the  prevailing  westerlies,
which blow toward shore and enhance waves along
the  West  Coast.  Along  the  East  Coast,  the  wind
blows away from shore.

Wave Motion and
Wave Refraction

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Wave refraction is the bending of waves caused
when slow in shallow water; wave reflection is the
bouncing back of wave energy caused when waves
strike a hard barrier.

wave face) to enable a surfer to be propelled forward by the wave s energy. A skill-
ful surfer, by positioning the board properly on the wave front, can regulate the de-
gree to which the propelling gravitational forces exceed the buoyancy forces, and
speeds up to 40 kilometers (25 miles) per hour can be obtained while moving along
the face of a breaking wave. When the wave passes over water that is too shallow to
allow the upward movement of water particles to continue, the wave has expended
its energy and the ride is over.

Wave Refraction
Waves  seldom  approach  a  shore  at  a  perfect  right  angle  (90  degrees). Instead,
some segment of the wave will  feel bottom first and will slow before the rest of
the wave. This results in the refraction (refringere * to break up) or bending, of
each wave crest (also called a wave front) as waves approach the shore.

Figure  8.19a shows  how  waves  coming  toward  a  straight  shoreline  are  re-
fracted  and  tend  to  align  themselves  nearly parallel  to  the  shore. This  explains
why all waves come almost straight in toward a beach, no matter what their origi-
nal  orientation  was. Figure  8.19b shows  how  waves  coming  toward  an  irregular
shoreline refract so that they, too, nearly align with the shore. Figure 8.19c shows a
classic example of wave refraction around Rincon Point in California.

The refraction of waves along an irregular shoreline distributes wave energy
unevenly along the shore. To help illustrate how this works, notice the long black
arrows  in  Figure  8.19b, which  are  called  orthogonal  (ortho * straight, gonia *
angle) lines or wave rays. Orthogonal lines are drawn perpendicular to the wave
crests (so they indicate the direction that waves travel) and are spaced so that the
energy between lines is equal at all times. Far from shore, notice how the orthogo-
nals in Figure 8.19b are evenly spaced. As they approach the shore, however, no-
tice  how  the  orthogonals  converge on  headlands  that  jut  into  the  ocean  and
diverge in bays. This means that wave energy is focused against the headlands but
dispersed in bays. As a result, large waves occur at headlands, which are areas of
good surfing5 and sites of erosion. Conversely, smaller waves occur in bays, which
often  provide  areas  for  boat  anchorages  and  are  also  associated  with  sediment
deposition. In addition, waves approaching shore are also influenced by sea floor
features such as shallow banks or submarine canyons.

Wave Reflection
Not all wave energy is expended as waves rush onto the shore. A vertical barrier,
such as a seawall or a rock ledge, can reflect waves back into the ocean with little
loss of energy
a process called wave reflection (reflecten * to bend back), which
is  similar  to  how  a  mirror  reflects  (bounces)  back  light. If  the  incoming  wave
strikes the barrier at a right (90-degree) angle, for example, the wave energy is re-
flected back parallel to the incoming wave, often interfering with the next incom-
ing wave and creating unusual waveforms. More commonly, waves approach the
shore  at  an  angle, causing  wave  energy  to  be  reflected  at  an  angle  equal  to  the
angle at which the wave approached the barrier.

THE  WEDGE:  A  CASE  STUDY  OF  WAVE  REFLECTION  AND  CONSTRUCTIVE
INTERFERENCE An  outstanding  example  of  wave  reflection  and  constructive
interference occurs in an area called The Wedge, which develops west of the jetty
that protects the harbor entrance at Newport Harbor, California (Figure 8.20). The
jetty  is  a  solid  human-made  object  that  extends  into  the  ocean  400  meters  (1300
feet)  and  has  a  near-vertical  side  facing  the  waves. As  incoming  waves  strike  the
vertical  side  of  the  jetty  at  an  angle, they  are  reflected  at  an  equivalent  angle.

5Sailors have long known that  the points draw the waves. Surfers also know how wave refraction
causes good  point breaks.

Because the original waves and the reflected waves have the same wavelength, a
constructive  interference  pattern  develops, creating  plunging  breakers  that  may
exceed  8  meters  (26  feet)  in  height  (Figure  8.20, inset). Too  dangerous  for  board
surfers, these waves present a fierce challenge to the most experienced body surfers.
The Wedge has crippled and even killed many who have come to challenge it.

STANDING  WAVES,  NODES,  AND  ANTINODES Standing  waves (also  called
stationary waves) can be produced when waves are reflected at right angles to a
barrier. Standing  waves  are  the  sum  of  two  waves  with  the  same  wavelength
moving in opposite directions, resulting in no net movement. Although the water
particles continue to move vertically and horizontally, there is none of the circular
motion that is characteristic of a progressive wave.

Figure 8.21 shows the movement of water during the wave cycle of a standing
wave. Lines  along  which  there  is  no  vertical  movement  are  called  nodes
(nodus * knot), or nodal lines. Antinodes, which are crests that alternately become
troughs, are the points of greatest vertical movement within a standing wave.

FIGURE 8.19 Wave refraction. (a) Wave refraction along a
straight shoreline.Waves approaching the shore at an angle first
feel bottom close to shore. This causes the segment of the
wave in shallow water to slow, causing the crest of the wave to
refract or bend so that the waves arrive at the shore nearly par-
allel to the shoreline. Red arrows represent direction and speed
of the wave. (b) Wave refraction along an irregular shoreline. As
waves first  feel bottom in the shallows off the headlands, they
are slowed, causing the waves to refract and align nearly parallel
to the shoreline. Evenly spaced orthogonal lines (long black ar-

(causing erosion) and dispersed in bays (resulting in deposition).

Tsunami

When water sloshes back and forth in a basin, the maximum vertical displace-
ments are at the antinodes. When water moves from crest to trough at an antin-
ode, the  displaced  volume  of  water  has  to  move  horizontally  to  raise  the  water
level of the adjacent antinode from trough to crest. As a result, there is no vertical
motion  at  the  node; instead, there  is  only  horizontal  motion. At  the  antinodes,
however, the movement of water particles is entirely vertical.

We ll consider standing waves further when tidal phenomena are discussed in
Chapter 9, Tides. Under certain conditions, the development of standing waves
significantly affects the tidal character in coastal regions.

8.6 How Are Tsunami Created?
The  Japanese  term  for  the  large, sometimes  destructive  waves  that  occasionally
roll into their harbors is tsunami (tsu * harbor, nami * wave[s]) Tsunami origi-
nate  from  sudden  changes  in  the  topography  of  the  sea  floor  caused  by  such
events as slippage along underwater faults, underwater avalanches such as turbid-
ity currents or the collapse of large oceanic volcanoes, and underwater volcanic
eruptions. Many people mistakenly call them  tidal waves, but tsunami are unre-
lated  to  the  tides. The  mechanisms  that  trigger  tsunami  are  typically  seismic
events, so tsunami are seismic sea waves.

The  majority  of  tsunami  are  caused  by  fault  movement. Underwater  fault
movement displaces Earth s crust, generates earthquakes, and, if it ruptures the sea
floor, produces a sudden change in water level at the ocean surface (Figure 8.22a).
Faults  that  produce  vertical displacements  (the  uplift  or  downdropping  of  ocean
floor) change the volume of the ocean basin, which affects the entire water column
and  generates  tsunami. Conversely, faults  that  produce  horizontal displacements
(such as the lateral movement associated with transform faulting) do not generally
generate  tsunami  because  the  side-to-side  movement  of  these  faults  does  not
change the volume of the ocean basin. Much less common events, such as underwa-
ter avalanches triggered by shaking or underwater volcanic eruptions which cre-
ate the largest waves also produce tsunami. In addition, large objects that splash
into the ocean, such as above-water coastal landslides (see Web Box 8.1) or mete-
orite impacts, produce splash waves, which are a type of tsunami.

During  the  20th  century, 498  measurable  tsunami  occurred  worldwide,
with 66 resulting in fatalities. The source events were earthquakes (86%), volcanic
activity  (5%), landslides  (4%), or  a  combination  of  those  processes  (5%).
Tsunami generated by meteorite or asteroid impacts occur much less frequently.
The wavelength of a typical tsunami exceeds 200 kilometers (125 miles), so it is a
shallow-water wave everywhere in the ocean.6 Because tsunami are shallow-water

6Recall that the depth of the wave base is equal to one-half a wave s wavelength. Thus, tsunami can typi-
cally be felt to depths of 100 kilometers (62 miles), which is deeper than even the deepest ocean trenches.

waves, their  speed  is  determined  only  by  water  depth. In  the  open  ocean, tsunami
move at well over 700 kilometers (435 miles) per hour
they can easily keep pace with
a jet airplane and have heights of only about 0.5 meter (1.6 feet). Even though they
are fast, tsunami are small in the open ocean and pass unnoticed in deep water until
they reach shore, where they slow in the shallow water and undergo physical changes
(just as wind-generated waves do) that cause the tsunami to increase in wave height.

Coastal Effects
Contrary to popular belief, a tsunami does not form a huge breaking wave at the
shoreline. Instead, it is a strong flood or surge of water that causes the ocean to
advance (or, in certain cases, retreat) dramatically. In fact, a tsunami resembles a
sudden, extremely high tide, which is why they are misnamed  tidal waves. It may
take many minutes for the tsunami to express itself fully, during which time sea
level can rise up to 40 meters (131 feet) above normal, with normal waves super-
imposed on top of the higher sea level. The strong surge of water can rush into
low-lying areas with destructive results (Figure 8.22b).

As the trough of the tsunami arrives at the shore, the water will rapidly drain
off  the  land. In  coastal  areas, it  will  look  like  a  sudden  and  extremely low  tide,
where  sea  level  is  many  meters  lower  than  even  the  lowest  low  tide. Because
tsunami are typically a series of waves, there is often an alternating series of dra-
matic surges and withdrawals of water that are widely separated in time. The first
surge is only rarely the largest; instead, the third, fourth or even seventh surge
may be the largest and can occur several hours later.

Depending on the geometry of sea floor motion that creates a tsunami, the
trough can sometimes arrive at a coast first. For example, on the side of a fault
where the sea floor drops down, the first part of the wave to propagate outward
will be the trough, followed by the crest. Conversely, on the side of the fault that
moves  upward, the  crest  leads  the  trough. At  a  coast  where  the  trough  arrives
first, the water drains out and exposes parts of the lowermost shoreline that are
rarely seen. For people at the shoreline, the temptation is to explore these newly
exposed  areas  and  catch  stranded  organisms. Within  a  few  minutes, however, a
strong surge of water (the crest of the tsunami) is due to arrive.

The alternating surges and retreats of water by tsunami can severely damage
coastal  structures  and  can  injure  or  kill  people  as  well. The  speed  of  the
advance up to 4 meters (13 feet) per second is faster than any human can run.
Those who are caught in a tsunami are often drowned or crushed by floating de-
bris (Figure 8.23).

Some Examples of Historic and Recent Tsunami
Although many small tsunami are created each year, most go unnoticed. On aver-
age, 57  noticeable  tsunami  occur  every  decade, with  a  large  tsunami  occurring
somewhere  in  the  world  every  two  to  three  years  and  an  extremely  large  and
damaging one occurring every 15 to 20 years.

Where do most tsunami occur? About 86% of all great waves are generated
in the Pacific Ocean because large-magnitude earthquakes occur along the series
of  trenches  that  ring  its  ocean  basin  where  oceanic  plates  are  subducted  along
convergent plate boundaries. Volcanic activity is also common along the  Pacific
Ring of Fire, and the large earthquakes that occur along its margin are capable of
producing extremely large tsunami. Figure 8.24 shows that since 1990 a number of
destructive tsunami have occurred along the Pacific Ring of Fire.

THE  ERUPTION  OF  KRAKATAU  (1883) One  of  the  most  destructive  tsunami
ever  generated  came  from  the  eruption  of  the  volcanic  island  of  Krakatau7 on

7The island Krakatau (which is west of Java) is also called Krakatoa.

August  27, 1883. Approximately  the  size  of  a  small  Hawaiian  Island  in  what  is
now  Indonesia, Krakatau  exploded  with  the  greatest  release  of  energy  from
Earth s  interior  ever  recorded  in  historic  times. The  island, which  stood  450
meters  (1500  feet)  above  sea  level, was  nearly  obliterated. The  sound  of  the
explosion  was heard  throughout the Indian  Ocean  up to  4800  kilometers  (3000
miles)  away  and  remains  the  loudest  noise  on  human  record. Dust  from  the
explosion ascended into the atmosphere and circled Earth on high-altitude winds,
producing brilliant red sunsets worldwide for nearly a year.

Not  many  people  were  killed  by  the  outright  explosion  of  the  volcano  be-
cause the island was uninhabited. However, the displacement of water from the
energy released during the explosion was enormous, creating a tsunami that ex-
ceeded  35  meters  (116  feet)
as  high  as  a  12-story  building. It  devastated  the
coastal  region  of  the  Sunda  Strait  between  the  nearby  islands  of  Sumatra  and
Java, drowning more than 1000 villages and taking more than 36,000 lives. The en-
ergy  carried  by  this  wave  reached  every  ocean basin  and  was  even  detected  by
tide-recording stations as far away as London and San Francisco.

Like  most  of  the  other  approximately  130  active  volcanoes  in  Indonesia,
Krakatau was formed along the Sunda Arc, a 3000-kilometer (1900-mile) curving
chain of volcanoes associated with the subduction of the Australian Plate beneath
the Eurasian Plate. Where these two sections of Earth s crust meet, earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions are common.

THE  SCOTCH  CAP,  ALASKA/HILO,  HAWAII  TSUNAMI  (1946) A  strong  and
damaging  tsunami  hit  the  Hawaiian  Islands  on April  1, 1946, with  north-facing
shores  including  the  port  city  of  Hilo  receiving  the  majority  of  damage. The
tsunami was from a magnitude 
earthquake in the Aleutian Trench off
the island of Unimak, Alaska, more than 3000 kilometers (1850 miles) away. From
that direction, the offshore bathymetry in Hilo Bay focused the tsunami s energy
directly  toward  town, so  the  city  of  Hilo  experienced  tsunami  surges  of
tremendous heights. In this case, the tsunami expressed itself as a strong recession
followed by a surge of water nearly 17 meters (55 feet) above normal high tide,
causing more than $25 million in damage and killing 159 people. Remarkably, it
stands as Hawaii s worst natural disaster (Figure 8.23).

What is the record height of a tsunami?

Japan,  which  is  in  close  proximity  to  several  subduc-
tion zones and endures more tsunami than any other
place on Earth (followed by Chile and Hawaii), holds the
record. The largest documented tsunami occurred in
the Ryukyu Islands of southern Japan in 1971, when
one raised normal sea level by 85 meters (278 feet).
In  low-lying  coastal  areas,  such  an  enormous  vertical
rise  can  send  water  many  kilometers  inland,  causing
flooding and widespread damage.

Closer to the source of the earthquake, the tsunami was considerably larger.
The tsunami struck Scotch Cap, Alaska, on Unimak Island, where a two-story re-
inforced concrete lighthouse stood 14 meters (46 feet) above sea level at its base.
The lighthouse was destroyed by a wave that is estimated to have reached 36 me-
ters (118 feet), killing all five people inside the lighthouse at the time. Vehicles on
a nearby mesa 31 meters (103 feet) above water level were also moved by the on-
rush of water.

PAPUA  NEW  GUINEA  (1998)
Guinea  in  the  western  part  of  the  Pacific  Ring  of  Fire, a  magnitude

earthquake  was  followed  shortly  thereafter  by  a  15-meter  (49-foot)  tsunami,
which was up to five times larger than expected for a quake that size. The tsunami
completely overtopped a heavily populated low-lying sand bar, destroying three
entire villages and resulting in at least 2200 deaths. Researchers who mapped the
sea  floor  after  the  tsunami  discovered  the  remains  of  a  huge  underwater
landslide, which  was  apparently  triggered  by  the  shaking  and  caused  the
unusually large tsunami.

INDIAN  OCEAN  (2004) Although  most  tsunami  are  associated  with  offshore
trenches where plates experience subduction along the rim of the Pacific Ocean,
tsunami  sometimes  occur  in  other  ocean  basins. On  December  26, 2004, for
example, a  magnitude 
earthquake  occurred  about  100  kilometers
(60 miles) off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, and uplifted the sea floor, which
generated a devastating tsunami that was felt throughout the Indian Ocean and
caused widespread damage (Box 8.2).

Mw = 9.3

Tsunami Warning System
In response to the tsunami that struck Hawaii in 1946, a tsunami warning system
was  established  throughout  the  Pacific  Ocean. It  led  to  what  is  now  the  Pacific
Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC), which coordinates information from 25 Pacific
Rim countries and is headquartered in Ewa Beach (near Honolulu), Hawaii. The
some of which travel through Earth
tsunami warning system uses seismic waves
at speeds 15 times faster than tsunami
to forecast destructive tsunami. In addi-
tion, oceanographers  have  recently  established  a  network  of  sensitive  pressure
sensors  on  the  deep-ocean  floor  of  the  Pacific. The  program, called  Deep-ocean
Assessment  and  Reporting  of  Tsunamis  (DART), utilizes  sea  floor  sensors  that
are capable of picking up the small yet distinctive pressure pulse from a tsunami
passing above. The pressure sensors relay information to a buoy at the surface that
transmits the data via satellite, allowing oceanographers to detect the passage of a
tsunami in the open ocean (Figure 8.25). DART buoys, which are essential compo-
nents of tsunami warning systems, have now been deployed in all oceans.

TSUNAMI WATCHES AND TSUNAMI WARNINGS When a seismic disturbance
occurs  beneath  the  ocean  surface  that  is  large  enough  to  be  tsunamigenic
(capable  of  producing  a  tsunami), a  tsunami  watch is  issued. At  this  point, a
tsunami may or may not have been generated, but the potential for one exists.

The PTWC is linked to a series of sea floor pressure sensors, ocean buoys, and
tide-measuring stations throughout the Pacific, so the recording stations nearest
the earthquake are closely monitored for any indication of unusual wave activity.
If unusual wave activity is verified, the tsunami watch is upgraded to a  tsunami
warning. Generally, earthquakes  smaller  than  magnitude 
are  not
tsunamigenic because they lack the duration of ground shaking necessary to initi-
ate  a  tsunami. Additionally, transform  faults  do  not  usually  produce  tsunami
because lateral movement does not offset the ocean floor and impart energy to
the water column in the same way that vertical fault movements do.

How Are Tsunami Created?

253

On  December  26, 2004, an  enormous
earthquake  struck  off  the  west  coast  of
Sumatra  in  Indonesia. Known  as  the
Sumatra Andaman  Earthquake,
it  was
the  second  biggest  earthquake  recorded
during the past century and the largest to
be  recorded  by  modern  seismograph
equipment. The  earthquake  was  so  large
that it changed Earth s gravity field, trig-
gered  small  earthquakes  as  far  away  as
Alaska, and even altered Earth s rotation.
Initially,
it  was  deemed  a  magnitude
but  it  was  subsequently  up-
Mw = 9.0,
graded  to  magnitude 
The
earthquake occurred about 30 kilometers
(19 miles) beneath the sea floor near the
Sunda  Trench  where  the  Indian  Plate  is
being  subducted  beneath  the  Eurasian
Plate. Moreover, about  1200  kilometers
(750  miles)  of  sea  floor  was  ruptured
along  the  interface  of  these  two  tectonic
plates, thrusting  sea  floor  upward  and
generating  about  10  meters  (33  feet)  of
vertical displacement. This abrupt vertical
movement of the sea floor is what gener-
ated the deadliest tsunami in history.

Mw = 9.3.

Once  generated, the  tsunami  spread
out  at  jetliner  speeds  across  the  Indian
Ocean. Only  15  minutes  after  the  earth-
quake, the  tsunami  hit  the  shores  of
Sumatra with a series of alternating rapid
withdrawals  and  strong  surges  up  to  35
meters  (115  feet)  high. Many  coastal  vil-
lages  were  completely  washed  away
(Figure  8C), causing  several  hundred
thousand  deaths. Sites  farther  from  the
quake zone experienced smaller but nev-
ertheless  deadly  waves. Particularly  af-
fected  were Thailand  (see  Figure  8.22b),
which was struck by the tsunami about 75
minutes after the quake occurred, and Sri
Lanka and India, which were pounded by
devastating waves about three hours after
the earthquake. After seven hours and at
a  distance  of  more  than  5000  kilometers
(3000  miles), the  tsunami  hit  the  east
coast of Africa, where it still had enough
power  to  kill  more  than  a  dozen  people.

Although  much  smaller,
the
tsunami  was  also  detected  in
the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic
Oceans.

(a) Before: January 10, 2003

In  a  remarkable  coinci-
dence,
the  Jason-1  satellite
happened  to  be  passing  over
the  Indian  Ocean  two  hours
after  the  tsunami  originated
(Figure  8D). The  satellite s
radar  altimeter, which  is  de-
signed  to  accurately  measure
the elevation of the ocean sur-
face (see Box 3.1), was able to
detect  the  crests
and  troughs  of
the  tsunami
as  it  radi-
ated  out
across
the
Indian
Ocean
with 
a
wavelength
of  about  500

occurred  about  an  hour  before
the first waves struck Sri Lanka
and  India,
the  satellite  data
couldn t  have  been  used  to
warn  tsunami  victims  because
scientists  needed  several  hours
to  analyze 
information.
However, these  satellite  data
are  particularly  valuable  be-
cause  they  will  allow  scientists
to  check  the  accuracy  of  open-
ocean  tsunami  travel  models,

In  all, nearly  300,000  people  in  11
countries were killed by the tsunami, rank-
ing this tragedy as the most deadly tsunami
in  recorded  history. The  tsunami  also
caused  billions  of  dollars  of  damage
throughout  the  region  and  left  millions
homeless. Why was there such a large loss
of life during the tsunami? One factor was
the lack of a warning system in the Indian
Ocean like the network of buoys and deep-
sea  instruments  that  monitors  earthquake
and  wave  activity  in  the  Pacific  Ocean,
where  most  tsunami  have  historically  oc-
curred. Another  is  the  lack  of  an  emer-
gency response system to warn beachgoers
and coastal communities. Still another was
the lack of good public awareness in recog-
nizing  the  signs  of  an  impending  tsunami,
such as when a rapid withdrawal of water is
observed  at  the  shore, which  is  caused  by
the trough of the tsunami arriving first and
indicates  that  an  equally  strong  surge  of
water will soon follow.

Studies  of  the  effect  of  the  tsunami
on different coastlines suggest that those
areas  lacking  protective  coral  reefs  or
mangroves  received  stronger  surges. In
many cases, the shape of the coastline as
well  as  the  geometry  of  the  offshore

sea floor  affected  the  height  of  the
tsunami  and  the  amount  of  coastal
destruction. Sediment  cores  reveal
that  several  other  large  tsunami  have
occurred in the region during the past
1000 years.

this  time  an 

On  July  17, 2006, another  strong

earthquake
earthquake  associated  with  faulting  in
the  Java Trench  off the  southern  coast
of Java, Indonesia triggered a 2-meter
(6.6-foot)  tsunami  that  killed  more
than  637  people, injured  at  least  600,
and destroyed many coastal structures.
This  destruction  near  the  area  that
experienced even greater damage from
the  2004  tsunami  emphasized  the  fact
that  the  region  still  lacked  a  compre-
hensive  tsunami  warning  system. In
2010, however,
the  Indian  Ocean
Tsunami  Warning  and  Mitigation
System  became  fully  operational, with
its  network  of  deep-ocean  pressure
sensors, buoys, land seismographs, tidal
gauges, data  centers, and  communica-
tions  upgrades. With  this  new  warning
system  in  place  and  enhanced  public
education  about  what  to  do  in  the
event  of  a  tsunami, all  countries  bor-
dering  the  Indian  Ocean  will  be  much
better  prepared  for  the  destructive
power of future tsunami.

FIGURE 8D Jason-1 satellite detects the
Indian Ocean Tsunami. The Indian Ocean
Tsunami was initiated by a large earthquake off-
shore Sumatra on December 26, 2004 (red star).
By a fortuitous circumstance, the Jason-1 satellite
passed over the Indian Ocean (black line) two
hours after the tsunami was generated. Its radar
altimeter detected the crests and troughs of the
tsunami (colors), which showed a wave height of
about 1 meter (3.3 feet) in the open ocean. The
graph of the satellite s overpass (below) shows
the difference between the measured sea level
from satellite data (black line) and the modeled
wave height (blue curve).

When a tsunami is detected, warnings are sent to all the coastal regions that
might  encounter  the  destructive  wave, along  with  its  estimated  time  of  arrival.
This warning, usually just a few hours in advance of the tsunami, makes it possible
to evacuate people from low-lying areas and remove ships from harbors before
the waves arrive. If the disturbance is nearby, however, there is not enough time
to issue a warning because a tsunami travels so rapidly. Unlike hurricanes, whose
high winds and waves threaten ships at sea and send them to the protection of a
coastal harbor, a tsunami washes ships from their coastal moorings into the open
ocean or onto shore. The best strategy during a tsunami warning is to move ships
out of coastal harbors and into deep water, where tsunami are not easily felt.

EFFECTIVENESS OF TSUNAMI WARNINGS Since the PTWC was established in
1948, it  has  effectively  prevented  loss  of  life  due  to  tsunami  when  people  have
heeded  the  evacuation  warnings. Property  damage, however, has  increased  as
more  buildings  have  been  constructed  close  to  shore. To  combat  the  damage
caused by tsunami, countries that are especially prone to tsunami, such as Japan,
have invested in shoreline barriers, seawalls, and other coastal fortifications.

Can Power From Waves Be Harnessed as a Source of Energy?

Perhaps one of the best strategies to limit tsunami damage and loss of life is
to restrict construction projects in low-lying coastal regions where tsunami have
frequently  struck  in  the  past. However, the  long  time  interval  between  large
tsunami can lead people to forget past disasters.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Most tsunami are generated by underwater fault move-
ment, which transfers energy to the entire water col-
umn. When these fast and long waves surge ashore,
they can do considerable damage.

If there is a tsunami warning issued, what is the best thing to do?

Mw = 7.7

The smartest thing to do is to stay out of coastal areas, but people often
want to see the tsunami firsthand. For instance, when an earthquake of
magnitude 
occurred  offshore  of  Alaska  in  May  1986,  a
tsunami warning was issued for the West Coast of the United States. In
Southern California, people flocked to the beach to observe the phenome-
non. Fortunately, the tsunami was only a few centimeters high by the time
it reached Southern California, so it went unnoticed. Since 1982, in fact,
16 tsunami warnings have been issued for U.S. shores.

If  you must go  to  the  beach  to  observe  a  tsunami,  expect  crowds,
road  closings,  and  general  mayhem.  It  would  be  a  good  idea  to  stay  at
least 30 meters (100 feet) above sea level. If you happen to be at a remote
beach  where  the  water  suddenly  withdraws,  evacuate  immediately  to
higher ground (Figure 8.26). And, if you happen to be at a beach where
an  earthquake  occurs  and  shakes  the  ground  so  hard  that  you  can t
stand  up,  then  RUN don t  walk
for  high  ground  as  soon  as  you  can
stand up!

After the first surge of the tsunami, stay out of low-lying coastal areas
for several hours because several more surges (and withdrawals) can be
expected.  There  are  many  documented  cases  of  curious  people  being
killed when they were caught in the third or fourth (. . . or ninth) surge of
a tsunami.

8.7 Can Power From Waves Be

Harnessed as a Source 
of Energy?

Moving water has a huge amount of energy, which is why there are so many hy-
droelectric power plants on rivers. Even greater energy exists in ocean waves, but
significant problems must be overcome for the power to be harnessed efficiently.
For example, a serious obstacle to the use of any device to harness wave energy is
the  monumental  engineering  problem  of  preventing  the devices from  being  de-
stroyed by the wave force they are built to harness.

Another key disadvantage of wave energy is that the system produces signifi-
cant  power  only  when  large  storm  waves  break  against  it, so  the  system  could
serve only as a power supplement. In addition, a series of one hundred or more of
these structures along the shore would be required. Structures of this type could
have a significant impact on the environment, with negative effects on marine or-
ganisms that rely on wave energy for dispersal, transporting food supplies, or re-
moving  wastes. Also, harnessing  wave  energy  might  alter  the  transport  of  sand
along the coast, causing erosion in areas deprived of sediment.

Still, the  immense  power  contained  in  waves  could  be  used  for  generating
electricity. Offshore wave-generating plants would be able to tap into the higher
wave  energy  found  offshore, but  they  are  more  likely  to  be  damaged  in  large
waves  and  more  difficult  to  maintain. The  most  promising  locations  for  coastal

power plant. (b) Cutaway view of LIMPET 500,
showing how the power plant generates electricity.
As a wave advances into the power plant, it causes 
water to surge into the structure, forcing air out through 
a turbine. As the wave recedes, air is sucked back through 
the turbine. Electricity is generated as air moves both ways
past the turbine as waves advance and recede.

power generation from waves are where waves refract (bend) and converge, such
as at headlands, which tend to focus wave energy (see Figure 8.19b). Using this
advantage, an  array  of  wave  power  plants  might  extract  up  to  10  megawatts  of
power8 per 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) of shoreline.

Internal waves are a potential source of energy, too. Along shores that have
favorable sea floor shape for focusing wave energy, internal waves may be effec-
tively concentrated by refraction and thus could power an energy-conversion de-
vice that generates electricity.

Wave Power Plants and Wave Farms
In 2000, the world s first commercial wave power plant began generating electric-
ity. The small plant, called LIMPET 500 (Land Installed Marine Powered Energy
Transformer), is located on Islay, a small island off the west coast of Scotland. The
plant  was  constructed  at  a  cost  of  about  $1.6  million  and  allows  waves  to  com-
press air in a partially submerged chamber that, in turn, rotates a turbine for the
generation of power (Figure 8.27). As waves recede, air is sucked back into the
chamber  and  rotates  the  turbine  in  the  other  direction, which  also  generates
power. Under  peak  operating  capacity, the  facility  is  capable  of  producing
500 kilowatts  of  power, which  is  capable  of  supplying  the  energy  needs  of
about 400 average U.S. homes. Economic conditions in the future may lead to the
construction of larger wave plants that are capable of using this renewable source
of energy.

In 2008, Ocean Power Delivery completed the world s first wave farm off the
coast  of  northern  Portugal. This  project  uses  three  150-meter-  (500-foot-)  long
devices  that  resemble  giant  segmented  snakes  and  float  half-submerged  in  the
ocean (Figure 8.28). As each segment surges up or down with the crest of an on-
coming  wave, its  hydraulic  power  plant  pumps  a  biodegradable  hydraulic  fluid
through  a  turbine, thus  generating  electricity. These  wave-energy  devices  are
already supplying up to 2.25 megawatts of power to Portugal s electrical grid, with
25 more devices planned in the future.

Currently, about 50 wave-energy projects are in development at various sites
around the world. These projects use different methods to harness wave power,
including floats or submerged pistons that move up and down with each passing
wave, tethered paddles that oscillate back and forth, and collection of water from
breaking waves that overtops coastal structures and then using it to turn turbines
as it returns to the ocean.

8Each megawatt of electricity is enough to serve the energy needs of about 800 average U.S. homes.

FIGURE 8.28 Harnessing the power of ocean waves.
This wave energy device resembles a large segmented float-
ing snake and is designed to flex as waves pass, thus generat-
ing electricity. A wave farm of three of these devices is 
currently generating electricity off northern Portugal, with 
25 more planned.

Global Coastal Wave Energy Resources
Leading estimates suggest that the global resource for wave energy lies between 1
and 10 terawatts; the world currently produces about 12 terawatts from all sources.
Where  are  the  best  places  to  develop  additional  wave  power  plants  and  wave
farms?  Figure  8.29 shows  the  average  wave  height  experienced  along  coastal  re-
gions and indicates the sites most favorable for wave energy generation (red areas).
The  map  shows  that  west-to-east  movement  of  storm  systems  in  the  middle  lati-
tudes between 30 and 60 degrees north or south latitude causes the western coasts
of continents to be struck by larger waves than eastern coasts. Thus, more wave en-
ergy is generally available along western than eastern shores. Furthermore, some of
the largest waves (and greatest potential for wave power) are associated with the
prevailing westerly wind belt in the middle latitude Southern Hemisphere.

Ocean waves produce large amounts of energy.
Although significant problems exist in harnessing 
wave energy effectively, several types of devices are 
extracting wave energy today.

Chapter 8 Waves and Water Dynamics

Chapter in Review

All ocean waves begin as disturbances caused by releases of energy. The
releases of energy include wind, the movement of fluids of different densi-
ties (which create internal waves), mass movement into the ocean, under-
water sea floor movements, the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun
on Earth, and human activities in the ocean.

Once initiated, waves transmit energy through matter by setting up pat-
terns  of  oscillatory  motion in  the  particles  that  make  up  the  matter.
Progressive  waves  are  longitudinal, transverse, or  orbital, depending  on
the pattern of particle oscillation. Particles in ocean waves move primarily
in orbital paths.

Waves are described according to their wavelength (L), wave height (H),
wave steepness (H/L), wave period (T), frequency (f), and wave speed (S).
As a wave travels, the water passes the energy along by moving in a circle,
called circular orbital motion. This motion advances the waveform, not the
water  particles  themselves. Circular  orbital  motion  decreases  with  depth,
ceasing  entirely  at  wave  base, which  is  equal  to  one-half  the  wavelength
measured from still water level.

If  water  depth  is  greater  than  one-half  the  wavelength, a  progressive
wave travels as a deep-water wave with a speed that is directly proportional
20 wavelength (L/20), the wave
to wavelength. If water depth is less than  1
moves as a shallow-water wave with a speed that is directly proportional to
water depth. Transitional waves have wavelengths between deep- and shal-
low-water waves, with speeds that depend on both wavelength and water
depth.

As  wind-generated  waves  form  in  a  sea  area, capillary  waves with
rounded crests and wavelengths less than 1.74 centimeters (0.7 inch) form
first. As  the  energy  of  the  waves  increases, gravity  waves  form, with  in-
creased wave speed, wavelength, and wave height. Factors that influence
the size of wind-generated waves include wind speed, duration (time), and
fetch (distance). An  equilibrium  condition  called  a  fully  developed  sea is
reached when the maximum wave height is achieved for a particular wind
speed, duration, and fetch.

Energy  is  transmitted  from  the  sea  area  across  the  ocean  by  uniform,
symmetrical  waves  called  swell. Different  wave  trains  of  swell  can  create
either constructive, destructive, or mixed interference patterns. Constructive

interference  produces  unusually  large  waves  called  rogue  waves  or
superwaves.

As waves approach shoaling water near shore, they undergo many physi-
cal changes. Waves release their energy in the surf zone when their steep-
ness exceeds a 1:7 ratio and break. If waves break on a relatively flat sur-
face, they  produce  spilling  breakers. The  curling  crests  of  plunging
breakers, which are the best for surfing, form on steep slopes, and abrupt
beach slopes create surging breakers.

When  swell  approaches  the  shore, segments  of  the  waves  that  first
encounter shallow water are slowed whereas other segments of the wave in
deeper water move at their original speed, causing each wave to refract, or
bend. Refraction  concentrates  wave  energy  on  headlands, while  low-
energy breakers are characteristic of bays.

Reflection of waves off seawalls or other barriers can cause an interfer-
ence pattern called a standing wave. The crests of standing waves do not
move laterally as in progressive waves but alternate with troughs at antin-
odes. Between the antinodes are nodes, where there is no vertical move-
ment of the water.

Sudden changes in the elevation of the sea floor, such as from fault move-
ment  or  volcanic  eruptions, generate  tsunami, or  seismic  sea  waves. These
waves often have lengths exceeding 200 kilometers (125 miles) and travel
across the open ocean with undetectable heights of about 0.5 meter (1.6
feet) at speeds in excess of 700 kilometers (435 miles) per hour. Upon ap-
proaching  shore, a  tsunami  produces  a  series  of  rapid  withdrawals  and
surges, some  of  which  may  increase  the  height  of  sea  level  by  40  meters
(131  feet)  or  more. Most  tsunami  occur  in  the  Pacific  Ocean, where  they
have caused millions of dollars of coastal damage and taken tens of thou-
sands  of  lives. However, the  2004  Indian  Ocean  Tsunami  killed  nearly
300,000, making it the most deadly tsunami in history. The Pacific Tsunami
Warning  Center  (PTWC) has  dramatically  reduced  fatalities  by  success-
fully  predicting  tsunami  using  real-time  seismic  information  and  a  net-
work  of  deep-ocean  pressure  sensors. A  new  tsunami  warning  system  is
being installed in the Indian Ocean.

Ocean waves can be harnessed to produce hydroelectric power, but signif-
icant problems must be overcome to make this a practical source of energy.

(Philosophy of Natural Mathematical Principles) (1686)

TIDES

Tides are the periodic raising and lowering of sea level that occurs daily throughout the ocean. As
sea level rises and falls, the edge of the sea slowly shifts landward and seaward each day; as it rises, it
often destroys sand castles that were built during low tide. Knowledge of tides is important in many
coastal  activities, including  tide  pooling, shell  collecting, surfing, fishing, navigation, and  preparing
for storms. Tides are so important that accurate records have been kept at nearly every port for sev-
eral centuries and there are many examples of the term tide in everyday vocabulary (for instance, to
tide someone over,

to go against the tide, or to wish someone  good tidings ).

There is no doubt that early coastal peoples noticed the tides yet the earliest written record of
tides is in about 450 B.C. Even the earliest sailors knew the Moon had some connection with the tides
because both followed a similar pattern. For example, high tides were associated with either a full or
new moon. However, it wasn t until Isaac Newton (1642 1727) developed the universal law of gravi-
tation that the tides could adequately be explained.

Although the study of the tides can be complex, tides are fundamentally very long and regular
shallow-water  waves. As  we  shall  see, their  wavelengths  are  measured  in  thousands  of  kilometers
and their heights range to more than 15 meters (50 feet).

9.1 What Causes the Tides?
Simplistically, the gravitational attraction of the Sun and Moon on Earth creates ocean tides. In  a
more complete analysis, tides are generated by forces imposed on Earth that are caused by a combi-
nation of gravity and motion among Earth, the Moon, and the Sun.

Tide-Generating Forces
Newton s work on quantifying the forces involved in the Earth Moon Sun system led to the first un-
derstanding of the underlying forces that keep bodies in orbit around each other. It is well known
that gravity is the force that interconnects the Sun, its planets, and their moons and keeps them in
relatively fixed orbits. For example, most of us are taught that  the Moon orbits Earth, but it is not
quite  that  simple. The  two  bodies  actually  rotate  around  a  common  center  of  mass  called  the
barycenter (barus
center), which is the balance point of the system, located 1600
kilometers (1000 miles) beneath Earth s surface (Figure 9.1a). Why isn t the barycenter halfway in
between the two bodies? It s because Earth s mass is so much greater than that of the Moon. This
can be visualized by imagining Earth and its Moon as ends of an object that is much heavier on one
end  than  the  other. A  good  example  of  this  is  a  sledgehammer, which  has  a  lighter  handle  and  a
much  heavier  head, with  its  balance  point  within  the  head  of  the  hammer. Now  imagine  that  the

the  situation  that  describes  the  movement  of  the
Earth Moon system. The purple arrow in Figure 9.1a
shows the smooth, nearly circular path of the Earth
Moon barycenter around the Sun.

If  the  Moon  and  Earth  are  attracted  to  one  an-
other, why  don t  the  two  collide?  Moreover, the
Earth Moon system is involved in a mutual orbit held
together  by  gravity  and  motion, which  prevents  the
Moon and Earth from colliding. This is how orbits are
established  that  keep  objects  at  more  or  less  fixed
distances.

Newton s work also allowed an understanding of
why  the  tides  behave  as  they  do. Just  as  gravity  and
motion  serve  to  keep  bodies  in  mutual  orbits, they
also exert an influence on every particle of water on
Earth, thus creating the tides.

GRAVITATIONAL  AND  CENTRIPETAL  FORCES  IN
THE  EARTH MOON  SYSTEM To  understand  how

examine  how  gravitational  forces and  centripetal
forces affect objects on Earth within the Earth Moon
system. (We ll ignore the influence of the Sun for the
moment.)

influence  the  oceans,

The gravitational force is derived from Newton s
law  of  universal  gravitation, which  states  that  every
object  that  has  mass  in  the  universe  is  attracted  to
every other object. An object can be as small as an in-
dividual atomic particle or as large as a sun. The basic
equation for this relationship is:

Fg =

Gm1m2

r2

(9.1)

FIGURE 9.1 Earth Moon system rotation. (a) The 
center of mass (barycenter) of the Earth Moon system 
moves in a nearly circular orbit around the Sun. (b) If a 
ball with a string attached is swung overhead, it stays in 
a circular orbit because the string exerts a centripetal 
(center-seeking) force on the ball. If the string breaks,
the ball will fly off along a straight path along a tangent 
to the circle.

What  this equation  states  is  that  the  gravitational  force  (

Let s simplify Newton s law of universal gravitation and examine the effect
of both mass and distance on the gravitational force, which can be expressed with
arrows (up arrow * increase, down arrow * decrease):

If mass increases (c ), then gravitational force increases (c ).

A practical example of this can be seen in an object with a large mass (such as the
Sun), which produces a large gravitational attraction (Figure 9.2a).

Looking at how distance influences gravitational force, the relationship is:

If distance increases (c ), then gravitational force greatly decreases (T T ).

Equation 9.1 shows that the gravitational attraction varies with the square of dis-
tance, so even a small increase in the distance between two objects significantly
decreases the gravitational force between them, hence the double arrows in the
distance relationship illustrated above. What this means is that when an object is
twice as far away, the gravitational attraction is only one-quarter as strong. As a
practical example, this is why astronauts experience weightlessness in space when

they  get  far  enough  from  Earth s  gravitational  pull  (Figure  9.2b). In  summary,
then, the greater the mass of the objects and (especially) the closer they are to-
gether, the greater their gravitational attraction.

Figure 9.3 shows how gravitational forces for points on Earth (caused by the
Moon) vary  depending  on  their  distances  from  the Moon. The greatest  gravita-
tional attraction (the longest arrow) is at Z, the zenith (zenith * a path over the
head), which  is  the  point  closest  to  the  Moon. The  gravitational  attraction  is
weakest at N, the nadir (nadir * opposite the zenith), which is the point farthest
from the Moon. The direction of the gravitational attraction between most particles
and the center of the Moon is at an angle relative to a line connecting the center
of Earth and the Moon (Figure 9.3). This angle causes the force of gravitational
attraction between each particle and the Moon to be slightly different.

The  centripetal (centri * the  center, pet * seeking)  force1 required  to  keep
planets in their orbits is provided by the gravitational attraction between each of
them and the Sun. Centripetal force connects an orbiting body to its parent, pulling
the object inward toward the parent, seeking the center of its orbit. For example,
if you tie a string to a ball and swing the ball around your head (Figure 9.1b), the
string  pulls  the  ball  toward  your  hand. The  string  exerts  a  centripetal  force on
the ball, forcing the ball to seek the center of its orbit. If the string should break, the
force is gone and the ball can no longer maintain its circular orbit. The ball flies off
in a straight line,2 tangent (tangent * touching) to the circle (Figure 9.1b).

The  Earth  and  Moon  are  interconnected, too, not  by  strings  but  by  gravity.
Gravity  provides  the  centripetal  force  that  holds  the  Moon  in  its  orbit  around
Earth. If all gravity in the solar system could be shut off, centripetal force would
vanish, and the momentum of the celestial bodies would send them flying off into
space along straight-line paths, tangent to their orbits.

RESULTANT  FORCES Particles of identical mass rotate in identical-sized paths
due  to  the  Earth Moon  rotation  system  (Figure  9.4). Each  particle  requires  an
identical  centripetal  force  to  maintain  it  in  its  circular  path. Gravitational

Are there also tides in other objects, such as lakes
and swimming pools?

The  Moon  and  the  Sun  act  on  all  objects  that  have
the  ability  to  flow,  so  there  are  tides  in  lakes,  wells,
and swimming pools. In fact, there are even extremely
tiny  tidal  bulges  in  a  glass  of  water!  However,  the
tides  in  the  atmosphere  and  the  solid   Earth  have
greater significance. Tides in the atmosphere called
atmospheric tides can  be  miles  high  and  are  also 
affected  by  solar  heating.  The  tides  inside  Earth s 
interior called  solid-body  tides,  or  Earth  tides
cause  a  slight  but  measurable  stretching  of  Earth s
crust, typically only a few centimeters high, that has
recently  been  linked  as  a  trigger  mechanism  for
tremors along certain weak faults.

attraction between the particle and the Moon supplies the centripetal force, but
the  supplied force  is  different  than  the  required force  (because  gravitational
attraction varies with distance from the Moon) except at the center of Earth. This
difference  creates  tiny  resultant  forces, which  are  the  mathematical  difference
between the two sets of arrows shown in Figures 9.3 and 9.4.

Figure 9.5 combines Figures 9.3 and Figure 9.4 to show that resultant forces
are produced by the difference between the required centripetal (C) and supplied
gravitational (G) forces. However, do not think that both of these forces are being
applied to the points, because (C) is a force that would be required to keep the
particles in a perfectly circular path, while (G) is the force actually provided for
this purpose by gravitational attraction between the particles and the Moon. The
resultant forces (blue arrows) are established by constructing an arrow from the
tip  of  the  centripetal  (red)  arrow  to  the  tip  of  the  gravity  (black)  arrow  and
located where the red and black arrows begin.

TIDE-GENERATING  FORCES Resultant  forces  are  small, averaging  about  one-
millionth  the  magnitude  of  Earth s  gravity. If  the  resultant  force  is  vertical  to
Earth s  surface, as  it  is  at  the  zenith  and  nadir  (oriented  upward)  and  along  an
equator connecting all points halfway between the zenith and nadir (oriented
downward), it has no tide-generating effect (Figure 9.6). However, if the resultant
force  has  a  significant  horizontal  component
that  is, tangential  to  Earth s
surface it produces tidal bulges on Earth, creating what are known as the tide-
generating  forces. These  tide-generating  forces  are  quite  small  but  reach  their

maximum value at points on Earth s surface at a  latitude

of  45  degrees  relative  to  the  equator between  the

zenith and nadir (Figure 9.6).

As  previously  discussed, gravitational  attraction
is  inversely  proportional  to  the  square of  the  dis-
tance  between  two  masses. The  tide-generating
force, however, is inversely proportional to the cube
of the distance between each point on Earth and the
center of  the  tide-generating  body  (Moon  or  Sun).
Although  the  tide-generating  force  is  derived  from  the
gravitational  force, it  is  not  linearly  proportional  to  it. As  a
result, distance  is  a  more  highly  weighted  variable  for  tide-
generating forces.

Moon

The tide-generating forces push water into two simultane-
ous bulges: one on the side of Earth directed toward the Moon
(the zenith) and the other on the side directed away from the
Moon (the nadir) (Figure 9.7). On the side directly facing the
Moon, the bulge is created because the provided gravitational
force is greater than the required centripetal force. Conversely, on the side facing
away from the Moon, the bulge is created because the required centripetal force
is greater than the provided gravitational force. Although the forces are oriented
in opposite directions on the two sides of Earth, the resultant forces are equal in
magnitude, so the bulges are equal, too.

Gravitational attraction of moon

K E Y   C O N C E P T
The tides are caused by an imbalance between the
required centripetal and the provided gravitational
forces acting on Earth. This difference produces
residual forces, the horizontal component of 
which pushes ocean water into two equal tidal
bulges on opposite sides of Earth.

Tidal Bulges: The Moon s Effect
It is easier to understand how tides on Earth are created if we consider an ideal
Earth  and  an  ideal  ocean. The  ideal  Earth  has  two  tidal  bulges, one  toward  the
Moon and one away from the Moon (called the lunar bulges), as shown in Figure
9.7. The ideal ocean has a uniform depth, with no friction between the seawater
and the sea floor. Newton made these same simplifications when he first explained
Earth s tides.

If the Moon is stationary and aligned with the ideal Earth s

equator, the  maximum  bulge  will  occur  on  the  equator  on 
opposite sides of Earth. If you were standing on the equa-
tor, you  would  experience  two  high  tides  each  day. The
time between high tides, which is the tidal period, would
be 12 hours. If you moved to any latitude north or south
of  the  equator, you  would  experience  the  same  tidal
period, but the high tides would be less high, because
you would be at a lower point on the bulge.

N

that  is, directly  overhead to

In most places on Earth, however, high tides occur
every 12 hours 25 minutes because tides depend on the
lunar day, not the solar day. The lunar day (also called a
tidal  day)  is  measured  from  the  time  the  Moon  is  on  the
meridian  of  an  observer
the next  time  the  Moon  is  on  that  meridian  and  is  24  hours
50 minutes.3 The solar day is measured from the time the Sun is on
the meridian of an observer to the next time the Sun is on that meridian and is
24 hours. Why is the lunar day 50 minutes longer than the solar day? During the
24 hours it takes Earth to make a full rotation, the Moon has continued moving
another 12.2 degrees to the east in its orbit around Earth (Figure 9.8). Thus, Earth
must rotate an additional 50 minutes to  catch up to the Moon so that the Moon
is again on the meridian (directly overhead) of our observer.

The difference between a solar day and a lunar day can be seen in some of
the  natural  phenomena  related  to  the  tides. For  example, alternating  high  tides
are normally 50 minutes later each successive day and the Moon rises 50 minutes
later each successive night.

Tidal Bulges: The Sun s Effect
The Sun affects the tides, too. Like the Moon, the Sun produces tidal bulges on
opposite  sides  of  Earth, one  oriented  toward the  Sun  and  one  oriented  away
from the  Sun. These  solar  bulges, however, are  much  smaller  than  the  lunar
bulges. Although  the Sun  is  27 million  times more massive  than the  Moon, its
tide-generating  force  is  not  27  million  times  greater  than  the  Moon s. This  is
because  the  Sun  is  390  times  farther  from  Earth  than  the  Moon  (Figure  9.9).
Moreover, tide-generating  forces  vary  inversely  as  the  cube of  the  distance
between objects. Thus, the tide-generating force is reduced by the cube of 390,
or  about  59  million  times  compared  with  that  of  the  Moon. These  conditions
result  in  the  Sun s  tide-generating  force  being 27
59 that  of  the  Moon, or  46%
(about  one-half). Consequently, the  solar  bulges  are  only  46%  the  size  of  the
lunar bulges and, as a result, the Moon exerts over two times the gravitational
pull of the Sun on the tides.

Even though the Moon exerts over two times the gravitational pull of the
Sun on Earth s tides, note that the Sun does not exert a smaller gravitational
force on Earth as compared to the Moon. In fact, the Sun s total  pull on all
points  on  Earth  is  much  greater  than  that  of  the  Moon s, but  the  difference
across Earth is small because the diameter of Earth is very small in relation to
the  distance  from  the  Sun. In  contrast, the  diameter  of  Earth  is  quite  large
in relation to the distance to the center of the Moon. In summary, the reason
why  the  Moon  controls  tides  far  more  than  the  Sun  is  because  the  Moon  is
much closer to Earth, although it is much smaller in size and mass as compared
to the Sun.

3A lunar day is exactly 24 hours, 50 minutes, 28 seconds long.

elapses between when the Moon is directly overhead and 
the next time the Moon is directly overhead. During one
complete rotation of Earth (the 24-hour solar day), the 
Moon moves eastward 12.2 degrees, and Earth must rotate 
an additional 50 minutes for the Moon to be in the exact
same position overhead. Thus, a lunar day is 24 hours 
50 minutes long.

Earth s Rotation and the Tides
The  tides  appear  to  move  water  in  toward  shore  (the  flood  tide)  and  to  move
water  away from  shore (the  ebb  tide). However, according to the  nature  of  the
idealized tides presented so far, Earth s rotation carries various locations into and
out of the tidal bulges, which are in fixed positions relative to the Moon and the
Sun. In essence, alternating high and low tides are created as
Earth  constantly  rotates  inside  fluid  bulges  that  are  sup-
ported by the Moon and the Sun.

The lunar bulges are about twice the size of the
solar bulges. In an idealized case, the rise and fall of
the tides are caused by Earth s rotation carrying var-
ious locations into and out of the tidal bulges.

The Monthly Tidal Cycle
During  the  monthly  tidal  cycle, the  phase  of  the  Moon
changes dramatically. When the Moon is between Earth and
the  Sun, it  cannot  be  seen  at  night; this  phase  is  called  new
moon. When the Moon is on the side of Earth opposite the Sun, its entire disk is
brightly visible; this phase is called full moon. A quarter moon a moon that is
half lit and half dark as viewed from Earth occurs when the Moon is at right an-
gles to the Sun relative to Earth.

Figure 9.10 shows the positions of the Earth, Moon, and Sun at various points
during the 291
2-day lunar cycle. When the Sun and Moon are aligned, either with
the Moon between Earth and the Sun (new moon; Moon in conjunction) or with
the Moon on the side opposite the Sun (full moon; Moon in opposition), the tide-
generating forces of the Sun and Moon combine (Figure 9.10, top). At this time,
the tidal range (the vertical difference between high and low tides) is large (very
high high tides and quite low low tides) because there is constructive interference5
between  the  lunar  and  solar  tidal  bulges. The  maximum  tidal  range  is  called

2-day monthly tidal cycle is also called a lunar cycle, a lunar month, or a synodic (synod *

5As mentioned in Chapter 8, constructive interference occurs when two waves (or, in this case, two
tidal bulges) overlap crest to crest and trough to trough.

a spring  (springen * to  rise  up) tide,6 because  the  tide  is  extremely  large  or
springs forth. When the Earth Moon Sun system is aligned, the Moon is said to
be in syzygy (syzygia * union).

When  the  Moon  is  in  either  the  first-  or  third-quarter7 phase  (Figure  9.10,
bottom), the tide-generating force of the Sun is working at right angles to the tide-
generating force of the Moon. The tidal range is small (lower high tides and higher
low tides) because there is destructive interference8 between the lunar and solar
tidal bulges. This is called a neap (nep * scarcely or barely touching) tide,9 and
the Moon is said to be in quadrature (quadra * four).

The time between successive spring tides (full moon and new moon) or neap
tides (first quarter and third quarter) is one-half the monthly lunar cycle, which is
about  two  weeks. The  time  between  a  spring  tide  and  a  successive  neap  tide  is
one-quarter the monthly lunar cycle, which is about one week.

FIGURE 9.10 Earth Moon Sun positions and the tides.
Top: When the Moon is in the new or full position, the tidal
bulges created by the Sun and Moon are aligned, there is a
large tidal range on Earth, and spring tides are experienced.
Bottom: When the Moon is in the first- or third-quarter posi-
tion, the tidal bulges produced by the Moon are at right an-
gles to the bulges created by the Sun. Tidal ranges are smaller
and neap tides are experienced. Note that there is only one
moon in orbit around Earth.

Monthly Tidal Cycle

6Spring tides have no connection with the spring season; they occur twice a month during the time
when the Earth Moon Sun system is aligned.
7The third-quarter moon is often called the last-quarter moon, which is not to be confused with cer-
tain sports that have a fourth quarter.
8Destructive interference occurs when two waves (or, in this case, two tidal bulges) match up crest to
trough and trough to crest.

What would Earth be like if the Moon didnt exist?

For starters, Earth would spin faster, and days would be much shorter be-
cause the tidal forces that act as slow brakes on Earth s rotation wouldn t
exist. In fact, geologists have evidence that an Earth day was originally five
or six hours long in the distant geologic past; it might be just a little longer
than that today if the Moon didn t exist. In the ocean, the tidal range would
be much smaller because only the Sun would produce relatively small tidal
bulges.  Spring  tides  would  not  exist,  and  coastal  erosion  would  be
markedly reduced. There would be no moonlight, and nighttime would be
much  darker,  which  would  affect  nearly  all  life  on  Earth.  There  is  even
some speculation that life would not exist at all on Earth without the stabi-
lizing effect of the Moon.

Figure  9.11 shows  the  pattern  that  the  Moon  experiences
as it moves through its monthly cycle. As the Moon progresses
from  new  moon  to  first-quarter  phase, the  Moon  is  a  waxing
crescent (waxen * to increase; crescere * to grow). In between
the  first-quarter  and  full  moon  phase, the  Moon  is  a  waxing
gibbous (gibbus * hump). Between the Moon s full and third-
quarter  phase, it  is  a  waning  gibbous (wanen * to  decrease).
And, in  between  the  third-quarter  and  new  moon  phase, the
Moon is a waning crescent. The Moon has identical periods of
rotation  on  its  axis  and  revolution  around  Earth  (a  property
called synchronous rotation). As a result, the same side of the
Moon always faces Earth.

Complicating Factors
Besides Earth s rotation and the relative positions of the Moon
and the Sun, there are many other factors that influence tides on
Earth. Two of the most prominent of these factors are the decli-
nation of the Moon and Sun and the elliptical shapes of Earth s
and the Moon s orbits. Let s examine both of these factors.

FIGURE 9.11 Phases of the Moon. As the Moon moves
2-day lunar cycle, its phase changes
around Earth during its 291
depending on its position relative to the Sun and Earth. During
a new moon, the dark side of the Moon faces Earth while dur-
ing a full moon, the lit side of the Moon faces Earth. Moon
phases are shown diagrammatically as seen from Earth.

DECLINATION OF THE MOON AND SUN Up to this point, we
have  assumed  that  the  Moon  and  Sun  have  remained  directly  overhead  at  the
equator, but this is not usually the case. Most of the year, in fact, they are either
north or south of the equator. The angular distance of the Sun or Moon above or
below Earth s equatorial plane is called declination (declinare * to turn away).

Earth revolves around the Sun along an invisible ellipse in space. The imagi-
nary  plane  that  contains  this  ellipse  is  called  the  ecliptic (ekleipein * to  fail  to
appear). Recall from Chapter 6 that Earth s axis of rotation is tilted 23.5 degrees
with respect to the ecliptic and that this tilt causes Earth s seasons. It also means
the maximum declination of the Sun relative to Earth s equator is 23.5 degrees.

To  complicate  matters  further, the  plane  of  the  Moon s  orbit  is  tilted  5  de-
grees with respect to the ecliptic. Thus, the maximum declination of the Moon s
orbit relative to Earth s equator is 28.5 degrees (5 degrees plus the 23.5 degrees of
Earth s  tilt). The  declination  changes  from  28.5  degrees  south  to  28.5  degrees
north and back to 28.5 degrees south of the equator during the multiple lunar cy-
cles within one year. As a result, tidal bulges are rarely aligned with the equator.
Instead, they  occur  mostly  north  and  south  of  the  equator. The  Moon  affects

FIGURE 9.12 Maximum declination of tidal bulges from the equator. The center
of the tidal bulges may lie at any latitude from the equator to a maximum of 28.5 degrees
on either side of the equator, depending on the season of the year (solar angle) and the
Moon s position.

Earth s tides more than the Sun, so tidal bulges follow the Moon, ranging from a
maximum of 28.5 degrees north to a maximum of 28.5 degrees south of the equa-
tor (Figure 9.12).

EFFECTS OF ELLIPTICAL ORBITS Earth revolves around the Sun in an elliptical
orbit (Figure 9.13) such that Earth is 148.5 million kilometers (92.2 million miles)
from the Sun during the Northern Hemisphere winter and 152.2 million kilometers
(94.5 million miles) from the Sun during summer. Thus, the distance between Earth
and the Sun varies by 2.5% over the course of a year. Tidal ranges are largest when
Earth  is  near  its  closest  point, called  perihelion (peri * near, helios * Sun)  and
smallest  near  its  most  distant  point, called  aphelion (apo * away  from, helios *
Sun). Thus, the greatest tidal ranges typically occur in January each year.

Apogee

The Moon revolves around Earth in an elliptical orbit, too. The Earth Moon
distance varies by 8%  (between 375,000 kilometers [233,000 miles] and 405,800
kilometers  [252,000  miles]). Tidal  ranges
are  largest  when  the  Moon  is  closest  to
Earth, called  perigee (peri * near, geo *
Earth), and  smallest  when  most  distant,
called  apogee (apo * away  from, geo *
Earth) (Figure 9.13, top). The Moon cycles
between  perigee, apogee, and  back  to
2 days. Spring  tides  happen
perigee  every  271
to coincide with perigee about every one and
a  half  years, producing  proxigean (proximus
* nearest, geo * Earth)  or  closest  of  the
close moon tides. During this time, the tidal
range  is  especially  large  and  often  results  in
the  flooding  of  low-lying  coastal  areas; if  a
storm  occurs  simultaneously, damage  can  be
extreme. In 1962, for example, a winter storm
that occurred at the same time as a proxigean
tide caused widespread damage along the entire
U.S. East Coast.

Ive heard of a blue moon. Is the Moon really blue
then?

No.  Once in a blue moon  is a phrase that has gained
popularity  and  is  synonymous  with  a  rather  infrequent
occurrence.  A  blue  moon  is  the  second  full  moon  of
any calendar month, which occurs when the 291
2-day
lunar cycle falls entirely within a 30- or 31-day month.
Because  the  divisions  between  our  calendar  months
were determined arbitrarily, a blue moon has no special
significance aside from the fact that it occurs only once
every 2.72 years (about 33 months). At that rate, it s
certainly less common than a month of Sundays!

The  origin  of  the  term blue moon is  not  exactly

known, but it probably has nothing to do with color
although  large  forest  fires  or  volcanic  eruptions  can
put enough soot and ash particles in the atmosphere
to cause the Moon to appear blue. One likely explana-
tion involves the Old English word belewe, meaning  to
betray.  Thus, the Moon is belewe because it betrays
the  usual  perception  of  one  full  moon  per  month.
Another explanation links the term to a 1946 article
in Sky and Telescope that tried to correct a misinter-
pretation of the term blue moon, but the article itself
was misinterpreted to mean the second full moon in a
given month. Apparently, the erroneous interpretation
was repeated so often that it eventually stuck.

the Sun, thus affecting Earth s tides. The net result is that spring tides have greater
ranges during the Northern Hemisphere winter than in the summer, and spring
tides have greater ranges when they coincide with perigee.

Idealized Tide Prediction
The declination of the Moon determines the position of the tidal bulges. The ex-
ample illustrated in Figure 9.14 shows that the Moon is directly overhead at 28
degrees  north  latitude  when  its  declination  is  28  degrees  north  of  the  equator.
Imagine standing at 28 degrees north latitude and experiencing tidal conditions
during a day, which is the sequence shown in Figure 9.14a-d:

What are tropical tides?
Differences between successive high tides and succes-
sive low tides occur each lunar day (see, for example,
Figure 9.14e). Because these differences occur within
a  period  of  one  day,  they  are  called  diurnal (daily)
inequalities.  These  inequalities  are  at  their  greatest
when  the  Moon  is  at  its  maximum  declination,  and
such tides are called tropical tides because the Moon
is over one of Earth s tropics. When the Moon is over
the equator (equatorial tides), the difference between
successive high tides and low tides is minimal.

With the Moon directly overhead, the tidal conditions experienced will be
high tide (Figure 9.14a).
Low tide occurs 6 lunar hours later (6 hours 121
(Figure 9.14b).
Another high tide, but one much lower than the first, occurs 6 lunar hours
later (Figure 9.14c).
Another low tide occurs 6 lunar hours later (Figure 9.14d).
Six lunar hours later, at the end of a 24-lunar-hour period (24 hours 50 min-
utes solar time), you will have passed through a complete lunar-day cycle of
two high tides and two low tides (returns to Figure 9.14a).

How often are conditions right to produce the maxi-
mum tide-generating force?

Maximum tides occur when Earth is closest to the Sun
(at perihelion), the Moon is closest to Earth (at perigee),
and  the  Earth Moon-Sun  system  is  aligned  (at  syzygy)
with  both  the  Sun  and  Moon  at  zero  declination.  This
rare  condition which  creates  an  absolute  maximum
spring  tidal  range occurs  once  every  1600  years.
Fortunately,  the  next  occurrence  is  predicted  for  the
year 3300.

However,  there  are  other  times  when  conditions
produce  large  tide-generating  forces.  During  early
1983,  for  example,  large,  slow-moving  low-pressure
cells developed in the North Pacific Ocean that caused
strong northwest winds. In late January, the winds pro-
duced  a  near  fully  developed  3-meter  (10-foot)  swell
that  affected  the  West  Coast  from  Oregon  to  Baja
California.  The  large  waves  would  have  been  trouble
enough under normal conditions, but there were also
unusually  high  spring  tides  of  2.25  meters  (7.4  feet)
because  Earth  was  near  perihelion  at  the  same  time
that  the  Moon  was  at  perigee.  In  addition,  a  strong 
El Niño had raised sea level by as much as 20 centime-
ters (8 inches). When the waves hit the coast during
these  unusual  conditions,  they  caused  more  than
$100  million  in  damage,  including  the  destruction  of
25  homes,  damage  to  3500  others,  the  collapse
of several commercial and municipal piers, and at least
a dozen deaths.

highs and lows, but the higher high tides and lower low tides occur 12 hours later.
The reason that they occur out of phase by 12 hours is because the bulges in the
two  hemispheres  are  on  opposite  sides  of  Earth  in  relation  to  the  Moon. Web
Table 9.1 summarizes the characteristics of the tides on the idealized Earth.

9.3 What Do Tides Really Look Like in

the Ocean?

If tidal bulges are wave crests separated by a distance of one-half Earth s circum-
ference
about 20,000 kilometers (12,420 miles) one would expect the bulges to
move  across  Earth  at  about  1600  kilometers  (1000  miles)  per  hour. Tides, how-
ever, are an extreme  example of  shallow-water waves, so their  speed is propor-
tional to the water depth. For a tide wave to travel at 1600 kilometers (1000 miles)
per hour, the ocean would have to be 22 kilometers (13.7 miles) deep! Instead,
the average depth of the ocean is only 3.7 kilometers (2.3 miles), so tidal bulges
move as shallow-water waves, with their speed determined by ocean depth.

Based on the average ocean depth, the average speed at which tide waves can
travel  across  the  open  ocean  is  only  about  700  kilometers  (435  miles)  per  hour.
Thus, the idealized bulges that are oriented toward and away from a tide-generat-
ing  body  cannot  exist because  they  cannot  keep  up  with  the rotational  speed of
Earth. Instead, ocean tides break up into distinct large circulation units called cells.

Amphidromic Points and Cotidal Lines
In  the  open  ocean, the  crests  and  troughs  of  the  tide  wave  rotate  around  an
amphidromic (amphi * around, dromus * running) point near the center of each
cell. There is essentially no tidal range at amphidromic points, but radiating from
each  point  are  cotidal  (co * with, tidal * tide) lines, which  connect  all  nearby
locations where high tide occurs simultaneously. The labels on the cotidal lines in
Figure 9.15 indicate the time of high tide in hours as they rotate around the cell.

The times in Figure 9.15 indicate that the tide wave rotates counterclockwise
in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  and  clockwise  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere. The
wave must complete one rotation during the tidal period (usually 12 lunar hours),
so this limits the size of the cells.

Low tide occurs 6 hours after high tide in an amphidromic cell. If high tide is
for example, then low tide is occur-

occurring along the cotidal line labeled  10,
ring along the cotidal line labeled  4.

Effect of the Continents
The continents affect tides, too, because they interrupt the free movement of the
tidal bulges across the ocean surface. Tides are expressed in each ocean basin as
free-standing waves that are affected by the position and shape of the continents
that ring the ocean basin. In fact, two of the most important factors that influence
tidal conditions along a coast are coastline shape and offshore depth.

Just like surface waves that undergo physical changes as they move into shal-
low water (such as slowing down and increasing in height; see Chapter 8), tides
experience similar physical changes as they enter the shallow water of continental
shelves. These changes tend to amplify the tidal range as compared to the deep
ocean, where the maximum tidal range is only about 45 centimeters (18 inches).

In  addition, increased  turbulent  mixing  rates  in  deep  water  over  areas  of
rough bottom topography (as discussed in Chapter 7) are associated with internal
waves created by tides breaking on this rough topography and against continental
slopes. These  tide-generated  internal  waves  have  recently  been  observed  along

Tidal Patterns

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

I noticed that Figure 9.16 shows negative tides. How
can there ever be a negative tide?

Negative tides occur because the datum (starting point
or  reference  point  from  which  tides  are  measured) 
is  an  average  of  the  tides  over  many  years.  Along 
the West Coast of the United States, for instance, the
datum is mean lower low water (MLLW), which is the
average  of  the lower of  the  two  low  tides  that  occur
daily in a mixed tidal pattern. Because the datum is an
average, there will be some days when the tide is less
than  the  average  (similar  to  the  distribution  of  exam
scores,  some  of  which  will  be  below  the  average).
These lower-than-average tides are given negative val-
ues, occur only during spring tides, and are often the
best times to visit local tide pool areas.

the chain of Hawaiian Islands, have heights of up to 300 meters (1000 feet), and
contribute to increased turbulence and mixing, which strongly affect the tides.

Other Considerations
A detailed analysis of all the variables that affect the tides at any particular coast
reveals  that  nearly  400  factors  are  involved, which  are  far  more  than  can  ade-
quately be addressed here. The combination of all these factors creates some con-
ditions that are unexpected based on a simple tidal model. For example, high tide
rarely occurs when the Moon is at its highest point in the sky. Instead, the time
between  the  Moon  crossing  the  meridian  and  a  corresponding  high  tide  varies
from place to place.

Because of the complexity of the tides, a completely mathematical model of
the tides is beyond the limits of marine science. Instead, a combination of mathe-
matical  analysis  and  observation  is  required  to  adequately  model  the  tides.
Moreover, successful models must take into account at least 37 independent fac-
tors related to tides (the two most important are the Moon and the Sun) and are
usually quite successful in predicting future tides.

9.4 What Types of Tidal 

Patterns Exist?

In theory, most areas on Earth should experience two high tides and two low tides
of unequal heights during a lunar day. In practice, however, the various depths, sizes,
and shapes of ocean basins modify tides so they exhibit three different patterns in
different  parts  of  the  world. The  three  tidal  patterns, which  are  illustrated  in

Diurnal Tidal Pattern
A diurnal tidal pattern has one high tide and one low tide each lunar day. These
tides are common in shallow inland seas such as the Gulf of Mexico and along the
coast of Southeast Asia. Diurnal tides have a tidal period of 24 hours 50 minutes.

10Sometimes a mixed tidal pattern is referred to as mixed semidiurnal.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
A diurnal tidal pattern exhibits one high and one
low tide each lunar day; a semidiurnal tidal pattern
exhibits two high and two low tides daily of about
the same height; a mixed tidal pattern usually has
two high and two low tides of different heights daily
but may also exhibit diurnal characteristics.

Why dont all areas of the world experience the
same type of tidal pattern?

If the Earth were a perfect sphere without large conti-
nents,  all  areas  on  the  planet  would  experience  two
equally proportioned high and low tides every lunar day
(a  semidiurnal  tidal  pattern).  The  large  continents  on
the  planet,  however,  block  the  westward  passage  of
the tidal bulges as the Earth rotates. Unable to move
freely  around  the  globe,  the  tides  instead  establish
complex  patterns  within  each  ocean  basin  that  often
differ  greatly  from  tidal  patterns  of  adjacent  ocean
basins or other regions of the same ocean basin.

Mixed Tidal Pattern
A mixed tidal pattern may have characteristics of both diurnal and semidi-
urnal tides. Successive high tides and/or low tides will have significantly dif-
ferent heights, a condition called diurnal inequality. Mixed tides commonly
have a tidal period of 12 hours 25 minutes, but they may also exhibit diurnal
periods. Mixed  tides  are  the  most  common  type  in  the  world, including
along the Pacific Coast of North America.

Figure 9.17 shows examples of monthly tidal curves for various coastal
locations. Even though a tide at any particular location follows a single tidal
pattern, it still may pass through stages of one or both of the other tidal pat-
terns. Typically, however, the tidal pattern for a location remains the same
throughout  the  year. Also, the  tidal  curves  in  Figure  9.17 clearly  show  the
weekly switching of the spring tide-neap tide cycle.

9.5 What Tidal Phenomena Occur 

in Coastal Regions?

Remember that the tides are fundamentally a wave. When tide waves enter
coastal  waters, they  are  subject  to  reflection  and  amplification  similar  to
what wind-generated waves experience. In certain locations, reflected wave
energy causes  water  to  slosh  around in  a  bay, producing  standing  waves.12
As  a  result, interesting  tidal  phenomena  are  sometimes  experienced  in
coastal waters.

Large lakes and coastal rivers experience tidal phenomena, too. In some
low-lying rivers, for instance, a tidal bore is produced by an incoming high
tide (Box 9.1). Further, the tides profoundly affect the behavior of certain
marine organisms (Box 9.2).

An Example of Tidal Extremes: The Bay of Fundy
The largest tidal range in the world is found in Nova Scotia s Bay of Fundy. With
a length of 258 kilometers (160 miles), the Bay of Fundy has a wide opening into
the Atlantic Ocean. At its northern end, however, it splits into two narrow basins,
Chignecto Bay and Minas Basin (Figure 9.18). The period of free oscillation in the
bay
the oscillation that occurs when a body is displaced and then released is
very  nearly  that  of  the  tidal  period. The  resulting  constructive  interference
along with the narrowing and shoaling of the bay to the north causes a buildup
of  tidal  energy  in  the  northern  end  of  the  bay. In  addition, the  bay  curves  to
the right, so the Coriolis effect in the Northern Hemisphere adds to the extreme
tidal range.

11Because tides are always growing higher or lower at any location due to the spring tide-neap 
tide sequence, successive high tides and successive low tides can never be exactly the same at any 
location.
12See Chapter 8 for a discussion of standing waves, including the terms node and antinode.

TIDAL BORES: BORING WAVES THESE ARE NOT!

A  tidal  bore (bore * crest  or  wave)  is  a
wall  of  water  that  moves  up  certain  low-
lying  rivers  due  to  an  incoming  tide.
Because it is a wave created by the tides,
it is a true tidal wave. When an incoming
tide rushes up a river, it develops a steep
forward  slope  because  the  flow  of  the
river  resists  the  advance  of  the  tide
(Figure  9A). This  creates  a  tidal  bore,
which may reach heights of 5 meters (16.4
feet) or more and move at speeds up to 24
kilometers (15 miles) per hour.

Conditions  necessary for the  develop-
ment  of  tidal  bores  include  (1)  a  large
spring  tidal  range  of  at  least  6  meters 
(20  feet); (2)  a  tidal  cycle  that  has  a  very
abrupt rise of the flood tide phase and an
elongated  ebb  tide  phase; (3)  a  low-lying
river with a persistent seaward current dur-
ing  the  time  when  an  incoming  high  tide
begins; (4) a progressive shallowing of the
sea floor as the basin progresses inland; and
(5) a progressive narrowing of the basin to-
ward  its  upper  reaches. Because  of  these
unique circumstances, only about 60 places
on Earth experience tidal bores.

Although  tidal  bores  do  not  com-
monly attain the size of waves in the surf
zone, tidal  bores  have  successfully  been
rafted, kayaked, and  even  surfed  (Figure
9B). They can give a surfer a very long ride
because the bore travels many kilometers
upriver. If you miss the bore, though, you
have  to  wait  about  half  a  day  before  the
next one comes along because the incom-
ing high tide occurs only twice a day.

The  Amazon  River  is  probably  the
longest  estuary  affected  by  oceanic  tides:
Tides can be measured as far as 800 kilome-
ters (500 miles) from the river s mouth, al-
though the effects are quite small at this dis-
tance. Tidal  bores  near  the  mouth  of  the
Amazon  River  can  reach  heights  up  to 
5  meters  (16.4  feet)  and  are  locally  called
the  name  means  mighty
pororocas
noise. Other rivers that have notable tidal
bores include the Qiantang River in China
(which  has  the  largest  tidal  bores  in  the
world, often  reaching  8  meters  [26  feet]
high);
in  New

the  Petitcodiac  River 

Brunswick, Canada; the  River  Seine  in
France; the  Trent  and  Severn  Rivers  in
England; and  Cook  Inlet  near Anchorage,
Alaska (where the largest tidal bore in the
United States can be found). Although the
Bay  of  Fundy  has  the  world s  largest  tidal
range, its tidal bore rarely exceeds 1 meter
(3.3 feet), mostly because the bay is so wide.

GRUNION: DOING WHAT COMES NATURALLY ON THE BEACH

From  March  through  September, shortly  after
the maximum spring tide has occurred, grunion
(Leuresthes  tenuis) come  ashore  along  sandy
beaches  of  Southern  California  and  Baja,
California, to bury their eggs. Grunion slender,
silvery  fish  up  to  15  centimeters  (6  inches)
long are the only marine fish in the world that
come  completely  out  of  water  to  spawn. The
name  grunion comes from the  Spanish  gruñón,
which  means  grunter and  refers  to  the  faint
noise they make during spawning.

A  mixed  tidal  pattern  occurs  along
Southern  California  and  Baja, California,
beaches. On most lunar days (24 hours and 50
minutes), there are two high and two low tides.
There is usually a significant difference in the
heights  of  the  two  high  tides  that  occur  each
day. During  the  summer  months, the  higher
high  tide  occurs  at  night. The  night  high  tide
becomes  higher  each  night  as  the  maximum
spring  tide  range  is  approached, causing  sand
to  be  eroded  from  the  beach  (Figure  9C,
graph). After the maximum spring tide has oc-
curred, the  night  high  tide  diminishes  each
night. As neap tide is approached, sand is de-
posited on the beach.

Grunion  spawn  only  after  each  night s
higher high tide has peaked on the three or four
nights following the night of the highest spring
high tide.This assures that their eggs will be cov-
ered  deeply  in  sand  deposited  by  the  receding
higher high tides each succeeding night. The fer-
tilized eggs buried in the sand are ready to hatch
nine days after spawning. By this time, another
spring tide is approaching, so the night high tide
is getting progressively higher each night again.
The beach sand is eroding again, too, which ex-
poses  the  eggs  to  the  waves  that  break  ever
higher on the beach. The eggs hatch about three
minutes  after  being  freed  in  the  water. Tests
done  in  laboratories  have  shown  that  the
grunion  eggs  will  not  hatch  until  agitated  in  a
manner  that  simulates  that  of  the  eroding
waves.

The spawning begins as the grunion come
ashore  immediately  following  an  appropriate
high  tide, and  it  may  last  from  one  to  three
hours. Spawning  usually  peaks  about  an  hour
after it starts and may last an additional 30 min-
utes  to  an  hour. Thousands  of  fish  may  be  on
the  beach  at  this  time. During  a  run, the  fe-
males, which  are  larger  than  the  males, move

Days

Grunion deposit eggs in beach sand 
during early stages of the ebb of higher 
high tides on the three or four days 
following maximum spring tidal range.

Flood tides erode sand and free
grunion eggs during higher high
tide as maximum spring tidal
range is approached.

Maximum spring

high  on  the  beach. If  no  males  are  near, a
female  may  return  to  the  water  without  de-
positing her eggs. In the presence of males, she
drills her tail into the semifluid sand until only
her  head  is  visible. The  female  continues  to
twist, depositing  her  eggs  5  to  7  centimeters
(2 to 3 inches) below the surface.

The  male  curls  around  the  female s  body
and  deposits  his  milt  against  it  (Figure  9C,
photo). The  milt  runs  down  the  body  of  the
female to fertilize the eggs. When the spawning
is completed, both fish return to the water with
the next wave.

Larger  females  are  capable  of  producing
up  to  3000  eggs  for  each  series  of  spawning
runs, which are separated by the two-week pe-
riod between spring tides. As soon as the eggs
are deposited, another group of eggs begins to
form  within  the  female. These  eggs  will  be
deposited  during  the  next  spring  tide  run.
Early in the season, only older fish spawn. By
May, however, even  the  one-year-old  females
are in spawning condition.

Young  grunion  grow  rapidly  and  are
about 12 centimeters (5 inches) long when they
are a year old and ready for their first spawn-
ing. They  usually  live  two  or  three  years, but
four-year-olds  have  been  recovered. The
age  of  a  grunion  can  be  determined  by  its
scales. After growing rapidly during the first
year, they  grow  very  slowly  thereafter.
There  is  no  growth  at  all  during  the  six-
month  spawning  season, which  causes
marks  to  form  on  each  scale  that  can  be
used to identify the grunion s age.

It  is  not  known  exactly  how  grunion
are able to time their spawning behavior so
precisely with the tides. Research suggests
that  grunion  are  somehow  able  to  sense
very small changes in hydrostatic pressure
caused by rising and falling sea level due to
changing  tides. Certainly, a  very  depend-
able  detection  mechanism  keeps 
the
grunion  accurately  informed  of  the  tidal
conditions, because  their  survival  depends
on a spawning behavior precisely tuned to
the tides.

FIGURE 9C The tidal cycle and spawning grunion. During
summer months and for 3 or 4 days after the highest spring tides
(graph), grunion deposit their eggs on sandy beaches (photo). The
successively lower high tides during the approaching neap tide condi-
tions won t wash the eggs from the sand until they are ready to hatch
about 10 days later. As the next spring tide is approached, successively
higher high tides wash the eggs free and allow them to hatch. The
spawning cycle begins a few days later after the peak of spring tide
conditions with the next cycle of successively lower high tides.

During maximum spring tide conditions, the tidal range at the mouth of the
bay (where it opens to the ocean) is only about 2 meters (6.6 feet). However, the
tidal  range  increases  progressively  from  the  mouth  of  the  bay  northward. In
the northern  end  of  Minas  Basin, the  maximum  spring  tidal  range  is  17  meters
(56 feet), which leaves boats high and dry during low tide (Figure 9.18, insets).

Coastal Tidal Currents
The  current  that  accompanies  the  slowly  turning  tide  crest  in  a  Northern
Hemisphere  basin  rotates  counterclockwise, producing  a  rotary  current in  the
open portion of the basin. Friction increases in nearshore shoaling waters, so the
rotary current changes to an alternating or reversing current that moves into and
out of restricted passages along a coast.

The velocity of rotary currents in the open ocean is usually well below 1 kilo-
meter (0.6 mile) per hour. Reversing currents, however, can reach velocities up to
44 kilometers (28 miles) per hour in restricted channels such as between islands
of coastal waters.

Reversing currents also exist in the mouths of bays (and some rivers) due to the
daily  flow  of  tides. Figure  9.19 shows  that  a  flood  current is  produced  when  water
rushes into a bay (or river) with an incoming high tide. Conversely, an ebb current is
produced when water drains out of a bay (or river) because a low tide is approaching.
No currents occur for several minutes during either high slack water (which occurs at
the peak of each high tide) or low slack water (at the peak of each low tide).

Reversing currents in bays can sometimes reach speeds of
40 kilometers (25 miles) per hour, creating a navigation hazard
for ships. On the other hand, the daily flow of these currents
often keeps sediment from closing off the bay and replenishes
the bay with seawater and ocean nutrients.

Tidal currents can be significant even in deep ocean waters.
For example, tidal currents were encountered shortly after the
discovery of the remains of the Titanic at a depth of 3795 meters
(12,448 feet) on the continental slope south of Newfoundland s
Grand Banks in 1985. These tidal currents were so strong that
they  forced  researchers  to  abandon  the  use  of  the  camera-
equipped, tethered, remotely-operated vehicle Jason Jr.

Coastal tidal phenomena include large tidal ranges (the
largest of which occurs in the Bay of Fundy, where 
reflection and amplification produce a maximum 
spring tide range of 17 meters 56 feet), tidal cur-
rents, and rapidly spinning vortices called whirlpools.

Whirlpools: Fact or Fiction?
A whirlpool a rapidly spinning body of water, which is also
termed a vortex (vertere * to turn)
can be created in some
restricted  coastal  passages  due  to  reversing  tidal  currents.
Whirlpools  most  commonly  occur  in  shallow  passages  con-
necting two large bodies of water that have different tidal cy-
cles. The different tidal heights of the two bodies cause water
to  move  vigorously  through  the  passage. As  water  rushes
through the passage, it is affected by the shape of the shallow
sea  floor, causing  turbulence, which, along  with  spin  due  to
opposing  tidal  currents, creates  whirlpools. The  larger  the
tidal  difference  between  the  two  bodies  of  water  and  the
smaller the passage, the greater the vortex caused by the tidal
currents. Because whirlpools can have high flow rates of up to
16 kilometers (10 miles) per hour, they can cause ships to spin out of control for a
short time.

HSW

One  of  the  world s  most  famous  whirlpools  is  the  Maelstrom (malen * to
grind  in  a  circle, strom * stream), which  occurs  in  a  passage  off  the  west  coast
of Arctic Norway (Figure 9.20). This and another famous whirlpool in the Strait of
Messina, which separates mainland Italy from Sicily, are probably the source of
ancient  legends  of  huge  churning  funnels  of  water  that  destroy  ships  and  carry
mariners to their deaths, although they are not nearly as deadly as legends sug-
gest. Other notable whirlpools occur off the west coast of Scotland, in the Bay of
Fundy  at  the  border  between  Maine  and  the  Canadian  province  of  New
Brunswick, and off Japan s Shikoku Island.

9.6 Can Tidal Power Be Harnessed as 

a Source of Energy?

Throughout history, ocean tides have been used as a source of power. During high
tide, water can be trapped in a basin and then harnessed to do work as it flows
back to the sea. In the 12th century, for example, water wheels driven by the tides
were used to power gristmills and sawmills. During the 17th and 18th centuries,
much of Boston s flour was produced at a tidal mill.

Today, tidal power is considered a clean, renewable resource with vast poten-
tial. The initial cost of building a tidal power-generating plant may be higher than
a  conventional  thermal  power  plant, but  the  operating  costs  would  be  less  be-
cause it does not use fossil fuels or radioactive substances to generate electricity.
One disadvantage of tidal power, however, is the periodicity of the tides, al-
lowing  power  to  be  generated  only  during  a  portion  of  a  24-hour  day. People

operate  on  a  solar  period, but  tides  operate  on  a  lunar  period, so  the
energy available from the tides would coincide with need only part of the
time. Power would have to be distributed to the point of need at the moment it
was  generated, which  could  be  a  great  distance  away, resulting  in  an  expensive
transmission problem. The power could be stored, but even this alternative pres-
ents a large and expensive technical problem.

To generate electricity effectively, electrical turbines (generators) need to run
at a constant speed, which is difficult to maintain when generated by the variable
flow  of  tidal  currents  in  two  directions  (flood  tide  and  ebb  tide). Specially  de-
signed turbines that allow both advancing and receding water to spin their blades
are necessary to solve the problem of generating electricity from the tides.

Another disadvantage of tidal power is harm to wildlife and other unwanted
environmental effects resulting from the modification of tidal current flow. In ad-
dition, a  tidal  power  plant  would  likely  interfere  with  many  traditional  uses  of
coastal waters, such as transportation and fishing.

Tidal Power Plants
Tidal power can be harnessed in one of two ways: (1) Tidal water trapped behind
coastal barriers in bays and estuaries can be used to turn turbines and generate
electrical energy, and (2) tidal currents that pass through narrow channels can be
used to turn underwater pivoting turbines, which produce energy (see Chapter 7).
Although the first type is much more commonly employed, Norway, the United
Kingdom, and  the  United  States  have  recently  installed  offshore  turbines  that
harness  swift  coastal  tidal  currents  and  plan  to  expand  these  devices  into  tidal
energy farms.

Worldwide, there are only a few small tidal power plants that use water trapped
behind coastal barriers. One successful tidal power plant has been operating in the

estuary of La Rance River in northern France (Figure 9.21) since 1967. The estuary
has a surface area of approximately 23 square kilometers (9 square miles), and the
tidal range is 13.4 meters (44 feet). Usable tidal energy increases as the area of the
basin increases and as the tidal range increases.

The power-generating barrier was built across the estuary a little over 3 kilo-
meters (2 miles) upstream to protect it from storm waves. The barrier is 760 me-
ters (2500 feet) wide and supports a two-lane road (Figure 9.21). Water passing
through  the  barrier  powers  24  electricity-generating  units  that  operate  beneath
the power plant. At peak operating capacity, each unit can generate 10 megawatts
of electricity for a total of 240 megawatts.13

To generate electricity, the La Rance plant needs a sufficient water height be-
tween  the  estuary  and  the  ocean which  only  occurs  about  half  of  the  time.
Annual power production of about 540 million kilowatt-hours can be increased to
670  million  kilowatt-hours  by  using  the  turbine  generators  as  pumps  to  move
water into the estuary at proper times.

Within the Bay of Fundy, which has the largest tidal range in the world, the
Canadian province of Nova Scotia constructed a small tidal power plant in 1984
that can generate 20 megawatts of electricity. The plant is built on the Annapolis
River  estuary, an  arm  of  the  Bay  of  Fundy  (see  Figure  9.18), where  maximum
tidal range is 8.7 meters (26 feet).

13Each megawatt of electricity is enough to serve the energy needs of about 800 average U.S. homes.

In 2006, the first Asian tidal power plant came online in Daishan County of
eastern China s Zhejiang province. This small power station has the capability to
produce  40  kilowatts  of  electricity, and  China  has  proposed  building  another
larger plant.

Larger  power  plants  that  avoid  some  of  the  shortcomings  of  smaller  plants
have often been considered. For example, a tidal power plant could be made to
generate electricity continually if it were located on the Passamaquoddy Bay near
the  U.S. Canadian  border  near  the  entrance  to  the  Bay  of  Fundy. Although  a
tidal power plant across the Bay of Fundy has often been proposed, it has never
been  built. Potentially, the  usable  tidal  energy  seems  large  compared  to  the  La
Rance plant, because the flow volume is over 100 times greater.

Recognizing the benefits of tidal power, the United Kingdom has proposed
building a tidal power barrage across the Severn Estuary that separates England
and Wales. The Severn River has the second-largest tidal range in the world and is
a  prime  target  for  producing  tidal  power. If  completed, it  would  be  the  world s
largest tidal power plant with a 12-kilometer- (7.5-mile-) long dam that could pro-
duce 8.6 gigawatts of energy, or about 5% of the electricity currently used in the
United Kingdom.

The daily change in water level as a result of ocean
tides can be harnessed as a source of energy. In
spite of significant drawbacks, several tidal power
plants in coastal estuaries successfully extract
tidal energy today.

Chapter in Review

Gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun create Earth s tides, which
are  fundamentally  long  wavelength  waves. According  to  a  simplified
model of tides, which assumes an ocean of uniform depth and ignores the
effects of friction, small horizontal forces (the tide-generating forces) tend
to  push  water  into  two  bulges  on  opposite  sides  of  Earth. One  bulge  is
directly facing the tide-generating body (the Moon and the Sun), and the
other is directly opposite.

Despite its vastly smaller size, the Moon has about twice the tide-generat-
ing effect of the Sun because the Moon is so much closer to Earth. The tidal
bulges  due  to  the  Moon s  gravity  (the  lunar  bulges)  dominate, so  lunar
motions dominate the periods of Earth s tides. However, the changing po-
sition  of  the  solar  bulges  relative  to  the  lunar  bulges  modifies  tides.
According  to  the simplified  idealized  tide theory, Earth s  rotation  carries
locations on Earth into and out of the various tidal bulges.

Tides would be easy to predict if Earth were a uniform sphere covered
with  an  ocean  of  uniform  depth. For  most  places  on  Earth, the  time
between  successive  high  tides would  be 12  hours 25  minutes (half  a lunar
2 monthly  tidal  cycle would  consist  of  tides  with  maximum
day). The 291
tidal  range  (spring  tides)  and  minimum  tidal  range  (neap  tides). Spring
tides  would  occur  each  new  moon  and  full  moon, and  neap  tides  would
occur each first- and third-quarter phases of the Moon.

The declination of the Moon varies between 28.5 degrees north or south
of  the  equator  during  the  lunar  month, and  the  declination  of  the  Sun
varies between 23.5 degrees north or south of the equator during the year,
so  the  location  of  tidal  bulges  usually  creates  two  high  tides  and  two  low
tides of unequal height per lunar day. Tidal ranges are greatest when Earth
is nearest the Sun and Moon.

When  friction  and  the  true  shape  of  ocean  basins  are  considered, the
dynamics of tides becomes more complicated. Moreover, the two bulges on
opposite sides of Earth cannot exist because they cannot keep up with the

rotational speed of Earth. Instead, the bulges are broken up into several
tidal cells that rotate around an amphidromic point a point of zero tidal
range. Rotation  is  counterclockwise  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  and
clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Many other factors influence tides
on Earth, too, such as the positions of the continents, the varying depth of
the ocean, and coastline shape.

The three types of tidal patterns observed on Earth are diurnal (a sin-
gle  high  and  low  tide  each  lunar  day), semidiurnal (two  high  and  two
low  tides  each  lunar  day), and  mixed (characteristics  of  both). Mixed
tidal  patterns  usually  consist  of  semidiurnal  periods  with  significant
diurnal  inequality. Mixed  tidal  patterns  are  the  most  common  type  in
the world.

There  are  many  types  of  observable  tidal  phenomena  in  coastal  areas.
Tidal bores are true tidal waves (a wave produced by the tides) that occur
in certain rivers and bays due to an incoming high tide. The effects of con-
structive interference together with the shoaling and narrowing of coastal
bays creates the largest tidal range in the world 17 meters (56 feet)
at the
northern end of Nova Scotia s Bay of Fundy. Tidal currents follow a rotary
pattern in open-ocean basins but are converted to reversing currents along
continental  margins. The  maximum  velocity  of  reversing  currents  occurs
during flood and ebb currents when the water is halfway between high and
low slack waters. Whirlpools can be created in some restricted coastal pas-
sages due to reversing tidal currents. The tides are also important to many
marine  organisms. For  instance, grunion small  silvery  fish  that  inhabit
waters along the West Coast of North America time their spawning cycle
to match the pattern of the tides.

Tides can be used to generate power without need for fossil or nuclear
fuel. There are some significant drawbacks, however, to creating successful
tidal power plants. Still, many sites worldwide have the potential for tidal
power generation.

Critical Thinking Exercises

1. From  memory, draw  the  positions  of  the  Earth Moon Sun  system
during a complete monthly tidal cycle. Indicate the tide conditions experi-
enced on Earth, the phases of the Moon, the time between those phases,
and syzygy and quadrature.

3. Diagram  the  Earth Moon  system s  orbit  about  the  Sun. Label  the
positions on the orbit at which the Moon and Sun are closest to and far-
thest  from  Earth, stating  the  terms  used  to  identify  them. Discuss  the
effects of the Moon s and Earth s positions on Earth s tides.

2. Assume that there are two moons in orbit around Earth that are on the
same  orbital  plane  but  always  on  opposite  sides  of  Earth  and  that  each
moon is the same size and mass of our Moon. How would this affect the
tidal range during spring and neap tide conditions?

4. Observe the Moon from a reference location every night at about the
same time for two weeks. Keep track of your observations about the shape
(phase) of the Moon and its position in the sky. Then compare these to the
reported tides in your area and report your findings.

THE COAST: BEACHES AND
SHORELINE PROCESSES

Humans have always been attracted to the coastal regions of the world for their moderate climate,
seafood, transportation, recreational  opportunities, and  commercial  benefits. In  the  United  States,
for example, 80% of the population now lives within easy access of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf
Coasts, increasing the stress on these important national resources.

The  coastal  region  is  constantly  changing  because  waves  crash  along  most  shorelines  more  than
10,000 times a day, releasing their energy from distant storms. Waves cause erosion in some areas and
deposition in others, resulting in changes that occur hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, seasonally, and yearly.
In  this  chapter, we ll  examine  the  major  features  of  the  seacoast  and  shore  and  the  processes
that modify them. We ll also discuss ways people interfere with these processes, creating hazards to
themselves and to the environment.

10.1 How Are Coastal Regions Defined?
The  shore is a zone that lies between the lowest tide level (low tide) and the highest elevation on
land that is affected by storm waves. The coast extends inland from the shore as far as ocean-related
features can be found (Figure 10.1). The width of the shore varies between a few meters and hun-
dreds of meters. The width of the coast may vary from less than 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) to many tens
of kilometers. The coastline marks the boundary between the shore and the coast. It is the landward
limit of the effect of the highest storm waves on the shore.

Beach Terminology
The  beach  profile  in  Figure  10.1 shows  features  characteristic  of  a  cliffed  shoreline. The  shore  is
divided into the backshore and the foreshore.1 The backshore is above the high tide shoreline and is
covered  with  water  only  during storms. The  foreshore is the portion exposed at low tide and  sub-
merged at high tide. The shoreline migrates back and forth with the tide and is the water s edge. The
nearshore extends  seaward  from  the  low  tide  shoreline  to  the  low  tide  breaker  line. It  is  never
exposed  to  the  atmosphere, but  it  is  affected  by  waves  that  touch  bottom. Beyond  the  low-tide
breakers is the offshore zone, which is deep enough that waves rarely affect the bottom.

A beach is a deposit of the shore area. It consists of wave-worked sediment that moves along the
wave-cut  bench (a  flat, wave-eroded  surface). A  beach  may  continue  from  the  coastline  across
the nearshore region to the line of breakers. Thus, the beach is the entire active area of a coast that

1The foreshore is often referred to as the intertidal zone, or littoral (litoralis * the shore) zone.

experiences changes due to breaking waves. The area
of  the  beach  above  the  shoreline  is  often  called  the
recreational beach.

The berm is the dry, gently sloping region at the
foot of the coastal cliffs or dunes. The berm is often
composed  of  sand, making  it  a  favorite  place  of
beachgoers. The beach face is the wet, sloping surface
that  extends  from  the  berm  to  the  shoreline. It  is
more fully exposed during low tide and is also known
as  the  low  tide  terrace. The  beach  face  is  a  favorite
place  for  runners  because  the  sand  is  wet  and  hard
packed. Offshore  beyond  the  beach  face  is  one  or
more  longshore  bars
sand  bars  that  parallel  the
coast. A  longshore  bar  may  not  always  be  present
throughout  the  year, but  when  one  is, it  may  be  ex-
posed  during  extremely  low  tides. Longshore  bars
can  trip waves  as  they  approach  shore  and  cause
them to begin breaking. Separating the longshore bar
from the beach face is a longshore trough.

regions. The beach is the entire active area affected by
waves that extends from the low tide breaker line to the base

sediment

Beach Composition
Beaches are composed of whatever material is locally available. When this mat-
erial
comes from the erosion of beach cliffs or nearby coastal moun-
tains, beaches  are  composed  of  mineral  particles  from  these  rocks  and  may  be
relatively coarse in texture. When the sediment comes primarily from rivers that
drain lowland areas, beaches are finer in texture. Often, mud flats develop along
the shore because only tiny clay-sized and silt-sized particles are emptied into the
ocean. Such is the case for muddy coastlines such as along the coast of Suriname
in South America and the Kerala coast of southwest India.

Other  beaches  have  a  significant  biologic  component. For  example, in  low-
relief, low-latitude areas such as southern Florida, where there are no mountains
or other sources of rock-forming minerals nearby, most beaches are composed of
shell  fragments  and  the  remains  of  organisms  that  live  in  coastal  waters. Many
beaches  on  volcanic  islands  in  the  open  ocean  are  composed  of  black  or  green
fragments of the basaltic lava that comprise the islands, or of coarse debris from
coral reefs that develop around islands in low latitudes.

Regardless of the composition, though, the material that comprises the beach
does not stay in one place. Instead, the waves that crash along the shoreline are
constantly moving it. Thus, beaches can be thought of as material in transit along
the shoreline.

10.2 How Does Sand Move on the

Beach?

The movement of sand on the beach occurs both perpendicular to the shoreline
(toward and away from shore) and parallel to the shoreline (often referred to as
upcoast and downcoast).

How Does Sand Move on the Beach?

287

MECHANISM As  each  wave  breaks, water  rushes  up  the  beach
face toward the berm. Some of this swash soaks into the beach and
eventually returns to the ocean. However, most of the water drains
away from shore as backwash, though usually not before the next
wave breaks and sends its swash over the top of the previous wave s
backwash.

While  standing  in  ankle-deep  water  at  the  shoreline, you  can
see that swash and backwash transport sediment up and down the
beach face perpendicular to the shoreline. Whether swash or back-
wash  dominates  determines  whether  sand  is  deposited  or  eroded
from the berm.

LIGHT VERSUS HEAVY WAVE ACTIVITY During light wave activity
(characterized by less energetic waves), much of the swash soaks into
the  beach, so  backwash  is  reduced. The  swash  dominates  the
transport  system, therefore  causing  a  net  movement  of  the  sand
up the  beach  face  toward  the  berm, which  creates  a  wide, well-
developed berm.

During  heavy  wave  activity (characterized  by  high-energy
waves), the beach is saturated with water from previous waves, so
very little of the swash soaks into the beach. Backwash dominates
the  transport  system, therefore  causing  a  net  movement  of  sand
down the beach face, which erodes the berm. When a wave breaks,
moreover, the incoming swash comes on top of the previous wave s
backwash, effectively  protecting  the  beach  from  the  swash  and
adding to the eroding effect of the backwash.

During heavy wave activity, where does the sand from the berm
go? The  orbital  motion  in  waves  is  too  shallow  to  move  the  sand
very far offshore. Thus, the sand accumulates just beyond where the
waves break and forms one or more offshore sand bars (the long-
shore bars).

SUMMERTIME  AND  WINTERTIME  BEACHES Light  and  heavy
wave  activity  alternate  seasonally  at  most  beaches,
the
characteristics of the beaches they produce change, too (Table 10.1).
For  example, light  wave  activity  produces  a  wide  sandy  berm  and
an overall steep beach face a summertime beach at the expense of
the  longshore  bar  (Figure  10.2a). Conversely, heavy  wave  activity
produces a narrow rocky berm and an overall flattened beach face
a  wintertime  beach and  builds  prominent  longshore  bars  (Fig-
ure 10.2b). A  wide  berm  that  takes  several  months  to  build  can be
destroyed in just a few hours by high-energy wintertime storm waves.

MECHANISM Recall from Chapter 8 that within the surf zone,
waves  refract (bend)  and  line  up  nearly parallel  to  shore. With
each breaking wave, the swash moves up onto the exposed beach
at  a  slight  angle; then  gravity  pulls  the  backwash  down  the  beach  face  at  a
slight  downcoast  angle. As  a  result, water  moves  in  a  zigzag  fashion  along
the shore.

LONGSHORE  CURRENT  AND  LONGSHORE  DRIFT  (LONGSHORE  TRANSPORT)
This  zigzag  movement  of  water  along  the  shore  is  called  a  longshore  current

Longshore Current and Longshore (Beach) Drift

(Figure 10.3). Longshore currents have speeds up to 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) per
hour. Speeds  increase  as  beach  slope  increases, as  the  angle  at  which  breakers
arrive  at  the  beach  increases, as  wave  height  increases, and  as  wave  frequency
increases.

Swimmers can inadvertently be carried by longshore currents and find them-
selves carried far from where they initially entered the water. This demonstrates
that  longshore  currents  are  strong  enough  to  move
people  as  well  as  a  vast  amount  of  sand  in  a  zigzag
fashion along the shore.

Longshore  drift (also  called  longshore  transport,
beach  drift, or  littoral  drift)  is  the  movement  of
sediment in  a  zigzag  fashion  caused  by  the  longshore
current  (Figure  10.3b). Both  longshore  currents  and
longshore  transport  occur  only  within  the  surf  zone
and not farther offshore because the water is too deep
there. Recall  from  Chapter  8 that  the  depth  of  wave
base is  one-half  a  wave s  wavelength, measured  from
still  water  level. Below  this  depth, waves  don t  touch
bottom, they  don t  refract, and, as  a result, longshore
currents can t form.

THE  BEACH:  A  RIVER  OF  SAND By  various
processes, both  rivers  and  coastal  zones  move  water
and  sediment  from  one  area  (upcoast or  upstream)
to another  (downcoast or  downstream). As  a  result,
the beach  has  often  been  referred  to  as  a  river  of
sand. There  are, however, differences  between  how
beaches and rivers transport sediment. For example, a
longshore  current  moves  in  a  zigzag  fashion  while
rivers  flow  mostly  in  a  turbulent, swirling  fashion. In
addition, the  direction  of  flow  of  longshore  currents
along  a  shoreline  can  change, whereas  rivers  always
flow  in  the  same  basic  direction  (downhill). The
longshore  current  can  change  direction  because  the
waves  that  approach  the  beach  typically  come  from
different  directions  in  different  seasons. Nevertheless,
the longshore current generally flows southward along
both the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the United States.

10.3 What Features Exist Along Erosional and Depositional Shores?

289

10.3 What Features Exist Along
Erosional and Depositional
Shores?

Sediment eroded from the beach is transported along the shore and deposited in
areas where wave energy is low. Even though all shores experience some degree of
both erosion and deposition, shores can often be identified primarily as one type
or the other. Erosional shores typically have well-developed cliffs and are in areas
where tectonic uplift of the coast occurs, such as along the U.S. Pacific Coast.

The U.S. southeastern Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast, on the other hand,
are primarily depositional shores. Sand deposits and offshore barrier islands are
common  there  because  the  shore  is  gradually  subsiding. Erosion  can  still  be  a
major problem  on depositional  shores, especially  when  human development in-
terferes with natural coastal processes.

Features of Erosional Shores
Because of wave refraction, wave energy is concentrated on any headlands that
jut out from the continent, while the amount of energy reaching the shore in bays
is reduced. Headlands, therefore, are eroded and the shoreline retreats. Some of
these erosional features are shown in Figure 10.4.

Waves  pound  relentlessly  away  at  the  base  of  headlands, undermining  the
upper portions, which eventually collapse to form wave-cut cliffs. The waves may
form sea caves at the base of the cliffs.

As  waves  continue  to  pound the  headlands, the  caves  may  eventually  erode
through to the other side, forming openings called sea arches (Figure 10.5). Some
sea arches are large enough to allow a boat to maneuver safely through them. With
continued erosion, the tops of sea arches eventually crumble to produce sea stacks
(Figure 10.5). Waves also erode the bedrock of the bench. Uplift of the wave-cut
bench creates a gently sloping marine terrace above sea level (Figure 10.6).

Rates of coastal erosion are influenced by the degree of exposure to waves,
the amount of tidal range, and the composition of the coastal bedrock. Regardless

How much sand is moved along coasts by longshore
drift?

Very impressive amounts! For example, longshore drift
rates are typically in the range of 75,000 to 230,000
cubic meters (100,000 to 300,000 cubic yards) per
year. To help you visualize how much sand this is, think
of a typical dump truck, which has a volume of about
45  cubic  meters  (60  cubic  yards).  In  essence,  long-
shore  drift  carries  the  equivalent  of  thousands  of  full
dump trucks along coastal regions each year. And, a
few coastal regions have longshore drift rates as high
as  765,000  cubic  meters  (1,000,000  cubic  yards)
per year.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Longshore currents are produced by waves 
approaching the beach at an angle and create 
longshore drift, which transports and along 
the coast in a zigzag fashion.

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

Along the East Coast of the United States, how can
the longshore current move to the south when the
strong Gulf Stream current is moving to the north?

Longshore currents and major ocean surface currents
are different things and completely independent of one
another. For one thing, longshore currents occur only
within the surf zone, while ocean surface currents are
much wider and occur farther from shore. For another,
longshore  currents  are  caused  by  waves  coming  into
shore  at  an  angle  (and  so  can  reverse),  while  ocean
surface currents are caused by the major wind belts of
the  world  and  modified  by  the  Coriolis  effect  (and  so
rarely  reverse).  And  remember  that  waves  (which
cause  longshore  currents)  can  move  in  the  opposite
direction from ocean surface currents.

Along  the  East  Coast  of  the  United  States,  the
reason that the longshore current goes to the south
is  because  the  major  storm  centers  that  create
waves occur in the stormy northern part of the North
Atlantic  Ocean.  As  waves  radiate  southward  from
these storm centers, a southward-moving longshore
current  is  produced  along  the  East  Coast.  A  similar
situation occurs in the North Pacific Ocean, creating
a  southward-moving  longshore  current  along  the
West Coast, which just happens to move in the same
direction as the California Current.

WARNING: RIP CURRENTS . . . DO YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO?

The  backwash  from  breaking  waves  usu-
ally returns to the open ocean as a flow of
water  across  the  ocean  bottom, so  it  is
commonly  referred  to  as 
sheet  flow.
Some  of  this  water, however, flows  back
in surface rip currents. Rip currents typi-
cally flow perpendicular to the beach and
move away from the shore.

Rip  currents  are  between  15  and  45
meters (15 and 150 feet) wide and can at-
tain velocities of 7 to 8 kilometers (4 to 5
miles) per hour
faster than most people
can swim for any length of time. In fact, it
is  useless  to  swim  for  long  against  a  cur-

rent stronger than about 2 kilometers (1.2
miles)  per  hour. Rip  currents  can  travel
hundreds  of  meters  from  shore  before
they break up. If a light-to-moderate swell
is  breaking, numerous  rip  currents  may
develop that are moderate in size and ve-
locity. A  heavy  swell  usually  produces
fewer, more  concentrated, and  stronger
rips. They 
can
often  be  recog-
nized  by  the  way
they interfere with
incoming  waves,
by their character-

istic  brown  color  caused  by  suspended
sediment, or  by  their  foamy  and  choppy
surface (Figure 10A).

The  rip  currents  that  occur  during
heavy  swell  are  a  significant  hazard  to
coastal swimmers. In fact, 80% of rescues at
beaches  by  lifeguards  involve  people  who
are  trapped  in  rip  currents. Swimmers
caught  in  a  rip
current  can  es-
cape  by  swim-
ming  parallel  to
the  shore  for  a
distance
short 
(simply 
swim-
ming  out  of  the
narrow  rip  cur-
rent)  and 
then
riding  the  waves
in 
the
beach. However,
even 
excellent
swimmers  who
panic  or  try  to  fight  the  current  by  swim-
ming  directly  into  it  are  eventually  over-
come by exhaustion and may drown. Even
though most beaches have warnings posted
and  are  frequently  patrolled  by  lifeguards,
many people lose their lives each year be-
cause of rip currents.

What is the difference between a rip current and a rip tide? Are they the same thing as an undertow?

Like tidal waves (tsunami), rip tides are a misnomer and have nothing to do with the tides. Rip tides are more correctly called rip cur-
rents. Perhaps rip currents have incorrectly been called rip tides because they occur suddenly (like an incoming tide). The origin of rip
currents and their associated dangers are discussed in Box 10.1.

An undertow, similar to a rip current, is a flow of water away from shore. An undertow is much wider, however, and is usually
more concentrated along the ocean floor. An undertow is really a continuation of backwash that flows down the beach face and is
strongest  during  heavy  wave  activity.  Undertows  can  be  strong  enough  to  knock  people  off  their  feet,  but  they  are  confined  to  the 
immediate floor of the ocean and only within the surf zone.

of  the  erosion  rate, all  coastal  regions  follow  the  same  developmental  path. As
long as there is no change in the elevation of the landmass relative to the ocean
surface, the cliffs will continue to erode and retreat until the beaches widen suffi-
ciently to prevent waves from reaching them. The eroded material is carried from
high-energy areas and deposited in low-energy areas.

Features of Depositional Shores
Coastal erosion of sea cliffs produces large amounts of sediment. Additional sedi-
ment, which  is  carried  to  the  shore  by  rivers, comes  from  the  erosion  of  inland
rocks. Waves then distribute all of this sediment along the continental margin.

coast at Bolinas Point near San Francisco. An elevated wave-
cut bench, called a marine terrace, is shown at right.

Figure  10.7 shows  some  of  the  features
of depositional coasts. These features are pri-
marily deposits of sand moved by longshore
drift  but  are  also  modified  by  other  coastal
processes. Some are partially or wholly sepa-
rated from the shore.

A spit (spit * spine) is a linear ridge of
sediment  that  extends  in  the  direction  of
longshore  drift  from  land  into  the  deeper
water  near  the  mouth  of  a  bay. The  end  of
the spit normally curves into the bay due to
the movement of currents.

Tidal  currents  or  currents  from  river
runoff are usually strong enough to keep the mouth of the bay open. If not, the
spit may eventually extend across the bay and connect to the mainland, forming a
bay  barrier, or  bay-mouth  bar (Figure  10.8a), which  cuts  off  the  bay  from  the
open ocean. Although a bay barrier is a buildup of sand usually less than 1 meter
(3.3 feet) above sea level, permanent buildings are often constructed on them.

A tombolo (tombolo * mound) is a sand ridge that connects an island or sea
stack to the mainland (Figure 10.8b). Tombolos can also connect two adjacent is-
lands. Formed in the wave-energy shadow of an island, tombolos are usually ori-
ented perpendicular to the average direction of wave crests.

BARRIER  ISLANDS Extremely long offshore deposits of sand that are parallel
to  the  coast  are  called  barrier  islands (Figure  10.9). They  form  a  first  line  of
defense  against  rising  sea  level  and  high-energy  storm  waves, which  would
otherwise  exert  their  full  force  directly  against  the  shore. The  origin  of  barrier
islands is complex, but many appear to have developed during the worldwide rise
in sea level that is associated with the melting of glaciers at the end of the most
recent ice age about 18,000 years ago.

At least 280 barrier islands ring the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United
States. They  are  nearly  continuous  from  Massachusetts  to  Florida  and  continue
through the Gulf of Mexico, where they exist well south of the Mexican border.

Barrier  islands  may  exceed  100  kilometers  (60  miles)  in  length,
have  widths  of  several  kilometers, and  are  separated  from  the
mainland by  a lagoon. Notable  barrier islands  include  Fire Island
off the New York coast, North Carolina s Outer Banks, and Padre
Island off the coast of Texas.

One  human-related  environmental  issue  of  barrier  islands  is
their  proximity  to  the  ocean, which  is  often  considered  a  prime
building site. Although it seems unwise to build a coastal structure
on a narrow, low-lying, shifting strip of sand, many large buildings
have been constructed on barrier islands (see Figure 10.9c). Some
of these structures have either fallen into the ocean or have needed
to be moved (Box 10.2).

Features  of  Barrier  Islands A  typical  barrier  island  has  the
physiographic  features  shown  in  Figure  10.10a. From  the  ocean
landward, they  are  (1)  ocean  beach, (2)  dunes, (3)  barrier  flat,
(4) high salt marsh, (5) low salt marsh, and (6) lagoon between the
barrier island and the mainland.

During  the  summer, gentle  waves  carry  sand  to  the  ocean
beach, so it widens and becomes steeper. During the winter, higher
energy  waves  carry  sand  offshore  and  produce  a  narrow, gently
sloping beach.

Winds blow sand inland during dry periods to produce coastal
dunes, which are stabilized by dune grasses. These plants can with-
stand salt spray and burial by sand. Dunes protect the lagoon against
excessive flooding during storm-driven high tides. Numerous passes
exist through the dunes, particularly along the southeastern Atlantic
Coast, where dunes are less well developed than to the north.

THE MOVE OF THE CENTURY: RELOCATING THE CAPE HATTERAS LIGHTHOUSE

Despite  efforts  to  protect  structures  that
are  too  close  to  the  shore, such  structures
can still be in danger of being destroyed by
receding  shorelines  and  the  destructive
power of waves. Such was the case for one
of the nation s most prominent landmarks,
the  candy-striped 
lighthouse  at  Cape
Hatteras, North  Carolina, which  is  21  sto-
ries tall
the nation s tallest lighthouse and
the tallest brick lighthouse in the world.

The  lighthouse  was  built  in  1870  on
the  Cape  Hatteras  barrier  island  457  me-
ters (1500 feet) from the shoreline to guide
mariners  through  the  dangerous  offshore
shoals  known  as  the  Graveyard  of  the
Atlantic. As the barrier island began mi-
grating  toward  land, its  beach  narrowed.
When the waves began to lap just 37 meters
(120 feet) from its brick and granite base,
there was concern that even a moderate-
strength hurricane could trigger beach ero-
sion sufficient to topple the lighthouse.

In  1970, the  U.S. Navy  built  three
groins  in  front  of  the  lighthouse  in  an  ef-
fort to protect the lighthouse from further
erosion. The groins initially slowed erosion

but  disrupted  sand  flow  in  the  surf  zone,
which  caused  the  flattening  of  nearby
dunes and the formation of a bay south of
the  lighthouse. Attempts  to  increase  the
width  of  the  beach  in  front  of  the  light-
house included beach nourishment and ar-
tificial  offshore  beds  of  seaweed, both  of
which  failed  to  widen  the  beach  substan-
tially. In the 1980s, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers  proposed  building  a  massive
stone  seawall  around  the  lighthouse  but
decided  the  eroding  coast  would  eventu-
ally  move  out  from  under  the  structure,
leaving it stranded at sea on its own island.
In  1988, the  U.S. National  Academy  of
Sciences  determined  that  the  shoreline  in
front of the lighthouse would retreat so far
as  to  destroy  the  lighthouse  and  recom-
mended  relocation  of  the  tower  as  had
been  done  with  smaller  lighthouses. In
1999, the U.S. National Park Service, which
owns  the  lighthouse, finally  authorized
moving the structure to a safer location.

Moving  the  lighthouse, which  weighs
4400  metric  tons  (4800  short  tons), was
accomplished by severing it from its foun-

dation  and  carefully  hoisting  it  onto  a
platform  of  steel  beams  fitted  with  roller
dollies. Once  on  the  platform,
it  was
slowly  rolled  along  a  specially  designed
steel  track  using  a  series  of  hydraulic
jacks. A strip of vegetation was cleared to
make  a  runway  along  which  the  light-
house crept 1.5 meters (5 feet) at a time,
with the track picked up from behind and
reconstructed  in  front  of  the  tower  as  it
moved. During  June  and  July  1999, the
lighthouse  was  gingerly  transported  884
meters  (2900  feet)  from  its  original  loca-
tion, making  it  one  of  the  largest  struc-
tures ever moved successfully.

After  its  $12  million  move, the  light-
house now resides in a scrub oak and pine
woodland  488  meters  (1600  feet)  from
the shore  (Figure  10B). Although  it  now
stands  further  inland, the  light s  slightly
higher elevation makes it visible just as far
out  to  sea, where  it  continues  to  warn
mariners of hazardous shoals. At the cur-
rent  rate  of  shoreline  retreat, the  light-
house  should  be  safe  from  the  threat  of
waves for at least another century.

how a barrier island migrates toward the mainland in 
response to rising sea level and exposes peat deposits that 
have been covered by the island.

The barrier flat forms behind the dunes from sand driven through the passes
during  storms. Grasses  quickly  colonize  these  flats  and  seawater  washes  over
them during storms. If storms wash over the barrier flat infrequently enough, the
plants undergo natural biological succession, with the grasses successively replaced
by thickets, woodlands, and eventually forests.

Salt marshes typically lie inland of the barrier flat. They are divided into the
low marsh, which extends from about mean sea level to the high neap-tide line,
and the high marsh, which extends to the highest spring-tide line. The low marsh
is by far the most biologically productive part of the salt marsh.

New marshland is formed as overwash carries sediment into the lagoon, filling
portions  so  they  become  intermittently  exposed  by  the  tides. Marshes  may
be poorly developed on parts of the island that are far from floodtide inlets. Their
development is greatly restricted on barrier islands, where people perform artificial
dune enhancement and fill inlets, which help prevent overwashing and flooding.

296

Chapter 10

The Coast: Beaches and Shoreline Processes

The  gradual  sea  level  rise  experienced  along  the  eastern  North  American
coast is causing barrier islands to migrate landward. The movement of the barrier
island  is  similar  to  a  slowly  moving  tractor  tread, with  the  entire  island  rolling
over  itself, impacting  structures  built  on  these  islands. Peat  deposits, which  are
formed  by  the  accumulation  of  organic  matter  in  marsh  environments, provide
further evidence of barrier island migration (Figure 10.10b). As the island slowly
rolls over itself and migrates toward land, it buries ancient peat deposits. These
peat deposits can be found beneath the island and may even be exposed on the
ocean beach when the barrier island has moved far enough.

DELTAS Some rivers carry more sediment to the ocean than longshore currents can
distribute. These rivers develop a delta (delta * triangular) deposit at their mouths.
The Mississippi River, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico (Figure 10.11a), forms
one  of  the  largest  deltas  on  Earth. Deltas  are  fertile, flat, low-lying  areas  that  are
subject to periodic flooding.

Delta  formation  begins  when  a  river  has  filled  its  mouth  with  sediment. The
delta then grows through the formation of distributaries, which are branching chan-
nels that deposit sediment as they radiate out over the delta in finger-like extensions
(Figure 10.11a). When the fingers get too long, they become choked with sediment.
At this point, a flood may easily shift the distributary s course and provide sediment
to low-lying areas between the fingers. When depositional processes exceed coastal
erosion and transportation processes, a branching  bird s foot Mississippi-type delta
results.

When erosion and transportation processes exceed deposition, on the other
hand, a delta shoreline is smoothed to a gentle curve, like that of the Nile River
Delta in Egypt (Figure 10.11b). The Nile Delta is presently eroding because sedi-
ment is trapped behind the Aswan High Dam. Before the completion of the dam
in 1964, the Nile carried huge volumes of sediment into the Mediterranean Sea.

canyons  where  sand  is  drained  away  from  the  beach. The  map  in  Figure  10.12
shows  that  the  coast  of  Southern  California  contains  four  separate  beach
compartments.

Within an individual beach compartment, sand is supplied primarily by rivers
(Figure 10.12, inset) but in areas that have coastal bluffs, a substantial proportion
of sand may also be supplied by sea cliff erosion. The sand moves south with the
longshore  current, so  beaches  are  wider  near  the  southern  (downcoast)  end  of
each beach compartment. Although some sand is washed offshore along the way
or  blows  onshore  to  produce  coastal  sand  dunes, most  sand  eventually  moves
near the head of a submarine canyon, many of which come surprisingly close to
shore. The sand is drained off away from the beach and onto the ocean floor, lost
from the beach forever. To the south of this beach compartment, the beaches are
typically thin and rocky, without much sand. The process begins all over again at
the upcoast end of the next beach compartment, where rivers add their sediment.
Farther  downcoast, the  beach  widens  and  has  an  abundance  of  sand  until  that
sand is also diverted down a submarine canyon.

Beach  Starvation Human  activities  have  altered  the  natural  system  of  beach
compartments. When a dam is built along one of the rivers that feed into a beach
compartment, it deprives the beach of sand. Lining rivers with concrete for flood
control further reduces the sediment load delivered to coastal regions. Longshore

Can submarine canyons fill with sediment?

Yes.  In  many  beach  compartments,  the  submarine
canyons  that  drain  sand  from  the  beach  empty  into
deep  basins  offshore.  However,  given  several  million
years  and  tons  of  sediments  per  year  sliding  down
submarine  canyons,  offshore  basins  begin  to  fill  up
and  can  eventually  be  exposed  above  sea  level.  In
fact, the Los Angeles basin in California was filled in
by  sediment  derived  from  local  mountains  in  this
manner during the geologic past.

Erosional shores are characterized by erosional fea-
tures such as cliffs, sea arches, sea stacks, and 
marine terraces. Depositional shores are character-
ized by depositional features such as spits, tombolos,
barrier islands, deltas, and beach compartments.

transport continues to sweep the shoreline s sand into the submarine canyons, so
the  beaches  become  narrower  and  experience  beach  starvation. If  all  the  rivers
are blocked, the beaches may nearly disappear.

What can be done to prevent beach starvation in beach compartments? One
obvious solution is to eliminate the dams, which would allow rivers to supply sand
to the beach and return beach compartments to a natural balance. However, most
dams  are  built  for  flood  protection, water  storage, and  the  generation  of  hy-
dropower, so  it  is  unlikely  that  many  will  be  removed. Another  option, called
beach nourishment, will be discussed later in this chapter.

10.4 How Do Changes in Sea Level

Produce Emerging and
Submerging Shorelines?

Shorelines can also be classified based on their position relative to sea level. Sea
level, however, has changed throughout time, intermittently exposing large regions
of  continental  shelf  and  then  plunging  them  back  under  the  sea. Sea  level  can
change  because  the  level  of  the  land  changes, the  level  of  the  sea  changes, or  a
combination  of  the  two. Shorelines  that  are  rising  above  sea  level  are  called
emerging  shorelines, and  those  sinking  below  sea  level  are  called  submerging
shorelines.

Features of Emerging Shorelines
Marine terraces (see Figures 10.6, 10.13, and 10.17) are one feature characteristic
of emerging shorelines. Marine terraces are flat platforms backed by cliffs, which
form when a wave-cut bench is exposed above sea level. Stranded beach deposits
and other evidence of marine processes may exist many meters above the present
shoreline, indicating that the former shoreline has risen above sea level.

Features of Submerging Shorelines
Features  characteristic  of  submerging  shorelines  include  drowned  beaches
(Figure 10.13), submerged dune topography, and drowned river valleys along the
present shoreline.

Changes in Sea Level
What  causes  the  changes  in  sea  level  that  produce  submerging  and  emerging
shorelines?  One mechanism is to raise or lower the land surface relative to sea
level through the movement of Earth s crust. Another mechanism is to affect the
level of the sea itself through worldwide changes in sea level.

MOVEMENT OF EARTH S CRUST The elevation of Earth s crust relative to sea
level can be affected by tectonic movements and by isostatic adjustment.2 These
are termed changes in relative sea level, because it s the land that has changed,
not the sea.

Tectonic  Movements The  most  dramatic  changes  in  sea  level  during  the  past
3000 years have been caused by tectonic movements, which affect the elevation of

299

the  land. These  changes  include  uplift  or  subsidence  of  major  portions  of
continents or ocean basins, as well as localized folding, faulting, or tilting of the
continental crust.

Most of the U.S. Pacific Coast, for example, is an emerging shoreline because
continental margins where plate collisions occur are tectonically active, producing
earthquakes, volcanoes, and  mountain  chains  paralleling  the  coast. Most  of  the
U.S. Atlantic Coast, on the other hand, is a submerging shoreline. When a conti-
nent moves away from a spreading center (such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge), its
trailing edge subsides because of cooling and the additional weight of accumulat-
ing  sediment. Passive  margins  experience  only  a  low  level  of  tectonic  deforma-
tion, earthquakes, and volcanism, making the Atlantic Coast far more quiet and
stable than the Pacific Coast.

Isostatic  Adjustment Earth s  crust  also  undergoes  isostatic  adjustment: It  sinks
under  the  accumulation  of  heavy  loads  of  ice, vast  piles  of  sediment, or
outpourings of lava, and it rises when heavy loads are removed.

For example, at least four major accumulations of glacial ice

and dozens of
smaller  ones have  occurred  in  high-latitude  regions  over  the  past  3  million
years. Although Antarctica is still covered by a very large, thick ice cap, much of
the ice that once covered northern Asia, Europe, and North America has melted.
The weight of ice sheets as much as 3 kilometers (2 miles) thick caused the
crust beneath to sink. Today, these areas are still slowly rebounding, 18,000 years
after the ice began to melt. The floor of Hudson Bay, for example, which is now
about 150 meters (500 feet) deep, will be close to or above sea level by the time it
stops isostatically rebounding. Another example is the Gulf of Bothnia (between
Sweden  and  Finland), which  has  isostatically  rebounded  275  meters  (900  feet)
during the last 18,000 years.

Generally, tectonic  and  isostatic  changes  in  sea  level  are  confined  to  a  seg-
ment of a continent s shoreline. For a worldwide change in sea level, there must
be a change in seawater volume or ocean basin capacity.

WORLDWIDE  (EUSTATIC)  CHANGES  IN  SEA  LEVEL Changes in sea level that
are  experienced  worldwide  due  to  changes  in  seawater  volume  or  ocean  basin
capacity are called eustatic (eu * good, stasis * standing)3 sea level changes. The
formation or destruction of large inland lakes, for example, causes small eustatic
changes in sea level. When lakes form, they trap water that would otherwise run
off  the  land  into  the  ocean, so  sea  level  is  lowered  worldwide. When  lakes  are
drained and release their water back to the ocean, sea level rises.

Another example of a eustatic change in sea level is through changes in sea
floor spreading rates, which can change the capacity of the ocean basin and affect
sea level worldwide. Fast spreading, for instance, produces larger rises, such as the
East Pacific Rise, which displace more water than slow-spreading ridges such as
the  Mid-Atlantic  Ridge. Thus, fast  spreading  raises  sea  level, whereas  slower
spreading  lowers  sea  level  worldwide. Significant  changes  in  sea  level  due  to
changes  in  spreading  rate  typically  take  hundreds  of  thousands  to  millions  of
years and may have changed sea level by 1000 meters (3300 feet) or more in the
geologic past.

Changes to Sea Level during Ice Ages Ice ages cause eustatic sea level changes,
too. As  glaciers  form, they  tie  up  vast  volumes  of  water  on  land, eustatically
lowering  sea  level. An  analogy  to  this  effect  is  a  sink  of  water  representing  an
ocean basin. To simulate an ice age, some of the water from the sink is removed
and frozen, causing the water level of the sink to be lower. In a similar fashion,

3The term eustatic refers to a highly idealized situation in which all of the continents remain static (in
good standing), while only the sea rises or falls.

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

Because of plate motions, I know that the continents
have not always remained in the same geographic
position. Has the movement of the continents ever
affected sea level?

Remarkably,  yes.  When  plate  motion  moves  large
continental masses into polar regions, thick continen-
tal glaciation can occur (such as in Antarctica today).
Glacial ice forms from water vapor in the atmosphere
(in the form of snow), which is ultimately derived from
the evaporation of seawater. Thus, water is removed
from  the  oceans  when  continents  assume  positions
close  to  the  poles  that  provide  a  platform  for  large
land-based  ice  accumulation,  thereby  lowering  sea
level worldwide.

FIGURE 10.14 Sea level change during the most recent
advance and retreat of Pleistocene glaciers. Sea level
dropped worldwide by about 120 meters (400 feet) as the last
glacial advance removed water from the oceans and transferred
it to continental glaciers. About 18,000 years ago, sea level began
to rise as the glaciers melted and water was returned to the
oceans.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Sea level is affected by the movement of land and
changes in seawater volume or ocean basin capac-
ity. Sea level has changed dramatically in the past
because of changes in Earth s climate.

worldwide sea level is lower during an ice age. During interglacial stages (such as
the one we are in at present), the glaciers melt and release great volumes of water
that  drain  to  the  sea, eustatically  raising  sea  level. This  would  be  analogous  to
putting the frozen chunk of ice on the counter near the sink and letting the ice
melt, causing the water to drain into the sink and raise  sink level.

During the Pleistocene Epoch,4 glaciers advanced and retreated many times
on land in middle- to high-latitude regions, causing sea level to fluctuate consider-
ably. The thermal contraction and expansion of the ocean as its temperature de-
creased and increased, respectively, affected sea level, too. The thermal contrac-
tion and expansion of seawater work much like a mercury thermometer: As the
mercury inside the thermometer warms, it expands and rises up the thermometer;
as it cools, it contracts. Similarly, cooler seawater contracts and occupies less vol-
ume, thereby  eustatically  lowering sea  level. Warmer  seawater  expands, eustati-
cally raising sea level.

For  every  1°C  (1.8°F)  change  in  the  average  temperature  of  ocean  surface
waters, sea  level  changes  about  2  meters  (6.6  feet). Microfossils  in  Pleistocene
ocean sediments suggest that ocean surface waters may have been as much as 5°C
(9°F)  lower  than  at  present. Therefore, thermal  contraction  of  the  ocean  water
may have lowered sea level by about 10 meters (33 feet).

Although it is difficult to state definitely the range of shoreline fluctuation
during  the  Pleistocene, evidence  suggests  that  it  was  at  least  120  meters
(400 feet) below the present shoreline (Figure 10.14). It is also estimated that if
all the remaining glacial ice on Earth were to melt, sea level would rise another
70 meters  (230  feet). Thus, the  maximum  sea  level  change  during  the
Pleistocene  would  have  been  on  the  order  of  190  meters  (630  feet), most  of
which  was  due  to  the  capture  and  release  of  Earth s  water  by  land-based
glaciers and polar ice sheets.

The combination of tectonic and eustatic changes in sea level is very complex,
so  it  is  difficult  to  classify  coastal  regions  as  purely  emergent  or  submergent.
In fact, most  coastal  areas  show  evidence  of  both submergence  and  emergence
in the  recent  past. Evidence  suggests, however, that  until  recently  sea  level  has
experienced only minor changes as a result of melting glacial ice during the last
3000 years.

More  recently, there  has  been  a  documented  sea  level  rise  as  a  result  of
human-induced climate change. This topic is discussed in Chapter 16, The Oceans
and Climate Change.

10.5 What Characteristics 

Do U.S. Coasts Exhibit?

Whether the dominant process along a coast is erosion or deposition depends on
the  combined  effect  of many variables, such as composition  of  coastal bedrock,
the degree of exposure to ocean waves, tidal range, tectonic subsidence or emergence,
isostatic subsidence or emergence, and eustatic sea level change.

Although  many  factors  contribute  to  shoreline  retreat, sea  level  rise  is  the
main  factor  driving  worldwide  coastal  land  loss. In  fact, more  than  70%  of  the
world s  sandy  beaches  are  currently  eroding, and  the  percentage  increases
to nearly  90%  for  well-studied  U.S. sandy  coasts. Studies  supported  by  the
U.S. Geological  Survey  produced  the  rates  of  shoreline  change  presented  in
Figure 10.15, where  erosion  rates  are  shown  as  negative values  and  deposition
rates are shown as positive values.

4The Pleistocene Epoch of geologic time, which is also called the  Ice Age, occurred 2.6 million to
10,000 years ago (see the Geologic Time Scale, Figure 1.24).

between 1979 and 1983 in meters per year.

The Atlantic Coast

Figure 10.15 shows that the U.S. Atlantic Coast has a variety of complex coastal
conditions:

Most of the Atlantic Coast is exposed to storm waves from the open ocean.
Barrier islands from Massachusetts southward, however, protect the mainland
from large storm waves.
Tidal ranges generally increase from less than 1 meter (3.3 feet) along the
Florida coast to more than 2 meters (6.5 feet) in Maine.
Bedrock for most of Florida is a resistant type of sedimentary rock called
limestone. Most of the bedrock northward through New Jersey, however, con-
sists of nonresistant sedimentary rocks formed in the recent geologic past. As
these rocks rapidly erode, they supply sand to barrier islands and other depo-
sitional features common along the coast. The bedrock north of New York
consists of very resistant rock types.
From New York northward, continental glaciers affected the coastal region
directly. Many coastal features, including Long Island and Cape Cod, are 
glacial deposits (called moraines) left behind when the glaciers melted.

North  of  Cape  Hatteras  in  North  Carolina, the  coast  is  subject  to  very  high-
energy waves during fall and winter when powerful storms called nor easters (north-
easters) blow in from the North Atlantic. The energy of these storms generates waves

FIGURE 10.16 Drowned river valleys. Satellite false-color
image of drowned river valleys along the East Coast of the
United States, including the Chesapeake and Delaware 
Bays, which were formed by a relative rise in sea level that
followed the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age.

up to 6 meters (20 feet) high, with a 1-meter (3.3-foot)
rise in sea level that follows the low pressure as it moves
northward. Such high-energy conditions seriously erode
coastlines that are predominantly depositional.

Sea  level  along  most  of  the  Atlantic  Coast  ap-
pears to be rising at a rate of about 0.3 meter (1 foot)
per  century. Drowned  river  valleys, for  instance, are
common  along  the  coast  and  form  large  bays
(Figure 10.16). In northern Maine, however, sea level
may be dropping as the continent rebounds isostati-
cally from the melting of the Pleistocene ice sheet.

The Atlantic Coast has an average annual rate of
erosion of 0.8 meter (2.6 feet), which means that sea is
migrating landward each year by a distance approxi-
mately  equal  to  the  length  of  your  legs!  In Virginia,
the loss is over five times that rate at 4.2 meters (13.7
feet) per year but is confined largely to barrier islands.
Erosion rates for Chesapeake Bay are about aver-
age for the Atlantic Coast, but rates for Delaware Bay
(1.6 meters [5.2 feet] per year) are about twice the av-
erage. Of  the  observations  made  along  the  Atlantic
Coast, 79% showed some degree of erosion. Delaware,
Georgia, and  New  York  have  depositional  coasts
despite serious erosion problems in these states as well.

The Gulf Coast
The Mississippi River Delta, which is deposited in an
area with a tidal range of less than 1 meter (3.3 feet),
dominates  the  Louisiana Texas  portion  of  the  Gulf
Coast. Except  during  the  hurricane  season  (June  to
November), wave  energy  is  generally  low. Tectonic
subsidence is common throughout the Gulf Coast, and
the average rate of sea level rise is similar to that of the
southeast Atlantic Coast, about 0.3 meter (1 foot) per
century. Some areas of coastal Louisiana have experi-
enced a 1-meter (3.3-foot) rise during the last century
due to the compaction of Mississippi River sediments
by overlying weight.

The average rate of erosion is 1.8 meters (6 feet) per year in the Gulf Coast.
The  Mississippi  River  Delta  experiences  the  greatest  rate, averaging  4.2  meters
(13.7 feet) per year. Erosion is made worse by barge channels dredged through
marshlands, and Louisiana has lost more than 1 million acres of delta since 1900.
Louisiana  is  now  losing  marshland  at  a  rate  exceeding  130  square  kilometers
(50 square miles) per year.

Although  all  Gulf  states  show  a  net  loss  of  land, and  the  Gulf  Coast  has  a
greater  erosion  rate  than  the Atlantic  Coast, only  63%  of  the  shore  is  receding
because of erosion. The high average rate of erosion reflects the heavy losses in
the Mississippi River Delta.

The Pacific Coast
The Pacific Coast is generally experiencing less erosion than the Atlantic and Gulf
Coasts.Along the Pacific Coast, relatively young and easily eroded sedimentary rocks
dominate the bedrock, with local outcrops of more resistant rock types. Tectonically,
the coast is rising, as shown by marine (wave-cut) terraces (Figure 10.17). Sea level

10.5 What Characteristics Do U.S. Coasts Exhibit?

still shows at least small rates of rise, except for segments
along  the  coast  of  Oregon  and Alaska. The  tidal  range  is
mostly between 2.0 and 3.6 meters (6.6 and 12 feet).

The  Pacific  Coast  is  fully  exposed  to  large  storm
waves and as a result is said to have open exposure. High-
energy waves may strike the coast in winter, with typical
wave  heights  of  1  meter  (3.3  feet). Frequently, the  wave
height increases to 2 meters (6.6 feet), and a few times per
year  6-meter  (20-foot)  waves  hammer  the  shore! These
high-energy  waves  erode  sand  from  many  beaches. The
exposed  beaches, which  are  composed  primarily  of  peb-
bles and boulders during the winter months, regain their
sand during the summer when smaller waves occur.

Many  Pacific  Coast  rivers  have  been  dammed  for
flood  control  and  hydroelectric  power  generation. The
amount  of  sediment  supplied  by  rivers  to  the  shoreline
for  longshore  transport  is  reduced, resulting  in  beach
starvation in some areas.

With  an  average  erosion  rate  of  only  0.005  meter
(0.016 foot)5 per year and only 30% of the coast showing
erosion loss, the Pacific Coast is eroded much less than
the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Nevertheless, high wave energy and relatively soft
rocks result in high erosion rates of 0.3 meters (1 foot) per year or more in some
parts of the Pacific Coast. In some parts of Alaska, for example, the average rate
of erosion is 2.4 meters (7.9 feet) per year.

Of the Pacific states, only Washington shows a net sediment deposition. The
long, protected Washington shoreline within Puget Sound helps skew the Pacific
Coast values (see Figure 10.15). Although the average erosion rate for California is
only 0.1 meter (4 inches) per year, over 80% of the California coast is experiencing
erosion, with rates as high as 0.6 meter (2 feet) per year.

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

I have the opportunity to live in a house at the edge of a coastal cliff where
there is an incredible view along the entire coast. Is it safe from coastal
erosion?

Based on what you ve described, most certainly not! Geologists have long known
that cliffs are naturally unstable. Even if cliffs appear to be stable (or have been
stable for a number of years), one significant storm can severely damage them.
The most common cause of coastal erosion is direct wave attack, which
undermines the support and causes the cliff to fail. You might want to check
the base of the cliff and examine the local bedrock to determine for yourself if
you think it will withstand the pounding of powerful storm waves that can move
rocks  weighing  several  tons.  Other  dangers  include  drainage  runoff,  weak-
nesses in the bedrock, slumps and landslides, seepage of water through the
cliff, and even burrowing animals. Although all states enforce a setback from
the edge of the cliff for all new buildings, sometimes that isn t enough because
large  sections  of  stable   cliffs  can  fail  all  at  once.  For  instance,  several  city
blocks of real estate have been eroded from the edge of cliffs during the last
100 years in some areas of Southern California. Even though the view sounds
outstanding, you may find out the hard way that the house is built a little too
close to the edge of a cliff!

50.005 meter is equal to 5 millimeters (0.2 inch).

FIGURE 10.17 Marine (wave-cut) terraces. Each marine
terrace on San Clemente Island offshore of Southern California
was created by wave activity at sea level. Subsequently, each
terrace has been exposed by tectonic uplift. The highest (oldest)
terraces near the top of the photo are now about 400 meters
(1320 feet) above sea level.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
U.S. coastal regions are affected by many variables,
including composition of the coastal bedrock, degree
of exposure to waves, and tidal range. Most U.S.
coastal regions are experiencing erosion.

10.6 What Is Hard
Stabilization?

Coastal  residents  continually  modify  coastal  sediment
erosion/deposition  in  attempts  to  improve  or  preserve
their  property. Structures  built  to  protect  a  coast  from
erosion  or  to  prevent  the  movement  of  sand  along  a
beach  are  known  as  hard  stabilization, or  armoring  of
the  shore. Hard  stabilization  can  take  many  forms  and
often results in predictable yet unwanted outcomes.

Groins and Groin Fields
One  type  of  hard  stabilization  is  a  groin (groin *
ground). Groins  are  built  perpendicular  to  a  coastline
and are specifically designed to trap sand moving along
the coast in longshore transport (Figure 10.18). They are
constructed of many types of material, but large blocks
of  rocky  material  called  rip-rap is  most  common.
Sometimes groins are even constructed of sturdy wood
pilings (similar to a fence built out into the ocean).

Although a groin traps sand on its upcoast side, ero-
sion occurs immediately downcoast of the groin because
the  sand  that  is  normally  found  just  downcoast  of  the
groin is trapped on the groin s upcoast side. To lessen the
erosion, another  groin  can  be  constructed  downcoast,
which  in  turn  also  creates  erosion  downcoast  from  it.
More groins are needed to alleviate the beach erosion,
and soon a groin field is created (Figure 10.19).

Does a groin (or a groin field) actually retain more
sand  on  the  beach?  Sand  eventually  migrates  around
the  end  of  the  groin, so  there  is  no  additional  sand  on
the beach; it is only distributed differently. With proper
engineering  and  by  taking  into  account  the  regional

Another  type  of  hard  stabi-
lization  is  a  jetty (jettee * to
project  outward). A  jetty  is
similar to a groin because it is built perpendicular to the shore and is usually con-
structed of rip-rap. The purpose of a jetty, however, is to protect harbor entrances
from waves and only secondarily does it trap sand (Figure 10.20). Because jetties
are usually built in closely spaced pairs and can be quite long, they can cause more
pronounced upcoast deposition and downcoast erosion than groins (Figure 10.21).

FIGURE 10.20 Effect of jetties and groins. Jetties pro-
tect a harbor entrance and usually occur in pairs. Groins are
built specifically to trap sand moving in the longshore trans-
port system and occur individually or as a groin field. Both
structures cause deposits of sand on their upcoast sides and
an equal amount of erosion downcoast.

Breakwaters

Figure  10.22 shows  a  breakwater hard  stabilization  built  parallel  to  a  shore-
line that  was  constructed  to  create  the  harbor  at  Santa  Barbara, California.
California s longshore drift is predominantly southward, so the breakwater on the
western  side  of  the  harbor  accumulated  sand  that  had
migrated  eastward  along  the  coast. The  beach  to  the
west  of  the  harbor  continued  to  grow  until  finally  the
sand moved around the breakwater and began to fill in
the harbor (Figure 10.22).

Coastal Stabilization

Structures

While  abnormal  deposition  occurred  to  the  west,
erosion proceeded at an alarming rate east of the har-
bor. The waves east of the harbor were no greater than
before, but the sand that had formerly moved down the
coast was now trapped behind the breakwater.

A  similar  situation  occurred  in  Santa  Monica,
California, where  a  breakwater  was  built  to  provide  a
boat  anchorage. A  bulge  in  the  beach  soon  formed
behind (inshore of) the breakwater and severe erosion
occurred  downcoast  (Figure  10.23). The  breakwater
interfered with the natural transport of sand by block-
ing  the  waves  that  used  to  keep  the  sand  moving. If
something was not done to put energy back into the sys-
tem, the  breakwater  would  soon  be  attached  by  a
tombolo of sand, and further erosion downcoast might
destroy coastal structures.

In  Santa  Barbara  and  Santa  Monica, dredging  was

used to compensate for erosion downcoast from the breakwater and to keep the
harbor or anchorage from filling with sand. Sand dredged from behind the break-
water is pumped down the coast so it can reenter the longshore drift and replenish
the eroded beach.

The Coast: Beaches and Shoreline Processes

The dredging operation has stabilized the situation in Santa Barbara, but at a
considerable  (and  ongoing)  expense. In  Santa  Monica, dredging  was  conducted
until  the  breakwater  was  largely  destroyed  during  winter  storms  in  1982 1983.
Shortly thereafter, wave energy was able to move sand along the coast again, and
the system was restored to normal conditions. When people interfere with natural
processes in the coastal region, they must provide the energy needed to replace
what they have misdirected through modification of the shore environment.

Seawalls
One of the most destructive types of hard stabilization is a seawall (Figure 10.24),
which is built parallel to the shore along the landward side of the berm. The pur-
pose  of  a  seawall  is  to  armor  the  coastline  and  protect  landward  developments
from ocean waves.

Once waves begin breaking against a seawall, however, turbulence generated
by  the  abrupt  release  of  wave  energy  quickly  erodes  the  sediment  on  its
seaward side, which can eventually cause it to collapse
into the surf (Figure 10.24). In many cases where sea-
walls  have  been  used  to  protect  property  on  barrier
islands, the  seaward  slope  of  the  island  beach  has
steepened and the rate of erosion has increased, caus-
ing the destruction of the recreational beach.

A  well-designed  seawall  may  last  for  many
decades, but  the  constant  pounding  of  waves  even-
tually  takes  its  toll  (Figure  10.25). In  the  long  run,
the  cost  of  repairing  or  replacing  seawalls  will  be
more  than  the  property  is  worth, and  the  sea  will
claim  more  of  the  coast  through  the  natural
processes  of  erosion. It s  just  a  matter  of  time  for
homeowners  who  live  too  close  to  the  coast, many
of  whom  are  gambling  that  their  houses  won t  be
destroyed in their lifetimes.

FIGURE 10.22 Breakwater at Santa Barbara Harbor,
California. Construction of a shore-connected breakwater
at Santa Barbara Harbor interfered with the longshore drift,
creating a broad beach. As the beach extended around the
breakwater into the harbor, the harbor was in danger of
being closed off by accumulating sand. As a result, dredging
operations were initiated to move sand from the harbor
downcoast, where it helped reduce coastal erosion.

10.7 What Alternatives to Hard

Stabilization Exist?

Is it better to preserve the houses of a few people who have built too close to the
shore at the expense of armoring the coast with hard stabilization and destroying
the recreational beach? If you own coastal property, your response would proba-
bly  be  different  from  the  general  beachgoing  public. Because  hard  stabilization
has been shown to have negative environmental consequences, alternatives have
been sought.

Construction Restrictions

One  of  the  simplest  alternatives  to  the  use  of  hard  stabilization  is  to  restrict
construction  in  areas  prone  to  coastal  erosion. Unfortunately, this  is  becoming
less  and  less  an  option  as  coastal  regions  experience  population  increases  and
governments increase the risk of damage and injuries because of programs like
the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Since its inception in 1968, NFIP
has  paid  out  billions  of  dollars  in  federal  subsidy  to  repair  or  replace  high-risk

damaged by waves and needs repair. Although seawalls appear to be sturdy, they can be
destroyed by the continual pounding of high-energy storm waves.

coastal structures. As a result, NFIP has actually encouraged construction in ex-
actly the unsafe locations it was designed to prevent!6 Further, many homeowners
spend large amounts of money rebuilding structures and fortifying their property.

Beach Replenishment
Another  alternative  to  hard  stabilization  is  beach  replenishment (also  called
beach nourishment), in which sand is added to the beach to replace lost sediment
(Figure 10.26). Although rivers naturally supply sand to most beaches, dams on
rivers restrict the sand supply that would normally arrive at beaches. When dams
are built, their effect on beaches far downcoast is rarely considered. It s not until
beaches begin disappearing that the rivers are seen as parts of much larger systems
that operate along the coast.

Beach  replenishment  is  expensive, however, because  huge  volumes  of  sand
must be continually supplied to the beach. The cost of beach replenishment depends
on the type and quantity of material placed on the beach, how far the material
must be transported, and how it is to be distributed on the beach. Most sand used
for  replenishment  comes  from  offshore  areas, but  sand  that  is  dredged  from
nearby rivers, drained dams, harbors, and lagoons is also used.

The average cost of sand used to replenish beaches is between $5 and $10 per
0.76 cubic meter (1 cubic yard). In comparison, a typical top-loading trash dumpster
holds about 2.3 cubic meters (3 cubic yards) of material, and a typical dump truck
has a volume of about 45 cubic meters (60 cubic yards). The drawbacks of beach re-
plenishment projects are that a huge volume of sand must be moved and that new

6Recent changes in regulations of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which
oversees NFIP, are intended to curb this practice.

FIGURE 10.26 Beach replenishment. Beach replenishment
projects, such as this one in Carlsbad, California, are used to
widen beaches. Beach replenishment involves dredging sand
from offshore or coastal locations, pumping it through a pipe
(lower right), and spreading it across the beach.

sand  must  be  supplied  on  a  regular  basis. These  problems  often  cause
replenishment  projects  to  exceed  the  monetary  limits  of  what  can  be  reasonably
accomplished. For example, a small beach replenishment project of several hundred
cubic meters can cost around $10,000 per year. Larger projects
several thousand
cubic meters of sand cost several million dollars per year.

Relocation
U.S. coastal policy has recently shifted from defending coastal property in high-
hazard areas to removing structures and letting nature reclaim the beach. This ap-
proach is called relocation, which involves moving structures to safer locations as
they  become  threatened  by  erosion. One  example  of  the  successful  use  of  this
technique  is  the  relocation  of  the  Cape  Hatteras  Lighthouse  in  North  Carolina
(see  Box  10.2). Relocation, if  used  wisely, can  allow  humans  to  live  in  balance
with the natural processes that continually modify beaches.

Chapter in Review

The coastal region changes continuously. The shore is the region of con-
tact between the oceans and the continents, lying between the lowest low
tides and the highest elevation on the continents affected by storm waves.
The coast extends inland from the shore as far as marine-related features
can  be  found. The  coastline marks  the  boundary  between  the  shore  and
the coast. The shore is divided into the foreshore, extending from low tide
to high tide, and the backshore, extending beyond the high tide line to the
coastline. Seaward  of  the  low  tide  shoreline  are  the  nearshore zone, ex-
tending to the breaker line, and the offshore zone beyond.

A beach is a deposit of the shore area, consisting of wave-worked sedi-
ment  that  moves  along  a  wave-cut  bench. It  includes  the  recreational
beach, berm, beach face, low tide terrace, one or more longshore bars, and
longshore  trough. Beaches  are  composed  of  whatever  material  is  locally
available.

Waves that break at the shore move sand perpendicular to shore (toward
and away from shore). In light wave activity, swash dominates the transport
system and  sand  is  moved  up  the  beach  face  toward  the  berm. In  heavy
wave activity, backwash dominates the transport system and sand is moved
down the beach face away from the berm toward longshore bars. In a nat-
ural system, there is a balance between light and heavy wave activity, alter-
nating  between  sand  piled  on  the  berm  (summertime  beach)  and  sand
stripped from the berm (wintertime beach), respectively.

Sand is moved parallel to the shore, too. Waves breaking at an angle to
the shore create a longshore current that results in a zigzag movement of
sediment  called  longshore  drift (longshore  transport). Each  year, millions
of tons of sediment are moved from upcoast to downcoast ends of beaches.
Most of the year, longshore drift moves southward along both the Pacific
and Atlantic shores of the United States.

Erosional  shores  are  characterized  by  headlands, wave-cut  cliffs, sea
caves, sea  arches, sea  stacks, and  marine  terraces (caused  by  uplift  of  a
wave-cut bench). Wave erosion increases as more of the shore is exposed
to the open ocean, tidal range decreases, and bedrock weakens.

Depositional  shores  are  characterized  by  beaches, spits, bay  barriers,
tombolos, barrier  islands, deltas, and  beach  compartments. Viewed  from
ocean side to lagoon side, barrier islands commonly have an ocean beach,
dunes, barrier flat, and salt marsh. Deltas form at the mouths of rivers that

carry  more  sediment  to  the  ocean  than  the  longshore  current  can  carry
away. Beach  starvation occurs  in  beach  compartments  and  other  areas
where the sand supply is interrupted.

Shorelines  can  also  be  classified  as  emerging  or  submerging  based  on
their  position  relative  to  sea  level. Ancient  wave-cut  cliffs  and  stranded
beaches well above the present shoreline may indicate a drop in sea level
relative to land. Old drowned beaches, submerged dunes, wave-cut cliffs,
or drowned river valleys may indicate a rise in sea level relative to land.
Changes in sea level may result from tectonic processes causing local move-
ment  of  the  landmass  or  from  eustatic  processes  changing  the  amount  of
water in the oceans or the capacity of ocean basins. Melting of continental
ice caps and glaciers during the past 18,000 years has caused a eustatic rise
in sea level of about 120 meters (400 feet).

Sea level is rising along the Atlantic Coast about 0.3 meter (1 foot) per
century, and the average erosion rate is 0.8 meter (2.6 feet) per year. Along
the Gulf Coast, sea level is rising 0.3 meter (1 foot) per century, and the av-
erage rate of erosion is 1.8 meters (6 feet) per year. The Mississippi River
Delta is eroding at 4.2 meters (13.7 feet) per year, resulting in a large loss
of wetlands every year. Along the Pacific Coast, the average erosion rate is
only 0.005 meter (0.016 foot) per year. Different shorelines erode at differ-
ent  rates  depending  on  wave  exposure, amount  of  uplift, and  type  of
bedrock.

Hard  stabilization, such  as  groins, jetties, breakwaters, and  seawalls, is
often constructed in an attempt to stabilize a shoreline. Groins (built to trap
sand)  and  jetties (built  to  protect  harbor  entrances)  widen  the  beach  by
trapping  sediment  on  their  upcoast  side, but  erosion  usually  becomes  a
problem downcoast. Similarly, breakwaters (built parallel to a shore) trap
sand  behind  the  structure  but  cause  unwanted  erosion  downcoast.
Seawalls (built  to  armor  a  coast)  often  cause  loss  of  the  recreational
beach. Eventually, the  constant  pounding  of  waves  destroys  all  types  of
hard stabilization.

Alternatives  to  hard  stabilization include  construction  restrictions in
areas prone to coastal erosion, beach replenishment (beach nourishment),
which is an expensive and temporary way to reduce beach starvation, and
relocation, which is a technique that has been successfully used to protect
coastal structures

perience large changes in

tion patterns; coastal wet-
lands are also important
ecosystems.

point-source pollution (road

non-native species.

THE COASTAL OCEAN

The coastal ocean is a very busy place, filled with life, commerce, recreation, fisheries, and waste. Of
the world fishery,1 about 95% is obtained within 320 kilometers (200 miles) of shore. Coastal waters
also support about 95% of the total mass of life in the oceans. Further, coastal estuary and wetland
environments are among the most biologically productive ecosystems on Earth and serve as nursery
grounds for many species of marine organisms that inhabit the open ocean. In addition, these waters
are the focal point of most shipping routes, oil and gas production, and recreational activities.

Coastal waters are also the conduits through which land-derived compounds must pass to reach
the open ocean. Numerous chemical, physical, and biological processes occur in these environments
that tend to protect the quality of the water in the open ocean. The ocean has a tremendous ability to
assimilate  waste  materials, yet  negative  results  are  beginning  to  be  felt  worldwide. Recently, the
effects  of  cumulative  stresses  on  the  oceans  have  become  large  enough  for  humans  to  finally
acknowledge the finiteness and fragility of the world environment. In the United States, for example,
comprehensive  reports  such  as  the  U.S. Commission  on  Ocean  Policy  and  the  Pew  Oceans
Commission have identified an emerging national crisis regarding damage being done to ocean and
coastal resources, calling for a plan of action to restore coastal environments.

Earth s  rapidly  expanding  human  population  has  put  an  ever-increasing  stress  on  the  marine
environment. Human  activities  are  increasingly  altering  coastal  environments  in  two  main  ways:
(1) the destruction of coastal ecosystems through development and exploitation and (2) the addition
of  land-based  waste  products  into  coastal  waters. Pollution  in  coastal  waters  comes  from  many
sources, such  as  accidental  spills  of  petroleum, the  accumulation  of  sewage, and  certain  chemicals
either  alone  or  in  combination  with  each
(such  as  DDT, PCBs, and  mercury). These  pollutants
other often have severe deleterious effects on marine organisms.

In  this  chapter, we ll  first  examine  the  legal  framework  of  who  owns  the  ocean. Then  we ll
explore the properties of coastal waters before discussing how they re being affected and what can
be done to reduce or eliminate pollution from coastal waters.

11.1 What Laws Govern Ocean Ownership?
Who owns the ocean? Who owns the sea floor? If a company wanted to drill for oil offshore between
two different countries, would it have to obtain permission from either country? The current extraction
of  minerals  and  petroleum  on  the  coastal  sea  floor  necessitates  laws  that  unambiguously  answer
these questions. Further offshore, exploration and development of marine resources is also occurring

The Coastal Ocean

far from the jurisdiction of any country. Furthermore, overfishing and pollution
are  worsening. Are  these  kinds  of  problems  covered  by  long-established  laws?
The answer is yes . . . and no.

Mare Liberum and the Territorial Sea
In 1609, Hugo Grotius, a Dutch jurist and scholar whose writings eventually helped
formulate international law, urged freedom of the seas to all nations in his treatise
Mare liberum (mare * sea, liberum * free), which was premised on the assumption
that  the  sea s  major  known  resource fish exists  in  inexhaustible  supply.
Nevertheless, controversy continued over whether nations could control a portion
of an ocean, such as the ocean adjacent to a nation s coastline.

Dutch  jurist  Cornelius  van  Bynkershoek  attempted  to  solve  this  problem  in
De dominio maris (de * of, dominio * domain, maris * sea) published in 1702. It
provided for national domain over the sea out to the distance that could be pro-
tected by cannons from the shore, an area called the territorial sea. Just how far
from shore did the territorial sea extend? The British had determined in 1672 that
cannon range extended 1 league (3 nautical miles) from shore. Thus, every country
with a coastline maintained ownership over a three-mile territorial limit from shore.

Law of the Sea
In  response  to  new  technology  that  facilitated  mining  the  ocean  floor, the  first
United  Nations  Conference  on  the  Law  of  the  Sea, held  in  1958  in  Geneva,
Switzerland, established that prospecting and mining of minerals on the continen-
tal shelf was under the control of the country that owned the nearest land. Because
the continental shelf is that portion of the sea floor extending from the coastline to
where the slope markedly increases, the seaward limit of the shelf is subject to in-
terpretation. Unfortunately, the  continental  shelf  was  not  well  defined  in  the
treaty, which led to disputes. In 1960, the second United Nations Conference on the
Law  of  the  Sea  was  also  held  in  Geneva, but  it  made  little  progress  toward  an
unambiguous and fair treaty concerning ownership of the coastal ocean.

Meetings  of  the  third  Law  of  the  Sea  Conference  were  held  during  1973

1982. A  new  Law  of  the  Sea  treaty  was  adopted  by  a  vote  of  130  to  4, with  17
abstentions. Most  developing  nations  that  could  benefit  significantly  from  the
treaty voted to adopt it. The United States, Turkey, Israel, and Venezuela opposed
the new treaty because it made sea floor mining unprofitable.The abstaining countries
included  the  Soviet  Union, Great  Britain, Belgium, the  Netherlands, Italy, and
West Germany, all of which were interested in sea floor mining, too. Nevertheless,
the treaty was ratified by the required 60th nation in 1993, establishing it as inter-
national  law. Negotiations  removed  the  objections  of  nations  interested  in  sea
floor mining, and the United States signed the revised treaty in 1994. Despite the
fact that 153 coastal nations have ratified the treaty and have made it the definitive
word  on  coastal  law, the  United  States  has  still  not  officially  ratified  it, which
means that the United States doesn t have the legal right to extend its maritime
claims or hold a seat on the commission that reviews the plans of other countries.
Recently, U.S. policymakers have advocated ratifying the treaty.

The  Law  of  the  Sea  treaty  specifies  how  coastal  nations  watch  over  their
natural  resources, settle  maritime  boundary  disputes, and especially  in  the
Arctic
extend their rights to any riches on or beneath the adjacent sea floor. The
primary components of the treaty are as follows:

1. Coastal  nations  jurisdiction. The  treaty  established  a  uniform  12-mile
(19-kilometer)  territorial  sea  and  a  200-nautical-mile  (370-kilometer)
exclusive  economic  zone  (EEZ) from  all  land  (including  islands)  within  a
nation. Each of the 151 coastal nations has jurisdiction over mineral resources,
fishing, and  pollution  regulation  within  its  EEZ. If  the  continental  shelf

(defined  geologically)  exceeds  the  200-mile  EEZ, the  EEZ  is
extended to 350 nautical miles (648 kilometers) from shore.

also  provided  within  territorial  seas  and  through
straits used for international navigation.

3. Deep-ocean  mineral  resources. Private exploita-
tion  of  sea  floor  resources  may  proceed  under
the  regulation  of  the  International  Seabed
Authority (ISA), within which a mining company
will be strictly controlled by the United Nations.
This provision, which caused some industrialized
nations  to  oppose  ratification, required  mining
companies to fund two mining operations
their
own and one operated by the regulatory United
Nations. Recently, this  portion  of  the  law  was
modified  to  eliminate  some  of  the  regulatory
components, thus  favoring  free  market  principles
and  development  by  private  companies. Still, this
portion of the Law of the Sea has been one of the most
contentious issues in international law.

4. Arbitration of disputes. A United Nations Law of the Sea tribunal will arbi-

trate any disputes in the treaty or disputes concerning ownership rights.

The  Law  of  the  Sea  puts  42%  of  the  world s  oceans  under  the  control  of
coastal  nations. The  EEZ  of  the  United  States  consists  of  about  11.5  million
square  kilometers  (4.2  million  square  miles)  (Figure  11.1), which  is  about  30%
more than the entire land area of the United States and its territories. This huge
offshore area is widely believed to have tremendous economic potential.

11.2 What Characteristics Do Coastal

Waters Exhibit?

Coastal waters are those relatively shallow-water areas that adjoin continents or
islands. If the continental shelf is broad and shallow, coastal waters can extend sev-
eral hundred kilometers from land. If it has significant relief or drops rapidly onto
the  deep-ocean  basin, on  the  other  hand, coastal  waters  will  occupy  a  relatively
thin band near the margin of the land. Beyond coastal waters lies the open ocean.
Because of their proximity to land, coastal waters are directly influenced by
processes that occur on or near land. River runoff and tidal currents, for example,
have a far more significant effect on coastal waters than on the open ocean.

Salinity
Freshwater is less dense than seawater, so river runoff does not mix well with sea-
water along the coast. Instead, the freshwater forms a wedge at the surface, which
creates a well-developed halocline2 (Figure 11.2a). When water is shallow enough,
however, tidal  mixing  causes  freshwater  to  mix  with  seawater, thus  reducing  the
salinity of the water column (Figure 11.2c). There is no halocline here; instead, the
water column is isohaline (iso * same, halo * salt).

Freshwater runoff from the continents generally lowers the salinity of coastal
regions compared to the open ocean. Where precipitation on land is mostly rain,

in Chapter 5.

river  runoff  peaks  in  the  rainy  season. Where
runoff is due mainly to melting snow and ice, on
the other hand, runoff always peaks in summer.
Prevailing  offshore  winds  can  increase  the
salinity  in  some  coastal  regions. As  winds  travel
over a continent, they usually lose most of their
moisture. When these dry winds reach the ocean,
they typically evaporate considerable amounts of
water  as  they  move  across  the  surface  of  the
coastal  waters. The  increased  evaporation  rate
increases  surface  salinity, creating  a  halocline
(Figure  11.2b). The  gradient  of  the  halocline,
however, is reversed compared to the one devel-
oped from the input of freshwater (Figure 11.2a).

Temperature
In low-latitude coastal regions, where circulation
with the open ocean is restricted, surface waters
are prevented from mixing thoroughly, so sea surface temperatures may approach
45°C  (113°F)  (Figure  11.3a). Alternatively, sea  ice  forms  in  many  high-latitude
coastal areas where water temperatures are uniformly cold generally lower than
- 2°C
(28.4°F)  (Figure  11.3b). In  both  low-  and  high-latitude  coastal  waters,
isothermal (iso * same, thermo * heat) conditions prevail.

Surface temperatures in middle latitude coastal regions are coolest in winter
and  warmest  in  late  summer. A  strong  thermocline3 may  develop  from  surface
water  being  warmed  during  the  summer  (Figure  11.3c)  and  cooled  during  the

FIGURE 11.4 Davidson coastal geostrophic current.
The Davidson Current is a coastal geostrophic current that
flows north along the coast of Washington and Oregon.
During the winter, runoff produces a freshwater wedge 
(light blue) that thins away from shore. This causes a surface
flow of low-salinity water toward the open ocean, which is
acted upon by the Coriolis effect and curves to the right.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
The shallow coastal ocean adjoins land and experi-
ences changes in salinity and temperature that are
more dramatic than the open ocean. Coastal
geostrophic currents can also develop.

winter (Figure 11.3d). In summer, very high-temperature surface water may form
a relatively thin layer. Vertical mixing reduces the surface temperature by distrib-
uting the heat through a greater volume of water, thus pushing the thermocline
deeper and making it less pronounced. In winter, cooling increases the density of
surface water, which causes it to sink.

Prevailing  offshore  winds  can  significantly  affect  surface  water  temperatures.
These winds are relatively warm during the summer, so they increase the ocean sur-
face temperature and seawater evaporation. During winter, they are much cooler
than  the  ocean  surface, so  they  absorb  heat  and  cool  surface  water  near  shore.
Mixing from  strong  winds  may  drive  the  thermoclines  in  Figures  11.3c and 11.3d
deeper  and  even  mix  the  entire  water  column, producing  isothermal  conditions.
Tidal currents can also cause considerable vertical mixing in shallow coastal waters.

Coastal Geostrophic Currents
Recall  from  Chapter  7 that  geostrophic (geo * earth, strophio * turn)  currents
move in a circular path around the middle of a current gyre. Wind and runoff cre-
ate  geostrophic  currents  in  coastal  waters, too, where  they  are  called  coastal
geostrophic currents.

Where winds blow in a certain direction parallel to a coastline, they transport
water toward the coast where it piles up along the shore. Gravity eventually pulls
this  water  back  toward  the  open  ocean. As  it  runs  downslope  away  from  the
shore, the  Coriolis  effect  causes  it  to  curve  to  the  right  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere  and  to  the  left  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere. Thus, in  the  Northern
Hemisphere, the coastal geostrophic current curves northward on the western coast
and southward on the eastern coast of continents. These currents are reversed in
the Southern Hemisphere.

A high-volume runoff of freshwater produces a surface wedge of freshwater
that slopes away from the shore (Figure 11.4). This causes a surface flow of low-
salinity water toward the open ocean, which the Coriolis effect curves to the right
in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.

Coastal geostrophic currents are variable because they depend on the wind and
the  amount  of  runoff  for  their  strength. If  the  wind  is  strong  and  the  volume  of
runoff is high, then the currents are relatively strong.They are bounded on the ocean
side by the steadier eastern or western boundary currents of subtropical gyres.

An  example  of  a  coastal  geostrophic  current  is  the  Davidson  Current that
develops along the coast of Washington and Oregon during winter (Figure 11.4).
Heavy  precipitation  (which  produces  high  volumes  of  runoff)  combines  with
strong southwesterly winds to produce a relatively strong northward-flowing cur-
rent. It flows between the shore and the southward-flowing California Current.

11.3 What Types of Coastal 

Waters Exist?

The most important types of coastal waters include estuaries, lagoons, and mar-
ginal seas.

Estuaries
An estuary (aestus * tide) is a partially enclosed coastal body of water in which
freshwater runoff dilutes salty ocean water. The most common estuary is a river
mouth, where the river empties into the sea. Many bays, inlets, gulfs, and sounds
may be considered estuaries, too. All estuaries exhibit large variations in tempera-
ture and/or salinity.

The  mouths  of  large  rivers  form  the  most  economically  significant  estuaries
because many are seaports, centers of ocean commerce, and important commercial

ORIGIN OF ESTUARIES The estuaries of today exist because sea level has risen
approximately  120  meters  (400  feet)  since  major  continental  glaciers  began
melting  18,000  years  ago. As  described  in  Chapter  10, these  glaciers  covered
portions  of  North  America, Europe, and  Asia  during  the  Pleistocene  Epoch,
which  is  also  referred  to  as  the  Ice Age. Four  major  classes  of  estuaries  can  be
identified based on their origin (Figure 11.5):

1. A coastal plain estuary forms as sea level rises and floods existing river val-
leys. These estuaries, such as the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia,
are called drowned river valleys (see Figure 10.16).

2. A fjord4 forms as sea level rises and floods a glaciated valley. Water-carved
valleys  have  V-shaped  profiles, but  fjords  are  U-shaped  valleys  with  steep
walls. Commonly, a  shallowly  submerged  glacial  deposit  of  debris  (called  a
moraine) is located near the ocean entrance, marking the farthest extent of
the  glacier. Fjords  are  common  along  the  coasts  of  Alaska, Canada, New
Zealand, Chile, and Norway (Figure 11.6a).

3. A bar-built estuary is shallow and is separated from the open ocean by sand
bars that are deposited parallel to the coast by wave action. Lagoons that sep-
arate barrier islands from the mainland are bar-built estuaries. They are com-
mon along the U.S. Gulf and East Coasts, including Laguna Madre in Texas
and Pamlico Sound in North Carolina (see Figure 10.9).

WATER MIXING IN ESTUARIES Generally, freshwater
runoff  moves  across  the  upper  layer  of  the  estuary
toward  the  open  ocean, whereas  denser  seawater
moves  in  a  layer  just  below  toward  the  head  of  the
estuary. Mixing  takes  place  at  the  contact  between
these water masses.

Estuaries  are  marine  environments  whose  pH,
salinity, and water levels vary, depending on the mix-
ing  between  the river that feeds the  estuary  and  the
ocean from which it derives its salinity. Based on the
physical characteristics of the estuary and the result-
ing  mixing  of  freshwater  and  seawater, estuaries  are
classified  into  one  of  four  main  types, as  shown  in
Figure 11.7:

arrows indicate flow directions.

;

1. A  vertically  mixed  estuary is  a  shallow, low-volume  estuary  where  the  net
flow always proceeds from the head of the estuary toward its mouth. Salinity
at any point in the estuary is uniform from surface to bottom because river
water mixes evenly with ocean water at all depths. Salinity simply increases
from the head to the mouth of the estuary, as shown in Figure 11.7a. Salinity
lines curve at the edge of the estuary because the Coriolis effect influences
the inflow of seawater.

2. A  slightly  stratified  estuary is  a  somewhat  deeper  estuary  in  which  salinity
increases from the head to the mouth at any depth, as in a vertically mixed
estuary. However, two water layers can be identified. One is the less-saline,
less-dense upper water from the river, and the other is the more saline, more
dense deeper water from the ocean. These two layers are separated by a zone
of mixing. The circulation that develops in slightly stratified estuaries is a net
surface flow of low-salinity water toward the ocean and a net subsurface flow
of seawater toward the head of the estuary (Figure 11.7b), which is called an
estuarine circulation pattern.

3. A  highly  stratified  estuary is  a  deep  estuary  in  which  upper-layer  salinity
increases from the head to the mouth, reaching a value close to that of open-
ocean water. The deep-water layer has a rather uniform open-ocean salinity
at  any  depth  throughout  the  length  of  the  estuary. An  estuarine  circulation
pattern is well developed in this type of estuary (Figure 11.7c). Mixing at the
interface  of  the  upper  water  and  the  lower  water  creates  a  net  movement
from  the  deep-water  mass  into  the  upper  water. Less-saline  surface  water
simply moves from the head toward the mouth of the estuary, growing more
saline as water from the deep mass mixes with it. Relatively strong haloclines
develop at the contact between the upper and lower water masses.

4. A  salt  wedge  estuary is  an  estuary  in  which  a  wedge  of  salty  water  intrudes
from the ocean beneath the river water. This kind of estuary is typical of the
mouths of deep, high-volume rivers. No horizontal salinity gradient exists at the
surface  because  surface  water  is  essentially  fresh  throughout  the  length  of
and even beyond the estuary (Figure 11.7d). There is, however, a  horizontal
salinity  gradient  at  depth  and  a  very  pronounced  vertical  salinity  gradient
(a halocline) at any location throughout the length of the estuary.This halocline
is shallower and more highly developed near the mouth of the estuary.

320

Chapter 11

The Coastal Ocean

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Estuaries were formed by the rise in sea level after the
last ice age. They can be classified based on origin as
coastal plain, fjord, bar built, or tectonic. Estuaries can
also be classified based on mixing as vertically mixed,
slightly stratified, highly stratified, or salt wedge.

Within all estuaries, the predominant mixing pattern may vary with location,
season, or tidal conditions. In addition, mixing patterns in real estuaries are rarely
as simple as the models presented here.

ESTUARIES AND HUMAN ACTIVITIES Estuaries are important breeding grounds
and protective nurseries for many marine animals, so the ecological well-being of
estuaries  is  vital to  fisheries and coastal  environments  worldwide. Nevertheless,
estuaries  support  shipping, logging, manufacturing, waste  disposal, and  other
activities that can potentially damage the environment.

Estuaries are most threatened where human population is large and expand-
ing, but  they  can  be  severely  damaged  where  populations  are  still  modest, too.
Development  in  the  Columbia  River  estuary, for  example, demonstrates  how  a
relatively small population can damage an estuary.

Columbia River Estuary The Columbia River, which forms most of the border
between Washington and Oregon, has a long salt-wedge estuary at its entrance to
the Pacific Ocean (Figure 11.8). The strong flow of the river and tides drive a salt
wedge as far as 42 kilometers (26 miles) upstream and raise the river s water level
more than 3.5 meters (12 feet). When the tide falls, the huge flow of freshwater
(up to 28,000 cubic meters [1,000,000 cubic feet] per second) creates a freshwater
wedge that can extend hundreds of kilometers into the Pacific Ocean.

Most rivers create floodplains along their lower courses, which have rich soil
that can be used for growing crops. In the late 19th century, farmers moved onto
the  floodplains  to  establish  agriculture  along  the  Columbia  River. Eventually,
protective dikes were built to prevent agricultural damage done by annual flood-
ing. Flooding brings new nutrients, however, so the dikes deprived the floodplain
of the nutrients necessary to sustain agriculture.

The river has been the principal conduit for the logging industry, which domi-
nated the region s economy through most of its modern history. Fortunately, the
river s  ecosystem  has  largely  survived  the  additional  sediment  caused  by  clear
cutting by the logging industry. The construction of more than 250 dams along the
river  and  its  tributaries, on  the  other  hand, has  permanently  altered  the  river s
ecosystem. Many of these dams, for example, do not have salmon ladders, which
help fish  climb in short vertical steps around the dams to reach their spawning
grounds at the headwaters of their home streams.

Even though the dams have caused a multitude of
problems, they  do  provide  flood  control, electrical
power, and  a  dependable  source  of  water, all  of  which
have become necessary to the region s economy. To aid
shipping operations, the river receives periodic dredging
of sediment, which brings an increased risk for pollution.
If  these  kinds  of  problems  have  developed  in  such
sparsely populated areas as the Columbia River estuary,
then  larger  environmental  effects  must  exist  in  more
highly populated estuaries, such as the Chesapeake Bay.

FIGURE 11.8 Columbia River estuary. The long estuary
at the mouth of the Columbia River has been severely affected
by interference with floodplains that have been diked, by log-
ging activities, and most significantly by the construction
of hydroelectric dams. The tremendous outflow of the
Columbia River creates a large wedge of low-density fresh-
water that remains traceable far out at sea.

Chesapeake  Bay  Estuary Chesapeake  Bay  is  about
320  kilometers  (200  miles)  long  and  56  kilometers
(35 miles)  wide  at  its  widest  point, making  it  the
largest (and best studied) estuary in the United States
(Figure  11.9). It  drains  a  watershed  of  about  166,000  square  kilometers  (64,000
square miles) spread over six states that includes a population of over 15 million
people. The  length  of  the  bay s  shoreline  is  an  astonishing  17,700  kilometers
(11,000  miles)  because  of  all  the  inlets  created  by  the  19  major  rivers  and
400 creeks and tributaries that flow into it.The bay formed when the lower parts of the
Susquehanna River were drowned by rising sea level after the most recent ice age.

Chesapeake Bay is a slightly stratified estuary that experiences large seasonal
changes  in  salinity, temperature, and  dissolved  oxygen. Figure  11.9a shows  the
estuary s  average  surface  salinity, which  increases  oceanward. The  salinity  lines
are oriented virtually north south in the middle of the bay because of the Coriolis
effect. Recall that the Coriolis effect causes flowing water to curve to the right in
the  Northern  Hemisphere, so  seawater  entering  the  bay  tends  to  hug  the  bay s
eastern side, and freshwater flowing through  the  bay toward  the ocean tends  to
hug its western side.

With maximum river flow in the spring, a strong halocline (and pycnocline5)
develops, preventing the fresh surface water and saltier deep water from mixing.
Beneath the pycnocline, which can be as shallow as 5 meters (16 feet), waters may
become anoxic (a * without, oxic * oxygen) from May through August, as dead
organic matter decays in the deep water (Figure 11.9b). Major kills of commer-
cially  important  blue  crab, oysters, and  other  bottom-dwelling  organisms  occur
during this time.

The degree of stratification and extent of mortality of bottom-dwelling ani-
mals have increased since the early 1950s. Increased nutrients from sewage and
agricultural fertilizers have been added to the bay during this time, too, which has
increased  the  productivity  of  microscopic  algae  (algal  blooms). When  these
organisms die, their remains accumulate as organic matter at the bottom of the
bay and promote the development of anoxic conditions. In drier years with less
river runoff, however, anoxic conditions aren t as widespread or severe in bottom
waters (Figure 11.9c) because fewer nutrients are supplied.

Lagoons
Landward of barrier islands lie protected, shallow bodies of water called lagoons
(see  Figure  11.5c). Lagoons  form  in  a  bar-built  type  of  estuary. Because  of
restricted  circulation  between  lagoons  and  the  ocean, three  distinct  zones  can
usually be identified within lagoons (Figure 11.10): (1) a freshwater zone that lies
near the head of the lagoon where rivers enter; (2) a transitional zone of brackish6
water that occurs near the middle of the lagoon, and (3) a saltwater zone that lies
close to the lagoon s mouth.

Salinity within a lagoon is highest near the entrance and lowest near the head
(Figure 11.10b). In latitudes that have seasonal variations in temperature and pre-
cipitation, ocean water flows through the entrance during a warm, dry summer to
compensate for the volume of water lost through evaporation, thus increasing the
salinity in the lagoon. Lagoons actually may become hypersaline7 in arid regions,
where  evaporation  rates  are  extremely  high. Even  though  water  flows  into  the
lagoon from the open ocean to replace water lost by evaporation, the dissolved
components do not evaporate and sometimes accumulate to extremely high lev-
els. During the rainy season, the lagoon becomes much less saline as freshwater
runoff increases.

Tidal effects are greatest near the entrance to the lagoon (Figure 11.10c) and
diminish inland from the saltwater zone until they are nearly undetectable in the
freshwater zone.

160  kilometers  (100  miles)  long. The  lagoon  probably  formed  about  6000  years
ago as sea level approached its present height.

The tidal range of the Gulf of Mexico in this area is about 0.5 meter (1.6 feet).
The inlets at each end of Padre Island are quite narrow (Figure 11.11), so there is
very little tidal interchange between the lagoon and the open sea.

Laguna  Madre  is  a  hypersaline  lagoon  and  much  of  it  is  less  than  1  meter
(3.3 feet) deep. As a result, there are large seasonal changes in temperature and
salinity. Water temperatures reach 32°C (90°F) in the summer and can dip below
 when infrequent local storms pro-
5°C (41°F) in winter. Salinities range from 2
vide large volumes of freshwater to over 100
 during dry periods. High evapora-
tion generally keeps salinity well above 50 .8

Because even salt-tolerant marsh grasses cannot withstand such high salini-
ties, the marsh has been replaced by an open sand beach on Padre Island. At the
inlets, ocean water flows in as a surface wedge over the denser water of the lagoon
and water from the lagoon flows out as a subsurface flow, which is the exact oppo-
site of a typical estuarine circulation pattern.

Marginal Seas
At the margins of the ocean are relatively large semi-isolated bodies of water called
marginal seas. Most of these seas result from tectonic events that have isolated low-
lying pieces of ocean crust between continents, such as the Mediterranean Sea, or
are created behind volcanic island arcs, such as the Caribbean Sea. These waters are
shallower than and have varying degrees of exchange with the open ocean, depend-
ing on climate and geography; as a result, salinities and temperatures are substan-
tially different from those of typical open ocean seawater.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
High evaporation rates in the Mediterranean Sea
cause it to have a shallow inflow of surface seawater
and a subsurface high-salinity outflow a circulation
pattern opposite that of most estuaries.

A  CASE  STUDY:  THE  MEDITERRANEAN  SEA The  Mediterranean  (medi *
middle, terra * land) Sea is actually a number of small seas connected by narrow
necks of water into one larger sea. It is the remnant of the ancient Tethys Sea that
existed when all the continents were combined about 200 million years ago. It is
more than 4300 meters (14,100 feet) deep and is one of the few inland seas in the
world underlain by oceanic crust. Thick salt deposits and other evidence on the
floor of the Mediterranean suggest that it nearly dried up about 6 million years
ago, only to refill with a large salt water waterfall (see Web Box 4.1).

The Mediterranean is bounded by Europe and Asia Minor on the north and
east and Africa to the south (Figure 11.12a). It is surrounded by land except for
very shallow and narrow connections to the Atlantic Ocean through the Strait
of Gibraltar (about 14 kilometers [9 miles] wide), and to the Black Sea through
the  Bosporus  (roughly  1.6  kilometers  [1  mile]  wide). In  addition,
the
Mediterranean  Sea  has  a  human-made  passage  to  the  Red  Sea  via  the  Suez
Canal, a waterway 160 kilometers (100 miles) long that was completed in 1869.
The  Mediterranean  Sea  has  a  very  irregular  coastline, which  divides  it  into
subseas such as the Aegean Sea and Adriatic Sea, each of which has a separate
circulation pattern.

An underwater ridge called a  sill, which extends from Sicily to  the coast of
Tunisia  at  a  depth  of  400  meters  (1300  feet), separates  the  Mediterranean  into
two major basins. This sill restricts the flow between the two basins, resulting in
strong  currents  that  run  between  Sicily  and  the  Italian  mainland  through  the
Strait of Messina (Figure 11.12a).

Mediterranean  Circulation The  Mediterranean  Sea  has  a  very  unusual  and
unique  circulation  pattern. This  circulation  is  caused  by  the  dry, intense  heat  of

 It is still denser than even
Antarctic  Bottom  Water  and  much  denser  than  water  at  this  depth  in  the
Atlantic  Ocean, so  it  moves  down  the  continental  slope. While  descending, it
mixes  with Atlantic Ocean water  and becomes less  dense. At  a depth  of about
1000  meters  (3300  feet)  its  density  equals  that  of  the  surrounding  Atlantic
Ocean, so it spreads in all directions (Figure 11.12b), sometimes forming deep-
ocean eddies that last for more than two years and can be detected by satellite as
far north as Iceland.

Circulation between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean is typical
of closed, restricted basins where evaporation exceeds precipitation. Low-latitude
restricted basins such as this always lose water rapidly to evaporation, so surface
flow from the open ocean must replace it. Evaporation of inflowing water from
the open ocean increases the sea s salinity to very high values. This denser water
eventually sinks and returns to the open ocean as a subsurface flow.

This  circulation  pattern, which  is  called  Mediterranean  circulation, is
opposite that of most estuaries, which experience estuarine circulation where
freshwater  flows  at  the  surface  into  the  open  ocean  and  salty  water  flows
below  the  surface  into  the  estuary. In  estuaries, however, freshwater  input
exceeds water loss to evaporation, whereas evaporation exceeds input in the
Mediterranean.

How can Mediterranean Intermediate Water sink if
its so warm?

While  it  is  true  that  warm  water  has  low  density, 
remember  that both salinity  and  temperature  affect
seawater  density.  In  the  case  of  the  Mediterranean
Intermediate Water, it has high enough salinity to in-
crease its density despite being warm. Once its den-
sity  increases  enough,  it  sinks  beneath  the  surface
and  retains  its  temperature  and  salinity  characteris-
tics as it flows out through the Strait of Gibraltar into
the North Atlantic.

11.4 What Issues Face Coastal

Wetlands?

Wetlands are ecosystems in which the water table is close to the surface, so they
are typically saturated most of the time. Wetlands can border either freshwater or
coastal environments. Coastal wetlands occur along the margins of coastal waters
such  as  estuaries, lagoons, and  marginal  seas  and  include  swamps, tidal  flats,
coastal marshes, and bayous.

Types of Coastal Wetlands
The two most important types of coastal wetlands are salt marshes and mangrove
swamps. Both are intermittently submerged by ocean water, and both have oxygen-
poor mud and accumulations of organic matter called peat deposits. Salt marshes
support a variety of salt-tolerant grasses and other low-lying plants that are termed
halophytic (halo * salt, phyto * plant), while mangrove  swamps  support various
species  of  mangrove  trees. Salt  marshes  generally  occur  between  about  30  and
65 degrees latitude (Figures 11.13a and 11.13b), whereas mangroves are restricted
to tropical regions (below 30 degrees latitude; Figures 11.13a and 11.13c).

Characteristics of Coastal Wetlands
Wetlands are some of the most highly productive ecosystems on Earth and pro-
vide  enormous  economic  benefits  when  left  alone. Salt  marshes, for  example,
serve as nurseries for more than half the species of commercially important fishes
in the southeastern United States. Other fish, such as flounder and bluefish, use
marshes  for  feeding  and  protection  during  the  winter. Fisheries  of  oysters, scal-
lops, clams, eels, and smelt are located directly in marshes, too. Mangrove ecosys-
tems are important nursery areas and habitats for commercially valuable shrimp,
prawn, shellfish, and fish species. Both marshes and mangroves also serve as im-
portant stopover points for many species of waterfowl and migrating birds.

Wetlands are amazingly efficient at cleansing polluted water. Just 0.4 hectare
(1 acre) of wetlands, for example, can filter up to 2,760,000 liters (730,000 gallons)
of water each year, cleaning agricultural runoff, toxins, and other pollutants long
before  they  reach  the  ocean. Wetlands  remove  inorganic  nitrogen  compounds
(from  sewage  and  fertilizers)  and  metals  (from  groundwater  polluted  by  land
sources), which become attached to clay-sized particles in wetland mud. Some ni-
trogen compounds trapped in sediment are decomposed by bacteria that release
the nitrogen to the atmosphere as gas, and many of the remaining nitrogen com-
pounds fertilize plants, further increasing the productivity of wetlands. As marsh
plants die, their remains either accumulate as peat deposits or are broken up to
become food for bacteria, fungi, and fish.

In addition, wetlands can also buffer coastal regions from flooding by absorb-
ing excess water and protect shorelines from erosion, particularly during severe
storms or tsunami. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, for example, devastated some
coastal  regions, yet  others  with  protective  offshore  coral  reefs  or  coastal  man-
groves experienced much less damage. And, the loss of protective coastal wetlands
in  the  Mississippi  River  Delta  contributed  to  the  extensive  flooding  associated
with the storm surge caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (see Box 6.2).

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Coastal wetlands such as salt marshes and man-
grove swamps are highly productive areas that
serve as important nurseries for many marine 
organisms and act as filters for polluted runoff.

Serious Loss of Valuable Wetlands
Despite all the benefits they provide, more than half of the nation s wetlands have
vanished. Of the original 87 million hectares (215 million acres) of wetlands that
once  existed  in  the  conterminous  United  States, only  about  43  million  hectares
(106 million acres) remain (Figure 11.14). Wetlands have been filled in and devel-

oped for housing, industry, and agriculture, because people want to live near the
oceans and because they often view wetlands as unproductive, useless land that
harbors diseases. In many places, wetlands loss is compounded by the lack of fresh
sediment from regular river floods. Instead, flooding rivers and their sediment are
channeled away from wetland areas.

Louisiana s  coastal  wetlands, for  example, are  among  those  that  are  steadily
disappearing. The soil in wetlands naturally compresses over time, a process called
subsidence. Normally, the growth of plants and the infusion of fresh sediment from
river  floodwaters  offset  subsidence. With  these  factors  reduced  or  eliminated,
many wetlands are sinking into the ocean faster than they are building up.

Other countries have experienced similar losses of wetlands, too. In fact, sci-
entists estimate that 50% of wetlands worldwide have been destroyed in the past
century. Mangroves, for example, are already critically endangered or approach-
ing extinction in 26 out of the 120 countries that have mangroves; the Philippines

alone has reported losing 70% of its original mangrove cover. At the current rate
of mangrove loss, there is increasing concern that all mangrove ecosystems world-
wide will be destroyed within the next 100 years.

To  help  prevent  the  loss  of  remaining  wetlands, the  U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) established an Office of Wetlands Protection (OWP) in
1986. At that time, wetlands were being lost to development at a rate of 121,000
hectares (300,000 acres) per year! As recently as 1997, the rate of coastal wetland
loss had slowed to  about 8100  hectares  (20,000  acres)  per year. The goal  of the
OWP  is  to  reduce  the  loss  of  wetlands  in  the  U.S. to  zero  by  actively  enforcing
regulations against wetlands pollution and identifying the most valuable wetlands
to be protected or restored.

Recent  trends  suggest  an  overall  increase  in  U.S. wetlands. In  fact, a  study
from 1998 to 2004 revealed that the conterminous U.S. gained an estimated 13,000
hectares (32,000 acres) of wetlands each year. This small gain was primarily due to
the large increase in freshwater wetlands; coastal wetlands were found to still be
decreasing, but at a slower rate than previously. The fact that coastal regions were
losing wetlands despite the national trend of a net gain in wetlands points to the
need for more research on the natural and human forces behind these trends and
to an expanded effort on conservation of wetlands, particularly in coastal areas.

A rise in sea level is predicted to exacerbate the loss of wetlands. Even using
a conservative estimate of sea level rise over the next 100 years of 50 centimeters
(20  inches), it  is  estimated  that  38%  to  61%  of  existing  U.S. coastal  wetlands
would  be  lost. Some  of  this  wetland  loss, however, would  be  partially  offset  by
new  wetland  formation  on  former  upland  areas, although  even  under  ideal
circumstances not all lost wetlands would be replaced.

11.5 What Is Pollution?
As  the  use  of  coastal  areas  has  increased  for  residences, recreation, and  com-
merce, pollution of coastal waters has increased as well.

Marine Pollution: A Definition
Pollution can broadly be defined as  any  harmful  substance, but how do scientists
determine which substances are harmful? For example, a substance may be estheti-
cally unappealing to people yet is not harmful to the environment. Conversely, cer-
tain types of pollution cannot easily be detected by humans, yet they can do harm to
the environment. A substance may not immediately be harmful, but it may cause
harm  years, decades, or  even  centuries  later. Also, to  whom  must  this  harm  be
done? For instance, some marine species thrive when exposed to a particular com-
pound that is quite toxic to other species. Interestingly, natural conditions in coastal
waters, such as dead seaweed on the beach, may be considered  pollution by some
people. It should be remembered, however, that although nature may produce con-
ditions we dislike, it does not pollute. The amount of a pollutant is also important: If
a substance that causes pollution is present in extremely tiny amounts, can it still be
characterized as a pollutant? All of these questions are difficult to answer.

The World Health Organization defines pollution of the marine environment

as follows:

The  introduction  by  man, directly  or  indirectly, of  substances  or  energy
into the marine environment, including estuaries, which results or is likely
to result in such deleterious effects as harm to living resources and marine
life, hazards  to  human  health, hindrance  to  marine  activities, including
fishing and other legitimate uses of the sea, impairment of quality for use
of sea water and reduction of amenities.

It  is  often  difficult  to  determine  the  degree  to  which  pollution  affects  the
marine environment. Most areas  were not studied  sufficiently before they were

polluted, so scientists do not have an adequate baseline from which to determine
how pollutants have altered the marine environment. The marine environment is
affected  by  decade-  to  century-long  cycles, too, so  it  is  difficult  to  determine
whether a change is due to a natural biologic cycle or any number of introduced
pollutants, many of which combine to produce new compounds.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Marine pollution is difficult to define but includes 
any human-induced substance that is harmful to 
the marine environment.

11.6 What Are the Main Types of Marine Pollution?

327

Environmental Bioassay
One of the most widely used techniques for determining the concentration of pol-
lutants that negatively affect the living resources of the ocean is to conduct a care-
fully controlled experiment to assess how a particular pollutant impacts marine
organisms. Such  an  experiment  is  called  an  environmental  biological  assay, or
environmental  bioassay (bio * biologic, essaier * to  weigh  out). For  example,
regulatory agencies such as the U.S. EPA use an environmental bioassay to deter-
mine the concentration of a pollutant that causes 50% mortality among a specific
group of test organisms within a prescribed period of time. If a pollutant exceeds
a 50% mortality rate, then concentration limits are established for the discharge
of the pollutant into coastal waters.

There  are  several  drawbacks  to  using  a  specific  environmental  bioassay  to
draw general conclusions about a pollutant. One shortcoming is that it does not
predict the long-term effect of pollution on marine organisms. Another is that it
does  not  take  into  account  how  pollutants  may  combine  with  other  substances,
creating new types of pollutants. In addition, environmental bioassays are often
time-consuming, laborious, and organism-specific and so may result in data that
isn t applicable to other species.

The Issue of Waste Disposal in the Ocean
Waste disposal facilities on land (such as landfills) have limited capacities that are
already  being  exceeded  in  many  cases. Should  additional  waste  be  discarded  in
the  open  ocean?  Unlike  coastal  areas, the  open  ocean  has  mixing  mechanisms
(waves, tides, and currents) that distribute pollutants over a wide area
including
an entire ocean basin. Diluting pollutants often renders them less harmful. On the
other  hand, do  we  really  want  to  distribute  a  pollutant  across  an  entire  ocean
without knowing what its long-term effects might be?

Some experts believe that we should not dump anything in the ocean, while
others believe that the ocean can be a repository for many of society s wastes, as
long as proper monitoring is conducted. Unfortunately, there are no easy answers
and the issues are complex.What is clear is that more research is needed to assess the
impact of pollutants in the ocean.

11.6 What Are the Main Types of

Marine Pollution?

Marine pollution comes from substances such as petroleum, sewage, and various
chemical compounds, all of which can have severe deleterious effects on marine
organisms, particularly  in  coastal  environments. Generally, coastal  waters  are
more polluted than the open ocean because of two main reasons: (1) Most pollu-
tion from land is dumped into nearby coastal waters, and (2) coastal waters are
shallower and not as well circulated as the open ocean.

Petroleum
Major  oil  (petroleum)  spills  into  the  ocean  are  a  fact  of  our  modern  oil-powered
economy. Some oil spills are the result of loading/unloading accidents, collisions, or
tankers  running  aground, such  as  the  1989  spill  from  the  Exxon  Valdez in  Prince
William  Sound, Alaska  (Box  11.1). Although  large  spills  such  as  from  the  Exxon

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

Is dilution the solution to ocean pollution?

That s  certainly  a  catchy  phrase,  but  the  implications
are controversial. It suggests that the oceans can be
used as a repository for society s wastes, as long as
the wastes are diluted to the point that they no longer
threaten marine organisms (which is often difficult to
determine). Because the oceans are vast and consist
of a good solvent (water), they appear ideally suited to
this  disposal  strategy.  In  addition,  the  oceans  have
good mixing mechanisms (currents, waves, and tides),
which dilute many forms of pollution.

Air  pollution  was  once  viewed  in  a  similar  man-
ner.  Disposal  of  pollutants  into  the  atmosphere  was
thought  to  be  acceptable,  as  long  as  they  were  dis-
persed widely and high enough so tall smokestacks
were  constructed.  Over  time,  however,  pollutants
such as nitric acid and acid sulfates increased in the
atmosphere to the point that acid rain is now a prob-
lem.  The  ocean,  like  the  atmosphere,  has  a  finite
holding capacity for  pollutants  and  even  experts  dis-
agree on exactly how much that is.

As disposal sites on land begin to fill, the ocean
is increasingly evaluated as an area for disposal of so-
ciety s wastes. One thing that we can all do is to limit
the amount of waste we generate, alleviating some of
the  problem  of  where  to  put  waste.  It  is  likely,  how-
ever,  that  the  ocean  will  continue  to  be  used  as  a
dumping  ground  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Despite
many new disposal techniques, a long-term  solution
to ocean pollution hasn t yet appeared.

THE EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL: NOT THE WORST SPILL EVER

A  large  percentage  of  oil  enters  the
oceans  from  spills  by  tankers  and  trans-
portation  operations. One  of  the  most
publicized  oil  spills  was  from  the  super-
tanker  Exxon  Valdez, which  occurred  in
Prince William  Sound, Alaska, and  is  the
largest oil spill in U.S. territorial waters.

Crude  oil  produced  from  the  North
Slope  of  Alaska  is  carried  by  pipeline  to
the southern port of Valdez, Alaska, where
it  is  loaded  onto  supertankers  like  the
Exxon Valdez, which are capable of  hold-
ing  almost  200  million  liters  (53  million
gallons) when full. On March 29, 1989, the
tanker left Valdez with a full load of crude
oil  and  was  headed  toward  refineries  in
California. She was only 40 kilometers (25
miles)  out  of Valdez  when  the  ship s  offi-
cers noted icebergs from nearby Columbia
Glacier within the shipping channel. While
maneuvering around the icebergs, the ship

ran  aground  on  a  shallowly  submerged
rocky  outcrop  known  as  Bligh  Reef
(Figure  11A), rupturing  8  of  the  ship s  11
cargo  tanks. About  22%  of  her  cargo
almost 44 million liters (about 11.6 million
gallons)  of  oil
spilled  into  the  pristine
waters  of  Prince William  Sound, where  it
subsequently  spread  into  the  Gulf  of
Alaska  and  fouled  over  1775  kilometers
(1100 miles) of shoreline.

Estimates  suggest  that  at  least  1000
sea  otters  and  between  100,000  and
7000,000 seabirds were killed outright by
the spill based on an extrapolation of the
number  of  oiled  carcasses  that  were  col-
lected  on  beaches  and  from  the  water.
The area s remote location and the size of
the  affected  area  limit  an  accurate  ac-
counting of marine animal fatalities.

Immediately  after  the  spill, Exxon
spent  more  than  $2  billion  in  cleanup

efforts and another $900 million in subse-
quent  years  for  restoration. Absorbent
materials  and  skimming  devices  were
used  to  remove  oil  from  the  water,
whereas  super  hot  water  (60°C  [140°F])
sprayed  through  high-pressure  hoses  was
used to clean oil from the rocky beaches.
The  hot  water  removed  the  oil  but  also
killed  most  shoreline  organisms. Analysis
of  the  cleanup  effort, when  compared  to
areas  that  were  left  to  biodegrade  natu-
rally, reveals  that  the  beaches  that  were
left  alone  recovered  more  quickly  and
more  completely 
the  cleaned
beaches.

pockets of undegraded oil rest just below
the  surface  of  some  beaches  and  in
coastal  wetlands. Experts  state  that  ma-
rine animals are  no longer  at  risk of  ex-
posure  to  toxic  oil  and  that  natural
processes  will  continue  to  biodegrade
the remaining oil.

As  large  and  damaging  as  the  Exxon
Valdez spill  was, it  ranks  as  only  the  53rd
largest oil spill worldwide (Table 11A). The
world s largest oil spill occurred because of
intentional  dumping  by  the  Iraqi  army
during their invasion of Kuwait during the
1991  Persian  Gulf  War. By  the  time  the

Iraqi  were  driven  out  of  Kuwait  and  the
leaking oil wells and sabotaged production
facilities were brought under control, more
than 908 million liters (240 million gallons)
of  oil  had  spilled  into  the  Persian  Gulf
(Figure  11B) more  than  20  times the
amount spilled by the Exxon Valdez.

Valdez occur infrequently, smaller-scale spills are more common. In fact, nearly 100
documented spills of at least 3800 liters (1000 gallons) of oil and more than 10,000
smaller spills have been reported annually in U.S. waters. Other oil spills are inten-
tionally created, such as the oil that was spilled during the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
Still others are caused by the blowout of undersea oil wells during drilling or pump-
ing. The  largest  such  spill  occurred  in  June  1979  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico, when  the

and oil slick that affected the Texas coast. The well blew out,
caught fire, and flowed for 10 months, spilling 530 million
liters (140 million gallons) of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.
The accident produced the world s largest oil spill from an 
oil well.

Petroleus Mexicanos (PEMEX) oil-drilling station Ixtoc #1 in the Bay of Campeche
off  the Yucatán  peninsula, Mexico, blew  out  and  caught  fire. Before  it  was  capped
nearly 10 months later, it spewed 530 million liters (140 million gallons) of oil into the
Gulf of Mexico, some of which washed up along the coast of Texas (Figure 11.15).

Oil is a mixture of various hydrocarbons, which means it is composed of the ele-
ments hydrogen and carbon. Hydrocarbons are organic substances, so they can be
broken down or biodegraded by microorganisms. Because hydrocarbons are largely
biodegradable, many  marine  pollution  experts  consider  oil  to  be  among  the  least
damaging pollutants introduced into the ocean! Certainly oil spills appear ghastly as
the oil coats the water, the shore, and helpless marine organisms including seabirds,
and it can cause grievous short-term damage. But oil dissipates and breaks down, be-
coming food for various microbes. As an example, vast quantities of oil were spilled
in the Pacific and, especially, the Atlantic during World War II. In fact, some U.S. East
Coast beaches were coated by oil several centimeters deep, yet not a trace of those
spills  remains  today. In  a  broader  view, some  natural  undersea  oil  seeps  have  oc-
curred  for  millions  of  years, and  the  ocean  ecosystem  seems  unaffected or  even
enhanced by them (because oil is a source of energy). As we ll see, other types of
pollutants last far longer and can do much more damage than an oil spill.

Data from the Exxon Valdez oil spill are a case in point. The oil spill released
almost 44 million liters (11.6 million gallons) of oil into a pristine wilderness area
in Alaska. The affected waters were expected to have a long, slow recovery, but the
fisheries that closed in 1989 bounced back with record takes in 1990. A study con-
ducted 10 years after the spill revealed that several key species had rebounded to
the point where their numbers were greater than before the spill (Figure 11.16).

organisms in the Prince William Sound area of Alaska

The bald eagle is so numerous that it was removed from 
the endangered species list in 1996. The collapse of the 
Pacific herring s population is thought to be unrelated to 
effects of the oil spill.

11.6 What Are the Main Types of Marine Pollution?

331

Recent research on the long-term effects of the spill, however, reveals that a signif-
icant amount of poorly weathered oil remains in intertidal subsurface sediments
and is still affecting marine ecosystems. Because of Alaska s relatively cold subarc-
tic climate, the spilled oil is biodegrading very slowly, so it will continue to be an
ecological problem for decades.

Another concern is that oil is a complex mixture of various hydrocarbons and
other  substances, including  the  elements  oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and  various
trace  metals. When  this  complex  chemical  mixture  combines  with  seawater
another  complex  chemical  mixture, which  also  contains  organisms
the  results
are usually devastating for marine organisms. Many are killed outright when they
are coated by oil, rendering their insulating feathers or fur useless (Figure 11.17).
There is also concern about the long-term effects of oil spills, such as chronic, de-
layed, or indirect impacts, many of which are often difficult to document and link to
the spill because of the considerable time lag. For example, the 2002 spill in the Bay of
Biscay north of Spain caused by the ruptured oil tanker Prestige, which leaked an es-
timated 26.5 million liters (7 million gallons) of fuel oil, will cause negative impacts to
the  region s  shorelines  and  fisheries  for  years  to  come. Another  example  is  the  oil
tanker that ran aground in the Galápagos Islands in 2001, spilling roughly 3 million
liters (800,000 gallons) of diesel and bunker oil. The oil spread westward and was dis-
persed  by  strong  currents, so  only  a  few  marine  animals  were  immediately  killed.
Marine iguanas on a nearby island, however, suffered a massive 62% mortality in the
year after the accident, due to a small amount of residual oil contamination in the sea.
In addition, spills from oil tankers may release a wide variety of petroleum
products (not just crude oil), each of which contains different concentrations of
toxic  (toxicum * poison)  compounds9 and  behaves  differently  in  the  environ-
ment. For example, refined oil such as fuel oil is rich in compounds that are much
more toxic to the environment than crude oil.

Although spills from oil tankers receive much media attention, they are not
the primary source of oil to the oceans. Figure 11.18 shows that 47% of worldwide
oil to the oceans is caused by underwater natural oil seeps (many of which occur
in  U.S. waters); the  remaining  53%  comes  from  human  sources. The  figure  also
shows that of human-caused oil to the oceans, 72% comes from petroleum con-
sumption, which includes nontank vessels, runoff from increasingly paved urban
areas, and individual car, boat, and watercraft owners; 22% comes from petroleum
transportation, including refining and distribution activities; and only 6% comes
from petroleum extraction, which are activities associated with oil and gas explo-
ration or production. Remarkably, the overwhelming majority of the petroleum
that enters the oceans due to human activity is a result of small but frequent and
widespread releases of oil related to activities that consume petroleum.

CLEANING OIL SPILLS When oil enters the ocean, it initially floats because oil is
less  dense  than  water  and  forms  a  slick  at  the  surface, where  it  starts  to  break
down through natural processes (Figure 11.19). The volatile, lighter components
of  crude  oil  evaporate  over  the  first  few  days, leaving  behind  a  more  viscous
substance  that  aggregates  into  tar  balls  and  eventually  sinks. The  tarry  oil  also
coats suspended particles, which settle to the sea floor, too.

If the floating oil hasn t dispersed, it can be collected with specially designed
skimmers or absorbent materials. The collected oil (or oiled materials), however,
must  still  be  disposed  of  elsewhere. Waves, winds, and  currents  serve  to  further
disperse an oil slick and mix the remaining oil with water to make a frothy emul-
sion  called  mousse. In addition, bacteria and photooxidation act  to break  down
the oil into compounds that dissolve in water.

Microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi naturally biodegrade oil, so they
can be used to help clean oil spills a method called bioremediation (bio * biologic,

by chemical means.

FIGURE 11.17 A bird covered by oil from the Exxon

oil from an oil spill, their feathers or fur lose their insulation
properties, resulting in high fatality rates. Some marine 
organisms such as this cormorant were rescued and cleaned
of oil.

vidual car and boat owners, nontank vessels, and runoff from
increasingly paved urban areas. Surprisingly, combined petro-
leum transportation and extraction account for only 28% of
all human-caused oil to the oceans.

remedium * to  heal  again). Virtually  all  marine  ecosystems
harbor  naturally  occurring  bacteria  that  degrade  hydrocar-
bons. Although certain types of bacteria and fungi can break
down  particular  kinds  of  hydrocarbons, none  is  effective
against  all  forms. In  1980, however, microbiologists  discov-
ered a microorganism capable of breaking down nearly two-
thirds of the hydrocarbons in most crude oil spills.

Releasing bacteria directly into the marine environment
is  one  form  of  bioremediation. For  example, a  strain  of  oil-
degrading  bacteria  was  released  into  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  to
test  its  effectiveness  in  cleaning  up  about  15  million  liters
(4 million gallons) of crude oil spilled after an explosion dis-
abled the tanker Mega Borg in 1990. Preliminary results indicate
that the bacteria reduced the amount of oil with no negative
effects on the ecology due to the bacteria.

Providing  conditions  that  stimulate  the  growth  of  natu-
rally  occurring  oil-degrading  bacteria  is  another  form  of
bioremediation. Exxon, for example, spent $10 million dollars
to  spread  fertilizers  rich  in  phosphorus  and  nitrogen  on
Alaskan shorelines to boost the growth of indigenous oil-eat-
ing bacteria after the Exxon Valdez spill (Box 11.1). The resulting cleanup rate was
more than twice that under natural conditions.

PREVENTING OIL SPILLS One of the best ways to protect areas from oil spills is
to prevent spills  from occurring in the  first place. Because our society relies on
petroleum  products, however, oil  spills  are  a  likely  occurrence  in  the  future
(Figure 11.20), especially as petroleum reserves beneath the continental shelves
of the world are increasingly exploited.

After the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, Congress enacted the Oil Pollution
Act of 1990, which defined responsibility for fiscal damage and cleanup. The act
also phased  out single-hulled oil  tankers traveling in U.S. waters and  mandated
double-hulled construction. Currently, single-hulled tankers are now barred from
U.S. ports, while European countries such as France and Spain do not allow them
within 320 kilometers (200 miles) of their coast. The double hull houses two lay-
ers: An  inner  hull  can  prevent  oil  spillage  if  damage  should  occur  to  the  outer
hull. Studies of hull designs during groundings and collisions indicate that double-
hull designs are more effective overall at reducing oil spills. However, analysis of
the Exxon Valdez spill suggests that even a double-hulled tanker would not have
prevented  the  disaster. Tanker  designs  are  also  being  modified  to  limit  the
amount of oil spilled should there be a hull rupture.

In  February  1999, the  Japanese-owned  freighter  M/V  New  Carissa ran
aground just offshore of Coos Bay, Oregon, with nearly 1,500,000 liters (400,000
gallons) of tarlike fuel oil aboard and began leaking oil through cracks in its hull.
When the ship washed into the surf zone and an approaching storm threatened to
tear it apart, federal and state authorities decided to ignite the vessel and its fuel
rather than risk a larger oil spill (Figure 11.21). This was the first time that oil on a
ship in U.S. waters was intentionally burned to prevent an oil spill. Eventually, the
ship split in two and about half of its oil burned, limiting the amount of oil spilled
into the ocean. Most of the remaining oil was sunk with the wrecked ship a month
later when it was towed offshore and sunk in water 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) deep
by Naval gunfire and a torpedo.

Sewage Sludge
Another  main  type  of  marine  pollution  is  sewage  sludge. Sewage  treated  at  a
facility typically undergoes primary treatment, where solids are allowed to settle
and  dewater, and  secondary  treatment, where  it  is  exposed  to  bacteria-killing

FIGURE 11.19 Processes acting on oil spills. After an
oil spill enters the ocean, it is acted upon by various natural
processes that break up the spill. The lighter components
evaporate, while the heavier components form tar balls or
coat suspended particles and sink. The remaining dispersed
oil photo oxidizes or can mix with water, creating a frothy
substance called  mousse.

chlorine. Sewage  sludge  is  the  semisolid  material  that  remains  after  such  treat-
ment. It contains a toxic brew of human waste, oil, zinc, copper, lead, silver, mer-
cury, pesticides, and other chemicals. Since the 1960s, at least 500,000 metric tons
(550,000 short tons) of sewage sludge have been dumped into the coastal waters
of  Southern  California, and  more  than  8  million  metric  tons  (8.8  million  short
tons)  have  been  dumped  in  the  New York  Bight  between  Long  Island  and  the
New Jersey shore.

Although  the  Clean Water Act  of  1972  prohibited  the  dumping  of  sewage
into the ocean after 1981, the high cost of treating and disposing of sewage sludge
on  land  resulted  in  extension  waivers  being  granted  to  many  municipalities. In
the summer of 1988, however, nonbiodegradable debris including medical waste
probably carried by heavy rains into the ocean through storm drains washed up
on Atlantic coast beaches and adversely affected the tourist business. Although
this event was completely unrelated to sewage disposal at sea, it focused public
awareness  on  ocean  pollution  and  helped  pass  new  legislation  to  terminate
sewage disposal at sea.

NEW  YORK S  SEWAGE  SLUDGE  DISPOSAL  AT  SEA Sewage  sludge  from  New
York  and  Philadelphia  has  traditionally  been  transported  offshore  by  barge  and
dumped in the ocean at sites totaling 150 square kilometers (58 square miles) within
the New York Bight Sludge Site and the Philadelphia Sludge Site (Figure 11.22).

The water depth is about 29 meters (95 feet) at the New York Bight Sludge
Site and about 40 meters (130 feet) at the Philadelphia Sludge Site. The water col-
umn in such shallow water is relatively uniform, so even the smallest sludge parti-
cles  reach  the  bottom  without  undergoing  much  horizontal  transport, and  the
ecology of the dump site can be severely affected. At the very least, such a con-
centration of organic and inorganic matter seriously disrupts the chemical cycling
of nutrients. Greatly reduced species diversity results, and in some locations the
environment becomes devoid of oxygen (anoxic).

In  1986, the  shallow-water  sites  were  abandoned, and  sewage  was  subse-
quently  transported  to  a  deep-water  site  171  kilometers  (106  miles)  out  to  sea
(Figure 11.22). The deep-water site is beyond the continental shelf break, so there
is  usually  a  well-developed  density  gradient  that  separates  low-density, warmer
surface water from high-density, colder deep water. Internal waves moving along
this density gradient can horizontally transport particles at rates 100 times greater
than they sink.

Local fishermen reported adverse effects on their fisheries soon after deep-
water  dumping  began. Also, concern  was  expressed  that  the  sewage  could  be
transported great distances in eddies of the Gulf Stream (see Chapter 7), even as
far as the coast of the United Kingdom. This program was terminated in 1993, and
municipalities must now dispose of their sewage on land.

BOSTON  HARBOR  SEWAGE  PROJECT Some  48  different  communities  that
comprise the greater Boston area have, until recently, used an antiquated sewage
system  to  dump  sludge  and  partially  treated  sewage  at  the  entrance  to  Boston
Harbor. Tidal  currents  often  swept  the  sewage  back  into  the  bay, and  at  other
times, the system became overloaded and dumped raw sewage directly into the
bay, making Boston Harbor one of the most polluted bays in the country.

A court-ordered cleanup of Boston Harbor in the 1980s resulted in the con-
struction of a new waste treatment facility at Deer Island that came online in 1998.
It  treats  all  sewage  with  bacteria-killing  chlorine  and  carries  it  through  a tunnel
15.3 kilometers (9.5 miles) long into deeper waters offshore (Figure 11.23a), which
prevents it from returning to the bay. Since the cleanup of Boston Harbor, beaches
have  reopened, clammers  are  digging  again, and  marine  life including  harbor
seals, porpoises, and even whales has returned. To pay for the $3.8 million sewage
system, however, the  average annual  sewage  bill for  a Boston-area  household  is
now about $1200, more than five times what it used to be.

oil from spilling into the ocean.

Ive heard that some organizations want to lift the
ban on DDT. Why would they want to do that?

Since  production  of  DDT  was  banned  in  1971,  out-
breaks of malaria have dramatically increased because
DDT was the most effective and readily available pes-
ticide  used  to  kill  mosquitoes  that  transmit  malaria.
According to the World Health Organization, malaria
infects  up  to  500  million  people  a  year mostly  in
tropical  regions and  kills  as  many  as  2.7  million,
including at least one child every 30 seconds. In addi-
tion, drug-resistant strains of malaria have begun to
show  up  worldwide.  This  resurgence  of  malaria  has
caused  many  health  organizations  to  call  for  an
exception  to  the  ban  on  DDT despite  its  well-
documented  perseverance  and  negative  effects  on
the environment so that it can be used selectively to
spray  houses  in  malaria-prone  areas  like  tropical
Africa  and  Indonesia.  The  ambitious  2008  Global
Malaria  Action  Plan  seeks  to  eliminate  all  malaria
deaths by 2015 through research into vaccines and
the use of bed nets, drugs, and spraying.

Some  fear  that  the  project  will  degrade  the  environment  in  Cape  Cod  Bay
and Stellwagen Bank (Figure 11.23b), which is an important whale habitat. The
area s recent designation as a National Marine Sanctuary may affect the feasibil-
ity of dumping there.

DDT and PCBs
The pesticide DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) and the industrial chemi-
cals called PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) are now found throughout the ma-
rine  environment. They  are  persistent, biologically  active  chemicals  that  have
been introduced into the oceans entirely as a result of human activities. Because
of  their  toxicity, long  life, and  propensity  for  being  accumulated  in  food  chains,
these  and  other  chemicals  have  been  classified  as  persistent  organic  pollutants
(POPs) capable of causing cancer, birth defects, and other grave harm.

DDT  was  widely  used  in  agriculture  during  the  1950s  and  improved  crop
production  throughout  developing  countries  for  several  decades. However, its
extreme effectiveness as an insecticide and persistence as a toxin in the environ-
ment eventually resulted in a host of environmental problems including devastat-
ing effects on marine food chains.

PCBs are industrial chemicals that were once widely used as a liquid coolant
and insulation in industrial equipment such as power transformers, where they were
released into the environment. PCBs were also widely used in wiring, paints, caulk-
ing, hydraulic oils, carbonless copy paper, and a host of other products. PCBs have
been shown to cause liver cancer and harmful genetic mutations in animals. PCBs
can also affect animal reproduction: They have been indicated as causes of sponta-
neous abortions in sea lions and the death of shrimp in Escambia Bay, Florida.

DDT AND EGGSHELLS Since 1972, the EPA has banned the use of DDT in the
United  States. Worldwide, the  pesticide  is  banned  from  agricultural  use, but  it
continues to be used in limited quantities for public health purposes. Ironically,
U.S. companies continue to produce DDT and supply it to other countries.

11.6 What Are the Main Types of Marine Pollution?

The danger of excessive use of DDT and similar pesticides first became apparent
in  the  marine  environment  when  it  affected  marine  bird  populations. During  the
1960s, there was a serious decline in the brown pelican population of Anacapa Island
off Southern California (Figure 11.24). High concentrations of DDT in the fish eaten
by the birds had caused them to produce eggs with excessively thin shells.

The osprey is a common bird of prey in coastal waters that is similar to a large
hawk. The osprey population of Long Island Sound declined in the late 1950s and
1960s because DDT contamination caused them to produce eggs with thin shells,
too. Since  the  ban  on  DDT, the  osprey, brown  pelican, and  many  other  species
affected by the chemical are making remarkable comebacks.

DDT AND PCBs LINGER IN THE ENVIRONMENT DDT and PCBs (which were
banned  in  1977)  generally  enter  the  ocean  through  the  atmosphere  and  river
runoff. They are initially concentrated in the thin slick of organic chemicals at the
ocean  surface, and  then  they  gradually  sink  to  the  bottom, attached  to  sinking
particles. A  study  off  the  coast  of  Scotland  indicated  that  open-ocean
concentrations of DDT and PCBs are 10 and 12 times less, respectively, than in
coastal  waters. Long-term  studies  have  shown  that  DDT  residue  in  mollusks
along the U.S. coasts peaked in 1968.

Although most countries have banned their use, DDT and PCBs are so per-
vasive in the marine environment that even Antarctic marine organisms contain
measurable  quantities  of  them. There  has  been  no  agriculture  or  industry  in
Antarctica to introduce them directly, so they must have been transported from
distant sources by winds and ocean currents.

Mercury and Minamata Disease
The  metal  mercury, which  is  a  silvery  liquid  at  room  temperature, has  many
industrial uses. When it enters the ecosystem, however, mercury forms an organic
compound (methyl mercury) that is generally toxic to most living things.

A  chemical  plant  built  in  1938  on  Minamata  Bay, Japan, produced  acetalde-
hyde, which  requires  mercury  in  its  manufacture. Mercury  was  discharged  into
Minamata Bay, where bacteria degraded it into methyl mercury that was later in-
gested and concentrated in the tissues of larger marine or-
ganisms. The  first  ecological  changes  in  Minamata  Bay
were  reported  in  1950  and  human  effects  were  noted  as
early as 1953. The mercury poisoning that is now known
as Minamata disease became epidemic in 1956, when the
plant was only 18 years old.

Minamata disease is a degenerative neurological dis-
order  that  affects  the  human  nervous  system  and  causes
sensory disturbances including blindness and tremor, brain
damage, birth defects, paralysis, and even death. This mer-
cury poisoning was the first major human disaster resulting
from ocean pollution. However, the Japanese government
did  not declare mercury  as  the  cause of the  disease until
1968. The plant was immediately shut down, but more than
100 people were known to suffer from the disease by 1969
(Figure  11.25), almost  half  of  whom  died. A  second
acetaldehyde  plant  was  closed  in  1965  in  Niigata, Japan,
because  it, too, was  discharging  mercury  that  poisoned
people. Between  1965  and  1970, 47  fishing  families  con-
tracted  Minamata  disease. Today  the  concentration  of
mercury  in  Minamata  Bay  is  no  longer  unusually  high,
indicating that there has been enough time for the mercury
to be widely dispersed within the marine environment.

FIGURE 11.26 Mercury concentrations in fish versus
consumption rates for various populations. Graph
showing the relative risk of contracting Minamata disease
based on the amount of fish consumed and the concentration
of mercury in fish for people in the United States, Sweden,
and Japan including Minamata. It shows that the safe inges-
tion level of 0.03 milligrams of mercury per day is within the
Food and Drug Administration s standard safety level of 
1.0 ppm for fish and that tuna and most swordfish are safe 
to consume.

BIOACCUMULATION  AND  BIOMAGNIFICATION
During  the  1960s  and  1970s  methyl  mercury
contamination  in  seafood  received  considerable
attention. Certain marine organisms concentrate
within  their  tissues  many  substances  found  in
minute  concentrations  in  seawater  in  a  process
called bioaccumulation. When animals eat other
animals, some  of  these  substances  (including
toxic  chemicals)  move  up  food  chains  and
become  concentrated  in  the  tissues  of  larger
animals  in  a  process  called  biomagnification.
Because the amount of mercury in the ocean has
been  increasing  (mostly  from  the  mercury  in
disposable batteries), some seafood such as tuna
and swordfish were thought to contain unusually
high amounts of mercury.

Studies done on the amount of seafood con-
sumed  by  various  human  populations  helped
establish safe levels of mercury in marketed fish.
To  establish  these  levels, three  variables  were
considered:

1. The rate at which each group of people con-

sumed fish

2. The  mercury  concentration  in  the  fish  con-

sumed by that population

3. The minimum ingestion rate of mercury that

induces disease symptoms

These three variables help establish a maximum allowable mercury concen-
tration that will safeguard people from mercury poisoning, as long as they don t
exceed the recommended intake of fish.

Figure 11.26 shows the relative risk of contracting Minamata disease for people
in the United States, Sweden, and Japan, including those from the Minamata fishing
community. The graph shows that the risk increases with increased consumption of
fish and that the higher the mercury concentration of the fish, the greater the risk.

Scientists have determined that the minimum level of mercury consumption
that causes poisoning symptoms is 0.3 milligrams per day over a 200-day period.
Figure 11.26 shows that for people in the United States who have an average daily
consumption  of  17  grams  of  fish  per  day, mercury  poisoning  symptoms  occur
when mercury concentrations in fish exceed 20 parts per million (ppm). Using a
safety factor of 10 times, the maximum concentration of mercury in fish that can
safely be consumed by people in the United States is 2.0 ppm.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doubled the safety factor and
established a limit of mercury concentration for fish at 1 ppm. Based on consumption
rates, this limit has adequately protected the health of U.S. citizens because essentially
all  tuna  and  most  swordfish  fall below  this  concentration. Still, the  FDA  issued  an
advisory in 2001 stating that pregnant women, women of childbearing age, nursing
mothers, and young children should avoid eating certain kinds of fish that may con-
tain high levels of methyl mercury, such as swordfish, sharks, king mackerel, and tile-
fish. A recent study, however, found that mercury in fish might not be as harmful as
thought because the form of the metal in seafood (methyl mercury cysteine) differs
from that used in toxicology models (aqueous methyl mercury chloride).

Figure 11.26 shows that for people in Sweden and Japan, the mercury concen-
tration of fish deemed to be at a safe level is lower because these populations eat
more fish.The graph also shows the extreme danger to which residents of Minamata
were inadvertently subjected when they ate so much of the highly contaminated
fish from Minamata Bay.

11.6 What Are the Main Types of Marine Pollution?

Non-Point-Source Pollution and Trash
Non-point-source  pollution also  called  poison  runoff
is  any  type  of  pollution
entering the ocean from multiple sources rather than from a single discrete source,
point, or  location. In  most  urban  areas, non-point-source  pollution  arrives  at  the
ocean via runoff from storm drains, many of which now have labels indicating that
they lead to the ocean (Figure 11.27). The U.S. National Academy of Sciences esti-
mates that 5.8 million metric tons (6.4 million short tons) of litter enters the world s
oceans each year.

Because non-point-source pollution comes from many different locations, it
is difficult to pinpoint where it originates, although the cause of the pollution may
readily be apparent. Trash that is washed down a storm drain to the ocean is one
such  example. Others  include  pesticides  and  fertilizers  from  agriculture  and  oil
from  automobiles  that  are  washed  to  the  ocean  whenever  it  rains. In  fact, the
amount  of  road  oil  and  improperly  disposed  oil  regularly  discharged  each  year
into U.S. waters as non-point-source pollution is as much as 26 times the amount
of the Exxon Valdez oil spill!

Trash enters the ocean as a result of ocean dumping, too. According to exist-
ing laws (Figure 11.28), certain types of trash such as glass, metal, rags, and food
can legally be dumped in the ocean as long as they are dumped far enough away
from shore or ground up small enough. Mostly, this material sinks or biodegrades
and does not accumulate at the surface. The exception is plastic material.

PLASTICS Globally, plastic constitutes  the  vast  majority  of  marine  debris. About
80%  of  marine  debris  comes  from  land-based  sources, and  the  majority  of  that  is
plastic. When plastic enters the ocean, it floats and is not readily biodegradable. As
such, plastic  can  remain  in  the  marine  environment  almost  indefinitely, affecting
marine  organisms  through  entanglement  and  ingestion. In  fact, there  are  many
documented cases of plastic waste such as six-pack rings or packing straps strangling
fish, marine mammals, and birds that have been entangled in plastic trash (Figures
11.29a and Figure 11.29b). Marine birds have also ingested so much floating plastic
trash  that  it  fills  their  stomach  and  they  die  from  starvation  (Figure  11.29c). In
probably the most well-known case of lethal ingestion of plastic trash, marine turtles
have been killed when they eat floating plastic bags, evidently mistaking them for

FIGURE 11.27 A labeled storm drain that leads to 
the ocean. Although many people believe that storm 
drain runoff is processed by sewage treatment plants, any 
material that enters storm drains goes directly into streams 
or the ocean.

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

Dont storm drains receive treatment before empty-
ing into the ocean?

Contrary  to  popular  belief,  water  (and  any  other
material)  that  goes  down  a  storm  drain  does  not
receive  any  treatment  before  being  emptied  into  a
river  or  directly  into  the  ocean.  Sewage  treatment
plants  receive  enough  waste  to  process  without  the
additional  runoff  from  storms,  so  it  is  important  to
monitor carefully what is disposed into storm drains.
For instance, some people discharge used motor oil
into storm drains, thinking that it will be processed by
a  sewage  plant.  A  good  rule  of  thumb  is  this: Dont
put anything down a storm drain that you wouldnt
put directly into the ocean itself.

FIGURE 11.28 Current law regulating ocean dumping. Many types of trash can
legally be dumped in the ocean, as long as it is ground fine enough and not composed of
plastic. In fact, plastic is the only substance that cannot be dumped anywhere in the ocean.

All this pollution is distressing. Is there anything I can
do about it?

Yes, there are many things you can do to help protect
the  ocean,  some  of  which  are  listed  in  this  book s
Afterword. They all involve making intelligent  choices
and minimizing your impact on the environment. Non-
point-source pollution, for example, is something that
the general public is directly responsible for, so one of
the  best  methods  of  prevention  may  be  educating
people.  Once  people  understand  the  impact  our
choices have on the environment, then the solution is
up to all of us.

jellyfish or other transparent plankton on which they typically feed. Despite the fact
that plastics are one of the few substances that are illegal to dump anywhere in the
ocean (see Figure 11.28), their properties and abundant usage in society contribute to
their increasing profusion in the marine environment (Box 11.2).

Entanglement and ingestion, however, are not the worst problems caused by
the ubiquitous plastic pollution in the ocean. Researchers have recently discovered
that  floating  plastic  pieces  have  a  high  affinity  for  non-water-soluble  toxic  com-
pounds, most notably DDT, PCBs, and other oily pollutants. As a result, some plastic

see, with the sight of plastic.

Capt. Charles Moore (2003)

Even  though  plastic  products  have  been
used  for  over  a  century, their  commercial
development  occurred  during  World  War
II, when  shortages  of  rubber  and  other

materials  created  great  de-
mand for alternative products.
Plastic products are lightweight,
strong, durable, and inexpensive,
so they have many advantages
over  other  materials. Today,
everything from airplane parts
to  zippers  is  made  of  plastic
(Figure 11C). Humans  wear
plastics, cook  in  plastics, drive
in plastics, and even have inter-
nal  artificial  parts  made  of
plastics. The  convenience  of
plastic items intended for one-
time  use  has  also  contributed
to their popularity.

What was once thought of as a mira-
cle substance, however, has been found to
have  several  disadvantages. Disposing  of
plastics  has  already  strained  the  capacity
of  land-based  solid-waste  disposal  sys-
tems. Plastic waste is now an
increasingly  abundant  com-
ponent  of  oceanic  flotsam
(floating refuse). In fact, plas-
tics constitute the vast major-
ity  of  floating  trash  in  all
oceans  worldwide. Unfortu-
nately, the very same proper-
ties  that  make  plastics  so
advantageous make them un-
usually  persistent  and  dam-
aging when released into the
marine environment:

They  are  lightweight, so
they float and concentrate
at the surface.
They  are  strong, so  they
entangle marine organisms.
They  are  durable, so  they
don t  biodegrade  easily,
causing them to last almost
indefinitely.
They  are  inexpensive, so
they are mass-produced and
used in almost everything.

products  (Figure  11D). They  are  trans-
ported in bulk aboard commercial vessels
and  are  found  throughout  the  oceans,
probably due to spillage at loading termi-
nals. In  coastal  waters, plastic  products
used in fishing are commonly thrown over-
board by recreational and commercial ves-
sels. Plastic trash also finds its way into the
open-ocean waters from non-point-source
pollution by careless people on land.
Because of ocean currents that wash plas-
tics ashore, plastic pellets and trash can be
found  on  all  beaches even  in  remote
areas. In one of the best-documented stud-
ies  of  trash  on  beaches,
for  example,
researchers  painstakingly  counted  all  de-
bris  larger  than  a  pinhead  along  selected
transits 
in  Orange  County, California.
Based on what was collected during the six-
week  sampling  period, researchers  project
that  each  year  Orange  County  beaches
receive  106.9  million  pieces  of  debris, an
astonishing  98%  (105.2  million)  of  which
are  nurdles. Other  studies  have  shown
that some Bermuda beaches contain up to
10,000  nurdles  per  square  meter  (10.7
square feet) and some beaches on Martha s
Vineyard  in  Massachusetts  contain  16,000
nurdles per square meter (10.7 square feet).
Plastic  trash  is  not  limited  to  beaches. In
fact, floating  plastic  trash  is  beginning  to
accumulate  in  unprecedented  amounts  in
the open ocean. For example, in the centers

of the major subtropical gyres, which have a
sluggish  circular  motion  and  tend  to  accu-
mulate  floating  debris, recent  surveys  indi-
cate  that  the  mass  of  floating  plastic  trash
now outnumbers the mass of marine organ-
isms six to one. Indeed, equipment deployed
from  research  vessels  often  returns  entan-
gled  in  plastic  trash  such  as  six-pack  rings,
Styrofoam, and fishing lines, nets, and floats.

What can be done to limit the amount
of plastic in the marine environment? For
starters, people  can  limit  their  use  of  sin-
gle-use  plastic, recycle  plastic  material,
and dispose of their plastic trash properly,
including  not  dumping  any  plastic  at  sea.
Recently, some  California  municipalities
have  banned  single-use  plastic  bags  and
polystyrene 
takeout  containers, with
mounting  pressure  to  enforce  statewide

Tanzania, and several other countries have
already banned plastic grocery bags.) And,
beach cleanups are responsible for remov-
ing  an  amazing  amount  of  trash  from
beaches. By  taking  these  simple  actions,
the  amount  of  plastics  in  the  world s
oceans would be greatly reduced.

pieces accumulate poisons to levels as high as a million times their concentrations
in seawater. When marine organisms ingest the toxic plastic pieces, they accumu-
late vast quantities of the toxic materials.

What makes matters worse is that over time, floating plastics photodegrade, a
process  in  which  sunlight  breaks  them  into  progressively  smaller  pieces, which
only serves to facilitate the ingestion of plastics by all types of marine organisms,
particularly  microscopic  organisms  that  constitute  lower  levels  of  marine  food
webs. So, plastics  rarely  if  ever  leave  the  ocean they  just  break  down  into
smaller pieces and enter marine food webs at progressively lower levels.

Studies  have  revealed  that  marine  plastic  particles  increased  tenfold  every
10 years in the 1970s and 1980s and then tenfold again in just 3 years in the 1990s.
Where  does  all  this  floating  plastic  trash  go?  Some  of  it  washes  up  on  various
beaches, and  some  is  eaten  by  marine  animals, but  most  of  it  remains  at  sea,
constantly  breaking  down  into  smaller  pieces. Oceanographers  have  recently  dis-
covered large floating regions of trash in all oceans of the world where plastics out-
number marine organisms several times over. These regions are located where
major current systems converge within the world s subtropical gyres (see
Chapter  7). One  of  the  best  studied  of  these  regions  is  the  Eastern
Pacific Garbage Patch (Figure 11.30), which is about twice the size
of Texas and is estimated to contain a staggering 91 million met-

What  are  the  laws  regulating  ocean  dumping?  In  the
1980s, increasing concern about floating trash in particular
syringes and other medical waste that closed long stretches
of  beaches  in  the  New York  area prompted  nations  of
the world to come together to try to correct the problem.
In 1988, the International Convention for the Prevention
of  Pollution  from  Ships, which  is  commonly  known  as
MARPOL (short  for  Marine  Pollution ), proposed  a
treaty banning the disposal of all plastics and regulating
the  dumping  of  most  other  garbage  at  sea  (see  Fig-
ure 11.28). By 2005, 122 nations had ratified MARPOL.
Some studies suggest that MARPOL has reduced both
marine  debris  and  entanglements  by  discarded  fishing
nets in some places, most notably in waters off Alaska
and  California. Other  studies, however, show  no
improvement  in  areas  such  as  the  Southern  Ocean,
South Atlantic, and Hawaiian Islands. As with many en-
vironmental protections and international treaties, enforcement lags far behind stated
intentions. And  although  an  annex  to  MARPOL  requires  that  nations  that  have
signed the treaty provide shore-based facilities where ships can easily dispose of their
garbage, many developing countries have not been able to provide these facilities. As

a result, even well-meaning captains and ship-
pers who want to comply with existing interna-
tional  marine  pollution  laws  may  not  be  able
to do so.

Biological Pollution: 
Non-Native Species
Non-native  species (also  called  exotic, alien,
or invasive species) are species that originate
in  a  particular  area  but  are  introduced  into
new environments either by the deliberate or
accidental actions of humans and so are clas-
sified  as  biological  pollutants. Because  non-
native species  inhabit new areas where  they
lack predators or other natural controls, they
can wreak ecological havoc by outcompeting
and  dominating  native  populations. Non-
native  species  can  also  introduce  new  para-
sites and/or diseases. In some cases, non-native
species  completely  transform  ecosystems.
In the  United  States  alone, more  than  7000
introduced  species  (not  counting  microor-
ganisms)  have  been  documented, of  which
about  15%  cause  ecological  and  economic
damage. In  fact, invasive  species  cause  an
estimated $137 billion in loss and damages in
the United States each year.

The seaweed Caulerpa taxifolia, which is
native in tropical waters, is one example of an
invasive, non-native  marine  species. It  is  ideal  as  a  decorative  alga  in  saltwater
aquariums because it is hardy, fast growing, and not edible by most fish. However,
when it is introduced into suitable new habitats (probably as a result of the dump-
ing  of  household  saltwater  aquariums), it  becomes  a  dominant  and  persistent
species that displaces native seaweeds and other marine life. In 1984, a cold-toler-
ant clone of Caulerpa taxifolia produced for the aquarium industry was first intro-
duced into the Mediterranean Sea, where it has overwhelmed aquatic ecosystems
and continues to spread. This clone has also been found in the lagoons of Southern
California  (Figure  11.31), where  it  was  first  reported  in  2000, but  eradication
efforts appear to have been successful. Because Caulerpa taxifolia can regenerate
from  very  small  fragments, however, repeated  surveys  are  being  conducted  in
these lagoons to eliminate all remaining occurrences of the seaweed. Recently, a
new infestation of Caulerpa taxifolia has been reported near Sydney, Australia.

Another example of a non-native aquatic species is the zebra mussel (Dreissena
polymorpha), which  has  invaded  the  Great  Lakes  region. After  entering  North
America more than a decade ago (probably in the ballast water10 of a freighter from
Europe), these mussels have proliferated rapidly in waters of eastern Canada and
the United States. In doing so, they ve driven out native mussels, altered the ecology
of  freshwater  lakes  and  streams, and  blocked  the  water-carrying  pipes  of  power
plants and many other industrial facilities. Although zebra mussels are exceedingly
hardy organisms, researchers are working to identify predators, parasites, and infec-
tious microbes that can kill zebra mussels but leave native populations unharmed.

10Ballast water is taken into the hold of a ship to enhance stability and then released in a port when it
is no longer needed.

FIGURE 11.31 Invasion of Caulerpa taxifolia. The sea-
weed Caulerpa taxifolia is thought to have been illegally
dumped from an aquarium into Southern California coastal
lagoons. The alga was eradiated largely because of good pub-
lic awareness and quick action by local authorities.

Examples of marine pollution include petroleum from
oil spills; sewage sludge; chemicals such as 
DDT, PCBs, and mercury; non-point-source pollution
such as road oil and trash (including plastics); and
biological pollution such as non-native species.

Other  notable  examples  of  harmful  non-native  aquatic  species  include  the
Atlantic comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi, which was transported in ballast water to
the  Black  Sea  and  has  done  extensive  damage; the Atlantic  cordgrass  Spartina
alterniflora, which has invaded soft-bottom coasts of California and Washington;
the water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes, which infests tropical estuaries and other
water bodies; and the European green crab Carcinus maenas, which has invaded
the Pacific Coast and is altering coastal food webs.

Chapter in Review

Coastal waters support about 95% of the total mass of life in the oceans,
and they are important areas for commerce, recreation, fisheries, and the
disposal of waste. Coastal law is specified in the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea, which has been ratified by 153 coastal nations and
in  force  since  1994. The  treaty  delineates  national  obligations, rights, and
jurisdiction in coastal waters. In spite of its near-universal acceptance, the
United States has still not ratified the treaty.

The temperature and salinity of the coastal ocean vary over a greater range
than the open ocean because the coastal ocean is shallow and experiences
river runoff, tidal currents, and seasonal changes in solar radiation. Coastal
geostrophic currents are produced from freshwater runoff and coastal winds.

Estuaries are semienclosed bodies of water where freshwater runoff from
the land mixes with ocean water. Estuaries are classified by their origin as
coastal  plain, fjord, bar  built, or  tectonic. Estuaries  are  also  classified  by
their  mixing  patterns of  fresh  and  salt  water  as  vertically  mixed, slightly
stratified, highly stratified, and salt wedge. Typical circulation in an estuary
consists of a surface flow of low-salinity water toward its mouth and a sub-
surface flow of marine water toward its head.

Estuaries provide important breeding and nursery areas for many marine
organisms but often suffer from human population pressures. The Columbia
River Estuary, for example, has degraded from agriculture, logging, and the
construction  of  dams  upstream. In  the  Chesapeake  Bay, an  anoxic  zone
occurs during the summer that kills many commercially important species.

Long  offshore  deposits  called  barrier  islands  protect  marshes  and
lagoons. Some lagoons have restricted circulation with the ocean, so water
temperatures and salinity may vary widely with the seasons.

Circulation in the Mediterranean Sea is characteristic of restricted bodies
of  water  in  areas  where  evaporation  greatly  exceeds  precipitation. Called
Mediterranean circulation, it is the reverse of estuarine circulation.

Wetlands are some of the most biologically productive regions on Earth.
Salt marshes and mangrove swamps are important examples of coastal wet-
lands. Wetlands  are  ecologically  important because  they  remove  land-
derived  pollutants from  water  before  it  reaches  the  ocean. Nevertheless,
human activities continue to destroy wetlands.

Although  marine  pollution  seems  easily  defined, an  all-encompassing
definition  is  quite  detailed. It  is  often  difficult  to  establish  the  degree  to
which  pollution  affects  ocean  areas. The  most  widely  used  technique  for
determining the effects of pollution is the environmental bioassay, which
determines  the  concentration  of  a  pollutant  that  causes  a  50%  mortality

rate among test organisms. The debate continues about whether society s
wastes should be dumped in the ocean.

Oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and other substances, most of
which  are  naturally  biodegradable. Thus, many  marine  pollution  experts
consider  oil  to  be  among  the  least  damaging  of  all  substances introduced
into  the  marine  environment. In  areas  that  have  experienced  oil  spills,
recovery can be as rapid as a few years. Still, oil spills can cover large areas
and kill many animals. After the much publicized Exxon Valdez oil spill in
Alaska, many novel approaches were used to clean the spilled oil, including
oil-eating bacteria (bioremediation).

Millions  of  tons  of  sewage  sludge  have  been  dumped  offshore  in  coastal
waters. Although 1972 legislation required an end to dumping of sewage in
the coastal ocean by 1981, exceptions continue to be made. Increased public
concern resulted in new legislation to prohibit sewage dumping in the ocean.

DDT  and  PCBs  are  persistent, biologically  hazardous  chemicals  that
have  been  introduced  into  the  ocean  by  human  activities. DDT  pollution
produced a decline in the Long Island osprey population in the 1950s and
the brown pelican population of the California coast in the 1960s. Virtual
cessation  of  DDT  use in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  in  1972  allowed  the
recovery of both populations. The DDT thinned the eggshells and reduced
the number of successful hatchings. PCBs have been implicated in causing
health problems in sea lions and shrimp.

Mercury  poisoning  was  the  first  major  human  disaster  resulting  from
ocean pollution. It is now called Minamata disease after the bay in Japan
where  it  first  occurred  in  1953. Mercury  bioaccumulates  in  the  tissues  of
many large fish, most notably tuna and swordfish, and works its way up the
food web in a process called biomagnification. To prevent mercury poison-
ings  in  the  United  States, stringent  mercury  contamination  levels  in  fish
have been established by the FDA.

Non-point-source pollution includes road oil and trash. Plastics are light-
weight, strong, durable, and inexpensive. Unfortunately, these same proper-
ties make them a relentless source of floating trash in the ocean, especially
because they break down into progressively smaller pieces over time. The
amount  of  plastic  accumulating  in  the  oceans  has  increased  dramatically.
Certain forms of plastic are known to be lethal to marine mammals, birds,
and  turtles. International  legislation  such  as  MARPOL  regulates  the  dis-
posal of trash in the ocean but lacks enforcement.

The  introduction  of  biological  pollution such  as  non-native  species
(including  Caulerpa  taxifolia and  zebra  mussels)  into  new  environments
can cause severe ecological and economic damage.

Unique adaptations of marine life.
The goosefish (Lophius americanus; also called monkfish, 
or angler) has unique adaptations, including feathery 
appendages as camouflage and a modified dorsal fin that
serves as a lure to attract prey. It has been described as
mostly mouth with a tail attached and it can eat prey almost
as big as itself. The bottom-dwelling goosefish lives in water
as deep as 800 meters (2600 feet) and ranges from the
Grand Banks and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence south to
Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

a Taxonomic classification of
living things includes three
domains and five kingdoms,
each of which is split into 
increasingly specific group-
ings of phylum, class, order,
family, genus, and species.

a Marine organisms can 
be classified as plankton
(drifters), nekton (swim-
mers), or benthos (bottom
dwellers); more than
250,000 marine species
exist, which represent 
14% of the identified
species on Earth.

a The ocean s physical proper-
ties (such as viscosity, tem-
perature, salinity, sunlit 
surface waters, and pres-
sure) create conditions to
which marine organisms
are superbly adapted.

MARINE LIFE AND THE
MARINE ENVIRONMENT

A wide variety of organisms inhabits the marine environment. These organisms range in size from
microscopic bacteria and algae to the blue whale, which is as long as three buses lined up end to end.
Marine biologists have identified over 250,000 marine species; this number is constantly increasing
as new organisms are discovered.

Most marine organisms live within the sunlit surface waters of the ocean. Strong sunlight sup-
ports photosynthesis by marine algae, which either directly or indirectly provides food for the vast
majority of marine organisms. All marine algae live near the surface because they need the sunlight;
most marine animals live near the surface because this is where food can be obtained. In shallow-
water areas close to land, sunlight reaches all the way to the ocean floor, resulting in an abundance
of marine life.

There are advantages and disadvantages to living in the marine environment. One advantage is
that there is an abundance of water available, which is necessary for supporting all types of life. One
disadvantage is that maneuvering in water can be difficult because the high density of water impedes
movement. The individual success of species depends on their ability to find food, avoid predators,
and cope with the many physical barriers to their movement.

12.1 What Are Living Things, and How Are 

They Classified?

Living  things  are  classified  based  on  their  physical  characteristics, with  organisms  that  are  closely
related to one another sharing a host of common traits. Recently, genome sequencing of the DNA of
many organisms (including human, mouse, dog, cat, cow, elephant, honeybee, platypus, diatom, red
algae, sea urchin, dolphin, and hundreds of bacteria and viruses, amongst others) has allowed genetic
comparison, sometimes confirming many of the classification groupings based on structure and other
times  indicating  some  unexpected  relationships. First, however, let s  examine  what  characteristics
qualify an entity as being alive.

A Working Definition of Life
It might seem easy to differentiate those that are living from the nonliving, but the unusual nature of
some  life  forms  makes  defining  life  a  challenging  task. Also, both  living  and  nonliving  things  are
composed  of  the  same basic building blocks: atoms, which move continuously in and out  of  living
and nonliving systems. This free exchange of identical components between life and nonlife is one of
the factors that complicates attempts at formally defining life.

345

346

Chapter 12 Marine Life and the Marine Environment

A simple definition of life is that it consumes energy from its environment.
Using this definition, a car engine could probably be classified as alive. An engine,
however, cannot self-replicate or otherwise reproduce itself, which is another key
component of life.

Several other qualities are crucial in defining life. Water probably needs to be
a part of a living organism because living things need a solvent for biochemical
reactions
though ammonia or sulfuric acid might also work. A living thing prob-
ably has to have some sort of a membrane to distinguish itself from its environ-
ment. In addition, most living things tend to respond to stimuli or adapt to their
environment. Lastly, life as we know it is carbon-based, since carbon is so useful in
making chemical compounds. Because NASA s definition of life must encompass
the potential of extraterrestrial life, they have been using a fairly simple working
definition of life: Life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing
Darwinian evolution. 1 Even this definition is problematic in that it would likely
require observation of several successive generations over a considerable length
of time to verify evolution in a life form.

A  good  working  definition  of  life, then, should  incorporate  most  of  these
ideas: that living things can capture, store, and transmit energy; they are capable of
reproduction; they can adapt to their environment; and they change through time.

The Three Domains of Life
All  living  things  belong  to  one  of  three  domains  or  superkingdoms of  life:
Bacteria (or Eubacteria), Archaea, and Eukarya (Figure 12.1a). Domain Bacteria
(bakterion * rod) includes simple life forms with cells that usually lack a nucleus,
including purple bacteria, green nonsulfur bacteria, and cyanobacteria (blue-green
algae). Domain  Archaea (achaeo * ancient)  is  a  group  of  simple, microscopic,

bacteria-like creatures that includes methane producers and sulfur oxidizers that
inhabit deep-sea vents and seeps,2 as well as other forms many of which prefer
environments  with  extreme  temperatures  and/or  pressures. Domain  Eukarya
(eu * good, karuon * nut) includes complex organisms: multicellular plants; mul-
ticellular  animals; fungi; and  protoctists, which  are  a  diverse  array  of  mostly
microscopic organisms that don t fit into any other group. The main component of
eukaryotes, DNA, is  housed  in  a  discrete  nucleus, and  their  cells  contain  struc-
tures that supply energy to build the cell and maintain its functions.

What were the ancestors of these three domains of life? The ancestors of the
three domains are thought to have consisted  of a community of early primitive
cells, some  of  which  apparently  acquired  new  genetic  material  by  engulfing
microbial  neighbors  including  their  genetic  codes. These  groups  of  organisms
helped  each  other  coexist  for  their  mutual  benefit, and  as  a  result  evolved  into
new organisms that contained merged genes. Today, in fact, it is well established
that  such  adoption  of  foreign  genetic  material  is  common  among  single-celled
bacteria and other microbes but also occurs in some fungi, plants, insects, worms,
and other animals. For example, a recent study of venomous jellyfish has revealed
that one of the genes necessary for jellyfish to sting is identical to a gene in bacte-
ria, suggesting that the ancestors of jellyfish picked up the gene from microbes.
This process, called lateral gene transfer, was likely quite important in the evolu-
tion of some of the first complex cells.

The Five Kingdoms of Organisms
Within the three domains of life, a system of five kingdoms was first proposed by
ecologist and biologist Robert H. Whittaker in 1969. Although the five kingdoms
have been modified somewhat since they were first proposed, the five kingdoms
are Monera, Plantae, Animalia, Fungi, and Protoctista (or Protista) (Figure 12.1b).
More  recently, some  biologists  now  recognize  additional  kingdoms  within  the
Archaea domain.

Kingdom Monera (monos * single) includes some of the simplest organisms.
These  organisms  are  single  celled  but  lack  discrete  nuclei  and  the  internal
organelles present in all other organisms. Included in this kingdom are cyanobac-
teria (blue-green algae), heterotrophic bacteria, and archaea. Recent discoveries
have shown bacteria to be a much more important part of marine ecology than
previously  believed. These  organisms  are  found  throughout  the  breadth  and
depth of the oceans.

Kingdom  Plantae (planta * plant)  comprises  the  multicelled  plants, all  of
such  as  surf  grass
which  photosynthesize. Only  a  few  species  of  true  plants
inhabit shallow coastal environments. In
(Phyllospadix) and eelgrass (Zostera)
the ocean, photosynthetic marine algae occupy the ecological niche of land plants.
However, certain plants are vital parts of coastal ecosystems, including mangrove
swamps and salt marshes.

Kingdom  Animalia (anima * breath)  comprises  the  multicelled  animals.
Organisms from kingdom Animalia range in complexity from the simple sponges
to complex vertebrates (animals with backbones), which also includes humans.

Kingdom  Fungi ( fungus * [probably  from  Greek  sp(h)ongos * sponge])
includes 100,000 species of mold and lichen, though less than one-half of 1% of
them are sea dwellers. Fungi exist throughout the marine environment, but they
are much more common in the intertidal zone, where they live with cyanobacteria
or green algae to form lichen. Other fungi remineralize organic matter and func-
tion primarily as decomposers in the marine ecosystem.

Kingdom Protoctista ( proto * first, ktistos * to establish) includes a diverse
collection of single- and multicelled organisms that have a nucleus. Examples of

2A seep is an area where various fluids trickle out of the sea floor.

348

Chapter 12 Marine Life and the Marine Environment

organisms  in  kingdom  Protoctista  include  various
types  of  marine  algae (aquatic  photosynthetic
organisms  that  can  be  either  single-celled  and
microscopic  or  multicelled  and  macroscopic)  and
single-celled animals called protozoa ( proto * first,
zoa * animal).

Linnaeus and Taxonomic
Classification
In an effort to determine the relationships of all liv-
ing  things  on  Earth, Swedish  botanist  Carl  von
Linné who  Latinized  his  name 
to  Carolus
Linnaeus (1707 1778)
created  a  system  in  1758
that  is  the  basis  of  the  modern  scientific  system  of
classification  used  today. Linnaeus  developed  his
system similar to the social hierarchy of his day, with
its  kingdoms, countries, provinces, parishes, and  vil-
lages. Linnaeus  was  a  gifted  observationist  and  tireless
collector  who  spent  much  of  his  time  naming  species  and
organizing  them  into  groups. In  fact, Linnaeus s  original
names  for  the  roughly  12,000  organisms  he  examined  over  the
course of his life became the starting point for all biological classifi-
cation. Linnaeus s organizational scheme can be visualized as a series

of nested boxes (Figure 12.2).

Today, the  systematic  classification  of  organisms

called  taxonomy
involves using physical characteris-
tics  as  well  as  genetic  information  to  recognize  organism  similarities  and  then
grouping them into the following increasingly specific categories:

(Less specific grouping)

(More specific grouping)

All organisms that share a common category (for instance, a family such as
the cat or dolphin family) have certain characteristics and evolutionary similari-
ties. In some cases, subdivisions of these categories are also used, such as subphy-
lum (Table 12.1). The categories assigned to an individual species must be agreed
upon by an international panel of experts.

The fundamental unit of taxonomic classification is the species (species * a
kind). Species consist of populations of genetically similar, interbreeding (or poten-
tially interbreeding) individuals that share a collection of inherited characteristics
whose combination is unique.

As an offshoot of his classification scheme, Linnaeus also invented binomial
nomenclature, where every living thing is known by just two Latin names (previ-
ously, organisms  were  known  by  a  combination  of  as  many  as  a  dozen  Latin
names). In this way, every type of organism has a unique two-word scientific name

3Note that for plants, the term division is used instead of phylum; the current International Code of
Botanical Nomenclature, however, allows the use of either term.

Living organisms use energy, reproduce, adapt, and
change through time. Living things can be classified
into one of three domains and five kingdoms, each
of which is split into increasingly specific groupings
of phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.

Why are there scientific names for all organisms?
Wouldnt it be easier just to know the common name
of an organism?

Each individual species has a unique two-word scien-
tific name, which identifies a particular species more
clearly than the common name. Common names are
often used for more than one species of organisms,
which  can  be  confusing.  Dolphin,   for  example,  is
used to describe dolphins, porpoises, and even a type
of  fish!  Most  people  would  strongly  object  to  being
served dolphin in a restaurant, but dolphin fish (also
called mahi-mahi) is often a featured menu item.

Common  names  can  also  be  confusing  because
there can be more than one for the same species, and
because  they  vary  from  language  to  language.
Scientific names, on the other hand, are Latin based,
so  they  are  the  same  in  all  languages.  This  allows  a
Chinese scientist, for example, to communicate effec-
tively  with  a  Greek  scientist  about  a  particular  organ-
ism.  Thus,  scientific  names  are  useful,  descriptive  (if
you know a bit about Latin terms and word roots), and
unambiguous.

using  its  genus  and  species, which  is  italicized  with  the  first  letter  of  the  generic
(genus)  name  capitalized for  example, Delphinus  delphis. Most  organisms  also
have one or more common names. Delphinus delphis, for instance, is the common
dolphin, and  Orcinus  orca is  the  killer  whale  or  orca. If  the  scientific  name  is
referred to repeatedly within a document, it is often shortened by abbreviating the
genus name to its first letter. Thus, Delphinus delphis becomes D. delphis.

The Linnaean system, even in its modern form, is far from perfect. New evi-
dence routinely requires taxonomists to move species from one genus to another,
or even to an entirely different order. Linnaeus, however, is credited with forging
a single, flexible, universally applicable scientific language that is still in use over
250 years after he invented it.

12.2 How Are Marine Organisms

Classified?

Marine  organisms  can  be  classified  according  to  where  they  live  (their  habitat)
and how they move (their mobility). Organisms that inhabit the water column can
be classified as either plankton (drifters) or nekton (swimmers). All other organ-
isms are benthos (bottom dwellers).

Plankton (Drifters)
algae, animals, and
Plankton (planktos * wandering)  include  all  organisms
bacteria that drift with ocean currents. An individual organism is called a plankter.
Just because plankters drift does not mean they are unable to swim. In fact, many
plankters can swim but either move only weakly or move only vertically. As such,
they cannot determine their horizontal position within the ocean.

Plankton are unbelievably abundant and important within the marine envi-
ronment. In fact, most of Earth s biomass
consists
of plankton adrift in the oceans. Even though 98% of marine species are bottom
dwelling, the vast majority of the ocean s biomass is planktonic.

the mass of living organisms

TYPES OF PLANKTON Plankton can be classified based on their feeding styles.
If  an  organism  can  photosynthesize  and  therefore  produce  its  own  food, it  is
termed  autotrophic (auto * self, tropho * nourishment). Autotrophic  plankton
are called phytoplankton (phyto * plant, planktos * wandering) and can range in

350

size  from  microscopic  algae  to  larger  species  of  drifting  kelp. If  an  organism
cannot  produce  its  own  food  and  relies  instead  on  food  produced  by  other
organisms, it is termed heterotrophic (hetero * different, tropho * nourishment).
Heterotrophic  plankton  are  called  zooplankton (zoo * animal, planktos *
wandering), which includes drifting marine animals. Representative members of

Plankton also include bacteria. It has recently been
discovered  that  free-living  bacterioplankton are  much
more  abundant  and  far  more  widely  distributed  than
previously thought. Having an average diameter of only
one-half  of  a  micrometer4 (0.00002  inch), they  were
missed in earlier studies because they are so incredibly
small. Recently, microbiologists  have  begun  to  study
oceanic bacterioplankton  and have even discovered an
extremely  small  yet  abundant  bacterium  that  has  been
estimated to constitute at least half of the ocean s total
photosynthetic biomass and is likely the most abundant
photosynthetic organism on Earth.

Plankton  also  include  viruses, which  are  called
virioplankton. Virioplankton are an order of magnitude
smaller  than  bacterioplankton  and  are  similarly  little
known. The role of viruses in planktonic communities is
not well understood, but they may limit the abundance
of other types of plankton through infection.

Although plankton can be classified as either phyto-
plankton, zooplankton, bacterioplankton, or virioplank-
ton, they can also be classified according to the portion
of  their  life  cycle  spent  as  plankton. Organisms  that
spend  their  entire  lives  as  plankton  are  holoplankton
(holo * whole, planktos * wandering). Many organisms
that  spend  their  adult  lives  as  nekton  or  benthos
spend their  juvenile  and/or  larval  stages  as  plankton

How Are Marine Organisms Classified?

351

(Figure 12.4). These organisms are called meroplankton (mero * a part, planktos *
wandering).

Lastly, plankton can also be classified based on size. For example, large float-
ing animals and algae, such as jellyfish and Sargassum,5 are called macroplankton
(macro * large, planktos * wandering) and measure 2 to 20 centimeters (0.8 to
8 inches). Plankton  also  include  bacterioplankton, which  are  so  small  that  they
can  be  removed  from  the  water  only  with  special  microfilters. These  very  tiny
drifters are called picoplankton (pico * small, planktos * wandering) and meas-
ure 0.2 to 2 microns (0.000008 to 0.00008 inch).

Nekton (Swimmers)
Nekton (nektos * swimming)  include  all  animals  capable  of  moving  independ-
ently of the ocean currents by swimming or other means of propulsion. They are
capable not only of determining their own positions within the ocean but also, in
many cases, of long migrations. Nekton include most adult fish and squid, marine
mammals, and marine reptiles (Figure 12.5). When you go ocean swimming, you
become nekton, too.

Although  nekton  move  freely, they  are  unable  to  move  throughout  the
breadth  of  the  ocean. Gradual  changes  in  temperature, salinity, viscosity, and
availability  of  nutrients  effectively  limit  their  lateral  range. The  deaths  of  large
numbers  of  fish, for  example, can  be  caused  by  temporary  horizontal  shifts  of
water  masses  in  the  ocean. Water  pressure  normally  limits  the  vertical  range  of
nekton.

Fish may appear to exist everywhere in the oceans, but they are more abun-
dant near continents and islands and in colder waters. Some fish, such as salmon,
ascend  freshwater  rivers  to  spawn. Many  eels  do  just  the  reverse, growing  to
maturity  in  freshwater  and  then  descending  the  streams  to  breed  in  the  great
depths of the ocean.

Benthos (Bottom Dwellers)
The  term  benthos (benthos * bottom)  describes  organisms  living  on  or  in  the
ocean bottom. Epifauna (epi * upon, fauna * animal) live on the surface of the
sea  floor, either  attached  to  rocks  or  moving  along  the  bottom. Infauna (in *
inside, fauna * animal)  live  buried  in  the  sand, shells, or  mud. Some  benthos,
called nektobenthos, live on the bottom yet also have the ability to swim or crawl
through the water above the ocean floor (such as flat-fish, octopuses, crabs, and
sea urchins). Examples of benthos are shown in Figure 12.6.

The shallow coastal ocean floor contains a wide variety of physical and nutri-
tive conditions, which have allowed a great number of animal species to develop.
Moving across the bottom from the shore into deeper water, the number of ben-
thos species per square meter may remain relatively constant, but the biomass of
benthos organisms decreases. In addition, the shallow coastal areas are the only
locations where large marine algae (often called  seaweeds ) attached to the bot-
tom are found because these are the only areas of the sea floor that receive suffi-
cient sunlight.

Throughout  most  of  deeper  parts  of  the  sea  floor, animals  live  in  perpetual
darkness, where photosynthetic production cannot occur. They must feed on each
other  or  on  whatever  outside  nutrients  fall  from  the  productive  zone  near  the
surface.

The  deep-sea  bottom is an  environment of  coldness, stillness, and  darkness.
Under these conditions, life progresses slowly, and organisms that live in the deep

term
seaweed because  they  thought  these  organisms
were  a  nuisance.  They  clogged  harbors,  entangled
vessels,  and  washed  up  on  the  beach  in  useless
bunches after storms. Although they could be eaten,
they  could  not  be  consumed  in  large  quantities.
Historically,  all  marine  algae  (except  microscopic
species)  had  similarities  to  weeds  on  land,  so  they
have become known collectively as  seaweeds.

the 

It  turns  out,  however,  that  these  organisms  are
vital to coastal ecosystems, so marine biologists pre-
fer to call them  marine algae.  To differentiate them
from  the  microscopic  planktonic  species  of  algae,
large  marine  algae  are  often  called  marine  macro
algae.   The  branching  types  of  brown  algae  (phylum
Phaeophyta) are called  kelp.

Today marine macro algae have many uses. They
are  used  as  a  thickener  and  emulsifier  in  many  prod-
ucts  (such  as  toothpaste)  and  foods  (such  as  ice
cream). Cooking recipes sometimes call for small quan-
tities of  sea vegetable,  and nori, a type of red alga, is
used to wrap sushi. Marine algae are used as fertilizer,
and some species have recently been touted as health
foods.  Marine  algae  are  discussed  in  Chapter  13,
Biological Productivity and Energy Transfer.

HYDROTHERMAL  VENT  BIOCOMMUNITIES Prior to the discovery of deep-sea
hydrothermal  vent  biocommunities  in  1977, marine  scientists  believed  that  only
sparse and small life existed on the deep-ocean floor. Then the first biocommunity
at a hydrothermal vent was discovered in waters 2500 meters (8200 feet) deep in
the Galápagos Rift off South America, demonstrating for the first time that high
concentrations of abundant and large deep-ocean benthos are possible. Because
the primary factor that limits life on the deep-ocean floor is sparse food supply,
the  scientists  wondered  how  the  hydrothermal  vent  organisms  were  able  to
obtain enough food to exist.

It turns out that bacteria-like archaea, which produce food not by photosyn-
thesis (for no sunlight is available) but instead thrive on sea floor chemicals, are
the base of this marine food web. As a result, the size of individuals and the total
biomass  in  hydrothermal  communities  far  exceed  those  previously  known  for
deep-ocean  benthos. These  biocommunities  are  discussed  in  Chapter  15,
Animals of the Benthic Environment.

12.3 How Many Marine Species Exist?
The  total  number  of  catalogued  species  on  Earth  in  both  marine  and  terrestrial
environments  is  currently  1.8  million; the  figure  is  constantly  increasing  as  new
species are discovered. Quite certainly, there are many marine species (maybe mil-
lions)  that  have  not  yet  been  identified  due  in  large  part  to  the  difficulty  and
expense of exploring the deep sea. Overall, as many as 2000 new species are cata-
loged each year. Therefore, the total number of species on Earth, known and still
undiscovered, has  been  estimated  to  be  between  3  million  and  100  million; the
most likely total number of species on Earth is estimated to be between 6 million
and 12 million.6 And, not all newly discovered species are microbes or small inver-
tebrates. In fact, species of frogs, lizards, birds, fish, and even mammals previously
unknown to science have been recently discovered in remote areas of the world.

6Note that this figure does not include the millions of species throughout geologic time that were
once living but are now extinct.

Which group of organisms has the most species on
Earth?

Although  you  might  expect  that  bacteria  or  other 
microbes  comprise  the  largest  number  of  species  on
Earth,  it s  actually . . . (wait  for  it) . . . insects,  which
comprise  56%  of  total  species  on  Earth  (more  than 
1  million  species  identified).  Of  insect  species,  nearly
half or  one  out  of  every  four  species  on  Earth are
beetles, such as ladybugs, fireflies, rhinoceros beetles,
soldier beetles, leaf beetles, rove beetles, click beetles,
dung beetles, bark beetles, scarabs, and weevils. Even
though insect species are incredibly abundant on land,
only 1400 species less than a quarter of 1% inhabit
the  ocean.  Of  those,  just  five  species  (sea  skaters  of
the genus Halobates) live in the open ocean; the rest
are coastal. Apparently, the lack of solid surfaces in the
open ocean is what has kept insects at bay.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Marine species represent 14% of the total number
of known species on Earth. The benthic environment,
which has large environmental variability, is home 
to 98% of the 250,000 known marine species.

Some of the difficulties of describing the extent to which the marine environment
is inhabited include the immense size of the marine habitat and its inaccessibility.
In addition, so little is known about marine organisms and some populations fluc-
tuate  greatly  each  season. An  ambitious  program  called  the  Census  of  Marine
Life (CoML) began in 2000 as a 10-year project by a team of 2000 researchers in
more than 70 countries to assess and explain the diversity, distribution, and abun-
dance of marine organisms in the world s oceans. While CoML has discovered a
large  number  of  marine  species  and  will  undoubtedly  add  more, there  are  cur-
rently 250,000 catalogued marine species, which represent only about 14% of all
known species on Earth (Figure 12.7).

Why Are There So Few Marine Species?
If the ocean is such a prime habitat for life and if life originated there, why do so
few of the world s species live in the ocean? The disparity is likely a result of the
fact that the marine environment is more stable than the terrestrial environment.
A major factor that leads to the creation of different species is the variability of
the environment: The more variable the environment, the more species are gener-
ally present. The higher environmental variability on land presents many oppor-
tunities for natural selection to produce new species to inhabit varied new niches,
which is one reason why tropical rainforests have such a high diversity of species.
Conversely, the relatively uniform conditions of the open ocean do not pressure
organisms to adapt, so there are fewer species there. In addition, ocean tempera-
tures are not only stable but also relatively low below the sunlit surface waters.
The rate of chemical reaction is slowed, which may further reduce the tendency
for speciation to occur.

Species in Pelagic and Benthic Environments
Figure 12.7 also shows that only 2% or about 5000 of the 250,000 known marine
species inhabit the pelagic (pelagios * of the sea) environment and live within the
water  column. The  other  98%  inhabit  the  benthic  (benthos * bottom) environ-
ment and live either in or on the sea floor. These numbers are minimums, how-
ever, because recent discoveries indicate that many more species may inhabit the
benthic environment than previously thought.

Why  do  most  marine  species  inhabit  the  benthic  environment?  The  ocean
floor contains numerous benthic environments (such as rocky, sandy, muddy, flat,
sloped, irregular, and  mixed  bottoms)  that  create  different  habitats  to  which
organisms have adapted. On the  other hand, most of the pelagic environment
especially that below the sunlit surface waters
is a watery world that is quite uni-
form from one region to the next and does not experience extreme environmental
variability to which organisms need to be adapted in order to survive.

12.4 How Are Marine Organisms

Adapted for the Physical
Conditions of the Ocean?

For organisms to survive, they must be able to adapt to conditions of their environ-
ment. The ocean s physical conditions provide benefits but also present challenges
to anything living within it.

For  example, the  marine  environment particularly  its  temperature

is  far
more stable than the terrestrial environment. As a result, ocean-dwelling organ-
isms have not developed highly specialized regulatory systems to adjust to sudden
changes that might occur within their environment. Marine organisms can, therefore,

12.4

355

be affected adversely by very small changes in tempera-
ture, salinity, turbidity, pressure, or other environmental
conditions.

Water  constitutes  more  than  80%  of  the  mass  of
protoplasm (proto * first, plasm * something molded),
which  is  the  substance  of  living  matter. In  fact, more
than  65%  of  your  body s  weight and  95%  of  a  jelly-
fish s weight
is water (Figure 12.8). Water carries dis-
solved within it the gases and minerals organisms need
to survive. Water is also a raw material in the photosyn-
thesis of food by marine phytoplankton.

Land  plants  and  animals  have  developed  complex
plumbing systems to retain water and to distribute it
throughout  their  bodies. The  inhabitants  of  the  open
ocean do not risk atmospheric desiccation (drying out),
however, because they live in an environment of abun-
dant water.

Need for Physical Support
One  basic  need  of  all  plants  and  animals  is  for  simple  physical  support. Land
plants, for example, have vast root systems that anchor the plants securely to the
ground. Land  animals  have  skeletons  and  combinations  of  appendages
legs,
arms, fingers, and toes

to support their entire weight.

In the ocean, water physically supports marine plants and animals. Organisms
such  as  photosynthetic  phytoplankton, which  must  live  in  the  upper  surface
waters of the ocean, depend primarily upon buoyancy and frictional resistance to
sinking to maintain their desired position. Still, maintaining position can be diffi-
cult, so  some  organisms  have  developed  special  adaptations  to  increase  their
efficiency. These adaptations are discussed in this and succeeding chapters.

Water s Viscosity
Viscosity (viscos * sticky) is a substance s internal resistance to flow. Recall from
Chapter 1 that a substance with high resistance to flow (high viscosity)
such as
toothpaste does not flow easily. Conversely, a substance that has low viscosity
such as water
flows more readily. Viscosity is strongly affected by temperature.
Tar, for example, must be heated to decrease its viscosity before it can be spread
onto roofs or roads.

The viscosity of ocean water increases as salinity increases and temperature
decreases. Thus, single-celled organisms that float in colder, higher viscosity waters
have less need for extensions to help them maintain their positions
near  the  surface. Figure  12.9 shows, for  example, that  a  warm-
water  floating  crustacean  has  ornate, featherlike  appendages,
whereas a cold-water variety does not.

(a)

THE IMPORTANCE OF ORGANISM SIZE The basic requirements
of  phytoplankton  are  that  they  (1)  stay  in  the  upper  portion  of
ocean water where solar radiation is available, (2) have available
necessary  nutrients, (3)  efficiently  take  in  these  nutrients  from
surrounding waters, and (4) expel waste materials. Their ingenious
size  and  shape  help  single-celled  phytoplankton  satisfy  these
requirements without needing specialized multiple cells.

Phytoplankton  cannot  propel  themselves, so  they  use  fric-
tional  resistance  to  maintain  their  general  position  near  the  sur-
face  of  the  water. Frictional  resistance  to  sinking  increases  as  an

FIGURE 12.10 Surface area to volume ratio of cubes
of different sizes. As the linear dimension of a cube 
increases, the ratio of surface area to volume decreases.
Thus, smaller bodies have a higher surface area to volume
ratio, which allows them to stay afloat more easily and 
efficiently exchange nutrients and wastes.

FIGURE 12.11 Warm-water diatom. Scanning electron
micrograph of the warm-water diatom Planktoniella sol,
which has a prominent marginal ring to increase its surface
area and prevent it from sinking (diameter * 60 microns,
or 0.0024 inch).

organism s  ratio  of  surface  area  to  volume  (mass)  increases. For  example,
Figure 12.10 shows the surface area to volume ratio of three different cubes and
illustrates  that  the  ratio  increases  as  an  organism s  size  decreases. In  the  figure,
cube a has twice the surface area per unit of volume of cube b and four times the
surface area per unit of volume as cube c. If the cubes were plankton, cube a would
have  four  times  the  resistance  to  sinking  per  unit  of  mass  as  cube  c, so  cube  a
would need to exert far less energy to stay afloat. Single-celled organisms, which
make up the bulk of photosynthetic marine life, clearly benefit from being as small
as possible. They are so small, in fact, that one needs a microscope to see them!

Photosynthetic  cells  take  in  nutrients  from  surrounding  water  and  expel
waste  through  their  cell  membranes. The  efficiency  of  both  functions  increases
with a higher surface area to volume ratio. Thus, if cubes a and c in Figure 12.10
were planktonic algae, cube a could take in nutrients and dispose of waste four
times more efficiently than cube c. This is why cells in all plants and animals are
microscopic, regardless of the overall size of the organism.

Diatoms one of the most important groups of phytoplankton often have
unusual appendages, needlelike extensions, or even rings (Figure 12.11) to increase
their surface area, thus preventing them from sinking below sunlit surface waters.
Other planktonic marine organisms particularly warm-water species use similar
strategies to stay afloat.

Some small organisms produce a tiny droplet of oil, which lowers their overall
density and increases buoyancy. Accumulations of vast amounts of these organ-
isms in sediment can produce offshore oil deposits if their droplets of oil are com-
bined, sufficiently maturated, and trapped in a reservoir.

Despite  adaptations  to  remain  in  the  upper  layers  of  the  ocean, organisms
still have a higher density than seawater, so they tend  to sink, if ever so slowly.
This is not a serious handicap, however, because wind causes considerable mixing
and turbulence near the surface. Turbulence, in turn, keeps these organisms posi-
tioned  to  bask  in  the  solar  radiation  needed  to  photosynthesize, producing  the
energy used by essentially all other members of the marine community.

VISCOSITY AND STREAMLINING As organisms increase in size, viscosity ceases
to enhance survival and instead becomes an obstacle. This is particularly true of
large organisms that swim freely in the open ocean. They must pursue prey or flee
predators, yet the faster they swim, the more the viscosity of water impedes
their  progress. Not  only  must  water  be  displaced  ahead  of  the  swimmer,
but water also must move in behind it to occupy the space that the animal
has vacated.

Figure  12.12 shows  the  advantage  of  streamlining, which  is  having  a
shape that offers the least resistance to fluid flow. Streamlining allows ma-
rine organisms to overcome water s viscosity and move more easily through
water. A streamlined shape usually consists of a flattened body, which pres-
ents a small cross section at the front end and a gradual tapering at the back
end to reduce the wake created by eddies. It is exemplified in the shape of
free-swimming fish (and in marine mammals such as whales and dolphins).

Temperature
Figure 12.13 compares extremes in land and ocean surface temperatures and
shows that ocean temperatures have a far narrower range than temperatures
on land. The minimum surface temperature of the open ocean is seldom much
below 
and the maximum surface temperature seldom exceeds
except in some shallow-water coastal regions, where the tem-
32°C

perature  may  reach 
40°C 
On  land, however, extremes  in  tempera-
tures have ranged from 
which represents a
temperature range more than four times greater than that experienced by the
ocean. This continental effect was discussed in Chapter 5.

Further, the  ocean  has  a  smaller  daily, seasonal, and  annual  temperature
range  than  that  experienced  on  land, which  provides  a  stable  environment  for
marine organisms. The reasons for this are fourfold:

1. Recall  from  Chapter  5 that  the  heat  capacity  of  water  is  much  higher  than
that  of  land, which  causes  land  to  heat  up  by  a  greater  amount  and  much
more rapidly than the ocean.

2. The warming of the ocean is reduced substantially because of evaporation, a

cooling process that stores excess heat as latent heat.

3. Radiation received at the surface of the ocean can penetrate several tens of
meters deep and distribute its energy throughout a very large mass. In con-
trast, solar radiation absorbed by land heats only a very thin surface layer.

4. Unlike  solid  land  surfaces, water  has  good  mixing  mechanisms  such  as  cur-
rents, waves, and  tides  that  allow  heat  from  one  area  to  be  transported  to
other areas.

In addition, the small daily and seasonal temperature variations are confined to
ocean surface waters and decrease with depth, becoming insignificant throughout the
deeper parts of the ocean. At ocean depths that exceed 1.5 kilometers (0.9 mile), for
example, temperatures hover around 3°C (37.4°F) year-round, regardless of latitude.

COMPARING  COLD-  AND  WARM-WATER  SPECIES Cold  water  is  denser  and
has a higher viscosity than warm water. These factors, among others, profoundly
influence marine life, resulting in the following differences between warm-water
and cold-water species in the marine environment:

Floating  organisms  are  physically  smaller  in  warm  waters  than  in  colder
waters. Small organisms expose more surface area per unit of body mass, which
helps them maintain their position in the lower viscosity and density of warm
seawater more easily.
Warm-water species often have ornate plumage to increase surface area, which
is strikingly absent in the larger cold-water species (see Figures 12.9 and 12.11).

Chapter 12 Marine Life and the Marine Environment

Warmer temperatures increase the rate of biological activity, which more than
doubles  with  an  increase  of  10°C  (18°F). Tropical  organisms  apparently  grow
faster, have a shorter life expectancy, and reproduce earlier and more frequently
than those in colder water.
There  are  more  species in warm  waters, but the  total  biomass of plankton  in
colder, high-latitude  waters  greatly  exceeds  that  of  the  warmer  tropics. Note
that the high biomass of plankton in high-latitude regions is not directly caused
by temperature or viscosity but rather indirectly by allowing the upwelling of
nutrients for phytoplankton.

Some animal species can live only in cooler waters, whereas others can live
only  in  warmer  waters. Many  of  these  organisms  can  withstand  only  very  small
temperature  changes  and  are  called  stenothermal (steno * narrow, thermo *
temperature). Stenothermal  organisms  are  found  predominantly  in  the  open
ocean at depths where large temperature ranges do not occur.

Other species are little affected by different temperatures and can withstand
large  and  even  rapid  changes  in  temperature. These  organisms  are  called
eurythermal (eury * wide, thermo * temperature) and are predominantly found
in shallow coastal waters where the largest temperature ranges are found and
in surface waters of the open ocean.

Salinity
The  sensitivity  of  marine  animals  to  changes  in  their  environment  varies  from
organism to organism. Those that inhabit estuaries, for example, such as oysters,
must be able to withstand considerable fluctuations in salinity. The daily rise and
fall of the tides forces salty ocean water into river mouths and draws it out again,
changing  the  salinity  considerably. During  floods, the  salinity  in  estuaries  can
reach extremely low levels. The coastal organisms that can tolerate large changes
in salinity are known as euryhaline (eury * wide, halo * salt).

Marine organisms that inhabit the open ocean, on the other hand, are seldom
exposed to a large variation in salinity. They have adapted to a constant salinity
and can tolerate only very small changes. These organisms are called stenohaline
(steno * narrow, halo * salt).

EXTRACTION  OF  SALINITY  COMPONENTS Some  organisms  extract  minerals
from ocean water particularly silica
to
construct  the  hard  parts  of  their  bodies, which  serve  as  protective  coverings. In
doing  so, they  reduce  the  amount  of  dissolved  material  in  ocean  water. For
example, phytoplankton (including diatoms) and microscopic protozoans such as
radiolarians  and  silicoflagellates  extract  silica  from  seawater. Coccolithophores,
foraminifers, most  mollusks, corals, and  some  algae  that  secrete  a  calcium
carbonate skeletal structure extract calcium carbonate from seawater.

DIFFUSION Molecules  of  soluble  substances, such  as  nutrients, move  through
water  from  areas  of  high concentration  to  areas  of  low concentration  until  the
distribution  of  the  substance  is  uniform  (Figure  12.14a). This  process  is  called
diffusion (diffuse * despersed) and is caused by random motion of molecules.

The  outer  membrane  of  a  living  cell  is  permeable  to  many  molecules.
Organisms may take in nutrients they need from the surrounding water by diffu-
sion of the nutrients through their cell walls. Because nutrients are usually plenti-
ful in seawater, they pass through the cell wall into the interior, where nutrients
are less concentrated (Figure 12.14b). In addition to passive diffusion, organisms
also import nutrients to cells by active transport.

After  a  cell  uses  the  energy  stored  in  nutrients, it  must  dispose  of  waste.
Waste passes out of a cell by diffusion, too. As the concentration of waste materi-
als becomes greater within the cell than in the water surrounding it, these materials
pass from within the cell into the surrounding fluid. The waste products are then

carried  away  by  circulating  fluid  that  services  cells  in  higher  animals, or  by  the
water that surrounds simple one-celled organisms.

OSMOSIS When  water  solutions  of  unequal  salinity  are  separated  by  a
semipermeable membrane (such as skin or the membrane around a living cell),
water  molecules  (but  not  dissolved  ions)  diffuse  through  the  membrane. Water
molecules  always  move  from  the  less concentrated  solution  into  the  more
concentrated  solution  in  a  process  called  osmosis (osmos * to  push)  (Fig-
ure 12.15a). Osmotic  pressure is  the  pressure  that  must  be  applied  to  the  more
concentrated solution to prevent water molecules from passing into it.

Osmosis  causes  water  to  move  through  an  organism s  skin  (its  semiperme-
able membrane) and affects both marine and freshwater organisms. If the salinity
of  an  organism s  body  fluid  equals  that  of  the  ocean, it  is  isotonic (iso * same,
tonos * tension), has  equal  osmotic  pressure, and  no  net  transfer  of  water  will
occur through the membrane in either direction (Figure 12.15b).

If seawater has a lower salinity than the fluid within an organism s cells, sea-
water will pass through the cell walls into the cells (always toward the more con-
centrated solution). This organism is hypertonic (hyper * over, tonos * tension),
which means it is saltier than the surrounding seawater.

If the salinity within an organism s cells is less than that of the surrounding
seawater, water from the cells will pass through the cell membranes out into the
seawater  (toward  the  more  concentrated  solution). This  organism  is  hypotonic
(hypo * under, tonos * tension) relative to the water outside its body.

In essence, osmosis is diffusion that produces a net transfer of water molecules
through a semipermeable membrane from the side with the greatest concentration
of water molecules to the side with the lesser concentration of water molecules.

During osmosis, three things can occur simultaneously across the cell membrane:

1. Water  molecules  move  through  the  semipermeable  membrane  toward  the

side with the lower concentration of water.

2. Nutrient  molecules  or  ions  move  from  where  they  are  more  concentrated

into the cell, where they are used to maintain the cell.

3. Waste molecules move from within the cell to the surrounding seawater.

Molecules  or  ions  of  all  the  substances  in  the  system  are  passing  through  the
membrane in both directions. A net transport of molecules of a given substance
always  occurs  from  the  side  on  which  they  are  most  highly  concentrated  to
the side where the concentration is less, until equilibrium is attained.

The  body  fluids  of  marine  invertebrates  (those  without  backbones)  such  as
worms, mussels, and octopuses, and the seawater in which they live, are nearly iso-
tonic. As a result, these organisms have not had to evolve special mechanisms to
maintain their body fluids at a proper concentration. This gives them an advan-
tage over their freshwater relatives, whose body fluids are hypertonic.

AN  EXAMPLE  OF  OSMOSIS:  MARINE  VERSUS  FRESHWATER  FISH Marine
fish have body fluids that are only slightly more than one-third as saline as ocean
water, possibly  because  they  evolved  in  low-salinity  coastal  waters. They  are,
therefore, hypotonic (less salty) compared to the surrounding seawater.

This salinity difference means that saltwater fish, without some means of reg-
ulation, would lose water from their body fluids into the surrounding ocean and
eventually  dehydrate. This  loss  is  counteracted, however, because  marine  fish
drink  ocean  water  and  excrete  the  salts  through  special  chloride-releasing  cells
located in their gills. These fish also help maintain their body water by discharging
a very small amount of very highly concentrated urine (Figure 12.16a).

Freshwater fish are hypertonic (internally more saline) compared to the very
dilute water in which they live. The osmotic pressure of the body fluids of such
fish  may  be  20  to  30  times  greater  than  that  of  the  freshwater  that  surrounds
them, so  freshwater  fish  risk  rupturing  cell  walls  from  excessive  quantities  of
water taken on through osmosis.

Why do my fingers get wrinkly when I stay in the
water for a long time?

It s  caused  by  water  molecules  passing  through  your
skin  (a  semipermeable  membrane)  due  to  osmosis.
The water molecules outside your body contained in
either pure water or seawater
flow into your skin cells
in  an  attempt  to  dilute  the  dissolved  particles  inside
those cells. After a short time in water, your skin cells
contain  many  more  water  molecules  than  before,
which hydrates your skin and causes it to look wrinkly.
The effect is most obvious on appendages such as fin-
gers and toes because they have a high surface area
per  unit  of  volume.  It s  only  a  temporary  condition,
though, because your body absorbs and excretes the
excess water molecules after you leave the water.

To  prevent  this, freshwater  fish  do  not  drink  water  and  their  cells  have  the
capacity to absorb salt. They also excrete large volumes of very dilute urine to reduce
the amount of water in their cells (Figure 12.16b).

Dissolved Gases
The amount of gases that dissolve in seawater increases as the temperature of seawa-
ter decreases, so cold water dissolves more gas than warm water. This helps vast phy-
toplankton communities develop in high latitudes during summer, when solar energy
becomes  available  for  photosynthesis. These  cold  waters  contain  an  abundance  of
dissolved gases, specifically carbon dioxide (which phytoplankton need for photosyn-
thesis) and oxygen (which all organisms need to metabolize their food). In addition,
the cold, oxygen-rich water of high-latitude regions sinks and flows along the ocean
bottom, supplying deep-sea organisms with an abundant supply of dissolved oxygen.
Most  animals  that  live  in  the  ocean except  air-breathing  marine
mammals and certain fishes must extract dissolved oxygen from seawa-
ter. How do they do this? Most marine animals have specially designed
fibrous respiratory organs called gills that exchange oxygen and carbon
dioxide  directly  with  seawater. Most  fish, for  instance, take  water  in
through  their  mouths  (which  gives  them  the  appearance  of  breathing
underwater), pass it through their gills to extract oxygen, and then expel
it through the gill slits on  the sides of their bodies (Figure 12.17). Most
fish need at least 4.0 parts per million (ppm) of dissolved oxygen in sea-
water  to  survive  for  long  periods, and  even  more  for  activity  and  rapid
growth. That s  why  aquariums  need  a  pump  to  continually  resupply

oxygen to the water in the tank.

During low-oxygen conditions, most marine animals
with gills cannot simply breathe air at the surface. Their
adaptations allow them to use only the oxygen dissolved
in water. If dissolved oxygen levels become low enough
(such as after an algae bloom when decomposition con-
sumes  dissolved  oxygen), many  marine  organisms  will
suffocate and die.

FIGURE 12.17 Gills on fish. Water is taken in through 
the mouth and passes through the gills, which extract dis-
solved oxygen. Afterward, water is exited through the gill
slits. Photo (inset) shows a blue-streaked cleaner wrasse
(Labroides dimidiatus) cleaning the gills of a map puffer
(Arothron mappa) in the Solomon Islands.

Gill  structure  and  location  vary  among  animals  of
different groups. In fishes, gills are located at the rear of
the mouth and contain capillaries. In higher aquatic invertebrates, they protrude
from the body surface and contain extensions of the vascular system. In mollusks,
they are inside the mantle cavity. In higher vertebrates (including humans), they
occur as rudimentary, nonfunctional gill slits, which disappear during embryonic
development.

Water s High Transparency
Water
including seawater has relatively high transparency compared to many
other substances, allowing sunlight to penetrate to a depth of about 1000 meters
(3300 feet) in the open ocean. The actual depth depends on the amount of turbidity
(suspended sediment) in the water, the amount of plankton in the water, latitude,
time of day, and the season.

Because  of  water s  high  transparency, many  marine  organisms  have  devel-
oped keen eyesight, which helps them locate and capture prey. To combat keen-
eyed  predators, many  marine  organisms  such  as  jellyfish  are  themselves  nearly
transparent, which  helps  them  blend  into  their  environment  (Figure  12.18). In
fact, almost  all  open-ocean  animals  not  otherwise  protected  by  teeth, toxins,
speed, or small size have some degree of invisibility. Only at depths where sun-
light never penetrates is transparency uncommon. Not only can transparency help
organisms elude their predators, it can also help organisms stalk their prey.

Other  organisms  hide  by  using  their  coloration  pattern  as  camouflage
(Figure 12.19a). Still others use countershading, which means they are dark colored
on top and light colored on bottom (Figure 12.19b), to blend into their environment.
Many fish especially flat fish have countershading so they cannot easily be seen
against the dark background of deep water or the ocean floor and they blend into
the sunlight when viewed from below. Other organisms undertake a daily vertical
migration to deeper, darker parts of the ocean to avoid becoming prey (Box 12.1).

In contrast to species trying to blend into their environment, many species of
tropical fish display bright colors (Figure 12.20). Why would they be brightly col-
ored if it makes them easily seen by predators? The bright markings of tropical
fish  may  be  an  example  of  disruptive  coloration, where  large, bold  patterns  of
contrasting  colors  tend  to  make  an  object  blend  in  when  viewed  against  an
equally variable, contrasting background such as a tropical reef. Zebras use this
principle to evade predators, tigers use it to conceal themselves from their prey,
and military uniforms are camouflaged in a similar way.

Even considering disruptive coloration, many tropical fish still don t seem to
blend into their environment. Perhaps the bright colors and distinctive markings
that make tropical fish more apparent make it easier to advertise their identity, to
attract mates, or to display weaponry such as spines or poison. Scientists have yet
to agree on why tropical fish have such vivid colors, but it must serve some biolog-
ical advantage or the fish wouldn t be so brightly colored.

FIGURE 12.18 Jellyfish. Jellyfish such as these moon jellies
(Aurelia aurita) are nearly transparent, which makes them
difficult for predators to see, especially in dim light.

A FALSE BOTTOM: THE DEEP SCATTERING LAYER (DSL)

Within  most  parts  of  the  ocean, there
exists  a  curious  feature  called  the  deep
scattering layer (DSL). It was discovered
when  the  U.S. Navy  was  testing  sonar
equipment  to  detect  enemy  submarines
early  in  World  War  II. On  many  of  the
sonar  recordings, a  mysterious  sound-
reflecting surface appeared that was much
too shallow to be the ocean floor. It was
often referred to as a  false bottom (see
Figure 3.1). What was even more surpris-
ing  was  that  the  depth  of  the  deep  scat-
tering  layer  changed  with  time. It  was
at a  depth  of  about  100  to  200  meters
(330 to 660 feet) during the night but was

as deep at 900 meters (3000 feet) during
the day.

With  the  help  of  marine  biologists,
sonar  specialists  were  able  to  determine
that  sonar  signals  were  reflecting  off
densely packed concentrations of marine
organisms  (Figure  12A). Investigation
with  plankton  nets, submersibles, and
detailed sonar revealed that the DSL con-
tains many different organisms, including
copepods  (which  constitute  a  large  pro-
portion  of  planktonic  animals), krill, and
lantern fish (family Myctophidae).

The  daily  movement  of  the  deep
scattering  layer  is  caused  by  the  vertical

migration  of  marine  organisms  that  feed
in  the  highly  productive  surface  waters
but  must  protect  themselves  from  being
seen  by  predators. Organisms  within  the
DSL ascend to the surface only at night to
feed under cover of darkness and then mi-
grate  to  deeper  (darker)  water  to  hide
during  the  day. Studies  reveal  that  the
daily  migration  of  the  DSL  causes  in-
creased vertical mixing of ocean waters.

Today, fish-finding  sonar  is  still  used
on  commercial  and  sport  fishing  trips  to
track  the  movement  of  fish  below  the
surface, often quite successfully.

Water pressure increases about 1 kilogram per square centimeter (1 atmosphere
or  14.7  pounds  per  square  inch)  with  every  10  meters  (33  feet)  of  water  depth.
Humans are not well adapted to the high pressures that exist below the surface
(Box 12.2). Even when diving to the bottom of the deep end of a swimming pool,
one can feel the dramatic increase in pressure in one s ears.

In  the  deep  ocean, water  pressure  is  on  the  order  of  several  hundred  kilo-
grams  per  square centimeter  (several  hundred  atmospheres, or  several tons per
square inch). How do deep-water marine organisms withstand pressures that can

easily  kill  humans?  Most  marine  organisms  lack  large  compressible  air  pockets
inside their bodies. They do not have lungs, ear canals, or other passageways as we
do, so  these  organisms  don t  feel  the  high  pressure  pushing  in  on  their  bodies.
Water  is  nearly  incompressible, moreover, so  their  water-filled  bodies  have  the
same amount of pressure  pushing outward and they are unaffected by the high
pressures found in deep-ocean environments.

A  few species appear  to  be  extremely  tolerant of  pressure  changes. In fact,
some  marine  species  that  are  found  in  nearshore  areas  can  also  be  found  at
depths of several kilometers.

12.5 What Are the Main Divisions of

the Marine Environment?

The  oceans  can  be  divided  into  two  main  environments. The  ocean  water  itself
is the  pelagic  environment, where  drifters  and  swimmers  play  out  their  lives  in
a complex food web. The ocean bottom is the benthic environment, where marine
algae  and  animals  that  do  not  float  or  swim  (or  at  least  not  very  well)  spend
their lives.

Pelagic (Open Sea) Environment
The pelagic environment can be divided into distinctive life zones called biozones
that possess unique physical characteristics, as shown in Figure 12.21.

FIGURE 12.20 Use of color by tropical fish. Many tropi-
cal fish such as this mandarinfish (Synchiropus splendidus)
have bright colors and bold patterns, which allow them to
blend into the environment by using disruptive coloration.
Alternatively, they may also stand out so that they can 
advertise their identity, sex, or weaponry.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
The ocean s physical support, viscosity, tempera-
ture, salinity, sunlit surface waters, dissolved gases,
high transparency, and pressure create conditions
to which marine organisms are superbly adapted.

pelagic and benthic environments.

DIVING INTO THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT

Throughout  history, humans  have  sub-
merged themselves in the marine environ-
ment  to  observe  it  directly  for  scientific
exploration, profit, or  adventure  (Fig-
ure 12B). As early as 4500 B.C., brave and
skillful divers reached depths of 30 meters
(100 feet) on one breath of air to retrieve
red  coral  and  mother-of-pearl  shells.
Later, diving bells (bell-shaped structures
full of trapped air) were lowered into the
sea  to  provide  passengers  or underwater
divers  with  an  air  supply. In  360  B.C.,
Aristotle, in  his  Problematum, recorded
the use by Greek sponge divers of kettles
full of air lowered into the sea. However,
technology  to  move  around  freely  while

breathing  underwater  was  not  developed
until  1943, when  Jacques-Yves  Cousteau
and Émile Gagnan invented the fully au-
tomatic, compressed-air  Aqualung. The
equipment  was  later  dubbed  scuba, an
acronym  for  self-contained  underwater
breathing apparatus, and it is used by mil-
lions of recreational divers today. By using
scuba, divers  can  experience  the  ocean
firsthand, leading  to  a  fuller  appreciation
of  the  wonder  and  beauty  of  the  marine
environment.

Those who venture underwater must
contend  with  many  obstacles  inherent  in
ocean  diving, such  as  low  temperatures,
darkness, and  the  effects  of  greatly
increased pressure. To combat
low 
specially
temperatures,
designed  clothing 
is  worn.
Waterproof, high-intensity div-
ing  lights  are  used  to  combat
darkness. To combat the dele-
terious  effects  of  pressure,
depth  and  duration  of  dives
must  be  limited. As  a  result,
most  scuba  divers  rarely  ven-
ture below a depth of 30 meters
(100  feet) where  the  pres-
sure is three times that at the
surface and  they  stay  there
less than 30 minutes.

FIGURE 12B Oceanographer and explorer

For instance, higher pressure causes more
nitrogen to be dissolved in a diver s body
and  may  cause  a  disorienting  condition
known  as  nitrogen  narcosis or  rapture  of
the  deep. Further, if  a  diver  surfaces  too
rapidly, expanding  gases  within  the  body
can  catastrophically  rupture  cell  mem-
branes (a condition called barotrauma).

In addition, when divers return to the
surface, they may experience decompression
sickness, which  is  also  called  caisson
disease, or  the  bends. The  bends  affects
divers who ascend to the lower pressure at
the  surface  too  rapidly, causing  nitrogen
bubbles  to  form  in  the  bloodstream  and
other  tissues  (analogous  to  the  bubbles
that form in a carbonated beverage when
the  container  is  opened). Various  symp-
toms can result, from nosebleed and joint
pain  (which  causes  divers  to  stoop  over,
hence  the  term  the  bends)  to  permanent
neurological injury and even fatal paraly-
sis. To avoid it, divers must ascend slowly,
allowing  time  for  excess  dissolved  nitro-
gen  to  be  eliminated  from  the  blood  via
the lungs.

they  returned 

Despite these risks, divers venture to
greater  and  greater  depths  in  the  ocean.
In  1962, Hannes  Keller  and  Peter  Small
made  an  open-ocean  dive  from  a  diving
bell  to  a  then  record-breaking  depth  of
304  meters  (1000  feet). Although  they
used  a  special  gas  mixture, Small  died
once 
the  surface.
Presently, the record ocean dive is 534 me-
ters (1750 feet), but researchers who study
the physiology of deep divers have simu-
lated a dive to 701 meters (2300 feet) in a
pressure  chamber  using  a  special  mix  of
oxygen, hydrogen, and  helium  gases.
Researchers  believe  that  humans  will
eventually be able to stay underwater for
extended periods of time at depths below
600 meters (1970 feet).

The  pelagic  environment  is  divided  into  neritic  and  oceanic  provinces  (Fig-
ure 12.21). The neritic (neritos * of the coast) province extends from the shore sea-
ward and includes all water less than 200 meters (660 feet) deep. Seaward of the
neritic province is the oceanic province, where depth increases beyond 200 meters
(660 feet). The oceanic province is further subdivided into four biozones as follows:

If animals that have large air pockets inside are 
affected by the extreme pressures at depth, how 
are sperm whales able to dive so deeply?

All marine mammals have lungs and breathe air and
certain  ones  have  special  adaptations  that  allow
them  to  make  extremely  deep  dives.  Sperm  whales,
for  example,  can  dive  to  more  than  2800  meters
(9200 feet) and stay submerged for more than two
hours  during  their  search  for  food!  They are  able  to
use small amounts of oxygen very efficiently and have
a  collapsible  rib  cage,  which  forces  air  out  and  col-
lapses  the  lungs,  thereby  closing  the  air  cavities
inside their bodies. Marine mammals and their adap-
tations are discussed in Chapter 14,  Animals of the
Pelagic Environment.

1. The epipelagic (epi * top, pelagios * of the sea) zone from the surface to a

depth of 200 meters (660 feet).

2. The  mesopelagic  (meso * middle, pelagios * of  the  sea) zone from  200  to

1000 meters (660 to 3280 feet).

3. The bathypelagic (bathos * depth, pelagios * of the sea) zone from 1000 to

4000 meters (3300 to 13,000 feet).

4. The  abyssopelagic  (a * without, byssus * bottom, pelagios * of  the  sea)
zone, which  includes  all  the  deepest  parts  of  the  ocean  below  4000  meters
(13,000 feet).

The  single  most  important  factor  that  determines  the  distribution  of  life  in
the  oceanic  province  is  the availability of  sunlight. Thus, in  addition  to the  four
biozones, the distribution of life in the ocean is also divided into zones based on
the availability of sunlight as follows:

The euphotic (eu * good, photos * light) zone extends from the surface to a
depth where enough light still exists to support photosynthesis, which is rarely
deeper  than  100  meters  (330  feet). The  euphotic  zone often  called  the  thin
sunlit surface layer accounts for only about 2.5% of the marine environment,
but as discussed in subsequent chapters, it is quite important for marine life.
The disphotic (dis * apart from, photos *light) zone has small but measurable
quantities of light. It extends from the euphotic zone to a depth where light no
longer exists usually about 1000 meters (3300 feet).
The aphotic (a * without, photos * light) zone has no light, so it exists below
about 1000 meters (3300 feet).

EPIPELAGIC ZONE The upper half of the epipelagic zone is the only place in the
ocean  where  there  is  sufficient  light  to  support  photosynthesis. The  boundary
between  the  epipelagic  and  mesopelagic  zones, at  200  meters  (660  feet), is  also
where the level of dissolved oxygen begins to decrease significantly (Figure 12.22,
red curve).

Oxygen decreases at this depth because no photosynthetic algae live below
about 150 meters (500 feet), and dead organic tissue descending from the biologi-
cally  productive  upper  waters  is  decomposing  by  bacterial  oxidation. Nutrient
content also increases abruptly below 200 meters (600 feet) (Figure 12.22, green
curve) and it is the approximate bottom of the mixed layer, seasonal thermocline,
and surface water mass.

MESOPELAGIC  ZONE A  dissolved  oxygen  minimum  layer  (OML) occurs  at  a
depth  of  about  700  to  1000  meters  (2300  to  3280  feet)  (Figure  12.22). The
intermediate-water  masses  that  move  horizontally  in  this  depth  range  often
possess the highest levels of nutrients in the ocean.

Organisms  capable  of  bioluminescence (bio * life, lumen * light, esc *
becoming), which have the ability to produce light biologically and  glow in the
dark, are common in the mesopelagic and deeper zones. In these areas below the
sunlit surface waters, having the ability to produce light has many advantages and
so the vast majority of organisms are capable of producing light. Examples of bio-
luminescent  organisms  include  certain  species  of  shrimp, squid, and  especially
deep-sea  fish  (Figure  12.23). The  mechanism  involved  in  allowing  organisms  to
bioluminesce  is  discussed  more  fully  in  Chapter  14, Animals  of  the  Pelagic
Environment.

BATHYPELAGIC  AND  ABYSSOPELAGIC  ZONES The  aphotic  (lightless)
bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zones represent over 75% of the living space in
the  oceanic  province. Many  completely  blind  fish  exist  in  this  region  of  total
darkness and all are small, bizarre-looking, and predaceous.

FIGURE 12.22 Abundance of dissolved oxygen and nutrients with depth. In 
surface water, oxygen is abundant due to mixing with the atmosphere and plant photosyn-
thesis, and nutrient content (phosphate) is low due to uptake by algae. At deeper depths,
oxygen decreases and produces an oxygen minimum layer (OML), which coincides with 
a nutrient maximum. Below that, nutrient levels remain high and oxygen increases as it is
replenished with high-oxygen cold water from polar regions (ppm * parts per million).

Many  species  of  shrimp  that  normally  feed  on
detritus7 become  predators  at  these  depths, where  the
food  supply  is  greatly  reduced  compared  to  surface
waters. Animals  that  live  in  these  deep  zones  feed
mostly upon one another. They have evolved impressive
warning devices and unusual apparatuses to make them
extremely efficient predators (Figure 12.23). Many also
have sharp teeth and extremely large mouths relative to
their body size.

Oxygen content increases with depth below the oxy-
gen  minimum  layer  because  it  is  replenished  by  deep
currents  originating  in  polar  regions  as  cold  surface
water  high  in  oxygen. The  abyssopelagic  zone  is  the
realm  of  the  bottom-water  masses, which  commonly
move in the direction opposite the deep-water masses in
the bathypelagic zone.

Benthic (Sea Bottom) Environment
The  transitional  region  from  land  to  sea  floor  above  the
spring  high  tide  line  is  called  the  supralittoral  (supra *
above, littoralis * the  shore) zone (see  Figure  12.21).

7Detritus (detritus * to lessen) is a catchall term for dead and decaying organic matter, including
waste products.

Commonly called the spray zone, it is covered with water
only  during  periods  of  extremely  high  tides  and  when
tsunami or large storm waves break on the shore.

The rest of the benthic, or sea floor, environment is
divided into two main units that correspond to the ner-
itic  and  oceanic  provinces  of  the  pelagic  environment
(see Figure 12.21):

The subneritic province extends from the spring high
tide shoreline to a depth of 200 meters (660 feet),
approximately encompassing the continental shelf.
The suboceanic province includes the benthic envi-
ronment below 200 meters (660 feet).

SUBNERITIC  PROVINCE The  subneritic  province  is
subdivided  into  the  littoral  and  sublittoral  zones. The
intertidal  zone (the  zone  between  high  and  low  tides)
coincides  with  the  littoral  (littoralis * the  shore) zone.
The  sublittoral  (sub * below, littoralis * the  shore)
zone, or  shallow  subtidal  zone, extends  from  low  tide
shoreline out to a depth of 200 meters (660 feet).

The sublittoral zone consists of inner and outer regions. The inner sublittoral
zone extends to the depth at which marine algae no longer grow attached to the
ocean  bottom  (approximately  50  meters  [160  feet]), so  the  seaward  boundary
varies. All photosynthesis seaward of the inner sublittoral zone is carried out by
floating microscopic algae.

The  outer  sublittoral  zone extends  from  the  inner  sublittoral  zone  out  to  a
depth of 200 meters (660 feet) or the shelf break, which is the seaward edge of the
continental shelf.

SUBOCEANIC  PROVINCE The  suboceanic  province  is  subdivided  into  bathyal,
abyssal, and hadal zones. The bathyal (bathus * deep) zone extends from a depth
of  200  to  4000  meters  (660  to  13,000  feet)  and  corresponds  generally  to  the
continental slope.

The  abyssal  (a * without, byssus * bottom) zone extends  from  a  depth  of
4000 to 6000 meters (13,000 to 20,000 feet) and includes more than 80% of the
benthic  environment. The  ocean  floor  of  the  abyssal  zone  is  covered  by  soft
oceanic sediment, primarily abyssal clay. Tracks and burrows of animals that live
in this sediment can be seen in Figure 12.24.

The hadal (hades * hell)8 zone extends below 6000 meters (20,000 feet), so it
consists only of deep trenches along the margins of continents. Animal communi-
ties  that  are  found  in  these  deep  environments  have  been  isolated  from  each
other, often resulting in unique adaptations.

8The inhospitable high-pressure environment of the hadal zone is, in fact, aptly named.

such as this sea

Chapter 12 Marine Life and the Marine Environment

Chapter in Review

A  wide  variety  of  organisms  lives  in  the  ocean, ranging  in  size  from
microscopic bacteria and algae to blue whales. All living things belong to
one of three major domains (branches) of life: Archaea, simple microscopic
bacteria-like creatures; Bacteria, simple life forms consisting of cells that
usually lack a nucleus; and Eukarya, complex organisms (including plants
and animals) consisting of cells that have a nucleus.

Organisms are further divided into five kingdoms: Monera, single-celled
organisms  without  a  nucleus; Protoctista, single-  and  multicelled  organ-
isms with a nucleus; Fungi, mold and lichen; Plantae, many-celled plants;
and  Animalia, many-celled  animals. Classification  of  organisms  involves
placing  individuals  within  the  kingdoms  into  increasingly  specific  group-
ings of phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species, the last two of which
denote  an  organism s  scientific  name. Many  organisms  also  have  one  or
more common names.

Marine  organisms  can  be  classified  into  one  of  three  groups  based  on
habitat and mobility. Plankton are free-floating forms with little power of
locomotion; nekton are swimmers; and benthos are bottom dwellers. Most
of the ocean s biomass is planktonic.

Only about 14% of all known species inhabit the ocean, and more than
98% of marine organisms are benthic. The marine environment especially
the pelagic environment
is much more stable than the terrestrial environ-
ment, so there is less pressure on marine organisms to diversify.

Marine organisms are well adapted to life in the ocean. Those organisms
that  have  established  themselves  on  land  have  had  to  develop  complex
systems for support and for acquiring and retaining water.

Both  algae, which  must  stay  in  surface  waters  to  receive  sunlight, and
small animals that feed on them lack an effective means of locomotion. To
keep from sinking below sunlit surface waters, they depend on their small
size and  other  adaptations  to  increase  their  ratio  of  surface  area  to  body
mass, which  gives  them  high  frictional  resistance  to  sinking. Their  small
size also allows them to efficiently absorb nutrients and dispose of wastes.

Many nektonic organisms have developed streamlined bodies so they can
overcome the viscosity of seawater and move through it more easily.

Surface temperature of the world ocean does not vary on a daily, season-
ally, or yearly basis as much as on land. Organisms living in warm water tend
to be individually smaller, have ornate plumage, comprise a greater number
of species, and constitute a much smaller total biomass than organisms living
in  cold  water. Warm-water  organisms  also  tend  to  live  shorter  lives  and
reproduce earlier and more frequently than cold-water organisms.

Osmosis  is  the  passing  of  water  molecules  through  a  semipermeable
membrane from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower con-
centration. If  the  body  fluids  of  an  organism  and  ocean  water  are  sepa-
rated  by  a  membrane  that  allows  water  molecules  to  pass  through, the
organism  may  become  severely  dehydrated  from  osmosis. Many  marine
the  salinity  of  their  body  fluids  is
invertebrates  are  essentially  isotonic
similar  to  that  of  ocean  water. Most  marine  vertebrates  are  hypotonic
the salinity of their body fluids is lower than that of ocean water, so they
tend to lose water through osmosis. Freshwater organisms are essentially
the salinity of their body fluids is greater than the water in
all hypertonic
which they live, so they tend to gain water through osmosis.

Most  marine  animals  extract  oxygen  through  their  gills. Many  marine
organisms have well-developed eyesight because water is so transparent. To
avoid  being  seen  and  consumed  by  predators, many  marine  organisms  are
transparent, camouflaged, countershaded, or  disruptively  colored. Unlike
humans, most marine organisms are unaffected by the high pressure at depth
because they do not have large internal air pockets that can be compressed.

The marine  environment  is  divided  into  pelagic  (open  sea)  and benthic
(sea  bottom)  environments. These  regions  are  further  divided  based  on
depth and have varying physical conditions to which marine life is superbly
adapted. One of the most important layers of the pelagic environment is
the  euphotic  zone, which  includes  the  sunlit  surface  waters  and  contains
enough sunlight to support photosynthesis.

BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY
AND ENERGY TRANSFER

Producers  are  organisms  that  photosynthesize  their  own  food  from  carbon  dioxide, water, and
sunlight. Their ability to capture solar energy and bind it into their food sugars is the basis of food for
all  other  organisms  in  the  marine  biological  community  (except  those  near  hydrothermal  vents,1
where chemosynthesis is the major source of  food energy). As such, the ocean s producers are the
foundation of the oceanic food web.

Photosynthetic producers in the ocean include plants, algae, and bacteria. Because there are few
true marine plants and large species of marine algae play only a minor role, microscopic marine algae
and bacteria comprise the majority of organisms responsible for the conversion of solar energy. These
microscopic  organisms
called  phytoplankton are  mostly  scattered  throughout  the  ocean s  sunlit
surface waters and represent the largest community of organisms in the marine environment.

In this chapter, we ll examine primary productivity and the factors that cause it to vary, describe
various  types  of  photosynthetic  marine  organisms, discuss  productivity  in  different  regions  of  the
ocean, examine feeding relationships such as food chains and food webs, and explore environmental
issues related to marine fisheries.

13.1 What Is Primary Productivity?
Primary  productivity is  the  rate  at  which  energy  is  stored  by  organisms  through  the  formation  of
organic  matter  (carbon-based  compounds)  using  energy  derived  from  solar  radiation  during
photosynthesis ( photo * light, syn * with, thesis * an arranging) or from chemical reactions during
chemosynthesis (chemo * chemistry, syn * with, thesis * an  arranging).2 This  organic  matter  can
then be used as food for other organisms. Although chemosynthesis supports hydrothermal vent bio-
communities along oceanic spreading centers, it is much less significant than photosynthesis in world-
wide marine primary production. In fact, 99.9% of the ocean s biomass3 relies either directly or indi-
rectly  on  organic  matter  supplied  by  photosynthetic  primary  productivity  as  its  source  of  food. As
such, the discussion of primary productivity presented here will focus on photosynthetic productivity.
Chemically, photosynthesis is a reaction in which energy from the Sun is stored in organic mole-
cules. In photosynthesis (Figure 13.1, top), plant cells capture light energy and store it as sugars. As
a chemical  reaction, the  photosynthetic  equation  is  reversible; this  process  is  called  respiration
(Figure 13.1, middle). The equations are also shown chemically (Figure 13.1, bottom). Note that this

Measurement 
of Primary Productivity
Various properties of the ocean can
be  measured  to  give  an  approxima-
tion  of  the  amount  of  primary  pro-
ductivity. One  of  the  most  direct 
at-sea  methods  is  to  capture  plank-
ton  in  cone-shaped  nylon  plankton
nets (Figure  13.2). These  fine  mesh
nets which  resemble  windsocks  at
airports
filter  plankton  from  the
ocean as they are towed at a specific
depth  by  research  vessels. Analysis
of  the  amounts  and  types  of  organ-
isms  captured  reveals  much  about
the productivity of the area.

FIGURE 13.1 Photosynthesis (top), respiration
(middle), and representative reactions viewed chemi-
cally (bottom). The process of photosynthesis, which is 
accomplished by plants, is represented in the upper panel.
The second panel shows respiration, which is done by ani-
mals. Both processes are shown chemically in the third 
panel. (Note that this is the same image as Figure 1.20.)

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Primary productivity is the rate at which carbon 
(organic matter) is produced by microbes, 
algae, and plants mostly through photosynthesis 
but also includes chemosynthesis.

Other  methods  include  lower-
ing specially designed bottles into the ocean, analyzing the amount of radioactive
carbon  in  seawater, or  even  monitoring  ocean  color  with  orbiting  satellites.
Photosynthetic  organisms  such  as  phytoplankton (phyto * plant, planktos *
wandering) use the green pigment chlorophyll (khloros * green, phylum * leaf)
to capture energy from the Sun and perform photosynthesis. The color of surface
waters is strongly  affected  by the  amount  of chlorophyll, so ocean  color  can be
used as an approximation of phytoplankton abundance and, in turn, productivity.
One  such  instrument  that  conducts  ocean  color  measurements  is  the  SeaWiFS
(Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) instrument aboard the SeaStar satellite,
which  began  operating  in  1997. It  replaced  Nimbus-7 s  Coastal  Zone  Color
Scanner instrument, which operated between 1978 and 1986. Today, SeaWiFS meas-
ures the color of Earth s surface with a radiometer and provides global coverage of
estimated ocean chlorophyll levels as well as land vegetation every two days.

Factors Affecting Primary Productivity
In  the  ocean, the  two  main  factors  that  limit  the  amount  of  photosynthetic  pri-
mary  productivity  are  the  availability  of  nutrients  and  the  availability  of  solar
radiation. Sometimes  other  variables
can also limit primary productivity if they become scarce in seawater.

such  as  the  amount  of  carbon  dioxide

AVAILABILITY  OF  NUTRIENTS The  distribution  of  life  throughout  the  ocean s
breadth and depth depends mainly on the availability of nutrients such as nitrate,
phosphorus, iron, and  silica  that  are  needed  by  phytoplankton. Where  the
physical conditions supply large quantities of nutrients, marine populations reach
their  greatest  concentration. To  understand  where  these  areas  are  found, the
sources of nutrients must be considered.

Water  in  the  form  of  runoff  erodes  the  continents, carrying  material  to  the
oceans and depositing it as sediment on the continental margins. Runoff also dis-
solves and transports substances such as nitrates and phosphates, which are the
basic  nutrients  for  phytoplankton. Nitrates  and  phosphates  are  also  the  basic
ingredients in all garden and farm fertilizers.

Through photosynthesis, phytoplankton combine these nutrients with carbon
dioxide and water to produce the carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that the rest of
the ocean s biological community depends upon for food.

13.1 What Is Primary Productivity?

FIGURE 13.2 Plankton nets. These large, cone-shaped,
fine-mesh plankton nets being washed are lowered into the
water and towed behind a research vessel to collect plankton.

The  continents  are  the  major  sources  of  these  nutrients, so  the  greatest
concentrations of marine life are found along the continental margins. The con-
centration of marine life decreases, however, as the distance from the continental
margins into the open sea increases. The vast depth of the world s oceans and the
great distance  between  the  open  ocean and the coastal  regions  where nutrients
are concentrated account for these differences.

Often, the lack of certain nutrients can limit productivity, particularly nitro-
gen  (as  nitrates)  and  phosphorus. As  a  result, these  compounds  are  among  the
most  studied  in  chemical  oceanography. Comparatively, nitrogen  compounds
involved in photosynthesis may be 10 times the total nitrogen compound concen-
tration that can be measured as a yearly average. This level implies that the solu-
ble  nitrogen  compounds  must  be  completely  recycled  up  to  10  times  per  year.
Available phosphates may be turned over up to four times per year.

Carbon  is  an  important  element  in  productivity, too, because  carbon  is  the
basic  component  of  all  organic  compounds  (including  carbohydrates, proteins,
and fats). In the ocean, however, various forms of carbon are quite abundant, so
there  is  no  scarcity  of  carbon  for  photosynthetic  production. Thus, carbon  does
not limit productivity.

When nutrients are not limiting productivity, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen
to  phosphorus  in  the  tissues  of  algae  is  in  the  proportion  of  106:16:1  (C:N:P),
which  is  called  the  Redfield  ratio after  American  oceanographer  Alfred  C.
Redfield, who first described it in 1963. This ratio is also observed in zooplankton
that  feed  on  diatoms, and  in  most  ocean  water  samples  taken  worldwide.
Moreover, phytoplankton take up nutrients in the ratio in which they are avail-
able in the ocean water and pass them on to zooplankton in the same ratio. When
these plankton and animals die, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus are restored to
the water in this same ratio.

Recent studies in the waters near Antarctica and the Galápagos Islands reveal
that  photosynthetic  production  is  low  even  though  the  concentration  of  all
nutrients except  iron is  high.4 Production  is  high  only  in  regions  of  shallow
water downcurrent from islands or landmasses where a significant amount of iron
from rocks and sediments is dissolved in water.

AVAILABILITY  OF  SOLAR  RADIATION Photosynthesis  cannot  proceed  unless
light energy (solar radiation) is available. Despite the atmosphere s thickness of
more  than  80  kilometers  (50  miles), its  high  transparency  allows  sunlight  to
penetrate it quite readily, so land-based plants almost always have an abundance
of solar radiation to conduct photosynthesis.

In the clearest ocean water, solar energy may be detected to depths of only
about 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) and, even then, the amount reaching these depths is
inadequate for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis in the ocean, therefore, is restricted
to the uppermost surface waters and those areas of the sea floor where the water
is shallow enough to allow light to penetrate.

The  depth  at  which  net  photosynthesis  becomes  zero  is  called  the
compensation depth for photosynthesis. The euphotic (eu * good, photos * light)
zone extends from the surface down to the compensation depth for photosynthe-
sis, which  is  approximately  100  meters  (330  feet)  in  the  open  ocean. Near  the
coast, the euphotic zone may extend to less than 20 meters (66 feet) because the
water  contains  more  suspended  inorganic  material  (turbidity)  or  microscopic
organisms that limit light penetration.

How  do  the  two  factors  necessary  for  photosynthesis

the  supply  of  nutri-
ents  and  the  presence  of  solar  radiation differ  between  coastal  areas  and  the
open  ocean?  In  the  open  ocean  (far  from  continental  margins), solar  energy

4The idea of fertilizing the ocean with iron to stimulate productivity and increase the amount of car-
bon dioxide gas absorbed by the ocean is discussed in Chapter 16, The Oceans and Climate Change.

374

Chapter 13

Biological Productivity and Energy Transfer

extends  deeper  into  the  water  column, but  concentration  of  nutrients  is  low. In
coastal regions, on the other hand, light penetration is much less, but the concentra-
tion of nutrients is much higher. Because the coastal zone is much more productive,
nutrient availability must be the most important factor affecting the distribution of
life in the oceans.

Light Transmission in Ocean Water
The graph in Figure 13.3 shows that most solar energy falls in the range of wave-
lengths  called  visible  light. This  radiant  energy  from  the  Sun  powerfully  affects
three major components of the oceans:

1. The major wind belts of the world, which produce ocean currents and wind-
driven ocean waves, ultimately derive their energy from solar radiation. Wind
belts and ocean currents strongly influence world climates.

2. A  thin  layer  of  warm  water  at  the  ocean  surface, created  by  solar  heating,
overlies the great mass of cold water that fills most of the ocean basins. This is
the  life layer where most marine life exists.

3. Photosynthesis can occur only where sunlight penetrates the ocean water, so
phytoplankton and most animals that eat them must live where the light is, in
the relatively thin layer of sunlit surface water.

THE  ELECTROMAGNETIC  SPECTRUM The Sun radiates a wide range of wave-
lengths of electromagnetic radiation. Together they comprise the electromagnetic
spectrum, which  is  shown  in  the  upper  part  of  Figure  13.3. Only  a  very  narrow
portion  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum  is  visible  to  humans  as  visible  light.
We call  it  visible light  because  our  electromagnetic  sensors our  eyes are
adapted to detect only the wavelengths in the visible region. In essence, our eyes
tune into the visible light wavelengths, just as a radio  tunes into specific radio

waves.

Visible light can be further divided by wavelength into violet, blue, green, yel-
low, orange, and red energy levels. Together, these different wavelengths produce
white  light. The  shorter  wavelengths  of  energy  to  the  left  of  visible  light  (for
example, X rays and gamma rays) damage tissue in high enough doses. The longer
wavelengths of energy to the right of visible light (for example, infrared, microwaves,
and radio waves) are used for heat transfer and communication.

THE  COLOR  OF  OBJECTS Light  from  the  Sun  includes  all  the  visible  colors.
Most of the light we see is reflected from objects. All objects absorb and reflect
different  wavelengths  of  light, and  each  wavelength  represents  a  color  in  the
visible spectrum. Vegetation, for example, absorbs most wavelengths except green
and yellow, which they reflect, so most plants look green. Similarly, a red jacket
absorbs all wavelengths of color except red, which is reflected.

The  lower  part  of  Figure  13.3 shows  how  the  ocean  selectively  absorbs  the
longer wavelength colors (red, orange, and yellow) of visible light. The true colors
of objects can be observed in natural light only in the surface waters because only
there can all wavelengths of the visible spectrum be found. Red light is absorbed
within  the  upper  10  meters  (33  feet)  of  the  ocean, and  yellow  is  completely
absorbed before a depth of 100 meters (330 feet). Thus, the shorter wavelength
portion  of  the  visible  spectrum  is  all  that  can  be  transmitted  to  greater  depths
(mostly blue light with some violet and green wavelengths), and even then, their
intensity is low. In the open ocean, sunlight strong enough to support photosynthe-
sis occurs only with the euphotic zone to a depth of 100 meters (330 feet), and no
sunlight penetrates below a depth of about 1000 meters (3300 feet).

Biological Productivity and Energy Transfer

A Secchi (pronounced  SECK-ee ) disk, such as the one shown in Figure 13.4,
is used to measure water transparency, and based on that, the depth of light pene-
tration  can  be  estimated. The  Secchi  disk  is  named  after  its  inventor, Angelo
Secchi, an Italian astronomer who first used the device to measure water clarity
of lakes in 1865. It consists of a disk about 40 centimeters (16 inches) in diameter
attached to a line that is marked off at regular intervals. After the disk is lowered
into the ocean, the depth at which it can last be seen indicates the water s clarity.
Increased  turbidity, which  includes  microorganisms  and  suspended  sediment,
increases the degree of light absorption, thus decreasing the depth to which visi-
ble light can penetrate into the ocean.

WATER COLOR AND LIFE IN THE OCEANS The color of the ocean ranges from
deep  indigo  (blue)  to  yellow-green. Why  are  some  areas  of  the  ocean  blue,
whereas  others  appear  green?  Ocean  color  is  influenced  by  (1)  the  amount  of
turbidity  from  runoff  and  (2)  the  amount  of  photosynthetic  pigment, which
increases with increasing biological production.

Coastal  waters  and  upwelling  areas  are  biologically  very  productive  and
almost always yellow-green in color because they contain large amounts of yellow-
green microscopic marine algae and suspended particles. These materials disperse
solar  radiation  so  that  the  wavelengths  for  greenish  or  yellowish  light  are
scattered most.

Water in the open ocean particularly in the tropics

lacks productivity (and
turbidity), so it is usually a clear, indigo-blue color. Water molecules disperse solar
radiation so that the wavelength for blue light is scattered most. The atmosphere
scatters blue light, too, which is why clear skies are blue.

Although photosynthetic marine algae and bacteria are microscopic, they
occur in such large numbers that they can change the color of ocean to such a
degree  that  orbiting  satellites  are  able  to  measure  that  change  from  space.
Figure 13.5, for  example, shows  a  SeaStar  satellite/SeaWiFS  instrument  view
of ocean  chlorophyll, which  is  an  approximation  for  productivity. The  figure
shows  high chlorophyll  concentrations  (highly  productive  areas)  in  light  green
color, which are called eutrophic (eu * good, tropho * nourishment). Generally,
eutrophic  waters  are  found  in  shallow-water  coastal  regions, areas  of  up-
welling, and  high-latitude  regions. Alternatively, areas  of  low  chlorophyll
concentration  (low  productivity)  are  shown  in  dark  blue  color, are  called
oligotrophic (oligo * few, tropho * nourishment), and are found in the open
oceans of the tropics.

Why Are the Margins of the Oceans 
So Rich in Life?
If the stability of the ocean environment is ideal for sustaining life, why are the
richest  concentrations  of  marine  organisms  in  the  very  margins  of  the  oceans,
where  conditions  are  the  most  unstable?  For  example, characteristics  of  the
coastal ocean include:

Water depths that are shallow, allowing much greater seasonal variations in
temperature and salinity than the open ocean.
A water column that varies in thickness in the nearshore region in response to
tides that periodically cover and uncover a thin strip of land along the margins
of the continents.
Breaking waves in the surf zone that release large amounts of energy, which
has been carried for great distances across the open ocean.

Each  of  these  conditions  stresses  organisms. In  spite  of  hardships, however,
new species have evolved over the vast expanse of geologic time that spans billions

Photosynthetic productivity is limited in the marine
environment by the amount of sunlight and the
supply of nutrients. Upwelling greatly enhances the
conditions for life by lifting cold, nutrient-rich water
to the sunlit surface.

of  years  by  the  process  of  natural  selection5 to  fit  every  imaginable  biological
niche even  in  environments  that  pose  difficulties  for  organisms. In  fact, many
organisms  have  adapted  to  live  under  adverse  conditions
such  as  coastal
environments as long as nutrients are available.

Along continental margins, some areas have more abundant life than others.
What  characteristics  create  such  an  uneven  distribution  of  life?  Again, only
those basic requirements for the production of food need be considered. For ex-
ample, areas that have the greatest biomass have the lowest water temperatures,
too, because cold water contains higher amounts of nutrients than warm water.
These nutrients  stimulate  phytoplankton growth  and  phytoplankton growth, in
turn, profoundly affects the distribution of all other life in the oceans.

UPWELLING AND NUTRIENT SUPPLY As discussed in Chapter 7, upwelling is a
flow of deep water toward the surface that brings water from depths below the
euphotic  zone. This  deep  water  is  rich  in  nutrients  and  dissolved  gases  because
there are no phytoplankton at these depths to consume these compounds. When
chilled water from below the surface rises, it hoists nutrients from the depths to
the  surface, where  phytoplankton  thrive  and  make  food  for  larger  organisms
copepods, fish, and on up to larger organisms such as whales.

Highly  productive  areas  of  coastal  upwelling are  found  along  the  western
margins  of  continents, where  surface  currents  are  moving  toward  the  equator
(Figure  13.6). Ekman  transport  (see  Chapter  7)  causes  surface  water  to  move
away from these coasts, so nutrient-rich water from depths of 200 to 1000 meters
(660 to 3300 feet) constantly rises to replace it.

13.2 What Kinds of Photosynthetic

Marine Organisms Exist?

Many  types  of  marine  organisms  photosynthesize. Mostly, they  are  represented
by microscopic bacteria and algae but also include larger forms of algae and seed-
bearing plants.

Seed-Bearing Plants (Anthophyta)
The only members of kingdom Plantae that exist in the marine environment belong
to  the  highest  group  of  plants, the  seed-bearing  members  of  phylum  Anthophyta
(antho * a  flower, phytum * a  plant), which  occur  exclusively  in  shallow  coastal
areas. Eelgrass (Zostera), for example, is a grasslike plant with true roots that exists
primarily in the quiet waters of bays and estuaries from the low-tide zone to a depth
of  6 meters  (20  feet). Surf  grass  (Phyllospadix)  (Figure  13.7), which  is  also  a  seed-
bearing  plant  with  true  roots, is  typically  found  in  the  high-energy  environment  of
exposed rocky coasts from the intertidal zones down to a depth of 15 meters (50 feet).
Other seed-bearing plants are found in salt marshes and include grasses (mostly
of  the  genus  Spartina), whereas  mangrove  swamps  contain  primarily  mangroves
(genera  Rhizophora and  Avicennia). All  of  these  plants  are  important  sources  of
food and protection for the marine animals that inhabit nearshore environments.

Macroscopic (Large) Algae
Various types of marine macro algae (the  seaweeds ) are typically found in shal-
low waters along the ocean margins. These algae are usually attached to the bot-
tom, but  a  few  species  float. Algae  are  classified  in  part  on  the  color  of  the
pigment they contain (Figure 13.8). Although modern classification of algae uses
more than just its color, the division of algae into groups based on color is still a
useful means of describing the different types of algae.

BROWN  ALGAE The brown algae of the phylum Phaeophyta (phaeo * dusky,
phytum * a plant) include the largest members of the attached (not free-floating)
species of marine algae. Their color ranges from very light brown to black. Brown
algae occur primarily in temperate and cold-water areas.

The  sizes  of  the  brown  algae  range  widely. One  of  the  smallest  is  Ralfsia,
which  occurs  as  a  dark  brown  encrusting  patch  in  upper  and  middle  intertidal
zones. One  of  the largest  is  bull  kelp  (Pelagophycus), which  may  grow  in  water
deeper than 30 meters (100 feet) and extend to the surface. Other types of brown
algae include Sargassum (Figure 13.8a) and Macrocystis (Figure 13.8b).

GREEN ALGAE Although green algae of phylum Chlorophyta (khloros * green,
phytum * a  plant)  are  common  in  freshwater  environments, they  are  not  well
represented in the ocean. Most marine species are intertidal or grow in shallow bay
waters. They contain the pigment chlorophyll, which gives them their green color.
They grow only to moderate size, seldom exceeding 30 centimeters (12 inches) in
the largest dimension. Forms range from finely branched filaments to thin sheets.

Various species of sea lettuce (Ulva), a thin membranous sheet only two cell
layers  thick, are  widely  scattered  throughout  colder  water  areas. Sponge  weed

forms  (Figure  13.8d)  or  as  forms  that  encrust  surfaces. They  are  very  rare  in
freshwater. Red algae range from those just barely visible to the unaided eye to
3 meters  (10  feet)  long. While  found  in  both  warm  and  cold  waters, the  warm-
water varieties are relatively small.

The color of red algae varies considerably depending on its depth in the inter-
tidal  or  inner  sublittoral  zones. In  upper, well-lighted  areas, it  may  be  green  to
black or purplish. In deeper water zones, where less light is available, it may be
brown to pinkish red.

The  vast  majority  of  marine  photosynthetic  productivity  occurs  within  the
surface layer of the ocean to a depth of 100 meters (330 feet), which corresponds
to the depth of the euphotic zone. At this depth, the amount of light is reduced to
1% of that available at the surface. Remarkably, some deep-water species can sur-
vive on the very faint amount of sunlight that exists below the euphotic zone. For
example, a  species  of  red  alga  has  been  documented  growing  at  a  depth  of
268 meters  (880  feet)  on  a  seamount  near  San  Salvador  in  the  Bahamas  where
available light is only 0.0005% of that available at the surface.

Microscopic (Small) Algae
Microscopic  algae  are  either  directly  or  indirectly  the  source  of  food  for
more than 99% of marine animals. Most microscopic algae are phytoplankton
photosynthetic  organisms  that  live  in  the  upper  surface  waters  and  drift  with
currents
although  some  live  on  the  bottom  in  the  nearshore  environment,
where sunlight reaches the shallow ocean floor.

(see  Box  4.2). Diatoms  are  the  most

Diatom  tests  have  a  variety  of

DINOFLAGELLATES Dinoflagellates (dino * whirling, flagellum * a whip) belong
to the phylum Pyrrophyta (pyrrhos * fire, phytum * a plant) (Figures 13.9c and d).
They  possess  flagella (small, whiplike  structures)  for  locomotion, giving  them  a
slight  capacity  to  move  into  areas  that  are  more  favorable  for  photosynthetic
productivity. Dinoflagellates are rarely important geologically because their tests
are  made  of  cellulose, which  is biodegradable and not preserved as deposits  on
the sea floor.

Dinoflagellates sometimes exist in such great abundance that they color sur-
face  waters  red, producing  the  phenomenon  known  as  a  red  tide (Box  13.1),
which  has  nothing  to  do  with  tidal  phenomena. Red  tides  and  associated  algal
blooms that do not color the water red are more accurately called harmful algal
blooms (HABs) because they are marked by an overabundance of algae that is
detrimental to marine animals, humans, or the environment. In addition, many of
the  1100  species  of  dinoflagellates  undergo  structural  changes  in  response  to
changes in their environment (see Web Box 13.1).

Many dinoflagellates are associated with various types of seafood poisoning.
One example is ciguatera, which is a type of seafood poisoning caused by ingestion

Why does a red tide glow bluish-green at night?

Many  of  the  species  of  dinoflagellates  that  produce
red  tides  (most  notably  those  of  genus  Gonyaulax)
also  have  bioluminescent  capabilities that  is,  they
can  produce  light  organically.  When  the  organisms
are  disturbed,  they  emit  a  faint  bluish-green  glow.
When  waves  break  during  a  red  tide  at  night,  the
waves  are  often  spectacularly  illuminated  by  millions
of bioluminescent dinoflagellates. During these times,
one  can  easily  observe  marine  animals  moving
through the water because their bodies are silhouet-
ted  by  bioluminescent  dinoflagellates  that  light  up 
as they pass over the animals  bodies.

stimulate 
the  productivity  of  certain
dinoflagellates. During  these  times, up  to
2 million  dinoflagellates  may  be  found  in
1 liter (about 1 quart) of water, giving the
water a reddish color and causing what is
known  as  a  red  tide (Figure  13A). Red
tides are by no means a new phenomenon.
In  fact, the  Old  Testament  makes  refer-
ence to waters turning blood red, which is
most likely how the Red Sea got its name.
Although  many  red  tides  are  harm-
less  to  marine  animals  and  humans, they
can  still  be  responsible  for  mass  die-offs
of marine organisms. When huge numbers
of  dinoflagellates  die, oxygen  is  removed
from seawater during decomposition and
many  types  of  marine  life  literally  suffo-
cate  to  death. In  other  cases, dinoflagel-
lates  that  are  responsible  for  many  red
tides  produce  toxins  that  can  spread  to
many  different  types  of  organisms
including  humans  (Figure  13B). Karenia

ciguatera in humans usually involve a combination of gastrointestinal, neurologi-

Photosynthetic Bacteria
Until  recently, the  role  of  marine  bacteria  in  photosynthesis  has  been  largely
ignored. Because  of  the  extremely  small  size  of  bacteria, earlier  samplings  of
marine  life  completely  overlooked  them. Recent  improvements  in  sampling
methods for bacteria-sized organisms and genome sequencing studies have revealed
bacteria s incredible abundance and importance in the oceans.

For  example, one  of  the  first  types  of  marine  photosynthetic  bacteria  to  be
identified was Synechococcus, which are extremely abundant in coastal and open-
ocean environments, sometimes reaching densities greater than 100,000 cells per
milliliter (0.03 ounce) of seawater. At certain times and places, these cells can be
responsible for as much as half of the primary production of food in the ocean.
More recently, microbiologists have discovered an extremely small but abundant
bacteria named Prochlorococcus (Figure 13.10) that reaches concentrations many

times that of Synechococcus. In fact, Prochlorococcus has been estimated to con-
stitute  at  least  half  of  the  world  ocean s  total  photosynthetic  biomass, which
means that it is probably the most abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth.

In  addition, recent  large-scale  gene  sequencing  of  microbes in  the  Sargasso
Sea has revealed a host of new types of bacteria, suggesting substantial yet previ-
ously unrecognized oceanic microbial diversity. Clearly, microbes exert a critical
influence on marine ecosystems and carry significant implications for sustainabil-
ity, global climate change, ocean system cycles, and human health.

13.3 How Does Regional Primary

Productivity Vary?

Primary photosynthetic production in the oceans varies dramatically from place
to  place  (see  Figure  13.5). Typical  units  of  photosynthetic  production  are  in
weight  of  carbon  (grams  of  carbon)  per  unit  of  area  (square  meter)  per  unit  of
. Values  range  from  as  low  as
time  (year), which  is  abbreviated  as 
1 gC>m2>yr
in some
highly productive coastal estuaries (Table 13.1). This variability is the result of the
uneven distribution of nutrients throughout the photosynthetic zone and seasonal
changes in the availability of solar energy.6

ria Prochlorococcus.The bacteria
Prochlorococcus is the most abundant
and smallest of the marine phytoplank-
ton, reaching only about 0.6 microns
(0.00002 inch) in diameter.

About  90%  of  the  biomass  generated  in  the  euphotic  (sunlit)  zone  of  the
open ocean is decomposed into inorganic nutrients before descending below this
zone. The remaining 10% of this organic matter sinks into deeper water, where all
but  about  1%  of  it  is  decomposed. The  1%  that  reaches  the  deep-ocean  floor
accumulates there. The process of removing material from the euphotic zone to
the sea floor is called a biological pump because it  pumps carbon dioxide and

floor sediments.

Throughout  much  of  the  subtropical  gyres, a  permanent  thermocline (and
resulting pycnocline7) develops. It forms a barrier to vertical mixing, so it prevents
the resupply of nutrients to the sunlit surface layer. In the middle latitudes, a thermo-
cline develops only during the summer season and, in polar regions, a thermocline
does not usually develop. The degree to which waters develop a thermocline pro-
foundly affects the patterns of biological production observed at different latitudes.

Blue  whales

the  largest  of  all  whales  (see  Figure  14.20)

eat  mostly  zoo-
plankton and time their migration through temperate and polar oceans to coin-
cide with maximum zooplankton productivity. This enables the whales to develop
and  support  calves  that  can  exceed  7  meters  (23  feet)  in  length  at  birth.
The mother  blue  whale  suckles  the  calf  with  rich, high-fat  milk  for  six  months.
By the time the calf is weaned, it is over 16 meters (50 feet) long. In two years,
it will be  23  meters  (75  feet)  long, and  after  about  three  years, it  will  weigh 
55 metric tons (60 short tons)! This phenomenal growth rate gives some indica-
tion of the enormous biomass of small copepods and krill upon which these large
mammals feed.8

Density  and  temperature  change  very  little  with  depth  in  polar  regions
(Figure 13.11c), so these waters are isothermal (iso * same, thermo * tempera-
ture) and there is no barrier to mixing between surface waters and deeper, nutrient-
rich waters. In the summer, however, melting ice creates a thin, low-salinity layer
that does not readily mix with the deeper waters. This stratification is crucial to
summer  production  because  it  helps  prevent  phytoplankton  from  being  carried
into  deeper, darker  waters. Instead, they  are  concentrated  in  the  sunlit  surface
waters, where they reproduce continuously.

Nutrient concentrations (mostly nitrates and phosphates) are usually adequate
in high-latitude surface waters, so the availability of solar energy limits photosyn-
thetic productivity in these areas more than the availability of nutrients.

Productivity in Tropical Oceans
Perhaps  surprisingly, productivity  is  low  in  tropical  regions  of  the  open  ocean.
Because  the  Sun  is  more  directly  overhead, light  penetrates  much  more  deeply
into tropical oceans than temperate and polar waters, and solar energy is avail-
able  year-round, but  productivity  is  low  in  tropical  regions  of  the  open  ocean
because  a  permanent  thermocline  produces  a  stratification  (layering)  of  water
masses. This  prevents  mixing  between  surface  waters  and  nutrient-rich  deeper
waters, effectively eliminating any supply of nutrients from deeper waters below
(Figure 13.12).

At  about  20  degrees  north  and  south  latitude, phosphate  and  nitrate  con-
100 of  their  concentrations  in  temperate
centrations  are  commonly  less  than  1
oceans  during  winter. In  fact, nutrient-rich  waters  in  the  tropics  lie  below
150 meters (500 feet), with the highest concentrations between 500 and 1000 meters
(1640 and 3300 feet). So, productivity in tropical regions is limited by the lack
of nutrients (unlike polar  regions, where productivity  is  limited  by the  lack  of
sunlight).

Generally, primary production in tropical oceans occurs at a steady but rather
low rate. The total annual production of tropical oceans is only about half of that
found in temperate oceans.

Exceptions to the general pattern of low productivity in tropical oceans include

the following:

1. Equatorial upwelling. Where trade winds drive westerly equatorial currents
on  either  side  of  the  equator, Ekman  transport  causes  surface  water  to
diverge  toward  higher  latitudes  (see  Figure  7.10). This  surface  water  is
replaced by nutrient-rich water from depths of up to 200 meters (660 feet).
Equatorial upwelling is best developed in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

2. Coastal  upwelling. Where  the  prevailing  winds  blow  toward  the  equator
and along western continental margins, surface waters are driven away from
the  coast. They  are  replaced  by  nutrient-rich  waters  from  depths  of  200  to

Although tropical regions receive adequate sunlight year-
round, a permanent thermocline prevents the mixing of sur-
face and deep water. As phytoplankton consume nutrients in
the surface layer, productivity is limited because the thermo-
cline prevents replenishment of nutrients from deeper water.
Thus, productivity remains at a steady, low level. Red curve

900 meters (660 to 2950 feet). This upwelling promotes high primary produc-
tion along the west coasts of continents (see Figure 13.6), which can support
large fisheries.

3. Coral reefs. Organisms that comprise and live among coral reefs are superbly
adapted to low-nutrient conditions, similar to the way certain organisms are
adapted  to  desert  life  on  land. Symbiotic  algae  living  within  the  tissues  of
coral and other species allow coral reefs to be highly productive ecosystems.
Coral  reefs  also  tend  to  retain  and  recycle  what  little  nutrients  exist. Coral
reef ecosystems are discussed further in Chapter 15, Animals of the Benthic
Environment.

Productivity in Temperate Oceans
Productivity is limited by available sunlight in polar regions and by nutrient sup-
ply in the low-latitude tropics. In temperate (middle latitude) regions, a combina-
tion of these two limiting factors controls productivity as shown in Figure 13.13a
(which  shows  the  pattern  for  the  Northern  Hemisphere;
in  the  Southern
Hemisphere, the seasons are reversed).

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

The number and variety of tropical species on land is
astounding. I dont understand how the tropical
oceans can have such low productivity.

Life  on  land  does  not  necessarily  correspond  to  life  in
the  ocean!  Tropical  rainforests  support  an  amazing 
diversity  of  species  and  an  enormous  biomass.  In  the
tropical ocean, however, a strong, permanent thermo-
cline  limits  the  availability  of  nutrients  that  are  neces-
sary for the growth of phytoplankton. Without abundant
phytoplankton, not much else can live in the ocean. In
fact,  these  areas  are  often  considered  biological
deserts.  It  is  ironic  that  the  clear  blue  water  of  the 
tropics  so  prominently  displayed  in  tourist  brochures 
indicates seawater that is biologically quite sterile!

FIGURE 13.14 Comparison of productivity in tropical,
temperate, and polar oceans (Northern Hemisphere).
Seasonal variations in phytoplankton biomass, where the
total area under each curve represents annual photosynthetic
productivity.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
In polar regions, productivity peaks during the summer
and is limited by sunlight. In tropical regions, productiv-
ity is low year-round and is limited by nutrients. In tem-
perate regions, productivity peaks in the spring and fall
and is limited by a lack of solar radiation in the winter
and a lack of nutrients in the summer.

WINTER Productivity  in  temperate  oceans  is  very  low  during  winter, even
though nutrient concentration is highest at this time (Figure 13.13a). The water
column  is  isothermal, too, similar  to  polar  regions, so  nutrients  are  well
distributed throughout the water column. Figure 13.13b (winter) shows, however,
that the Sun is at its lowest position above the horizon during winter, so a high
percentage  of  the  available  solar  energy  is  reflected, leaving  only  a  small
percentage  to  be  absorbed  into  surface  waters. As  a  result, the  compensation
depth  for  photosynthesis  is  so  shallow  that  phytoplankton  do  not  grow  much.
The  absence  of  a  thermocline, moreover, allows  algal  cells  to  be  carried  down
beneath the  euphotic  zone  for  extended  periods  by  turbulence  associated  with
winter waves.

SPRING The Sun rises higher in the sky during spring (Figure 13.13b, spring),
so  the  compensation  depth  for  photosynthesis  deepens. A  spring  bloom of
phytoplankton  occurs  (Figure  13.13a)  because  solar  energy  and  nutrients  are
available, and a seasonal thermocline develops (due to increased solar heating)
that  traps  algae  in  the  euphotic  zone  (Figure  13.13b). This  creates  a
tremendous demand for nutrients in the euphotic zone, so the supply becomes
limited, causing  productivity  to  decrease  sharply. Even  though  the  days  are
lengthening  and  sunlight  is  increasing, productivity  during  the  spring  bloom
is limited by the lack of nutrients. In most areas of the Northern Hemisphere,
therefore, phytoplankton  populations  decrease  in  April  due  to  insufficient
nutrients  and  because  their  population  is  being  consumed  by  zooplankton
(grazers).

SUMMER The Sun rises even higher in the summer (Figure 13.13b, summer), so
surface  waters  in  temperate  parts  of  the  ocean  continue  to  warm. A  strong
seasonal  thermocline  is  created  at  a  depth  of  about  15  meters  (50  feet). The
thermocline, in turn, prevents vertical mixing, so nutrients depleted from surface
waters  cannot  be  replaced  by  those  from  deeper  waters. Throughout  summer,
the phytoplankton  population  remains  relatively  low  (Figure  13.13a). Even
though the compensation depth for photosynthesis is at its maximum, phytoplankton
can actually become scarce in late summer.

FALL Solar  radiation  diminishes  in  the  fall  as  the  Sun  moves  lower  in  the  sky
(Figure 13.13b, fall), so surface temperatures drop and the summer thermocline
breaks  down. Nutrients  return  to  the  surface  layer  as  increased  wind  strength
mixes  surface  waters  with  deeper  waters. These  conditions  create  a  fall  bloom
of phytoplankton, which  is  much  less  dramatic  than  the  spring  bloom  (Fig-
ure 13.13a). The  fall  bloom  is  very  short-lived  because  sunlight  (not  nutrient
supply, as in the spring bloom) becomes the limiting factor as winter approaches
to repeat the seasonal cycle.

Comparing Regional Productivity
Figure 13.14 compares the seasonal variation in phytoplankton biomass of tropi-
cal, north  polar, and  north  temperate  regions, where  the  total  area  under  each
curve represents photosynthetic productivity. The figure shows the dramatic peak
in productivity in polar oceans during the summer; the steady, low rate of produc-
tivity year-round in the tropical ocean; and the seasonal pattern of productivity
that occurs in temperate oceans. It also shows that the highest overall productiv-
ity occurs in temperate regions.

Regional productivity can also vary due to human influence. Nutrients added
to  the  ocean, for  example, can  result  in  dangerous  phytoplankton  blooms  and
other unwanted effects (Box 13.2).

OCEAN EUTROPHICATION AND THE DEAD ZONE

Ocean eutrophication (eu * good, tropho *
nourishment, ation * action) is the artifi-
cial enrichment of waters by a previously
scarce nutrient that can result in harmful
algal  blooms  (HABs). Human  activities
have  been  shown  to  contribute  to  ocean
eutrophication  when  excess  nutrients  in
the form of fertilizer, sewage, and animal
waste make their way into coastal waters.
Ocean eutrophication has been linked to
the  increasing  size  and  frequency  of  red
tides (see Box 13.1) as well as outbreaks
of toxic dinoflagellates (see Box 13.1).

Large  areas  of  ocean  eutrophication
are  associated  with  extensive  hypoxic
(hypo * under, oxic * oxygen) dead zones

of  oxygen-poor  water  that  often  occur
near  the  mouths  of  major  rivers  after
large  spring  runoffs. When  rivers  deliver
excess  nutrients  to  the  ocean, they  feed
profuse, widespread blooms of algae that
later  die  and  decompose, robbing  the
water  of  oxygen. Oxygen  levels  within
these  dead  zones  drop  from  above  5.0
parts per million (ppm) to below 2.0 ppm,
which is lower than most marine animals
can tolerate. Some of the more mobile ma-
rine organisms can flee the area, but it suf-
focates  and  kills  many  bottom-dwelling
organisms  that  cannot  swim  or  crawl  to
other  areas. Low  oxygen  levels  have  also
been shown to limit the growth and repro-
duction of marine life.

the  mouth  of 

One of the most promi-
nent  dead  zones is  the  one
that  forms  each  summer
near 
the
Mississippi River in the Gulf
of  Mexico  off  Louisiana
(Figure  13D). In  2002,
in
fact, it reached a record size
of  22,000  square  kilometers
(8500  square  miles) about
the same size as the state of
New  Jersey. Smaller  dead
zones  have  occurred  each

summer  in  the  region  for  decades, but
they  dramatically  increased  in  size  after
the record-breaking 1993 Midwest floods.
The  Gulf s  dead  zone  appears  to  be
especially
related  to  runoff  of  nutrients
nitrate
from  agricultural  activities  that
are  washed  down  the  Mississippi  River
and eventually reach the Gulf, where they
trigger algal blooms. Once these algae die
and  rain  down  on  the  sea  floor, bacteria
feed on them and on fecal matter, deplet-
ing the water of oxygen along the bottom.
Similar  nutrient  pollution  has  degraded
more than half of U.S. estuaries.

Worldwide, scientists have documented
more  than  400  dead  zones, although  the
Gulf s  dead  zone  is  the  largest  in  the
Western  Hemisphere. Proposals  to  combat
the spread of the Gulf s dead zone include
controlling nutrient runoff from agriculture,
preserving and utilizing wetlands that filter
runoff  before  it  enters  the  Gulf, planting
buffer  strips  of  trees  and  grasses  between
farm  fields  and  streams, altering  the  times
when fertilizers are applied, improving crop
rotation, and enforcing existing clean water
regulations. In this way, scientists, land plan-
ners, and policy makers are working to insti-
tute  an  action  plan  that  would  shrink  the
yearly Gulf of Mexico dead zone.

FIGURE 13D The Gulf of Mexico dead zone. Map (above) showing
Mississippi River drainage basin (gold) and enlargement (below) show-
ing extent of the 1999 Gulf of Mexico dead zone (red). The dead zone is
a low-oxygen region related to excess nutrients from agricultural runoff
from the Mississippi River that stimulates algal blooms. When the algae
die, decomposition consumes vast amounts of oxygen, creating an
anoxic dead zone that affects a multitude of marine life.

13.4 How Are Energy and Nutrients

Passed Along in Marine
Ecosystems?

A biotic community is the assemblage of organisms that live together within some
definable  area. An  ecosystem includes  the  biotic  community  plus  the  environ-
ment with which it exchanges energy and chemical substances. A kelp forest biotic

marine ecosystem. Energy enters a marine ecosystem as
radiant solar energy and is converted to chemical energy
through photosynthesis by producers. Metabolism in the fish

sion to mechanical energy. Energy is also dissipated within
the ecosystem as heat energy. Decomposers work to break
down the remaining energy after an organism dies.

community, for  instance, includes  all  organisms  living
within or near the kelp and receiving some benefit from
it. A kelp forest ecosystem, on the other hand, includes
all those organisms plus the surrounding seawater, the
hard substrate onto which the kelp is attached, and the
atmosphere where gases are exchanged.

Two  of  the  most  important  commodities  passed
along in marine ecosystems are energy and nutrients.

Flow of Energy in Marine
Ecosystems
Energy  flow  in  photosynthetic  marine  ecosystems  is
not  a  cycle  but  a  unidirectional  flow based  on  the
input  of  solar  energy. Consider  an  algae-supported
biotic community (Figure 13.15), where energy enters
the  system  when  algae  absorb  solar  radiation.
Photosynthesis converts this solar energy into chemi-
cal  energy, which  is  used  for  the  algae s  respiration.
This chemical energy is also passed on to the animals
that  consume  the  algae  for  their  growth  and  other  life  functions. The  animals
expend mechanical and heat energy, which are progressively less recoverable forms
of  energy, until  this  residual  energy  becomes  dissipated  within  the  ecosystem. In
essence, the ecosystem relies on a constant input of energy in the form of sunlight.

PRODUCERS,  CONSUMERS,  AND  DECOMPOSERS Generally, three  basic
categories  of  organisms  exist  within  an  ecosystem: producers, consumers, and
decomposers (Figure 13.15).

Producers  can  nourish  themselves  through  either  photosynthesis  or
chemosynthesis. Examples of producers include algae, plants, archaea, and photo-
synthetic bacteria, all of which are called autotrophic (auto * self, tropho * nour-
ishment) organisms. Consumers and decomposers, on the other hand, are called
heterotrophic (hetero * different, tropho * nourishment)  organisms  because
they depend either directly or indirectly on the organic compounds produced by
autotrophs for their food supply.

Consumers  eat  other  organisms  and  are  categorized  as  either  herbivores
(herba * grass, vora * eat), which  feed  directly  on  plants  or  algae; carnivores
(carni * meat, vora * eat), which feed only on other animals; omnivores (omni *
all, vora * eat), which feed on both; or bacteriovores (bacterio * bacteria, vora *
eat), which feed only on bacteria.

Decomposers such as bacteria break down organic compounds that comprise
detritus (detritus * to lessen) dead and decaying remains and waste products of
organisms
for  their  own  energy  requirements. In  the  decomposition  process,
compounds are released that are again available for use by autotrophs as nutrients.

Flow of Nutrients in Marine Ecosystems
Unlike the noncyclic, unidirectional flow of energy through a biotic community,
the flow of nutrients depends on biogeochemical cycles.9 That is, matter does not
dissipate (as energy does) but is cycled from one chemical form to another by the
various members of the biotic community.

BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING Figure 13.16 shows the biogeochemical cycling of
matter  within  the  marine  environment. The  chemical  components  of  organic

9Biogeochemical cycling is so named because it involves biological, geological (Earth processes), and
chemical components.

matter  enter  the  biological  system  through  photosynthesis  (or,
less  commonly, through  chemosynthesis  at  hydrothermal  vents).
These chemical components are passed on to animal populations
(consumers)  through  feeding. When  organisms  die, some  of  the
material is used and reused within the euphotic zone, while some
sinks  as  detritus. Some  of  this  detritus  feeds  organisms  living  in
deep water or on the sea floor, while some undergoes bacterial or
other decomposition processes that convert organic remains into
useable  nutrients  (nitrates  and  phosphates). When  upwelling
hoists  these  nutrients  to  the  surface  again, they  can  be  used  by
algae and plants to begin the cycle anew.

13.5 What Oceanic Feeding

Relationships Exist?

As  producers  make  food  (organic  matter)  available  to  the  con-
suming  animals  of  the  ocean, the  food  passes  from  one  feeding
population  to  the  next. Only  a  small  percentage  of  the  energy
taken  in  at  any  level  is  passed  on  to  the  next  because  energy  is
consumed and lost at each level. As a result, the producers  bio-
mass in the ocean is many times greater than the mass of the top
consumers, such as sharks or whales.

Feeding Strategies
For most marine animals, obtaining food occupies the majority of
their time. Some animals are fast and agile and are able to obtain
food  through  active  predation. Other  animals  move  more
leisurely or not at all and instead obtain food by filtering it from
seawater or locating it as deposits on the sea floor.

Decomposition

In suspension feeding, which is also called filter feeding, organisms use spe-
cially designed structures to filter plankton from seawater (Figure 13.17a). Clams,
for instance, bury themselves in sediment and extend siphons up to the surface.
They  pump  in  overlying  water  and  filter  from  it  suspended  plankton  and  other
organic matter.

In deposit feeding, organisms feed on food items that occur as deposits. These
deposits  include  detritus dead  and  decaying  organic  matter  and  waste  prod-
ucts
and the sediment itself, which is coated with organic matter. Some deposit
feeders, such as the segmented worm Arenicola (Figure 13.17b), feed by ingesting
sediment  and  extracting  organic  matter  from  it. Others, such  as  the  amphipod
Orchestoidea (Figure 13.17c), feed on more concentrated deposits of organic mat-
ter (detritus) on the sediment surface.

In carnivorous feeding, organisms directly capture and eat other animals. This
predation can be either passive or active. Passive predation involves waiting for
prey items and ensnaring them such as how a sea anemone feeds. Active preda-
tion involves seeking prey; examples include sharks and the sand star Astropecten
(Figure  13.17d), which  can  burrow  rapidly  into  sandy  beaches  and  feeds  vora-
ciously on crustaceans, mollusks, worms, and other echinoderms.

Trophic Levels
Chemical energy stored in the mass of the ocean s algae (the  grass of the sea ) is
transferred  to  the  animal  community  mostly  through  feeding. Zooplankton  are
herbivores, like cows,10 so they eat diatoms and other microscopic marine algae.

10In fact, zooplankton could be considered the miniature drifting  cows of the sea.

FIGURE 13.16 Biogeochemical cycling of matter. The
chemical components of organic matter enter the biological
system through photosynthesis and are passed on to con-
sumers through feeding. Detritus sinks and feeds organisms
living below the surface or undergoes decomposition, which
returns nutrients to the water that can be hoisted to the sur-
face by upwelling.

How likely am I to see a whale during a whale-
watching trip?

It depends on the area and the time of the year, but
generally  your  chances  are  quite  low  because  large 
marine organisms comprise such a small proportion
of  marine  life.  In  fact,  it  has  been  estimated  that
large  nektonic  organisms  such  as  whales  comprise
only one-tenth of 1% of all biomass in the sea! With
your knowledge of food pyramids, it should be no sur-
prise that the majority of the ocean s biomass is com-
prised  of  phytoplankton.  Perhaps  commercial  boat
operators  should  conduct  plankton-watching  trips!
Everyone  would  be  guaranteed  to  see  dozens  of  dif-
ferent species all that would be required is a plankton
net and a microscope.

FIGURE 13.18 Passage of energy through trophic 
levels. As food mass initially produced by phytoplankton
passes from herbivores to carnivores, a large percentage is
excreted by feces, used during respiration, or dies uneaten.
Thus, only about 10% of the food mass consumed by herbi-
vores is available for consumption by carnivores.

Transfer Efficiency
The transfer of energy between trophic levels is very inefficient. The effi-
ciencies of different algal species vary, but the average is only about 2%,
which means that 2% of the light energy absorbed by algae is ultimately
synthesized into food and made available to herbivores.

The gross ecological efficiency at any trophic level is the ratio of en-
ergy passed on to the next higher trophic level divided by the energy re-
ceived from the trophic level below. The ecological efficiency of herbivo-
rous  anchovies,
for  example, would  be  the  energy  consumed  by
carnivorous  tuna  that  feed  on  the  anchovies  divided  by  the  energy  con-
tained in the phytoplankton that the anchovies consumed.

Figure 13.18 shows that some of the chemical energy taken in as food
by herbivores is excreted as feces and the rest is assimilated. Of the assimi-
lated  chemical  energy, much  is  converted  through  respiration  to  kinetic
energy for maintaining life, and what remains is available for growth and
reproduction. Thus, only about 10% of the food mass consumed by herbi-
vores is available to the next trophic level.

Figure  13.19 shows  the  passage  of  energy  between  trophic  levels
through an entire ecosystem, from the solar energy assimilated by phyto-
plankton  through  all  trophic  levels  to  the  ultimate  carnivore humans.
Because energy is lost at each trophic level, it takes thousands of smaller
marine organisms to produce a single fish that is so easily consumed dur-
ing a meal!

The  efficiency  of  energy  transfer  between  trophic  levels  depends
on many  variables. Young  animals, for  example, have  a  higher  growth

efficiency  than  older  animals. In  addition, when  food  is  plentiful, animals  expend
more energy in digestion and assimilation than when food is scarce.

Most  ecological  efficiencies  in  natural  ecosystems  average  about  10%  but
range  between  6%  and  15%. There  is  some  evidence, however, that  ecological
efficiencies in populations important to present fisheries may run as high as 20%.
The true value of this efficiency is of practical importance because it determines
the size of the fish harvest that can safely be taken from the oceans without dam-
aging the ecosystem.

Food Chains, Food Webs, and the Biomass Pyramid
The loss of energy between each feeding population limits the number of feeding
populations in an ecosystem. If there were too many levels, there would not be
enough  energy  to  support  the  organisms  in  higher  and  higher  trophic  levels. In
addition, each feeding population must necessarily have less mass than the popu-
lation it eats. As a result, individual members of a feeding population are generally
larger in size and less numerous than their prey.

FOOD CHAINS A food chain is a sequence of organisms through which energy
is  transferred, starting  with  an  organism  that  is  the  primary  producer, then  an
herbivore, then one or more carnivores, finally culminating with the  top carnivore,

Because  energy  transfer  between

the  biomass  available  for  food  and  the

pods) that feed, in turn, upon diatoms (Figure 13.20).

FOOD WEBS Feeding relationships are rarely as simple as that of the Newfoundland
herring. more  often, top  carnivores  in  a  food  chain  feed  on  a  number  of  different
animals, each  of  which  has  its  own  simple  or  complex  feeding  relationships. This
constitutes a food web, as shown in Figure 13.20b for North Sea herring.

Animals that feed through a food web rather than a food chain are more likely to
survive because they have alternative foods to eat should one of their food sources
diminish in quantity or even disappear. Newfoundland herring, on the other hand, eat
only copepods, so the disappearance of copepods would catastrophically affect their
population. Conversely, Newfoundland herring are more likely to have a larger bio-
mass to eat, because they are only two steps removed from
the  producers, whereas  North  Sea  herring  are  three  steps
removed in some of the food chains within their web.

BIOMASS  PYRAMID The  ultimate  effect  of  energy
transfer between trophic levels can be seen in the oceanic
biomass  pyramid shown  in  Figure  13.21. It  shows  that
for the  survival  of  each  large  marine  organism, many
levels of progressively larger populations of smaller-sized
organisms  must  exist  to  support  those  higher  on  the
pyramid. In  essence, the  number  of  individuals and  total
biomass decrease at successive trophic levels because the
amount  of  available  energy  decreases. The  figure  also
shows that organisms increase in size at successive trophic
levels up the pyramid.

In  some  marine  environments,

inverted biomass
pyramids  can  occur. An 
inverted biomass  pyramid  can
exist, for  example, where  a  smaller  population  of  phyto-
plankton with a very high turnover rate supports a larger
population  of  zooplankton. As  a  result, oceanic  biomass
pyramids  can  have  a  variety  of  shapes, depending  on  the
turnover rates of different trophic levels.

Since well before the beginning of recorded history, humans have used the sea as
a  source  of  food. Over  the  past  several  decades, fisheries (fish  caught  from  the
ocean by commercial fishers) have provided billions of people around the world
nearly 20% of their protein intake, with less-developed nations relying on fish for
27% of their dietary protein.

Marine Ecosystems and Fisheries
Figure 13.22 shows that the world marine fishery is drawn from five ecosystems.
In  descending  order, they  are  (1)  nontropical  shelves, (2)  tropical  shelves,
(3) upwellings, (4) coastal and coral systems, and (5) open ocean. The largest pro-
portion  of  the  marine  fishery  is  found  in  highly  productive  shallow  shelf  and
coastal waters, whereas low productivity open ocean areas comprise only 3.8% of
the  total. Nearly  21%  of  the  world s  total  catch  is  from  very  highly  productive
upwelling areas, which represent only about 0.1% of the ocean surface area.

Overfishing
Fisheries harvest from the standing stock of a population, which is the mass present in
an ecosystem at a given time. Successful fisheries leave enough individuals from the
standing stock to repopulate the ecosystem after fisheries have made their harvest.

Overfishing occurs when harvesting of fish stocks takes place so rapidly that the
majority of the population is sexually immature and is therefore unable to reproduce.
Predictably, overfishing  results  in  the  decline  of  marine  fish  populations  and  the
reduction  of  a  fishery s  maximum  sustainable  yield  (MSY) (the  maximum  fishery
biomass that can be removed yearly and still be sustained by the fishery ecosystem).
According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the
United  Nations, 80%  of  the  523  world  marine  fish  stocks  for  which  assessment
information is available are classified as fully exploited, overexploited, or depleted/
recovering  from  depletion  (Figure  13.23). In  U.S. waters, the  story  is  much  the
same: 80%  of  the  191  commercial  fish  stocks  are  fully  exploited  or  overfished.
In U.K. waters, stocks  of  palatable  fish such  as  cod have  been  reduced  by
overfishing to less than 10% of what they were 100 years ago.

Overfishing also affects the size of fish in fisheries. For example, recent stud-
ies  indicate  that  fishing  practices  have  removed  90%  of  large  predatory  fish
species and, as a result, the fishing industry has concentrated on smaller fish that
occupy successively lower trophic levels (Box 13.3). Not only are big fish disap-
pearing  at  an  alarming  rate, but  the  ocean s  top  predators  are  now  only  about
one-half to one-fifth the size they once were, which affects entire marine ecosystems.
As a case in point, the removal of large predatory sharks along the East Coast by

FISHING DOWN THE FOOD WEB: SEEING IS BELIEVING

Marine scientists can measure the health
of an ecosystem by determining its origi-
nal  fish  abundance, diversity, and  size.
But how can these variables be assessed
effectively  for  periods  before  extensive
scientific  field  surveys  were  conducted?
Recently,
scientists  have  been  using
novel ways to estimate these parameters.
A  new  field  of  research  called  historical
marine  ecology uses  items  such  as  old
photographs, newspaper  accounts, ships
logs, cannery  records, and  even  old
restaurant  menus  to  estimate  the  type
and  quantity  of  fish  that  used  to  live  in
the sea.

Striking  evidence  of  past  fish  abun-
dance  and  size  comes  from  old  photo-
graphs. Certainly, people  have  always
enjoyed  having  their  picture  taken  with
the fish they catch. Loren McClenachan, a
graduate  student  at  Scripps  Institute  of
Oceanography  at 
the  University  of
California, San  Diego, found  a  historical
archive  of  old  photographs  in  Key West,
Florida,
in  the  Monroe  County  Public
Library. The archive allowed her to exam-
ine  fish  caught  by  day-trippers  at  coral
reef sites aboard a series of vessels called
Gulf  Stream and  Greyhound, which have
operated  out  of  Key  West  for  the  past
50 years.

By  comparing  old  photographs  with
newer  ones  (Figure  13E), it  is  apparent
that 
there  has  been  a  pronounced
decrease in both fish abundance and fish
size through the years. Research suggests
that chronic overfishing by both commer-
cial  and  recreational  fishers  is  the  likely
source  of  this  decline. In  fact, some
species  completely  disappear  over  time,
reflecting  a  loss  of  the  largest  fish  from
the coral reef environment. For example,

in  the  1950s, fishers  caught
huge  grouper  and  sharks. In
the  1970s, they  landed  a  few
grouper  but  more 
jack.
Today s  main  catch 
lacks
grouper  and  instead  consists
of small snapper, which once
weren t even deemed worthy
instead,
of  a  photograph;
they  were 
just  piled  up
below  the  hanging  racks.
Historical 
from
other regions throughout the
world also reveal astonishing
declines  in  most  fish  stocks.
Scientists  use 
the  phrase
"fishing down the food web"
to  describe  how  key  large
species  in  healthy  function-
ing  ecosystems  have  been 
replaced  by  progressively
smaller, less valuable species
that  occupy  lower  levels  of
the food web.

records 

Worldwide, fishers  typi-
cally  catch  the  biggest  ani-
mals  first, whether  turtles,
whales,
cod, or  grouper.
Then  they  catch  whatever  is
left
including  animals  so
young  that  they  haven t  re-
produced yet until, in some
cases, the  animals  are  gone.
To change human habits, it is
important  to  gain  a  clearer
picture  of  what  has  been
lost. In  the  Florida  Keys,
historical  photographs  pro-
vide  such  a  window  into  a
more  pristine  coral  reef
ecosystem that existed a half
century ago.

1980s (middle), and 2007 (below).

fishing practices during the past 35 years has allowed one of their
prey items, the cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus), to increase 20-
fold. As  a  result, shellfish  populations  such  as  the  bay  scallop
which are a major prey item of the rays have been decimated. In
fact, this  overabundance  of  rays  caused  the  closure  of  North
Carolina s century-old bay scallop fishery in 2004.

Recent  research  shows  that  fishing  can  induce  inherited
changes that cut the average growth rate, maturing time, and size
in  fish  from  generation  to  generation, which  has  some  severe
implications for the health and longevity of fisheries. In fact, a recent
study of the effect of pollution and fisheries on marine ecosystem
biodiversity projects that fish stocks will be depleted by 2048. Not
only will the loss of seafood threaten humans  food supplies but
the loss of fish will also seriously damage marine ecosystems.

Although it is widely assumed that recreational fishing has a minimal influ-
ence  on  most  species  of  fish, recreational  fishing  has  been  shown  to  have  an
impact on fish populations, too. A recent rigorous analysis of multiple U.S. fisheries
records  shows  that  for  some  threatened  sportfishing  species  such  as  red  drum,
bocaccio rockfish, and red snapper, recreational fishing actually poses more of a
threat than commercial fishing because of the size and number of fish taken by
recreational fishers. Thus, new fishing regulations that target recreational fishers
are needed to complement existing catch restrictions on the commercial sector.

Figure  13.24 shows  the  world  total  fish  production  in  marine  waters  since
1950. After increasing steadily for 35 years, the world catch of ocean fish finally
leveled  off  in  the  1990s. In  1998, in  fact, it  dipped  to  79.6  million  metric  tons
(87.6 million short tons).

How  much  fish  can  the  oceans  produce? The  National  Research  Council  esti-
mated  in  1999  that  the  maximum  catch  that  might  be  expected  from  the  oceans
is about  100  million  metric  tons  (110  million  short  tons). This  amount  might  be
exceeded, however, if new species
become significant new fisheries in the future. Based on current yields of traditional
fisheries, the United Nations FAO estimates that the maximum catch that might be
expected from the oceans is about 120 million metric tons (132 million short tons).

such as Antarctic krill, squid, and pelagic crabs

The reported worldwide catch, however, does not include additional organ-
isms caught but deemed undesirable and discarded, so the actual catch is likely
much  higher  than  the  reported  value. Unfortunately, this  suggests  that  the
amount of biomass removed by fishing exceeds that produced in the ocean, which
means that the oceans are being overfished.

Incidental Catch

Incidental catch, or bycatch, includes any marine organisms that are caught inci-
dentally by fishers seeking commercial species. On average, close to one-fourth of
the catch is discarded, although for some fisheries, such as shrimp, the incidental
catch  may  be  up  to  eight  times  larger  than  the  catch  of  the  target  species.
Incidental  catch  includes  birds, turtles, sharks, and  dolphins, as  well  as  many
species  of  noncommercial  fish. In  most  cases, these  animals  die  before  they  are
thrown  back  overboard, even  though  some  of  them  are  protected  by  U.S. and
international law. Globally, an estimated 20 million metric tons (32 million short
tons)  of  bycatch  is  produced  each  year  by  the  fishing  industry, accounting  for
nearly one-fourth of the world s total marine fish catch.

TUNA AND DOLPHINS Schools of yellowfin tuna are commonly found swimming
beneath spotted and spinner dolphins in the eastern Pacific Ocean (Figure 13.25).
Fishers  commonly  used  these  dolphins  to  locate  tuna  and  set  a  purse  seine  net
around the entire school (Figure 13.26). When an underwater line is drawn tight,

reported world total marine fish production, which begins 
to level off during the 1990s. The catch actually dipped to 
79.6 million metric tons in 1998.

Eastern Pacific spotted dolphins are often found swimming

Although the prey items of spotted dolphins and yellowfin
tuna are similar (squid and small fish), they probably feed at
different levels.

Is tuna labeled as  dolphin-safe  really safe to dolphins?

It depends on where the tuna is from, but the answer
is probably yes. Tuna and tuna products harvested in
the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean can only be labeled
as  dolphin-safe  in the United States if no nets were
intentionally set on dolphins during fishing and no dol-
phins were killed or seriously injured during the set in
which the tuna were caught. In the United States, the
National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS)  has  devel-
oped an extensive monitoring, tracking, and verification
program  to  ensure  that  only  tuna  and  tuna  products
that  meet  the  definition  of  dolphin-safe  are  indeed 
labeled  as  dolphin-safe.   This  program,  along  with
consumer awareness, has substantially reduced yearly
dolphin mortality, which numbered in the hundreds of
thousands in the 1980s. Recently, however, changes
to  the  definition  of  dolphin-safe   have  been  accepted
by  the  NMFS  that  address  international  trade  con-
cerns and allow more tuna to be imported from inter-
national sources, particularly from Mexico. Tuna from 
international  sources  caught  along  with  dolphins  may
be  labeled  dolphin-safe   in  the  United  States  as  long
as observers aboard fishing vessels certify that no dol-
phins  were  killed  or  seriously  injured  during  the
catch but this relies on the honesty of the observers.

the net traps the tuna underwater as well as the dolphins at
the surface.

The  problem  of  dolphin  deaths  caused  by  tuna  fishing
was graphically presented to the world in 1988 through video
footage taken by biologist Samuel F. La Budde of dolphins
struggling in tuna fishing nets. In 1990, under intense public
outcry and a boycott on tuna, the U.S. tuna canning industry
declared  that  it  would  not  buy  or  sell  tuna  caught  using
methods that kill or injure dolphins. In 1992, a special adden-
dum was added to the Marine Mammals Protection Act, fur-
ther protecting dolphins. As a result of these measures, purse
seine nets were modified so that dolphins could be released
alive. In spite of reducing dolphin mortality as bycatch, dol-
phin populations have not rebounded accordingly. Research
suggests that tuna fishing operations are still having a nega-
tive effect on dolphin populations by reducing dolphin sur-
vival and birth rates.

DRIFTNETS Another  means  of  netting  tuna  and  other
species is by use of driftnets, or gill nets, which are made of
monofilament  fishing  line  that  is  virtually  invisible  and
cannot be detected by most marine animals. Depending on
the  size  of  the  holes  in  the  net, it  is  highly  effective  at
catching anything large enough to become entangled in it.
As a result, driftnets often have high amounts of bycatch.

Up until 1993, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan had the largest driftnet fleets, deploying
as many as 1500 fishing vessels into the North Pacific and setting over 48,000 kilome-
ters (30,000 miles) of driftnets in one day. Although driftnetting was supposed to be
restricted to specific fisheries, some fishers who claimed to be fishing for squid were
involved  in  illegally  taking  large  quantities  of  salmon  and  steelhead  trout.
Driftnetters  were  also  targeting  immature  tuna  in  the  South  Pacific, which  could
result in the reduced abundance of South Pacific tuna. In addition, tens of thousands
of birds, turtles, dolphins, and other species were killed annually in these nets.

A prohibition against the importation of fish caught in driftnets was included
in the International Convention of Pacific Long Driftnet Fishing, signed in 1989.
Although driftnets are now banned by international law, some fishers continue to
use them illegally.

Fisheries Management
Fisheries management is the organized effort directed at regulating fishing activ-
ity with the goal of maintaining a long-term fishery. Fisheries management prac-
tices include assessing ecosystem health, determining fish stocks, analyzing fishing
practices  including  recommending  gear  modification, establishing  closed  areas,
and setting and enforcing catch limits. Unfortunately, however, fisheries manage-
ment has historically been more concerned with maintaining human employment
than preserving a self-sustaining marine ecosystem. For example, fisheries such as
anchovy, cod, flounder, haddock, herring, and sardine are suffering from overfish-
ing in spite of being managed (see Web Box 13.2).

One of the most pressing problems facing fisheries management results from
the  fact  that  some  fisheries  encompass  the  waters  of  many  different  countries,
including a variety of ecosystems. Some species of commercial fish, for instance,
are  raised  in  coastal  estuaries  and  migrate  long  distances  across  international
waters to their preferred environment. Fishing limits are difficult to enforce inter-
nationally and if human interference occurs at any location where the fish exist,
these  species  can  be  severely  reduced  in  number. Other  problems  include  the
degradation of many ecosystems that sustain fisheries, limited scientific analysis, a

lack of regulations enforcement (particularly on illegal/private fishers), poaching,
misreporting of catch and bycatch, political barriers, and inadequate guidance for
minimally regulated new fisheries.

REGULATION  OF  FISHING  VESSELS A  major  regulatory  failure  has  been  the
absence of restrictions on the number of fishing vessels. In 2004, according to the
FAO, the world s fishing fleet consisted of about 4 million vessels. Of these, about
1.3  million  were  engine-powered, mechanized  decked  vessels  engaged  in
commercial fishing, including 40,000 vessels over 100 gross tons in size (generally
more than 24 meters [80 feet] in length). Figure 13.27 shows that the number of
decked fishing vessels in the world more than doubled between 1970 and 1995,
and continues to increase. Many of these larger vessels use nets that can hold up
to  27,000  kilograms  (60,000  pounds)  of  fish  in  one  haul. In  addition, there  are
more  than  2.1  million  smaller  nondecked  fishing  vessels  that  are  owned  and
operated by artisanal fishers, mostly in Asia, Africa, and the Near East.

The increase in fishing vessels has resulted in an increased fishing effort, which
often leads to overfishing. In some locations, the fish are becoming so scarce that
the fishing effort costs more than what the catch is worth! In 1995, for instance, the
world fishing fleet spent $124 billion to catch $70 billion worth of fish. To make up
for  the  shortfall, many  governments  have  given  fishers  subsidies  in  the  form  of
cash payments totaling an estimated $30 34 billion yearly, which compounds the
problem by maintaining (or even increasing) the number of fishing vessels.

FISHERIES IN THE NORTHWEST ATLANTIC The effects of inadequate fisheries
management are illustrated by the history of fisheries in the northwest Atlantic.
Under management by the International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic
Fisheries, the fishing capacity of the international fleet increased 500% from 1966
to 1976; the total catch, however, rose by only 15%. This was a significant decrease
in the catch per unit of effort, which is a good indication that the fishing stocks of
the  Newfoundland Grand  Banks  area  were  being  overexploited. The  biologists
who recommended the total allowable fishing quotas for the major species within
this region complained that enforcement was lacking and that countries  quotas
were  being  bartered  in  a  game  of  international  politics. As  a  result, fishers
exceeded the total allowable catch set by the commission.

The difficulty of enforcing regulations by the international commission was
largely responsible for Canada s unilateral decision to extend its right to control
fish  stocks  for  a  distance  of  200  nautical  miles  (370  kilometers)  from  its  shores
beginning January 1, 1977. The United States followed with a similar action only
two months later.

Claiming coastal waters, however, proved to have limited effectiveness. After
essentially  all  coastal  nations  assumed  regulatory  control  over  their  coastal
waters, things  continued  to  deteriorate  and  overfishing  became  even  more  of  a
problem. The Canadian government, in fact, had to shut down the Grand Banks
fishery off Newfoundland in 1992, which resulted in the loss of about 40,000 jobs
and subsequent government outlays of more than $3 billion in welfare. This cost
far exceeds the value of the fishery, which generated no more than $125 million
during one of its best years.

A similar situation has emerged on Georges Bank, which lies in Canadian and
U.S. waters. On Georges Bank, however, tough international restrictions and proper
enforcement are beginning to bring back haddock and yellowtail flounder fisheries.
In  spite  of  protection, some  fish  stocks  in  the  North  Atlantic  have  not
rebounded as anticipated. Atlantic cod stocks, for example, continue to decrease
despite  sharply  curtailed  annual  catches. To  help  halt  the  cod s  decline, the
Canadian  government  in  2003  declared  cod one  of  the  North Atlantic s  most
impacted  fish  species
completely  off-limits  to  fishing. A  similar  decline  in  cod
stocks  is  also  occurring  in  European  waters, but  so  far  officials  have  rejected  a
proposed cod-fishing ban.

Does fish farming relieve some of the demand for 
wild fish?

Even  though  global  production  of  the  nearly  250
species of farmed fish and shellfish has quadrupled in
the past 20 years and now provides nearly half of all
seafood directly consumed by humans, some types of
aquaculture  have  actually increased the  demand  for
wild fish. This is because the farming of carnivorous
species  such  as  salmon,  tuna,  cod,  and  seabass 
requires large inputs of wild fish for feed. Some aqua-
culture  systems  further  reduce  wild  fish  supplies
through habitat modification, the collection of wild fish
for initially stocking aquaculture operations, and other
negative ecological impacts including waste disposal,
exotic  species  introduction,  and  pathogen  invasions,
all of which have probably contributed to the collapse
of fishery stocks worldwide. If the aquaculture indus-
try is to sustain its contribution to world fish supplies,
it must reduce wild fish inputs in feed and adopt more
ecologically sound management practices.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
The marine fishing industry suffers from 
overfishing, wasteful practices that produce a 
large amount of unwanted bycatch, and a 
lack of adequate fisheries management.

DEEP-WATER FISHERIES One of the results of depleting and/or banning certain
fish stocks is that the fishing industry then expands its efforts into the deep sea,
where there are few regulations. As compared to surface species, most deep-water
species have low metabolic and reproduction rates, which cause them to be severely
impacted  by  fishing. For  example, the  collapse  of Atlantic  cod  stocks  resulted  in
fishers seeking the deep-water Greenland halibut as a substitute. Predictably, that
species in now in danger of becoming overfished throughout the Atlantic.

The deep-water orange roughy fishery near Australia is another prime exam-
ple. It  was  developed  to  satisfy  the  middle-American  market  for  a  bland  white
fish. Even the name was picked through careful supermarket research (its origi-
nal moniker
the slimehead sounded far less appealing). And when that fishery
began its inevitable decline, the industry moved on to another deep-water species,
the Patagonian toothfish. It was renamed the Chilean sea bass, even though it is
neither  a  bass  nor  exclusively  Chilean. The  precipitous  decline  of  these  deep-
water fish has qualified them for endangered status.

Deep-sea ecosystems are beginning to feel the effect of this increased fishing
effort, too. For example, tall seamounts rise precipitously from the deep sea floor
and provide a unique environment that harbors many species of fish and deep-
water coral. To effectively catch fish here, fishers use large bottom-dragging trawl
nets. These  nets, however, do  long-lasting  damage  to  the  sea  floor  and  have
proven to negatively affect these slow-growing yet important ecosystems.

ECOSYSTEM-BASED  FISHERY  MANAGEMENT The  historic  record  of  fishery
management shows many examples of attempts to regulate a fish stock looking
only at an individual species. If fisheries are to remain viable in the future, marine
ecosystems  must  be  studied  to  document  the  natural  relationships  among
organisms in marine food webs, the critical environmental factors for the health
of the fishery, and the effects of removing so many organisms as fisheries catch. In
addition, critical fish habitats must be protected and fishing limits must be upheld
despite political factors. Only after such obstacles are overcome can a fishery be
successfully managed.

To  ensure  sustainable  fisheries  and  a  healthy  marine  environment  in  U.S.
waters, there has been a recent push to institute ecosystem-based fishery manage-
ment, which  employs  a  more  comprehensive  approach  to  understanding  fish
stocks  including  analysis  of  such  variables  as  fish  habitat, migration  routes, and
predator-prey  interactions. Ecosystem-based  fishery  management  essentially
reverses  the  order  of  management  priorities, starting  with  an  ecosystem  rather
than a target species. It also focuses on rebuilding fisheries on a global basis.

Research  has  shown  that  sustainable  fisheries  can  be  achieved  if  manage-
ment  strategies  are  adopted  that  remove  subsidies  and  give  individual  fishers  a
right  to  a  proportion  of  the  total  catch. By  removing  competition, fishers  of  all
types would then be encouraged to act to sustain the entire fishery because, as the
common  fish  stock  improves, each  individual s  quota  will  increase. In  this  way,
fishers  will  have  the  incentive  to  manage  the  stock  sustainably, thus  avoiding
overfishing and the eventual collapse of the fishery.

Recently, a study was conducted on the effectiveness of fisheries management
practices. Scientists analyzed six key parameters, including the scientific quality of
management recommendations, the transparency of converting recommendations
into  policy, the  enforcement  of  policies, the  influence  of  subsidies, fishing  effort,
and  the  extent  of  fishing  by  foreign  entities. Results  of  the  study  (Figure  13.28)
show that fisheries management, despite broad acceptance and commitments by
governments to initiatives for improvements, remains largely ineffective.

Seafood Choices
Consumer demand has driven some fish populations to the brink of disappearing.
However, consumers can help by making wise choices in the fish they consume by
purchasing  only  those  fish  that  are  from  healthy, thriving  fisheries. Certainly,

Chapter 13

Biological Productivity and Energy Transfer

Chapter in Review

Microscopic  planktonic  bacteria  and  algae  that  photosynthesize  represent
the largest biomass in the ocean. They are the ocean s primary producers
the
foundation of the ocean s food web. Organic biomass is also produced near
deep-sea  hydrothermal  springs  through  chemosynthesis, in  which  bacteria-
like organisms trap chemical energy by the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide.

The availability of nutrients and the amount of solar radiation limit the
such  as  nitrate,
photosynthetic  productivity in  the  oceans. Nutrients
phosphorus, iron, and  silica are  most  abundant  in  coastal  areas, due  to
runoff and upwelling. The depth at which net photosynthesis is zero is the
compensation depth for photosynthesis. Generally, algae cannot live below
this  depth, which  may  be  less  than  20  meters  (65  feet)  in  turbid  coastal
waters or as much as 100 meters (330 feet) in the open ocean.

Marine  life  is  most  abundant  along  continental  margins, where  nutrients
and sunlight are optimal. It decreases with distance from the continents and
with increased depth. In addition, cool water typically supports more abun-
dant life than warm water because cool water can dissolve more of the gases
necessary for life (oxygen and carbon dioxide). Areas of upwelling bring cold,
nutrient-rich water to the surface and have some of the highest productivities.

Ocean  water  selectively  absorbs  the  colors  of  the  visible  spectrum. Red
and yellow light are absorbed at relatively shallow depths, whereas blue and
green light are the last to be removed. Ocean water of low biologic produc-
tivity scatters the short wavelengths of visible light, producing a blue color.
Turbidity and photosynthetic algae in more productive ocean water scatter
more green light wavelengths, which produces a green color.

There are many different types of photosynthetic marine organisms. The
seed-bearing Anthophyta  are  represented  by  a  few  genera  of  nearshore
plants such  as  eelgrass  (Zostera), surf  grass  (Phyllospadix), marsh  grass
(Spartina), and  mangrove  trees  (genera  Rhizophora and  Avicennia).
Macroscopic  algae include  brown  algae (Phaetophyta), green  algae
(Chlorophyta), and  red  algae (Rhodophyta). Microscopic  algae include
diatoms and coccolithophores (Chrysophyta), and dinoflagellates (Pyrrophyta,
which are responsible for red tides).

A  thermocline  is  generally  absent  in  high-latitude  (polar)  areas, so
upwelling  can  readily  occur. The  availability  of  solar  radiation  limits

productivity more than the availability of nutrients. In low-latitude (tropi-
cal)  regions, however, a  strong  thermocline may  exist  year-round, so  the
lack  of  nutrients  limits  productivity, except  in  areas  of  upwelling  or  near
coral reefs. In middle latitude (temperate) regions, productivity peaks in the
spring  and  fall  and  is  limited  by  lack  of  solar  radiation  in  the  winter  and
lack of nutrients in the summer.

Radiant  energy  captured  by  algae  is  converted  to  chemical  energy and
passed  through  the  different  trophic  levels of  a  biotic  community. It  is
expended as mechanical and heat energy and ultimately becomes biologi-
cally useless. Upon death, organisms are decomposed to an inorganic form
that algae can use again for nutrients.

Marine ecosystems are composed of populations of organisms called pro-
ducers (which photosynthesize or chemosynthesize), consumers (which eat
producers), and decomposers (which break down detritus). Animals can be
categorized as herbivores (eat plants), carnivores (eat animals), omnivores
(eat both), or bacteriovores (eat bacteria). Through biogeochemical cycles,
the  organisms  of  a  biotic  community  cycle  nutrients and  other  chemicals
from one form to another.

Feeding  strategies include  suspension or  filter  feeding (filtering  plank-
tonic  organisms  from  seawater), deposit  feeding (ingesting  sediment  and
detritus), and  carnivorous  feeding (preying  directly  upon  other  organ-
isms). On average, only about 10% of the mass taken in at one feeding level
is passed on to the next. As a result, the size of individuals increases but the
number of individuals decreases with each trophic level of a food chain or
food  web. Overall, the  total  biomass  of  populations  decreases  the  higher
they are in the biomass pyramid.

Marine  fisheries  harvest  standing  stocks  of  populations  from  various
ecosystems, particularly  shallow  shelf  and  coastal  waters  and  areas  of
upwelling. Overfishing occurs when adult fish are harvested faster than they
can reproduce and results in the decline of fish populations as well as a re-
duction  of  a  fishery s  maximum  sustainable  yield  (MSY). Many  fishing
practices capture unwanted bycatch. Despite the management of fisheries,
many  fish  stocks  worldwide  are  declining. Wise  seafood  choices  can  help
reverse the decline in fish populations.

Critical Thinking Exercises

1. Compare  the  biological  productivity  of  polar, temperate, and  tropical 
regions  of  the  oceans. Consider  seasonal  changes, the  development  of  a
thermocline, the availability of nutrients, and solar radiation.

2. What  is  the  average  efficiency  of  energy  transfer  between  trophic
levels? Use this efficiency to determine how much phytoplankton mass is 

required to add 1 gram of new mass to a killer whale, which is a third-level
carnivore. Include  a  diagram  that  shows  the  different  trophic  levels  and
the  relative  size  and  abundance  of  organisms  at  different  levels. How
would your answer change if the efficiency were half the average rate, or
twice the average rate?

a Pelagic organisms employ a

variety of adaptations to
help them survive in the
marine environment, includ-
ing swim bladders, school-
ing, symbiosis, and, for
most deep-water nekton, 
bioluminescence.

a Marine (and most land)

mammals share the follow-
ing characteristics: they all
have warm blood, breathe
air, have hair, bear live
young, and suckle their
young.

a Marine mammals include

orders Carnivora (sea 
otters, polar bears, and 
pinnipeds walrus, seals,
sea lions, and fur seals),
Sirenia (manatees and
dugongs), and Cetacea
(whales, dolphins, and 
porpoises).

ANIMALS OF THE PELAGIC
ENVIRONMENT

Pelagic  organisms  live  suspended  in  seawater  (not  on  the  ocean  floor)  and  comprise  the  vast
majority of the ocean s biomass.1 Phytoplankton and other photosynthesizing microbes live within
the sunlit surface waters of the ocean and are the food source for nearly all other marine life. As a
result, many marine animals live in surface waters so they can be close to their food supply. One of
the  most important challenges facing  many  marine organisms is to stay afloat and  not sink below
surface waters into the immense depth of the oceans.

Phytoplankton  and  other  photosynthesizing  microbes  depend  primarily  on  their  small  size  to
provide a high degree of frictional resistance to sinking. Most animals, however, are more dense than
ocean water and have less surface area per unit of body mass. Therefore, they tend to sink more rap-
idly than phytoplankton.

To  remain  in  surface  waters  where  the  food  supply  is  greatest, pelagic  marine  animals  must
increase their buoyancy or swim continually. Animals apply one or both of these strategies in a won-
derful variety of adaptations and lifestyles.

14.1 How Are Marine Organisms Able 

to Stay Above the Ocean Floor?

Some animals increase their buoyancy to remain in near-surface waters. They may have containers of
gas, which significantly reduce their average density, or they may have soft bodies void of hard, high-
density parts. Larger animals often have the ability to swim but if their bodies are denser than seawater,
they must exert more energy to propel themselves through the water.

Use of Gas Containers
Air is approximately 1000 times less dense than water at sea level, so even a small amount of air in-
side  an  organism  can  dramatically  increase  its  buoyancy. Generally, animals  use  either  a  rigid  gas
container or  a  swim  bladder to  achieve  neutral  buoyancy, which means  the  amount of  air  in their
bodies regulates their density, so they can remain at a particular depth.

RIGID  GAS  CONTAINERS Some animals, such as the cephalopods (cephalo
 a
foot), have rigid gas containers in their bodies. For instance, the genus Nautilus has an external shell,

FIGURE 14.2 Swim bladder. Some bony fish have a swim
bladder, which is connected to the esophagus by the pneu-
matic duct, allowing air to be added or removed rapidly.
In fish with no pneumatic duct, all gas must be added or 
removed through the blood, which requires more time.

whereas  the  cuttlefish  Sepia 2 and  deep-water  squid  Spirula have  an  internal
chambered structure (Figure 14.1).

Because the pressure in their air chambers is always 1 kilogram per square
centimeter (1 atmosphere, or 14.7 pounds per square inch), the Nautilus must stay
above a depth of approximately 500 meters (1640 feet) to prevent collapse of its
chambered shell. The Nautilus, therefore, rarely ventures below about 250 meters
(800 feet).

SWIM  BLADDERS Alternatively, some slow-moving fish use an internal organ
called  a  swim  bladder (Figure  14.2)  to  achieve  neutral  buoyancy. Very  active
swimmers (such as tuna) or fish that live on the bottom, however, do not usually
have a swim bladder because they don t have a problem maintaining their positions
in the water column.

A change in depth either expands or contracts the swim bladder, so fish must
remove or add gas to maintain a constant volume. In some fish, a pneumatic duct
connects  the  swim  bladder  to  the  esophagus, so  these  fish  can  quickly  add  or
remove gases through the duct. In other fish without the pneumatic duct, the gases
of the swim bladder must be added or removed more slowly by an interchange
with the blood, so they cannot withstand rapid changes in depth.

The composition of gases in the swim bladders of shallow-water fish is similar
to that of the atmosphere. At the surface, the concentration of oxygen in the swim
bladder is about 20% and as depth increases, the oxygen concentration increases
to more than 90%. Fish with swim bladders have been captured from as deep as
7000  meters  (23,000  feet), where  the  pressure  is  700  kilograms  per  square  cen-
timeter (700 atmospheres, or 10,300 pounds per square inch). Pressure this high
compresses the gas to a density of 0.7 gram per cubic centimeter.3 This is approxi-
mately the same density as fat and as a result, many deep-water fish have special
organs for buoyancy that are filled with fat instead of compressed gas.

Ability to Float
Floating  animals  range  in  size  from  microscopic  shrimplike  organisms  to  rela-
tively  large  species, such  as  the  familiar  jellyfish. These  floating  organisms
collectively called zooplankton comprise the second largest biomass in the ocean
after phytoplankton and other photosynthesizing microbes. Microscopic forms of
zooplankton  usually  have  a  hard  shell  called  a  test (testa
  shell). Many  larger
forms  have  soft, gelatinous  bodies  with  little  if  any  hard  tissue, which  reduces
their density and allows them to stay afloat.

Microscopic  zooplankton  are  incredibly  abundant  in  the  ocean. They  are
primary  consumers  because  they  eat  microscopic  phytoplankton, the  primary
producers. Thus, many  zooplankton  are  herbivores. Others  are  omnivores
because they eat other zooplankton in addition to phytoplankton. Most types of
microscopic zooplankton have adaptations to increase the surface area of their
bodies (or shells) so they can remain in the sunlit surface waters near their food
source.4

In  addition, some  organisms  produce  low-density  fats  or  oils  to  stay  afloat.
Many  zooplankton, for  example, produce  tiny  droplets  of  oil  to  help  maintain
neutral or near-neutral buoyancy. Another example is sharks, which have a very
large, oil-rich liver to help reduce their density and float more easily.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Marine organisms use a variety of adaptations to stay
within the sunlit surface waters, such as rigid gas con-
tainers, swim bladders, spines to increase their sur-
face area, soft bodies, or the ability to swim.

2Many species of cephalopods have an inking response. In fact, the ink of Sepia was used as writing
ink (with the brand name Sepia) before alternatives were developed.
3For comparison, note that the density of water is 1.0 gram per cubic centimeter.
4For a more complete discussion of how increased surface area affects an organism s ability to float,
see Chapter 12.

(b) Anthocyrtidium ophirense (magnified 230 times), (c) Larcospira 
quadrangula (magnified 190 times), and (d) Heliodiscus asteriscus
(magnified 200 times).

Ability to Swim
Many larger pelagic animals such as fish and marine mammals can
maintain their position in the water column by swimming and can
also  swim  easily  against  currents. These  organisms  are  called
nekton (nektos
  swimming). Because  of  their  swimming  ability,
some of these organisms undertake long migrations.

The Diversity of Planktonic Animals
Diversity in planktonic marine animals stems from a
shifting  balance  between  competition  for  food  and
avoidance of predators. As a result, a wide variety of
planktonic animals inhabit the oceans.

EXAMPLES  OF  MICROSCOPIC  ZOOPLANKTON
Three  of  the  most  important  groups  of  microscopic
zooplankton are the radiolarians, foraminifers (both of
which are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4, Marine
Sediments ), and copepods.

(a) Euphysetta elegans, x280

(b) Anthocyrtidium ophirense, x230

Radiolarians (radio  a spoke or ray) are single-
celled, microscopic  protozoans  (proto =  first, zoa =
animal) that build their hard shells (tests) out of silica
(Figure  14.3). Their  tests  have  intricate  ornamenta-
tion  including  long  projections. Although  the  spikes
and spines appear to be a defense mechanism against predators, they increase the
test s surface area so the organism won t sink through the water column.

(c) Larcospira quadrangula, x190

Foraminifers (foramen

  an  opening)  are  microscopic  to  (barely)  macro-
scopic  single-celled  protozoans. While  the  most  abundant  types  of  foraminifers
are  planktonic, the  most  diverse  (in  terms  of  number  of  species)  are  benthic.
Foraminifers produce a hard test made of calcium carbonate (Figure 14.4) that is
segmented or chambered with a prominent opening in one end. The tests of both
radiolarians and foraminifers are common components of deep-sea sediment.

(d) Heliodiscus asteriscus, x200

 oar, poda

Copepods (kope

 a foot) are microscopic shrimplike animals of
the  subphylum Crustacea, which  also includes  shrimps, crabs, and  lobsters. Like
other crustaceans, copepods have a hard exoskeleton (exo
 outside) and a seg-
mented body with jointed legs (Figure 14.5). Most copepods have forked tails and
distinct and elaborate antennae.

More than 7500 species of copepods exist, with most possessing special adap-
tations  for  filtering  tiny  floating  food  particles  from  water. Some  copepods  are
herbivores that eat algae, others are carnivores that eat other zooplankton, and
still others are parasitic.

All copepods lay eggs, which are sometimes carried in egg sacs attached to the
abdomen  but  generally  released  into  seawater, where  they  hatch  in  about  a  day.
Their  rapid  reproduction  allows  great  numbers  of  copepods  to  occur  wherever
favorable conditions generally an abundance of food, which is mostly algae exist.
Although  copepods  are  small  (only  a  few  species  are  larger  than  1  mm  or
0.04 inch), they are extremely numerous in the ocean. They are so abundant, in
fact, that  they  are  one  of  the  most  numerically  dominant  types  of  multicelled
organisms on the planet. As such, copepods comprise the majority of the ocean s

EXAMPLES  OF  MACROSCOPIC  ZOOPLANKTON Many  types  of  zooplankton
are  large  enough  to  be  seen  without  the  aid  of  a  microscope. Two  of  the  most
important  groups  of  macroscopic  zooplankton  are  krill  and  various  types  of
cnidarians.

Krill, which means  young fry of fish in Norwegian, are actually in the sub-
phylum  Crustacea  (genus  Euphausia)  and  resemble  minishrimp  or  large  cope-
pods  (Figure  14.6). There  are  more  than  1500  species  of  krill, most  of  which
achieve a length no longer than 5 centimeters (2 inches). They are abundant near
Antarctica and form a critical link in the food web there, supplying food for many
organisms from sea birds to the largest whales in the world.

Cnidarians [cnid

 nematocyst (nemato
 bladder)], which
were formerly known as  coelenterates (coel
 the intestines),
have soft bodies that are more than 95% water and tentacles armed with stinging
cells  called  nematocysts. Macroscopic  zooplankton  that  are  cnidarians  fall  into
one of two basic groups: the hydrozoans and the scyphozoans (jellyfish).

Hydrozoan (hydro

 animal) cnidarians are represented in all
oceans  by  the  Portuguese  man-of-war  (genus  Physalia)  and  the  by-the-wind
sailor (genus Velella). Their gas chambers, called pneumatophores (pneumato
breath, phoros
  bearing), serve as  floats  and  sails that  allow the  wind  to  push
them  across  the  ocean  surface  (Figure  14.7a, left). Sometimes  the  wind  pushes
large  numbers  of these organisms  toward  a beach, where they  can wash ashore
and die. In the living organism, a colony of tiny individuals is suspended beneath
the  float. Portuguese  man-of-war  tentacles  may  be  many  meters  long  and, be-
cause they are armed with nematocysts, they have been known to inflict a painful
and occasionally dangerous neurotoxin poisoning in humans.

  cup, zoa

Jellyfish, or  scyphozoan (skyphos

  animal)  cnidarians, have  a
bell-shaped body with a fringe of tentacles and a mouth at the end of a clapper-
like  extension  hanging  beneath  the  bell-shaped  float  (Figure  14.7). Ranging  in
size from nearly microscopic to 2 meters (6.6 feet) in diameter, most jellyfish are
less than 0.5 meter (1.6 feet) in diameter. The largest jellyfish can have tentacles
as long as 60 meters (200 feet).

Jellyfish move by muscular contraction. Water enters the cavity under the bell
and  is  forced  out  when  muscles  that  circle  the  bell  contract, jetting  the  animals
ahead in short spurts. To allow the animal to swim generally in an upward direc-
tion, light-sensitive or gravity-sensitive organs exist around the outer edge of the
bell. The ability to orient is important because jellyfish feed by swimming to the
surface and sinking slowly through the rich surface waters.

Other types of macroscopic zooplankton include tunicates and salps (barrel-
shaped, often colonial organisms), ctenophores (comb jellies or sea gooseberries),
and chaetognaths (arrowworms).

EXAMPLES  OF  SWIMMING  ORGANISMS Swimming, or  nektonic, organisms
include invertebrate squids, fish, sea turtles, and marine mammals.

Swimming  squid  include  the  common  squid  (genus  Loligo), flying  squid
(Ommastrephes), and giant squid (Architeuthis), all of which are active predators
of fish. Most squid possess long, slender bodies with paired fins (Figure 14.8) and
must  remain  active  to  stay  afloat. However, a  few  species  such  as  Sepia and
Spirula (see Figure 14.1) have a hollow gas-filled chamber in their bodies to help
them remain afloat and so they can be less active.

Squid can swim about as fast as any fish their size and do so by drawing water
into  their  body  cavity  and  then  expelling  the  water  out  through  their  siphon,

propelling themselves backward. To capture prey, squid use two long arms with
pads  containing  suction  cups  at  the  ends  (Figure  14.8). Eight  shorter  arms  with
suckers convey the prey to the mouth, where it is crushed by a mouthpiece that
resembles a parrot s beak.

In fish, locomotion occurs when a wave of lateral body curvature passes from
the front of the fish to the back. This is achieved by the alternate contraction and
relaxation of muscle segments, called myomeres (myo  muscle, merous
 parted),
along the sides of the body. The backward pressure of the fish s body and fins pro-
duced by the movement of this wave provides the forward thrust (Figure 14.9).

FIN DESIGNS IN FISH Most active swimming fish use two sets of paired fins
pelvic  fins and  pectoral (pectoralis
to  turn, brake, and  balance
(Figure 14.9). When not in use, these fins can be folded against the body. Vertical
fins, both dorsal (dorsum  back) and anal, serve primarily as stabilizers.

  breast)  fins

The fin that is most commonly used to propel high-speed fish is the tail fin,
which is called the caudal (cauda
 tail) fin. Caudal fins flare vertically to increase
the surface area available to develop thrust against the water.5 The increased sur-
face  area  also  increases  frictional  drag. The  efficiency  of  the  design  of  a  caudal
fin depends  on  its  shape, which  is  one  of  the  five  basic  forms  illustrated  in
Figure 14.10 and keyed by letter to the following descriptions:

slow speeds.

b) and c) Truncate fins (b) and forked fins (c) are found on faster fish; the fins are

somewhat flexible for better propulsion but are also used for maneuvering.

d) Lunate fins are found on fast-cruising fish such as tuna, marlin, and swordfish;
the  fins are very  rigid and  useless for maneuverability  but very efficient  for
propulsion.

e) Heterocercal (hetero  uneven, cercal

 tail) fins are asymmetrical, with most
of their mass and surface area in the upper lobe. Sharks have a heterocercal

Fish use their fins for swimming and staying afloat

most thrust is the caudal (tail) fin, which can have a
variety of shapes depending on the lifestyle of the fish.

fin, which  produces  significant  lift  and  is  necessary  because  sharks  have  no
swim bladder and tend to sink when they stop moving. In fact, the fundamen-
tal body design of sharks has many adaptations to compensate for the shark s
negative  buoyancy. The  pectoral  (chest)  fins, for  example, are  large  and  flat
and  positioned  so  they  function  like  airplane  wings  to  lift  the  front  of  the
shark s  body, balancing  the  rear  lift  supplied  by  its  heterocercal  caudal  fin.
Although the shark gains tremendous lift from this adaptation of its pectoral fins,
it sacrifices maneuverability. This is why sharks tend to swim in broad circles
like a circling airplane and do not make sharp turns while swimming.

14.2 What Adaptations Do Pelagic

Organisms Possess for 
Seeking Prey?

Pelagic organisms possess several adaptations that are designed to enhance their
ability to seek and capture food. These adaptations include mobility (lunging ver-
sus cruising), swimming speed, body temperature, and specially designed circula-
tory  systems. In  addition, deep-water  nekton  have  some  unique  adaptations  to
help them succeed in capturing prey in their world of darkness.

Mobility: Lungers versus Cruisers
Some fish wait patiently for prey and exert themselves only in short bursts as they
lunge  at  the  prey. Others  cruise  relentlessly  through  the  water, seeking  prey. A
marked difference occurs in the musculature of fish that use these different styles
of obtaining food.

For  example, lungers (such  as  the  grouper  shown  in  Figure  14.11a)  sit  and
wait for prey to come close by. Lungers have truncate caudal fins for speed and
maneuverability, and almost all their muscle tissue is white.

SOME MYTHS (AND FACTS) ABOUT SHARKS

Sharks (Figure 14A) are the fish humans
most fear. Their strength, large size, sharp
teeth, and  unpredictable  nature  are
enough  to  keep  some  people  from  ever
entering  the  ocean. The  publicity  gener-
ated by the occasional shark attack on hu-
mans has led to many myths about sharks,
including the following:

Myth  #1: All  sharks  are  dangerous. Of
the  world s  370  shark  species, 80%  are
unable  to  hurt  people  or  rarely  en-
counter people. The largest shark is the
whale  shark  (Rhincodon  typus), which
reaches  lengths  of  up  to  15  meters  (50
feet)  but  eats  only  plankton  and  so  is
not considered dangerous.

Myth  #2: Sharks  are  voracious  eaters
that  must  eat  continuously. Like  other
large  animals, sharks  eat  periodically
depending  upon  their  metabolism  and
the availability of food. Humans are not
a primary food source of any shark, and
many large sharks prefer the higher fat
content of seals and sea lions.

Myth  #3: Most  people  attacked  by  a
shark are killed. Of every 100 people at-
tacked by sharks, 85 survive. Many large
sharks commonly attack by biting their
prey  to  immobilize  it  before  trying  to
eat  it. Consequently, many  potential
prey escape and survive. The most com-
mon targets of shark attacks are surfers
(49%), swimmers/ waders (29%), divers/
snorkelers  (15%), and  kayakers  (6%).
Most shark encounters with humans are
investigative, not predatory.

Myth  #4: Many  people  are  killed  by
sharks each year. The chances of a per-
son  being  killed  by  a  shark  are  quite
low (Table 14A). Sharks kill an average
of  only  5  to  15  people  worldwide  each
year. Humans, on the other hand, kill as
many  as  100  million  sharks  a  year
(mostly  as  bycatch  from  fishing  activi-
ties). Compared  to  many  other  fish,
sharks have low reproduction rates and

FIGURE 14A Great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).

grow  slowly, which  may  result  in  many
sharks being designated as endangered
species in the future.

Myth  #5: The  great  white  shark  is  a
common, abundant  species  found  off
most  beaches. Great  white  sharks  are
relatively  uncommon  predators  that
prefer  cooler  waters. At  most  beaches,
great whites are rarely encountered.

Myth #6: Sharks are not found in fresh-
water. A  specialized  osmoregulatory

system  enables  some  species  (such  as
the  bull  shark)  to  cope  with  dramatic
changes in salinity, from the high salinity
of seawater to the low salinity of fresh-
water rivers and lakes.

Myth #7: All sharks need to swim con-
stantly. Some sharks can remain at rest
for long periods on the bottom and ob-
tain  enough  oxygen  by  opening  and
closing  their  mouths  to  pump  oxygen
through  their  gills. Typically, sharks

less  than  9  kilometers  (6  miles)  per

Myth  #8: Sharks  have  poor  vision. The
lens of a shark s eye is up to seven times
more  powerful  than  that  of  a  human s.
Sharks can even distinguish color.

Myth #9: Eating shark meat makes one
aggressive. There  is  no  indication  that
eating  shark  meat  will  alter  a  person s

temperament. The  firm  texture, white
flesh, low fat content, and mild taste of
shark  meat  have  made  it  a  favorite
seafood in many countries.

Myth  #10: No  one  would  ever  want  to
enter  water  filled  with  sharks. Long
regarded with fear and suspicion, sharks
have  more  recently  been  viewed  as
skilled predators that are vitally impor-
tant to the health of ocean ecosystems.
Diving

encounters  with  sharks  are  becoming
increasingly popular.

Today I could not, for instance, portray
the shark as a villain, especially not as 
a mindless omnivore that attacks boats
and humans with reckless abandon. No,
the shark in an updated Jaws could not
be the villain; it would have to be written
as the victim, for, world-wide, sharks
are much more the oppressed than the
oppressors.

author of Jaws

On the other hand, cruisers (such as the tuna shown in Figure 14.11b) actively

seek prey. Less than half of a cruiser s muscle tissue is white; most is red.

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

What is the significance of red versus white muscle tissue? Red muscle tissue
contains fibers that are 25 to 50 microns in diameter (0.01 to 0.02 inch), whereas
the  fibers  in  white  muscle  tissue  are  135  microns  (0.05  inch)  and  contain  much
lower concentrations of myoglobin (myo
 sphere), a red pig-
ment  with  an  affinity  for  oxygen. Moreover, red  muscle  tissue  supplies  a  much
greater amount of oxygen and supports a much higher metabolic rate than white
tissue. This is why cruisers have so much red muscle tissue: it allows them to have
the endurance needed to support their active lifestyle.

 muscle, globus

Lungers, on  the  other  hand, need  very  little  red  tissue  because  they  do  not
move continually. Instead, they need white tissue, which fatigues much more rap-
idly than red tissue, for quick bursts of speed to capture prey. Cruisers use white
tissue, too, for short periods of acceleration while on the attack.

Swimming Speed
Although rapid swimming consumes much energy, it can help organisms capture
prey. Fish  normally  swim  slowly  when  cruising, fast  when  hunting  for  prey, and
fastest of all when trying to escape from predators.

Generally, when comparing fish of similar shapes, the larger the fish, the faster
it  can  swim. For  tuna, well  adapted  for  sustained  cruising  and  short, high-speed

Do sharks ever get cancer?

Legend has it that sharks don t get cancer, making the

market as a cure for the disease. However, researchers
who  study  tumors  in  animals  have  recently  reported
that  sharks  and  their  close  relatives skates  and
rays can and do get cancer.

bursts, cruising  speed  averages  about  three  body  lengths  per  second. They  can,
however, maintain  a  maximum  speed  of  about  10  body  lengths  per  second, but
only for about one second. Remarkably, yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) have
been  clocked  at  74.6  kilometers  (46  miles)  per  hour!  Even  though  this  speed  is
more  than  20  body  lengths  per  second, the  tuna  could  maintain  it  for  only  a
fraction of  a  second. Theoretically, a  4-meter  (13-foot)  bluefin  tuna  (Thunnus
thynnus) can reach speeds up to about 144 kilometers (90 miles) per hour.6

Like  fish, many  of  the  toothed  whales  are  fast  swimmers, too.
For instance, spotted dolphins of the genus Stenella have been clocked
at  40  kilometers  (25 miles)  per  hour, and  killer  whales  may  exceed
55 kilometers (34 miles) per hour during short bursts.

Cold-Blooded versus Warm-Blooded Organisms

Fish are mostly cold-blooded, or poikilothermic (poikilos
heat), so  their  body  temperatures  are  nearly  the  same  as  their  environment.
Usually, these  fish  are  not  fast  swimmers. The  mackerel  (Scomber), yellowtail
(Seriola), and bonito (Sarda), on the other hand, are indeed fast swimmers. They
also  have  body  temperatures  that  are  1.3, 1.4, and 
),
respectively, higher than the surrounding seawater.

Mackerel  sharks  (genera  Lamna and  Isurus)  and  Tuna  (genera  Thunnus)
have  body  temperatures  much  higher  than  their  environment. Bluefin  tuna  can
maintain a body temperature of 30 to 
) regardless of the water
temperature, which  is  characteristic  of  organisms  that  are  warm-blooded, or
homeothermic (homeo

commonly  found  in  warmer  water, where  the  temperature  difference  between
fish and water is no more than

Why do these fish exert so much energy to maintain their body temperatures at
high levels, when other fish do quite well with ambient body temperatures? It may
be  that  for  cruisers, any  adaptation  (high  temperature  and  high
metabolic rate) that increases the power output of their muscle tis-
sue helps them seek and capture prey.

Adaptations of Deep-Water Nekton
Living below the surface water but still above the ocean floor are
deep-water  nektonic  species mostly  various  species  of  fish that  are  specially
adapted  to  the  deep-water  environment, where  it  is  very  still  and  completely
dark. Their  food  source  is  either  detritus (detritus
to  lessen) dead  and
decaying  organic  matter  including  waste  products  that  slowly  sink  downward
from surface waters or each other. The lack of abundant food limits the number
of  organisms  (total  biomass)  and  the  size of  these  organisms. As  a  result, small
populations  of these  organisms  exist  and  most  individuals  are  less  than  30  cen-
timeters (1 foot) long. Many have low metabolic rates to conserve energy, too.

These deep-sea fish (Figure 14.12) have special adaptations to efficiently find
and  collect  food. They  have  good  sensory  devices, for  example, such  as  long
antennae or sensitive lateral lines that can detect movement of other organisms
within the water column.

Well over half of deep-sea fish and even some deep-water species of shrimp
and squid can bioluminesce (bios
 becoming), which
means  they  can  produce  light  biologically  and  glow  in  the  dark. Fireflies  and
glowworms are well-known animals on land that have bioluminescent capability.
Approximately  80%  of  bioluminescent  organisms  have  light-producing  cells
called photophores (photo

containing luminescent bacteria surrounded by dark pigments. Some photophores
even contain lenses to amplify the emission of light.

Bioluminescence  is  produced  when  molecules  of  luciferin (lucifer

  light
bringing) are excited and emit photons of light in the presence of oxygen. Only a
1% loss of energy is required to produce this illumination.

In a world of darkness, the ability to bioluminesce is useful for a variety of

purposes, including:

Searching for food items in the dark.
Attracting prey (for example, the deep-sea anglerfish in Figure 14.12f uses its
specially modified dorsal fin as a bioluminescent lure).
Staking out territory by constantly patrolling an area.
Communicating or seeking a mate by sending signals.
Escaping from predators by using a flash of light to temporarily blind or dis-
tract them.
Avoiding predators by use of a  burglar alarm by attracting unwanted atten-
tion with brilliant displays of bioluminescence.
Camouflaging by using belly lights to match the color and intensity of dim fil-
tered  sunlight  from  above  and  obliterate  a  telltale  shadow. This  is  known  as
counterillumination.

To take advantage of bioluminescent light, many deep-sea fish species have
large and sensitive eyes perhaps 100 times more sensitive to light than human
eyes
that enable them to see potential prey. To avoid being prey, most species
are dark in color so that they blend into the environment. Still other species are
blind and rely on senses such as smell to track down prey.

Other  adaptations  that  various  deep-sea  fish  species  possess  include  large
sharp teeth, expandable bodies to accommodate large food items, hinged jaws
that can unlock to open widely, and mouths that are huge in proportion to their
bodies  (Figure  14.13). These  adaptations  allow  deep-sea  fish  to  ingest  species

Those deep-sea fish look frightening. Do they ever
come to the surface? Are they related to piranhas?

They never come to the surface, and that is fortunate
for us because  they  are vicious  predators.  They  are
only distantly related to piranhas (they are within the
same group of bony fish), but their similarly-adapted,
large,  sharp  teeth  may  be  a  good  example  of
convergent evolution: the evolution of similar charac-
teristics  on  different  organisms  independent  of  one
another  yet  adapted  to  the  same  problem  (in  this
case, a low food supply).

14.3 What Adaptations Do Pelagic
Organisms Possess to Avoid 
Being Prey?

Many  animals  have  unique  adaptations  to  avoid  being  captured  and  eaten.
Examples  of  adaptations  that  organisms  use  to  enhance  their  survival  include
schooling and symbiosis.

Schooling
The term school refers to large numbers of fish, squid, or shrimp that form well-
defined  social  groupings. Although  vast  populations  of  phytoplankton  and  zoo-
plankton may be highly concentrated in certain areas of the ocean, they are not
usually referred to as schools.

The number of individuals in a school can vary from a few larger predaceous
fish (such as bluefin tuna) to hundreds of thousands of small filter feeders (such as
anchovies). Within  the  school, individuals  move  in  the  same  direction  and  are
evenly  spaced. Spacing  is  probably maintained  through  visual contact  and, in the
case of fish, by use of the lateral line system (see Figure 14.9) that detects vibrations
of swimming neighbors. The school can turn abruptly or reverse direction as indi-
viduals at the head or rear of the school assume leadership positions (Figure 14.14).
What are the advantages of schooling? One advantage is that during spawn-
ing, schooling ensures that there will be males to release sperm to fertilize the eggs
released into the water or deposited on the bottom by females. Another advantage
is that schools of smaller fish can invade the territory of larger aggressive species
and  feed  there  because  the  owner of  the  territory  can  never  chase  away  the
whole school. The most important function of schooling
in small fish, however, is protection from predators.

It  may  seem  illogical  that  schooling  would  be  pro-
tective. For instance, schooling creates tighter groupings
of organisms so that any predator lunging into a school
would surely catch something, just as land predators run
a herd of grazing animals until one weakens and becomes
a meal. So, aren t the smaller fish making it easier for the
predators by forming a large target?

Scientists  who  study  fish  behavior  suggest  that
schooling does indeed serve to protect a group of organ-
isms  based  on  strategies  that  give  them  safety  in  num-
bers much  like  flocking  in  birds. In  many  parts  of  the
marine environment such as the open ocean where there
is no place to hide, schooling has the following advantages:

1. When members of a species form schools, they reduce
the  percentage  of  ocean  volume  in  which  a  cruising
predator might find one of their kind.

2. When a predator encounters a large school, it is less
likely to consume the entire unit than if it encounters
a small school or an individual.

3. The school may appear as a single large and danger-
ous  opponent  to  the  potential  predator  and  prevent
some attacks.

FIGURE 14.14 Schooling. A school of soldier fish near a reef in the Maldives, Indian
Ocean. Schooling increases chances of survival, and more than half of all fish species are
known to join schools during at least a portion of their lives.

14.3 What Adaptations Do Pelagic Organisms Possess to Avoid Being Prey?

417

4. Predators may find the continually changing position and direction of move-
ment of fish within the school confusing, making attack particularly difficult
for predators, which can attack only one fish at a time.

In addition, the fact that more than half of all fish species join schools during at
least a portion of their lives suggests that schooling enhances survival of species,
especially for those with no other means of defense. Schooling may also help fish
swim greater distances than individuals because each schooling fish gets a boost
from the vortex created by the fish swimming in front of it.

Recently, a new ocean predator has developed a method to take advantage
of the  schooling  behavior  of  fish. Human  fishers  have  developed  nets  large
enough  to  encircle whole  schools  of fish, which is very efficient  at  catching fish
but has led to the decline of many fish stocks (see Chapter 13).

Symbiosis
Many  marine  organisms  enter  into  relationships  with  other  organisms  to  help
them  survive. One  such  relationship  is  symbiosis (sym   together, bios
  life),
which occurs when two or more organisms associate in a way that benefits at least
one of them. There are three main types of symbiotic relationships: commensal-
ism, mutualism, and parasitism.

In commensalism (commensal

 sharing a meal, ism  a process), a smaller
or less dominant participant benefits without harming its host, which affords sub-
sistence  or  protection  to  the  other. A  remora, for  example, attaches  itself  to  a
shark or another fish to obtain food and transportation, generally without harming
its host (Figure 14.15a).

host, such as these remoras attached to a lemon shark.

as this cinnamon clown fish and sea anemone. (c) Parasitism

other, such as this isopod that has attached itself to the head
of a whitetip soldierfish.

The  world s 
the  whale  shark
(Rhincodon typus),  which  reaches  lengths  of  up  to
15 meters (50 feet) and can weigh up to 13.6 metric
tons  (15  short  tons).  Its  mouth  is  an  enormous 
1.5  meters  (5  feet)  wide.  It  is  a  slow-moving,  wide-
ranging,  filter-feeding  animal  that  exists  almost 
entirely on plankton. Alternatively, the smallest known
fish  is  Paedocypris progenetica,  a  relative  of  carp
and minnows. Its adult length is only 7.9 millimeters
(0.31  inch),  which  is  about  as  thick  as  a  pencil.  It
lives  exclusively  in  Indonesian  swamps  and,  remark-
ably, was only discovered in 2005. There is, however,
one  other  fish  that  is  smaller:  the  male  deep-sea 
anglerfish  Photocorynus  spiniceps,  which  has  an
adult length of only 6.2 millimeters (0.24 inch). It is
generally  not  considered  the  world s  smallest  fish 
because it is not a self-sustaining organism. Instead,
the parasitic males bite into larger females and fuse
for life (see Figure 14.12g).

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Many pelagic species (especially fish) school, engage
in symbiosis, or have other adaptations to increase
their chances of survival by avoiding predators.

In mutualism (mutuus

 borrowed, ism  a process), both participants bene-
fit. For example, the stinging tentacles of the sea anemone protect the clown fish
(Figure 14.15b), and the clown fish, which is small but aggressive, chases away any
fish that tries to feed on the anemone itself. In addition, the clown fish helps clean
the anemone and may even supply scraps of food. Remarkably, clown fish are not
stung by the anemone because clown fish have a protective agent in the mucus
that coats their bodies.

In parasitism (parasitos

 a person who eats at someone else s table, ism  a
process), one participant (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other (the
host). Many  fish  are  hosts  to  isopods, which  attach  to  the  fish  and  derive  their
nutrition from the body fluids of the fish, thereby robbing the host of some of its
energy supply (Figure 14.15c). Usually, the parasite does not rob enough energy
to kill the host because if the host dies, so does the parasite.

Recently, symbiosis had been discovered to be an important component that
drives  evolution. For  example, the  sequencing  of  the  genome  of  a  species  of
diatom  reveals  that  it  apparently  acquired  new  genes  by  engulfing  microbial
neighbors. The  research  suggests  that  early  on  in  the  evolution  of  diatoms, the
most significant acquisition was an algal cell that provided the diatom with photo-
synthetic machinery.

Other Adaptations
Marine animals exhibit a variety of behaviors that serve as defensive mechanisms
to help them ward off predators or to be more successful predators themselves.
These include using speed, secreting poisons, and mimicry of other poisonous or
distasteful  species. Others  use  transparency, camouflage, or  countershading, as
discussed in Chapter 12.

14.4 What Characteristics Do Marine

Mammals Possess?

Marine mammals include some of the largest, best known, and most charismatic
animals  in  the  sea, such  as  seals, sea  lions, manatees, porpoises, dolphins,
and whales.

Although  all  marine  mammals  have  an  aquatic  existence, their  ancestors
were land animals. For example, a series of striking fossil discoveries of ancient
whales in Pakistan, India, and Egypt provide strong evidence that whales evolved
from  mammals  on  land  about  50  million  years  ago. Some  whale  ancestors  had
small, unusable  hind legs, suggesting  that the land  mammal predecessor had no
need for its hind legs when it developed a large paddle-shaped structure for a tail
used  to  swim  through  water. Other  fossils  show  a  remarkable  progression  of
skeletal adaptations for an increasingly aquatic existence, such as the migration of
the blowhole (nostrils) toward the top of the head, upper vertebrae that become
increasingly fused, shrinking hip and ankle structures, and jawbone and ear com-
ponents designed for underwater hearing. Additional lines of evidence including
DNA  analysis  of  modern  whales  and  a  host  of  anatomical  similarities  between
land and marine mammals
confirm the evolution of whales from a hippopotamus-
like land-dwelling ancestor.

The geologic record shows that life on land evolved from marine organisms
millions of years ago. Why would a land mammal migrate back to the sea? One
hypothesis suggests that they may have returned to the sea because of more abun-
dant  food  sources. Another  is  that  the  extinction  of  many  large  marine  predators
that occurred at the same time as the demise of the dinosaurs allowed mammals to
expand into a new environment: the sea.

Organizational chart showing the taxonomic relationships of
the various groups of marine mammals, including representa-
tive examples.

Mammalian Characteristics
All organisms in class Mammalia (including marine mammals) share the follow-
ing characteristics:

They are warm-blooded.
They breathe air.
They have hair (or fur) during at least some stage of their development.
They bear live young.7
The females of each species have mammary glands that produce milk for their
young.

Marine  mammals  include  at  least  117  species  within  the  orders  Carnivora,
Sirenia, and  Cetacea. The  major  groups  of  marine  mammals  are  shown  in
Figure 14.16 and described below.

Order Carnivora
All  animals  within  order  Carnivora (carni
such  as  the
familiar cat and dog families on land have prominent canine teeth. Marine rep-
resentatives of order Carnivora include sea otters, polar bears, and the pinnipeds

Sea  otters (Figure  14.17a) inhabit kelp  beds  in  coastal  waters  of the  eastern
North Pacific Ocean. They are some of the smallest marine mammals, with adults
reaching  lengths  up  to  1.2  meters  (4  feet). Sea  otters  lack  an  insulating  layer  of
blubber but have extremely dense fur, which is extremely luxurious and was highly
sought for pelts; as a result, they were hunted to the brink of extinction in the late
1800s. Fortunately, they have made a remarkable comeback and now inhabit most
areas  where  they  were  formerly  hunted. Sea  otters  seem  particularly  playful
because of their habit of continually scratching themselves, which serves to clean
their fur and adds an insulating layer of air. Because they lack the insulative bene-
fit of blubber, they have high caloric requirements and are voracious eaters.

7This is true except for a few egg-laying monotreme mammals of Australia from the subclass
Prototheria, which includes the duck-billed platypus and the spiny anteater (echidna).

(c)

Sea  otters  eat  more  than  50  kinds  of
marine life, including sea urchins, crabs, lob-
sters, sea stars, abalone, clams, mussels, octo-
puses, and fish. They are one of the few types
of animals known to use tools. During dives
for  prey  items, they  keep  a  tool usually  a
rock tucked  under  one  arm  while  they
use their  dexterous  hands  to  obtain  food.
When  they  return  to  the  surface, they  use
the  tool  to  break  open  the  shells  of  their
food while floating on their backs.

Polar bears (Figure 14.17b) are a type of
marine mammal with massive webbed paws
that make them excellent swimmers. The polar bear s fur is thick, and each hair is
hollow  for  better  insulation. Polar  bears  also  have  large  teeth  and  sharp  claws,
which  they  use  for  prying  and  killing. Their  diet  consists  mainly  of  seals, which
they often capture at holes in the Arctic ice when the seals come up for a breath
of air. The topic of shrinking Arctic sea ice and its affect on polar bear popula-
tions is discussed in Chapter 16, The Oceans and Climate Change.

Walruses have  large  bodies  and  adults both  male  and  female have  ivory
tusks up to 1 meter (3 feet) long (Figure 14.17c). Their tusks are used for territo-
rial  fighting, for  hauling  themselves  onto  icebergs, and  sometimes  for  stabbing
their prey.
Seals
fur seals

also called the earless seals or true seals differ from the sea lions and
also called the eared seals

in the following ways:

Seals lack prominent ear flaps that are specific to sea lions and fur seals (look
closely and compare Figures 14.17d and 14.17e).
Seals have smaller and less-prominent front flippers (called fore flippers) than
sea lions and fur seals.
Seals have prominent claws that extend from their fore flippers that sea lions
and fur seals lack (Figure 14.18).
Seals have a different hip structure than sea lions and fur seals. Thus, seals can-
not move their rear flippers underneath their bodies as sea lions and fur seals
can (Figure 14.18).
Seals, with their smaller front flippers and different hip structure, do not move
around on land very well and can only slither along like caterpillars. Sea lions
and  fur  seals, on  the  other  hand, use  their  large  front  flippers  and  their  rear
flippers, which they can turn under their bodies, to walk easily on land and can
even ascend steep slopes, climb stairs, and do other acrobatic tricks.

14.4 What Characteristics Do Marine Mammals Possess?

421

Seals  propel  themselves  through  the  water  using  a  back-and-forth  motion  of
their  rear  flippers  (similar  to  a  wagging  tail), whereas  sea  lions  and  fur  seals
flap their large front flippers.

Order Sirenia

Animals of order Sirenia (siren *

with  an  enticing  voice)  include
the  manatees and  dugongs, col-
lectively  known  as 
Manatees  are 
coastal  areas  of  the  tropical  Atlantic

Both manatees and dugongs have a pad-

their  bodies, which  are  concentrated  around  the
mouth. They are large animals that can reach lengths
of  up  to  4.3  meters  (14  feet)  and  weigh  more  than
1360 kilograms  (3000  pounds). The  land-dwelling
ancestors  of  sirenians  were  elephant  like; in  fact,
modern-day  manatees  have  nails  on  their  front
flippers that resemble those of elephants.

Sirenians  eat  only  shallow-water  coastal  grasses

Fore flippers

and are thus the only vegetarian marine mammals. They
spend  most  of  their  lives  in  coastal  waters  that  are  heavily
used  by  humans  for  commerce, recreation, development, and
waste disposal, and so a major concern for sirenian survival is habitat destruction. A
recent worldwide study of biologically sensitive seagrass habitat which is vital for
sirenians
indicates that it is being destroyed so rapidly that it is one of the most
threatened ecosystems on Earth. The rate of seagrass loss, in fact, is similar to that
of other endangered ecosystems, such as mangroves, coral reefs, and rainforests.

ies, which allows them good mobility on land; and sea lions
have an external ear flap (not shown).

NORTHERN RIGHT WHALE (Eubalaena glacialis)
Northern right whale baleen can reach 2.8 m (9 ft) in length and
is used to strain copepods and krill from surface waters. A similar
species, the southern right whale, exists in high southern latitudes.
Length is to 18 m (60 ft).

SPERM WHALE (Physeter macrocephalus)
Found mostly in tropical waters, these deep-diving toothed whales
have a huge snout that contains a large amount of oil. Length of male
is to 18 m (59 ft); length of female is to 10.5 m (35 ft). 

FIGURE 14.20 Marine mammals of order Cetacea.
A composite drawing of representatives of the two whale
suborders, drawn to relative scale. The toothed whales
(Odontoceti) form complex social communities and include
the bottlenose dolphin, killer whale, narwhal, and sperm
whale. The baleen whales (Mysticeti) are the largest of 
all whales and include the right whale, gray whale, humpback
whale, and blue whale.

In addition, there have been many accidents with motorboats that run over
these  slow-moving  animals. In  2002, for  example, the  Florida  Fish  and Wildlife
Commission  reported  the  deaths  of  305  Florida  manatees, of  which  31%  were
attributed to boat collisions. Scientists have recently developed a forward-looking
sonar system called a  manatee finder to help boaters locate and avoid the ani-
mals. The continuing decline in populations of manatees and dugongs, however,
has led to them being classified as endangered species.

BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN (Tursiops truncatus)
Found in all oceans, this is one of the many species of
oceanic dolphins. Length is to 3 m (10 ft).

KILLER WHALE (Orcinus orca)
Cosmopolitan in distribution, this whale is unique in that it not only
feeds on fish but also on seals, birds, and other whales. The male
has a larger dorsal fin than the female. Length is to 9 m (31 ft).

GRAY WHALE (Eschrichtius robustus)
This bottom-feeding baleen whale has a small head and very
reduced dorsal fin. It stays close to shore, and even enters
the surf zone. Length is to 14 m (45 ft).

NARWHAL (Monodon monoceros)
The scientific name, which means "one tooth, one horn" is accurate for
the male of this Arctic whale. Length is to 6 m (20 ft).

HUMPBACK WHALE (Megaptera novaeangliae)
These baleen whales produce some of the most complex
songs of any marine mammal and are known for their energetic
and athletic behaviors, such as breaching. The genus name is
derived from their extraordinary large wing-like flippers.
Length is to 16 m (52 ft).

BLUE WHALE (Balaenoptera musculus)
Probably the largest animal to ever inhabit the Earth, these baleen whales weigh up to
150 tons and can consume over 5 tons of krill per day. Length is to 30 m (100 ft).

FIGURE 14.20 (CONTINUED)

Order Cetacea

The order Cetacea (cetus
 a whale) includes the whales, dolphins, and porpoises
(Figure 14.20). The cetacean body is more or less cigar shaped and insulated with
a thick layer of blubber. Cetacean forelimbs are modified into flippers that move
only  at  the  shoulder
joint. The  hind  limbs  are  vestigial  (rudimentary), not

424

Chapter 14

Animals of the Pelagic Environment

attached  to  the  rest  of  the  skeleton, and  are  usually  not  visible  externally. All
cetaceans share the following characteristics:

An elongated (telescoped) skull
Blowholes on top of the skull
Very few hairs
A  horizontal  tail  fin  called  a  fluke that  is  used  for  propulsion  by  vertical
movements

These characteristics make cetaceans  bodies very streamlined, allowing them to
be excellent swimmers.

MODIFICATIONS  TO  INCREASE  SWIMMING  SPEED Cetaceans   muscles  are
not a great deal more powerful than those of other mammals, so their ability to
swim fast must result from modifications that reduce frictional drag. The muscles
of a small dolphin, for example, would need to be five times stronger than they
are to swim at 40 kilometers (25 miles) per hour in turbulent flow.

In addition to a streamlined body, cetaceans improve the flow of water around
their bodies with a specialized skin structure. Their skin consists of a soft outer layer
that is 80% water and has narrow canals filled with spongy material, and a stiffer
inner  layer  composed mostly of  tough connective tissue. The soft layer  decreases
the pressure differences at the skin water interface by compressing when pressure
is high and expanding when pressure is low, reducing turbulence and drag.

MODIFICATIONS TO ALLOW DEEP DIVING Humans can free-dive to a maximum
depth  of  130  meters  (428  feet)  and  hold  their  breath  in  rare  instances  for  up  to
six minutes. In contrast, sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) dive deeper than
2800 meters (9200 feet), and northern bottlenose whales (Hyperoodon ampullatus)
can  stay  submerged  for  up  to  two  hours. These  remarkable  feats  require  unique
adaptations, such  as  special  structures  that  allow  them  to  use  oxygen  efficiently,
muscular adaptations, and an ability to resist nitrogen narcosis.

Oxygen  Usage Figure  14.21 shows  the  internal  structures  that  allow  cetaceans  to
remain submerged for extended periods. Inhaled air finds its way to tiny terminal
chambers, the alveoli (alveus
 a small hollow). Alveoli are lined with a thin alveolar
membrane that is in contact with a dense bed of capillaries. The exchange of gases
between the inhaled air and the blood (oxygen in, carbon dioxide out) occurs across
the alveolar membrane. Some cetaceans have an exceptionally large concentration
of capillaries surrounding the alveoli (Figure 14.21b), which have muscles that move
air against the membrane by repeatedly contracting and expanding.

Cetaceans take from one to three breaths per minute while resting, compared
with about 15 in humans. Because they hold the inhaled breath much longer, and
because of the large capillary mass in contact with the alveolar membrane and the
circulation of the air by muscular action, cetaceans can extract almost 90% of the
oxygen in each breath, whereas terrestrial mammals extract only 4 to 20%.

To use oxygen efficiently during long dives, cetaceans store it and limit its use.
The storage of so much oxygen is possible because prolonged divers have such a
large blood volume per unit of body mass.

Some cetaceans have twice as many red blood cells per unit of blood volume
and up to nine times as much myoglobin in their muscle tissue as terrestrial animals.
As a result, large supplies of oxygen can be stored chemically in hemoglobin (hemo
blood, globus
 sphere) within red blood cells and in myoglobin within muscles.

Muscular Adaptations Cetaceans  muscles are also adapted for deep dives. One
adaptation  is  that  their  muscle  tissue  is  relatively  insensitive  to  high  levels  of
carbon dioxide, which builds up in the body through respiration, especially during
deep  dives. Another  adaptation  is  that  their  muscles  can  continue  to  function
through anaerobic respiration when oxygen becomes depleted.

14.4 What Characteristics Do Marine Mammals Possess?

425

In  addition, research  has  shown  that  cetaceans   swimming  muscles  can  still
function during a dive even in the absence of oxygen. This suggests that these mus-
cles  and  other  organs, such  as  the  digestive  tract  and  kidneys, may  be  sealed  off
from the circulatory system by constriction of key arteries. The circulatory system
would then service only essential components, such as the heart and brain. Because
of the decreased circulatory requirements, the heart rate can be reduced by 20 to
50% of normal. Other research has shown, however, that no such reduction in heart
rate  occurs  during  dives  by  the  common  dolphin  (Delphinus  delphis), the  white
whale (Delphinapterus leucas), or the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).

Do Cetaceans Suffer from the Effects of Deep Diving? One difficulty with deep
and prolonged dives is the absorption of compressed gases into the blood. When
humans  dive  using  compressed  air which  includes  nitrogen  and  oxygen the
higher pressure at depth causes more nitrogen to be dissolved in a diver s body
and can cause divers to experience nitrogen narcosis, which is also called rapture
of  the  deep. The  effect  of  nitrogen  narcosis  is  similar  to  drunkenness  and  can
occur when a diver either goes too deep or stays too long at depths greater than
30 meters (100 feet) (see Box 12.2).

Another difficulty can occur when divers return to the surface too rapidly, in
which case they may experience decompression sickness, which is also called the
bends. During  a  rapid  ascent, the  lungs  cannot  remove  excess  gases  from  the
bloodstream fast enough and the reduced pressure causes small bubbles of nitro-
gen to form in a diver s blood and tissue. This process is analogous to the bubbles
that form  in  a carbonated beverage  when  the  container is opened. The bubbles
interfere  with  blood  circulation  and  can  cause  bone  damage, excruciating  pain,
severe physical debilitation, or even death.

Until recently, it was believed that cetaceans and other marine mammals had
adaptations that prevented them from suffering from the effects of deep diving.
However, research  involving  a  rigorous  examination  of  sperm  whale  skeletons
reveals that sperm whales acquire progressive bone damage caused by recurring
decompression sickness. The researchers conclude that sperm whales are neither
anatomically nor physiologically immune to the effects of deep diving.

Still, the  debilitating  effects  of  deep  diving  are  minimized  in  cetaceans
because  they  have  collapsible  rib  cages. By  the  time  a  cetacean  has  reached  a
depth of 70 meters (230 feet), its rib cage has collapsed under the 8 kilograms per
square  centimeter  (8  atmospheres, or  118  pounds  per  square  inch)  of  pressure.
The lungs within the rib cage also collapse, removing all air from the alveoli. This,
in  turn, prevents  the  blood  from  absorbing  additional  gases  across  the  alveolar
membrane, minimizing nitrogen narcosis.

In addition, cetaceans may be naturally resilient to the buildup of nitrogen gas in
their bodies. In a study where enough nitrogen was put into the tissue of a dolphin to
give a human a severe case of the bends, for instance, the dolphin appeared to suffer
no  ill  effects. This  suggests  that  dolphins  (as  well  as  other  marine  mammals)  may
have simply evolved an insensitivity to the buildup of excess nitrogen gas.

SUBORDER  ODONTOCETI Members of order Cetacea can be divided into two
suborders: Odontoceti  (the  toothed  whales)  and  Mysticeti  (the  baleen  whales).
Suborder Odontoceti (odonto

Ive heard of the problem with military sonar causing
whale strandings. How does sonar harm cetaceans?

Recently,  there  has  been  some  evidence  linking
mass strandings of cetaceans predominately beaked
whales with  the  deployment  of  mid-frequency  sonar
used  for  detecting  submarines  during  military  exer-
cises. Although the link is circumstantial, researchers
have  documented  gas-bubble  lesions  in  stranded
cetaceans consistent with rapid decompression that is
normally associated with decompression sickness. It is
suspected that the sonar may be responsible for the
formation of these  bubbles  by  causing  the cetaceans
to  ascend  to  the  surface  too  rapidly  or  simply  by
the physical  effects  of  the  sonar  itself  on  cetaceans
nitrogen-saturated tissues. Other strandings, however,
have occurred during times when military sonar is not
in use but stranded animals are still found to have sim-
ilar bubbles in their tissues. Clearly, more research is
needed  to  determine  how  sonar  affects  the  hearing,
behavior,  and  physiology  of  marine  mammals.
Otherwise, the relationship between military sonar and
strandings may just be an unfortunate coincidence.

opening  (blowhole), while  baleen  whales  have  two. Although  both  toothed  and
baleen whales can emit and receive sounds, the ability to use sound is best developed
in toothed whales (particularly sperm whales, which are the most vocal cetaceans).

Differences Between Dolphins and Porpoises Dolphins and porpoises are small
toothed  whales  of  suborder  Odontoceti. They  have  similarities  in  appearance,
behavior, and range and so are easily confused. For instance, both dolphins and
porpoises (as well as seals, sea lions, and fur seals) can exhibit a behavior known
as  porpoising, which  is  leaping  out  of  the  water  while  swimming. However,
there are several morphological differences between dolphins and porpoises.

Porpoises  are  somewhat  smaller  and  have  a  more  stout  (bulky  and  robust)
body  shape  compared  to  the  more  elongated  and  streamlined  dolphins.
Generally, porpoises have a blunt snout (rostrum), while dolphins have a longer
rostrum. Porpoises  have  a  smaller  and  more  triangular  (or, on  one  species, no)
dorsal fin, whereas  a dolphin s  dorsal  fin  is sickle-shaped, or  falcate (falcatus *
sickle) and appears hooked and curved backward in profile view.

They also have differences in the shape of their teeth, although it is often dif-

the teeth of porpoises are blunt or flat (shovel shaped) and resemble our incisors
(front  teeth). Killer  whales  have  teeth  that  end  in  points  (Figure  14.22)  and

thus are members of the dolphin family.

Echolocation  and  Hearing  in  Toothed  Whales Despite
their lack of vocal cords, toothed whales can produce
a variety of sounds
some of which are within
the  range  of  human  hearing. Sounds  are
emitted from the blowhole or, in sperm whales,
near a special structure called the  museau  du
singe ( monkey s  muzzle )  (Figure  14.23).
Contractions  of  muscles  in  these  structures
produce  sound  that  reflects  off  the  front  of  the
skull, which is bowl shaped and resembles a radar
dish. The sound is concentrated as it passes through
an organ called the melon (or the spermaceti organ in
sperm  whales). This  organ  can  form  various
shapes and sizes of lenses (Figure 14.23a) and
acts  as  an  acoustical  lens, focusing  the
sound. Speculations  about  the  sounds

frequency at closer range, the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops
truncatus) can detect a school of fish at distances exceeding
100 meters (330 feet). It can pick out an individual fish 13.5
centimeters  (5.3  inches)  long  at  a  distance  of  9  meters 
(30  feet). Sperm  whales, moreover, can  detect  their  main
prey squid from distances of up to 400 meters (1300 feet).
To locate an object and determine its distance, toothed
whales send sound signals through the water, some of which
are  reflected  from  various  objects  and  are  returned  to  the
animal  and  interpreted  (Figure  14.24). Because  sound
penetrates  objects, echolocation  can  produce  a  three-
dimensional image of the object s internal structure and density (which is more
than  eyesight  alone  can  do). Recent  research  indicates  that  the  cetaceans  may
also use a sharp burst of sound to stun their prey before they close in for the kill.
How  the  reflected  sound  is  received  back  by  toothed  whales  is  not  yet  fully
understood. In most mammals, the bony housing of the inner ear is fused to the skull.
When submerged, sounds transmitted through the water are picked up by the skull
and travel to the hearing structure from many directions, which makes it impossible
to accurately locate the source of the sounds. This kind of hearing structure would
not work for an animal that depends on echolocation to find objects in water.

All  cetaceans  have  evolved  structures  that  insulate  the  inner  ear  housing
from the rest of the skull. In toothed whales, the inner ear is separated from the
rest of the skull and surrounded by an extensive system of air sinuses (cavities).
The sinuses are filled with an insulating emulsion of oil, mucus, and air and are
surrounded by fibrous connective tissue and venous networks. In many toothed
whales, it  is  believed  that  sound  is  picked  up  by  the  thin, flaring  jawbone  and
passed to the inner ear via the connecting, oil-filled body.10

There  is  growing  concern  that  noise  pollution  in  the  ocean  is  affecting
cetaceans. This increased noise comes from the greater number of ships plying the
world s oceans as well as the larger size, higher speeds, and enhanced propulsion
power  of  individual  ships. In  fact, low-frequency  ambient  marine  noise  has
increased tenfold during the past 50 years and is increasing at a rate of 3 decibels
per decade. The impact of this increased underwater noise on cetacean hearing,
behavior, and communication is unknown.

How Intelligent Are Toothed Whales? The question of cetacean intelligence is a
topic  of  much  debate. Although  there  may  not  be  a  definitive  answer, the
following facts about toothed whales imply a certain level of intelligence:

They can communicate with each other by using sound.
They have large brains relative to their body size.11
Their brains are highly convoluted a characteristic shared by many organisms
that are considered to have highly developed intelligence (such as humans and
other primates).
Some wild dolphins have been reported to assist drowning humans in the ocean.
Some dolphins have been trained to respond to hand signals and do tricks on
command (such as retrieve objects).

Although  toothed  whales  have  remarkable  abilities, this  does  not  necessarily
imply  intelligence. Pigeons, for  instance, which  are  not  known  for  being  highly
intelligent, have also been trained to retrieve objects by using hand signals. Perhaps
many of us would like to think that whales and dolphins are more intelligent than

In a battle between a killer whale and a great white
shark, which one would win?

Although  many  people  who  are  fascinated  with  large
and powerful wild animals have often wondered which
of the two would win such a fight, there was little evi-
dence to settle the dispute until recently. A remarkable
video  was  taken  in  waters  off  northern  California 
in  1997,  documenting  a  battle  between  a  6-meter
(20-foot)  juvenile  killer  whale  (Orcinus  orca)  and  a 
3.6-meter 
(12-foot)  adult  great  white  shark
(Carcharodon carcharias). The video clearly shows the
killer whale biting and completely severing the shark s
head! If this is representative of the way these two ani-
mals  interact  in  the  wild,  then  the  killer  whale  is  the
top carnivore in the ocean. It is believed that the killer
whale s superior maneuverability and use of echolocation
helped it defeat the shark.

KILLER WHALES: A REPUTATION DESERVED?

Killer  whales  (Orcinus  orca)  are  sleek
and  powerful  predatory  animals  that
inhabit all oceans of the world. Once con-
sidered ferocious man-eaters, it turns out
they  are  social  animals  that  don t  harm
people. Why, then, are  they  called  killer
whales?

Killer  whales  prey  mainly  on  fish.
When fish are not plentiful, some feed on

employing  various 

other  dolphins,
large  whales, penguins,
birds, squid, turtles, seals, or  sea  lions
(Figure 14B). Killer whales often hunt in
groups,
strategies,
including deception, to trap their prey.Their
distinctive  black-and-white  coloration a

eye patch often confuse their prey as they
close  in  for  the  kill. Killer  whales  have

FIGURE 14B Killer whale (Orcinus orca) hunting sea lions near Valdes, Argentina.

often  been  called  wolves  of  the  sea
because of their group hunting tactics.

Killer  whales  often  play  with  their
food before killing it. Similar to the way a
cat plays with a mouse, killer whales have
been  known  to  hone  their  hunting  skills
by  repeatedly  releasing  their  prey  and
then  catching  it  again. Sometimes, they
throw  their  prey  completely  out  of  the
water. These  behaviors  appear  cruel, so
they may have contributed to the whale s
common name.

Killer whales have rammed and sunk
boats  many  times  and  have  even  been
known  to  tug  on  divers   fins, but  there  is
only  one  documented  case  of  a  killer
whale  killing  a  human. This  occurred  in
1991, when  trainer  Keltie  Byrne  of  the
marine  park  Sealand  of  the  Pacific  in
Victoria, Canada, accidentally slipped into
the killer whale pool. As she attempted to
climb  out, a  killer  whale  pulled  her  back
into  the  water, where  she  was  tossed
about  by  killer  whales  in  the  pool  for
10 minutes. Finally, one whale carried her
underwater  in  its  mouth  for  longer  than
she could hold her breath, causing her to
drown. Evidently, the  killer  whales  saw
her as a new play object and inadvertently
killed her. In the wild, however, there has
never  been  a  documented  case  in  which
killer  whales  have  maliciously  attacked
and killed a human being.

they really are because humans feel an attachment to these charismatic, seemingly
ever-smiling, air-breathing creatures. It is interesting to note that even experts in the
field of animal intelligence disagree on how to assess human intelligence accurately,
let alone that of a marine mammal.

If the large brain that toothed whales possess is not an indication of intelli-
gence, then why is their brain so large? Leading whale researchers don t exactly
know, but it might be because toothed whales need a large brain to process the
wealth of information they receive from the sound echoes they transmit. Because
intelligence is difficult to measure, perhaps it is best to say that animals of suborder
Odontoceti are tremendously well adapted to the marine environment.

SUBORDER  MYSTICETI Suborder  Mysticeti (mystic

bottom feeder).

Baleen  whales  are  generally  much  larger  than  toothed  whales  because  of
differences in food sources. Baleen whales eat lower on the food web (including
zooplankton  such  as  krill  and  small  nektonic  organisms), which  are  relatively
abundant  in  the  marine  environment. How  are  the  largest  whales  in  the  world
able to survive on eating such small prey, especially when these smaller organisms
are widely dispersed in the marine environment?

Use of Baleen To concentrate small prey items and separate them from seawater,
baleen  whales  have  parallel  rows  of  baleen (balaena
  whale)  plates  in  their
mouths  instead  of  teeth  (Figure  14.25a). These  baleen  plates  hang  from  the
whale s  upper  jaw  and, when  the  whale  opens  its  mouth, the  baleen  resembles

mouths), which  is  why  these  whales  are  sometimes
called the moustached whales (Figures 14.25c, 14.26).
Baleen  is  made  of  flexible  keratin the  same  as
human  nails  and  hair
and  can  be  up  to  4.3  meters
(14 feet) long (Figure 14.25d).12

To feed, baleen whales fill their mouths with water
that contains their prey items, (Figure 14.25b) allowing
their pleated lower jaw to balloon in size. The whales
force  the  water  out  between  the  fibrous  plates  of
baleen, trapping small fish, krill, and other plankton in-
side their mouths. Mostly, baleen whales feed at or near
the  surface, sometimes  working  together  in  large
groups and surfacing in vertical lunges (Figure 14.26).
The  gray  whale, however, has  short  baleen  slats  and
feeds  by  straining  benthic  organisms  such  as  am-
phipods and shellfish from bottom sediment.

Baleen Whale Families Baleen  whales  can  be
grouped into one of the following three families:

1. The gray whale, which has short, coarse baleen, no dorsal fin, and only two to

five ventral grooves on its lower jaw.

2. The rorqual13 whales, which have short baleen, many ventral grooves, and are

divided into two subfamilies:

a) The  balaenopterids, which  have  long, slender  bodies, small  sickle-shaped
dorsal fins, and flukes with smooth edges (minke, Bryde s, sei, fin, and blue
whales).

b) The  megapterids, or  humpback  whales, which  have  a  more  robust  body,
long flippers, flukes with uneven trailing edges, tiny dorsal fins, and nodules
or tubercles (bumps that hold a single long hair) on the head.

3. The right whales,14 which have long, fine baleen, broad triangular flukes, no
dorsal fin, and no  ventral grooves. The  northern right  whale is most  threat-
ened  with  extinction. The  other  members  of  this  family  are  the  Southern
Hemisphere s  southern  right  whale  and  the  bowhead  whale, which  remains
near the edge of the Arctic pack ice.

Baleen Whales and Sounds Baleen whales produce sound too, but at much lower
frequencies  than  toothed  whales. For  example, gray  whales  produce  pulses
(possibly for echolocation) and moans that may help them maintain contact with
other  gray  whales. Rorqual  whales  produce  moans  that  last  from  one  to  many
seconds. These sounds are extremely low in frequency and are probably used to
communicate over distances of up to 50 kilometers (31 miles). Blue whales have
been documented to produce sounds that may travel along the SOFAR channel
across entire ocean basins.15 Songs of humpback whales are thought to be a form
of  sexual  display, but  it  is  unclear  whether  their  main  purpose  is  to  repel  other
males or to attract females.

12Baleen (also called whalebone) was used for such items as buggy whips and corset stays before syn-
thetic materials mostly plastics were substituted.
13The term rorqual refers to the longitudinal grooves on the lower jaw called rorqual folds; rorqual
means  furrow whale in Norwegian.
14The right whales are so named because they swim slowly, live close to shore, float when dead, and
yield plenty of oil, meat, and whalebone, so, from a 19th century whaler s point of view, they were the

right whale to take.
15For more details about the SOFAR channel, see Box 16.1.

FIGURE 14.26 A pair of humpback whales bubblenet
feeding in Antarctic waters. Humpback whales
(Megaptera novaeangliae) often feed by swimming in a circle
underwater and emitting a curtain of bubbles to corral prey.
Then each whale swims through the concentrated prey with
their mouth open and surfaces in a vertical lunge. Baleen
plates are used to filter prey items from the water and occur
as parallel rows on the upper jaw that are separated by the
roof of the mouth (pink). Also visible on the head are round
bumps, which are called nodules or tubercules and hold a sin-
gle long hair. Whalers called these bumps stove bolts because
they looked like the stove bolts that hold a ship together.

FIGURE 14.27 Gray whale migration route. Gray
whales (Eschrichtius robustus) undertake as much as a 
22,000 kilometers (13,700 miles) annual migration, the
longest of any mammal. They migrate from Arctic summer
feeding areas in the Bering and Chukchi Seas to warmer 
winter breeding and calving lagoons offshore Mexico.

14.5 An Example of Migration: Why Do

Gray Whales Migrate?

such as fish, squid, sea turtles, and marine mammals

Many marine organisms
undertake  seasonal  migrations. Some  of  the  longest  migrations  known  in  the
open ocean are those of baleen whales, and one of the best-studied is that of the
gray  whale  (Eschrichtius  robustus, often  called  the  Pacific  gray  whale, or
California  gray  whale). Gray  whales, which  are  a  medium-sized, slow-moving
coastal whale with a mottled gray appearance, can live 60 years, grow to 15 meters
(50 feet) in length, and weigh up to 32 metric tons (35 short tons).

Migration Route
The  migratory  routes  of  commercially  important  baleen  whales  (including  gray
whales)  have  been  well  known  since  the  mid-1800s. Marine  mammals  are  rela-
tively  easy  to  track  because  they  must  surface  periodically  for  air. Gray  whales
are particularly easy to track because they spend their entire lives in nearshore
areas. Radio tracking of individual gray whales has delineated the route and tim-
ing of their migration.

Gray whales undertake a 22,000-kilometer (13,700-mile) round-trip journey
every year, the longest known migration of any mammal. Gray whales feed pri-
marily  on  sea  floor  organisms  in  cold  high-latitude  waters  in  the  coastal Arctic
Ocean and the far northern Pacific Ocean near Alaska; they breed and give birth
in  warm  tropical  lagoons  along  the  west  coast  of  Baja  California  and  mainland
Mexico  (Figure  14.27). Feeding  occurs  during  the  highly  productive  summer,
when long hours of sunlight produce an abundant feast of crustaceans, clams, and
other bottom-dwelling organisms in the shallow portions of the Bering, Chukchi,
and  Beaufort  Seas. Without  this  bountiful  food, the  whales  could  not  sustain
themselves during the long migrations and the mating and calving season, when
feeding is minimal.

Reasons for Migration
Initially, gray whales were thought to migrate so far because the physical environ-
ment of their cold-water feeding grounds did not meet the needs of young gray
whales. Recent  research  on  the  physiology  of  newborn  gray  whales  indicates,
however, that gray whale calves can survive in much colder water. So why do they
migrate? One hypothesis is that the migration is a relic from the Ice Age, when
sea level was lower. During that time, the feeding grounds that are so productive
today were above sea level. Hence, gray whales could not feast on the abundant
food and probably gave birth to smaller calves that could not survive in the cold
water. This necessitated the migration to warmer water regions, which continues
to this day despite the abundant food supply.

Alternatively, gray  whales  may  have  left  the  colder  waters  to  avoid  killer
whales, which are more numerous there and are a major threat to young whales.
This may also explain why only those lagoons in Mexico with shallow entrances
are used for calving. Killer whales have been seen near the lagoons, however, and
have also been observed to feed in extremely shallow water (see Figure 14B).

Timing of Migration
The  timing  of  the  gray  whale  migration  is  closely  linked  to  physical  oceano-
graphic  conditions. The  migration  usually  begins  in  September, after  the  high-
latitude summer bloom in productivity has peaked. By this time, the whales have

How do whales, you know, DO IT?!

Whale sex is truly an incredible achievement. Imagine
trying to copulate as whales do when you have noth-
ing with which to grasp a mate and, in the ocean, you
have nothing to push against for support! Copulation
in large whales has been infrequently studied and wit-
nessed in only a remarkably few cases. In fact, copu-
lation  of  the  world s  largest  whale,  the  blue  whale,
has never been observed.

From coastal-dwelling whale species such as the
gray whale, here s what is known: Whales are one of
the  few  animals  besides  humans  and  bonobo  chim-
panzees  that  copulate  belly-to-belly.  Mating  begins
when the female is in a forward  position horizontally
near the water surface. She turns toward the male,
who emerges from below and enters her as they spi-
ral on their long axis through the water, which helps
push  them  together.  As  with  many  other  mammals,
mating  takes  only  a  few  seconds.  Both  a  whale s
penis and its testes are internal to enhance stream-
lining  but  the  tapered  fibro-elastic  tip  of  the  penis  is
especially  suited  for  the  tricky  act  of  copulation  with
no  limbs.  Once  it  is  extruded  outside  the  body  for
mating, it is dexterous enough to maneuver itself into
a female s genital slit to deposit sperm.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Gray whales undertake the longest migration of 
any mammal, traveling from high-latitude 
Arctic summer feeding areas to low-latitude 
winter birthing and breeding lagoons in Mexico.

stored  enough  fat  to  last  them  until  they  return  to  high-latitude  waters. Gray
whales  have  been  observed  to  feed  during  their  migration, however, when  the
opportunity  presents  itself. When  pack  ice  begins  to  form  over  their  feeding
grounds along the continental shelf, the whales begin to move south.

Pregnant females are the first to leave. They are followed by the nonpregnant
mature females, immature females, mature males, and then immature males. After
navigating through passages between the Aleutian Islands, they follow the coast
throughout their southern journey. Traveling about 200 kilometers (125 miles) per
day, most reach the lagoons of Baja California by the end of January.

In these warm-water lagoons, the pregnant females give birth to calves that
are about 4.6 meters (15 feet) long and weigh about 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons).
The calves nurse on milk that is almost half butterfat and has the consistency of
cheese, allowing the calves to put on weight quickly during the next two months.
While  the  calves  are  nursing, the  mature  males  breed  with  the  mature  females
that did not bear calves. Producing large offspring (the gestation period is up to
one year) and providing them with fat-rich milk for several months requires enor-
mous  amounts  of  energy, so  it  is  not  uncommon  for  females  to  mate  only  once
every two or three years.

Beginning  in  late  February, they  return  north  in  reverse  order  (beginning,
that  is, with  the  immature  males). Most  of  the  whales  are  back  in  their  high-
latitude feeding grounds by the end of June, which coincides with the beginning of
the summer bloom in productivity. The whales are able to feed once again on the
prodigious quantities of bottom-dwelling organisms found here to replenish their
depleted stores of fat and blubber before their next yearly trip south.

Gray Whales as Endangered Species
Although  many  other  whales  exist  in  smaller  populations  than  before  whaling
(Figure  14.28)  and  are  endangered  species, the  North  Pacific  gray  whale  was
removed from the endangered species list in 1993 when their numbers exceeded
20,000, which  surpassed  the  estimated  size  of  their  population  before  whaling.
Out  of  nearly  1400  species  listed  as  endangered  since  1973, gray  whales  have
become one of only 13 species to be removed from the endangered species list.
Other  populations  of  gray  whales  were  not  so  fortunate. For  instance, the  gray
whales that used to inhabit the North Atlantic Ocean were hunted to extinction
several centuries ago, and the gray whales that live in the waters near Japan may
also have recently become extinct.

These slow-moving whales of suborder Mysticeti spend most of their lives in
coastal waters, which made them easy targets for whalers. In the mid-1800s, they
were traced to their birthing and breeding lagoons and were hunted to the brink
of extinction. A common strategy was to harpoon a calf, which then lured its vigi-
lant  mother  to  the  whalers, too. During  this  time, gray  whales  were  known  as
devilfish because the adults would often capsize small whaling boats when they
came to the aid of their young. By the late 1800s, the number of gray whales had
diminished to the point that they were difficult to find during their annual migra-
tion. Fortunately, these  low  numbers  also  made  it  difficult  for  whalers  to  hunt
them successfully.

In 1938, the International Whaling Treaty banned the taking of gray whales,
which  were  thought  to  be  nearly  extinct. This  protection  has  allowed  them  to
steadily increase in number to this day and to become the first marine creature to
be removed from endangered status. Their repopulation is truly one of the most
impressive success stories of how protecting animals can ensure their continued
survival. What  is  perhaps  most  surprising  is  how  friendly  they  are  now  toward
people  in  boats  (Figure  14.29)  in  the  same  lagoons  where  they  were  hunted  to
near extinction over 150 years ago. Devilfish, indeed!

prewhaling). Bar graph showing present world whale popu-
lations (red) compared to prewhaling populations (green) for
various species. Note that population size is shown as a loga-
rithmic scale. Full-scale commercial whaling was suspended
in 1986, when the plunging numbers of many whale species
moved the International Whaling Commission to declare a
moratorium. Today, however, certain countries are permitted
to catch designated species for research or cultural reasons.

Whaling and the International 
Whaling Commission
From the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s, many stocks of large whales in the world
were  overhunted  and  their  numbers  severely  depleted  (see  Figure  14.28). The
International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946 to manage the
subsistence and commercial hunting of large whales. In 1986, the 72 nations that
are members of the IWC passed a ban on commercial whaling in order to allow
whales  to  recover  from  overhunting  and  to  give  researchers  time  to  develop
methods  for  assessing  whale  populations. Today, the  ban  on  whaling  is  still  in
effect, although there has been a push by some nations to end the whaling mora-
torium  and  establish  annual  whale  quotas. The  ban  can  only  be  reversed  by  a
three-quarters majority vote of member nations.

According  to  the  IWC, there  are  three  ways  to  engage  in  legal  hunting  of

whales:

1. Whaling by objection. Countries can continue to hunt whales legally under
an  objection  to  the  IWC  ban  on  commercial  whaling. (Notable  countries
doing this: Norway.)

2. Scientific whaling. Countries may decide to kill whales for scientific research.
Under the IWC convention, meat from whales hunted for this research may
be sold commercially. (Notable countries doing this: Japan.16)

3. Aboriginal  subsistence  whaling. Subsistence  whaling  by  native  cultures  is
allowed by the IWC in special cases where there is a long-standing cultural
tradition of whaling and where whale meat satisfies the nutritional needs of
the community. (Notable countries doing this: Greenland, Russia, the United
States, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean).

Chapter 14

Animals of the Pelagic Environment

Chapter in Review

Pelagic animals that comprise the majority of the ocean s biomass remain
mostly  within  the  upper  surface  waters  of  the  ocean, where  their  primary
food source exists. Those animals that are not planktonic (floating forms
such as microscopic zooplankton) depend on buoyancy or their ability to
swim to help them remain in food-rich surface waters.

Good  fossil  evidence  shows  that  marine  mammals  evolved  from  land-
dwelling animals about 50 million years ago. Marine mammals are warm-
blooded; breathe air; have hair or fur; bear live young; and the females have
mammary  glands. Marine  mammals  belong  to  orders  Carnivora, Sirenia,
and Cetacea.

The rigid gas containers in some cephalopods and the expandable swim
bladders  in  some  fish  help  increase  buoyancy. Other  organisms  maintain
their positions near the surface with gas-filled floats (such as those of the
Portuguese man-of-war) and soft bodies that lack high-density hard parts
(such as the jellyfish).

Marine mammals within order Carnivora have prominent canine teeth
and include sea otters, polar bears, and the pinnipeds (walruses, seals, sea
lions, and  fur  seals). Marine  mammals  of  order  Sirenia, which  include
manatees and dugongs ( sea cows ), have toenails (manatees only), sparse
hairs covering their bodies, and are vegetarians.

Nekton squid, fish, and  marine  mammals are  strong  swimmers that
depend  on  their  swimming  ability  to  avoid  predators  and  obtain  food.
Squid  swim  by  trapping  water  in  their  body  cavities  and  forcing  it  out
through a siphon. Most fish swim by creating a wave of body curvature that
passes from the front of the fish to the back and provides a forward thrust.

The caudal (rear) fin provides the most thrust, while the paired pelvic and
pectoral (chest) fins are used for maneuvering. The dorsal (back) and anal fins
serve primarily as stabilizers. A rounded caudal fin is flexible and can be used
for maneuvering at slow speeds. The lunate fin is rigid and is of little use in
maneuvering but produces thrust efficiently for fast swimmers such as tuna.

Fish can be categorized as lungers (such as groupers) or cruisers (such as
tuna). Lungers sit motionless and lunge at passing prey. They have mostly
white  muscle  tissue, which  fatigues  more  quickly  than  red  muscle  tissue.
Cruisers swim constantly in search of prey and possess mostly red, myoglobin-
rich muscle tissue.

Fish swim slowly when  cruising, fast  when hunting for  prey, and  fastest
when trying to escape from predators. Although most fish are cold-blooded,
the fast-swimming tuna, Thunnus, is homeothermic, meaning that it main-
tains its body temperature well above water temperature.

the ability to organically

Many  marine  organisms  such  as  fish, squid, and  crustaceans  exhibit
schooling, probably because it increases their chances of avoiding preda-
tion  compared  to  swimming  alone  and  serves  to  preserve  the  species.
Some organisms live closely together in symbiotic relationships.

The  mammals  best  adapted  to  life  in  the  open  ocean  are  those  of  the
order Cetacea, which includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Cetaceans
have  highly  streamlined  bodies so  that  they  are  fast  swimmers. Other
such as being able to absorb 90% of the oxygen they inhale,
adaptations
storing large quantities of oxygen, reducing the use of oxygen by noncriti-
cal  organs, and  having  collapsible  ribs  and  lungs) allow  them  to  dive
deeply and  minimize  the  effects  of  nitrogen  narcosis  and  decompression
sickness, although recent research indicates that they are not immune to it.

Cetaceans are divided into suborder Odontoceti (the toothed whales) and
suborder  Mysticeti  (the  baleen  whales). Odontocetes  use  echolocation to
find  their  way  through  the  ocean  and  locate  prey. They  emit  clicking
sounds, and can determine the size, shape, internal structure, and distance
of  the  objects  from  the  nature  of  the  returning  signals  and  the  time
elapsed.

Mysticetes, which include the largest whales in the world, separate their
small  prey  from  seawater  using  their  baleen  plates  as  a  strainer. Baleen
whales include the gray whale, the rorqual whales, and the right whales.

Gray  whales  migrate  from  their  cold-water  summer  feeding  grounds  in
the Arctic to warm, low-latitude lagoons in Mexico during winter for breed-
ing and birthing purposes. This behavior may have evolved to allow their
young to be born into warm water during the last ice age, when lower sea
level eliminated today s highly productive Arctic feeding areas.

The International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946 to
manage the subsistence and commercial hunting of large whales, which had
experienced  severe  population  decreases. Commercial  whaling  was
banned in 1986, although whaling can still be done under objection to the
ban, for scientific research, or by native cultures.

ANIMALS OF THE BENTHIC
ENVIRONMENT

Of the 250,000 known species that inhabit the marine environment, more than 98% (about 245,000)
live in or on the ocean floor. Ranging from the rocky, sandy, and muddy intertidal zone to the muddy
deposits of the deepest ocean trenches, the ocean floor provides a tremendously varied environment
that is home to a diverse group of specially adapted organisms.

Living at or near the interface of the ocean floor and seawater, an organism s success is closely
related to its ability to cope with the physical conditions of the water, the ocean floor, and the other
organisms that inhabit its environment. In this chapter, we ll examine a variety of benthic communities
and the animals that inhabit them.

15.1 How Are Benthic Organisms Distributed?
The distribution of benthic biomass1 shown in Figure 15.1 closely matches the distribution of chloro-
phyll  in  surface  waters  (which  is  an  approximation  of  primary  productivity; compare  Figures  15.1
and 13.5). Mostly, life on the ocean floor depends on the productivity of the ocean s surface waters;
as a result, great abundances of benthic life are found beneath areas of high primary productivity.

The vast majority of known benthic species live on the continental shelf, where the water is often
shallow  enough  to  allow  sunlight  to  penetrate  to  the  ocean  bottom  and  support  photosynthesis.
Recent expeditions to the deep-ocean floor, however, suggest that there are a huge number of unde-
scribed species that live there.

The  number  of  benthic  species  found  at  similar  latitudes  on  opposite  sides  of  an  ocean  basin
depends on how ocean surface currents affect coastal water temperature one of the most impor-
tant variables affecting species diversity. The Gulf Stream, for example, warms the European coast
from Spain to the northern tip of Norway, giving rise to more than three times the number of benthic
species  than  are  found  in  similar  latitudes  along  the Atlantic  coast  of  North America, where  the
Labrador Current cools the water as far south as Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

15.2 What Communities Exist Along Rocky Shores?
Rocky shorelines teem with organisms that live on the surface of the ocean floor. These organisms,
called epifauna (epi
 animal) are either permanently attached to the bottom (for
example, marine  algae)  or  move  over  it  (for  example, crabs). Table  15.1 lists  some  of  the  special
adaptations these organisms have to withstand the rigors of life on rocky shores.

nental shelf areas. Note the similar-
ity in distribution to that of surface
chlorophyll (see Figure 13.5),
which suggests that most of the
benthic community receives its
food from surface waters.

Diversity  of  species  that  inhabit  rocky  shores  varies  widely. Overall, rocky
intertidal  ecosystems  have  a  moderate  diversity  of  species  compared  to  other
benthic environments. The greatest animal diversity is in the lower (tropical) lati-
tudes, while  the  diversity  of  algae  is  greater  in  the  middle  latitudes, probably
because of better availability of nutrients.2

Intertidal Zonation
A  typical  rocky  shore  (Figure  15.2a)  can  be  divided  into  a  spray  zone, which  is
above the spring high tide line and is covered by water only during storms, and an
intertidal zone, which lies between the high and low tidal extremes. Along most
shores, the  intertidal  zone  can  clearly  be  separated  into  the  following  subzones
(Figure 15.2a):

The high tide zone, which is relatively dry and is covered only by the highest
high tides
The middle tide zone, which is alternately covered by all high tides and exposed
during all low tides
The low tide zone, which is usually wet but is exposed during the lowest low tides

The subzones of the intertidal zone can also be delineated based on the pop-
ulations of organisms that attach themselves to the bottom. Each centimeter of
the rocky shore has a significantly different character than the centimeter above
and below it, so organisms have evolved to withstand very specific degrees of ex-
posure to the atmosphere. Consequently, the most finely delineated biozones in
the marine environment can be found along rocky shores.

2As discussed in Chapter 13, this increased nutrient supply is a result of the lack of a permanent ther-
mocline in the middle latitudes.

Organisms that live within the spray zone, which is also known as the supratidal

periods when they are above water level. Consequently, many animals, such as the
periwinkle  snail  (genus  Littorina; Figure  15.2b), have  shells, and  few  species  of

Animals of the Benthic Environment

The High Tide Zone: Organisms and Their
Adaptations
Like animals within the spray zone, most animals that inhabit the high tide zone
have  a  protective  covering  to  prevent  them  from  drying  out. Periwinkles, for
example, have a protective shell and can move between the spray zone and the
high tide zone. Buckshot barnacles (Figure 15.2e) have a protective shell, too, but
they cannot live above the high tide shoreline because they filter-feed from sea-
water, and their larval form is planktonic.

The most conspicuous algae in the high tide zone are rock weeds, members of
the genus Fucus that live in colder latitudes (Figure 15.2f) and Pelvetia that live in
warmer latitudes. Both have thick cell walls to reduce water loss during periods of
low tide.

Rock weeds are among the first organisms to colonize a rocky shore. Later,
sessile (sessilis
those attached to the bottom, such as
barnacles and mussels begin to establish themselves, competing for attachment
sites with the rock weeds.

 sitting on) animal forms

The Middle Tide Zone: Organisms and Their
Adaptations
Seawater constantly bathes the middle tide zone, so more types of marine algae and
soft-bodied animals can live there.The total biomass is much greater than in the high
tide zone, so there is much greater competition for rock space among sessile forms.

Shelled  organisms  inhabiting  the  middle  tide  zone  include  acorn  barnacles
(Balanus) (Figure 15.2g); gooseneck barnacles (Pollicipes) (Figure 15.2h), which
attach themselves to rocks with a long, muscular neck; and various mussels (gen-
era Mytilus and Modiolus) (Figure 15.2h). Mussels attach to bare rock, algae, or
barnacles during their planktonic stage and remain in place by means of strong
byssus threads.

Mussels are often grouped together into a distinctive mussel bed that appears
as a pronounced band or layer (Figure 15.3a) and can often be one of the most rec-
ognizable features of middle tidal zones along rocky coasts. It thickens toward the
bottom until it reaches an abrupt bottom limit, where physical conditions restrict
mussel  growth. Often  protruding  from  the  mussel  bed  are  numerous  gooseneck
barnacles; crowded in with the mussels are less-conspicuous species such as acorn

FIGURE 15.3 Middle tide zone mussel bed and sea star.
(a) The distinctive black band covering the rock surface is a
bed of mussels (Mytilus), which is a common feature of mid-
dle tide zones along rocky shores such as this one along the
Southern California coast. Also shown are acorn barnacles
(attached to mussels) and gooseneck barnacles (white).
(b) An ochre sea star (Pisaster) feeds on a mussel by first 
enveloping a mussel with its tube feet and prying apart the
mussel s shell. The star can then digest the mussel s soft 
tissues with its own everted stomach.

barnacles, crustaceans, marine
worms, rock-boring clams, sea
stars, and algae.

Carnivorous snails and sea
stars  (such  as  genera  Pisaster
and  Asterias)  feed  upon  mus-
sels in  the mussel  beds. To  pry
open the mussel shell, sea stars
pull  on  either  side  with  hun-
dreds of tubelike feet.The mus-
sel  eventually  becomes 
fa-
tigued  and  can  no  longer  hold
its  shell  halves  closed. When
the shell opens ever so slightly,
the  sea  star  turns  its  stomach
inside  out, slips  it  through  the
crack  in  the  mussel  shell, and
digests  the  edible  tissue  inside
(Figure 15.3b).

Where  the  rock  surface
flattens  out  within  the  middle
tidal zone, tide pools trap water
as  the  tide  ebbs. These  pools
support  microecosystems  con-
taining a wide variety of organ-
isms. The  most  conspicuous
member  of  this  community  is
often  the  sea  anemone  (see
Figure 15.2i), which is a relative
of the jellyfish.

Sea anemone
(polyp body form)

Shaped  like  a  sack, anemones  have  a  flat  foot  disk  that  provides  a  suction
attachment  to  the  rock  surface. Directed  upward, the  open  end  of  the  sack  is  the
mouth, which leads directly to the gut cavity and is surrounded by rows of tentacles
(Figure  15.4). The  tentacles  are  covered  with  stinging  needlelike  cells  called
nematocysts (nemato  thread, cystis
 bladder) (Figure 15.4, inset), which inject the
victim with a potent neurotoxin. When an organism brushes against a sea anemone s
tentacles, the nematocysts are automatically released (except for certain organisms
such as clownfish that live in a symbiotic relationship with a sea anemone).

Hermit crabs (Pagurus) inhabit tide pools, too. They have a well-armored pair
of claws and upper body but a soft, unprotected abdomen, which they protect by
inhabiting an abandoned snail shell (Figure 15.5a). They can often be seen scurry-
ing around the tide pool area or fighting with other hermit crabs for new shells.
Their abdomen has even evolved a curl to the right to make it fit properly into
snail shells. Once in the snail shell, the crab can protect itself by closing off the
shell s opening with its large claws.

In tide pools near the lower limit of the middle tide zone, sea urchins may be
found  feeding  on  algae  (Figure  15.5b). Sea  urchins  have  a  five-toothed  mouth
centered on the bottom side of their hard spherical shell, consisting of fused cal-
cium carbonate  plates  perforated to  allow tube  feet  and  water to  pass  through.
Resembling a pincushion, the shell of a sea urchin has numerous spines for pro-
tection and to scrape out protective holes in rocks.

The Low Tide Zone: Organisms and Their Adaptations
The  low  tide  zone  is  almost  always  submerged, so  an  abundance  of  algae  is
typically  present. A  diverse  community  of  animals  exists, too, but  they  are  hid-
den by  the  great  variety  of  marine  algae  and  surf  grass  (Phyllospadix)

Ive been at a tide pool and seen sea anemones.
When I put my finger on one, it tends to gently grab
my finger. Why does it do that?

The sea anemone is trying to kill you and wants to eat
you  (seriously!).  Disguised  as  a  harmless  flower,  the
sea  anemone  is  actually  a  vicious  predator  that  will
attack any unsuspecting animal (even a human) that
its stinging tentacles entrap. Fortunately, the skin on
your  hands  is  thick  enough  to  resist  the  stinging 
nematocyst and its neurotoxin. A couple of unsuspect-
ing people, however, were interested in finding out if
the sea anemone grabbed other things with its tenta-
cles, so they put their tongues into a sea anemone.
After a short time, their throats swelled almost com-
pletely closed, and they had to be rushed to a hospi-
tal. They lived, but the moral of this story is: NEVER
put your tongue into a sea anemone!

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Rocky shores are divided into the spray zone and high,
middle, and low tide (intertidal) zones. Many shelled 
organisms inhabit the upper zones, while more soft-
bodied organisms and algae inhabit the lower zones.

(Figure 15.6). Various  types  of  encrusting  red  algae  (such  as  Lithophyllum and
Lithothamnium), which  are  also  seen  in  middle-zone  tide  pools, become  very
abundant  in  lower  tide  pools. In  temperate  latitudes, moderate-sized  red  and
brown algae provide a drooping canopy beneath which much of the animal life
can hide during low tide.

Scampering from crevice to crevice and in and out of tide pools across the full
range of the intertidal zone are various species of shore crabs (Figure 15.7). These
scavengers help keep the shore clean. Shore crabs spend most of the day hiding in
cracks or beneath overhangs. At night, they eat algae as rapidly as they can tear
them  from  the  rock  surface  with  their  large  front  claws, called  chelae (khele

claw). Their hard exoskeleton prevents them from drying
out too quickly so they can spend long periods of time
out of water.

15.3 What Communities

Exist Along Sediment-
Covered Shores?

Even though most sediment-covered shores have inter-
tidal  zones  similar  to  rocky  shores,
life  on  and  in
sediment-covered shores requires very different adapta-
tions than on rocky shores. Sediment-covered shores, for
example, are composed of unconsolidated materials that
often  change  shape  and  so  require  specific  adaptations
for  organisms. In  addition, there  is  much  less  species
diversity in sediment-covered shores, but the organisms
are usually found in great numbers. In the low tide zone
of some beaches and on mud flats, for example, as many
as 5000 to 8000 burrowing clams have been counted in
only 1 square meter (10.8 square feet).

FIGURE 15.6 Surf grass. Green surf grass (Phyllospadix)
and various species of brown algae are exposed during an 
extremely low tide in this California tide pool. When the tide
rises, the anchored surf grass floats and provides a protective
hiding place for many low tide zone organisms.

Nearly  all  large  organisms  that  inhabit  sediment-
covered shores are called infauna (in  inside, fauna
 animal) because they can
burrow into the sediment. Sediment-covered shores also contain large numbers of
microbial  communities, particularly  in  quiet  environments  such  as  salt  marshes
and mud flats that tend to accumulate organic matter.

Physical Environment of the Sediment
Sediment-covered shores include coarse boulder beaches, sand beaches, salt marshes,
and  mud  flats, which  represent  progressively  lower  energy  environments  and  are
consequently  composed  of  progressively  finer  sediment. The  energy  level  that
a shore experiences is related to the strength of waves and longshore currents.Along
shores that experience low-energy levels, particle size becomes smaller, the sediment
slope decreases, and overall sediment stability increases. Thus, the sediment in a fine-
grained mud flat is more stable than that of a high-energy sandy beach.

A  large  quantity  of  water  from  breaking  waves  rapidly  sinks  into  the  sand
and brings a continual supply of nutrients and oxygen-rich water for the animals
that  live  there. This  supply  of  oxygen  also  enhances  bacterial  decomposition  of
dead  tissue. The  sediment  in  salt  marshes  and  mud  flats  is  not  nearly  as  rich  in
oxygen, however, so decomposition occurs more slowly.

Intertidal Zonation
The  intertidal  zone  of  the  sediment-covered  shore  consists  of  supratidal, high
tide, middle tide, and low tide zones, as shown in Figure 15.8. These zones are best
developed  on  steeply  sloping, coarse-sand  beaches  and  are  less  distinct  on  the
more gentle sloping, fine-sand beaches. On mud flats, the tiny, clay-sized particles

isms of sediment-covered shores. Profile view of a
coarse sand-covered shore showing intertidal zones, which
are related to the amount of exposure during low tide, and

zones. Beaches composed of finer sediment have more gentle
slopes and show less distinct intertidal zonation.

FIGURE 15.9 How a clam burrows. A clam burrows into
sediment by (a) extending its pointed foot into the sediment
and (b) forcing its foot deeper into the sediment and using
this increasing leverage to bring the exposed, shell-clad 
body toward vertical. When the foot has penetrated deeply
enough, a bulbous anchor forms at the bottom (c), and 
a quick muscular contraction pulls the entire animal into 
the sediment (d). The siphons are then pushed up above 
the sediment to pump in water (e), from which the clam 
extracts food and oxygen.

face of sandy beaches within the lower intertidal zone.

form a deposit with essentially no slope, so zonation is
not possible in this protected, low-energy environment.
The species of animals differ from zone to zone.
As in intertidal rocky shores, however, the maximum
number of species and the greatest biomass in inter-
tidal sediment-covered shores are found near the low
tide shoreline, and both diversity and biomass decrease
toward the high tide shoreline.

Sandy Beaches: Organisms and
Their Adaptations
Most  animals  at  the  beach  burrow  into  the  sand
because there is no stable, fixed surface (as on rocky
shores)  to  which  they  can  attach. As  a  result, organ-
isms  are  much  less  obvious  than  in  other  environ-
ments. By burrowing only a few centimeters beneath
the surface, they encounter a much more stable envi-
ronment where they are not bothered by fluctuations
of temperature and salinity or the threat of drying out.

 a
valve)  is  an  animal  having  two  hinged  shells, such  as  a  clam  or  a  mussel. A
mollusk is a member of the phylum Mollusca (molluscus
 soft), characterized by
a soft body and either an internal or external hard calcium carbonate shell.

BIVALVE MOLLUSKS A bivalve (bi

 two, valva

Bivalve  mollusks  are  well  adapted  to  living  within  sediment. A  single  foot
digs  into  the  sediment  to  pull  the  creature  down  into  the  sand. The  method  by
which clams bury themselves is shown in Figure 15.9. How deeply a bivalve can
bury itself depends on the length of its siphons, which must reach above the sedi-
ment surface to pull in water for food (plankton) and oxygen. Indigestible matter
is forced back out the siphon periodically by quick muscular contractions.

The greatest biomass of clams is burrowed into the low tide region of sandy

beaches and decreases where the sediment becomes muddier.

ANNELID WORMS A variety of annelids (annelus
 a ring) worms are also
well  adapted  to  life  in  the  sediment. The  lugworm  (Arenicola), for  example,
constructs a vertical, U-shaped burrow, the walls of which are strengthened with
mucus. The worm moves forward to feed and extends its proboscis (snout) up into
the  head  shaft  of  the  burrow  to  loosen  sand  with  quick, pulsing  movements.
A cone-shaped depression forms at the surface over the head end of the burrow
as  sand  continually  slides  into  the  burrow  and  is  ingested  by  the  worm. As  the
sand  passes  through  its  digestive  tract, the  sand s  biofilm (coating  of  organic
matter) is digested, and the processed sand is deposited back at the surface.

such as crabs, lobsters, shrimps,
CRUSTACEANS Crustaceans (crusta
and barnacles
include predominately aquatic animals that are characterized by
a segmented body, a hard exoskeleton, and paired, jointed limbs. On most sandy
beaches, numerous  crustaceans  called  beach  hoppers feed  on  kelp  cast  up  by
storm waves or high tides. A common genus is Orchestoidea, which is only 2 to
3 centimeters (0.8 to 1.2 inches) long but can jump more than 2 meters (6.6 feet)
high. Laterally  flattened, beach  hoppers  usually  spend  the  day  buried  in  the
sand or  hidden  in  kelp. They  become  particularly  active  at  night, when  large
groups  may  hop  at  the  same  time  and  form  clouds  above  the  piles  of  kelp  on
which they feed.

Sand  crabs  (Emerita)  (Figure  15.10)  are  a  type  of  crustacean  common  to
many sandy beaches. Ranging in length from 2.5 to 8 centimeters (1 to 3 inches),

15.3 What Communities Exist Along Sediment-Covered Shores?

they move up and down the beach near the shoreline. They bury their bodies in
the sand and leave their long, curved, V-shaped antennae pointing up the beach
slope. These little crabs filter food particles from the water, and can be located by
looking in the lower intertidal zone for a V-shaped pattern in the swash as it runs
down the beach face.

ECHINODERMS Echinoderms (echino  spiny, derma
 skin) that live in beach
deposits  include  the  sand  star  (Astropecten)  and  heart  urchin  (Echinocardium).
Sand  stars  prey  on  invertebrates  that  burrow  into  the  low  tide  region  of  sandy
beaches. The  sand  star  is  well  designed  for  moving  through  sediment, with  five
tapered legs with spines and a smooth back.

More flattened and elongated than the sea urchins of the rocky shore, heart
urchins live buried in the sand near the low tide line (Figure 15.11). They gather
sand grains into their mouths, where the biofilm of organic matter that coats sand
grains is scraped off and ingested.

  lesser, fauna

MEIOFAUNA Meiofauna (meio
  animal)  are  small  organisms
that  live  in  the  spaces  between  sediment  particles. These  organisms, generally
only  0.1  to  2  millimeters  (0.004  to  0.08  inch)  long, feed  primarily  on  bacteria
removed from the surface of sediment particles. Meiofauna include polychaetes,
mollusks, arthropods, and nematodes (Figure 15.12) and live in sediment from the
intertidal zone to deep-ocean trenches.

Mud Flats: Organisms and Their Adaptations
Eelgrass (Zostera) and turtle grass (Thalassia) are widely distributed in the low
tide zone of mud flats and the adjacent shallow coastal regions. Numerous open-
ings  at  the surface  of  mud  flats attest  to  a  large  population  of  bivalve mollusks
and other invertebrates.

Fiddler crabs (Uca) live in burrows that may exceed 1 meter (3 feet) deep in
mud flats. Relatives of the shore crabs, they usually measure no more than 2 cen-
timeters (0.8 inch) in width. Male fiddler crabs have one small claw and one over-
sized claw, which is up to 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) long (Figure 15.13). Fiddler
crabs get their name because this large claw is waved around as if they were play-
ing an imaginary fiddle. The females have two normal-sized claws. The large claw
of the male is used to court females and to fight competing males.

15.4 What Communities Exist on
the Shallow Offshore Ocean
Floor?

The  shallow  offshore  ocean  floor  extends  from  the  spring  low  tide
shoreline to the seaward edge of the continental shelf. It is mainly sedi-
ment  covered, but  rocky  exposures  may  occur  locally  near  shore. On
rocky exposures, many types of marine algae exist, which have adapta-
tions (such as gas-filled floats) for reaching from the shallow sea floor
to near the sunlit surface waters.

The sediment-covered shelf has moderate to low species diversity.
Surprisingly, the  diversity  of  benthic  organisms  is  lowest beneath
upwelling  regions. This  is  because  upwelling  waters  that  are  rich  in
nutrients  produce  high  pelagic  production, so  large  amounts  of  dead
organic matter are produced. When this matter rains down on the bot-
tom and decomposes, it consumes oxygen, so the oxygen supply can be
locally  depleted, thereby  limiting  benthic  populations. However, kelp
beds  associated  with  rocky  bottoms  are  a  specialized  shallow-water
community with higher diversity.

KELP  AND  KELP  FORESTS Along  the  North  American  Pacific  coast, the
giant brown  bladder  kelp (Macrocystis)  attaches  to  rocks  as  deep  as  30  meters
(100 feet)  and  is  attached  to  rocky  bottoms  with  a  rootlike  anchor  called  a
holdfast (Figure 15.14a), which is so strong that only large storm waves can break
the algae free. The stipes and blades of the algae are supported by gas-filled floats
called  pneumatocysts ( pneumato
  bladder), which  allow  the
algae  to  grow  upward  and  extend  for  another  30  meters  (100  feet)  along  the
surface to allow for good exposure to sunlight. Under ideal conditions, Macrocystis
can grow up to 0.6 meter (2 feet) per day, making it the fastest-growing algae in
the world.

  breath, cystis

The giant brown bladder kelp and bull kelp (Nereocystis), another fast-growing
kelp, often form beds called kelp forests along the Pacific coast (Figure 15.14b).
Smaller tufts of red and brown algae are found on the bottom and also live on the
kelp blades.

Kelp forests are highly productive ecosystems that provide shelter for a wide
variety  of  organisms  living  within  or  directly  upon  the  kelp  as  epifauna. These
organisms  are  an  important  food  source  for  many  of  the  animals  living  in  and
near the kelp forest, including mollusks, sea stars, fishes, octopuses, lobsters, and
marine mammals. Surprisingly, very few animals feed directly on the living kelp.
Among  those  that  do  are  sea  urchins  and  a  large  sea  slug  called  the  sea  hare
(Aplysia). The distribution of kelp forests is shown in Figure 15.14c.

LOBSTERS Large  crustaceans
are  common
along rocky bottoms. The spiny lobsters are named for their spiny covering and
have  two  very  large, spiny  antennae  (Figure  15.15a). These  antennae  serve  as
feelers and are equipped with noise-making devices near their base that are used
in  protection. The  genus  Panulirus, which  reaches  lengths  to  50  centimeters
(20 inches), is considered a delicacy and lives in water deeper than 20 meters (65 feet)
along  the  European  coast. The  Caribbean  lobster  (Panulirus  argus)  sometimes

What is an urchin barren?

An  urchin  barren  is  created  when  the  population  of
sea  urchins  goes  unchecked  and  the  urchins  devour
entire areas of giant brown bladder kelp (Macrocystis),
one  of  the  main  types  of  algae  in  kelp  forests.  The
urchins chew through the holdfast structure that holds
the kelp in place and set it adrift. In California, the se-
vere  reduction  of  animals  that  prey  on  urchins  (such
as  the  wolf  eel  and  sea  otter)  has  upset  the  natural
balance  of  ocean  food  webs.  Consequently,  sea
urchins have proliferated and urchin barrens now exist
where there were once lush kelp beds.

How big was the largest lobster ever caught?

lobster, Homarus americanus,  measured  1.1  meters
(3.5  feet)  from  the  end  of  its  tail  fan  to  the  tip  of  its
large claw and weighed 20.1 kilograms (44.4 pounds).
It  was  caught  off  Nova  Scotia,  Canada,  in  1977  and
was later sold to a New York restaurateur.

OYSTERS Oysters  are  thick-shelled  sessile  (anchored)  bivalve  mollusks  found
in estuaries. They grow best where there is a steady flow of clean water to provide
plankton and oxygen.

Oysters are food for sea stars, fishes, crabs, and snails that bore through the
shell and rasp away the soft tissue inside (Figure 15.16). In fact, this may be one of
the  main  reasons  that  oysters  have  such  a  thick  shell.3 Oysters  also  have  great
commercial importance to humans throughout the world as a food source.

Oyster beds are composed of empty shells of many previous generations that
are cemented to a hard substrate or to one another, with the living generation on
top. Each female produces many millions of eggs each year, which become plank-
tonic  larvae  when  fertilized. After  a  few  weeks  as  plankton, the  larvae  attach
themselves to the bottom. As a material upon which
to anchor, oyster larvae prefer (in order): live oyster
shells, dead oyster shells, and rock.

pressure in another species for a defense to defeat it. This, in turn, causes other evolutionary traits for
new weapons, creating a co-evolutionary  arms race.

are restricted to shallow warmer water regions. See Chapter 2 for a description of
the stages of development in coral reefs.

CONDITIONS  NECESSARY  FOR  CORAL  REEF  DEVELOPMENT Corals  are
very  temperature  sensitive  and  require  warm  water  to  survive. in  fact, corals
need  water  where  the  average  monthly  temperature  exceeds  18°C  (64°F)
throughout  the  year  (Figure  15.17). Furthermore, water  that  is  too  warm  can
kill corals: They cannot survive for long when the water temperature exceeds
30°C (86°F). That s  why warmer-than-normal  sea  surface temperatures
such
as those experienced during severe El Niños or other warming episodes
tend
to  stress  corals  and  are  linked  to  outbreaks  of  coral  bleaching  and  other
diseases (Box 15.1).

Water  warm  enough  to  support  coral  growth  is  found  primarily  within  the
tropics. Reefs also grow as far north and south as 35 degrees latitude on the west-
ern margins of ocean basins, however, where warm-water currents raise average
sea surface temperatures (Figure 15.17).

The  map  in  Figure  15.17 also  shows  the  greater  diversity  of  reef-building
corals on the western side of ocean basins. More than 50 genera of corals thrive in
a broad area of the western Pacific Ocean and a narrow belt of the western Indian
Ocean. Fewer  than  30  genera, however, occur  in  the  Atlantic  Ocean, with  the
greatest  diversity  occurring  in  the  Caribbean  Sea. This  pattern  is  related  to  the
positions  of  the  continents  prior  to  about  30  million  years  ago, when  the  warm
equatorial Tethys Sea connected the world s tropical oceans and provided a high-
way for the worldwide distribution of coral species and reef-associated organisms.
With time, tectonic changes in landmass position closed the Tethys Sea and were
accompanied by changes in ocean currents and climate, which reduced coral reef
biodiversity in areas such as the Atlantic. Further, the presence of numerous trop-
ical islands in the western Pacific provides a variety of habitats that favors coral
speciation.

Ive heard about the recent discovery of deep-water
corals. How are they different from shallow-water
corals?

Although  coral  reefs  are  generally  associated  with
shallow  tropical  seas,  recent  deep-ocean  exploration
using  advanced  acoustics  and  submersibles  has 
revealed  unexpectedly  widespread  and  diverse  coral
ecosystems  in  deep,  cold  waters.  These  corals  are
found below sunlit surface waters at a record depth
of  6,328  meters  (20,800  feet) on  continental
shelves,  continental  slopes,  seamounts,  and  mid-
ocean  ridge  systems  around  the  world.  Since  the
corals  don t  live  in  particularly  deep  water,  the  term
cold-water coral is  more  appropriate.  They  lack  the
symbiotic zooxanthellae algae that their shallow-water
cousins have but can be brightly colored and use their
stinging tentacles to capture tiny plankton or detritus
concentrated  by  ocean  currents.  They  build  their
skeletons  of  calcium  carbonate  as  shallow  corals  do
and create large reef structures or coral mounds that
provide  a  habitat  for  many  other  species.  Some
species  of  deep-water  coral  may  be  thousands  of
years old. What is remarkable about them is that they
have remained unnoticed for so long. New cold-water
coral species, in fact, have recently been discovered in
waters off highly populated Southern California!

HOW WHITE I AM: CORAL BLEACHING AND OTHER DISEASES

Coral  bleaching describes  the loss  of  color
in corals that causes them to turn white as if
bleach  has  been  poured  on  the  reef  (Fig-
ure 15A). Coral  bleaching  often  occurs  in
response  to  elevated  water  temperatures
and  causes  the  coral s  colorful  symbiotic
partner
zooxanthellae algae to be killed
outright, leave, or  become  toxic  to  their
hosts, in which case they are expelled. Once
bleached, the coral no longer receives nour-
ishment from the algae, and if the coral does
not regain its symbiotic algae within a mat-
ter  of  weeks  it  will  die. Bleaching  often
occurs  in  surface  waters
the  top  2  to 
3 meters (7 to 10 feet) but has also been
observed at depths of 30 meters (100 feet)
and can occur as quickly as overnight.

Florida s  coral  reefs  have  experienced
at  least  eight  widespread  bleachings  since
the  early  1900s, and  at  least  70%  of  the
corals  along  the  Pacific  Central  American
coast died due to bleaching associated with

the severe El Niño event of 1982 1983. For
example, coral reefs around the Galápagos
Islands  thrive  in  ocean  water  at  or  below
27°C  (81°F). If  the  water  is  even  1  or  2°C
(2 or 4°F) warmer for an extended period,
however, the  coral  may  expel  the  algae,
in effect  bleaching itself. The  warming
during  the  1982 1983  El  Niño  was  so
severe and  long-lived  that  two  species  of
Panamanian  coral  became  extinct. The
bleaching  episode  of  1987  affected  coral
reefs worldwide, especially those in Florida
and throughout the Caribbean. Since then,
widespread  bleachings  have  occurred  with
increasing  frequency  and  intensity. For  in-
stance, the  El  Niño  event  of  1997 1998
raised  water  temperatures  several  degrees
higher  than  normal  and  has  been  blamed
for  the  most  geographically  widespread
bleaching 
including
the equatorial  eastern  Pacific  Ocean, the
Yucatán  coast, the  Florida  Keys, and  the

water  temperatures  (such  as  El  Niño
events), the algae may leave their hosts or
be  expelled  due  to  elevated  ultraviolet
radiation  levels, a  decrease  in  sunlight-
blocking particles high in the atmosphere,
pollution, salinity changes, invasion of dis-
ease, or  a  combination  of  factors. Some
researchers  suggest  that  reactive  oxygen
builds up in the coral s tissues and becomes
toxic  when  temperatures  are  excessively
warm. Then the algae are expelled or, per-
haps, the algae leave with dead tissue. The
strong  correlation  between  coral  bleach-
ing  and  elevated  water 
temperature
concerns  marine  scientists  because  sea
surface temperatures are becoming warmer
as  a  result  of  human-induced  climate
change. Whatever the cause, coral bleach-
ing  indicates  that  corals  are  experiencing
severe environmental stress.

James Porter, a coral reef ecologist at
the  University  of  Georgia, and  his  col-
leagues  study  diseases  that  affect  corals.
They have been monitoring the health of
corals in the Florida Keys since 1995 and
have  discovered  the  reappearance  of
white  plague  disease as  well  as  a  dozen
new  diseases, such  as  white  band  disease,
white pox, black band disease, yellow band
(yellow  blotch)  disease, patchy  necrosis,
and rapid wasting disease.

The cause of most of these diseases is
still  being  investigated, and  it  is  not
known  if  the  new  diseases  are  from  the
invasion  of  microorganisms bacteria,
viruses, or  fungi or  related  to  environ-
mental  stress  as  coral  bleaching  is. As
human population has increased along the
Florida  Keys, the  coral  reefs  of  the  Keys
have  begun  to  show  signs  of  stress, thus
making them more susceptible to a host of
diseases. The increased nutrient levels and
water  turbidity  resulting  from  soil  runoff
and improper sewage disposal in the Keys
may contribute to the problem, too.

Besides  warm  water, other  environmental  conditions  necessary  for  coral

growth include the following:

Strong sunlight (not for the corals themselves, which are animals and can exist
in deeper water, but for the symbiotic photosynthetic microscopic dinoflagel-
late algae called zooxanthellae that live within the coral s tissues4).
Strong wave or current action (to bring nutrients and oxygen).
Lack  of  turbidity  (suspended  particles  in  the  water  tend  to  absorb  radiant
energy, interfere  with  the  coral s  filter-feeding  capability, and  can  even  bury
corals, so corals are not usually found close to areas where major rivers drain
into the sea).
Salt  water  (corals  die  if  the  water  is  too  fresh, which  is  another reason  coral
reefs do not form near the mouths of freshwater rivers).
A hard substrate for attachment (corals cannot attach to a muddy bottom, so
they often build upon the hard skeletons of their ancestors, creating coral reefs
that are several kilometers thick).

Coral  reefs are  more  than  just  coral.

continual supply of food, and the corals provide the zooxanthellae with nutrients.
Although coral polyps capture tiny planktonic food with their stinging tentacles,
most  reef-building  corals  receive  up  to  90%  of  their  nutrition  from  symbiotic
zooxanthellae  algae. In  this  way, corals  are  able  to  survive  in  the  nutrient-poor

Other reef animals also have a symbiotic relationship with various types  of

foraminifers, sponges, and mollusks (Figure 15.18). The algae not only nourish the

FIGURE 15.19 Coral reef zonation. Coral reefs exhibit
zonation because of the decrease in both wave energy and
sunlight intensity with increasing ocean depth. As a result,
massive branching corals occur above 20 meters (66 feet),
where wave energy is great; corals become more delicate 
with increasing depth, until a depth of around 150 meters
(500 feet), where too little solar radiation is available to 
allow the survival of their symbiotic zooxanthellae algae.

FIGURE 15.20 Non-reef-building inhabitants.
(a) Coral reefs supply habitat and protection for many
fishes, including this Guineafowl (spotted) puffer (Arothron
meleagris). Puffers usually aren t quick enough to escape a
predator, but they can expand their bodies into a large,
spherical, spiny ball that is not easily eaten. (b) Unlike
reef-building corals, some corals do not secrete a hard
calcium carbonate structure, such as this soft gorgonian
coral (Nicella schmitti), which has feeding polyps (light
purple) extending from its branches. Each polyp is about 
1 centimeter (0.4 inch) across.

CORAL  REEF  ZONATION On
many large coral reefs, there is
a  well-developed  vertical  and
horizontal zonation of the reef
slope  (Figure  15.19), which  is
caused  by  changes  in  sunlight,
wave  energy,
salinity, water
depth, temperature, and  other
factors. These zones can readily
be  identified  by  the  types  of
coral present and the assemblages of other organisms found in and near the reef.
Because algae need sunlight for photosynthesis, the greatest depth to which
active coral growth can occur is about 150 meters (500 feet). Water motion is less
at these depths, so relatively delicate plate corals can live on the outer slope of the
reef  from  150  meters  (500  feet)  up  to  about  50  meters  (165  feet), where  light
intensity is as low as 4% of the surface intensity (Figure 15.19).

From 50 meters (164 feet) to about 20 meters (66 feet), water motion from
breaking waves increases on the side of the reef facing into the prevailing current
flow. Correspondingly, the  mass  of
coral  growth  and  the  strength  of
the coral structure supporting it in-
crease toward the top of this zone,
where  light  intensity  is  as  low  as
20% of the surface value.

The reef flat may have a water
depth of a few centimeters to a few
meters at low tide, so it has at least
60%  of  the  surface  light  intensity.
Many  species  of  colorful  reef  fish
inhabit  this  shallow  water, as  well
as sea cucumbers, worms, and mol-
lusks. In the protected water of the
reef  lagoon  live  gorgonian  coral,
anemones, crustaceans, mollusks,
and echinoderms (Figure 15.20).

than  half  a  percent  of  the  ocean s  surface  area, they  are  home  to  25%  of  all
marine species, including almost a third of the world s estimated 20,000 species of
marine fish. Coral reefs provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds that attract
numerous other species including sea anemones, sea stars, crabs, sea slugs, clams,
sponges, sea  turtles, marine  mammals, and  sharks. In  fact, coral  reefs  foster  a
diversity of species that surpasses even that of tropical rain forests, making coral
reefs the most diverse communities in the marine environment.

Coral reefs provide many benefits to people. Some 100 million people world-
wide  depend  upon  healthy  reef  systems, which  provide  a  multi-billion-dollar
tourist  industry. In  fact, many  tropical  countries  that  have  coral  reefs  receive
more  than  50%  of  their  gross  national  product  as  tourism  related  to  reefs.
Fisheries associated with reefs supply more than one-sixth of all fish from the sea.
Recently, pharmacologists and marine chemists have discovered a storehouse of
new medical compounds from coral reef inhabitants that fight maladies such as
cancer  and  infections. In  addition, reefs  help  prevent  shoreline  erosion  and
protect  coastal  communities  from  storm  waves  and  tsunami. The  hard  calcium
carbonate skeletons of coral have even been used in some human bone grafts.

CORAL REEFS AND NUTRIENT LEVELS When human populations increase on
land  adjacent  to  coral  reefs, the  reefs  deteriorate. Fishing, trampling, boat
collisions  with  the  reef, sediment  increase  due  to  development, and  removal  of
reef inhabitants by visitors all damage the reef. One of the more subtle effects is
the  inevitable  increase  in  the  nutrient  levels  of  the  reef  waters  from  sewage
discharge and farm fertilizers.

As nutrient levels increase in reef waters, the dominant benthic community

changes in the following ways:

At low nutrient levels, hermatypic corals and other reef animals that contain
algal symbiotic partners thrive.
Moderate nutrient levels favor fleshy benthic plants and algae, and high nutri-
ent levels favor suspension feeders such as clams.
At high nutrient levels, the phytoplankton mass exceeds the benthic algal mass,
so benthic populations tied to the phytoplankton food web dominate.

Increased phytoplankton biomass reduces the clarity of the water, too, which
interferes with the coral s filter-feeding capability. The fast-growing members of
the  phytoplankton-based  ecosystem  destroy  the  reef  structure  by  overgrowing
the  slow-growing  coral  and  through  bioerosion, which  is  erosion  of  the  reef  by
organisms. Bioerosion  by  sea  urchins  and  sponges  is  particularly  damaging  to
many coral reefs.

THE  CROWN-OF-THORNS  PHENOMENON The  crown-of-thorns  (Acanthaster
planci)  is  a  sea  star  (Figure  15.21)  that  has  greatly  proliferated  and  destroyed
living coral on many reefs throughout the western Pacific Ocean since 1962 and
more recently in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The sea star moves across reefs
and  eats  the  coral  polyps, devouring  as  much  as  13  square  meters  (140  square
feet) of coral in a single year. Normally, however, the coral can grow back if it has
enough time to do so.

Though  a  natural  part  of  reef  ecosystems, the  sea  stars  can  cause  extensive
damage  because, for  reasons  not  fully  understood, a  small  group  can  suddenly
multiply to millions. For example, vast numbers of crown-of-thorns sea stars have
recently  decimated  many  coral  communities, particularly  on  the  Great  Barrier
Reef. Initially, divers were employed to smash the crown-of-thorns, but sea stars
(which have tremendous regenerating capabilities) can easily produce new indi-
viduals from various body parts, so it only made the problem worse.

Some investigators suggest the proliferation of the crown-of-thorns sea star is
a modern phenomenon brought about by the activities of humans, although there

it with food, and give the coral its color.

is  little  supporting  evidence. There  is, however, speculation  that  the  crown-of-
thorns sea star has multiplied because large reef fish that prey on them have been
removed by overfishing. Other studies show that during the last 80,000 years, the
crown-of-thorns sea star has been even more abundant than it is today. Thus, the
sea  star  may  be  an  integral  part  of  the  reef  ecology  in  this  region, and  their
increase may be part of a long-term natural cycle rather than a destructive event
triggered by human actions.

CORAL  REEFS  IN  DECLINE Studies  concerning  the  health  of  coral  reefs
worldwide  show  that  they  are  in  rapid  decline  due  to  various  human  and
environmental  factors. A  recent  survey  of  coral  reef  ecosystems, for  example,
shows  that  only  30%  are  healthy  now, down  from  41%  in  2000. Another  study
estimated that more than  one-third of  the  major reef-building coral species  are
currently  at  high  risk  of  extinction, with  severe  consequences  for  entire  reef
ecosystems. In the Caribbean, the area of sea floor covered by live hard coral has
decreased 80% in the past 30 years. Even the Great Barrier Reef, widely regarded
as one of the world s most pristine coral reefs, has lost over half of its coral cover
during the past 40 years.

The  most  serious  threat  to  coral  reefs overshadowing  natural  cataclysms
such as hurricanes, floods, and tsunami
is human activity. Overfishing, for exam-
ple, has depleted the populations of many of the fishes that graze on algae and
keep  it  from  smothering  the  reefs. Runoff  laden  with  sediment  and  pollutants
further fuels the growth of algae and spreads harmful bacteria. Even more threat-
ening  to  coral  reefs  are  increased  levels  of  human-caused  atmospheric  carbon
dioxide, which is absorbed into the ocean and increases ocean acidity, making it
more difficult for corals to create their calcium carbonate skeletons.6 In addition,
global warming as a result of human activities has been shown to have increased
ocean  surface  temperatures, affecting  temperature-sensitive  corals  worldwide
and making them more prone to disease and bleaching episodes (see Box 15.1).
And, the predicted rise in sea level as a result of global warming may wreak havoc
on corals by submerging them more deeply, in effect reducing the amount of sun-
light they receive. The future for healthy coral reefs looks bleak unless immediate
and dramatic conservation measures are enacted to preserve them.

15.5 What Communities Exist on the

Deep-Ocean Floor?

The vast majority of the ocean floor lies submerged below several kilometers of
water. Less  is  known  about  life  in  the  deep  ocean  than  about  life  in  any  of  the
shallower nearshore environments because it is difficult and expensive to investi-
gate  the  deep  sea. Just  to  obtain  samples  from  the  deep-ocean  floor  requires  a
specially designed submersible or a properly equipped research vessel that has a
spool of high-strength cable at least 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) long. In the past, the
inaccessibility of ocean depths fueled much debate about the existence of life in
the deep ocean (see Web Box 15.1).

Even today, collecting samples by submersible or with a biological dredge is a
time-consuming  process. Because  the  supply  of  oxygen  is  limited, manned  sub-
mersibles  can  stay  down  for  only  12  hours, and  it  may  take  8  of  those  hours  to
descend and ascend. To send a dredge to the deep-ocean floor and retrieve it from
the depths takes about 24 hours.

Robotics  and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are making  it possible  to
observe and sample even the deepest reaches of the ocean more easily. Because

they are unmanned, ROVs are cheaper to operate and can stay beneath the sur-
face for months if necessary. These developments should lead to further discover-
ies in one of Earth s least known habitats.

The Physical Environment
The deep-ocean floor includes bathyal, abyssal, and hadal zones.7 Here, the physi-
cal environment is much different than at the surface; it is quite stable and uni-
form. Light is present in only the lowest concentrations down to a maximum of
1000 meters (3300 feet) and absent below this depth. Everywhere the tempera-
(28.8°F) in the high lati-
ture rarely exceeds 3°C (37°F) and falls as low as 
- 1.8°C
.8 Oxygen  content  is  constant
tudes. Salinity  remains  at  slightly  less  than  35
and relatively  high. Pressure  exceeds  200  kilograms  per  square  centimeter
(200 atmospheres, or 2940 pounds per square inch) on the oceanic ridges, exceeds
300 to 500 kilograms per square centimeter (300 to 500 atmospheres, or 4410 to
7350 pounds per square inch) on the deep-ocean abyssal plains, and exceeds 1000
kilograms per square centimeter (1000 atmospheres, or 14,700 pounds per square
inch) in the deepest trenches.9 Bottom currents are generally slow but more vari-
able than once believed. For example, abyssal storms created by warm- and cold-
core  eddies  of  surface  currents  affect  certain  areas, lasting  several  weeks  and
causing bottom currents to reverse and/or increase in speed.

A  thin  layer  of  sediment  covers  much  of  the  deep-ocean  floor. On  abyssal
plains  and  in  deep  trenches, sediment  is  composed  of  mudlike  abyssal  clay
deposits. The  accumulation  of  oozes
composed  of  dead  planktonic  organisms
that have sunk through the water column occurs on the flanks of oceanic ridges
and  rises. On  the  continental  rise, there  may  be  some  coarse  sediment  from
nearby land  sources. Sediment  may  be  absent on steep areas  of  the continental
slope. It may also be absent near the crest of the mid-ocean ridge and along the
slopes  of  seamounts  and  oceanic  islands, where  it  had  not  had  enough  time  to
accumulate on newly formed ocean floor.

Food Sources and Species
Diversity
Because  of  the  lack  of  light, photosynthetic
primary production cannot occur. Except for
the chemosynthetic productivity that occurs
around  hydrothermal  vents, all  benthic  or-
ganisms receive their food from the surface
waters  above. Only  about  1  to  3%  of  the
food produced in the euphotic (sunlit) zone
reaches the deep-ocean floor, so the scarcity
of food that drifts down from the sunlit sur-
face  waters not  low  temperature  or  high
pressure limits  deep-sea  benthic  biomass.
However, some  variability  in  the  supply  of
food  is  caused  by  seasonal  phytoplankton
blooms at the surface. Figure 15.22 shows the
food sources for deep-sea organisms.

Most deep-sea organisms obtain their food from surface
water after it slowly settles through the water column to the

HOW LONG WOULD YOUR REMAINS REMAIN ON THE SEA FLOOR?

What  happens  to  people  who  are  buried
at sea? How long do their remains remain
on  the  sea  floor?  How  long  do  the
remains  of  a  large  organism  such  as  a
whale  remain  on 
the  sea  bottom?
Oceanographers who study deep-sea bio-
communities  have  conducted  experi-
ments  in  the  deep  sea  to  help  answer
these questions.

One experiment was conducted along
the sea floor in the Philippine Trench, at a
depth  of  9600  meters  (31,500  feet),
in
1975. Several  whole  fish  were  placed  on
the  sea  floor, and  an  underwater  camera
positioned  above  them  took  a  picture
every  few  minutes  to  observe  how  long
the  bait  remained  there  (Figure  15B).
Hirondellea  gigas, a  scavenging  benthic
shrimplike amphipod, discovered the bait
after  only  a  few  hours. The  bait  was
swarming  with  amphipods  after  9  hours,
and  it  was  stripped  of  flesh  in  16  hours!
Other studies obtained similar results, sug-
gesting that organisms the size of humans
would  have  their  soft  tissue  devoured
within a day on the deep-ocean floor.

For  deep-sea  organisms, large  food
falls represent an unpredictable but intense
nutrient  supply, instantaneously  deposit-
ing as much food as would be delivered to
the deep sea by the normal rain of detritus

in about 2000 years. Deep-sea scav-
engers  such  as  amphipods, hagfish,
and  sleeper  sharks  use  special
chemoreceptive  sensory  devices  to
identify and quickly locate food on
the  sea  floor. In  addition, whale
carcasses  can  support  a  thriving
ecosystem  of  benthic  organisms
including some species normally as-

To  test  how  long  a  whale s
remains  lasted  on  the  sea  floor,
researchers  used  two  dead  juvenile
gray  whales  that  washed  up  on  the
beach in Southern California in 1996
and 1997. With permission from the
National  Marine  Fisheries  Service,
the  5000-kilogram  (5.5-ton)  whales
were 
intentionally  weighted  and
sunk  in  the  San  Diego  Trough.
Researchers  in  a  deep-diving  sub-
mersible visited the carcasses at reg-
ular  intervals  and  found  that  the
gray  whales  were 
completely
stripped  of  flesh  in  four  months!
Other studies indicate that even blue
whales, which  can  weigh  25  times
more than a gray whale, are stripped
of their flesh in as little as six months.

remains on the deep-ocean floor.

Many of the organisms that inhabit the deep sea have special adaptations to
help them detect food using chemical clues. Once food is found, these organisms
are efficient at consuming it (Box 15.2).

For many years, it was believed that the species diversity of the deep-ocean
floor  was  quite  low  compared  with  shallow-water  communities. Researchers
studying  sediment-dwelling  animals  in  the  North Atlantic, however, discovered
an  unexpectedly  large  diversity  of  species. An  area  of  21  square  meters
(225 square feet) contained 898 species, of which 460 were new to science. After
analyzing 200 samples, new species were being discovered at a rate that suggested
millions of deep-sea species!

It  turns  out  that  deep-sea  species  diversity

especially  for  small  infaunal
deposit feeders
rivals tropical rain forests. It also appears, however, that the dis-
tribution of deep-sea life is patchy and depends to a large degree on the presence
of certain microenvironments.

The deep-ocean floor is a stable environment 
of darkness, cold water, and high pressure but 
still supports life. The food source for most 
deep-sea organisms is from sunlit surface waters.

Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent
Biocommunities: Organisms 
and Their Adaptations
The  surprising  discovery  of  deep-sea  hydrothermal
(hydro
 heat) vents and their bio-
communities  has  been  one  of  the  most  important
finds in the modern history of ocean discovery. Life at
hydrothermal vents may in fact provide insights into
both the origin of life on Earth and its possible exis-
tence elsewhere in the solar system.

VENT
BIOCOMMUNITIES An  active  hydrothermal  vent
field on the ocean floor was visited for the first time
in  1977  during  a  dive  of  the  submersible  Alvin. The
field exists in complete darkness in water below 2500
meters  (8200  feet)  in  the  Galápagos  Rift, near  the
equator  in  the  eastern  Pacific  Ocean  (Figures  15.23
and  15.24). Hot  water  was  observed  spewing  from
cracks in the sea floor and from tall chimneys. Water
temperature  near  the  vents  was  8  to  12°C  (46  to
54°F), whereas  normal  water  temperature  at  these
depths is about 2°C (36°F).

organisms that were unknown to science and unusually

1.8  meters  (6  feet)  long  (Figure  15.25a), clams  as  large  as  25  centimeters
(10 inches)  across, large  mussels, two  varieties  of  white  crabs, and  extensive
microbial  mats. These  biocommunities  had  up  to  1000  times  more  biomass  than
the rest of the deep-ocean floor. In a region of scarce nutrients and small popula-
tions of organisms, these hydrothermal vents are truly the oases of the deep ocean.

sea anemone (Marianactis bythios); the gastropod Alviniconcha hessleri, which is the first known
conch to contain chemosynthetic bacteria; and the galatheid crab (Munidopsis marianica).

In 1979, south of the tip of Baja California at 21 degrees north latitude on the
East  Pacific  Rise, tall  underwater  chimneys  were  discovered  belching  hot  vent
water (350°C or 662°F) so rich in metal sulfides that it colored the water black.
These  chimney  vents, which  are  composed  primarily  of  sulfides  of  copper, zinc,
and silver, came to be called black smokers because of their resemblance to fac-
tory smokestacks.

A typical hydrothermal vent may emit fluids that are not only hot (upwards
3 4) and  extremely  toxic, with  high
of  350°C  or  662°F), but  also  acidic  (pH 
concentrations of dissolved hydrogen sulfide and heavy metals such as cadmium,
arsenic, and lead. Yet the dark water venting from black smokers has been found
to be rich in microbes.

CHEMOSYNTHESIS The most important members of these hydrothermal vent
biocommunities are microscopic archaea (archaeo  ancient), which are primitive
single-celled  organisms  that  resemble  bacteria  but  have  chemical  similarities  to
multicelled  organisms. Archaea  thrive  on  sea  floor  chemicals most  notably
hydrogen sulfide
and perform chemosynthesis (chemo  chemistry, syn  with,
 an arranging), manufacturing carbohydrates (sugar) from water, carbon
thesis
dioxide, and  dissolved  oxygen; sulfuric  acid  is  produced  as  a  byproduct  (Fig-
ure 15.26). By chemosynthesizing, archaea form the base of the food web for vent
ecosystems. Although  some  animals  feed  directly  on  archaea  and  larger  prey,

many  of  them  depend  primarily  on  a  symbiotic  relationship  with  archaea.
Tubeworms  and  giant  clams, for  instance, depend  entirely  on  sulfur-oxidizing
archaea that live symbiotically within their tissues (Figure 15.25b). The microbes
inside the tubeworms are provided habitat and bathed in hydrogen sulfide, which
they chemosynthesize into sugars. The tubeworms, in return, get a steady supply of
food and grow prolifically, sometimes gaining 80 centimeters (31 inches) in a year.
Recent analysis of the genome of the symbiotic archaea that lives inside tube-
worms reveals that the microbe is remarkably versatile. For example, researchers
found that it can use two different methods to metabolize carbon dioxide and can
switch  back  and  forth  to  accommodate fast-changing  environmental  conditions.
Such metabolic flexibility is a valuable asset in deep-sea vent habitats character-
ized by fluctuating flows of hot fluids.

DISCOVERY  OF  OTHER  HYDROTHERMAL  VENT  FIELDS In 1981, humans in a
submersible  first  visited  the  Juan  de  Fuca  Ridge  biocommunity  offshore  of
Oregon. Although vent fauna at this site are less abundant than at the Galápagos
Rift  and  on  the  East  Pacific  Rise, the  metallic  sulfide  deposits  from  the  vents
aroused  much  interest  because  they  are  the  only  active  hydrothermal  vent
deposits in U.S. waters.

In  1982, the  first  hydrothermal  vents  beneath  a thick layer  of  sediment  were
discovered  during  a  submersible  dive  in  the  Guaymas  Basin  of  the  Gulf  of
California. In this region, a spreading center is actively working to rift apart the sea
floor  as  it  is  being  covered  with  sediment. Sediment  samples  recovered  in  this
region  were  high  in  sulfide  and  saturated  with  hydrocarbons, which  may  have
entered the food chain through bacteria.The abundance and diversity of life discov-
ered here may exceed those of the Galápagos Rift and along the East Pacific Rise.
Like  the  Guaymas  Basin, the  Mariana  Basin  of  the  western  Pacific  has  a
small spreading center beneath a sediment-filled basin. A research dive via sub-
mersible  in  1987  revealed  many  new  species  of  hydrothermal  vent  organisms
(Figure  15.25c). Subsequent  exploration  has  revealed  numerous  hydrothermal
vent biocommunities in other parts of the Pacific Ocean (see Figure 15.24) and
additional new species. In fact, more than 400 new species have been found so far
at vent sites worldwide.

In 1985, the first active hydrothermal vents with associated biocommunities
in the Atlantic Ocean were discovered at depths below 3600 meters (11,800 feet)
near the axis of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between 23 and 26 degrees north latitude.
The  predominant  fauna  of  these  vents  consists  of  shrimp  that  have  no  eye  lens
but can detect levels of light emitted by the black smoker chimneys that are invis-
ible to the human eye (Figure 15.27).

In 1993, a hydrothermal vent community was discovered on a flat-topped vol-
cano rising to 1525 meters (5000 feet) well above the walls of the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge  rift  valley. Called  the  Lucky  Strike vent  field, it  is  about  1000  meters
(3300 feet) shallower than most other sites. It is the only Mid-Atlantic Ridge site
known to possess the mussels that are common at many other vent sites and is the
only location where a new species of pink sea urchin has been found.

In  August  2000, Japanese  investigators  discovered  the  Indian  Ocean s  first
hydrothermal vent biocommunity, which is associated with black smokers spewing

Are the mussels found at hydrothermal vents edible?

Not for humans. The microbes that form the base of
the food web use  hydrogen  sulfide  gas (which has a
characteristic  rotten  egg   odor)  as  a  source  of 
energy. Sulfide, which is deadly poisonous at low levels
to  most  organisms,  tends  to  concentrate  in  the  tis-
sues  of  these  organisms.  Although  organisms  within
the  hydrothermal  biocommunities  can  ingest  sulfide
and  have  mechanisms  of  getting  rid  of  it,  hydrother-
mal vent organisms would be toxic to humans. Even if
they were edible, they would be expensive to harvest
because they live at such great depths.

water  up  to  365°C  (689°F). The  vents  are  covered  by  shrimp  similar  to  those
found  in  Atlantic  fields, while  sea  anemones  mark  the  ambient  temperature
boundaries beyond. In between are clusters of animals similar to those found at
other hydrothermal vents.

Vents  often  differ  dramatically  from  each  other  in  chemical  and  geological
characteristics. However, even vents that are physically similar can host distinctly
different  communities  of  organisms. For  example, giant  tubeworms  are  found
only in Pacific vents. In the North Atlantic, meanwhile, shrimp and mussels domi-
nate. Researchers are currently studying dispersal patterns and determining bio-
geographic relationships between vent sites to help explain this phenomenon.

Today, researchers continue to use submersibles to study deep-sea hydrother-
mal  vents. Although  there  is  direct  evidence  of  about  300  hydrothermal  vents
worldwide, researchers suspect that another 700 or so await discovery. Every visit
to  a  vent  site even  a  repeat  visit
reveals  new  information  about  how  vents
work and the uniquely-adapted microbes and other organisms that live there. In
fact, the research effort is so intense at some sites that researchers have recently
adopted a self-enforced code of conduct to ensure that humans do not alter vent
ecosystems.

LIFE  SPAN  OF  HYDROTHERMAL  VENTS Because  the  hot-water  plumbing  of
the sea floor is controlled by sporadic volcanic activity associated with mid-ocean
ridge spreading centers, a vent may remain active for only limited periods
years
or sometimes decades. For instance, a hydrothermal vent field called the Coaxial
Site along the Juan de Fuca Ridge offshore of Washington that had been active
was revisited a few years later and found to be inactive. Inactive sites such as this
one  are  identified  by  an  accumulation  of  large  numbers  of  dead  hydrothermal
vent  organisms. When  the  vent  becomes  inactive  and  the  hydrogen  sulfide  that
serves as the source of energy for the community is no longer available, organisms
of the community die if they cannot move elsewhere.

Other  sites  indicate  an  increase  in  volcanic  activity. For  example, at  a  site
along  the  East  Pacific  Rise  known  as  Nine-Degrees  North, a  large  number  of
tubeworms  were  cooked  by  lava  flowing  into  their  midst  in  what  has  been
described as a  tubeworm barbecue. The discovery of newly formed and ancient
vent  areas  along  spreading  centers  indicates  that  hydrothermal  vents  can  sud-
denly appear or cease to operate. Moreover, areas of active venting may lie hun-
dreds of kilometers apart.

Hydrothermal  vent  organisms  are  well  adapted  to  the  temporary  nature  of
hydrothermal  vents. Most  have  high  metabolic  rates, for  example, which  cause
them to mature rapidly so they can reproduce while the vent is still active.

Studies  of  several  hydrothermal  vent  sites  suggest  that  species  diversity  is
low. In  fact, only  about  300  animal  species  have  been  identified  to  date. Many
species, however, are  common  to  widely  separated  hydrothermal  vent  fields.
Although  hydrothermal  vent  animals  typically  release  drifting  larvae  into  the
water, it is not clear how the larvae are able to survive the journey to hydrother-
mal vents that lie at such great distances from one another.

One idea, called the dead whale hypothesis, suggests that when large animals
die  they  may  sink  to  the  deep-ocean  floor, decompose, and  provide  an  energy
source in stepping stone fashion for the larvae of hydrothermal vent organisms.
The  organisms  settle  and  grow  here, then  breed  and  release  their  own  larvae,
some  of  which  make  it  to  the  next  hydrothermal  vent  field. Other  researchers
believe that deep-ocean currents are strong enough to transport drifting larvae to
new sites. Still others have suggested that the rift valleys of mid-ocean ridges act
as passageways along which drifting larvae traverse to inhabit new vent fields. By
whatever means they travel, they colonize new hydrothermal vents soon after the
vents are created. In 1989, for example, a newly formed hydrothermal vent along
the  Juan  de  Fuca  Ridge  had  no  life  forms. By  1993, however, tubeworms  and
other life forms had already established themselves.

HYDROTHERMAL  VENTS  AND  THE  ORIGIN  OF  LIFE Life  is  thought  to  have
begun in the oceans, and environments similar to those of the hydrothermal vents
must  have  been  present  in  the  early  history  of  the  planet. The  uniformity  of
conditions and abundant energy of the vents, therefore, have led some scientists
to propose that hydrothermal vents would have provided an ideal habitat for the
origin  of  life. In  fact, hydrothermal  vents  may  represent  one  of  the  oldest  life-
sustaining  environments  because  hydrothermal  activity  occurs  wherever  there
are both volcanoes and water. The presence of bacteria-like archaea, which have
ancient genetic makeup, helps support this idea.

The ancient status of deep-sea life was strengthened by the recent discovery of
deep-sea microbes with identical genes to those of microbes found in the human
body. Researchers isolated two previously unknown bacterial
species from hydrothermal vents near Japan and compared the
new  species   genomes  to  the  genomes  of  two  common  gut
pathogens, one that causes ulcers and another that causes diar-
rhea. The comparison shows that despite eons of evolutionary
change, the  deep-sea  species  and  the  pathogens  share  genes
that  enable  them  to  colonize  animal  hosts. According  to  the
researchers, genes that likely help deep-sea bacteria maintain
symbiotic  relationships  with  other  vent-dwelling  organisms
assist their gut-dwelling relatives in evading immune systems.
The  researchers  suggest  that  the  human-harming  microbes
evolved from deep-sea ancestors and later acquired more viru-
lence factors while living in symbiosis with animals.

HYPERSALINE  SEEPS In  1984, a  hypersaline  seep  was
studied in water depths below 3000 meters (9800 feet) at the
base  of  the  Florida  Escarpment  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  (Fig-
ure 15.28a). The water from this seep had a salinity of 46.2
,
but its temperature was not warmer than normal. Researchers
had  discovered  a  hypersaline  seep  biocommunity similar  in
many  respects  to  a  hydrothermal  vent  biocommunity. The
seeping  water  appears  to  flow  from  fractures  at  the  base  of
a limestone escarpment (Figure 15.28b) and move out across
the  clay  deposits  of  the  abyssal  plain  at  a  depth  of  about
3200 meters (10,500 feet).

The  hydrogen  sulfide-rich  waters  support  a  number  of
white  microbial  growths  called  mats, which  conduct
chemosynthesis in a fashion similar to archaea at hydrother-
mal vents. These and other chemosynthetic microbes may pro-
vide  most of the sustenance for a  diverse community of ani-
mals that includes sea stars, shrimp, snails, limpets, brittle stars,
anemones, tubeworms, crabs, clams, mussels, and a few species
of fish (Figure 15.28c).

at  the  hypersaline  seep  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico. Subsequent  investigations  have
identified  nearly  100  seeps  on 
the  continental  slope  with  potential
chemosynthetic biocommunities; 10 of these have been visited with submersibles
to depths of 2775 meters (9100 feet) where chemosynthetic bacteria and a host of
other organisms were discovered.

Carbon-isotope analysis indicates that these hydrocarbon seep biocommuni-
ties are  based  on  chemosynthesis  that  derives  its  energy  from  hydrogen  sulfide
and/or  methane. Microbial  oxidation  of  methane  produces  calcium  carbonate
slabs found here and at other hydrocarbon seeps (see Figure 15.24).

SUBDUCTION ZONE SEEPS In 1984, a subduction zone seep biocommunity was
discovered  during  one  of  Alvin s  dives  to  study  folding  of  the  sea  floor  in  a
subduction  zone. The  seep  is  located  near  the  Cascadia  subduction  zone  of  the
Juan de Fuca Plate at the base of the continental slope off the coast of Oregon
(Figure 15.30a). The trench is filled with sediments, which are folded into a ridge
at the seaward edge of the slope. At the crest of this ridge, water slowly flows from
the 2-million-year-old folded sedimentary rocks into a thin overlying layer of soft

sediment  on  the  sea  floor. Eventually, the  water  is  released  from  the  sediment
through seeps on the ocean floor.

At a depth of 2036 meters (6678 feet), the seeps produce water that is only
about 0.3°C (0.5°F) warmer than seawater at that depth. The vent water contains
methane that is probably produced by decomposition of organic material in the
sedimentary rocks. Microbes oxidize the methane, chemosynthetically producing
food for themselves and the rest of the community, which contains many of the
same genera found at other vent and seep sites (Figure 15.30b).

Since the detection of subduction zone seeps, similar communities have been

discovered in other subduction zones, including the Japan Trench and the Peru
Chile Trench. All these subduction zone seeps are located on the landward side of
the trenches at depths from 1300 to 5640 meters (4300 to 18,500 feet).

The Deep Biosphere: A New Frontier
The discovery of the rich microbe communities at hydrothermal vents has resulted in
the exploration of the deep biosphere, an environment that exists within the sea floor
itself. Only  recently  have  scientists  even  considered  that  microbial  life  might  exist
deep within Earth, and in 2002 researchers made the first expedition to study life in
this environment. Cores were drilled up to 420 meters (1380 feet) deep into the sea
floor off Peru in water depths between 150 and 5300 meters (490 and 17,400 feet). At
these depths, researchers discovered a host of diverse and active microbial communi-
ties living within circulating fluids that pass through the porous sea floor. Other sub-
sequent research confirms the abundance and diversity of microbes in deep sea floor
rocks and associated sediments that rivals the rich microbial ecosystems found in soil.
These  studies  suggest  that  as  much  as  two-thirds  of  Earth s  entire  bacterial
biomass might exist in the deep biosphere. Moreover, deep biosphere microbes fuel
their  metabolisms  by  taking  advantage  of  the  chemical  energy  stored  in  various
minerals. In addition, the findings raise new questions about the role of the deep
sea floor in the evolution of life on Earth. Intriguingly, other bodies in the solar
system  have  similar  subsurface  conditions, so  they  might  harbor  microbes, too.
Earth s deep biosphere will therefore continue to be an area of active research.

Animals of the Benthic Environment

Chapter in Review

More than 98% of the 250,000 known marine species live in diverse envi-
ronments  within  or  on  the  ocean  floor. Species  diversity of  these  benthic
organisms depends on their ability to adapt to the conditions of their envi-
ronment, particularly  temperature. With  few  exceptions, the  biomass  of
benthic  organisms  closely  matches  that  of  photosynthetic  productivity  in
surface waters above.

Many adverse conditions exist in the intertidal zone of rocky shores, but
organisms have adapted so they can densely populate these environments.
Influenced by the tides, rocky shores can be divided into a high tide zone
(mostly dry), a middle tide zone (equally wet and dry), and a low tide zone
(mostly wet). The intertidal zone is bounded by the supratidal zone, which
is  covered  only  by  storm  waves, and  the  subtidal  zone, which  extends
below the low tide shoreline.

Each  of  these  zones  contains  characteristic  types  of  marine  life.
Periwinkle  snails, rock  louses, and  limpets  can  be  found  in  the  subtidal
zone. Sessile organisms can be found in the high tide zone, especially buck-
shot barnacles. Algae become more abundant in the middle tide zone, and
the  diversity  and  abundance  of  the  flora  and  fauna  increase  toward  the
lower intertidal zone. Acorn barnacles, gooseneck barnacles, mussels, and
sea  stars  are  commonly  found  in  the  middle  tide  zone, as  well  as  sea
anemones, fishes, hermit crabs, and sea urchins. The low tide zone in tem-
perate latitudes has a variety of moderately sized red and brown algae that
provide a drooping canopy for animal life.

Many  varieties  of  burrowing  infauna  are  common  along  sediment-
covered shores (that is, beaches, salt marshes, and mud flats). Compared with
rocky shores, however, the diversity of species in sediment-covered shores is
less. As with the rocky shore, the diversity of species and abundance of life on
the sediment-covered shore increase toward the low tide shoreline.

In more protected segments of the shore, wave energy is lower, so sand
and mud are deposited. Sand deposits are usually well oxygenated compared
to  mud  deposits. The  intertidal  region  of  sediment-covered  shores  has  high,
middle, and low tide zones, similar to rocky shores. Organisms characteristic

of  sandy  beaches include  bivalve  (two-shelled)  mollusks, lugworms, beach
hoppers, sand crabs, sand stars, and heart urchins. Organisms characteristic of
mud flats include eelgrass, turtle grass, bivalve mollusks, and fiddler crabs.

Attached to the rocky subtidal bottom just beyond the shoreline is a band
of algae that often creates kelp forests. Kelp forests are the home of many
organisms, including  other  varieties  of  algae, mollusks, sea  stars, fishes,
octopus, lobsters, marine mammals, sea hares, and sea urchins.

Spiny  lobsters are  common  to  rocky  bottoms  in  the  Caribbean  and
along  the  West  Coast, and  the  American  (Maine)  lobster is  found  from
Labrador to Cape Hatteras. Oyster beds found in estuarine environments
consist of individuals that attach themselves to the bottom or to the empty
shells of previous generations.

Coral reefs consist of large colonies of coral polyps and many other species
that  need  warm  water  and  strong  sunlight  to  live. Coral  reefs  are  usually
found  in  nutrient-poor  tropical  waters. Reef-building  corals  and  other
mixotrophs  are  hermatypic, containing  symbiotic  algae (zooxanthellae)  in
their  tissues. Delicate  varieties  are  found  at  150  meters, and  they  become
more massive near the surface, where wave energy is higher. The potentially
lethal  bleaching of coral reefs is caused by the removal or expulsion of sym-
biotic algae, probably under stress of elevated sea surface temperatures.

The physical conditions of the deep-ocean floor are much different from
those of shallow water. There is no light and the water is uniformly cold.
The primary food source is from the surface waters above, which limits bio-
mass. Species  diversity  in  the  deep  ocean, however, is  much  higher  than
was previously thought.

Primary production in hydrothermal vent communities near black smok-
ers  is  due  to  chemosynthesis. Some  evidence  suggests  that  hydrothermal
vents may have been some of the first regions where life became established
on Earth, despite the short life span of individual vents. Chemosynthesis
has  also  been  identified  in  low-temperature  seep  biocommunities  near
hypersaline, hydrocarbon, and subduction zone seeps. Studies of the deep
biosphere below the ocean floor reveal a host of microbes.

THE OCEANS AND CLIMATE
CHANGE

Climate  change  and  global  warming  are  topics  that  have  received  much  media  attention  recently.
These topics are often in public opinion polls and in newspaper headlines; as such, they have spurred
intense debate on whether climate change is natural or human caused and what climate changes are
likely to occur in the future. These topics have also become the subject of numerous international
conferences  and  of  complicated  discussions  among  scientists. The  urgent  challenge  of  human-
induced climate disruption continues to be one of the most studied aspects of climate change.

From  a  broad  perspective, the  geologic  record  has  shown  that  Earth s  climate  is  variable.
Evidence from fossils in sea floor sediments and rocks on land suggest that practically everyplace on
Earth has experienced dramatic swings in climate over geologic time. Some examples of this are sta-
ble continental regions that have remained at high latitudes yet display low-latitude fossils and coal
deposits, sea floor sediments that represent much warmer or colder conditions than at present, and
ice age deposits on the sea floor.

Recent  research  on  human  activities  and  their  impact  on  the  environment  has  demonstrated
that people are inadvertently changing Earth s climate. Unlike changes in the past, modern climate
change is dominated by human influences so large that they exceed the bounds of natural variability.
Moreover, these changes are likely to continue for thousands of years. Climate changes can be very
disruptive not only to humans but to many other life forms as well, especially if they occur as rapidly
as some scientists predict.

In this chapter, we will examine Earth s climate system, the science that indicates Earth s recent
and dramatic climate change, how the greenhouse effect works, how the oceans are being affected,
and what can be done about this problem.

16.1 What Comprises Earth s Climate System?
Climate is  defined  as  the  conditions  of  Earth s  atmosphere including  temperature, precipitation,
and wind that characteristically prevail in a particular region over extended time spans.

Obtaining a full understanding of Earth s climate involves studying more than just the atmos-
phere. Earth s  climate  is  a  complex  and  interacting  system  that  includes  the  atmosphere, hydros-
phere, geosphere, biosphere, and  cryosphere.1 Earth s  climate  system involves  the  exchanges  of
energy and moisture that occur among the five spheres. These exchanges link the atmosphere to the
other spheres so that the entire system functions as an interactive unit. Changes to the climate sys-
tem do not occur in isolation. Rather, when one part of it changes, the other components also react.

1The cryosphere (kruos

 icy cold, sphere

 a globe) refers to the ice and snow that exists at Earth s surface.

Whats the difference between weather and climate?

Weather describes the conditions of the atmosphere
at a given place and time whereas climate is the long-
term average of weather. For example, the expected
weather  conditions  on  a  particular  day  will  help  you 
determine if you ll wear shorts or thermal underwear
that day; the ratio of shorts to thermal underwear in
your drawer reflects the climate of the region. Or, as
Mark  Twain  once  said  about  the  difference  between
the two,  Climate is what we expect, weather is what
we get.

The major components of Earth s climate system are shown in Figure 16.1. Notice
that the oceans are the most massive part of Earth s climate system.

Planetary atmospheric processes are large scale and include many feedback
loops, which are processes that modify the end result. For example, warmer sur-
face temperatures increase evaporation rates. This in turn increases water vapor
in the atmosphere, which absorbs heat emitted from Earth s surface before it gets
released  into  space. Therefore, the  more  water  vapor  in  the  air, the  less  heat
escapes and the warmer the planet becomes. This type of feedback loop is called a
positive-feedback loop because it reinforces the initial change.

Alternatively, negative-feedback loops tend to counteract or mitigate an ini-
tial change. One such example is the formation of clouds. A probable result of a
global  temperature  rise  is  an  accompanying  increase  in  cloud  cover  due  to  the
higher  moisture  content  of  the  atmosphere. Most  clouds  are  good  reflectors  of
incoming solar energy, thus diminishing the amount of solar energy available to
heat  Earth s  surface  and  warm  the  atmosphere. In  this  way, clouds  can  cause  a
decrease in overall air temperature.

These two examples of increased water vapor in the atmosphere show that it
can be both a positive-feedback loop and a negative-feedback loop. Which effect,
if either, is stronger? Recent studies show that the negative effect of higher reflec-
tivity is dominant. Therefore, the net result of an increase in atmospheric moisture
should be a decrease in air temperature. The magnitude of this negative-feedback
loop, however, is not likely to be as great as the feedback caused by other positive
feedback  loops  between  other  parts  of  Earth s  climate  system. Thus, although
increases in atmospheric moisture and cloud cover may partly offset a global tem-
perature increase, climate models show that the overall effect will still be a tem-
perature increase. In fact, the scientific consensus is that the increasing levels of

human-caused2 emissions will lead to a warmer planet with a different distribu-
tion of climate patterns than what currently exist on Earth.

The  global  climate  system  contains  many  feedback  loops, such  as  the  role  of
clouds  at  different  altitudes, the  presence  of  fine  atmospheric  particles  called
aerosols, the shading effect from air pollution, heat uptake by the oceans, and the
addition of water vapor in the atmosphere. Many of these feedback loops influence
other  feedbacks. For  example, some  computer  models  of  climate  show  that  if
Earth s climate does warm as anticipated, there will be more evaporation of seawa-
ter, thus using up much of the excess heat and generating
more cloud cover, which will block the Sun s rays and sig-
nificantly reduce the warming effect. As such, the success-
ful modeling of Earth s climate and its feedback loops is
one of the biggest scientific challenges today even using
some of the world s most powerful computers.

16.2 Earth s Recent

Climate Change: Is It
Natural or Caused By
Human Influence?

Records of past climate change reveal that natural events
have  influenced  climate  throughout  Earth s  history.
Skeptics of global climate change point out that because
Earth s climate has fluctuated in the past, the recent cli-
mate change observed on Earth could be a natural event.
How can scientists tell whether this is true?

Determining Earth s Past Climate:
Proxy Data and Paleoclimatology
Climate  scientists  use  three  closely  connected  methods
to  understand  changes  in  Earth s  climate: They  look  at
records of Earth s past climates to see how and why cli-
mate  changed  in  the  past; they  build  computer  models
that allow them to see how the climate works; and they
closely monitor Earth s current vital signs with an array
of  instruments  ranging  from  space-based  satellites  to
deep-sea  thermometers. These  monitoring  tools, how-
ever, have  been  available  for  only  a  few  decades. To
understand the behavior of the atmosphere and to antic-
ipate future climate change, scientists must be able to dis-
cern how climate has changed in the past.

Instrumental  records  go  back  only  a  couple  of  cen-
turies  at  best, and  the  further  back  we  go, the  less  com-
plete and more unreliable the data become. To overcome
the lack of direct measurements in the past, scientists must
decipher and reconstruct Earth s previous climates using
indirect  evidence. Such  proxy (proxum   nearest)  data
come from natural recorders of climate variability such as
sea floor sediments (see Chapter 4), coral deposits, annual
layers of snow packed  in  glacial  ice  (Figure  16.2), fossil

 to produce).

FIGURE 16.2 Researchers extract an ice core from its drilling tube. To recon-
struct past temperatures and atmospheric conditions, scientists use natural records of 
climate change such as this ice core that was recently collected in Antarctica. The annual
layers of snow packed in glacial ice preserve a record of climate that stretches back 
hundreds of thousands of years.

pollen, tree-growth  rings, and  even  historical  documents. The  data  is  cross-
checked between the various methods and also matched with recent instrumental
measurements (where overlap exists) to ensure accuracy. Scientists who analyze
proxy  data  and  reconstruct  past  climates  are  engaged  in  the  study  of
paleoclimatology (paleo
 the study of). The
main goal of such work is to understand Earth s past climate in order to gain in-
sight  into  Earth s  current  and  future  climate. For  example, climatologists  have
identified  both  warmer  and  cooler  periods  in  Earth s  recent  past, such  as  the
Medieval Warm Period (approximately 950 1250 A.D.) and the Little Ice Age (ap-
proximately 1400 1700 A.D.). As we will see, climatologists have used proxy data
to construct a detailed history of Earth s climate that extends back in time over
the past several hundred thousand years.

Natural Causes of Climate Change
Natural factors that affect Earth s climate include changes in solar energy, varia-
tions in Earth s orbit, volcanic eruptions, and even the movement of Earth s tec-
tonic plates. Let s examine how each of these factors affects global climate.

CHANGES  IN  SOLAR  ENERGY Among  the  most
persistent hypotheses of climate change have been those
based on the idea that the Sun is a variable star, and its
output  of  energy  varies  through  time. In  essence,
increases  in  solar  output  cause  global  warming, while
reductions in solar energy result  in global cooling. This
notion  is  appealing  because  it  can  be  used  to  explain
climate  change  of  any  length  or  intensity. However, an
increase  in  solar  output  also  falls  short  of  explaining
recent  warming. Earth-orbiting  satellites  have  been
making precise measurements of the Sun s output since
the 1980s, and while the Sun s luminosity has increased
by a small amount (0.04%), the observed changes were
not  large  enough  to  account  for  the  warming  recorded
during  the  same  period. Even  proxy  data  of  solar
brightness  over  the  past  1000  years  does  not  show  a
correlation with changes in climate.

Several  proposals  for  climate  change  are  based  on
solar variability related to sunspots, which are dark blem-
ishes that occur periodically on the Sun s surface (Figure
16.3). Sunspots  are  huge  magnetic  storms  that  extend
from  the  Sun s  interior  to  its  surface  and  are  associated
with  the  Sun s  ejection  of  particles. These  particles  can
disrupt  satellite  communications  but  also  produce  the
aurora (Aurora
  Roman  goddess  of  dawn), which  is  a
phenomenon caused by charged solar particles that inter-
act with Earth s magnetic field and produce lights in the
sky. In the Northern Hemisphere, these lights are known
as the aurora borealis, or northern lights, and they have a
matching component in the Southern Hemisphere, called
the aurora australis, or southern lights.

Along  with  other  solar  activity, the  numbers  of  sunspots  seems  to  increase
and  decrease  in  a  regular  way, creating  a  cycle  of  about  11  years  that  has  been
observed since the 1700s. The last solar maximum occurred in 2001; the magneti-
cally active sunspots at that time produced powerful solar flares that caused large

FIGURE 16.3 Sunspots. The dark blemishes on this image
of the Sun are called sunspots, which are actually huge mag-
netic storms. The occurrence of sunspots varies in an 11-year
cycle, which does not correlate with recent climate changes
on Earth.

geomagnetic  disturbances  and  disrupted  some  space-based  technology  on
Earth. In spite of efforts to correlate this cycle of sunspot activity to temper-
ature and precipitation changes on Earth, there is no clear evidence to sup-
port it. In fact, many studies have shown that there is no significant correla-
tion between solar activity and climate on such short timescales.

Circular

orbit

Elliptical

orbit

VARIATIONS  IN  EARTH S  ORBIT Another  natural  mechanism  of  climate
change involves changes in Earth s orbit. Changes in the shape of the orbit
(eccentricity), variations in the angle that Earth s axis makes with the plane
of  its  orbit  (obliquity), and  the  wobbling  of  the  axis  (precession)  cause
fluctuations  in  the seasonal  and  latitudinal  distribution  of  solar  radiation
reaching Earth (Figure 16.4). These variations have cycles of about 100,000
years, 41,000 years, and 26,000 years, respectively; when they coincide with
one another, they tend to amplify each other and cause climate variations
on  Earth. This  idea, first  developed  by  Serbian  astrophysicist  Milutin
Milankovitch, is called a Milankovitch cycle. It is now well established that
these variations have contributed to the alternating glacial and interglacial
episodes  that  characterize  the  most  recent  ice  age, which  occurred  during
the past few million years.

Although it is well established that Milankovitch cycles are responsi-
ble for long-term climate change associated with the most recent ice age
on Earth, these changes take many thousands of years to manifest them-
selves. In contrast, the dramatic and rapid climate change that is occurring
on  our  planet  cannot  be  explained  by  these  long-term  variations  in
Earth s orbit.

VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS Explosive volcanic eruptions emit huge quantities
of  gases  and  fine-grained  debris  into  the  atmosphere  (Figure  16.5). The
largest  eruptions  are  sufficiently  powerful  to  inject  material  high  into  the
atmosphere, where it spreads around the globe and remains aloft for many
months  or  even  years. As  was  seen  with  historic  eruptions  such  as  Mount
Tambora in Indonesia (1815), Krakatoa in Indonesia (1883), El Chichón in
Mexico  (1982), and  Mount  Pinatubo  in  the  Philippines  (1991), volcanic
material ejected into the atmosphere filters out a portion of the incoming
solar radiation, which in turn cools the planet. For example, the year after
the  1815  eruption  of  Mount Tambora  became  widely  known  as  the Year
without  Summer  because  of  its  effect  on  North American  and  European
weather. However, the gases emitted during a volcanic eruption react with
other  components  of  the  climate  system  and  the  volcanic  dust  eventually
settles out. Thus, the cooling effect of a single eruption, no matter how large,
is relatively small and short-lived.

(a)

(b)

If volcanism is to have a pronounced impact over an extended period,
many  great  eruptions  closely  spaced  in  time  would  need  to  occur. If  this
happened, the  upper  atmosphere  would  be  loaded  with  enough  gases  to
alter the composition of the atmosphere and enough volcanic dust to seri-
ously diminish the amount of solar radiation reaching the surface. Because
no such period of explosive volcanism is known to have occurred in historic
times, it is unlikely to be responsible for the recent observable climate changes. In
the distant past, however, it may have been influential in contributing to climate
shifts.

MOVEMENT  OF  EARTH S  TECTONIC  PLATES As  described  in  Chapter  2,
Earth s  tectonic  plates  have  moved  great  distances. During  the  geologic  past,
plate  movements  have  accounted  for  many  dramatic  climate  changes  as
landmasses shifted in relation to one another and moved to different latitudinal
positions. As  land  masses  have  moved, they  have  changed  ocean  circulation,

The Oceans and Climate Change

altering  the  transport  of  heat  and  moisture  and  consequently  the  climate. For
example, the opening of Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica
about  41  million  years  ago  caused  a  fundamental  reorganization  of  ocean
currents  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere, leading  to  the  isolation  of  Antarctica,
which  caused  it  to  become  much  cooler  and  develop  a  permanent  ice  cap.
However, the  rate  of  plate  movement  is  very  slow only  a  few  centimeters  per
year
and so appreciable changes in the positions of continents occur only over
great spans of geologic time. Thus, climate changes triggered by shifting plates are
extremely gradual and happen on a scale of millions of years.

CAN NATURAL CLIMATE CHANGE FACTORS EXPLAIN RECENTLY OBSERVED
CLIMATE  CHANGES? It  is  clear  that  natural  factors  have  changed  Earth s
climate in the past and that they will undoubtedly change it in the future. For
example, natural climate change has been definitively linked to global climate
shifts  such  as  the  Pleistocene  Ice  Age, the  Medieval  Warm  Period, and  the
Little  Ice  Age. However, an  examination  of  natural  climate  change  factors
reveals that the recently observed climate changes such as the rate of warming
in  recent  decades  is  greater  than  can  be  explained  by  any  natural  factors. In
fact, several recent studies based on paleoclimate data reveal that the warming
in the past three decades is unprecedented on Earth during the past 1000 years.
The  only  viable  explanation  for  these  recent  climate  changes  including
warming of Earth s surface is the well-documented increase in human-caused
emissions.

The IPCC: Documenting Human-Caused 
Climate Change
In  1988,
the  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  and  the  World
Meteorological  Organization  sponsored  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on
Climate  Change  (IPCC), a worldwide group of atmospheric and climate scien-
tists that began studying the human effects on climate change and global warm-
ing. The IPCC utilizes peer-reviewed literature to analyze all aspects of climate
change
including  science, impacts, adaptation, and  mitigation to  provide  in-
dependent scientific advice about climate change. Since 1990, the group has pub-
lished  a  series  of assessment  reports  (Figure  16.6)  that  are  highly  regarded  by
both scientists and policymakers and have sparked international movement on
climate change.

The IPCC s first assessment report, released in 1990, became the basis for the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, an international treaty
in  which  signatories  agreed  to  the  idea  of  reducing  concentrations  of  greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. The IPCC s second assessment report, published in 1995,
states  that  the  balance  of  evidence  suggests  a  discernable  human  influence  on
global  climate and  that  global  warming  is  unlikely  to  be  entirely  due  to  natural
causes.

In 2001, a third IPCC assessment report was published under the guidance of 426
scientists and was unanimously accepted by more than 160 delegates from 100 coun-
tries.The report states: There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming
observed over the past 50 years is attributable to human activities. The report notes
that recent regional climate changes already have affected many physical and biolog-
ical systems on Earth and that projected climate change as well as changes in cli-
mate extremes
could have major consequences.The report also revised the estimate
of the world s expected temperature increase for the period between 1990 and 2100.
Previously, the amount of predicted warming had been 1.0 to 3.5°C (1.8 to 6.3°F); the
new report revised it upward at 1.4 to 5.8°C (2.5 to 10.4°F), based on new climate
models.

FIGURE 16.5 Volcanic eruptions spew volcanic debris
and gases into the atmosphere. This 1991 eruption of
Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines shows that volcanoes have
the ability to inject into the atmosphere large quantities of
volcanic dust and gases, which can circle the globe and block
incoming solar radiation, thereby cooling the planet.

FIGURE 16.6 Cover of the IPCC Climate Change 2007
Synthesis Report. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) has published four assessment reports since
1990 confirming that human-induced emissions are altering
Earth s climate.

Why was this winter so cold when theres supposed
to be global warming?

One of the documented changes of a warmer world is
increased  variation  in  temperature  extremes.  This
means  that  while  the  climate  is  warming,  there  will
be  a  wider  range  of  temperatures,  including  both
warmer and colder temperature extremes. In essence,
global warming increases the chances of such extreme
events occurring. Also, remember that climate is the
long-term average of weather, so although it might be
colder  during  one  season,  the  climate  can  still  be
warming. What matters is not what happens on any
given  day  or  season  but  what  the  trend  is  over  a 
period of years. On this, the data are clear: Earth is
experiencing long-term global warming.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Earth s climate has changed in the past due to 
natural causes such as changes in the Sun s output,
variations in Earth s orbit, volcanic activity, or the
movement of tectonic plates. Multiple lines of 
evidence show that the current climate changes 
are due primarily to human activities that release
heat-trapping emissions into the atmosphere.

In  2005, an  international  consortium  of  science  academies, including  the  U.S.
National Academy of Sciences, issued this statement: The scientific understanding of
climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action . . . . As
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) recog-
nizes, a lack of full scientific certainty about some aspects of climate change is not
a reason for delaying an immediate response that will, at a reasonable cost, prevent
dangerous [human-induced] interference with the climate system.

In 2007, a fourth IPCC assessment report

created by more than 600 authors
from  40  countries  and  reviewed  by  more  than  600  individuals was  published.
The report was accepted and approved by representatives from 113 countries. The
fourth IPCC report confirmed what many scientists had long suspected: Human-
caused  climate  change  is  already  altering  Earth. In  fact, climate  change  models
can mimic present-day conditions only if human emissions are taken into account.
Some of the documented changes specifically mentioned in the report include the
warming  of  oceans  and  land, temperature  extremes, melting  of  snow  and  ice,
changing  wind  patterns, changing  water  patterns, and  a  variety  of  changes  to
a large  assortment  of  organisms. The  report  also  states  that  the  temperature
increases  observed  since  the  mid-20th  century  are  very  likely  due  to  human-
caused  emissions, with  the  probability  of  human  influence  upgraded  to  greater
than 90% certainty. This IPCC report clearly documents the fact that by adding
emissions to the atmosphere, humans are altering global climate and are produc-
ing  significant  impacts  on  physical  and  biological  systems  worldwide. A  fifth
IPCC assessment report is expected to be published in 2014.

The IPCC assessment reports provide strong documentation of the planet s
human-induced  climate  changes, such  as  global  warming. In  recognition  of  that
fact, the  IPCC  was  named  a  co-recipient  of  the  2007  Nobel  Peace  Prize, along
with  former  U.S. Vice  President Al  Gore, Jr., for  his  work  on  the  documentary
film An Inconvenient Truth. When it bestowed the award, the Nobel Committee
noted, Through  the  scientific  reports  it  has  issued  over  the  past  two  decades,
the IPCC has created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection
between human activities and global warming.

Other subsequent reports confirm the findings of the IPCC. In 2009, for exam-
ple, the  U.S. Global  Change  Research  Program  issued  a  190-page  interagency
report entitled  Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States. The report
states  that  global  warming  is  unequivocal  and  primarily  human-induced. The
report also notes that  global average temperature has risen by about 1.5°F [0.8°C]
since  1900. By  2100, it  is  projected  to  rise  another  2  to  11.5°F  [1.1  to  6.4°C].
Increases at the lower end of this range are more likely if global heat-trapping gas
emissions  are  cut  substantially. If  emissions  continue  to  rise  at  or  near  current
rates, temperature  increases  are  more  likely  to  be  near  the  upper  end  of  the
range. The report warns that climate change will have numerous impacts on water
resources, ecosystems, agriculture, coastal areas, human health, and other sectors.

16.3 What Causes the Atmosphere s

Greenhouse Effect?

There is ample documentation that human-caused emissions are responsible for
the recent and dramatic climate changes experienced on Earth. One such change
is the increase in average worldwide temperature, which is called global warming.
Although  the  warming  of  Earth s  surface  and  atmosphere  is  a  natural  process
controlled by the greenhouse effect, it is also being altered by human emissions, a
phenomenon that is often referred to as the anthropogenic greenhouse load or the
enhanced greenhouse effect.

The  greenhouse  effect gets  its  name  because  it  keeps  Earth s  surface  and
lower atmosphere warm in a way similar to a greenhouse that keeps plants warm

476

enough to grow regardless of outside conditions (Figure 16.7). Energy radiated by
the  Sun  covers  the  full  electromagnetic  spectrum, but  most  of  the  energy  that
reaches Earth s surface is short wavelengths, in and near the visible portion of the
spectrum. In a greenhouse, shortwave sunlight passes through the glass or plastic
covering, where it strikes the plants, the floor, and other objects inside and is con-
verted into longer-wavelength infrared radiation (heat). Some of this heat energy
escapes from the greenhouse and some is trapped for a while by the glass or plas-
tic covering, which keeps the greenhouse nice and snug much like what happens

in Earth s atmosphere.3

Earth s Heat Budget and Changes 
in Wavelength
Figure  16.8 diagrams  the  various  components  of  Earth s  heat  budget,
which  describes  all  the  ways  in  which  heat  is  added  to  and  subtracted
from Earth. In the upper atmosphere, most solar radiation within the vis-
ible spectrum penetrates the atmosphere to Earth s surface, like sunlight
coming through greenhouse glass. After scattering by atmospheric mole-
cules and reflection off clouds, about 47% of the solar radiation that is
directed towards Earth is absorbed by the oceans and continents. About
23%  is  absorbed  by  the  atmosphere  and  clouds, and  about  30%  is
reflected into space by atmospheric backscatter, clouds, and Earth s surface.
Figure 16.9 shows that most of the energy coming to Earth from the Sun
is within the visible spectrum and peaks at a wavelength of 0.48 micrometer4
(0.0002 inch). The atmosphere is transparent to much of this radiation, but it is
absorbed by materials such as water and rocks at Earth s surface. These surface
materials absorb and then emit radiation away from Earth s surface toward space
as  longer  wavelength  infrared  (heat)  radiation, with  a  peak  at  a  wavelength  of
10 micrometers (0.004 inch). Molecules of atmospheric gases such as water vapor,
carbon dioxide, and other gases intercept the heat radiation that attempts to leave
the planet, thus heating the atmosphere. This heating of the atmosphere is known as
the greenhouse effect. Because Earth has maintained a relatively constant average
temperature over long periods of time, the rates of energy absorption and reradia-
tion back into space must be equal.

In  summary, most  of  the  solar  radiation  that  is  not  reflected  back  to  space
passes  through  the  atmosphere  and  is  absorbed  at  Earth s  surface. Earth s  sur-
face, in turn, emits longer wavelength infrared radiation (heat). A portion of this
energy is absorbed by certain heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, thus produc-
ing the greenhouse effect. Thus, the change of wavelengths from visible to infrared
is the key to understanding how the greenhouse effect works.

Some  of  the  infrared  energy  absorbed  in  the  atmosphere  becomes  reab-
sorbed by Earth to continue the process; the rest is lost to space. The solar radiation
received  at  the  surface  is  therefore  retained  for  a  time  within  our  atmosphere,
where  it  moderates  temperature  fluctuations  between  night  and  day  and  also
between seasons.

Which Gases Contribute to the Greenhouse Effect?
Earth s  greenhouse  effect  is  caused  by  an  array  of  atmospheric  gases, many  of
which  have  both  natural  and  human-caused  sources. Take, for  example, water
vapor, which  contributes  more  to  the  greenhouse  effect  than  any  other  gas. In

3Recent studies have indicated that an additional factor in keeping a greenhouse warm is that the
greenhouse covering prevents mixing of air inside with cooler air outside. Although this is different
from how the atmosphere works, the term greenhouse effect is still commonly used to describe the 
atmosphere s warming process.
4A micrometer (*m), or micron, is one-millionth of a meter.

FIGURE 16.7 How a greenhouse works. The glass of a
greenhouse allows incoming sunlight to pass through but traps
heat. Similarly, gases like water, carbon dioxide, and methane
in Earth s atmosphere act just like the glass of a greenhouse
by allowing sunlight to pass through but trapping heat.

What would Earths temperature be like if there was
no natural greenhouse effect?

In a word: freezing! The worldwide average tempera-
ture of Earth and the lowermost atmosphere (tropo-
sphere)  is  about  15°C  (59°F).  If  the  atmosphere 
contained  no  heat-trapping  greenhouse  gases,  the
average  worldwide  temperature  would  be  about
+18°C  (0°F).  At  this  temperature,  our  planet  would
very likely have a frozen surface akin to that of Mars.
Instead,  the  atmosphere s  greenhouse  gases  help
create and sustain  the moderate temperatures that
make Earth habitable.

fact, water  vapor  is  the  single  most  important
absorber  of  heat
its  contribution  to  the  green-
house  effect  is  between  36%  and  66%  of  the
greenhouse  effect and  together  with  clouds
comprises  between  66%  and  85%  of  the  green-
house  effect. Mostly, though, water  vapor  enters
the atmosphere through evaporation and by other
natural  processes. Although  atmospheric  water
vapor  concentrations  fluctuate  regionally, studies
suggest that human activity does not significantly
affect  water  vapor  concentrations  except  at  local
scales, such as near irrigated fields. And even then,
the  water  vapor  does  not  stay  in  the  atmosphere
for very long. In essence, human activities do not
directly  affect  the  amount  of  water  vapor  in  the
atmosphere on a global scale.

ing  as  a  result  of  human  activities. Remarkably,
these  gases  exist  in  very  small  amounts  in  the
atmosphere, yet  they  have  a  profound  effect  on
heating. Some  of  these  greenhouse  gases  are  released  by  both  human  and
natural  sources  (such  as  carbon  dioxide, which  has  been  a  component  of  the
atmosphere  long  before  human  activities). Others, however, have  no  natural
source  and  thus  are  clearly  human  induced  (such  as  the  chemicals  known  as
chlorofluorocarbons).

Of  all  the  human-caused  gases, carbon  dioxide  makes  the  greatest  relative
contribution  to  increasing  the  greenhouse  effect  (Table  16.1). Carbon  dioxide
enters  the  atmosphere  as  the  result  of  combustion  of  carbon  compounds  with
oxygen and is a colorless and odorless gas that is the same one we exhale from
our lungs. The conversion of fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) into energy by cars,
factories, and power plants accounts for the majority of the annual human contri-
bution  to  carbon  dioxide  emissions, with  industrialized  nations  contributing  the
most. As a result of human activities, therefore, atmospheric concentration of car-
bon  dioxide  has  increased  nearly  40%  over  the  past  250  years  (Figure  16.10).
What  concerns  scientists  is  that  over  the  past  250  years and  especially  in  the
past 50 years human activities have been responsible for raising the concentra-
tion of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at an ever-increasing rate. The con-
centration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is currently 387 parts per million and is
increasing by about 2 parts per million each year; this rate of increase is double
that from only 50 years ago. In terms of sheer numbers, humans are now pumping
into  the  atmosphere  more  than  8  billion  metric  tons  (8.8  billion  short  tons)  of
carbon dioxide each year.5

Methane  is  the  second  most  abundant  human-caused  greenhouse  gas
(Table 16.1). It  is  produced  by  leakage  from  decomposing  trash  in  landfills, by
methane-belching domestic cattle, and by agriculture (particularly the cultivation
of rice). Even though methane has a lower concentration in the atmosphere than
carbon  dioxide, it  has  a  greater  ability  to  produce  warming  on  a  per-molecule
basis. Since  the  industrial  revolution  began  in  about  1750, the  concentration  of
methane in the atmosphere has increased by 250%.

In 2005, researchers recovered a nearly 3.2-kilometer (2-mile) continuous ice
core from Antarctica that contains a record of past atmospheric concentrations of

5On average, each person on Earth emits more than 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) of carbon dioxide
per year. Of course, this number is several times greater for those living in industrial nations than for
those living in developing countries.

Isnt carbon dioxide causing the hole in the ozone layer?

Here s the short answer: Definitely not! The ozone layer occurs within the atmosphere s stratosphere and is composed of ozone mole-
cules (O3) that absorb most of the Sun s ultraviolet radiation. Without it, unhealthy levels of ultraviolet radiation would reach Earth s sur-
face, making the planet largely uninhabitable. The main ozone hole (actually, a seasonal thinning of the ozone layer) occurs above the
South Pole, with a smaller one above the North Pole. Both are caused by chemical reactions with natural and human-generated com-
pounds, particularly the now-banned chemicals CFC-11 and CFC-12, but not carbon dioxide. CFCs are also strong greenhouse gases
(see Table 16.1), so CFCs are thus double threats to the environment: Their buildup in the atmosphere leads to the destruction of the
ozone layer, and at the same time, contributes to global warming. Notice also from Table 16.1 that tropospheric (lower atmosphere)
ozone, which is a byproduct of combustion, is a potent greenhouse gas. With the ban of CFCs firmly in place, scientists predict that
the ozone layer will achieve its normal thickness by mid-century. However, new research reports that human-generated nitrous oxide,
which destroys ozone, is now the single greatest ozone-depleting substance.

that get trapped
as the ice accumulates. Analysis of the core shows that current atmospheric con-
centrations of carbon dioxide and methane are at their highest levels in at least
the past 800,000 years (Figure 16.11). In addition, the chemical make-up of the ice
provides a proxy of the past average temperature on Earth, which shows a strong
correlation with atmospheric methane and carbon dioxide.

The  other  trace  gases  shown  in  Table  16.1 nitrous  oxide, tropospheric
ozone, and  chlorofluorocarbons
are  present  in  far  lower  concentrations. Yet
they are still very important because they absorb many times more infrared radi-
ation per molecule than carbon dioxide or methane (Table 16.1, last column), thus
making  them  very  potent  contributors  to  warming. Still, these  gases  have  a
smaller  overall  contribution  to  increasing  the  greenhouse  effect  because  their
concentrations  are  so  low. Nevertheless, all  of  these  gases  must  be  taken  into
account when considering the total amount of greenhouse warming.

The greenhouse effect is caused by gases that allow
sunlight to pass through but trap heat energy before
it is radiated back to space. Carbon dioxide is fore-
most in an array of gases from human activity that
increase the atmosphere s ability to trap heat.

What Changes Are Occurring Because of Global
Warming?
Melting  glaciers  and  ice  caps, shorter  winters, shifts  in  species  distribution, and
a steady rise in average global and sea surface temperatures are just some of the
indications  that  additional  human-induced  greenhouse  warming  is  occurring.
Take, for example, these observations about Earth s temperature, which are based
on weather stations on land, satellite data, and, for earlier measurements, proxy
data or data from ships:

Earth s  average  surface  temperature  has  risen  0.6°C  (1.1°F)  over  the  past
30 years and 0.8°C (1.4°F) over the past 140 years (Figure 16.12).
The rate of warming in the past 50 years was double the rate observed over the
past 100 years.
Worldwide, the  8  warmest  years  have  all  occurred  since  1998, and  the  14
warmest years on record have all occurred since 1990.
Over the past century, the planet has experienced the largest increase in sur-
face temperature in 1300 years.

there  is  a  scientific  consensus  that  human-induced  emissions  are

responsible for this observed warming. In fact, the warming trends observed since
1950 cannot be explained without accounting for human-caused greenhouse gases.
As  global  temperatures  continue  to  increase, researchers  use  sophisticated
climate models to forecast what changes will occur on Earth. Because of the com-
plexity  of  the  climate  system  and  its  feedback  loops, not  all  models  agree  as  to
what or how severe those changes will be. However, there are points on which the
models do agree: a strong warming of high northern latitudes, a moderate warm-
ing of middle latitudes, and relatively little warming in low latitudes. Other pre-
dicted changes many of which are already happening

include the following:

Earlier  summertime  seasons, with  higher  summer  temperatures, including
longer and more intense heat waves.
More  extreme  precipitation  events, such  as  severe  droughts  in  certain  areas
and increased chances of flooding in other areas.
The worldwide retreat of mountain glaciers, which is already being observed.

Ive heard that scientists were predicting an oncom-
ing ice age only a few decades ago. Whats changed?

Skeptics of global warming have pointed out that in the
1970s,  climate  scientists  were  warning  of  an  immi-
nent ice age.  In reality,  the  idea lacked scientific con-
sensus,  although  the  media  popularized  the  notion
with sometimes quite alarmist accounts. It is true that
from  the  1950s  through  the  1970s,  there  was  an 
observed  global  cooling  trend.  This  fact,  coupled  with
the idea that ice ages are cyclical and that our planet
was  poised  for  millennia  of  global  cooling  based  on
variations in Earth s orbit, led to speculation that Earth
may return to an ice age. However, it is now known that
the  recent  cooling  was  probably  due  to  a  substantial
increase in aerosols, which at the time masked the tell-
tale  signature  of  global  warming.  Looking  at  a  longer
view  of  global  temperature  since  that  time,  Earth s 
recent warming trend can be clearly discerned.

Note that not all predicted changes have negative consequences. For instance,
increased  warming  is  expected  to  provide  a  longer  growing  season  for  some
crops, and increased atmospheric carbon dioxide should help promote productiv-
ity  in  plants. However, a  number  of  uncertainties  remain  in  understanding
regional effects of climate change, and various components of the climate system
may respond to these changes in unanticipated and surprising ways.

16.4 What Changes Are Occurring 

in the Oceans?

The  oceans  are  a  key  component  in  the  global  climate  system  that  is  currently
experiencing dramatic changes. Let s examine some of the observed and predicted
effects of global warming in the oceans.

Increasing Ocean Temperatures
Studies have revealed that the oceans have absorbed the majority of the increased
heat  in  the  atmosphere. Indeed, millions  of  ocean  temperature  observations  at
various  depths  reveal  that  there  has  been  an  increase  in  surface  temperature
(Figure 16.13). These measurements indicate that global sea surface temperatures
have risen by about 0.6°C (1°F) from global warming, mainly since about 1970.
However, this warming has not been uniform throughout the ocean. The greatest
temperature  increases  have  been  experienced  in  the  Arctic  Ocean, near  the
Antarctic Peninsula, and in tropical waters. Even deep waters are showing signs of
warming: In some places, warming has been documented to a depth of 0.8 kilome-
ter  (0.5  mile)  or  more. To  determine  the  extent  of  warming  experienced  in  the
oceans, scientists have initiated global monitoring of ocean temperature (Box 16.1).

THE ATOC EXPERIMENT: SOFAR SO GOOD?

Worldwide, a layer exists in the ocean at a
depth  of  about  1000  meters  (3300  feet)
formed by temperature and pressure con-
ditions 
that  cause  sound  originating
above  and  below  it  to  become  refracted,
or bent, into the layer (Figure 16A, lower
inset). Once  in  this  layer, called  the
SOFAR  channel (an  acronym  for  sound
fixing  and  ranging), or  deep  sound  chan-
nel, sound is efficiently trapped and trans-
mitted long distances. For instance, certain
whales  may  use  the  SOFAR  channel  to
send sounds across entire ocean basins.

The  idea  of  sending  sounds  through
the SOFAR channel in an effort to detect

of  the  greenhouse  effect  was  initiated  by
Walter  Munk  of  the  Scripps  Institute  of
Oceanography  (Figure  16A, upper  inset).
His 
named  Acoustic
Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC),
is  designed  to  accurately  measure  the
travel time of similar low-frequency sound
signals  through  the  SOFAR  channel  now
and  in  the  future. The  speed  of  sound  in
seawater  increases  as  temperature  in-
creases, so sound should take less time to
travel the same distance in the future if, in
fact, the oceans are warming.

many  different  receiving  sites  along
straight-line  paths  (Figure  16A). The 
researchers deployed an underwater array
similar to a series of loudspeakers that sent
acoustical (akouein
  to  hear)  signals  for
six  days. These  signals  refracted  into  the
ocean s  SOFAR  channel  and  were  trans-
mitted throughout the oceans. After travel-
ing  for  many  hours  and  as  far  as  19,000
kilometers (11,800 miles), the signals were
received at shipboard recording stations.

The  success  of  ship-based  testing  at
Heard Island led to the establish-
ment of a fixed sound source near
Pioneer  Seamount  off  California
and  an  array  of  fixed  receivers
throughout  the  Pacific  Ocean. In
1995, ATOC  sound  signals  were
sent again. Even though many pre-
cautions  were  taken  to  avoid  any
unwanted effects on marine mam-
mals,

were found dead in the area a few
days after the sound transmissions
had  begun. The  sounds  were
halted  while  the  U.S. National
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)
conducted  research  to  determine
whether  the  sounds  affected  the
hearing of nearby whales and con-
tributed  to  their  deaths. After

dent, producing  a wealth of data

The impacts of a warmer ocean are far-reaching and will persist for several
centuries. For  example, increased  seawater  temperatures  are  likely  to  affect
temperature-sensitive  organisms  such  as  corals. As  discussed  in  Chapter  15,
warmer  sea  surface  temperatures  have  been  implicated  in  widespread  coral
bleaching events (see Box 15.1). In addition, increased seawater temperatures are
likely to affect the distribution of sea ice, the ocean s deep-water circulation pat-
tern, El Niño/La Niña events, and the development of hurricanes.

Increasing Hurricane Activity
Many scientists have suggested that warmer oceans would most certainly cause an
increase  in  the  general  level  of  storminess  because  additional  heat  accelerates
evaporation, which fuels hurricanes. In fact, the frequency and severity of recent
hurricanes especially those in the Atlantic Ocean (see Box 6.2) have kindled a
debate on the effect that global warming may have on the formation of hurricanes.
Although the recent landfall of several large Atlantic hurricanes leads to a general
impression that hurricanes have increased, there have been conflicting reports on
the topic in the scientific literature. Some articles have attributed increases in hur-
ricane  intensity, numbers, and  wind  speeds  to  warmer  sea  surface  temperatures,
while others have claimed that changes in data-gathering methods and instrumen-
tation  are  responsible  for  the  trends. Other  studies  suggest  that  the  apparent
increase in hurricanes can be considered within the statistical limits of normal.

Although the number of tropical storms has not increased worldwide, the sci-
entific consensus is that global warming has led to more intense hurricanes. In the
most  comprehensive  study  of  recent  hurricane  activity  to  date, researchers
demonstrate that there have been significant increases in tropical storm intensity
and  duration  around  the  world  since  1970  and  that  these  trends  are  strongly
related  to  rising  sea  surface  temperatures. Another  study  of  historical Atlantic
hurricanes over the past 1500 years suggests that times of peak hurricane activity
are  related  to  increased  sea  surface  temperatures  and  the  reinforcing  effects  of
La Niña like  climate  conditions. Other  research  explicitly  shows  that  the  most
energetic storm levels
those with Category 4 and 5 designations have increased
significantly, particularly in the North Atlantic and northern Indian Oceans. And,
experts warn that as climate continues to warm as expected, there will likely be
additional increases in peak hurricane wind speed and rainfall.

Changes in Deep-Water Circulation
Evidence from deep-sea sediments and computer models indicates that changes
in the global deep-water circulation pattern can dramatically and abruptly affect
climate. Circulation  in  the  North Atlantic  Ocean, which  provides  an  important
source  of  deep  water  (Figure  16.14), is  particularly  sensitive  to  these  changes.

As this water cools, it generates a huge

southward. Disruption of this circulation
pattern could have severe effects on
global climate.

The Oceans and Climate Change

S T U D E N T S   S O M E T I M E S   A S K . . .

The movie The Day After Tomorrow depicts rapid 
climate change as a result of alterations in deep-
water circulation. Could this really happen?

Although Hollywood movies are well known for dramati-
zation, what is interesting about this blockbuster 2004
film  is  that  its  story  line  is  based  on  recent  scientific
findings: The ocean s deep-water circulation helps drive
ocean  currents  around  the  globe  and  is  important  to
world  climate.  In  fact,  strong  evidence  suggests  that
the  North  Atlantic  deep-water  circulation  has  already
weakened and may further weaken during this century,
resulting in unpleasant effects on our climate but cer-
tainly  not  as  rapid  or  as  cataclysmic  as  the  situation
portrayed  in  the  film.  Computer  models  suggest  that
the  continued  weakening  of  the  North  Atlantic  deep-
water circulation will result in some long-term cooling,
particularly over parts of northern Europe.

What drives deep-water circulation is the sinking of cold, dense surface waters at
high latitudes, particularly in the North Atlantic. If surface waters stopped sinking
because they are too warm and thus low in density, then the oceans would absorb
and redistribute heat from solar radiation much less efficiently. This would likely
cause even warmer surface water temperatures and much higher land tempera-
tures than are experienced now.

Many  scientific  studies  suggest  that  the  buildup  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the
atmosphere will change ocean circulation. One way in which this could happen is
that warmer air temperatures will increase the rate at which glaciers in Greenland
melt, forming  a  pool  of  fresh, low-density  surface  water  in  the  North  Atlantic
Ocean. This  freshwater  could  inhibit  the  downwelling  that  generates  North
Atlantic Deep Water, reorganizing global circulation patterns and causing a cor-
responding change in climate. Many climate experts warn that a large outflow of
freshwater from Greenland could take the North Atlantic system of currents to a
tipping  point, causing  rapid  reorganization  of  deep-water  currents  and  related
changes  in  climate. Indeed, evidence  suggests  that  an  outburst  from  a  North
American  ice-dammed  lake  flooded  the  North  Atlantic  with  freshwater  about
8000 years ago, causing rapid global climate change. This event may be the type of
scenario that the North Atlantic could experience again because of increased pre-
cipitation and melting of ice.

Melting of Polar Ice
Computer  models  have  predicted  that  global  warming  will  affect  Earth s  polar
regions  in  a  very  dramatic  way. One  fundamental  difference  between  the  two
polar regions is that in the Northern Hemisphere, the polar region is dominated
by  the Arctic  Ocean  and  its  cover  of  drifting  sea  ice  (an  ocean  surrounded  by
land), whereas the South Pole is dominated by the continent of Antarctica and its
thick ice cap, including shelf ice that extends into the ocean (land surrounded by
an ocean).

The Arctic is one of the locations where the effects
of  global  warming  are  being  most  keenly  felt  (see  Fig-
ure 16.13)  and  likely  will  experience  quite  dramatic
changes in the future; this phenomenon is called  Arctic
amplification. Since 1978, satellite analysis of the extent
of Arctic  Ocean  sea  ice  indicates  that  it  is  dramatically
shrinking  and  thinning  at  an  accelerating  rate  (Fig-
ure 16.15). In  the  past  decade  alone, there  has  been  a
loss of over 2 million square kilometers (800,000 square
miles) of Arctic sea ice. In fact, measurements of the ice
cap  in  2007  revealed  that  it  had  shrunk  to  its  smallest
size  since  researchers  began  keeping  records; its  extent
fell  below  the  previous  record  low  in  2005  by  an  area
roughly  the  size  of  Texas  and  California  combined. In
addition, the  interior  ice  is  now  unusually  thin  and
spread out, which has resulted in wide patches of ice-free
ocean during the summer

even at the North Pole.

FIGURE 16.15 Arctic sea ice decline.
Perspective view of satellite data, showing the 
extent of Arctic sea ice in September 2007 com-
pared with the average extent of sea ice from
1979 2000 (red line). Note the opening of an 
ice-free Northwest Passage. The substantial 
decrease in amount and thickness of Arctic 
Ocean sea ice is due to human-induced warming 
of the Arctic.

Climate  models  are  in  general  agreement  that  one
of  the  strongest  signals  of  greenhouse  warming  will  be  a  loss  of Arctic  sea  ice.
Indeed, during the past 15 years, the decline in Arctic sea ice has occurred much
faster than models had predicted. Cycles of natural variability are known to play
a  role  in Arctic  sea  ice  extent, but  the  sharp  decline  observed  in  the  past  two
decades cannot be explained by natural variability alone. The accelerated Arctic
sea  ice  melting  appears  to  be  linked  to  shifts  in  Northern  Hemisphere  atmos-
pheric  circulation  patterns  that  have  caused  the  region  to  experience  unusually
rapid  warming. As  a  result, ocean  temperatures  in  the Arctic  Ocean  have  also

FIGURE 16.16 Habitat destruction threatens polar bears.

habitat destruction caused by shrinking Arctic sea ice, polar
bears were designated a Threatened Species in 2008.

increased, causing sea ice to melt from below. Disappearance of sea ice is likely to
enhance  future  warming  in  the  region  because  lower  amounts  of  sea  ice  will
reflect  less  of  the  Sun s  radiation  back  into  space, creating  a  positive-feedback
loop and exacerbating the problem as heat is absorbed by the newly uncovered
ocean. Researchers  fear  that  the Arctic  may  be  on  the  verge  of  a  fundamental
transition or  tipping point
that will lead to the Arctic having only seasonal ice
cover. Some  models, for  example, suggest  that  the Arctic  could  experience  the
complete disappearance of summer sea ice as early as 2030.

The  decrease  of  sea  ice  in  the Arctic  has  already  had  profound  effects  on
Arctic ecosystems. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus; Figure 16.16), for example, are
excellent swimmers but do not hunt in the water. Instead, they require a platform
of  floating  sea  ice  to  capture  their  prey  items, which  are  mainly  seals. As  the
Arctic Ocean becomes more ice-free and the ice habitat shrinks, polar bears will
have  more  difficulty  finding  adequate  food  and  making  dens. As  a  result, polar
bear breeding and survival rates may decline below the point needed to maintain
the population. Their habitat destruction has been so severe that polar bears were
listed  as Threatened  Species  in  2008, according  to  the  U.S. Endangered  Species
Act. Studies reveal that polar bears are likely to lose nearly half of their summer
sea ice habitat by mid-century, which would in turn reduce the world s polar bear
population currently estimated at 25,000 by two-thirds.

In  addition, human  inhabitants  of  the Arctic  are  also  being  affected  by  the
lack  of  sea  ice, as  some  of  their  food  sources  become  scarcer  because  marine
species have migrated further from shore to be near the ice edge. Arctic residents
have complained that their weather is changing, and a recent study supports their
claim. The study determined that the years with the least amount of Arctic sea ice
had  significantly  stronger Arctic  storms. One  new  opportunity  that  now  exists,
however, involves the creation of a new  Northwest Passage shipping lane link-
ing the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans through the largely ice-free por-
tions of the Arctic Ocean (Figure 16.15).

While all these changes are taking place in the Arctic, different but equally
dramatic  ones  are  taking  place  in  Antarctica, particularly  in  the  western  part
of Antarctica  that  includes  the Antarctic  Peninsula. As  discussed  in  Chapter  6,
Antarctica  produces  many  icebergs  from  glaciers  on  land. The  rate  at  which
Antarctica is producing icebergs
especially large icebergs has increased in re-
cent years. For example, the Antarctic Peninsula s Larsen Ice Shelf has decreased
by more than 40% over the past decade, including a huge release of 3250 square
kilometers  (1250  square  miles)  of  ice  during  two  months  in  2002  (see  Fig-
ure 6.24d). In 2006, Antarctica lost nearly 200 billion metric tons (220 short tons)
of ice; during 10 days in 2008, the Wilkins Ice Shelf lost over 400 square kilome-
ters (160 square miles) of ice. The rate of thinning of the Pine Island Glacier
the
largest  stream  of  fast-moving  ice  on  the West Antarctic  Ice  Sheet quadrupled
from 1995 to 2006. And, in the past 30 years, there have been 10 major Antarctic
ice  shelf  collapses
including  the  disappearance  of  the  ice  shelves  knows  as
Jones, Larsen A, Muller, and Wordie after  some  400 years of  relative stability.
Scientists  attribute  this  catastrophic  retreat  to  warming  in  Antarctica; the
Antarctic  Peninsula  has  experienced  some  of  the  greatest  amount  of  warming
worldwide (see Figure 16.13). In fact, Antarctica has warmed at a rate of about
0.12°C  (0.22°F)  per  decade  since  1957, for  a  total  average  temperature  rise  of
0.5°C (1°F) (Figure 16.17).

Recent Increase in Ocean Acidity
The human-induced increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
has  some  severe  implications  for  ocean  chemistry  and  for  marine  life. Recent
studies show that a little less than half of the carbon dioxide released by the burn-
ing of fossil fuels stays in the atmosphere and about a third currently ends up in

the  oceans, dissolving  into  seawater  at  the  ocean  surface. Evidence  is  mounting
that  this  additional  carbon  dioxide  overwhelms  the  ocean s  natural  ability  to
buffer itself.6 The absorbed carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid in seawater, low-
ering the ocean s pH (increasing its acidity in a process called ocean acidification)
and changing the balance of carbonate and bicarbonate ions. In fact, the oceans have
already absorbed enough carbon dioxide for surface waters to have experienced a
pH decrease of 0.1 pH unit since preindustrial times; a recent study has confirmed a
0.04 pH unit decrease in the North Pacific Ocean during just the past two decades.
Other studies suggest an additional pH decrease will be likely in the future.

Moreover, this shift toward increased acidity and the changes in ocean chem-
istry that ensue makes it more difficult for certain marine creatures to build and
maintain hard parts out of easily dissolved calcium carbonate. The decline in pH
thus threatens a diverse assortment of calcifying organisms
creatures that grow
calcium  carbonate  skeletons  or  shells
such  as  coccolithophores, foraminifers,
pteropods, calcareous  algae, sea  urchins, mollusks, and  corals  (Figure  16.18).
These  organisms  provide  essential  food  and  habitat  to  many  other  species, so
their  demise  could  affect  entire  ocean  ecosystems. Recent  studies  have  shown
that in the past 20 years, ocean acidification has already caused a 15% decrease
in the growth rate of corals in Australia s Great Barrier Reef.

The graph in Figure 16.19 shows the projected increase of carbon dioxide in
the  ocean  and  the  resulting  decrease  in  ocean  pH  (rise  in  acidity). The  graph
shows  that  if  the  current  trend  of  human-induced  carbon  dioxide  emissions

continues, by  2100  the  ocean  will  experience  a  pH  decrease  of  at
least 0.3 pH unit; some studies indicate that pH could decrease by as
much as 0.5 pH unit. Even at the lower value, this reduction of pH
represents  a  change  in  ocean  chemistry  that  has  not  occurred  for
millions of years. An additional concern is that this increase in acid-
ity  will  eventually  be  transmitted  to  the  deep-ocean  floor  by  the
initiation  of  deep  currents  from  cold, dense  surface  waters. This  is
particularly  worrisome  because  the  organisms  that  inhabit  deep-
ocean habitats are adapted to its stable, unchanging environment.

Several factors influence the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed
by  the  oceans. Processes  involved  in  distributing  carbon  dioxide
within the ocean atmosphere system cause it to be divided unequally
between the two reservoirs. For example, carbon dioxide gas is read-
ily absorbed by the ocean and, as a result, the ocean contains a much
larger amount of carbon dioxide than the atmosphere.7 The amount of

FIGURE 16.20 Measured relative sea level rise from
tide gauges. Sea level data from (a) New York City,
New York, shows an increase of 40 centimeters (16 inches)
since 1850. Similar increases are shown in (b) San Francisco,
California, and (c) Honolulu, Hawaii. While some of the doc-
umented rise is due to local effects (for example, New York
is experiencing isostatic uplift after glaciation), the majority
is likely caused by the addition of water from the melting of
continental ice caps and glaciers as well as from thermal 
expansion of warmer ocean water.

carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean varies with the chemistry of seawater but also
has certain limits. Once the ocean approaches saturation of carbon dioxide, it will
absorb less of the gas, which means that more will remain in the atmosphere. As the
ocean warms, it will further reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that goes into the
oceans because warmer water can t hold as much dissolved gas. Another factor is
how rapidly deep waters mix with surface waters: The more rapid the mixing, the
more it facilitates the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. If deep-water
circulation slows as predicted, this will also slow the uptake of carbon dioxide from
the atmosphere. In essence, more of the carbon dioxide being released now will stay
in the atmosphere, where it will create additional human-caused warming.

Rising Sea Level
Analysis of worldwide tide records indicates that there has been a rise in global
sea  level  of  between  10  and  25  centimeters  (4  and  10  inches)  over  the  past
100 years. At  certain  tide-recording  stations  where  data  go  back  well  into
the 19th century, there  has  been  an  increase  in  relative  sea  level  of  as  much  as
40 centimeters (16 inches) over the past 150 years (Figure 16.20). More recently,
satellite altimeter data since 1993 indicate a global increase in sea level of about
3 millimeters (0.1 inch) per year (Figure 16.21).

Clearly, sea level is rising. Two main factors contribute to this global rise in sea
level: (1) thermal expansion of ocean water as it warms and (2) an increase in the
amount of water in the ocean from the melting of ice on land. Note that melting of
floating sea ice (such as in the Arctic Ocean) or floating ice shelves (such as those
that fringe Antarctica) does not contribute to sea level rise because that ice/water
is already in the ocean. More specifically, in order of their overall contribution to
the observed global rise in sea level (Figure 16.22), the main contributors are:

1. The melting of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets

2. The thermal expansion of ocean surface waters

3. The melting of land glaciers and small ice caps

4. The thermal expansion of deep-ocean waters

FIGURE 16.21 Sea level rise determined by satellites. Radar altimeter data from
TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 satellites combined with Argo drifting floats (inset; see also
Chapter 7) reveal that sea level rose 3 millimeters (0.1 inch) per year since 1993.
Researchers attribute about half of that increase to melting ice and the other half 
to thermal expansion as the ocean absorbs excess heat from the atmosphere.

An  additional  factor  that  affects  global  sea  level  is  the
storage of water on land in reservoirs. A recent study indi-
cates that the amount of this storage has varied but gener-
ally increased since 1900 and suggests that without reser-
voirs, sea level would have risen even more.

Although the current rate of sea level rise might seem
inconsequential, even a small amount of sea level rise can
severely  affect  regions  that  have  a  gently  sloping  shore-
line, such  as  the  U.S. Atlantic  and  Gulf  Coasts. Hazards
associated  with  sea  level  rise  include  drowning  of
beaches, accelerated  coastal  erosion, permanent  inland
flooding, alteration of coastal ecosystems, loss of  protec-
tive coastal wetlands, and increased damage from destruc-
tive  storms. Moreover, if  global  warming  increases  the
intensity  of  hurricanes, as  discussed  above, damage  to
coastal regions will be even greater.

FIGURE 16.22 Main components that contribute to
global sea level rise. Each line on this graph shows how
much each of the four main components contributes to over-
all sea level rise. The four components are (1) Antarctic 
and Greenland ice sheets, (2) glaciers and small ice caps,
(3) deep-ocean thermal expansion, and (4) surface water 
thermal expansion.

The  current  rate  of  global  sea  level  rise, though
small, is likely to increase as Greenland and Antarctic ice
sheets  experience  additional  warming  and  make  a  greater  contribution  to  sea
level rise. In fact, detailed studies of Antarctic ice thickness reveal that the rate
at which the ice is thinning near the coast has doubled since the 1990s. Neither
the  Greenland  or Antarctic  ice  sheets  are  likely  to  disappear  before  2100, but
there is the danger that global warming could trigger massive and catastrophic
discharges  of  ice  from  these  ice  sheets. A  recent  study  determined  that  if  the
West  Antarctic  Ice  Sheet  were  to  collapse, it  would  raise  global  sea  level  by
about 3.2 meters (10.5 feet).

According  to  recent  models, the  rate  of  sea  level  rise  will  increase  with
increased  global  warming. Studies  of  sea  level  rise  that  include  both  thermal
expansion  and  ice-sheet  contributions  project  a  rise  in  sea  level  by  2100  of
between 0.5 and 1.4 meters (1.6 and 4.6 feet), which is particularly worrisome for
low-lying  coastal  regions. In  addition, increased  amounts  of  human  settlement
and development in coastal regions compound the problem. And, projections sug-
gest that sea level may well rise by several meters in the next few hundred years.

Other Predicted Changes
Several other ocean changes are predicted to result from global warming. One is
the transmission of sound in the sea (see Box 16.1). A recent study indicates that
the increasing amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater makes it more effi-
cient at transmitting sound waves. Researchers predict that by 2050, ocean sounds
such as whale calls may travel 70% farther than today; the effect on marine ani-
mals is unknown.

Another ocean effect is lower dissolved oxygen in seawater. As discussed in
Chapter 12, dissolved oxygen in seawater is vital for most marine animals, which
extract dissolved oxygen directly from seawater. As the ocean warms, its ability to
hold and carry dissolved oxygen is diminished, while at the same time the meta-
bolic rate of marine organisms increases, which means they need higher levels of
dissolved  oxygen. In  addition, warmer  surface  waters  will  limit  the  overturning
process  that  brings  oxygen  to  deep  waters. At  current  rates  of  carbon  dioxide
emissions, studies predict severe oxygen-depleted zones both at the surface and
into deeper waters for thousands of years. Reduced oxygen levels will likely have
dramatic  consequences  for  marine  ecosystems  and  coastal  regions  that  already
experience oxygen-depleted  dead zones (see Box 13.2).

Still another effect of ocean warming is the alteration of oceanic productivity,
which has implications for the distribution of essentially all marine organisms. As
ocean  surface  waters  warm, ocean  stratification  will  increase  and  a  stronger

  plant, planktos

Warmer waters can also affect marine organisms directly. Many types of phy-
toplankton and other organisms are very sensitive to changes in water tempera-
ture. For  example, a  large  study  of  phytoplankton  in  the  North Atlantic  shows
that  ocean  warming  has  increased  the  abundance  of  phytoplankton  in  cooler
regions and decreased them in warmer waters. A recent study off California docu-
ments a decrease in cool-water organisms caused by a deep, penetrative warming
not observed in the past 1400 years. In these organisms  place, there has been a
boost  in  the  population  of  25  fish  groups  that  prefer  warmer  waters  as  surface
waters have shifted from cold to warm temperatures over recent decades.

In response to rising ocean temperatures, marine organisms have also begun
to migrate into deeper waters and toward the poles. As verification of this trend, a
recent  study  of  fish  species  in  the  North  Sea  suggests  that  many  commercially
important  fish, such  as  cod, whiting, and  anglerfish, have  shifted  northward  as
much as 800 kilometers (500 miles). The report notes that if these climate trends
continue, some species of fish may withdraw completely from the North Sea by
2050. Changes  such  as  these  have  severe  implications  for  the  health  of  marine
ecosystems and the sustainability of marine fisheries.

Finally, there  is  great  concern  amongst  the  scientific  community  that  the
human-induced greenhouse effect may bring unpleasant surprises such as abrupt
changes in Earth systems that could not have been predicted.

16.5 What Should Be Done to Reduce

Greenhouse Gases?

The  consensus  of  scientific  studies  suggest  that  the  planet  has  warmed  due  to
human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, scenarios for future warming
look bleak. For example, if human-caused emissions remain at or near their cur-
rent rate of increase, atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to exceed 500 parts
per  million  sometime  between  2050  and  2100, causing  global  temperatures  to
increase  by  at  least  2°C  (3.6°F)  and  more  likely  by  about  5°C  (9°F). Based  on
paleoclimate data, these values of atmospheric carbon dioxide and global temper-
ature significantly exceed those of at least the past 420,000 years.

Recently, there have been serious discussions about deliberately manipulat-
ing  Earth s  climate  system  to  counteract  human-caused  global  warming  and
its unwanted  effects. These  manipulations
called  global  engineering, or
are very controversial. Some of the concerns about any type of
geoengineering
global  engineering  include  the  justification  for  intentionally  altering  any  of
Earth s  systems  on  a  global  scale, the  possibility  of  harmful  side  effects, who
should  pay  for  its  implementation, and  whether  it  would  have  to  be  constantly
maintained. In addition, skeptics of global engineering point out that it distracts
from perhaps the most immediate way of limiting human-caused climate change:
reducing the amount of greenhouse gases that are spewed into the atmosphere.

Most  global  engineering  proposals  fall  into  two  general  types: (1)  reducing
the  amount  of  sunlight  reaching  Earth  or  (2)  removing  human-caused  green-
house  gases  from  the  atmosphere  and  disposing  of  them  somewhere  else.
Examples of the first type include spraying sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere

or  installing  thousands  of  reflective  sunshades  in  orbit

include removing atmospheric carbon dioxide and plac-
ing  it  into  subsurface  layers  within  Earth  or  into  the
deep ocean.

In this section, we ll examine how the oceans natu-
rally counteract global warming, how the ocean system
reduces greenhouse gases, and what potential solutions
exist.

The Ocean s Role in Reducing Global
Warming
Because  the  oceans  naturally  absorb  vast  amounts  of
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the oceans there-
fore play a vital role in reducing the greenhouse effect.
In  fact, the  vast  majority  of  carbon  dioxide  in  the
ocean atmosphere system is found in the ocean because
carbon dioxide is approximately 30 times more soluble in
water  than  are  other  common  gases. Currently, a  little
less than half of the carbon dioxide humankind releases
into the atmosphere stays there; about a third enters the
oceans with the rest absorbed by land plants.

THE  OCEAN S  BIOLOGICAL  PUMP What  happens  to
the  carbon  dioxide  that  enters  the  ocean?  Most  of  it  is  incorporated  into
organisms  through  photosynthesis  and  through  their  secretion  of  carbonate
shells. Moreover, carbon dioxide is cycled very effectively from the atmosphere to
the ocean. In fact, more than 99% of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere
in  the  geologic  past  by  volcanic  activity  has  been  removed  by  the  ocean  and
deposited  in  marine  sediments  as  biogenous  calcium  carbonate  and  fossil  fuels.
Thus, the ocean acts as a repository (or sink) for carbon dioxide, soaking it up and
removing it from the environment as sea floor deposits. This process of removing
material  from  sunlit  surface  waters  to  the  sea  floor  is
called  a  biological  pump because  it  pumps
carbon
dioxide  and  nutrients  from  the  upper  ocean  and
concentrates  them  in  deep-sea  waters  and  sea  floor
sediments (Figure 16.23).

K E Y   C O N C E P T
The ocean plays a key role in reducing atmospheric
greenhouse gases through its biological pump; it 
also minimizes global warming by acting as a 
thermal sponge.

THE  OCEAN  AS  A  THERMAL  SPONGE Due  to  its
unique  thermal  properties,9 water  can  absorb  large
quantities  of  heat  without  much  change  in  temperature.
Thus, the thermal properties of the ocean make it ideal for
minimizing  the  increase  in  global  temperature. Further,
the oceans serve as the planet s biggest single reservoir for
surplus energy. If not for the oceans, the planet would be
experiencing  a  much  greater  increase  in  temperature. In
essence, the oceans act as a  thermal sponge, absorbing
heat  but  not  increasing  much  in  temperature  and  so
minimize  the  amount  of  warming  experienced. Even  so,
recent studies have documented that the heat content of
the oceans has been increasing (Figure 16.24).

The Oceans and Climate Change

Possibilities for Reducing Greenhouse Gases
There is much debate about what to do about the increasing human-caused emis-
sions  in  the  atmosphere. One  idea  is  to  eliminate  human  emissions  before  they
even get into the atmosphere. Other proposals involve using the oceans to reduce
the amount of human-caused emissions in the atmosphere. Let s examine two of
these proposals.

THE IRON HYPOTHESIS Stimulating productivity in the ocean has been proven
to  remove  carbon  dioxide  from  the  atmosphere. Through  photosynthesis,
phytoplankton such as diatoms convert carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean to
carbohydrate and oxygen gas. By capturing and removing additional amounts of
carbon dioxide from the ocean, the ocean can, in turn, absorb more heat-trapping
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thus cooling the planet.

Areas of the ocean that have relatively low productivity, such as in the trop-
ics, are  a  good  place  to  stimulate  productivity  and  thus  increase  the  amount  of
carbon  dioxide  removed  from  the  atmosphere. In  1987, oceanographer  John
Martin determined that the absence of the essential nutrient iron limited produc-
tivity in tropical oceans, so he proposed fertilizing the ocean with iron to increase
its  productivity. Give  me  a  half  a  tanker  of  iron  and  I ll  give  you  the  next  ice
age, Martin  once  famously  quipped. Subsequently, this  idea  became  known  as
the iron hypothesis (Figure 16.25). In 1993, Martin s associates tested the idea by
adding a soluble solution of finely ground iron to a small patch of ocean near the
Galápagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Their results, combined with the results of
about  a  dozen  other  open-ocean  experiments  worldwide  since  1993, confirmed
that  adding  iron  to  the  ocean  increased  phytoplankton  productivity  up  to  30
times. In fact, some of the patches of iron-enriched high productivity were visible
to Earth-orbiting satellites.

FIGURE 16.25 The iron hypothesis. Seeding the ocean
with the essential nutrient iron stimulates productivity and
draws in heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
that is used by phytoplankton. Some of this carbon dioxide,
tied up as tissue or in fecal pellets, sinks toward the sea floor,
thereby removing it from the environment. Photo (inset)
shows a view from a research vessel involved in applying
finely-ground iron to the ocean near Antarctica.

Although the results from these small-scale open-ocean experiments proved
that the iron hypothesis did indeed draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,
the scientists had to overcome problems grinding the iron fine enough, dispersing the
iron, and keeping it in solution for long periods of time. A more serious problem,
however, is the long-term global environmental effects of increasing the amount
of carbon dioxide in the ocean and stimulating biological productivity. For exam-
ple, there  is  concern  that  severe  oxygen  depletion  of  seawater  could  occur  in
areas where iron fertilization is conducted because the large population of algae
that is produced eventually dies and decomposes, thus consuming dissolved oxy-
gen. In addition, decomposition releases byproducts such as carbon dioxide and
nitrous oxide both important greenhouse gases. As discussed previously, higher
amounts of carbon dioxide in the ocean lead to increased ocean acidity, which is a
problem for marine life and marine ecosystems. Another problem is from inter-
ference with the natural ecology of large oceanic regions
and its unforeseeable
consequences. Nevertheless, even larger open-ocean experiments have been pro-
posed  and  several  private  companies  have  filed  patents  for  ocean-fertilization
technologies to enable ocean fertilization to occur on a commercial scale.

SEQUESTERING  EXCESS  CARBON  DIOXIDE  IN  THE  OCEANS Successful
experiments  have  involved  capturing  emissions  either  before  they  are  released
into the atmosphere or directly from the atmosphere and then pumping the gas
into the deep ocean or underground reservoirs. This process
called sequestering
 depository) carbon dioxide thereby removes carbon dioxide from
(sequester
the atmosphere and, as a result, reduces global warming. If the deep ocean is used
as  a  disposal  site  for  carbon  dioxide, however, there  are  concerns  about  how  it
would impact deep-sea chemistry and, as a result, marine ecosystems. In addition,
it is unclear how long the sequestered carbon dioxide will stay in the deep ocean
because  of  deep-water  circulation  patterns. However, the  capture  of  carbon
dioxide emissions and their subsequent disposal into deep reservoirs beneath the
sea floor is already occurring at a handful of test sites worldwide.

The Kyoto Protocol: Limiting Greenhouse Gas
Emissions
The mounting scientific evidence that global warming and some of its side effects are
occurring has led to international efforts to address the human contribution to the
greenhouse effect. A number of international conferences have resulted in an agree-
ment  among  60  nations  to  voluntarily  limit  greenhouse  gas  emissions. This  agree-
ment, which is called the Kyoto Protocol (because it was created at an international
conference held in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan), sets target reductions for each country. For
example, industrialized countries (such as the United States, which constitutes only
about 5% of world population but is responsible for about 20% of worldwide car-
bon dioxide emissions10) are to reduce their collective emission of six greenhouse
gases by at least 5% by 2012 compared to 1990 levels. Although 122 nations (repre-
senting  44%  of  the  total  worldwide  carbon  dioxide  emissions)  have  ratified  the
treaty, the U.S. government has withdrawn its support for the protocol, citing poten-
tial harm to the world economy.

In late 2009, an international agreement reached at a meeting of delegates from
both  industrialized  nations  and  major  emerging  economies  at  the  United  Nations
Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, formally recognized a man-
date  to  curb  human-induced  greenhouse  gas  emissions. The  accord  cites  a  goal  of
holding the global rise in average global temperatures to 2ºC (3.6ºF) but does not
specify a long-term method for reducing emissions.

10China, which is a highly populated and rapidly industrializing country, recently surpassed the
United States as the leading carbon dioxide emitter worldwide. The United States is currently second,
with India and Russia next.

What can I do to help with the problem of global
warming?

Even though global warming is a worldwide problem,
there  are  many  things  concerned  individuals  can  do
to help curb greenhouse gas emissions:

1. Drive smart: Tune  up  your  car  and  drive  with

properly inflated tires.

2. Write your politicians: Urge  them  to  raise  fuel

economy standards for vehicles.

3. Go green: Support clean, renewable, non-fossil-fuel

energy sources.

4. Switch lights: Replace  incandescent  light  bulbs

with energy-efficient compact fluorescent bulbs.

5. Check your house: Insulate  and  weather-strip;

ask your utility company for a free energy audit.

6. Become  a  smart  water  consumer: Turn  your

water heater down and use low-flow faucets.

7. Buy energy-efficient electronics and appliances:
Replace  older,  inefficient  refrigerators  and  air
conditioners.

8. Plant a tree, protect a forest: Preserve  plant

communities, which absorb carbon dioxide.

9. Reduce, reuse, and recycle: Support  recycling 

efforts by choosing recycled products.

10. Educate and vote: Educate  others  and  support

measures that encourage energy conservation.

Note that these measures are all sound practices for
preserving the environment that make sense no mat-
ter what the future levels of global warming might be.

Chapter 16

The Oceans and Climate Change

Even  if  greenhouse  gas  concentrations  stabilized  today, with  no  additional
increases, the planet would continue to warm by about 0.6°C (1°F) over the next
century  because  it  takes  years  for  Earth s  climate  system  to  fully  react  to
increases in greenhouse gases. This future warming is often referred to as Earth s
commitment to warming. Based on plausible emissions scenarios, the IPCC esti-
mates that average surface temperatures could rise between 2°C and 6°C (3.6°F
and 10.8°F) by the end of the 21st century. Scenarios that assume that people will
burn even larger amounts of fossil fuels than we do today give warming estimates
in  the  top  end  of  this  temperature  range, while  the  scenarios  that  assume  that
greenhouse gas emissions will grow slowly or not increase at all suggest a much
smaller amount of warming. Not since the end of the last ice age 10,000 years ago,
when Earth warmed by about 5°C (9°F), has the average temperature changed as
dramatically as the change that scientists are predicting in less than 100 years.

At this point, it is very clear that human activities

such as burning fossil fuels,
releasing  emissions, and  land  use  changes are  altering  the  environment  on  a
global scale. Although the changes cannot be completely eliminated, many human
impacts can be reduced. For instance, activities that affect the environment most
severely such as the high rate of consumption of fossil fuels and their subsequent
harmful emissions need to be decreased. In addition, plant communities must be
preserved and much of what has already been removed by deforestation must be
replaced in order to halt further damage. Finally, a high priority must be placed on
research that improves our understanding of how Earth s climate system works.

K E Y   C O N C E P T
Possibilities for reducing greenhouse gases include
adding iron to the ocean to stimulate productivity
and absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere;
sequestering excess carbon dioxide in the deep
ocean; and limiting greenhouse gas emissions.

Chapter in Review

Earth s climate system includes the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere,
biosphere, and  cryosphere (the  ice  and  snow  that  exists  at  Earth s  sur-
face). This  system  involves  exchanges  of  energy  and  moisture that  occur
among  the  five  spheres. Both  positive-feedback  loops that  reinforce
changes  and  negative-feedback  loops that  counteract  changes  modify
Earth s climate.

Paleoclimatology, the  study  of  Earth s  past  climate, uses  proxy  data,
which consist of natural recorders of past climate, including sea floor sedi-
ments, glacial  ice, fossil  pollen, tree-growth  rings, and  information  con-
tained in historical documents.

Several  explanations  have  been  formulated  to  explain  Earth s  climate
change. Current hypotheses for natural factors (causes unrelated to human
activities) of climate change include changes in the Sun s output associated
with sunspots, variations in Earth s orbit, volcanic activity, and movement of
Earth s tectonic plates. Although natural mechanisms have altered climate
in the  past, recent climate change is  greater than can  be explained by  any
natural factors.

Assessment  reports  published  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on
Climate Change (IPCC) clearly document that the current climate changes
observed on Earth are due primarily to human activities that release heat-
trapping greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere.

The increase in average worldwide temperature is called global warming.
Although  the  warming  of  Earth s  surface  and  atmosphere  is  a  natural
process  controlled  by  the  greenhouse  effect, it  is  also  being  altered  by
human greenhouse gas emissions, a phenomenon that is often referred to
as the enhanced greenhouse effect.

infrared  (heat)  region. Water  vapor, carbon  dioxide, methane, and  other
trace gases absorb infrared radiation and thus heat the atmosphere.

Earth s  average  surface  temperature  has  warmed  over  the  past  century
and  there  is  strong  evidence  that  it  is  due  primarily  to  human-caused
increases  of  certain  heat-trapping  gases  such  as  carbon  dioxide  and
methane. Models predict that there will be a strong warming of high north-
ern latitudes, a moderate warming of middle latitudes, and relatively little
warming in low latitudes. Other predicted changes caused by global warm-
ing  include  changes  in  the  length  of  seasons, more  intense  heat  waves,
changes in both average and extreme temperature and precipitation, retreat
of mountain glaciers, alteration of the range of infectious diseases, and shifts
in the distribution of plants and animals.

Changes  that  have  been  observed  in  the  oceans  due  to  global  warming
include increased ocean temperatures, more intense hurricane activity, changes
in deep-water circulation, melting of polar ice, increase in ocean acidity, and
rising sea level. These changes in the ocean will continue for centuries.

The ocean removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by its biological
pump, which pumps carbon dioxide into sea floor deposits. The ocean also
acts  as  a  thermal  sponge  by  soaking  up  excess  heat  from  the  atmosphere,
thereby minimizing the amount of warming experienced.

The ocean can be used as a repository for some of society s carbon diox-
ide  emissions through  either  the  iron  hypothesis, which  stimulates  phyto-
plankton  productivity  with  the  addition  of  finely  ground  iron, or  through
sequestering  excess  carbon  dioxide  by  pumping  it  directly  into  the  deep
ocean. However, the effect that these proposals might cause in the ocean is
largely unknown.

The greenhouse effect is produced by incoming sunlight that changes in
wavelength, thus  heating  Earth. Energy  reaching  Earth  from  the  Sun  is
mostly  in  the  ultraviolet  and  visible  regions of  the  electromagnetic  spec-
trum, whereas energy radiated back to space from Earth is primarily in the

The Kyoto Protocol establishes limits on greenhouse gas emissions, but
the United States has not agreed to support it because of potential harm to
the economy. Nevertheless, there is already a commitment to warming and
various scenarios can be used to predict the amount of future warming.

In the end, we will conserve only what we

At the end of our journey through this book together, it seems fit-
ting to examine people s perceptions of the ocean. Many people
describe  the  ocean  as  powerful,
awe  inspiring, moving,
infi-
nite, or  boundless. These are  all  appropriate  descriptions, be-
cause even though humans have been exploring and studying the
ocean for centuries, the ocean still holds many secrets. The oceans
are constantly surprising researchers with unusual features, newly
discovered  species, and  geologic  wonders  that  exist  within  its
watery world.

Despite the ocean s impressive size, it is beginning to feel the
effects  of  human  activities. For  instance, every  ocean  contains
large  areas  of  floating  plastic  and  even  remote  beaches  are  lit-
tered with trash. Organisms living in the ocean also feel the effect
of humankind s use of the ocean. Whaling in the 19th and 20th
centuries, for example, pushed many great whale populations to
near extinction. Restrictions on whaling and the development of
substitutes for whale products helped whales survive this threat,
but  now  they  face  destruction  of  their  feeding  and  breeding
grounds. Overfishing, however, more than any other human ac-
tivity, has  altered  the  marine  ecosystem, suggesting  that  the
ocean  is  not  quite  as  vast,
infinite, or  boundless as  most
people believe.

Humans  have  become  one  of  the  most  important  agents  of
change on the planet. This is largely due to our rapidly expand-
ing  human  population  (Figure  Aft.1). Today, nearly  7  billion
people  occupy  the  planet, and  births  now  exceed  deaths  by
about two and a half times. At the present rate of population in-
crease which  sounds  small  enough, at  about  1.1%, but  pro-
duces  truly  staggering  numbers
there  are  more  than  2  new
people  on  the  planet  each  second, or  about  9000  more  people
each  hour. Each  year  there  are  about  77  million  more  of  us, a
total equal to the combined populations of the six largest cities
in  the  world  (Mumbai, Shanghai, Karachi, Delhi, Istanbul, and
São  Paulo). The  number  of  people  has  quadrupled  since  1900
and is expected to peak at about 9.2 billion around 2050. Clear-
ly, our  burgeoning  human  population  is  the  greatest  environ-
mental threat of all.

Human-induced changes in the marine environment are broad
and far-reaching. Examples include pollution, shoreline develop-
ment, overfishing, introduction of non-native species, biodiversity
decline, ecosystem degradation, and perhaps most serious of all,
climate change. In 2008, a study of the cumulative impact of 17 of

7 billion people and is increasing at a rate of over 1% per year.

the most urgent land- and ocean-based threats to worldwide ma-
rine ecosystems shows that no areas of the ocean are untouched
by human activities. The study revealed that fully one-third of the
oceans are strongly affected by multiple factors and that the most
heavily impacted ecosystems are continental shelves, rocky reefs,
coral reefs, seagrass beds, and deep-sea seamounts. However, the
report notes that large areas of relatively little human impact re-
main, particularly near the poles.

Several  U.S. commissions  have  suggested  ways  to  protect  the
marine environment. In 2003, for example, the Pew Oceans Com-
mission  recommended  significant  changes  aimed  at  guiding  the
way in which the federal government should manage American s
marine environment. In 2004, the U.S. Commission on the Oceans
submitted 212 recommendations for a coordinated and compre-
hensive national ocean policy. In 2008, the Joint Ocean Commis-
sion issued a report card assessing the nations  collective progress
in  ocean  policy  during  2007  (its  overall  grade: a  C, with  some
categories receiving a  D ). These commissions urge an integrat-
ed  research  and  education  ecosystem-based  management  ap-
proach  to  support  ocean  environmental  health  and  resource
sustainability. Another  recommendation  is  the  establishment  of
marine protected areas.

MARINE PROTECTED AREAS

A N T A R C T I C A

FIGURE AFT.2 Marine protected areas. Worldwide, over 4000 marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established,
offering various levels of protection to living, nonliving, cultural, and/or historic resources. MPAs cover less than 
1% of the world ocean.

What Are Marine Protected
Areas?

Concerns about the health and longevity of the oceans have led to
the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), which cover a
wide range of marine areas with some level of restriction to protect
living, nonliving, cultural, and/or  historic  resources  (Figure Aft.2).
MPAs  can  be  established  for  a  multitude  of  reasons: to  protect  a
certain species, to benefit fisheries management, or to protect full
ecosystems, rare  habitat, or  nursing  grounds  for  fish. MPAs  are
also established to protect historical sites such as shipwrecks and
important cultural sites such as aboriginal fishing grounds. MPAs
can be very large (for example, Australia s 2000-kilometer [1200-
mile] Great Barrier Reef) or very small (for example, Italy s tiny
coastal  Marina  Protetta  Capo  Rizzuto). Because  the  term  MPA
has been used widely around the globe, its meaning in any one re-
gion may be quite different than in another. MPAs offer various
levels of protection that include areas designated as marine sanc-
tuaries, marine reserves, special protected areas, marine parks, no-
take refuges, and areas of special conservation, all of which have
specific types of restrictions associated with them as defined by the
laws of the governing body.

Studies have shown that MPAs can help increase biodiversi-
ty, protect habitats, and aid in the recovery of fish populations
when  placed  and  managed  effectively. While  MPAs  may  not
solve all of the issues that threaten various parts of the ocean,
they have been shown to help restore marine ecosystems on a
local scale and act as buffers to larger-scale impacts.

In 1972, the U.S. Congress began establishing a type of MPA
called  a  national marine  sanctuary to  protect  vital  pockets  of
the ocean from further degradation. Today, 14 national marine
sanctuaries  cover  more  than  47,000  square  kilometers  (18,000
square miles) in areas such as the Florida Keys, the Stellwagen
Bank off Massachusetts, the Channel Islands off Southern Cali-
fornia, the Flower Garden Banks in the Gulf of Mexico, and the
Hawaiian  Islands  (Figure Aft.3). Many  activities  that  degrade
the  marine  environment, however, are  still  allowed  in  marine
sanctuaries, such as fishing, recreational boating, and even min-
ing of some resources.

Many  scientists  who  recognize  the  importance  of  preserving
vital  marine  habitats  are  calling  for  governments  to  more  fully
protect marine areas by establishing large no-take refuges called
marine reserves in which fishing and other activities are prohibited.
Such  action  would  allow  the  recovery  of  heavily  overfished

ocean resources, too. A healthy coral reef, for exam-
ple, can  be  worth  more  as  a  tourist  draw  than  it
might be as a source of seafood.

Although  the  oceans  are  feeling  the  effects  of
human activities, their huge size and physical prop-
erties  make  them  very  resilient  and  give  them  a
tremendous  ability  to  withstand  change. For  exam-
ple, studies  reveal  that  when  human  impact  is  re-
duced, ocean  areas  often  return  to  a  near  pristine
state  because  natural  ocean  processes  tend  to  dis-
perse  and  eventually  remove  many  types  of  pollu-
tants. The vast majority of ocean water, moreover, is
still  relatively  unpolluted, except  in  shallow-water
coastal areas near large population centers and near
the mouths of major rivers.

What Can I Do?
Because the ocean is vast and capable of absorbing
many  substances, it  has  been  used  as  a  dumping
ground for many of society s wastes. Even today, hu-
mans are adding pollutants to the ocean at stagger-
ing rates. What can each of us do to help? Some ways
to help the environment in general and the ocean in
particular include the following:

Minimize your impact on the environment. Reduce
the amount of waste you generate by making wise
consumer  choices. Avoid  products  with  excessive
packaging  and  support  companies that  have  good
environmental  records. Use  non-toxic  or  less  haz-
ardous  products  around  the  house. Conserve  re-
sources. Reuse  and  recycle  items, then  help  close
the  recycling  loop  by  buying  goods  made  of  recy-
cled materials. Do simple things that make a posi-
tive impact on the environment (Box Aft.1).

stocks and protect sea floor communities decimated by trawling
the  sea  floor  with  nets. In  2006, for  example, the  United  States
established  the  360,000-square-kilometer  (139,000-square-mile)
Northwest Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument, creat-
ing  the  world s  largest  marine  reserve  at  the  time. The  reserve,
which  has  been  renamed  the  Papaha-naumokua-kea  Marine  Na-
tional  Monument, was  eclipsed  in  size  by  the  Phoenix  Islands
Protected Area, which was established in 2008 and is the size of
California.

Worldwide, more  than  4000  marine  reserves  exist, but  they
still cover less than 1% of the world ocean. And, proper enforce-
ment within these  no-take reserves remains an issue. Although
the commercial and recreational fishing industries have histori-
cally  opposed  creating  marine  reserves, research  indicates  that
marine reserves  spill over and provide benefits to surrounding
regions by boosting certain populations of commercially impor-
tant  fish  outside  their  borders. Marine  preserves  also  protect
large fish and so help restore the natural predator-prey relation-
ships of healthy, self-sustaining ecosystems. Other countries are
beginning  to  realize  the  economic  benefit  of  fully  protecting

Become politically aware. Many ocean-related issues come be-
fore  the  public  and  require  a  majority  of  voters  to  approve  a
proposal before they are enacted into law. This  majority rules
is true for local as well as national and international issues.
Within  our  lifetimes, for  instance, we  may  very  well  decide
whether to spend large amounts of money to add finely ground
iron  to  the  ocean  to  reduce  the  amount  of  carbon  dioxide  in
the atmosphere. Many political issues in the future will involve
the ocean.

Educate  yourself  about  how  the  ocean  works. A  recent  poll
indicates that more than 90% of the American public consider
themselves  scientifically  illiterate. With  our  society  becoming
more scientifically advanced, people need to understand how
science operates. Science is not meant to be comprehended by
an  elite  few. Rather, science  is  for  everyone. By  studying
oceanography, you have begun  to  understand  how  the  ocean
works. It is our hope that you will be a lifelong student of the
ocean. And if you are considering participating in the scientific
study of the oceans, more details on working in marine science
can be found in Appendix V, Careers in Oceanography.

TEN SIMPLE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO HELP PREVENT MARINE POLLUTION

Nobody made a greater mistake than he who
did nothing because he could only do a little.

EDMUND BURKE (circa 1790)

There are many simple things you can do
every  day  to  help  prevent  marine  pollu-
tion, such as the following:

1. Snip  plastic  six-pack  rings. Plastic
six-pack rings entangle many marine
organisms, so  snip  each  circle  with
scissors before you toss them into the
garbage or, better yet, recycle them
along  with  the  cans  or  bottles  to
which  they  are  attached. If  you  find
any  at  a  beach, pick  them  up, snip
them, and recycle them, too.

laundry  detergent 

2. Use  lawn  fertilizers, yard  chemicals,
and 
sparingly.
Lawn  fertilizers  contain  nitrates  and
phosphates, which cause harmful algal
blooms when runoff from land enters
the ocean through storm drains. Deter-
gents also contain phosphates, so read
the  detergent  label  to  find  one  that 
is  phosphate  free  and  use  a  smaller
amount than recommended. Use yard
chemicals such as pesticides and weed
killers only when absolutely necessary.

3. Clean up after your pet. Dog and cat
feces  have  high  bacteria  levels. When

they wash into a stream or storm drain
and eventually to the ocean, they also
provide nitrates and phosphates, which
create harmful algal blooms.

4. Make  sure  your  car  doesn t  leak  oil.
Oil  that  leaks  from  automobiles  is
responsible  for  a  large  percentage 
of  the  oil  that  gets  into  the  ocean.
Annually, the  amount  of  oil  that  en-
ters  the  ocean  as  runoff  from  road
sources  (non-point-source  pollution)
through storm drains is greater than a
major  oil  spill. If  you  change  your
car s  oil  yourself, be  sure  to  recycle
the  used  oil  at  an  appropriate  recy-
cling center.

5. Drive less and carpool more. Reducing
the amount of gasoline you use reduces
the  amount  of  oil  that  must  be  trans-
ported  across  the  ocean, which  mini-
mizes the potential for oil spills.

6. Take  your  own  bags  to  the  grocery
store. Although  paper  bags  are
biodegradable, plastic  bags  are  not
and are becoming an increasing prob-
lem  in  the  ocean, especially  for  ani-
mals  like  sea  turtles  that  eat  plastic
bags when they mistake them for jel-
as
lyfish. That s  why  plastic  bags

well  as  Styrofoam  containers have
been banned in certain countries and
coastal communities.

7. Don t release balloons. Balloons that
are  released  far  from  the  ocean  can
still  wind  up  there, where  they  de-
flate, quickly lose their color, and re-
semble  drifting  jellyfish  that  marine
animals can ingest.

8. Don t litter. Any material that is care-
lessly  discarded  on  land  can  become
non-point-source  pollution  when  it
washes  down  a  storm  drain, into  a
stream, and eventually into the ocean.

9. Pick up trash at the beach or volunteer
for  an  organized  beach  cleanup. It  is
important to remove trash that washes
up  at  the  beach  so  it  can t  endanger
marine organisms. Trash arrives at the
beach  from  non-point-source  pollu-
tion, ships, recreational boaters, beach-
goers, and  other  sources. It  is  truly
surprising  (and  somewhat  horrifying)
to discover what ends up at the beach.

10. Inform  and  educate  others. Many
people are unaware that their actions
have  a  negative  influence  on  the
environment
especially  the  marine
environment.

APPENDIX I
METRIC AND ENGLISH UNITS COMPARED

How many inches are there in a mile? How many cups in a gal-
lon?  How  many  pounds  in  a  ton?  In  our  daily  lives, we  often
need to convert between units. Worldwide, the metric system of
measurement is the most widely used system. Besides the Unit-
ed  States, only  two  other  countries  in  the  world Liberia  and
Myanmar (formerly Burma)
still use English units as their pri-
mary system of measurement. The metric system has many ad-
vantages over the English system. It is simple, logical, and makes
conversion  between  units  easy. For  those  of  us  in  the  United
States, it is only a matter of time before the change to the metric
system occurs.

Benjamin  Franklin  was  one  of  the  first  to  propose  that  the
United States adopt the sensible metric system. Interestingly, the
United States was officially declared a metric nation by the Secre-
tary of the Treasury in 1893, but the idea was never embraced by
Americans.

On December 23, 1975, U.S. President Gerald R. Ford signed
the Metric Conversion Act of 1975. It defined the metric system
as the International System of Units (officially called the Système
International d Unités, [SI]) as interpreted in the United States by
the Secretary of Commerce. The Trade Act of 1988 and other leg-
islation  declared  the  metric  system  the  preferred  system  of
weights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce, called for the
federal government to adopt metric specifications, and mandated
the Commerce Department to oversee the program.

Although  the  metric  system  has  not  become  the  system  of
choice for most Americans  daily use, and there is great resistance
to using it, the United States must change over to remain compet-
itive in world markets. Many of the sciences are leading the way in
this changeover. In fact, oceanographers all over the world have
been using the metric system for years.

The English System
The English system actually consists of two related systems
the
U.S. Customary System1 (used in the United States and its depend-
encies)  and  the British  Imperial  System  (used  throughout Great
Britain). Ironically, Great Britain has now largely converted to the
metric system. The basic unit of length in the English system is the
yard; the basic unit of weight (not mass) is the pound.2

In the English system, the units of length were initially based
arbitrarily on dimensions of the body. The yard as a measure of
length, for example, can be traced to the early Saxon kings. They
wore a sash around their waists that could be used as a convenient
measuring  device. Thus, the  word  yard comes  from  the  Saxon

word  gird (like  a  girdle), in  reference  to  the  circumference  of  a
person s waist. The circumference of a person s waist varies from
person to person, however, and even varies from time to time on
the same person, so it is of limited use. It had to be standardized to
be  useful, so  King  Henry  I  of  England  decreed  that  the  yard
should be the distance from the tip of his nose to the end of his
thumb!

Romans  initially  defined  the  mile  (mille  passuum =  1000
paces) as an even 5000 feet. The early Tudor rulers in England,
however, defined a  furlong ( furrow-long ) as 220  yards, based
on  the  length  of  agricultural  fields. To  facilitate  the  conversion
between  miles  and  furlongs, Queen  Elizabeth  I  declared  in  the
16th century that the traditional Roman mile of 5000 feet would
be forever replaced by one of 5280 feet, making the mile exactly
8  furlongs. Today, a  furlong  is  an  archaic  unit  of  measurement 
(although still used in horse races), but a mile is still 5280 feet.

The Metric System
The metric system of weights and measures was devised in France
and adopted there in 1799. It is based on a unit of length called
the  meter and a unit of mass called the  kilogram. Originally de-
fined as one ten-millionth the distance from the North Pole to the
equator, the  meter  is  now  defined  as  the  distance  light  travels
through a vacuum in  1/299,792,458 second. The kilogram was origi-
nally related to the volume of one cubic meter of water. It is now
defined  as  the  mass  of  the  International  Prototype  Kilogram, a
precision-fabricated cylinder of platinum iridium alloy about the
size of a plum that is kept at Sèvres (near Paris), France, but work
is  currently  under  way  to  base  the  kilogram  on  a  fundamental
property of nature. Other metric units can be defined in terms of
the meter and the kilogram.

Fractions and multiples of the metric units are related to each
other  by  powers  of  10, allowing  conversion  from  one  unit  to  a
multiple  of  it  simply  by  shifting  the  decimal  point. The  lengthy
arithmetical operations required with English units can be avoided.
Even  the  names  of  the  metric  units  indicate  how  many  are  in  a
larger unit. For instance, how many cents are there in a dollar? It
is the same as the number of centigrams in a gram. The prefixes
listed in Table A1.1 have been accepted for designating multiples
and fractions of the meter, the gram (which equals 1/1000 of a kilo-
gram), and other units.

Despite many fears that changing to the metric system will be
an economic burden on businesses in the United States, the con-
version  has  already  begun. Examples  include  35-millimeter  film,

1The names of the units and the relationships between them are generally the
same  in  the  U.S. Customary  System  and  the  British  Imperial  System, but  the
sizes of the units differ, sometimes considerably.

2 Mass
is  commonly  equated  with  weight, but  technically  the  mass of  an
object refers to the amount of matter in it, whereas its  weight
is caused by the
gravitational  attraction  between  the  object  and  Earth. Furthermore, the  basic
unit of mass in the English system is the slug, although it is rarely used.

2-liter soft drink bottles, 750-milliliter wine bottles, computers with
gigabytes of memory, and 10-kilometer runs. Cars are now manu-
factured metrically in order to compete with other countries. Most
people in the United States will experience the increasing use of
the metric system in their daily lives. Some ways to ease yourself
into this unfamiliar (yet sensible) system of units include noticing
distances on road signs in kilometers, using a meterstick instead of
a yardstick, and charting your weight in kilograms.

Temperature Scales
The Celsius (centigrade) temperature scale was invented in 1742
by  a  Swedish  astronomer  named Anders  Celsius. The  scale  was
designed so that the freezing point of pure water
the tempera-
ture  at  which  it  changes  state  from  a  liquid  to  a  solid is  set  as 
0 degrees. Similarly, the boiling point of pure water
the temper-
is set at 100
ature at which it changes state from a liquid to a gas
degrees. Doing so made the liquid range of water
0 degrees to
100 degrees
an even 100 units, giving the scale its name: centi-
grade (centi = 100, grade = graduations).

The  Fahrenheit  temperature  scale, on  the  other  hand, sets
water s freezing and boiling points at 32 degrees and 212 degrees,
respectively, for a spread of 180 units. This scale was devised by a
German-born  physicist  named  Gabriel  Daniel  Fahrenheit, who
invented the mercury thermometer in 1714. He initially designed
the scale so that normal body temperature was set at 
How-
ever, because  of  inaccuracies  in  early  thermometers  or  how  the
scale  was  initially  devised, normal  human  body  temperature  is
now known to be 98.6°F 

100°F.

APPENDIX III
LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE ON EARTH

Suppose that you find a great fishing spot or a shipwreck on the
sea  floor. How  would  you  remember  where  it  is
far  from  any
sight of land so that you might return? How do sailors navigate
a ship when they are at sea? Even using sophisticated equipment
such  as  the  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS), which  uses  satel-
lites to determine location, how is this information reported?

To  solve  problems  like  these, a  navigational  grid a  series  of
intersecting lines across a globe is used. Once starting places are
fixed for a grid, a location can be identified based on its position
within the grid. Some cities, for example, use the regular number-
ing of streets as a grid. Even if you have never been to the inter-
section  of  5th  Avenue  and  42nd  Street  in  New  York  City, you
would be able to locate it on a map, or know which way to travel
if you were at 10th Avenue and 42nd Street. Although many grid
(or coordinate) systems are used today, the one most universally
accepted uses latitude and longitude.

A  series  of  north south  and  east west  lines  that  together  com-
prise a grid system can be used to locate points on Earth s surface
whether at sea or on land.The north south lines of the grid are called
meridians and extend from pole to pole (Figure A3.1). The meridian
lines converge at the poles and are spaced farthest apart at the equa-
tor. The east west lines of the grid are called parallels because they

are  parallel  to  one  another. The  longest  parallel  is  the  equator (so
called because it divides the globe into two equal hemispheres), and
the parallels at the poles are a single point (Figure A3.1).

Latitude and Longitude
Latitude  is  the  angular  distance  (in  degrees  of  arc)  measured
north or south of the starting line (the equator) from the center of
Earth. All points that lie along the same parallel are an identical
distance from the equator, so they all have the same latitude. The
latitude  of  the  equator  is  0  degrees, and  the  North  and  South
Poles lie at 90 degrees north and 90 degrees south, respectively.
Figure A3.2 shows that the latitude of New Orleans is an angular
distance of 30 degrees north from the equator.

Longitude is the angular distance (in degrees of arc) measured
east  or  west  of  the  starting  line  from  the  center  of  Earth. All
meridians are identical (none is longer or shorter than the others,
and they all pass through both poles), so the starting line of longi-
tude has been chosen arbitrarily. Before it was agreed upon by all
nations, different countries used different starting points for 0 de-
grees longitude. Examples include the Canary Islands, the Azores,
Rome, Copenhagen, Jerusalem, St. Petersburg, Pisa, Paris, and

FIGURE A3.1 Earth s grid system. Earth s grid system is composed of
parallels (which extend east west and are measured north or south of 
the equator) and meridians (which extend north south and are measured
west or east of the Prime Meridian). Parallels are lines of latitude while
meridians are lines of longitude. Note that while all meridians are the
same length, the parallels are not (the longest parallel is the equator).

FIGURE A3.2 Location of New Orleans. New Orleans is located at 
30 degrees north latitude and 90 degrees west longitude. Note the angles
of each relative to the center of Earth.

Philadelphia. At  the  1884  International  Meridian  Conference, it
was  agreed  that  the  meridian  that  passes  through  the  Royal
Observatory at Greenwich, England, would be used as the zero or
starting  point  of  longitude. This  zero  degree  line  of  longitude  is
also called the Prime Meridian, and the longitude for any place on
Earth is measured east or west from this line. Longitude can vary
from 0 degrees along the Prime Meridian to 180 degrees (either
east or west), which is halfway around the globe and is known as
the  International  Date  Line. As  shown  in  Figure  A3.2, New
Orleans is 90 degrees west of the Prime Meridian.

A particular latitude and longitude defines a unique location
on Earth, provided the direction from the starting point is given,
too. For instance, 42 degrees north and 120 degrees west defines
a  unique  spot  on  Earth  because  it  is  different  from  42  degrees
south and 120 degrees west and from 42 degrees north and 120
degrees east.

A degree of latitude or longitude can be divided into smaller
units. One degree ( ) of arc (angular distance) is equal to 60 min-
utes 
of arc.
When  using  a  small-scale  map  or  a  globe, it  may  be  difficult  to
estimate latitude and longitude to the nearest degree or two.When
using a large-scale map, however, it is often possible to determine
the latitude and longitude to the nearest fraction of a minute.

Determination of Latitude 
and Longitude
Today, latitude and longitude can be determined very precisely by
using  satellites  that  remain  in  orbit  around  Earth  in  fixed  posi-
tions. How  did  navigators  determine  their  position  before  this
technology was available?

Latitude was determined from the positions of particular stars.
Initially, navigators  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  measured  the
angle between the horizon and the North Star (Polaris), which is
directly above the North Pole. The latitude north of the equator is
the angle between the two sightings (Figure A3.3). In the South-
ern Hemisphere, the angle between the horizon and the Southern
Cross was used because the Southern Cross is directly overhead
at the South Pole. Later, the angle of the Sun above the horizon,
corrected for the date, was also used.

There was no method of determining longitude until one based
on  time  was  developed  at  the  end  of  the  18th  century. As  Earth
turns  on  its  rotational  axis, it  moves  through  360  degrees  of  arc
every 24 hours (one complete rotation on its axis) (Figure A3.4a).
Earth, therefore, rotates through 15 degrees of longitude per hour
360 degrees , 24 hours = 15 degrees per hour
(
). As  a  result, a
navigator needed only to know the time at the prime or Greenwich
meridian (Figure A3.4b) at the exact same time the Sun was at its
highest point (local noon) at the ship s location. In this way, a navi-
gator aboard a ship could calculate the ship s longitude each day at
noon. That s why the development of John Harrison s chronometer
(see Box 1.2 in Chapter 1) was so crucial for navigation.

Suppose  a  ship  sets  sail  west  across  the Atlantic  Ocean  from
Europe, checking its longitude each day at noon local time. One
day when the Sun is at the noon position (noon local time), the

have a latitude of 0°. The maximum latitude 

is 90° at the north and south geographic

poles where the axis of Earth's 
rotation intersects its surface.

chronometer  reads  16:18  hours  (0:00  is  midnight  and  12:00  is
noon). What is the ship s longitude (Figure A3.4c)?

If  the  clock 

is  keeping  good  time  (which  Harrison s
chronometer did), then we know that the ship is 4 hours and 18
minutes  behind  (west  of)  Greenwich  time. To  determine  the
longitude, we  must  convert  time  into  longitude. Each  hour
represents  15  degrees  of  longitude  based  on  the  rotation  of
Earth. Thus, the  four  hours  represents  60  degrees  of  longitude 

(4 hours * 15 degrees of longitude + 60 degrees). One degree is
divided into 60 minutes of arc, so Earth rotates through 1/4 degree
of arc per minute of time. Thus, 18 minutes of time multi-
15*
plied by 15 minutes of arc per minute of time equals 270 minutes
1
of  arc. To  convert  270  minutes  of  arc  into  degrees, it  must  be
divided by 60 minutes per degree, which gives 4.5 degrees of lon-
gitude. Therefore, the  answer  is  60  degrees  plus  4.5  degrees, or
64.5 degrees west longitude.

A CHEMICAL BACKGROUND: WHY WATER HAS 2 H S AND 1 O

An  element  (elementum =  a  first  principle)  is  a  substance  com-
prised entirely of like particles that cannot be broken into smaller
particles by chemical means. The atom (a = not, tomos = cut) is
the smallest particle of an element that can combine with similar
particles of other elements to produce compounds. The periodic
table of elements shown in Figure A4.1 lists the elements and de-
scribes their atoms. A compound (compondre = to put together)
is a substance containing two or more elements combined in fixed
proportions. A molecule (molecula = a mass) is the smallest parti-
cle of an element or compound that, in the free state, retains the
characteristics of the substance.

As  an  illustration  of  these  terms, consider  Sir  Humphrey
Davey s  use  of  electrical  dissociation  to  break  the  compound
water into its component elements, hydrogen and oxygen. Atoms
of  the  elements  hydrogen  (H)  and  oxygen  (O)  combine  in  the
proportion  2  to  1, respectively, to  produce  molecules  of  water
H2O
As  an  electric  current  is  passed  through  the  water, the
molecules  dissociate  into  hydrogen  atoms  that  collect  near  the
1
cathode  (negatively  charged  electrode)  and  oxygen  atoms  that
collect near the anode (positively charged electrode). Here they
combine to form the diatomic gaseous molecules of the elements
hydrogen 
Because  there  are  twice  as
many  hydrogen  atoms  as  oxygen  atoms  in  a  given  volume  of
water, twice as many molecules of hydrogen gas 
as oxygen
gas 
are formed. Further, the volume of gas under identical
conditions  of  temperature  and  pressure  is  proportional  to  the
number  of  gas  particles  (molecules)  present, so  two  volumes  of
hydrogen gas are produced for each volume of oxygen gas.

A Look at the Atom
Building  on  earlier  discoveries, the  Danish  physicist  Niels  Bohr
(1884 1962) developed his model of the atom as a small solar sys-
tem in which a positively charged nucleus takes the place of the
Sun and the planets that orbit around it are represented by nega-
tively charged electrons. Although this model has since been dia-
grammatically  altered, it  is  still  commonly  used  to  demonstrate
the arrangement of electrons and nuclear particles in the atom.

Bohr s earliest concern was with the atom of hydrogen, which
he  considered  to  consist  of  a  single  positively  charged  proton
(protos = first) in its nucleus orbited by a single negatively charged
electron  (electro =  electricity). Since  the  mass  of  the  electron  is
only about 1/1840 the mass of the proton, it will be considered neg-
ligible in our discussion of atomic masses.

According to the Bohr model, the number of protons or units
of positive charge in the nucleus
coincides with the atomic num-
ber of the element. Thus hydrogen, with an atomic number of 1,
has a nucleus (nucleos = a little nut) containing a single proton.
Helium, the next heavier element, having an atomic number of 2,
contains  two  nuclear  protons, and  so  forth. The  atomic  number

also  indicates  the  number  of  electrons  in  a  normal  atom  of  any
element, because this number is equal to the number of protons
in the nucleus (Figure A4.2).

An isotope (isos = equal, topos = place) is an atom of an ele-
ment  that  has  a  different  atomic  mass  than  other  atoms  of  the
same  element. As  we  will  see, chemical  properties  of  atoms  are
determined by the electron arrangement that surrounds the nu-
cleus. This arrangement, in turn, is determined by the number of
protons  in  the  nucleus. Because  some  isotopes  have  different
atomic  masses  but  identical  chemical  characteristics, there  must
be a nuclear particle in the nucleus other than the proton that can
influence the atomic mass of an atom but does not affect the elec-
tron structure surrounding the nucleus (Figure A4.3).

Nuclear  research  has  discovered  the  additional  particle, the
neutron (neutr = neutral) which was postulated by Ernest Ruther-
ford in 1920 and was first detected by his associate James Chad-
wick in 1932. It has a mass very similar to that of the proton but
no electrical charge. This characteristic of being electrically neu-
tral  has  made  it  one  of  the  particles  most  utilized  by  nuclear
physicists, who  continue  to  explore  the  atomic  nucleus  and  to
make  new  discoveries  of  nuclear  particles. We  will  not  consider
these particles, as knowledge of them is not necessary for our un-
derstanding of the chemical nature of atoms.

An atom of a given element can be changed to an ion of that
element by adding or taking away one or more electrons, and it is
changed to an isotope of the element by  adding or taking away
one or more neutrons. Adding or taking away one or more pro-
tons will change the atom to an atom of a different element.

The  atom  can  be  divided  into  two  parts

the  nucleus, which
contains neutrons and protons, and the electron cloud surround-
ing the nucleus that is involved in chemical reactions. The random
motion of electrons makes it impossible to determine the precise
location of electrons in this cloud at any instant, but it is possible
to  estimate  the  most  probable  position  of  an  electron  in  this
cloud. The regions in which there would more likely be particular
electrons  can  be  viewed  as  concentric  spheres or  shells
that
surround the nucleus (see Figure A4.2).

Chemical Bonds
In  considering  the  chemical  reactions  in  which  atoms  are  in-
volved, we  will  be  concerned  primarily  with  the  distribution  of
electrons  in  the outer shell. When  atoms combine  to  form com-
pounds, they usually do so by forming one of two bonds:

1. Ionic (ienai = to go) bonds, where electrons are either gained or lost

2. Covalent (co = with, valere = to be strong) bonds, where electrons are

shared between atoms

Ionic bonding produces an ion, an electrically charged atom
that  no  longer  has  the  properties  of  a  neutral  atom  of  the

element it represents. A positively charged ion, a cation (kation =
something going down) is produced by the loss of electrons from
the outer shell, the positive charge being equal to the number of
electrons lost. A negatively charged ion, an anion (anienai = to
go up), is produced by the gain of electrons in the outer shell of
an  atom, and  its  charge  is  equal  to  the  number  of  electrons
gained.

An example of a compound formed by ionic bonding is com-
mon table salt, which is sodium chloride (Figure A4.4). In the for-
mation  of  this  compound, the  sodium  atom, which  has  one
electron in its outer shell, loses this electron and forms a sodium
ion  with  a  positive  electrical  charge  of  one. The  chlorine  atom,
which  contains  seven  electrons  in  its  outer  shell, completes  its
shell by gaining an electron and becoming a chloride ion with a
negative charge of one. These two ions are held in close proximity
by an electrostatic attraction between the two ions of equal and
opposite charge.

Moreover, it is the tendency of an individual atom to assume
the outer-shell electron content of the inert gases such as helium
(2), neon (8), and argon (8) that make it chemically reactive (see
Figure A4.2). Normally, if an atom can assume this configuration
by  either  sharing  one  or  two  electrons  with  an  atom  of  another
element or by losing or gaining one or two electrons, the elements
are highly reactive. By contrast, the elements are less reactive if
three or four electrons must be shared, gained, or lost to achieve
the desired configuration.

Valence (valentia = capacity) is the number of hydrogen atoms
with which an atom of a given element can combine with either
ionic or covalent bonds. Elements with lower valences of one or
two, for  example, combine  chemically  in  a  more  highly  reactive
manner than do those with higher valences of three or four or, in

certain instances, more than four. Although those elements with
higher valences do not react as violently as low-valence elements,
they have a greater combining power and can gather about them
larger  numbers  of  atoms  of  other  elements  than  can  the  atoms
with lower valence values.

An example of a covalent bond is the sharing of electrons by
hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the water molecule (Figure A4.5).
In the formation of this molecule, both hydrogen atoms and the
oxygen  atom  assume  the  inert  gas  configuration  they  seek  by
sharing electrons.

CAREERS IN OCEANOGRAPHY

Many  people  think  a  career  in  oceanography  consists  of  swim-
ming with marine animals at a marine life park or snorkeling in
crystal-clear tropical waters studying coral reefs. In reality, these
kinds of jobs are extremely rare and there is intense competition
for  them. Most oceanographers  use science  to answer  questions
about the ocean, such as the following:

What is the role of the ocean in limiting the climate change?

What kinds of pharmaceuticals can be found naturally in ma-
rine organisms?

How does sea floor spreading relate to the movement of tec-
tonic plates?

What economic deposits are there on the sea floor?

Can rogue waves be predicted?

What  is  the  role  of  longshore  transport  in  the  distribution  of
sand on the beach?

How does a particular pollutant affect organisms in the marine
environment?

Preparation for a Career 
in Oceanography
Preparing yourself for a career in oceanography is an interesting
and rewarding, yet difficult, path to travel. The study of oceano-
graphy is typically divided into four different academic disciplines
(or subfields) of study:

Geological  oceanography is  the  study  of  the  structure  of  the
sea floor and how the sea floor has changed through time; the
creation of sea floor features; and the history of sediments de-
posited on it.

Chemical oceanography is the study of the chemical composi-
tion and properties of seawater; how to extract certain chemi-
cals from seawater; and the effects of pollutants.

Physical  oceanography is  the  study  of  waves, tides, and  cur-
rents;
the  ocean atmosphere  relationship  that  influences
weather and climate; and the transmission of light and sound in
the oceans.

Biological oceanography is the study of oceanic life forms and
their  relationships  to  one  another; adaptations  to  the  marine
environment; and  developing  ecologically  sound  methods  of
harvesting seafood.

Other disciplines include ocean engineering, marine archaeology,
and marine policy. Oceanography is an  interdisciplinary science
because  it utilizes  all the disciplines  of  science as they apply  to
the oceans. Some of the most exciting work and best employment
opportunities combine two or more of these disciplines.

Individuals  working  in  oceanography  and  marine-related
fields need a strong background (typically an undergraduate de-
gree) in at least one area of basic science (for example, geology,
physics, chemistry, or biology) or engineering. In almost all cases,
mathematics  is  required  as  well. Marine  archaeology  requires  a
background in archaeology or anthropology; marine policy stud-
ies  require  a  background  in  at  least  one  of  the  social  sciences
(such as law, economics, or political science).

The ability to speak and write clearly as well as critical thinking

are  prerequisites  for  any  career. Fluency  in  computers

skills
preferably  PC  systems, not  Macintosh is  rapidly  becoming  a
necessity. Because  many  job  opportunities  in  oceanography  re-
quire trips on research vessels (Figure A5.1), any shipboard expe-
rience  is  also  desirable. Mechanical  ability  (the  ability  to  fix
equipment  while  on  board  a  vessel  without  having  to  return  to
port)  is  a  plus. Depending  on  the type  of  work  that is  required,

FIGURE A5.1 Oceanographers at work on a research vessel.

other traits that may be desirable include the ability to speak one
or more foreign languages; certification as a scuba diver; the abil-
ity to work for long periods of time in cramped conditions; physi-
cal  stamina; physical  strength; and  a  high  tolerance  to  motion
sickness.

Oceanography is a relatively new science (with much room left
for  discovery), so  most  people  enter  the  field  with  an  advanced
degree (master s or doctorate). Work as a marine technician, how-
ever, usually requires only a bachelor s degree or applicable expe-
rience. It does take a large commitment to achieve an advanced
degree  but, in  the  end, the  journey  itself  is  what  makes  all  the
hard work worthwhile.

Job Duties of Oceanographers
There  has  been  and  will  continue  to  be  enormous  expansion  in
the number of ocean-related jobs. Job opportunities for oceano-
graphers  exist  with  scientific  research  institutions  (universities),
various government agencies, and private companies that are en-
gaged in searching for economic sea floor deposits, investigating
areas for sea farming, and evaluating natural energy production
from waves, currents, and tides. The duties of oceanographers vary
from job to job but generally can be described as follows:

Geological oceanographers and geophysicists explore the ocean
floor  and  map  submarine  geological  structures. Studies  of  the
physical and chemical properties of rocks and sediments give us
valuable information about Earth s history. The results of their
work  help  us  understand  the  processes  that  created  the  ocean
basins and the interactions between the ocean and the sea floor.

Chemical  oceanographers  and  marine  geochemists investigate
the chemical composition of seawater and its interaction with
the  atmosphere  and  the  sea  floor. Their  work  may  include
analysis of seawater components, desalination of seawater, and
studying the effects of pollutants. They also examine chemical
processes operating within the marine environment and work
with  biological  oceanographers  to  study  living  systems. Their
study of trace chemicals in seawater helps us understand how
ocean currents move seawater around the globe, and how the
ocean affects climate.

Physical  oceanographers investigate  ocean  properties  such  as
temperature, density, wave  motions, tides, and  currents. They
study ocean atmosphere relationships that influence weather and
climate, the  transmission  of  light  and  sound  through  water, and
the  ocean s  interactions  with  its  boundaries  at  the  sea  floor 
and the coast.

Biological  oceanographers, marine  biologists, and  fisheries
scientists study marine plants and animals. They want to un-
derstand  how  marine  organisms  develop, relate  to  one  an-
other, adapt  to  their  environment, and  interact  with  their
environment. They  develop  ecologically  sound  methods  of
harvesting  seafood  and  study  biological  responses  to  pollu-
tion. New fields associated with biological oceanography in-
clude  marine  biotechnology  (the  use  of  natural  marine
resources in the development of new industrial and biomed-
ical products) and molecular biology (the study of the structure

such as DNA,
and function of bioinformational molecules
and the regulation of cellular processes
RNA, and proteins
at  the  molecular  level). Because  marine  biology  is  the  best
known field of oceanography (and because the larger marine
animals have such wide appeal), it is currently the most com-
petitive, too.

Marine  and  ocean  engineers apply  scientific  and  technical
knowledge  to  practical  uses. Their  work  ranges  from  designing
sensitive instruments for measuring ocean processes to building
marine  structures  that  can  withstand  ocean  currents, waves,
tides, and  severe  storms. Subfields  include  acoustics; robotics;
electrical, mechanical, civil, and chemical engineering; as well as
naval  architecture. They  often  use  highly  specialized  computer
techniques.

Marine archaeologists systematically recover and study materi-
al  evidence, such  as  shipwrecks, graves, buildings, tools, and
pottery remaining from past human life and culture that is now
covered by the sea. Marine archaeologists use state-of-the-art
technology to locate underwater archaeological sites.

Marine policy experts combine their knowledge of oceanogra-
phy and social sciences, law, or business to develop guidelines
and policies for the wise use of the ocean and coastal resources.

Other  job  opportunities  for  oceanographers  include  work  as
science journalists specializing in marine science, teachers at vari-
ous grade levels, and aquarium and museum curators.

REPORT FROM A STUDENT/OCEANOGRAPHER

Appendix V

515

One  of  the  true  pleasures  of  teaching  is
that some of your students become so in-
terested  in  the  subject  matter  you  teach
that they pursue a career in it. One of Al
Trujillo s  former  students, Joseph  Fell-
McDonald  (Figure  A5A), works  as  a
ranger and interpretive specialist on Maui
for  the  State  of  Hawaii s  Department  of
Land and Natural Resources, Division of
Forestry  and  Wildlife, Natural  Area
Reserve System. Joe writes,

Aloha:

My career in oceanography-related work has fol-
lowed a long and sinuous path. After high school I
attended a trade school for mechanical engineer-
ing,  where  I  learned  how  to  fix  cars  and  build
houses. With this background, I worked in indus-
try for many years yet I had a yearning for some-
thing  satisfying,  enjoyable,  and  well-paid. 
I
bounced  from  place  to  place  and  job  to  job  not
really settling on a career but beginning to realize
that I enjoyed a lifestyle near the world s oceans
where I could surf, swim, lounge, and play. Living
in various coastal areas nearly my whole life, I was
always amazed at the interaction of the oceans. I
decided  fixing  and  building  things  was  not  for
me. So I looked into colleges and attended nearby
Palomar Community College in California, where I
took many courses in geography, geology, and bi-
ology.  I  also  enrolled  in  an  oceanography  course
and realized how important the oceans are to life
in general. It was during this time that it hit me: I
longed for a career in ocean science!

Because I was formally trained in mechanical
engineering and construction, I knew I could get
a job just about anywhere. I decided to give the
island of Maui a try just after finishing my courses
in  oceanography.  There  was  no  formal  work  in
oceanography here so I applied for a job as a ves-
sel mechanic  at  a  local  eco-tour  company.  The
company offered volunteer opportunities, includ-
ing photo identification and public interpretation
of  the  seasonal  humpback  whales  that  migrate
to Maui  each  year.  The  one  thing  I  realized
on Maui was that not one organization be it a
government  branch,  non-profit  organization,  or
company could  control,  regulate,  or  even  un-
derstand the broad basis of the world s oceans. I
became fascinated with my surroundings and vol-
unteered at many places, realizing my best attrib-
ute was an understanding of Earth s terrain and
oceanic  interactions.  I  volunteered  and  studied
native  coastal  restoration projects and  got  hired
by  a  local  botanical  garden  to  promote  native
Hawaiian plants and Hawaiian plant restoration.

FIGURE A5A Former oceanography student Joseph
Fell-McDonald (at far right on vessel and inset) at
work in the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale 
National Marine Sanctuary, Maui, Hawaii.

I was then recruited to help restore a high ero-
sion  area  at  a  National  Marine  Sanctuary.  The
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration
(NOAA)  Hawaiian 
Islands  Humpback  Whale
National  Marine  Sanctuary  (sister  sanctuary  to
Monterey  Bay)  hired  me  to  do  building  mainte-
nance, coastal dune restoration, vessel repair for sci-
entific exploration, and general public liaison. I was
asked  to  assist  with  the  National  Marine  Fisheries
Service in helping stranded marine life particularly
the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), which often
strands  itself  when  it  succumbs  to  disease and
habitat restoration and monitoring of the critically
endangered  hawksbill  turtle  (Eretmochelys  imbri-
cata). I also became involved with rescuing stranded
Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi) and
entangled humpback whales (Megaptera novaean-
gliae). I credit my success to a full-rounded educa-
tion, being open to new opportunities, volunteer-
ing, and lots of hard work.

I currently work as a ranger for the State of
Hawaii s  Department  of  Land  and  Natural
Resources,  Division  of  Forestry  and  Wildlife,
Natural  Area  Reserve  System  (NARS).  The  NARS
program  is  the  highest  level  of  protection  that
Hawaii can offer its lands. I work on Maui at the
Ahihi-Kinau  Natural  Area 
and
Surrounding  State  Protected  Lands  Kenioio  and
Makena.  We  follow  recommendations  by  resi-
dents  and  local  native  Hawaiian  kapuna  (elders)
to bring conservation back to Ahihi-Kinau. Much
of  my  work  is  enforcement  of  protection  laws,
although I do a fair amount of public education,

Reserve 

restoration, cultural inventory, biologic surveying,
and other protection of natural resources. The re-
serve is approximately 2000 land acres and about
800 marine protected acres out to a water depth
of  100  fathoms.  I  patrol  the  area  via  four-wheel
drive vehicle, jet ski, ATV, and even on horseback.
The  most  common  question  I  get  asked  is,

How  does  someone  get  a  job  like  yours?

Truthfully,  I  wake  up  with  a  smile  on  my  face
every day and enjoy the location, pay, and bene-
fits. Sometimes it  can be  a  tough and demand-
ing job but I actually enjoy it. For many people,
it is hard to believe that studying a broad range
of sciences can lead to an enjoyable and fulfill-
ing  career.  I  also  met  my  wife  and  companion
here,  who  was  working  as  a  marine  biologist
with  the  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service.  Due  to
my  compassion  and  deep  understanding  of  a
broad range of sciences, I was able to apply my
education, experience, and curiosity into the ca-
reer  of  my  dreams.  I  encourage  anyone  who
wants to learn more about natural resources or
careers on Maui to contact me.
