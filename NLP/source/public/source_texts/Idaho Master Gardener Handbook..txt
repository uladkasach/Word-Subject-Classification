Introduction and Policies
Idaho Master Gardener Program Guidelines
University of Idaho Extension’s Idaho Master Gardener Training Program

Susan M. Bell, Extension Educator, Ada County, Boise

The University of Idaho (UI) Extension’s Idaho

Master Gardener Program gives gardeners an oppor-
tunity not only to improve their horticultural knowl-
edge and skills but also to serve their communities.
“Helping people grow” is the motto of the program.
University of Idaho Extension (UI Extension) con-
ducts the Idaho Master Gardener Program through
participating county offices in Idaho under the di-
rection of UI Extension educators.

I. University of Idaho Extension

UI Extension is an educational resource partner-

ship that extends research and technology to the
people of Idaho. UI Extension helps people help
themselves by bridging gaps between research and
everyday problems.

Mission: The mission of UI Extension is to pro-
vide informal educational programs to help Idaho
residents improve their economic status and quality
of their lives. The UI College of Agricultural and
Life Science’s mission is to support economic
growth and enhance the quality of life for the people
of Idaho by: (1) preparing students to be innovative
leaders in a global society, (2) helping people im-
prove their lives through research-based education
and leadership development focused on issues and
needs, and (3) providing new knowledge to support
agriculture and enhance the understanding of natural
and human resources.

Background: Land-grant universities and UI

Extension were developed through three congres-
sional acts:

• The Morrill Act of 1862 created colleges and

universities to provide classical, scientific,
agricultural, and engineering education.

• The Hatch Act of 1887 expanded the educational

mandate of the colleges to include research.

• The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 established Co-

operative Extension to provide educational ser-
vices in all states.

Cooperative Extension is a national educational
network designed to extend technical expertise and
university research findings to people, which per-
mits them to improve their homes, families, farms,
businesses, and communities. Cooperative Exten-
sion is the largest and considered the most success-
ful educational organization in the world, and deliv-
ers programs that are modeled and duplicated
worldwide.

Funding: The word “Cooperative” in the title re-
sults from the three-way funding partnership among
local, state, and federal governments. In addition,
contributions of time, talent, and supplies from vol-
unteers, businesses, and private organizations enable
programs such as Idaho Master Gardener to operate.

Personnel: Over 60 county extension faculty,
based in 42 county extension offices and the Fort
Hall and Coeur d’Alene Indian Reservations, pres-
ently serve Idaho. Backed up by subject matter spe-
cialists, researchers, and support personnel at 10 re-
search and extension centers and on the UI campus,
UI Extension educators deliver programs throughout
the state. These professionals work with the people
of Idaho to address agricultural, natural resource,
youth, family, and environmental issues. Collabora-
tive relationships with countless agencies, groups,
and individuals make possible a vast array of inno-
vative educational programs. Idaho Master Garden-
ers are the second largest volunteer group (4-H is
the largest) with which Cooperative Extension
works in Idaho.

Idaho Master Gardener Volunteers: In Idaho

more than 1,000 experienced Master Gardeners vol-
unteer their time each year, with about 300 new gar-

Chapter 1, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

1 - 2

deners trained annually to be Idaho Master Garden-
ers. In partnership with the University of Idaho’s
College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, credit
and certificate courses are available to Idaho Master
Gardeners across the state.

 Administration: Idaho Master Gardener educa-
tional programs in Idaho are guided by UI Extension
educators from the University of Idaho as part of its
land-grant mission in cooperation with the Depart-
ment of Plant, Soil and Entomological Sciences at
the UI’s College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.
 All extension programs are administered through

four extension districts in Idaho: Northern (I),
Southwestern (II), Southcentral (III), and Eastern
(IV). Many programs are planned at the district
level in collaboration with volunteers.

II. Purpose

The UI’s Idaho Master Gardener Program is an
educational opportunity designed to meet the gar-
dening information needs of the community. The
program’s purpose is to provide technical assistance
and information in the area of home horticulture to
people in the community through qualified volun-
teers: Idaho Master Gardeners.

Applicants receive basic horticultural training on
a variety of topics. To become an Idaho Master Gar-
dener, the applicant must complete a minimum of
30 hours of classes and an additional minimum of
30 hours of practicum/hands-on training. Individuals
must receive a satisfactory grade on exams or must
demonstrate competency for the course content to
the satisfaction of the program coordinator. Return-
ing Idaho Master Gardeners may continue their
training annually after certification. Many counties
offer Advanced Idaho Master Gardener training.

The UI’s Idaho Master Gardener Program is

based on a philosophy of shared ownership. UI Ex-
tension educators, staff, and volunteers share vision,
ideas, and responsibilities for the program. How-
ever, the ultimate responsibility for the Idaho Master
Gardener Program is with UI Extension educators as
they are held legally accountable for operation of
the program.

III. Volunteer Commitment

The type of hands-on training chosen is based on

a mutual decision of the supervising UI Extension
educator and the Idaho Master Gardener trainee. At
least part of the volunteer hours of service must be

spent at or arranged through the county extension
office. Certified Idaho Master Gardeners share their
knowledge free with individuals, groups, at schools,
or in community service roles but may accept reim-
bursement for mileage and materials.

IV. Trade-Related Professionals

Industry professionals are welcome to extend or

supplement their knowledge and credentials through
UI training programs. However, professionals must
consider carefully the volunteer commitment to the
program. If volunteering is not feasible, reimburse-
ment for training and materials, or in-kind support
of the program may be negotiated. Since these are
volunteer programs, only a limited number of trade
applicants are accepted in any one training session.
It is inappropriate to solicit by any means for per-

sonal business or gain at or during University of
Idaho Extension volunteer meetings, training ses-
sions, or other functions.

V. Certification and Recertification

The applicant will receive certification upon suc-

cessful completion of the Idaho Master Gardener
classroom instruction, examinations, and hands-on
training. Certificates and identification badges that
verify program status and satisfactory program
completion are provided at the discretion of each
county Master Gardener Program. Certification as
an Idaho Master Gardener is valid for only one year.
When appropriate, recertification for additional
years is encouraged through the Advanced Idaho
Master Gardener course.

Individuals who completed Master Gardener
training in other states and choose to become an
Idaho Master Gardener must provide a letter of rec-
ommendation from their previous county or state
Master Gardener Program coordinator. In addition,
they must schedule an entrance interview with the
UI Extension educator or program coordinator re-
sponsible for the Idaho Master Gardener Program in
their county. In the interview they will mutually
agree to the necessary training to be certified in an
Idaho Master Gardener Program.

VI. Use of Title

The title “Master Gardener” is to be used only
and exclusively with University of Idaho Exten-
sion’s Idaho Master Gardener Program and not for
commercial purposes. Persons are expected to iden-

Chapter 1, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

1 - 3

tify themselves as participants in the Idaho Master
Gardener Program only when performing volunteer
work affiliated with the program. The training, ex-
perience, and certification gained in the Idaho Mas-
ter Gardener Program may be used and listed as
qualifications when seeking employment.

VII. Position Description/Application

Each Idaho Master Gardener must complete and
sign an Idaho Master Gardener application and op-
portunity contract (see pages 1-9 and 1-11) before
any volunteer work is begun. Read the position de-
scription as it outlines the requirements of the posi-
tion and the methods of supervision.

VIII. Fees

A nominal fee is charged to cover the cost of re-
source materials and other literature received during
Idaho Master Gardener training. Fees may vary
from one county to another.

IX. Training Dates and Locations

Contact your local University of Idaho Extension
office for specific time, dates, and location for Idaho
Master Gardener training.

X. College Credit

This is a certificate program of the University of

Idaho. Applicants accepted into the Idaho Master
Gardener Program may, for an additional fee, obtain
Continuing Education Units (undergraduate or
graduate credit) from the University of Idaho Col-
lege of Agricultural and Life Sciences. Contact the
Department of Plant, Soil and Entomological Sci-
ences academic unit through your UI Extension of-
fice for more information about this opportunity.
Extra classwork and/or practicum work may be

required for a satisfactory grade. Ask your county’s
Idaho Master Gardener Program coordinator.

XI. Impact and Accountability

UI Extension needs to know what you have done

as an Idaho Master Gardener in order to give you
credit for your volunteer service and measure the
effectiveness of the program. Use the Volunteer Ac-
tivity Record (see page 1-13) to keep track on an
ongoing basis of your volunteer contribution of
hours, activities, and contacts. “Hours” is the total
number of volunteer hours you have spent on Idaho
Master Gardener activities. “Contacts” refers to the
number of people you assist as a volunteer.

XII. Liability Insurance

Only authorized volunteers are entitled to the pro-

tection of the University of Idaho’s liability insur-
ance program. Authorized volunteers are persons
who have been asked to perform a specific function
by a UI employee with the authority to recruit assis-
tance. The volunteer is then protected only while
acting within the scope and course of this authorized
volunteer service.

To ensure that the liability insurance program

will respond to a claim against an alleged volunteer,
it is absolutely essential that the university be able
to document that the person was, in fact, appropri-
ately authorized and acting within the scope and
course of the requested service. To ensure documen-
tation of all bonafide authorized volunteers, please
follow these procedures:

1. Make sure a job description is on file for each
Idaho Master Gardener volunteer; the job de-
scription should include whether the volunteer
will be driving UI vehicles while performing
job duties. Identify the person to which each
volunteer position reports, and identify
whether the individual in that position is a UI
employee or another volunteer.

2. Volunteers, other than Idaho Master Garden-

ers, recruited individually by a UI volunteer or
employee for specific individual tasks must
have an individual agreement or letter of au-
thorization from the UI employee to be cov-
ered by liability protection.

3. Keep a list of names and positions for autho-
rized volunteers recruited, individually or in a
group, by another volunteer authorized to re-
cruit. Have both the volunteers who recruited
them, as well as the UI employee in charge of
the project, sign the list. Be sure that the job
descriptions for any volunteers authorized to
recruit others indicate that authority.

The purpose of all this is to have a clearly docu-

mentable chain identifying who was recruited, by
whom they were recruited, and what they were re-
cruited to do.

XIII. Workers’ Compensation Insurance
Workers’ compensation insurance is provided by
the Idaho State Insurance Fund for authorized vol-
unteers in public employment.

The definition of a volunteer for purposes of

workers’ compensation insurance is an authorized

Chapter 1, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

1 - 4

person approved by a UI department head who is
under the direction and control of that UI person in
the performance of volunteer duties. A roster of vol-
unteer person’s names, including dates and hours of
volunteer work, must be maintained by the UI de-
partment in order for workers’ compensation insur-
ance to be in effect.

XIV. Information Is Important

Whether through phone calls, home visits, plant
clinics, presentations, newsletters, emails, websites,
or other efforts, the information given out by Idaho
Master Gardener volunteers must be unbiased and
research-based; it must be accurate, current, and
when possible taken from University of Idaho Col-
lege of Agricultural and Life Sciences publications
and research. Our mandated focus and emphasis is
to extend the information being developed at the
University of Idaho or other land-grant universities
to the people of Idaho.

Use the UI horticultural publications listed in this

manual. They are available from your county’s UI
Extension office, or write Publications, University
of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho 83844-2240, call (208)
885-7982, fax (208) 885-4648, or email
calspubs@uidaho.edu. You can also check, and in
some cases download, the online publication and
video catalog on the UI Educational Communica-
tions website (http://info.ag.uidaho.edu).

XV. Recommendations

Idaho Master Gardeners are asked to use tact and

give constructive advice when advising home gar-
deners. Best results come from guiding people in
their decisions. In each case please give biological,
cultural, and chemical options for pest management.
Then encourage the clientele to choose the best op-
tion for themselves. Often there is more than one
solution to a pest problem.

Because we are the research-based division of the
university, it is sometimes necessary for Idaho Mas-
ter Gardeners to do the research on specific pest
concerns. Always check a minimum of three sources
that agree before giving out advice. Be sure of your
recommendation before you give it!

UI Extension’s Idaho Master Gardeners make
recommendations only in the areas of home horti-
culture, home vegetable and fruit culture, ornamen-
tals, turf, and tree and landscape care. They are not
expected to make recommendations in areas for

which they are not qualified. Questions concerning
the commercial green industry or commercial farm
crops should be referred to the county’s UI Exten-
sion educator.

When it is necessary to make recommendations
that include the use of chemicals (insecticides, her-
bicides, and fungicides), Idaho Master Gardeners
should follow published product labels and/or UI
recommendations. Cultural problems not specifi-
cally covered by UI recommendations may be
handled by suggesting treatments that an experi-
enced Idaho Master Gardener considers appropriate.
Refer questions about commercial pest control to
the county’s UI Extension educator.

XVI. Volunteer Service Opportunities

Idaho Master Gardeners assist in many areas of

the community through demonstration gardens, hor-
ticulture classes, landscape design, information
booths, and at the UI Extension office. Below is a
sample list of some practicum opportunities in
which Idaho Master Gardeners are involved.

through with your commitments and responsi-
bilities. Call if you will be delayed or cannot
be there.

2. Maintain a friendly, warm, courteous attitude

toward the public.

3. Communicate effectively with clients, staff,
fellow volunteers, and faculty. Be a capable
and positive team member.

4. Be cooperative with the volunteers of other

Extension volunteer programs. We are all on
the same team.

5. If you have not received enough information

about your volunteer assignment, take the time
to ask more questions before beginning a task.
6. Accuracy is important and greatly appreciated.
7. Dress appropriately for the volunteer activity

in which you are involved.

8. Be sure to make your child care arrangements
for the time you have committed to work as a
volunteer. In some cases, it is not appropriate
for safety or security reasons to bring children
to certain events or activities.

9. Follow UI Extension affirmative action poli-
cies, which forbid discrimination against any-
one because of their race, color, gender, na-
tional origin, religion, age, or disability.

10. Enjoy your volunteer time. Volunteering is

rewarding and satisfying.

XVIII. Termination of Volunteer Services
You are a representative of University of Idaho
Extension and as such have agreed to abide by its
policies and expectations. If your behavior is not
acceptable or not in the best interests of UI Exten-
sion, the volunteer program, or our clientele you
may be reprimanded or asked to leave the program.

The following behaviors observed at or on the

premises of any program or function, or while you
are acting as a UI Extension volunteer, will not be
tolerated:

• Criminal acts
• Profanity

•

Illegal or inappropriate use of mind-altering
substances (alcohol or drugs)

• Harassment
• Discrimination
• Abuse of any kind toward a fellow human
The above actions may constitute cause for disci-

plinary action or immediate dismissal.

XIX. Master Gardeners in Other

Counties, States, and Countries

The Idaho Master Gardener Program is now oper-

ating in over 20 Idaho counties. Some counties ac-
cept and train Master Gardeners from other coun-
ties. Those Master Gardeners who are trained in
Idaho return their time in the counties where they
are trained or by arrangement with the UI Extension
educator in the county where they reside. Before
out-of-county applicants are accepted into an Idaho
Master Gardener Program, the UI Extension office
in your resident county is contacted and arrange-
ments are made concerning the administration of
your volunteer activities. It is important to recognize
that each county program is different and has differ-
ent resources available to implement the program.
As an Idaho Master Gardener you will be on the

county’s Idaho Master Gardener mailing list and
will receive all the mailings for one year after
completion of your training. You will continue to
receive these mailings as long as you recertify and
remain active. You are invited to all functions, ac-
tivities, and educational programs as well.

Every two years there is an International Master
Gardener Conference. You are eligible to join the
national and international Master Gardener organi-
zations as a certified Idaho Master Gardener. Usu-
ally in even years a Western Regional Master Gar-
dener Conference is held, which is a source of great
ideas to bring back to your communities. Take ad-
vantage of these opportunities and ask at your UI
Extension office for conference information.

XX. Volunteer Benefits

As a UI Extension Idaho Master Gardener volun-

teer, you have many benefits. One major benefit is
becoming part of a national volunteer network.
Whether you live in Idaho or in another part of the
country, you are part of UI Extension as a volunteer.
You have use of the resources of the system and can
be a resource to others.

Chapter 1, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

1 - 6

This networking benefit includes your fellow
Idaho Master Gardeners and the faculty and re-
search facilities at the University of Idaho. You are
welcome on campus. Tours of plant science facili-
ties and all the research and extension centers can be
arranged.

This networking benefit also includes other vol-
unteers such as 4-H Leaders, Master Food Preserv-
ers, Master Clothing Teachers, and commodity
groups. Another benefit is reduced prices or free ad-
mittance to seminars, classes, and workshops that
need volunteer help.

Idaho Master Gardener volunteers benefit by in-
creasing leadership, organizational, decision mak-
ing, and problem solving skills. Experienced volun-
teers report that they have made lasting friendships,
increased their public relation skills, become more
effective at work or home, and have been well pre-
pared for new employment or other volunteer op-
portunities.

UI Extension faculty and staff benefit by acquir-

ing fresh, new ideas and gaining satisfaction from
reaching more people through volunteer efforts.
They gain an increased understanding of the com-
munity and clientele, while achieving greater influ-
ence and increasing their own confidence in pro-
grams such as the Idaho Master Gardener training.
And, last but not least, there are certain tax ben-
efits to volunteers who itemize state and federal in-
come tax returns. Since these may change annually,
you will need to update what kinds of expenses are
deductible and what are not.

XXI. You Are Important

Each volunteer is vital to the success of our pro-
gram—no matter what kind of volunteer work you
do. There is no such thing as a small or unimportant

job. You bring skills that are unique and special,
that really add to the educational effort in your area.
You are a valuable part of our team.

Each year counties try to recognize the special
things you do. Your name badge is recognition of
your educational accomplishment. Wear it with
pride. You are important to us!

I. Divisions of Plant Sciences

III. Plant Classification

Plant science embraces several plant-related sci-

ences:

• Agriculture is the study of plants in relation to

field crop production.

• Agronomy is the science of crop management

and includes the study of soils.

• Horticulture is the science of growing fruits,

vegetables, flowers, and other ornamental
plants.

• Botany is the science that studies all phases of

plant life and growth.

A thorough understanding of botany is necessary
to understand the other plant sciences. Master Gar-
deners need botanical knowledge in order to use
correct terminology when referring to plant parts
and plant identification and to understand why and
how plants live, grow, and respond to their environ-
ment.

II. Divisions of Botany

The science of botany has many subject areas:
• Plant physiology deals with the functioning,

their mechanisms of response, and the physical
and biochemical processes of plants.

• Morphology deals with the origin and function

of plant parts while anatomy considers plant
structures.

• Taxonomy deals with plant classification and

naming.

• Plant ecology is the study of the complex rela-
tionships of plants in biological communities.

• Plant geography studies the distribution of

plants throughout the world.

• Plant pathology is the study of plant diseases.

Plant classification and the scientific naming of

plants help us identify plants exactly. The plant clas-
sification system groups plants with similar charac-
teristics together and then creates sub-groups with
more similar characteristics. Within those sub-
groups more subdivisions or groupings are made by
getting even more specific. This process continues
until a single plant with unique characteristics is
named.

A. Plant Groups and Sub-Groups:

1. Kingdom (plants)
2. Division (seed plants, non-seed plants)
3. Sub-divisions (angiosperms, gymnosperms)
4. Class (monocot, dicot)
5. Order (a large group of like individuals)
6. Family
7. Genus
8. Species
9. Variety or cultivar

Master Gardeners usually work with the classifi-
cation of plants at the family level and below. The
common names of plants are often not precise
enough to identify them exactly. Sometimes a com-
mon name refers to two or more entirely different
plants. Only scientific nomenclature allows an exact
understanding of which plant is being discussed.

B. Family

In a family of plants, similarities occur prima-
rily among its members’ flowers but also
leaves and other plant parts. For example, the
rose family, Rosaceae, includes members of
the genera Rosa (rose), Malus (apple), Prunus
(plum), Frageria (strawberry), and many oth-
ers. They all have similar flowers with five

Chapter 2, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

2 - 2

petals and many stamens. Some other large
families are Asteraceae (sunflowers),
Ranunculaceae (buttercup), Poaceae (grasses),
and Fabaceae (pea and bean family).

C. Genus

Genus is a subdivision of family and the plants
of the same genus share similarities mostly in
flower characteristics and genetics. Plants in
one genus usually cannot breed with plants in
another genus.

D. Species

Species is a group of individual plants inter-
breeding freely and having many (or all) char-
acteristics in common.

E. Variety, Cultivar, and Hybrid

1. Variety

A plant growing in the wild within a species
that is different in some particular character-
istic from other members of that species. A
variety, when grown from seed, will main-
tain all of its particular characteristics.

2. Cultivar

This word is a contraction of cultivated
variety. Propagation of cultivars results in
little or no genetic change in the offspring,
which preserves desirable characteristics. If
propagated asexually or vegetatively, culti-
vars are termed clones, and if propagated by
seeds they are termed lines. Seeds of clones
will not produce plants with the same desir-
able characteristics as the cultivar. Cultivars
are generally selected by botanists and hor-
ticulturists and maintained under cultiva-
tion.

3. Hybrid

A hybrid results from a cross between two
different species or well-marked varieties
within a species. Hybrids grown in a garden
situation will not breed true-to-form from
their own seed. For example, supersweet
hybrid corn cannot be reproduced by saving
seed from this year’s crop. The seed will
produce a different type or several different
types of corn, but none will have all the
characteristics of the original hybrid plants.

F. Nomenclature

1. As an example, the complete classification

of the Black Chokecherry is:
Planta
Kingdom:
Division:
Spermotophyta
Sub-division: Angiospermae
Class:
Dicotoledonae
Rosales
Order:
Rosaceae
Family:
Genus:
Prunus
Species:
virginiana
Variety:
melanocarpa

The genus, species, and variety names ap-
pear either in italics or underlined. The first
letter of the genus name is capitalized; but
the species and variety are written in all
lower case letters.

2. Cultivars are indicated by placing the culti-

var name in single quotation marks or by
preceding the cultivar name with the abbre-
viation cv. (do not use both). The first letter
of the cultivar name is capitalized, but the
name is not italicized or underlined. An ex-
ample is the Colorado blue spruce, Picea
pungens ‘Glauca’ or Picea pungens cv.
Glauca.

3. Hybrids created intentionally, or by crossing
in nature (natural interbreeding), are desig-
nated with an “x” between the genus and
species. An example is Forsythia x
intermedia, which is a cross between F.
suspensa and F. viridissima.

4. A binomial name is a plant’s genus and spe-

cies and may be followed by the initial of
the authority for describing and naming the
plant. For example, Solanum tuberosum L.
indicates that Carl von Linne (Linnaeus), a
Swedish physician, described and named
the white (Irish) potato. Linnaeus proposed
a system of nomenclature for plants in 1732
based primarily on flowers and/or reproduc-
tive parts. This system has persisted to the
present day.

IV. Plant Classification According to Life

Cycle
Plants are also classified by life cycle (e.g., how

long it takes a plant to develop from a seed to a
flowering plant).

Chapter 2, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

2 - 3

A. Annuals

Annuals are plants that grow, mature,
flower, produce seed, and die all in one sea-
son. Zinnias are annual plants. They com-
plete their life cycle in one year.

B. Biennials

Biennials take 2 years or a part of 2 years to
complete their life cycle. During the first
season, biennials grow as a vegetative plant
that overwinters as a hardy rosette of basal
leaves. During the second season, the plant
flowers, produces seeds, and then dies. Pars-
ley is an example of a biennial plant.

C. Perennials

Perennials live for more than 2 years. Her-
baceous perennials have soft, non-woody
stems while woody perennials have woody
stems. Woody perennials can either keep
their leaves through the winter (evergreen)
or lose them and grow new leaves in the
spring (deciduous). Tender perennials die
back each winter and a new plant grows
from the roots each spring.

V. Plant Parts and Their Functions

A. Vegetative Parts

1. Leaves—Leaves are the photosynthetic

(food manufacturing) organs that produce
carbohydrates to provide energy for the
plant to live and grow. Leaves are also a
site of respiration, which is the process
by which carbohydrates are converted into
energy. Another function of leaves is tran-
spiration, or the loss of water as vapor.
Transpiration helps to regulate leaf tempera-
ture and helps to carry water up the plant
from the roots.
a. Parts of a leaf: Leaf parts include the

blade, the flat thin part, and the petiole,
which attaches the blade to the stem. The
pattern of attachment of leaves to the
stem is opposite, alternate, or whorled.
Leaf arrangement is an identifying fea-
ture of plants. There are two common
leaf classifications: simple, a single leaf,
or compound, a leaf with two or more
leaflets (Fig. 1). Leaf shapes, edges (mar-
gins), tips, bases, and vein patterns also
have specific terminology used to de-
scribe these characteristics (Fig. 2).

Fig. 1. Parts, types, and positions of leaves.

b. Leaf structure: Several layers of cells
make up the leaf blade. The outer cell
layers on top and bottom are the epider-
mis. They serve as protection for the in-
ner leaf tissue. Some plants have hairs
called trichomes that are extensions of
the epidermal cells. A waxy layer on the
epidermis is called the cuticle. It protects
the leaf from dehydration and prevents
penetration of some disease-causing or-
ganisms (Fig. 3).
Specialized epidermal cells on the under-
sides (and sometimes upper sides) of
leaves form stomata, or openings into the
leaf (singular of stomata is stomate).
Cells on either side of each stomate are
called guard cells. They swell to open the
stomate or shrink to close it. Conditions
that promote large water losses from

Chapter 2, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

2 - 4

Fig. 2. Terminology describing leaf characteristics.

Fig. 3. Leaf structure.

Chapter 2, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

2 - 5

plants (high temperature, wind, and low
humidity) cause the guard cells to close.
Open stomata also allow the exchange of
carbon dioxide and oxygen between the
air inside and outside of the leaf.
In between the epidermis layers is the
mesophyll where photosynthesis occurs.
The palisade layer of cells is the upper
layer of the mesophyll, and the lower
layer is the spongy parenchyma. Inside
the mesophyll cells are the chloroplasts
where actual photosynthesis occurs.
Vascular bundles, that transport water,
nutrients, and sugars to and from the leaf,
enter the leaf through the petiole and
spread throughout the blade. Their distri-
bution determines the venation or the pat-
tern of veins in the leaves. The principle
vein patterns are parallel veins found in
the monocotyledon group, and net veins
found in the dicotyledon group (Fig. 2).
c. Functions of the leaf: The leaf is the pri-

mary site of photosynthesis in most
plants (Fig. 4). Plants are able to take so-
lar energy and turn it into chemical en-
ergy. Without photosynthesis, life on
earth would not exist. It is the single most
important chemical process on earth be-
cause all other life forms depend on this
process for survival. The photosynthesis
formula is:

Carbon dioxide + water (in the presence of light)

produces carbohydrates (sugars) + oxygen

Carbon dioxide enters the leaf through
the stomata. Photosynthesis requires
natural or artificial light and water that
comes through the roots. The photosyn-
thetic process occurs in the chloroplasts
that contain the chlorophyll cells. Oxygen
and water are released through the sto-
mata, and the end products, carbohy-
drates, are converted to sugars and
starches for transport and storage
throughout the plant.
Leaves are also one site of respiration in
the plant. Respiration is the process by
which carbohydrates are converted into
energy. This energy builds new tissues,
maintains the chemical processes, and
allows growth within the plant. With this
production of energy, sugars and oxygen
are converted to carbon dioxide, water,
and a small amount of heat. Respiration
occurs in all cells and at night as well as
during the day.
The loss of water through the leaf sto-
mata is called transpiration. The tran-
spired water comes from the photosyn-
thetic process and also from water in the
cells. Transpiration pulls water from the
roots with dissolved nutrients through the
plant. It also provides evaporative cool-
ing for leaf tissue.

2. Stems—The stem of a plant supports the

above-ground plant parts and is a path-
way for water, nutrients, and carbohy-
drates.
a. Parts of the stem: All stems have
nodes. A node is an area of active
growth (Fig. 5). Leaves occur on the
stem at the node. Where the leaves
meet the stem is called an axil. Buds

the phloem near the outside, or bark,
and the xylem toward the inside (Figs.
6 and 7). In monocots, paired xylem
and phloem form bundles that are scat-
tered throughout the stem (Fig. 6).
Between all functional phloem and
xylem is a layer of cells called the
cambium. These cells divide and pro-
duce xylem toward the inside of the
stem and phloem toward the outside of
the stem. Stem girth of woody peren-
nial plants increases mainly by the ac-
tivity of these cambium cells.

d. External structure of the stem: In non-

woody plants the epidermis, or outer
single layer of surface cells, protects
the stem. As in leaves, this layer is
usually cutinized, or waxy, and on
young stems it has stomata. Below the
epidermis are layers of supporting and
strengthening cells that surround the
vascular tissue (Fig. 7). These cells
may contain chloroplasts so that they
can photosynthesize. Some of these
tissues can divide and form new tissue
when wounded, providing a protective
mechanism for the stem.
Woody plants form bark, or cork, on
the outside of their stems. Cork cam-
bium produces this bark and is located
just below the bark layers (Fig. 8).

develop into leaves or flowers at a
node. The area between nodes is called
an internode. Internodes can be lengthy
or very small depending on the genet-
ics of the plant and environmental con-
ditions.

b. Types of stems: Crowns are com-
pressed above-ground stems. Ex-
amples are dandelions and strawber-
ries. The leaves and flowers are on
very short internodes.
Spurs are short, stubby stems common
on fruit trees such as apples and pears.
These spurs produce the fruiting buds
on these trees.
A stolon is a horizontal stem, either
fleshy or semi-woody, that runs along
the soil surface. An example is the
stem that attaches the strawberry plant
to its plantlets. It is also called a run-
ner. Some types of grass form stolons.
Below-ground stem variations include
tubers (potatoes), rhizomes (bearded
iris), tuberous stems (tuberous bego-
nias), corms (crocus), and bulbs (tu-
lips) (see Chapter 18, “Herbaceous Or-
namentals”).

c. Internal structure of the stem: The vas-
cular system inside the stem transports
water, minerals, and sugars (Fig. 6).
The xylem vessels conduct water and
minerals, and the phloem tubes carry
sugars. Water moves primarily from
the roots to the top of the plant. Sugars
move from areas of manufacture or
storage to use or to other storage areas
in the plant. The arrangement of the
vascular system in a dicot is continu-
ous. It forms rings inside the stem with

Fig. 6. Vascular system arrangements.

Fig. 7. Cross section of a herbaceous dicot stem.

Chapter 2, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

2 - 7

This cambium forms cork, or bark
cells, that become coated with water
resistant materials, die, and build up
into a thickened, protective layer. The
bark cells resist desiccation, disease,
insects, and extreme temperatures.
Only dicots produce the type of
growth depicted in Fig. 8. On young
twigs and small trunks of many kinds
of trees and shrubs, lenticels, or pore
openings, allow the outward and in-
ward movement of gases.

3. Buds—A lateral or axillary bud is an un-
developed shoot or flower that is found at
the node. If the bud is at the tip of shoots,
it is called a terminal bud (Fig. 9). Buds
may continue to grow after they are
formed, or they may stop growing and
remain dormant until the following
spring. Buds on many plants require a
certain duration of cold temperature be-
low a certain degree before they will
grow in the spring. During dormancy,
buds can tolerate very low temperatures
without damage. However, once the plant
has had enough cold temperature to sat-
isfy that requirement for growth, a new
bud can be easily damaged by subsequent
cold temperatures. Non-growing buds of
tropical and subtropical plants do not
have a temperature requirement for
growth.
a. Types of buds: Vegetative buds de-
velop onto shoots, flower buds pro-
duce one or more flowers, and mixed
buds produce both shoots and flowers.
Buds that do not grow for long periods
of time can become embedded in the
enlarging stem tissue and are latent
buds. These buds grow only when con-
ditions necessary for their growth oc-
cur, such as drastic pruning. Not all
plants have latent buds.

b. Adventitious buds develop in locations

that buds usually don’t occur. An ex-
ample is the buds found on root pieces
used for propagation; roots do not
have buds. Underground parts that do
have buds are considered underground
stems, such as rhizomes or tubers.

4. Roots

Roots absorb nutrients and moisture, an-
chor the plant in the soil, furnish physical
support for the stem, act as transport sys-
tems to move water and minerals to the
stem, and serve as food storage organs.
Roots profoundly affect the size and
vigor of the plant, method of propagation,
adaptation to soil types, and responses to
cultural practices and irrigation. Roots
make up a large proportion of the total
plant; about 20 to 30 percent of the total
volume of the plant is roots, depending
on the nature of the root and the growing
conditions. Since individual roots may be
so small, however, roots can account for
up to 90 percent of the surface area of a
plant!
a. Structure of roots: Roots have an ac-
tively growing area at the tip that pro-
duces new cells. Behind this active re-
gion is the zone of elongation where
the cells expand. Behind this zone is
the region of maturation, where the
enlarged cells turn into the various
root tissues. The epidermis of this
young region forms root hairs that re-
place old root hairs destroyed as the

root penetrates the soil (Fig. 10). Most
water absorption occurs in the area of
the root hairs.
The internal structure of roots is differ-
ent from stems. A root cap protects the
root as it pushes through the soil. The
cells of the cap slough off and are re-
placed by others as roots grow down-
ward. The epidermis protects the root
surface, contains the root hairs, and is
responsible for the absorption of water
and minerals dissolved in water. Cor-
tex cells, beneath the epidermis, help
move the water from the epidermis
and are active in food storage. The
vascular tissue (xylem and phloem) is
in the center of the root and conducts
nutrients, sugars, and water.

b. Kinds of root systems: After the pri-
mary root emerges from the seed, it
may continue to grow straight down
and become a tap root, or it may
branch, forming secondary roots, and
become a fibrous root system with
many side, or lateral, roots (Fig. 11).
The taproot can be encouraged to
branch by removing or breaking the
apical root meristem, or growing point
of the root. This often happens when
seedlings, trees, and other plants are
transplanted. This process favors a fi-
brous root system. Many of the func-
tional feeder roots of woody plants ex-
tend only into the top 18 inches of soil.
The depth that tree roots penetrate de-
pends on the types of tree and soil, and
water status. A dense compacted layer
in the soil or a high water table will
restrict or terminate root growth.

Fig. 10. Root structure.

Fig. 11. Types of roots.

Chapter 2, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

2 - 9

c. Types of roots: Some unusual roots are

aerial roots, which develop on stems
above ground. If they reach soil they
will become ground roots. The aerial
roots of some orchids contain chloro-
phyll for photosynthesis and absorb
moisture and nutrients from the air.
Adventitious roots are those that form
at any place on the plant other than the
primary root system. They may arise
from cells adjacent to vascular
bundles, cambium, or young phloem
cells. They also form on other plant
parts besides stems, such as leaf peti-
oles or leaf blades or even on older
root pieces. The ability of many plants
to produce adventitious roots allows
the propagation of plants vegetatively.

B. Sexual Reproductive Parts

Plants reproduce in many ways, from a
simple cell splitting into two identical indi-
viduals (clones) to the complicated floral
structures found in higher plants. Gymno-
sperms (conifers) have a reproductive sys-
tem that differs from angiosperms (flower-
ing plants). We are concerned here with the
most highly evolved reproductive system,
that of the angiosperms or flowering plants.
1. Flowers—Flowers are the specialized

plant structures adapted for sexual repro-
duction in plants. After fertilization by
pollen, parts of the flower develop into a
fruit that bears the seed(s). Formation of
flowers is still poorly understood. Flow-
ering may be caused by a stimulus such
as day length, plant age, temperatures,
stress, and other factors.
a. Parts of the flower: Complete flowers

have four parts: sepals, petals, sta-
mens, and pistils, which are all borne
on a receptacle (Fig. 12).
• Sepals are the outer covering of the

flower when it is in the bud stage.
They are leaf-like in structure and
are usually green, however, they
can be colored and look like petals,
as in tulips. They may fold back as
in roses or remain upright as with
carnations. Together, all the sepals
form the calyx.

• The petals are the floral structures
inside the sepals. Together, all the
petals form the corolla. Petals are
usually brightly colored and often
contain nectaries that secrete nectar.
The color and nectar attract insects
to pollinate the flowers. Collec-
tively, sepals and petals form the
perianth.

• The stamen is the male part of the

flower and is inside the petals. Each
stamen consists of a filament tipped
with an anther. The anther produces
the pollen.

• The pistil is the female component
of the flower. It is in the center of
the flower and has three parts: the
stigma, the receptive surface that
receives the pollen; the style, a tube
connected to the stigma; and the
ovary, attached to the lower end of
the style. The ovary contains ovules
that develop into seeds after pollina-
tion and fertilization have occurred.

b. Types of flowers: A complete flower
has all four parts: sepals, petals, sta-
mens, and a pistil. Flowers with both
stamens and pistils are called perfect
flowers.

Fig. 12. Flower structure.

Chapter 2, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

2 - 10

Incomplete flowers lack one or more
of the four parts. Flowers with no pis-
tils (stamens only) are staminate or
male flowers. Flowers with no stamens
(pistils only) are pistillate or female
flowers. These flowers are called im-
perfect because they lack either the
pistils or the stamens.
If a plant has imperfect flowers and
male (staminate) and female
(pistallate) flowers occur on the same
plant, the plant is termed monoecious.
Corn is an example of a monoecious
plant. If the male and female flowers
occur on separate plants the plants are
called dioecious. Holly is an example
of a dioecious plant.

c. Arrangement of flowers: If a stalk

bears a single flower, such as a tulip, it
is a solitary flower. Multiples or clus-
ters of flowers are arranged in inflores-
cences. Some of these flower clusters
are shown in Fig. 13.

d. Fertilization of flowers: Once a flower
is formed, the first step in fertilization
is pollination, the transfer of pollen
from an anther to a stigma. If the an-
ther and stigma are in the same flower
or if the anther and stigma are in dif-
ferent flowers on the same plant or in

different flowers on different plants of
the same species, variety, or cultivar,
this is all called self-pollination. Only
when the anther and the stigma are in
different flowers on plants of different
species, varieties, or cultivars does
cross-pollination occur. Pollination
occurs by insects or, in plants with in-
conspicuous flowers, by wind.
Once the pollen lands on the stigma,
the pollen grain germinates and begins
to grow a pollen tube that penetrates
through the style (Fig. 14). In the tube
are the male sperm that will unite with
the female egg in the ovule. Fertiliza-

tion occurs when sperm unites with the
egg and an embryo begins to grow.
A plant is self-fertile if it produces
seed with its own pollen. It is self-ster-
ile if it needs pollen from another spe-
cies, variety, or cultivar (e.g., cross-
pollination) for fertilization to occur.
Often self-sterility is due to incompat-
ibility or a condition where the pollen
will not grow through the style.

2. Fruits—Once pollination occurs and the
embryo begins to develop, the formation
of a fruit begins and seeds develop within
the fruit. Fruits can develop from all the
various parts of the flower, not just the
ovary. Fig. 15 shows some fruit types.
a. Fruit growth and development: Botani-
cally speaking, the true fruit is just the
enlarged ovary. However, once fertili-
zation is accomplished, the true fruit
and, sometimes, various associated tis-
sues begin to grow into what we rec-
ognize and call a fruit. Food materials

move from other parts of the plant into
these developing tissues. Hormonal
chemicals are involved in fruit growth,
but their basic mechanisms are not
completely understood. Fruit growth
includes both cell division and cell en-
largement.
Botanical maturity of a fruit refers to a
final stage of development when the
fruit is still on the plant and cell en-
largement and accumulation of carbo-
hydrates and other flavor constituents
is complete. Fruits are often harvested
before true botanical maturity as in the
case of cucumbers used for pickles.
Fruits, such as lima beans used as dry
beans, are harvested after true botani-
cal maturity. Optimum harvest time
depends upon the intended use of the
fruit.

3. Seeds—Seeds are matured ovules and

occur as, or in, mature fruits. They come
in all shapes and sizes as well as methods

of dispersal. Maple seeds (samaras) are
carried through the air on wings. Cockle-
burs have barbs or hooks to catch in
clothing or animal fur. Small animals
gather, transport, and bury nuts, complet-
ing the planting of these seeds. These
seeds pass through their digestive tracts
of animals, such as coyotes, and are
widely disseminated.
a. Parts of a seed: Every seed has three

basic parts: an embryo, a food storage
tissue, and a seed coat (Fig. 16). The
embryo is a tiny plant formed during
fertilization. It has two growing points,
the radicle (a tiny root), and the plu-
mule (a tiny shoot). The food storage
tissue is either one or two cotyledon,
which are attached between the two
growing points on the embryo. In
some seeds (as in corn) the single
cotyledon is imbedded in an en-
dosperm that is a food-storage area in
the seed. The seed coat forms the outer
layer and provides protection for the
enclosed embryo.

b. Seed viability: In order for seeds to
grow, the embryo must be viable, or
alive. Seeds can remain alive for days
or years, depending on the species of
plant and the seed storage conditions.
Best storage conditions for most seeds
are cool and dry. However, seeds of
tropical plants will dry out and die if
stored under dry conditions.
There are several ways to test if seeds
are alive. Cutting open the seed to
view the embryo can tell you if it ex-

ists, but not whether it is alive. Seeds
that float on water are usually not vi-
able; live seeds will sink. Germinating
a sample of seeds can tell you what
percent are alive. Make sure seeds
tested in this way are not dormant. Us-
ing a chemical such as tetrazolium that
stains the live parts of the seed red is a
good viability test. Removing the em-
bryo from the seed to observe growth
in artificial media such as agar is an-
other way to test viability. For home
gardeners these last two tests are usu-
ally not practical.

c. Seed dormancy: Some seeds, even

though viable and planted under the
correct conditions, fail to grow. These
seeds are exhibiting a feature called
dormancy. Seed dormancy can result
from limiting structural or physiologi-
cal conditions in the seed coverings
(particularly the seed coats) or in the
embryo itself, or both. Dormancy is an
adaptive feature of some plants to keep
the seeds from germinating until con-
ditions exist that favor seedling sur-
vival.
Seed coat dormancy is caused by seed
coats being impermeable to water and
gases or by being too hard to let the
embryo emerge. In nature, weathering,
the action of microorganisms, or the
passage through the digestive tract of
an animal can soften the seed cover-
ing. Artificial methods to soften the
seed coat include scarification,
scratching or rupturing the seed coat

Fig. 16. Parts of a seed.

Chapter 2, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

2 - 13

with sandpaper or nicking it with a
knife. Heat treatments using boiling
water can disrupt the seed coat enough
to allow germination. Soaking seeds in
concentrated sulfuric acid, called acid
scarification, softens the seed coat to
help overcome seed coat dormancy.
Embryo dormancy is common in seeds
of woody perennial plants. A physi-
ological condition in the embryo pre-
vents it from growing. This type of
dormancy can be overcome by stratifi-
cation, or chilling seeds under moist
conditions. This method mimics the
conditions a seed might endure after it
fell to the ground in the fall and went
through a cold winter on the ground.
This type of dormancy keeps the seed
from growing in the fall when the re-
sulting tiny plant would be killed by
the winter cold.
Some seeds have both a seed coat and
embryo dormancy. Treatment to over-
come both types of dormancy is neces-
sary to allow germination.
Some seeds fail to germinate because
of an immature embryo. Enough time
after seed harvest must be allowed for
the embryo to develop. Embryo matu-
ration can occur while the seed is in
storage or after it is planted.
Chemical inhibitors can block germi-
nation in seeds. These chemicals may
be in the embryo, some other part of
the seed, or even in part of the fruit.
Removing the seed from the fruit will
allow germination in the case of
chemical inhibition from fruits. Water

leaching can remove chemicals in
seeds or embryos. In nature, heavy
soaking rains would accomplish this
task and provide an excellent growing
condition for the resulting seedling.
Good reference materials are available
to determine what conditions are nec-
essary to germinate a seed. Master
Gardeners should use these references
to be successful in seed collection and
germination.
C. How Plants Grow

1. Seed germination—After planting, cer-
tain processes begin in a seed leading to
the growth of an entirely new plant.
These processes are called germination
(Fig. 17). The first step necessary to be-
gin the process involves the absorption of
water or imbibition. The seed swells with
the uptake of water, cell enzyme activity
increases, growth begins, and the seed
coat bursts. The radicle, which will de-
velop into the root, emerges and grows
downward into the soil. The portion of
the seedling between the radicle and the
first leaf-like structure is the hypocotyl.
The seed leaves or cotyledons are usually
the first leafy structure seen, and they en-
close a growing point called the apical or
shoot meristem (defined below). Plants
with one seed leaf are monocotyledons
while dicotyledons have two seed leaves.
The storage products within the cotyle-
dons provide energy to support growth of
the seedling until photosynthesis begins.
New leaves and stem cells are produced
and the plant begins to grow taller, or
elongate.

Fig. 17. Seed germination.

Chapter 2, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

2 - 14

Successful seed germination requires cer-
tain environmental conditions: adequate
moisture, proper temperature, good aera-
tion, darkness, or, in some cases, light.
2. Differentiation and maturation—Plants

continue to grow and develop their struc-
tures from meristematic areas (Fig. 18).
Various cells form the shape, size, and
characteristics of each type of plant. The
genetic information that dictates all cellu-
lar processes is called DNA (deoxyribo-
nucleic acid). DNA is organized into
chromosomes. The order and organiza-
tion of the DNA in the chromosomes is
responsible for all characteristics of the
plant—such as whether it will be woody
or herbaceous, annual or perennial, or tall
or short.

3. Meristematic areas and growth—Plants
have specific meristematic areas where
cells actively divide to provide more cells
that will expand and develop into other
tissues and organs of the plant.
a. Apical meristems: Shoot meristems are

at the very tips of the above-ground
parts of the plant. They produce new
buds and leaves in a particular pattern
at the tip of the stems. The shoot mer-
istem produces cells that eventually
form the different tissues of the stem:

Fig. 18. Parts of a vascular plant.

the epidermis and the very first xylem
and phloem. In some plants, this mer-
istem will produce flower buds at a
certain point in the development of the
plant. In other plants, this meristem
continues to produce only vegetative
structures (leaves and stems). If this is
the case, flowers are produced on side
branches in the axils of leaves some
distance below the apex. The shoot
meristem allows the plant to grow and
increase in height.
Another type of apical meristem is the
root meristem, located at the tips of
roots. The root meristems provide for
elongation of the roots and produce the
cells that will become the epidermis,
cortex, and the xylem, cambium, and
phloem of the mature root.

b. Lateral meristems: Lateral meristems
are cylinders of actively dividing cells
that start just below the apical mer-
istems and are located up and down
the plant. One type of lateral meristem
is the vascular cambium, which pro-
duces new xylem and phloem. Another
lateral meristem is the cork cambium,
which produces bark on older stems
and roots. The stem girth of woody
perennial plants increases by the activ-
ity of these meristems.

c. Other types of meristems: Some plants

have a subapical meristem that pro-
duces new cells in the region just be-
hind a shoot meristem. Plants that
form rosettes when they first produce
leaves and then “bolt” when producing
a flowering stalk have subapical mer-
istems. An example is common mul-
lein. The subapical meristem aids in
formation of the flowering stalk.
Some other plants, mostly monocots,
have active meristematic cells in older
mature tissue, separated from the shoot
meristem. For example, grasses have
intercalary meristems just above the
nodes in the lower region of the leaf
sheaths. These cells divide and provide
the growth of the grass leaf from the
base.

Plant Propagation

S. M. Bell

Susan M. Bell, Extension Educator, Ada County, Boise

I. Sexual Propagation

Sexual propagation involves the union of the pol-
len (male) with the egg (female) to produce a
seed. The seed is made up of three parts: the outer
seed coat, which protects the seed; the endosperm
(cotyledon), which is a food reserve; and the em-
bryo, which is the young plant itself. When a seed
is mature and put in a favorable environment, it
will germinate, or begin active growth. In the fol-
lowing section, seed germination and transplant-
ing of seeds will be discussed.

A. Seed

To obtain quality plants, start with good
quality seed from a reliable dealer. Select
varieties to provide the size, color, and habit
of growth desired. Choose varieties adapted
to your area that will reach maturity before
an early frost. Many new vegetable and
flower varieties are hybrids, which cost a
little more than open pollinated types. How-
ever, hybrid plants usually have more vigor,
more uniformity, and better production than
nonhybrids and sometimes have specific
disease resistance or other unique cultural
characteristics. Disadvantages of hybrids:
seed cannot be saved as they do not breed
true, and they may have a higher fertility
requirement.

Although some seeds will keep for several
years if stored properly, it is advisable to
purchase only enough seed for the current
year’s use. Good seed will not contain seed
of any other crop, weed seeds, or other de-
bris. The seed packet usually indicates es-
sential information about the variety, the
year for which the seeds were packaged,
germination percentage you may typically
expect, and notes of any chemical seed
treatment. If seeds are obtained well in ad-
vance of the actual sowing date or are stored
surplus seeds, keep them in a cool, dry
place. Do not freeze seed. Laminated foil
packets help ensure dry storage. Paper pack-
ets are best kept in tightly-closed containers
and maintained near 40°F in low humidity.
Some gardeners save seed from their own
gardens, however, such seed is the result of
random pollination by insects or other natu-
ral agents and may or may not produce
plants typical of the parents. Open pollinated
varieties are best for seed saving. Vegetable
seeds are discussed in Chapter 19.

B. Germination

Four environmental factors affect germina-
tion: water, light, oxygen, and heat.
1. Water—The first step in the germination

process is absorption of water. Even
though seeds have great absorbing power
due to the nature of the seed coat, the
amount of available water in the germina-
tion medium affects the uptake of water.
An adequate, continuous supply of water
is important to ensure germination. Once
the germination process begins, a dry pe-
riod will cause the death of the embryo.
2. Light—Light is known to stimulate or to

inhibit germination of some seed. The

Chapter 3, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

light reaction involved here
is a complex process. Some
crops that have a requirement
for light to assist seed germi-
nation are ageratum, begonia,
browallia, impatiens, lettuce,
and petunia. Conversely, cen-
taurea, annual phlox, ver-
bena, and vinca will germi-
nate best in the dark (Table
1). Many other plant seeds
are not specific in their light
or dark requirements.
Seed catalogs and seed pack-
ets often list germination or
cultural tips for individual
varieties. When sowing light-
requiring seed, do as nature
does and leave them on the
soil surface. If they are cov-
ered at all, cover them lightly
with fine peat moss or fine
vermiculite. These two mate-
rials, if not applied too
heavily, will permit some
light to reach the seed and
will not limit germination.
When starting seed in the
home, supplemental light can
be provided by fluorescent
fixtures suspended 6 to 12
inches above the seeds for 16
hours a day.

3. Oxygen—In all viable seed,
respiration takes place. The
respiration in dormant seed is
low, but some oxygen is re-
quired. The respiration rate
increases during germination,
therefore, the medium in
which the seeds are placed should be
loose and well aerated. If the oxygen sup-
ply during germination is limited or re-
duced, germination can be severely re-
tarded or inhibited.

4. Heat—A favorable temperature is an-

other important requirement of germina-
tion (Table 1). It not only affects the ger-
mination percentage but also the rate of
germination. Some seeds will germinate
over a wide range of temperature,

( — ) means no specific light or dark requirements.

whereas others require a narrow range.
Many seed have minimum, maximum,
and optimum temperatures at which they
germinate. For example, tomato seed has
a minimum germination temperature of
50°F and a maximum temperature of
95°F, but an optimum germination tem-
perature of about 80°F. Where germina-
tion temperatures are listed, they are usu-
ally the optimum temperatures unless
otherwise specified. Generally, 65° to

Chapter 3, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

3 - 3

75°F is best for most plants. This often
means the germination flats may have to
be placed on radiators, heating cables, or
heating mats to maintain optimum tem-
perature. The importance of maintaining
proper soil temperature to achieve maxi-
mum germination percentages cannot be
over-emphasized.
Germination will begin when certain in-
ternal requirements have been met. A
seed must have a mature embryo, contain
a large enough endosperm to sustain the
embryo during germination, and contain
sufficient hormones or auxins to initiate
the process.

C. Methods of Breaking Dormancy

One of the functions of dormancy is to pre-
vent a seed from germinating before it is
surrounded by a favorable environment. In
some trees and shrubs, seed dormancy is
difficult to break, even when the environ-
ment is ideal. Various treatments are per-
formed on the seed to break dormancy and
begin germination.
1. Seed scarification—Seed scarification

involves breaking, scratching, or soften-
ing the seed coat so that water can enter
and begin the germination process. There
are several methods of scarifying seeds.
a. In acid scarification, seeds are put in a
glass container and covered with con-
centrated sulfuric acid. The seeds are
gently stirred and allowed to soak
from 10 minutes to several hours, de-
pending on the hardness of the seed
coat. When the seed coat has become
thin, the seeds can be removed,
washed, and planted.

b. Another scarification method is me-
chanical. You may file seeds with a
metal file, rub them with sandpaper, or
crack them with a hammer to weaken
the seed coat.

c. Hot water scarification involves put-
ting the seed into hot water (170° to
212°F). The seeds are allowed to soak
in the water, as it cools, for 12 to 24
hours and then planted.

d. You also may try warm, moist scarifi-
cation. In this case, seeds are stored in

nonsterile, warm, damp containers
where the seed coat will be broken
down by decay over several months.
2. Seed stratification—Seeds of some fall-

ripening trees and shrubs of the temperate
zone will not germinate unless chilled
underground as they overwinter. This so-
called “after-ripening” may be accom-
plished artificially by a practice called
stratification.
a. The following procedure is usually

successful. Put sand or vermiculite in a
clay pot to about 1 inch from the top.
Place the seeds on top of the medium
and cover with 1/2-inch of sand or ver-
miculite. Wet the medium thoroughly
and allow excess water to drain
through the hole in the pot. Place the
pot containing the moist medium and
seeds in a plastic bag and seal. Place
the bag in a refrigerator (not freezer).
Periodically check to see that the me-
dium is moist, but not wet. Additional
water will probably not be necessary.
After 10 to 12 weeks, remove the bag
and pot from the refrigerator. Remove
the bag and set the pot in a warm place
in the house. Water often enough to
keep the medium moist. Soon the
seedlings should emerge. When the
young plants are about 2 inches tall,
transplant them into pots to grow until
it is time to set them outside.

b. Another procedure for starting seeds

uses sphagnum moss or peat moss.
Wet the moss thoroughly, then
squeeze out the excess water with your
hands. Mix seed with the sphagnum or
peat and place in a plastic bag. Seal the
bag and put it in a refrigerator. Check
periodically. If there is condensation
on the inside of the bag, the process
will be successful. After 10 to 12
weeks, remove the bag from the refrig-
erator. Plant the seeds in pots to germi-
nate and grow. Handle seeds carefully.
Often the small roots and shoots are
emerging at the end of the stratifica-
tion period. Care must be taken not to
break these off.

Chapter 3, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

3 - 4

c. Temperatures in the range of 35° to
45°F are effective for stratification.
Most refrigerators operate in this
range. Seeds of most fruit and nut trees
can be successfully germinated by
these procedures. Seeds of peaches
should be removed from the hard pit.
Care must be taken when cracking the
pits. Any injury to the seed itself can
be an entry path for disease organisms.

D. Starting Seeds

1. Media—A wide range of materials can be
used to start seeds, from plain vermiculite
or mixtures of soilless media to the vari-
ous amended soil mixes. With experi-
ence, you will learn to determine what
works best under your conditions. How-
ever, keep in mind what makes a good
germinating medium. It should be rather
fine and uniform, yet well-aerated and
loose. It should be free of insects, disease
organisms, and weed seeds. It should also
be of low fertility or total soluble salts
and capable of holding and moving mois-
ture by capillary action. One mixture that
supplies these factors is a combination of
1/3 sterilized soil, 1/3 sand or vermiculite
or perlite, and 1/3 peat moss. Do not use
garden soil by itself to start seedlings; it
is not sterile, it is often too heavy, and it
will not drain well.
a. The importance of using a sterile me-

dium and container cannot be over-
emphasized. The home gardener can
treat a small quantity of soil in an
oven. Place the slightly moist soil in a
heat-resistant container in an oven set
at about 250°F. Use a candy or meat
thermometer to ensure that the mix
reaches a temperature of 180°F for 30
minutes. Avoid over-heating as this
can be extremely damaging to the soil.
Be aware that the soil will release very
unpleasant odors in the process of ster-
ilization. This treatment should pre-
vent damping-off and other plant dis-
eases, as well as eliminate potential
plant pests.

b. An artificial, soilless mix also provides

the desired qualities of a good germi-
nation medium. The basic ingredients

of such a mix are sphagnum peat moss
and vermiculite, both of which are
generally free of diseases, weed seeds,
and insects. The ingredients are also
readily available, easy to handle, light-
weight, and produce uniform plant
growth. “Peat-lite” mixes or similar
products are commercially available or
can be made at home using this recipe:
4 quarts of shredded sphagnum peat
moss, 4 quarts of fine vermiculite, 1
tablespoon of superphosphate, and 2
tablespoons of ground limestone. Mix
thoroughly. These mixes have little
fertility, so seedlings must be watered
with a diluted fertilizer solution soon
after they emerge.

2. Containers—Flats and trays can be pur-
chased or you can make your own from
scrap lumber. A convenient size to
handle would be about 12 to 18 inches
long and 12 inches wide with a depth of
about 2 inches. Leave cracks of about
1/8-inch between the boards in the bot-
tom or drill a series of holes to ensure
good drainage.
a. You can also make your own contain-
ers for starting seeds by recycling such
things as cottage cheese containers, the
bottoms of milk cartons, or bleach
containers and pie pans, as long as
good drainage is provided. Wash
growing containers and implements to
remove any debris, then rinse in a so-
lution of one part chlorine bleach to
nine parts water. At least one company
has developed a form for shaping
newspaper into pots, and another has
developed a method for the consumer
to make and use compressed blocks of
soil mix instead of pots.

b. Clay or plastic pots can be used and

numerous types of pots made of com-
pressed peat are also on the market.
Plant bands and plastic cell packs are
also available. Each cell or minipot
holds a single plant that reduces the
risk of root injury when transplanting.
Peat pellets, peat or fiber-based blocks,
and expanded foam cubes can also be
used for sowing.

Chapter 3, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

3. Seeding—The proper time for sowing

seeds for transplants depends upon when
plants may safely be moved out-of-doors
in your area. This period may range from
4 to 12 weeks before transplanting, de-
pending upon the speed of germination,
the rate of growth, and the cultural condi-
tions provided. A common mistake is to
sow the seeds too early and then attempt
to hold the seedlings back under poor
light or improper temperature ranges.
This usually results in tall, weak, spindly
plants that do not perform well in the gar-
den.
a. After selecting a container, fill it to

within 3/4-inch of the top with moist-
ened growing medium. For very small
seeds, at least the top 1/4-inch should
be a fine, screened mix or a layer of
vermiculite. Firm the medium at the
corners and edges with your fingers or
a block of wood to provide a uniform,
flat surface.

b. For medium and large seeds, make fur-

rows 1 to 2 inches apart and 1/8- to
1/4-inch deep across the surface of the
container using a narrow board or pot
label. By sowing in rows, good light
and air movement results, and if damp-
ing-off fungus does appear, there is
less chance of it spreading. Seedlings
in rows are easier to label and handle
at transplanting time than those that
have been sown in a broadcast manner.
Sow the seeds thinly and uniformly in
the rows by gently tapping the packet
of seed as it is moved along the row.
Lightly cover the seed with dry ver-
miculite or sifted medium if they re-
quire darkness for germination. A suit-
able planting depth is usually about
two to three times the diameter of the
seed.

c. Do not plant seeds too deeply. Ex-

tremely fine seeds such as petunia, be-
gonia, and snapdragon are not covered,
but lightly pressed into the medium or
watered in with a fine mist. If these
seeds are broadcast, strive for a uni-
form stand by sowing half the seeds in

one direction, then sowing the remain-
ing seed the other direction to form a
crossed pattern.

d. Large seeds are frequently sown into a
small container or cell pack that elimi-
nates the need for early transplanting.
Usually two or three seeds are sown
per unit and later thinned to allow the
strongest seedling to grow.

4. Seed tape—Most garden stores and seed

catalogs offer indoor and outdoor seed
tapes. Seed tape has precisely spaced
seeds enclosed in an organic, water-
soluble material. When planted, the tape
dissolves and the seeds germinate nor-
mally. Seed tapes are especially conve-
nient for tiny, hard-to-handle seeds.
However, tapes are much more expensive
per seed. Seed tapes allow uniform emer-
gence, eliminate overcrowding, and per-
mit sowing in perfectly straight rows.
The tapes can be cut at any point for mul-
tiple-row plantings, and thinning is rarely
necessary.
a. A homemade “seed tape” can be fash-
ioned from 2-ply toilet paper and paste
made with flour and water. Separate
the two paper layers, then use a tooth-
pick with a dab of flour paste on it to
pick up and place seeds on one of the
paper layers. Once all seeds are
placed, put the two layers back to-
gether while the paste is still wet and
roll the “tape” up for later use. The toi-
let paper, once covered with soil, will
rapidly decay leaving no trace.

5. Pregermination—Another method of
starting seeds is pregermination. This
method involves sprouting the seeds be-
fore they are planted in pots or in the gar-
den. This reduces the time to germina-
tion, as the temperature and moisture are
easy to control. A high percentage of ger-
mination is achieved since environmental
factors are optimum.
a. Lay seeds between two paper towels
or on a layer of vermiculite in a shal-
low pan. Keep them moist and in a
warm place. When roots begin to
show, place the seeds in containers or

Chapter 3, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

3 - 6

plant them directly into the garden.
While transplanting seedlings, be care-
ful not to break off tender roots. Con-
tinued attention to watering is critical.

b. When planting seeds in a container

that will be set out in the garden later,
place one seed in a 2- to 3-inch con-
tainer. Plant the seeds at only one-half
the recommended depth. Gently press
a little soil over the sprouted seed and
then add about 1/4-inch of milled
sphagnum peat or sand to the soil sur-
face. These materials will keep the sur-
face uniformly moist and are easy for
the shoot to push through. Keep the
seedlings in a warm place and care for
them as for any other newly trans-
planted seedlings.

c. A convenient way to plant small, deli-

cate, pregerminated seeds is to sus-
pend them in a gel. You can make a
gel by blending cornstarch with boil-
ing water to a consistency that is thick
enough so the seeds will stay sus-
pended. Be sure to cool thoroughly be-
fore adding seeds. Place the gel with
seedlings in a plastic bag with a hole
in it. Squeeze the gel through the hole
along a premarked garden row. Spac-
ing of seeds is determined by the num-
ber of seeds in the gel. If the spacing is
too dense, add more gel; if too wide,
add more seeds. The gel will keep the
germinating seeds moist until they es-
tablish themselves in the garden soil.

5. Watering—After the seed has been sown,
moisten the planting mix thoroughly. Use
a fine mist or place the containers in a
pan or tray that contains about 1 inch of
warm water. Avoid splashing or exces-
sive flooding, which might displace small
seeds. When the planting mix is satu-
rated, set the container aside to drain. The
soil should be moist but not wet.
a. Ideally, seed flats should remain suffi-

ciently moist during the germination
period without having to add water.
One way to maintain moisture is to
slip the whole flat or pot into a clear
plastic bag after the initial watering.

The plastic should be at least 1 inch
from the soil. Placing a popsicle stick
or pencil in the middle of the flat will
hold the plastic off the soil and plants.
Keep the container out of direct sun-
light, otherwise the temperature may
rise to the point where the seeds will
be harmed. Many home gardeners
cover their flats with panes of glass
instead of using a plastic bag. Be sure
to remove the plastic or glass cover as
soon as the first seedlings appear. Sur-
face watering can then be practiced.
b. Lack of uniformity, overwatering, or

drying out are problems related to
manual watering. Excellent germina-
tion and moisture uniformity can be
obtained with a low-pressure misting
system or subirrigation (watering from
below). Flats or pots must not sit in
water constantly as the soil may ab-
sorb too much water, and the seeds
will rot due to lack of oxygen.

6. Temperature and light—Several factors
for good germination have already been
mentioned. The last item, and by no
means the least important, is temperature.
Since most seeds will germinate best at
an optimum temperature that is usually
higher than most home night tempera-
tures, special warm areas must be pro-
vided. The use of thermostatically con-
trolled heating cables is an excellent
method of providing constant heat (see
Germination section on page 3-2).
a. After germination and seedling estab-

lishment, move the flats to a light,
airy, cooler location, at a 55° to 60°F
night temperature and a 65° to 70°F
day reading. This will prevent soft,
leggy growth and minimize disease.
Some crops, of course, may germinate
or grow best at a different constant
temperature and must be handled sepa-
rately from the rest of the plants. Read
as much as you can about the plants
you are trying to grow.

b. Seedlings must receive bright light af-
ter germination. Place them in a win-
dow facing south, if possible. If a

Chapter 3, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

3 - 7

large, bright window is not available,
place the seedlings under a fluorescent
light. Use two 40-watt, cool-white
fluorescent tubes or special plant
growth lamps. Position the plants 6 to
8 inches from the tubes and keep the
lights on for 14 to 16 hours each day.
As the seedlings grow, the lights
should be raised.

E. Transplanting and Handling

If the plants have not been seeded in indi-
vidual containers, they must be transplated
to give them proper growing space. One of
the most common mistakes made is leaving
the seedlings in the seed flat too long. The
ideal time to transplant young seedlings is
when they are small as there is less danger
from transplant shock. This is usually about
the time the first true leaves appear above or
between the cotyledons (the cotyledons
sometimes called “seed leaves” are not true
leaves). Avoid letting plants get hard,
stunted, or tall and leggy.
1. Seedling growing mixes and containers
can be purchased or prepared similar to
those mentioned for germinating seed.
The medium should contain more plant
nutrients than a germination mix. Some
commercial soilless mixes have fertilizer
already added. When fertilizing, use a
soluble houseplant fertilizer at the rate
recommended by the manufacturer, about
every 2 to 3 weeks after the seedlings are
established. Remember that young seed-
lings can easily be damaged by too much
fertilizer, especially if they are under
moisture stress.

2. To transplant, carefully dig up the small

plants with a knife or wooden plant label.
Let the group of seedlings fall apart and
pick out individual plants. Gently ease
them apart in small groups that will make
it easier to separate individual plants.
Avoid tearing roots in the process.
Handle small seedlings by their leaves,
not by their delicate stems. Punch a hole
in the medium into which the seedling
will be planted. Make it deep enough so
that the seedling can be put at the same
depth it was growing at in the seed flat.

After planting, firm the soil and water
gently. Keep newly transplanted seed-
lings in the shade for a few days, or place
them under fluorescent lights. Keep them
away from direct heat sources. Continue
watering and fertilizing as in the seed
flats.

3. Most plants transplant well and can be

started indoors, but a few plants are diffi-
cult to transplant. These are generally di-
rectly seeded outdoors or sown directly
into individual containers indoors. Ex-
amples include zinnias and cucurbits,
such as melons and squash.

4. Containers for transplanting—There is a
wide variety of containers from which to
choose for transplanting seedlings. These
containers should be economical, du-
rable, and make good use of space. The
type selected will depend on the type of
plant to be transplanted and individual
growing conditions. Small plastic pots
may be used, but they waste a great deal
of space and may not dry out rapidly
enough for the seedling to have sufficient
oxygen for proper development.
a. Many types of containers are available

commercially. Those made out of
pressed peat can be purchased in vary-
ing sizes. Individual pots are inexpen-
sive and can be planted directly into
the garden. When setting out plants
grown in peat pots, be sure to cover
the pot completely. If the top edge of
the peat pot extends above the soil
level, it may act as a wick and draw
water away from the soil and roots. To
avoid this, tear off the top lip of the
pot and then plant.

b. Compressed peat pellets, when soaked
in water, expand to form compact, in-
dividual pots. They waste no space,
don’t fall apart as badly as peat pots,
and can be set directly out in the gar-
den.

c. In addition, many homeowners find a
variety of materials from around the
house to use for containers. These
homemade containers should be deep
enough to provide adequate soil and

Chapter 3, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

3 - 8

have plenty of drainage holes in the
bottom.

5. Hardening plants—Hardening off is the

process of altering the quality of plant
growth to withstand the change in envi-
ronmental conditions that occurs when
plants are transferred from a greenhouse
to the garden. Severe sunscald or a stop-
page in growth may occur if plants pro-
duced in the home are planted outdoors
without a transition period. Hardening off
is most critical with early crops, when
adverse climatic conditions can be ex-
pected.
a. Hardening off can be accomplished by

gradually lowering temperature and
relative humidity and reducing water.
This procedure results in an accumula-
tion of carbohydrates and a thickening
of cell walls. A change from a soft,
succulent type of growth to a firmer,
harder type occurs.

b. This process should be started at least
2 weeks before planting in the garden.
If possible, plants should be moved to
a 45° to 50°F temperature either in-
doors or outdoors in a shady location.
A coldframe is excellent for this pur-
pose. When put outdoors, plants
should be shaded, then gradually
moved into sunlight. Start with a 15-
to 20-minute exposure. Each day
gradually increase the length of expo-
sure time to outside temperatures.
Don’t put tender seedlings outdoors on
windy days or when temperatures are
below 45°F.

c. Reduce the frequency of watering to

slow their growth, but don’t allow
plants to wilt. Even cold-hardy plants
will be hurt if exposed to freezing tem-
peratures before they are hardened.
After proper hardening, however, they
can be planted outdoors and light
frosts will not damage them.

d. The hardening off process is intended
to slow plant growth. If carried to the
extreme of actually stopping plant
growth, significant damage can be
done to certain crops. For example,

cucumbers and melons will stop all
growth, while cauliflower will make
thumb-size heads and fail to develop
further if hardened too severely.

II. Asexual Propagation

Asexual propagation is the best way to maintain
some species, particularly an individual that best
represents that species. Clones are groups of
plants that are identical to their parent or mother
plant. The Bartlett pear (1770) and the Delicious
apple (1870) are two examples of clones that
have been asexually propagated for many years.
The major methods of asexual propagation are
cuttings, layering, division, and budding/grafting.
Cuttings involve rooting a severed piece of the
parent plant; layering involves rooting a part of
the parent plant and then severing it later; and
budding and grafting is joining two plant parts
from different varieties.

A. Cuttings

Many types of plants, both woody and her-
baceous, are frequently propagated by cut-
tings. A cutting is a vegetative plant part
that is severed from the parent plant in order
to regenerate itself, thereby forming a whole
new plant.
1. Take cuttings with a sharp blade to re-
duce injury to the parent plant. Before
using the knife to cut, dip the cutting tool
into rubbing alcohol and allow it to dry or
use a mixture of one part bleach to nine
parts water to disinfect the blade and to
prevent transmitting diseases. Remove
flowers and flower buds from cuttings to
allow the cutting to use its energy and
stored carbohydrates for root and shoot
formation rather than fruit and seed pro-
duction.
a. To hasten rooting, increase the number

of roots, or to obtain uniform rooting
(except on soft, fleshy stems), use a
rooting hormone, preferably one con-
taining a fungicide. Prevent possible
contamination of the entire supply of
rooting hormone by putting a small
amount in a separate container for im-
mediate use. Do not dip cuttings di-
rectly into the original container.

Chapter 3, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

3 - 9

b. If hormone powder is used, only a

very light coating is necessary. Tap off
any excess onto a sheet of paper.

2. Insert cuttings into a rooting medium

such as coarse sand, vermiculite, steril-
ized soil, water, or a mixture of peat and
perlite. A pencil can be used to make a
hole in the medium for easier insertion
and to prevent the removal of hormone
powder from the cut surface.
a. It is important to choose the correct

rooting medium to get optimum root-
ing in the shortest time. In general, the
rooting medium should be sterile, low
in fertility, drain well enough to pro-
vide oxygen, and retain enough mois-
ture to prevent water stress. Moisten
the medium before inserting cuttings,
and keep it evenly
moist while cut-
tings are rooting
and forming new
shoots. Place stem
and leaf cuttings in
indirect light. Root
cuttings can be
kept in the dark
until new shoots
appear.

at any time of the
year, but stem cut-
tings of many woody
plants must be taken
during the fall or in
the dormant season.
Tip, medial, cane,
single and double
eye, and heel are all
examples of stem cut-
tings.
a. Tip cuttings: De-
tach a 2- to 4-inch
piece of stem with
two or three nodes,

the stem. The terminal bud is not nec-
essary for this kind of stem cutting.
Prepare and insert the cutting as you
would a tip cutting. Be sure to position
right side up. Axial buds are always
above leaves.

c. Cane cuttings: Cut cane-like stems into

sections containing one or two “eyes”
or nodes. Dust ends with fungicide or
activated charcoal. Allow to dry sev-
eral hours. Lay horizontally with about
half of the cutting below the media
surface, eye facing upward. Cane cut-
tings are usually potted when roots and
new shoots appear. This method is
used with dumbcane (Dieffenbachia).
d. Single eye cuttings: The eye refers to
the node. This is used for  plants with
alternate leaves when space or
stock material are limited. Cut
the stem about 1/2 inch above
and 1/2 inch below a node. Place
cutting horizontally or vertically
in the medium.

e. Double eye cuttings: This
is used for plants with op-
posite leaves when space
or stock material is lim-
ited. Cut the stem about
1/2 inch above and 1/2
inch below the same node.
Insert the cutting vertically
in the medium with the
node just touching the sur-
face.

f. Heel cuttings: This method

uses plant material with
woody stems. Make a
shield-shaped cut about
halfway through the wood
around a leaf and axial
bud. Insert the shield hori-
zontally into the medium.
4. Leaf cuttings—Leaf cuttings
are used almost exclusively
for a few indoor houseplants.
Leaves of most other plants
will either produce a few
roots but no plant, or they
just decay. Covering leaf cut-

tings with a plastic bag will
maintain moisture in the me-
dium and humidity around
the cutting.

a. Whole leaf with petiole: Detach the

leaf and up to 1 1/2 inches of petiole.
Insert the lower end of the petiole into
the medium. One or more new plants
will form at the base of the petiole.
The leaf may be severed from the new
plants when they have their own roots,
and the petiole reused. This method is
used for African violets.

Whole leaf with petiole

Whole leaf without petiole

b. Whole leaf without petiole: This is

used for plants with sessile leaves. In-
sert the cutting vertically into the me-
dium. A new plant will form from the
axillary buds. The leaf may be re-
moved when the new plant has its own
roots. This method is used with jade
plants.

c. Split vein: Detach a leaf from the stock

plant. Slit its veins on the lower leaf
surface. Lay and pin the cutting, lower
side down, on the medium. New plants
will form at each cut. If the leaf tends
to curl up, hold it in place by covering
the margins with the rooting medium.
This method is used with Rex bego-
nias. A plastic bag around the con-
tainer and leaf will help keep the leaf
from drying out.

Leaf section
d. Leaf sections: This method is fre-

quently used with snake plant (Sanse-
vieria) and Rex begonias. Cut begonia
leaves into wedges with at least one

main vein. Lay leaves flat on the me-
dium. A new plant will arise at the
vein.
Cut snake plant leaves into 2-inch sec-
tions. Consistently make the lower cut
slanted and the upper cut straight so
you can tell which is the top. Insert the
cuttings vertically into the medium.
Eventually a new plant will appear at
the base of the cutting. These and
other succulent cuttings will rot if kept
too moist. No plastic bag is needed
around succulents.

5. Root cuttings—Root cuttings are usually
taken from 2- to 3-year-old plants during
their dormant season when they have a
large carbohydrate supply. Root cuttings
of some species produce new shoots,
which then form their own root systems,
while root cuttings of other plants de-
velop root systems before producing new
shoots.
a. Plants with large roots: Make a

straight top cut and a slanted cut 2 to 6
inches below the first cut. This will
help you determine what portion is the
top. Store about 3 weeks in moist saw-
dust, peat moss, or sand at 40°F. Re-
move from storage. Insert the cutting
vertically with the top approximately
level with the surface of the rooting
medium. This method is often used
outdoors.

Plants with small roots

Plants with large roots

b. Plants with small roots: Take a 2- to
3-inch section of root. Insert the cut-
ting horizontally about 1/2 inch below
the medium surface. This method is
usually used indoors or in a hotbed.

B. Layering

Stems still attached to their parent plants
may form roots where they touch a rooting

Chapter 3, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

medium. Severed from the parent plant
later, the rooted stem becomes a new plant.
This method of vegetative propagation,
called layering, promotes a high success rate
because it prevents water stress and the loss
of carbohydrate shortage that plagues cut-
tings.
Some plants layer themselves naturally, but
sometimes plant propagators assist the pro-
cess. Layering is enhanced by wounding
one side of the stem or by bending it very
sharply.
1. Tip layering—Dig a hole 3 to 4 inches

deep. Insert the shoot tip and cover it
with soil. The tip grows downward first,
then bends sharply and grows upward.
Roots form at the bend, and the recurved
tip becomes a new plant. Remove the tip
layer from the mother plant and plant it in
early spring or fall. Examples: purple and
black raspberries and trailing blackberries.

Tip layering

Simple layering

2. Simple layering—Bend the stem to the

ground. Cover part of it with soil, leaving
the last 6 to 12 inches exposed. Bend the
tip into a vertical position and stake it in
place. The sharp bend will often induce
rooting, but wounding the lower side of
the branch may help. Examples: rhodo-
dendron and honeysuckle.

3. Compound layering—This method works

for plants with flexible stems. Bend the
stem to the rooting medium as for simple
layering, but alternately cover and expose
stem sections. Wound the lower side of
stem sections to be covered. Examples:
heart-leaf philodendron and pothos.

4. Mound (stool) layering—Cut the plant
back to 1 inch above the ground during
the dormant season. Mound soil over the
emerging shoots in the spring to enhance
their rooting. Examples: gooseberries and
apple rootstocks.

Compound layering

Mound layering

Air layering

5. Air layering—Air layering is used to

propagate some indoor plants with thick
stems, or to rejuvenate them when they
become leggy. Make an upward slanting
cut one half way through the stem just
below a node. Hold the slit open with a
toothpick laid sideways or a bit of sphag-
num moss. Surround the wound with wet,
unmilled sphagnum moss. Wrap plastic
or foil around the sphagnum moss and tie
it in place above and below the wound.
When roots pervade the moss, cut the
plant off below the root ball. Examples:
dumbcane and rubber tree.

Note: The following propagation methods can all
be considered types of layering, as the new
plants form before they are detached from
their parent plants.

6. Stolons and runners—A stolon is a hori-

zontal, often fleshy stem that can root and
produce new shoots where it touches the
medium. A runner is a slender stem that
originates in a leaf axil and grows along
the ground or downward from a hanging
basket, producing a new plant at its tip.
Plants that produce stolons or runners are

propagated by severing the new plants
from their parent stems. Plantlets at the
tips of runners may be rooted while still
attached to the parent, or detached and
placed in a rooting medium. Examples:
strawberry and spider plant.

7. Offsets—Plants with a rosetted stem of-
ten reproduce by forming new shoots at
their base or in leaf axils. Sever the new
shoots from the parent plant after they
have developed their own root system.
Unrooted offsets of some species may be
removed and placed in a rooting medium.
Some of these must be cut off, while oth-
ers may simply be lifted off of the parent
stem. Examples: date palm, haworthia,
bromeliads, and many cacti.

8. Separation—Separation is a term applied
to a form of propagation by which plants
that produce bulbs or corms multiply.
a. Bulbs: New bulbs form beside the

originally planted bulb. Separate these
bulb clumps every 3 to 5 years for
largest blooms and to increase bulb
number. Dig up the clump after the
leaves have withered. Gently pull the
bulbs apart and replace them immedi-
ately so that their roots can begin to
develop. Small, new bulbs may not
flower for 2 or 3 years, but large ones
should bloom the first year. Examples:
tulip and narcissus.

Separation corms

b. Corms: A large new corm forms on

top of the old corm, and tiny cormels
form around the large corm. After the
leaves wither, dig up the corms and
allow them to dry in indirect light for
2 or 3 weeks. Remove the cormels,
then gently separate the new corm
from the old corm. Dust all new corms

with a fungicide and store in a cool
place until planting time. Examples:
crocus and gladiolus.

Division

C. Division

Plants with more than one rooted crown
may be divided and the crowns planted
separately. If the stems are not jointed, gen-
tly pull the plants apart. If the crowns are
united by horizontal stems, cut the stems
and roots with a sharp knife to minimize in-
jury. Divisions of some outdoor plants
should be dusted with a fungicide before
they are replanted. Examples: snake plant,
iris, prayer plant, and day lilies.
1. Most perennials left in the same place for

more than 3 years are likely to be over-
grown, overcrowded, have dead or un-
sightly centers, and in need of basic feed-
ing and soil amendment. The center of
the clump will grow poorly, if at all, and
the flowers will be sparse. The clump
will deplete the fertility of the soil as the
plant crowds itself.
a. To divide mature clumps of perenni-
als, select only vigorous side shoots
from the outer part of the clump. Dis-
card the center of the clump. Divide
the plant into sections of three to five
shoots each. Be careful not to over-
divide; too small a section will not
give much color the first year after re-
planting.

b. Divide perennials when the plants are
dormant, just before a new season of
growth, or in the fall so they can be-
come established before the ground
freezes.

D. Grafting

Grafting and budding are methods of
asexual plant propagation that join plant
parts so they will grow as one plant. These

Chapter 3, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

3 - 14

techniques are used to propagate cultivars
that will not root well as cuttings or whose
own root systems are inadequate. One or
more new cultivars can be added to existing
fruit and nut trees by grafting or budding.
1. The portion of the cultivar that is to be

propagated is called the scion. It consists
of a piece of shoot with dormant buds
that will produce the stem and branches.
The rootstock, or stock, provides the new
plant’s root system and sometimes the
lower part of the stem. The cambium is a
layer of cells located between the wood
and bark of a stem from which new bark
and wood cells originate.

2. Four conditions must be met for grafting
to be successful: (1) The scion and root-
stock must be compatible, (2) each must
be at the proper physiological stage, (3)
the cambial layers of the scion and stock
must meet, and (4) the graft union must
be kept moist until the wound has healed.
a. Cleft grafting: Cleft grafting is often

used to change the cultivar or top
growth of a shoot or a young tree (usu-
ally a seedling). It is especially suc-
cessful if done in the early spring.
Collect scion wood 3/8- to 5/8-inch in
diameter. Cut the limb or small tree
trunk off at the area that it is to be re-

top; incorrect method below)

surfaces should be waxed over.

worked. Make a 2-inch vertical cut
through the center of the limb or trunk.
Be careful not to tear the bark. Keep
this cut wedged apart. Cut the lower
end of each scion piece into a wedge.
Prepare two scion pieces 3 to 4 inches
long. Insert the scions at the outer
edges of the cut in the stock. Tilt the
top of the scion slightly outward and
the bottom slightly inward to be sure
the cambial layers of the scion and
stock touch. Remove the wedge prop-
ping the slit open and cover all cut sur-
faces with grafting wax.

b. Veneer or bark grafting. Unlike most
grafting methods, bark grafting can be

Bark graft

used on large limbs, although these are
often infected before the wound can
completely heal. Collect scion wood
3/8- to 1/2-inch in diameter when the
plant is dormant, and store the wood
wrapped in moist paper in a plastic bag
in the refrigerator. Saw off the limb or
trunk of the rootstock to be worked. In
the spring, when the bark easily sepa-
rates from the wood, make a 1- to 2-
inch diagonal cut on one side of the
scion, and a 1 1/2-inch diagonal cut on
the other side. Leave two buds above
the longer cut. Slice through the bark
of the stock cutting a little wider than
the scion. Insert the scion between the
bark and wood with the longer cut
against the wood. Nail the graft in
place with flat-headed wire nails.
Cover all wounds with grafting wax.

c. Whip or tongue grafting: This method
is often used for material 1/4- to 1/2-

duced as the new grafted variety in-
creases until at the end of 1 or 2 years,
the new variety has completely taken
over. Completely removing all the limbs
of the old variety at the time of grafting
will increase the shock to the tree and
cause excessive suckering. Also, the sci-
ons may grow too fast, making them sus-
ceptible to wind damage.

E. Budding

Budding, or bud grafting, is the union of
one bud (attached to a small piece of bark)
from the scion to the rootstock. It is espe-
cially useful when scion material is limited.
It is also faster and forms a stronger union
than grafting.
1. Patch budding—Plants with thick bark

should be patch budded. This is done
while the plants are actively growing, so
their bark slips easily. Remove a rectan-
gular piece of bark from the rootstock.
Cut a matching rectangular piece with a
bud and piece of bark from the scion to
cover this wound. If the rootstock’s bark
is thicker than that of the scion, pare it
down to meet the thinner bark so that
when the union is wrapped, the patch will
be held firmly in place.

2. Chip budding—This budding method can

be used when the bark is not slipping. A

downward cut is made at a 45 degree
angle about one quarter through the root-
stock. About 1 inch above the first cut, a
second cut is made slicing downward and
inward until it connects with the first cut.
The cuts removing the bud from the bud

inch in diameter. The scion and root-
stock are usually of the same diameter,
but the scion may be narrower than the
stock. This strong graft heals quickly
and provides excellent cambial con-
tact. Make one 2 1/2-inch sloping cut
at the top of the rootstock and a match-
ing cut on the bottom of the scion. On
the cut surface, slice downward into
the stock and up into the scion so the
pieces will interlock. Fit the pieces to-
gether, then tie and wax the union.

3. Care of the graft—Very little success in
grafting will be obtained unless proper
care is maintained for the following year
or two. If a binding material such as
strong cord or nursery tape is used on the
graft, this must be cut shortly after
growth starts to prevent girdling. Rubber
budding strips have some advantages
over other materials. They expand with
growth and usually do not need to be cut,
as they deteriorate and break after a short
time. It is also an excellent idea to inspect
the grafts after 2 or 3 weeks to see if the
wax has cracked, and if necessary, rewax
the exposed areas. After this, the union
will probably be strong enough and no
more waxing will be necessary.

4. Limbs of the old variety that are not se-
lected for grafting should be cut back at
the time of grafting. The total leaf surface
of the old variety should be gradually re-

stick are made just as those in the root-
stock, except the lower cut is made about
1/4-inch below a bud. Fit the bud chip to
the stock and wrap the union.

3. T-budding—This is the

most commonly used
budding technique.
When the bark is slip-
ping, make a vertical
cut through the bark of
the rootstock, avoiding
any buds on the stock.
Make a horizontal cut
at the top of the vertical
cut (in a T shape) and
loosen the bark by
twisting the knife at the
intersection. Remove a shield-shaped
piece of the scion, including a bud, bark,
and a thin section of wood. Push the
shield under the loosened stock bark.
Wrap the union, leaving the bud exposed.

T-bud

Care of buds—Place the bud in the rootstock

in August. Force the bud to develop the fol-
lowing spring by cutting the stock off 3 to 4
inches above the bud. The new shoot may
be tied to the resulting stub to prevent dam-
age from the wind. After the shoot has made
a strong union with the stock, cut the stub
off close to the budded area.

F. Plant Tissue Culture

Tissue culture is a mass of undifferentiated
callus tissue growing on an artificial me-
dium, separately from the plant from which
it originated. Size increases by cell division.
After about 4 to 6 weeks, the mass of cells
is large enough to divide into sections and
reculture to produce additional tissue cul-
tures. This procedure is usually done in a
laboratory or under laboratory conditions.
A tissue culture can be started from a vari-
ety of plant parts that have cells capable of
dividing. Usually tissues near the vascular
area of stems and roots proliferate best, but
cultures have been started from fruits, en-
dosperm, pollen, and embryos. To read
more about this exciting method of propaga-
tion refer to books in your local library.

Soils and Fertilizers

V. J. Parker-Clark and R. V. Vodraska

Vickie J. Parker-Clark, District I Extension Director, Coeur d’Alene, and

Robert V. Vodraska, Former Extension Educator, Twin Falls County, Twin Falls

I. Four Basic Soil Components

1. Mineral matter—about 40 to 50 percent of

the soil.

2. Organic matter—about 0.5 to 5 percent of

the soil.

3/4. Air + Water = 50 percent of the soil volume.

Note: Under wet soil conditions there is

little air. Under dry conditions there
is little water.

II. Three Principal Mineral Constituents

in Soils
A. Sand

Particles range in size from 1.0 to 0.02 mil-
limeters (mm). Sands are mainly structural
components of soil. They have little or no
chemical activity; they do not hold plant nu-
trients, and they can hold only small
amounts of water. Sands are highly perme-
able to water movement and are considered
very droughty.

B. Silt

Particles range in size from 0.02 to 0.002
mm. Silt particles carry a weak negative
charge and are capable of holding small
amounts of plant nutrients. Due to fine par-
ticle size, silty soils hold large amounts of
water, and water movement through silty
soils is generally quite slow.

C. Clay

Particle sizes are smaller than 0.002 mm.
Clay particles carry strong negative charges
capable of attracting all positively charged
ions in the soil; as a consequence, clays are
called the storehouse for plant nutrients.
Fine particle size also equates to high water

holding capacity and can result in slow
movement of water. Although there may be
more total pore space in clay soils than in
sands, most of the pore space in clay soils
hold water, whereas most of the pore space
in sand is large and holds mostly air. When
clay soils are compacted, they frequently
will take on colors of blue or red and may
even have a foul odor. They are then said to
be anaerobic (containing little or no oxy-
gen).

III. Soil Texture

Soil textural classification refers to the per-

centages of sedimentation in the water method for
particles of sand, silt, and clay in the soil me-
dium. See Fig. 1 to determine the texture of a par-
ticular soil.

IV. Soil Structure

The arrangement of soil particles or their ag-

gregates is referred to as soil structure. If soils are
worked when too wet, the aggregates can break
down, forming a higher percentage of small pores
that hold more water and less air. These soils can
be said to be structureless until reaggregation oc-
curs. Soil structure is the aggregation of sand, silt,
and clay into shapes with distinct sizes and
strengths (Fig. 2).

V. Organic Matter—The Supplier of Plant

Foods

Soil organic matter (OM) represents an accu-

mulation of partially decayed and partially resyn-
thesized plant and animal residues. A multitude
of adverse soil/plant relationships can be cor-
rected with good management of soil organic
matter.

Chapter 4, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

4 - 2

A. Adequate Organic Matter (3 to 5 percent)

B. Carbon/Nitrogen (C:N) Ratio

1. Contributes to friable soil through a

granulation of soil particles.

2. Provides a major source of three nutri-
ents—nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur.

3. Increases water holding capacity.
4 Increases soil air.
5. Regulates nutrient releases.
6. Assures that soils are neither too wet nor
too dry and is a buffer against extremes
in toxic conditions.

7. Provides an energy source for soil micro-

organisms (plants and animals).

This is an important management tool.
1. Plant residues and manures are made up

largely of the following:
a. Sugars, starches, and simple proteins

that decompose rapidly.

b. Crude proteins.
c. Hemicelluloses.
d. Celluloses.
e. Lignin, fats, waxes, etc., that decom-

pose slowly.

2. The rate of decay and release of nutrients

to the soil varies greatly, as do the de-

as they “break down” plant residue. Saw-
dust (made primarily of lignins and cellu-
lose) utilizes vast amounts of energy in
merely maintaining the life of the micro-
organisms that are digesting it. A major
product of plant decay is nitrogen (N),
while the undigested portion is primarily
carbon (C). We like to maintain a ratio in
our soil organic matter of about 10 car-
bons to 1 nitrogen (C:N ratio of 10:1).
The C:N ratio for some common mulches
is shown in Table 1.

VI. pH—An Important Factor
A. Adaptive to Soil Conditions

Each plant species is adapted to specific
acidic, neutral, or alkaline soil conditions.
When ailing plants fail to respond to fertil-
izer application, usually this important acid-
alkaline relationship (soil pH) is out of bal-
ance. The pH scale runs from 0 to 14. Seven
is neutral, values below 7 are acid, and
those above 7 are alkaline. These numbers
represent a mathematical logarithmic term,
for example:

pH 8—10 times as alkaline as pH 7
pH 7—Neutral
pH 6—10 times as acidic as pH 7
pH 5—100 times as acidic as pH 7
pH 4—1,000 times as acidic as pH 7

B. pH and Nutrient Availability

The chart in Fig. 3 shows how pH affects
the availability of nutrients.

C. Correcting Soil pH

1. To make soils more acid—Use soil test
values; otherwise apply 10 to 15 pounds
garden sulfur per 1,000 ft2 or 1 to 1.5
pounds garden sulfur per 100 ft2.

Chapter 4, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

4 - 4

2. To make soils less acid—Use soil test

values; otherwise apply 100 to 200
pounds agricultural lime per 1,000 ft2.

Note: The effectiveness of the above rec-

ommended soil amendments de-
pends upon their fineness and con-
tact with soil particles. Where pos-
sible, thoroughly mix amendments
into the top 8 inches of soil.

VII. Ion Exchange

A. Definitions

1. Ion—An electrically charged particle. In

soils, an ion refers to an electrically
charged element or combination of ele-
ments resulting from the breaking up of
an electrolyte in solution. Since most soil

solutions are very dilute, many of the
salts exist as ions. For example, all or
part of the potassium chloride (muriate of
potash) in most soils exists as potassium
ions and chloride ions.

2. Cation—Positively charged ion.

Example: potassium.

3. Anion—Negatively charged ion.

Example: chloride.

4. Cation exchange—The interaction (ex-

change) between a cation in solution and
another cation on the surface of an active
material (clay or organic matter).

5. Cation exchange capacity (CEC)—The
sum total of exchangeable cations that a
soil can absorb. This term is expressed in
milliequivalents per 100 grams soil (meq/
100 g).
a. Idaho soils generally have CECs be-

tween 4 and 20 meq/100 g soil.

b. The CEC can hold

+
NH4
K+
Ca++
Mg++
Micronutrient cations—Any pes-
ticides that are positively
charged.

c. The CEC will often prevent positively
charged nutrients and pesticides from
leaching into groundwater or being
carried off by surface waters through
erosion and runoff.

6. Anion exchange—The interaction of an-
ions on the surface of an active material
with those in solution.

7. Anion exchange capacity (AEC)—The
sum total of exchangeable anions that a
soil can absorb expressed in meq/100 g
soil.
a. Idaho soils have a low AEC. In fact,

most soils have no AEC. AEC is found
only in acid soils; therefore, it is not
found in Idaho.

b. The AEC can hold

-
NO3
2 -
SO4
H2PO4

-

Chapter 4, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

4 - 5

Micronutrient anions—Any
negatively charged pesti-
cides.

c. Often the AEC will prevent positively
charged nutrients and pesticides from
leaching into groundwater or surface
waters carrying them off by erosion
and runoff as in Fig. 4.

d. Since soils do not have significant

AECs in Idaho, negatively charged nu-

trients and pesticides move with the
soil water. Often they are lost by
leaching into the groundwater or by
surface water runoff.

B. Nutrient Mobility

1. Nutrients get to plant roots by three ma-

jor processes.
a. Contact exchange.
b. Mass flow.
c. Diffusion.

4. Why?

a. Nitrate and sulfate are anions. A soil

with a high CEC actually repels nitrate
and sulfate. There is nothing in the
system to slow the movement of these
nutrients. Organic material slows NO3
-.
b. Potassium and ammonium are cations.
The CEC slows their movement. They
take longer to reach a plant’s root and
are less likely to leach than nitrate and
sulfate. The effect makes them 10
times slower in movement, and 10
times less likely to leach.

c. Even though phosphate is an anion, it
moves extremely slowly; in fact, phos-
phate moves 100 to 1000 times slower
than nitrate, because the phosphate an-
ion is very reactive in soils. It reacts
with Ca, Ma, and Al and is easily pre-
cipitated. Phosphate anions may move
a distance of only 1 inch in soil during
an entire growing season.

d. Anionic pesticides will probably be-

have like nitrate in soils; cationic pes-
ticides will probably behave like po-
tassium in soils (Fig. 4).

VIII. Soil/Water Relationships

A. Water Infiltration Rate

This is the speed that a soil accepts water
through the surface in inches per hour. The
finer the soil texture, the slower the infiltra-
tion rate and vice versa. Infiltration rates of
your soil will determine the rate of water
application and whether heavy rainfall will
enter the soil or run off (Table 2).

B. Permeability Rate

This term refers to the rate of movement of
water down through the soil profile. Soil
compaction, plow layers, hard pans, clay
layers, or changes in soil texture all can in-
fluence the permeability rate of the soil.

Compacted soils have low water infiltration
rates. Because the soil’s air spaces are dis-
rupted, compacted soils hold smaller
amounts of air and water. Compacted soils
resist root penetration and are poor media
for growth.

D. Water

Regulating the soil water is a major factor in
Idaho. Excessive amounts of soil water are
as harmful as not enough water. Soil air and
soil temperature, two other important essen-
tials to normal plant growth, are directly re-
lated to soil water.

E. Air

Plant roots need oxygen from the air. When
all of the air space in the soil is filled with
water, roots die from lack of oxygen. The
small feeder roots are the first to be killed.
If air is kept out of the soil long enough,
even the larger roots are killed.

F. Root Damage

1. Plants with dead roots may be able to sur-

vive the early spring because the plant
gets some moisture even through the
dead roots. As the days become longer,
warmer, and drier, and as the leaves get
bigger, the plant runs short of water and
wilts. If root damage is severe, the plant
dies.

2. Sometimes a few roots near the surface
will escape damage, and the plants will
get by until the long, comparatively hot
days of July and August. Even though the
plants are watered, the remaining roots
can’t keep up with the needs.

3. Few trees and shrubs can tolerate wet

soils without root damage. Table 3 lists
some that you can use in heavy, wet soils.

G. Water Flow in Soils

1. Three factors affect water flow in soils.
a. Soil texture: Has a major impact on

soil wetting rates and water flow. Fine-
textured soils are slower to wet up, and
water flow is slower; in coarse tex-
tured soils, water flow is much faster,
and gravity has a greater effect on wa-
ter movement.

b. Percent saturation of the soil: In satu-
rated soil, water flow is greater; thus,
there is a greater potential for leaching.

c. Organic matter: As OM increases so

does the soil’s holding capacity.

H. Leaching in Soils

1. Factors affecting leaching of nutrients/

chemicals in soils include:
a. Amount of rainfall/irrigation.
b. Intensity of rainfall/irrigation.
c. Soil texture.
d. Cation/anion exchange capacity.
e. The percentage of organic matter.

2. A comparison of nutrients distribution

with depth—If you broadcast 25 pounds
of N, P, K, S, and Zn per acre, add 3
inches of water as per Fig. 5.

3. Fig. 6 shows a comparison of nutrient
distribution with depth in different soil
textures.

4. Fig. 7 is a comparison of nutrient concen-

trations in the same soil texture (e.g.,
sandy loam) with the addition of different
amounts of water.

IX. Soluble Salts

Soluble salts (sometimes referred to as soil sa-
linity or ECe) is a measure of the accumulation of
salts in the soil. Salts can come from natural sa-
linity of the soil, over applications of fertilizer
and manure, wood ashes, high salts in irrigation
water, or water evaporating seep areas. To see
how soil salinity effects plant growth, refer to
Table 4 on page 10.

X. Plant Nutrients

A. Source

From the soil, plants obtain 13 of the 16 ele-
ments essential to their growth. The other

B. Element Classification

1. Major macronutrients—
Large quantities are re-
quired.
a. Nitrogen (N):

Leaches readily.

b. Phosphorus (P, or in
fertilizers, designated
as phosphate, P2O5):
Does not leach, but
will move with soil
by such means as soil
erosion, etc.

c. Potassium (K, or in

fertilizers designated
as potash, K2O):
Will leach.

2. Secondary macronutri-

ents—Less quantities
required.
a. Calcium (Ca)
b. Magnesium (Mg)
c. Sulfur (S): Will leach.

3. Micronutrients—Small

quantities required.
These usually are at suf-
ficient levels.

ity of leaf crops; increases protein con-
tent of food and feed crops; and feeds
soil microorganisms during their de-
composition of low-nitrogen organic
materials. Nitrogen tends to extend the
length of the plant’s maturity period,
but too much will cause the plants to
fall over (lodge).

b. Deficiency symptoms: Most Idaho
soils are deficient in nitrogen. The
plant turns a sickly, yellowish green;
displays a distinctly slow and dwarfed
growth; and dries up or shows “firing”
of the leaves, a process that starts at
the bottom of the plant. In plants such
as corn and grasses the “firing” starts
at the tips of the bottom leaves and
proceeds down their centers.

2. Phosphorus
a. Function: Phosphorus stimulates early

root functions and growth; gives a
quick and vigorous start to plants;
shortens the plant’s maturity period;
stimulates bloom and helps seed to
form; and strengthens winter hardi-
ness, especially for fall-seeded
grasses.

b. Deficiency symptoms: Many Idaho
soils are deficient in phosphorus, es-
pecially those soils influenced by vol-
canic ash. The plants come up and
start off slowly. Under conditions of
severe deficiency, the leaves, stems,
and branches become stunted, particu-
larly in the seedling stage. The plant
tends to have small, slender stalks and
low yields of grain, fruit, and seed.
Phosphorus deficiency leads to a lack
of abundant, healthy flower clusters in
most annuals, biennials, and perenni-
als.

3. Potassium

a. Function: Potassium serves as a nutri-

ent regulator; increases vigor,
strength, and disease resistance;
makes stalks and stems stiffer; helps
early roots form and grow; improves
winter hardiness.

b. Deficiency symptoms: Idaho soils are
not usually deficient in potassium. A
deficiency in potassium may cause the
tissue to turn brown and dry up (“fire
up”), particularly on the bottom leaves
of crops. This sign of potassium defi-
ciency differs from the firing caused
by a nitrogen deficiency in that potas-
sium deficiency caused firing around
the edge of the leaf. With nitrogen, the
firing goes down the center of the leaf.
Legumes show potassium deficiency
symptoms first in the tip, and then
around the leaf edges. Potassium defi-
ciency results in a premature loss of
leaves and smaller than normal flow-
ers. Plants such as corn fall down be-
fore maturing because of poor stalk
development.

Chapter 4, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

4 - 10

4. Sulfur

a. Function: Sulfur promotes thicker and
sturdier roots and leaf stems; and aids
in overall leaf color. Sulfur is essential
for protein synthesis and nodule for-
mation in legumes.

b. Deficiency symptoms: Most northern
Idaho soils are deficient in sulfur. The
deficiency leads to young leaves with
a light green to yellowish color; in
some plants, older tissue may be af-
fected also. The plants become small
and spindly; there is a retarded growth
rate and delayed maturity.

5. Calcium

a. Function: Calcium aids in the develop-
ment of root structure and helps to cor-
rect soil acidity. It is an essential part
of the cell wall structure and must be
present for the formation of new plant
cells.

b. Deficiency symptoms: Idaho soils usu-
ally are nondeficient in calcium. Defi-
ciency results in the death of the grow-
ing points on plants, and the root tips
are also affected. The deficiency can
be recognized by the abnormal, dark
green appearance of the foliage, by
premature shedding of blossoms and
buds, and by weakened stems.

6. Magnesium

a. Function: Magnesium is essential for
photosynthesis, and serves as an acti-
vator for many plant enzymes required
in growth processes.

b. Deficiency symptoms: There are ad-

equate quantities of magnesium in the
majority of Idaho soils. Magnesium
deficiency is most likely to be found in
sandy, acid soils; it results in a charac-
teristic interveinal chlorosis (yellow-
ing) in older leaves and a curling of
leaves upward along margins.

D. Functions of Micronutrients and Deficiency

Symptoms
1. Zinc

a. Function: Zinc aids in the synthesis of
indoleacetic acid (IAA), an important
plant growth regulator.

b. Deficiency symptoms: Zinc deficien-
cies are rare in northern Idaho, though
they occur in southern Idaho. Tree
crops, grapes, beans, onions, tomatoes,
and corn can be deficient in zinc. The
characteristics of this deficiency are de-
creased in stem length, rosetting of ter-
minal leaves, and reduced fruit bud for-
mation. There also will be mottled
leaves (interveinal chlorosis), a dieback
of twigs after the first year, and a strip-
ing or banding on corn leaves.

2. Iron

a. Function: Iron is required for the for-
mation of chlorophyll in plant cells; it
serves as an activator for biochemical
processes such as respiration, photosyn-
thesis, and symbiotic nitrogen fixation.
b. Deficiency symptoms: Iron deficiencies

are not a major problem in field crop
production in Idaho. Deficiencies are
usually found in southern Idaho on the
occasions when they are a problem.
They occur most likely in soils with a
high pH and poor aeration. Plants most
often affected are turf, certain tree
crops, and ornamentals. They display
interveinal chlorosis of young leaves.
Veins remain green except in severe
cases. Then there may be twig dieback
or the death of entire limbs or plants.

3. Manganese

a. Function: Manganese assists iron in

chlorophyll formation and serves as an
activator for enzymes in growth pro-
cesses. Tree crops may have trouble
growing well when the soil has this de-
ficiency.

b. Deficiency symptoms: Most areas in
Idaho are not deficient in manganese,
with the exception of the Kootenai
River Valley of Boundary County. You
can spot manganese deficiency when
plants display interveinal chlorosis of
young leaves, show a gradation of pale
green coloration with darker color next
to veins, and display no sharp distinc-
tion between veins and interveinal areas
(as with iron deficiency).

Chapter 4, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

4 - 11

4. Copper

a. Function: Copper is the activator of

several enzymes in plants.

b. Deficiency symptoms: Copper defi-

ciencies are generally only seen in
northern Idaho, and in plants growing
on soils containing more than 8 per-
cent organic matter. A deficiency in
copper results in stunted growth; die-
back of terminal shoots in trees; poor
pigmentation; and wilting and eventual
death of leaf tips. Copper deficiencies
are very difficult to diagnose by sight.

5. Boron

a. Function: Boron aids in differentiation
of meristem cells; it regulates the me-
tabolism of carbohydrates in plants.
b. Deficiency symptoms: Many Idaho
soils are boron deficient. The results
are a death of terminal growth, which
causes lateral buds to develop and pro-
duces a “witch’s broom” of thickened,
curled, wilted, and chlorotic leaves;
soft or necrotic spots in fruit or tubers;
and reduced flowering or improper
pollination.
6. Molybdenum

a. Function: Molybdenum is required by

plants for utilization of nitrogen.

b. Deficiency symptoms: Northern Idaho
soils are widely deficient in molybde-
num, but the problems only appear on
legumes. The symptoms are the same as
those in sulfur and nitrogen deficiencies.

7. Chlorine

a. Function: Chlorine is required in photo-

synthetic reactions in plants.

b. Deficiency symptoms: Not deficient in

Idaho.

XI. Fertilizers

Every mixed fertilizer or individual material

sold has a guaranteed analysis written on the bag
stating the amounts of available nitrogen (N),
available phosphate (P2O5), and soluble potash
(K2O), in that order (Fig. 8). The three numbers
always are in percentages by weight.

In addition, certain secondary and micronutri-
ents may also be included and will be so stated.

Caution—Apply the amount that is recom-
mended, or that you know is desirable from past
experience.

Many brands of fertilizers and nearly as many

formulas are on the market. Select a brand that
supplies the nitrogen (N), phosphate (P2O5), and
potash (K2O) in approximately the ratio your soil
test indicates. The exact ratio is not critical. For
example, if your test indicates you should use 1
pound of nitrogen (N), 2 pounds of phosphate
(P2O5) and 1 pound of potash (K2O), the ratio in-
dicated is 1-2-1; you could use a 10-20-10, a
5-10-5, a 6-10-4, or an 8-17-7 analysis fertilizer.
All of these are in approximate 1-2-1 ratios.

XII. Fertilizer Terminology

A. Fertilizer

Any substance added to the soil (or sprayed
on plants) to supply those elements required
in plant nutrition.

grade  is  the  summary  of  the  nitrogen,  phos-
phate, and potash (by weight) contained in the

XIV. Fertilizer Types

A. Nitrogen

1. Gas forms.

a. Ammonia (82-0-0) gas: Transported in

pressurized containers.

Note: Special application equipment

needed.

2. Solid forms.

a. Ammonium nitrate (34-0-0 or 33-0-0):

Half of N is in ammonium form and
half is in nitrate form.
• 80 percent is used in agriculture.
• 20 percent is used in the manufac-

ture of explosives.

b. Urea 45-0-0: Rapidly replacing ammo-

nium nitrate as the most widely used
fertilizer because of:
• Economy of production.
• Higher percentage N content.
• Fewer pollution problems during

manufacturing.

c. Ammonium sulfate (21-0-0-24) con-
tains 24 percent sulfur. This fertilizer
is popular in areas where sulfur is defi-
cient because it contains sulfur.

3. Slow-release solid forms—Reduce nitro-
gen leaching losses, reduce salt damage
to plants, and result in a release of nitro-
gen at a rate that is optimal for plant
growth. These materials are much more
expensive, but the increase in nutrient
efficiency may offset the increase in cost
if used properly.
a. Sulfur coated urea (36-0-0-6).
b. IBDU (Isobutylidene-Diuria).

4. Nitrogen solutions.

a. Solution 32 (32-0-0) contains urea and

ammonium nitrate.

B. Phosphorus

1. Rock phosphate (0-25-0)—The phospho-
rus is not readily available on calcarious
soils.

Chapter 4, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

4 - 13

2. Triple superphosphate (TSP, 0-44-0 or
0-45-0)—Good, high-analysis phospho-
rus source.

3. Monoammonium phosphate (MAP, 11-

55-0, 13-52-0)—An excellent phosphorus
source with low nitrogen/high phosphorus.
4. Diammonium phosphate (DAP, 16-48-0,

19-52-0)—Contains medium nitrogen/
high phosphorus and is an excellent
mixed fertilizer.

5. Urea-ammonium phosphates (UAP or

UAPP, 10-34-0)—Becoming more com-
mon; high analysis.

C. Potassium

1. Potassium chloride (KCl, 0-0-60)—Most
common potassium source, 60 percent K2O.
2. Potassium sulfate (K2SO4, 0-0-50)—Sec-
ond most common source, 50 percent K2O.

3. Other sources—Potassium magnesium

sulfate, potassium nitrate, and wood ash.

D. Sulfur

1. Elemental sulfur—98 percent sulfur,

acidifies soils.

2. Nitrogen/sulfur.

XV. Mulches

Mulches fall into two categories: organic

and inorganic.
A. Organic Mulches

Organic mulches includes grass clippings,
hay, straw, bark, sawdust, wood shavings,
leaves, and newspapers. You can use almost
any plant material for mulching as long as it
allows air and water to penetrate to the soil
below. Coarse-textured material, such as
stemmy hay, straw, wood shavings, and
chips, are more desirable than fine-textured
materials such as leaves and sawdust. If you
use fine materials, loosen them occasionally
to keep from sealing the soil surface.

B. Inorganic Mulches

Inorganic mulches include plastic films,
mat-type weed barriers, aluminum foil, and
even old carpets. Although inorganic
mulches provide some of the same benefits
as organic mulches, you cannot incorporate

them into the soil at the end of the growing
season. You must remove them and store
them. Perforate plastic films to allow water
and air free passage.

C. Effectiveness

The effectiveness of mulches depends upon
the material you are using and the weed spe-
cies involved. You only need a thin layer of
mulch to conserve soil moisture, and 2 or
more inches to control weeds.
1. Summer mulches—Use summer mulches

to control weeds, reduce water evapora-
tion from the soil, stabilize water tem-
perature, and reduce fruit rot on bared
soil. Incorporated summer organic
mulches into the soil in the fall to im-
prove soil structure.

2. Winter mulches—Use winter mulches to

reduce water loss from evergreen plant
tissue and to stabilize soil temperatures.
This will minimize perennial crop heav-
ing caused by alternate freezing and
thawing. Applying winter mulches too
early in the fall may result in more winter
injury than if you did not apply a mulch.

D. Problems

Organic mulches can introduce weed seeds
as a mulch contaminant, or in the case of
cereal straw, small grain seed. The mulch
may attract rodents, insects, and other pests
as an over-wintering site. Mulching too
soon in the spring can keep soils cool reduc-
ing the growth of warm season crops. If you
use bark, wood shavings, sawdust, or straw,
it may be necessary to incorporate additional
nitrogen fertilizer into the soil in the fall.

XVI. Green Manure and Cover Crops

By definition you grow and incorporate
green manure crops into the soil to improve
the soil while you grow cover crops primarily
to reduce soil erosion and the leaching of nu-
trients. Usually, green manure crops are annu-
als and cover crops are perennials, either le-
gumes or grasses. You can incorporate cover
crops into the soil and use them as green ma-
nure crops.
A. Effectiveness

When managed properly, green manure and
cover crops both add nitrogen to the soil for

leased.

the plants that follow them. See Table 5 for
the approximate nitrogen percentages on a
dry matter basis of some cover crops used
as a green manure. They tend to increase the
level of fertility and soil humus. They im-
prove the soil’s physical properties of ag-
gregation, porosity, bulk density, and per-
meability. Their effects are more pro-
nounced on fine-textured soil than on coarse
ones.

B. Green Manure

1. The efficiency of using green manure
crops depends on the soil, climate, and
plant’s grown. The conditions favoring
microbial growth determines the rate of
decay of the organic residues. Warm soil,
proper aeration, and ample soil moisture
increase microbial growth. The decompo-
sition releases carbon dioxide and weak
acids that act on insoluble soil minerals
and release nutrients in addition to nutri-
ents from insoluble minerals. The chemi-
cal composition of the plants affects their
value for green manuring.

2. Green manure crops have little influence

on organic matter if cultivation is con-
tinuous. In cooler climate, green manure
can increase organic matter and nitrogen.
In warmer regions, cultivation speeds up
the rate of decomposition, and little or no
increase of organic matter is observed.

3. Using green manure can lower bulk den-
sity of the soil and enhance porosity. Im-
proved aggregation allows more space
between soil particles, and therefore, less
weight of soil by volume.

4. As grasses and cereal grains reach matu-

rity they can tie up nitrogen, so you
should incorporate them into the soil
early in the growing season.

C. Cover Crops

1. Use cover crops for alleyways in or-

chards and vineyards to prevent weeds
growing and in gardens for pathways.
Usually, they require mowing two or
three times a year, fertilization, and suffi-
cient moisture. See Table 6 on the next
page for a recommended list of cover
crops for Idaho.

2. Cover crops reduce losses from leaching

of nitrogen, potassium, and some other
nutrients—especially when soils are light
and sandy. Good ground cover reduces
soil erosion by slowing down the beating
action of rain on soil particles reducing
water runoff. Plant cover increases the
rate that water filters into the soil. Leaves
and stems catch the rain and roots open
channels for water.

3. Deep-rooted plants, such as some of the

legumes, help open up soils with re-
stricted subsoils. Plants grown for short
term usually have little effect on heavy
subsoils.

4. Perennial sod or cover crops increase soil
organic matter and nitrogen. Legumes are
superior to nonlegumes.

5. Some negative aspects of cover crops are
that they compete with the main crop for
nutrients and moisture. They can invade
the main crop, so they require mainte-
nance. Also, cover crops can provide a
safe haven for gophers, mice, insects, and
diseases that can invade the main crop.

Horticultural Equipment

Management

George F. Gardner, Former Extension Educator, Bannock County, Pocatello

G. F. Gardner

I. Equipment Selection

The type of equipment used to prepare your gar-
den will depend on the size of the garden, as well
as your physical ability, time, and budget. Op-
tions include a spade or shovel, a power rotary
tiller, a small garden tractor, or a full-sized farm
tractor.

A. Hand Tools for Cultivating

The minimum equipment needed by most
gardeners is a shovel or spade, a hoe, a rake,
and a trowel. A wide selection of styles is
available. The right choice is one of per-
sonal preference and price. You can get the
best value by knowing each tool’s uses and
particular qualities.
1. Shovel—A dish-shaped blade mounted to

the handle at an angle and is used for
moving soil. A garden shovel with a
pointed blade is lighter and smaller than
most other shovels and is well suited for
use in the garden.

Shovel

Spade

2. Spade—A flat blade and designed for

cutting rather than lifting or moving soil.
A spade is an excellent tool for shaping
straight-sided trenches and edging beds.

Note: Shovels and spades come with long handles
in standard or D-shaped styles. Choice of
handle style will depend on personal pref-
erence: long handles offer greater leverage
and are less tiring to use; short handles are
often thicker and stronger. For general pur-
pose digging, lifting, and moving, a long-
handled shovel is ideal.

3. Spading fork—Another useful

digging tool. It is ideal for
breaking and turning heavy
soil and for loosening sub-
soil layers when double
digging a bed. Turning
coarse compost,
spreading
mulches, and dig-
ging root crops are
other jobs suitable
for a spading fork.

4. Hoe—Essential in any garden

for preparing the seed bed,
removing weeds, and
breaking up encrusted
soil. Several different
hoe styles are available.

5. Pointed hoe—Has a heart-

shaped blade and is lightweight and use-
ful for opening seed furrows and cultivat-
ing between plants.

6. Hula—Or action hoe, is very lightweight

and maneuverable. It is pushed and
pulled just under the soil surface. Be-
cause the blade is relatively thin and
lacks the clod-breaking capabilities of a
heavier hoe, this type of hoe is most eas-

Chapter 5, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

5 - 2

ily used where soil is not compacted and
where weeds have not gotten started.

7. Scuffle hoe—Is somewhat more sturdy,
and is used with a pushing motion rather
than a pushing and pulling motion.

Different kinds of scuffle hoes

8. Square-bladed hoe—Probably the most
commonly used hoe, lends itself well to
many garden tasks.

9. Rake—Useful in clearing the garden of

rocks and debris. It is also helpful in
spreading mulches and smoothing seed-
beds. The right rake depends on your size
and strength and the uses you intend. As
the number of tines increases, the rake
weight also in-
creases. Avoid
choosing a rake
that is so heavy it
will tire you after
a short period of
use. The length
of the rake
handle is impor-
tant too. The tip of the handle should
come up to your ear when you stand up-
right. A handle that is too short will make
your work harder, causing excess bend-
ing and back strain.

10. Trowel—Used for many digging jobs

that do not require a full-sized tool. Espe-
cially in the spring, a trowel is perfect for
transplanting seedlings and bulbs or dig-
ging shallow-rooted weeds.

11. Small hand cultivator—Often sold in sets
with trowels, is useful for weeding small
areas and between closely-spaced plants.
12. Digger—Also called a weeder, cultivator,
or asparagus knife, is a small, useful dig-
ging tool. It is indispensable for digging
up weeds with long taproots, such as dan-
delions or Queen Anne’s lace; or for pry-
ing out Johnson grass rhizomes. It con-

sists of a 10- to 14-inch long solid metal
rod with a two-pronged blade at one end
and a handle at the other. This tool is
practically indestructible and well worth
its price.

13. Pickax—Used to break up extremely

stony or hard-packed soil.

14. Mattock—Used to break up soil, but is

equipped with a cutting blade for remov-
ing large roots. A mattock may also be
used to chop up debris for composting.
15. Wheel cultivator—Has a number of at-
tachments for soil preparation and weed
control and may prove to be a good in-
vestment for those with larger gardens.

B. Power Tools for Cultivation

1. Rototiller—The power rotary tiller is the

tool most commonly purchased by gar-
deners. Whether you need a rototiller de-
pends on the size of your garden, your
capabilities, and the intended uses of the
tiller. Tiller selection may be based on
the nature of the work to be
done, the quality of the
machine, ease of re-
pair, and personal
preference.

Chapter 5, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

5 - 3

The tiller’s engine powers rotating
blades, or tines, which turn the soil and
makes it loose, fluffy, and ready for
planting. It can also chop plant debris and
mix it into the soil. The ability of the
tiller to do these jobs effectively is a
function of its weight, strength, design,
type of tines, and type of soil.
A heavy, powerful tiller is most effective
on stony clay soils, while a smaller tiller
is more appropriate in a small garden or a
garden with light soil. Very lightweight
tillers, known as soil blenders, are de-
signed mainly for raised bed gardening;
however, they are not widely available
and generally must be mail-ordered. A
tiller is a major investment.
Look for tiller features such as: heavy
cast iron, steel plate, and tubing; heavy
bearings; strong welds used during con-
struction; and easily operable controls.
Ask to look at the operator’s manual and
try to determine how simply a tune-up
can be performed. You can save yourself
a great deal of trouble and money if you
can replace plugs and points yourself.
Also consider the locations of service
centers and parts dealers. Careful atten-
tion to your needs, abilities, and price
range is important.
Talk to people who have the types of
tillers that interest you. If possible, bor-
row or rent various types of tillers and
send for information before buying. If
you are considering the purchase of a
used rototiller, plan to do so well ahead
of time so you will not be rushed into a
purchase. If you know little about tillers,
have a mechanically-minded friend
evaluate the models you are considering.
Above all, test each tiller for ease of
starting and operation. An engine that
smokes or runs roughly may require a lot
of work. Tines should operate smoothly
and freely. Check the welds in the
handles to see that they are strong; re-
welding may mean that the handles have
broken at some time, a common problem
in older tillers. Look at the dipstick if
there is one; low oil or very sludgy oil

may mean that the tiller has been poorly
maintained. The oil and other fluids may
also be checked by opening the drain
plugs. Look for excessive dirt around the
engine or in the air filter. This may also
indicate bad maintenance habits.
a. Rear-tine tiller—If gardening is a full-

time business or if you have a large
garden, it would be wise to purchase a
rear-tine tiller. It should be a heavy-
duty machine capable of continued op-
eration. The rear-tine tiller is easier to
control and is smoother in its cultivat-
ing process. It requires less mainte-
nance because it doesn’t bounce
around; leverage is required for con-
trol. New gardeners are sometimes
scared away from these tillers because
they can run away with them.

b. Front-tine tiller—If gardening is sim-
ply a hobby, or if your garden is small,
a front-tine tiller may be suitable.
Front-tine tillers are usually light in
weight, but may require considerable
strength to guide them through the
soil. Operating this type of tiller is
comparable to handling a large floor
polisher such as those used in schools
and hospitals. Leverage is required for
control. New gardeners are sometimes
afraid that these tillers will run away
with them. The front-tine tiller may
not make as straight a path as the
heavier rear-tine type, but it is much
easier to turn. The front-tine tiller is
easy to use in small gardens and in
corner areas.

3. Cordless tools—Most are rechargeable,

come with various cultivating attach-
ments, and can make garden chores more
pleasurable. Cordless tools are especially
useful to those with physical disabilities
that limit strength.

4. Garden shredder—This tool is helpful for
a large garden with a lot of plant wastes.
Hand-operated shredders are slow but
useful if wastes are in small quantities
and are not too coarse. Gasoline shred-
ders are quite expensive and may be dis-
appointing to the gardener who wants to

Chapter 5, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

5 - 4

chip branches and other large materials.
Shredders are best used for shredding
leaves, small branches, and other plant
wastes. A chipper, on the other hand, will
chip large branches and other coarse ma-
terials, but the cost ($1,000) is high.

C. Wheelbarrow or Cart

A wheelbarrow or cart is handy to have in
and around the garden area. It should be
easy to handle when full. Durable construc-
tion is well worth the cost to ensure a long,
useful life. Be sure to choose the size appro-
priate for your physical abilities and garden
needs.
A wheelbarrow generally requires more
strength and control than do most garden
carts, but many of the small carts generally
available are made of relatively flimsy
metal and, though inexpensive, are not par-
ticularly long-lasting or suitable for heavy
items such as rocks.
Consider your needs. If you plan to haul
only light straw, leaves, or sawdust, then a
small cart is suitable. For heavier jobs, a
wheelbarrow or cart is needed.
The newer garden cart models, especially
ones with bicycle-type tires, are made of
heavy plywood and metal and are well-bal-
anced and easy to maneuver.

Note: These carts do, however, cost a lot (up
to several hundred dollars) and a large
storage space. Only serious gardeners,
or those with other uses for these carts,
find them economical. One alternative
is to build your own from one of several
plans available from gardening maga-
zines or private companies.

D. Watering Equipment

Watering is one job that most gardeners
must do at least occasionally. An adequate
water supply may make a big difference in
garden yields. Purchase of watering equip-
ment depends upon available facilities, wa-
ter supply, climate, and garden practices.
Determine whether cultural practices such
as mulching, close plant spacing, shading,
or wide-bed planting will meet most of your
extra water needs, then purchase watering
gadgets accordingly.

1. Spigot—If there is no outdoor spigot near
the garden, the expense of having one in-
stalled may be greater than the benefits
gained, except in very drought-prone ar-
eas, or in the case of a gardener who is
fully dependent on the season’s produce.

2. Rain barrel or garden hose with a fan-
type sprinkler—This simple watering
equipment will suffice where rainfall is
adequate, except occasionally in summer.

3. Water breaker—Useful for small seed-

lings.

4. Drip irrigation system—In areas where

there are extended periods of hot weather
without precipitation, the local water sup-
ply is likely to be short. Since overhead
sprinklers waste water, a drip irrigation
system may be in order. Drip irrigation
puts water right at the roots and doesn’t
wet plant leaves, thus helping to prevent
disease. Timers are available for auto-
matic drip watering systems, but this type
of system is relatively expensive and may
be considered a nuisance by some gar-
deners because of maintenance and re-
placement requirements.

5. The soaker hose—Probably the least ex-
pensive and easiest water system to use.
It is fibrous hose that allows water to
seep out at a slow rate all along its length.
There are also hoses with holes in them
that do basically the same thing. A flow
regulator usually has to be included with
the system so that water can reach the
end of the hose, yet not be sprayed out at
full force. A special double-wall type irri-
gation hose has been developed that helps
to maintain an even flow.

6. Emitter-type system—Best used for small
raised bed or container gardens. With this
sytem, short tubes, or emitters, come off
a main water supply hose. Emitters put
water right at the roots of the desired
plants. This is generally the most expen-
sive form of irrigation and most complex
to set up.

E. Seedling and Planting Tools

Depending on the size of your garden and
your physical abilities, you may want to
consider a row seeder.

Chapter 5, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

5 - 5

1. Seeders—With wheels make easy work

of sowing long rows of corn, beans or
other vegetables. Seeders are available
that make a furrow, drop the seeds prop-
erly spaced, and close up the furrow. It is
not worth the effort to set up a seeder for
small areas. A hand-held seeder is prob-
ably a better choice for this type of work.

2. Broadcast seeders—Are available for
sowing seeds such as rye or wheat for
cover crop, but are generally not neces-
sary for the average home gardener, be-
cause broadcasting is easily done by hand
once you learn the proper technique.

3. Fluid-sowing kits—Contain presprouted
seeds in a gel that prevents drying. These
kits may be purchased, but fluid sowing
devices may be made inexpensively.
F. Environmental Monitoring Equipment

Serious gardeners often invest in equipment
that allows them to moniter the microcli-
mate around the garden or indoors.
1. Rain gauge—An inexpensive device that

helps you determine if enough rain has
fallen for garden plants.

2. Maximum-mimimum thermometer—A
costly, but often useful, device to mea-
sure soil temperature and internal tem-
perature of a compost pile.

3. Light and watering meters—Can be pur-

chased for indoor plant monitoring.
Electronic water meters measure the con-
ductivity of soil, but are often greatly in-
fluenced by fertilizers and other salt con-
centrations, resulting in a variable or in-
accurate measurement of water availabil-
ity. Tensiometers work well for measur-
ing water content.
G. Trellises and Cages

For vining plants, these save space and keep
fruits off the ground, reducing plant damage
and minimizing the amount of stooping re-
quired for harvest. Look for heavy-duty ma-
terials and sturdy designs that will stand up
to rain, wind, and drying. Wire should be
heavy gauge and wood should be treated
with nonphytotoxic (nontaxic to plants) ma-
terials or materials nontoxic to humans.
Metal parts should be rust-proof or rust-
resistant.

If you build your own trellises and cages,
you may save a considerable amount of
money and get better quality.

H. Harvesting Equipment

Varies depending on the size and type of
garden, whether food is to be stored, and the
way in which it is to be processed.
1. Baskets—Useful to most gardeners. Bas-
kets may be purchased at garden or farm
supply stores or sometimes may be
scrounged from local grocery stores or
fruit stands. Berry baskets for carrying
small fruits, baskets with handles for car-
rying vegetables, and peck or bushel bas-
kets for storing fruits and vegetables are
all useful.

2. Fruit pole pickers—Useful and easy to

use for tall fruit trees.

3. A sharp knife—For cutting vegetables off

plants is handy and helps prevent plant
damage.

II. Equipment Purchases and

Maintenance

A. Equipment Purchases

When purchasing tools, buy for quality
rather than quantity. Your tools will be in
frequent use throughout the garden season.
Cheap tools tend to break or dull easily and
may end up making your job unnecessarily
difficult and frustrating. Quality tools will
last and tend to increase in value if well
kept.
Tools should be lightweight for easy han-
dling, but heavy enough to do the job prop-
erly. Metal parts should be of steel, which
will stay sharp, will keep their shape, and
will outlast softer metals. Consumers’
magazines and garden publications fre-
quently have articles explaining what to
look for in tools and listing alternatives to
local hardware stores, which often carry a
single line of tools. Several excellent books
featuring garden tools have been published
and may be available at the library.

B. Equipment Maintenance

Keeping a tool clean and sharp will increase
its usefulness and lengthen its life. Learn the
techniques of sharpening each tool and
practice them frequently. Professional gar-

Chapter 5, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

deners often carry sharpening stones or files
and sharpen their tools every hour or so
while working.
Clean tools after each use. One effective
method is to keep a five-gallon bucket filled
with sand and used motor oil in the tool
shed. At the end of the gardening day, re-
move clinging dirt from tools by plunging
them into the oily sand several times. This
will keep the tools cleaned and oiled, and
will help prevent rusting.
Perhaps the most important step in tool care
is to put tools in their proper place. Tools
left in the garden will rust and break and can
be a safety hazard. Some gardeners paint
handles with a bright color to make their
tools easy to spot.

III. Cultivation Practices

A. Types of Soil Cultivation

1. Plowing—It once was assumed gardens

should be turned yearly with a moldboard
plow, mostly for weed and pest control.
While garden plowing is still a common
practice, turning the soil over completely
has been found to be detrimental in some
cases. It can cause soil compaction, upset
balances of microorganisms, and bury
layers of coarse organic material below
the influence of insects and microbes,
which would otherwise cause the materi-
als to decompose.

2. Chisel plowing—This does not have this
disruptive effect, is one alternative, but it
is limited to sandy or loamy soils. Many
gardeners do not have chisel plows. In
addition, gardeners in non-rural areas
have trouble finding a person who will
plow and disk a garden for a reasonable
price.

3. Rototilling—Most home gardens’ soil
condition is sufficient, as long as plant
debris is not excessive. Rotary tilling
mixes rather than turns the upper layers
of soil. One possible harmful effect of
rototilling is the formation of a compac-
tion layer just beyond the reach of the
tines. Use of deep-rooted cover crops or
double digging can help prevent or allevi-
ate this problem.

4. Hand cultivation—By spading the soil

deeply until it is loose and drains easily,
prepares the soil.

B. Cultivation Time

Fall tillage has several advantages over the
traditional spring plowing. It allows earlier
spring planting, since the basic soil prepara-
tion is already done when spring arrives.
Turning under large amounts of organic
matter in fall is likely to result in better de-
composition because autumn temperatures
are higher than those in early spring, and the
process has more time to take place. Insects,
disease organisms, and perennial weeds
may be reduced by killing or inactivating
them through burial or exposure to harsh
winter weather. The physical condition of
heavy clay soils may be improved by the
alternate freezing and thawing, which break
up hard clods. Fall tilling alone is not rec-
ommended for hillside or steep garden plots
since the soil is exposed all winter and is
subject to erosion when spring rains come.
If a winter cover crop is grown to improve
soil and to prevent erosion, the ground will
have to be tilled in the fall to prepare the
soil for seed and again in spring to turn un-
der the green manure. A cover crop de-
creases erosion of the soil during the winter,
adds organic material when it is incorpo-
rated in the spring, improves soil tilth and
porosity, and adds valuable nutrients.
Spring tillage is better for sandy soils and
those receiving shallow tilling. Generally,
most gardens must be disked or rotary tilled
in the spring to smooth the soil for planting.

C. Cultivation Requirements

Work the soil only when the conditions are
right. Pick up a handful of soil and squeeze
it. If the soil crumbles freely, it should be
about right. Take samples at the surface and
at a 2- to 3-inch depth at several locations in
the garden plot. If the soil is powdery or in
clumps, it may be excessively dry and diffi-
cult to work. If soil sticks to a shovel, or if
the turned surface is shiny and smooth when
spaded, it is still too wet. Working soil
when excessively wet can destroy soil struc-
ture, which may take years to rebuild. Plow-
ing with a tractor when soil is wet is

Chapter 5, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

5 - 7

especaially damaging. It causes the forma-
tion of a compaction layer that will inhibit
root growth. Soils with adequate humus lev-
els generally make cultivation easier be-
cause of their improved structural qualities.
Just before planting, break up large clods of
soil and rake the bed level. Small-seeded
vegetables germinate best in smooth, fine-
surfaced soil. Do not pulverize seedbed soil.
This destroys the structure and promotes
crusting and erosion problems.
Any addition to the soil that improves its
physical or chemical condition is
considerated a soil amendment. Many types
of amendments are available to the home
gardener.

Plant Management

S. M. Bell and G. F. Gardner

Susan M. Bell, Extension Educator, Ada County, Boise

George F. Gardner, Former Extension Educator, Bannock County, Pocatello

I. Plant Selection

Select plants adapted to your cold hardiness zone
and growing season. Woody plant materials
growing in Idaho can survive most winters with-
out damage if they are rated for zones 2 to 4 for
the mountainous areas and zones 4 to 6 for lower
elevations (see Fig. 1 and Chapter 15, “Landscap-
ing,” Section IIIB). Dormant plants can withstand
low temperatures better than those that are not, as
long as low minimum temperatures do not last
too long.
Plants such as vegetables grown from seed should
be selected to fit the length of growing season in
your area. Talk to your local extension educator
who will know your area. In mountainous areas
many microclimates may exist.

II. Plant and Garden Location

A. Plant Location

Choose the right location for the right plant.
Determine the best location by reading the
growing requirements written on the plant
tag, the seed packet, or in a garden book.
Pay close attention to the amount of light
and moisture, range of temperature required,
and type of soil best suited for the plant.
Avoid planting under house eaves and
downspouts. Dripping water can physically
damage plants and cause over watered con-
ditions conducive to root rots.
Avoid planting near sidewalks, driveways,
white-painted fences, and buildings that can
reflect excess light or heat back on to plants
to adversely affect growth. Eastern and
northern exposures are good for plants that
need shade, however, they provide less light

and heat than southern and western expo-
sures. Planting on berms and slopes will
greatly affect drainage and influence plant
growth. Keep that in mind when selecting
and placing plants.

B. Garden Location

A garden positioned higher than the sur-
rounding area usually will not experience
the same cold temperature because cold air,
being heavier than warm air, flows down to
low lying areas. Solid fences, walls, and
thickly planted hedges will, however, im-
pede the flow of cold air to cause a frost
pocket. Gardens surrounded by these barri-
ers may suffer more cold damage than those
areas that allow free drainage of cool air.

III. Plant Site Preparation

When preparing the planting area, add finished
compost (1 to 2 inches) to the entire area if the
soil is low in organic matter, very sandy, or heavy
clay. Mix it into the top 9 to 12 inches of soil be-
fore planting. Adding organic matter each year
around plants, even on the soil surface, will im-
prove soil structure as well as water and air
movement in the soil. Use of raised beds, mound-
ing, and berms will also improve water and air
movement if soils are heavy clay. In areas with
high water tables, tile drains can be installed.

IV. Planting Procedures for Seeds

and Transplants
A. Seeds

Planting depth is dependent on seed size.
Follow the recommendations on the seed
packet.

B. Bareroot Plants

This kind of plant has had the soil washed
or shaken from its roots after digging.
1. Nearly all bareroot plants are dormant
deciduous trees or shrubs. Most mail
order plants are barerooted. Many tap
rooted plants, such as nut trees and some
fruit and shade trees, are barerooted be-
cause they are not amenable to balling
and burlapping.

2. Plants available in nurseries in early
spring with roots wrapped in damp
sphagnum moss and packaged in card-
board or plastic containers are also
barerooted plants. These need special at-
tention because their roots are tightly
bunched in unnatural positions in order to
force them into the package.
a. Letting the roots dry out is the single
greatest reason for failure with bare-
root plants. Keep roots in the shade or
wrapped in plastic or wet paper until
planting time. Heeling a plant into the
soil is a good way to hold it tempo-
rarily.

b. Discard the sphagnum packing and be
sure to spread the roots out into a natu-
ral cone position when planting.

3. Bareroot plants are planted while they are

dormant and are well suited to fall or
early spring planting.

C. Balled and Burlapped (B and B) Plants

1. These plants are likely to have grown in

nursery rows for some time and have
been root pruned so that the root system
within the ball is compact. B and B plants
often reestablish themselves rapidly.
2. B and B method is primarily used for

plants that never lose their foliage (ever-
greens). Examples of B and B plants are
broadleaf evergreens such as rhododen-
drons or azaleas, and conifers of all
types.

3. Many deciduous trees and shrubs, which
have branching root systems that are eas-
ily contained in a soil ball, are also B and
B plants.

4. B and B plants are planted almost any-

time that the ground can be worked.

a. Pay special attention to B and B mate-
rial planted in the summer. It must be
adequately watered to ensure the soil
ball does not dry out.

b. When planting B and B stock, place
the plant in the hole with the burlap
intact. See Chapter 16, page 16-4, for
detailed planting instructions.

D. Container Grown Plants

1. These plants are usually grown in the

container in which they are sold and are
popular in the nursery trade.

2. Container grown plants can be planted
anywhere B and B plants are planted.
However, because of their appearance,
gardeners are often misled into thinking
that these plants need little care. Contain-
er grown plants need the same careful
planting and maintenance as other plants.
Proper watering is critical.

3. Container grown plants are removed

from the container before planting. See
Chapter 16, page 16-4, for more detailed
planting instructions.

V. Watering Considerations

A. Variables That Affect Plant Water

Requirements
Slope, exposure, temperature, humidity,
light intensity, wind, ground cover, mulch,
organic matter level, and individual plant
requirements are variables that affect water
requirements of plants. See Chapter 16,
pages 16-2 and 16-3, for more water infor-
mation on landscape plants. Irrigating the
home vegetable garden is covered in Chap-
ter 19, pages 19-12 and 19-13.
1. Inadequate watering causes roots to des-
iccate and die. The top growth will begin
to show abnormal symptoms such as
wilting or dry leaf margins.

2. To determine if overwatering or under-

watering is the problem, take a shovel or
trowel and dig down 8 to 10 inches. An
overly wet condition can be determined
by a simple moisture hand test. An overly
dry condition is self-evident.

3. A soil probe can also be used and will do

the job more quickly and effectively. A
soil probe can be made from a 1-inch

Chapter 6, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

6 - 4

Approximate length 3 feet

14 inches

1 inch

Soil probe

diameter hollow metal tube, diagonally
cut at the “drill” end for easy insertion.
“Handles” at the opposite end can be
made by drilling a hole for or welding on
a smaller diameter solid metal rod that
runs perpendicular through the hollow
tube to form a “T.”
a. Push the probe into the area to be

tested to a depth of at least 12 inches.
Remove the probe. A soil profile will
be trapped inside the probe.

b. In sampling an area, often five to 20
soil profile samples are taken. These
are mixed together in a plastic bucket.
From that mixture a portion of soil is
placed in a plastic bag and sent to a
laboratory for analysis (ask your
county extension educator for the near-
est location).
B. Water Penetration

When plants are watered, the entire root
zone should be filled. For trees this may be
two to three times the diameter of the crown
for width and 2 feet down for depth. Allow
the soil to partially dry before your next irri-
gation.
1. How much drying is allowed will depend

on the plant species and its size. If the
soil dries too deeply in vegetable and
flower gardens, wilting will occur.

2. Gardeners must learn how long it takes

the root zones of the various garden
plants to be completely moistened.

3. Each plant is different. Experimentation

is the key.

C. Soil Type

Soil type or texture is a major factor deter-
mining how much water a soil can hold and
how quickly a soil can be irrigated. For ex-
ample, 1 inch of water applied to a sandy
soil will penetrate 12 inches, while 1 inch of
water applied to good loam will penetrate 6
to 10 inches, and 1 inch of water applied to
clay soil will penetrate only 4 to 5 inches.

D. Watering Interval

Sandy soils will allow water to penetrate
more quickly than will heavy, dense clay
soils. Wetting the entire root zone of a plant
growing in a heavy soil may take hours.
1. Sandy loam soil will accept from 1/2 to 3

inches of water per hour.

2. A clay loam may absorb only 1/10 to 3/5

of an inch of water per hour.

E. Water Retention

Although light sandy soils will allow quick
and deep penetration of water, they dry out
more rapidly. Heavy clay soils are more dif-
ficult to penetrate with water, but once wet,
they dry out much more slowly than sandy
soils.
1. You will need to irrigate heavy clay soils

far less often than light sandy soils. A
general rule is to deep water clay soils to
a 12-inch depth once a week and sandy
soils to a 12-inch depth once every 2 to 3
days.

2. Soils that receive ample amounts of or-
ganic matter (OM) annually may have
different water retention levels. For ex-
ample, amended clay soils may accept
water more quickly than the surrounding
native soil, while amended sandy soils
will hold water longer than sandy soils
that have not been amended.

F. Compaction and Thatch

Soils that are compacted or covered with a
deep thatch accumulation (in turf) will
cause water to run off and be wasted.
1. For compacted areas, such as walkways
across the yard and under the canopy of
trees, the best treatment is to aerate the
soil by removing plugs (core aeration)
followed by topdressing with a 1/4-inch
layer of humus or good top soil.

2. For trees and shrubs, mulching around

them will help reduce future compaction
by cushioning foot traffic and water drop-
lets.

3. With compacted landscape soils, adding

1 inch of humus over the surface, or
working it carefully into the top 2 or 3
inches of soil, will help restructure the

Chapter 6, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

6 - 5

is kept sufficiently moist to encourage
roots to grow out into the surrounding
soil. Roots grow where there’s moisture
and, unless the media in the rootball and
planting hole are moist, the roots may
never grow out of the original nursery
soil. In such a situation, plants may girdle
themselves and die.

2. In heavy clay soils, it may be beneficial

to slightly amend (but only 25 percent of)
the backfill soil for improved aeration
and water penetration. Keep in mind that
amending the soil in a planting hole too
much will encourage an interface prob-
lem.

3. In sandy soils, amending 25 percent of

the backfill will improve nutrient and wa-
ter retention.

4. Loamy soil types should not be amended.

VI. Irrigation Method

The irrigation method used to supply supple-
mental water to plants will depend upon the
water sources available. The method you select
should be based on the least cost and labor re-
quired. Irrigation systems commonly used are
flood, sprinkler, trickle, and drip.

VII. Landscape Water Requirements

A. Plant Water Needs

Plant roots grow in soils that contain suffi-
cient moisture. If water is consistently sup-
plied to only the top 2 to 3 inches of soil,
that is where the majority of roots will
grow.

Note: To determine when a sprinkler has put
out 1 to 2 inches of water (an average
amount to use per week, if it doesn’t
rain), simply place several same-sized
soup cans at regular intervals starting
near the sprinkler head and extending
out to the edge of the sprinkler pattern.
Take an average of the total amount col-
lected (divide the total amount of water
collected by the number of cans set out)
within the time the sprinkler was on.
This will help you decide watering pro-
cedures in the future.

Bulb planters

surface layers and allow more efficient
water penetration. Using a bulb planter
(see artwork on next page) to add humus
between plants is also helpful.

4. Compacted vegetable garden soil may
need 2 to 4 inches of raw OM incorpo-
rated each year in the fall to make a dif-
ference. If humus is used, only 1 or 2
inches is needed.

5. In thatchy areas of the lawn, using a

power rake or dethatcher then a wetting
agent to soak through dry organic layers
of thatch will allow better water penetra-
tion. A thin thatch layer (1/4 to 1/2 inch)
is beneficial, but if the thatch layer is
thicker than one half inch, consider
dethatching. For more information on
lawns, see Chapter 14.

G. Interfaces

Interfaces are areas where one soil type
stops and another begins. This can prevent
water from moving laterally through the
soil. Interfaces occur where the soil is al-
tered, for example,  amended backfill that is
added to the transplant hole changes the
original soil. The new medium in the trans-
plant hole will be different from the rootball
soil and the surrounding soil. All three of
these soils will pick up and hold water dif-
ferently, which can affect root development
and plant growth.
1. For newly planted shrubs and trees, make
sure that the soil surrounding the rootball

Chapter 6, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

6 - 6

B. Deep Watering

Wetting the soil 12 to 18 inches down will
enable the roots of plants to grow further
down. There they can withstand temperature
extremes and tap into deeper water and nu-
trient reserves. During periods of drought,
deep-rooted plants are less likely to be dam-
aged or killed.

C. Lawns

See Chapter 14, “Turfgrass Establishment
and Management,” pages 14-13 and 14-14.

D. Shrubs and Trees

Shrubs and trees should be irrigated so that
the entire area under the dripline (the area
on the ground that starts at the trunk and ex-
tends to the end of the branch tips) and be-
yond is watered thoroughly. Tree root sys-
tems can extend out two to three times the
size of their crowns!
1. Although the dripline is often referred to,
much of the water and nutrient uptake of
shrubs and trees is accomplished by roots
outside the dripline. Keep this in mind
when applying water and fertilizer.

2. Watering woody plants by creating a ba-

sin around the trunk is only good for
newly planted stock. As root systems ex-
pand the watered area must also expand.
Watering next to the trunk of large trees
does very little for the extensive root sys-
tem at the dripline and beyond.

3. Shrubs and trees near house foundations,

or in southern and western exposures,
need special attention. Because of the
sun’s intensity and the reflected heat
from walls in these locations, these plants
are subject to greater water stress and
may need more frequent watering during
hot, sunny weather.

E. Vegetables

See Chapter 19, “Vegetable Culture,” pages
19-12 and 19-13. Use mulches whenever
possible to reduce surface evaporation and
weed competition.

F. Containers

Outdoor containerized plants will have to be
watered several times a day during warm,
sunny periods.

1. Water when the top 1/2 inch of soil is

dry. Water long enough to allow moisture
to flow out through the drainage holes.
Remove excess water in the drainage dish
to reduce the amount of accumulated fer-
tilizer salts in the soil.

2. Plants in containers become potbound
quickly and dry out rapidly. If the soil
becomes too dry, it may be necessary to
soak the entire container in a tub of water
until it is thoroughly wet again.

3. Repot containerized plants when the

roots become crowded. Use a thick wood
or clay container for better root insula-
tion. Plastic and metal containers are not
good at insulating root systems.

4. Timed drip irrigation may be effective in
keeping outdoor containers consistently
moist.

I. Introduction

B. Decomposers

Composting is the biological decomposition of
organic matter. We practice it to recycle un-
wanted organic materials, such as yard trim-
mings and food scraps, and to produce com-
post, a valuable soil amendment. Finished
compost takes on many of the characteristics
of humus, the organic fraction of soil. Like hu-
mus, compost improves garden soils and aids
in plant growth.

While composting occurs naturally, human inter-

vention can accelerate it. The quality of the
compost and the production speed depend
upon several factors that human composters
can manipulate.

II. The Composting Process

A. Process Basics

Composting is an aerobic, or oxygen-requir-
ing, process. The microorganisms and other
biological decomposers responsible for
composting consume oxygen along with the
organic materials and produce primarily com-
post, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and heat
(Fig. 1). The heat that is produced raises the
temperature of the composting materials.

The oxygen consumed during the process

must continually be replaced by air movement
through the materials. Because the penetration
of air may be inadequate or inconsistent, some
decomposition inevitably occurs under anaero-
bic conditions (without oxygen). Anaerobic
decomposition is slower than aerobic decom-
position, produces little heat, and creates odor-
ous byproducts. The challenge for the
composter is to minimize anaerobic decompo-
sition by creating and maintaining conditions
that favor the desired decomposers.

Decomposers are the microorganisms and in-
vertebrates that accomplish composting. Natu-
rally occurring microorganisms, such as bacte-
ria, fungi, and actinomycetes, account for most
of the decomposition, as well as the rise in
temperature that occurs in the compost pro-
cess. Invertebrate animals, such as mites, milli-
pedes, insects, sow bugs, earthworms, and
snails, produce much of the physical decay
where the temperature is relatively cool (below
90°F).
Different decomposers prefer different organic
materials and environmental conditions. A di-
verse microbial population represents a healthy
compost pile. If the environment becomes un-
suitable for a particular decomposer, that or-
ganism will become dormant, die, or move to a
more hospitable area of the pile. Changing
conditions during the composting process lead
to an ever-changing ecosystem of decomposer
organisms.
1. Microorganisms: food and water.

a. Bacteria are the workhorses of the com-

post pile. They are the most numerous
and active decomposers. Bacteria gener-
ally prefer moist conditions and attack
the easily decomposed materials such as
green vegetation, food scraps, and ma-
nure.

b. Actinomycetes (a branching type of bac-
teria) and fungi (yeast and molds) attack
the more resistant materials that bacteria
use less efficiently. Fungi are particularly
good at decomposing woody materials.
These groups of organism are also more
tolerant of dry conditions than bacteria.
They become more important near the

Chapter 7, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

end of the process when the resistant or-
ganic compounds remain (e.g., cellulose
and lignin compounds). The filaments,
molds, and spores formed by fungi and
actinomycetes are often visible in the
later stages of composting.

2. Aerobic vs. anaerobic microorganisms.
a. Aerobic organisms provide the most
rapid and effective composting. They
thrive at oxygen levels greater than 5
percent (fresh air is approximately 21
percent oxygen).

b. Anaerobic bacteria prevail when oxy-

gen is scarce. Anaerobic conditions are
undesirable in a compost pile because
the decomposition products are often
odorous. For example, a common
product of anaerobic decomposition is
hydrogen sulfide that smells like rotten
eggs. Other odorous anaerobic prod-
ucts, some with aptly descriptive
names like “putrescine” or “cadaver-
ine,” are formed from organic nitrogen
compounds.

3. Microorganisms and temperature—Mi-
croorganisms are grouped according to
the temperatures in which they thrive.
a. Psychrophilic organisms work in the
lowest temperature range and have an
optimum temperature of about 55°F.
Mesophilic organisms thrive at tem-
peratures between 70° and 100°F.
Thermophilic organisms are heat-lov-
ing and operate in a range between
113° and 155°F. If the temperature
rises above 140°F, even the thermo-
philic microorganisms begin to suffer
and decomposition slows.

b. Aerobic microorganisms are the most
important initiators of decomposition
and temperature rise within the com-
post pile. The initial temperature of the
compost pile is usually near ambient
air temperature. Psychrophilic bacteria
typically begin the decomposition.
Their activity generates a small
amount of heat that increases pile tem-
perature. This change in environment

allows mesophilic organisms to domi-
nate. In turn, the more rapid decompo-
sition by mesophilic bacteria further
increases the pile temperature and cre-
ates an environment for the thermo-
philes to thrive. Later, as the compost
matures, temperature decreases, meso-
philic bacteria again dominate, and fi-
nally psychrophiles and invertebrates
return.

c. Although microorganisms are the pri-
mary decomposers in a compost pile,
larger organisms also play a significant
and beneficial role. Callemacroorgan-
isms, invertebrates, or secondary de-
composers, these organisms include
nematodes, flat worms, earthworms,
snails, slugs, mites, springtails, beetles,
ants, fly larvae, grubs, centipedes, mil-
lipedes, and sow bugs. Macroorgan-
isms feed on plant tissue, partially de-
composed organic matter, or other or-
ganisms. In the process, they break
particles into smaller pieces, mix and
transport nutrients, convert materials
into forms that microorganisms can
digest, and add their own byproducts
and cell tissue to the compost.
Macroorganisms are not tolerate of
thermophilic temperatures. As tem-
peratures rise above 90°F, they will
die, become dormant, or escape to the
soil or cooler sections of the pile. They
will return after the temperature falls
to tolerable levels.

C. Factors Affecting the Composting Process
1. Aeration—Rapid aerobic decomposition

can only occur in the presence of suffi-
cient oxygen. Aeration replaces the oxy-
gen-deficient air fresh oxygen-rich air
inside the compost pile. It also removes
heat, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and
other gaseous products of the composting
process. Aeration occurs naturally by dif-
fusion, wind, and when warm air (heated
by the compost process) rises through the
pile and draws in cool, fresh air from the
surroundings.
a. Porosity: The compost pile’s porosity
and moisture content affect air move-
ment through the pile. Porosity is a

measure of the spaces between par-
ticles within the compost pile. These
spaces provide a path for air circula-
tion. Porosity suffers as the compost-
ing material becomes wetter because
the material in the pile becomes
heavier and more compacted. Adding
coarse materials, such as leaves, straw,
or cornstalks, increases the pile’s po-
rosity, resists compaction, and pro-
motes good aeration.

b. Turning: As composting proceeds and
the materials decompose, they shrink
in size and begin to settle. Settling re-
duces the pile’s air spaces and restricts
aeration. Regular mixing of the pile,
referred to as turning, reverses the ef-
fects of settling.
Although turning recharges the pile
with fresh air, its main effect is to fluff
up the material. This increases the
pile’s porosity and improves natural
air circulation. Turning also blends the
composting materials and breaks apart
clumps of materials. Because of these
benefits, turning speeds the compost-
ing process.

2. Moisture—Microorganisms need mois-

ture. Water serves as a medium for
chemical reactions and provides a means
for movement of nutrients and microor-
ganisms. On the other hand, too much
water makes the materials soggy and
heavy, hindering aeration as explained
above.
a. Generally, a moisture content in the

range of 40 to 60 percent provides ad-
equate moisture without limiting aera-
tion. In practice, the acceptable level
of moisture depends on the materials
that you are composting. Coarse or
fluffy materials such as leaves or straw
can be wetter than 60 percent moisture
content and still aerate well. Absorbent
materials may need to be well above
40 percent moisture to compost rapidly.

b. The “squeeze” test is an easy way to
gauge the moisture level of compost-
ing materials. The material should feel
damp to the touch, but not dripping
wet. Water should drip from the mate-

rial only when you squeeze it tightly in
your hand. If you can’t squeeze water
out, the pile is too dry (see Section IV,
Subsection H on “Moisture Manage-
ment,” page 7-12).

3. Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (browns and

greens)—Microbial decomposers obtain
many nutrients from the composting ma-
terials but carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
are the nutrients that affect the process
the most. Microorganisms primarily use
carbon compounds as an energy source
and ingest nitrogen for protein.
a. Because they require a balance of both

nutrients, the proportion of carbon to
nitrogen is important when combining
organic materials to make compost.
The ideal ratio (C:N) of these two ele-
ments is about 30 parts carbon to 1
part nitrogen by weight. At this 30:1
ratio, microorganisms decompose or-
ganic material quickly. When the C:N
ratio is higher, the shortage of nitrogen
slows decomposition. When the C:N
ratio is too low, excess nitrogen is lost
to the atmosphere in the form of am-
monia gas. In concentrated amounts,
this can lead to odor problems. Gener-
ally, C:N ratios within the range of
20:1 to 50:1 yield good compost in a
reasonable time without odor problems.
b. Most composting materials, by them-
selves, do not contain C and N in the
right ratio (Table 1). Still, you can

achieve the desired C:N ratio by mix-
ing several materials together in appro-
priate proportions. We refer to the ma-
terials used and their proportions as a
“recipe.”

Note: In a backyard or home composting

situation, it is impractical for you to be
precise when developing recipes. You
can roughly predict the C:N ratios of
mixtures from estimated C:N ratios of
the ingredients as in Table 1. An easier
approach is to develop recipes by
thinking of carbon sources as
“browns” and nitrogen sources as
“greens” and then combining brown
and green materials in rough propor-
tions. For example, a mix of one to
three volumes of browns (dry leaves)
to one volume of greens (fresh grass
clippings) often produces a C:N ratio
in the 30:1 to 50:1 range.

4. Surface area and particle size—Most mi-
crobial activity occurs along particle sur-
faces, where oxygen is available from the
adjacent air spaces. Because surface area
increases as particle size decreases, chop-
ping, shredding, or cutting material into
smaller pieces usually speeds decomposi-
tion. There is a limit to this benefit.
Smaller particles also decrease the pore
size and structure and restricts aeration.
Therefore, some compromise is neces-
sary. Usually a mixture of particles in the
range of 1/8 inch to 2 inches (in the larg-
est dimension) gives good results.

5. Degradability—The nature of the materi-
als largely determines the speed at which
composting occurs. Not all organic mate-
rials decompose at the same rate.
a. Overall, microorganisms easily digest
materials made from sugars, starches,
proteins, and fats such as food scraps,
manure, and green vegetation. Typi-
cally, nitrogen-rich materials or
“greens” are the first to decompose in
the composting process.

b. Materials such as straw and plant

stems contain a large amount of cellu-
lose that takes longer to decompose.

Chapter 7, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

7 - 5

Woody materials contain a biologi-
cally resistant compound called lignin.
Raw wood products, including saw-
dust, are particularly difficult to de-
compose biologically and pass through
the composting process with little
change. Paper, a wood derivative, de-
composes relatively fast because of the
processing it receives in the papermak-
ing process. You can improve the
degradability of a biologically-resis-
tant material by reducing its particle
size and ensuring that adequate
amounts of nitrogen and water are
available.

6. Temperature—Heat, generated by micro-

organisms, raises the temperature of the
compost pile. Depending on the pile size,
moisture content, and the material that
you are composting, pile temperatures
will rise temporarily to 100° to 120°F and
may even surpass 160°F. Temperatures
between 90° and 140°F promote rapid
composting. Microbial activity decreases
as the temperatures reach 140°F or
higher. Many of the organisms die when
temperatures exceed 160°F.
a. Because microbial activity and the
heat generated are related directly,
temperature is a useful guide in under-
standing how well composting is pro-
gressing. Rising temperatures reflect
increased microbial activity. Warm,
steady temperatures indicate steady
activity. Falling temperatures suggest
that the compost microbial activity is
decreasing, either because the compost
is maturing or because a problem, such
as lack of oxygen or moisture, exists.

You can easily measure temperatures
in your home compost pile with a dial
thermometer with a 12-inch stem
(available from garden stores and cata-
logs). You also can use the clues in
Table 2 to judge the temperature level.

b. Home composting piles tend to be

small and are frequently short of nitro-
gen. Therefore, if high temperatures
(above 120°F) are reached at all, they
are usually sustained for only short pe-
riods of time. Piles typically get hot
soon after adding a large load of green
material, such as grass clippings, and
then gradually cool. High temperatures
have the advantage of killing patho-
genic organisms and weed seeds.
Moderate temperature also result in
effective composting, however. It is
not important to achieve high tempera-
tures if the materials being composted
are not diseased and do not contain
many seeds.

7. Time—Depending on the composting

method, materials, and conditions, it can
take several weeks to several years to
produce finished compost. Methods that
involve little or no turning usually require
more than a year to produce mature com-
post. With regular turning, adequate
moisture, and a good mixture of carbon
(brown) and nitrogen (green) materials,
compost is ready for use in 3 to 4 months.
With daily turnings and highly degrad-
able material, you can reduce the
composting time to less than a month.
Frequent turning is of little benefit if you
are using slow decomposing materials or
if the C:N ratio is high (too many

browns). These materials need
time, more than oxygen, to de-
compose.
Because an immature compost
can cause damage to plants, it
is best to be conservative in
judging when composting is
finished (see Section IV, Sub-
section K, “Judging When
Composting Is Finished,” page
7-12).

III. Composting Methods

The container and the manner and frequency
of turning characterize backyard composting
methods. Common backyard methods include
piles, bins, ventilated containers, and rotating
barrels
A. Piles

1. A freestanding pile or heap is the sim-
plest form of composting, and it works
very well. You can add materials to the
pile as they become available or stockpile
until you have sufficient materials to
make a good sized heap. In either case, it
is helpful to have two or three piles—one
for fresh material, another in the active
composting stage, and possibly a third for
maturing compost. To generate enough
heat to raise the pile temperature, an ac-
tively composting pile should be 3 to 5
feet wide and at least 3 feet high. Larger
piles retain heat better, but as piles grow
in height they become more difficult to
aerate.

2. You can turn piles regularly or not at all.
A pitch fork is the typical turning device,
although you can use other tools to
loosen the pile. If the pile receives little
or no turning, then add highly degradable
materials only in moderation.
B. Bins and Ventilated Containers

Bins are managed in almost the same man-
ner as piles. Compared to piles, bins more
neatly contain the composting materials and
allow you to stack them higher. Certain
types of bins also discourage animal pests
and keep rain away from the composting
materials. See pages 7-16,17,18 for the wide
variety of bins that you can use. They differ
in cost, construction materials, ventilation,
and ease of turning. Some bins are expen-
sive or require effort to build while others
need little assembly and may even be free.
Backyard composting bins are sometimes
grouped into two basic categories: (1) hold-
ing units that let the materials decompose
undisturbed, and (2) turning units that allow
regular turning of the composting material.
The distinction between holding and turning
bins easily becomes blurred. Some struc-
tures typically used for turning often can

serve as holding units and holding bins can
be turned.
1. Holding bins—Generally made of light
materials, holding bins are easy to take
apart and move. Once the bin is apart,
you can turn or harvest the finished
compost. Common bin materials in-
clude circles of wire fencing or hard-
ware cloth, old wooden pallets tied to-
gether, snow fencing, or wire mesh
framed in wood. You can make sta-
tionary bins with wooden slats or by
stacking together landscape timbers,
concrete blocks, or rocks. In all cases,
the bin should allow air flow through
the sides and back. Aeration aids will
improve air circulation. Examples in-
clude pallets, placing aeration mats or
branches under piles and branches, or in-
serting perforated pipes or wire tubes ver-
tically into the composting materials.
Several manufactured holding bins are
available. Some are intended to compost
food scraps. Most of these are closed con-
tainers with air vents in the sides. Others
have vents only at the bottom and top of
the bin. These bins are not designed to
maintain aerobic conditions completely.
They control odors by enclosing the ma-
terials—and the odor—inside the con-
tainer. Yard trimmings and food scraps
are added at the top, and compost is re-
moved from the bottom.

2. Turning bins—Turning units contain

the composting materials while provid-
ing easy access for turning. Materials
are either turned in place or shifted
back and forth between adjacent bins.
Turning bins are similar to the stationary
holding bins described above, but with
features such as an open side, removable
walls, and multiple bins. Turning units
with a series of three bins are popular.
Similar to the three-pile system, one bin
contains fresh material, the second ac-
tively composted material, and the third
holds maturing compost.

C. Barrels and Tumblers

Rotating barrels or drums turn the materials
inside as they spin like a clothes dryer (via a

Chapter 7, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

7 - 7

hand crank) or tumble end-over-end. There
are many manufactured models, although
you can make rotating barrels yourself. One
commercial model uses a solar-powered
electric motor to continuously rotate the
drum. Some drums and multisided tumblers
are designed to be rolled along the ground.
All of these composting units include some
means of aeration plus loading and unload-
ing features. Because you must load the bar-
rels in batches, it is necessary to store fresh
materials. As an alternative, you can use
two drums—while one drum is composting,
the other is being loaded with fresh mate-
rial. Given a large enough batch of material,
rotating barrels should generate high tem-
peratures.
The idea behind rotating barrels is to make
turning effortless. Therefore, the material
will be turned more often and decompose
faster. Several manufactur-
ers claim their product can
produce finished compost 2
weeks (although 1 month is
a more realistic goal). In
order to achieve quick
composting, other factors
including easily degraded
and shredded materials,
proper moisture, and C:N
ratios must accompany the
benefits of frequent turning.

IV. Making and Managing a

Compost Pile
Composting is a natural and
flexible process. It will take
place under a wide range of
conditions and methods regard-
less of either the efforts or ne-
glect of human composters.
Nevertheless, good manage-
ment helps the process along
and minimizes nuisances. Man-
agement determines how soon
the compost is produced. For
example, turning a compost
pile weekly can yield compost
in 1 to 2 months, with adequate
moisture content and a good
combination of materials.

Chapter 7, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

7 - 8

Without turning, composting takes 6 months to
2 years. You can make excellent-quality com-
post either way.
A. Materials

Almost all natural organic materials will de-
compose, but not everything belongs in the
backyard compost pile as you can see in
Table 3. Generally, you can compost garden
vegetation, landscape trimmings, and most
plant-derived food scraps without concern.
1. It is prudent to avoid composting plants
harboring disease, or treated with persis-
tent herbicides, or carrying many seeds
and insects. Also, it is a good idea to
keep out certain noxious weeds, includ-
ing morning glories (bindweed), and
grasses (such as quackgrass) with rhizo-
matous root systems. Backyard compost
piles do not reliably produce the high
temperatures necessary to thoroughly kill

rhizomes, weed seeds, and plant diseases.
For the same reason, do not add cat and
dog manure, which may contain patho-
gens, to backyard piles. Avoid adding
fatty and oily foods because they tend to
attract animal pests (rodents, skunks,
dogs, and cats). Also, oily foods are
quick to decompose and may generate
odors.

2. Another group of materials to be cautious

about are those that may contain natural
or manufactured compounds that are
toxic to either plants or the composting
decomposers. Examples include grass
and vegetation containing persistent her-
bicides, leaves from black walnut trees,
and cedar wood. Even if these materials
decompose, the compost might retain
some of the toxins. If you want to com-
post these materials, segregate them from
the other materials. Also, use the compost
only where the toxins will not have a
negative effect. For example, use
composted walnut leaves as mulch for
walnut trees or use herbicide-treated
grass compost as lawn top-dressing.

3. The degradability of materials is also a

consideration. Highly degradable materi-
als such as grass clippings, food scraps,
and manure, require more turning and at-
tention (see odor control). Slowly degrad-
able materials need shredding and time
for composting, even with regular turn-
ing. Chop or shred before composting
branches, plant stems, and other thick or
large particles of material. The less de-
gradable a material is, the more important
shredding becomes. Also, chop whole
pieces of fruit and vegetables to break the
protective barrier of the skin or peel.

B. Additives

Some composters add lime, wood ash, inor-
ganic fertilizers, and organic nutrient
sources into compost piles to enhance the
compost or the composting process. These
additives are not necessary to composting.
Depending on the compost pile conditions,
they may speed the process or provide no
benefit at all.

1. Lime—Rarely helpful to the composting
process, lime is added sometimes to neu-
tralize acidic materials and organic acids
formed during composting. The effect of
these acidic conditions, however, is sel-
dom damaging. Composting decompos-
ers can work at a relatively low ph
(acidic) and further decomposition tends
to push the pH toward neutral. Lime also
encourages ammonia loss, especially if
the C:N ratio is low (a lot of greens).
2. Wood ash—Although wood ash adds

mineral nutrients to the compost, it has
little effect on the composting process.
Like lime, wood ash increases pH and
encourages ammonia loss. Usually, the
composting process is not adversely af-
fected by the amount of wood ash that a
household wood stove generates.

3. Inorganic fertilizers—Because backyard
composting piles usually lack nitrogen,
inorganic fertilizers tend to speed the
composting process. The compost is not
greatly affected. Inorganic fertilizers
should be dissolved in water and mixed
into the compost pile. You can only ap-
proximate the correct amount of fertilizer
to add. For example, a pile of dry leaves
generally requires about 2.4 ounces of
nitrogen per bushel (about 4 cubic feet).
Table 4 lists the corresponding amount of
various types of fertilizers. Use less fer-
tilizer as you add more greens to the pile.
If you add too much fertilizer, nitrogen
will be lost to the atmosphere as ammo-
nia or leached from the pile into the
ground. In part, this occurs because the

nitrogen from fertilizer is available to the
decomposers more quickly than the car-
bon from the organic materials.

4. Organic nutrient sources—Concentrated
organic sources of nitrogen such as ma-
nures, dried blood, fish meal, fish emul-
sion, and cottonseed meal are better
sources of nitrogen. Compared to inor-
ganic fertilizers, these sources release ni-
trogen that more closely matches the
availability of organic carbon.

C. Inoculants

Soil, vegetation, food scraps, compost, and
the environment contain the desired organ-
isms in ample quantities to start the com-
posting process. Some composters claim to
see faster composting after using inoculants.
Others have found no difference. In any
case, inoculants, activators, or compost
starters are not necessary.

D. Location

The pile should not be in contact with trees,
wooden fences, and buildings because the
compost will accelerate wood decay and
metal corrosion. Also, spontaneous combus-
tion (self-ignited fire) within a backyard
composting pile is a remote yet possible
danger.
1. Shelter—A sheltered location is an asset

because wind both cools and dries the
pile. Direct sunlight can be undesirable.
Although it provides warmth in the win-
ter, sunlight dries the pile in the summer.
2. Water—The location should provide ac-

cess to water as you will need to water
piles frequently during the summer. You
are more likely to keep piles moist if the
water source is convenient—for example,
within reach of a garden hose. Avoid
poorly drained locations that gather
standing water because materials will be-
come waterlogged.

3. Space—Finally, the location should pro-
vide enough space to turn the pile and to
stockpile raw materials and finished com-
post, if necessary.

E. Volume

A pile or bin should be large enough to gen-
erate and hold in heat, yet small enough to
allow air to reach its center. As a general

rule, the minimum pile or bin dimensions
should be 3 by 3 feet at the base and 3 feet
high. Piles and bins that are larger than 5
feet high or 5 feet wide are difficult to aer-
ate and require more turning.
Pile volume is most important during the
cold season. Therefore, start new piles in the
summer and gradually enlarge them as win-
ter approaches.

F. Building Composting Piles

You can construct compost piles gradually
from the ground up by adding material as
they become available, and in batches by
stockpiling materials until you have accu-
mulated a certain amount. This is rarely an
either/or choice—a pile or bin can grow
both gradually and in batches. Adding fresh
material in large quantities is more likely to
produce high temperatures but it also in-
creases the chance of odors and requires
more turning.
1. Mixing or layering ingredients—The

most important task in constructing a pile
is to mix together the appropriate ingredi-
ents, including water. Blend brown and
green ingredients well for microorgan-
isms to obtain a balance of both carbon
and nitrogen. Some composters add ma-
terials without mixing and rely on subse-
quent turnings to blend the ingredients.
Others add brown and green materials in
successive layers, 3 to 6 inches thick,
with the first and last layers consisting of
coarse brown materials as in Fig. 2. An-
other variation intersperses layers of soil,
fertilizer, or manure among the brown
and green layers. Layering provides an
easy and visual way to proportion materi-
als. The layers, however, make a poor
blend of materials. Turning is necessary
to mingle the brown and green materials
together.

2.  Burying materials—When adding to

piles continuously, bury materials (cer-
tain food scraps) that might attract flies
and pests 6 inches beneath the surface of
open piles and bins. If the pile is not dry
or frozen, the material will partially de-
compose in 1 to 2 weeks. Then you can
turn the pile as desired. When adding
food materials in large quantities, mix

Chapter 7, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

7 - 10

them into the pile, cover them, and then
turn the pile a week or so later. If you are
using enclosed bins and barrels, you do
not need to bury materials.

3. Insulating the pile—Placing a layer of
coarse material at the base of piles and
bins improves aeration and insulates
them from the colder ground. The base
layer also absorbs liquids that may leak
from above. Appropriate materials in-
clude dry leaves, corn stalks, straw, wood
chips, and compost. You also can use
these materials to cover the surface of
piles. A 3- to 6-inch outer layer protects
piles from heat and moisture loss and
helps to contain odors.

G. Turning

Although turning is not essential to back-
yard composting, it performs several benefi-
cial functions. It improves aeration by in-
creasing porosity and charging the pile with
fresh air. It also blends materials, breaks
apart particles, and removes heat, water va-
por, and other gases contained in the pile.
Turning speeds the process and helps in
managing temperature, moisture, and odors.

Fig. 2. Building compost piles by layering.

There are few hard-and-fast rules for turn-
ing composting materials. You can do it on
a regular schedule (weekly), when you add
fresh materials, occasionally at your conve-
nience, or in response to the pile’s condi-
tions. Turn piles according to the following
guidelines.
1. To speed the process and promote high
temperatures—In most cases, the more
often you turn a pile, the faster it com-
posts. Therefore, the pile is more likely to
achieve high temperatures. Turning is ef-
fective with moderately to highly degrad-
able materials. It has limited effect on
slowly degradable materials.

2. To blend materials—Turn piles when

materials are poorly-mixed, when differ-
ent sections of the pile show differences
in consistency, color, moisture, tempera-
ture, or odor.

3. To cool the materials—Turn piles when

temperatures become too high (above
140°F).

4. To aerate materials—Turn piles when

odors begin to develop (see Subsection I
on “Odor Management” on page 7-12) or

Chapter 7, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

7 - 11

when other signs of anaerobic conditions
appear such as an unexpected tempera-
ture drop or compacted, matted, or slimy-
looking materials.

5. To drive off moisture—Turn piles when
the materials become saturated from rain
or with the addition of wet materials.

6. To add moisture—Turn piles when add-
ing water. Otherwise, water is difficult to
distribute throughout the pile.

H. Moisture Management

1. Lack of moisture—The most common
ailment of composting piles in arid cli-
mates is lack of moisture. Without sub-
stantial rain, you must add water to piles
(perhaps weekly) to keep the process go-
ing. The more you turn a pile, the more
water you should add. You can reduce
moisture loss by decreasing the turning
frequency, sheltering piles from wind and
sun, increasing pile size, and using bins
with covers and small ventilation open-
ings.

2. Too much water—A less frequent prob-

lem, you should turn piles that are too
wet to distribute water within the pile and
to encourage evaporation.

3. Moisture test—Although the surface of
the pile appears dry, the materials a few
inches below should look and feel damp.
Use the squeeze test to test for adequate
moisture (see Section II, Subsection C-2
on page 7-4). If the pile needs water, add
it with a trickle hose or sprinkler. Be-
cause water moves slowly through the
mass of composting materials, turn the
compost while adding the water. To con-
serve fresh water, you can routinely add
“used” water from certain household (for
example, water from washing or cooking
vegetables) and garden activities.

I. Odor Management

Most backyard composting materials
present little odor risk. Still, odors can occur
as a result of neglect or the wrong combina-
tion of materials and conditions. The best
way to manage odors is to avoid anaerobic
conditions—keep the pile from becoming
too wet, turn at the first hint of odors, main-
tain a mix with at least as much brown ma-

terial as green, and generally maintain good
pile porosity.
1. Degradable materials—Highly degrad-

able materials such as grass, manure, and
food scraps require particular attention.
Mix the materials thoroughly within the
pile. If you add these materials in large
quantities (more than one-quarter of the
pile volume), then turn the pile regularly.
Unturned piles and holding bins do not
provide the air flow needed to aerobically
decompose large quantities of grass, ma-
nure, and food. If turning is not practical
or if odors are a sensitive problem, it may
be best to avoid composting these materi-
als.

2. Correcting odors—The remedy for an

odorous pile is to supply more oxygen by
turning and by increasing the pile’s po-
rosity (e.g, adding course brown materi-
als). Disturbing the pile will release the
odorous compounds, so the odor may be-
come more intense for a brief period. If a
pile develops strong odors, turning it
might aggravate the nuisance. You can
allow the odorous pile to decompose un-
disturbed and the odors should gradually
dissipate. Do not add water or fresh mate-
rial except for an insulating, odor-absorb-
ing layer of course dry materials on the
surface. Instead, start a new pile. When
the odorous pile becomes tolerable, turn
it and combine it with a new pile.

J. Troubleshooting

The most prevalent problem associated with
backyard composting is slow decomposi-
tion. The first suspected cause is excessive
drying of piles, followed closely by a lack
of nitrogen (not enough fresh green mate-
rial). Poor aeration caused by wet or com-
pacted materials, also can hinder the
composting rate. In this case, odors may ac-
company the problem. Other occasional dif-
ficulties include pests, ammonia-like odors,
and extremely high temperatures. See Table
5 for troubleshooting guidelines.

K. Judging When Composting Is Finished

Composting does not stop at a particular
point. Biological decomposition of the raw
materials and the compost continues almost

Chapter 7, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

7 - 12

indefinitely. The compost becomes usable,
and we consider the process finished when
the decomposition rate slows to the point
that the compost will not create odors nor
adversely affect plants as it continues to de-
compose. Judging when the pile reaches this

point is part of the art of composting. Signs
of mature compost include the following:
1. The expected composting time period has
elapsed since you last added materials to
the pile (see Section II, Subsection C-7
on page 7-6).

a dark brown color, crumbly texture, and
earthy odor.

3. Except for pieces of wood, the compost
shows little evidence of the original yard
trimmings and food scraps added to the
pile.

4. The moist pile remains cool and does not

become warmer after turning.

5. Earthworms and other invertebrates have

inhabited the compost pile.

6. The moist compost does not develop of-

fensive or stale odors when stored in a
closed plastic bag at room temperature
for 2 weeks.

Note: Unfortunately, an unfinished compost
can exhibit some of these traits. There-
fore, be sure several of these signs (the
more, the better) are present before
harvesting the compost. To be safe,
allow the compost to cure in small
piles, about 3 feet high, for a month or
two after you judge the process to be
complete.

V. Using Compost

Use compost as a soil amendment for flower
and vegetable gardens, as a mulch around trees
and shrubs, as a top-dressing for lawns, and as
a component of potting soil. Most compost
will greatly benefit plants, but unfinished com-
post, or compost stored under anaerobic condi-
tions, can harm seedlings or sensitive plants.
Therefore, compost quality is important.
A. Benefits of Compost

1. Improves soil structure—The addition of
compost gives soil a crumbly texture and
increases the soil’s porosity so that plant
roots can more easily penetrate it. When
mixed with a sandy soil, compost adds
moisture and nutrient holding capacity. In
heavy clay soil, compost particles bind
with clay particles to form loose aggre-
gates of soil that drain better and resist
surface crusting and erosion.

2. Buffers pH changes—Most composts

have a near-neutral pH and the ability to
buffer pH changes in the soil.

3. Attracts beneficial soil organisms—Com-
post contains a large and diverse popula-
tion of biological organisms plus organic
matter that attracts earthworms and other
beneficial soil organisms. These traits
contribute to compost’s ability to sup-
press certain soilborne plant disease.

4. Contains trace mineral and plant nutri-

ents—Although compost is not normally
considered a fertilizer, it does contain
trace minerals and small quantities of ma-
jor plant nutrients. The amounts of nutri-
ents depend on the materials composted.
Typically composts made from yard trim-
mings have N concentrations in the range
of 0.5 to 1 percent with P and K ranging
from 0.2 to 0.5 percent. Most of the nitro-
gen and phosphorus are released slowly,
over a period of several years, and in a
pattern that tends to follow the growth
patterns of plants.

B. Application

See Table 6 for general guidelines for ap-
plying compost. Because we use compost
primarily as a soil amendment and not as a
fertilizer, the amount of compost you apply
is not critical. As a rule, use more compost
for poorer soils.
1. As a mulch or top-dressing—You can

apply compost continually as a mulch or
top-dressing for gardens and lawns. The
organic matter and nutrients will gradu-
ally work their way into the soil.

2. As a soil amendment—The best time to

add compost as a soil amendment is
when you prepare the garden bed or lawn
surface before planting. Mix the compost
with soil to at least three times the depth
of the thickness of the compost layer that
you are applying. For example, mix a 1-
inch thick layer of compost into the top 3
to 4 inches of soil; mix a 2-inch layer to a
depth of 6 inches or more. If only a small
amount of compost is available, incorpo-
rate it in seed furrows or mix it with soil
for each annual or perennial plant’s trans-
plant hole following the 1 to 3 compost-
to-soil ratio.

3. As a potting mix—Compost should not
comprise more than one-third of the pot-

Chapter 7, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

7 - 14

ting mix by volume. A popular compost-
based mix is one part peat moss, one part
vermiculite or perlite, and one part com-
post, by volume.

C. Compost Quality

1. Quality depends on use—The required
qualities of a compost depend on its in-
tended use. Compost intended as a top-
dressing for lawns should not have par-
ticles greater than 1/4-inch in size. It is
often necessary to pass a top-dressing
compost through a 1/4-inch screen. Com-
post used as a soil amendment can have
large particles but should not contain a
high percentage of wood. Soil microor-
ganisms compete with the garden plants
for nitrogen as they decompose the re-
maining wood. Gardens that are amended
with wood compost require extra applica-
tions of nitrogen fertilizer. Compost that
looks and feels more like a collection of
small wood chips than soil is better suited
as a mulch than a soil amendment. Make
this judgment after mixing the compost
because small particles tend to settle to
the bottom of undisturbed compost piles
leaving a blanket of wood particles on the
surface.

2. Cure compost before using—Immature

compost and compost produced or stored
under anaerobic conditions may contain
organic acids and alcohols that can harm
plants. These conditions are not common
in backyard composting because piles and
bins tend to be small. Nevertheless, it is
wise to cure mature compost for a month
or more before using it. Store or cure
compost in piles that are relatively
short—3 feet or less. If you have stored
compost in a large pile, spread it on the
ground and allow it to air out for a day or
more (the longer, the better). Maturity
and other quality factors become increas-
ingly important if you use the compost in
a more concentrated manner. For ex-
ample, compost used in potting mixes re-
quires closer scrutiny than compost used
as a soil amendment.

VI. Alternatives to Composting

Composting is not the only way to make good
use of home and garden residues. Worm com-
posting produces a high quality soil amendment
via a different biological process. Grass recy-
cling, soil incorporation, and mulching are
other ways to recycle garden and food residues
without the management demands of composting.

Helpful numbers: A 1-inch deep layer covering 1,000 square feet requires about 3 cubic yards of compost.

Compost weighs about 30 to 40 pounds per cubic foot (about 800 to 1,000 pounds per cubic yard).

Chapter 7, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

A. Grass Recycling

Usually, the compost pile is not the best
destination for grass clippings. The simplest
way to recycle grass clippings is to leave
them on the lawn. This benefits the lawn by
returning nutrients and organic matter to the
soil. This alternative also keeps herbicide-
treated grass out of the compost pile.
“Grasscycling” works best with proper
mowing, fertilizing, and watering practices.

bedding materials include shredded paper,
straw, peat moss, and sawdust. Worms work
best at temperatures between 50° and 70°F
(10°- 20°C), so a basement or other cool
space is a good location for a worm bin. If
the bin freezes or gets too hot, the worms
die. You can harvest and use the compost
when the bin contents become fairly uni-
form, dark, and soil-like in texture. This
usually takes 3 to 6 months.

B. Mulching

D. Soil Incorporation

You can use many organic residues from the
home, garden, or landscape as mulches with
little or no decomposition or preprocessing.
Placing organic mulches on the soil surface
controls weeds, reduces evaporation, lessens
soil erosion, and moderates the soil tem-
perature (keeps it cooler in the summer,
warmer in the winter). Types of yard trim-
mings that you can use as mulches include
grass clippings, leaves, pine needles, and
chipped branches and shrub-trimmings. All
of these materials are suitable for surface
mulching around trees, shrubs, and other
perennial plantings.
Shred leaves with a lawn mower or com-
mercial shredder before using them as a
mulch. Unshredded leaves tend to limit wa-
ter and oxygen movement into the soil. Ap-
ply fresh grass clippings in layers that are
not more than 1 inch thick. Otherwise they
will mat together and limit air movement. A
brief period of composting or drying can
approve the appearance and performance of
several mulching materials including leaves,
grass clippings, and chipped wood.

C. Worm Composting

Worm composting, or vermicomposting,
relies on worms to digest food scraps, paper,
manure, and vegetation. In the process the
worms leave behind castings that form a
high-quality soil amendment called
“vermicompost.” The type of worms used
are red worms, not common soil dwelling
worms.
Worms need a dark, cool, moist, and aero-
bic environment. Therefore, mix food and
“bedding” in shallow layers in closed boxes
or bins to compost. The bedding provides a
light, airy habitat for the worms. Typical

Incorporating food scraps into the soil is an
alternative method for recycling nonfatty
food scraps. Within a month to a year, the
food material will decompose to fertilize
established or future plantings. The time pe-
riod depends on the soil temperature, the
number of organisms in the soil, and the
carbon content of the food. Chop the food
scraps, mix with the soil at the bottom of an
8- to 12-inch deep hole or trench, and cover
completely with clean soil. One system of
soil incorporation rotates garden space
among food trenches, rows of crops, and
walkways as in Fig. 3. Soil incorporation is
difficult, if not impractical, during the win-
ter when ground is frozen or snow covered.

VII. Plans for Constructing Composting Bins

You can make compost bins from readily
available materials. Types of enclosures in-
clude woven-wire fencing (hog wire, chicken
wire, chain link), wood-slat fencing (snow
fence), cement blocks, bricks, or scrap lumber.

Pesticide Management

and Safety

V. J. Parker-Clark

Vickie J. Parker-Clark, District I Extension Director, Coeur d’Alene

I. Three Main Objectives of Pest Control

A. Prevention—Keep a pest from becoming a

problem.

B. Suppression—Reduce pest numbers or dam-

age to an acceptable level.

C. Eradication—Destroy an entire pest popula-

tion.

II. Home, Yard, and Garden Pesticides

Pesticides are used to prevent or reduce dam-
age caused by weeds, diseases, insects, mol-
lusk, or vertebrates. Before you use a pesticide
you should:
A. Identify the pest. Remember various pests

cause similar symptoms; environmental
conditions may cause similar symptoms to
pests. Be a detective. Ask questions to fo-
cus in on the most likely possibilities.
B. Know what other control measures are

available (mechanical, chemical, and bio-
logical).

C. Evaluate the benefits and risks of each

method of control.

D. Choose the methods that are most effective
and that will cause the least harm to people
and to the environment.

E. Use the methods correctly.
F. Observe local, state, and federal regulations

that apply to the situation.

G. Observe precautions, restrictions, and
preharvest intervals noted on the label.

III. Pest Control Methods

A. Many factors influence or affect pest control.

1. Climate.
2. Natural enemies.
3. Topography.

4. Food and water.
5. Water supply.
6. Host resistance.
7. Cultural control by mechanical sanitation

or crop rotation.

8. Chemical control.

B. The term “pesticide” refers to any substance
that is used to control organisms considered
to be pests. The following are some of the
classes of pesticides available to
homeowners:
1. Herbicides—Vegetation control.
2. Insecticides—Insect control.
3. Fungicides—Fungus control.
4. Rodenticides—Rodent control.
5. Acaricides—Mite control.
6. Nematocides—Nematode control.
7. Molluscicides—Snail and slug control.
8. Repellents—Birds, mammals, and insect

control.

9. Desiccants and defoliants—For drying

plant foliage.

10. Disinfectants—Bacteria and fungi con-

trol.

IV. Herbicides

A. Plant life cycle dictates which chemical to

use and when to use it.
1. Annual—1-year life cycle.

a. Winter annuals: Examples are annual

bluegrass, henbit, cheatgrass.

b. Summer annuals: Examples are crab-

grass, pigweed, lambsquarters.

2. Biennials: 2-year life cycle. Example:

mullen.

Chapter 8, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

8 - 2

3. Perennials: Live more than 2 years.

Example: Canada thistle.

B. Types of Herbicides

1. Selective—Specific to certain weeds or

groups of weeds.

2. Nonselective—Kills all vegetation.

C. How Do Herbicides Kill?

1. To be effective an herbicide must reach
and stick to the leaf, penetrate the sur-
face, move to the site of action, and dis-
rupt a vital process.
a. Only 1 percent of the herbicide

reaches the plant surface.

b. Surfactants help an herbicide stick to

the leaf and penetrate the surface.

c. Herbicide movement depends on plant
age and life cycle and on the mobility
of the herbicide.

d. Many herbicides are taken up by the

roots. Example: triazines.

e. Other herbicides are “pre-emergent.”

They kill the emerging seedling. To be
effective, these herbicides must form a
barrier against emerging plants. They
will not work if that barrier is dis-
turbed. They will not hurt plants al-
ready out of the ground.

2. Nutrient/water movement at various

stages of plant growth: In young plants
movement is from the roots upward; in
older plants movement is from the roots
upward and from the leaves downward.
In most mature plants, the movement is
downward.

3. Types of chemicals.

a. Immobile.
b. Xylem mobile.
c. Phloem mobile.
d. Ambimobile (xylem and phloem mobile).

V. Insecticides
A. Classes

1. Organophosphates.
2. Chlorinated hydrocarbons.
3. Carbamates.
4. Botanicals.

B. How do insecticides work?

1. Organophosphates—Affect nervous system.

a. Several of the organophosphates are

systemic. Others are contact.

b. Organophosphates are detoxified rap-

idly in animal tissues and are elimi-
nated rather than being stored in fatty
tissues.

c. Organophosphates persist in the envi-
ronment for relatively short periods in
soils and plants. They are broken down
by the action of plant enzymes, sun-
light, air, moisture, and microorgan-
isms. Some microorganisms (bacteria,
yeast, and fungi) are capable of using
insecticides as an energy source. Infor-
mation on the pesticide label concern-
ing the interval required between ap-
plication and harvest (preharvest inter-
val) is a good indication of the persis-
tence of the material.

2. Chlorinated hydrocarbons—Affect ner-

vous system.
a. Are not broken down rapidly in ani-

mals, so are stored in fatty tissues.

b. Are more persistent in plants and soils
than other groups of pesticides. Some
remain for several years in the soil and
for weeks or months in plants. They
are not readily attacked by enzymes in
plants or microorganisms in the soil.

3. Carbamates—Affect nervous system.

a. Some carbamates are systemics.
b. They are rapidly detoxified and elimi-
nated from the animal’s system. Car-
bamates are not known to accumulate
in fat.

c. Persistence varies in soils and plants,

from a few hours to several weeks.
4. Botanicals—Derived from plants. Ex-

amples: pyrethrum, nicotine (highly toxic),
and rotenone (will kill fish). Use same
handling and safety precautions for these
as you would for any pesticide (see Sec-
tion X, “Pesticide Hazards,” on page 8-5
and Section XI, “Pesticide Law,” on page
8-8).

5. The timing of insecticide application de-
pends on the life cycle stage of the insect
you are trying to control and on what kind
of insecticide you use (systemic or contact).

Chapter 8, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

8 - 3

a. Example: Aphids feeding on a maple
tree. A contact chemical (labeled for
aphids on maple) applied directly to
the aphids will kill any aphids not in
the egg stage.

b. If a systemic is used, the sap in the tree

must be moving to the leaves where
the aphids are feeding in order to kill
them. Example: A systemic would not
kill the adult stage of the leaf skeleton-
izer because the adult does not feed on
the tree. The larval stage does.

Note: You must know the insect life cycle,
the plant life cycle, and the “mode of
action” of the insecticide you are using
to accomplish the most effective and
safe control.

VI. Fungicides

A. Ingredients—Sulfur, captan, triforine,

Daconil 2787.

B. How do they work? By suppression or

smothering?

VII. Pesticide Labels

A. All home, yard, and garden pesticides are
made up of materials from one of two cat-
egories:
1. Active ingredient(s)—This component
consists of the ingredient that will pre-
vent, destroy, repel, or mitigate any pest.
2. Inert ingredients—This component con-

sists of a wide variety of materials that do
not have any biological effect upon the
pest. Some common inert ingredients are
petroleum distillates, emulsifying agents
(detergent-like materials), spreaders,
stickers, clay particles, and even water.
B. Pesticide labels are required by law to pro-
vide the buyer with a list of active ingredi-
ents in a product, and a description of the
percentages of the total that those active in-
gredients make up.

C. Pesticide labels must also state the pest that
the product will control and at what rate the
product should be applied for safe control of
that pest on that plant.

D. Pesticide labels must also give information
about storage, disposal, precautions during

use, symptoms of poisoning, physical haz-
ards, environmental hazards, preharvest in-
tervals, signal words (caution, warning, dan-
ger), and first-aid information. These items
will be discussed later in this chapter.

VIII. Pesticide Categories

All pesticides are classified as either “general
use” or “restricted use.”
A. General Use Pesticides—Considered mini-

mally hazardous when used according to
label directions. All home, yard, and garden
pesticides are general use.

B. Restricted Use Pesticides—Deemed exces-

sively hazardous to the environment or to
the applicator.
1. In Idaho, restricted use pesticides may
only be used by those people who have
been trained and tested by Idaho Depart-
ment of Agriculture personnel. These
people must show a valid applicator’s li-
cense to a chemical dealer before pur-
chase of this category of pesticides.

2. Application of restricted use pesticides

by unlicensed personnel is a violation of
Idaho law.

3. Application of restricted use pesticides in

or around the home is risky business,
given the high toxicity or wide range of
action these chemicals have.

IX. Pesticide Formulations

Pesticide formulations are classified according
to the composition of active and inert ingredi-
ents and the intended use.
A. Pesticide formulations requiring no dilution

in water. These products include:
1. Dusts—Active ingredient combined with
inert materials such as fine clay particles,
talc, etc.

2. Granules—Active ingredient combined
with inert materials such as coarse clay
particles, marble chips, or corn cob grit.
3. Baits—Active ingredient combined with

an attractant such as food or scent.

4. Pest strips—Active ingredient impreg-

nated in a plastic strip that slowly re-
leases pesticide into the atmosphere.

5. Aerosols—Active ingredient combined
with petroleum distillates and propellant
gas in a pressurized can.

Chapter 8, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

8 - 4

6. Ready-to-use liquids—Active ingredient
already diluted with water at the proper
use rate.

B. Pesticides requiring dilution in water. These

products include:
1. Emulsifiable concentrates (EC)—Water-
insoluble active ingredient, usually in pe-
troleum distillate with emulsifiers. When
the distillate is combined with water, it
forms an emulsion. Agitation is needed to
provide an even distribution of the
chemical in water. Emulsifiable concen-
trates are the most dangerous formula-
tions to handle.

2. Wettable powders (WP)—Water-in-

soluble active ingredient sprayed on very
fine solid particles, usually clay or talc.
Add wetters and other adjuvants to aid in
the dispersion and suspension of the par-
ticles in water. The powders need agita-
tion to mix.

3. Water-soluble liquids (WS)—Active in-

gredient is dissolved in a concentrate
containing alcohol or water. The mix
forms a true solution and needs little or
no agitation after mixing thoroughly.

4. Dry flowable (DF)—The active ingredi-

ent is packaged in granular form. The
chemical may or may not be water
soluble. DF’s are as easy to measure as a
liquid and are less likely to contaminate
body, clothing, or work area and to be
inhaled than either WPs or dusts.

X. Pesticide Hazards

The degree of hazard associated with pesticide
use is determined by various factors. The pri-
mary concern, however, must be the hazard to
the health and welfare of humans. The major
factors that determine the hazard of a pesticide
to humans, other mammals, and other animals
include the following:

A. Pesticide Toxicity (The degree to which a

chemical tends to be poisonous)
1. The toxicity of any substance is ex-

pressed in terms of dosage.
a. Hazardous doses vary with such fac-

tors as age, sex, health, and body
weight.

b. Dosages are normally expressed in

milligrams (mg) of toxicant per kilo-
gram (kg) of body weight (1 kg = 2.2
lb; 1 mg = one millionth of a kg).

2. The toxicity of a pesticide is determined
by subjecting test animals (usually mice
or rats) to the pure active ingredient.
a. A common measure of the estimated
toxicity of a pesticide is the dose re-
quired to kill half the animals treated
with a pesticide. This dose is termed to
be the LD50 (lethal dose to kill 50 per-
cent).

b. An LD50 is always expressed as mg/kg

or g/kg. An LD50 of 3 mg/kg means
that a dose of 3 mg of pure toxicant
per kg of animal body weight will nor-
mally be lethal to half of the test ani-
mals.

3. Pesticide classifications based upon LD50

ratings are listed in Table 1. Almost all
home, yard, and garden pesticides are
category III or IV chemicals. Nicotine
has an LD50 of 50 to 60 mg/kg so is a
class II chemical. Pyrethrum’s LD50 rat-
ing is 1,500 mg/kg.
B. Pesticide Formulations

1. As previously described, almost all pesti-

cides are marketed in formulations that
contain considerably less than 100 per-
cent of the active ingredient. The hazard,
therefore, of even a category I chemical
in a typical home, yard, or garden formu-
lation would be small.

2. Some formulations pose a lower hazard

than others, simply because of their
physical state. For example, a granular
pesticide will normally pose a lower haz-
ard than an emulsifiable concentrate be-
cause it is more difficult to ingest or ab-
sorb through the skin.

C. Exposure to Pesticides

1. Pesticides can enter the body through one

of three methods:
a. Through the digestive tract (ingestion).
b. Through the respiratory system (inha-

lation).

c. Through the skin (dermal absorption).
Eyes absorb almost any chemical that
gets into them.

2. The hazard of unnecessary exposure to a

pesticide can be reduced by following
these guidelines:
a. Replace leaky hoses, valves, and con-
nections on sprayer before application.
Never use your mouth to blow out
clogged lines or nozzles.

b. Calibrate and clean application equip-
ment to ensure accurate and safe appli-
cation.

c. Always read the entire label before us-

ing a pesticide.

d. Pesticide handling and mixing should
be done outside. Watch out for wind
when mixing or applying pesticides.
Avoid breathing dust, and watch out
for the splash of liquids or the drift of
fumes.

e. Refrain from smoking, eating, or

drinking while working with pesti-
cides.

f. Wear clothing that covers the entire
body, including a nonabsorbent hat.
g. Wear unlined rubber gloves and eye
protection whenever mixing pesticides.
h. Before making outdoor pesticide ap-
plications: Close all house doors and
windows; remove any laundry, toys,
lawn furniture, and pet dishes; and
keep children and pets out of the
sprayed area until the pesticide has
dried. If using a dust formulation, keep
children and pets out of the area until
dust completely settles.

i. Before making indoor pesticide appli-

cations: Remove or cover all food,
dishes, utensils, pet dishes, and toys;
keep children and pets out of the appli-
cation area. If you have an aquarium,
cover it, and be sure to switch off the
aeration pump; cover any openings.
j. Always apply pesticides in a manner
that will minimize pesticide drift onto
nontarget vegetation and the property
of others.

k. Wash yourself, your equipment, and

your clothing immediately upon
completion of pesticide applications.
Always wash contaminated clothing
separately from other clothing.

D. Pesticide Poisoning

1. People vary considerably in their suscep-
tibility and reactions to pesticides. Chil-
dren are particularly susceptible because
of their small size and weight. A dose that
might make an adult sick could be fatal
for a child. In addition, a child’s body is
often less able than an adult’s to detoxify
some compounds.

2. The common symptoms of pesticide poi-
soning are headaches, giddiness, nausea,
blurred vision, and chest pains. Anyone
complaining of these symptoms within 12
hours after exposure to a pesticide should
be sent to the nearest medical facility.

Note: It is very important that the pesticide

label or container (or at least the name
of the compound) also be delivered to
the doctor so appropriate first aid can
be administered. If the container is
transported, carry it in such a way that
no further exposure to the victim or
others occurs.

3. Emergency first-aid procedures for pesti-

cide poisoning:
a. Pesticide in the eyes: Flush eyes with a

gentle stream of tap water for at least
15 minutes.

b. Pesticide in the mouth: Flush mouth

out with tap water for 15 minutes.

c. Pesticide spilled on clothing: Remove
clothing; wash skin with soap and water.

Chapter 8, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

8 - 6

d. Pesticide swallowed: Read and follow
the first-aid directions on the label. If
there are no directions, go directly to
the nearest medical facility.

Note: Drinking water or milk will rarely in-

crease the problem and may reduce the
potential damage by diluting the
chemical.

E. Pesticide Spills

1. Liquids.

a. The spill should be covered with any

substance that will absorb the pesticide
(kitty litter, sawdust, sand, dirt, or
even disposable diapers).

b. After the pesticide has been absorbed,

the material should be swept up and
placed in a plastic garbage bag within
another garbage bag. If the pesticide is
a home, lawn, or garden formulation,
the bag may be disposed of via your
standard garbage collection service.
c. The spill area should then be washed
with detergent or an ammonia solu-
tion. Call Chem Trec toll free at
1-800-424-9300 to find out what to
use. Using the wrong solution could
generate toxic gases. Prevent any con-
taminated soil from running into storm
drains or open bodies of water.

2. Dry pesticides should be swept up and
used or disposed of in accordance with
the label instructions. The spill area may
also require washing with detergent or a
chlorine or ammonia solution.

F. Pesticide Storage

1. Store pesticides in a cool, well-ventilated
place that is inaccessible to children and
pets. The area should be away from food,
feed, and seeds, and should be locked.

2. Store pesticides in their original contain-

ers. Never store pesticides in soft drink
bottles or other containers that may be
confused with foodstuffs. Always main-
tain a label on the container.

Note: It is illegal to store chemicals in any-

thing other than their original containers.

3. Discard unidentified pesticides.
4. Store liquid pesticides in a place where
they will not be exposed to temperatures
below freezing or above 80°F. Heat can
degrade the active ingredients in dusts,
granules, and soluble powders.

5. Be sure caps are secure on bottles or cans

and check regularly for leakage.

6. Do not store volatile herbicides with dry
pesticides, as the volatile products may
contaminate the other products.

G. Pesticide Disposal Options

1. The best way to dispose of excess pesti-

cides is to use them up in accordance
with label directions. Buy small quanti-
ties—only the amount you can use up in
one season.

2. Neutralize the pesticide if there are direc-

tions on the label for doing so.

3. Do not dump pesticides into a public

sewage system via the sink or the toilet.
Do not dump them into a street gutter that
drains into open water. Sprayers should
also not be drained near a well, pond, irri-
gation ditch, or stream.

4. Do not discard pesticide or containers

where soil, crops, water, or animals can
become contaminated.

5. Before disposing of a pesticide container,
triple rinse it. The pesticide contaminated
water (rinsate) should be used in your
sprayer. Never dump rinsate onto the
ground, into a drain, or into a gutter.

6. Puncture or crush empty metal containers

(except aerosol cans), and bury them in
an approved landfill. Do not burn.

7. Empty and triple rinsed containers may

be wrapped in newspaper and disposed of
via your local garbage collection service.
Rinsate should be used for diluting more
pesticide, if possible.

8. Anyone wanting to dispose of unused

pesticides should contact their local
health department for proper disposal in-
structions.

XI. Pesticide Law

The primary law homeowners should be aware
of regarding safe use of pesticides is the Fed-

Chapter 8, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

8 - 7

eral Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA).
A. This law regulates all pesticides from the
time of their manufacture until their ulti-
mate degradation.

B. The most important part of this law, as it

pertains to homeowners, involves the actual
use of any pesticide. FIFRA states, “any
use of a pesticide in a manner inconsis-
tent with label instructions is a violation
of this Act.”

C. All pesticide users should be aware that they

are subject to the provision of FIFRA.

XII. Pesticide Recommendations

Before recommending the use of any pesticide,
consider the following:
A. It is illegal to use a pesticide on any site or
crop other than those listed on the pesticide
label. It also is illegal to recommend a pesti-
cide on a site or crop other than those listed
on the pesticide label.
Example: A client asks if it is all right to eat
a vegetable that was sprayed with a particu-
lar insecticide. You find that the pesticide in
question is not labeled for use on this gar-
den product. You tell your client that you
cannot recommend eating that vegetable,
even though you may feel that the hazard is
minimal.

B. In your capacity as a Master Gardener,

your pesticide recommendations must be
made in accordance with the pesticide
guidelines provided on the pesticide label.
Extension publications and the Pacific
Northwest pest control guides are based on
pesticide labels.

C. Your pesticide recommendations must be

limited to home, yard, and garden pest con-
trol. Pesticide recommendations for agricul-
tural or commercial pest problems may be
made only by licensed consultants.

Basic Entomology

V. J. Parker-Clark

Vickie J. Parker-Clark, District I Extension Director, Coeur d’Alene

I. Introduction

The animal kingdom contains many distinct

groups called phyla. Each phylum is divided
into a number of classes. The insects are in the
class Insecta (or Hexapoda—“six feet”) within
the phylum Arthropoda (jointed foot). The in-
sect class is further divided into orders, fami-
lies, genera, and finally, species.

Approximately 1 million species of insects have
been identified to date. The greatest numbers
of these species belong to the beetle, fly, and
wasp-bee-ant groups. We generally associate
insects with crop loss or disease transmission;
however, insects fulfill a useful function in our
environment.

Only a small percentage of insects are considered
pests of humans and of their animals, crops, or
fiber. However, this small number can cause
serious crop losses, or transmit serious dis-
eases to humans or animals.

Most insects appear to be beneficial or harmless.

Many are predators, such as lady beetles,
which live by feeding on pestiferous aphids.
Others are parasitic, such as the wasps. Still
others, such as honey bees, act as
pollinators of crops and also pro-
vide us with honey. Many insects
are responsible for the decomposi-
tion of plant and animal matter. A
good example is the carpenter ant.
Obviously, when it is attacking the
timber of our home it is a pest,
however, when it is in the forest
mining the wood of old, fallen
trees, it is part of nature’s recycling
program.

head

Size is quite variable throughout the

insect world. The extremes include
tiny wasps that are less than a milli-

mouthparts

meter long, and some of the larger long-horned
beetles that are as much as 6 inches long.

Except for a few common structural features, in-

sects are also variable in appearance. Some
have bizarre horns and spines, while others
may resemble dead leaves. Some insects are
quite attractive like the butterfly, but “beauti-
ful” is hardly the word for a cockroach.

All of this makes insects a fascinating group to
investigate, but it also makes the study of in-
sects and their classification somewhat com-
plex. It is important to learn the main differ-
ences among insects, so that we can distin-
guish one group from another. Then we can
suggest adequate control procedures and give
quality management suggestions.

II. Insect Anatomy

Insects are animals, however, unlike many ani-
mals, they have no backbones. They have an
outer skeleton (exoskeleton) instead of the in-
ner skeleton (endoskeleton) of most large ani-
mals. The following characteristics separate
insects from other animals (Fig. 1).

thorax

wings

abdomen

antenna

legs

Fig. 1. Parts of an insect.

Chapter 9, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

9 - 2

A. Insects have three body regions—Head, tho-

rax, and abdomen.

B. Many adult insects have wings, and insects

are the only flying invertebrates.

C. Adults possess three pairs of legs, all lo-

cated on the thorax.

III. Insect Development

All insects change during growth by a process
called metamorphosis (Fig. 2). Insect near-
relatives such as spiders, mites, and centipedes
also undergo metamorphosis.

The more highly developed insects make the

most complete changes. Beetles, moths, butter-
flies, wasps, and ants all go through four
stages. These are the egg, larva, pupa, and
adult. The larva is usually the damaging stage,
although adult feeding can be destructive.
Also, it is not unusual for the larval and adult
stages of a species to feed on different hosts or
different parts of the host. The pupa is a
nonfeeding stage; in most cases it is also very
inactive.

The lower forms or less-developed kinds of in-

sects change only slightly during metamorpho-
sis. True bugs, aphids, grasshoppers, termites,
earwigs, stoneflies, etc., go through only three
stages. These stages are the egg, nymph, and
adult. Except for size, the nymph and adult
closely resemble each other. The major differ-
ence is the lack of fully formed wings in the
nymph. The nymph and adult generally feed
on the same host or host parts.

IV. Insect Classification

There are several methods of separating or cat-
egorizing insects.
A. The professional uses body parts for identi-

fication and observes differences in these
parts through a microscope. He or she tracks
down an insect’s identity by using a written
insect “key.” The anatomy of an insect will
place it into a specific insect group called an
order. If you are around entomological ac-

tivities much, you will often hear the phrase
“keying out.” This simply means identifying
the insect (see MS 109 in “Further Reading”).

B. Insects are also classified by the type of

damage they cause. Some examples include
“root maggot,” “twig girdler,” or “crown
borer.” Destructive insect activities help
narrow down the multitude of possible iden-
tities and often make insect identification
quicker and simpler.

C. Some insects can be categorized as preda-

tors or parasites. Predators and parasites ac-
count for much of the reduction of pest in-
sect populations in nature, and, for this rea-
son, are also called beneficials (see PNW
343 in “Further Reading”).
Beneficials can be useful, but they usually
need some cultural encouragement. Their
use requires careful crop management and a
degree of tolerance for some crop loss.
1. Predators kill and feed on their prey; they

are generally larger than their prey.

2. Parasites are usually smaller and often
weaker than their prey; they gradually
kill by injecting eggs that develop on,
within, or near the insect over a period of
time. They may sting and paralyze their
prey in order to stock their nests with
food for the developing larvae or eggs.
The immature parasites will then con-
sume the paralyzed insect at their leisure.

D. Another form of categorization is by feed-
ing mechanism or mouthpart. The broadest
grouping is defined by chewing or sucking
mouthparts (Fig. 3).

Although this manner of separation is some-
what helpful for identification, its greatest
value is in determining if a certain kind of
pesticide will work. For example, systemic
insecticides “generally” do not work as well
on chewing insects as on sucking insects.
Proper identification is extremely important.
If a beneficial insect or a nondamaging in-
sect is improperly identified as a pest, a pes-
ticide application will usually disrupt a
natural control agent. The disruption of this
beneficial’s activity may induce the need for
the chemical. Chances are you may have
made an application that did no more for
you than cost you money.

Note: Do not make recommendations based
on the verbal description of a pest by a
client. Too many misidentifications are
made this way, and wrong identifica-
tion leads to ineffective control mea-
sures and unnecessary expense or
problems. Insist on seeing the pest, or
at least its damage, before you volun-
teer anything.

V. Major Orders of Insects

Major insect groupings under the class level are
called orders. Some representatives that you
will see are: beetles—Coleoptera; moths and

Table 1. Major order of insects.

butterflies—Lepidoptera; flies—Diptera; bees,
ants, wasps, hornets—Hymenoptera; true bugs,
such as stink bugs—Hemiptera; aphids, scales,
and leafhoppers—Homoptera; grasshoppers,
crickets, and cockroaches—Orthoptera; ter-
mites—Isoptera; earwigs—Dermaptera. There
are many other insect orders, but these are rep-
resentatives of economic importance.

Separating groups of insects may be quite diffi-
cult unless you have closely studied examples
of the various types. It is important to recog-
nize the structural characteristics that distin-
guish one insect from another (see “Further
Reading”). Use all of the characteristics listed
in Table 1 to distinguish each order.
A. Beetles and Weevils—Coleoptera

Some of the typical beetles that you may see
are long-horned beetles and flatheaded bor-
ers that bore into trees, logs, and lumber.
These beetles are variable in color. Long-
horned beetles usually have long antennae
and are strong fliers. Lady beetles are about
1/4-inch long and are usually red or orange,
generally with spots. Lady beetles are ben-
eficial as larvae and adults, since they feed
on aphids and other soft-bodied insect and
mite pests. Some other common beetles are
the pea weevil, an important pest of peas,
and click beetles, whose larvae are known
to some of you as wireworms.

1. Adults have a hardened, horny outer skel-

eton.

2. Adults have two pairs of wings; the outer
pair is hardened, and the inner pair mem-
branous.

Note: A few beetles are practically wingless,
and some have only an outer hard pair
of wings.

3. Beetles have chewing mouthparts.
4. Adults usually develop noticeable anten-

nae.

5. Coleoptera larvae have a head capsule
and three pairs of legs on the abdomen.

Note: Weevil larvae lack legs on the thorax.

6. Both beetles and weevils go through a
complete metamorphosis as in Fig. 4.

7. Some authorities consider the beetles to
be the largest group or order of insects in
nature.

B. Moths and Butterflies—Lepidoptera

The moth and butterfly group has several
damaging members. Cutworms damage
many crops. For example, corn earworm
larvae, which are greenish or tannish with
some stripes and about 1 1/4-inch long
when fully grown, cause severe damage to
corn and attack a variety of vegetables.
Alfalfa, celery, and cabbage loopers have
injurious larvae. They are often known as
measuring worms because of their looping
action, which gives the impression that they
are measuring the plant on which they are
feeding.

Fig. 4. Metamorphosis of a beetle.

(cid:31)

(cid:31)

(cid:31)

Another Lepidoteran is the codling moth,
which does damage to apples. The peach
twig borer is a severe pest of peaches,
prunes, plums, and apricots.
1. Adults are soft-bodied with four well-

developed, membranous wings covered
with small scales.

2. Adult mouthparts consist of a coiled,

sucking tube; adults feed on nectar and
other liquids.

3. The larvae are caterpillars that are worm-
like, and variable in color; they are vora-
cious feeders.

4. The larvae have chewing mouthparts.
5. The larvae have true legs on the thorax
and a variable number of prolegs on the
abdomen.

6. Lepidopterans undergo complete meta-

morphosis as in Fig. 5.

C. Flies, Mosquitoes, Gnats, Midges—Diptera

Flies are an important group in terms of
their medical effects on humans and ani-
mals. Some, such as bot flies, are parasites
as immatures on mammals. Some flies, such
as the face fly, disrupt or annoy livestock,
causing the cows or other animals to stop
feeding. Fly maggots or larvae are generally
found in manure or other decaying matter.
The flies most commonly encountered are
the housefly, the lesser house fly, and the
face fly. The grayish adults infest homes,
poultry houses, and livestock. The house fly
has been suspected of mechanically trans-
mitting such diseases as polio to food sur-
faces.

Commercial agricultural insect pests in this
order include the cherry fruit fly, walnut
husk fly, onion and cabbage maggot, and
carrot rust fly. Others are often disease vec-
tors, such as mosquitoes or deerflies. Vec-
tors can transmit such diseases as malaria.
Mosquitoes are small, slender, long-legged,
frail flies. The larvae are elongate and live
in water. The adult female is the injurious
stage. She feeds by sucking human and live-
stock blood by piercing the skin with her
long stiletto-like mouthparts.
1. Adults have only one pair of wings and

are rather soft-bodied and hairy.

2. Adults have sponging (house fly) or

piercing (mosquito) mouthparts.

3. Diptera larvae may have mouth hooks or

chewing mouthparts.

4. Most larvae are legless.
5. The larvae of advanced forms, such as

the house fly and relatives, have no head
capsule, possess mouth hooks, and are
called maggots. Lower forms such as
mosquito larvae and relatives have a head
capsule.

6. Diptera undergo complete metamorpho-

sis as in Fig. 6.

D. Bees, Wasps, Ants, Sawflies, etc.—

Hymenoptera
This group is a large one. Many of its mem-
bers are important pollinators of agricultural
crops, such as the honeybee, leafcutter bee,
and alkali bee. Some are important preda-
tors, parasites, and scavengers; others are
injurious to humans and their crops.

1. Pear slug—The adult is black with yel-
low markings. The larva is small, slug-
like, and feeds on leaves of pear, cherry,
and plum.

2. Yellowjackets—The adults have black

and yellow markings. They build nests in
the ground, or papery structures on trees
or under eaves. Their stings are painful
and dangerous if you are allergic to them.
Many species are beneficial predators.
3. Leafcutting bees—These are small- to
medium-sized bees, variable in color.
They are noted for their long tongues.
One species is an excellent alfalfa polli-
nator. Leafcutters may defoliate some
trees and shrubs.

4. Common ants—Several ants, such as the
carpenter ants and the house ants (includ-
ing the pavement ant and odorous house
ant), are in this group. Many are benefi-
cial predators or decomposers.
a. The adults have two pairs of membra-

nous wings.

b. The adults generally have chewing

mouthparts.

c. The adults are rather soft-bodied or

have slightly hardened bodies.

d. The larvae have no legs (wasps, bees,

ants) or have legs on the thorax and
the abdomen (some sawflies).

5. Hymenoptera undergo complete meta-

morphosis as in Fig. 7.

E. True Bugs—Hemiptera

Consperse stink bug—A gray or brownish
plant bug that is shield shaped. The stink
bug feeds on many fruits and vegetables.

1. Boxelder bug—This bug is gray-brown
to black with red lines on the under sur-
face and on the lower portion of the outer
wings. It feeds primarily on boxelder and
can invade homes in early summer or
fall.

2. Lygus bug—These bugs are greenish, or
brownish black and occasionally yellow-
ish or gray; they are rather slim plant
bugs about 1/4-inch long. The head is
blotched with black. They are probably
the most injurious bugs of seed crops in
the United States.
a. The adults have two pairs of wings;
the second pair is membranous, the
first pair is membranous and thickened
on the basal half. The nymphs are not
fully formed and are called “wing
pads.”

b. Adults and nymphs usually resemble

one another.

c. True bugs have piercing-sucking

mouthparts.

d. Adults and nymphs both are damaging

stages.

e. True bugs have a gradual metamor-
phosis (Fig. 8). The stages are egg,
nymph, and adult.

F. Aphids, Scales, Leafhoppers, Cicadas—

Homoptera
1. Aphid—There are many types, sizes, and
shapes of aphids. The giant willow aphid
is a large, black species. The pea aphid is
a rather large, green species found on al-
falfa, peas, clover, sweet clover, and
other herbaceous legumes. It may also be
pinkish in color. Several species of
aphids attack vegetable and tree crops,

Fig. 8. Metamorphosis of a bug.

(cid:31)

(cid:31)

including the green peach aphid, which
carries the leaf roll virus of potatoes and
sugarbeets. The rose aphid, both green
and brown forms, are found on many or-
namentals. Apple aphids, and green, rosy,
and woolly aphids all cause severe dam-
age to apples.

2. Scales—Scale insects are usually quite

small and are usually circular or football-
shaped. During most of their life cycle,
they are protected by a hardened scale
covering. San Jose scale is a pest of many
fruit trees and ornamentals. Oyster shell
scale is a brown cornucopia-shaped scale
(horn of plenty) found on ornamental
trees and shrubs. Lecanium scale is a
large, brown, hemispherical-shaped scale
found on trees and woody plants of sev-
eral types.
a. These insects are generally small and
soft-bodied, though cicadas are larger
and hard-bodied.

b. Members may be winged or wingless.
c. All stages have sucking mouthparts.
d. Many members are carriers of plant

pathogens.

e. Homopterans have a gradual metamor-

phosis as the aphid in Fig. 9.

G. Grasshoppers, Crickets, Cockroaches,

Camel Crickets—Orthoptera
Some examples of grasshoppers and their
allies are migratory and two-striped grass-
hoppers and the red-legged grasshopper.
These are damaging pests of crops and
rangeland. The camel cricket, the Jerusalem
cricket, and the German roach are also com-
monly encountered. Crickets also can dam-
age crops. The German cockroach is a met-
ropolitan pest.
1. Adults are moderate to large and are of-

ten rather hard-bodied.

2. Adults usually have two pairs of wings.

The forewings are elongated, narrow, and
leathery; the second pair of wings are
membranous with an extensive folded
area.

3. Adults and nymphs have chewing mouth-

parts and are damaging.

4. The hind legs of forms other than cock-
roaches and walking sticks are enlarged
for jumping.

5. Immature stages are called nymphs and,

except for being wingless, resemble
adults.

6. Orthopterans have a simple metamorpho-

sis as in Fig. 10.
H. Termites—Isoptera

The injurious termites are generally placed
in two groups: the dampwood and subterra-
nean types. Both feed on wood and wood
products. The dampwood types are usually
not primary feeders on sound wood in build-
ings, while the subterranean types are found
in large numbers in sound structures where
they may do considerable damage if not de-
tected early and controlled quickly. Colo-
nies of the subterranean type must have a
connection with soil to obtain moisture.
1. These are so-called “white ants.”
2. Termites are distinguished from true
ants by their thick “waists” and their
white or light brown color.

3. Termites have thin, straight antennae;

ants have elbowed antennae.

4. Termites have chewing mouthparts.
5. They possess many forms or castes
such a worker, soldier, and queen.

6. Termites have a gradual metamorpho-

sis as in Fig. 11.

I. Earwigs—Dermaptera

The European earwig is our only species of
earwig. It is occasionally a pest of gardens,

(cid:31)

(cid:31)

ornamentals, small trees, and houses
throughout the state of Idaho, but it may
also be beneficial since it often preys upon
other insects.
1. Adults are moderately sized.
2. They have chewing mouthparts.
3. Earwigs are elongated, flattened and have

strong, movable forceps on the rear end.

4. They have short, hardened outer wings

and cover folded, membranous inner
wings.

5. Earwigs have a gradual metamorphosis

(Fig. 12).

J. Thrips—Thysanoptera

1. Thrips are small with sucking mouthparts
that are assisted by a single mandible that
aids in rasping the plant tissue.

2. Wings may be present or absent. If

present, they are long and narrow and
fringed with long hairs.

3. Many feed on ornamentals and some on
vegetable crops such as peas and onions.
Many are predators on other insects. A
few species bite humans.

4. Thrips have a gradual metamorphosis.

(cid:31)

(cid:31)

Chapter 9, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

9 - 8

K. Silverfish and Firebrats—Thysanura

1. Group members have chewing mouth-

parts.

2. Thysanura is one of the few insect orders

whose members do not possess wings.
3. These insects have bristles on the tip of

the abdomen.

4. They are household pests and feed on

such items as paste, paper, and crumbs.

5. They have a gradual metamorphosis.

L. Springtails—Collembolla

1. Springtails are minute insects with chew-

ing or piercing mouthparts.

2. They possess an appendage on their ven-
tral (under) side; it operates as a spring to
aid the insect in quick escape.

3. These insects are abundant in moist

areas, hence the reference to “moving
piles of soot” in backyards during the
wetter seasons.

4. They feed on decaying organic material

primarily but will on occasion attack
plants, particularly in greenhouses.

5. Springtails undergo a gradual metamor-

phosis.

M. Other Orders

Many other insect orders are of no real con-
cern in the home garden. Some of the more
common ones are stoneflies—Plecoptera;
caddisflies—Thichoptera; dragonflies and
damsel flies—Odonata; and mayflies—
Ephemeroptera. These orders are all associ-
ated with aquatic habitats.
Some others you should be aware of include
the nerve-winged insects—Neuroptera,

many of which are beneficial predators;
book or bark lice—Psocoptera, basically
scavengers, but with some species that are
stored-products pests; animal lice and suck-
ing lice—Anaplura; and chewing lice—
Mallophaga.

VI. Other Insect-Like Creatures

Several noninsect pests may be found in the
field and home and include those listed in
Table 2.
A. Spider Mites, Spiders, Ticks, and

Scorpions—Arachnida
1. Spider mites—These tiny, soft-bodied
animals have two body regions, thick
waists, four pairs of legs, and are without
antennae. Common species include the
following.
a. The two-spotted spider mite and its
near relatives, the Pacific, Atlantic,
and McDaniel spider mites. These
mites have two spots on the back and
have tail-end spots in some species.
They may be clear, green, orange, or
red. They are usually hard to observe
without a hand lens.

b. European red mite: This mite is car-

mine red with white spines.

c. Brown mite and the clover mite: These
mites are brownish or grayish, flat, and
have very long front legs.

2. Spiders—Spiders resemble mites except
that most are larger and the two body re-
gions are more clearly distinct from one
another (thin waist). Most spiders are
beneficial predators. Common pest spe-
cies include:

a. Black widow spider: Shy and likes

D. Sowbugs and Pillbugs—Crustacea

dank, dark places. This spider spins a
characteristically messy web. It is nor-
mally a shiny black, moderately sized
spider with a reddish or orange hour-
glass marking on the underside of the
abdomen. Males and immature fe-
males can have stripes of red, yellow,
and black on the abdomen.

b. The hobo spider, sometimes called the
aggressive house spider: Is a common
light brown spider that is often found
in basements. This spider has a pain-
less bite, but sometimes the skin
sloughs off in the bite area.

c. The brown recluse spider: A poisonous
spider which, fortunately, does not oc-
cur in the Pacific Northwest, however,
it is a potential threat. It is often con-
fused with harmless wolf spiders and
other hunting spiders. The brown re-
cluse spider can be recognized easily
by a distinct, brown “fiddle case” on a
light brown or grayish background.

3. Ticks—Ticks resemble large mites and
are important in agriculture and medi-
cine. They are parasites of humans and
animals.

Millipedes are generally inoffensive crea-
tures that feed on fungi and decaying plant
material. At times, they can be fairly de-
structive to vegetables or other plants in
greenhouses. They are elongate inverte-
brates with two visible body regions: a
head and a body. They generally are
rounded in cross section. With the excep-
tion of the first four or five segments, all
of the body segments possess two pairs of
legs. They are relatively slow moving.

C. Centipedes—Chilopoda

Centipedes strongly resemble millipedes.
They are different in that they have longer
antennae, are flattened in cross section,
have only one pair of legs on each body
segment, and move rapidly. They are ben-
eficial because they prey on other
arthropods.

B. Millipedes—Diploda

MS 109

Sowbugs are highly dependent on mois-
ture, which accounts for their common as-
sociation with damp habitats. Generally,
they feed on decaying plant material, but
they will attack young plants in green-
houses and gardens. They are oval with a
hard convex outer shell made up of a num-
ber of plates.

E. Garden Centipede or Symphylan—

Symphla
Members of this group resemble tiny centi-
pedes. Generally, they are a pest of veg-
etables and found in damp soils rich in or-
ganic matter.

Insect Management

V. J. Parker-Clark

Vickie J. Parker-Clark, District I Extension Director, Coeur d’Alene

I. Terms and Definitions

A.Insecticide—A chemical used to control,

repel, suppress, or kill insects.

B. Preharvest Interval—The amount of time
that must elapse (legally) after application
of pesticide before harvest takes place.

II. Why Worry About Insect Control?

A. The average insect population per square
mile is estimated to be equal to the world
human population.

B. Destruction of crops by insects in the United

States ranges from $4 billion to $15 billion
annually.

C. Forest insects destroy more useful timber

than do forest fires.

D. Termites consume about $100 million worth

of wood structures annually.

III. Methods of Insect Control Available

to Homeowners
A. Mechanical Insect Control

1. Can be used on all insect pests.
2. Manual removal of insects and eggs from

infested plants.
a. Two-block method: Place the insect on

one block (wood or stone) and strike
with second block. Repeat as needed.

b. A soap and water spray (or water

alone) is sometimes helpful for control
of aphids and similar insects.

c. Light traps: Be careful not to use lights
that may attract insects to your garden.
3. Advantages—Extremely selective; can be
slightly to extremely effective, depending
upon the species of insect and the crop.

4. Disadvantages—Time consuming. Many
insect species can fly away or drop to the
ground and therefore escape control ef-
forts.

B. Chemical Insect Control

1. Specific insecticides control only certain
insect species. It is important to know the
target species and the crop affected be-
fore selecting an insecticide.

2. It is particularly important to apply the
insecticide properly. This includes care-
fully measuring the chemical, carefully
diluting the solution with the correct
amount of water, and taking care not to
apply too much or too little spray.

3. Apply insecticides only to plant species
listed on the product’s label. Failure to
follow label directions may result in dam-
age to desirable plants or unhealthy resi-
dues in foods.

4. Always determine the safe preharvest in-
terval for a crop you plan to spray with a
given insecticide. This information can
be found in one of two written formats on
pesticide labels.
a. Written out on a pesticide label. For
example, Ortho Sevin 5 Dust states
that the product should not be applied
to cole crops within 3 days of harvest.

b. Written as a number between paren-

theses immediately after the crop list-
ing on the label. For example, Lilly
Miller Fruit and Berry Insect Spray
has the listing Apples (7), indicating a
preharvest interval for apples of 7
days.

5. Always read and follow label directions

carefully.

6. Advantages—Good to excellent control
of insect pests; a minimum of labor is re-
quired.

7. Disadvantages—Special application

equipment needed; spray programs are
often rather inflexible regarding harvest
times; beneficial insects often are killed.

C. Biological Insect Control

1. Use of beneficial insects can be difficult

to assess for the homeowner. Many in-
sects are offered for sale (particularly la-
dybird beetles, lacewings, and praying
mantids), but success with these intro-
duced predators is often inconsistent.
Also, these insects may have to be rein-
troduced each year in order to maintain a
garden’s population after winter kill or
migration.

2. It is a good idea to be able to identify

beneficial insect species in all their
growth stages, so as to prevent their unin-
tentional destruction as pests.

3. Advantages—No labor is involved; after
the initial release, the population can be
self-perpetuating. You can establish bio-
logical control, as the predator will target
only the pest. For example, Bacillis
thuringiensis is useful for caterpillars.
4. Disadvantages—Only selected insect

species will be controlled; control may
often be cyclical or incomplete.

D. Cultural Insect Control

1. For homeowners, the most important cul-

tural control is to maintain good plant
health with proper care through an effec-
tive water and nutrition system. A
healthy plant is better able to withstand
insect infestations.

2. Crop rotation breaks plant/insect pest re-

lationships. By varying the location of
crops within a garden (when possible), or
by not growing certain crop types for a
number of years, certain insect pest popu-
lations can be drastically reduced.

3. Highly organic soils provide attractive

habitat for many soil insects. In addition,
insecticides are more rapidly broken
down in these soils.

4. Companion crops are often used to repel
insect pests, or to attract them away from
crops. Don’t rely on these methods with-
out constant observation. If they do not
work, be prepared to spray, plow, dig up,
etc.
a. Repellent crops are specific as to

which plants they protect and which
insects they affect. For example, mari-
golds are useful in repelling cutworms.
At best they can be marginally effec-
tive; at worst, they will attract un-
wanted insects to your garden.

Note: Marigolds often attract leafminer butter-

flies.

b. Trap crops can quickly become over-
run with insects. For example, nastur-
tiums can attract cabbage aphids away
from cole crops. If aphids are not con-
trolled on the trap crop, they will even-
tually move to the crop you are trying
to protect.

5. Weed and volunteer crop control pre-

vents them from becoming an alternative
food for insects, particularly before crop
emergence. Weed residues can also har-
bor insect pests.

6. Sanitation in your lawn and garden area
is very important, as many insects are at-
tracted to, and overwinter in, plant debris
or trimmings. Nonproducing vegetable
plants should be removed or turned under
as soon as possible after harvest to deny
insect pests a “free lunch” or an overwin-
tering site. Clear away planks, cardboard
boxes, and overgrown areas; these pro-
vide an excellent habitat for pests such as
slugs, sowbugs, and earwigs.

7. Resistant crop varieties are sometimes
available to the homeowner, although
most resistance involves plant diseases
and not insects.

8. Using transplants or adjusting seeding
dates to avoid emergence of the plant
during peak insect populations may help
reduce damage.

Chapter 10, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

10 - 3

9. Advantages—Often simple to perform;
often accomplished through other good
gardening techniques.

10. Disadvantages—Generally incomplete.

E. Regulatory Insect Control (Quarantines)
1. Generally, quarantines take two forms:

a. No movement of the host crop allowed

out of an area. This method keeps the
insect more localized where control
programs can be implemented more
effectively.

b. No movement of the possibly contami-

nated host crop is allowed into a
“clean” area. This keeps the insect out
of an area where infestations could be
disastrous.

2. Under quarantine laws, government

agencies may be allowed to use a part of
chemical control under emergency use
guidelines.

3. Advantage—By requiring a control ef-
fort, the spread of certain pestiferous in-
sects can be slowed, once infestation is
identified.

4. Disadvantages—Laws must be enforced

to do any good and geographical situa-
tions may limit control.
F. Integrated Insect Control

1. The best insect control plans start with

the simpler methods, then progress to in-
clude aspects from all types of control.
For example, a control program for the
cabbage maggot may begin with trans-
plants. This approach allows older, more
vigorous seedlings to escape infestation.
2. Transplanting is followed by the destruc-

tion of plants immediately upon harvest
of cole crops. Quick destruction after har-
vest prevents maggots from completing
their life cycle.

3. If cabbage maggots continue to be

troublesome, placement of lorsban or
Diazinon granules around transplants
may be attempted. This method prevents
infestation of roots.

4. If maggots still remain a problem, it may
be necessary to stop growing cole crops
for a season or two or to only grow them
every other year. Allowing the field to lie

fallow, or switching to another sort of
crop, may reduce the population of cab-
bage maggots in the garden.

IV. Specific Pests

A. Ornamental Pests

1. Balsam woolly adelgid—Ap-
pear as white, woolly masses
on limbs and trunks of all firs.
All active stages have sucking
mouthparts and cause dam-
age. Spray timing is impor-
tant. Spray to ensure adequate
control. Sprays may stunt or
kill trees. Organic phosphate
aphid pesticides do not ad-
equately control adelgids.

2. Spruce aphids—These aphids

are dull green with sucking
mouthparts. All active stages
damage spruce trees, and the
damage is frequently very se-
rious. For example, they can
cause severe needle drop.
Spray in February or late win-
ter.

3. Cooley spruce gall adelgid—

Appear as white, cottony
masses on firs. They have
sucking mouthparts, and all
stages cause damage. They
tend to alternate between
spruces and Douglas-fir. They
cause galling on spruces and
yellowing and needle distor-
tion on both types of trees.
Organic phosphate aphid pes-
ticides do not adequately con-
trol adelgids. Treat spruce as
the new growth is unfold-
ing in the spring. Treat
Douglas-fir in early spring.
4. Rose aphid—Many species of

aphids attack the rose, par-
ticularly when there is new
growth. They cause chlorosis
(yellowing green tissue), and
they may produce a toxin that
kills leaf tissue. Rose aphids
excrete honeydew and cause

Chapter 10, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

10 - 4

sooty molds. Some people
hose plants periodically,
but hosing may lead to
other problems such as dis-
eases. Check any chemicals
suggested for treatment.
Some may adversely affect
the plant.

5. Root weevil—May be 1/4
to 1/2 inch long. They can
be black, brown, or gray.
They have chewing mouth-
parts. Root weevils often
attack ornamentals, such as
azaleas and rhododendrons,
and many garden groups.
The white larvae are C-
shaped. When the larvae
feed on the roots, the plant
becomes spindly. Feeding
allows entry by root rots.
Larvae may also girdle
crowns, particularly in con-
tainerized plants. Adults
appear in June and feed un-
til September. Their effect
is less serious. They tend to
notch leaves. Though they
rarely kill the plant, the re-
sult is unsightly. They usu-
ally feed at night. Root
weevils’ fall migrations
into homes may cause
some owners alarm, but
their purpose is hiberna-
tion. Spray for adults at
regular intervals starting in
late June.

6. Elm leaf beetle—Charac-

terized by black and yellow
stripes on wing covers of
the adults and bodies of the
larvae. They generally ap-
pear April through August.
These beetles live through
two generations and may
overwinter in homes. They
have chewing mouthparts.
Both larvae and adults
cause damage to elms. The

adults chew small holes in
leaves, while the larvae
skeletonize leaves. They
can cause complete defo-
liation.

Note: Destroy if found.

7. Leafhopper—Small tor-
pedo-shaped insects with
wings held roof-like over
the body. Found in a vari-
ety of colors. Leafhoppers
are active jumpers. They
attack a variety of orna-
mentals, fruit trees, and
garden plants, and may be
found throughout the grow-
ing season. They have
sucking mouthparts and
feed on the undersides of
leaves, which causes white
speckling on leaves (hop-
per-burn). Leafhoppers can
transmit virus diseases.

8. Cotoneaster webworm—

Small, dark-brown to black
caterpillars are the damag-
ing stage. They have chew-
ing mouthparts and hide in
dense webs. They tend to
skeletonize cotoneaster
leaves and can kill or se-
verely damage plants.

9. Fall webworm—Adults are

pure white moths, though
they occasionally have a
few black spots. The larvae
are yellowish brown with
long, whitish hairs arising
from orange and black
bumps. They can be identi-
fied quickly because they
form unsightly tents en-
closing entire branches.
The chewing mouthparts
are damaging. Webworms
tend to cause problems
only as larvae, and prima-
rily for ornamentals and

Chapter 10, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

10 - 5

vae have chewing mouthparts. Tent cater-
pillars are troublesome in early spring
and into summer. Sometimes you can
deal with them by clipping tents and by
burning. Forest tent caterpillars overwin-
ter as eggs in bands around twigs. De-
stroy these by crushing them. Or you can
spray in early spring; later they may be
tough to kill with chemicals.

13. Birch leafminer—Only the larvae of the

birch leafminer are damaging. They mine
and blotch the leaves of birch trees. They
have chewing mouthparts. To deal with
them, spray just after the leaves unfold in
the spring. There are two generations.
The second is in mid-July, but if you do a
good control job on the first, the second
will need only a minor use of spray to
control.

14. Scales—Scales are small, with a soft or

hard coat surrounding the insect. The
covering takes on various forms from

hardened armor to soft, cottony
masses. They often promote
sooty molds, and all active
stages are damaging to many
plants. They have sucking
mouthparts and are stationary
(sedentary) feeders. They kill
plants or plant parts. In order to
treat, find out what scale is
present and at what time the
active crawling stage is

present. Spraying with an insecticide will
be effective at that stage. Oil and sulfur
dormant sprays are usually the most ef-
fective.
B. Lawn Pests

1. Lawn moths—Damage may be mistaken
for thatch or fungus problems. The larval
stage is the most damaging. Lawn moths
have chewing mouthparts.

fruit trees. The larvae are
present from midsummer
to fall. Treatment is a prob-
lem, because if you remove
and burn the branch and
the tent, you may destroy
the symmetry of the shrub
or tree.

10. Juniper webworm—The

larvae are light brown with
dark brown stripes on the
back; they grow to a length
of 1/2 inch. The larval
stage is the most damaging.
Larvae have chewing
mouthparts, and they tend
to attack junipers and red
cedar. They feed in early
spring. Webworms can be
identified easily because
they web the foliage to-
gether. Mechanically de-
stroy the larvae when
possible.

11. Mourning cloak butterfly—Larvae are

large and black with orange spots on their
spiny backs. The larval stage is the most
damaging. Larvae attack willow, elm,
and poplar. They are foliage feeders with
chewing mouthparts. These caterpillars
are gregarious feeders and are easily con-
trolled by clipping twigs with groups of
caterpillars. Simply burn the clippings.
Spraying is not necessary if the problem
is caught early enough.

12. Tent caterpillars—The lar-

vae are rather attractive,
dark, fuzzy caterpillars.
The forest tent caterpillar
has diamond- or keyhole-
shaped spots in a row along
the back. The western tent
caterpillar is yellow with
blue lines. Tent caterpillars
congregate in small tents
during the day. The larval
stage is the damaging
stage, seriously defoliating
trees of many kinds. Lar-

Chapter 10, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

10 - 6

2. Earthworms, nightcrawlers—These are
not insects, but annelids. They are nor-
mally considered to be beneficial; how-
ever, in certain instances, intense earth-
worm activity leads to castings being
thrown up on the surface, leaving an un-
sightly lawn.

C. Houseplant Pests

See Chapter 23, “House-plants and Home
Greenhouses,” Section V, Insect Pests.

D. Tree Fruit Pests

1.Codling moth—The larvae
have chewing mouthparts
and bore into fruit. Apples
and pears are the main
hosts. The larval stage is
the most damaging. It is
extremely important to
time sprays properly. Use
recommended materials
about 10 days after full
petal fall and repeat as nec-
essary, depending on mate-
rials used and local recom-
mendations.

2. Aphid (woolly apple

aphid)—These are reddish
aphids are covered by
white woolly wax. They
have sucking mouthparts.
All active stages are dam-
aging. These aphids are
bark feeders, and their
damage interferes with the
growth of the tree, often
killing a young tree. They
also attack roots. Their at-
tacks cause the most seri-
ous injury in apple trees,
but occasionally they are
problems for pear trees.
3.Aphid (not woolly spe-

cies—They have sucking
mouthparts, and all active
stages cause damage. They
include the green peach,
plum, rosy apple, and
green apple aphids. A toxin
in the saliva causes various

plant reactions: leaf curl,
leaf cupping, stunting,
lumpy fruit, etc.

4. Apple-and-thorn skeleton-

izer—The larval stage is

the damaging stage;
the larva has chew-
ing mouthparts and
skeletonizes leaves.
The adult stage is a
moth.

5. Fruit leafrollers—The lar-
val stage is the most dam-
aging. Larvae are usually

shiny green with a
black or brown head.
They have chewing
mouthparts and feed
on the fruit and the
leaves of many orna-
mentals and fruit trees.
They tend to bind
leaves together with a
webbing to form a
hiding place.

6. Blister mite—Blister mites are arachnids,

not insects. They have chewing mouth-
parts. The only evidence of their presence
is the circular blisters within which these
tiny microscopic mites reside. They may
become so numerous as to cover an entire

tree. Young shoots suffer the most. Blis-
ter mites cause malformation of pear
fruit; they also attack apple and cotoneas-
ter trees. The blistered surfaces later turn
into scablike areas. They are best con-
trolled during the delayed-dormant period
(February or March).

7. Pear psylla—Related to aphids and leaf-
hoppers, pear psylla have sucking mouth-
parts. Feeding is done by all active
stages. The pear psylla secretes honey-
dew, which may kill leaf tissue and
which russets fruit. A sooty mold devel-

Chapter 10, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

ops in honeydew and
blackens affected tissue,
which leads to “pear de-
cline.” Other problems
from psylla include re-
duced vigor, fruit loss,
poor fruit set, and occa-
sionally the death of the
tree.

8. Pear slug—A relative of

the sawfly bee group, sev-
eral species of the pear slug
are known. The larvae are
covered with a slimy mate-
rial, making them sluglike
in appearance. The larval
stage is the most damaging.
Pear slugs have chewing
mouthparts that skeletonize
the leaves. Pears, cherries,
and roses are hosts com-
monly attacked by the pear
slug or one of its relatives.
9. Cherry fruit fly—The lar-
val stage is the most dam-
aging; the larvae have
rasping mouthparts. The
adult is a small picture-
winged fly. Eggs are laid in
fruit starting when the fruit
changes to pink or yellow
(depending upon the vari-
ety). The larvae proceed to
feed internally. Breathing
holes in fruit point out the
presence of the maggots.

10. Walnut husk fly—The lar-
val stage is the most dam-
aging. Larvae attack
mainly walnuts, but occa-
sionally attack late peach
varieties. The adult is a
picture-winged fly. In wal-
nut trees the damage to the
husk results in the staining
of shells and, at times, the
darkening of the kernels.
Bitter, shriveled kernels
may occur.

11. Peach tree borer—The
adult is a clear-winged
moth. The larvae are dam-
aging to peaches, nectar-
ines, and plums. Larvae
have chewing mouthparts.
Their injuries are recog-
nized by jellylike gum
mixed with dirt and small
pellets of frass excreted by
the borers at ground level.
This damage can seriously
injure a tree or even kill it.
Heavily infested trees are
so devitalized that the
leaves turn yellow in a
manner similar to nitrogen
deficiency.

12. Peach twig borer—The

adult is a small, gray moth.
The damaging larvae are
light- to dark-reddish

brown with a black head
and yellow-white, ringlike
segments around the abdo-
men. Larvae have chewing
mouthparts. They attack
developing twigs and bur-
row down the tender
shoots, causing them to
wilt and die. Later broods
attack fruits. The oriental
fruit moth causes similar
damage, but is not as wide-
spread in Idaho.

E. Garden Pests

1. Cutworms—The adult is a miller moth.

The larvae have chewing mouthparts and
are the most damaging stage for garden
produce. Many kinds of cutworms exist

Chapter 10, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

10 - 8

and damage all kinds of
plants. Control with
chemicals when they are
young. The more mature
cutworms are difficult to
control with chemicals. If
cutworms have been a
problem, vigorous
disking or rototilling in
the spring, before plant-
ing, will help destroy

them. Also avoid persistent
weed patches as this is a
good source of cutworms.
2. Wireworms—Have rather

hard, shiny, golden col-
ored, elongated larvae. The
adult stage is a click beetle.
The larval stage is the most
damaging. Wireworms
have chewing mouthparts.
They are a soil pest; their
feeding stunts crops. They
may kill the plant or cause
produce to be inedible. Po-
tatoes and bulb crops are
particularly hard hit by this
pest; however, corn and
other crops may be dam-
aged.

3. Garden symphylan (insect

relative)—These are soil
pests with chewing mouth-
parts; they tend to attack
underground parts of all
vegetables, small fruits,
and many flowers. All
stages of the garden
symphylan are damaging;
infestations are sporadic.
Control of this pest is diffi-
cult for the home gardener.
When the attack is severe,
plants wilt and die.

4. Earwigs—Often merely a nuisance,

though all active
stages cause
damage. Ear-
wigs have
chewing

mouthparts and attack many sorts of
plants. They can be scavengers or preda-
tors also. The best control methods are
various dusts. Apply dust recommended
in your area to soil surfaces when you
first notice the problem. Repeat if neces-
sary.

5. Flea beetles—There are

several species of flea
beetles, all of which have
chewing mouthparts. Both
the larvae and the adults
cause damage. The adults
attack leaves of many veg-
etables. The larvae attack
roots and tubers. The adults
are very tiny beetles and,
like fleas, are good jump-
ers. Use chemical control if
necessary.

6. Aphid—All active stages
cause damage. The peach
aphid is one of the most
important aphids. It affects
not only peaches but also
potatoes. It is a vector of
the potato leaf roll virus,
which discolors tubers. The
asparagus aphid is also be-
coming important.

7. Pea leaf weevil—The adult
is the damaging stage. The
larvae feed on root nodules
of peas. Pea leaf weevils
have chewing mouthparts.
While peas are the pre-
ferred host, this weevil will
attack other plants such as
beans.

8. Colorado potato beetle—
Although mainly a pest of
potatoes, Colorado potato
beetles can feed on tomato,
eggplant, and nightshade
weeds when potatoes aren’t
available. Both the larvae
and the adults are damag-
ing. These beetles have
chewing mouthparts.

Chapter 10, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

10 - 9

9. Asparagus beetle—Rather
small beetles with chewing
mouthparts, asparagus
beetles are steel blue in
color with reddish margins
and a few yellowish spots
on wing covers. Larvae and
adults damage young
shoots, but they are chiefly
a pest of mature plants,
which may be completely
defoliated.

Note: The spotted asparagus beetle is some-

what elongated and red-orange with
black spots.

10. Carrot rust fly—The larvae

have rasping mouthparts.
The larval stage is the dam-
aging one. The adult is a
small, nondescript fly,
while the larvae are small
maggots that burrow into
the crowns or roots of car-
rots, parsnips, and certain
weeds. Only highly organic
or humus soils harbor this
insect. Remove carrots as
soon as possible, since the
damage will increase if
they are left in the ground.
A diazinon application will
reduce, but not eliminate,
the carrot rust fly. How-
ever, mid- to late-June
plantings tend to reduce
damage.

11. Onion maggot—The adult
is a fly. The larval stage is
the most damaging. Larvae
cause damage with their
rasping mouthparts and
create problems similar to
those caused by the cab-

bage maggot, except that
onion maggots attack only
onions, garlic, and shallots.

12. Cabbage maggot—The
adult is a fly. The larval
stage is the most damaging.
The larvae are small, whit-
ish maggots with rasping
mouthparts; they bore into
roots and stems of cabbage,
broccoli, cauliflower,
brussel sprouts, and kale,
often killing them. The
fleshy roots of radish and
turnips may be riddled with
holes. Control consists of
diazinon or chlorpyriphos
(dursban) treatments at the
time of transplant or plant-
ing.

Note: Be careful. Highly organic or humus

soils tend to tie up insecticides such as
diazinon and dursban.

13. Cabbage looper—The adult is a moth.
The larvae have chewing mouthparts.
They attack many cruciferous plants, as
well as fruits, weeds, and ornamentals.
They are defoliators.

F. Household Pests

1. Stored products.

a. Many pests go after stored products.
They include the carpet beetle, ciga-
rette beetle or drugstore beetle, Indian
meal moth, sawtooth grain beetle, and
cockroach. Sanitation is the best con-
trol.

b. Locate the pest sources and clean them
out thoroughly. Destroy infested mate-
rial or heat to 140°F. Vacuum infested
drawers and cupboards.

Chapter 10, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

10 - 10

c. Spray with pyrethrum in and around
possible hiding places, but not on or
around food.

d. Maintain a regular spring cleaning pro-

gram.

2. Structural pests.

a. Termites: These pests are antlike, but

they do not have constricted waists.
They usually attack only damp or rot-
ting wood and are an indica-
tion of an already existing
problem. It is important to
treat these pests properly.
When carpenter ant or subter-
ranean termite infestations
are apparent, it would be wise
to contact a reputable PCO
(exterminator) to kill these
damp wood termites.

b. Ants: The most common ant pests

are carpenter ants.

3. Nuisance pests.

Carpenter ant

a. Flies: Flies are common, especially in

the summer and the fall. Tight seals
around windows and screen doors
help. It also helps to maintain general
cleanliness, as fly larvae can breed in
any kind of refuse. Keep garbage con-
tainers clean. Pyrethrum sprays will
kill the adults.

b. Mites: Many mite species, including
the clover mite, enter homes in large
numbers, causing the inhabitants great
alarm. Some scavenging mites, such as
grain mites, can get into stored foods.
House dust mites can be a source of
allergies.

c. Centipedes and millipedes: Though
centipedes are normally beneficial,
these elongated, multilegged insect
relatives often enter homes and cause
annoyance. Centipedes can inflict
painful bites, while millipedes can be-
come pests in greenhouses.

d. Other: Careful calking, screening, and
patching will prevent many problems
with wasps, bats, and other home in-
vaders. Many true bugs such as
boxelder bug, sage bug, grass bug, and
others will invade homes and other
structures in the late summer and fall.
While they’re capable of biting, the
true bugs normally are considered nui-
sance pests. Several beetles are also
invaders and become severe nuisance
pests. Control is difficult; sweeping or
vacuuming is normally recommended.
These include grass weevils, root wee-
vils, and the elmleaf beetle (overwin-
ters in large numbers in attics).

G. Spiders

Most spiders are harmless. The black widow
is the most dangerous spider in the North-
west. (The brown recluse spider has not
been found in Idaho.) The hobo or “aggres-
sive” house spider is common and can cause
skin sloughing. For more information about
spiders see the University of Idaho College
of Agriculture CIS 414, “Spiders and Their
Relatives.”
Spiders can become numerous in the fall as
they seek out overwintering spots. Be sure
to seal up basement entries (holes, cracks).

Rodents, Birds, and

Other Pests

K. M. Laughlin

Kevin M. Laughlin, Extension Educator, Ada County, Boise

I. Introduction

Some gardeners worry about critters while oth-
ers consider them part of nature’s plan. One
gardener’s wildlife habitat or sanctuary is an-
other gardener’s nightmare or problem.
Over the years you spend tending a garden,
you come to realize there are a few shortcuts to
preventing animal and other pest problems.
Some you need to control; others you learn to
live with; and others you learn to share with
other gardeners.
In all cases, you need to consider personal pest
management objectives, the environment (city
or country) in which you are gardening, your
neighbors, and how treatments will impact the
individual plant as well as the environment.
Proper identification, timing, persistence, and
diversification will play an important role in
successful pest management plans.

II. Safety in Handling

Recently in Idaho, hantavirus has become a
concern for anyone handling vertebrate pests.
Also of concern are several other animal-hu-
man transferred diseases and parasites includ-
ing rabies, plague, lyme disease, and Rocky
Mountain spotted fever.
If you handle equipment and work in areas
where vertebrate pests are a problem, wear or
use masks, gloves, and other protective cloth-
ing when implementing control measures.

III. Identification

Gardeners often become frustrated with the
diverse creatures described in this chapter. Un-
like many garden pests that remain in place or

move around slowly (described in other chap-
ters), these pests are marauders, staging hit-
and-run attacks on desirable plants, yards, and
gardens.
To find acceptable solutions, you must accu-
rately identify the target pest. Most creatures
have predictable needs and activities, and you
may be able to control or deter them by under-
standing their habits.
A. This chapter covers only a few of the most

common pests.

B. Your best source for specific species man-

agement is the Nebraska Cooperative Exten-
sion System’s Prevention and Control of
Wildlife Damage Handbook. This resource
publication covers more than 80 species.

C. You can obtain more information about spe-

cific pests from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, USDA-APHIS Animal Damage
Control Specialists, the Idaho Cooperative
Extension System, or the State of Idaho Fish
and Game Department.

D. It is unlawful in Idaho to gas, poison, shoot,

trap, or otherwise harm any endangered,
wild animal, or wild bird species without
special permits. Hunting seasons, the Migra-
tory Bird Act, and the Eagle Protection Act
regulate other animal harvesting. Before
starting a vertebrate pest management pro-
gram, be sure it is legal. Check with a local
game warden for any local shooting and
trapping limitations.

E. Always read the labels of federal and state

approved pest control products before
implementing control measures. It is illegal
to use any pesticide not listed on a label.

cific rodent species.

or involve folklore repellents. The Coopera-
tive Extension System does not have scien-
tific data to support the use of most, but you
may wish to try them.

IV. Vertebrate Pests—Rodents
A. General Rodent Information

Most methods used in controlling rodents
are aimed at destroying them. Poisoning,
shooting, exclusion, destruction of habitat,
trapping, and fumigating are among the
methods used. Of these, poisoning is the
most popular and probably the most effec-
tive and economical. Because rodent control
is a diverse and complicated subject, it is
beneficial to learn the life cycle of each ro-
dent pest as you encounter it and before
management.
1. “Rodent” is rather all inclusive and per-

haps a bit deceptive, because all ro-
denticides or repellents are not reg-
istered for all species. This requires
accurate identification of the par-
ticular pest and careful selection of
control materials.

2. Rodenticides differ widely in their

These rodents are voracious feeders on
lawns, bulbs, and leafy succulent plants dur-
ing spring and summer. Ground squirrels
(Fig. 1) may dig a burrow system with en-
trances 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) in diameter.
They are particularly troublesome in gar-
dens that border fields or wild lands.
1. The simplest removal method is to fill

burrows with water. Reflooding may be
necessary to keep them discouraged.

2. Also consider live traps (check daily for
relocation), gas bombs (place well back
in the burrow after plugging all en-
trances), and poison baits.

3. Protect bulb beds above ground with a

cover of fine mesh chicken wire.

4. Repel rodents by placing moth balls or
moth flakes in the runs or holes where
they enter buildings.

Fig. 1. Sometimes, the Richardson ground squirrel (from top

to bottom), the 13-lined ground squirrel, vole, and mole
are called gophers.

chemical nature. Strychnine,
indandiones, coumarins (anticoagu-
lants), zinc phosphide, and several oth-
ers are labeled for commercial use. Of
the rodenticides available, the antico-
agulants are safest to use around the
home, provided you follow label
directions and pets don’t acci-
dentally ingest them. This is a
particular concern with cats
that are good “mousers.” Sold
as baits, the animal must ingest
them for several consecutive
days before they are effective.
Several other restricted use ro-
denticides are available for
trained and licensed applica-
tors. Rodent repellents Biomet-
12 naphthylene, paradichlo-
robenzene, polybutanes, poly-
ethylene, R-55 and thiram have

2. Diligently apply taste and smell repel-
lents to the problem areas. Use live or
spring traps or place bait boxes or poison
baits where other animals and children
cannot reach them. Some rats may be-
come bait shy and others may develop an
immunity to anticoagulants, so change
the types and active ingredients of poi-
sons when confronted with extended
problems. Immunity develops over time
and constant exposure to anticoagulants.
It may be necessary to prebait. After
completing sanitation measures, create
bait stations. Place the baits in runways
along a wall or fence where rodents often
travel or places where rats or mice seek
shelter. Check baits frequently to ensure
they are fresh, dry, and free of mold.

3. In orchards, field mice feed on trunks of
trees, rarely burrowing below ground. If
the orchard is mulched, be sure to pull
the mulch back a few feet from tree
trunks in the fall. To deter field mice,
place wire cylinders, tree collars, and
plastic or paper wraps around the base of
fruit trees.

E. Rabbits

Rabbits will girdle young trees, chew off
bark and young twigs of woody plants in
winter, and consume leafy plants during
summer (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Cottontails and jackrabbits can become seri-

ous, year-round pests.

5. Chief natural enemies are foxes, snakes,
hawks, and owls. Dogs and cats also can
work into the control picture.

C. Pocket Gophers and Voles

Pocket gophers burrow through the ground,
feeding on root crops and roots of garden
plants and do surface damage to lawns and
gardens. Voles, as in Fig. 1, primarily do
surface damage to grass areas and may
girdle woody plants.
Gopher runways run parallel to the ground
surface and are located 6 to 10 inches (15 to
25 cm) below ground level. Control is usu-
ally easiest in early spring or fall when fresh
mounds indicate activity.
1. Place poison baits, fumigant type pellets,
or traps in their runs. Locate the burrow
with a long screwdriver or probe. Care-
fully follow the control product or trap
label instructions. If trapping efforts fail,
line the sides of planting holes with light
gauge chicken wire or hardware cloth.

2. Eliminating ground cover reduces popu-
lation. Soil cultivation destroys burrows
and reduces cover.

D. Mice and Rats

Mice or rats can spread disease and viruses,
consume and contaminate stored products,
and may girdle woody plants by chewing
bark (particularly in the winter). Mice eat
seed and grain products and grass, and cre-
ate runways and bare patches on lawns.
Damage to lawns can be severe in winters
when snow covers the ground for months.
1. Sanitation is your first line of defense.
Conduct a general cleaning, eliminate
food sources, and destroy rodent nests.
Get rid of rock piles, old boards, and
junk. Keep piles of wood and lumber up
off the ground. Mow lawns regularly and
remove long grass and vegetation from
adjacent areas. Keep areas around the
base of trees and shrubs free of grass and
loose mulch where mouse damage is a
problem. Store all dried and bagged food
in rodent-proof containers. Proper
composting of kitchen waste is important.
Keep seeds and livestock or pet food in
sealed containers.

Chapter 11, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

11 - 4

1. You can live trap and relocate rabbits.
Reduce the rabbit habitat by removing
overgrowth on ditches, bushy fence rows,
or brush piles within or near garden ar-
eas. Rabbits don’t like to be far from
cover so mowing, brush cutting, and gen-
eral clean up can help control them.
2. Place guards made of fine mesh (1/4

inch) screens around the base of trees to
protect them from rabbit damage. Form
the guards into cylinders about 2 inches
larger than the diameter of the tree trunk
and long enough to protect the tree above
the snow line. Tightly woven (no larger
than 1-inch mesh wire and at least 30
inches high) fences, well anchored to the
ground also work well.

3. Plant “trap” crops like beans away from

the garden to divert rabbits. This may
provide extra food, however, resulting in
more rabbits. Also, onions seem to repel
rabbits, so it may help to interplant an
occasional row with your crops.

4. Also effective are commercial repellents
containing Thiram or Ziaram fungicides
or other materials sprayed or painted on
tree trunks, plants, or shrubs. Blood dust,
nicotine, and other repellents are labeled
for rabbit control.

5. To discourage rabbits, some gardeners
sprinkle dried blood meal around plant
roots or spray a cow manure and water
solution to reduce interest in particular
plants. Others apply powdered rock phos-
phate, powdered aloes, red cayenne pep-
per, or fish tankage with bone meal to
seedlings as they emerge or as a dust on
plants. Some gardeners spray or place
coyote, fox, or other animal urine mix-
tures around garden areas as repellents.

F. Bats

Bats are beneficial insect-eating animals.
Occasionally bats get into buildings or attics
where they foul the area with odorous feces
or guano and disturb the occupants with
their nocturnal activities. Bats can carry ra-
bies. Always vaccinate your pets. Do not
handle bats. If you must handle them, wear
heavy leather or rubber gloves.

1. One or two bats in a house is a problem.
Usually, a bat will find its way out by de-
tecting fresh air movement, so the sim-
plest solution is to open windows or
doors leading outside. Bats have day and
nocturnal roosts that they return to daily.
Each species selects roost sites with spe-
cific temperatures. If the roosting area is
too hot, too cold, or too drafty, they will
leave. A single light bulb in the space
where they roost may keep it too hot for
bats. Another solution is to create a draft
by opening doors and windows and using
an electric fan. To discourage bats from
roosting in one place, scatter 3 to 5
pounds of moth flakes over the floor or
hang them in mesh bags from the rafters.
2. The best time to bat proof a building is in

the fall or winter when bats migrate to
wintering areas. As soon as they leave,
seal the openings in eaves and attic lou-
vers with 1/4-inch mesh, narrowly-
spaced, parallel tight-wires or fishing-line
screen, or boards. Seal narrow cracks
with caulking compounds. If you are bat
proofing a building, be sure all bats are
outside before plugging the last opening.
Not all bats will leave at the same time.
Consider installing a one-way device to
allow bats to leave but not return. Build-
ing bat houses for excluded bats may
help with the problem the next season.

3. Placing floodlights in the attic or direct-
ing them at openings for several nights
will not discourage entry. Instead, the
lights will attract nocturnal insects such
as moths, providing a ready food source
for bats.

V. Vertebrates—Other Mammals

A. Raccoon

Raccoons have become adapted to urban
and suburban areas, feeding at night at “gar-
bage can” restaurants or from pet dishes
(Fig. 3).
1. Raccoons are easy to catch with box

traps. Normal fencing will not keep rac-
coons from your garden; however, elec-
tric fencing is particularly effective.

Chapter 11, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

11 - 5

Fig. 3. Raccoons become especially bothersome near

harvest for corn, melons and other fruit.

Fig. 4. To learn more about controlling deer damage
and deer-resistant plantings, see the various
publications in the “Further Reading” section
at the end of this chapter.

2. Sprinkle black pepper on corn ears before
they are ripe. Installing motion lights and
leaving radios on in the garden at dusk
and dawn may help repel raccoons.

B. Deer

Deer can damage herbaceous and woody
plants by browsing (Fig. 4). Orchard and
vegetable crop damage are a concern, too.
1. Base your landscaping on deer-feeding

preferences to avoid using expensive
chemical repellents. Planting resistant or
less palatable vegetables, annuals, peren-
nials, trees and shrubs in landscapes will
discourage browsing.

2. An inexpensive way to exclude deer is to
construct a wire-mesh fence, 7 to 10 feet
(2 to 2-1/2 m) high, around small gardens
or orchards. A horizontal outrigger—a
fence extension—makes it harder for
deer to jump fences. Some gardeners
have had success with two parallel 5-foot
fences with a 5-foot “no deer” area be-
tween them. In some areas, electric
fences work if constructed with at least
five wires. Tightly strung piano wire in
the Australian fashion of crossbeams
forming an “X” at three heights also
works. Deter deer by placing welded-
wire fencing around individual trees or
plants or types of plants or use other me-
chanical devices such as rigid tubes
(Vexar, Tree Shelters, and Tubex), flex-
ible sleeves, and bud caps.

3. Several commercial repellents are regis-

tered and may be partially successful.
They require repeated applications, par-
ticularly after rains or watering. Spray
contact or taste repellents such as
Thiram, Ziram, and capsaican (derivative
of chili pepper) on the lower trunks of
trees and lower limbs at 2-week intervals.

4. Other methods include sport hunting to

reduce populations; live traps for removal
by conservation officers or professional
biologists; temporary frightening devices
such as gas exploders, tethered dogs, fire-
works, or a radio left on at night; human
hair balls or deodorant soap bars hung at
close intervals around valuable plants or
around the garden; and blood meal, coy-
ote, or other animal urine sprayed or
placed around garden areas as repellents.

C. Skunk

Skunks are protected by law in most states
and frequently are found to carry rabies. If
possible, avoid handling skunks because
they can eject their scent 6 to 10 feet. The
persistent odor on clothing, in gardens, or
buildings is highly offensive (Fig. 5).
1. One method of control is to exclude
skunks from their sleeping or nesting
quarters. Sprinkle a thin layer of flour
around holes or building entrance areas to
form a tracking patch. Examine the area
after dark, when the tracks lead out of the

Chapter 11, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

11 - 6

entrance. Close the space off with lumber
or fencing, or consider live trapping and
relocating the skunk. Leaving a radio on
all day in the skunk’s nesting area may
disturb sleep patterns enough to cause
them to relocate.

2. A chemical known as Neutroleum-Alpha
is probably the most effective odor neu-
tralizer available. A tablespoon in a water
bath works well for pets and humans un-
fortunate enough to be “hit.” Use 2
ounces in each gallon of water to scrub
walls, out buildings, basements, outdoor
furniture, and the like. You also can use
chlorine bleach or household vinegar (di-
luted 1 to 10 parts water) with a little de-
tergent. Tomato juice is not as effective.

D. Dogs and Cats

Male dogs urinate and kill parts of leafy
plants, especially conifers; female dogs’
urine may cause dead patches in a lawn.
Dogs leave feces on lawns or flower beds
and dig in garden beds. Cats can severely
damage bark on young trees where they
sharpen their claws. They dig in garden
soils and leave fecal matter that may trans-
mit parasites or diseases to humans. Cats are
the number one enemy of song birds in the
garden.
1. Controls include fences; scolding; clap-
ping hands; waving brooms; or spraying
the cat or dog with water from a garden
hose. A screen around the tree base will
obstruct cats as will clipping the cat’s
claws. Cats will avoid resting or walking
on walls or fences with moth crystals
sprinkled at regular intervals.

Fig. 5. Skunks are kin to weasels and are not afraid of man.

2. Repellents are almost too numerous to
mention including allyl isothiocyanate,
amyl acetate, anethole, bittrex, bone oil,
capsaican, citrus oil, cresylic acid, euca-
lyptus, geranium oil, lavender oil, lemon-
grass oil, menthol, methyl nonylketone,
methyl salicylate, nicotine, pentanethiol,
pryidine, sassafras oil, and thymol.

VI. Vertebrate Pests—Birds
A. General Bird Information

All birds, in one way or another, are benefi-
cial to man. They can, however, create
problems singly or in groups. Birds are im-
portant in preventing insect outbreaks and
their control of other garden pests benefits
most gardens. Man considers birds pests
when they consume and destroy fruit and
seed crops such as strawberries, sweet cher-
ries, and sunflowers; contaminate foodstuffs
or buildings with their feces; and transmit
diseases directly or indirectly to man, poul-
try, or dairy animals.
1. Avicides registered by the Environmental

Protection Agency (EPA) for specific
species often require prebaiting for sev-
eral days and the quick removal of dead
birds at regular intervals to be effective.
Chemosterilents, birth control agents, and
repellents are also available. There are
three repellent categories: (1) olfactory
(odor), (2) tactile (touch), and (3) gusta-
tory (taste). In the olfactory category,
gardeners have used naphthalene (moth
balls) granules or flakes to repel all do-
mestic animals. Tactile repellents are
made of various gooey combinations of
caster oil, petroleum, or solvents and ap-
plied as thin strips or beads to roosts,
window ledges, and resting areas. Taste
repellents are varied and have multiple
uses. For example, fungicides applied as
seed treatments sometimes inhibit

seed-pulling birds.

2. To protect sprouting

seedlings and maturing
vegetables, floating row
covers are easy to use
and need no supports.
Drape cheesecloth, nylon

VII. Invertebrates and Arthropods
of the Home Yard and Garden
A. Nematodes

Nematodes or eelworms are tiny, unseg-
mented worms that may be as small as
1/125 inch in length. An impermeable cu-
ticle covers and protects them. They survive
during unfavorable periods of cold or heat
in protective egg shells. Accurately identify-
ing this pest and learning its specific life
cycles (eggs may remain viable in cysts for
several years) is the key to proper manage-
ment.
1. Nematodes cause their greatest damage
when soil moisture and temperature are
suitable for germination. They frequently
will pierce roots and feed on them. They
may lay their eggs on roots causing knots
to form. Nematodes can transfer diseases
between plants. A plant attacked by para-
sitic nematodes loses nourishment and
may appear stunted or die. There are a
number of beneficial free living, nonpara-
sitic nematodes associated with root sys-
tems of many plants; therefore, finding
root knots does not always indicate
nematode injury.

2. Control culturally by selecting nematode-
free planting stock or resistant plant vari-
eties. You can kill considerable numbers
of nematodes by soil solarization, flood-
ing the soil for extended periods, or by
permitting the soil to completely dry out.
Maintaining high fertility levels or add-

Fig. 6. Starlings can cause damage because of their

prolific numbers and flocking habits.

netting, or other mesh materials over gar-
den crops or fruit trees susceptible to bird
damage during ripening. Put these up 2 to
3 weeks before ripening. Place screen or
cloth over strawberries and other small
fruits.

3. Commercially designed noisemakers are
partially effective but not very popular in
populated areas. Stakes and flags, con-
tinuous string flagging or netting, spiral
twirlers, shiny propellers, and other ob-
jects that flash in the sunlight, rustle, or
rattle as they spin are useful in small ar-
eas until birds become accustomed to
them.

4. Poisoning is effective but not selective.
Invariably, poisons will kill several song
or protected birds, so it is not recom-
mended.

B. Yellow-Bellied Sap Sucker

A member of the woodpecker family, sap
suckers drill horizontal rows of squarish
holes through the bark of spruce, Scots pine,
birch, nut trees, and Siberean elm. They
feed on sap and sap wood. Hummingbirds
will feed on this sap and, like the sap
sucker, take advantage of the insects at-
tracted to the ooze. Girdled trees may die.
Because sap suckers are a protected species,
it is unlawful to kill them; so wrap the dam-
aged trees in burlap and treat with pruning
paint. Painting a mixture of cayenne pepper
and petroleum jelly on affected areas may
discourage continued damage. Noise makers
also may scare birds away.

C. Starlings

Exclude starlings (Fig. 6) by closing all
openings to less than 1 inch (2.54 cm). Use
boards or metal coverings at 45° angles and
metal prongs or sticky repellents on ledges
or rafters. Attach netting to prevent roosting
on buildings or rafters. PVC strips work
well to cover door openings. Frightening
devices including alarms, distress calls,
lights, and bright objects may work. Repel-
lents to protect ripening fruit and poison
baits also are available.

Chapter 11, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

11 - 8

ing organic amendments (peat, manure,
and green chop) to garden soils decreases
the pest’s impact. Some commercial
preparations of organisms (bacteria,
sporozoa, fungi, viruses, protozoa, preda-
tory nematodes, tardigrades, mites, and
springtails) that prey on nematodes are
available.

3. Crop rotation is perhaps the most inex-

pensive, yet effective way to control
nematodes. Nematode-suppressive plants
such as French marigolds (Tagetes
patula), asparagus, garlic, and onions
have been reported to abate nematodes if
they are planted in blocks and used as
part of a rotation.

4. Orchard floor management through the
use of cover crops in orchards or vine-
yards can have a significant impact on
nematode problems. Sanitation, prevent-
ing the movement of soils or water from
an infested area of the garden, and plant-
ing or harvest dates based on soil tem-
perature with an understanding of nema-
tode life cycles also may help.

5. Gardeners seldom use nematicides unless
they encounter greenhouse or cold frame
problems. Most of today’s chemical
nematicides are soil fumigants, volatile
halogenated hydrocarbons. There are no
nematicidal agents registered for use in
the home garden. If this pest problem oc-
curs, you will need to contact a commer-
cial applicator. To avoid damaging other
plants, the products must be applied be-
fore planting. Chemical applications must
have high vapor pressure to spread
through the soil and successfully contact
nematodes in the water film surrounding
soil particles.
B. Slugs and Snails

These are molluscs, not insects. Both have
soft bodies and secrete a silvery mucus that
appears as trails across the garden. Snails
carry a shell about with them. They spend
the winter in the soil as eggs. Young and
adult slugs often rest in night crawler tun-
nels. They appear in early spring and multi-
ply rapidly under moist conditions. There
are several kinds, but all are similar in ap-

pearance. Their color varies
from white to pale yellow
to lavender-purple to nearly
black with brown spots,
specks, and mottlings. They
have rasping mouthparts.
Slugs are humidity-loving
animals that attack all kinds
of garden and ornamental
plants. They may eat ir-
regular sections or consume
entire leaves. There is only
one generation per year.
1. Culturally control slugs

by eliminating cool,
moist, dark hiding places
(low-growing weeds,
stones, trash, and ground
covers) where slugs seek
daytime shelter. Keeping the garden dry
and plants well spaced can help. Regular
hand picking slugs from plants at night,
maintaining a border of bare soil, and
building copper screens or copper strip
barriers that they cannot crawl over may
also help. Commercial traps are avail-
able. Shallow pans placed at ground level
and filled with stale beer are good home-
made alternatives. Shingles, boards, and
flower pots placed on the ground as hid-
ing places also make good traps; check
traps daily and scrape off and destroy the
slugs. Commercial preparations of diato-
maceous earth can be effective as a pro-
tective barrier if kept dry. Among their
natural enemies are ladybug larvae,
ducks, chickens, snakes, and turtles.

2. You can chemically control slugs by us-

ing molluscicides such as metaldehyde
baits. Note these baits may attract and be
toxic to pets. Improve the bait’s effec-
tiveness by placing it under a protective
cover such as a 5-inch diameter pie pan.
Fresh baits are most effective. Do not al-
low bait to come in contact with edible
parts of plants. Methioacarb (Mesurol) is
the most effective of the insecticides reg-
istered for use against snails and slugs on
ornamentals. Other registered insecticides
include Carbaryl and Mexa-carbate.

Chapter 11, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

11 - 9

3. Do not use salt because it contaminates
soil and kills plants. A solution of one
half household ammonia and one half
water in a spray bottle may destroy slugs
and snails without harming the soil. Keep
the spray solution off leaf surfaces as it
can damage plants; however, it will leave
nontoxic residues.

4. A mulch of oak leaves or tobacco stem

meal will repel slugs and snails. A
drenching of wormwood tea will deter
them. Hellebore has long been used to
keep slugs from grapevines.
C. Earthworms or Nightcrawlers

Earthworms need a moist environment.
They are headless, eyeless, toothless, with-
out antennae, and bisexual (they have both
male and female reproductive organs). Soils
with high worm populations often have high
organic matter levels. Saline soils, sandy
soils, and soils with a pH of 4.5 or lower
usually have few worm problems. Earth-
worms are normally found in the top 6 to 30
inches of the soil. They come to the surface
at night and after heavy rains.
1. Earthworms can grow to 10 inches in

length. Most gardeners feel they are ben-
eficial, but for some their burrowing and
hard casts make a lawn lumpy and diffi-
cult to mow. Earthworms burrow through
soil, feeding on organic matter and dead
leaves or stems at the soil surface. They
decompose thatch, mix organic material
through the soil, and aerate the soil with
their tunneling.

2. Culturally some lawn maintenance pro-
fessionals use heavy lawn rollers in the
spring before the mowing season, or
when problems occur, to level the
ground.

3. No chemicals are registered for earth-

worm control.

I. Introduction to Plant Diseases

Plant pathology or phytopathology is the science
dealing with plant diseases and their control.
Plant pathologists study plant diseases caused by
fungi, bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and parasitic
plants. They also study plant disorders caused by
nutrient imbalances, air pollution, and other unfa-
vorable growing conditions.

A. History of Plant Diseases

Plant diseases have had profound effects on
mankind through the centuries as evidenced
by Biblical references to the blasting and
mildew of plants. The Greek philosopher
Theophrastus (370-286 B.C.) was the first
to describe maladies of trees, cereals, and
legumes that we currently classify as leaf
scorch, rots, scab, and cereal rust. The Ro-
mans were also aware of rust diseases of
their grain crops. They celebrated the holi-
day of Robigalia when sacrifices of reddish-
colored dogs and cattle were made in an at-
tempt to appease the rust god Robigo.
With the invention of the microscope in the
17th century, fungi and bacteria associated
with plants were investigated. In 1665, Rob-
ert Hooke published the first illustration of
rust on a rose leaf. Advances in the study of
diseases were hampered by the widely held
belief in the theory of spontaneous genera-
tion. This theory, held by most people in the
mid-18th century, considered pathogenic or
disease causing microorganisms as products
of disease rather than causes of disease.
Epidemics of late blight of potato devas-
tated Ireland in 1845 and 1846. These epi-

demics dramatized the effect of plant dis-
eases on mankind. Tragically, these epidem-
ics caused famine and death for over a mil-
lion people. Between 1845 and 1860, death
and migration accounted for the loss of
nearly one-third of Ireland’s population.
In 1861, a German botanist, Anton De Bary,
proved that a fungus (Phytophthora
infestans) was the causal agent of late blight
of potato. This was a milestone in the study
of plant diseases since it showed that a fun-
gus was indeed the cause of a plant disease
rather than an organism simply associated
with the disease. Two years later, Louis Pas-
teur proposed his germ theory of disease
that finally disproved the theory of sponta-
neous generation and changed the way mod-
ern science investigated the diseases of all
living organisms.

B. Significance of Plant Diseases in the United

States
A few examples of plant disease epidemics
that have resulted in devastating plant losses
in the United States include: chestnut blight,
introduced in 1904, virtually eliminated
chestnut trees from North America; citrus
canker, introduced in 1910, and a closely
related bacterium called citrus bacterial spot
discovered in 1984, resulted in the destruc-
tion of millions of citrus trees; white pine
blister rust, introduced in 1912, caused large
economic losses in the timber industry; and
Dutch elm disease, introduced in 1930, con-
tinues to destroy large numbers of elm trees
from the East Coast to the Pacific North-
west.

Chapter 12, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

12 - 2

As a direct result of severe disease losses
from imported diseased plant material, plant
quarantine laws were passed by the United
States Congress in 1912. The Agricultural
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
has quarantine inspectors stationed at points
of entry into the country as well as at certain
interstate points to intercept produce likely
to carry new plant pathogens.

II. Disease Concepts

A. What Is a Disease?

There are many ways to define what a plant
disease is. However, simply put, plant dis-
eases involve profound changes within the
host that cause a disruption of normal plant
function. A good working definition of a
healthy plant is one that can carry out its
physiological functions to the best of its ge-
netic ability.
Diseases are among the most important fac-
tors that can significantly diminish growth
and yield, or reduce the usefulness of a plant
or plant product. Healthy or normal plants
develop and function to the maximum of
their genetic potential. However, when
plants are adversely affected by continuous
irritation by a disease-causing agent, which
interferes with normal development and
functioning, plants are considered to be dis-
eased. This broad definition excludes injury
or damage such as mechancial injury (e.g.,
lawn mower or weed-eater injury to trees);
deer, rodent, and bird damage; hail damage;
and lightning injury.
In addition to reduction in growth, yield,
and economic or aesthetic value of a plant
or plant product, diseases may lead to the
death of the whole plant or destruction of
the entire crop under conditions favorable
for the disease. Diseases may interfere with
absorption and translocation of water and
nutrients from the soil to the various parts of
the plant, may reduce the photosynthetic ef-
ficiency of the plant parts, may interrupt the
translocation of photosynthetic products
through the plant, or may interfere with the
reproduction and storage of food reserves in
the plant.

Diseases in plants are caused by either liv-
ing (biotic, parasitic, or infectious) agents
called pathogens, or nonliving (abiotic, non-
parasitic, or noninfectious) environmental
factors. Plant diseases may also be grouped
by the causal agent involved (fungal dis-
eases, bacterial diseases, viral diseases,
nematode diseases, etc.), the plant part af-
fected (root diseases, seedling diseases, leaf
diseases, stem diseases, flower diseases,
fruit diseases, tuber diseases, etc.), or the
types of symptoms (damping-off, wilts, leaf
spots, cankers, blights, galls, root knots, mo-
saics, storage rots, etc.).
B. Symptoms of Diseases

Symptoms are the visible reactions of a
plant to a disease and may suggest a causal
agent. A sampling of disease symptoms
might include wilting, necrosis, abnormal
coloration, defoliation, fruit drop, abnormal
cellular growth, or stunting of the infected
plant. However, it is important to remember
that different disease agents can cause simi-
lar symptoms on the same host. An equally
important point to remember is that insect
feeding can also cause disease-like symp-
toms on plants.

C. Signs of Diseases

Signs are the visible parts of the pathogen or
its products seen on the host that can be
used to identify the pathogen. Examples of
common disease signs include: the white
coating of mycelium visible on powdery
mildew-infected leaves, mushroom growth
on a tree limb, droplets of bacterial ooze
running down a fruit tree twig, nematode
cysts on plant roots, or dark fungal fruiting
bodies visible in leaf lesions.

D. Causal Agents of Disease

A pathogen is any organism that can cause a
disease. Pathogens cause infectious diseases
that can spread from an infected plant to a
healthy plant. Pathogens that cause infec-
tious diseases include bacteria, fungi, vi-
ruses, nematodes, and parasitic plants. Plant
disease can also be caused by noninfectious
or nonliving factors. Causes of disease by
nonliving factors include unfavorable grow-
ing conditions, mineral deficiencies, and air
pollution.

Chapter 12, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

12 - 3

Pathogens that cannot be cultured apart
from their host are classified as obligate
parasites. Pathogens that can be cultured
apart from their hosts on artificial media are
called nonobligate parasites. In general,
obligate parasites only attack very specific
host plants, whereas nonobligate parasites
typically have a wider range of plants they
can infect. Some pathogens are restricted to
a single plant species, while others infect a
single plant genus. Still others attack a large
number of hosts from many plant genera.
There are also several levels of parasitism
that pathogens can have with their hosts.
When a pathogen is capable of infecting a
plant, the plant is considered susceptible to
that pathogen. If a pathogen cannot infect a
plant, then the plant is considered immune
to that pathogen. Plants can vary in their re-
sponse to pathogens from high resistance
(very little disease development), to partial
resistance (moderate disease development),
or high susceptibility (severe disease devel-
opment). Pathogens can vary in their degree
of virulence on a susceptible plant ranging
from highly virulent (causing severe disease
symptoms) to weakly virulent (causing less
disease).

E. Inoculum and Pathogen Dissemination

Inoculum is any part of the pathogen that
can cause infection. Examples of inoculum
include fungal spores, bacterial cells, virus
particles, or nematode eggs. Inoculum that
survives the winter and causes the original
or primary infection in the spring is called
primary inoculum. Secondary inoculum
causes additional infections throughout the
growing season.
Inoculum is sometimes present at the site
where a plant is grown and can also be in-
troduced from an outside source. Inoculum
already present at a plant site includes soil
pathogens or pathogens that overwinter on
perennial weeds. Introduced inoculum in-
cludes infected plant material such as in-
fected seeds, wind-blown fungal spores, and
inoculum transmitted by insects.

Inoculum can be disseminated passively by

wind, rain, and man. Inoculum can also be
disseminated actively by insects and nema-

todes or fungal zoospores swimming
through water in the soil toward plant roots.
Only a fraction of any pathogen’s inoculum
will ever land on a susceptible host. The
vast majority of inoculum lands on material
that cannot be infected. Most pathogens pro-
duce a tremendous surplus of inoculum.

F. Pathogen Survival

Pathogens in temperate climates must have
a way of overwintering when their host
plants are dormant or absent. In perennial
plants, pathogens can survive in infected
plant parts such as roots, bulbs, stems, and
bud scales. Annual plants, however, die at
the end of the growing season and patho-
gens must survive in insects, seeds, or as
resistant spores.

G. Factors Affecting Disease Occurrence

Diseases in plants are an exception rather
than a rule. Three factors, called the disease
triangle (Fig. 1), must coincide for a plant to
become diseased: the host, the pathogen,
and the environment. The interaction be-
tween these three factors with time deter-
mines the occurrence and severity of a dis-
ease. For the disease to occur, the following
conditions must be met:
1 The host plant must be of a susceptible
species or cultivar at the right stage of
development (susceptible host).

2. The pathogen must be of a virulent race

or strain and must be present in sufficient
numbers (inoculum potential). The pres-
ence of appropriate vectors or other
agents of dispersal is also necessary.

3. The environmental (atmospheric and soil)
conditions such as temperature, humidity,
rainfall, wind, moisture, light, soil type,
texture and pH, density of planting, aera-
tion, and nutritional status (mineral defi-
ciency or excess) must be favorable for
disease development.

host, the pathogen, the environment, as
well as their interaction is essential to
implement an effective disease manage-
ment strategy.

III. Diseases Caused by Living (Biotic,

Parasitic, or Infectious) Agents
A. Fungi

Commonly known as molds, fungi (singular
= fungus) are mostly microscopic organisms
that have bodies (mycelium) composed of
multi-cellular, thread-like, branched fila-
ments (hyphae) and reproductive structures
called spores. Since they do not possess
chlorophyll, fungi depend on either dead
organic matter or living plants for their
growth and reproduction. Some fungi pro-
duce vitamins and antibiotics that are useful
to us.
A few fungi, like some types of mushrooms
and morels, are edible. On the other hand,
some fungi thrive on living plants, drawing
their nutrition from them and sometimes
producing toxins that cause disease and
death of the plants they infect. These are
called plant pathogenic fungi.
A majority of diseases in plants are caused
by fungi. Some examples commonly en-
countered in home gardens and landscape
trees are: brown rot of cherries, apple scab,
black spot of rose, snapdragon rust, corn
smut, powdery mildew of rose, peach leaf
curl, sycamore anthracnose, early blight of
potato, Verticillium wilt of tomato, damp-
ing-off, and root rot of vegetables.

B. Bacteria and Phytoplasmas

Bacteria (singular = bacterium) and
phytoplasmas (formerly known as myco-
plasmas or mycoplasma-like organisms) are
microscopic, single-celled organisms that
cause some of the most destructive diseases
in plants. Some bacteria, like those that in-
duce nodulation in leguminous plants, are
beneficial to plants because they fix nitro-
gen from the air into the root nodules in a
form that the host plant can utilize for its
growth.
Phytoplasmas are a type of bacteria that lack
distinct cell walls. Under favorable condi-

tions, bacteria reproduce very rapidly and
can cause serious damage in a short period
of time. Bacterial pathogens are spread by
wind-splashed rain, insects, contaminated
seed, or implements. Bacterial diseases are
relatively difficult to control because there
are very few chemicals that are effective
against them.
Some commonly encountered bacterial dis-
eases are: crown gall of rose, grape, apple,
cherry, and other ornamental plants; fire
blight of apple and pear; soft rot of potato;
ring rot of potato; and aster yellows
phytoplasma on carrots, tomatoes, onions,
lettuce, etc.

C. Viruses

Viruses are infectious agents so small they
must be observed through an electron mi-
croscope. Particles of these viruses may be
in the form of rods, spheres, or threads.
They are composed mainly of a nucleic acid
core surrounded by a protein coat. Viruses
can multiply only in a living host cell and
can often spread systemically throughout
the infected plant.
Viruses can be transmitted from infected to
healthy plants mechanically, through grafts,
and by contaminated propagating material.
Viruses can also be transmitted by certain
organisms, referred to as vectors. In addi-
tion to insects (primarily aphids, white flies,
leafhoppers, and beetles), virus vectors in-
clude mites, nematodes, and fungi in the
soil.
Viral diseases are not controlled by pesti-
cide chemicals. Examples of viral diseases
are: curly top of tomato, bean, cucurbits,
etc.; potato leaf roll; bean common mosaic;
and rose mosaic.

D. Nematodes

Nematodes are microscopic roundworms
that live in soil as well as water, and survive
as eggs or cysts. Most of them are
saprophytes, but some infect living plants
and cause diseases. Most plant parasitic
nematodes feed on the underground parts of
the plants (roots, tubers, bulbs, etc.) causing
lesions or root knots. However, a few nema-
todes also affect the buds, leaves, flowers,
and stems of plants. Nematodes spread

Chapter 12, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

12 - 5

through contaminated planting material (tu-
bers, seedlings, etc.), manure, soil, water,
machinery, and implements. Some nema-
todes are vectors of plant viruses.
Some examples of plant parasitic nematodes
are: root knot nematodes of tomato, potato,
beans, and many other plants; root lesion
nematodes of corn and potatoes, cyst nema-
tode of sugarbeets; stubby root nematode of
corn; stem and bulb nematodes of onion;
and foliar nematode of chrysanthemum.

E. Parasitic Higher (Flowering) Plants

Several flower- and seed-producing plants
live as parasites on other plants (host
plants), deriving their nutrition from them
and adversely affecting the host plant’s
growth and yield. Dodder (also know as
strangleweed and devil’s hair), for example,
parasitizes several garden plants such as po-
tatoes and carrots. It produces orange or yel-
low vine strands that entwine the stems and
other plant parts from which it draws its nu-
trition through tube-like structures it intro-
duces into the host tissue. Dodder produces
abundant seeds that ensure its propagation
and spread. Another example of a parasitic
plant is dwarf mistletoes on pines.

IV. Diseases Caused by Abiotic
(Nonliving, Nonparasitic, or
Noninfectious) Agents

A variety of environmental and cultural factors
can cause diseases in plants. Since these diseases
occur in the absence of pathogens, they do not
spread from a diseased plant to a healthy plant.

A. High or Low Temperatures

When plants or plant parts are exposed to
high temperatures for prolonged periods,
symptoms of scorching or scalding may de-
velop. Some examples are: sunburn or
scorching of leaves and sunscald of fruits
(e.g., apples, tomatoes, peppers, and mel-
ons). Similarly, low temperatures, like frost
or freeze, can damage the exposed or sensi-
tive organs (buds, flowers, young fruits,
etc.) or may kill the entire plant. Examples
include: southwest-side damage to trunks of
apple trees; frost damage to blossoms and
young apple fruits; russet ring (caused by
frost) on apple and pear fruits; winter injury

to trees; and frost damage to tomatoes,
beans, potatoes, etc.

B. High or Low Soil Moisture

Too much moisture due to excessive water-
ing, poor drainage, ponding, or flooding
may cause plants to turn yellow and be
stunted. Potted indoor plants, for example,
may show poor development or root rots.
Seedlings are vulnerable to damping-off
caused by soilborne pathogens under these
conditions.
In some indoor or greenhouse plants (e.g.,
geraniums, begonias) growing under warm,
humid atmospheric conditions and exces-
sive soil moisture, a condition known as
edema (small, wart-like rusty, corky bumps)
can develop on the underside of the leaves,
and on the stems. At the other extreme, low
moisture or drought conditions can lead to
poor development, wilting, and death of
plants.

C. High or Low Light Intensity

High light intensity is usually not a problem
but low light conditions, especially for in-
door plants, can lead to etiolation (spindly
or lanky plant growth with chlorotic yellow
foliage).

D. Lack of Aeration or Low Oxygen Supply

Low aeration can deprive plant roots of ad-
equate oxygen and can adversely affect their
development or even kill the plant. Inad-
equate oxygen supply during the storage of
potato tubers can lead to the development of
a condition called blackheart, the browning
and death of internal tuber tissue.

E. Air Pollution

Certain chemcals, such as ozone, sulfur di-
oxide, and nitrogen dioxide are released into
the air from factories, power plants, and au-
tomobile exhausts. These chemicals can ac-
cumulate in the atmosphere in sufficient
concentration to cause damage to plants.
Ozone damage appears in the form of mot-
tling, chlorosis, spots, and bleaching of
young leaves. This is common in certain re-
gions of the country where there is a high
ozone concentration in smog. For example,
ozone damage is frequently found on the
leaves of beans, petunias, and grapes. Some
of the air pollutants responsible for acid rain

Chapter 12, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

12 - 6

cause damage to vegetation in certain re-
gions. In Idaho, however, plant damage due
to air pollution is not common.

F. Nutrient Deficiencies

Plants require several major (nitrogen, phos-
phorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium,
and sulfur) and minor (iron, boron, copper,
zinc, etc.) elements for normal growth. De-
ficiency or lack of any of these essential nu-
trients results in disease symptoms in the
plant. Specific symptoms depend on the
plant species and the deficient nutrient. If
not corrected, a prolonged acute deficiency
of essential nutrients can lead to death of the
plant.
Common examples of nutrient deficiencies
are: nitrogen deficiency in beans, iron defi-
ciency in peaches, zinc deficiency in apple
trees, and calcium deficiency in apple fruit
(bitter pit). In the home garden, the common
blossom-end rot of tomato fruit is caused, in
part, by calcium deficiency.

G. Mineral Toxicity

Presence of excessive available amounts of
certain minerals in the soil can lead to min-
eral toxicity to the plants. The extent of in-
jury depends on the mineral, its concentra-
tion, and the species of the plant. Excessive
amounts of sodium salts in the soil can lead
to high pH and to alkali injury (e.g., alkali
injury to apple). Plants growing in acidic
soils can be injured by aluminum or manga-
nese toxicity.

H. Unfavorable Soil pH

Although many plants can grow in a rather
wide range of soil pH, plants growing in
soils with unfavorable pH usually show
poor growth and mineral deficiency or tox-
icity symptoms.
For example, iron deficiency symptoms are
very common in plants growing in high pH
soils in Idaho. Under conditions of high soil
pH, iron in the soil becomes unavailable to
the plant, thus inducing interveinal chlorosis
and yellowing of leaves. The plant may die
if the condition remains uncorrected for a
prolonged time.

I. Pesticide Toxicity

Some pesticides, if improperly used, can
cause serious damage to plants. For ex-

ample, if wettable sulfur is sprayed (for
powdery-mildew control) on a very hot day
(above 90°F), it will result in injury to the
plant phytotoxicity). However, the most
common type of chemical injury to plants is
due to soil residues or spray drift of herbi-
cides.
Examples of pesticide toxicity are: 2,4-D
damage to beans and tomatoes, dicamba
(Banvel) damage to vegetables and trees,
and glyphosate (Roundup) damage to fruit
trees. Some herbicides used as soil sterilants
may leave the soil unsuitable for any plant
growth for several years.

J. Improper Cultural Practices

Any cultural practice done in the wrong way
or at the wrong time can result in significant
damage to plants. Injury can result from im-
proper amounts of chemical fertilizer or
pesticide or improper chemical mixes in the
spray tank. Root pruning can result from
excessively deep cultivation; distorted and
twisted roots can result from pot-bound con-
ditions of a plant. African violet leaves
sprinkled with very cold water develop
rings and ring-like patterns that resemble
symptoms caused by some viruses.

V. Diagnosing Plant Disease Problems

A. Why Is Diagnosis Important?

Whether in an effort to save existing plants
or to prevent problems from recurring, it is
important to know “What went wrong?” Di-
agnosis is the process of gathering informa-
tion about a plant problem and determining
the cause. Once the cause has been deter-
mined, it is then possible to recommend a
solution or remedy.
Diagnosing plant problems can involve con-
siderable detective work. Sometimes there
is insufficient information and other times,
the primary cause of a problem is hidden by
more obvious, but less-important, problems.
Success in diagnosing plant problems de-
pends on how much we know about the host
plant, about the plant problems in general,
and the quality of information obtained
from the client.
For example, 10 tomato plants all similarly
damaged, are brought to you. All have yel-

low leaves, stunted growth, and very few
feeder roots. You learn from questioning the
grower that he applied one-half of a 20-
pound bag of 10-10-10 fertilizer to a tomato
plot that measures 60 square feet. The
grower put 10 pounds of fertilizer on 60
square feet, which translates to a rate of 166
pounds per 1,000 square feet. This is almost
10 times the normal rate of 20 pounds per
1,000 square feet of a 10-10-10 fertilizer.
The grower’s fertilization rate is enough to
kill fine feeder roots. The diagnosis is dam-
age to the roots caused by overfertilization.

B. Basic Steps in Reaching a Diagnosis

1. Identify the plant—The better your plant
identification skills the faster you will be
able to diagnose a problem. Most refer-
ences on plant pests and diseases are or-
ganized by plant, so knowing the plant is
the essential first step in using many ref-
erence books.

2. What is normal? Your familiarity with
the normal appearance and cultural re-
quirements of the plant will enable you to
differentiate normal changes from symp-
toms of a problem.

3. What is the problem? To make a disease
diagnosis, you need to know: the pattern
of distribution of the diseased plants or
plant parts, the plant species or cultivar
involved, the site where the plant is
growing (field, orchard, garden, green-
house, inside the house, etc.), and previ-
ous crop history of the site.
For example, uniform damage to many
species in an area, to all plants on one
side of the field or garden, or to all shoots
on one side of the tree indicates that the
cause may be an abiotic factor. Also, if
the damage is well demarcated in a gar-
den or in a plant, it may suggest that
some abiotic factor is involved. On the
other hand, if there is evidence of pro-
gressive spread of the disease from an
initial focus to other plants of the same
cultivar or species or to different parts of
the plant, it may indicate that an infec-
tious agent is involved.

4. Examine the plant and note symptoms

and signs —For a presumptive diagnosis

of diseases in plants, look for the symp-
toms and signs of the disease. The char-
acteristic internal or external alterations
of a plant in response to a disease-caus-
ing agent are called symptoms (leaf spot,
necrosis, blight, canker, wilt, lesion, gall,
witches’ broom, rot, chlorosis, mosaic,
etc.). Sometimes, the pathogen that
causes the disease produces its own
characteristic growth or structures on the
diseased plant that are of diagnostic
value. These are referred to as signs of
the disease (mold, mildew, sclerotia,
mushrooms, conks, etc.).

5. Tentative diagnosis—Based on your

knowledge of the plant and information
from reference books, formulate a tenta-
tive diagnosis. This will help you focus
your examination of the plant and assist
in collecting relevant information.

6. Double-check the diagnosis—Once you

have arrived at a diagnosis, unless it is an
obvious diagnosis, double-check it. Ask
other master gardeners or extension edu-
cators for their opinions. Read through
the reference books about your diagnosis
to make certain everything matches. Ad-
ditional laboratory work may be needed
to confirm your diagnosis.

7. Types of plant disease diagnosis—Verbal
descriptions by a telephone call or evalu-
ation of a sample provide the most com-
mon diagnostic opportunities. However, a
site visit provides more complete infor-
mation.
To make a telephone diagnosis, you must
completely rely on information provided
by the caller in order to make your diag-
nosis. There will be common, familiar
problems, such as powdery mildew of
apples, when a little information easily
leads to a correct diagnosis. In other
cases, it will be very difficult to make a
diagnosis over the telephone and it may
be necessary to evaluate a sample.
Much of your diagnositic work as a mas-
ter gardener will be done with plant
samples. Usually, the sample will provide
the clues necessary to solve the problem.
But when the sample only confirms the

Chapter 12, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

12 - 8

identification of the plant, you must con-
centrate on acquiring information to
reach a diagnosis. Your job will be to
learn about the plant’s cultural and envi-
ronmental conditions, the care the plant
has received, and whether the sample is
representative of the problem affecting
the plant.
A site visit provides the greatest opportu-
nity to gather information, but a success-
ful plant diagnosis also depends on a
combination of factors: your knowledge
of the plant involved, your understanding
of the plant’s basic cultural requirements,
and your recognition of the potential
problems that might affect it. It also de-
pends on your ability to gather informa-
tion, both through observation of the
plant and discussion with the client.

VI. Principles of Plant Disease Contro1

Plant disease control aims at preventing or reduc-
ing the amount of damage or economic loss. Most
plant disease-control measures are aimed at pre-
venting or protecting plants from the disease
rather than curing the plant after it is diseased. By
the time the disease symptoms appear, it is often
too late to reverse the damage caused by the dis-
ease agent. In some cases, acceptable control
measures are not available to halt the disease,
short of plant removal. Correct diagnosis of the
disease is important in order to implement a con-
trol strategy to prevent or reduce the incidence of
the disease in the next crop cycle.
The various controls for diseases can be classified
as exclusion strategies, inoculum reduction meth-
ods, use of disease-resistant cultivars, chemical
control, and biological controls. Integrated dis-
ease-management strategies may utilize any or all
of these methods.

A. Exclusion of the Pathogen

Some destructive plant diseases do not oc-
cur in our country, state, or region. To pre-
vent import and introduction of these patho-
gens national, regional, or state regulations,
known as quarantines, are put into force.
Some examples are the customs and plant
health inspection services at airports and
check points on highways. In addition, na-
tional and state laws regulate the conditions

under which certain crops may be grown
and distributed between states and coun-
tries. We cannot import several types of
plant material from abroad without specific
permission and inspection by the appropri-
ate quarantine authority.
An example of a state quarantine is in rela-
tion to white rot of onion and garlic. White
rot is a very destructive disease of onion and
garlic. Once introduced in the soil, the
pathogen can survive for over 20 years and
there are no satisfactory chemical control
measures. At present, our commercial onion
growing areas in southern Idaho are free
from this disease. Therefore, the State De-
partment of Agriculture in Idaho restricts
the importation of onion and garlic bulbs
and other related plants for planting in
southern Idaho.
Restriction of bean seed from outside of
Idaho prevents the introduction of two seri-
ous bacterial diseases: halo blight and com-
mon blight.
Homeowners can keep some serious plant
pathogens out of their yards and gardens by
planting only certified, disease-free planting
material (seeds, tubers, bulbs, seedlings,
nursery stock, etc.). For example, a home-
owner can avoid several virus diseases and
ring rot of potato by planting certified dis-
ease-free tubers.

B. Eradication or Reduction of the Pathogen

Population
Serious disease damage to a crop or garden
patch can be prevented or reduced by pull-
ing out and destroying the first plant or the
first few plants that show the disease symp-
toms (roguing). This prevents the spread of
the pathogen to other healthy plants (e.g.,
elimination of the first bean plants with mo-
saic symptoms).
Since some of the root-infecting pathogens
remain viable in the soil even after the crop
is harvested, avoid planting the same or
similar susceptible crop in that part of the
garden for the next 2 to 3 years. An appro-
priate crop rotation in the garden is very es-
sential to reduce the damage caused by root
rot and wilt-causing pathogens and nema-
todes (e.g., Fusarium root rot and wilt, Ver-

Chapter 12, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

12 - 9

ticillium wilt, and nematodes on tomato).
Eliminating the infected leaves and diseased
or dead branches, as well as using clean gar-
den tools and similar methods of sanitation,
will prevent the spread and build up of dis-
ease-causing organisms.
Other cultural practices, such as growing
plants on raised beds and using composted
tree bark in the planting medium for con-
tainerized nursery stock, help reduce the
damage caused by certain soilborne patho-
gens (e.g., damping-off, root rots, and
wilts).
Proper irrigation management can prevent
some diseases (e.g., collar rot of apple).
Using the sun’s heat during the summer
months to reduce some of the soilborne
pathogens can be successful in certain re-
gions. In this process, called soil solariza-
tion, the soil is cultivated to a fine texture
and deeply watered.The moist soil is cov-
ered with a clear polyethylene sheet. The
sheet’s edges are buried to create an airtight
environment. The moist soil below the poly-
ethylene mulch heats up and is slowly
“cooked.” Under sunny weather conditions
for at least 4 weeks, this process reduces or
eliminates several soilborne pathogens.
Marigolds interplanted with nematode-
susceptible crops produce substances in the
soil that are toxic to plant parasitic nema-
todes and thereby reduce the nematode
damage to the crop plant.
Controlling insects with insecticides can re-
duce the spread of some of the diseases
caused by viruses that are transmitted by
insects (e.g., potato leaf roll virus spread by
aphids).

C. Use of Disease-Resistant Cultivars

Where available, use of disease-resistant
cultivars is the most cost-effective, safe,
easy, and environmentally desirable option
for the gardener. In fact, for some diseases
(such as curly top of tomato), resistant culti-
vars offer the only practical control option
available. Varieties resistant to one or more
diseases are available in several vegetables
and fruits (e.g., tomato cultivars with resis-

tance to Fusarium wilt, Verticillium wilt,
nematodes, and tomato mosaic virus; and
apple cultivars resistant to fire blight).

D. Chemical Protection of Plant

The most common method of direct protec-
tion of plants against plant pathogens is
through the use of chemicals. Chemicals
used for control of fungal diseases are called
fungicides, those that control bacterial dis-
eases are called bactericides, and those that
control nematodes are called nematicides.
No chemicals at this time are effective
against diseases caused by viruses.
Certain chemicals, used to control soilborne
pathogens, are called fumigants. These are
highly volatile chemicals that are toxic to all
the living organisms (biocides), including
insects, weed seeds, fungi, bacteria, and
nematodes. An example of a soil fumigant
is methyl bromide. Fumigants need extreme
care in handling and application, and there-
fore, can only be used by certified pesticide
applicators.
Based on the mode of action, pesticide
chemicals can be classified as follows:
Protectants: These chemicals, when applied
to the plants, remain on the plant surface
and prevent spore germination and infec-
tion of the plant by the pathogen (e.g.,
sulfur, captan).

Systemics: These chemicals are absorbed by
plants and are translocated to other plant
parts (e.g., Benlate, Ridomil).

Eradicants: These chemicals can eradicate
the pathogen from plant tissue after the
infection has occurred; that is, after the
penetration by and establishment of the
pathogen inside the host tissue (e.g.,
Rally).

Based on the type of chemical (active ingre-
dient), these pesticides can also be classified
as copper compounds, sulfur compounds,
dithiocarbamates, benzimidazoles, antibiot-
ics, etc. Disease-control chemicals can be
applied as seed treatments, foliar sprays,
dusts, fumigants, wound paints, dips, or
through irrigation water (chemigation).
The effectiveness of chemical control mea-
sures is dependent upon our understanding
of the disease cycle, host susceptibility, tim-

Chapter 12, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

12 - 10

ing, mode of application, coverage, and
choice of the appropriate product. Timing of
the application and thorough coverage of
the plant surface are very important for ef-
fective disease control. For best results,
most chemicals are applied before the
pathogen infects the host. Also, most chemi-
cal sprays have to be applied several times
at regular intervals for best disease control.
Always follow the label directions and pre-
cautions. Development of pathogen strains
resistant to chemicals or antibiotics (e.g.,
streptomycin-resistant strains of apple fire
blight pathogen) can lead to these products
becoming ineffective in disease control.

E. Biological Control

The strategy for biological control of plant
diseases involves the use of antagonistic mi-
croorganisms before or after infection takes
place. There has been successful control of
crown gall with strain K84 of Agrobac-
terium radiobacter, which produces an anti-
biotic specific against crown gall bacterium.
Commercial biological control agents are
available as seed treatments and soil amend-
ments to protect plants against soilborne
pathogens.
Currently, the bacteria Bacillus subtilis and
Pseudomonas spp. and the fungi Glio-
cladium virens and Trichoderma spp. are
the organisms with the most applications in
biological control strategies. There is tre-
mendous research interest in developing
new biological tools for plant disease con-
trol, but research-based options are limited
at this time. Genetic engineering of
biocontrol microorganisms has sparked
wider environmental concerns, which will
limit the speed of this new technology’s use
in plant disease control.

F. Integrated Disease Management

An effective, economical, and sustainable
disease management strategy should incor-
porate all the available approaches of a dis-
ease management program. It should in-
clude the relevant preventive and control
measures appropriate for the crop, such as
selection of planting site, selection of the
most adapted and disease-resistant variety,
crop rotation, pathogen-free planting mate-

rial, seed treatment, appropriate planting
date, planting depth and density, irrigation
and fertilizer use, weed control, sanitation,
timely pesticide applications, proper har-
vesting, and handling and storage of the
produce. The integrated disease manage-
ment measures selected should be effective
(should control the disease), economical
(should result in an economic return), and
sustainable (should be environmentally
sound).

I. Introduction

“A weed is a plant that interferes with
the management objectives for a given
area of land at a given point in time.”

J. M. Torell
A weed is any plant that is growing where it is
not wanted and is more competitive than the
surrounding desirable plants. Time, energy,
and money for weed control can be kept to a
minimum by planning carefully and choosing
wisely in practices and materials. Effective
weed management involves learning about the
weed, understanding the particular site and
situation, and employing a diversity of prac-
tices to provide desirable results.

Weeds are not only unsightly but also compete

with desirable plants for nutrients, water, sun-
light, and space. In addition to competing with
landscape and vegetable plants, some weeds
secrete toxins into the soil which, much like
herbicides, damage or inhibit growth of desir-
able plants. Weeds can ruin lawns, gardens,
and flower beds. In some situations, weeds can
be such a problem that the only practical weed
control is to destroy the entire planting.

Weeds can also provide a “bridge” for insects and

diseases from one growing season to another.
When weeds are present, additional applications
of insecticides and fungicides may be required.
Weeds have contributed to several other prob-

lems in the home landscape environment. Field
bindweed, for example, can grow through as-
phalt causing premature failure of driveways
and streets. Weeds contribute to health prob-
lems such as hay fever, respiratory problems,
and skin irritations. Some weeds puncture bike

tires and injure bare feet. Pets also are affected
by weeds. Weed seeds may enter their nostrils
and ears causing irritation and infections; weed
seeds may become enmeshed in their fur caus-
ing discomfort. Often times a veterinarian is
needed to remove the seed.

Most homeowners are concerned with weeds that

exist near their homes because weeds are a
general nuisance, mar the natural beauty of a
home site, and decrease the value or market-
ability of residential properties. Weeds contrib-
ute to fire and safety hazards and reduce prop-
erty values.

Landscapes and yards overgrown with weeds
serve as a reservoir of weed seed that can
spread to neighboring yards. As a result, some
municipalities have ordinances requiring own-
ers to cut down overgrown, weedy lots. A few
imported weeds are so invasive and expensive
to control that they have been declared noxious
and therefore illegal to grow or go to seed.

Although seeds are generally thought of as unin-
vited guests, weeds do have some limited ben-
eficial characteristics. Weeds can be a source
of feed for domestic animals and wildlife, can
help prevent erosion, and can add organic mat-
ter to the soil.

II. Weed Biology and Classification

The classification of weeds is achieved by
grouping together those weeds whose similari-
ties are greater than their differences. For pre-
ciseness, weeds are grouped botanically by
family, genus, species, and variety. For conve-
nience, weeds are commonly classified in cat-
egories such as terrestrial and aquatic, or
woody and herbaceous.

Chapter 13, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

13 - 2

Weds also are classified as trees, shrubs,
grasses, sedges, and ferns. Weeds are also
commonly grouped according to similar life
cycles, that is the cycle of life from viable seed
to mature plant and the cycle of viable seed
formation to death of plants. On this basis,
weeds are grouped as annuals, biennials, and
perennials.
A. Annual Weeds

These complete a life cycle in one year. An-
nuals germinate from seed, emerge, grow,
flower, set seed, mature and die in one
growing season. Annual weeds depend upon
the production of large numbers of viable
seeds for long term survival. Many success-
ful weed species produce thousands of seeds
per plant (Table 1). In addition, weed seed
has varying levels of dormancy that contrib-
ute to its persistence (Table 2). This charac-
teristic gives weeds the ability to germinate
over a period of many years.
1. Annuals that complete a life cycle during
the period from spring to fall are referred
to as summer annuals. The majority of
weeds that are found in the garden or in
new lawns and landscapes are summer
annuals. Examples of summer annual
weeds commonly found in yards include
different pigweeds, common lambsquar-
ters, hairy nightshade, common purslane,

Research, Vol. 29, No. 7, pp. 349-362.

prostrate spurge, prostrate knotweed,
green and yellow foxtail, barnyardgrass,
and crabgrass.

2. Annuals that germinate and emerge in the

fall, lie dormant during the winter, re-
sume growing in the spring until matu-
rity, and die in the late spring or early
summer are referred to as winter annuals.
Some of the most troublesome winter an-
nual weeds are annual bluegrass, downy
brome, and a number of mustards such as
shepherd’s purse and flixweed.

B. Biennial Weeds

Biennials require two growing seasons to
complete their life cycle. Biennials germi-
nate, emerge, and usually form a rosette
(radial cluster of leaves lying close to the
ground) the first year. During the second
year, the plant bolts (produces a flower
stalk), flowers, sets seed, matures, and dies.
Biennial weeds are not as prevalent as an-
nual weeds in gardens; but they may appear
along property borders, in ground covers,
and within perennial planting. Biennials
that are commonly found in a home gar-
den-landscape site include: sweet clover,
common burdock, common mullein, bull
thistle, and Queen Anne’s lace.

C. Perennial Weeds

These live 3 years or more and reproduce
sexually (from seed) and asexually (from
vegetative growth). They may or may not
flower the first year. Perennials that repro-
duce from seed are identical to annuals and
biennials in the seedling stage and thus are
most susceptible to control when they are
young. Within a few weeks or months,
however, perennials develop vegetative
reproductive organs, giving them the abil-
ity to propagate and spread asexually. It is
this characteristic that makes perennials so
difficult to control. Perennials are classified
into three different categories based upon
how they reproduce.
1. Simple perennials have either a large tap
root such as a dandelion or a fibrous root
system such as bunchgrass. Simple pe-
rennials propagate mostly by seed, but if
the roots are broken into pieces, each
piece is capable of reproducing new plants.

Chapter 13, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

13 - 3

2. Creeping perennials reproduce by rhi-

zomes (stems) or creeping roots as well as
by seed. Quackgrass and field bindweed
are good examples.

3. Bulbous perennials reproduce by bulb or

nutlike structures and by seeds as well.
Purple nutsedge and bulbous bluegrass are
examples of a bulbous perennials.

III. Identification

Identification of a weed should be the first step
taken in a successful control program. Suc-
cessful identification of weed species requires
that a sample, with as much of the plant as
possible, be intact. This includes flowers,
stems, leaves, and roots. Careful examination
of various plant structures should be used in
the identification process to distinguish be-
tween “look-a-likes.” A knowledge of where
and how the weed was growing also will help in
identifying which control measures can be used.
A. Flower

This is the structure most commonly used in
classifying and identifying plants. However,
weed control measures often must be imple-
mented before flowering. When flowers are
present, note the arrangement on the stem,
their size, shape, color, the presence or ab-
sence of various flower parts, and number
of petals. These are all important factors in
determining the particular family in which a
plant is classified. If the plant has set seed,
note characteristics such as size, shape, type
of fruit, capsules, pods, burs, hardness, and
structure.

B. Leaves and Stem

Weeds also can be identified through care-
ful examination of leaves and stem. Stem
woodiness, cross section, and the presence
or absence of leaves on the stem should be
observed. Stem woodiness is classified as
herbaceous (a stem that is not woody),
semi-woody, and woody ( a perennial stem
that is entirely woody such as found in a
tree). Cross section of the stem refers to the
shape of the stem and is often closely tied to
leaf arrangement and leaf shape. Stems may
be oval, round, triangular, ridged, square,
winged, or grooved. Flowering stem leaves
may be absent (dandelion) to uniformly leafy.

Leaf arrangement, type, presence or absence
of stipules, petioles, and tendrils, venation,
length, shape, surface, and succulence are
all important clues for identifying weeds.

D. Roots

All the below ground plant parts can also
provide information on the plant. Pull or dig
up some of the root system and below-
ground plant parts. Determine whether it has
a fibrous or tap root system and look for
bulbs, corms, tubers, or rhizomes.
Identification of the weed before imple-
menting control practices is important but
requires more extensive knowledge than
what has been covered in this section.
Weeds of the West, Weeds of Nebraska and
the Great Plains, and Weeds 2.0 for Identifi-
cation of Weeds of the Western United
States are several excellent identification
references available to help identify weeds.
County Extension educators and the UI De-
partment of Plant, Soil and Entomological
Sciences also are available to assist in iden-
tification of problem weeds and to provide
suggestions for their control.

IV. Weed Control Methods

Once the weed is identified and biology of the
plant is understood, control measures can be
considered. “Silver bullets” and “one-shot con-
trol programs” that will control weeds without
harming nontarget plants are very rare or non-
existent. An integrated approach to weed con-
trol is the most efficient and environmentally
safe approach. An integrated approach also
uses a combination of cultural, mechanical,
physical, and chemical techniques to bring
weed populations to an acceptable level. Six
methods available to the homeowner include
prevention, biological, cultural, mulches, me-
chanical, and chemical.
A. Prevention

Is the most effective, least costly weed con-
trol strategy. Avoid the introduction of weed
problems through careful examination of
materials that will be used in developing the
home landscape or garden.
1. Carefully examine the label on packaged

seed and bulk seed. Avoid buying seed

Chapter 13, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

13 - 4

containing weed seed. If noxious weed
seed is present, return the seed to the sup-
plier and ask for your money back. It is
against the law to sell and propagate nox-
ious weeds. Some seed catalog compa-
nies sell “wildflower” mixes that may
contain noxious weed seed. The scientific
names found in the catalog description
and on the seed packet should be com-
pared to the list of noxious weeds listed
at the end of this chapter. Report the
problem to your county weed supervisor
who will contact the Idaho Department of
Agriculture to lodge a complaint against
the company.

2. Inspect nursery plants and transplants be-
fore purchase to avoid introducing roots,
rhizomes, or stolons of perennial weeds.
Buy your plants from a reliable nursery
that sells only weed-free plants.

3. Avoid introducing weed seeds, roots, rhi-
zomes, stolons, and bulbs into the garden
and flower beds by using weed-free
straw, manure, mulch, compost, and soil.
Unless these amendments have been ster-
ilized, they probably contain weed seed.
Know the source of these amendments
before transporting them to your yard.
Selecting sources with relatively low
weed populations and avoiding sources
with undesirable weed species will pay
off in the long run.

4. Tillage equipment can easily spread un-
wanted weeds to relatively weed-free ar-
eas. Clean garden tractors, tillers, hand
tools, and other equipment to remove
soil, weed seeds, and plant parts.
Irrigation water that flows through canals
and streams can transport weed seed to
your yard. Screen irrigation water from
surface sources.
“One year’s seed, seven years of weeds.”
Control vegetative and seed sources
around the yard and garden. Destroy
weeds before they become established,
set seed, and mature.

B. Biological Control

This type of control uses other organisms to
control weeds. This is not a very practical
solution to many weed problems found in

urban home horticultural settings, but may
find some use on small acreages. Geese can
be used to remove actively growing weeds
in dormant strawberries, asparagus, pepper-
mint, cane berries, and trees. Hogs will seek
out fleshy-rooted weeds in fallow. Sheep
and goats can control many weed and brush
species in pastures. Insects and diseases also
can be used to suppress or kill specific
weeds; however, this type of control gener-
ally lags behind weed populations. Many
gardening enthusiasts have been disap-
pointed in the use of insects and diseases to
control weeds.

C. Cultural Control

These practices have been found to be effec-
tive and cost efficient in a home horticul-
tural setting. Integrating cultural control
components with other control measures
minimizes the impact of weeds on desirable
plants, yet provides acceptable control.
1. Select competitive plants. Use plant com-
petition to minimize weed establishment,
growth, and reproduction. A vigorously
growing ground cover that is more com-
petitive than the weeds will lessen the
weed problem. Generally, weeds are
more competitive than the garden crop
species during early development. Weed
competition during the first 3 to 4 weeks
after the garden emerges will have the
greatest affect on the garden yield. Vigor-
ously growing garden crops develop
canopies that shade weeds, suppress
weed germination, and hinder growth.
Garden crops that are slow growing and
less competitive should be transplanted.
Table 3 shows when selected garden
crops are most sensitive to weed competi-
tion.

2. Anything that would encourage vigorous
growth of desirable garden plants to com-
pete with weeds should be implemented.
Provide moisture to desirable plant roots,
using a method that will reduce or elimi-
nate the moisture to weeds. Rotate crops
to break the natural cycle of weeds, in-
sects, and disease. A rotation may include
fallowing or omitting crop production for
one or more years. Growing different

types of plants in the area each year may
also be effective. Plant winter cover or
competitive plants rather than leaving
soil bare.

3. Alter planting dates. Delay planting until
after the first flush of weeds has emerged,
then use cultivation to remove small
weeds. Plant for optimum growth of de-
sired plants while avoiding growing con-
ditions conducive to weed germination
and growth. Seeding lawns in late sum-
mer and early fall is a good example of
this method.
Place and time fertilizer applications to
maximize plant growth by banding fertil-
izer applications. Banding or sidedressing
fertilizers near desirable plants promotes
optimum crop growth while placing nu-
trients in a less-available position to
weeds growing between the rows.

D. Mulches

These are an extremely effective weed-con-
trol tool in the garden and around the home
landscape. Mulches are soil coverings such
as plastic or straw that prevent sunlight from
reaching the soil. A mulch conserves mois-
ture and modifies the microclimate and soil
temperature around the plant Mulches are
categorized as natural or artificial: natural

mulches are effective in eliminating annual
weeds and reducing the competitiveness of
perennial weeds; artificial mulches are ef-
fective in controlling both annual and peren-
nial weeds.
1. Natural mulches are applied 2 to 4 inches

deep after weeds are removed through
cultivation or with an herbicide. They are
composed of materials such as bark,
grass clippings, leaves, compost, manure,
sawdust, wood chips, straw, hay, crushed
corn cob, and pine needles. Most natural
mulches are considered waste products
and are often disposed of in landfills.
Many of these mulching materials are
free of charge. A visit to your local tree-
care expert or gardening store may pro-
vide a source.
As with other materials used in the home
landscape, the homeowner should exam-
ine and avoid mulch material with weed
seeds and live vegetative plant parts ca-
pable of establishing new weed infesta-
tions. The life expectancy of natural
mulch will vary from 1 to 3 years de-
pending on the material used, depth of
material, and management associated
with the landscape or garden.
Live mulches such as grasses and le-
gumes sometimes are used between pe-
rennial plant rows. These live mulches
are grown to a predetermined stage,
killed, and allowed to remain in place to
decompose over time. In the garden,
natural mulches such as straw can be
used in planting of asparagus, cabbage,
carrots, cauliflower, lettuce, peas, pota-
toes, turnips, and other cool season crops
to reduce weed competition while main-
taining cool soil temperatures.

2. Artificial mulches include plastic, polyes-
ter landscape cloth, and sometimes news-
paper and tar paper. When artificial
mulches are used in a landscape applica-
tion, natural mulches are applied 1-inch
deep on top. The natural mulch hides the
artificial mulch and protects it from solar
degradation. Polyester landscape cloth
should be used in landscape applications
rather than plastic or tar paper. Polyester

Chapter 13, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

13 - 6

landscape cloth allows air exchange and
moisture percolation through the mulch
to the root zone. Natural mulches will
stay put on polyester landscape cloth but
will have a tendency to slide off plastic.
In vegetable garden applications, black
plastic is the preferred artificial mulch. It
increases the rate at which soils warm
during the growing season and it modi-
fies the microclimate for improved
growth rates of warm season vegetables
such as tomato, muskmelon, watermelon,
cucumber, and squash. Black plastic is
relatively inexpensive and easy to handle.
When black plastic is used, irrigation ap-
plications need to be modified from sur-
face or sprinkler applied to drip applica-
tions below the plastic. Other colored
plastics may enter the commercial market
place in the future. Colored plastic
mulches such as red has increased tomato
yields by 10 to 15 percent over black
plastic mulch.
Newsprint also can be used in the garden
and can be very effective in reducing
weed problems. Newspapers can be
turned into the soil at the end of the sea-
son unlike black plastic which must be
taken up before cultivation. Tar paper can
be used to mulch around trees and shrubs,
but it is more difficult to apply and is
rarely used.

3. A process that has become more popular
in recent years is solarization. Solariza-
tion uses the sun’s energy to raise soil
temperatures high enough to kill weeds
including seeds, roots, and rhizomes as
well as many soil organisms. Solarization
is accomplished by laying and anchoring
the edges of a sheet of clear plastic over
the entire fallowed area to be treated. The
soil should be moist to conduct and hold
heat, to stimulate weed seed germination,
and to prevent dormancy of below-
ground vegetative plant parts. The soil
should be firm to conduct heat as deeply
as possible.
Maximum weed kill depends upon the
amount of bright, sunny weather and
weed species. The longest day of the year

and most direct solar radiation occurs at
vernal equinox, June 21. Plastic should
be in position by June 1 and left in place
for about 2 months. If precipitation is
more than 20 inches per year, solarization
may need to be extended into midsummer
and may be less satisfactory in such ar-
eas.
Late winter and early spring solarization
may reduce weed populations before
planting, but it is not as effective as late
spring and summer solarization. How-
ever, the entire growing season is not lost
with this type of solarization. The process
for accomplishing this type of solariza-
tion is as follows:
a. Till the garden soil and prepare the

seedbed in autumn.

b. Place clear plastic over the garden in

midwinter or soon after snow melt. So-
lar heat will warm the soil under the
plastic whenever the days are warm
and sunny, causing seeds to germinate.
Sprouted weeds will die as daytime
temperatures under the plastic rise to
temperatures of 100°F to 130°F which
should be high enough to kill most
species. Weeds may also die from
freezing.

c. Leave plastic in place and continue so-
larization until planting time. Because
tilling the soil after removing the plas-
tic brings more weed seeds near the
soil surface, plant without further till-
age.

E. Mechanical Control

Includes hoeing, pulling, rototilling, mow-
ing, cultivating, and burning. Mechanical
methods are best adapted to eliminating an-
nual weeds depending on the species, the
particular location, and the type of imple-
ment used. Seedling biennial and perennial
weeds also can be controlled mechanically.
Once the perennial weed is able to vegeta-
tively reproduce, mechanical control is not
very effective. Mechanical methods such as
hoeing, mowing, and cultivating cut the
plant off at or just below the surface leaving
the root or rhizome behind to send up new
growth. Deeper tillage such as rototilling or

Chapter 13, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

13 - 7

deep plowing may bring some of the roots
or rhizomes to the surface, but even if a
small root segment or rhizome remains in
moist soil, the weed can establish itself
again.
In some instances mechanical control can
spread weeds to infest new areas. Effective
mechanical control of perennial weeds will
require cultivation every 14 to 21 days. This
repeated cultivation over 2 to 3 years stimu-
lates root development while depleting
stored food (carbohydrates) and eventually
the plant dies.
1. Hoeing cuts the plant at or just below the
soil surface. Hoes should be kept sharp to
reduce the effort of controlling weeds.
Often times gardeners will use the hoe to
dig or aerate the soil. This is an improper
use of this tool. Use a shovel or rototiller
to aerate soil. Deep cultivation has a ten-
dency to bring weed seed to the soil’s
surface providing an excellent environ-
ment for weed seed germination. Deep
hoeing or tillage in the garden also can
damage desirable plants. A proper hoeing
technique disturbs the soil very little
while removing the weed. Many different
hoe styles are available.

2. A hand cultivator or tractor-mounted cul-

tivator generally consists of v-shaped
teeth which is used to till soil 1 to 2
inches deep. The action of this tool is
similar to the hoe, that is it cuts the weed
off at or just below the soil surface and
drags the small weed root to the soil sur-
face to dry. Other implements such as
disk harrows, sweeps, rolling cultivators,
and finger weeders are in this same cat-
egory.

3. Mowing is an effective way of reducing
the amount of seed that weeds will pro-
duce and eliminating annuals. The prac-
tice must be timed to remove the top be-
fore seed is produced. Mowing after vi-
able seed has set can be a good way of
spreading weeds to new areas. The vigor
and stand density of established perennial
weeds can be reduced through repeated
mowing, although it requires a long pe-
riod of time.

4. Hand weeding is effective but is a labor-

intensive method of removing weeds
growing close to desirable plants. Care
must be taken that the pulling of the weed
does not damage the roots of desirable
plants.

5. Burning or flaming weeds is generally

done with a propane torch. Timing of the
operation must be such that control is
performed before viable seed set. The
most effective control of annual weeds is
when they are small (about 3 to 5 inches
tall). The effect of burning perennial
weeds is similar to that of mowing.
Consider carefully where and when this
method is used, since it is more difficult
to control in tall dry weeds than previous
methods outlined. There have been cases
in which out-of-control burning opera-
tions have burned a straw pile, barn, or
home. Check with local ordinances and
regulations before burning perennial
weeds.

F. Chemical Control

This method can save labor while providing
acceptable control. When used correctly,
chemical control can be an inexpensive
weed control tool. However, it does have
some drawbacks. Herbicides can injure or
kill desirable plants and are expensive if
used improperly.
Extension educators are often asked to in-
vestigate injured or dying trees, shrubs, and
other desirable landscape or garden plants
that “the neighbor sprayed” only to find out
that the gardener used herbicide inconsistent
with the label’s instructions.
Thoroughly read the label of any herbicide.
Be sure the beneficial plant to be protected
is listed on the label. Timing of the herbi-
cide applications must follow the label in-
structions. Even an application of 2,4-D for
control of weeds in lawns can injure grass if
applied during the heat of the summer. Al-
ways read and follow label directions!
1. Herbicides usually are not used in veg-

etable gardens for several reasons:
• No single herbicide can be used safely

on all vegetables grown in a garden;

Chapter 13, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

13 - 8

• Some herbicides can persist in the soil

and injure sensitive vegetable crops
the following year;

• Spray drift can injure sensitive plants

growing in the garden.

2. Herbicides are grouped into families

based on chemical properties and how the
chemical works to kill the plant. Herbi-
cides also are grouped by when they are
applied to control weeds.
Preemergence herbicides are applied be-
fore the emergence of the weed or crop.
Herbicides in this group kill weeds as
they germinate. These herbicides are fur-
ther classified as preplant and postplant
preemergence herbicides. Preplant herbi-
cides are applied to the soil before plant-
ing the desired crop and before the weeds
germinate. Postplant herbicides are ap-
plied after the desired crop has been
planted but before the weeds or crop have
germinated.
Generally, preemergence herbicides are
applied to the surface of the soil and ei-
ther watered in (precipitation or irriga-
tion) or mechanically incorporated into
the soil. Failure of these herbicides to
work may be the result of poor incorpora-
tion because weeds are already germi-
nated.
Postemergence herbicides are designed to
kill emerged weeds. These herbicides
may be translocated (e.g., 2,4-D) or may
be contact herbicides (e.g., paraquat).
Translocated herbicides are applied to
foliage or soil. Plants absorb the herbi-
cide through leaves, stems, or roots; and
move it through the plant to the site of
herbicidal action (where the herbicide
works). Translocated herbicides work
well on perennial plants because the her-
bicide is moved to roots and other below-
ground vegetative reproductive parts.
Contact herbicides are applied to the foli-
age of the plant. These herbicides kill
only where they directly contact the plant
and do not move within the plant. Con-
tact herbicides are a poor choice for the
control of perennial weeds.

3. Herbicides are further classified as selec-

tive and nonselective. If the herbicide
kills the weed but does not injure the ben-
eficial plant, then the herbicide is termed
selective. If the herbicide injures or kills
the weed and beneficial plant, then the
herbicide is known as nonselective.
Herbicides should only be used according
to label directions. Registered uses and
rates of application are listed on the prod-
uct label. Improper use or application rate
can cause injury or death to nontarget
plants even though the product is selec-
tive. Selectivity of an herbicide may de-
pend on any one or a combination of the
following factors:
a. Some plants may be able to detoxify

the herbicide by metabolizing it into a
harmless substance while other plants
are killed.

b. Foliar-applied herbicides may not be
absorbed by leaves or stems because
various structures (such as pubescence,
and thick way cuticles) block the ab-
sorption of the herbicide.

c. Selectivity of a herbicide may also be
due to its placement in the soil. Herbi-
cides such as Casoron, when applied
correctly by shallow incorporation,
will kill germinating weeds and shal-
low-rooted weeds. Deep-rooted desir-
able perennial plants will not absorb
the herbicide because the herbicide is
placed above the root zone.

4. Soil sterilants are applied to the soil to
prevent the growth of weeds and other
plants. Some sterilants may be applied to
foliage with desired results, but they will
leave a long-lasting residue in the soil.
The length of time that a sterilant will be
effective depends on the rate applied and
the persistence of the herbicide.
Extreme care should be taken when using
soil sterilants. Some of these products
have a tendency to move with water and
can easily be leached from the point of
application to root zones of beneficial
plants (trees, shrubs, and grass) thus in-
juring nontarget plants. Soil sterilants are
not suggested for use in the yard or gar-

Chapter 13, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

13 - 9

den because they are long lasting and dif-
ficult to remove if the homeowner de-
cides to change the use of the treated
area.
Fumigants are nonselective and can kill
seed and plant parts below the soil sur-
face. Fumigants are not readily available
and are only used in greenhouse or com-
mercial operations.

5. Herbicides must undergo a series of tests
before the labeling of the product for use
by the gardener. These tests evaluate the
fate of the herbicide in the environment
and potential hazards to the user and non-
target organisms. Determining the fate of
the herbicides in the environment include
how they degrade, how herbicides move
with water (leach), how they bind with
soil, how quickly they volatilize and drift,
and how toxic they are to fish or other
nontarget organisms. The label contains
most of this information as well as direc-
tions for use. Impact to the environment
can be minimized by following all of the
label instructions and environmental
warning statements.
Additional information specific to the be-
havior of herbicides in plants and soils,
use precautions, toxicological properties,
and herbicidal use can be obtained from
your Extension educator.

V. Herbicide Application Equipment

Several types of application equipment are
suitable for weed control. Application equip-
ment ranges in price from inexpensive canister
plastic sprayers to elaborate and expensive
power sprayers pulled by garden tractors. The
most important consideration is to find suitable
equipment for the particular job or situation.
Choose dependable equipment that will have a
long service life and will do the type of job
you need. Types of application equipment in-
clude:
A. Hand Spray Bottles

Several home and garden herbicides are
now packaged in a ready-to-use, disposable
applicator spray bottles, much like common
glass and window cleaners. They are meant
to be used for spot treating small areas or
individual weeds.

B. Hose-End Sprayers

These sprayers attach to the end of a garden
hose and may be acceptable for soil
drenches and preemergence herbicides with
a wide margin of safety. Because they are
difficult to calibrate and too variable for
proper application, hose-end sprayers are
not recommended for most herbicides where
precision of application is desired.
C. Compressed Air Canister Sprayers

The most common sprayers used by home-
owners are 1- to 3-gallon compressed air
sprayers. There are metal and plastic mod-
els. Both are equally effective, but the plas-
tic model is less expensive. A compressed
air sprayer is ideal for spot spraying
postemergence herbicides and will provide a
reasonably precise application of preemer-
gence herbicides. Problems encountered
through the use of this sprayer include
nozzle plugging and spray tank corrosion
(this is not a problem with plastic or stain-
less steel sprayers).
Compressed air sprayers do present a safety
problem if the pressure in the tank is not
equalized with the outside pressure before
opening the tank to refill or clean. However,
some manufacturers now include a pressure
relief valve that eliminates this hazard.

D. Backpack Sprayers

Several models of backpack sprayers are
available. These are usually more expen-
sive; but they are versatile, have up to a
5-gallon capacity, and can be maintained at
more uniform pressure than canister spray-
ers. These sprayers are constructed of plas-
tic or stainless steel, but the inexpensive
plastic models are preferred. One of the few
disadvantages associated with a backpack
sprayer is the tendency for the applicator to
leak and then soak the wearer’s back with
herbicide.

E. Power Sprayers

These sprayers are a good investment and
ideal for large areas. These sprayers have a
pump and regulator to provide constant
pressure and a more uniform spray delivery.
The spray tank may consist of plastic, fiber-
glass, stainless steel, galvanized steel, or ep-
oxy-lined steel. These systems usually have

Chapter 13, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

13 - 10

a gun-type nozzle for spot treatments and
sometimes a boom for broadcast applica-
tions. The disadvantages of power sprayers
are similar to those of the backpack sprayers
and pressurized canister sprayers.

F. Wick-Wipers

Various makes and models of “wiper” appli-
cators are available, primarily for use in ap-
plying a 33 percent solution of glyphosate.
Wick-wipers allow accurate placement of
herbicide on unwanted plants and avoid
problems with spray drift.

G. Granular Applicators

These applicators spread granular herbicide
formulations of and fertilizers. Two general
types of granular applicators are available to
homeowners:
1. The gravity, or drop-type applicator, is
best used on level turf areas or on level
areas where the soil has been firmed. Use
of this type of applicator on a steep hill or
loose soil conditions will result in non-
uniform applications.

2. The cyclone or whirlybird will operate

under almost any type of condition but is
affected by wind and tall vegetation.

Note: It is best not to use the same sprayer

for both insect and weed control. Some
herbicides, such as 2,4-D, are difficult
to completely remove from sprayers. If
you do decide to use the same sprayer,
be sure to wash it with detergent after
herbicide use. Then, fill the tank and
prime the system with an ammonia so-
lution (1 quart of household ammonia
in 10 quarts of water) and let stand.
After 12 to 24 hours, rinse and purge
the sprayer with clean water until the
ammonia solution is totally removed.

VI. Sprayer Calibration

Many people do not calibrate their application
equipment and then wonder why their weed
control efforts fail. Calibration for an herbicide
treatment differs from an insecticide or fungi-
cide treatment. Insecticides and fungicides are
applied at a specific concentration while herbi-
cides are applied at a specific rate of product
per unit area (e.g., ounces per 1,000 sq ft).

Therefore, the amount of water used is not as
important as the amount of herbicide used per
unit area as long as adequate coverage is ob-
tained with the water used.
Factors affecting the calibration of a sprayer
include pressure, nozzle size, condition, num-
ber, as well as the viscosity of the spray, and
the speed at which the area is covered. Vari-
able pressure will cause variable sprayer.
Therefore, maintaining constant pressure or
using a pressure regulator will facilitate a con-
sistent application. The rate of speed that an
area is covered should be held as constant as
possible to improve the accuracy of the appli-
cation. Gardeners using hand-held or hand-op-
erated sprayers will operate their sprayers at
different pressures and cover areas at different
speeds. Therefore, calibration should be done
by the individual who will be making the ap-
plication.
A. Calculating Your Sprayer

Any kind of sprayer can be calibrated by
using the following steps:
1. Check the operation of the sprayer.

Check for a clogged nozzle and hose, rust
in the tank, and leaks. Thoroughly clean
and repair the sprayer before calibrating
the sprayer.

2. Mark off 100 square feet. (You may want
to use 1,000 square feet for more accurate
calibration.) Use a string or garden hose
to mark off the area.

3. Add a known quantity of water to the
sprayer that is sufficient to cover the
marked off calibration area.

4. Spray the calibration area exactly as you

would spray herbicide. Be sure to walk
the same speed and use the same pressure
as you would when spraying the herbi-
cide. Remember, you only need to lightly
wet the plants. Don’t spray until the wa-
ter drips off.

Note: Many recommendations are given per
1,000 square feet. If 100 square feet is
used for calibration, multiply the dif-
ference remaining in the tank by 10 to
calculate the amount of water that
would be required to cover 1,000
square feet.

Chapter 13, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

13 - 11

5. Measure the remaining water in the tank.

A. Mechanical Removal

The difference between what you origi-
nally added to the tank and what remains
is the amount of water required to cover
100 square feet (or 1,000 square feet).
•

If you applied 18 fluid ounces to a 100
square foot area, 180 fluid ounces or
1.4 gallons of water to cover a 1,000
square foot area.

• Add the recommended rate of chemi-
cal to the amount of water needed to
spray 1,000 square feet.

• Apply the herbicide by walking the

same speed and using the same pres-
sure as when you calibrated.

Example: You have sprayed 13 ounces

on the 100 square feet.

13 oz x 10 = 130 oz (about l gallon)

per 1,000 square feet

Add the recommended amount of her-
bicide to 1 gallon of water to spray the
1,000 sq ft area.

B. Granular Applicators

These can be calibrated in a similar way as
sprayers, but the applicator must use the
herbicide granular material in the calibration
process. A cement or asphalt driveway or a
large plastic canvas sheet can be used to
catch the herbicide as it is distributed by the
spreader. The surface area of the drive or
canvas sheet is measured. Then the applica-
tor is operated in the same manner that it
would be operated for the actual application.
After completing this calibration applica-
tion, the granules are swept up and weighed.
Adjustments are made to the applicator until
the desired amount is being applied in a
consistent manner. The operator should note
the setting on the applicator so that calibra-
tion is not required before each time an ap-
plication is made. However, calibration
should be done whenever the source of the
material changes, or at the beginning of the
season each year.

VII. Tree Stump Removal

When trees are cut from a landscape, removal
of the remaining stumps often becomes a diffi-
cult problem.

Using heavy equipment, such as a back hoe,
to remove a tree stump can be expensive. It
also might result in unacceptable damage to
turf, ornamentals, or other adjacent vegeta-
tion. Failure to remove the complete stump
and roots will often result in a proliferation
of new shoots.
Some homeowners use an axe or chain saw
to cut away stumps. This generally requires
a lot of time and energy but can be success-
ful if the trunk is not too large, and if the
roots can be removed.
B. Chemical Treatments

Treating tree trunks with an appropriate her-
bicide concentrate before cutting (or treat-
ment of live stumps after cutting) will kill
stumps and roots, and stop sprouts from de-
veloping. Use caution when treating trunks
or stumps with herbicides. Some herbicides
may leach into the root zone of nearby
plants. Application of herbicide is usually
best accomplished with a paint brush rather
than a sprayer. A dead stump will normally
decompose in 1 or 2 years. Then, the rotted
wood can easily be removed by hand.

VIII. Noxious Weeds

“Noxious weed” means kind of

species of any plant having the potential
to cause injury to public health, crops,
livestock, land or other property, and
which is designated as noxious by the
director.
Chapter 24, Title 22, Idaho Code, Noxious Weeds
Noxious weeds are weeds that have been de-
clared by law to be noxious. Property owners
must not allow noxious weeds to go to seed or
propagate on their land. Idaho, through the
State Department of Agriculture, determines
weeds to be listed as noxious and provides
counties the power to administer the law.
Procedures have been set by law and rules pro-
mulgated by the State Department of Agricul-
ture which form noxious weed districts. These
districts direct noxious weed control efforts
within in their jurisdiction. These efforts may
include handling complaints, entering property
through an established procedure to control
noxious weeds, attaching claims against prop-

erty to cover control costs, and cooperating
with other agencies and organizations in con-
trolling noxious weeds.  The weeds listed in
Table 4 are officially designated and published
as noxious.

It shall be the duty and responsibility

of all persons and nonfederal agencies to
control noxious weeds on land and
property that they own, in accordance
with this chapter and with rules and
regulations promulgated by the director
of the Department of Agriculture.

I. Introduction to Turfgrass Culture

Idaho’s climate, soils, and topography are highly
variable. The environment varies from warm
arid to cool semiarid growing conditions.
Natural vegetation varies from sagebrush and
bunchgrass to evergreen forest. Growing a
lawn in Idaho requires knowledge of the cli-
mate and resources available for establishing
and maintaining the desired type of lawn.

Establishing and maintaining the ideal or perfect

lawn is a long term commitment of labor,
money, and other resources. Wise use of these
resources will result in a relatively problem-
free living area and will reduce chronic prob-
lems that may be difficult to solve once a mis-
take is made.

Everyone knows what a perfect lawn should look
like—a uniformly green carpet free of insects,
weeds, and diseases that holds its color for
most of the year. Homeowners often desire
perfection, but this expectation may have to be
adjusted.

The homeowner must decide what type of lawn is
really needed. Will it be a showplace, a recre-
ational area, an average lawn, or just some sort
of green cover?

What level of maintenance will be given? High
maintenance for perfection usually means ex-
pending time and money. Are both available,
and will they be committed to the project?

What are the limitations of the site? In general, to

be successful with turf, at least 4 hours of di-
rect sunlight per day is needed. In low light
areas or on steep banks, an alternative to

mowed turf such as ground covers, meadow
grasses, or mulches should be considered.
Lack of water, poor drainage, or poor soils can
also limit quality turfgrass.

II. Soil Considerations

A. Texture

This is the percentage of sand, silt, and clay
that make up a soil. Lawns can be estab-
lished and maintained on essentially any
soil texture from sand to clay. Sand, silt, and
clay describe the three basic sizes of soil
particles that are found in soils (see Chapter
4, “Soils and Fertilizers”). Coarse-textured
or sandy soils provide a difficult base for
maintaining nutrition and moisture. How-
ever, fine textured soils or clay soils can
have drainage problems that are difficult to
correct.

B. Soil Structure

This refers to the way soil particles clump
or hold together (aggregate). All soils, from
sand to clay, can be improved by the addi-
tion of organic matter. Organic matter, such
as livestock manure or plant materials,
modifies the soil structure by improving
aeration and drainage in soils. In addition to
improving the structure of soils, organic
matter can also improve the ability of soil to
retain nutrients for growing plants (see
Chapter 4). Organic matter adds nutrients to
the soil as it decomposes and provides a
growing medium and food supply for ben-
eficial soil microorganisms.

Chapter 14, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

14 - 2

Expectations of most homeowners are that
the lawn they establish will last 20 to 30
years or longer. Consequently, the only
chance to modify soil structure and drainage
is before lawn establishment. Homeowners
should take this opportunity to rototill in 2
inches of compost (well-decomposed or-
ganic matter). If decomposed organic matter
is not available, organic matter in various
forms such as peat moss, rotted sawdust,
weathered livestock manure, shredded
leaves or straw, dried grass clippings, and
other plant materials can be added 3 to 6
months before establishing turfgrass to al-
low for decomposition. Tough, fibrous ma-
terials such as sawdust, leaves, or straw will
need an extra application of nitrogen fertil-
izer to help their breakdown process (see
Chapter 7, “Backyard Composting”).

C. Soil Depth

In general, it is best to have at least 1 foot of
permeable rooting medium over any hard-
pan, dense clay, or gravelly subsoil. If only
2 to 4 inches of soil are placed over a ce-
ment-like layer of hardpan, turf failure is
inevitable because of drainage problems and
restricted root growth. Clay subsoil may re-
quire tiling to ensure adequate drainage and
aeration in the rooting zone. Sandy subsoil
with adequate fertility can be used quite
well when establishing new lawns.

D. Preplant Fertility

A soil test will give valuable information on
nutrient levels and soil pH. Phosphorus,
which helps with root development, is best
incorporated in the top 4 inches of soil be-
fore seeding or sodding since it does not
move into the root zone when placed on the
surface. Nitrogen and potassium are both
soluble in water. Nitrogen will find its way
into the root zone as water moves down
through the soil. Potassium, although it
moves slowly with water, should be incor-
porated when possible.
In the absence of a soil test, apply the fol-
lowing nutrients per 1,000 square feet be-
fore turf establishment. Incorporate to a
depth of 4 to 6 inches: 1/2 to 2 pounds of
actual nitrogen (N), 2 to 3 pounds of phos-
phate (P2O5), and 1 1/2 to 3 pounds of pot-
ash (K2O).

E. pH

Soil pH in Idaho varies from alkaline to
acid. A soil analysis for the particular site
where the lawn is to be established will pro-
vide information on the soil pH level. Soil
pH outside the range where lawn grasses
flourish (6.0 to 7.5) can lead to chronic mi-
cronutrient deficiencies resulting in poor
turfgrass growth. Soils in most areas of
southern Idaho are alkaline (7.1 to 8.5), and
may require the addition of sulfur to reduce
the soil pH to a desired level.
Table 1, along with your soil analysis before
adjusting soil pH, will help determine the
need for sulfur. Fine-textured soils (clay)
will require more sulfur than coarse-tex-
tured soils (sand). After the application of
sulfur and before seeding, the sulfur should
be thoroughly mixed in the top 6 inches of
soil. Soils with a pH greater than 8.3 may
need gypsum instead of sulfur to reduce pH.
In northern Idaho, soils tend to be acidic. If
your soil pH is below 6.0, lime is required
to raise the soil pH to the desirable level.
Table 2 will help you determine how much
lime is needed.
Sulfur, lime, or gypsum can be added at the
time other amendments are being applied.
Consult your county Extension educator if
you have questions on altering pH or need
information on soil testing.

III. Site Preparation

A. Preplant Weed Control

If there are perennial weeds or undesirable
grasses on the site, the first step should be
weed control. Glyphosate is the most com-
monly used herbicide material for preplant
weed control as it kills many herbaceous
weeds within 7 to 10 days without causing a
detrimental soil condition for future plant
growth. Glyphosate is sold under many
trade names including Roundup. More than
one application may be necessary for some
weeds. Follow label directions.

B. Grading and Surface Preparation

Remove building debris and other trash
from the lawn area during lawn construction
and grading. Such material causes mowing
hazards and blocks root system develop-
ment. Rotting wood can serve as a nesting
site for termites and is often the host of the
troublesome “fairy ring” disease in lawns.
The subgrade should be sloped away from
the house, and the area should be allowed to
settle several weeks before seeding or sod-
ding. After establishing the rough grades,
roll, rake, and smooth the area to the final
grades. Minor surface irregularities will be-
come permanent after the roots have locked
soil particles together. The smoother the
area, the better the appearance once mowing
begins. Allow 2 to 4 weeks for settling be-
fore planting. Two or three wetting and dry-
ing periods during this time will speed up
the process.

C. Drainage

Drainage tile is not often used in Idaho ex-
cept where hardpans and extremely heavy
clay subsoil layers are found. When internal
drainage is a problem, and the situation re-
quires a tile drainage system to remove ex-
cess water, an adequate outlet should be
found before designing the drainage system.
Tile lines are laid during lawn construction.
Place the tile lines at least 12 to 24 inches
below the finished grade and at intervals of
10 to 15 feet. Apply a 4- to 6-inch layer of
pea gravel over the tile lines, then layer sand
or sandy soil, and finally apply topsoil up to
the surface.

In areas of poor drainage, it is especially im-
portant to slope the grades away from the
house. Water should quickly drain from any
paved areas so the pavement doesn’t be-
come icy, creating a safety hazard, or re-
main unusable for hours after irrigation or
rain. A 1-foot drop in 50 feet will usually
supply adequate surface drainage. Grades
steeper than a 1-foot drop in 4 feet may
cause mowing and erosion problems. Alter-
natives to a steep grade include terraces, re-
taining walls, or planting a ground cover or
meadow grass that is not mowed.

D. Installing the Sprinkler System

When supplemental irrigation is necessary
and an underground system is desired, in-
stall the system after final grading and
smoothing. Drainage lines are usually
placed 6 to 18 inches deep. Whenever pos-
sible, set irrigation pipe below the frost line
and normal tillage depth.

IV. Choosing a Turfgrass
A. Cool Season Grasses

These grasses can withstand Idaho’s cold
winters and perform well under most condi-
tions.
1. Bentgrass—Well-maintained creeping
and colonial bentgrasses are the most
professional appearing turfgrasses since
they can be mowed at very low heights
(less than 1/2 inch) and form a dense,
tight green carpet as seen on golf greens.
Bentgrasses are often found invading
other turfs in a home lawn situation, but
they are not usually recommended for
home lawn use unless their high mainte-
nance levels can be maintained.
Bentgrasses have the highest fertility, wa-
ter, and mowing requirements of all the
cool season grasses. Thatch development
is high, consequently, bentgrasses will
need frequent dethatching. They are also
susceptible to several diseases including
red thread, Fusarium blight, and take-all
patch. See Table 3 for suggested variet-
ies.

2. Fescues

a. Turf-type tall fescues: These grasses

are well adapted to a wide range of

Chapter 14, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

14 - 4

soil conditions. Tall fescues tolerate
heat and drought better than most cool
season turfgrasses due to their deep
root systems (4 to 6 feet). Fescues can
withstand traffic and heavy use and are
often used on football and other play-
ing fields. The new turf-type tall fes-
cues, especially the new dwarf variet-
ies such as Bonsai and Twilight, are
thinner bladed than older varieties.
Since fescues do not spread by stolons
or rhizomes, they do not form thatch.
Fescues are usually planted as a mo-
noculture (a pure stand of a single spe-
cies). They do not accept low mowing.
Their fertility requirements are low to
moderate. See Table 3 for suggested
varieties.

b. Fineleaf fescue: Fine fescues include
creeping red fescue, chewings fescue,
and hard fescue. Fescues have the fin-
est leaves of any lawn grass. They per-
form best in shady lawns in mixtures
with shade-tolerant Kentucky blue-
grasses. These grasses are excellent for

overseeding poor lawns to improve
turf quality. In mixtures with other
grasses, they add disease resistance to
the turf. Fine fescues are adapted to
well-drained, infertile soils. Often they
are grown on slopes and left unmowed
to create a meadow effect. Their fer-
tilization requirements are low to mod-
erate.
The creeping red fescues have a
spreading or rhizomatous root system
that will easily cover open soil areas to
create a lawn. The chewings fescues
are bunchgrasses that do not spread.
They should be planted thickly enough
to ensure a dense and even turf. The
hard fescues are also bunch-type,
make excellent turf, have extensive
root systems, and are drought tolerate.
See Table 3 for suggested varieties.
3. Kentucky bluegrass—This is probably
the most traditionally used cool season
grass. Monocultures of Kentucky blue-
grasses are not recommended in southern
Idaho because of insect and disease prob-

lems. Bluegrasses, however, may be a
part of most grass mixtures. Bluegrasses
are slow to germinate and establish. They
are good at repairing damaged turf areas
because of their ability to spread. This
can be a problem when flower beds bor-
der turf areas. Bluegrasses have a moder-
ate to high fertility requirement.
More than 250 varieties of Kentucky
bluegrass have been released through the
Idaho Crop Improvement Association
(ICIA) Certification Program. A few are
listed in Table 3. Patented seed varieties
are generally certified and are sold in
blends with other varieties.

 4.Perennial ryegrass—Turf-type perennial
ryegrasses germinate and establish very
rapidly. They are extremely wear toler-
ant, producing beautiful lawns that do not
form thatch. Ryegrasses blend well with
other grasses and add disease and insect
resistance to bluegrass mixes. Ryegrass
leaves are fibrous, requiring a sharp
mower blade to avoid shredding or tear-
ing the turf. Like Kentucky bluegrass,
ryegrasses require moderate to high fer-
tility levels (Table 3).

5. Crested wheatgrass—Crested wheatgrass

is a cool season bunchgrass that is not
considered a turfgrass, however, it is of-
ten used along roadsides and in dryland
pastures where turfgrasses would not
thrive. This grass is intended for low
maintenance and restricted irrigation or
natural precipitation situations. Under
natural precipitation in southern Idaho,
the majority of growth occurs in early
spring until midsummer. When moisture
deficiencies occur, the plant will go dor-
mant until sufficient moisture is received.
Crested wheatgrass will stay green at
higher elevations (cooler conditions) if
watered through the summer. The variety
‘Fairway’ has a lower, more spreading
growth characteristic than standard
crested wheatgrass varieties.
Additional information on cultivar per-
formance (e.g., disease resistance, tex-
ture, color, spring green up, etc.) is avail-
able through the National Turfgrass
Evaluation Program, U.S. Department of

Agriculture, Ag Research Service, Belts-
ville Agricultural Research Center, Belts-
ville, MD 20705. Sites in the intermoun-
tain region are listed in these reports.

B. Warm Season Grasses

These grasses are not commonly grown in
Idaho because their performance is not as
satisfactory as most cool season grasses.
Warm season grasses go dormant, turn tan
or brown with the first frost, and stay that
way until the weather warms. In southern
Idaho, experiments are being conducted to
test their extreme drought tolerance.
1. Buffalograss—These warm season

stoloniferous grasses, due to their drought
resistance, are becoming popular in the
West, even in cool season areas. Buffalo-
grasses are resistant to heat and drought.
They are well adapted to a wide range of
soils, but especially to alkaline conditions
and soils of low fertility. Buffalograsses
are slow to establish (1 to 3 years) and
they require infrequent mowing. Like
most warm season grasses, they have a
short growing season (4 to 5 months) in
the north due to their inability to with-
stand cold weather. Hence, during half
the year or more in Idaho, a buffalograss
lawn will be tan or brown in color (Table 3).
2. Zoysiagrass—One species of zoysiagrass
called Japanese lawn grass is cold toler-
ant. It will persist, even in a subarctic cli-
mate, however, it has a very short grow-
ing season. Zoysiagrass is adapted to a
wide range of soil conditions but grows
best on well-drained, slightly acidic soils
of medium texture and fertility. Although
it is quite tolerant of drought, heat, and
cold stress, like most of the warm season
grasses, it is slow to green up in spring
and late season discoloration begins at
50°F to 55°F. Zoysia is slow to establish.
The density and toughness of the grass
blades may require a heavy, reel mower.
‘Meyer’ is the only variety of zoysiagrass
suggested for use in Idaho at this time.

Note: Consult with your local Extension edu-

cator for the recommended species
suited to your area.

V. Establishing the Lawn

A. Seeding Lawns

Seeding is the most inexpensive way to pro-
duce a lawn. Start with a well-prepared seed
bed and quality seed. The purchase of lawn
seed is a long-term investment, and the seed
you buy will influence your success in de-
veloping a beautiful lawn. It is not possible
to evaluate the quality of seed by looking at
it. Information that will help you make a
wise choice is printed on the seed package.
Check the label accompanying the package
of seed. Purchase weed-free seed whenever
possible.
There are differences in lawn seed, and it
pays to compare. The price you pay for seed
will represent only a small portion of the
total cost of planting, fertilizing, mowing,
etc. Don’t let low cost be your only consid-
eration when purchasing lawn seed. Choose
varieties that have been tested and proven
best for your area. Idaho has a seed truth-in-
labeling law that requires truth in labeling.
The label on the package must include an
analysis of the seed it contains. This analy-
sis enables the purchaser to determine the
kind of seed contained in the package, to
estimate how well it should perform, and to
compare its cost-effectiveness with other
brands. A sample seed label may look like
this:

Kind: Kentucky bluegrass
Variety: Park
Pure seed: 98%
Germination: 85%
Inert matter: 1.2%
Date of test: 6/95
Weed seed: 0.3%
Other crop seed: 0.5%
Lot: IA
Noxious weeds: None
John Doe Seed Co., Idaho Falls, ID

The terminology used on the label is defined
below:
Pure seed:  The percentage (by weight) that

is actually seed of the crop specified.
Germination: The percentage of viable

(live) seed.

Inert matter: The percentage (by weight) of
chaff, dirt, trash, and anything that is not
seed.

Date of test: The date of test should be

within the last 15 months.

Weed seeds: The percentage (by weight) of

all weed seeds in the sample and the
number of noxious weed seeds present. It
is against the law in Idaho to sell seed
containing noxious weeds. If the seed
listed contains noxious weed seeds, avoid
purchase of this seed and report it to the
Idaho Department of Agriculture.

Other crop seeds: The percentage (by

weight) of crop seed other than the crop
specified. For example, in tall fescue, this
includes orchardgrass and ryegrass. In
Kentucky bluegrass, it may include
bentgrass, ryegrass, tall fescue, or peren-
nial ryegrass contaminants.

1. Cost-effectiveness—When considering
seed lots of similar quality, compare the
amount of Pure Live Seed (PLS) in the
package. The only thing you really want
to pay for is the seed that will grow. To
determine the amount of PLS, look at the
analysis on the label; multiply the germi-
nation percentage by the percentage of
pure seed and then multiply by 100 to get
the percentage of PLS. For example:

Germination = 85%
Purity = 98%
0.85 x 0.98 = 0.833
0.833 x 100 = 83.3% PLS

To obtain the cost per pound of PLS, di-
vide the price per pound by the PLS. If
the seed costs $2.25 per pound, then
$2.25 divided by 0.833 equals $2.72, the
actual cost per pound of PLS.

2. Quality—Certified seed is a guarantee

from the seller that you will get the kind
and variety of lawn seed named on the
label. Buying certified seed is a good
practice. If the seed is certified, a blue
certification label will be attached to the
seed package.
Most grass seed sold at the retail level in
Idaho will not have a blue certification
tag attached to the package. However,

Chapter 14, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

14 - 7

many of the varieties are patented and
most originators of these varieties require
the variety to be certified in order for it to
be marketed. If you find specific varieties
listed on the package, the seed probably
came from a certified lot and is of good
quality. Consumers should still check the
label for pure seed, weed seed, inert mat-
ter, and other factors which indicate seed
quality.
The University of Idaho has worked with
the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
seedsmen, and the Idaho Crop Improve-
ment Association to develop a program
that helps purchasers recognize quality
lawn seed. Special labels are placed on
packages containing seed that meets very
high standards of purity, germination,
and freedom from weed and other crop
seed. Seed in a package that carries a cer-
tified seed label is certified and recom-
mended for use.

3. Seeding methods—Lawn areas can be
seeded with a drop spreader or a rotary
(cyclone) spreader. Drop spreaders are
more accurate than rotary spreaders and
allow planting along driveways, side-
walks, and flower beds without wasting
seed. The spreader should be calibrated
to deliver the appropriate seeding rate.
Only very small spots can be seeded by
hand, as it is difficult to obtain an even
distribution of seed using this method.
Because the seeds of different grasses
vary in size, weight, and growth, there is
considerable variation in seeding recom-
mendations. Follow directions on the
seed package or use the guidelines shown
in Table 4. Choose your seeding method,
as discussed above, but ensure uniform
distribution by dividing the recom-
mended seed amount into two equal
parts. Sow one-half of the seed in one di-
rection and the second half in the oppo-
site (perpendicular) direction. A light rak-
ing will mix the seed into the soil surface.
Do not rake heavily or the seed will be
covered more than the necessary 1/8- to
1/4-inch. A light rolling will make a firm
seed-to-soil contact, which promotes ger-
mination.

4. When to sow—The optimum time for
seeding turf in southern Idaho is in the
fall, August 15 to September 30. Fall
seeding has a much higher success rate
than spring seeding for many reasons.
The warm days and cool nights of fall are
ideal conditions for seedling growth.
There is less weed competition in the fall
than in spring. Lawns seeded in the fall
will be well rooted and have sufficient
top growth in spring to be drought and
heat tolerant by summer.
Be sure that seeding is completed early in
the fall so that the grass is well estab-
lished before winter. In some areas of
Idaho, grass seed is sown on top of the
soil just before winter snows. This is a
viable method of seeding grass, espe-
cially in dry areas or where the growing
season is short.
Spring seeding (April-May) is used for
establishing warm season grasses, for
seeding cool season grasses if you live in
northern Idaho, or if you missed the fall
seeding time. Seed as soon as the ground
can be safely worked. If the seed is sown
too early, when the soil is too cold and
damp, slow, irregular germination will
result. There is also strong competition
from germinating weeds during the
spring. When practical, wait until weed
seeds germinate, cultivate the soil to kill
them, and then sow the grass seed.
Establishing turfgrass by seeding in mid-
summer is difficult because of high tem-

peratures, quick moisture evaporation,
and drought stress conditions. Seeding
can only be successfully achieved in mid-
summer if supplemental irrigation is
available, and the seeded area is well sup-
plied with moisture several times a day to
encourage seedling establishment.

5. Mulching—This is the practice of apply-
ing plant materials or other foreign matter
(such as fiberglass sheeting) to a seedbed
to reduce erosion and provide a more fa-
vorable germination and seedling envi-
ronment. While mulching is not essential
for lawn establishment, it will help pre-
vent surface erosion, especially on sloped
sites. Mulch also moderates temperature
fluctuations at the soil surface, reduces
crust formation, and reduces surface
evaporation. Humidity levels at the soil
surface are increased with mulch, and
seed loss or seed displacement from
wind, birds, and rain (or irrigation) is re-
duced.
Not all mulches serve all of these func-
tions, and some are better than others.
Which material is selected depends on
specific requirements at each site, cost,
availability of materials, and ease of han-
dling. A light mulch of weed-free straw
or grass hay will encourage faster seed
germination. Early season cuttings of hay
are preferred, as they are less likely to
contain weed seeds. Use a rate of 75 to
100 pounds per 1,000 square feet; make
sure 50 percent or more of the soil is vis-
ible after mulching. The straw or hay
need not be removed after seedlings
emerge.

6. Watering—Failure to provide sufficient

moisture is a major cause of unsuccessful
turf establishment. After planting, if rain-
fall is inadequate, the upper 1 inch of soil
must be kept moist with daily, light irri-
gations for the first 2 to 3 weeks. After
the seed germinates and seedlings de-
velop enough to mow, the lawn can be
watered less frequently, but more deeply
(8 to 12 inches deep) to encourage good
root development and adequate soil aera-
tion. Improved soil aeration accompanies

the reduction in irrigation frequency. As
water evaporates, is used by the plants,
and drains from the soil, air is pulled into
the soil. Plants require adequate amounts
of oxygen in the root zone for respiration.

7. Mowing—Start mowing as soon as the
grass is tall enough to cut (over 1 inch).
Set the mower at the proper cutting
height for your species and keep the
blade sharp. Immature stands are mowed
by the one-third rule used on established
turf—no more than one-third of the shoot
growth is removed at each mowing.
Avoid mowing when it is muddy because
the wheels can pull seedlings out of the
ground. Frequent mowing will help con-
trol annual weeds and limit clipping ac-
cumulation that might smother the new
turf.

8. Overseeding—Reseeding bare spots or
thickening sparse turf by overseeding is
usually done in late summer or early fall,
however, on small areas that are kept
moist during germination, overseeding
can be done anytime. For spot seeding,
work up the area with a hard-tined rake
or shovel. Mix a starter fertilizer into the
soil, and sow the grass seed. When
overseeding thin turf, rake the area first
to loosen compacted soil and ensure a
good seed-to-soil contact.
Changing grass species can also be con-
sidered overseeding when the following
technique is used. Kill the established
turf by using a glyphosate herbicide,
mow as close as possible after the turf
dies, and seed into the dead turf. This
practice has been very successful in
changing Kentucky bluegrass lawns to
tall fescue. Keep in mind that if soil prob-
lems exist before seeding, such as dry
spots from compaction or puddling due to
poor drainage, they will exist with the
new turf as well. Improve poor soil con-
ditions through major renovation and re-
sort to the more conventional method of
seedbed preparation.

B. Sodding

This offers the instant beauty of a lush,
weed-free lawn that can be used about 3

Chapter 14, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

14 - 9

weeks after installation. It gives a head start
against lawn weeds and there’s no need for
mulching the turf area. Sod may be an im-
portant consideration for a family in a new
home where children need a safe, clean
place to play or where the lot must be pro-
tected against erosion due to its slope. The
cost of sod is about six times more than
grass seed. Other considerations are the la-
bor involved to install the sod correctly and
whether the grass species or cultivars you
desire are available in sod.
If you have the opportunity, examine the
sod before ordering. Check for consistency
in turf texture and for the presence of weeds
or diseases that can indicate a poorly main-
tained sod crop. There should be a uniform
color and thickness to the sod. When the sod
is delivered, examine several rolls before
accepting it.
Several types of sod are available for resi-
dential landscapes. The basic types are Ken-
tucky bluegrass blends, Kentucky bluegrass-
fine fescue mixtures, Kentucky bluegrass-
perennial ryegrass mixtures, Kentucky blue-
grass-tall fescue mixtures, and tall fescue
monocultures. Each type of sod is best suited
to particular uses and geographic areas.
The easiest way to install sod is to hire a
landscaper, but if you decide to save money
by doing your own sodding, follow the steps
below. Do not skimp on soil preparation,
site grading, or watering.
1. Soil preparation—Preparations for seed-
ing and sodding are essentially the same.
Make sure the site is prepared before
scheduling delivery of the sod. Sod is
heavy; it weights about 50 pounds per
square yard. Sod arrives on wooden pal-
lets each stacked with 50 square yards of
grass. Pieces are typically 18 inches wide
and 24 inches long. Pieces vary with the
particular cutting machine used, but usu-
ally three pieces make 1 yard.
Try to be on site when the sod arrives so
that the pallets can be positioned to mini-
mize the distance rolls must be carried
for installation. Plan to lay the sod imme-
diately. If there is a short delay, keep the
rolls moist, but not wet, in a shady loca-

tion. For a long delay, it is best to unroll
the sod on cement or a sheet of plastic to
avoid having it root into itself or into soil
where it will not be laid.

2. When to lay sod—Landscapers lay sod
successfully almost year-round, except
during the winter. Sodding in spring or
early summer, while grasses are growing
rapidly, allows quick rooting. In dry areas
or during hot weather, supplemental irri-
gation will be necessary to establish the
sod. Before planting, water the soil 6
inches deep. It is important to schedule
this watering in advance to avoid a
muddy site when sod installation begins.
Do not lay sod on dry soil. Even if sod is
watered immediately after being laid on
dry soil, root growth will be retarded.
3. Installation—If you plan to lay the sod

yourself, be prepared to squat or kneel on
a wide board to protect and prevent com-
paction of the soil surface as you work.
Handle sod with care to avoid tearing and
excessive stretching. Lay the first strip of
sod along a straight edge such as a drive-
way or sidewalk. If there are only curves,
lay at a right angle to the curve or use a
string to establish a straight line. Butt
joints tightly together to prevent root dry-
ing, but do not overlap. On the second
row, stagger the joints similar to the way
bricks are laid.
Use a sharp knife to cut sod to fit curves,
edges, and sprinkler heads. Try to avoid
using short or narrow leftover pieces be-
cause they tend to dry out rapidly. If two
pieces are not long enough to butt to-
gether, mound soil against the exposed
sod edges to protect them from drying.
When sodding slopes, start at the bottom.
If the slope is very steep, peg both ends
of the sod strip with wooden pegs. Allow
the pegs to remain until sufficient rooting
has occurred to stabilize the soil. When
watering sodded slopes, take care to
avoid starting erosion around or under-
neath the sod.
Do not wait to water until the whole lawn
is sodded; the first laid strips may be
dried out by then. As you complete a

Chapter 14, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

14 - 10

conveniently large area of sod, water
lightly. Continue to lay sod and water
previously sodded sections until installa-
tion is complete.

4. Rolling and watering—Roll the lawn af-
ter laying all the sod. Rolling eliminates
irregularities and establishes a good con-
tact between the sod and soil. Water the
completed lawn thoroughly. The soil
should be moist to a depth of 6 inches
after irrigating. Irrigate daily until the sod
becomes rooted, usually in about 10 days.
Keep people off the lawn for 3 to 4
weeks until the grass is well anchored.
After the sod is established, decrease wa-
tering frequency but increase the amount
of water per application. Deep (8 to 12
inches), infrequent watering is best for
developing healthy, deep-rooted turf (see
Section VI for more information on irri-
gating).

5. Mowing and fertilizing—Make sure the

blade is sharp on your mower. Begin
mowing new sod after it is well rooted
and growing. Use the one-third mowing
rule referred to earlier in this chapter. Six
weeks after installation, apply 1 pound of
actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet.
Thereafter, follow the fertilizer recom-
mendations listed in Section VI of this
chapter for your particular turf species.

C. Vegetative Planting

Some grasses may not be available in seed
or sod, instead they may be produced veg-
etatively using plugs, sprigs, or stolons.
Many warm season grasses are established
vegetatively, while occasionally cool season
grasses are repaired using plugs.
1. Plugging—This is the planting of turf us-

ing sections of sod varying in size from
small cores 1/2 inch across, such as those
extracted during core aeration, to large
round or square plugs measuring 2 to 4
inches or larger and 1 to 3 inches deep
(Fig. 1). Several variations in plug sizes
are available depending on the plugging
equipment used and the area to be propa-
gated or repaired.
Plugs are a quick way to repair damage
on golf courses and athletic fields. Plug-

ging can be used to propagate new
turfgrasses in bare soil or to introduce a
new species into an existing turf. For ex-
ample, a Kentucky bluegrass lawn can be
converted to zoysiagrass by planting
plugs. The conversion, which is usually
slow, can be accelerated by adjusting cul-
tural practices to favor the introduced
turfgrass.
Plugs are planted mechanically or by
hand in an upright position (with the ex-
ception of the small cores taken during
core aeration). The tops of the plugs
should be flush with the soil surface.
Zoysiagrass is most commonly propa-
gated by plugging, but any stoloniferous
or strongly rhizomatous turfgrass can be
started in this way.
Cores taken during core aeration are usu-
ally broadcasted onto a planting bed and
rolled to crush them and provide a
smoother surface. The cores are highly
susceptible to desiccation, consequently,
the planting bed must be kept continually
moist until rooting has taken place.

2. Sprigging—A sprig is a section of stolon
with two to four nodes. Sprigs are usually
planted in 2- to 3-inch deep rows with a
portion of the sprig above the soil sur-
face. Sprigs, unlike plugs and sod, are
free of soil. Hence, they are more prone
to desiccation. Sprigging is primarily
used for propagating stoloniferous warm
season grasses, but it is also used for
creeping bentgrass. Sprigs can be planted
mechanically in furrows or plunged into
the soil individually using a notched
stick.

3. Stolonizing—Stolonizing is a method of

broadcasting the sprigs and then top-
dressing or lightly discing the area to par-
tially cover the stolons. To reduce desic-
cation of the sprigs, stolonizing is done in
3- to 4-foot strips followed immediately
by top-dressing and light irrigation.

VI. Maintenance of Established Turf

The wide variety of microclimates and soil
types in Idaho make it difficult to formulate a
uniform program of lawn maintenance. The
basic factors required for maintaining a lawn
are discussed in this section. However, the rec-
ommendations may need to be modified for
your particular location.
In addition to considering the genetic potential
of a turfgrass for your lawn, important factors
in maintaining high-quality turf should include
an annual program of mowing, fertilization,
weed control, irrigation, and leaf raking. In ad-
dition to these, the following cultural practices
may be necessary in some years: dethatching,
pH adjustment, aeration, disease control, and
insect control.
A. Genetic Potential

The potential for a lawn to provide a quality
surface is dependent upon the varieties of
grass in the lawn. New, improved varieties
are released each year. Periodic infusion of
improved varieties into the existing turf will
increase the chances of producing a high
quality lawn. The best maintenance program
is not likely to produce a quality lawn if in-
ferior turfgrasses dominate the stand.

B. Mowing

This is the most basic of all turfgrass cul-
tural practices since it influences many
other cultural operations. Frequent mowing
(once or twice weekly) is recommended to
avoid removing more than one-third of the
grass blades at any one time (Table 5). The
one-third rule is especially important during
periods of midsummer stress on cool season
turfgrasses. Violations of the one-third rule
are of less consequence during non-stress
periods such as cool weather. Mow new
lawns early in their development and don’t
allow excessive growth to accumulate on
established lawns between mowings.

Scalping, or mowing lower than the recom-
mended rate is not advisable at any time of
year because of the stress it causes turf. Of-
ten a brown, scorched appearance follows
close cutting due to the removal of grass
blades that shade and protect the delicate
crowns.
Mowing, in general, is detrimental to
turfgrasses because it reduces carbohydrate
production and photosynthesis. It also
causes a temporary cessation of root growth,
temporarily increases water loss from cut
leaf ends, and because the leaves are cut,
creates the potential for more disease infec-
tion. To reduce the loss of photosynthesiz-
ing tissue in the blades, mowing should be
done frequently to remove as little of the
green area of each leaf as possible. In
shaded areas, photosynthesis is not as active
as in the sun, therefore, grasses in these ar-
eas are not mowed as frequently. Turf in
hot, sunny areas should also be cut some-
what taller especially during the summer to
reduce evaporation from the soil surface.
The benefits of mowing, on the other hand,
are to encourage lateral bud growth and
tillering. (Tillering is the formation of new
aerial shoots from axillary buds located
along the crown.) When tillering increases,
the grass becomes finer, the sod gets thicker
and more dense, and the turf’s overall ap-
pearance is more attractive.
Some grasses are easy to cut, while with
others it is difficult to get a clean cut.

Ryegrasses (due to their fibrous vascular
bundles) and zoysiagrass (due to the leaf
silica content), are difficult turfgrasses to
cut cleanly if your mower blade is not sharp.
In contrast, bentgrass, and Kentucky blue-
grass are easy to mow.

C. Removing Clippings

Whether to catch clippings or not has long
been an argument in lawn culture. Clipping
removal is necessary on golf greens, but on
home lawns it is optional. Clippings are a
source of plant nutrients, especially nitro-
gen. Short clippings left on the lawn will
filter through the grass and decompose. As
high as 20 to 30 percent of a lawn’s nitrogen
requirement can be derived from clippings
left in place. Leaving clippings eliminates
one fertilizer application per year. Con-
versely, regular removal of clippings will
necessitate the application of additional fer-
tilizer to compensate for nutrient removal.
Clippings are not the cause of thatch in most
grasses. Long clippings, however, should be
removed to avoid suffocation of the turf be-
neath.

D. Irrigation

To know how to irrigate properly, you must
know your soil’s texture, structure, and
depth. The surest way to determine when to
irrigate is to feel the soil in the root zone
area by using a soil probe, trowel, or shovel.
Check to see if the soil at a 12-inch depth
feels damp, like a wrung-out sponge. The
soil should crumble easily when tapped, yet
should form a ball when pressed inside your
fist. It should not hold together in a tight,
wet, mud ball or be bone dry. Learning to
“read” your turf is important too. A blue-
green turf color, failure of blades to spring
back when walked on, and lack of dew for-
mation on turf at night are signs of exces-
sive dryness.
1. Timing of irrigation—Night watering

uses water efficiently due to less evapora-
tion. However, fungus problems may in-
crease with night watering because hu-
midity and moisture levels on and around
plants remain high for hours. Early morn-
ing watering is a better choice because
plants have a chance to dry off before

evening. Daytime watering is not encour-
aged, especially on hot or windy days,
because of high evaporation rates and
water displacement.

2. How much water to apply—Various

turfgrasses differ in their water require-
ments and drought resistance. Warm sea-
son grasses such as buffalograss will
thrive with only a once-a-month deep
watering while Kentucky bluegrass will
probably need a once-a-week deep water-
ing to thrive. Soils differ in their ability
to hold water. Clay soils hold water
longer than sandy soils. Clay soils can be
watered once a week and hold water for
the entire week while sandy soils may
need to be watered two or three times per
week to maintain some moisture.
Apply water slowly to prevent runoff and
achieve good infiltration, especially on
slopes to encourage deep rooting. Water
long enough for moisture to reach a soil
depth of 8 to 12 inches. Kentucky blue-
grass and perennial ryegrass have the
ability to develop root systems 12 to 18
inches deep. Tall fescues can develop
roots up to 6 feet deep!
Avoid overwatering as it can cause many
problems, including nutrient leaching and
root rots. If you squish around on your
turf 24 hours after watering, or if you see
standing water on your lawn, you may be
overwatering or have a drainage problem.
Excessive water might also be indicated
by a yellowish-green grass color. Water-
logged turf will develop a shallow root
system due to the lack of oxygen in the
soil. Shallow-rooted turf will not be able
to handle temperature extremes.
Check watering amounts using the “can”
method. Place four to five same-sized,
flat-bottomed cans (such as soup cans) in
a line equally spaced in one sprinkler pat-
tern. The reason for using several cans
instead of one is that nozzles do not spray
an equal amount of water over the entire
pattern. Start within a foot or two of the
sprinkler head and continue to the end of
the watering pattern. To determine aver-
age sprinkler output over a designated

Chapter 14, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

14 - 13

period of time, collect and measure the
total amount of water in the cans and di-
vide by the number of cans used.

Example: You watered for 30 minutes

and collected 4 inches of total
water from four cans. Four
cans divided into 4 inches
equals 1 inch of water being
applied in 30 minutes). A good
watering rule is to apply no
more than 1 to 2 inches of
water per week.

Whenever possible, replace only the wa-
ter used by the turf. During hot, dry sum-
mer days a turf may consume more than
2/10 inch of water per day. Two inches of
water per week is recommended for most
turf during the heat of summer in dry,
rainless areas. The amount of water
needed will be 1 inch or less per week
when the weather is cool, especially in
spring and fall or on cloudy, overcast
days.
Under water stress, the turf may wilt. Just
before wilting, however, grass leaves will
turn a grayish blue-green color and the
turf will no longer spring back after being
walked on. If you notice these symptoms,
water immediately. A little stress will not
kill turf, but watering before these symp-
toms is best. During severe drought con-
ditions, cool season grasses often protect
themselves from desiccation by going
into a dormant state.

E. Fertilization

A soil test is a good way to begin determin-
ing fertility needs. Contact your local Exten-
sion office or a laboratory listed in the tele-
phone Yellow Pages about soil testing.
An adequate fertility program can reduce
weeds, lawn moss, and certain diseases.
Plus, the lawn will be dense, well-colored,
and of manageable growth. Overfertilizing
should be avoided since it increases thatch
development and surface and groundwater
contamination. An overfertilized lawn will
grow rapidly and require more water and
more frequent mowing. Succulent, fast-

growing turf is also more susceptible to dis-
eases and insects.
Fertilizers can provide nitrogen to plants
immediately or over an extended period of
time. The amount that can be safely applied
at one time depends upon the availability of
the nitrogen. The portion of the nitrogen
that is slowly available is listed on the fertil-
izer bag as Water Insoluble Nitrogen
(WIN). For example, a 30-10-10 fertilizer
with 5 percent WIN actually provides 5/30
or 1/6 of its nitrogen in the slow-release or
slowly available form. A 50-pound bag of
this material would provide 15 pounds of
total nitrogen (.30 x 50 = 15 pounds) of
which 2.5 pounds (.05 x 50 = 2.5) would be
slowly available (WIN).
If no WIN is listed on the fertilizer label,
assume that it is all water-soluble or quick-
release (quickly available) nitrogen, unless
the fertilizer contains sulfur-coated urea.
Sulfur-coated urea fertilizers provide slowly
available nitrogen, but the fertilizer label
does not list it as WIN.
Statements on the fertilizer bag such as
“contains 50 percent organic fertilizer” do
not mean that the fertilizer is 50 percent
slowly available. It is impossible to calcu-
late the amount of WIN from this informa-
tion.
Source of fertilizer nitrogen also has other
characteristics that should be considered
when purchased and used. Those with high
“burn potential” should be watered into the
lawn with 1 to 1 1/2 inches of water. If ap-
plications are to be made when soils are
cold, those which cause a “rapid” response
should be used. Also, homeowners should
be aware of the leaching potential of the
materials used. Table 6 summarizes these
characteristics.
On established turf, a fertilizer ratio of 3-1-2
or 3-1-1 is recommended. Examples of
these ratios are: 15-5-10, 15-5-5, 30-10-20,
and 30-10-10. If these analyses cannot be
found, select the fertilizer with the closest
analysis to the ratio. If your soil test results
indicated adequate amounts of phosphorus
or potassium, you may only need to apply a
nitrogen fertilizer such as 21-0-0.

cies require different amounts of fertilizer
to thrive. Examine Table 7 for recom-
mended fertilizer rates for your particular
grass type.
When making fertilizer applications,
avoid applying more than 1 1/2 pounds of
nitrogen (N) per 1,000 square feet per ap-
plication. Inorganic sources of nitrogen,
when used at larger rates, can burn the
turf and contaminate surface and ground-
water due to leaching. To reduce nitrogen
loss and maintain some level of longevity
to nitrogen fertilizers, use a slow release,
granular material whenever possible as
part of your fertilizer program. Organic
nitrogen sources, on the other hand, can
be applied at a rate as high as 2 pounds N
per 1,000 square feet per application
without the risk of burning due to the
slow release nature of the material.

Note: Lower more frequent rates of quick-

release N fertilizer can be used on
sandy to sandy loam soil.

For even fertilizer coverage, apply granu-
lar or pelleted fertilizer with a cyclone or
drop spreader. Drop spreaders are more

able stripes. Hand spreading of fertilizer,
except for small areas, is not recom-
mended because of uneven coverage.

ber). Fall fertilization is very important to
encourage turf vigor and spring green up.
Follow with a third application in late
spring (May) and, if needed, make a final
application in June. Avoid fertilizing cool
season grasses in the heat of summer
(July and August) when they tend to go
semidormant. Fertilizing to stimulate
growth when turf physiologically needs
to slow down or “rest” is stressful and
over time the turf will thin out and
weaken.

F. Aeration

Coring or core aeration is also called
aerification. It involves removing cores or
plugs of turf and soil with the purpose of
improving compacted soil. Aeration is ac-
complished by using power or hand-driven
machines that remove cores of soil 1/4 to 1
inch across and 3 to 4 inches long. The
holes in the turf are made 4 to 6 inches
apart. Aeration should be done on well-
moistened soil. Tines usually do not pen-
etrate to the needed depth in compacted dry
soil. Cores can be left to decompose in place
or collected and removed. If left in place,
crush the cores with a roller or rake them
into the soil. They will help reduce thatch.
Lawns exposed to heavy traffic may require
aeration at least twice during the season.
Spring and early fall are the best times to
aerate. Aeration may be done every month
if needed, as long as the soil is not frozen or
too wet. If done properly, aeration does not
harm the lawn or roughen the turf. Equip-
ment rental centers usually have lawn aera-
tion equipment available.
Many benefits are derived from core aera-
tion; the following is a list of the most obvi-
ous:
1. Increased soil aeration and water penetra-

tion.

2.  Stimulated root and shoot growth.
3. Reduced soil compaction.
4. Increased germination of overseeded

grasses.

5. Improved turfgrass response to fertilizers

and better fertilizer infiltration.

6. Reduced thatch, especially where soil
cores are reincorporated or where top-

dressing follows coring. However, core
aeration alone is not a recommended way
to control thatch.

G. Thatch

Thatch is a brown, fibrous, spongy layer lo-
cated between the soil and the grass blades.
Thatch accumulation is a natural process.
As grass plants grow, new tissues are pro-
duced and as old tissues die, it is sloughed
off. Thatch is the accumulation of plant tis-
sues high in lignin, such as dead stems and
roots. Thatch accumulates when dead grass
parts exceed the rate of decomposition.
Leaving grass clippings on the lawn is not
the cause of thatch for most cool season
grasses. Less than 1 percent of thatch is
composed of grass blades. Grass blades tend
to be succulent and decompose rapidly. An
exception is some of the warm season
grasses.
1. Benefits and disadvantages of thatch—

A thin layer of thatch (1/4 to 1/2 inch
thick) is beneficial as it helps decrease
soil moisture evaporation and soil tem-
perature fluctuations. Thatch also helps
retain nutrients and insulates the soil and
roots from compaction by cushioning
footfalls and equipment used on the turf.
Thatch that is more than 1/2 inch thick,
however, can be detrimental because it
will restrict water, air, fertilizer, and pes-
ticide movement into the soil. Roots of
the grass plants will grow in thick, dense
thatch instead of the soil, making the turf
less heat and drought tolerant. Turf in-
sects and many diseases find thick thatch
a good home.

2. Causes of excessive thatch—Good condi-
tions for organic matter accumulation and
poor conditions for its decomposition
create thatch. Overfertilizing can encour-
age thatch formation because turf is
growing (and dying) at a faster rate. Ex-
cessively wet or dry conditions and cool
weather also encourage thatch buildup.
Under these conditions, soil microorgan-
isms that assist with thatch breakdown
cannot live or function well.
Stoloniferous grasses naturally form
more thatch during normal growth.

Chapter 14, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

14 - 16

Bentgrasses, especially when mowed too
high, can accumulate excessive thatch.
Kentucky bluegrass, for example, is a
high thatch former while creeping red
fescue is a medium thatch former. Peren-
nial ryegrass and turf-type tall fescue do
not develop much thatch since they are
bunchgrasses.

3. How to remove thatch—Preventing

thatch buildup with good turf manage-
ment practices is the best method of con-
trolling thatch. Use proper fertilizer and
irrigation rates to create the well-bal-
anced conditions needed for grasses to
grow moderately. If dethatching becomes
necessary, use a power rake or vertical
mower (also called a verticutter). Vertical
mowing (verticutting) is cutting with
blades or tines that move vertically to the
soil surface. Hence, vertical mowing is
cutting and slicing the turf vertically to
rip thatch and turf. Use the power rake
once in one direction and once in the op-
posite (perpendicular) direction.
Late summer or fall is the preferred time
for dethatching because it causes the
lawn to look rough or ragged. Damage
caused by thatch removal may require
overseeding. Follow dethatching with
fertilization and irrigation to minimize
the rough look of the lawn after dethatch-
ing. The old thatch that is brought up
should be removed. Top-dressing with a
sand/peat mixture, compost, or topsoil is
optional after dethatching. When thatch is
extreme (1 inch or more), it is easier to
remove the lawn and reseed or resod the
area.

H. Top-dressing

Refers to the practice of spreading a thin
layer (1/4 inch) of soil, compost, humus, or
sand and peat mix over the turf or soil. Top-
dressing is used to control thatch and help
level turf surfaces and cover seeds, stolons,
or rhizomes during turf propagation. Top-
dressing is a common golf course mainte-
nance operation that has a home lawn appli-
cation.
Usually a drop spreader is used for top-
dressing. After the material is dropped,

brushes, rakes, or special drag mats are used
to work the topdressed material into the turf.
When using top-dressing to control thatch,
first verticut or power rake the area, then
topdress. For controlling thatch, top-dress-
ing is applied at 3- to 6-week intervals as
many times as needed.

I. Weed Control on Established Turf

The first step to any successful weed control
is to identify the weed. Weeds have differ-
ent life cycles and sometimes need different
control measures. Annual weeds, for in-
stance, are much easier to control than pe-
rennial weeds. Hoe an annual weed at
ground level and it dies; do the same to a
perennial weed and it comes back from the
root left in the soil.
Some control methods will save you time
and money. For example, mowing slightly
higher will shade out germinating annual
broadleaf weeds so that herbicide use can be
avoided. Also, mowing the top off annual
broadleaf weeds before they form seed will
reduce their population. Because competi-
tion is an important factor in seed germina-
tion and plant survival, one of the best weed
deterrents is a dense stand of turfgrass.
Hand pulling, using boiling water, or apply-
ing a commercial herbicide on individual
weeds can give an economical and selective
method of control without broadcasting her-
bicide material over the entire turf.
Organic methods of control such as hoeing
and hand pulling are practical for annual
weeds, however, perennial weeds can be
difficult to control without herbicide use.
Weekly removal of top growth is an old
practice that reduces root vigor on persistent
weeds. This method, unfortunately, may
take more than one year to eliminate some
weeds.
If herbicides are to be used, make sure the
grass is established and growing vigorously
before treatment. Always read and follow
the herbicide label carefully for your own
safety and the health of your plants. Avoid
spray drift by not using excessive pressure.
Avoid spraying on windy days when wind
velocity exceeds 2 to 3 miles per hour. For
the health of your landscape plants, avoid

Chapter 14, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

14 - 17

applying herbicides, such as Banvel
(dicamba), near the root zones of desirable
trees and shrubs. To avoid contaminating
desirable plants, always use a separate
sprayer designated for herbicide use only.
Timing is important for effective weed con-
trol. Weeds, whether annuals or perennials,
are more easily controlled when they are
small. Spring (April-May) is a good time to
spray summer annuals, while early fall
(September) is the best time to spray winter
annuals and some perennials. Tough peren-
nial weeds such as Canada thistle or field
bindweed (wild morning glory) may take
several herbicide treatments if herbicide ma-
terials are applied early in the season. Sum-
mer and early fall applications may be more
effective on these weeds since they are most
susceptible to herbicides after their flower
buds have formed. Annual grasses such as
crabgrass are usually treated with a
preemergent material in March before the
seeds have a chance to sprout.
Two types of herbicides are used on turf:
selective herbicides are those that eradicate
certain plants but not all plants (2,4-D,
MCPP, Banvel); nonselective herbicides are
those that eradicate all plants (Roundup).
Preemergent herbicides that kill seeds be-
fore they emerge, such as Dacthal, fit into
the nonselective category.
The control of perennial weeds can be a
continuing problem on new turf or thin, un-
healthy turf. For more information on weed
control methods, refer to University of
Idaho Extension publication CIS 888, Weed
Control in Lawns. For more information on
specific herbicide controls, see CIS 723,
Herbicides for Lawn Weed Control.

J. Turf Renovation

This will be needed for deteriorated lawns
and any turf areas where sods are too poor
to save. Renovation will also be needed for
extremely weedy or thatchy lawns, and
lawns with structural faults such as poor
drainage or extreme compaction. Renova-
tion will, in the long run, minimize the frus-
tration and cost that goes along with trying
to keep these turf areas alive.

To renovate a turf, the sod is either de-
stroyed with a nonselective herbicide or
taken out with a sod cutter. Next, plowing
or rototilling follows and soil amendments
are added if necessary. Grading, smoothing
and seeding or sodding are the final steps as
discussed in Sections III and V of this chap-
ter.

K. Turf Problems

1. Insects and insect control—Many differ-
ent types of insects are present in a lawn.
Most of these are not harmful to the
grass. Insect control is not necessary un-
less the population of undesirable insects
builds up enough to cause visible damage
to the lawn.
Close examination, on hands and knees,
is the best way to identify insect pests in
a damaged lawn. You may be able to see
the insect in action. If you think you have
an insect problem, your local Extension
office can help identify the pest and sug-
gest control measures.
The most common above-ground insect
pest in Idaho lawns is sod webworm,
these insects feed on grass leaves and
stems. Below ground, the most common
pests are white grub larvae and billbug
grubs which feed on plant stems and
roots. Sod webworms are the larval or
caterpillar stage of several species of
Lepidoptera. Adults are commonly seen
flying in jerky, short flights as you walk
through the grass. The caterpillars feed
on the grass blades at night. Sod web-
worms prefer well-managed lawns. Dam-
age appears as small brown areas in the
grass.
White grubs are the larval or grub stage
of several species of beetles and chafers.
Typically, white grubs have a cream-col-
ored body with a dark-colored area at the
posterior end, a brown head, and front
legs but no back legs. White grubs feed
on roots, causing brown areas in the
lawn. Usually turf damaged by grubs can
be rolled back like a rug to reveal the
large white grubs.
Billbug and weevil larvae look much like
white grubs, except that they are much

Chapter 14, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

14 - 18

smaller and do not have legs. Larvae feed
on roots, and adult beetles feed on grass
blades and stems. Damage is similar to
that caused by white grubs.

2. Turf problem diagnosis—Proper diagno-
sis of turfgrass problems is essential if an
effective solution is to be found. Fact and
observation must be correlated to deter-
mine the causes of turf problems. Some
turf problems have their “roots” in main-
tenance practices from previous years,
which makes diagnosis difficult. Seldom
does the homeowner recognize that there
is a problem until considerable damage
has occurred. It is virtually impossible to
accurately diagnose the initial cause of
some problems because the damage oc-
curred so long ago that there is no identi-
fiable symptom or causal agent present.
Diagnosis of turfgrass problems requires
a pocket knife, a good quality hand lens,
and a soil probe. The following is a
checklist to help diagnose problems and
give you an appreciation for the complex-
ity of diagnosing:
a. Observe site conditions such as the ex-
posure and severity of slopes; the loca-
tion of sidewalks, driveways, and pa-
tios; drainage patterns; traffic distribu-
tion; and locations of buildings and
other structures. Note the location,
size, and types of trees; how much
shade they cast; and their rooting pat-
tern. Check prevailing winds, orienta-
tion of buildings in relation to the sun,
play areas, or areas that may be com-
pacted due to use.

b. Determine the species and, if possible,

varieties of grasses. Evaluate vigor,
density, amount and type of cover.
Note whether growth is sparse or
dense, and whether the color indicates
chlorosis. Note the types of weeds
present.

c. Note overall color of turf, any mottled
appearance, patterns of dead or dam-
aged turf, presence of weeds, condi-
tions of adjoining turf areas, and gen-
eral vigor and density of overall
growth.

d. Examine overall pattern of damage.
How did damage appear to spread?
Note if it’s most prominent on well-
drained or poorly drained areas, where
thatch is heavy or minimal, or whether
it appears to follow mower or foot traf-
fic patterns.

e. Examine plant leaves. Note lesions,
fungus fruiting structures, and symp-
tom appearance.

f. Examine plant roots. In particular, note

their color; healthy roots are white.

g. Check the thatch layer. Ask about the
mowing program. Determine height of
cut, frequency of mowing, sharpness
and adjustment of equipment, and
whether a rotary or reel mower is used.
h. Check the soil. Measure the depth and

determine the type if possible. Also
note drainage, compaction, evidence
of hardpan or claypan, or presence of
buried materials. Note whether a soil
test has been made in the past 3 years.
i. Ask questions about the chemicals ap-
plied. Determine the fertilizer analysis,
type of nitrogen, herbicides, insecti-
cides, fungicides, and other products
used.

j. The final step is to correlate all known
facts, observations, and weather condi-
tions; then, make a judgment on pos-
sible causes of damage and corrective
measures to be taken.

3. Common lawn problems to watch for:
a. Improper watering (too much or too

little) is the single most important
cause of poor turf. Use 1 to 2 inches of
water per week, except when rain
supplements irrigations. Weather will
determine if a low (1 inch) or high (2
inches) rate of water is necessary.

b. Poor soil drainage, especially on clay
soils, may show up as standing water
or as constant wetness with moss
growing. This may require amending
the soil or adding drainage tiles.

c. Summer dry spots are a common oc-
currence especially in southern Idaho.
Use a wetting agent, aerate and top-

Chapter 14, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

14 - 19

dress, or amend the soil and reseed. On
severe slopes, terrace the area or use
ground cover or turf that will not be
mowed.

d. Mowing too low (scalping) can stress
turf and cause it to scorch. Mow at the
height recommended for your variety
(Table 5).

e. A dull, tan cast on the surface of the

grass may indicate a dull mower blade.
Pick a blade of grass and look at it up
close. If the tip or cut end looks torn or
shredded instead of flat across, it’s
time to sharpen the blade.

f. If the turf seems to be growing too fast
to keep up with the mowing, consider
fertilizing less. If you dislike mowing,
use a dwarf tall fescue such as Bonsai,
which only grows 3 to 4 inches tall.

g. Thatch buildup is evident on turf that
feels especially spongy when walked
on. Check the thatch layer by cutting a
wedge out of the turf. If the thatch is
more that 1/2 inch thick, dethatch with
a power rake in the fall.

h. If weeds or crabgrass are a constant
problem next to a driveway or side-
walk, it usually indicates that the turf
is stressed due to reflected heat from
the paved areas. Consider removing
the turf to make a planting bed of
shrubs, bulbs, perennials, or annuals
along these hard-to-grow turf areas.

i. Thin turf may be a result of shading or

improper fertilizing and watering. If
shade is the problem, use a shade-tol-
erant grass-like red fescue or use a
ground cover instead. Fertilizing cool
season grasses during the heat of sum-
mer can disrupt their natural physi-
ological cycle as they tend to slow
down or go semidormant during hot
weather. Fertilizing forces them to
grow. Over time, this practice will
stress a turf and cause it to thin. Fertil-
ize in the fall, whenever possible. Ad-
ditional applications may be applied
from spring to early summer.

j. Turf diseases and insects occasionally
occur on even the best of lawns. Bill-

bug on bluegrass and fairy ring fungus
are two very common culprits in
southern Idaho. In high elevations,
snow mold may be a problem.

Terry Finnerty, Former Extension Horticulturist, Sandpoint Research and Extension Center

I. Introduction

Horticulture is an art and a science—especially

when it comes to landscaping. Imagine the
landscape as the canvas with the greenscape
(plants) and hardscape (sidewalks, edging, and
patios) providing the colors, shapes, and pat-
terns of the living portrait. Landscape archi-
tects even use the term “plant palette” when
referring to plant lists.

The skill to match the proper plant to the proper

environment and to provide the proper cultural
inputs to guarantee the survival of plants on
the landscape is the science of landscaping. In
addition to being more attractive and easier to
maintain, the benefits of a well-planned, well-
designed landscape include economic savings
(reduced inputs of water, fertilizer, and pesti-
cides), enhanced real estate values, and per-
sonal satisfaction and peace of mind.

To help you create an attractive and functional
landscape, we will discuss some basic prin-
ciples of landscaping including planning and
design, plant selection, and installation and
maintenance. Although the following prin-
ciples are primarily for homeowners, you also
can apply them to larger properties or landscapes.

II. Definitions

A. Landscape—An arrangement of outdoor

space for a specific purpose or goal. Goals
may be as general as increasing the attrac-
tiveness of a landscape to more specific
things such as reducing the amount of wa-
ter, maintenance, and chemical inputs into
the landscape.

B. Landscape Design—A blueprint or drawing
of the landscape that the designer creates to
fulfill the property owner’s goals and objec-
tives for the landscape.

C. Landscape Architect—A professional who cre-

ates landscape designs.

D. Landscape Plan—Describes how you are going
to meet the goals and expectations of the land-
scape design.

E. Landscape Maintenance—The specific activi-
ties (weeding, spraying, watering, fertilizing,
etc.) needed to meet the goals and objectives
of the landscape plan.

F. Landscape Management—Coordinating the

maintenance procedures to meet the landscape
plan’s objectives .

G. Landscape Contractor—Someone who installs
and sometimes maintains landscapes. This in-
dividual also may be the landscape manager
who is responsible for meeting the landscape
plan’s objectives.

H. Landscaping—Includes all of the concepts

from design to maintenance.

III. Creating a Plan

Have a plan before you plant! Whether you are
developing a landscape plan for a new home or
renovating an older landscape, it is important
to have a plan before you do anything. In the
long run, not having a plan may create mainte-
nance problems and reduce the overall appear-
ance of the landscape. The following steps will
help you develop a plan for a landscape that is
both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
A. Define Your Goals and Objectives

This is the most important step of the land-
scape process. Establishing clear goals and
objectives at the beginning will help you
achieve the benefits you hope to receive
from your landscape plan.
Decide what type of plan best fits the needs
of your household, while working within the

economic, social, environmental, and physi-
cal constraints that will affect your final
landscape plan. Specific goals and con-
straints might include the following:
1. Goals

a. Low maintenance, low input (includes
reduced watering, pesticide and fertil-
izer applications, and less mowing).

b. More privacy.
c. More recreation area.
d. More color.
e. More wildlife habitat (includes forage

and cover for birds and desirable in-
sects).

2. Constraints

a. Environmental conditions (includes

b. Physical barriers or obstacles on the

landscape.

c. Social (includes public ordinances re-
stricting water use or plant selection).

d. Economic.
e. Physical handicaps.

B. Do a Thorough Site Analysis

Gather as much information as possible
about your site and the area where you live.
Make a preliminary map of your property,
drawn to scale, that includes the locations of
your house, buildings, sidewalks, and drive-
way. Indicate on the map, or on a separate
sheet of paper, the following information:
1. Macroclimate—This refers to major

weather patterns (temperature and pre-
cipitation) that affect large areas. In
Idaho, cold hardiness is a critical factor
for determining plant survival. Idaho cov-
ers five USDA hardiness zones, 2 to 6,
(-50° to -10°F), with temperatures being
affected by elevation and latitude (Fig. 1).
Temperature and precipitation can vary
considerably within a hardiness zone. Al-
ways consult local or regional weather
services or extension publications for
specific weather information for your
area.

2. Microclimates—These are the weather

patterns that the landscape in your imme-
diate area affects. When conducting a site
analysis, look for potential problem areas
such as hot spots, frost pockets, wet
spots, or shaded areas. Mark these micro-
climates on your preliminary map for fu-
ture reference.

3. Soils—See Chapter 4 for more informa-

tion about soils. In regard to urban or
residential landscapes, consider the fol-
lowing:
a. Most urban or residential soils are dis-

turbed soils and probably won’t re-
semble the less disturbed, native soils
of the surrounding region.

b. Proper soil conditions are as important

to plant growth and survival as ideal
climate conditions. Drainage, pH,
structure, organic matter, and mineral
composition are factors to consider in
relation to plant growth.

c. Because you are working with a small
area, it is easier to improve the soil us-
ing various soil amendments.

Note: If your site has a lot of variability in

the soil, you should indicate the differ-
ent areas on your preliminary map and
plan accordingly. See the UI Extension
Bulletin 704, “Soil Sampling,” for in-
formation about taking soil samples on
your site.

4. Topography—Besides altering the micro-

climate, topography can affect drainage
and make some areas difficult to plant
and maintain.

5. Aspect—Note the exposure of the site

relative to the sun. This is more critical in
mountainous areas or areas with steep
hills. Generally, plants growing on the
warmer, south-facing side of a slope will
break dormancy faster than plants grow-
ing on the north-facing side. This pro-
vides a longer growing season, but it also
can make plants more susceptible to late
frosts and other freezing-related injuries.
6. Existing plant materials and structures—
Show existing plant materials, sidewalks,
driveways, patios, and other structures on
your preliminary plan.

7. Access—Besides driveways and side-
walks, plot “traffic” areas around the
landscape. Consider ways to improve ac-
cess to your home or other parts of the
landscape.

8. Easements—Draw these on your map to

prevent planting any permanent plant ma-
terials in these areas.

9. Overhead utility lines, sewer lines, under-

ground cables, and transformers—Note
these on your preliminary site plan and
plan accordingly. Some basic rules for
planting in these areas include:
a. Plant trees and shrubs away from utili-

ties;

b. Plant taller or broad spreading trees
away from overhead lines, and use
shorter, slower growing trees for
closer planting if you must plant near
overhead utilities;

c. Don’t plant species near utilities that
can prevent access or cause mainte-
nance problems; and

d. Avoid planting species such as pop-
lars, willows, and cottonwood with
dense, fibrous roots near sewer lines or
septic systems.

Note: See the UI Extension CIS 991, “Land-

scaping and Utilities: Problems, Pre-
vention, and Plant Selection,” for more
information.

10. Views—Indicate your views looking out
from your house, and approaching your
house. What do you want to see? What
don’t you want to see? What do you
want others to see or not see?

11. Available water—Show the location of
your water sources. If your property has
areas that are difficult to water, you may
want to modify your plan to meet the
needs of these areas by using drought-
tolerant plants or hardscape (nonliving)
materials.

12. Local ordinances—Consult state and lo-

cal authorities for specific regulations
about planting trees and shrubs along
streets, sidewalks, and rights of way.

C. Define Use Areas

You can divide use areas into three major
categories:
1. Public areas—This usually describes the

front of your landscape. The primary
function of this area is aesthetics and to
“welcome” visitors to your home.

Note: There are no distinct boundaries on
these areas, and they will frequently
overlap in terms of function and ap-
pearance. Within these major use
areas, you should designate specific
use areas (e.g., recreation, perennial
flower beds, vegetable garden, and pa-
tio) for the various activities that you
are planning for your landscape. For
more information about planning your
landscape see CIS 990, “Water Con-
servation in the Landscape.”

Chapter 15, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

15 - 4

2. Private areas—These are the areas used
for recreation, family activities, and en-
tertaining.

3. Service areas—These areas are reserved
for the vegetable garden, composting, pet
and livestock areas, storage shed, wood-
piles, and other utilitarian purposes. They
can include areas that are difficult to
maintain, have limited access to water, or
have poor soil.

D. Define Planting Areas

Plot planting zones based on water needs or
the plants’ maintenance requirements and to
meet the landscape plan’s objectives.
1. Hydrozone or group plants with similar
water needs in the same areas. For ex-
ample, consider planting willows, dog-
woods, or birches that usually thrive un-
der moister conditions near annual flower
beds (high water users). To conserve wa-
ter, do not mix plants that have low water
requirements with plants that have high
water requirements.

2. Reduce maintenance activities by group-

ing plants with similar maintenance re-
quirements together.
a. Perennials generally require less fre-
quent maintenance than annuals. In
Idaho, most of the maintenance of pe-
rennials occurs in the spring and fall.

b. Plant trees or shrubs with messy
leaves, fruits, or seeds away from
flower beds especially if these plants
reproduce easily from seed. It is easier
to rake this material up or remove the
new seedlings from a lawn than from
your planting beds.

c. Group shrubs with similar flowering
periods together so it’s easier to re-
member which plants you need to
prune in early summer and which ones
in the fall or early spring. Grouping
also will help you focus maintenance
activities on specific areas of your
landscape.

3. Design planting areas to meet the objec-
tives of your landscape plan. If your ob-
jective is privacy, design planting areas
to maximize privacy. On the other hand,
if you are concerned about security, you

may want to leave large areas of open
space with reduced opportunities for con-
cealment. Perhaps you would like to en-
courage more wildlife on your land-
scape? Then you will need to plan for
more areas that provide both food and
shelter. Plan and plot your objectives be-
fore starting to plant.

E. Principles of Design

The house is the focal point of the design.
The landscape should complement, not
clash, with the house. The landscape is an
extension of the living space. Just like the
appearance and arrangement of your house
affects your personal living space, so does
the appearance and arrangement of your
landscape. It affects you aesthetically based
upon your inward and outward views and
from a functional perspective.
1. Balance—You can achieve balance on

the landscape in two ways:
a. Symmetrically: Place equal numbers

of plants, plants of equal size, or struc-
tures or planting beds of equal size op-
posite each other on the landscape. For
example, plant two shrubs of the same
size and species on opposite sides of
an entryway or plant two flower beds
of equal size, dimension, and species
composition on opposite sides of a
sidewalk.

b. Asymmetrically: Balance plants and

structures in terms of volume of space
occupied on the landscape. One ex-
ample might be to plant a large red oak
on one side of the yard to counterbal-
ance a mass planting of ornamental
shrubs on the opposite side. Also, you
could counterbalance a deck with a pe-
rennial bed.

2. Movement—You can create a sense of

vertical and horizontal movement on the
landscape. For example:
a. Tall, columnar trees or shrubs draw

your eyes upward, whereas a low, flat
bed of colorful annuals pulls your eyes
downward.

b. Lines, especially curved lines of walk-

ways or planting beds, create a sense
of motion that encourages you to move

Chapter 15, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

15 - 5

visually and physically through the
landscape.

3. Harmony—The proper use of space,

color, texture, and plant materials on the
landscape creates harmony.
a. Use plants and structures that are in

scale with the house.

b. Enhance the overall landscape design
with plants and plantings that comple-
ment each other.

F. Elements of Design

1. Space—Use space effectively by consid-

ering the following principles:
a. Select a mixture of plants that provide
an effective transition from the vertical
plane (air) to the horizontal plane
(earth) to create a better sense of har-
mony and balance.

b. Plant trees that provide filtered shade
(e.g., honey locusts) rather than trees
that provide heavy shade (e.g., maples)
for a more subtle influence on vertical
space.

c. Select different species of plants based

upon their form and structure as well
as their color or flowering habits.

d. Use curved lines to create a more natu-
ral, informal appearance. Straight lines
are less natural and more formal.

2. Color—Color affects the landscape de-

sign in various ways.
a. It gives the landscape movement, ac-
cent, shade, and depth. For example,
bright colors such as reds and yellows
are good for accent, variety, and for
attracting attention to specific areas.
Use blues and dark colors to create
shade and depth.

b. Color affects moods. Reds are exciting
colors that generate energy; pinks and
greens are soothing colors; and light
blues create a cool feeling.

Note: A color wheel will help you make ef-
fective color choices. They are avail-
able at crafts, art, paint, or office sup-
plies stores.

3. Texture—Texture is the “visual feel” of

the landscape or of landscape plants.
Some plants have a coarse texture be-
cause of their foliage, branching patterns,
or bark. For example, a horse chestnut
tree with its large, serrated, compound
leaves will have a coarser texture than a
weeping willow.

4. Plant arrangement—The individual at-

tributes of the plantings and overall effec-
tiveness of the landscape plan is affected
by plant arrangement.
a. Specimen plants draw attention to
themselves because of their color,
shape, or size. Plant them by them-
selves or enhance beds with mass
plantings. Large shade trees (oaks,
maples, and conifers) or small trees
and shrubs (ornamental crabapples,
hawthorns, burning bushes, and vibur-
nums) make effective specimen plants.

b. Mass plantings enhance the appear-
ance of plants that may not be as at-
tractive or effective individually. An-
nuals, perennials, small shrubs, and
ground covers are generally more ef-
fective as mass plantings. Also, on
more naturalized landscapes, it is best
to plant shrubs in odd numbered clus-
ters for a more natural appearance.

G. Plant Selection

Select plants that meet your design objec-
tives. These might include the following:
1. Functional.
2. Aesthetically pleasing.
3. Cold hardy—Check if the plant is

adapted to the minimum temperature
zone for your area.

4. Low maintenance—Select species that
require a minimum amount of pruning,
watering, and raking. Cut the frequency
of maintenance time for woody plants by
reducing the variety of early- and late-
flowering species.

5. Low input—Select plants that require

less water and chemical inputs.

6. Nonpoisonous and safe—This is espe-

cially important in areas that children will
use. Try to reduce the number of plants

Chapter 15, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

15 - 6

that may have poisonous fruits, flowers,
or foliage or that have thorns or spines
that can cause injuries.

Note: Contact your local Extension educator

or the Poison Control Center if you
have any questions.

7. Appropriate selections for planting near

utilities.

8. Economical—What we want is not al-
ways what we can afford. Your budget
will determine your choice and size of
plant materials that you can purchase.

9. Native or nonnative species—Some

people recommend planting native (in-
digenous) species over nonnative
(nonindigenous) species because, theo-
retically, they are better adapted to an
area. This is not necessarily true since
most residential landscapes are disturbed
sites and unnatural environments that
probably will have more inputs (irriga-
tion, fertilizing, and pest control) than the
preexisting natural environment. Native
plants are not always more drought toler-
ant than nonnative species either.

Note: The bottom line is to choose the best

plant that is adapted to the area you are
going to plant it in and that meets your
desires for your landscape.

10. Nonnoxious—Noxious weeds are a seri-
ous problem in agricultural areas. If you
plan to purchase or introduce plants
from out of state, contact your local Ex-
tension educator for information or the
County Weed Control supervisor about
noxious weeds in Idaho.

H. Other Considerations When Buying Plants

Some other important things to consider
when you are buying plants are:
1. To ensure greater adaptability to your

area, purchase plants that local seed
sources have produced. This is especially
important for woody and herbaceous pe-
rennials.

2. Before purchasing plants via mail order,

check local nurseries. You may save

money, and you will be able to inspect
the plants for pests and diseases. Also,
you are more certain of getting a live
plant.

IV. Installation and Renovation

Follow these steps when installing a new land-
scape or renovating an older one. The se-
quence depends upon your needs and abilities.
A. Primary Hardscape

Install sidewalks, driveways, walls, terraces,
decks, patios, and ponds. These will define
your use areas and will prevent future dam-
age to your landscape if done in the begin-
ning.

B. Install Planting Beds

Amend soils, if necessary, and install weed
barriers, if desired.

C. Plant or Move Trees and Shrubs

Plant and transplant shrubs early in the
spring or late fall when plants are dormant
and the soil is workable. Do not transplant
large trees and shrubs when they are ac-
tively growing. (See CIS 528, “Plant Your
Container-Grown Seedlings Right,” for in-
formation about planting and transplanting
trees.)

D. Install Automatic Irrigation System
E. Plant Lawn or Ground Covers

Add soil amendments if you have poor
soils—especially soils low in organic mat-
ter—or plant some type of an annual cover
crop to improve the soil before planting.

V. Maintenance and Irrigation

A. Maintenance

Review the maintenance requirements of
your landscape plan before actually install-
ing the landscape. This will save you a lot
of frustration and expense in the long run.
Refer to other Master Gardener chapters for
more information about the following main-
tenance activities:
1. Proper pruning—Timing and technique is

important. (See UI BUL 819, “How to
Prune Deciduous Landscape Trees.”)
2. Staking and wrapping trees or shrubs.
3. Mulching—Includes organic, inert, and

synthetic mulches. Organic mulches
should not be deeper than 2 to 4 inches.

Chapter 15, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

15 - 7

Incorporate fine mulches such as sawdust
into the soil. Plastic, nonporous mulches
are not recommended for landscape use.
(See UI Extension CIS 858, “Using Bark
and Sawdust for Mulches, Soil Amend-
ments, and Potting Mixes,” for more in-
formation about mulches on the land-
scape.)

4. Pest control—Includes disease, insect,

and weed control.

5. Proper turf management—Mow grass to

proper heights. Leave trimmings as a
mulch to improve soil and water reten-
tion, fertilizing, and top-dressing. Proper
watering is also important to maintain a
healthy lawn, and to avoid waste, runoff,
and water pollution. (See Chapter 14 for
more information and publications about
establishing and maintaining a lawn.)

B. Water Management

Match the irrigation program to the plants’
moisture requirements, the time of the year,
and soil types. Important components of a
good water management program include:
1. Proper timing and duration of watering—
Deep and infrequent waterings are better
than shallow frequent waterings. Deep
water evergreen trees and shrubs before
the ground freezes in the winter.

2. Match sprinklers and irrigation schedul-
ing to plants and planting areas—Trees
and shrubs require less frequent watering
than turf and herbaceous ornamentals.

3. Monitor and maintain the irrigation sys-
tem frequently to prevent runoff, waste,
and pollution.

Landscape Plants

S. M. Bell

Susan M. Bell, Extension Educator, Ada County, Boise

I. Why Ornamental Plants?

Landscape plants are placed as they are for
various purposes: to create shade, to define
space, to enhance architecture, to provide food
(e.g., fruit trees), and to further general aesthet-
ics. These plants should be installed according
to a plan, so that they are correctly selected and
placed to create the desired design effect.
Plantings should be in tune with the environ-
mental situation and take into account such
things as exposure, amount of light, pH, water
availability, and soil type.
Trees and shrubs will last in the landscape for
many years. However, when a stress is im-
posed on a plant, that plant becomes much
more susceptible to other problems, including
insects and disease. A large percentage of land-
scape plant problems can be related directly to
improper selection of plant material and im-
proper cultural practices that lead to plant
stress. In some cases, the effects of improper
cultural practices may not be seen for years.

II. Soils and Water Considerations

A. Soil Composition

Soils are roughly 50 percent solid material
and 50 percent pore space. (Pores are holes
in the soil that are either filled with air or
water.)
1. Pore space, ideally, should be 50 percent

air and 50 percent water.
a. Air is necessary for root respiration

and normal metabolism, including the
uptake of water.

b. Water is used in transpiration within
the plant and for the transport of dis-
solved mineral nutrients from the soil
to roots and on up the plant through the
xylem.

2. The solid material is composed of or-

ganic matter, decomposed rock, and vari-
ous biological life.

B. Water Status Definitions

1. Hygroscopic water—Tightly bound to the

soil particles; not available for plant
growth.

2. Capillary or available water—Held less

tightly to soil particles; available for plant
usage.

3. Gravitational water—Moves with the

force of gravity; drains away. This water
is not available to the plant.

4. Saturated conditions—Tend to exclude
air; detrimental to most plants (with the
exception of aquatic species).

C. Water Movement

1. The thicker the film of water, the greater

the ease of movement in the soil. The
thinner the film of water, the harder it is
to move through the soil, therefore, be-
coming less readily available to plants.
2. Water movement is always from wetter

areas in the soil mass to drier areas.
a. When water is lost from the soil sur-

face (through evaporation), more water
is drawn up from lower levels.

b. When a plant draws water in through
the roots, more water moves into the
area.

c. Roots do not seek water; roots grow

where water is.

D. Soil Structure (Aggregate Size)

1. Soil particles may be made up of many

small particles clumped together.
a. Spaces (macropores) between large
particles contain air for root respira-
tion.

Chapter 16, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

16 - 2

b. Spaces between smaller particles and

within very large particles contain cap-
illary (available) water. Water also is
found on the surface of larger par-
ticles.

3. Add tile to create good drainage.
4. Contour slope away from plants so that

water runs off.

5. Break through hardpan layers.

2. Increase aggregate size by:

III. Planting and Site Preparation

a. Adding of calcium (usually gypsum):

Only works with clay soils.

b. Adding organic matter: Water and air
are found in and between the organic
matter particles. Organic matter loos-
ens a clay soil for better air and water
movement. In sandy soils, organic
matter helps hold water and nutrients.

E. Drainage Problems

1. Hard, compacted soil—Air space

squeezed out; low infiltration, little air
space, and slow drainage.

2. Impenetrable layers—Clay layers, hard-
pan, and plowpans, etc.; may not allow
water or roots through.

3. Fine-textured soil—Preferable over a

coarse-textured soil or gravel.
a. At the interface, water cannot move

rapidly into coarse soil; consequently,
moisture is limited or not continuous.

Note: The interface is where one soil type

stops and another begins.

b. Water movement downward is im-

peded across the interface, and much
of the finer soil’s pore space may fill
with water.

4. Coarse-textured soils over or contained

within a fine-textured soil.
a. Drainage through coarse soils is rapid.
b. Infiltration into fine soils is slow, caus-
ing macropores in the coarse soil to fill
with water.

c. Roots lack oxygen and root rots may

ensue.

d. Add organic matter to the coarse soil

to slow water penetration.
F. Overcoming Drainage Problems

1. Till by adding 3 to 4 inches of organic

matter.

2. Raise plant slightly above grade and cre-
ate a bed with good soil, or a raised bed.

A. Types of Plant Materials

1. Bareroot (B.R.)—Dug without a ball of

soil; little or no soil around the roots. Ex-
amples: dormant deciduous shrubs, roses,
deciduous trees, and small evergreens.
2. Balled and burlapped (B and B)—Dug

with soil that is enclosed in burlap or
some sort of synthetic material. The root
system has been cut for easier handling
and transport.

3. Field-potted—Dug with or without soil

and potted into a container.

4. Container—Plant grown for a time in a

container.

B. Planting

1. Bareroot

a. Cut back damaged or broken roots.
b. Dig hole twice as large as the root sys-

tem.

c. Put the plant in the hole at the same
level it grew originally. Build a cone
or mound of soil at the bottom of the
hole under the plant for support and to
aid in spreading the roots. Be sure the
roots are spread.

d. Backfill with native, not amended,

soil.

e. Water thoroughly.
f. Fertilize with a high phosphate fertil-
izer (5-10-10) or a balanced slow-re-
lease fertilizer (10-10-10). Fertilizers
may be added to a backfill material.
Fertilizer may also be added to the soil
surface after watering. Always follow
label directions as to amount.

2. Balled and burlapped.

a. Dig hole twice as wide as the ball of

soil.

b. Remove all of the rope, twine, or

string on the ball after setting it in po-
sition in the hole. The burlap can be
sliced on the sides, and the top burlap

Chapter 16, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

16 - 3

should be laid back so that no burlap is
exposed above ground. Burlap ex-
posed above ground will wick mois-
ture away from the root ball. Synthetic
or plastic burlaps should be removed
totally. Unless B and B trees have
been kept in burlap for a long time,
don’t worry about girdling roots or
cutting damaged roots.

c. Follow steps d through f of Section B,

subsection 1.
3. Container plant.

a. Dig hole twice as wide for root system

spread.

b. Remove container, no matter what

type.

c. Roots.

•

•

If the roots are not circling
(potbound), carefully spread the ex-
terior roots outward, away from the
soil ball.
If the roots are circling, make three
to four vertical cuts into the sides of
the root ball (1/4 to 1/2 inch into the
ball). If the roots are woody and
cannot be cut with a knife, lay the
ball on its side. Using a sharpened
spade or shovel slice through the
lower half of the root ball. This is
called “butterflying.” Spread out the
two flaps of roots and place in
planting hole so the top of the root
system is level with, or slightly
higher, than the surrounding soil.
When butterflying, be sure not to
damage the crown by splitting too
close to the trunk. Make sure the
split area is filled with soil so that
no air spaces are left.

d. Follow steps d through f of Section B,

subsection 1.

C. Pruning After Planting

1. Leave as much of the crown intact as

possible, and remove only dead, injured,
and diseased branches.

2. Remove interfering, rubbing, or poorly

placed branches.

3. Remove a branch from narrow “V”

crotches or multiple leaders.

4. Prune to shape, if necessary.

D. Staking

1. Avoid staking unless wind is a problem.
Stake as low on the stem as possible and
remove the stake after 1 year.

2. Reasons for staking.

a. To anchor plant until it can root into

the soil.

b. To protect the tree from slanting with

the wind.

c. To straighten a crooked trunk.

3. Used mostly for B.R. and B and B plants.
4. One- and two-stake methods.

IV. Plant Problems

Problems associated with plant roots may
show up in other plant parts, especially the
leaves.
A. Circling Roots/Potbound

1. Symptoms—A general decline of plant

vigor over a period of time.

2. Causes—Plant remaining in container too

long at some stage of development, not
necessarily the last stage of production.
3. Remedies—“Butterfly” the root ball, or
cut and spread the roots before planting.

B. Girdling Roots

1. Symptoms—Girdling roots limit water
and nutrient transport causing deteriora-
tion of the plant. Top growth diminishes;
plant is stressed.

2. Causes—An impenetrable planting hole;
twisting the plant after setting into hole;
bending roots to fit into a hole that is too
small; and planting potbound or
rootbound container stock.

3. Remedies—Chop off girdling root;

spread roots when planting; remove de-
bris or rocks in planting area.

C. Kinked Roots/One-Sided Root System

1. Symptoms—A general decline of plant

vigor over a period of time.

2. Causes—Improper production methods

(such as dragging with a mechanical
planter causing “J” hooked roots or jam-
ming the plant in the pot or the planting
hole).

Chapter 16, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

16 - 4

3. Remedies—Cut off kinked roots when

planting; carefully spread and straighten
the roots.

D. Root Rots

1. Symptoms—Soft, brown, partially to to-
tally decayed roots resulting in wilting or
death of the plant.

2. Causes—Cause varies with susceptibility

of the plant. There might not have been
enough soil aeration; the water table
might be high; the backfill might have
been amended with fresh manures when
planting; or the soil might be water-
logged.

3. Remedies—Improve downward and lat-
eral drainage; tile, if necessary; and plant
in raised beds. Select a water-loving spe-
cies of plant and amend the soil to im-
prove drainage.

E. Changing Soil Grades

1. Symptoms—No buttressing or flaring

roots at tree base; general decline of tree;
leaves and branches die from top down;
collar rots are evident. The decline may
take several years to occur or to com-
plete. Susceptibility varies with species.

2. Causes—Filling with soil or pavement on

top of an established root system results
in a decreased air supply to the plant
changing drainage and water patterns.

3. Remedies—Cover roots with a thick

layer of gravel, then with soil. Provide
drainage, and in some cases, welling the
trunk will help.

Note: Welling is the building of a “well” or
wall around the tree several feet out to
keep soil away from the trunk.

F. Trenching/Cutting Roots

1. Symptoms—Cutting roots reduces water

and nutrient uptake. The decline may
take several years to occur or complete.
Cuts can become infected with root rot
leading to the decline of plant growth.
The result is often the death of a tree
from the top downward. Sometimes the
decline is limited to that half of the tree
with the cut or damaged roots.

2. Causes—Removing top layers of soil to

change a grade or damaging roots by cut-
ting.

3. Remedies—Avoid cutting large roots;

fertilize and water the rest of the root sys-
tem; use a high phosphorus fertilizer to
encourage new root development.

G. Compaction

1. Symptoms—Decline of the tree from the

top down.

2. Cause—Soil compaction after the plant is

in the ground.

3. Remedies—Direct foot traffic and ma-
chinery away from the dripline of trees.
Aerate soil using a core aerator or cush-
ion the soil with a thick mulch.

V. Stem Problems

Stem maladies usually arise from improper
cultural practices and stresses to the plant.
A. Heart Rot

1. Symptoms—Decay of heartwood.
2. Causes—Improper pruning, topping,

breakage, or wounding of the stem or the
large branches.

3. Remedies—Prune properly and avoid

wounding. Remove decayed branch
wood; if rot is in an advanced stage, re-
move the tree.

B. Stem Wounds

1. Symptoms—Cankers, girdling, holes,

splits, and oozing.

2. Causes—Various, including hitting the
tree with lawn mowers and string weed-
ers; leaving support wires or B and B
string around stem; diseases, borers, and
sunscald.

3. Remedies—Stay away from plant stems
and trunks with equipment. Remove all
lawn grass to at least 1 foot from the
trunk. Keep all mulch 2 to 3 inches from
plant stems. Identify and treat insects or
disease. Remove labels and ties when
planting. Painting or spraying with tree
wound compound does not improve heal-
ing, but it may prevent insect entry.

C. Sunscald or Southwest Disease

1. Symptoms—Bark tends to be blistered,
burnt, dead, or split on the southern or

Chapter 16, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

16 - 5

southwestern sides of the trunk. Young
and newly transplanted trees are the most
susceptible.

2. Causes—Alternating freezing and thaw-
ing of bark on sunny side of tree during
winter. Intense heat during summer.

3. Remedies—Shade south and southwest
sides of trunk; wrap the trunk with tree
wrap or paint with white, water-based
(latex) paint. If there is an advanced stage
of damage, carefully remove any dead
bark, apply tree wound dressing, and
wrap to keep insects out of heartwood.

D. Branch Rots and Infections

1. Symptoms—Oozing, cankers, holes, and

splits.

2. Causes—Improper pruning. Branch stubs
or flush cuts leave a tree open to disease
and insects.

3. Remedies—Prune correctly; cut back

only to the branch collar; do not top trees.
Treat insects and diseases when first no-
ticed.

E. Damage to Crotch Areas

1. Symptoms—Splits, oozing at crotch.
2. Causes—Narrow “V” crotches, borers,

water gathering in crotch.

3. Remedies—Prune out all but one of the
leaders if the tree is young and has mul-
tiple leaders. Narrow branch angles can
be spread when the tree is young; cable
or brace narrow crotches if the tree is
older to prevent breakage.

F. Freeze Damage

1. Symptoms—Blackened tissue; dead

twigs or buds; death of plant. Stem die-
back. Usually younger stems die, but
older wood also can be damaged during
severe winters. There is generally a par-
tial to total necrosis of the young leaves.
Older leaves may become distorted later.
New growth might have been frozen by
late spring frost when plant was in the
soft-growth stage.

2. Causes—Lethal winter temperatures and

early or late frosts.

3. Remedies—Use frost prevention meth-
ods; select trees and shrubs specified for

your zone; do not fertilize trees and
shrubs after July 1.
G. Graft Incompatibility

1. Symptoms—Large overgrowths above

and below union; earlier than normal fall
coloration; a stem that breaks off at graft.

2. Cause—Incompatibility between scion

and stock.

3. Remedy—Purchase plants rooted from

cuttings or use a reliable source of
grafted stock.

VI. Leaf Problems

Problems with stems and roots often will show
up in the leaves. If a plant is wilted, the leaves
are either not getting enough water or are los-
ing water faster than it is being supplied by the
roots. Determine the cause of wilting. There
also are many insects and diseases that affect
leaves.
A. Drought

1. Symptoms—Wilting, drying of soft

growth, and blotchy necrosis.

2. Causes—Extended periods of dryness.

High heat/bright sunlight on shade-loving
plants could cause leaf scorch, early leaf
drop, or marginal and interveinal chloro-
sis or necrosis.

3. Remedies—Water plant; provide better

soil preparation by adding organic matter
to increase water-holding capacity; mulch
to reduce surface evaporation. Select
drought-tolerant plants. Shade plant; mist
periodically for temporary cooling.

B. Frost Damage

1. Symptoms—Partial to total necrosis of
young leaves or buds. Older leaves may
become distorted if buds were injured.

2. Causes—New growth frozen by late

spring frost when the plant is in the soft
growth stage.

C. Root Injury

1. Symptoms—Wilting, early leaf drop, leaf

chlorosis, root damage, necrosis, and
plant death.

2. Causes—Root damage due to trenching,
insects (such as root weevils), or disease.
Overwatering limits oxygen uptake by
roots and encourages root rot.

Chapter 16, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

16 - 6

3. Remedies—Determine the cause, then

take appropriate action. If the cause is not
a root rot, then proper watering of the re-
maining root system will help. Fertiliza-
tion with a high phosphorus fertilizer
may help rejuvenate the root system. If
overwatering is the problem, increase
drainage and cut back on water. If a high
water table or poor drainage exists,
choose water-loving plants (such as a
willow).

D. Vascular System Injury

1. Symptoms—Wilting or drying of a por-

tion of the plant.

2. Causes—Disease, such as Verticillium

wilt, can plug the xylem vessels.

3. Remedies—Determine the cause and take

appropriate action. Remove the infected
portion; treat for Verticillum.

E. Salt Damage

1. Symptoms—Marginal to interveinal

chlorosis/necrosis; rootlets are brown in-
stead of white.

2. Causes—Salts from excessive use of

commercial fertilizers, manures, and de-
icing salts. The latter may be more preva-
lent next to sidewalks and driveways.
3. Remedies—Leach with water, if pos-

sible; limit the use of offending materials.
Alternate organic fertilizers with com-
mercial fertilizers to reduce salt buildup.

F. Leaf Chlorosis and Nutrient Deficiencies

1. Nitrogen deficiency.

a. Symptoms: Overall yellowing of older

leaves first. Stunted growth of plant.
Pale green color on rest of plant.

b. Cause: Nitrogen deficiency.
c. Remedy: Fertilize with a nitrogen fer-

tilizer.

2. High pH (over 7.5).

a. Symptoms: Interveinal chlorosis, light

green to white in color (with zinc,
older leaves affected; with iron, new
leaves affected first). The margins of
leaves may become necrotic, but the
veins remain green. With zinc defi-
ciency, leaves may be small, narrow,
and thickened. Foliage loss may be

early, and leaves at tips of branches
may be bushy with few or none along
the branch. Manganese deficiency is
similar to iron deficiency, but chloro-
sis is not so dominant on young leaves.
Also there is severe browning and
dropping of leaves with maturity.

b. Cause: Iron, zinc, or manganese defi-

ciencies because of the soil pH.

c. Remedies: A long-term solution is to

decrease soil pH. A temporary solution
is to apply the deficient nutrient. You
may need to make annual spring or fall
applications.

3. Other causes of leaf chlorosis.

a. Wrong soil pH for acid-loving plants.

Example: azaleas.

b. Herbicides (see Subsection G of this

section and Table 1).

c. Drought (see Section VI, subsection

A).

d. Natural leaf maturity and abscission in

autumn.

e. Natural variegation.

G. Herbicide Damage

Herbicides are formulated to be toxic to spe-
cific weeds, but they also may cause dam-
age to desirable plants.
1. Symptoms—Some herbicides act hor-

monally and produce a twisted, cupped,
puckered, or distorted growth. Other her-
bicides inhibit photosynthesis and chloro-
phyll formation, causing a peculiar col-
oration or characteristic chlorosis de-
pending on the material used (see Table 1
on next page). In general, if many plants
in one area are affected with unusual
twisting, puckering, or with strange col-
orations and drying leaves, chemical or
herbicide misuse may be the culprits. If
only part of the conifer root system is af-
fected by a herbicide, the damage may
create a spiral pattern on the stem of the
plant.

2. Causes—Most people do not know where

the root zones of desirable plants are;
consequently, they overspray, and trans-
location of the herbicide into a desirable
plant occurs.

Chapter 16, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

16 - 7

2. Causes—When used for insect and mite
control on needled evergreens, dormant
oil may cause burns, especially if the
concentration is too high, if the oil is ap-
plied during freezing weather, or if the
plant has started to grow.

from misapplication and misuse. Few
problems arise when label directions are
followed closely and the broadcasted ma-
terial is kept 5 to 10 feet away from the
dripline of desirable plants. Spot treat
weeds rather than broadcast when possible.

H. Insecticide Injury

1. Symptoms—Dormant oil will remove the

waxy bloom that gives the blue cast to
Colorado Blue Spruce Oils used on de-
ciduous plants that have started to show
green will burn exposed green tissue.
Some insecticides, such as malathion,
will burn leaves when applied during

Woody Ornamentals

JoAnn Robbins and Kevin Laughlin

JoAnn Robbins, Extension Educator, Jerome County, Jerome

Kevin Laughlin, Extension Educator, Ada County, Boise

I. Introduction

Woody ornamental plants are perennials with
stiff woody stems. They are loosely classified as
trees, shrubs, or vines.

A. Trees usually have a single trunk and can

grow to impressive heights. The tallest trees
are the California redwoods (Sequoia
sempervirens), which grow to 350 feet or
more. Trees can develop—or be pruned to
grow— several trunks. If a mature single- or
multi-trunk woody plant is less than about
20 feet tall, it is not considered to be a tree.
B. Shrubs are less than 20 feet tall at maturity
and have multiple trunks. Standards, which
are shrubs trained to grow with a single
trunk, may serve as small trees in the land-
scape, but because they had to be trained
this way, they are still considered to be
shrubs. Woody shrubs may spread by under-
ground roots or rhizomes. Very short woody
shrubs make good ground covers.

C. Vines may climb, trail, creep, or even re-

main erect with some support to their stems.
Woody vines may root at various places
along their stems, wherever they come in
good contact with the ground and have the
proper growing conditions. Climbing vines
such as ivy may attach to supports with
small aerial roots. Grapes can climb by
winding slender stems called tendrils around
objects.
Some plants will perplex the expert horti-
culturist and the Master Gardener by defy-
ing classification with the above system.
Crabapples are a good example. Some insist
on growing with multiple stems, yet are
greater than 15 feet tall at maturity. Others

are natural, single-stemmed beauties, reach-
ing only 5 feet at maturity. Some weeping
forms, if grown on their own rootstocks,
would creep across the ground. So,
crabapples can be large shrubs, tiny trees, or
even vines! Thus, use the tree, shrub, or
vine classification only in a general sense.

II. The Art of Designing with

Woody Ornamentals
Woody ornamentals form much of the structure
in landscape design and contribute to a pleasing
composition. They define the skyline and become
the structural element dividing space. Landscap-
ers must carefully consider choices and initial
placement. Established trees and shrubs cannot be
moved simply. Within the principles of design
(see Chapter 15), woody ornamentals serve the
following purposes:

A. Balance—Tree and shrub placement,

whether symmetrical or asymmetrical, cre-
ates equilibrium in the landscape. Trees and
shrubs provide the coordinating composi-
tion for other elements contributed by annu-
als, perennials, and garden features such as
fences and decks.

B. Movement—The repetition or alternation of
shrubs and trees can carry the eye through-
out the landscape. The rhythm created is an
underlying theme of the landscape. Increas-
ing heights of shrubs and trees draws the
eye skyward.

C. Harmony—Trees and shrubs serve as a

dominant feature or accent in a landscape,
thus contributing to the harmony of the de-
sign. Repetition of structural elements such
as woody ornamentals helps to tie the land-

scape together. The interconnectedness of a
low woody ground cover under trees or of a
line of shrubs or trees provides a continuity
that creates harmony in the landscape.

III. Which Woody Ornamentals

to Plant and Where
A. Plant Selection—Of the many factors to
consider in choosing plants, two are most
important.
1. Size: During most of its life span, will the

plant be of a size suitable for the loca-
tion?

2. Site suitability: Is the plant adapted to

grow where it will be planted?

B. Plant function, color, texture, shape, bloom
date, rate of growth, and how well the plants
relate to other elements of the design are
additional important considerations. In re-
cent years, special uses (theme gardens or
patios) or adaptations (natives, Xeriscape)
have played an increasingly important role
in landscape planning and plant selection.
See Table 1 for a summary of plant charac-
teristics and uses and site considerations.
See Chapter 15 for planning guidelines.

C. The following considerations apply specifi-

cally to woody ornamentals.
1. Function—Woody ornamentals should be

chosen with a specific function in mind,
which may be as simple as providing
shade. Some functions are:
a. Firescapes: Landscaping for fire pre-
vention, or “firescaping,” is particu-
larly important for suburban and rural
locations in dry areas near hillsides
and in narrow canyons surrounded by
thick stands of trees and brushy open
spaces. Homeowners should clear
brush from within 30 to 400 feet of
dwellings and outbuildings. Select
woody plants that resist fire or that do
not have high levels of oil or resin.
Plants should have foliage with high
moisture content or low brush and lit-
ter potential. Avoid designs that place
plants of different heights in the form
of a “fire ladder.” Fire ladders provide
a continuous fuel supply from the
ground up to the plant canopy.

b. Screening and barriers: Windbreaks,

shelterbelts, woody plant borders, and
screens are all made up of rows of
woody plants of various shapes and
sizes. They reduce wind velocity, cap-
ture snow, stop erosion, and shelter
wildlife. Besides providing beauty,
they provide protection from unsightly
views, disturbing sounds, dust, and, to
some extent, they modify atmospheric
pollutants. The right sequence of

woody ornamentals reduces heavy
wind around the home, farmstead, and
park or recreation area while permit-
ting breezes to enter.
Screening and barriers consist of one
to eight rows of trees and shrubs.
Where space permits, several rows of
shrubs and trees of various sizes and
habits, both deciduous and evergreen,
can be used. To serve as a windbreak,
the plantings should be at right angles
to prevailing winds. Where drifting
snow is a problem, the home should be
at least 60 feet beyond the last row of
the planting. Careful attention to the
design of entries and exits of sites will
prevent snow or soils drifting into ac-
cess routes. Windbreaks must be care-
fully tended to become effective and
must be kept weeded, mulched, or cul-
tivated (see PNW 5, “Trees Against
the Wind,” for more information about
windbreaks).

c. Energy efficiency: Trees can reduce

utility bills and improve the comfort of
your home. In summer, trees on the
southern and western sides of struc-
tures can block the hot sunlight,
thereby reducing the need for air con-
ditioning. In winter, these same de-
ciduous trees, less their leaves, allow
the sun’s heating rays through to warm
your house. Also, the blocking of cold
winter winds by shelterbelts can re-
duce heating expenses, especially in
homes with poor insulation or air
leaks.

d. Xeriscape: In a Xeriscape, plants are

chosen that are drought-tolerant in or-
der to conserve water. With this ap-
proach, all the plants in a given area
must have the same water-use require-
ments.

e. Natives: Native plants are becoming
increasingly popular in Idaho land-
scapes. Native woody ornamentals of-
ten have lower water demands, fewer
pest problems, and lower fertilizer
needs than introduced ornamentals.
Native plants should always be consid-

ered first for conservation plantings
and ecosystem restoration. Natives not
only make sense due to their adapta-
tion to existing climatic conditions, but
also bring a rich diversity of texture
and color to home gardens. For natu-
ralized plantings, native species are
often the best selection.
Keep in mind that even though the
plant may be native, it needs adequate
water, especially right after being
planted. After plants are established,
you can reduce watering for those that
thrive in the wild with little moisture.
The goal is to duplicate in your yard
the growing conditions of the plant’s
natural habitat.
When electing to use natives for your
landscape, purchase them from a repu-
table nursery rather than collect them
from the wild. Wild collection puts
pressure on wild plant communities
and introduces diseases and insects
found in wild conditions to your yard.
The one exception to this rule is rescu-
ing or salvaging plants that are facing
destruction by construction.
In order to have well-adapted native
plants, start with native plants propa-
gated from plants growing as close to
your garden as possible. This will also
help prevent degradation of the gene
pool of existing native plant popula-
tions in your area.

2. Growth characteristics—Growth charac-
teristics of woody ornamentals influence
the ability to fulfill a specific function in
the landscape.
a. Exposure: Select woody plants accord-

ing to the exposure they’ll be sub-
jected to. Plants may be labeled (1)
full sun, partial shade, or (2) partial
sun, full shade, or (3) shade. Check the
genus and species in several references
to gain a perspective on the range of
exposures a plant can be grown in.
Some species can grow under many
conditions, but specific cultivars may
fit only into one category.

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

17 - 4

b. Growth rate: Woody plants are desig-

nated as slow, medium, or fast growers
in the nursery trade. The rate of
growth refers to the vertical increase
unless specified differently. Be sure to
compare mature height listed on the
retail tag with the height of plants ac-
tually growing in your area.

c. Growth habit: Woody ornamentals can
grow prostrate, horizontal, or upright;
they can be dwarf or standard in size.
Growth shapes include round, globe,
vase-shaped, pyramidal, and columnar
(Fig. 1). Plant propagators select these
growth habits and plant shapes for ar-
tistic, space-saving, or ornamental pur-
poses. Some cultivars are selected for
weeping or contorted forms.

d. Foliage density: Most coniferous ever-

greens and some deciduous trees and
shrubs have very dense foliage; thus,
the shadows cast by them form dense
shade, affecting growing conditions.
Trees with dense foliage are very ef-
fective at blocking unpleasant views.
Most deciduous trees create filtered
shade, and distant views can be
glimpsed through their foliage.

e. Crown size and height: Knowing the
approximate size at maturity of trees,
shrubs, and groundcovers allows the
landscaper to plant them where they
can develop to maturity. Plant descrip-
tions generalize height and spread, or
width of a plant, based on average
growing conditions. Mature height and
spread is greatly influenced by the
length of the growing season, tempera-
ture, light, water, soil type, fertility,
and other factors. This makes it impos-
sible to predict the exact mature size of
a plant.
Trees, shrubs, and ground covers can
be categorized by height into: large
trees (50 feet and over); medium trees
(25 to 50 feet); small trees (under 25
feet); large shrubs (8 feet and over);
medium shrubs (5 to 8 feet); small
shrubs (3 to 5 feet); very small shrubs
(under 3 feet); tall ground covers (un-
der 2 feet); and short ground covers
(under 1 foot).

f. Longevity: Short-lived trees and shrubs
are often quick growing and will give
height and bulk in a short period of
time. They may be susceptible to pests
and weather-related problems. Long-
lived species have strong trunks,
sturdy wide-crotched branches, and
tend to tolerate winter storms, pests,
and human damage.

g. Hardiness zones: Select plants adapted

to your climatic zone. There are sev-
eral types of hardiness zone maps. The
most commonly used one is that devel-
oped by the USDA (see Fig. 1, Chap-
ter 15, page 15-3). Other maps include
the Arnold Arboretum Hardiness
Zones, the Sunset Western Garden
Book Climate Zones, and the heat
zone map of the American Horticul-
tural Society.
Whichever map you use, the zone con-
cept is a useful tool to give you an idea
of how well adapted a particular plant
is to your particular climate. When
choosing woody ornamentals that will
be long lasting and have dominant fea-

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

17 - 5

tures of your landscape, it is essential
to choose plants that will not be dam-
aged by an extreme climatic event. Be
conservative in your choice and plant
woody ornamentals adapted to one
zone colder than your zone.

h. Salt tolerance: Salt accumulation plays
an important role in woody ornamental
performance. In arid regions, soluble
salts have accumulated at the depth to
which soil moisture soaks each season.
These salts can be brought to the sur-
face with irrigation. If water sources
contain high levels of salt, woody or-
namentals can be injured. Salt used for
winter ice removal on roads can also
cause problems.
Too much salt interferes with the
plant’s ability to take up water, caus-
ing leaf burn and decline. Even salt-
tolerant plants will not grow where salt
levels are high. Plants native to a re-
gion have adapted to existing salt con-
ditions.

3. Ornamental characteristics—Ornamental
characteristics of the plant such as flow-
ering, fragrance, foliage color, foliage
texture, plant color, etc. must be consid-
ered by gardeners and landscapers during
the selection process (Table 1).
The style of the garden needs to be con-
sidered as well. Whether the garden is
cottage, Mediterranean, tropical, oriental,
formal, artistic, avant-garde, rustic, natu-
ralized, or native plays a key role in the
types of woody ornamentals selected. Fi-
nally, how the garden will be used and
maintained should also guide design and
plant decisions.
Plants that accent, define boundaries,
and/or are a special feature must be se-
lected with specific goals in mind. Nu-
merous landscaping books, computer
programs, and publications can assist the
plant selection process (see Further Read-
ing). More on arranging the form, shape,
and space of woody ornamentals is cov-
ered in Chapter 15.

D. Site Considerations—Site analysis (climate,

soil type, water availability, hardscapes,

utility location, aspect, access, etc.) is cov-
ered in Chapter 15.
In choosing plants, introduced pests
(bronze birch borer, Dutch-elm disease,
etc.) must also be considered. In order to
minimize maintenance and the need for
pest control, selecting the right plant for
the existing conditions is essential. Even
features such as dropped fruit, seed pods,
or resulting seedlings must be considered.

IV. Getting Started with Woody

Ornamentals

During the planning stage, make sure to find out
what species will grow in your locality and make
a scale drawing of your site to provide a basic
plan that you can use and update. As trees and
shrubs are essential elements of this plan, choose
and buy them wisely and then plant them prop-
erly so you can have years of pleasure.
A. Purchasing Woody Ornamentals

Plants can be purchased from local nurser-
ies, retail outlets that seasonally bring in
wholesale nursery stock for resale, mail or-
der companies, farmers’ markets, nursery
cooperatives, or at special plant sales spon-
sored by service or gardening organizations.
Select only vigorously growing plants that
are in good soil and are correctly labeled.
They should be well-maintained and insect,
weed, and disease free. Check the graft
unions on plants that require this type of
propagation. Beware of “good deals” at the
end of the summer, for these plants may be
stressed or root bound.
1. Local nurseries—Local nursery operators
know the planting dates of your area and
have experience with varieties suited to
local needs and common problems. They
also have selected plants that are adapted
to your climatic conditions or soils. In
many cases, local nursery operators are
willing to special-order plants not in
stock. In addition, they will generally
guarantee the plants they sell.
If you personally select your plants, have
your plan and plant list in hand when you
visit the nursery. Be open to new ideas
and plants offered by plant professionals.

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

17 - 6

If you are buying several plants, request a
volume discount.

2. Local retailers with nursery stock—Plants
purchased from discount, hardware, drug,
convenience, grocery, or produce stores
may not be appropriate for your land-
scape. Prices are often lower due to vol-
ume discounts, the species may not be
well adapted to your area, and plant
maintenance may be lacking.

3. Mail order—Check over the catalogs

carefully to make sure the plants meet all
the criteria in your planting plan. Mail
order plants will be bare root or potted.
Plant size may be small, but if shipped
correctly and planted promptly, they gen-
erally perform well in your yard or gar-
den. When ordering over the phone or by
mail order, insist on the same quality as
from a local nursery. If you are not satis-
fied, return the item and request a refund.
Most mail order nurseries guarantee the
plants they sell.

4. Special plant sales—Service organiza-
tions, garden clubs, schools, or public
agencies occasionally hold plant sales.
This is a great opportunity to obtain rare
or prized woody ornamentals from local
sources. You may want to quarantine the
plants in a holding area before planting
them into your garden to avoid introduc-
ing new pests into your landscape.
If offered plants by gardening friends that
don’t fit your landscape plan, are not
healthy, or might become invasive, have
the courage to decline their offer.

B. Genetic Adaptability

The climatic zones where the plant material
for propagation is collected influences the
ability of plants to adapt to new locations.
This genetic makeup allows plants to per-
form well under one set of conditions and
completely fail in others. Many plants are
adapted across several climatic zones or
hardiness categories. This hardiness is ge-
netically determined.
For native plants that are propagated from
seeds, it is generally true that the more
southern the seed source, the less hardy the
plant. For example, the red maple, Acer

rubrum, is native from Florida to Canada.
Trees grown from a southern seed source
will be less hardy than those grown from a
northern source. The same might be said for
plants grown on the East Coast and then
planted in the West. This ability is often
called plasticity among professional horti-
culturists and should be considered in se-
lecting woody ornamental plants.

C. Planting Woody Ornamentals

The techniques required for successful
transplanting of woody plants depend upon
the kind of plant; its age and size; whether it
is dormant or growing; its nutritional status;
whether it is nursery grown, growing around
the home, or a native plant; the species
adaptability to the selected site; and the site
conditions and climate of the area. For more
information on this topic, see Chapter 16.

V. Maintenance of Woody Ornamentals

A. The First Season

The first year in a new site is critical for a
woody ornamental. Survival is determined
by care and conditions, and a good start
helps a landscape planting fill in more
quickly.
1. Water new plants to a depth of at least 2

feet at each irrigation. Soil type and
drainage will determine the frequency.
Generally, irrigation will be required ev-
ery 5 to 7 days. Soil should drain and dry
between waterings to allow adequate
oxygen in the root zone and to reduce the
possibility of root rot pathogen develop-
ment. New plants will wilt in saturated
soil due to a lack of oxygen around the
roots. Light, shallow watering does not
provide enough water to develop a wide,
deep, root system, and aids in the deposit
of harmful salts.

2. Do not fertilize during the first season.
Excess fertilizer salts in the root zone
damages the limited root system of a
newly planted plant. Plants need a season
to establish a vigorous root system before
fertilizer pushes more foliage growth.
3. Newly planted shrubs and trees may be

protected from the wind by erecting a
barrier of burlap or other material or

wrapping. When wrapping, don’t use
plastic because it gets too hot under it.
Bury small or horizontal plants in leaves
or loose, unfinished compost after the
first frost.
The first winter in a new site for a woody
plant can spell life or death. Water less
frequently in the fall (see section B4 be-
low).

B. Irrigation of Woody Plants

Proper watering of woody ornamentals is
probably the most important aspect of plant
growth, beauty, and health. For more infor-
mation on water management, see Chapter
6.
1. Water requirement—The amount of water

needed by a woody plant is determined
by species, size, air temperature, air hu-
midity, light intensity, and wind move-
ment over the leaves. A hot, sunny, dry,
windy day adds up to a lot of water for a
large tree. Many sites in Idaho have just
such conditions.
The water-absorbing roots of trees occur
mostly in the top 12 to 18 inches of soil.
Their distribution extends well beyond
the dripline (Fig. 2). Apply water over
the entire absorbing zone. Expand water-
holding basins around the base of plants
on a yearly basis to accommodate the
previous year’s growth.
Irrigate to wet the soil to a depth of at

Dripline

2 feet

least 2 feet deep. The amount of water
needed depends on the soil type; sandy
soil holds less water than clay soil. As
with newly planted trees, avoid keeping
the root zone saturated in order to allow
proper root aeration. Avoid shallow, fre-
quent irrigation because this encourages
shallow and limited root development.

2. Irrigation methods—Flood irrigation is an
infrequent deep soaking. Accomplish the
same on a small scale by flooding the ba-
sin around trees or shrubs using a bubbler
hose attachment. This is the most effi-
cient method of irrigation for isolated
plants.
The most common method of irrigation is
the sprinkler. Be sure to apply enough
water to soak the root zone of trees and
shrubs. Enough water for the shallow
roots of a lawn will not be enough for
trees and shrubs. Sprinkling the foliage
of trees and shrubs can increase the po-
tential for some diseases. Minimize this
by sprinkling early in the morning so the
plant can dry off over the course of the
day.
Drip irrigation systems are extremely ef-
ficient and provide a slow source of wa-
ter that works better with heavy soil. Ap-
ply water away from the trunk and in the
area of water-absorbing roots. Update
drip systems by adding more lines or
emitters as the plants grow to provide
enough water for the larger plant and root
system.

3. Drainage—If you have a poorly drained

area, select plants adapted to wet soil
conditions. In extreme cases, install drain
tiles before planting to carry excess water
away from the planting site. Improve sur-
face drainage by changing the grade or
trenching.
Root zone aeration can help prevent pud-
dling and runoff. If simple aeration (pok-
ing holes at regular intervals) doesn’t
work, drill holes 6 to 18 inches deep and
backfill them with sand or pea gravel.
This is called vertical mulching.

4. Winter water management—In climates
where winters are cold and the ground is

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

17 - 8

frozen, special care must be taken to
make sure woody ornamentals enter the
winter completely dormant and yet have
an ample supply of sub-surface water to
get through the winter. To accomplish
this, gradually withhold water in late fall
(after mid-September). This decelerates
growth and helps the plant enter a dor-
mant state. Continue this drying for 4 to 6
weeks.
Sometime just before the first hard freeze
(October 15 to November 1), irrigate
thoroughly. Add enough water to fill the
entire root zone, and more, to capacity.
This stored moisture will be available to
the plant roots beneath the frozen layer of
soil during the winter. Fall watering is
particularly important for evergreens due
to the amount of water that needles and
leaves can lose on a sunny winter day.

C. Mulching Woody Ornamentals

The benefits of a mulched area around trees
and shrubs are five-fold: (1) elimination of
competition from weeds and grasses, (2)
conservation of soil moisture, (3) modera-
tion of the soil temperature, (4) protection
of trees from lawn mower and weed eater
damage, and (5) growth of a more extensive
root system.
1. How to mulch—The mulch layer should

be 2 to 3 inches in depth at least to the
dripline of the tree. Don’t place mulch
against the plant trunk or stems because
of the possibility of crown rot. Permeable
landscaping fabric beneath the mulch will
help control weeds. Do not use plastic as
it will reduce water and air infiltration in
the root zone.
Use of very fine or less permeable
mulches, such as sawdust, encourages
shallow rooting. Good mulches include
coarse compost, bark chips, rocks, or
gravel.

D. Symbiotic Relationships

Roots of many trees and shrubs form symbi-
otic relationships with fungi or bacteria.
1. Mycorrhizae—Mycorrhizal fungi live

around and sometimes in the plant roots,
obtaining carbohydrates, vitamins, and
other organic compounds from the plant.

The zone of soil around the root inhab-
ited by the fungi, known as the rhizo-
sphere, is more hospitable to nutrient ab-
sorption by plant roots because of the as-
sociation. Mycorrhizal fungi enhance the
plant’s tolerance of environmental ex-
tremes and its resistance to or tolerance
of pathogens. Many of the “mushrooms”
seen in the landscape at some distance
from trees are fruiting bodies of mycor-
rhizal fungi.
Commercial products are available that
contain a mixture of fungus types to mix
with the soil when planting trees and
shrubs. These are new products and more
research is needed to prove their value.
Although mycorrhizal spores are found in
most soil, preliminary studies suggest
these commercial products may speed the
establishment of a symbiotic relationship.
2. Nitrogen-fixing—On some woody plants,

specific bacteria induce nitrogen-fixing
root nodules. Black locust, alder,
ceanothus, and Russian olive, for ex-
ample, are able to fix nitrogen to use in
their own growth and for that of other
plants in the same area. This makes them
able to grow on nitrogen-poor sites.

E. Fertilizing Trees and Shrubs

Woody ornamentals require the essential
elements to function. Too much nitrogen
can promote excess growth that will only
require more pruning and water and in-
crease pests. On coniferous evergreens a
“spurt” of growth in reaction to fertilizer
can create whorls of branches further apart
at the top of the tree and tips of the
branches, detracting from the symmetry of
the tree. If a woody plant is healthy, show-
ing no nutrient deficiencies, and making sat-
isfactory growth, it probably does not need
to be fertilized. (see CIS 1068, “Fertilizing
Landscape Trees,” for more information,
including rate recommendations).

VI. Pruning

A. The Basics

In the home landscape, trees and shrubs
usually have ample light and space, and
they produce a lot of branches and grow to a

maximum size. Proper pruning shapes or
trains these plants into appropriate and
beautiful forms, while maintaining and aug-
menting their health and function.
Proper tools are essential for satisfactory
pruning (Fig. 3). The choice of which tool
to use depends largely on the size of
branches to be pruned and the amount of
pruning to be done. If possible, test a tool
before you buy it to ensure it suits your spe-
cific needs. As with most tools, higher qual-
ity often equates to higher cost.
1. Reasons for pruning—Training young

trees and shrubs to create attractive
shapes and a strong structure is always a
good reason. Prune older plants to re-
move dead, diseased, hazardous, or un-
sightly branches. Pruning to maintain a
central leader is sometimes necessary, as
is removal of branches that interfere with
activities and structures. Pruning can en-
hance flowering and fruiting. It can also
open up a tree for less wind resistance
and better light penetration. Shrubs may
need pruning to create a fuller look or to
maintain a special shape or form such as
in hedges.

Probably the worst reason to prune is to
control the size of the plant. You cannot
make a large woody plant small! Such
pruning is a temporary, expensive, and
damaging “fix.” The best solution is to
remove the too-large woody plant and
replace it with one whose mature size is
more suited to the growing space.

2. Timing—Do light pruning or removal of

dead wood at any time. On coniferous
evergreens, make heading cuts (see A3,
below) back to buds or light thinning cuts
at any time. The most common pruning
time is during winter, when the plants are
dormant. This results in vigorous spring
growth. Pruning coniferous evergreens
during the dormant season will maximize
regrowth, and cuts will be covered, mak-
ing the plant look more natural.
Prune plants that bloom on the current
season’s growth (new wood), such as Po-
tentilla sp., during the dormant period.
Wait until the coldest part of the winter
has passed but before buds swell. Some
plants such as maples, walnuts, birches,
and grapes may bleed when pruned just
before or during sap flow. Though un-
sightly, this does no harm to the plant and
will stop as the season progresses.
Prune plants that bloom on wood from
the previous year, such as lilac and for-
sythia, in the spring right after the flow-
ers fade. Winter pruning will decrease the
number of flowers the following spring.
Pruning coniferous evergreens after the
annual flush of spring growth will main-
tain size and preserve atypical, or
clipped, forms. Pruning off part of the
new growth while it is still growing will
reduce the length of new growth and en-
courage branching.
Summer pruning, done after spring
growth has stopped, slows the develop-
ment of a plant or branch. This is because
of reduced photosynthetic capacity from
fewer leaves, which reduces the amount
of food manufactured and sent to the
roots for their development and next
year’s growth of the crown. Prune in the
summer cautiously, as it can weaken the

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

tree or shrub to the point of death.
Late summer or fall is not a good time to
prune. Any new growth stimulated by
late summer pruning will be susceptible
to frost damage and the threat of intro-
ducing diseases is greater.

3. Pruning cuts—There are two basic prun-

ing cuts: thinning and heading (Fig. 4).
a. A thinning cut removes a branch back

to a lateral branch big enough to as-
sume the terminal role. The lateral
branch should be at least half the size
of the branch being removed. In other
words, if a branch 6 inches in diameter
is being removed, thin it back to one
no less than 3 inches in diameter.
Branches thinned can be smaller, the
same size as, or at the most, twice the
size of the branch being thinned to.
This type of cut opens up a tree, re-
duces the weight of limbs, can reduce
the overall height, evenly distributes
the invigorated new growth, and helps
retain the natural growth. Thinning
cuts are made at a point in the wood
where wounds can heal. This is the
preferred cut for ornamental trees.
Thinning cuts are also those on small
branchlets made to a bud that will
break and assume the terminal role.
b. A heading cut removes a branch to a

stub, to a small bud, or to a lateral

cuts.

branch not large enough to assume the
terminal role. This type of cut induces
branching and bushiness below the
cut. Heading cuts, which are com-
monly used for fruit trees, are usually
not appropriate for ornamentals espe-
cially trees. Numerous vigorous up-
right shoots arise below the cut, espe-
cially on larger branches, altering the
tree’s natural form.

c. “Topping” a tree is cutting all its major

branches back with heading cuts deep
into the center of the tree. Cutting the
top off a tree is NOT an acceptable
pruning practice. Topping results in an
ugly, deformed tree with weak
branches. These trees often become
infected with decay organisms and are
more susceptible to insects and dis-
eases. Within a few years, they are
back to their original height because of
bushy growth, but are ugly as well as
hazardous due to the weakly attached
numerous branches.

d. Cutting off the top of a coniferous tree
will result in multiple leaders or a flat
top—in any case, the natural shape of
the tree is destroyed. The older the ev-
ergreen tree is at topping, the less
likely a lateral will become a new
leader. Although the tree may appear
to be healthy, research has shown that
serious decay often develops at the
wound site. This decay moves down
the trunk, creating weakly attached lat-
eral branches and a hazardous tree.

4. Where to make the pruning cut—At the
base of branches there is a layer of cells
that is very important to plant health. If
the branch is broken off or dies, this layer
of cells fills with decay-blocking chemi-
cals such as terpenes and phenols and
forms a protective area that not only
keeps out decay, but facilitates healing.
The challenge for the person pruning off
the branch is to leave this layer of cells
intact so that it can do its work for the
tree.
The branch collar indicates the location
of this layer of cells. This is a slightly

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

17 - 11

swollen area where the branch attaches to
the trunk. Sometimes plants have a
branch bark ridge where the bark grows
upward because of the internal branch tis-
sue that separates the branch from the
trunk. Make pruning cuts just outside the
branch bark ridge and/or collar.

5. How to make the pruning cut—Cut

branches larger than about 2 inches with
an undercut three-step method to prevent
limb breakage and bark stripping (Fig. 5).
Cut part way through the branch at A.
Then cut completely through the branch
at B. The final cut is made at C to D, just
outside of the branch collar. Cut to pre-
serve the branch collar and the bark ridge.
Do not cut at C to X. Avoid removing
branches over 6 inches in diameter, as
bigger wounds do not heal quickly and
decay is more likely. Remember, the
branch you thin back to must not be
smaller than half the size of the one you
remove.

6. Wound dressings—Wound dressings and

tree paints are cosmetic only. Research
has shown that pruning paint or wound
dressing does not protect cuts from in-
sects or diseases or promote healing. In
fact, some research suggests wound
dressings may actually inhibit the healing
process.

B. Early Training of Deciduous and Broadleaf

Evergreens
By establishing early a good framework (or
scaffolding) of branches, deciduous plants

such as ash and broadleaf evergreens such
as holly will grow to fill their allotted space.
They will have few structural problems and
require minimal to no further pruning.
1. Establishing the framework of trees—

Training should begin the tree’s second
year. When cutting out branches, main-
tain at least two-thirds of the plant as a
live crown, as overpruning can damage
and even kill a tree.
Train to develop a central leader, strong
branches, a straight strong trunk, and a
good form.
a. Central leader: The central leader

reaches higher than any other branch.
A single leader is obvious, so it is easy
to thin the tree to maintain the domi-
nance of this branch. Sometimes, how-
ever, trees have many laterals that are
of similar length. In this case it is up to
you, the tree trainer, to choose the one
with the best placement to be the
leader, shortening the others into a
pleasing and appropriate form.

b. Branch strength: The object is to pro-
mote strong branches that will not re-
quire expensive corrections later in the
tree’s life. The ideal branch angle is
the 10 or 2 o’clock angle (Fig. 6).
When crotch angles are very narrow,
bark can become “trapped” between
the two branches as they grow. Where
the bark is trapped, there is no struc-
tural attachment; thus, the attachment
is weak.

Fig. 5. Proper methods of pruning cuts.

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

17 - 12

Encourage a critically placed small
branch with a narrow crotch angle to
grow to a better angle by bracing it
open with a stick placed between the
branch and the trunk. Leave this brace
in place until, when removed, the
branch stays at the wider angle (Fig.
7). Deciduous trees have narrow
crotch angles and develop bark inclu-
sions more often than coniferous trees.
Remove rubbing branches, as they re-
sult in wounds, decay, and notches.

Fig. 6. Ideal branch pruning angle is 10 or 2 o’clock.

Fig. 7. Brace a narrow-angle branch until trained to

grow at a wider angle.

When choosing between rubbing
branches, remove the most damaged
branch with the narrowest crotch
angle.
Water sprouts and suckers can occur at
the base or inside the crown. They are
rapid growing, weakly attached shoots
that should be removed as soon as pos-
sible. Rubbing them off (rather than
cutting) is possible when they are very
young and helps to keep them from re-
sprouting.
If a young tree is deformed by the
wind, it leans in the direction the wind
blows. To correct this lean and to pro-
mote a stronger tree, prune the leader
and laterals on the downwind side to
more upright branches. If done during
the summer, this will slow growth on
these branches.

c. Trunk strength: Develop a strong, well-

tapered trunk by keeping some
branches below the lowest permanent
branch on your young tree. Leave
these for 3 to 4 years in a shortened
form. Don’t let them become large and
vigorous. Remember, they are only
protecting the young bark from sun
injury, and their wood adds taper and
strength to the trunk. They will not be
an ultimate part of the crown of the
tree. After 3 or 4 years, remove them a
few at a time over the next 2 to 3
years, beginning with the largest ones.
Staking of young trees may become
necessary if they have a small trunk
diameter in relation to the tree height.
Trunks grow strengthening “reaction
wood” when they move back and forth
in the wind; thus, be sure your tree is
free to move in the wind. Secure the
tree to stakes some distance from the
trunk with bands that will not damage
the trunk. Tie as low as possible to still
hold the tree upright on a calm day.
Remove this staking as soon as pos-
sible within one year (Fig. 8).

d. Good form: Train to create a tree that

has a pleasing shape with branches
growing in the right direction for the

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

space it is to occupy. Respect the natu-
ral growth habit of the tree when es-
tablishing an initial framework of
branches. The mature shape (round,
columnar, pyramidal, etc.) should be
evident, even in a tree with only five
or six branches.
Thin the laterals that compete for
space and light. They should be 12 to
18 inches apart on the main trunk on
deciduous trees. Choose branches that
come off in different directions around
the tree to create a balanced form and
decrease competition for space and
light. Be sure to remove any crossing

and inward-growing branches first.
Eliminate any branches that grow in
opposition to the natural form of the
tree. Thin any co-dominant branches
(those that grow out from a single
point like a Y) to a single branch,
keeping the one with the best crotch
angle (Fig. 9).
Keep in mind what the tree will look
like when all these branches get longer
and bigger in diameter. Direct them to
an area where they can develop to ma-
turity without pruning. Remember that
branches do not move upward as the
tree grows in height. If you are hitting
your head on a 1-inch branch, in a few
years you will still be hitting your
head, but the branch will be 6 inches in
diameter! Prune out problem limbs
early.

2. Establishing the framework of shrubs and

vines—Some deciduous and broadleaf
evergreen shrubs grow large and have
permanent scaffolds. Examples are vibur-
nums and magnolias. Most coniferous
shrubs such as junipers have permanent
trunks and branches. Essentially, they are
small trees with multiple trunks, so estab-
lish their framework as described earlier.

C. Early Training of Coniferous Trees and

Shrubs
Training conifers such as spruce, pine, and
juniper takes special consideration. Many
coniferous trees have pyramidal forms,
regular whorls of growth, and tall, straight
trunks. Conifers often develop multiple
leaders, so maintaining a single central
leader is important in order to have a prop-
erly shaped mature tree. Remove all but one
leader on coniferous evergreens with thin-
ning cuts. Other than this, coniferous plants
need little training—unless the goal is to
make a hedge or clipped shape. Train ran-
dom branching conifers early so they will
develop attractively to fill their allotted
space.
1. Buds and pruning effects—Some plants

have buds on older wood that, under nor-
mal conditions, do not grow, but if part of
the plant dies or is pruned off, these la-

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

17 - 14

tent buds will grow. Conifers with latent
buds on older wood, such as yew, can be
pruned more severely because these buds
will grow. But conifers without latent
buds, such as pines and junipers, should
not be cut down to old wood. Severe and
heading cuts will result in dead zones and
stumps. Conifers with and without latent
buds are in Table 2.

2. Pruning cuts—Use thinning cuts when
pruning conifers. Thinning cuts are less
noticeable and create an open, natural-
looking plant. Coniferous plants with
good latent buds, such as yews and hem-
locks, will respond to heading cuts.
Strong, new foliage growth will result.
Shearing, which is when all the small
branches are cut off to produce an even
shape, produces a lot of heading cuts.
Shearing shapes plants and increases
branch density. Shearing without some
thinning can cause the center of the plant
to die from lack of light, increasing dead
zones.

3. Pruning related to branching patterns—
Random-branching conifers such as yew
or hemlock can grow both from tips (like

the whorled types) and from lateral
points. They can be pruned more than
once during the growing season and will
produce a flush a growth each time. Use
either shearing or thinning cuts for prun-
ing random branched conifers. But re-
member, don’t cut into the dead zone if
the plant has no latent buds on old wood.
Nothing will grow in the dead tangle of
branches and the beauty of the plant will
be ruined.

4. Conifers with whorled branching pat-
terns, such as fur and spruce, make a
single flush of spring growth, so they will
not tolerate frequent or severe pruning.
Shorten or shear the new growth of these
plants in the early spring as the plant is
expanding. This will make the growth
more dense and also restrict the size of
the plant (Fig. 10). You can also prune
these trees back to dormant buds after
new growth is finished or before growth
begins in the spring (Fig. 11). Thin un-
wanted branches to another branch at any
time of the year. Table 2 lists conifers
with whorled and random-branching pat-
terns.

D. Pruning Mature Trees and Shrubs

As woody ornamentals grow, age, and ma-
ture they will require maintenance training
and pruning.
1. Damage and disease—Physical damage

often requires corrective pruning. Broken
or dead branches should be removed with
a thinning cut, observing all the pruning
techniques outlined earlier. Sometimes,
to maintain a good center of gravity, you
can thin or remove limbs opposite the
broken ones. After removing the broken
branch, carefully smooth any torn or
stripped bark and remove ragged edges of
dead or dying bark (Fig. 12). Take the
bark back to where it attaches to the tree.
Keep the wound as narrow as you can to
hasten wound closing.
If a pyramidal conifer loses its tip, help a
branch in the top whorl become the new
leader. Select the best and/or the longest,
and bend and tie this branch upward to a
pole securely fastened to the trunk.
Check ties frequently to make sure they
are not cutting the bark and remove the
pole in 2 or 3 years (Fig. 13).
A plant struck by lightning may not be
damaged; except for removal of broken
branches, do nothing for 6 to 12 months.
It may take this long for damage to be-
come visible. If damaged, the tree will
decline due to an injured root system or
cambium.

2. Hazard trees and shrubs—A hazard plant
has a structural defect that may cause the
plant, or a portion of the plant, to fall on
someone or something. Careful inspec-
tion and a rational assessment of prob-
lems determines what corrective measure
to take.
If the entire tree is dead or dying, remove
it. All dead branches are accidents wait-
ing to happen. Remove them. Prune off
weak spots on branches caused by rub-
bing. Forked (or co-dominant) trunks
may signal a weak tree. A sudden lean in
the entire tree is cause for action. Sudden
dieback of top limbs may indicate root
problems. Check for signs of internal de-
cay by examining the plant for fruiting

bodies of fungi (conks) or disfiguration
(cankers). Conks at the base of the tree
can indicate root and trunk decay.
A tree that has been topped has an in-
creased risk of internal decay due to the
large, unhealed wounds created by this
type of massive cutting. Examine these
carefully, possibly using an increment
borer or an electric drill equipped with a
1/8-inch bit to test for soundness of
branches and trunks.
Be sure to call a certified, professional
arborist if you suspect you are dealing
with a hazard tree. Hazardous conditions
on plants need immediate care in order to
protect lives and property.

3. Pruning mature trees—Mature trees re-

quire little to no pruning if they have
been trained by proper pruning at plant-
ing and during the first few years of
growth. If you have inherited an older
tree with a poor shape or one previously
topped, do remedial pruning following
the guidelines in the next section.

4. Pruning mature deciduous and broadleaf
evergreen shrubs—The unique character-
istics of each type of shrub determines
the pruning technique. When growing
shrubs for flowers or fruit, it is important
to prune to encourage this feature.
Shrubs that have a permanent scaffold,
such as large viburnums and magnolias,
and those that do not produce any new
growth from the base are pruned like
trees. These shrubs (like trees) produce
flowers and fruit at the tips of branches.
With any shrub, as with trees, keep the
natural form in mind and prune to de-
velop this form by removing stems and
branches that do not contribute to the de-
sired shape.
a. Growth patterns and pruning: Observe

where the flowers are produced on a
shrub in order to know how to prune it.
See Table 3 for a partial list of shrubs
that produce wood from at or near the
ground level throughout their lives
(continuous basal growth). Prune these
as follows:

• Prune plants that flower on the mid-
portions of their stems to maximize
production of 2- to 5-year-old
wood. Do this by removing 1/4 to
1/6 of the oldest stems at or near the
ground each year. Make thinning
and heading cuts on the remaining
stems as necessary.

• Prune plants that flower at the ter-
minal tips of their stems to maxi-
mize production of terminal tips. Do
this by removing a few older canes
and spindly new canes at or near
ground level. Head back vigorous
canes to force branching and new
tips where desired, and thin others
as needed.

• Thinning cuts on deciduous and

broadleaf evergreen shrubs preserve
the shrub’s natural form. Direct
growth by thinning back to a vigor-
ous side branch that points in the
desired direction. Remove inner
growth to open up a dense shrub.

Use thinning cuts to maintain the
size of a shrub.

• Heading cuts on deciduous and

broadleaf evergreen shrubs stimu-
late the development of shoots right
below the cut, resulting in denser
growth. Make cuts where you want
branching. Use heading cuts spar-
ingly unless you are shearing a for-
mal hedge, topiary or other atypical
shape. Heading cuts result in an un-
desirable bushy or topped look.
b. Flowering period and pruning: Ob-

serve when the flowers are produced
on a shrub to know when to prune it.
See Table 4 for a partial list of spring
and summer flowering shrubs.
Prune shrubs that bloom in the spring
right after flowering to maximize
bloom the next year. Prune shrubs that
bloom in the summer in late winter or
very early spring to maximize bloom
and fruit.

5. Pruning mature coniferous shrubs— It is
very important to train coniferous shrubs
when they are young. Pruning needs to
begin as the plant approaches the desired
size, not after they are oversized. See sec-
tion C for information on growth pattern,
bud distribution, and methods and timing
of pruning for the various types of conif-
erous plants.

6. Hedges—A hedge is a row of closely
spaced shrubs or trees, usually of one
kind, grown informally as a row of natu-
ral-looking shrubs or formally with a lot
of training and shearing. Pruning cuts are
thinning and/or heading cuts to relatively
small limbs. Train hedges to be wider at
the base than at the top to prevent die-

back of lower foliage due to inadequate
light (Fig. 14). Do not prune hedge plants
at planting or during the first year of
growth. To renovate an old hedge see
section E.

hedge, train and prune as with indi-

vidual plants, striving to keep them
similar in shape, density, and height.
You will need to pay special attention
to keeping the foliage dense from the
ground up.
With new deciduous and broadleaf ev-
ergreen hedges, induce low, dense
branching by heading back the entire
plant as much as halfway down its
growth the second year after planting
in late winter or early spring. With
new conifer hedges, in the second
year, prune the tips of the new growth
as, or just after, it elongates to increase
branching. (Head yew and hemlock
the same as deciduous and broadleaf
evergreen plants.)
After the second year, and in estab-
lished hedges, make judicious heading
cuts interspersed with conservative
thinning cuts to create the desired
shape and size. Do maintenance prun-
ing in late winter to early spring for
maximum growth. For dwarfing, prune
in midsummer. Remove an occasional
branch at any time.

b. Formal hedge: To establish a formal

hedge do not prune at planting or dur-
ing the first year of growth. During the
second year prune the same as for in-
formal hedges (see above).
In the third year, shear new shoots
one-half to two-thirds of their length
every time they grow 6 to 12 inches.
Shear conifers whenever growth elon-
gates (will probably be less than 6
inches long). Do not prune after mid-
summer. Continue this in successive
years until the hedge reaches the de-
sired width. Then allow the hedge to
grow more in height than width until it
reaches the desired height. Do this by
shearing new growth on the sides
shorter (and less frequently) than the
shoots on the top.
Prune all established, full-grown for-
mal hedges once after the season’s
growth ends. If you want a very formal
effect, you will need to shear more
than once during the growing season.

For a looser, less formal effect, shear
only once in midsummer. At each
shearing, remove new growth to
within 1/2 inch of the previous shear-
ing, leaving only one to three new
leaves and buds.

7. Vines—Prune and train vines according

to their growth habit. Vines that are natu-
ral clingers support themselves by aerial
roots (English ivy) or sucker pads (Bos-
ton ivy). These vines grow on walls and
other supports. The twining vines, such
as honeysuckle, Virginia creeper, clema-
tis, and wisteria, climb  by curling or
twining their leaf tendrils, leaf stalks, or
stems on some kind of support system.
The scramblers and floppers, such as
roses, need to be tied to a support system.
a. Training: Any required support should
be in place when planting the vine. Di-
rect or train the branches of the vine in
the directions desired.

b. Pruning: Treat vines the same as

shrubs. Determine how to prune by
where the flowers are produced and
when to prune by when flowering oc-
curs (see sections D4a and b). Besides
encouraging flowering, fruiting, and
new growth, reasons to prune vines
include removal of weak or diseased
wood. Prune any vine with a perma-
nent framework like you would a tree.

8. Woody groundcovers—Low-growing
woody shrubs and vines often serve as
ground covers. Prune these plants as
though they were flowering or non-flow-
ering deciduous, broadleaf evergreen, or
evergreen shrubs.

E. Renovation and Rejuvenation Pruning

Removal of large amounts of wood may be
needed on older woody plants because they
have become too large or grown into ob-
structions, were pruned wrong at an earlier
time, have little flowering wood, lack vigor,
or are unattractive. Renovation may also be
necessary on plants that have died back
from winterkill or other damage.
Because of the danger of electrocution, if a
tree needing pruning is growing near a
power line, be sure to contact your power

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

company or hire a professional arborist.
Remember to remove any plant that is too
large for its growing space when correctly
trained. Replace it with a plant of a more
appropriate mature size.
1. Deciduous and broadleaf evergreen trees.

a. Pruning untrained older trees: If you

have a tree that has never been pruned
and is seriously tangled and perhaps
damaged, approach pruning from the
standpoint of “better late than never.”
Follow the guidelines for pruning de-
ciduous and broadleaf evergreen trees
in section VI-B. Often removing all
the dead and damaged wood, rubbing
branches, branches growing inward on
the tree, and those branches growing
outside of the natural shape of the tree
are all that is necessary. That fact that
a tree is older eliminates some pruning
possibilities; for example, establishing
a central leader or eliminating co-
dominant branches may not be pos-
sible.

b. Drop crotching: This pruning tech-

nique allows the pruner to reduce the
size of the tree without weakening the
structure or creating an eyesore by
thinning out the crown of a tree and
reducing its height and spread. Limbs
forming the perimeter of the tree are
pruned at their junction
with shorter, large-di-
ameter side branches.
This way a leader al-
ways remains, and its
presence reduces latent
bud sprouting and the
bushy growth typical of head-
ing cuts. This method is often used by
utility companies when trees grow into
power lines (Fig. 15).

Perimeter limbs are
pruned where they
join large-diameter
side branches.

c. Topped trees: Trees that have been

topped or otherwise incorrectly pruned
to a new height can sometimes be re-
shaped using thinning cuts and recom-
mended training techniques. This re-
quires removal of competing branches
to lessen the bushiness at the ends of

the stubbed branches. It is best to re-
move the tree if substantial amounts of
wood rot are found, or the tree is found
to be in poor health, or if it is impos-
sible to reconstruct a decent shape. Re-
place it with a recommended species
for the site and space.

d. Directional pruning: If your tree was

poorly placed initially and is now
growing into an obstruction, such as
overhead powerlines, consider remov-
ing it and replacing it with a properly
placed or smaller tree. Trees properly
pruned under or beside obstructions
can continue to grow. This is direc-
tional pruning. It can result in V-
shaped or one-sided trees (Fig. 16).
Directional pruning is a better alterna-
tive than topping trees, since topped
trees will eventually grow back into
the obstruction.

2. Coniferous trees—Thinning cuts on co-
niferous trees can be made from the top
down and the inside out in order to re-
duce wind resistance, if necessary. Re-
member to remove no more than one-
third of the crown at one time. Mature
conifers need little to no other pruning.

The tallest branches
are cut back to a
large-diameter
secondary branch
so that a leader
remains.

To thin the tree, some
branches are cut off
back to the main trunk.

Fig. 15. Drop crotching reduces the size of a tree

3. Deciduous and broadleaf evergreen

shrubs—Rejuvenate shrubs that exhibit
continuous basal growth by heading back
all stems to 3- to 5-inch stubs.
In shrubs with a permanent scaffold, reju-
venate by thinning and heading back to
the basic limb framework. Boxwood,
American holly, and almost all rhododen-
drons have good buds back to 3- to 5-
year-old wood. Prune these severely. Cut
back to 2- to 3-year-old wood on other
species. Do this type of pruning in late
winter to early spring before the new
growth begins.
Once you have new vigorous growth that
is about a foot long, be sure to selectively
thin to remove weak, poorly placed, and
excessive growth. This is very important
to producing an attractive, healthy shrub.

4. Coniferous shrubs—Rejuvenating mis-
shapen, broken or diseased coniferous
shrubs is possible if the plant has good
latent buds on older wood. See Table 2,
which describes branching patterns and
latent buds. Severe heading cuts into old
wood will produce vigorous growth and
much smaller shrubs. Later, be sure to
thin new growth to create a desirable
open form (unless the plant is a sheared
hedge or topiary). Do this type of pruning
in late winter to early spring before the
new growth begins.
Rejuvenation is not really possible on co-
niferous shrubs without latent buds ex-

cept on younger twigs. To correct dam-
age or remove dead branches, make the
necessary corrective thinning cuts. Then
prune new and young growth to increase
new foliage density (see section VI-C).

VII. Protecting Trees and Shrubs

During Construction
A. Construction Damage

Older trees contribute to the diversity of the
landscape and should be preserved during
construction if at all possible. Trees that
should be removed include those in poor
health, those that cannot withstand the nec-
essary changes in their environment (such
as shade-lovers suddenly exposed to full
sun), those leaning over an existing or pro-
posed structure, and those that will be 5 feet
or closer to a constructed building or utility
line.
Good pre-construction planning can often
ensure that desirable trees can be left in the
landscape. For instance, a flagstone walk
rather than solid concrete or asphalt over a
root system will allow aeration and water
penetration to the tree roots. Work with con-
tractors to designate areas for driving, park-
ing, and materials storage. Stake out exact
locations of trenches. If plants cannot re-
main where they are currently growing, con-
sider transplanting any that are small
enough or that can be dug with a tree spade.
1. Plant care during construction—Surround

trees with a barrier that extends beyond
the dripline during construction. This will
keep heavy equipment from driving over
the roots and from running into the trees.
It will also keep chemical spills away
from the root system.

2. Soil compaction—Compaction seriously
limits the aeration and water penetration
to root systems. The best solution is to
keep all heavy traffic off of rooting
zones. When this is not possible, spread
several inches of wood chips or cover
root areas with steel bridges, mesh mat-
ting, exterior plywood, or planks. This
will help reduce compaction by spreading
out the weight of heavy equipment.

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

17 - 21

3. Cut roots—Severed roots can be very

damaging to trees, reducing their water-
and nutrient-absorbing capacity and
sometimes affecting their stability in the
soil. Careful selection of routes for un-
derground utilities—detouring around
root systems when possible—can reduce
damage to roots. When that is impossible,
tunneling, rather than trenching, is a good
solution. To reduce damage on trees
close to structures, substitute posts and
pillars for footers and walls that require a
trench.

4. Change in grade—Changes in grade can

be avoided by using retaining walls to
maintain the original soil level over the
majority of the root zone. Also, tree wells
or tree islands made as large as possible
can help maintain the original grade over
the root system and minimize cutting of
roots. When a grade is changed more
than 6 inches, vertical mulching can help
modify the effect of extra soil.

VIII. Woody Ornamentals for Idaho

Given the hundreds of plant species, botanical
varieties, and cultivars that can be grown in the
Intermountain West, it is a challenging task to
select the right trees, shrubs, vines, and
groundcovers for your landscape.

A. Choices

A limited selection of woody ornamental
plants suitable for Idaho is provided in this
chapter; however, there are many other
plant species and cultivars that may serve
your needs. Table 5 suggests categories that
can be used in selecting plants for different
purposes and growing conditions. Consult
the Internet, CD-ROM disks, resource
books, local nurseries, landscape architects,
your extension educator, and Further Read-
ing in this chapter.
Use plant descriptions and photos to visual-
ize what will best meet your own and your
site’s needs and preferences. Then, make a
list and seek quality plants from the best
sources. Be open to alternatives.

B. Idaho Conditions

In southern Idaho, summer temperatures
and light intensity are high and humidity is

low. Northern Idaho has higher humidity
and frequent cloud cover. Summer tempera-
tures in southern Idaho are into the 100s
during the summer, while northern Idaho
experiences cooler temperatures (70° to
80°F). During the winter, dormant condi-
tions, elevation, local microclimates, and
temperature determine plant survival. Plants
listed in garden publications from the east-
ern United States and lower coastal eleva-
tions often do poorly in Idaho.
C. Woody Ornamentals for Idaho

Table 5 lists some of the top woody orna-
mentals for Idaho. These plants have per-
formed well or are deemed worthwhile for
trial in Idaho. Selections were made based
on Idaho research and recommendations
from Idaho horticultural professionals, ar-
borist associations, tree committees, urban
foresters, and the Idaho nursery industry.
This list is not all inclusive and does not list
many other woody ornamentals that will
grow in Idaho.
The following attributes are listed for the
plants:
• Common name: The most widely ac-

cepted common name is given.

• Scientific name: Since several plants may
share the same common name, the scien-
tific name is included for precise identifi-
cation.

 • Desirable cultivars (cultivated varieties)

are listed.

• Height: Mature height varies with your
region in Idaho, microclimate, fertilizer
practices, light source and intensity, and
soil conditions. A range of heights is
given for most woody ornamentals listed.
• Bloom time: Approximate time of flow-

ering.

• Color: Refers to foliage color. Color for

listed cultivars may vary.

• Light: Categorizes the plant into one or
more light regimes: full sun is uninter-
rupted sunlight through the full day; par-
tial shade is filtered sunlight through tree
leaves or a minimum of 6 to 8 hours per
day; full shade indicates filtered sunlight
through a dense foliage canopy or less

Chapter 17, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

17 - 22

than 6 hours of sunlight each day.

• Use in landscape: Suggests planting loca-

tions as well as functions; for example,
street tree, Xeriscape©, windbreak, or na-
tive. It also indicates if irrigation is criti-
cal.

• USDA zone: These ratings are based

upon the USDA plant hardiness zones for
Idaho (see Fig. 1, Chapter 15, page 15-3)
and upon reported preferences by region
by Idaho plant professionals. Keep in
mind that factors other than low tempera-
tures affect plant survival in a specific
area, and USDA zones should be used
only as a guideline.
Idaho zone: Indicates in which part of
Idaho this plant will perform best.

•

• Growth habit: Provides a mental picture

of mature form or outline of the plant.

Table 5.  Woody ornamentals for Idaho.

The following is a list of woody ornamental trees, shrubs,
groundcovers, and vines for Idaho Master Gardeners. By
learning the cultural, aesthetic, and climatic needs of
these plants, best management practices in their growth
and selection can be implemented. Most communities
and regions in Idaho have plant lists. In addition to this
list please seek out these resources in building a woody
plant inventory. Several of the references at the end of
this section have excellent additional information for plant
selection.
The following key is used in this table:

Height: At maturity with a range for most plants

(spread for vines)

Bloom: Season of flowering (Sp = spring; Su =

summer; F = fall)

Color: Predominant foliage color (Grn = green; Pur =
purple; Yell = yellow; Gry = gray; Blu = blue; Wht =
white)

Light: F = full sun; P = part sun; S = shade
Use in landscape: B = border; S = specimen; W =

windbreak; St= street tree; X = Xeriscape; I = irrigation;
N = native

USDA zone: Idaho has USDA plant hardiness zones 3

through 6.

• Rate of growth: Refers to the vertical in-
crease in growth unless specified differ-
ently. Rate is influenced by numerous
variables such as soil, drainage, water
light, and exposure. The designation
“slow” means the plant grows 12 inches
or less per year; “medium” indicates 13
to 24 inches of growth per year; and
“fast” is 25 inches of new growth or
greater.

• Wildlife rating: Provides a guideline of
reported attraction that wildlife have for
many of the woody ornamentals and
damage they do.

• Utility rating: When available, this rating

indicates whether this plant may be
planted under power lines.

• Source: Reference that lists this plant.

Idaho zone: 1 = northern Idaho; 2 = southwestern

Idaho; 3 = eastern Idaho; All = whole state

Growth habit: P = pyramidal; V= vase shaped; W =

weeping; R = round; U = upright; C = columnar; G =
globe; O = oval; M = mound; F = feathery; S =
spreading

Rate: F = fast growth; M = medium growth; S = slow

growth

Wildlife rating:

1 = Protective—Rare damage
2 = Protective—Slight damage
3 = Beneficial—Some damage
4 = Attractive—Severe damage

UR (utility rating):

_ = Recommended for planting under powerlines
? = Questionable for planting under powerlines

Herbaceous Ornamentals

I. Introduction

Herbaceous ornamentals comprise the nonwoody
portion of the garden landscape. These plants
generally add color and interest to a basic land-
scape design and landscape structure. Whether
that structure is a backdrop or basic design of
trees and shrubs, or a purposeful laying out of
beds and other types of planting areas, the addi-
tion of herbaceous ornamentals can enhance a
landscape significantly. These plants are also for-
giving because they are easier to dig and re-
arrange than most landscape trees and shrubs.
Learning to use herbaceous ornamentals to the
best advantage is easy; simply follow the guide-
lines outlined in this chapter.

II. The Art of Design

A. Color

Herbaceous ornamentals are generally
grown for their addition of color, through
their flowers and foliage, to the landscape.
Understanding the impact of colors and how
to combine them can form a basis for use of
these versatile landscape plants (Fig. 1).
Several color schemes can be created in a
single garden by planting early season
blooming plants in one color scheme and
late-blooming plants in a different scheme.
An interesting overlap can occur in plans of
this type.
The primary colors are red, yellow, and
blue. Other colors are combinations of these
primary colors. A pure color is a hue. A
lighter version of a hue is a tint, which is
accomplished by combining a hue with

white. A darker version of a hue is a shade,
a color made by combining a hue with
black. A tone is made by combining various
amounts of black and white, or gray, with a
hue. The value of any color is the brightness
of that color compared to another. Pure yel-
low has a greater value than pure blue.
The warm colors of yellow, red, and orange
will brighten cool, shady areas. These colors
are attention getting and can be used to the
advantage at the back of a long bed to
shorten the perspective. The cool colors of
violet and blue, by contrast, recede and are
good for close-up viewing. Cool colors are
used to the advantage in lending a cooling
illusion to any overheated area such as a
concrete patio.

Color schemes effectively used with herba-
ceous ornamentals are:
1. Polychromatic—Uses all the colors and

their tints, shades, and tones. This can
produce a carnival effect, and often re-
sults in some very pleasing color combi-
nations.

2. Monochromatic—Uses the various tints,
shades, and hues of only one color. Gar-
dens using this color scheme are particu-
larly dramatic.

3. Analogous—Uses adjacent colors on the
color wheel such as blue, violet, and red.
Such a color scheme can be expanded by
using the various tints and shades of each
of the colors.

4. Complementary—Uses opposite colors on

the color wheel such as red and green,
orange and blue, and yellow and violet.
This type of color scheme is most effec-
tively used with pure hues (not tints or
shades) and creates a very bold effect.
This color scheme is not recommended
for the small garden.

5. Split Complementary—Uses a pure color

and a color from either side of its
complementary counterpart. An example
of this is starting with blue and combin-
ing it with red or yellow, the colors bor-
dering orange on the color wheel.

6. Triadic—Uses three colors that are equal

distance from each other on the color
wheel. This unusual idea is striking.
7. White—This color deserves a special

comment. There have been many famous
gardens planted in white flowers alone.
There is a special appeal in the contrast
of white against the green foliage of
plants. White will give your garden a
well-planned and orderly look. It is the
last color to fade from sight as darkness
falls, so it is a good choice for “evening”
gardens. Cream and ivory flowers blend
well with all colors except yellow.

B. Texture

This is dictated by the density and size of
individual leaves and flowers. Plants with
large leaves and large bold flowers have a
coarse texture, tend to be dominant in a gar-
den, and appear to advance to your field of

vision. Plants with tiny leaves and small
flowers lend a fine texture to the landscape,
and tend to recede in your field of vision.
Choose herbaceous ornamentals according
to the textural “feel” you wish to attain. Of-
ten a mix of all textures is most visually
pleasing.

C. Shape and Size

Herbaceous ornamentals come in all sizes
and shapes. Size is comprised of height, or
tallness, and spread, or the extent to which
the herbaceous ornamental covers the
ground at maturity. A shape is the same as
the habit or form of a plant. Some herba-
ceous ornamentals hug the ground, while
others tower to 6 feet or more; others are
vines. Some are compact ball-shaped plants
while others are open and upright. There are
herbaceous ornamentals perfect for any lo-
cation. Be sure to space plants far enough
apart to allow room for each to develop to
maturity.

III. What to Plant

A. Exposure

Herbaceous ornamentals can be adapted to
all types of sites from full sun to pure shade.
Choosing a plant according to the exposure
of the site ensures success with these plants.

B. Season of Flowering

Some herbaceous ornamentals are tolerant
of cool temperatures and bloom in early
spring. Others need warmer weather and
bloom in the summer. Still others bloom in
the fall. Choose the proper herbaceous orna-
mental based on when color in a particular
area is most desirable.
C. Cut and Dried Flowers

Some kinds of herbaceous ornamentals hold
up better as cut flowers while others dry
beautifully. Choose herbaceous ornamentals
that are adapted to fresh or dry display.
Special cutting gardens can be completely
harvested for flowers without concern for
how the garden looks. However, plants
valuable for cut flowers can usually be in-
corporated into the main garden.
When cutting for air drying, choose flowers
just reaching maturity. Strip off the foliage,
and hang upside down in small bunches in a

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 3

dry, shady spot. Some flowers will dry well
standing upright in a container.

D. Herbaceous Ornamentals That Naturalize
Some herbaceous ornamentals, such as na-
tive plants or wildflowers, reseed them-
selves prolifically and eventually will natu-
ralize an area. Know which plants have this
tendency, and choose the proper annuals for
naturalizing. Remember, any hybrid orna-
mentals that reseed will not come true-to-
type, and usually will produce an offspring
of inferior plant quality. Seedlings of this
type are not desirable.
E. Special-Use Gardens

Herbaceous ornamentals are used to create
gardens with special qualities such as rock
gardens, bog gardens, prairie and meadow
gardens, cottage gardens, cutting gardens,
fragrance gardens, herb gardens, or tradi-
tional herbaceous perennial gardens.

IV. How to Plant (Design)

A. Formal and Informal

Once you have decided where to plant her-
baceous ornamentals, decide on a design.
Formal designs are composed mostly of
straight lines and symmetry. What appears
on the right side of the garden is matched on
the left. A formal design is easy to lay out
and, because of its visual simplicity, is the
best choice for a small lot.
Informal gardens are composed of curved
flowing lines and a disregard for symmetry.

B. Beds and Borders

Beds are large blocks of planted areas. The
bed requires a relatively large area around it
to look its best. If you have a large yard you
may have the perfect spot for a bed.
Borders run along the edges of shrub beds,
buildings, fences, walkways, and lawns.
They conserve space and soften the edges of
whatever they border.
As a general rule, the sum of the widths of
the beds and borders should not exceed one-
third of the width of the yard. Also, indi-
vidual beds should be no more than five-
eighths to two-thirds as long as the long axis
of the yard.

Herbaceous ornamentals can also be tucked
here and there in a shrub or perennial bed or
border to provide a spot of seasonal color.
Avoid spots, however, where water-greedy
roots of trees and shrubs will interfere with
growth. In these spots, a container of herba-
ceous ornamentals will provide better re-
sults.

C. Plant Choice

Materials will depend on the desired effect
and will be influenced by color scheme, sea-
son of flowering, texture, diversity, type of
background plants, and available space.
When designing the bed or border, remem-
ber to place the lower growing plants to the
front so that they will be visible and not
shaded out by taller types.
Since it is easier to place the tallest plants
first, design the border from the back to the
front; the bed from the middle to the edge.
Design from fall to spring rather than spring
to fall. This ties in with the suggestion to
design from the back to the front of the bor-
der and from the middle to the edge of the
bed, since fall plants are often taller and
would logically be placed in the back of the
border or the middle of the bed. Finally, be-
cause you read from left to right, design
from left to right.
Plant in clumps or drifts of plants using
groups of the same species or cultivar.
When planting in groups of less than 10,
plant odd rather than even numbers of the
same plant. These design suggestions help
avoid the “zoo” effect (a collection of one
of everything) and will lead the eye through
the planting.

V. Gardening in Containers

Almost any annual can be grown in a con-
tainer. Plants that spread or cascade are suit-
able for the outer rim of regular containers and
for hanging baskets. If plants are mixed in a
container, all should have similar sun and wa-
ter requirements. Containers and hanging bas-
kets allow the gardener to provide spots of
color almost anywhere around the home
grounds.

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 4

A. Containers

Choose a container with holes in the bottom
to drain the water. A tray underneath will
catch any drainage. Avoid letting pots rest
in standing water, as roots may begin to rot.
Glazed clay pots and plastic containers do
not breathe and will not need watering as
often as clay. Darker colors absorb more
heat, which will warm the soil but cause
more water loss. Therefore, light-colored
containers may be the best choice for most
gardeners.

B. Soil

For containerized plants, purchase a com-
mercial potting mix that is a blend of peat,
pearlite, and other components and contains
no soil. Mixes are blended to hold water and
nutrients and to drain well. Mix some slow
release fertilizer with the mix, or liquid feed
about every 2 weeks. Water containers well
before applying liquid fertilizer.

C. Planting

Containers look best when packed with
plants. A planted container should look at-
tractive immediately after or within a few
weeks of planting.

D. Watering

Plants in containers require regular water-
ing. Always water until the water runs out
of the drain holes. Water can run right
through very dry soil without actually wet-
ting it. If you have doubts, tip the container
up to test that it has become much heavier
with water.

E. Maintenance

Herbaceous annuals make excellent long-
flowering container plants. However, peren-
nial container plants can be placed in the
garden after their limelight. If containerized
perennials are not planted out in the garden,
place them in a cold frame or garage to pro-
tect their roots from freezing during the
winter.

VI. Getting Started with Annuals

An annual plant completes its life cycle in a
single year. Unless the plants reseed them-
selves, new annuals need to be planted every
season. Some hardy annuals have seeds that

will germinate and grow in cooler soil. The
plants will stand some freezing and thawing.
Half-hardy annuals will take some cool, damp
weather but will be killed by a frost. Tender
annuals can take no cool weather at all. Some
annuals will reseed depending on variety and
climatic conditions.
Annuals serve many functions in the garden,
but their primary use is for providing color.
They grow quickly and easily, are great for
cutting, and are generally inexpensive. Annu-
als generally bloom for most of the season. An
added bonus is the fragrance that some annuals
bring to the garden. Annuals come in a variety
of sizes, shapes, and colors.
A. Propagation

1. Seeds—Come in mixtures and single cul-
tivars. Hybrid seeds are usually more ex-
pensive but often produce spectacular
flowers. If you save your own seed, be
aware that most flowers, and especially
hybrids, will not breed true-to-type.
Seeds will lose their viability if stored for
many years, so starting with fresh seed
packaged for the growing year will get
you off to the best start.
Seeds that are started indoors or in a
greenhouse should be growing 4 to 6
weeks before you place them in the gar-
den. The warm weather annuals should
be transplanted outdoors after the danger
of frost.
The easiest way to begin annual plants is
to plant the seeds directly where you
wish the plants to grow. The seedlings
can be thinned to achieve the desired
density. Follow the seed package instruc-
tions for time and depth of planting.

2. Transplants—Plants from the garden cen-

ter save you time and effort. They are,
however, more expensive than growing
your own. Some flowers such as petu-
nias, impatiens, and geraniums have very
small seeds, are slow to germinate, and
seedlings take longer to reach transplant
size. They can be started indoors, but
they demand precise growing conditions
and vigilant care. It is easier to buy trans-
plants for these types of plants.

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 5

Pick good plants. Make sure plants are
healthy and growing vigorously. Plants
that have obviously dried out, have over-
grown their containers, or are yellow or
leggy should be avoided because they
will bloom poorly and require constant
watering.
Slip plants out of their containers to
check the roots. Look for a fine network
of healthy roots supported by visible soil.
Avoid plants with a mass of dense, white,
tangled roots.

B. Growing, Culture, and Maintenance

1. Soil preparation—A soil test is always a
good idea if there is any doubt about the
fertility or pH of the soil. Amend the soil
appropriately before planting to adjust
the acidity and provide the proper nutri-
ents for growth.
Amendments, such as compost, peat
moss, and manure added to the soil will
increase organic matter, and thereby in-
crease water-holding capacity and soil
fertility. Covering the soil surface with a
3-inch layer of amendment and digging it
into a 12-inch depth provides a good
planting area.

2. Planting—Seeds will germinate when the
soil is warmed to the proper temperature.
The exact temperature will depend on the
annual species being planted.
After the soil is prepared, sprinkle the
seed either randomly or in rows with in-
dentations in the soil. Cover the seed with
loose, organically amended soil, so the
soil will not crust over the seeds. Water
in with a light misting of water, and keep
the soil evenly moist until germination
occurs. Be sure not to plant the seed any
deeper than suggested on the seed pack-
age label.
Acclimate transplants before placing
them in the soil. Place them in a pro-
tected space outdoors for several days,
and make sure the plant does not dry out.
At planting time, tap or tip the plants out
of their pots, and set them in a prepared
hole large enough for the root ball to fit
comfortably. Set the plant in the hole,
making sure the top of the root ball is

even with the surrounding soil surface.
Recent research has shown that breaking
up the root ball of even the most pot-
bound of annuals only slows down their
development. Plant the roots as they
come out of the container. Do not let the
root ball dry out. Firm the soil around the
roots and water well. Protect plants
against excessive sun, wind, or cold
while they are getting started. Inverted
pots or milk cartons, or row covers can
be used.

3. Fertilizing—Dry or liquid fertilizers will

work for annuals. Nitrogen stimulates
leafy growth, while phosphorus and pot-
ash promotes flowering, fruiting, and root
growth. Fertilizers with a ratio of 1-1-1,
1-2-1, or 1-2-2 are best for annuals. Re-
member that the numbers on the package
indicate both the ratio and the percentage
of active ingredients per pound of nitro-
gen-phosphorus-potassium.
Dry fertilizer amendments added at plant-
ing will last for about 6 weeks. Applica-
tion of dry fertilizers, followed by a wa-
tering, or liquid fertilizer applied to damp
soil will maintain the quality of the plants
and blooms.

4. Watering—Young plants need more fre-
quent watering until their roots get estab-
lished. Sown seeds may need multiple
daytime watering. As plants become es-
tablished, gradually water less frequently.
Watering established plants will depend
on plant size, soil characteristics, and
weather. During hot weather, large plants
in sandy soil require frequent watering.
Strive to keep the plants evenly moist. If
plants are allowed to dry out, they may
be permanently stunted.
Overhead watering with sprinklers is a
common technique. However, some
flowers are more susceptible to disease if
their leaves and flowers are constantly
wet. Overhead watering can also cause
taller plants to tip over.
Furrow watering is a common technique
if planting is done in rows. Furrows must
be tended so the water flows properly,
and there must be a gentle slope from one

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 6

end to the other. Once plants get large,
the furrow system can be difficult to
maintain.
Drip irrigation is the most efficient way
to deliver water. Use drip emitters or per-
forated tubing to deliver water directly
where you want it.
Infrequent deep watering is better than
frequent light applications.

5. Mulching—This helps annual plants con-
serve moisture and keeps the soil cooler.
Be sure to apply the mulch after the soil
has warmed in the spring, otherwise
warming will be delayed. Mulches also
help in weed control and provide an at-
tractive appearance. Organic materials,
such as bark or sawdust, can be incorpo-
rated into the soil at the end of the season
as an organic amendment.
Mulch materials must allow water to
move through. Organic materials must be
loose and coarse. Remember that many
organic materials will draw nitrogen to
the soil to aid in breakdown. These mate-
rials, when used as mulch, must be aug-
mented with nitrogen fertilizer. Wood
byproducts, such as bark chips and saw-
dust, as well as compost make good
mulch for annuals. Pine needles and grass
clippings can also be used. Spread grass
clippings in one thin layer and allow
them to dry before adding another layer.
Landscape fabric can be spread over the
soil surface and covered with bark chips
or other organic materials. The fabric
stops weed growth, but allows air and
water to penetrate the soil.

6. Thinning—Seedlings grown from di-

rectly planted seeds need to be thinned.
This process is little more than pulling
out the excess seedlings to establish the
proper spacing for the type of annual
grown.
If pulling will disrupt the roots of the re-
maining plants in the garden, clip off the
extras at the soil line with shears. Leav-
ing more plants than necessary at this
first thinning will provide some plants to
be transplanted elsewhere and also allow
a margin of safety in case of disease or

frost problems. After plants are well es-
tablished, a second thinning will leave
plants with plenty of room to attain a ma-
ture growth. Properly spaced plants are
healthier and produce more blossoms.

7. Pinching—Removing the terminal

growth on young annual plants will help
make them bushier and more compact.
Many annuals are now bred to be com-
pact and well branched. However, any
plant that has become too leggy or too
tall will be improved by pinching. Ex-
amples are petunias, geraniums, and
many chrysanthemums.
Pinching out the first blossoms that form
on some plants will cause more overall
bloom. Examples are marigolds and zin-
nias.

8. Weeding—These rob annual plants of

nutrients and water and make them look
unkempt. Weed problems can be reduced
by proper soil preparation and mulching
immediately after transplanting. In direct-
seeded areas, apply mulch to retard weed
growth after plants have been thinned.
If weeds grow among annuals, hoe only
deep enough to sever the weeds just be-
low the surface. This will avoid any dam-
age to the shallow feeder roots common
to annuals. If weeds are large, pull them
by hand.

9. Deadheading and grooming—Removing

the faded flowers, or deadheading, will
help keep the garden looking neat and
will prolong bloom on most garden annu-
als. A plant that is ripening seeds pro-
duces less blossoms. Pinch off or cut
spent flowers back to the next branch.
Shearing the flower heads with pruning
shears works well for smaller-flowered
plants. Be careful not to cut back too far.
Remove less than one-third of the plant.
Grooming annuals involves removing
dead leaves and thinning extra branches.
Grooming keeps plants looking good and,
by removing dead foliage before it can
mold on the plant, keeps diseases from
gaining a foothold.
Thinning the foliage keeps the air circu-
lating through the plants, keeps the plants

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 7

dry, and cuts down on diseases. Thinning
also allows light penetration to the inte-
rior of the plant. Often insect pests,
which otherwise might be overlooked,
are discovered during the grooming.

10. Staking—Tall growing annuals such as
larkspur and tall marigolds need protec-
tion from wind and rain or overhead
sprinklers. Stakes help them grow
straight and keep them from being
knocked over.
Stakes can be made of wood, bamboo, or
any similar material. To be less conspicu-
ous, stakes should be small in diameter
and about 6 inches shorter than the ma-
ture plant to avoid being visible above
the plant. Secure the stems to the stakes
with paper-covered wire, plastic ribbon,
or other material that will not cut into the
stem, You also can support the plants
with a framework of stakes and strings in
crisscrossing patterns. Commercial sup-
port frameworks are available for herba-
ceous annuals.
Stake plants before they have a chance to
fall over or begin to grow crooked. When
plants are about one-third of their mature
size, begin staking. Place stakes or
frames close to the plant, but take care
not to damage the root system. Secure the
plant stems to the stake or frame as it
grows taller.

11. Insects—Although ornamental annuals

are generally pest-free, the following in-
sects can sometimes cause problems:
aphids, beetles, caterpillars, thrips, white
flies, earwigs, and mites.
Annuals that are well maintained can
withstand most attacks by insects. Plants
under water stress or those lacking plant
nutrients become more susceptible to in-
sect attack. Keeping annuals healthy and
growing is the first line of defense. Many
insect pests are naturally controlled by
predator insects. Chemical sprays will
destroy these predators and should be
avoided.
Insects, such as aphids, mites, thrips, and
white flies, can be controlled with insec-

ticidal soaps. Caterpillars can be con-
trolled with Bt spray. Earwigs can be
trapped in rolled newspapers and then
destroyed.
If chemical treatment becomes necessary,
make sure your pest is positively identi-
fied and use a chemical appropriate for
its control. Always follow label direc-
tions.

12. Diseases—Since annuals are only in the

garden for one season, diseases are not as
serious a problem as they are for perenni-
als. The following diseases, however, can
sometimes cause problems: the fungus
diseases botrytis blight (gray mold),
damping-off fungus, powdery mildew
and rust, and the virus diseases mosaic
and aster yellows.
Moist conditions and splashing water fa-
vor and spread the fungus diseases rust,
powdery mildew, damping-off fungus,
and botrytis blight. Spacing and groom-
ing plants correctly to maintain a good
airflow will help to prevent these dis-
eases. Sprinkler watering in the morning
so the foliage will dry during the day or
drip irrigating so the foliage stays com-
pletely dry will also help. Damping-off
can be prevented by planting seeds after
the weather warms and not keeping the
seeds and seedlings too wet.
Botrytis gains a foothold in dead plant
parts. Deadheading and grooming can
help to keep this disease out of annuals.
Insects such as aphids and leafhoppers
spread the virus diseases mosaic and aster
yellows. Starting with virus-free plants
and then excluding insect pests will de-
tour these diseases. No control is avail-
able for the virus diseases. Plants must be
pulled and destroyed. The fungus dis-
eases are controlled with fungicides.
Check the label of each chemical for the
organisms controlled and proper applica-
tion methods.

13. Other pests—Slugs and snails are very

common and can chew small annuals
down to nothing. Handpick, trap, and de-
stroy the pests, or use commercial baits.

C. Description of Selected Annuals

1. Antirrhinum majus (Snapdragon)—

Available in many colors. Grows in full
sun. Height varies from 12 inches for
dwarf plants to 36 inches for the tall vari-
eties. Plants can be directly seeded or
transplanted in early spring. These plants
often reseed themselves under Idaho con-
ditions.

2. Begonia semperflorens (Bedding bego-
nia)—Colors in shades of red and pink,
and white. Leaves are bright green or
bronze-red and waxy looking. Grows in
partial sun to shade. Height is 6 to 12
inches at maturity. Seeds are slow to start
and are best used as bedding plants or
houseplants.

3. Calendula officinalis (Pot marigold)—
Flowers are white, cream, orange, yel-
low, and apricot. Grows in full sun. Ma-
ture height is 12 to 30 inches. Sow seeds
directly in early spring. Flower petals are
edible, and the flowers make long-lasting
cut flowers. These plants are very easy to
grow and will reseed profusely.

4. Callistephus chinensis (China aster)—

Asters come in white, light yellow, pink,
red, blue, and lavender or purple. Grows
in full sun. Height varies from 6 to 30
inches. Sow seeds directly into garden in
spring. These plants dislike being trans-
planted. Many flower forms are available,
and they all make excellent cut flowers.
5. Centaurea sp. (Bachelor’s button)—Col-

ors vary from blue, pink, rose, purple,
yellow, and white. Grows in full sun.
Height is 12 to 36 inches tall. The differ-
ent species have differing planting and
growth requirements.

6. Cosmos sp. (Cosmos)—Colors are yel-

low, orange, red, white, pink, and
bicolors. Grows in full sun to partial
shade. Height is 2 to 7 feet. Easy-to-grow
plants make good backgrounds for other
annuals. Several different species have
differing planting and growth require-
ments. These plants will reseed.

7. Dahlia sp. (Dahlia)—Comes in all colors
except blue. Requires full sun for at least
half the day. Height is 12 to 20 inches.

These seed-grown plants will form tubers
that can be dug and stored over the win-
ter. To assure vigorous bloom, however,
replant each spring from seed. These
showy plants will bloom profusely in the
first year.

8. Ipomoea tricolor (Morning glory)—Col-
ors include blue, white, pink, red, choco-
late, crimson, lavender, and violet. Grows
in full sun. This climbing plant will grow
to 10 feet, but some dwarf forms are
available that grow to 5 inches. This fast-
growing vine is attractive on trellises and
fences. Flowers on old varieties are open
only at night, but the newer varieties stay
open most of the day. Several different
species are available. Some will reseed.
9. Lathyrus odoratus (Sweet pea)—Comes

in pink, red, purple, lavender, white,
cream, apricot, salmon, maroon, and
bicolors. Prefers full sun. Climbing types
will grow to 5 feet while bush types grow
to 12 to 36 inches. Can be planted very
early. Keeping seed pods off plants will
keep it blooming.

10. Limonium sinuatum (Statice)—Colors
include blue, lavender, white, rose, yel-
low, apricot, and peach. Prefers full sun.
Grows 10 to 48 inches tall. This plant is
easily dried and is decorative in bou-
quets. Various forms yield plants of dif-
fering heights. L. sinuatum has flowers in
flat-topped clusters while L. suworowii
has curved spikes of bright rose or lilac
flowers.

11. Lobelia erinus (Lobelia)—Colors include

white, cream, rose, pink, purple, violet,
and lavender. Grows in full sun to light
shade. Height is 4 to 6 inches. Lobelias
are easy to establish as transplants. Flow-
ers best when nights are cool. Attractive
in front of other annuals and in containers
and hanging baskets.

12. Pelargonium sp. (Geranium)—Comes in
shades of red, pink, orange, violet, white,
and bicolors. Grows in full sun to partial
shade, depending on variety. Height is 8
to 36 inches. These popular annuals can
be planted as rooted cuttings or as trans-
plants in spring. Several different species

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

have differing growth habits. All make
good houseplants. They can also be over-
wintered in a cool, unheated cellar.

13. Petunia hybrida (Garden petunia)—Col-
ors available include shades of pink, red,
salmon, coral, yellow, cream, blue,
purple, white, and bicolors. Plants prefer
full sun. Height is 8 to 27 inches. They
are best started as transplants. The long
blooming period of petunias make them a
popular annual. Flowers are single or
double. The plants are adapted to a wide
range of soil and water conditions. They
also make good cut flowers.

14. Portulaca grandiflora (Moss rose)—Col-
ors include white, cream, yellow, orange,
red, and pink. Grows in full sun. Height
is 6 inches. Sow seeds directly or set out
transplants. This favorite grows in sunny,
dry areas where many other plant will not
grow. Plants have a trailing habit, and the
leaves are succulent. Flowers are single
or double and open in the sun and close
in late afternoon. These plants look good
in rock gardens, containers, and hanging
baskets.

15. Tagetes sp. (Marigold)—Colors available
include white, off-white, yellow, orange,
and orange-red. Plants grow in full sun.
Height is 4 inches to 4 feet. They are eas-
ily established from seed or as trans-
plants. Marigolds bloom continuously
from early summer until frost. All are
good as cut flowers. The many different
species have various flower forms and
plant growth habits.

16. Tropaeolum majus (Nasturtium)—Colors

include cream, yellow, orange, red, and
pink. Plants grow in full sun. Height var-
ies from 15 inches in the dwarf varieties
to 10 feet in the climbing types. They are
easily established from seed, but plants
do not transplant well. Young leaves and
blossoms have a peppery flavor and are
edible. Blooms profusely throughout the
summer until frost.

17. Viola sp. (Pansy)—Colors available in-
clude white, yellow, orange, red, purple,
blue, and bicolors. Plants grow in full sun
or partial shade. Height of plants is 8

inches. Violas are easy to establish as
transplants are popular for containers,
hanging baskets, and rock gardens. These
plants grow best in early spring through
early summer. Some varieties are more
heat tolerant than others. The various
species have various flower and growth
characteristics. They will bloom all sum-
mer in cool regions if plants are dead-
headed but will need to be replaced in hot
summer climates.

18. Zinnia elegans (Garden zinnia)—Comes
in shades of white, yellow, orange, red,
pink, purple, and bicolors. Plants grow in
full sun. Height is 6 to 36 inches. Zinnias
are easily started from seed. These plants
grow easily and bloom through the heat
of summer and into late summer when
most other annuals have finished. Avail-
able in dwarf and tall growing varieties.

VII. Getting Started with Biennials

Biennial plants complete their life cycle in 2
years. During the first year plants produce
leaves that are often close to the ground and
arranged circular in nature. This rosette of
leaves overwinters, and the winter cold period
stimulates flowering during the second year.
The plants bloom and then die.
Biennial seeds can be planted in midsummer to
produce plants that develop in the fall. The
plant will then bloom the next year. Popular
biennials are stock, foxglove, silver dollar, and
hollyhock.
Culture of biennials is the same as for annuals
except the plants remain for 2 years.

VIII. Getting Started with Perennials

Historically, herbaceous perennials have al-
ways been an important component of the or-
namental garden, and recently there has been
an upsurge of interest across the United States
in the culture of herbaceous perennials. De-
spite this renaissance, many gardeners are re-
luctant to try growing herbaceous perennials
because they still lack appreciation and knowl-
edge about them.
Herbaceous perennials take the name herba-
ceous from the word herb, a seed-producing
annual, biennial, or perennial that does not

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 10

produce woody stems. Herbaceous perennials
are termed perennial in that they take one or
more seasons to go from seed to seed, and then
generally, but not necessarily, live for three or
more seasons. Some, such as columbine, may
be short-lived, while others such as peony will
outlast several generations of the same family
in the same site without being divided or
moved.
The tops of the plants, the flowers, the leaves,
and the stems of herbaceous perennials usually
die back to the ground with the first fall frost.
The hard, fleshy subterranean portions of the
plant, the crown and roots, survive the winter
and resume growth in spring. Those herba-
ceous perennials that survive the winter with
little or no protection are termed hardy. Those
herbaceous perennials that need some protec-
tion to survive the winter outdoors are said to
be half-hardy. Some herbaceous perennials
must be lifted as tubers, rhizomes, or bulbs,
stored overwinter or placed in a greenhouse,
and then be replanted in spring. These plants
are termed tender herbaceous perennials.
Herbaceous perennials are available in an un-
limited variety of flowers, foliage colors, tex-
tures, forms, spreads, and height. As a group,
herbaceous perennials are the first plants to
bloom in the spring and the last to fail with the
fall frosts. They seldom bloom more than a
few days to several weeks as individuals, but
afford a continuity of bloom as a bed or bor-
der.
Being herbaceous rather than woody, herba-
ceous perennials have the capacity to bend in
the breeze and lend interest and movement to a
static landscape. They have the advantage, un-
like trees and shrubs, of obtaining a definite
size each season, somewhere between a few
inches to 10 feet tall. Generally, herbaceous
perennials need division and no pruning.
Herbaceous perennials vary in their environ-
mental preferences from wet to dry, fertile to
infertile, low to high pH, sandy to loam to clay
soils, as well as shady to sunny sites. They also
vary widely in the amount of care they need.
While there are no maintenance-free herba-
ceous perennials, there are many that require
low maintenance.

A. The Purpose of a Perennial Garden

A perennial garden may have different pur-
poses and fill many needs. The great En-
glish gardener, Gertrude Jekyll (1848-
1933), perhaps said it best when she
penned:

“The first purpose of a garden is to give
happiness and repose of mind, which is
more often enjoyed in the contemplation
of the homely border…than in any of
those great gardens where the flowers
lose their identity, and with it their hold
of the human heart, and have to take a
lower rank as mere masses of color fill-
ing so many square yards of space.”

Among the uses of a perennial garden might
be to:
• Enhance those outdoor areas where you

will spend much of your time from spring
to fall.

• Create an attractive privacy screen.
• Soften and make attractive a steep slope
by terracing it and planting herbaceous
perennials.

• Create a bog garden where it is too wet

for a lawn.

• Create an inviting entrance to your house.
• Grow flowers for indoor or outdoor fra-

•

grance.
Integrate the other features of the land-
scape into a whole.

• Create a special place to exhibit your

skill at raising specimen plants.

• Mask unattractive aspects of the yard

such as tool sheds, garbage cans, compost
bins, etc.

• Use a rocky outcropping as a rock garden

rather than trying to remove the rocks.
• Create a stunning view from inside the

house.

• Add color, shape, and dimension to the

small yard patches next to entrances,
which will soften the hard features of the
existing backdrop.

B. Sexual Propagation by Seed

This method is advantageous because dis-
ease is not as easily carried over on the seed
as it may be through vegetative propagation.

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 11

To start herbaceous perennials from seed,
harvest the seed when it is ripe but before
the spent flower heads self-sow. Keep in
mind that seeds of many horticultural culti-
vars will not come true-to-type owing to its
hybrid parentage. To start perennials from
seed indoors, start them in midwinter to
early spring so some of them will bloom the
first growing season. Seeds may be started
in a greenhouse or a sunny window but
most commonly are started under lights.

C. Vegetative Propagation by Division, Stem

Cuttings, Root Cuttings, Layering, Grafting,
or Tissue Culture
Vegetative propagation guarantees that the
offspring will be identical to the parent.
Usually it takes far less time to have a fully
mature blooming herbaceous perennial
when it is vegetatively propagated.
1. Division—This is the simplest and most
certain way to propagate, control the size
of, and rejuvenate herbaceous perennials.
Generally, perennials become larger each
year and eventually begin to choke out
other plants. Their outer edge thrives
while the center of the clump suffers
from competition for water, nutrients,
root run, and sunlight. Often an ad-
vanced-age clump looks like a doughnut
with a thriving outer ring and a dead cen-
ter. Such a clump is a prime candidate for
division. Shasta daisies, chrysanthe-
mums, and phlox are good examples of
plants where this condition exists after 2
to 3 years.
The time to divide a perennial clump de-
pends upon the particular perennial, the
time of year that the perennial blooms,
and the climate. In Zone 5 or colder, most
division is done in the spring while the
perennials are still slightly dormant. Divi-
sion is usually necessary only every 2 to
4 years for most perennials. Some peren-
nials such as the chrysanthemum benefit
from being divided every year while oth-
ers, such as the oriental poppy, are best
left undisturbed for as long as possible, or
never divided.
Different types of perennials are handled
differently depending upon their growth

habit when they are dug and divided. For
example, compact shallow-rooted plants
are divided by digging the entire clump
and pulling it carefully apart into smaller
plants. Solid clumps of plants such as
daylilies, hosta, phlox, and Siberian iris
are divided by digging up the entire
clump and using two spading forks back-
to-back to pull the clump into sections. If
the center of the clump is deteriorated, it
must be discarded. If you wish to have a
small section of an existing clump for use
elsewhere, use a sharp spade to dig a
healthy section away from the parent
clump without disturbing the parent clump.
Shallow-rooted ground covers such as
vinca and creeping phlox are divided
anytime during the growing season by
digging them up and cutting them apart.
Fibrous- to woody-rooted perennials such
as lupine must be dug carefully, the soil
rinsed from the roots, and then the crown
carefully divided with a sharp knife,
making sure that each segment contains
two to four strong tap root segments and
two to four eyes or shoots.

2. Tip or stem cuttings—These are rootless

sections of plants that are placed in a
rooting medium where they are induced
to develop adventitious roots. Cuttings
may also be taken from actively growing
roots.
Tip or stem cuttings are propagated by
taking a terminal, 3- to 6-inch long firm
portion of a vigorous nonblooming shoot
that includes several nodes. Spring is the
best time to take cuttings from herba-
ceous perennials that bloom in summer.
Early summer is the best time to take cut-
tings from those that bloom in spring or
fall.
Most perennials cuttings should begin to
develop roots in 1 to 2 weeks. Bottom
heat will speed the rooting process but is
not necessary.
Sometimes young, virtually rootless tufts
of shoots develop at the base of the pe-
rennials. These may be pulled away from
the parent plant and treated the same as
any cutting.

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 12

3. Root cuttings—These cuttings are best
made in early spring. While it is easiest
to take cuttings from perennials when
they are being lifted from the bed or bor-
der, cuttings can also be taken from the
parent plant by digging around the pe-
riphery of the parent plant with a shovel.
Fine-rooted plants, such as achillea, are
propagated from root cuttings by scatter-
ing 1- to 2-inch long sections of root
horizontally on the surface of a 2- to 3-
inch deep layer of moist soilless medium
in a flat. Cover the pieces of root with 1/2
inch of moist sifted, soilless mix.
Fleshy-rooted perennials such as baby’s
breath, bleeding heart, peonies, and ori-
ental poppies are propagated by taking
1 1/2- to 2-inch long sections of roots,
dusting the bottom end with a rooting
compound, and sticking the root cutting
bottom end down in a 50-50 mixture of
peat moss and sand in pots or deep flats,
with 1/4 inch of the cutting sticking
above the rooting medium. For peonies,
take 3-inch long root cuttings and keep
the medium moist but not wet. When the
cuttings begin to grow, treat them the
same as any other seedlings.

4. Layering—This is an easy way to propa-
gate vine-type plants and ground covers.
Bend the supple stems, without severing
the stem from the parent plant, down to
the soil into a shallow trench and cover
several nodes with soil, or bend the stems
into pots of soil.
Notching or wounding the area just be-
low a soil-covered node will encourage
rooting. Many upright plants can also be
rooted with this technique by carefully
bending their younger, more flexible
stems downward to the ground.

5. Grafting—This is the joining of the top
of one plant, the scion, to the bottom of
another plant, the stock. This technique is
possible but rarely used in propagating
perennials.

6. Tissue culture—Millions of disease-free
plants from a single small clump of api-
cal cells in a single season can be gener-
ated from a tissue culture. This method is

beyond the facilities and capabilities of
the ordinary homeowner.

D. Vegetative Propagation by Specialized

Stems and Roots
These function primarily as food storage
organs and can also function in vegetative
reproduction.
1. Bulbs—Tunicate bulbs have outer-bulb
scales that are dry and membranous and
are typical of the tulip, hyacinth, bulbous
iris, and daffodil.
Nontunicate, or scaly bulbs, are repre-
sented by the lily. These bulbs do not
have the dry covering, and the scales are
separate and attached to a basal plate.
Propagation is accomplished by periodi-
cally removing the small bulbs or offsets
that grow off of the main bulb. This is
usually done whenever the plants are
dug. Digging of these perennials is neces-
sary when the clumps become too
crowded and is done after the foliage has
died down naturally in the late summer or
fall. Bulbs should be planted or replanted
at that time. The small bulbs may need to
grow for several seasons before they are
large enough to flower. Lilies are propa-
gated by removing some of the outer
scales of the mother bulb, planting them,
and allowing them to develop small bulbs.
2. Corms—Gladiolus and crocus are typical

plants with corms. Gladiolus are
semihardy to tender in Idaho and must be
stored overwinter in areas with severe
winters. The corm is a swollen base of
the stem that is enclosed by dry, scaly
leaves. Propagation is accomplished by
separating the small corms or cormels
from the mother corms. Plant these small
corms shallowly and expect no flowers
until they grow large enough, usually 1 or
2 years.

3. Tubers—These are a modified stem that
serves as a storage organ. Caladium is an
example of a tuberous plant. Tubers can
be propagated by planting the whole
structure or by cutting tubers into sec-
tions, each containing one or more buds
or “eyes.” This division is done shortly
before planting.

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 13

4. Tuberous roots and stems—These thick-
ened structures are botanically different
from true tubers but are often called sim-
ply “tubers.” Tuberous roots are typical
of several types of perennials, including
the dahlia. Propagation is done by sepa-
rating the tuberous roots, making sure
that each root has a section of the crown
with a shoot bud. Divide in late winter or
spring, shortly before planting. Tuberous
roots are biennial, meaning the old root
disintegrates in the second year after new
tuberous roots are produced.
Tuberous stems include the tuberous be-
gonia and cyclamen. These structures are
usually vertical in orientation and have
vegetative buds on the upper end. These
tuberous stems continue to grow larger
and larger from year to year. Divide these
structures early in the spring, making
sure each has a bud.

5. Rhizomes—These specialized stem struc-

tures grow horizontally on top of or just
below the soil surface. Rhizomatous iris
and lily of the valley are two perennials
that can be propagated by their rhizomes.
Remove sections of shoots and roots early
in the spring or in late summer or fall.

D. Growing, Culture, and Maintenance

1. Site selection—Because herbaceous pe-
rennials can be left in a given place for a
long period of time, proper site selection
is critical. Most plants prefer a site that
has a fertile, well-drained, organically
rich soil with a pH of 5.5 to 6.5. Good
drainage is important, especially during
the winter, and most soils will have to be
improved. The site should receive full
sun or shade all day. Be sure to consider
not only the present shade, but also the
future shade. Take into account the
growth of your trees and shrubs as well
as your neighbor’s. The site should be
flat to only slightly sloped. It should be
out of the drying, stem-snapping wind
but have enough breeze to provide the air
circulation essential to minimize the slow
foliage-drying conditions conducive to
disease.

2. Soil preparation—The best opportunity to
tailor the soil needs of the perennial is the
first time it is prepared. Try to start soil
preparation long before planting the bed
or border. Start in spring for a fall plant-
ing and in fall for a spring planting. This
will allow plenty of time for any organic
soil amendments and/or pH modifications
to take effect. To prepare the site for
planting perennials:
a. Clear all large debris from the site.

Kill and remove all existing vegetation
from the site for composting. It may be
necessary to re-treat the site to kill per-
sistent perennial weeds such as quack-
grass.

b. Spread 2 to 3 inches of organic matter

such as well-decomposed compost,
aged manure, or peat moss over the
surface of the soil before beginning to
work it. Rototill or spade the organic
matter into the soil to a depth of 8 to
12 inches. Add no more organic matter
than one-third of the final amended
soil volume. Do not work the soil
when it is wet. Organic matter incor-
poration improves soil structure by
providing the lignin that glues together
the soil particles. Improved soil struc-
ture encourages water percolation and
retention, aeration, and root penetra-
tion. Spread an organic mulch over the
prepared bed or border. It is easier and
tidier to spread the mulch before plant-
ing.

c. Edge the bed or border in some fash-
ion. An edging will be attractive and
will help reduce the encroachment of
the lawn.

3. Planting and transplanting—While bare-
rooted perennials are best planted either
spring or fall, container-grown perennials
may be planted at any time during the
growing season, though it is more diffi-
cult during the drought months of July
and August. Freshly dug plants are best
transplanted in spring or fall but may be
moved all summer if you are careful. Pe-
rennials such as bearded iris, bleeding
heart, peonies, and oriental poppies are

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 14

best transplanted immediately after their
brief dormant period after bloom. When
planting herbaceous perennials:
a. Dig a hole two times the size of the

root spread of bare root perennials and
one and one-half times the size of the
root ball of container-grown perennials.
b. Soak the roots of bare root plants for

several minutes in a starter solution of
1 tablespoon of 16-12-10 or 20-20-20
water soluble fertilizer dissolved in 1
gallon of water.

c. Water the potted herbaceous perenni-

als with a starter solution before
knocking them out of the container.
Place your hand over the top of the pot
with your fingers grasping the main
stems, turn the pot upside down, and
tap the pot rim on the edge of a hard
surface or tap the bottom of the pot
sharply with a planting trowel. Re-
move fiber pots from perennials be-
cause often pots do not decompose. Be
sure to at least peel back the rim of
peat pots below soil level or the rim
will act as a wick, drying out the pot
and the contained soil.

d. Some pot-bound plants may have to

have the container cut away with
snips. Score the soil ball, making three
to five vertical cuts into the soil ball,
top to bottom, with a sharp knife. The
depth of the cuts will vary from 1/2 to
1 1/2 inches deep depending upon the
size of the soil ball. Tease some of the
soil away from the top, sides, and bot-
tom of the soil ball.

e. Place the plant in the planting hole,

making sure that the crown of plant is
at the same depth as it was previously
growing.

f. Work some organic matter one-fourth

to one-third by volume into the soil.
Place this mixture around the roots un-
til the hole is half full. Settle the soil
around the root system by mucking it
in with the starter solution. Finish fill-
ing the hole with the soil-organic mat-
ter mixture.

g. Tamp the soil firmly around the root

system. Leave a berm to facilitate wa-
tering. Water the newly planted peren-
nials with the starter solution. Label
the plants or make a map of the garden
for future reference.

4. Fertilizing—Perennials need steady, but

light fertilizing first in late March to early
April, right after the last of the mulch is
removed and growth starts. Use a 5-10-5
fertilizer at the rate of 2 pounds per 100
square feet of bed space. Fertilize two
more times at the same rate about 6
weeks apart. Fertilize a final time in very
late summer for fall-blooming perennials.
If the perennial bed or border begins to
lag a bit in midsummer, use a water
soluble foliar fertilizer as a boost. Foliar
feeding should always be thought of as
supplemental to, rather than as a substi-
tute for, granular fertilizers.

Note: Overfertilizing, especially with nitro-

gen, promotes vegetative growth at the
expense of flowering and increases the
need of staking for support.

5. Watering—Frequency is dictated by cli-
mate and the presence of a mulch. Water
early in the day to avoid going into the
evening with wet, disease-susceptible fo-
liage. Water thoroughly, to a depth of 8
to 10 inches, to encourage deep root pen-
etration. Soil should dry out a bit between
watering. Waterlogged soil will encour-
age root disease and excludes oxygen,
resulting in shallow-rooted, drought-
prone, unstable plants.

6. Mulching—Helps control weeds, reduces

water loss, moderates soil temperature
changes, prevents mud splattering of foli-
age and flowers, helps preserve surface
soil structure, and adds nutrients to the
soil as the mulch biodegrades.
Winter mulch can protect perennials from
excessive cold temperatures and harmful
thawing on freezing cycles. Apply after
the first cold weather has occurred and
after the soil has frozen. Cover crowns
with 2 to 6 inches of light, porous mulch.

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 15

Remove mulch in the spring or before
plant growth begins.
Summer mulch can be applied after the
soil warms up, about 4 to 6 weeks after
the last of the winter mulch is removed.
Try to coordinate the placement of the
summer mulch so that it follows one of
the fertilizations and weed-destroying
cultivations. Apply between 1 to 2 inches
of mulch. Be sure to keep the mulch
away from the crown of the herbaceous
perennial.
The best mulches to use are those that
biodegrade to the point that they can be
worked into the soil in late fall or early
spring. Mulches in this category include
compost, peat moss, or smaller-sized
bark.

7. Thinning—Removing out some of the
stems increases the potential size of the
individual blooms produced by the plant.
For the most part, thinning is not neces-
sary as it decreases the mass of the plant
and may reduce the overall bloom impact
of the plant.

8. Pinchin —Inhibits the natural legginess
of many perennials such as chrysanthe-
mums. Pinching the growing tips or
shoots of the individual stems once in
May or June removes the inhibition of
the shoot tip, producing multibranched
shoots. This produces a whole bouquet of
smaller-than-usual individual blooms.
The combined branched shoots give the
entire plant a much greater overall
blooming mass despite the smaller indi-
vidual blooms. Chrysanthemums are
pinched every 3 to 4 weeks with the last
pinch occurring about July 15.
Pinching also delays blooming. A soft
pinch, just the tip of the stem, does not
delay flowering as long as a hard pinch,
which removes several inches and several
nodes from the stems. Pinching also de-
creases the need to stake herbaceous pe-
rennials as the plants are more compact.

9. Weeding—This is important because

weeds compete for nutrients and water.
Weeds may be grassy or broad leafed and
annual, biennial, or perennial. The un-

wanted offspring of existing perennials
may also be considered weeds since
many of them, especially those from hy-
brid parents, will not come true-to-type.
Your first chore is to be able to distin-
guish weeds, even at the seedling stage,
from desirable perennials. Once so distin-
guished, weeding can be done by hand,
with shallow cultivation, with herbicides,
or largely avoided by using mulches.

10. Deadheading—Removal of spent blooms
or inflorescence improves the appearance
of the herbaceous perennials and prevents
the investment of energy in seed produc-
tion. It also encourages the plant to con-
tinue blooming, and stimulates a second
flush of weaker bloom in those plants
such as delphinium and foxglove.
A few perennials such as sedum ‘Autumn
Joy’, Black-eyed-Susan, and ornamental
grasses should be allowed to retain their
seed heads for their winter interest.

11. Disbudding—The removal of all except
the tip-most bud on each individual stem
or branch of a multibranched stem pro-
duces large flowers on each stem or
branch of that stem. Peonies are often
disbudded in this fashion. The most spec-
tacularly sized blooms can be achieved
by taking a rooted cutting and limiting it
to a single terminal bud on a single stem.
One shortcoming of disbudding is that
the second flush of bloom, which occurs
after the terminal bud blooms and the ax-
illary buds develop, is lost. Some garden-
ers remove the terminal bud to obtain a
host of relatively large axillary blooms.
12. Staking—Giving a physical support to
the individual stems or to the plant as a
whole is often necessary for those peren-
nials with a natural tendency to fall over
because of their height, habit, or weight
of blooms and foliage.
Tall, single stems of perennials such as
delphiniums, gladiolus, and hollyhocks
may require individual stakes for support.
Select bamboo, plastic, or metal stakes
that will be at least three-quarters as tall
as the individual stems they are to sup-
port when firmly anchored in the soil.

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 16

Tie the stems to the stakes with a figure
eight loop with one loop around the stake
and the other around the stem. This
double loop acts as a spring giving the
stem a chance to sway in the breeze. The
loops can be made with paper-covered
wire, floral tape, or other soft material.
Stake bushy, multistemmed, floppy pe-
rennials such as asters, chrysanthemums,
and coreopsis by pushing a ring of stakes
into the soil at a point slightly to the inte-
rior of the perennial. Select stakes that
are 6 to 12 inches shorter than the ulti-
mate height of the plant. Weave a cats’
cradle of support between the stakes with
green yarn or floral tape. Start 1 foot
above the soil level and continue upward
at 1-foot intervals until the last cats’
cradle is 8 to 12 inches below the top of
the stems.
Alternatively, push appropriate lengths of
multibranched tree or scrub prunings or
branched bamboo canes into the soil at
the fringes of the perennial. Let the inter-
weaving branches supply most of the
support. Some twine or floral tape may
still be needed to contain the stems of the
perennials.
Place very strong, multi-legged 18- to 20-
inch tall wire hoops around perennials
such as peonies and oriental poppies that
have very heavy blooms on supple stems.

13. Insects and diseases—Practices to pre-
vent or reduce the chance of insect and
disease problems include:
a. Select insect and disease-resistant pe-

rennials.

b. Give your perennials the very best

growing conditions possible from the
standpoint of soil, nutrition, watering,
spacing, sunlight, and air circulation.
c. Grow a variety of plants. A monocul-
ture of a cultivar or of a few cultivars
will be far more susceptible to insect
and disease problems.

d. Remove spent flowers, dead leaves,

and other plant litter during the grow-
ing season when it can be a source of
infestation. Clean up the bed or border
thoroughly before winter to avoid any

refuse harboring insects and disease
over winter.

e. Keep weeds out of the bed or border
and the immediate area because they
are a source of both insect and disease
problems.

f. Know what the most likely common
pests of your perennials are and then
monitor for them.

g. Do not compost any diseased plants. If
your compost pile reaches the 140°F to
160°F, most disease organisms and
insect eggs will be killed. However,
most piles never get this warm, espe-
cially in the outside portion. Fungus
organisms will spread along with com-
post.

h. When a problem is encountered, act
immediately without using pesticides
if possible. Cut off diseased portions
of the herbaceous perennial, or remove
seriously damaged plants entirely.
Handpick large insects.

14. Pesticide control—Consult with your

county Extension educator for the most
bio-rational pesticide to use for your par-
ticular problem.
Spot treat if possible. Use non-chemical,
non-biological pesticides such as horti-
cultural oils and insecticidal soaps.
Use biological pesticides such as Bacillus
thuringiensis for caterpillars, or those
pesticides derived from natural sources
such as pyrethrum, rotenone, ryana, or
sabadilla. When using any pesticide, fol-
low the label instructions for pest con-
trolled and for plants for which the
chemical is labeled. Always apply at the
labeled rate as instructed. Buy small
quantities of the pesticide to avoid dis-
posal problems.

IX. A Selection of Perennials for Idaho
Idaho growing conditions are difficult on
plants. During the summer, temperatures and
light intensity are high and humidity is low.
This combination causes some plants listed for
the eastern United States and lower coastal el-
evations to perform poorly in Idaho. On the
following pages, Table 1 lists perennials avail-

Chapter 18, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

18 - 17

able through the Idaho nursery trade or by
mail-order that have performed well or are
deemed worthwhile for trial in Idaho.
A. Common Name—Lists several names that
the perennial might be called. Cross-refer-
encing is done through the text for conve-
nience. For example, hollyhock is listed
under alcea. Hollyhock is also found under
the common name, which refers back to
alcea for more information.

B. Scientific Name—Since the common name

leaves a lot of guesswork, the scientific
name is included for clarity. Under the sci-
entific name is a listing of cultivars (culti-
vated varieties) that may be available in
your local nursery. The cultivar name (e.g.
‘Pink Star’) many times indicates flower
color.

C. Height—Varies with fertilizer practices,

placement with respect to light, soil condi-
tions, and plant vigor. A range of heights
is given for most plants. Determining exact
heights will be the part of the joy of gar-
dening. Keep records of your discoveries

so that plants can be moved into more cor-
rect locations in the future. A perennial
garden can be arranged and rearranged like
furniture in your home.

D. Bloom Time —Gives you the chance to

“orchestrate” and synchronize the bloom-
ing sequence. Use a sheet of paper to list
and “orchestrate” your flower display.
E. Flower Color—Refers to flower colors

available in the nursery trade. It does not
necessarily refer back to the specific culti-
vars in the scientific name column.

F. Light Needed—Categorizes the plant into
one or more light regimes: full sun is unin-
terrupted sunlight through the full day;
partial shade is filtered sunlight through
tree leaves or a minimum of 6 to 8 hours of
sunlight per day; full shade indicates fil-
tered sunlight through a dense foliage
canopy or less than 6 hours of sunlight
each day.

G. Landscape Use—Suggests planting loca-

tions as well as indoor uses such as cut
flowers or dried flower arrangements.

I. The Vegetable Garden

When planning your garden, ask some basic
questions. Who will be doing the work? Will
the garden be a group project with family
members or friends? Will they work willingly
through the season to a fall harvest, or will you
be handling the hoe alone? Remember, a
small, weed-free garden will produce more
vegetables than a large, weedy mess.
What do you and your family like to eat? Al-
though the pictures in the garden catalog look
delicious, there is no value in taking up gar-
dening space with vegetables that no one eats.
Make a list of your family’s favorite vegetables,
ranked in order of preference. This will serve
as a useful guide in deciding how much of
each vegetable to plant. Successive planting of
certain crops, such as beans, will give a longer
harvest period and increase your yield. List
recommended varieties and planting dates.
How do you plan to use the produce from your
garden? If you plan to can, freeze, dry, or store
part of the produce, this will be a factor not
only in planning the size of the garden but also
in selecting the varieties to be grown. Some
varieties have better storage quality than oth-
ers. Take care in choosing the seeds, to make
sure the varieties you select are adapted to
your area and intended use. A few dollars
spent on buying adapted, quality seed will pay
off in high quality yielding vagetables. How
much space is available? That is, how much

and 20 from the Virginia, Utah, Oregon, and Wash-
ington Master Gardener handbooks and adapted it to
Idaho conditions.

area can be converted into usable garden
space? Empty ground may not mean available
ground.

II. Planning Hints

Plan the garden on paper first. Draw a map
showing the arrangement and spacing of crops.
In your plan, place tall and trellised crops on
the north side of the garden so they won’t
shade the shorter vegetables. Group plants by
length of growing period. Plant spring crops
together so that later crops can be planted in
these areas when the early crops mature. Con-
sider the length of harvest as well as time to
maturity. Place perennial crops to the side of
the garden where they will not be disturbed by
annual tillage. If you wish to keep the garden
growing all season, you may need a spring and
summer garden plan.
Order seeds by January or February. Some
plants may be started indoors as early as mid-
February.

III. Locating the Garden

Vegetables grow best in a level area with
loose, well-drained soil and need at least 6
hours of sun (8 to 10 hours is ideal).  These are
some valuable tips:
1. Avoid placing the garden in low spots, at
the base of a hill, or at the foot of a slope
bordered by a solid fence. These areas are
slow to warm up in the spring; frost settles
in these places, because cold air naturally
drains to low areas. South-facing slopes are
warmer and less subject to damaging frosts.
2. Avoid windy locations. If you must plant in

a windy spot, build or grow a windbreak.
3. Avoid planting near trees and shrubs; they
compete for sunlight, nutrients, and water.

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 2

4. Choose a spot near your home so it is con-

venient to work in the garden when you
have a few minutes. Locate the garden near
a good and easily accessible supply of wa-
ter.

5. Sites too near buildings may result in plants

that do not receive enough sunlight. Ob-
serve shading patterns throughout the grow-
ing season. If you have a shaded area you
wish to use anyway, plant shade-tolerant
crops. Increase effective light by providing
reflective surfaces around plants.

6. Avoid contaminated areas. Locations near

busy roads are subject to airborne lead from
automobile exhaust that can contaminate
vegetables, especially leafy types. If you
must plant in a lead-prone area, try planting
a hedge to trap lead in the air. Locations
where lead-painted buildings once stood
may have soil lead in toxic amounts. If you
are unsure about your chosen location,
check the lead content by having the soil
tested or having leafy vegetable tissue ana-
lyzed. Locations where water runoff from
roads, sidewalks, and driveways enter the
garden may contaminate the soil with salt,
herbicides, and soil sterilant.

7. Use contour rows or terraces on sloped or

hillside sites to avoid erosion.

8. Orient plants and rows for maximum sun-
light. Garden sites too near buildings may
result in plants that do not receive enough
sunlight. Observe shading patterns through-
out the growing season. If you have a
shaded area you wish to use anyway, plant
shade-tolerant crops. Increase effective light
by providing reflective surfaces around
plants.

9. Try not to plant related vegetables in exactly

the same location in the garden more than
once in 3 years. Rotation prevents the
buildup of insects and disease. Use old
plans as guides for rotating crops.

IV. Preparing the Soil

The ideal vegetable garden soil is deep, friable
(easy to cultivate), well-drained, and has a
high organic matter content. Proper soil prepa-
ration provides the basis for good seed germi-
nation and growth of garden crops. Careful use

of various soil amendments can improve gar-
den soil and provide the best possible starting
ground for your crops.
Make basic nutrient and pH adjustments to the
soil by adding fertilizers. In new garden spots,
remove sod with a spade and use it to patch
your lawn or put it in a compost pile to decay.
Round Up can be used to kill the soil before its
tillage.
A. Soil Testing

Check soil fertility and pH by having your
soil analyzed at least once every 3 years.
Soil pH measures the degree of acidity or
alkalinity of the soil. Vegetables differ to
some extent in their requirements, but
most garden crops will do well with a soil
pH of 6.2 to 7.5. If soil pH is too high or
low, poor crop growth will result, largely
because of the effects of pH on the avail-
ability of nutrients to plants. A soil test
will also provide a relative idea of the nu-
trient level in the soil.
Soil test kits are available for checking
soil at home, but their quality and reliabil-
ity differ greatly. Soil samples may also
be sent to your local Extension office for
testing. The Extension educator will mail
results to you with recommendations for
correcting any deficiencies. Private com-
panies also do soil testing and, in many
cases, give detailed reports and recom-
mendations. In either case, tests cost ap-
proximately $30 each. For best results,
carefully follow soil sample instructions.

B. Soil Moisture

The addition of organic matter is the first
step in improving moisture conditions in the
garden. A relatively high level of humus in
the soil, brought about by the addition and
breakdown of organic matter, can improve
this proportion. Humus helps clay particles
to form aggregates, or large clumps or
groups of particles. This increases the size
of the soil pore space, allowing moisture to
drain to lower levels as a reserve, instead of
puddling and running off the top of the soil.
The moisture-holding capacity of sandy
soils is also improved by the addition of or-
ganic matter. Though most soil water in
sandy soil is available, it drains so quickly

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 3

that plants are unable to reach water after a
rain. Humus in sandy soil give the water
something to cling to until it is needed by
plants.
1. Mulching is a cultural practice that can

significantly decrease the amount of wa-
ter that must be added to the soil. A 3- to
4-inch organic mulch can reduce water
needs by as much as one-half by smoth-
ering weeds (which take up and transpire
moisture) and by reducing evaporation of
moisture directly from the soil surface.
Organic mulches themselves hold some
water and increase the humidity level
around the plant that may stimulate dis-
ease development. It may be necessary to
move the mulch a few inches away from
the plant stem.

2. During the summer, clear or black plastic

mulch also conserves moisture and in-
creases soil temperatures dramatically
(clear plastic by 8°F and black plastic by
6°F) to the detriment of some plants and
the benefit of others.

3. Shading and the use of windbreaks are
other moisture-conserving techniques.
Plants that wilt in very sunny areas can
benefit from partial shade during the af-
ternoon in summer. Small plants, in par-
ticular, should be protected. Air moving
across a plant carries away the moisture
on the leaf surfaces, causing the plant to
need more water. In very windy areas,
the roots often cannot keep up with tran-
spiration demands, and plants wilt. In
these areas, temporary or permanent
windbreaks can help tremendously.

C. Fertilizing

The amount of fertilizer to apply to a garden
depends on the natural fertility of the soil,
the amount of organic matter present, the
type of fertilizer used, and the crop being
grown. The best way to determine fertilizer
needs is to have the soil tested.

V. Seed for the Garden

A. Choosing Vegetable Seed

This is one of the most enjoyable gardening
pastimes. Thumbing through colorful cata-
logs and dreaming of the season’s harvest is

one way to make winter seem a little
warmer.
Choose seed from a dependable seed com-
pany. Keep notes about the seeds you pur-
chase: germination qualities, vigor of plants,
and tendencies toward insects and disease.
From this information, you can determine
whether a seed company is meeting your
needs, and whether the varieties you have
chosen are suitable for your area and gar-
dening style. For example, if powdery mil-
dew is a big problem for the squash family,
look for mildew-resistant varieties the next
year.

B. Saving Your Own Vegetable Seed

This pleasurable activity offers a sense of
self-sufficiency and it saves money. You
can maintain a vegetable variety that is not
available commercially. This helps perpetu-
ate a broad genetic base of plant materials.
Breeders often search for old-time varieties
when attempting to improve commercial
plants, since the “heirloom vegetables” of-
ten have inbred disease and pest resistance
or cold hardiness.
Participation in a seed-saver’s exchange can
be rewarding. Your extra seeds can be
traded for unusual types not available
through other sources.
Some considerations to keep in mind when
saving seed include:
1. Hybrid varieties do not produce seed that

is true to parents. Only open-pollinated
varieties should be used for home seed
production. Some seed dealers have re-
sponded to the increasing interest in seed
saving by clearly marking open-polli-
nated varieties in their catalogs.

2. There is the possibility of carrying seed-
borne diseases into the next year’s crop.
Many commercially grown seeds are pro-
duced in dry areas to reduce fungal, viral,
and bacterial diseases that may be present
in your region. Recognize and control
diseases that can be carried in seed.

3. Consider the amount of time it takes to
dry seeds. Drying can be adversely af-
fected by frequent rains, humidity, and
maturity.

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 4

4. If you’ve ever saved squash seed during a
season in which you have more than one
type of squash planted, you have prob-
ably seen the abnormal results that may
be obtained from cross-pollination!

Note: Some common self-pollinated annual
plants from which seed may be saved
include lettuce, beans and peas, herbs,
and tomatoes.

C. Special Case Seeds

When saving seed, be sure to mark the stor-
age containers clearly with permanent (pref-
erably waterproof) ink, indicating the vari-
ety and date saved. Seeds will remain viable
for some time if properly stored (Table 1).
To test for germination, sprout seeds be-
tween moist paper towels. If germination is
low, either discard the seed or plant enough
extra to give the desired number of plants.
1. Beans and peas—Allow seed pods to turn
brown on the plant. Harvest the pods, dry
for 1 to 2 weeks, shell, and then store the
seeds in a cool (below 50°F), dry envi-
ronment in a paper bag.

2. Lettuce seed—Cut off seed stalks when
they are fluffy in appearance, just before
all the seeds are completely dried. Seeds
will fall off the stalk and be lost if al-
lowed to mature on the plant. Dry the

harvested seed stalk further, shake off the
seeds, and store them in a cool, dry envi-
ronment in an envelope or small glass jar.
3. Herb seeds—Herbs vary in the way their

seeds are produced. In general, allow
herb seeds to stay on the plants until they
are almost completely dry. Some seed
heads, such as dill, will shatter and drop
their seeds as soon as they are dry. Watch
the early-ripening seeds. If they tend to
fall off, harvest the other seed heads be-
fore they get to that point, leaving several
inches of stem attached. Hang several
stems upside down; cover them with a
paper bag to catch falling seed. Place
them in a warm, dry place until the dry-
ing is complete. Remove seeds from the
seed heads and store in envelopes or
small glass jars. Some herb seeds, such as
dill, celery, anise, cumin, coriander, and
others, are used for flavoring and are
ready to use once dry.

4. Tomato seeds—Pick fruit from desirable

plants when ripe. Cut the fruit and
squeeze the pulp into a container. Add a
little water, then let the pulp ferment 2 to
4 days at room temperature, stirring occa-
sionally. When the seeds settle out, pour
off the pulp and spread the seeds thinly,
and dry thoroughly. Store in an envelope
or glass jar in a cool, dry place.

D. Planting Vegetable Seeds

The depth to cover seeds when you plant
them depends on factors such as the size of
the seed, the type of soil you have, and the
season of the year.
As a general rule, vegetable and flower
seeds should be covered about three times
their lateral diameter or width (not their
length). However, there are exceptions. You
should read the packet directions.
Some seeds require light for germination
and should not be covered at all. These in-
structions apply to seeds planted both inside
and outside.

VI. Starting Seed Indoors

Starting seeds indoors for transplanting is an
important aspect of intensive gardening. To get
the most from the garden plot, a new crop
should be ready to take the place of the crop
being removed. Several weeks may be gained
by having 6-inch transplants ready to go into
vacated areas. Don’t forget to recondition the
soil for the new plants.
A. Light

To start seeds indoors, it is important to
have enough light. More homegrown seed-
lings are probably lost to this one factor
than to any other.
Vegetable seedlings grown under low light
conditions are likely to be leggy and weak.
They fall over under their own weight after
they are 3 to 4 inches tall.
If you do not have a sunny room or back
porch with a southern exposure, you will
need supplemental lights. A simple fluores-
cent shop light with one warm-white and
one cool-white bulb (or grow lights) will
suffice.
B. Media

It is easiest to use a mix containing peat to
start seedlings, since garden soil contains
disease organisms that can be highly de-
structive to small plants.
Garden soil high in clay should be condi-
tioned with compost or perlite to prevent
excess moisture and/or shrinkage. Mix
your own soilless media if you prefer; 50
percent vermiculite or perlite and 50 percent

fine sphagnum peat is excellent for starting
seeds. Fertilizer, at half the normal strength,
can be added to the mixture. Mix well be-
fore using.
Soil can be sterilized in the oven by baking
it at 220°F until the internal soil temperature
is 180°F. It should be held at that tempera-
ture for 30 minutes. This may be an odorous
process, but it works.

C. Containers

Many types of containers can be used to
start seeds.
1. Flats or other large containers can be

used. Plant in rows and grow seedlings
until they have one or two sets of true
leaves, then transplant into other contain-
ers for growing to the size to transplant
outdoors.

2. Seedlings may also be started in pots, old

cans, cut-off milk cartons, margarine
tubs, egg cartons, or other throwaways.
The pop-out trays found at garden centers
are easy to use and are reusable.

3. Peat pots are nice, especially for large
seeds. Sow one or two large seeds di-
rectly into each peat pot. Thin to one
seedling per pot. Peat pots can be planted
directly in the garden, but do not allow
the edges of the pot to stick out above the
soil. The edges will act as a wick and
moisture will evaporate from this ex-
posed surface.
D. Starting the Seeds

Regardless of the type of container chosen,
fill it three-fourths full with seed-starting
mixture and sow the seeds. Cover to the
specified depth and water the mix.
If your home is dry, it may help to cover the
containers with plastic wrap to maintain a
uniform moisture level since seeds and
seedlings are extremely sensitive to drying
out. However, seeds should not be kept
soaking wet since this condition is condu-
cive to damping-off, a fungus disease
deadly to seedlings. Damping-off can be
prevented or diminished by sprinkling
milled sphagnum moss, which contains a
natural fungicide, on top of the soil.
Another option for seedling production is to
use peat pellets or cubes. These are pre-

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 6

formed and require no added soil mix. Many
home gardeners make their own soil cubes
using low cost, homemade molds. The pel-
lets or cubes are soaked until thoroughly wet.
Then seeds are planted in the holes provided.
The whole pellet or cube may be planted
without disturbing the roots. The only disad-
vantage to this method is the expense.

VII. Starting Seed Outdoors

(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)Many seeds may be sown directly in the gar-
den. If garden soil is quite sandy, or is easy to
work because of the high content of organic
matter, seeds may be planted deeper. Young
seedlings will emerge easily from a sandy or
organic soil. Fast emergence can reduce the
chance of seedling disease.
If garden soil texture has a high silt and
clay content, the seeds should be covered
with only two to three times their diameter.
In such soils, it may be helpful to apply a
band of sand, fine compost, or vermiculite
4 inches wide and 1/4 inch deep along the
row after seeds are planted. This will help
retain soil moisture and reduce crusting,
then seedlings can easily push through the
soil surface.
A thin, clear plastic film may be used to
cover the planted seeds. It will raise the soil
temperatures and hold the moisture, speed-
ing up the germination process. The plastic
should be removed after germination starts
to prevent burning of the new plants.
Soil temperature has an effect on the rate of
seed germination. In the spring, soil is often
cold, and seeds of some plants will rot be-
fore they have a chance to sprout. Table 2
lists optimum soil temperatures.

VIII. Planting the Fall Garden

When planting the fall garden in midsum-
mer, the soil will be warm and dry. There-
fore, cover the seeds six to eight times their
diameter. A light organic mulch can keep
soil cool and moist. It can be removed after
emergence. Deep planting can produce
stress on emerging seedlings.
Seedlings may need to be watered each day
with a sprinkler or a sprinkling can to pro-
mote germination.

Moisture can also be retained with a shallow
mulch or by covering the row with a board un-
til the seeds are up.
Shading the area may be helpful to keep the
soil cooler for seed germination, especially
when planting cool weather crops such as on-
ions, peas, radishes, and lettuce in summer.
Seed that requires a lower germination tem-
perature may benefit from being kept in the
refrigerator for 2 weeks before planting. These
seeds may also benefit from presprouting in-
doors. Presprouting is a useful technique for
planting in cold soils as well.
Handle seed carefully once sprouted to prevent
damaging new root tissue.

IX. Planting Methods

A. Row Planting

A string stretched between stakes or home-
made row markers can provide a guide for
straight rows. Use a hoe handle, a special
furrow hoe, or a grub hoe to make a furrow
of the appropriate depth for the seed being
planted. Sow seed thinly; it may help to mix
very small seed with coarse sand to distrib-
ute the seeds more evenly. Draw soil over
the seed, removing stones and large clods.
Firming soil over seeds improves the uptake
of soil moisture and hastens germination.
Water the seeds in to improve soil-to-seed
contact. When plants have grown 4 to 6
inches tall, thin according to seed packet
instructions.

B. Broadcast Planting

Many crops can be sown in wide rows or
beds instead of in long, single rows. Crops
such as spinach, beans, peas, beets, lettuce,
and carrots are especially suited to this type
of culture.
Sow seed evenly over the area, then rake it
in. Firm soil over the seeds. Thin young
plants to allow room for growth.

C. Hill Planting

Larger vegetables, such as melons, squash,
corn, and cucumbers, may be planted in
hills. Soil is mounded to a foot or so in di-
ameter, at the recommended spacing. Plant
4 to 6 seeds per hill, firming the soil well.
Thin the seedlings to 3 to 5 plants per hill.

X. Intensive Gardening Methods

The purpose of an intensively grown garden is
to harvest the most produce possible from a
given space. More traditional gardens consist
of long, single rows of vegetables spaced
widely apart. Much of the garden area is taken
by the space between the rows. An intensive
garden reduces wasted space to a minimum.
The intensive ideal is to have something grow-
ing in every part of the garden at all times dur-
ing the growing season.
A good intensive garden requires early, thor-
ough planning to make the best use of time and
space in the garden. Interrelationships of plants
must be considered before planting. Evaluate
nutrient needs, shade tolerance, above- and be-

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 8

low-ground growth patterns, and preferred
growing season.
Using such techniques as raised beds, vertical
gardening, interplanting, spacing and relay
planting you can develop a high-yielding in-
tensive garden.
A. Raised Bed

This type of bed, also called the growing
bed is the basic unit of an intensive garden.
The raised bed allows the gardener to con-
centrate soil preparation in small areas, re-
sulting in effective use of soil amendments
and creating an ideal environment for veg-
etable growth. Beds are generally 3 to 4 feet
wide and as long as desired. The gardener
works from either side of the bed, reducing
the incidence of compaction caused when
walking on the soil to work it.
Soil preparation is the key to successful in-
tensive gardening. If your soil is not deep,
double-dig the beds for best results. Remove
the top 12 inches of soil from the bed. Insert
a spade or spading fork into the next 10 to
12 inches of soil and wiggle the handle back
and forth to break up compacted layers. Do
this every 6 to 8 inches in the bed.
Mix the topsoil with a generous amount of
compost or manure, and return the mixture
to the bed. It should be somewhat fluffy and
may be raised slightly. To create a true
raised bed, take topsoil from the neighbor-
ing pathways and mix it in as well.
To grow so closely together, plants must
have adequate nutrients and water. Provid-
ing extra synthetic fertilizers and irrigation
will help, but there is no substitute for deep,
fertile soil high in organic matter. Humus-
rich soil holds extra nutrients; and existing
elements locked in the soil are released by
the actions of earthworms, microorganisms,
and acids present in a life-filled soil, making
them available for plant use.
By nature, raised beds are a form of wide-
bed gardening, a technique by which seeds
and transplants are planted in wide bands of
several rows or broadcast in a wide strip.
The goal of this technique is to space plants
at equidistant from each other on all sides,
so that, at maturity, plant leaves touch. The
close planting saves space and reduces
moisture loss from surrounding soil.

B. Vertical Gardening

The use of trellises, nets, strings, cages, or
poles to support growing plants constitutes
vertical gardening. This technique is espe-
cially suited, but not limited, to gardeners
with a small garden space.
Vining and sprawling plants, such as cu-
cumbers, tomatoes, melons, and pole beans,
are obvious candidates for this type of gar-
dening. Some plants entwine themselves
onto the support, while others need to be
tied. Some varieties of squash, cucumbers,
and watermelons are bush type and are more
suitable for intensive gardening.
A vertical planting will cast a shadow, so
beware of shading sun-loving crops. Take
advantage of the shade by planting shade-
tolerant crops near the vertical ones.
Plants grown vertically take up much less
space on the ground, and though the yield
per plant may be less, the yield per square
foot of garden space is much greater.
Because vertically growing plants are more
exposed, they dry out faster and may need
to be watered more frequently than if they
were allowed to spread over the ground.
This fast drying is also an advantage to
those plants susceptible to fungus diseases.
A higher rate of fertilization may be needed
for vertically growing plants, and soil
should be deep and well drained to allow
roots to extend vertically rather than com-
plete with others at a shallow level.

C. Interplanting

Growing two or more types of vegetables in
the same place at the same time is known as
interplanting. Proper planning is essential to
obtain high production and increased quality
of the crops planted. Interplanting has been
practiced for thousands of years in Europe
and Japan but is just now gaining wide-
spread support in this country.
1. To successfully plan an interplanted gar-
den, consider these factors for each plant:
a. Length of the plant’s growth period, its

growth pattern (tall, short, below or
above ground).

b. Its possible negative effects on other

plants (e.g., allelopathic effects of sun-

flowers and Jerusalem artichokes on
nearby plants).

c. Its preferred season.
d. Its light, nutrient, and moisture re-

quirements.

2. Interplanting can be accomplished by al-
ternating rows within a bed (plant a row
of peppers next to a row of onion), by
mixing plants within a row, or by distrib-
uting various species throughout the bed.
For the beginner, alternating rows may be
the easiest to manage.

3. Long season (slow to mature) and short
season (quick to mature) plants such as
carrots and radishes, respectively, can be
planted at the same time. The radishes are
harvested before they begin to crowd the
carrots. Smaller plants can be planted
close to larger plants (e.g., radishes at the
base of beans or broccoli). Shade-tolerant
species such as lettuce, spinach, and cel-
ery can be planted in the shadow of taller
crops. Heavy feeders, such as cabbage
family crops, can be interplanted with
less gluttonous plants.

4. Interplanting can help keep insect and

disease problems under control. Pests are
usually fairly crop specific, that is, they
prefer vegetables of one type or family.
Mixing families of plants helps break up
large expanses of the pest-preferred crop,
helping to contain early pest damage
within a small area, and giving you a
little more time to deal with the problem.

Note: Spraying for pests becomes more diffi-

cult with the interplanting method.

D. Spacing

In this technique, individual plants are
closely spaced in a raised bed or inter-
planted garden.
An equidistant spacing pattern calls for
plants to be the same distance from each
other within the bed. Plant so that the center
of one plant is the same distance from the
plants on all sides of it. In beds of more than
two rows, this means that the rows should
be staggered so that plants in every other
row are between the plants in adjacent rows.

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 9

The distance recommended on the seed
packet for plants within the row is the dis-
tance from the center of one plant to the
center of the next (Table 3). However,
plants should not be crowded to the point
that disease causes problems or competition
causes stunting.
This technique results in an efficient use of
space. The close spacing creates a nearly
solid leaf canopy, acts as a living mulch,
decreases water loss from bare ground, and
minimizes weed problems.

E. Succession or Relay Planting

To obtain a succession of crops, plant some-
thing new in spots vacated by spent plants
(such as planting corn after peas).
Planting a spring, summer, and fall garden
is another form of succession planting. Cool
season crops (broccoli, lettuce, peas) are
followed by warm season crops (beans, to-
matoes, peppers). Where possible, these

Note: To determine spacing for interplanting, add the inches for the
two crops to be planted together, and divide the sum by two.
For example, if radishes are planted next to beans, add 2
inches + 4 inches = 6 inches, then divide 6 inches by 2 = 3
inches. The radishes should be planted 3 inches from the
beans.

*Miniature varieties or trellising may increase value per square foot.

may be followed by more cool season
plants, or even a winter crop.
The new planting can be made before the
old one is removed. For instance, sweet corn
may be planted in 2-week intervals for a
continuous harvest. This requires some care.
Crops planted early are likely to get a
slower start because of low temperatures. In
the case of corn, it can be disastrous to have
two varieties pollinating at the same time,
because the quality of the kernels may be
affected. For best results, give early planted
corn extra time to get started.
Another way to achieve a lengthy harvest is
to plant different varieties of the same veg-
etable at the same time (e.g., plant early sea-
son, midseason, and late-season corn).

XI. Transplants for the Garden

Most gardeners use transplants in the garden to
give long season plants a chance to grow to
maturity or just to lengthen the harvest season.
In short season areas, crops such as head let-
tuce, broccoli, and celery may not reach their
prime harvest stage if not given those extra
weeks indoors to get a head start. Tomatoes
would have a short harvest period if started
from seed in the ground, and peppers and egg-
plants might not produce at all unless they are
grown from transplants. See Table 4 for a rat-
ing of many vegetables and their tolerance for
transplating.

Because of the amount of time, attention, and
need for controlled growing conditions, many
gardeners prefer to purchase plants for their
gardens. However, for a larger choice in vari-
eties and the control of plant production from
seed to harvest, others choose to start their
own.
A. Annual Plants

Transplants of annual vegetables and flow-
ers should be stocky, healthy, free from dis-
ease and insects, and should have good
roots. Plants should not be too small or too
mature.
1. Be sure plants have been hardened-off so
that they will easily adapt to environmen-
tal change. Avoid hardened plants that
are woody and yellow.

2. Successful transplanting is achieved by

interrupting plant growth as little as pos-
sible, an advantage provided by peat pots
and peat pellets, neither of which have to
be removed when transplanting.

3. Have garden soil prepared before trans-
planting. All additives that require time
to break down, such as manures, sulfur,
limestone, rock fertilizers, and green ma-
nures, should be incorporated several
weeks before planting. Quick-acting (hy-
drated) lime for low pH soils, fertilizers,
and well-decayed compost may be added
just before planting.

4. Transplant on a shady day, in late after-
noon, or in early evening to prevent or
reduce wilting. Water the plants several
hours before transplanting. When using
bare root plants, such as sweet potato
slips, soak the roots thoroughly an hour
or two before setting them out in the gar-
den. They should not be allowed to dry
out completely at any time.

5. Handle plants carefully. Avoid disturbing

the roots or bruising the stems.

6. Dig a hole large enough to hold the roots
of the plants. Set vegetable plants slightly
deeper than previously planted and at rec-
ommended intervals. Tomatoes are an
exception. They will develop roots all
along the stems, and you can plant deeply
enough to leave only two or three sets of
leaves exposed. Press soil firmly around

the roots of transplants. Pour about a cup
of starter fertilizer solution in the hole
around the plant. Use a half-strength so-
lution for that type of plant during the
normal growing season. Fish emulsion or
diluted manure tea can also be used.

7. For a few days after transplanting, protect

the plants from wind and sun by placing
newspaper or cardboard on the south side
of the plant, or by covering them with
jugs, baskets, or flower pots.

8. Water the plants once or twice during the

next week. Overwatering can cause
damping-off.
B. Perennial Plants

When buying small fruit plants and peren-
nial crowns (asparagus and rhubarb), order
early or buy from reliable local outlets.
It pays to do some research about perennial
plants. Determine the major diseases and
insect pests and then buy resistant varieties.
Investigate whether any plants are re-
stricted. The Idaho Department of Agricul-
ture in Boise may quarantine plants from
some areas of the country.
1. Select varieties that will do well in your

growing conditions. Check crowns for
signs of viable buds. Avoid plants with
roots and stems that are brown or soggy
black, which indicates poor storage or
diseased stock. Inspect plants for signs of
insects. If you receive plants by mail that
are not satisfactory, do not hesitate to
send them back.

2. Once you have the plants, keep the roots

moist (but not soaking wet) by misting
occasionally, and do not allow them to
freeze or be exposed to high tempera-
tures. If it is necessary to keep the crowns
for more than a few days, place them in
cold storage (not freezing) or else heel
into a trench of moist soil in a shaded lo-
cation, then pack soil firmly against the
roots to eliminate any air pockets.

3. Transplant crowns according to direc-

tions, digging holes large enough to give
the roots plenty of room to spread. Re-
move any roots that are discolored or
dried out. Do not mix compost at the bot-
tom of the hole as it may prevent water

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 11

from moving across a boundary of dis-
similar materials. It can also inhibit root
elongation out of the planting hole, in-
creasing the likelihood of drought and
heat stress.

4. Once transplanted, shade the plants, and
water when needed. Extra care at the be-
ginning of their growth will result in pro-
ductive, healthy plants.

XII. Irrigating the Home Garden

During times when cultural practices simply
aren’t enough, that is when rainfall is sparse
and the sun is hot, watering may benefit the
garden with higher yields. Watering may save
the garden by aiding in seedling emergence;
reducing or increasing soil crusting; improving
germination and plant stand; reducing wilting
and stimulating growth in transplants; increas-
ing fruit size of tomato, cucumber, and melon;
and maintaining uniform plant growth.
A. Plant Water Requirements

These may be lower in the early spring and
late fall when temperatures are low. Check
specifications for your soil temperature and
type to be sure of the necessary water
amount. Keep a rain gauge near the garden
or check with the local weather bureau for
rainfall amounts, then supplement rainfall
with irrigation water if needed.
1. A healthy plant is composed of 75 to 90

percent water, which is used for the
plant’s vital functions, including photo-
synthesis, support (rigidity), and trans-
portation of nutrients and sugars to vari-
ous parts of the plant. During the first 2
weeks of growth, plants are becoming
established and must have water to build
their root systems. From April to Septem-
ber, vegetable crops need about 1 inch of
water per week in the form of rainwater,
irrigation water, or both.

2. During dry periods, one thorough water-
ing each week of 1 to 2 inches of mois-
ture (65 to 130 gallons per 100 square
feet) is usually enough for most soils.
Soil should be wetted to a depth of 5 to 6
inches each watering and not watered
again until the top few inches begin to
dry out. Average garden soil will store

about 2 to 2 1/2 inches of water available
to plants per foot of depth.

3. All water in the soil may not be available

to plants, particularly if the soil is fine
textured. Clay particles hold soil moisture
tightly. If, for example, there are 4 1/2
inches of water per foot of fine-textured
soil, there may be as little as 1 1/2 inches
available water for plants.

B. Irrigating Equipment

The home gardener has several options for
applying water to plants: a sprinkler water-
ing can, a garden hose with a fan nozzle or
spray attachment, a portable lawn sprinkler,
a perforated plastic soaker hose, a drip or
trickle irrigation system, or a semiautomatic
drip system. Quality equipment will last for
many years when properly cared for.

C. Irrigating Techniques

When deciding on which type of watering
equipment to use, consider the following
basic techniques for watering:
1. Adjust the flow or rate of water applica-
tion to about 1/2 inch per hour. A faster
rate will cause runoff, unless the soil has
exceptionally good drainage. To deter-
mine the rate for a sprinkler, place small
tin cans at various places within the
sprinkler’s reach, and check the level of
water in the cans at 15-minute intervals.
2. When using the oscillating type of lawn
sprinklers, place the sprinkler on a plat-
form higher than the crop to prevent wa-
ter from being diverted by plant leaves.
Try to keep the watering pattern even by
frequently moving the sprinkler, overlap-
ping about one-half of each pattern.

3. Avoid getting foliage wet in the evening,
as you can encourage diseases. Morning
watering is preferred.

4. Place perforated plastic hoses or soaker
hoses with holes down along one side of
the crop row or underneath mulch, so that
water is allowed to soak or seep into the
soil slowly.

5. It is best to add enough water to soak the

soil to a depth of 5 to 6 inches. It takes
approximately 2/3 gallon of water for
each square foot or 65 to 130 gallons for

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 12

100 square feet of garden area. This var-
ies with the nature of the soil. Frequent,
light waterings encourages shallow root-
ing that causes plants to suffer more
quickly during drought periods, espe-
cially if mulches are not used. On the
other hand, too much water, especially in
poorly drained soils, can be as damaging
to plant growth as too little water.

6. Know the critical watering periods for

selected vegetables. You can reduce the
amount of supplemental water you add,
which can be important where water sup-
plies are limited. Water is most needed
during the first few weeks of develop-
ment, immediately after transplanting,
and during development of edible storage
organs.

7. In areas prone to repeated drought, look
for drought-resistant varieties when buy-
ing seed or plants.

D. Irrigating with Grey Water

If water supplies are short in your area, con-
sider using grey water (water from house-
hold uses) on your vegetable garden. How-
ever, a few rules should be observed:
1. Do not use “black water” (any water run
through the toilet) because of the possi-
bility of contamination from fecal organ-
isms.

2. It is preferable not to use kitchen waste

water that contains grease or harsh clean-
ers, ammonia, bleach, softeners, or
nonbiodegradable detergents.

3. If using water from the bathtub or wash-
ing machine, use only mild, biodegrad-
able soaps. Omit softeners and bleaches.
Allow wash and rinse water to mix, if
possible, to dilute the soap content. Never
use a borax-containing product (such as
washing soda) in water to be used on a
garden because of the danger of applying
plant-toxic levels of boron.

4. Apply grey water to the soil, but not to

plant leaves.

XIII. Controlling Weeds in the Garden
The old saying, “One year’s weed, seven
years’ seed,” contains more truth than myth, as

most gardeners soon learn. Weeds (some na-
tive and some introduced) are remarkably
adapted to conditions in the area where they
grow, usually much more so than the imported
cultured vegetables we prize so highly for
food. Many weeds that would otherwise not be
growing in a lawn or natural area spring up as
if by magic when the soil is cultivated.
There are several ways to rid the garden of
most problem plants. Since mature weeds ex-
tract large quantities of moisture and nutrients
from the soil, it is more beneficial (and easier)
to remove weeds when they are young and ten-
der.
A. Cultivation

Hand pulling and digging weeds in small
gardens and raised beds works well. Hoeing
is preferred in larger spaces. Manual pow-
ered rotary cultivators do a good job on long
rows and pathways if the soil is not too wet
or dry and if the weeds are not too big.
1. A rotary tiller of appropriate size makes
the work easy and fast, but it is not the
most pleasant chore to get behind a
smoky, noisy engine on a hot summer
day. Manual and powered rotary cultiva-
tors are usually a poor choice of tool to
use to control weeds near vegetable
plants since use may inspire vegetbles.
Hand pulling or hoeing with a light touch
are best for removing weeds near veg-
etable plants. Deep cultivation with any
instrument is likely to damage roots or
stems of crop plants.

2. Turning under weeds, especially before
they flower, provides organic matter to
the soil. Hand pulled weeds, except for
rhizomatous grasses, may be laid on top
of the soil to dry out and will eventually
have the same effect. If rain is predicted
in the area within a day or two, it is best
to collect the weeds and add them to the
compost pile. Rain will wash soil around
the roots and some weeds will survive. If
weeds have started to go to seed, leaving
them in the garden is not a good idea.

3. Composting may not destroy weed seeds

if the pile doesn’t heat up enough after
the weeds are added. Grasses that spread
by rhizomes or stolons also present a

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 13

problem if not completely dried up. In
these cases, despite their potential value
as organic material, it is better to let the
trash collectors take these weeds.

4. Reducing weed growth around the garden
by mowing or other means will also help
prevent the spread of weeds and seeds to
the garden area.

5. Cultivation is best done when the soil is
somewhat moist, but not wet. A day or
two after a rain or irrigation is the best
time to cultivate. Working wet soil will
damage the structure, especially of fine-
textured soils. When it is too dry, weeds
are difficult to pull and hoeing is also
hard.

6. If you have a choice, remember that the
work will be much more pleasant in the
cool temperatures of early morning or
late evening.

B. Mulching

If you have a reliable source of mulching
materials you can reduce the need for weed-
ing. Thick layers of organic mulch will pre-
vent most annual seeds to poke through, and
those that do are usually easily pulled.
1. Mulching with black plastic is a good

choice for controlling weeds with runners.

2. Use newspaper, old carpeting, or other
such materials, or sawdust or bark, as
mulch materials for paths. These provide
excellent weed suppression.

3. Uncomposted sawdust is not recom-

mended for use next to plants. It has a
tendency to crust, and soil microbes re-
duce the amount of nitrogen available to
the vegetables.

C. Close Spacing

When spaced close to each other, estab-
lished vegetable plants will shade the soil
and prevent the growth of many weed seed-
lings. This is the effect achieved by a well-
planned raised bed. The plants are spaced so
that the foliage of adjacent plants touches
and forms a closed canopy at a mature
growth stage.

D. Other Practices

Some gardeners are experimenting with
various types of no-till gardening. The fol-

lowing techniques are still in the experimen-
tal stage for home gardeners. Try them in
small sections of the garden to determine
their effectiveness.
1. One method is to plant a cover crop in

the fall, kill it with a herbicide in the
spring, then plant vegetables in the dead
sod after a recommended waiting period.
However, there are no herbicides recom-
mended for use in established home veg-
etable gardens to kill emerged weeds at
the present time. Use of weed killers nor-
mally recommended for lawns or other
areas is not advised, and until a safe her-
bicide is available for growing weeds,
this type of no-till practice is unsafe for
growing vegetables in the home garden.
2. Another method is the use of a living sod

that is mowed regularly. This has many
of the benefits of no-till gardening and
does not necessitate the use of herbicides.
The living sod method is a good choice
for raised beds, so that only the paths
need to be mowed.

3. The use of cover crops over several sea-
sons or years in a particularly weedy sec-
tion can also reduce weed problems. This
method requires leaving the cover crop
section uncultivated, which reduces gar-
dening space. Cover crops must also be
cut or harvested regularly, which can be
time-consuming and difficult without ap-
propriate tools.

4. Investigate crop rotations thoroughly be-

fore using them to control weeds.

E. Herbicides

As mentioned before, herbicides may be
used in and around the home garden, but it
can be risky business, if knowledgeable ap-
plications are not made. They should always
be used according to label instructions and
only for crops listed on the label. The wrong
herbicide can destroy garden productivity
for many years.
1. Even when used properly, drift from her-

bicide sprays used on lawns or in areas
surrounding the garden can cause damage
to vegetable plants. Spray on windless
days and erect barriers to protect plants if
necessary. Drift from preemergence her-

19 - 14

bicides does not damage growing plants
but may prevent seeds from germinating.
2. Be aware that treatment with an herbicide

for one type of weed may result in the
area being colonized by other weeds that
are tolerant to the chemical.

3. Finally, never use an herbicide in the

same sprayer used for insect and disease
control. Keep a separate sprayer for her-
bicides.

XIV. Container Gardening

If you don’t have space for a vegetable garden,
or if your present site is too small, consider
raising fresh, nutritious homegrown vegetables
in containers. A window sill, patio, balcony, or
doorstep can provide sufficient space for a pro-
ductive container garden. Problems with soil-
borne diseases, nematodes, or poor soil can be
overcome by switching to container gardening.
Grow vegetables that take up little space. Car-
rots, radishes and lettuce, or crops that bear

fruits over a period of time, such as tomatoes
and peppers, make the best use of space and
containers. Dwarf or miniature varieties often
mature and bear fruit early, but most do not
produce as well overall as standard varieties.
With increasing interest in container garden-
ing, plant breeders and seed companies are
working on vegetables specifically bred for
container culture. These varieties are not nec-
essarily miniature or dwarf and may produce
as well as standard types if properly cared for
(Table 5).
The amount of sunlight your container garden
spot receives may determine which crops can
be grown. Generally, root crops and leaf crops
can tolerate partial shade, but vegetables
grown for their fruits generally need at least 5
hours of full, direct sunlight each day, and per-
form better with 8 to 10 hours. Available light
can be increased somewhat by providing re-
flective materials around the plants (e.g., alu-
minum foil, white-painted surfaces, marble
chips).

A. Containers

Possible containers for gardening are clay,
wood, plastic, and metal. Containers for
vegetable plants must be big enough to sup-
port plants when they are fully grown, must
hold soil without spilling, must have ad-
equate drainage, and must be free from con-
tamination (e.g., herbicide residue).
1. Consider using barrels, cutoff milk jugs,

window boxes, and baskets lined with
plastic (with drainage holes punched in
them), or even pieces of drainage pipe or
cement blocks.

2. If you are building a planting box out of

wood, you will find redwood and cedar to
be the most rot resistant, but bear in mind
that cedar trees are much more available
than redwoods. Wood for use around
plants should never be treated with creo-
sote or pentachlorophenol (penta) wood
preservatives. These may be toxic to
plants and harmful to people as well.

3. Some gardeners have built vertical plant-

ers out of wood lattice lined with black
plastic and then filled with a lightweight
medium. Others build planters out of
welded wire shaped into cylinders, lined
with sphagnum moss, and filled with soil
mix. Depending on the size of your verti-
cal planter, 2-inch diameter perforated
plastic pipes may be needed inside to aid
watering.

4. Whatever type of container you use, be

sure that there are holes in the bottom for
drainage so that plant roots do not stand
in water. Most plants need containers at
least 6 to 8 inches deep for adequate root-
ing.

5. For ease of care, dollies or platforms with
wheels or casters can be used to move the
containers from place to place. This is
especially useful for apartment or bal-
cony gardening so that plants can be
moved to get maximum use of available
space and sunlight and to avoid destruc-
tion from particularly nasty weather.

B. Media

Uneless your garden has sandy loam or
sandy soil, a lightweight potting mix is
needed for container vegetable gardening.

Soil straight from the garden usually cannot
be used in a container because it may be too
light textured. Container medium must be
porous in order to support plants, because
roots require both air and water.
Packaged potting soil available at local gar-
den centers is relatively lightweight and
makes a good container medium. Mixes
such as peat-like mix are generally too light
for container vegetable gardening. They do
not offer enough support to plant roots.
Soilless mixes are sterile and contain few
nutrients, so even though major fertilizers
are added, no trace elements are available
for good plant growth. Add soil or compost
if you wish to use a soilless mix as a base.
For a large container garden, the expense of
prepackaged or soilless mixes may be quite
high.

C. Planting

Plant container crops at the same time as
you would in planting a regular garden.
Fill a clean container to within 1/2 inch of
the top with a slightly damp soil mixture.
Peat moss in the mix will absorb water and
mix much more readily if soaked with warm
water before putting the mix in the con-
tainer.
1. Sow the seeds or set transplants accord-
ing to instructions on the seed package.
Put a label with the name, variety, and
date of planting on or in each container.
2. After planting, gently soak the soil with
water, being careful not to wash out or
displace seeds.

3. Thin seedlings to obtain proper spacing

when the plants have two or three leaves.

4. If cages, stakes, or other supports are

needed, provide them when the plants are
very small to avoid root damage later.

D. Watering

Pay particular attention to watering con-
tainer plants. Because the volume of soil is
relatively small, containers can dry out
quickly, especially on a concrete patio in
full sun. Daily or twice daily watering may
be necessary.
1. One sign of dry soil is wilting plants.

Check containers at least once a day, and

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 16

twice on hot, or windy days. Feel the soil
to determine whether it is damp.

2. Mulching and windbreaks can help re-

duce water requirements for containers. If
you must be away from the garden for
long periods of time, consider an auto-
matic drip emitter irrigation system.

3. Apply water until it runs out the drainage

holes. On an upstairs balcony, this may
mean neighbor problems, so make provi-
sions for drainage of water. Large trays
filled with coarse marble chips work
nicely. The soil should never be soggy or
have water standing on top of it.

4. Clay pots and other porous containers al-
low additional evaporation from the sides
of the pots and watering must be done
more often. If the soil appears to be get-
ting excessively dry, group the containers
together so that the foliage creates struc-
tures that will allow air movement be-
neath the pots and prevent direct contact
with the cement.

E. Fertilizing

If you use a soil mix with fertilizer added,
then your plants will have enough nutrients
for 8 to 10 weeks. If plants are grown longer
than this, add a water-soluble fertilizer, dry
fertilizer (slow release), manure, or compost
at the recommended rate. Repeat every 2 to
3 weeks. An occasional dose of fish emul-
sion or compost will add trace elements to
the soil.
Do not add more than the recommended rate
of any fertilizer, since this may cause fertil-
izer burn and kill the plants. Container
plants do not have the buffering capacity of
large volumes of soil and humus to protect
them from overfertilizing or overliming.
Just because a little is good for the plants
does not guarantee that a lot will be better.

F. General Care

Vegetables grown in containers can be at-
tacked by the various types of insects and
diseases that are common to any vegetable
garden.
1. Plants should be periodically inspected
for the presence of foliage-feeding and
fruit-feeding insects as well as the occur-
rence of diseases.

2. Protect plants from very high heat caused
by light reflecting from pavement. Move
them to a cool spot or shade them during
severe rain, hail, or wind storms, and for
protection from early fall frosts.

G. Indoor Container Gardening

If you want fresh, homegrown vegetables
over the winter, or if you don’t have an out-
door space in which you can place contain-
ers, it is worth trying some indoor container
gardening. Of course, you cannot have a full
garden in the house, but a bright, sunny
window can be the site for growing fresh
food all year.
1. Some small-fruited tomatoes and pep-
pers, several types of lettuce, radishes,
Swiss chard, and many herbs are among
the plants you can include in the indoor
garden.

2. Plants dry out less quickly indoors than

outdoors and also grow more slowly.
They need less fertilizer and less water.
To make watering easy, set the pots in
large trays with an inch or two of decora-
tive stones in them. Not only will this
prevent your having to move the plants in
order to water them, which may discour-
age you from watering when you should,
but it will also provide humidity. Humid-
ity is a major requirement, especially dur-
ing winter when houses are warm and
dry.

3. A sunny window, preferably south-fac-

ing, is essential for successful indoor
vegetable growing. Fruiting vegetables
such as tomatoes and peppers may also
need supplemental light, such as a combi-
nation warm-white/cool-white florescent
fixture, during winter months. Insuffi-
cient light results in tall, spindly plants
that often fail to flower and set fruit.

XV. Preparing Perennial Vegetables

for the Winter
Late fall is the time to prepare perennial veg-
etables for winter.
A. Basic Preparations

Most will benefit from a top-dressing of ma-
nure or compost and a layer of mulch,
which reduces damage from freezing and

Chapter 19, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

19 - 17

thawing. Dead leaf stalks of perennial veg-
etables (asparagus and rhubarb) should be
cut to the ground after their tops are killed
by frost, though some people prefer to leave
asparagus stalks until late winter to hold
snow over the bed.
1. Don’t forget strawberry beds. Remove
weeds that you let grow when you were
too busy last summer. You can transplant
some of the runner plants if you carefully
dig a good-sized ball of soil with the
roots. Mulch the bed well with a light
material.

2. Raspberry plant’s expended floricanes
should be removed immediately after
harvest. Top the primocanes when dor-
mant, and thin in the spring.

B. Stakes and Trellises

When tender crops have been harvested and
overwintering crops cared for, pull up all
stakes and trellises except those stakes that
clearly mark the sites of overwintering
plants.
Clean stakes and trellises of plant and soil
remnants. Hose them down and allow to
dry. Tie stakes in bundles and stack for stor-
age over the winter. If possible, roll up wire
trellises and tie them securely. Store these
items inside your attic, barn, or shed where
they are out of the way, and where rodents
and other animals cannot use them as winter
nests.

C. Preparing Soil for Winter

Pull up all dead and unproductive plants and
place the residue on top of the soil to be
tilled under or placed into the compost heap.
1. Remove any diseased or insect-infested
plant material from the garden. This also
removes diseases and insects that may
reproduce next spring and add to your
pest problems.

2. Another option is to burn infested plant
material. Check laws in your area before
burning anything; you may need a per-
mit. If you live near a wooded area, burn-
ing may be too risky. In this case, haul
the diseased material away.

3. Cleaning up the garden also gives you the

chance to add compost to the garden.
Compost contains highly nutritious, de-

composed plant material and beneficial
organisms, and is an excellent soil-
builder.

4. Don’t overlook other sources of organic
material available during the fall. Leaves
are abundant. Put some on the garden,
store some for next year’s mulch, and
compost some. Leaves will mat if put on
in too thick a layer, and will not decom-
pose quickly. You can help leaves break
down more easily by running a lawn
mower back and forth over the pile. Add
one cup of ammonium nitrate per bushel
of leaves.

5. Sawdust and wood chips are easy to ob-
tain from sawmills, and many farms and
stables want to get rid of manure piles
before winter sets in. By adding these
materials in the fall, you give them plenty
of time to decompose and blend into the
soil before planting time. If you don’t
have enough organic material for the en-
tire garden, try to cover those areas you
want to be especially rich for next
summer’s crop.

D. Preparing the Cold Frame

Unless you are lucky enough to live in a
warm area where a cold frame will protect
vegetables all winter, you will need to clean
up the frame when all vegetables have been
harvested. Remove all remaining plant ma-
terial and spread it on the cold frame soil.
Thoroughly spade the plant refuse and any
other organic material into the soil in the
cold frame.
Do not leave the top on the cold frame over
the winter as the weight of snow may crack
or break the glass. Remove the top, wash it
thoroughly, and store it on its side in a pro-
tected indoor area.

George F. Gardner, Former Extension Educator, Bannock County, Pocatello

I. Beans, Snap

A. Food Value

A pound of raw green bean pods broken
into 1- or 2-inch lengths yields about 3 2/3
cups of cooked beans. They are composed
of 90.1 percent water, 145 calories, 8.6
grams of protein, 0.9 gram of fat, and 32.2
grams of carbohydrates.

B. Description

Snap beans grown from the immature pod
originated in Central America and were
widely distributed by the Indians, basically
as bush and pole beans. Bush beans ripen
earlier, but pole bean yields are higher.

C. Yield Per Person

It is estimated that each person will con-
sume 6 to 12 pounds of garden fresh beans
and 12 to 14 pounds of canned or frozen
beans per year. Each foot of row space
planted to beans produces an average of
0.35 to 0.5 pound of snap beans. A 20- to
30-foot row of beans produces enough
beans for one person.

D. Seedbed

Beans do best on sandy loam soil that
warms up early in the spring and has a soil
pH from 7.0 to 7.5 but can tolerate a soil pH
near 8.0. Cultivate the soil for planting
when the moisture in the soil allows the for-
mation of a soil ball that crumbles into
pieces under finger pressure. Cultivate to
mix crop residues and organic matter into

and 20 from the Virginia, Utah, Oregon, and Wash-
ington Master Gardener handbooks and adapted it to
Idaho conditions.

the top 7 to 8 inches of soil, destroy current
weed growth, and provide a granular soil
bed for seeding. Overcultivation causes the
soil to become powdery or to crust.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed beans is after the last
killing frost in the spring, when day tem-
perature is 65°F and the night is expected to
average above 55°F. Select early maturing
varieties that ripen in 55 to 70 days.

G. Planting Suggestions

Beans need a warm soil to grow and good
spacing for sunlight. Some gardeners are
tempted to soak their seeds before planting.
This practice injures many of the bean vari-
eties, and could result in poor germination
and diseased, weak plants.

H. Fertilizer

Beans are a legume and can produce some
of their own nitrogen (N) because of their N
fixation ability. The seed may be inoculated
with rhizobium to stimulate additional fixa-
tion. To supplement this, add a preplant fer-
tilizer of 0.2 pound of N for each 100 square
feet. After the first heavy bloom and set of
pods, sidedress with 1 1/2 ounces of ammo-
nium sulfate.
The amount of fertilizer applied should be
based on a soil test report from the Univer-
sity of Idaho Analytical Laboratory or a pri-
vate testing laboratory. Plants are easily
over- or under-fertilized.

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

I. Cultivation

Cultivate (shallow) when necessary to re-
move other plant competition. Deep cultiva-
tion close to the plants destroys much of the
root system and reduces yield and quality.

J. Watering

Beans have a water stress point of 60 per-
cent. When the percentage of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. To estimate water percentage,
take a handful of soil at the 6-inch depth and
squeeze it into a ball in your hand. If it
forms a ball and your hand feels like it has a
film of water on it, the soil moisture will be
60 percent or higher. If the soil moisture is
below 60 percent, you will not feel the film
of water on your hand, and it is time to wa-
ter again. Plant growth can suffer from too
much or too little water. The symptoms will
be the same. As the percentage of soil mois-
ture drops the oxygen level in the soil in-
creases.
K. Insects

Lygus bugs, nitidulid beetles, aphids includ-
ing the bean aphid, army worms and cut-
worms, grasshoppers, pea leaf weevil, corn
maggot, slug, spider mites, cucumber
beetles, and wireworms create problems in
beans.

L. Diseases

Common diseases include brown spot, curly
top, halo blight, mosaics, necrosis, root rot,
rust, sclerotinia disease, white mold, seed
rot, and seedling blight.

M. Harvesting

Beans can be harvested when pods are 3
inches long but before the seed is much
larger than the diameter of a pencil lead.
Harvest every 3 to 4 days to prevent over
maturity. Frequent picking stimulates the
plants to produce new pods and helps to en-
sure a heavy harvest. Disturbing wet vines
spreads rust and other diseases.

II. Beets

A. Food Value

protein, 0.5 gram of fat, 23.7 grams of carbo-
hydrates, and 145 calories.

B. Description

Beets are native to the Mediterranean area
of north Africa, Europe, and west Asia.
They are cool weather biennials that are
grown as annuals for their leaves and roots.
The roots may be round, flat, or elongated.
They are usually red in color, but there are
several golden varieties.

C. Yield Per Person

On the average, each person consumes 7 to
12 pounds of fresh beets during a growing
season, and an additional 12.5 to 30 pounds
of canned and frozen beets. Each foot of
row space should produce approximately
1.25 pounds of beets.

D. Seedbed

Beets grow best in sandy loam and peat
soils. Heavy clay soils can be improved by
the addition of organic matter. Seedbed
preparation should start when the soil has
sufficient moisture to form a ball that
crumbles into medium-sized fragments.
Cultivate to mix crop residues and organic
matter into the top 7 to 8 inches of soil, de-
stroy current weeds, and provide a small
granular-type bed for planting. Overculti-
vated soil becomes powdery and has a ten-
dency to crust. The ideal pH for beets is
from 6.0 to 7.5, although a pH value near
8.0 is acceptable.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed beets is 2 to 4 weeks
before the last killing frost in the spring
when soil temperature is 50°F or above. Se-
lect early maturing varieties that ripen in 55
to 65 days.

moderate. They are not harmed by spring
and fall frosts, but their roots may become
tough during hot weather. The seed of beets
is actually a dried fruit or seed ball contain-
ing several tiny true seeds. Heat, drought, or
crusting of the soil surface interferes with
seed germination and emergence. Make suc-
cessive plantings 3 weeks apart to ensure a
continuous supply of young beets.

H. Fertilizer

Preplant fertilizer is a recommended 0.2
pound of N for each 100 square feet. No
sidedressing is required. The amount of fer-
tilizer applied should be based on a soil test
report from the University of Idaho Analyti-
cal Laboratory or a private testing labora-
tory. Plants may be over- or under-fertil-
ized.

I. Cultivation

Use shallow cultivation when necessary to
remove other plant competition. Deep culti-
vation close to the plants destroys much of
the root system and reduces yield and quality.

J. Watering

Beets have a water stress point of 50 per-
cent. When the percentage of water in soil
drops below this level, the plants will start
to dehydrate, and growth will be slowed
down or stopped. To estimate the water per-
centage take a handful of soil at the 6-inch
depth and squeeze it into a ball in your
hand. If it forms a ball but feels dry, the soil
moisture will be 50 percent or higher. If the
soil moisture is below 50 percent, the ball
will be fragile and break apart with slight
pressure, and it is time to water again. Plant
growth can suffer from too much or too little
water. The symptoms will be the same. Plants
need water, oxygen, and nutrients to grow.

K. Insects

Alfalfa looper, army worm, cutworms, flea
beetles, two-spotted mite, variegated cut-
worm, zebra caterpillar, and nematodes are
common beet pests.

L. Diseases

Disease problems include boron deficiency,
curly top, damping-off, downy mildew, and
leaf spot.

M. Harvesting

Beets can be harvested as soon as the roots
are large enough to use. Early thinning is
critical for beets to develop large, tender
roots. Leave 2 inches between plants. The
tops of beets removed during thinning can
be used for “greens.” Beets are ready to be
pulled up for their roots 8 to 9 weeks after
seeds are sown. Roots are most tender when
less than 2 inches across. Harvest for stor-
age before roots become woody. Pull the
beet and cut off the tops, but leave 1 to 1 1/2
inches of top above the crown. To see if
roots are ready for use, push the soil away
from the top of the beet and check its size.

III. Broccoli

A. Food Value

A pound of broccoli stalks (head or bud
clusters, stem, and leaves) consists of 89.1
percent water, 16.3 grams of protein, 1.4
grams of fat, 26.8 grams of carbohydrates,
and 145 calories.

B. Description

Broccoli is a member of the cabbage family
with similar requirements and problems. It
was developed in southern Europe and
brought to America by immigrants. The
plant has a loose flower head on a tall,
green, branching stalk. The flower heads are
formed both terminally and laterally. The
plant may grow to 3 to 5 feet tall.

C. Yield Per Person

It is estimated that each person consumes 3
to 5 pounds of fresh broccoli during a grow-
ing season and an additional 5 to 6 pounds
of frozen broccoli each year. Each foot of
row space produces about 0.75 pound of
broccoli.
D. Seedbed

Broccoli will grow in most soils from sand
to clay. Seedbed preparation should start
when the soil has sufficient moisture to
form a ball that crumbles into medium-sized
fragments. Cultivate mix crop residues and
organic matter into the top 7 to 8 inches of
soil, destroy weed growth, and provide a
small granular-type bed for transplanting.
Overcultivated soil becomes powdery and

has a tendency to crust. The ideal pH for
broccoli is from 6.0 to 7.0, but values near
8.0 are acceptable.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed broccoli is 6 to 8
weeks before transplanting when soil tem-
perature is 50°F or above. The variety
should have an early maturity date and be
suitable for weather conditions in the area
planted. The maturity date should be 60 to
80 days after transplanting. Plant in contain-
ers inside for early crops and transplant after
last frost.

G. Planting Suggestions

Broccoli needs a cool soil to grow and good
spacing for sunlight. If transplants are pur-
chased, they should be stocky and from 4 to
6 inches tall.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended. Three
weeks after transplanting, sidedress with
1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate (south-
ern Idaho) or ammonium nitrate (northern
Idaho) per 10 feet of row. The amount of
fertilizer applied should be based on a soil
test report from the University of Idaho
Analytical Laboratory or a private testing
laboratory. Plants may be over- or under-
fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Use shallow cultivation when necessary to
remove other plant competition. Deep culti-
vation close to the plants destroys much of the
root system and reduces yield and quality.

J. Watering

Broccoli has a water stress point of 60 per-
cent. When the percentage of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percentage of water in the
soil can be estimated by taking a handful of
soil at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into

a ball in your hand. If it forms a ball and
your hand feels like it has a film of water on
it, the soil moisture will be 60 percent or
higher. If the soil moisture is below 60 per-
cent, you will not feel the film of water on
your hand, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops, the oxygen level in the soil increases.
Plants need water, oxygen, and nutrients to
grow.
K. Insects

Aphids, cabbage maggots, cabbage worm,
cabbage looper, diamond back moth, flea
beetles, spider mites, and wireworms are
common broccoli pests.

L. Diseases

Diseases include bacterial soft rot, club root,
and downy mildew.

M. Harvesting

Broccoli should be harvested when the cen-
ter head is 4 to 6 inches across, but before
the buds separate or open. Lateral buds will
develop into smaller heads after the terminal
head is removed. When a head is ready for
use, cut the stem 3 inches below the flower
buds.

IV. Brussels Sprouts

A. Food Value

A pound of Brussels sprouts consists of 85.2
percent water, 22.2 grams of protein, 1.8
grams of fat, 37.6 grams of carbohydrates,
and 204 calories.

B. Description

Brussels sprouts originated in Europe, the
principal location being Brussels, Belgium.
They resemble small cabbages but require a
longer growing season. Each plant grows to
about 2 1/2 feet tall, bearing small cabbage
like buds along its stem. Each stem may
bear as many as 100 1- to 2-inch ball-like
sprouts.

C. Yield Per Person

On the average, each person eats from 1.5 to
3.75 pounds of fresh Brussels sprouts during
a growing season and uses an additional
3.75 to 6 pounds of canned or frozen sprouts

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 5

during the year. Each foot of row space pro-
duces about 0.5 pound of Brussels sprouts.
From 3.5 to 8.5 feet of row space per person
should be planted for fresh use during the
growing season and an additional 3.5 to 14
feet for canning or freezing.

D. Seedbed

Brussels sprouts are adaptable to different
soils as long as the soils are fertile, have
good texture, and are moist. Brussels
sprouts mature less rapidly than cabbage.
Seedbed preparation should start when the
soil has sufficient moisture to form a mud
ball that you can crumble into medium-
sized fragments. Cultivation should mix
crop residues and organic matter in the top 7
to 8 inches of soil, destroy current weed
growth, and provide a small granular-type
bed for transplanting. Overcultivated soil
becomes powdery and has a tendency to
crust. The ideal pH for Brussels sprouts is
from 6.0 to 7.5; they do well in Idaho’s soil,
which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to plant Brussels sprouts seed
in containers is 4 to 6 weeks before trans-
planting in the garden, when soil tempera-
ture is 40°F or above. Seed planted in the
garden for later maturing plants should be
inserted into the soil as soon as the soil can
be cultivated, 6 to 8 weeks before the last
killing frost. The variety of Brussels sprouts
planted should have an early maturity date
and be suited for weather conditions in the
area planted. The maturity date should be 80
to 90 days after transplanting.

Brussels sprouts require good fertility and
moisture. A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound
of N for each 100 square feet is recom-
mended. When the plants are one-third
grown, sidedress with 1 1/2 ounces of am-
monium sulfate in high pH soils or ammo-
nium nitrate in low pH soils per 10 feet of

row. The amount of fertilizer applied should
be based on a soil test report from the Uni-
versity of Idaho Analytical Laboratory or a
private testing laboratory. Plants may be
over- or under-fertilized.

H. Cultivation

When necessary, cultivation should be shal-
low to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality. Hilling soil up around the
main stem of the cabbage may stimulate
early heading.

I. Watering

Brussels sprouts have a stress point of 55
percent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent of water in the soil
can be estimated by taking a handful of soil
at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a
ball in your hand. If it forms a ball and your
hand feels like it is moist but does not leave
a film of water on it, the soil moisture will
be 55 percent or above. If the soil moisture
is below 55 percent, the moisture will not be
felt on your hand, and it is time to water
again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops the oxygen level in the soil increases.
Plants need water, oxygen, and nutrients to
grow.
J. Insects

Aphids, flea beetles, cabbage looper, garden
symphylans, slugs, thrips, and cauliflower
head maggot are common pests.

K. Diseases

Brussels sprouts diseases are minimal in
Idaho but may include bacterial soft rot,
blackleg, club rot, and sprout rot.

L. Harvesting

Remove lower leaves as sprouts start to en-
large. Harvest sprouts as they become solid
at about 1 to 2 inches in diameter. The low-
est sprouts will mature first. To speed up
sprout maturity pinch off the tip of each
plant in late August or early September,

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 6

however, this may reduce the total yield of
the plant by as much as one third. Break the
sprouts from the stalk. The tastiest sprouts
will be those that mature after the first fall
frost.

M. Storage

When night temperatures drop to 20°F on a
regular basis, dig up the plants with a little
soil remaining around the roots. Put them
into a deep cold frame or in an unheated
dark garage. They will continue to grow un-
til all the sprouts mature.

V. Cabbage

A. Food Value

A pound of cabbage consists of 92.4 percent
water, 5.9 grams of protein, 0.9 gram of fat,
24.5 grams of carbohydrates, and an aver-
age of 109 calories.

B. Description

Cabbage ranks as one of the most important
homegrown crops. It may be globular, flat,
or flowery and green, red, or purple. It was
developed from wild leafy nonheading
plants native to Europe.

C. Yield Per Person

On the average each person eats 4 to 5
pounds of fresh cabbage during a growing
season, and an additional 6 to 12 pounds of
canned or frozen cabbage during the year.
Each foot of row space produces about 1.5
pounds of cabbage. Plant 5 to 6 feet of row
space per person for fresh use during the
growing season and an additional 7.5 to 15
feet for canning.

D. Seedbed

Cabbage is adaptable to different soils as
long as they are fertile, have good texture,
and are moist. Start seedbed preparation
when the soil has enough moisture to form a
mud ball that will crumble into medium-
sized fragments. Mix crop residues and or-
ganic matter into the top 7 to 8 inches of
soil, destroy current weed growth, and pro-
vide a small granular-type bed for trans-
planting. Overcultivated soil is powdery and
has a tendency to crust. The ideal pH for
cabbage growth is 6.0 to 7.5, and they do well
in Idaho soil, which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to plant cabbage seed is 5 to 7
weeks before transplanting in containers.
Large cabbage transplants may produce
seed stalks if subjected to 3 to 4 weeks of
40° to 50°F weather. To help prevent this
problem, plant out transplants when the
stem is about the size of a pencil lead when
soil temperature is 50°F or higher. Seeds
planted in the garden for later maturing
plants should be inserted into the soil as
soon as the soil can be cultivated, 6 to 8
weeks before the last killing frost. Select
cabbage varieties suited to weather condi-
tions in the area planted. Maturity dates
should be 65 to 95 days after transplanting.

When the plants are one-third grown,
sidedress with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium

trate in acid soils per 10 feet of row. The
amount of fertilizer applied should be based
on a soil test report from the University of
Idaho Analytical Laboratory or a private
testing laboratory. Plants may be over- or
under-fertilized.

H. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality. Hilling soil up around the
main stem of the cabbage may stimulate
early heading.

I. Watering

Cabbages have a water stress point of 55
percent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. To estimate water percentage,
take a handful of soil at the 6-inch depth and

squeeze it into a ball in your hand. If it
forms a ball and your hand feels like it is
damp but does not have a film of water on
it, the soil moisture will be 55 percent or
above. If the soil moisture is below 55 per-
cent, the dampness of water will not be felt
on your hand, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture drops
the oxygen level in the soil increases. Plants
need water, oxygen, and nutrients to grow.

J. Insects

Aphids, flea beetles, cabbage looper, blister
beetles, diamond back moth, wireworms,
and the imported cabbage worm are com-
mon cabbage pests.

K. Diseases

Cabbage diseases, minimal in Idaho, may
include bacterial soft rot, blackleg, club rot,
damping off and wire stem, downy mildew,
drop or watery soft rot, leaf spot, and oedema.

L. Harvesting

Cabbage is ready to harvest 50 to 65 days
after transplanting. The heads should be
solid but must be picked before they crack.
Soft heads have poor quality. Heads may
split during hot weather if there is an over
supply of water. Reducing irrigation or
twisting the mature heads part of the way
around to sever half the roots will allow ma-
ture cabbage to stay in the garden longer
without losing quality. Plants harvested
early in the summer and left with as many
leaves as possible will often develop small
heads on the stem next to the base of the
leaves. These heads are edible and should
be picked when firm.

M. Storage

Cabbage freeze at about 30°F. For storage,
place mature cabbages in a pit, trench, or
outdoor cellar. The temperature should be as
near 32°F as possible but at least 40°F or
below. Humidity should be high. Stored
cabbages will last into early winter.

VI. Cantaloupes
A. Food Value

A pound of raw cantaloupe consists of 91.2
percent water, 3.2 grams of protein, 0.5

gram of fat, 34.0 grams of carbohydrates,
and an average of 136 calories.

B. Description

Cantaloupes are native to India. The plants
have separate male and female flowers on
the same vine and are cross-pollinated. They
do not cross-pollinate with cucumbers,
gourds, watermelons, squash, or pumpkins.
Cantaloupes may develop a bitter flavor be-
cause of cloudy weather, excessively high
temperatures, or too much or too little water
during the ripening period. They need a lot
of heat and a long growing season to ma-
ture.

C. Yield Per Person

Each person eats about 8 to 10 cantaloupes
during the growing season. Each foot of row
space produces about 1 pound of canta-
loupe, and 8 to 10 feet of row will supply
one person.

D. Seedbed

Cantaloupes are adapted to most soils but
grow best in a fertile mellow soil with large
amounts of compost. Seedbed preparation
should start when the soil has sufficient
moisture to form a mud ball that will
crumble into medium-sized fragments. Mix
crop residues and organic matter into the top
7 to 8 inches of soil, destroy current weed
growth, and provide a small granular-type
bed for transplanting. Overcultivated soil
becomes powdery and has a tendency to
crust. The ideal pH for cantaloupe growth is
from 6.0 to 7.5, but the fruit does well in
Idaho soil, which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to transplant cantaloupes in
Idaho is 3 weeks after the last killing frost.
When transplanting, soil temperature should
be 65°F or above, and night temperature
should average above 55°F. Select varieties
that ripen in 75 to 85 days after transplanting.

G. Planting Suggestions

M. Harvesting

Cantaloupes need warm soil to grow and
good spacing for sunlight to ensure high
sugar content and flavor. If transplants are
used, they should be stocky. Soils should be
well drained and contain large amounts of
compost or well-rotted manure. Clear plas-
tic mulch can be used around the plants to
warm the soil.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended. One
week after blossoming begins, sidedress
with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate per
10 feet of row. The amount of fertilizer ap-
plied should be based on a soil test report
from the University of Idaho Analytical
Laboratory or a private testing laboratory.
Plants may be over- or under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivate no more than 1 inch deep to con-
trol weeds.

J. Watering

Cantaloupes have a water stress point of 60
percent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent of water in the soil
can be estimated by taking a handful of soil
at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a
ball in your hand. If it forms a ball and your
hand feels like it has a film of water on it,
the soil moisture will be 60 percent or
above. If the soil moisture is below 60 per-
cent, the film of water will not be felt on
your hand and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops the oxygen level in the soil increases.
Plants need water, oxygen, and nutrients to
grow.
K. Insects

Aphids, cucumber beetle, and squash bug
are common pests.

L. Diseases

Diseases include Fusarium wilt, leaf blight,
and powdery mildew.

Cantaloupes must ripen on the vine for
maximum quality. Ripe fruit forms an ab-
scission layer, and the stem loosens from
the fruit. When the stem is nearly loose, the
cantaloupe is said to be at the full slip stage.
Softening of the blossom end, a change in
color of the base of the pedicel from green
to waxy, and a strong cantaloupe smell are
indications of ripeness. Cantaloupe har-
vested before the full slip stage do not in-
crease in sugar after picking.

VII. Carrots

A. Food Value

Carrots are a good source of vitamins A, B,
B2, and C, sugar, and iron. A pound of car-
rots consists of 88.2 percent water, 5.0
grams of protein, 0.9 gram of fat, 44.0
grams of carbohydrates, and an average of
191 calories.
B. Description

Carrots are related to the wild flower Queen
Anne’s Lace. They have bright green feath-
ering foliage 10 to 12 inches tall and de-
velop an orange yellow root.

C. Yield Per Person

Each person eats about 5 to 10 pounds of
fresh carrots and an additional 10 to 15
pounds of canned or frozen carrots per year.
Each foot of row space should produce
about 1 pound of carrots.

D. Seedbed

Carrots grow best in sandy loam and peat
soils. Heavy clay soils can be improved by
the addition of organic matter. If you apply
manure, do so sparingly and use only well-
rotted manure to avoid rough, branching
carrots. Seedbed preparation should start
when the soil has sufficient moisture to
form a mud ball that will crumble into me-
dium-sized fragments. Cultivation should
mix crop residues and organic matter in the
top 7 to 8 inches of soil. It should destroy
current weed growth and provide a small
granular-type bed for transplanting. Over-
cultivated soil becomes powdery and has a
tendency to crust. The ideal pH for carrot
growth is from 6.0 to 7.0, but it does well in
Idaho soil, which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 9

E. Seed Time

I. Cultivation

Plant carrots after the last killing frost in the
spring when soil temperature is 40°F or
above. Their frost tolerance is moderate.
Low temperature carrots grow long and
have pointed tips. High temperature carrots
have blunt tips. For an extended harvest,
you can continue planting throughout the
summer until about 70 days before the last
expected frost. Most varieties mature in 60
to 70 days.

G. Planting Suggestions

Carrots prefer warm soil and need good
spacing for proper root development. A salt
or pepper shaker can be used to scatter
seeds in the row. For small gardens, try
growing carrots in raised beds at least 12
inches deep. A mixture of one-fifth garden
soil, two-fifths sand, and two-fifths compost
or peat moss works well. Carrot seedlings
are tiny. Some gardeners mix a few radish
seeds with the carrot seeds so they can see
the row.
To prevent the soil from forming a crust that
would inhibit the seedling’s growth, cover
the seeds with a light layer of compost,
(sifted) grass clippings, and sawdust of ver-
miculite. A film of clear plastic over the
seedbed will speed up germination by
warming the soil, prevent crusting, and keep
the soil moist. Remove the plastic as soon as
the seedlings emerge. Thin seedlings to 2
inches apart.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended. No
sidedressing is required. The amount of fer-
tilizer applied should be based on a soil test
report from the University of Idaho Analyti-
cal Laboratory or a private testing labora-
tory. Excessive N causes carrots to split into
forks in the top half.

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality.

J. Watering

Carrots have a water stress point of 55 per-
cent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plants will start
to dehydrate, and growth will be slowed
down or stopped. The percent of water in
the soil can be estimated by taking a handful
of soil at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it
into a ball in your hand. If it forms a ball,
and your hand feels damp, but does not have
a film of water on it, the soil moisture will
be 55 percent or above. If the soil moisture
is below 55 percent, the dampness will not
be felt on your hand, and it is time to water.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops, the oxygen level in the soil increases.
Plants need water, oxygen, and nutrients to
grow.
K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
aphids, carrot rust fly, garden symphylan,
wireworm, six-spotted leafhopper, and slug.

L. Diseases

Diseases include aster yellows, cottony soft
rot, damping-off, leaf spot, deaf blight, mot-
ley dwarf virus, phytophthora root rot, and
nematode soft rot.

M. Harvesting

Carrots can be harvested as soon as the
roots are the size of your little finger. Har-
vest carrots before they become woody.

N. Storage

Carrots can be stored throughout the fall and
winter in a pit, storage cellar, or covered
row. Storage temperature should be as near
32°F as possible. Humidity should be high.

VIII. Cauliflower

A. Food Value

A pound of cauliflower with head and 4 to 6
inches of stem consists of 91 percent water,

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 10

23.2 grams of protein, 1.7 grams of fat, 44.7
grams of carbohydrates, and an average of
232 calories.
B. Description

The most delicate member of the cabbage
family, cauliflower has similar requirements
and problems. It was developed in southern
Europe and is grown for its flower buds,
which are clustered together in a head or
curd. It may be difficult to grow because it
requires cool temperatures, constant mois-
ture, and frequent fertilizing. Cauliflower
does not head up well in hot weather and is
less tolerant of cold temperatures than cab-
bage. It grows about 2 feet high and has
blue green leaves.
C. Yield Per Person

It is estimated that each person eats from 3
to 5 pounds of fresh cauliflower and 8 to 12
pounds of canned or frozen cauliflower each
year. Each foot of row space produces about
1 pound of cauliflower.

D. Seedbed

Cauliflower grows in most soils from sand
to clay. Seedbed preparation should start
when the soil has sufficient moisture to
form a mud ball that will crumble into me-
dium-sized fragments. Cultivation should
mix crop residues and organic matter in the
top 7 to 8 inches of soil. It should destroy
current weed growth and provide a small,
granular bed for transplanting. Overcultivated
soil becomes powdery and has a tendency to
crust. The ideal pH for cauliflower is from
6.0 to 7.5. It is a plant that does well in
Idaho’s soil, which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed cauliflower is 6 to 8
weeks before transplanting when soil tem-
perature is 50°F or above. The variety of
cauliflower planted should have an early
maturity date and should be developed for
weather conditions in the area planted. Ma-
turity date should be 60 to 80 days after
transplanting. For transplants, start seeds
indoors 5 to 7 weeks before the last ex-
pected frost. Seed directly into the garden as
early as 4 weeks before the last expected
frost. Allow 50 to 85 days for maturity, de-
pending upon variety.

G. Planting Suggestions

Cauliflower needs cool soil and good spac-
ing. If transplants are used they should be
stocky and from 4 to 6 inches tall. Trans-
plant about the same time as the last killing
frost.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended.
When the plants are grown, sidedress with
1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate in high
pH areas or ammonium nitrate in low pH
areas per 10 feet of row. The amount of fer-
tilizer applied should be based on a soil test
report from the University of Idaho Analyti-
cal Laboratory or a private testing labora-
tory. Plants may be over- or under-fertil-
ized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality. Hill the soil up around
each plant.

J. Watering

Cauliflower has a water stress point of 60
percent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent inches of water in
the soil can be estimated by taking a handful
of soil at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it
into a ball in your hand. If it forms a ball,
and your hand feels like it has a film of wa-
ter on it, the soil moisture will be 60 percent
or above. If the soil moisture is below 60
percent, a film of water will not be felt on
your hand, and it will be time to water
again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops, the oxygen level in the soil increases.

K. Insects

Aphids, cabbage maggot, cauliflower head
maggot, diamond back moth, flea beetles,
spider mites, and wireworms are common
pests.

L. Diseases

Diseases include bacterial soft rot, club root,
downy mildew, blackleg, black rot, damp-
ing-off, wirestem drop or watery soft rot,
leaf spot, and oedema.

M. Harvesting

To prevent discolored heads, tie the plant
leaves above the head to shade it when the
head reaches golf ball size. Cut the head 4
to 6 days later. Make your decision based on
the temperature, but be sure to cut it before
the curd starts to separate. Leave 4 to 6
inches of stem with the head.

N. Storage

Cauliflower freezes at 30°F. Store in a cellar
with a temperature as near 32°F as possible.
Humidity should be moderately high. Stored
under ideal conditions, cauliflower may last
up to 6 to 8 weeks.

IX. Cucumber

A. Food Value

A pound of raw, whole cucumbers with
skins consist of 95.7 percent water, 2.7
grams of protein, 0.5 gram of fat, 14.5
grams of carbohydrates, and provide an
average of 64 calories.

B. Description

Native to Asia and Africa, cucumbers do
not cross-pollinate with muskmelons or wa-
ter melons, and the flavor of cucumbers is
not affected by the pollen from these plants.

C. Yield Per Person

It is estimated that each person eats from 2.5
to 4 pounds of cucumbers per year, requir-
ing a row of cucumbers 2 to 3 feet long.
Each foot of row space should produce about
0.8 pound of cucumbers.

D. Seedbed

Cucumbers grow in most soils, but they
grow best in a fertile soil with 5 percent or
more organic matter content. Seedbed
preparation should start when the soil has
sufficient moisture to form a mud ball that

will crumble into medium-sized fragments.
Cultivation should mix crop residues and
organic matter in the top 7 to 8 inches of
soil. It should destroy current weed growth
and provide a small granular-type bed for
transplanting. Overcultivated soil becomes
powdery and has a tendency to crust. The
ideal pH for cucumber growth is from 5.5 to
7.0, but it does well in Idaho soil, which
ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed cucumbers in Idaho is
3 weeks before transplanting when soil tem-
perature is 65°F or above and night tem-
perature is expected to average above 55°F.
The variety of cucumbers planted should
have an early maturity date and should be
developed for weather conditions in the area
planted. Maturity date should be 55 to 65
days after transplanting. Cucumbers may be
seeded directly into the soil. They are killed
by very light frosts. Cucumbers love warm
soil, and the use of plastic mulches is com-
mon.

purchased, they should be stocky.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended. One
week after blossoming begins, sidedress
with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate in
high pH soils or ammonium nitrate in low
pH soils. The amount of fertilizer applied
should be based on a soil test report from
the University of Idaho Analytical Labora-
tory or a private testing laboratory. Plants
may be over- or under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

When necessary, cultivation should be shal-
low to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-

yield and quality. If it becomes necessary to
cultivate, penetrate the soil no deeper than 1
inch.

J. Watering

Cucumbers have a water stress point of 60
percent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent of water in the soil
can be estimated by taking a handful of soil

cent, the film of water will not be felt on
your hand, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops, the oxygen level in the soil increases.
Plants need water, oxygen, and nutrients to
grow.
K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
aphids, cucumber beetle, cabbage looper,
thrips, slugs, spider mites, garden
symphylans, and wireworms.

L. Diseases

Diseases include Alternaria leaf spot, angu-
lar leaf spot, bacterial wilt, curly top mo-
saic, powdery mildew, root knot, nematode
root rot, scab, and white mold.

M. Harvesting

Cucumbers may be harvested any time after
they have reached the desired size, but be
sure to do so before the cucumbers turn yel-
low and the seeds become hard. For slicing,
the fruits should be 6 to 10 inches long.
Harvest when 2 1/2 to 6 inches in length for
pickles. Cucumbers are of the highest qual-
ity when they are dark green in color, firm,
and crisp.

X. Eggplant

A. Food Value

A pound of cooked (boiled) drained egg-
plant contains 94.3 percent water, 4.5 grams

of protein, 0.9 gram of fat, 18.6 grams of
carbohydrates, and an average of 86 calo-
ries.

B. Description

Native to India, eggplants grow from 2 to 3
feet tall. The fruit is generally large and
purple or white in color, with smooth, shiny
skin. The seeds are embedded in the flesh.

C. Yield Per Person

Each person eats about 3 to 5 pounds during
a growing season and will use 2 to 3 pounds
for canning, storage, or freezing. This will
require a row of eggplants 6 to 10 feet long.
Each foot of row space should produce
about 1 pound of fruit.

D. Seedbed

Eggplants grow in fertile, sandy loam soil.
Seedbed preparation should start when the
soil has sufficient moisture to form a mud
ball that will crumble into medium-sized
fragments. Cultivation should mix crop resi-
dues and organic matter in the top 7 to 8
inches of soil. It should destroy current
weed growth and provide a small granular-
type bed for transplanting. Overcultivated
soil becomes powdery and has a tendency to
crust. The ideal pH for eggplant growth is
from 5.5 to 6.4, but it does well in Idaho
soil, which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

Plant seeds in containers 10 weeks before
transplanting in soil with a 65°F tempera-
ture or above. The variety should have an
early maturity date and should be developed
for weather conditions in the area planted.
The maturity date should be 75 to 95 days
after transplanting.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended.
When the first fruits set, sidedress with
1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate in high
pH areas or ammonium nitrate in low pH
areas. The amount of fertilizer applied
should be based on a soil test report from
the University of Idaho Analytical Labora-
tory or a private testing laboratory. Plants
may be over-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality.

J. Watering

Eggplants have a water stress point of 65
percent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent inches of water in
the soil can be estimated by taking a handful
of soil at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it
into a ball in your hand. If it forms a ball
and your hand feels like it has a film of wa-
ter on it, the soil moisture will be 65 per-
cent, the film of water will not be felt on
your hand, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. Symptoms will be the same.
As the percentage of soil moisture drops,
the oxygen level in the soil increases. Plants
need water, oxygen, and nutrients to grow.
K. Insects—The following insects may cause
problems: aphids, Colorado potato beetle,
spider mites, western potato flea beetle, and
wireworms.

L. Diseases—Common diseases include an-

thracnose, cercospora leaf spot, root rot fun-
gus, and verticillium wilt.

M. Harvesting

Eggplant can be harvested any time after the
fruits reach egg size, but be sure to do so
before the fruit reaches full maturity and the
seeds harden. The quality of young fruit is
better than older fruit. Leave a short stem on
the fruit when harvesting. The stems are
woody, so harvest with pruning shears.

XI. Kohlrabi

A. Food Value

A pound of kohlrabi contains of 92.2 per-
cent water, 7.7 grams of protein, 0.5 gram
of fat, 24.0 grams of carbohydrates, and will
provide an average of 109 calories.

B. Description

Developed in northern Europe, kohlrabi is a
member of the cabbage family with similar
requirements and problems. The edible por-
tion is an above-ground enlargement resem-
bling a mild turnip in shape and flavor. An
excellent raw addition to relish dishes, it
also may be boiled, stuffed, or baked.

C. Yield Per Person

Each person will eat from 2 to 4 pounds of
fresh kohlrabi a season, and 4 to 8 pounds
for canning or freezing. A foot of row space
produces about 0.75 pound of kohlrabi.

D. Seedbed

Kohlrabi grows in most soils from sand to
clay. Seedbed preparation should start when
the soil has sufficient moisture to form a
mud ball that will crumble into medium-
sized fragments. Cultivation should mix
crop residues and organic matter in the top 7
to 8 inches of soil. It should destroy current
weed growth and provide a small, granular-
type bed for transplanting. Overcultivated
soil becomes powdery and has a tendency to
crust. The ideal pH for kohlrabi is from 6.0
to 7.5, and the plants do well in Idaho soil,
which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

Seed kohlrabi in container 6 weeks before
transplanting in soil with 65°F or above. The
variety should have an early maturity date
and should be developed for weather condi-
tions in the area planted. The maturity date
should be 60 to 70 days after transplanting.

chased, they should be stocky, from 4 to 6
inches tall.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended.
When the plants are one-third grown,
sidedress with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium
sulfate in high pH areas or ammonium ni-
trate in low pH areas per 10 feet of row. The
amount of fertilizer applied should be based
on a soil test report from the University of
Idaho Analytical Laboratory or a private
testing laboratory. Plants may be over- or
under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality.

J. Watering

Kohlrabi has a water stress point of 50 per-
cent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent of water in the soil
can be estimated by taking a handful of soil
at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a
ball in your hand. If it forms a ball and feels
damp, but fails to leave a film of water on
your hand, the soil moisture will be 50 per-
cent or above. If the soil moisture is below
50 percent, the film of water will not feel
damp, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. Symptoms will be the same.
As the percentage of soil moisture drops the
oxygen level in the soil increases. Plants
need water, oxygen, and nutrients to grow.

K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
aphids, flea beetles, cabbage looper, and
wireworms.
L. Harvesting

Kohlrabi is ready to harvest 50 to 60 days
after transplanting. It has the best flavor
when it is 2 to 4 inches in size, and the flesh
is still tender. The leaves of the young plant
may be used like spinach.

XII. Lettuce

A. Food Value

A pound of lettuce contains 95.1 percent
water, 5.4 grams of protein, 0.9 gram of fat,
11.3 grams of carbohydrates, and will pro-
vide an average of 64 calories.

B. Description

Lettuce is the most extensively grown and
important of all salad crops. Common let-
tuce comes in three types: head, leaf, and
butterhead. It is native to Mediterranean and
Near East. It grows best at low temperatures
and is sensitive to high temperatures.

C. Yield Per Person

Each person will eat about 4 to 5 pounds of
fresh lettuce during a growing season. Each
foot of row space should produce about 0.5
pound of lettuce. About 10 feet of row space
per person should be planted for fresh use
during the growing season.

D. Seedbed

Lettuce is adaptable to different soils as
long as they are fertile, of good texture, and
moist. The plants grow quickly. Seedbed
preparation should start when the soil has
sufficient moisture to form a mud ball that
will crumble into medium-sized fragments.
Cultivation should mix crop residues and
organic matter in the top 7 to 8 inches of
soil. It should destroy current weed growth
and provide a small, granular-type bed for
transplanting. Overcultivated soil becomes
powdery and has a tendency to crust. The
ideal pH for lettuce growth is from 6.0 to
7.0, but lettuce does well in Idaho soil,
which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed lettuce is 4 to 6 weeks
before transplanting when soil temperature
is 50°F or above. Transplant lettuce into the
garden when it is 2 to 3 inches tall and night
temperature is 25°F or above. For garden-
planted lettuce, plant as soon as the ground
can be worked and 6 to 8 weeks before the
last killing frost. To spread out the lettuce
season, make subsequent plantings every 2
weeks. Early plantings should be placed
where they get full sunlight, and later
plantings in partial shade for hot summer

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

growth. The variety should have an early
maturity date and should be developed for
weather conditions in the area planted. The
maturity date should be 55 to 80 days after
transplanting.

G. Planting Suggestions

Lettuce needs light to germinate and may
not germinate at temperatures of 80°F or
above. During hot weather, lettuce bolts,
produces seed stakes, and develops internal
tip scorching and a bitter taste.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended.
When the plants are 4 weeks old, sidedress
with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate per
10 feet of row. The amount of fertilizer ap-
plied should be based on a soil test report
from the University of Idaho Analytical
Laboratory or a private testing laboratory.
Plants may be over- or under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Lettuce must be thinned to produce good
plants. For head lettuce, thin to 12 to 15
inches between plants. For leaf lettuce, thin
to 4 to 6 inches between plants in the first
thinning and 6 to 12 inches in the final thin-
ning. Cultivation should be shallow to re-
move other plant competition. Deep cultiva-
tion close to the plants will destroy much of
the root system and reduce yield and quality.
Lettuce has a shallow, meager root system.

J. Watering

Lettuce has a shallow root system, and the
plant requires frequent watering to support
rapid leaf development. Too much water on
heavy soils may lead to leaf scorch and dis-
ease. Don’t wet the foliage any more than
necessary when watering.

K. Insects

The following insects may create problems:
aphids, flea beetles, looper, cucumber

beetles, wireworms, cutworms, army
worms, and slugs.

L. Diseases

Lettuce diseases include anthracnose, aster
yellows, big vein virus, bottom rot fungus,
downy mildew, drop or watery soft rot, mo-
saic, and red rib.

M. Harvesting

Lettuce thinnings can be used for early sal-
ads. The lettuce heads should be solid but
not overly mature when harvested. Butter-
head lettuce can be harvested as soon as the
heads form. Leaf lettuce can be harvested
any time before it sends up seed stalks.

XIII. Onions

A. Food Value

A pound of onions contains 89.4 percent
water, 7.8 grams of protein, 0.9 gram of fat,
37.2 grams of carbohydrates, and an aver-
age of 16.3 calories.

B. Description

Onions are native to North America. They
are cold hardy and adaptable to Idaho.
There are more than 300 species of onions
in the world. In Idaho, onions are grown as
green onions for table use and bulbs for
storage. The bulbs for harvest come in yel-
low, white, and red. They may be round,
flat, or long.

C. Yield Per Person

Each person will eat about 3 to 5 pounds of
onions during a growing season and another
30 to 50 pounds per person may be desired
for storage. Each foot of row space should
produce about 0.74 pound of onions. Plant
from 3 to 5 feet of row per person for use
during the growing season and an additional
30 to 50 feet for storage.

D. Seedbed

Onions grow well in a wide range of soils
and climates, but they develop best in a
loose, crumbly soil with high fertility. Seed-
bed preparation should start when the soil
has sufficient moisture to form a mud ball
that will crumble into medium-sized frag-
ments. Cultivation should mix crop residues
and organic matter in the top 7 to 8 inches
of soil. It should destroy current weed

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

growth and provide a small, granular-type
bed for transplanting. Overcultivated soil
becomes powdery and has a tendency to
crust. The ideal pH for onion growth is from
5.5 to 7.0, but onions do well in Idaho soil,
which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed onions is 6 to 8 weeks
before the last killing frost in the spring
when soil temperature is 50°F or above. The
variety of onion planted should have an
early maturity date and should be developed
for weather conditions in the area planted.
The maturity dates should be 95 to 120 days
for sets, and 95 to 120 days for plants (trans-
plant to maturity and seed, 100 to 165 days).

G. Planting Suggestions

Onion sets should be separated into two
sizes: sets smaller than 3/4-inch and 3/4- inch
and above. The large sets are used for green
onions, as they frequently form seed stalks
instead of a bulb. The smaller sets are used
for mature dry bulbs. Seeds for mature dry
bulbs should be sown indoors and trans-
planted into your garden.

H. Fertilizer

Preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet worked into the top 2
inches of soil is recommended. Fertilizers
should be applied to the soil before seeding.
Sidedress with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium
sulfate in high pH areas and ammonium ni-
trate in low pH areas per 10 feet of row. Do
so when onions are 12 inches tall or the
bulbs begin to form. The amount of fertil-
izer applied should be based on a soil test
report from the University of Idaho Analyti-
cal Laboratory or a private testing labora-
tory. Plants may be over- or under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.

Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality. Onions have a shallow
root system and cannot compete with
weeds.

J. Watering

Onions have a water stress point of 70 per-
cent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent of water in the soil
can be estimated by taking a handful of soil
at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a
ball in your hand. If it forms a hard ball and
your hand feels like it has a film of water on
it, and the soil is sticky, the soil moisture
will be 70 percent or above. If the soil mois-
ture is below 70 percent, the film of water
will not be felt on your hand, and it is time
to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops, the oxygen level in the soil increases.
Plants need water, oxygen, and nutrients to
grow.
K. Insects

The following insects may create problems:
brown wheat mite, onion thrips, onion mag-
got, pea leaf miner, and wireworms.

L. Diseases

Disease problems include basal rot, downy
mildew, neck rot, pink rot, purple blotch,
smut, and white rot.

M. Harvesting

Green bunch onions can be harvested as
soon as desired. Thinnings from bulb onions
can be used as green onions. Bulb onion
maturity is determined by softening of the
neck tissues, falling over of the tops, and
dying of the roots. At maturity bulbs enlarge
rapidly and are ready for harvest when two-
thirds of the top has fallen over or after a
light frost in Idaho’s short growing season.
If the onions are slow to mature, it may be
necessary to bend the tops over to speed up
the maturity process before heavy frosts.
Onions should then be pulled and, if the
weather permits, left in the garden until tops
and outer scales are completely dry. The

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 17

tops can be spread over the bulbs to prevent
sunburn. After the bulbs are cured they
should be topped.

N. Storage

With a freezing point of 30°F, you should
store onions as near 32°F as possible in any
cool dry (humidity, 70 percent) place. They
keep well through the fall and winter in a
cool dry cellar or attic.

XIV. Peas

A. Food Value

A pound of English peas contains 78.0 per-
cent water, 381 calories, 28.6 grams of pro-
tein, 1.8 grams of fat, and 65.3 grams of car-
bohydrates. A pound of edible podded peas
contains 84.8 percent water, 259 calories,
15.4 grams of protein, 1.4 grams of fat, and
47.2 grams of carbohydrates.

B. Description

Garden peas originated in eastern Europe
and western Asia. They are one of the earli-
est vegetables picked in the spring. Peas are
classified smooth or wrinkled according to
how the seed looks when dry. The wrinkled
seed is normally the sweetest.

C. Yield Per Person

It is recommended that 15 to 20 feet of row
space be planted per person for fresh use
during the garden season and an additional
40 to 60 feet for storage and canning. About
0.28 pound of English peas is produced per
foot of row space. Each person consumes
about 4 pounds of fresh and about 10
pounds of frozen and canned peas.

D. Seedbed

Soil types for pea production range from a
light sandy loam for early pea harvest to a
heavy clay soil for later or main harvest
crop. The ideal pH for pea production is 6.0
to 7.5. The soil should be well drained and
moderately fertile. Cultivate the soil when
the soil moisture will allow formation of a
mud ball that will crumble into pieces under
finger pressure. It should mix crop residue
and organic matter in the top 7 to 8 inches
of soil, destroy current weed growth, and
provide a granular-type bed for seeding.
Overcultivated soil becomes powdery and
has a tendency to crust.

E. Seed Time

Plant peas as soon as the ground can be
worked in the spring, about 6 to 8 weeks
before the last killing frost. Soil temperature
for planting should be 50°F or above. Peas
are a cool climate crop, and their quality is
greatly influenced by cool soil and air tem-
perature. It is suggested that planting suc-
cessions should be arranged at 10-day inter-
vals to spread harvest over a longer period
of time.

G. Planting Suggestions

Some gardeners make a double planting of
peas in each row with approximately a
6-inch space between the plantings.

H. Fertilizer

This plant is a legume and is able to draw N
from the air. Excessive N can cause the plants
to produce large vines, but fewer peas are pro-
duced. It is suggested that 0.2 pound of N be
broadcasted over a 100 square foot area. The
amount of fertilizer applied should be based
on a soil test report from the University of
Idaho Analytical Laboratory or a private soil
testing laboratory.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be conducted only when
necessary to remove other plant competi-
tion. Pea roots are easily damaged by hoe-
ing and shallow cultivation.

J. Watering

Peas have a water stress point of 50 percent.
When the percent of water in soil drops be-
low this level, the plant will start to dehy-
drate, and growth will be slowed down or
stopped. The percent of water in the soil can
be estimated by taking a handful of soil at
the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a ball
in your hand. If it forms a ball and your
hand feels moist without a film of water on
it, the soil moisture will be 50 percent or
above. If the soil moisture is below 50 per-
cent, the moist condition will not be felt on

your hand, and it will be time to water
again. Plant growth can suffer from too
much or too little water. The symptoms will
be the same.

K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
looper, cutworms, army worms, grasshop-
pers, pea aphids, pea leaf weevil, pea moth,
pea weevil, and wireworms.

L. Diseases

Diseases that may be a problem include bac-
terial blight, basal stem rot, downy mildew,
enation mosaic virus, leaf and pod blight,
root rots, seed rot, damping off, seed borne
mosaic virus, viruses, and wilt.

M. Harvesting

English peas can be harvested when pods
are nearly full but before pods begin to
wrinkle. Edible podded peas should be har-
vested while the pods are still flat and the
peas are hardly discernible. These peas need
to be picked every other day to prevent over
maturity. If they do become over mature the
pea seed inside can be eaten. Pick peas from
the vine during the cool part of the day.

N. Storage

Edible podded peas can be stored 10 days in
plastic bags in the refrigerator without a loss
of quality.

XV. Peppers

A. Food Value

A pound of immature, sweet, green, raw
peppers contain 93.4 percent water, 5.4
grams of protein, 0.9 gram of fat, 21.8
grams of carbohydrates, and provides an
average of 100 calories.

B. Description

Peppers are native to the warmer parts of
America and were cultivated more than
2,000 years ago. They are classified as
sweet, mild, or hot, and are excellent for sal-
ads, seasoning in other foods and for baking.

D. Seedbed

Peppers grow best in a sandy loam soil.
Seedbed preparation should start when the
soil has sufficient moisture to form a mud
ball that will crumble into medium-sized
fragments. Cultivation should mix crop resi-

dues and organic matter in the top 7 to 8
inches of soil. It should destroy current
weed growth and provide a small, granular-
type bed for transplanting. Overcultivated
soil becomes powdery and has a tendency to
crust. The ideal pH for pepper growth is
from 5.5 to 7.0, but the pepper does well in
Idaho soil, which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed peppers is 6 to 8
weeks before transplanting when soil tem-
perature is 65°F or above. The variety of
peppers planted should have an early matu-
rity date and should be developed for
weather conditions in the area planted. The
maturity date should be 60 to 80 days after
transplanting.

G. Planting Suggestions

Peppers need a warm soil to grow and good
spacing for sunlight. If transplants are pur-
chased, they should be stocky, from 4 to 6
inches tall.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended.
When the first fruits set, sidedress with
1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate for high
pH soils and ammonium nitrate for low pH
soils. The amount of fertilizer applied
should be based on a soil test report from
the University of Idaho Analytical Labora-
tory or a private testing laboratory. Plants
may be over- or under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality.

J. Watering

Peppers have a water stress point of 60 per-
cent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to

dehydrate and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent of water in the soil
can be estimated by taking a handful of soil
at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a
ball in your hand. If it forms a ball and your
hand feels like it has a film of water on it,
the moisture will be 60 percent or above. If
the soil moisture is below 60 percent, the
film of water will not be felt on your hand,
and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops the oxygen level in the soil increases.
Plants need water, oxygen, and nutrients to
grow.
K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
green peach aphid, garden symphylan, flea
beetles, spider mites, and wireworms.

L. Diseases

Pepper diseases include alfalfa mosaic virus,
tomato ring spot virus, anthracnose,
cercospora leaf spot, common mosaic, root
rot, and verticillium wilt.

M. Harvesting

Peppers can be harvested at any time after
they are large enough to use. Bell types usu-
ally are harvested when they are 3 to 4
inches long. When picking peppers, cut
them from the plant rather than pulling them
off. The branches are extremely brittle and
will break easily if pulled.

N. Storage

The freezing point of peppers is 30°F. Store
in unheated basement or room at 45° to
50°F. Humidity should be moderately high.
Storage may be 2 to 3 weeks.

XVI. Pumpkin
A. Food Value

A pound of pumpkin contains 90.2 percent
water, 4.5 grams of protein, 1.4 grams of
fat, 35.8 grams of protein, 35.8 grams of
carbohydrates, and an average of 150 calories.

B. Description

Pumpkins are native to America. They are
sensitive to frost but tolerant of cool moist
environments. They need a warm but not a

hot, growing season. They do not cross with
cucumbers, or watermelon, but will cross
with plants of the same species. Their flesh
is coarse but can be baked, pureed, or used
to thicken soups.
C. Yield Per Person

Each person will eat about 3 to 6 pounds of
pumpkin during a growing season and use 3
to 6 pounds for canning, freezing, or stor-
age. This will require a row of pumpkins 2
to 3 feet long for garden use and 2 to 3 feet
for storage, canning, or freezing. Each foot
of row space should produce about 1 pound
of pumpkin.

D. Seedbed

Pumpkins are adapted to most soils, but
they grow best in a fertile soil rich in hu-
mus. Seedbed preparation should start when
the soil has sufficient moisture to form a
mud ball that will crumble into medium-
sized fragments. Cultivation should mix
crop residues and organic matter in the top 7
to 8 inches of soil. It should destroy current
weed growth and provide a small, granular-
type bed for transplanting. Overcultivated
soil becomes powdery and has a tendency to
crust. The ideal pH for pumpkin growth is
from 5.5 to 7.0, but the pumpkin does well
in Idaho soil. Pumpkins grow best in full
sunlight, but they will do equally well in
light shade. For huge exhibition pumpkins,
allow one fruit to develop per vine and wa-
ter heavily.
E. Seed Time

Seed pumpkins in Idaho 3 weeks before
transplanting when soil temperature is 65°F
or above. They also may be seeded directly
into the garden soil when the soil tempera-
ture is 65°F or above. The pumpkin variety
planted should have an early maturity date
and be developed for weather conditions in
the area planted. The maturity date should
be 70 to 110 days after transplanting. Pump-
kins are killed by very light frosts. Pump-
kins love warm soil. The use of plastic
mulches is common.

G. Planting Suggestions

Pumpkins need a warm soil to grow but not

frost.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended. One
week after blossoming begins, sidedress
with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate if
the soil pH is high or ammonium nitrate if it
is low. The amount of fertilizer applied
should be based on a soil test report from
the University of Idaho Analytical Labora-
tory or a private testing laboratory. Plants
may be over- or under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality. If it becomes necessary to
cultivate, penetrate the soil no deeper than 1
inch.

J. Watering

Pumpkin roots are shallow. Their water
stress point is 60 percent. When the percent
of water in soil drops below this level, the
plant will start to dehydrate, and growth will
be slowed down or stopped. The percent of
water in the soil can be estimated by taking
a handful of soil at the 6-inch depth and
squeezing it into a ball in your hand. If it
forms a ball and your hand feels like it has a
film of water on it the soil moisture will be
60 percent or above. If soil moisture is below
60 percent, the film of water will not be felt
on your hand, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops the oxygen level in the soil increases.
Plants need water, oxygen, and nutrients to
grow.
K. Insects

The following insects may create problems:
aphids, cucumber beetle, slugs, spider mites,
and squash bugs.

L. Diseases

Disease problems include aster yellows,
root rot, and storage rot.

M. Harvesting

Pumpkins can be harvested any time after
their rinds are hard and their skins turn gold
in color. Harvest before they are injured by
hard frost. Some types have the best quality
if they are harvested after their vines are
killed by frost. When pumpkins are cut from
the vine, leave 3 or 4 inches of stem at-
tached to the fruit. Pumpkins without stems
do not store well.

N. Storage

Cure pumpkins after a light frost kills the
vines or by cutting the stems and allowing
them to lie in the garden for a week to 10
days. Pumpkins can cure inside a house for
the same period at 75°F. They may then be
stored in a home cellar or basement at an
average temperature of 55°F with a moder-
ately high humidity. High quality cured
pumpkins will store in good condition
through the fall and early winter months.

XVII. Radish

A. Food Value

A pound of radishes contains 94.5 percent
water, 4.5 grams of protein, 0.5 gram of fat,
15.3 grams of carbohydrates, and 77 calories.

B. Description

Radishes are native to Europe and Asia.
They are cold hardy but will not withstand
high heat. During hot weather the roots be-
come pungent, and the plants produce seed
stalks.

C. Yield Per Person

It is estimated that each person will eat from
2 to 3 pounds of radishes during a growing
season. Each foot of row space should pro-
duce approximately 0.67 pound of radishes.
Plant about 3 to 5 feet of row per person.

D. Seedbed

Radishes grow best in sandy loam and peat
soils. Heavy clay soils can be improved by
the addition of organic matter. Seedbed
preparation should start when the soil has
sufficient moisture to form a mud ball that
will crumble into medium-sized fragments.

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 21

Cultivation should mix crop residues and
organic matter in the top 7 to 8 inches soil.
It should destroy current weed growth and
provide a small granular-type bed for trans-
planting. Overcultivated soil becomes pow-
dery and has a tendency to crust. The ideal
pH for radish growth is from 6.0 to 7.0, but
radishes do well in Idaho soil, which ranges
from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed radishes is 6 to 8
weeks before the last killing frost in the
spring when soil temperature is 50°F or
above. The variety planted should have an
early maturity date and be developed for
weather conditions in the area planted.
Maturity date should be 20 to 50 days.

G. Planting Suggestions

Radishes need a cool soil to grow in and
good spacing for sunlight. Their frost toler-
ance is good. Make successive plantings ev-
ery 10 to 14 days, beginning in the spring as
soon as the soil can be worked and a month
before frost in the fall. Radishes can be
mixed with carrot, beet, and parsnips to
mark the row of these vegetables that grow
slower.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended. Fer-
tilizers should be applied to the soil before
seeding to ensure its availability to plants
during the short growing season. Over-fer-
tilization can result in excessive top growth
with no root enlargement. The amount of
fertilizer applied should be based on a soil
test report from the University of Idaho
Analytical Laboratory or a private testing
laboratory. Plants may be over- or under-
fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.

Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality.

J. Watering

Radishes have a water stress point of 60
percent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent of water in the soil
can be estimated by taking a handful of soil
at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a
ball in your hand. If it forms a ball and your
hand feels like it has a film of water on it,
the soil moisture will be 60 percent or
above. If the soil moisture is below 60 per-
cent, the film of water will not be felt on
your hand, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. Symptoms will be the same.
As the percentage of soil moisture drops,
the oxygen level in the soil increases. Plants
need water, oxygen, and nutrients to grow.

K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
cabbage aphid, turnip aphid, cabbage mag-
got, cutworms, army worms, black cut-
worms, diamond back moth, flea beetles,
and wireworms.

L. Diseases

Radish disease problems include black rot.

M. Harvesting

Radishes can be harvested as soon as the
roots reach edible size (1 to 2 inch) and be-
fore becoming tough and pithy. They nor-
mally mature in 20 to 30 days.

N. Storage

Storage life of radishes is limited to 5 to 6
days in the refrigerator if stored in plastic
bags with holes punched for air circulation
space. Remove tops at 1/2 inch from radish
and clean root before storage.

XVIII. Summer Squash

A. Food Value

A pound of immature raw summer squash
contains 94.0 percent water, 5 grams of pro-
tein, 0.05 gram of fat, 19.1 grams of carbo-
hydrates, and 81 calories.

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 22

B. Description

Summer squash are native to Central
American and were used extensively by In-
dians for food. Summer squash have whitish
or yellow flesh and are picked in the sum-
mer while immature. They may be vining,
semivining, or bush types. Squash will
cross-pollinate with other squash, pumpkin,
or gourds within the same species, but don’t
cross-pollinate with cucumbers or water-
melon. They grow well in Idaho.

C. Yield Per Person

It is estimated that each person will eat from
6 to 9 pounds of squash during a growing
season and need an additional 6 to 9 pounds
for storage, canning, or freezing. This will
require a row of squash 4 to 6 feet long.
Each foot of row space should produce
about 1.5 pounds of summer squash.

D. Seedbed

Summer squash grow best on fertile, well-
drained soil, well supplied with organic
matter. Seedbed preparation should start
when the soil has sufficient moisture to
form a mud ball that will crumble into me-
dium-sized fragments. Cultivation should
mix crop residues and organic matter in the
top 7 to 8 inches of soil. It should destroy
current weed growth and provide a small
granular-type bed for transplanting. Over-
cultivated soil becomes powdery and has a
tendency to crust. The ideal pH for summer
squash growth is 6.0 to 7.5, but it does well
in Idaho soil, which ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed summer squash in a
container is 3 to 4 weeks before transplant-
ing. Seed direct into soil or transplant when
temperature is 65°F or above. The variety of
squash planted should have an early matu-
rity date and be developed for weather con-
ditions in the area planted. Maturity date
should be 50 to 60 days after transplanting.
Sow squash outdoors when night tempera-
ture no longer falls below 55°F.

G. Planting Suggestions

Summer squash needs a warm soil to grow
and good spacing for sunlight. If transplants
are purchased, they should be stocky. Bees
are needed for pollination.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended.
When the plant begins to spread out,
sidedress with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium
sulfate for high pH soils and ammonium ni-
trate for low pH soils. The amount of fertil-
izer applied should be based on a soil test
report from the University of Idaho Analyti-
cal Laboratory or a private testing labora-
tory.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality.

J. Watering

Summer squashes have a water stress point
of 65 percent. When the percent of water in
soil drops below this level, the plant will
start to dehydrate, and growth will be
slowed down or stopped. The percent of wa-
ter in the soil can be estimated by taking a
handful of soil at the 6-inch depth and
squeezing it into a ball in your hand. If it
forms a ball and your hand feels like it has a
heavy film of water on it, the soil moisture
will be 65 percent or above. If the soil mois-
ture is below 65 percent, the film of water
will not be felt on your hand, and it will be
time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops, the oxygen level in the soil increases.
Plants need water, oxygen, and nutrients to
grow.
K. Insects

The following insects may create problems:
bean aphid, melon aphid, potato aphid,
nitidulid beetles, squash bug, and wireworms.

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 23

L. Diseases

Diseases include aster yellows, black rot,
curly top, and root rot.

M. Harvesting

Summer squash can be harvested any time
the fruits reach a desired size but before the
squash forms hard seed or rinds. Break fruit
from the vine, leaving a piece of stem with
the fruit.

XIX. Sweet Corn
A. Food Value

A pound of raw, white, or yellow sweet
corn consists of about 45 percent cob and 55
percent edible. The kernels contain about
72.7 percent water and provide an average
of 240 calories, 8.7 grams of protein, 2.5
grams of fat, and 55.1 grams of carbohy-
drates.

B. Description

Corn is an annual grass, native to the
Americas and differing from other types of
corn by the retention of large amounts of
sugar in the kernels during the milk stage of
maturity. Its skin is slightly thinner than
other types. Kernel color ranges from white
to yellow. There are about 2,000 sweet corn
varieties in existence.

C. Yield Per Person

It is estimated that each person will require
from 10 to 15 feet of plants in a row for
fresh use and an additional 30 to 50 feet for
storage, canning, or freezing. Each foot of
row space should produce about 0.3 pound
of corn.
D. Seedbed

Soil texture can vary for sweet corn produc-
tion. A sandy loam is best, but corn can be
grown in clay or loam soils also. The soil
cultivation should be conducted when the
moisture in the soil will allow formation of
a mud ball that will crumble into pieces un-
der finger pressure. Cultivation should mix
crop residues and organic matter in the top 7
to 8 inches of soil, destroy current weed
growth, and provide a granular-type bed for
seeding. Overcultivated soil becomes pow-
dery and has a tendency to crust. The ideal
pH for corn growth is from 6.0 to 7.0, but it

does well in Idaho soils, which have a pH of
7.0 to 8.0.
E. Seed Time

The best time to seed corn is in May when
soil temperature is 50°F or above and air
temperature averages 65°F or above. Corn is
a tender crop and should be planted after the
last frost. The warmer the temperature, the
faster the corn grows and matures. The vari-
ety planted should have an early maturity
date and be developed for weather condi-
tions in the area planted.

G. Planting Suggestions

Sweet corn needs a warm soil and good
spacing for sunlight. It is wind-pollinated so
plants should be in 3 or more short rows,
rather than one long row. Varieties should
be separated because cross-pollination be-
tween low-sugar plants and high-sugar
plants reduces the sweetness of the high-
sugar corn.

H. Fertilizer

Corn has a high N requirement. The princi-
pal application of N and other fertilizers
should be broadcast before planting with, if
necessary, a sidedressing 3 inches from the
plant at the corn four-leaf stage. The amount
of fertilizer applied should be based on a
soil test report from the University of Idaho
Analytical Laboratory or a private soil test-
ing laboratory. Plants stunted by a lack of
nutrients seldom recover or produce up to
their potential.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation will destroy much of the
root system and reduce yield and quality.
The number of suckers a sweet corn plant
produces depends on the variety of the corn.
Suckers should not be removed. Their re-
moval does not increase yields but may re-
duce them.

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

J. Watering

B. Description

Corn has a water stress point of 60 percent.
When the percent of water in soil drops be-
low this level, the plant will start to dehy-
drate and growth will be slowed down or
stopped. The percent of water in the soil can
be estimated by taking a handful of soil at
the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a ball
in your hand. If it forms a ball and your
hand feels like it has a film of water on it,
the soil moisture will be 60 percent or
above. If the soil moisture is below 60 per-
cent, the film of water will not be felt on
your hand, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or too
little water. Symptoms will be the same.

K. Insects

The following insects may be a problem in
sweet corn: corn ear worm, cutworm, army
worm, wireworm, root worm, slug, aphids,
spider mites, earwigs, and cucumber beetles.

L. Diseases

Root stock, ear rot, maize dwarf mosaic,
seed rot, seedling blight, and smut are com-
mon diseases of corn.

M. Harvesting

Depending on temperatures, sweet corn
generally ripens in 22 to 24 days after
silking. For eating, the silks are brown, and
the ear fills the husk. The liquid squeezed
from a ripe kernel is milky; from an imma-
ture kernel it is watery; and from an
overmature kernel, solid or creamy. Prime
eating quality lasts about 4 to 5 days before
the sugar starts to turn to starch. Pick corn
when the sugar is at its maximum. Canning
corn can be picked when it is in the cream
stage. Sweet corn loses quality quickly after
picking, especially at high temperatures.
Process as soon as possible after harvesting.
Pull cobs from the stocks with a downward
motion and a twist to the side.

N. Storage

Refrigerate at 35° to 40°F for 2 to 3 days.

XX. Swiss Chard
A. Food Value

Chard is native of the Mediterranean area. It
is a relative of the beet and is grown for its
tender vitamin rich leaves. The leaves and
petioles are cooked to provide a pot herb
similar to spinach.

C. Yield Per Person

It is estimated that each person will eat from
1.5 to 3 pounds of fresh chard during a
growing season and will use an additional 3
to 4.5 pounds for canning or freezing. Each
foot of row space should produce about 0.85
pound of chard. From 2 to 4 feet of row
space per person should be planted for fresh
use during the growing season and an addi-
tional 4 to 6 feet for canning or freezing.

D. Seedbed

Chard is widely adapted to different soils as
long as they are rich, of good texture, and
well drained. Seedbed preparation should
start when the soil has sufficient moisture to
form a mud ball that will crumble into me-
dium-sized fragments. Cultivation should
mix crop residues and organic matter in the
top 7 to 8 inches of soil, destroy current
weed growth, and provide a small granular-
type bed for transplanting. Overcultivated
soil becomes powdery and has a tendency to
crust. The ideal pH for chard growth is from
6.0 to 7.5, and it does well in Idaho soil,
which is 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed chard is as soon as the
soil can be cultivated in the spring, 2 to 4
weeks before the last killing frost. Minimum
soil temperature for planting is 50°F or
above. The variety of chard planted should
have an early maturity date and be devel-
oped for weather conditions in the area
planted. Maturity date should be 55 to 65
days after planting.

H. Fertilizer

N. Storage

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended.
When the plants are one-third grown,
sidedress with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium
sulfate per 10 feet of row. Amount of fertil-
izer applied should be based on a soil test
report from the University of Idaho Analyti-
cal Laboratory or a private testing labora-
tory. Plants may be over- or under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality.

J. Watering

Chard has a water stress point of 55 percent.
When the percent of water in soil drops be-
low this level, the plant will start to dehy-
drate, and growth will be slowed down or
stopped. The percent of water in the soil can
be estimated by taking a handful of soil at
the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a ball
in your hand. If it forms a ball, and your
hand feels like it has a film of water on it,
the soil moisture will be 55 percent or
above. If the soil moisture is below 55 per-
cent, the soil will not feel moist on your
hand, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. Symptoms will be the same.
As the percentage of soil moisture drops,
the oxygen level in the soil increases. Plants
need water, oxygen, and nutrients to grow.

K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
aphids, blister beetles, looper, lygus bugs,
cutworms, serpentine leaf miner, western
spotted cucumber beetles, and wireworms.

L. Diseases

Top virus is the main chard disease.

M. Harvesting

Chard can be harvested throughout an entire
3-month growing season. Plants removed at
thinning time can be used in salads. Cut
outer leaves first about 1 inch from the soil
surface with a sharp knife. Care should be
taken to ensure the new inner stems and
growing point are not damaged.

Before the first hard freeze, plants can be
transplanted into containers. Store the con-
tainerized plants in a cool place, and water
lightly to prevent wilting. Leaves can be
harvested into the winter months.

XXI. Tomatoes
A. Food Value

A pound of tomatoes contains about 93.5
percent water, 4.5 grams of protein, 0.8
gram of fat, and 19.4 grams of carbohy-
drates. The fruits are high in vitamin A, B1,
B2, and C, and provide an average of 91
calories per pound.

B. Description

Tomatoes are native to the Andes Moun-
tains in South America. They are a warm
season crop and rank second in popularity
among the vegetable crops grown in the
United States. They are classified according
to their growth patterns into three groups:
Determinant, semideterminant, and
indeterminant. Determinant plant vines
grow 12 to 18 inches long, and stop fruiting
when the vines stop growing. Semideter-
minant plants are similar but grow 18 to 24
inches. The vines of indeterminant plants
continue to grow and fruit is set indefinitely.

C. Yield Per Person

Tomatoes grow best in a fertile, sandy, well-
drained, loam soil. Seedbed preparation
should start when the soil has sufficient
moisture to form a mud ball that will
crumble into medium-sized fragments. Cul-
tivation should mix crop residues and or-
ganic matter in the top 7 to 8 inches of soil.
It should destroy current weed growth and
provide a small granular-type bed for trans-
planting. Overcultivated soil becomes pow-
dery and has a tendency to crust. The pH for
tomato growth is from 5.5 to 7.5, but it does
well in Idaho soil, which ranges from 7.0 to
8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed tomatoes is 6 to 8
weeks before transplanting when soil tem-
perature is 65°F or above. The variety of
tomatoes planted should have an early ma-
turity date and be developed for weather

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 26

conditions in the area planted. Maturity date
should be 60 to 80 days after transplanting.
Two or three different varieties can be
planted to obtain ripening at different times.
One series of plants could be early bearers
and another series that mature later could be
used for the main crop.

G. Planting Suggestions

Tomatoes need a warm soil to grow and
good spacing for sunlight. If transplants are
purchased, they should be stocky and from
4 to 6 inches tall. If you plan to grow your
own transplants, seed in your greenhouse or
house 5 to 7 weeks before transplanting. Put
plants in the garden 10 days after the last
expected killing frost. Hot caps or other pro-
tection devices may allow earlier transplant-
ing. Tomatoes normally do not set fruit be-
low 58°F or above 85°F and must have 6 or
more hours each day of direct sunlight.
Transplants should not have fruit on them
when planted out as the fruit will stunt the
plants’ growth and development.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended.
When the first fruits set, sidedress with
1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate for high
pH soils and ammonium nitrate for low pH
soils. The amount of fertilizer applied
should be based on a soil test report from
the University of Idaho Analytical Labora-
tory or a private testing laboratory. Plants
may be over- or under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality.

J. Watering

Tomatoes have a water stress point of 65
percent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to

dehydrate and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent of water in the soil
can be estimated by taking a handful of soil
at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a
ball in your hand. If it forms a ball and your
hand feels like it has a film of water on it,
the soil moisture will be 65 percent or
above. If the soil moisture is below 65 per-
cent, the film of water will not be felt on
your hand, and it will be time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. Symptoms will be the same.
As the percentage of soil moisture drops,
the oxygen level in the soil increases. Plants
need water, oxygen, and nutrients to grow.

K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
green peach aphid, garden symphylan, flea
beetles, spider mites, wireworms, and to-
mato horn worm.

L. Diseases

Tomato diseases include anthracnose, yel-
low aster, bacterial canker, blossom end rot,
curly top, early blight, fruit rot, late blight,
leaf mold mosaic, root-rot nematode, spot-
ted wilt virus (tip blight), streak, and wilt.

M. Harvesting

For best flavor tomato fruits should be har-
vested when they are fully ripe and firm.
The best ripening temperature is 65°F. To-
matoes will ripen to high quality indoors if
picked as the red color first shows. Remove
stems from harvested tomatoes.

N. Storage

The freezing point of tomatoes is 30°F.
Store in unheated basement or room tem-
perature of from 55° to 70°F. Humidity
should be moderately low. Tomatoes may
be stored for 4 to 6 weeks. For fall storage,
pick all green fruit that is nearly full size
and wrap individually in newspaper and
store at 50° to 60°F. They will ripen slowly
providing a longer eating season. Green
fruit will ripen more quickly when enclosed
in a bag or box with an apple or banana.

XXII. Turnips

A. Food Value

A pound of turnips contains about 93.6 per-
cent water, 3.6 grams of protein, 0.9 gram

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 27

of fat, 22.2 grams of carbohydrates, and 104
calories.

B. Description

Turnips are native to western Asia. They are
cold hardy but will not withstand heat, and
during hot weather roots become bitter and
pithy. Turnips are grown for their tender,
crisp roots, but the leaves or greens of tur-
nips are also good cooked.

C. Yield Per Person

It is estimated that each person will eat from
3 to 6 pounds of turnips during a growing
season. Each foot of row space should pro-
duce approximately 0.5 to 1 pound of turnips.
Plant from 5 to 10 feet of row per person.

D. Seedbed

Turnips grow best in sandy loam and peat
soils. Heavy clay soils can be improved by
the addition of organic matter. Seedbed
preparation should start when the soil has
sufficient moisture to form a mud ball that
will crumble into medium-sized fragments.
Cultivation should mix crop residues and
organic matter in the top 7 to 8 inches of
soil. It should destroy current weed growth
and provide a small granular-type bed for
transplanting. Overcultivated soil becomes
powdery and has a tendency to crust. The
ideal pH for turnip growth is 5.5 to 7.0, but
it does well in Idaho soil, which ranges from
7.0 to 8.0.
E. Seed Time

The best time to seed turnips is 6 to 8 weeks
before the last killing frost in the spring
when soil temperature is 50°F or above. The
variety planted should have an early matu-
rity date and be developed for weather con-
ditions in the area planted. Maturity date
should be 45 to 60 days.

G. Planting Suggestions

Turnips need a cool soil to grow in. They
have excellent frost tolerance. It is sug-

gested that successive plantings be made
every 10 to 14 days beginning in spring as
soon as the soil can be worked and before the
daytime temperature is expected to average
80°F or above. Turnips can be mixed with
seed for carrots, beets, and parsnips to mark
the row of these vegetables that grow slower.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended.
Sidedress the plants with 1.5 ounces of am-
monium sulfate for high pH soils or ammo-
nium nitrate for low pH soils per 10 feet of
row when plants are about one-third grown.
Over fertilization can result in excessive top
growth with no root enlargement. The
amount of fertilizer applied should be based
on a soil test report from the University of
Idaho Analytical Laboratory or a private
testing laboratory. Plants may be over- or
under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality. Thin by leaving 1 to 2
inches between plants. Plants removed dur-
ing thinning can be eaten.

J. Watering

Turnips have a water stress point of 60 per-
cent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent of water in the soil
can be estimated by taking a handful of soil
at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a
ball in your hand. If it forms a ball, and your
hand feels like it has a film of water on it,
the soil moisture will be 60 percent or
above. If the soil moisture is below 60 per-
cent, the film of water will not be felt on
your hand, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much or
too little water. The symptoms will be the
same. As the percentage of soil moisture
drops, the oxygen level in the soil increases.

K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
cabbage aphid, turnip aphid, cabbage root

Chapter 20, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

20 - 28

maggot, cutworms, army worms, black cut-
worms, diamond back moth, flea beetles,
and wireworms.

L. Diseases

Turnip disease problems include black root
rot, club root, and powdery mildew.

M. Harvesting

Turnips can be harvested as soon as the
roots reach edible size (2 to 3 inches) and
before becoming bitter and pithy. They nor-
mally mature in 45 to 60 days. Pull or cut
off tops above the crown.

N. Storage

Storage life of turnips can be extended into
the fall and winter by leaving them in the
ground and covering them with a mulch to
prevent them from freezing in the ground.
For pit storage the temperature should be as
near 32°F as possible under moist air condi-
tions.

XXIII. Watermelon

A. Food Value

A pound of raw watermelon contains 92.6
percent water, 2.3 grams of protein, 0.9
gram of fat, 29.0 grams of carbohydrates,
and 118 calories.

B. Description

Watermelons are a native of Africa. The
plants have separate male and female flow-
ers on the same vine and are cross-polli-
nated. They do not cross-pollinate with cu-
cumbers, squash, or pumpkins. Watermelon
are difficult to grow in many parts of Idaho.
They need high temperatures and a long
growing season.
C. Yield Per Person

It is estimated that each person will eat from
3 to 6 pounds of watermelon during a grow-
ing season. This will require a row of mel-
ons 6 to 12 feet long. Each foot of row
space should produce about 0.5 pound of
watermelons.

D. Seedbed

Watermelons are adapted to most soils but
grow best in a fertile, light, sandy soil with
large amounts of compost. Seedbed prepara-
tion should start when the soil has sufficient
moisture to form a mud ball that will

crumble into medium-sized fragments. Cul-
tivation should mix crop residues and or-
ganic matter in the top 7 to 8 inches of soil.
It should destroy current weed growth and
provide a small, granular-type bed for trans-
planting. Overcultivated soil becomes pow-
dery and has a tendency to crust. The ideal
pH for watermelon growth is from 6.0 to
7.5, but it does well in Idaho soil, which
ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The best time to seed watermelons in Idaho
is 3 weeks after the last killing frost. When
transplanting, the soil temperature should be
65°F or above. The variety of watermelons
planted should have an early maturity date
and be developed for weather conditions in
the area planted. The maturity date should
be 80 to 100 days after transplanting.

G. Planting Suggestions

Watermelons need a warm soil to grow and
good spacing for sunlight for high sugar
content and flavor. If transplants are pur-
chased, they should be stocky.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended. One
week after blossoming begins, sidedress
with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate for
pH soils or ammonium nitrate for low pH
soils per 10 feet of row. The amount of fer-
tilizer applied should be based on a soil test
report from the University of Idaho Analyti-
cal Laboratory or a private testing labora-
tory. Plants may be over- or under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality. If it becomes necessary to
cultivate, penetrate the soil no deeper than 1
inch.

K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
aphids, cucumber beetle, cabbage looper,
spider mites, and wireworms.

L. Diseases

Diseases include curly top, leaf spot, and wilt.

M. Harvesting

Watermelon is ripe when the vine tendril
next to the fruit yellows and dries, when the
underside of the melon next to the ground
takes on a yellow tinge, and when thumping
with a finger causes a dull rather than a
sharp sound. Cut the melon off the vine,
leaving a short stem on the fruit. Pulling the
stem from the fruit may damage the fruit.
Most melon cultivates form an abscission
layer at maturity, and the stem loosens from
the fruit. When the stem is nearly loose the
melon is said to be at the full slip stage.

XXIV. Winter Squash

A. Food Value

A pound of cooked winter squash contains
about 81.4 percent water, 8.2 grams of pro-
tein, 1.8 grams of fat, 69.9 grams of carbo-
hydrates, and 286 calories.

B. Description

Winter squash is native to America and was
grown by the Indians. There are three main

types: vining, semivining, and bush. Squash
will cross-pollinate with other squash,
pumpkins, and gourds within the same spe-
cies. They have separate male and female
flowers on the same plant. The fruits, which
vary widely in shape and color, may be
baked, boiled, or used for pie filling.

C. Yield Per Person

Each person will eat about 6 to 9 pounds of
squash during a growing season and need 6
to 9 pounds for canning or freezing. This
will require a row of squash 12 to 18 feet
long. Each foot of row space produces about
1 pound of squash.

D. Seedbed

Squash is adapted to most soils but grows
best in a fertile soil rich in humus. Seedbed
preparation should start when the soil has
sufficient moisture to form a mud ball that
will crumble into medium-sized fragments.
Cultivation should mix crop residues and
organic matter in the top 7 to 8 inches of
soil. It should destroy current weed growth
and provide a small, granular type bed for
transplanting. Overcultivated soil becomes
powdery and has a tendency to crust. The
ideal pH for squash growth is 6.0 to 7.5.
Squash does well in Idaho soil, which
ranges from 7.0 to 8.0.

E. Seed Time

The time to seed squash in Idaho is 3 weeks
before transplanting when soil temperature
is 65°F. The variety of squash planted should
have an early maturity date and be developed
for weather conditions in the area planted.
Maturity date should be 85 to 120 days after
transplanting. Squash may also be seeded
directly into the soil 2 to 3 weeks after the
last killing frost. Squash thrives in warm soil,
and the use of plastic mulches is common.

Squash tolerates partial shade and is some-
times interplanted with corn.

H. Fertilizer

A preplant fertilizer of 0.2 pound of N for
each 100 square feet is recommended. One
week after blossoming begins, sidedress
with 1 1/2 ounces of ammonium sulfate for
high pH soils or ammonium nitrate for low
pH soils. The amount of fertilizer applied
should be based on a soil test report from
the University of Idaho Analytical Labora-
tory or a private testing laboratory. Plants
may be over- or under-fertilized.

I. Cultivation

Cultivation should be shallow, when neces-
sary, to remove other plant competition.
Deep cultivation close to the plants will de-
stroy much of the root system and reduce
yield and quality. If it becomes necessary to
cultivate, penetrate the soil no deeper than
1 inch. Squash plants provide good ground
cover and will shade out most weeds as they
mature.

J. Watering

Winter squash has a water stress point of 60
percent. When the percent of water in soil
drops below this level, the plant will start to
dehydrate, and growth will be slowed down
or stopped. The percent of water in the soil
can be estimated by taking a handful of soil
at the 6-inch depth and squeezing it into a
ball in your hand. If it forms a ball and your
hand feels like it has a film of water on it,
the soil moisture will be 60 percent or
above. If the soil moisture is below 60 per-
cent, the film of water will not be felt on
your hand, and it is time to water again.
Plant growth can suffer from too much to
little water. The symptoms will be the same.
As the percentage of soil moisture drops,
the oxygen level in the soil increases. Plants
need water, oxygen, and nutrients to grow.

K. Insects

The following insects may cause problems:
aphids, cucumber beetle, slugs, spider mites,
wireworms, and squash bugs.

L. Diseases

Squash diseases include aster yellows, black
rot, curly top virus, root rot, and storage
rots.

M. Harvesting

Harvest winter squash when fully mature.
Indications of maturity are a hard rind and a
solid exterior coloring. The acorn types are
harvested when a yellow, orange color has
developed on the fruit where it is in contact
with the soil. In Idaho, the growing season
is short at best, and most winter squash are
harvested when the vine has been killed by
frost but before a hard frost. To harvest, cut
the stem with a knife 2 inches from the fruit.
Let the squash cure in the sun for 1 or more
weeks or cure inside house at a temperature
of 75°F for 1 week or more before storage.

N. Storage

When cured, store in a home cellar or base-
ment at 55°F. The humidity should be mod-
erately low. Properly cured and stored
squash should remain in good condition
throughout the winter.

I. Introduction

Table 1. Usual order of bloom in fruit trees.

Growing fruit can be an important part of
home gardening, but it demands a year-round
and year-to-year commitment by the gardener.
In addition to the personal satisfaction and en-
joyment of tree ripened fruits, fruit trees have
considerable landscape value. Properly cared
for, they are attractive in form and display
beautiful flowers in the spring. If judiciously
placed, they can enhance a well-designed land-
scape.

II. Site Selection

An ideal location for fruit trees:
A. Is Without Frost Pockets—A gentle slope

with good air drainage will work well. Plant
the trees three-quarters of the way down the
hill. Cold air will drain down the hill and
will help limit frost damage in the spring
(Fig. 1). Frost damage can occur any time
from bloom to late spring.
Frost damage to blossoms is a likely prob-
lem, particularyly with early blooming fruit
trees (Table 1). For example, apricots may

Fig. 1. Frost damage is best prevented by proper site
selection. Choose a gentle slope with good air
drainage.

produce a crop only once every 5 years be-
cause of early spring frosts. Small fruit may
fall off soon after a killing frost. Stone fruit,
such as peaches, may stay on the tree until
mid to late June, and then drop. Diagnose
for frost damage by cutting open the small
fruit. If the ovules (the portion that becomes
the seed) are brown, the fruit is dead.

B. Is in Full Sun—Fruit trees should be planted
well away from areas of shade such as large
trees and buildings. Not only must the tree
itself receive full sun, but it must also be
properly pruned so that light can penetrate
to the inner leaves. This is necessary in or-
der to maintain good flower production and
fruit set throughout the tree.

C. Has Well-Drained But Not Droughty Soil—
A site with deep, fertile, sandy loam soil in-
creases the probability of successful tree
growth and fruit production. A site with
poor drainage increases the probability of
winter injury to fruit trees. A drainage prob-
lem, such as a perched water table, can be
lessened by breaking through the hard pan
layer in the soil. Stone fruits, particularly
peaches, do not tolerate  “wet feet.”

III. Fruit and Nut Cultivars for Idaho

Once the decision is made to start a home or-
chard, a lot of thought must go into cultivar
selection. Cultivars must be adapted to the cli-
mate and soils of your specific area, must pro-
vide fruit at the desired time, and must be
suited to uses such as freezing, canning, and
preserving. Select cultivars that will extend the
harvest season from July through October.
Since some cultivars are easier to grow than
others, choose only the ones you, your family,
and friends really appreciate so your horticul-
tural efforts will be justified. In addition to lo-
cal expertise, “Western Fruit Berries & Nuts—
How to Select, Grow, and Enjoy,” is a good
reference. Some cultivars can be ordered if you
give your local nursery enough notice.

Note: Fruit and nut trees are propagated ei-
ther by grafting or budding to obtain
true-to-name trees. A seedling fruit
tree cannot produce the same kind or
quality fruit as its parent and it comes
into production much later.

IV. Types of Tree Fruits

The complexity of tree fruits can be simplified
for study by grouping tree fruits into two cat-
egories: pome fruits and stone fruits. Both
pome fruits—apples (Malus) and pears
(Pyrus)—share many cultural similarities and
pest problems. The stone fruits (Prunus)—apri-
cots, cherries, nectarines, peaches, and
plums—share cultural similarities.
A. Pome Fruits (Apples and Pears)

1. Apple trees are among the most cold tol-
erant fruit trees, but climate adaptability
varies according to cultivar. In colder
areas of Idaho, it is best to plant mid-sea-
son cultivars that will escape spring frosts
and ripen before extreme cold in the fall.
The best vegetative growth and optimal
fruit production are obtained in well-
drained, deep soil(cid:0).
Many apple cultivars require a second
cultivar for cross-pollination by bees to
ensure adequate crops. Crab apples can
also cross-pollinate apple cultivars.
Bloom times of the cultivars need to
overlap to ensure pollination.

Choose cultivars to grow at home that are
not readily available in your local grocery
store, that you especially enjoy, and that
are best for your purpose.
Less commonly grown cultivar sugges-
tions are:
a. King: Large, waxy yellow with red
striping. Crisp and sweet. Good for
eating and baking.

b. Northern Spy: Large, red apple with
tender, fine-grained flesh. One of the
finest for flavor. Stores well. The tree
is slow to reach bearing age, and tends
to bear alternate years.

c. Spitzenberg: Medium, red with yellow

dots. Crisp, fine-grained flesh with a
tangy, spicy flavor.

d. Wealthy: Red-tinted white flesh and a
deserved reputation for quality. Good
cooking apple; satisfactory for fresh
use. It is a particularly good tree for
colder areas. Tends to bear alternate
years. Good pollinizer for other apples.

e. Winesap: Large, round, and with a

lively flavor, these apples make good
desserts. An old-timer that remains a
favorite. The trees are vigorous, and
are early, reliable bearers.

2. Pears will tolerate poor drainage and ne-
glect better than other fruit trees. For best
vegetative growth and optimal fruit pro-
duction, pears should be planted in a
well-drained, deep soil and spaced about
16 to 18 feet apart.
The major problem with pears is fire
blight, which primarily attacks young,
vigorous wood. Treatment is to cut out
and destroy the blackened diseased wood.
Train and prune trees only to shape them,
limiting cuts to smaller branches as much
as possible. Excessive pruning can stimu-
late vigorous, susceptible growth. Heavy
rain during bloom as well as hail-inflicted
wounds will increase the chances of fire
blight infections. To lessen the incidence
of the disease, application of copper can
be made during the delayed dormant
stage. This will reduce the bacterial in-
oculum levels on the surface of the tree.

Chapter 21, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

21 - 3

Avoid the use of nitrogen fertilizer unless
trees show obvious signs of a deficiency.
Excess nitrogen application promotes
vigorous growth that will then be vulner-
able to fire blight.
Cultivar suggestions include:
a. Bartlett: A standard commercial vari-

ety, matures toward the end of summer
and has excellent fresh eating as well
as canning quality.

b. Bosc: A fine-flavored dessert variety

ripening after Bartlett.

c. Clapps Favorite: Matures before

Bartlett and is the earliest pear of good
quality.

d. Seckel: A small gourmet pear with a

russet skin; a pickling as well as a des-
sert pear.

B. Stone Fruits

1. Apricots—Flower very early in spring;
consequently, the occurrence of spring
frost will affect fruit production. It may
help to plant apricots on a northern expo-
sure (but not in shade) to delay bloom,
but a safer course of action is to choose
later-blooming cultivars. Bloom and ma-
turity dates vary, depending on area, cul-
tural practices, tree age, and season.

2. Cherries—Do best in deep, well-drained
soil. Space sweet cherries about 30 feet
apart. The trees may not fill that much
space, but the cherry fruits need sunlight
to ripen.
Most sweet cherry cultivars need an aid
in pollinating in order to produce fruit, so
choose the second tree carefully.
Black Tartarian, Corum, Republican,
Sam, and Van will pollinate any other
cherry tree. Stella, Compact Stella, and
Garden Bing are self-fertilizing and re-
quire no second tree for pollination. Bing,
Lambert, and Royal Ann will not produce
fruit in any combination.
The most dependable cherries for colder
areas of Idaho are the sour type that are
self-fertilizing. Montmorency is the most
popular cultivar for the home garden as
well as being a leader in commercial sour
cherry production. Sour cherry trees may
be planted 20 feet apart.

3. Peaches and nectarines—Differ in their

tolerance of cold or mild winters. Be sure
to select cultivars that are adapted to your
climate.
Generally, there is a risk of damage
where winter temperatures fall below
-10° to -15°F. Trees planted on a hillside
where the coldest air drains to low-lying
areas or trees planted near large bodies of
water may tolerate areas otherwise too
cold for them.
Reliance and Polly (Haven Polly) are
considered some of the hardiest peach
cultivars. Nectarines are more tender than
peaches.
Peaches and nectarines are generally self-
fruitful, or self-pollinating.

4. Plums and prunes—The most popular
cultivars are derived from either Euro-
pean or Japanese species. These cultivars
can grow 15 to 20 feet high and about as
wide. European varieties bloom late and
are better adapted to areas with late frost
or cool, rainy spring weather than are the
early-blooming Japanese varieties. Many
plum and prune cultivars need another
cultivar growing nearby for pollination.
The European-type plum, called the Ital-
ian prune, is a high yielder, requires no
thinning, hangs on the tree, and ripens to
a taste treat that more than justifies its
place in the home garden.

C. Nuts

1. Filberts or hazelnuts—These make an at-
tractive, small tree for the garden. Spring
to fall, the roundish, ruffled-edged leaves
cast a pleasant spot of shade. Showy male
catkins hang long and full on bare
branches in winter. Female flowers are
small and red in color. A crop of round or
oblong nuts comes as a bonus in the fall.
Plant trees in early spring in well-
drained, soil and plant at least two com-
patible cultivars for cross-pollination.
Filberts tend to sucker. If you wish to
maintain a single trunk, remove these
shoots three to four times a year. Filberts
can also be grown as a bush.

2. The Persian (English) walnut—Should

not be planted as a landscape tree except

Chapter 21, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

21 - 4

on a large lot with deep soil. Established
trees take some drought, but deep, regular
watering is required. Older trees need
pruning only to remove dead wood. Plant
walnut trees 40 to 60 feet apart. Walnut
flowers are susceptible to spring frosts.
3. Almonds—Will survive in southwestern

Idaho, but don’t produce annual crops
because they bloom early in the spring
and are usually killed by frost.

V. Rootstock

Fruit trees consist of two parts: a scion and a
rootstock. The scion, or fruiting cultivar, is the
most above-ground part of the tree. It is
grafted or budded onto a rootstock to form a
new tree (Fig. 2). This tree is the same cultivar
as the scion and will produce fruit of that culti-
var. A wide range of rootstock, varying in size
as well as other attributes, are available for
apples. However, rootstock selections for other
tree fruit are more limited.
Dwarfing rootstock is preferred since it pro-
duces a more compact fruit tree. It bears fruit
earlier in its life, is easier to prune and spray,
and is easier to harvest.
A. Apples

Apple tree growth may be manipulated to
three basic sizes: standard, semi-dwarf, and
dwarf.

Fig. 2. Parts of a fruit tree.

1. The standard (seedling) rootstock is

adaptable to most conditions. It has an
extensive root system and should be
planted about 20 feet apart.

2. The semidwarf rootstock (MM-111,

MM-106, and EM-7) make a tree one-
half to two-thirds the size of a standard
tree.

3. The dwarf rootstock (M-26 and EM-9)

make a tree one-third to one-half the size
of a standard tree. The more dwarfing the
apple rootstock, the more support the tree
will require. When the tree is bearing a
crop, dwarfing rootstock (M-9 and M-26)
will need a stake to hold the tree up in the
wind. In general, the more dwarfing the
rootstock, the faster the tree will bear. It
is important to allow sufficient vegetative
growth to fill the space before allowing
the crop to slow vegetative growth.

B. Pears

Pear cultivars are available on semidwarf or
seedling rootstock. The seedling rootstock
are hardier than other rootstock, making
larger but more manageable trees.

C. Stone Fruits

Nectarines, peaches, and apricots are grown
on seedling rootstock and form fruit on
1-year-old wood. It is easy to keep them the
desired size by pruning and still have fruit
production on seedling stock. Cherry trees
produce large canopies. There is no such
thing as a true dwarf cherry. Semidwarf
trees on Mahaleb rootstock reduce tree size
a maximum of only 10 percent. Work is be-
ing done to develop a rootstock that will re-
duce size, but the end results are a few years
away.

VI. Cultural Practices and Problems

A. Planting

Fruit trees may be planted in the fall or
spring. Bare root trees are usually available
only in the spring. Planting early in the sea-
son before the roots dry out will ensure the
best success. With containerized trees, the
time of planting is less critical. Follow these
steps to plant a fruit tree:
1. Dig a planting pit with vertical sides and
make it large enough to accommodate the

Chapter 21, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

21 - 5

root system without crowding. The pit
should be a minimum of 2 to 3 feet deep
and should allow at least a 6-inch clear-
ance from the end of the roots.

2. After removing all broken or damaged
roots, place the tree in the planting pit.
Spread the planting soil around the tree
and tamp to firm. Use planting soil that is
as good or better than the soil in which
the tree originally grew. Avoid using
planting soil around the tree that is so dif-
ferent from the native soil that water and
roots either do not penetrate the native
soil, or that water runs around the plant-
ing soil in the pit and into the native soil.
3. Pour water into the planting pit until the

consistency of thick liquid is attained.
Gently raise and lower the tree to allow
the soil to fill between the fibrous roots
and to eliminate air pockets. Add water
and planting soil alternately until the pit
is filled to grade.

4. The tree should rest at the depth at which
it grew in the nursery, and the bud union
(the place where the tree was budded in
the nursery) should be about 6 inches
above the soil level after planting. A col-
lar at the base of the tree, lighter in color
than the rest of the trunk, indicates the
original growing depth.

B. Training and Pruning

Both can influence apical dominance, or the
tendency for the apex (uppermost bud) to
grow more rapidly than the lower buds.
Apical dominance is thought to be caused
by a hormonal stimulus produced by the
growing apex that suppresses the develop-
ment of lateral bud growth. Cuts on higher
or lower parts of the tree will have differing
results in vegetative growth depending on
the distance from the apex.
1. Training—This is the process of giving

desirable structure to fruit trees from 1 to
4 years after planting. The objective of
training young trees is to establish the
essential structure of the tree and to bring
the tree into bearing.

2. Pruning—This is used to maintain the

shape of trees 3 or 4 years after planting
as well as after trees are bearing fruit.

The objective of pruning older trees is
either to open the trees to sunlight or to
maintain fruiting by pruning back the
overhanging limbs in the upper part of
the tree, so that sunlight reaches the
lower and inner portions of the tree.
There are two types of pruning cuts:
a. Heading-back cut: This is an invigo-
rating cut that causes an increase in
vegetative growth in the immediate
area of the cut. Because the hormonal
gradient is destroyed, the growth of the
lateral buds is no longer suppressed.
b. Thinning-out cut: This type of cut re-
moves shoots but does not stimulate
vigorous regrowth. Because the hor-
monal gradient is not interrupted, veg-
etative growth continues. A thinning-
out cut can also be used on upright and
overhanging growth. This type of cut
will result in an increased flower bud
production over the whole tree.

Note: Excessive pruning, especially heading-

back cuts, will delay fruiting in the
early years and reduce fruiting on
older trees.

3. Seasons of pruning—Trees can be pruned

any time after the leaves fall in autumn
and before bud break in the spring. Avoid
making large saw cuts (over 3 inches in
diameter) until hazardous winter tem-
peratures are over. If you have only a few
trees, resist the temptation to prune your
trees on the first non-subzero day that
seems warm enough to be doing some-
thing outside. Some commercial peach
growers wait until bloom time to see
what blossoms exist before they prune.
a. Winter (dormant) pruning: The dor-

mant period is the most desirable time
to prune out broken, damaged, dis-
eased, and weak wood; to remove
limbs crossing over other limbs; or to
eliminate narrow angled crotches.
(Wide angled branch crotches of 45 to
90 degrees are the strongest.)

b. Summer pruning: Trees can be pruned

any time during the growing season.

Chapter 21, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

21 - 6

Pruning during this period decreases
the shoot growth and, therefore, is a
common practice where better control
of shoot growth is desired. Rub off or
pull off water sprouts and suckers that
shade the inner parts of the tree, fruits,
and spurs. This should be done when
shoots are 3 to 4 inches long and be-
fore they become woody. Shoot re-
moval by pulling at this stage damages
adventitious buds at the base of the
shoot, which limits regrowth.

Note: Pruning after the first of September or

before trees become dormant stimu-
lates growth, making the trees more
susceptible to winter injury during
early fall freezes.

4. Pruning tips

• Don’t leave stubs! Cut close to the

trunk at the branch collar. Cut back to
a live branch or bud.

• Don’t paint wounds. Paint traps mois-
ture and encourages rot. Slant cuts so
rain runs off.

• Remember, the art of pruning comes
from knowing how and where to cut.

C. Water Management (Irrigation)

Soil moisture (e.g., not too much and not
too little) is important in maintaining tree
vigor, productivity, and fruit size.
1. Drought or moisture stress alone rarely

kills healthy, well-established fruit trees.
However, newly set trees with limited
root systems or plants damaged by cold
injury, diseases, or insects are more sus-
ceptible to moisture stress. Occasionally,
a prolonged drought results in extensive
feeder-root death, which destroys large
trees. This is most severe in sandy soils
with poor moisture-holding capacity.
2. Good soil drainage is important, espe-
cially in the spring. During the summer
and early fall, the trees deplete the avail-
able soil moisture. Irrigation is usually
required! Poor drainage is common in
soils with a high clay content and dense,
impervious subsoil, or in lowlands with a
high water table.

3. Although fruit trees have deep root sys-
tems, most of the roots are concentrated
in the upper 2 feet of soil and extend out-
ward slightly beyond the spread of the
limbs.

4. Oftentimes trees in lawns and under grass
sod are irrigated to maintain a good grass
cover, but insufficient water is applied to
the root zone of the tree. Tree roots do
not compete well with grass roots. To
remedy this problem, clean out all grass
growing under the dripline of any fruit
tree.

Note: High soil moisture levels or frequent

watering around the base of the trunk,
particularly in heavy soils, can result
in the development of crown rot, a
fungal disease that attacks the roots
and kills the tree. Overwatering by it-
self can also kill roots. Because oxy-
gen is only partially soluble in water
and becomes depleted under water-
logged conditions, the roots are as-
phyxiated. Root or crown damage
from excess moisture turns inner-bark
tissue brown. Often, damage is not ap-
parent for several months, especially if
the excess moisture occurs in late fall
or early spring. Crown rot causes ear-
lier leaf color change in the fall.

Note: Prunus species, including cherries,

peaches, and nectarines, are most sus-
ceptible to death of feeder roots in
poorly drained soils. Pears, apples,
plums, and most small fruits are more
tolerant to temporary excess soil mois-
ture, but they can be severely injured
or weakened by extended periods of
very wet soil conditions.

D. Fertilization

Nutritional deficiencies are not a direct
cause of tree death unless excessive or im-
proper fertilizing results in tree damage.
Normally, it is not advisable to fertilize at
planting. Young tree roots are easily burned,
and the tree may die back or die completely.
After growth has begun, however, use a
complete fertilizer having essential nitrogen

trees.

(N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) or
(N-P-K) with 10 percent N (such as 10-6-4
or 10-10-10), particularly in the sandy soils.
The amount of N to apply in late fall or
early spring (preferably before bud break)
depends upon the type of tree fruit and its
productive status (Table 2). Much less than
these recommended growth rates will result
in reduced fruiting wood and a smaller crop
the following year.
If you are just starting a fertilizer program,
1/8 pound of actual nitrogen should be soil
applied to stone fruits for every inch of
trunk diameter (measured 1 foot above
ground level). In the case of pome fruits
(apples and pears), 1/10 pound of actual ni-
trogen should be used for each inch of trunk
diameter.
The actual amount of N differs among prod-
ucts, and this difference must be taken into
account when computing the amount of fer-
tilizer needed. For example, a 5-inch diam-
eter peach tree will need 5/8 pound of actual
nitrogen (A.N.):

diameter x pounds A.N. required =
5 x 1/8 = 5/8 lb (.625 lb) A.N. needed
If ammonium sulfate 20-0-0 (20% N) is
used, 3 1/8 pound of fertilizer will be re-
quired to provide the N needed for a 5-inch
peach tree:

lb AN needed 

% N

=

 5/8 lb 

 0.625

= 3.125 lb

In the case of ammonium nitrate at 33 per-
cent N (33-0-0), a little over 1 7/8 pounds of
ammonium nitrate is needed for the same
5-inch diameter peach tree:

lb AN needed 

% N

=

 5/8 lb 

 0.625 
33% 0.33

= 1.89 lb

The amount of nitrogen to be applied is de-
termined by the amount of growth in the
previous year. If too little growth is oc-
curred, increase the nitrogen application. If
too much growth occurred, reduce the nitro-
gen application. Knowing how much nitro-
gen to apply requires accurate record keep-
ing.
Where organic mulches are used, the
amount of N fertilizer may be decreased as
the mulch begins to decay, releasing N. Fer-
tilizing with manure is tricky because N and
salt levels vary depending on the age and
source of the manure.
Other nutrients need to be applied according
to the results of a leaf analysis. Zinc, iron,
and boron are micronutrients that are often
deficient.

E. Insect and Disease Control

Success in growing fruit depends on effec-
tive control of insects and diseases, recogni-
tion of the common diseases and insects,
selection of effective pesticides, proper tim-
ing of pesticide sprays, and thorough cover-
age of fruit and foliage with the spray mix-
ture.
1. Organic control measures are available
for some pests but, in general, their re-
sults are mixed.

2. Commercial fruit growers, because of the
size of their operations, can afford to buy
large equipment to effectively apply pes-
ticides.

3. Home orchardists with a few fruit trees
are at a disadvantage when it comes to
obtaining equipment that will do a satis-
factory job of spraying fruit trees. In most
cases, they are restricted largely by the
cost of hand-operated sprayers or those
operated by small electric or gasoline
motors. The capacity of these machines is
small, the pressure is low, and the energy
expended to do an effective job is consid-
erable. Yet the homeowner fights the
same pests, often on the same size trees,
as the commercial grower.

Chapter 21, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

21 - 8

4. It has been shown repeatedly that failure

of homeowners to adequately control
pests on their fruit trees can generally be
attributed to not knowing what is causing
the damage or what could cause the dam-
age, not applying enough material to
cover the trees completely, not making
applications on time, and not continuing
the spray program late enough into the
summer.

Note: Dormant sprays are an important step

in controlling insects and diseases.
However, there are different dormant
sprays; some control only diseases,
while others control only insects. Con-
sult the Pacific Northwest Insect Con-
trol Handbook and the Pacific North-
west Plant Disease Control Handbook
for specific recommendations.

F. Rodent and Deer Damage

Fruit trees are susceptible to mouse, gopher,
and deer damage.
1. Mice—Eat the bark of the trunk and roots

near the soil surface. Damage is easily
detected by removing soil from around
the base of the tree and the larger roots
near the surface. Bark completely re-
moved by gnawing rodents will girdle,
weaken, and finally kill the tree. As with
other types of mechanical injury, plants
weakened but not killed by rodents are
more susceptible to drought, cold injury,
disease infections, and insect infestations.
To reduce the hazard of mouse damage,
clean out all grass and weeds in a 3- to
4-foot diameter circle around the trunk of
the tree. This rids the area of ground
cover that might protect mice from preda-
tors. Wire guards, constructed from fine
wire mesh and placed 1-inch deep in the
soil, are effective around young trees.
2. Gophers—Are best controlled in the

home garden by trapping. Poisoned baits
are available for mouse and gopher con-
trol.

3. Deer—May damage fruit trees planted

near woods or other areas with adequate
deer cover. Deer feeding on young grow-

ing shoots and buds of fruit trees can se-
verely stunt and weaken the plants. In the
late summer and fall, buck deer often
break and kill young trees while rubbing
the velvet from their antlers. Tall fences
or repeated use of approved repellents
may be required for adequate deer dam-
age control.

4. Moles can sometimes present problems

by burrowing directly under trees. In this
case, roots dry out and tunnels are used
by mice who feed on the roots. Moles do
not feed on tree roots.

G. Vegetation Management Due to Weed and

Herbicide Injury
Weeds weaken fruit trees by competing for
soil moisture and nutrients. The wise combi-
nation of cultivation and approved herbi-
cides helps reduce weed competition.
Improper or excessive herbicide use fre-
quently causes fruit tree death. Contact-
action herbicides, when misused and al-
lowed to drift onto foliage or tender green
bark, can severely injure and ultimately kill
the plant. Similarly, systemically absorbed
herbicides for weeds can be lethal to fruit
plants when improperly sprayed.
Long term use of the same soil-residual her-
bicide may eventually result in excessive
soil accumulation, causing root injury, plant
weakening, or death.
Do not plant fruit trees on sites immediately
after corn or grain crops where a persistent
herbicide, such as atrazine, was used for
weed control. Fallow the soil for one or two
growing seasons before planting fruit trees.
This allows herbicide degradation and pre-
vents tree injury or death.
Herbicides are safe, effective tools for re-
ducing weeds in fruit crop planting. To pre-
vent herbicide damage or plant death, pay
careful attention to label guidelines for ap-
plication, apply the correct rates, and use
only herbicides approved for specific fruit
crops.

H. Preventing Winter Injury

Normally, vegetative growth stops about
early August, and a terminal bud is set. Un-
usually warm fall temperatures and exces-

Chapter 21, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

21 - 9

sive amounts of nitrogen may cause contin-
ued or renewed growth in the fall. These
conditions may predispose trees to cold in-
jury; keep trees in moderately vigorous con-
dition before winter arrives.
1. Lethal winter injury occurs most fre-

quently in the lower trunk, in the crown
region, or in the roots near the soil sur-
face. The tree will generally die shortly
after growth begins in the spring, if the
damage has been severe enough to de-
stroy the inner bark tissue.
Damaged inner bark is brown, while
healthy bark and cambium tissue are a
greenish yellow. Severe cold injury may
result in split bark, however, the splits
may later heal.

2. Sunscald, another type of injury, nor-

mally occurs in late winter on the south
to southwest side of the main trunk and
large branches. Bark, whether brown or
gray, absorbs the sun’s rays in midafter-
noon and often warms up as much as
20°F above the surrounding air tempera-
ture. As a result, bright sunny days in late
winter may activate the cambium and

bark tissues on southwestern trunk expo-
sures. This reduces cold resistance and
may result in injury because of extremely
cold night temperatures. The bark dries,
then splits, and finally wood-rotting fungi
enter. This may seriously weaken or even
kill the tree. The problem is most severe
for young trees and smooth-bark trees
such as cherry and plum.
To protect a tree from sunscald, wrap the
trunk with strips of burlap or a tree wrap
material; or paint the trunk with a white
indoor latex paint, which will lower bark
temperature by reflecting light.

I. Cropping Problems

Biennial bearing (crop overproduction in
one year and a need to rest the next year)
confuses many home orchardists. This con-
dition will alternate until finally the tree will
produce fruit only every other year. To cor-
rect or reduce this problem, annual thinning
done when fruit is still small will allow the
tree to handle the crop and produce higher
quality fruit. Thinning is done by hand
when the fruit is about 1/2 inch in diameter.
After thinning, the fruit should be spaced

Small Fruits

J. A. Robbins

JoAnn Robbins, Extension Educator, Jerome County, Jerome

I. Strawberries

Strawberries are grown all over the United
States and perform well throughout the Pacific
Northwest.
A. Botanically, the strawberry is a member of
the rose family (Rosaceae). The fruit is the
swollen receptacle of the flower that bears
seeds (achenes) on its surface. A high per-
centage of these seeds must be fertile for the
berry to form properly. Plants produce for 3
to 5 years before production declines, and
then they should be replaced.
1. Strawberry varieties, except for everbear-

ing, are affected by daylength. Varieties
are regionally adapted by latitude. Buy
plants locally if possible, and base your
purchases on regional recommendations.

2. The two main types of strawberries are

June bearing and everbearing. June bear-
ing varieties set flower buds in the fall
and ripen fruit in June. Everbearing vari-
eties have a spring and fall crop.
a. The older cultivars of everbearers are
daylength sensitive and have a break
in production between the spring and
fall crops.

b. The newer day neutral varieties set the
flower buds throughout the season for
a very long harvest period with no pro-
duction break.

c. Total season berry production from the
everbearing cultivars tends to be lower
than the June bearing and day neutral
types. The June bearing types produce
the highest quality berries.

B. Cultivars in Idaho (in order of ripening)
1. Cultivars are June bearing in northern

Idaho. Be sure to select cultivars that are
adapted to northern growing conditions.
For southern Idaho, select cultivars that
are also adapted to high summer tempera-
tures.
a. Earliglow: Earliglow bears early in the

season and is resistant to many dis-
eases.

b. Crimson King: The plants of this vari-

ety are very hardy and produce large
fruit.

c. Honeoye: Another very hardy variety

with large, firm fruit.

d. Sumas: Sumas have a high yield, but
they are susceptible to fruit rot. They
grow large fruit.

e. Totem: These fruits are good fresh and

frozen. Totems are disease resistant.

f. Benton: This variety grows a medium-

sized fruit with a light inside color.

g. Shuksan: Shuksans are susceptible to
virus. The fruit is excellent fresh and
frozen.

h. Sparkle: This variety produces a soft

fruit with an excellent flavor.

2. Everbearing—Day neutral

a. Fort Laramie: An everbearing plant,

the Fort Laramie is very hardy and
productive.

b. Quinault: Another everbearing plant,
the Quinault produces small berries,
which are soft and have a good flavor.

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

22 - 2

c. Tristar: The Tristar is day neutral and

productive; it bears relatively large
fruit with a good flavor.

d. Tribute: A variety that is superior to
Quinault, day neutral, and later in the
season than Tristar, the Tribute has a
firm fruit.

C. Culture

1. Planting

a. Well-drained soil is required. Heavier
soils should be molded to raised beds
for improved drainage. Strawberry
pyramids and containers work well
and give good yields in small spaces.
Incorporation of organic matter ben-
efits both light (sandy) and heavy clay
soils. Adjust pH to 5.5 to 6.5.

b. Established weeds: Gardeners must
eradicate all perennial weeds before
planting. Use repeated fallow cultiva-
tion or heavy mulches.

c. Matted row culture: Most popular in
home gardens. Set plants 1 1/2 to 2
feet apart in rows 3 to 4 feet apart.
Runners from initial planting are al-
lowed to fill in to form a solid plant-
ing, until it reaches approximately one
plant every 5 to 8 inches. Remove ex-
cess plants or runners. Plants at a
higher density will produce fewer and
lower quality berries.

d. Hill culture: Plants remain as indi-

vidual plants in the garden; remove all
runners. Space individual plants 15 to
18 inches apart, and place them in
rows 2 1/2 to 3 feet apart.

2. Setting plants

a. Plant in early spring or early fall. In

areas where frost heaving is a problem,
plant only in spring, or mulch fall
plantings to reduce heaving. If you
plant at any time other than early
spring, irrigation is important. Plants
are mostly available in stores in the
spring.

b. Use certified virus, disease, and insect-

free stock when establishing a new
planting to ensure that pests are not
introduced into the garden with plant-
ing stock.

3. Fertilization

a. Timing

i.

It is important to fertilize and water
June bearers in late summer to pro-
mote maximum fall growth and
flower bud formation.

ii. Spring fertilization results in ex-
cessive formation of leaves and
runners and in less fruit growth.

iii. Fertilize everbearers and day

neutrals with small amounts several
times during the growing season.

b. Amount

i. Apply a total of 30 to 60 pounds of

actual nitrogen per acre for all
types of strawberries.

ii. June bearing types should be fertil-
ized in early August, if irrigation is
available; otherwise, fertilize in
mid-September without irrigation.

iii. A balanced fertilizer such as 10-

10-10 will supply ample phospho-
rus and potassium. Any deficien-
cies should be diagnosed with a
soil or plant tissue test.

4. Irrigation—Consistent watering is essen-

tial when plants are first set and during
dry periods in spring and summer. Irri-
gate in the morning to reduce rot.
a. Critical irrigation periods: These occur

during harvest or in late August and
fall, when plant growth resumes and
the flower buds form for the following
year’s crop.

b. Efficient irrigation methods: Black

plastic or straw mulch and plastic-tube
drip irrigation systems (soakers) are
highly adaptable to strawberry culture
and water conservation. Strawberries
absorb 90 percent of their water from
the top foot of soil.

5. Renewal (June bearers only)—After the

harvest early in July, June bearers will
benefit from removal of the foliage,
which will allow you to rid the plants of
disease-infested foliage and will act as a
stimulant to the plant for new, vigorous
foliage.

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

22 - 3

a. Cut the foliage with a lawnmower set
high or use hand tools. Be careful not
to damage the crowns.

b. Rake leaves from the plot.

6. Cold protection

a. Winter protection: In colder areas,

strawberries will benefit from a mulch.
Coarse hay or straw may be placed
over the entire planting when the
ground begins to freeze. The mulch
should be removed from the plants in
the spring. Weed-free mulch materials
should be used.

b. Spring frosts: These often kill the early

flowers. Sprinkle plants with water
during the coldest frosts (when tem-
perature at ground level reaches 34°F).
Leave the water running until the tem-
perature is above 32°F, or cover plants
with a light mulch or a floating row
protective fabric.

D. Common Plant Problems—Diagnosis and

Control
1. Diseases

a. Verticillium wilt

i. Symptoms: A soilborne fungi, ver-

ticillium wilt causes wilting and
death of older leaves in individual
plants or groups of plants. Black
lesions develop on petioles. New
roots may be short with blackened
tips. Plants may outgrow these
symptoms.

ii. Control: Avoid planting strawber-
ries in ground where potatoes, to-
matoes, strawberries, or other sus-
ceptible crops have been planted.
Eliminate infected plants and do
not replant in spots. Rotate crops.

b. Red Stele: Soilborne fungi

i. Symptoms: Often there are no
symptoms the year of planting.
During the first year of fruiting,
there may be dwarfing, reddening
of leaves, and wilting of older
leaves. Root tips may decay, caus-
ing “rat-tailed” appearance. The
central core or vascular system of
root (stele), may be clogged by

fungi and show a red discoloration
of the stele. Symptoms are most
readily apparent early in the sea-
son. They may be difficult to see
later in the season. Not all the roots
of an infected plant will show
symptoms.

ii. Control: Use certified plants. Plant
in disease-free soil. The soil needs
to have good drainage. Earliglow,
Sparkle, Tribute, Tristar, and To-
tem are resistant to this disease.

c. Viral diseases

i. Symptoms: Viral diseases can

cause stunting, an unevenness in
field or planting, as well as some
foliar symptoms, such as streaking,
cupping, and yellowing.

ii. Control: Use certified planting

stock. Control the aphid infestation,
as aphids are the primary vector of
disease.

d. Fruit rot/botrytis

i. Symptoms: Botrytis is evident in a

gray, fuzzy mold on fruit during
moist weather. Infections start at
bloom. Fruit from the infected
blossom rots as it ripens.

ii. Control: Ensure good air circula-

tion, remove infected fruit, and
clean straw mulch so that fruit rests
on clean, dry surface. Use fungi-
cide during wet springs. Apply fun-
gicide at 10 percent bloom. Repeat
according to label directions.

e. Common leaf spot

i. Symptoms: Leaf spot causes foli-
age with dark red or purple spots,
that gradually becomes gray-white
with age. Fully developed spots are
1/8 inch in diameter and have a
whitish center with red margin. In-
fection occurs during moist
weather and is most severe during
spring and fall. Crimson King is
resistant.

ii. Control: Fruit rot fungicide sprays

will keep this disease under con-
trol. Removing foliage from June

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

22 - 4

bearers after harvest reduces inocu-
lum.

f. Powdery mildew

i. Symptoms: Disease causes upward

curling of leaflet edges. Leaf un-
dersides become reddened and
coated with a grayish white fungus.
Leaves later turn purplish red. To-
tem and Benton strains are very tol-
erant. Shuksan has moderate sus-
ceptibility. Fort Laramie is very
susceptible.

ii. Control: Destroy old infected

leaves.

2. Insects

a. Root weevils

i. Damage: Larvae feed on root sys-
tems. Adults notch edges of leaves.

ii. Control: Don’t use chemical con-

trol in the home garden. Collect
adults at night on leaves and de-
stroy.

b. Aphids

i. Damage: Can spread viruses.
ii. Control: Hose off and use insecti-

cidal soap sprays.

c. Spider mites

i. Damage: There is a stippled ap-

pearance to top part of leaves,
which leads to bleaching. Webbing
and mites will be found on the un-
dersides of leaves.

ii. Control: See aphid control.

d. Spittle bugs are small, yellow-green

insects similar to the leaf hopper in ap-
pearance.
i. Damage: Nymphs develop “spittle”

on plants.

ii. Control: Since this pest is not a

major one, there is no need to con-
trol.

e. Slugs (mostly nocturnal): Many sizes

feed on foliage and fruit.
i. Damage: Slugs cause leaf damage,

often in the leaf center.

ii. Control: Manually remove or use
slug bait around the perimeter of
the garden. Bury containers of beer

with the lip of the container at soil
level to attract and drown slugs.
Check containers often.

II. Red Raspberries

Red raspberries are grown as a commercial
crop in the Pacific Northwest. More than
10,000 acres are planted in Washington,
Oregon, and British Columbia. Raspberries
can be expected to do well in most Idaho loca-
tions, although severe freeze injury to canes
will occur in many winters in southeastern
Idaho.
A. Botanically, raspberries are members of the

Rose family (Rosaceae) and belong to the
genus Rubus, as do blackberries and other
caneberries. The plants are perennial, with
roots that live 40 years or more. Red rasp-
berries have stiff erect canes, which are usu-
ally covered with thorns. Canes are pro-
duced freely from adventitious buds on the
roots, and they generally live two seasons.
1. Fruit is borne on lateral fruit spurs pro-

duced on 1-year-old canes. Fruiting canes
die after harvest; meanwhile, new canes
(primocanes) have been growing from
the root system to be next year’s fruiting
wood.

2. The raspberry is an aggregate composed
of 75 to 125 drupelets that separate from
the receptacle when ripe, producing a
hollow “berry.”

3. Optimum production for red raspberries
is in areas with relatively cool summers,
a rain-free harvest season, and a mild
winter with sufficient cold to satisfy
chilling requirements. However, care in
cultivar selection will sustain fruit in
areas lacking in one or more of these con-
ditions. Raspberries are one of the hardi-
est of cane fruits. Some cultivars will tol-
erate temperatures to -20°F without dam-
age.

4. Red raspberries come in two types: Sum-

mer bearing and fall bearing.
a. Summer bearing raspberry canes are
biennial, growing one year and pro-
ducing the next.

b. The fall bearing raspberry produces

canes that bear on the upper part of the

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

22 - 5

primocanes in the same growing sea-
son. These canes, if left the second
year, will bear fruit on the lower por-
tions.
i. Alternatively, the canes can be to-

ii.

tally removed by mowing to the
ground after the fall crop is har-
vested. When managed in this way,
fall bearing raspberries will bear
only the single crop in the fall.
In Idaho locations with short grow-
ing seasons, fall bearing raspberries
may not ripen their crop. Trial
plantings of these cultivars are rec-
ommended to ascertain their ripen-
ing characteristics.

B. Cultivars in Idaho
1. Summer bearing

a. Boyne: Hardy in cold conditions,
Boynes are good fresh and frozen.
This variety is productive.

b. Canby: Canbys produce a thornless

plant. They are virus resistant and
aphid immune, but sensitive to root
rot. This variety is very productive,
and it is cold hardy through Zone 4.
c. Haida: Though this variety is hardy
and has large, sweet, firm berries, it
has short canes and is low in vigor.
d. Latham: A popular variety, Lathams

are hardy and have a nice flavor.

e. Newburgh: Newburghs are cold hardy,
as well as resistant to root rot and mo-
saic virus.

f. Nootka: This variety is a firm, flavor-

ful, vigorous plant.

g. Nordic: Nordics are cold hardy, pro-
ductive, and resistant to fungal dis-
eases and aphid feeding.

h. Skeena: A large, bright fruit, the

Skeena is hardy and root rot suscep-
tible.

i. Taylor: A long conic fruit, the Taylor
has an excellent flavor and is produc-
tive.

j. Titan: The Titan produces a hardy,

large fruit with a mild flavor. It is very
productive and root rot susceptible.

2. Fall bearing

a. Amity: This variety harvests about a
week earlier than Heritage. It has a
good size, flavor, and firmness.

b Autumn Bliss: A early crop variety,

Autumn Bliss creates berries that have
a large size and good flavor.

c. Heritage: The Heritage ripens late in

fall and produces heavy yields.

d. Redwing: A soft fruit, resistant to high
temperatures, this strain ripens earlier
than Heritage.

e. Ruby: Ruby bears a productive, large

fruit, which can produce when planted
with Amity.

f. Summit: While this plant has a better
flavor than Heritage and is root rot re-
sistant, it produces a small fruit.

C. Culture

1. Planting—Plant in raised mounds or
beds in heavier soil to improve drain-
age away from the crown of the plant.
a. Use certified stock, plants, or root cut-

tings.

b. Spacing is generally 1 1/2 to 3 feet
apart in rows 6 to 8 feet apart. You
must ensure a recommended 4 foot
minimum depth to winter water table
to create optimum conditions for high
fertility and freedom from erosion.

c. Soil: Good drainage, high water-hold-

ing capacity, and adequate depth are
essential. Plants are highly susceptible
to root rot. Heavy, poorly drained soil
severely limits life expectancy of
plants. Irrigation is required on sandy
or gravelly soils.

2. Established weeds—Gardeners must
eradicate all perennial weeds before
planting. Use fallow cultivation or heavy
mulch.

3. Training—Place top wires at 4 1/2 to

5 1/2 feet to support canes. You may also
have another wire at 2 to 3 feet. Use one-,
two-, or four-wire systems. Plants will be
shorter in some climates (Fig. 1).

4. Hill culture—Maintain plants as indi-

vidual hills (weeding is easier), or allow
to fill in as a solid row. Light distribution

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

22 - 6

is better when each individual cane is
spaced along the wire separately. Canes
are bundled commercially for labor sav-
ings. Tie canes to top wire in fall or win-
ter as in Fig. 1. Tie in clumps or individu-
ally along the wire.

5. Pruning—Top dormant canes 6 to 10

inches above the wire in early spring to
stimulate lateral branching. Canes are
subject to dieback in a cold winter if they
are pruned in the fall.
a. Remove all fruiting canes after har-

vest, as that reduces insect and disease
problems, helps in hardening off pro-
cess, and simplifies weed control. Re-
move weak new canes or those with
small diameter.

b. Cut off canes close to soil line. Leave
all canes over 6 feet and the diameter
of your index finger (about 12 healthy
canes per hill, or in solid rows spaced
4 to 5 inches between canes). Keep
rows no more than about 12 inches
wide.

6. Fertilization—Test the soil to determine

plant needs. Broadcast apply in spring
over rows or split application with one-
half applied at first growth in spring and
the remaining one-half at the beginning

of or at fruit set. Apply a total of about 30
pounds actual nitrogen per acre.

7. Weed control—Hand hoe weeds between

hills. Cultivate very shallowly.
a. Remove suckers between rows as they

emerge.

b. Cover crops between rows are effec-

tive.

c. Herbicides can be used to control

weeds. Make sure they are registered
for use in raspberries.

8. Irrigation—Watering frequency will vary

with conditions. As a general rule, irri-
gate every 2 to 3 weeks before and after
harvest; then supplement with a weekly
irrigation during harvest.

9. Cold protection

a. Winter protection: Good snow cover

or mulch will protect crowns. In severe
areas, or with less hardy cultivars, pin
canes to the ground and mulch over
them.

b. Spring frosts: See strawberries.

D. Common Plant Problems—Diagnosis and

Control
1. Diseases

a. Phytophthora root rots: A fungus dis-

ease caused by Phytophthors
erythroseptica.
i. Symptoms: The disease kills the

fine feeder roots, while the interior
of any larger roots becomes brown.
Suckering is reduced. New
primocanes wilt and leaves die.
Floricane leaves turn bright yellow
and brown and then die out. Fa-
vored by wet, heavy soils.

ii. Control: Use certified plants free of
disease. Plant on well-drained soils.
Increase drainage by using raised
beds.

b. Virus diseases

i. Symptoms: Viruses create stunting,

or delayed growth in the spring;
crumbly berries; ring spotting; and
a bright yellow mosaic on the
leaves.

ii. Control: Plant certified stock; re-

move infected plants.

which cause the death of the cane.
ii. Control: Dig out infected plants by
hand. Replant any new plantings in
different area.

b. Spider mites

i. Damage: Their feeding reduces
plant vigor and causes leaves to
brown and drop prematurely. When
pesticide use kills natural preda-
tors, the mites are often a problem.

c. Cane borer

i. Damage: These insects bore tun-
nels in the upper portions of the
cane (Shepherd’s Crook).

ii. Control: Prune out any affected

cane and destroy. Use no chemical
control.

d. Yellow jackets

i. Damage: Yellow jackets hide in

ripe fruit and feed on sugars. They
are a hazard to those working in the
plants.

ii. Control: Keep overripe fruit har-
vested. Yellow jacket traps can be
effective.

3. Other

a. Crumbly berry

i. Damage: Crumbly berries may re-

veal a plant with a Boron defi-
ciency. Soil testing is recom-
mended. A virus disease may inter-
fere with flower functions, causing
crumbly fruit. Poor pollination oc-
curring from lack of bees or from
poor weather during flowering also
causes crumbly fruits.

ii. Control: Add boron, if necessary;
add bees to the field; and replace
plants with virus free stock.

b. Sunburn/high temperatures

i. Damage: The fruit forms, but it

doesn’t ripen, or it ripens slowly.
This problem is caused by excess
ultraviolet rays or elevated tem-
peratures.

ii. Control: Shade the plants, espe-

cially during high noon hours. Use
shadecloth or plant in the shade of
other foliage or structures.

nels in lower portions of canes,

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

c. Crown gall: Bacterial disease.

i. Symptoms: Dark “knobs or tu-

mors” of growth appear at or below
soil line. Crown gall spreads prima-
rily by pruning, when it enters new
wounds on pruning shears. It also
can come in on infected planting
stock.
 Control: Remove plants.

ii.

d. Fruit rot/botrytis (see strawberries)
e. Spur blight: A common fungal disease
(Didymella applanta) in damper areas,
spur blight causes little damage in this
area. Buds on infected canes are more
susceptible to winter injury.
i. Symptoms: Spur blight creates

wedge-shaped necrotic lesions on
leaves, especially near base of
cane. Infected leaves drop, leaving
petiole attached to cane. Brown or
reddish-brown lesions appear
around buds at base of petiole;
these lesions are usually limited to
one or two buds. Minute black fruit-
ing bodies appear on lesion by fall.
ii. Control: Avoid overhead watering

if possible. Remove and destroy
infected canes. Thin canes appro-
priately to allow for air movement.
Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer.

f. Verticillium wilt (see strawberries)
g. Anthracnose (see blackberries)
h. Yellow rust: Caused by a fungus, par-

ticularly following late spring rains.
i. Symptoms: Plants develop leaves
with yellow spotting, and later be-
come dusty from the yellow spores.
Lower leaves yellow and drop, and
the crop is reduced. The fruit dies
before maturing. In the winter, in-
fected leaves produce black spores
at sites of infection.

ii. Control: Good sanitation. Remove
sources of infection; cut old fruit-
ing canes immediately after harvest
and destroy.

2. Insects

a. Crown borer

i. Damage: These insects bore tun-

III. Black and Purple Raspberries

A. Purple raspberries are hybrids of red and

black. The fruits resemble the red more than
the black. Both have canes that will root at
the tips and are propagated by tip layers.
1. Black raspberries are less cold hardy than
red or purple types. Freeze injury will be-
gin at temperatures around -5°F.

2. They are susceptible to virus diseases and

anthracnose.

3. Except for Royalty, the following culti-
vars sucker poorly, so hill culture rather
than hedgerow is recommended.

B. Cultivars in Idaho

1. Black raspberries

a. Allen: An early fruit with a concen-
trated ripening, this strain is hardy.
b. Black Hawk: A late variety, Black

Hawk produces large, flavorful ber-
ries. A productive variety, it is very
hardy, to Zone 5 (-20° to -10°F).

c. Lowden: The Lowden is a cross be-
tween a purple and a black raspberry
with an excellent flavor. The plant has
good disease resistance and is hardy.
d. Munger: The fruit of the Munger has
an excellent flavor. Mungers ripen in
midseason and are also hardy.

2. Purple raspberries

a. Brandywine: A variety that produces

large fruit with a tart flavor, the
Brandywine is very winter hardy, to
Zone 4 (-30° to -20°F).

b. Royalty: Royalty produces large fruit,
which is sweet when fully ripe. It is a
very productive variety and hardy to
Zone 4 (-30° to -20°F). This variety
ripens late.

C. Culture (see Red Raspberries)
D. Common Plant Problems—Diagnosis and

Control (see Red Raspberries)

IV. Trailing Berries (Blackberries)

Trailing berries are in the same genus as rasp-
berries (Rubus). Their fruit is similar to rasp-
berries, but a white core or receptacle remains
part of the fruit when picked.

A. Blackberries are the least hardy of the ber-
ries grown in Idaho. These plants can be in-
jured by temperatures between +5° and
-10°F. Boysenberries, Loganberries,
Tayberries, Nectarberries, and
Marionberries are all trailing berries.

B. Cultivars In Idaho

1. Cherokee—The plant has an upright,
thorny, strong vigorous growth; it is
hardy to Zone 5 (-20° to -10°F).

2. Chester—This variety has a semi-erect

plant that is productive and hardy to Zone
5 (-20° to -10°F). In fact, the Chester is
the most hardy of the thornless type. It
produces large fruit late in the season.

3. Darrow—A tall, semi-erect, variety, the
Darrow is the most cold hardy cultivated
blackberry.

4. Hull—Another semi-erect variety, the
Hull produces large fruit. The plant is
thornless, and its growth is vigorous.
5. Roseborough—An upright plant, the
Roseborough holds up under extreme
heat and dryness. It produces heavy crops
and is hardy to Zone 5 (-20° to -10°F).

C. Culture

1. The planting, fertilization, and soil re-
quirements are similar to those for red
raspberries.

2. Trellising systems—Long canes of trail-
ing and semi-erect varieties are generally
“woven” on a two-wire trellis system as
in Fig. 2. Wires are 18 inches apart with
the top wire 5 feet from ground level.
Upright cultivars will not require trellising,
or at most a single wire at 5 feet.

3. Pruning—Remove fruiting canes after
harvest. Weave new canes around top
wire in fall or spring.

D. Common Plant Problems—Diagnosis and

Control
1. Diseases (see red raspberries)

a. Leaf and cane spot (Septoria leaf

spot): Fungal disease.
i. Symptoms: Leaf spots vary from
light to dark brown. They begin as
an 1/8 inch purple spot later turning
brown. Cane spots are larger and
may contain fruiting bodies

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

22 - 9

(spores). Spots girdle and kill cane.
The disease is promoted by canes
overwintering on or near ground.

ii. Control: Remove fruiting canes af-
ter harvest. Provide good air circu-
lation.

b. Anthracnose: Overwinters on infected

canes.
i. Symptoms: Purple spots appear on

canes, then increase in size, and
develop light gray centers with
brown-purple edges. Spots con-
verge to form large irregular le-
sions. Canes may dry and crack.
On leaves purple spots enlarge to
form gray to white areas that drop
out. Berries ripen prematurely and
are small and dry.

ii. Control: Remove canes after har-
vest. Leave no old stubs. Thin to
allow air circulation.
2. Insects (see red raspberries)

V. Blueberries

Blueberries, members of the Ericaceae or
heath family, prefer a culture similar to
rhododendrons or azaleas. Wild blueberries are

often called “huckleberries,” but are just dif-
ferent species of the cultivated blueberry.
A. Blueberry production in Idaho will be lim-

ited to those sites with acidic soil (pH of 4.5
to 5.5).
1. In areas with alkaline soil, grow blueber-

ries in raised beds or large containers
with peat. The addition of ground sulfur,
1 pound per 100 square feet in sandy soil
and 2 pounds per 100 square feet in clay
soil, will lower the pH approximately
one point.

2. Blueberry plants are attractive and can

serve as ornamentals and fruit producers,
as they tolerate partial shading better
than other berry crops.

3. Blueberries are self fertile but will have
higher yields with cross-pollination. The
plants are hardy.

B. Cultivars in Idaho (listed in order of ripen-

ing dates).
1. Earliblue—This short plant variety flow-

ers very early.

2. Patriot—The Patriot is a very hardy

plant with large, firm fruit.

3. Northland—A hardy, spreading plant,

the Northland has a good flavor.

4. Bluecrop—A fruit with an excellent

sweet flavor, this variety has a vigorous
plant.

5. Blueray—Large, firm fruit.
6. Jersey—Fair flavor; late, vigorous plant.

C. Culture

1. Established weeds—Eradicate all peren-

nial weeds before planting. Use fallow
cultivation or mulches.

2. Planting

a. Setting: Blueberries are set out as dor-

mant plants in late winter or potted
plants in spring or fall.

b. Soil: The root system is shallow, fi-
brous, and prefers soil with high or-
ganic matter and good water holding
capacity. Add organic matter to soil
when planting; mix well with soil in
and around planting hole. Mulch to
protect the shallow root system from
temperature extremes and drying.

3. Pruning—Prune hard after planting to

stimulate new growth. For mature plants,
remove older canes to ground or to strong
lateral, retaining 1- to 3-year-old wood.
4. Fertilization—The amount of fertilizer

used depends on the rate of previous
growth. Apply light amounts three times
in the growing season for optimal
growth. Ammonium sulfate is a good ni-
trogen source to help acidify soil.

5. Irrigation—Keep soil evenly moist.

Plants need adequate drainage. Drip irri-
gation systems work well. Mulch up to 6
inches deep to conserve water.

D. Common Plant Problems—Diagnosis and

Control
1. Diseases

a. Mummy berry: Fungus disease
(Monilinia vacciniicorymbosi).
i. Symptoms: Infected berries are
reddish-buff or tan “mummies.”
They fall to the ground, gray, shriv-
eled, and hard to overwinter. In
spring as blueberry buds break,
fruiting cups grow from mummies
on the soil and release infecting
spores. Blossoms become infected
and turn brown and wither. New

vegetative shoot is blackened in the
center and wilts and dies. The re-
maining fruit becomes infected.
ii. Control: Remove and destroy all

infected parts including fruit.
Mulch thickly to bury any dropped
mummies. In early spring destroy
developing fruiting cups by cultiva-
tion. Apply fungicide during bloom
according to label instructions.

b. Botrytis

i. Symptoms: Twig dieback in wet
weather, invading blossoms, and
moving down shoots.

ii. Control: Apply fungicide early in

spring when growth begins. Re-
peat, but do not make more than
four applications before harvest.
Follow label instructions. Prune out
and destroy dead twigs.

2. Insects

a. Aphids

i. Damage: Deform leaves, devitalize

plants, secrete honeydew.

ii. Control: Light infestations may be
controlled by natural insect preda-
tors; use insecticidal soap.

b. Cherry fruitworm

i. Damage: Larvae approximately 3/8

inch in size will bore into the ber-
ries.

ii. Control: Insecticidal sprays before
bloom or after, according to label
directions, for cherry fruitworm on
blueberries.

c. Leafrollers

i. Damage: Create webs and feed on

foliage and fruit.

ii. Control: Bacillus thuringensis at

any time.

d. Scale

i. Damage: Weaken plant.
ii. Control: Prune off infested areas as

soon as observed.

3. Birds—Can be a persistent problem. Net
plants as the fruit colors. Secure the pe-
rimeter of the net carefully. Use mylar
strips or balloons to scare away birds.

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

VI. Hardy Kiwi

Fig. 3. Kiwi on trellis.

A. The botanical name of the hardy kiwi
fruit, also known as Siberian Goose-
berry, is Actinidia arguta. It is a mem-
ber of the Actinidiaceae family (not re-
lated to the common garden gooseber-
ries). Kiwi fruit is native to eastern Asia.
Chinese gooseberry (A. chinensis) is not
hardy anywhere in Idaho, as fruit buds
are damaged by temperatures of 10° to
15°F.
1. The fruit is fuzzy and brown skinned,

approximately the size of a large
cherry. The flesh is green with edible
black seeds and has a unique “fruity”
flavor. Fruit is high in vitamin C and
stores well.

2. Kiwi is dioecious (Latin for two

houses), which means there are sepa-
rate male and female plants. One male
will pollinate six to eight female plants
within 50 feet. Bloom periods between
male and female must match. Some vari-
eties are self-fertile.

B. Cultivars in Idaho

1. Seedlings—Many varieties are just listed
as A. arguta, available in male or female
plants.

2. Ananasnaja—A variety with a fuzzless
skin, the Ananasnaja is very sweet and
spicy. The Russian name means “pine-
apple-like.”

3. Issai—Self-fertile, the Issai has fruit with
sweet flesh, often used as a fruit-produc-
ing pollinator. This variety is very pro-
ductive.

4. Meader—A good pollinator for

Ananasnaja, the Meader produces sweet
fruit and ripens in late August.

C. Culture
1. Site

a. Hardiness: Dormant vines are hardy to

-25° to -30°F and sensitive to late
spring frosts. Avoid frost pockets.

b. Soil: Kiwi need well-drained soil, even

soil moisture, and a sunny location
free from wind to protect fruit and
laterals from damage and drying.

C

A

B

A = 1-year wood

B = 2-year wood

C = 3-year wood

2. Training and trellising—The vines are

large and heavy so the Kiwi needs a
strong trellis system as in Fig. 3. The
Kiwi is a perennial with a lifespan of 50
to 60 years. Pressure-treated posts should
be 5 to 6 feet tall with another 3 feet be-
low ground. Use high tensile 12 or 10
gauge wire. A T-bar trellis with three to
five horizontal wires is recommended.
Space the plants 10 to 15 feet apart in
row and 10 to 15 feet between rows.

3. Pruning

a. Summer pruning: A must for Kiwis.

Avoid shading of fruiting wood. Prune
new growth several times to 6 to 8
inches during the growing period.

b. Winter pruning: Prune during the dor-
mant period. Start by developing well
defined leaders or cordons which will
be permanent. Set up an evenly spaced
system of fruiting arms or laterals.
i. Remove fruiting wood that is los-
ing vigor. Start with one-third re-
moval each year.

ii. Remove fruiting lateral after third

year.

iii. Shorten 1-year wood to two to four

buds. Allow second-year wood to
fruit freely.

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

22 - 12

4. Fertilization

C. Culture

a. Young plants: Add balanced fertilizer

1. Soil—The currant will grow on a wide

split into two applications.

b. Mature plants: Apply one-half to two-
thirds of the balanced fertilizer at bud
break; then apply the rest after the fruit
is set.

5. Harvesting—Plants take 3 to 4 years to
bear; they reach full production in 7 to 8
years. Pick the fruit in late August to No-
vember when it is firm-ripe (for best
storage ability). Keep refrigerated.

D. Common Plant Problems—Diagnosis and

Control
1. Diseases—None.
2. Insects—None.
VII. Black Currants

A. The black currant, or Ribes nigrum, is a na-

tive of central and eastern Europe.
1. The native plant grows in damp, woodsy
places. A fully grown bush may reach 5
to 6 feet in height and spread, and have
an average yield of 10 to 12 pounds per
plant.

2. There are many cultivars, mostly of Eu-
ropean origin. Most are extremely hardy.
Black currants are partially self-fruitful,
but set a larger drop with another cultivar
nearby. Plant nonblister rust resistant cul-
tivars at least 1,000 feet and preferably 3/
4 mile from the nearest five-needle pine.

B. Cultivars in Idaho

1. Black September—This variety produces
a large, firm fruit with a strong black cur-
rant flavor that is hardy to -30°F. The
plant is mildew resistant.

2. Consort—The fruit of the Consort has a
sweet, musky flavor, while the plant is
self-fruitful, resistant to white-pine blister
rust, and hardy to -30°F.

3. Crusader—The Crusader needs a pollina-

tor; it is rust resistant.

4. Jostaberry—This variety is a cross be-

tween a black currant and a gooseberry. It
produces large fruit that is good fresh.
The vigorous plant is resistant to mildew
and white-pine blister rust and is cold
hardy.

variety of soils. The ideal pH is 6.5 with
good water holding capacity. Currants
will tolerate poorly drained soils. Add
organic matter to light soils.

2. Site—Plants bloom early so avoid frost

pockets. Though the currant prefers a
sunny location, it will tolerate partial
shade. Control all perennial weeds before
planting.

3. Planting—Plant in late winter or early
spring. Space the plants 5 feet apart in
rows, with 6 feet between rows. Plants
grow by stooling; plant 2 inches deeper
than in nursery. Cut all shoots to 2-inch
stubs at planting. Plants root easily; use
prunings as cuttings.

4. Pruning—Prune annually, as black cur-
rants bear best on 1-year wood. Remove
all 3-year-old wood annually, as well as
any older growth. Cut to strong young
shoot, or near base, or off completely.
Keep five or six canes each of 1- and
2-year-old wood.

5. Irrigation and fertilization—The currant
likes even soil moisture. It will require
frequent irrigation in arid parts of the
state. Currants are fairly heavy feeders,
so apply balanced fertilizer in March and
more nitrogen in April.

6. Weed control—These plants are shallow

rooted, so avoid deep cultivation. Saw-
dust mulch 4 inches thick is effective in
controlling weeds.

D. Common Plant Problems—Diagnosis and

Control (see Gooseberries)

VIII. Red and White Currants

A. Red currants, or Ribes rubrum and Ribes

spicatum, are native to Europe. A full-
grown bush may be 5 to 6 feet in height and
spread. The fruit is smooth skinned and glis-
tening. Red currants are used for jelly, pies,
juice, and wine.
1. The white currant is a sport of the red

currant, and the culture is the same.

2. The plants are self-pollinating; the aver-

age yield of the mature plant is 8 to 10
pounds of fruit per plant.

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

22 - 13

B. Cultivars in Idaho

1. Red currants

a. Cherry: This variety has a high fruit
quality, is hardy in Zone 3 (-40° to -
30°F), and is productive.

b. Minnesota 71: A vigorous plant, the
Minnesota 71 produces large fruit of
good quality.

c. Red Lake: The Red Lake is productive

with a long growing season. It pro-
duces early fruit. The dark red berries
are widely grown.

2. White currants

a. White Imperial: An old, but vigorous
variety, the White Imperial produces
very sweet medium to large fruit.

b. White Pearl: The White Pearl has a

pale yellow skin and large fruit.

C. Culture

1. Soil—Both white and red currants are

less tolerant of poorly-drained soils than
black currants. Ideal pH is 6.5. The plants
need good water holding capacity; add
organic matter to light soils.

2. Site—These plants bloom early, so avoid

frost pockets. The flowers are hardier
than black currants; you’ll find them use-
ful for north-facing walls. If you want
full flavor in the fruit, then these plants
require a sunny location. Control all pe-
rennial weeds before planting.

3. Planting—Plant in late winter or early

spring. Space plants 5 feet apart in rows,
with 5 feet between rows. Plant at the
same depth as in nursery.

4. Pruning—Your objective is to create a
goblet-shaped bush with 8 to 10 main
branches. Prune leaders to outward fac-
ing-buds. Prune drooping branches to up-
ward-facing buds. Fruit buds produced in
clusters at base of 1-year wood or on
short spurs on old wood. Maintain about
three canes each of 1-, 2-, and 3-year-old
wood.

5. Irrigation and fertilization—These cur-
rants like even soil moisture. Use mulch
on light soils. The plants are fairly heavy
feeders, so apply balanced fertilizer in
March at bud break.

6. Weed control—As the plants are shallow

rooted, avoid deep cultivation.

7. Harvesting—Pick as soon as the berries
are clear in color. Pick whole clusters to
avoid injury to delicate fruit.

D. Common Plant Problems—Diagnosis and

Control (see Gooseberries)

IX. Gooseberries

A. Botanically, gooseberries are known as

Ribes usa-crispa.
1. They are self-pollinating and are a de-

ciduous, thorny shrub.

2. The mature plant has a height and spread
of 5 feet, and produces 5 to 6 pounds of
fruit. It bears fruit like red currant at the
base of 1-year wood and on spurs of
older wood.

3. Gooseberries are more tolerant of hot

weather than currants.

B. Cultivars in Idaho

1. Captivators—This variety is winter hardy

and disease resistant. It produces a large
1-inch fruit that is pink to red when it is
ripe and has an average flavor.

2. Pixwell—A hardy, thornless plant, the
Pixwell produces fruit with sweet, pink
flesh.

3. Poorman—A vigorous productive vari-
ety, the Poorman has a highly flavored,
wine-red fruit. The plants are hardy.

4. Welcome—Welcomes are extremely pro-

ductive plants with medium to large,
light-green fruits that have a sweet-tart
flavor.

C. Culture

1. Soil—The top 18 inches of soil needs to

be well drained. An ideal pH is 6.5.
Gooseberries need good water holding
capacity; add organic matter to light
soils.

2. Site—Avoid frost pockets, as the plants
bloom early and blossoms can be dam-
aged by spring frost. Gooseberries are
tolerant of partial shade, though they do
best in sunny site. Control all perennial
weeds before planting; the thorny plant is
hard to weed around.

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

22 - 14

3. Planting—Plant in late winter or early

spring. Gooseberries are one of the first
berry plants to leaf out. Space plants 5
feet apart in rows, with 5 feet between
rows. Plant at same depth as nursery.

4. Pruning—See red currants.
5. Irrigation and fertilization—The goose-

berry likes even soil moisture. Uneven or
heavy watering may cause fruit to split as
it ripens. Use mulch on light soils. The
plants are fairly heavy feeders so apply
balanced fertilizer in March at bud break.
6. Weed control—As the plants are shallow

rooted, avoid deep cultivation.

7. Harvesting—Protect the plants from birds

with netting. Pick as soon as the berries
are good size, but while they are still
green (June or July). For dessert fruit thin
every other one. Use thinnings for cook-
ing.

D. Common Plant Problems—Diagnosis and

Control
1. Diseases

a. Anthracnose or leaf fungal disease:

Overwinters on dead leaves.
i. Symptoms: The disease creates

small leaf and fruit spots. By mid-
season there is a yellowing and
dropping of leaves.

ii. Control: Remove and destroy af-

fected leaves. Prune to open center
to allow air circulation.

b. Powdery mildew: A fungal disease

that overwinters on twigs.
i. Symptoms: The mildew can be

seen as a white, powdery growth on
the surface of leaves, green shoots,
and fruits. Infected plants are
stunted.

ii. Control: Prune to maintain an open

plant with good air circulation.

c. White pine blister rust (fungal dis-

ease): It is no longer illegal to cultivate
Ribes in Idaho. (Too many wild Ribes
combined with rust resistant pine culti-
vars). Alternate the host to five-needle
pines. Black currant is most suscep-
tible.

i. Symptoms: Small cuplike spots ap-
pear on the underside of leaves and
produce orange yellow spores.

ii. Control: Remove and destroy in-
fected plants. Do not plant Ribes
near five-needle pines.

2. Insects

a. Currant fruit fly (gooseberry maggot).
i. Damage: The larvae enter the soil

in late June. They overwinter as
pupae in brown cases the size of
wheat grains. Flies emerge in April
and lay eggs on the developing ber-
ries of either currants or gooseber-
ries.

ii. Control: Use shallow cultivation
under bushes during July and Au-
gust , as this method helps expose
and kill pupae.

b. Currant aphid

i. Damage: A small, yellow aphid

appears on new growth in the
spring. The aphid overwinters as
eggs on bark. It causes cupping and
red color on new leaves. Honeydew
accumulates.

ii. Control: Use water washes or in-

secticidal soap.

c. Currant borer

i. Damage: The adults are clear

winged with blue-black coloring
and yellow markings. The larvae
tunnel in the canes. Canes wilt in
summer and autumn.

ii. Control: Prune out and destroy in-

fected canes.

d. Imported currantworm

i. Damage: The larvae are 1/2 inch
long, greenish in color, while the
immature have dark spots. They
feed along leaf margin and may de-
foliate the plant when they become
numerous. Sawfly adults are black
with yellow markings.

ii. Control: Use insecticide according

to label recommendations for
currantworm on gooseberries.

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

22 - 15

e. Two-spotted spider mite

i. Damage: Adults are 1/5 inch long,

tan or greenish in color with two
spots on each side of the back.
They overwinter as adults on weeds
and debris near host plant. Feeding
reduces plant vigor and causes stip-
pling on leaves. Webbing, when
severe, may cause leaf drop.

ii. Control: Insecticidal soap.

X. Elderberries

A. Elderberries belong to the genus Sambucus

and grow wild over much of the United
States and Canada. The blue or black variet-
ies are edible. The fruit, born in flat clusters,
makes excellent jelly, jams, pies, and wine.
Most elderberries require cross-pollination,
and all are hardy to Zone 4 (-30° to -20°F).

B. Cultivars in Idaho

1. Adams—A strong plant with huge clus-

ters, this variety produces sweet fruit.

2. Johns—This variety bears later than the

Adams and produces best when it has
been cross-pollinated. It also has huge
clusters of large, sweet fruit.

3. Nova—Pollinate the Nova with the York.

The plant produces large, sweet fruit.

4. York—This hardy, late plant produces the

juicy, sweet fruit that is the largest fruit
of any elderberry. Pollinate the York with
the Nova.

C. Culture

1. Soil—The elderberry grows on about any
soil type, but prefers moist, well-drained,
siltloam soils, neutral to slightly acidic.
2. Irrigation and fertilization—The plants

need to stay evenly moist. Fertilize
lightly, as the root system is shallow.

3. Weed control—Elderberries can be

grown in sod. Mulch with 4 to 6 inches of
sawdust to control weeds and conserve
moisture.

4. Propagation—Plants are spread by sto-
lons. Propagate with hardwood, green-
wood, or root-cuttings.

5. Pruning—This vigorous plant requires

pruning to control size and maintain pro-
ductivity. Cut a few main shoots to the

ground each year. Prune out all wood
more than 4 years old.

D. Common Plant Problems—Diagnosis and

Control
1. Diseases—None.
2. Insects—None.

XI. Grapes

A. Grapes account for one-fourth of all fruit

production in the world. They are used for
wine and juice, preserves, and are eaten as
raisins or table fruit.
1. Grape production in Idaho is limited by
cold winter temperatures and, in many
locations, short growing seasons.

2. All grapes in the Genus Vitis have vines

that are generally vigorous and deep
rooted. Grape varieties are self-polli-
nated. Fruit is borne on current season’s
growth.

B. Cultivars in Idaho
1. Types of grapes

a. European (Vitis vinifera): European

varieties produce a tight-skinned wine,
raisin or table grape. Quality wine
types are made from them. Most vin-
iferas require a mild winter such as
those in California or Arizona (hardy
only to about 10°F). Thompson seed-
less falls in this group and will not be
hardy in Idaho.

b. American (Vitis labrusca): American
varieties have a slip skin and a musty
or “foxy” flavor. The Concord is a
typical example. Some are quite winter
hardy.

c. French and American hybrids: These

are crosses intended to combine the
quality of European grapes with the
hardiness and disease resistance of
American grapes.

2. Cultivars

a. Betas: This plant is a productive

American blue-black variety with a
tangy, wild grape flavor. It is good for
jelly and juice and is hardy to -40°F.
b. Black Monukkas: While this grape is

one of the hardiest of the European
plants, it still requires winter protec-

Chapter 22, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

tion in many parts of Idaho. The fruit
is large, reddish-black, and mostly
seedless. It is sweet and good fresh.
c. Campbell’s Early (Island Belle): A

Concord type with early fruit, this va-
riety is good for juice.

d. Concord: An American, blue-black

plant with a vigorous, hardy vine, this
variety is cold-resistant to -15°F. The
fruit has a distinctive flavor.

e. Fredonia (Early Concord): Another
American variety similar to the Con-
cord, though it bears fruit earlier, this
plant is hardy to -40°F.

f. Himrod: An American variety with a

golden yellow, seedless fruit, this
grape makes a good table grape. The
Himrod is hardy to -15°F.

g. Interlakan Seedless: A sister of

Himrod, the plant is similar, but more
productive. It is hardy to -15°F, vigor-
ous, and disease resistant.

h. Reliance: The Reliance produces a fine
quality, seedless grape that is pinkish-
red in color and has an excellent
sweet, fruity flavor. This variety is dis-
ease resistant and hardy to -34°F.

i. Van Buren: An American Concord,
this sweet table grape is hardy to -
20°F.

j. Worden: Another American Concord,
except larger and darker, this variety is
good for juice and jelly and good
served fresh. Worden is disease resis-
tant and hardy to -50°F.

C. Culture

1. Planting

a. Plants: Many plants are produced from

dormant cuttings. Some cultivars are
budded or grafted onto disease, insect,
and nematode resistant rootstocks.
Rootstocks can modify vigor (increase
or decrease) and provide tolerance to a
wide range of soil conditions.

b. Soil: Grapes require a deep, well-

drained soil for their extensive root
system. Highest yields are on sandy
loams. Grapes worldwide are planted
on an extreme range of soil types.

Rootstock may be necessary to tolerate
some soils.

c. Spacing: Depends on the vigor of cul-
tivar, soil, and training system used: 8
feet for American grapes and 6 feet on
poor soils (sandy or gravelly) and 9
feet plus for vigorous European
grapes.

d. Orientation: Maximize sunlight; plant

on a south-facing slope; place rows
north to south.

2. Irrigation—Required for most sites in

Idaho.

3. Fertilization

a. General: Nitrogen fertilizers are detri-
mental to a fruit set. Most vines have
over-vigor problems. Only very old or
stressed vines may require nitrogen
boost.

b. Potassium and phosphorus: Needs are

low. See Subsection D, “Common
Plant Problems: Diagnosis and Con-
trol.”

c. Micronutrient: Boron deficiencies are
common. See Subsection D on com-
mon plant problems.

4. Training and pruning

a. Types

i. Cordon or spur pruned (Fig. 4):
Permanent canes or cordons are
trained on a wire 40 to 45 inches
from ground. Spurs are established
along a cordon which bear fruiting
canes each year. A second wire,
placed at a height of 5 feet, is used
to tie up fruiting canes in
midseason.

ii. Cane-renewal system or Kniffen

training (Fig. 5): Probably the best
system for the homeowner in
Idaho. A strong trunk is developed
up to the second wire with spurs
established at the trunk near the
wires. Two canes with 10 to 12
buds are left as fruiting wood on
wires; two to four spurs are left on
the base of the cane to grow re-
newal wood.

i. Winter: Prune the grapevines dur-

ing the dormant season before
March. Root pressure builds in the
spring and that leads to “bleeding”
of water from plants. This has little
harmful effect on plants, but it is
best to avoid this period.

ii. Summer: Vigorous vines require
summer maintenance. Yearly re-
moval of suckers from the base of
the plant or on the trunk below the
first wire is needed.

iii. Pinching or heading back: The cur-

rent season’s canes will top the
wire and flop into the row. Head
back to keep plant upright and to
prevent shading of clusters.

iv. Leaf removal: On late season

grapes, remove leaves near clusters
to provide air circulation and to
lessen the chances for the develop-
ment of bunch rot. Normally detri-
mental to overall vine vigor due to
low sunlight.

ommended American grape variet-
ies are resistant.

b. Botrytis mold: “Noble rot” for produc-
ing a late harvest, sweet wine on many
white wine varieties. Not desirable
most of the time.
i. Symptoms: Early infections cause

spotting on leaves, or infection
sites on cluster stems. Bunch rot
also occurs during the late season

rooflike position when at rest. They
cause leaf injury and secrete hon-
eydew.

a. 2,4-D injury: Grapes are very suscep-
tible to damage by 2,4-D. It has been
known to drift for miles and to affect
plants.
i. Symptoms: Terminal growth can
be misshapen; venation becomes
parallel and fan-shaped; young
leaves are thickened and distorted.
ii. Control: Avoid 2,4-D use around

grapes. Wait for plants to grow out
of problem.

b. Boron deficiency

i. Symptoms: There will be a light
set of fruit, while the flower clus-
ters will be affected with a “burn-
ing off.” Terminal shoots may die
in early summer, or show leaf chlo-
rosis. Some European grapes are
particularly affected.

ii. Control: Soil or leaf analysis is rec-

ommended and foliar sprays of
soluble boron should be applied to
correct the deficiency.

c. Potassium deficiency

i. Symptoms: Chlorosis of outer mar-

gins of leaves will leave a dark
green area (Christmas tree effect)
in the center of leaf and brown
spots on the margins.

ii. Control: Apply potassium.

Houseplants and
Home Greenhouses

J. A. Robbins

JoAnn Robbins, Extension Educator, Jerome County, Jerome

Houseplant—Any plant grown indoors, typically in
a container. There are three groups of houseplants:
foliage, flowering, and cactus and succulents.

I. Environmental Conditions and

Requirements
A. Plant Needs

Understanding plant needs and existing con-
ditions helps you to be successful with
houseplants. All plants don’t have the same
needs, and average home conditions are ba-
sically inhospitable for plants. Normally,
conditions are minimally appropriate for a
few species. For success you have to be se-
lective and manipulate the environment.

B. Light

1. Lack of light is the major constraint to

indoor plant growth.

2. Light intensity refers to the amount of
light available at a particular site. It is
measured in foot-candles or lux (1 foot-
candle = 10.7 lux).
a. 50 to 75 foot-candles (fc) are the mini-

mum necessary for plant growth.

b. Light is reduced by the reciprocal of

the square of the distance from the
measured source. In other words, light
levels diminish rapidly as you move
away from the window or the lighting
fixture. For instance, if you measure
the intensity of light 1 foot from a win-
dow at 100 fc the following applies:
i.
ii. 2 feet from window = 100/22 = 25 fc.
iii. 3 feet from window = 100/32 = 11 fc.

1 foot from window = 100 fc.

c. An easy way to measure light is with a

35mm camera with a built-in light
meter. Set ASA = 100, aperture to f4.
Take reading of a white paper or board
filling the camera’s viewfinder. Light
intensity is reciprocal of appropriate
shutter speed (e.g., 1/100 = 100 fc).
Hand held light meters designed for
photography will accomplish the same
task.

3. At low light levels, most common

houseplants are classified as long term
perishable and should be replaced every
2 years or so.

4. Increasing light

a. Move your plants to a sunnier window
with less overhang, less shading from
trees, and a southern exposure.

b. Move your plants closer to the win-

dow.

c. Provide reflected light to plants by us-

ing white walls and mirrors.

d. Provide artificial light (see section
“VIII-h” on greenhouse lighting).
i. Fluorescent bulbs provide low in-

tensity light. For example a 40 watt
bulb at a distance of 2 feet only
provides 50 fc of light.
Incandescent lights are also low
intensity. A 60 watt bulb at a distance
of 2 feet provides 17 fc of light.

ii.

iii. High intensity lights such as mer-
cury vapor, sodium, and metallic
halide provide significantly higher
levels of light intensity.

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 2

iv. Most non-flowering foliage

houseplants benefit from receiving
light 12 to 16 hours/day.
5. Symptoms of light anomalies.

a. Low light: Plants not receiving enough
light become weak, spindly, and have
long distances between nodes. Leaves
turn yellow and drop, usually begin-
ning from the bottom of the plant.
Growth ceases. Variegated plants re-
vert to solid green.

b. High light: Plants receiving too much
light have leaves that are light colored.
The old leaves curl under and develop
brown scorched spots or margins. New
leaves are thickened.

C. Temperature

1. Most indoor plants are of tropical origin
and do not do well in cold temperatures.
a. Most plants will tolerate a fairly broad

range (55° to 85°F).

b. Plants prefer 75°F days and 65°F

nights (in general, 10 degrees cooler at
night than in day).

2. The direction the window faces affects

temperature. South and west facing
windows receive more sun, so tend to
be warmer than east and north facing
windows.

3. Plants lose heat, or radiate, to anything

colder. Place sheets of newspaper be-
tween plants and windowpanes on
frosty nights to avoid cold damage to
houseplants.

4. Symptoms of temperature anomalies.

a. High temperatures: If a houseplant

is receiving too much heat the
leaves will turn yellow, wilt, drop,
or scorch.

b. Low temperatures: If temperatures

are too low, leaves will curl up,
turn brown, and drop off.

D. Humidity

1. Most houseplants prefer a high relative
humidity. However, many will adapt to
low levels of humidity.

2. Heating systems differ in drying air. Nor-
mal humidity inside buildings (especially

in winter) is much lower than the lowest
range tolerable for good plant growth.

3. Methods to raise humidity.

a. Group your houseplants together to

use the water vapor created by transpi-
ration of other plants to increase the
humidity level.

b. A gravel tray beneath the houseplant

pot filled with water will provide extra
humidity as the water evaporates. Be
sure that the base of the pot sits on the
top of the gravel and does not touch
the water.

c. Humidity can be increased around a
houseplant by misting. However, the
effect is very short in duration and
must be repeated frequently for any
beneficial effect.

d. Place plants in areas of high humidity,

such as the kitchen or bathroom.

e. Provide a double pot for your

houseplants. Place moist sphagnum
moss between the inner and outer pots
to provide extra humidity.

f. Increase the humidity level in the en-

tire room with a humidifier.

4. Methods to lower humidity.

a. Ventilate the area around the

houseplant by opening doors and win-
dows and by using fans and air condi-
tioners.

b. Be sure not to over water plants or

have water standing in trays beneath
pots for any length of time.

5. Symptoms of humidity anomalies.

a. Low humidity: Plants growing under
low humidity may develop brown leaf
tips and yellow leaf margins. The plant
may have stunted growth, or none at
all, and will display signs of bud and
leaf drop, shriveling, and wilting.

b. Excessive humidity: Too much humid-

ity will cause the plant to decay and
rot. Its leaves and stems will darken,
be susceptible to bacterial and fungal
invasions, and show soft wilt.

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 3

E. Irrigation

Irrigation is the most important and most
abused cultural practice with houseplants.
Water relations are much more critical for
potted plants because of their limited root
space and the necessity for soil aeration.
1. Water requirements vary by plant species
from constantly moist to mostly dry. You
need to know individual plant require-
ments, which can be learned by consult-
ing a reliable reference.

2. Water use is dependent upon a number of

factors.
a. Ratio of foliage to pot size: A large
plant in a small pot may need to be
watered daily due to the large amount
of water lost and the small soil reservoir.
b. Potting media: Sandy potting soil will
hold less water than soil with peat or
other organic matter. Plants in a sandy
mix will need to be watered more often.
c. Temperature: If temperatures are high,
houseplants transpire freely, and water
will evaporate rapidly from the soil
surface. Plants in warm conditions will
need to be watered more often.

d. Humidity: Plants in dry air will tran-

spire more and will need watering
more often than those in moist air.
e. Air movements: Plants located in a

breeze will transpire more and will re-
quire more water.

f. Light: Plants that are photosynthesiz-
ing will be exchanging gasses through
open stomates and will allow transpi-
ration to occur. Plants in brighter light
areas, therefore, will require more wa-
ter than those in dimly lit areas.

g. Plant species: Some plants simply

need more water to grow and be
healthy than others.

h. Container porosity: Clay and unglazed

ceramic pots “breathe” and will lose
water more quickly than glass, glazed
ceramic, or plastic pots, so plants in
clay and unglazed ceramic pots will
need more water.

3. Water quality varies, particularly in the

amount of soluble salts present. Well wa-

ter in Idaho is often “hard.” Many soften-
ing processes replace the calcium in the
water with sodium that is damaging to
houseplants; thus, be sure to water
houseplants with water that has not been
softened by this method. The amount of
chlorine found in city water systems gen-
erally is not sufficient to cause problems
with houseplants. Alkaline water makes
growing acid-loving plants such as aza-
leas and gardenias difficult. Generous use
of acidic peat moss and acid-reacting fer-
tilizers will help offset the alkaline con-
tent in the water.

4. All containers should have drainage.

Lack of drainage saturates the soil and
excludes air from the roots. This condi-
tion leads to root rot.

5. Water temperature is important. Many

houseplants are tropical, and adding cold
water to their roots can harm them. Afri-
can violet and other gesneriad leaves will
be bleached by cold water. To avoid
problems, water your houseplants with
barely warm or tepid water.

6. Methods to determine the relative amount
of water in a pot include checking with a
finger one inch or so below soil surface
for moistness, comparing the “heft” or
weight of the pot, or tapping the side of
the pot and listening for a hollow sound.
The main thing is to check plants regularly.

Note: Inexpensive moisture meters actually
measure conductivity (salinity) of the
soil and are not reliable.

7. The amount of water held and available

is dependent upon media ingredients.
Peat moss, field soil, and vermiculite
hold the most. Sand, perlite, and pumice
hold the least.

8 Symptoms of water-related anomalies.
a. Not enough water: Foliage of broad-
leaved plants darkens and turns crisp;
the lower leaves will drop, and plants
gradually wilt. The leaves and stems of
succulent plants turn pale and shrivel.
b. Too much water (or insufficient drain-

age): Leaves curl, wilt, blacken, and

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 4

drop. Corky scabs or protrusions form
on the undersides of leaves or on
branches. The leaves and stems be-
come soft and the roots rot.

F. Fertilization

1. Nutrients needed for plant growth are

generally obtained from “real soil” that
your potting mix does not usually contain.

2. There is a limited supply available to

houseplants because of the finite size of
the pot. Also, the potting soil is usually
“artificial” mix that contains little to no
nutrients.

3. The best method is to provide a constant
supply of nutrients at relatively low levels.
a. Nutrients will be particularly impor-

tant during periods of growth.

b. Don’t over fertilize. You will get lanky

growth, fertilizer burn, and the possi-
bility of root damage.

c. During the winter months, when home

temperatures are apt to be cooler and
days are short, decrease or eliminate
fertilization to give plants a short rest
of 2 to 3 months.

4. There are many types of fertilizers. It is
best to use a complete fertilizer that pro-
vides nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
and micronutrients such as iron.
a. No one type of fertilizer is better than

the others. Slow-release granules let
out a little fertilizer at each watering.
Dry fertilizers or fertilizers that dis-
solve in water can be applied.

b. Organic forms such as fish emulsion
will provide micronutrients and low
amounts of nitrogen. Fertilizer burn is
less likely with an organic source.
5. It is best to fertilize with soluble inor-

ganic fertilizers when the soil is already
wet. This way there is less of an uptake
shock and, subsequently, less possibility
of root damage and/or fertilizer burn.
6. Fertilizer is not a cure-all; it will not

make a sick plant healthy. In fact, fertiliz-
ing a plant with disease or other stress
and, hence, forcing growth may be the
final stress that kills it.

7. Nutritional deficiencies

a. Macronutrients

i. Nitrogen (N): Lack of N results in
a stunted plant with yellow leaves;
older leaves fade first, then turn
brown and die.

ii. Phosphorus (P): Lack of P results
in retarded growth. The plant re-
mains a deep green leaf color until
it turns purple or bronze (or
mottled in light and dark tones).
The symptoms are apparent in
older leaves. Another symptom is
retarded flowering.

iii. Potassium (K): Lack of K creates

tip and marginal burn on lower
leaves. These burns advance up the
plant. The leaves crinkle and turn
inward, and the plant stops growing.

b. Micronutrients

i. Deficiencies in anything more than
N, P, K, or iron are unusual. If the
addition of a balanced fertilizer
doesn’t cure deficient symptoms,
repot plant in new soil and resume
a regular fertilizer schedule.
Iron (Fe): Leaves turn yellow,
while veins remain green. The
plant will have stunted growth and
curled leaves.

ii.

iii. Excess chlorine (Cl): Too much

chlorine causes thickened leaf tis-
sue, which becomes brittle. Great
excesses of Cl burn and destroy
plant roots.

G. Salt Damage

Salt damage is a common problem in house
plants, and steps must be taken to avoid it in
order to have healthy plants.
1. Salt build up is indicated by a crusty
white substance coating the top of the
soil or the rim of the pot.

2. Salt build up is caused by repeated fertil-

izing, giving plants too little water at a
time, high salt concentrations in tap wa-
ter, and poor drainage in pots.

3. The symptoms of salt damage are easy to

spot.

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 5

a. Plants will not grow well.
b. Leaf tip and marginal leaf burn are

evident. Roots are burned and deterio-
rated. You may also see thick, dwarfed
leaves with sunken breathing pores on
leaf undersides.

4. To avoid salt build up in pots:

a. Do not water houseplants with water

softened by sodium salts

b. Water plants with distilled water; it

contains no salts or minerals.

c. Flush excess salts out of pots periodi-

cally (monthly) by watering heavily
and repeatedly until water pours out of
the drainage holes.

d. Repot plant in new soil and new pot.
e. Wash old pots well before reusing for
houseplants. Soak clay pots in several
changes of clean water to flush out
salts absorbed by the clay.

H. Overall Environmental Factors Affecting

Plant Growth
1. Plants are living things. The keys to
healthy houseplants are to minimize
stress and provide a favorable environ-
ment with minimal variation.

2. Don’t overcorrect. Don’t make up for

underwatering with overwatering. Don’t
make up for lack of light by placing plant
in direct sun. Shocks like this will not
benefit growth.

II. Media, Containers, and Potting

A. Root Media

1. Because of the physical limitations of the

container, houseplants need specialized
media. Do not use straight field soil. It
lacks correct physical properties. It is best
to buy a potting mix from a garden center.

2. There are some important properties to con-

sider when choosing a container media.
a. Roots need air to grow, so the percent-

age of air-filled space for houseplant
soil needs to be 10 percent or more.

b. Container media needs to hold enough
water to supply what the plant needs.
Pure sand makes a poor container me-
dia, as the soil must hold water equal
to 40 percent of volume or more.

c. Container media needs to be able to

hold nutrients (have a high cation ex-
change capacity). Organic matter will
help increase nutrient-holding capacity.

d. The pH (acid balance) of the soil needs
to be favorable for houseplant growth.
A pH range of 5.5 to 6.5 is best.

e. Container media must be free of dis-

eases and toxic substances.

B. Container Choice

1. No one container material is better than
another, but each container type requires
different management. All containers re-
quire drainage holes at the bottom.

2. Basic container materials.

a. Clay pots are attractive, and plants

grow well in them because they
breathe and allow air exchange
through their walls. As a result, they
will dry out faster than other types of
pots, and plants will require more fre-
quent watering. They also tend to ac-
cumulate salts in their walls because of
the evaporation. These can be flushed
out of empty pots by soaking them in
several changes of clean water.

b. Plastic pots are readily available and
come in colors to complement your
decor. They are impervious to water,
and their walls do not breathe. Because
of this, soil aeration of the media is
particularly important. The soil will
also hold the water longer, so less fre-
quent watering will be necessary.

c. Fiber pots are inexpensive and rustic
looking. They are porous and allow a
limited amount of air and water ex-
change. The bottoms of these pots tend
to break down and fall apart over time.

d. Wooden pots are attractive but they
tend to leak out of the cracks if not
lined with a plastic interior. When
lined, they essentially become a plastic
container.

3. When using saucers, it’s best to lift the
pot above the saucer so that after irriga-
tion the pot doesn’t sit in drained water.
If it does sit in water, be sure the water is
all taken up within an hour or two. Sitting

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 6

in water for days at a time will cause the
soil to be saturated, which will eventually
kill a plant. Decorative containers that
hold the entire pot (jardinieres) can be
used and should be treated just like saucers.
4. When reusing containers, be sure to clean

them well to reduce any carryover of in-
sects or diseases found in plant parts or
old soil clinging to the plants. Soaking
clay pots in fresh water for several days
will leach out any accumulated salts.
Scrub other pots with a stiff brush and
detergent, and rinse in a solution of bleach.

C. Repotting Houseplants

1. There should be a balance between top
growth and container size. Too small a
container will cause rapid water loss, and
too large a container will keep the soil
saturated and lead to root problems.

2. When potting, cover the drainage hole

with old nylon stocking or pottery shard
to minimize soil loss when irrigating. Do
not use gravel in the bottom as it only re-
duces the effective pot size and does not
help drainage.
a. Do not press or tamp soil firmly in

pots as this reduces aeration. Rather,
tap the filled pot on a table to settle
soil and remove air pockets.

b. Leave a 1-inch head space at the top of

pots for irrigation.

c. Media containing peat moss that has
gotten bone dry may need to have the
moisture kneaded in before using it for
potting. If this isn’t done, penetration
of the water in the repotted plant will
be extremely slow until the peat ab-
sorbs the water. In the meantime the
roots are completely dry.

d. Water immediately after potting. It’s

best to irrigate two times to be sure
soil is settled well around the roots and
that the media is completely wetted.

3. Repot if compacted or salt-filled soil,
poor drainage, soilborne insects, inad-
equate nutrition, and crowded roots.
a. Move up only one pot size at a time. A
general rule is to make the internal size
of the container about 1 inch larger all
around than the old pot.

b. Replant the plant at the same level on

the stem as in an old container.

c. How often to repot depends upon the
plant’s rate of growth, root condition,
and media characteristics.

4. Terrariums typically have no drainage, so

use activated charcoal at the bottom of
the container and water less.

III. Controlling Size and Shape

A. Phototropism

Houseplants orient their leaves toward a
fixed light source. To keep a balanced
shape, rotate plants frequently.

B. Pinch

Frequently remove terminal growth such as
vines and branching plants to keep them
bushy and within bounds.

IV. Diagnosis of Problems

A. Be Observant

1. In diagnosis the most difficult task is not

to jump to conclusions. Don’t be abso-
lute, even though the problem seems ob-
vious. This is particularly true if you are
being guided by a description of a prob-
lem without actually seeing the plant.

2. Ninety-five percent of all problems with
houseplants have to do with light, water,
humidity, and fertilization. Frequently,
the problem is a combination of these
factors. Diseases are usually a result of
some environmental stress.

3. Be methodical in your questioning. Ask
step-by-step questions about plant care
and conditions.

4. Learn to ask questions the right way. Not,

“Are you watering correctly?” Rather,
“How often do you water?” Get a quanti-
tative answer that will help you decide if
the watering is correct.

5. Look at the roots of the plant. Roots

should be healthy and growing.

6. Symptoms overlap so brown tips on the
ends or edges of leaves are symptomatic
of several problems. It is up to you to fer-
ret out what is causing them.

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

V. Insect Pests

Watch for insects when you introduce new
plants to a home. Most insects are brought in
with new plants and plants that have been out-
side in the summer. They also hitchhike in on
pots, equipment, and your clothes, shoes, and
person.
Pests have preferences for certain plant spe-
cies. Thus, some plants are more prone to in-
sect problems.
A. Major Insect Pests

1. Aphids—These are soft bodied, small

round insects that mass around growing
tips and tender tissue. Aphids suck plant
juices. Their invasion causes deformed
and curled new leaves, buds, and flowers.
Some carry virus diseases and some spe-
cies cause galls. They all secrete honey-
dew, and this is sometimes the first
symptom noticed. The honeydew attracts
ants who feed on it.

2. White fly—This small white winged fly

congregates on undersides of leaves.
Small immature crawlers, or larvae, suck
sap and secrete honeydew. Adults fly up
in a random pattern when disturbed and
resettle to the plant surface quickly.

3. Scale—These are small, hard, immobile,
disk-like insects. Scales suck plant juices.
Their presence causes leaves to develop
yellow spots, turn yellow, and drop off.
They also have a crawler stage that
moves about until it matures. This
crawler becomes the disk-like immobile
adult that is obvious.

4. Mealy bugs—Mealy bugs are scale in-

sects that are covered with layers of
white waxy substance. Mealy bugs look
like little cotton pieces. They suck sap,
resulting in stunted growth, wilting, defo-
liation, and eventual plant death. They
also secrete honeydew.

5. Spider mites—Spider mites are tiny,

eight-legged arachnids that proliferate
rapidly in hot dry growing environments.
They suck sap, causing pale blotches,
loss of color, and dry, rusty leaf textures.
The leaves tend to turn gray, yellow, or to
be smothered in fine, mealy cobwebs be-

fore dropping off. They can be seen, al-
though they look like moving dust unless
viewed with a magnifying lens. They
most often congregate on the undersides
of leaves.

6. Cyclamen mites—These microscopic vo-

racious feeders cause distorted, blotchy
bloom; stunted, twisted, or shriveled
stems; and leaves with stunted and com-
pact plant centers. Their presence is often
followed by the dropping off of flower
buds and streaky, purplish foliage. These
mites are difficult to eradicate. As their
name implies they are a particular prob-
lem in cyclamen, but also affect other
houseplants.

7. Leafminers—The larvae of fly, moth,

sawfly, or beetle leafminers eat leaf tis-
sue between the upper and lower leaf sur-
faces causing slender, winding trails, tun-
nels, and blisters on leaves.

8. Fungus gnats—Light attracts these tiny
black flies. The flies zig and zag in ir-
regular flight when disturbed before set-
tling back down on the soil surface. The
eggs of fungus gnats hatch into threadlike
white maggots that burrow through the
soil, embed themselves in root tissue, and
eat small feeding roots, root hairs, and
crowns of plants. The plants suffer from
root rot, slow weak top growth, and yel-
lowing leaves. Root feeding produces
wounds that can permit entry of disease
organisms.
B. Insect Control

1. It is essential to quarantine all new plants

introduced into your home until you are
sure they are pest free.

2. Several effective nonchemical insect con-

trol methods are available.
a. Water: Keep all plant leaves clean by
washing or spraying with water. This
is especially good for control of
aphids. Putting the plant in the bathtub
to give its leaves this shower works
well.

b. Soapy water (use specially formulated

insecticidal soaps): Sponge or spray
onto leaves. This works well on spider
mites and aphids.

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 8

c. Rubbing or denatured ethyl alcohol:

Use alcohol on a cotton ball, tissue, or
swab to remove insects such as scale
and mealy bugs. This works well on
large, stiff leaves. Be sure to test first
to make sure the alcohol will not dam-
age the leaves, especially on soft, thin,
and fragile leaves. This is not practical
on something with tiny leaves, and you
must be sure to repeat often for com-
plete control.

d. Yellow sticky boards: Insects are at-
tracted to the yellow surface and be-
come tangled in the sticky goo on the
surface. These are best used early
when infestations of flying insects are
low. This is a good technique for white
fly control.

e. Predators: These can be insects, nema-
todes, or mites. Some of these are very
specific. They are effective in reducing
pests, but may be difficult to keep on
the plant and to maintain.

f. Replacement: If pest population is too
high or complete control seems impos-
sible, discard the plant and buy a new
one.

3. Chemical controls for insects are available.
a. Use caution when using chemical in-
secticides. Read the label thoroughly
and follow instructions carefully. Not
only are excessive rates or unlabeled
applications unhealthy for you, but
they may cause plant damage or
phytoxicity.

b. Use different chemicals for different

problems or when one type stops
working.

c. Be sure to use the chemical that will

control the pest you have.

d. Understand the life cycles of pests and
susceptible stages. If you must repeat
applications, follow the timing pre-
cisely.

e. Some pests have developed a resis-

tance to certain pesticides. If one is not
effective, try another from a different
chemical group. Do not increase dos-
age.

VI. Plant Diseases

Diseases usually occur in plants that are
stressed by unfavorable environmental condi-
tions. The most common stresses are high or
low temperatures, overwatering, low light,
overfertilizing, open wounds, air pollution, and
excessive humidity.
Parasitic organisms, bacteria, or fungi can
cause disease in houseplants.
A. Common Diseases

1. Anthracnose—This fungus is character-

ized by depressed leafy spots with dry
centers. The entire end of the leaf may
turn dark tan with darker bars crisscross-
ing the leaf.

2. Crown and stem rot—These fungal dis-
eases cause stems and bases of affected
plants to turn soft and mushy to the
touch.

3. Damping-off—This disease is caused by
a soilborne fungus that attacks the lower
portion of the seedling stems, which then
collapses. The leaves turn inward and
look pinched. The seedling wilts and
dies.

4. Leaf spot—This disease creates yellow-
margined spots with dark brown or black
damp or blistered centers. Bacterial or
fungal invasions cause leaf spot.

5. Mildews and molds—Black sooty mold
on leaves appears as black coating and
can be associated with honeydew se-
creted by aphids, mealybugs, and scale.
A white or grayish felt-like coating on
foliage is mildew. It causes leaves to curl
and shrivel. A gray or white mold on the
soil surface can be fungus caused.

6. Root rot—Root rot invades roots and di-

minishes roots’ ability to absorb water.
This rot is fungus-caused. It damages
new growth, which dies back. The entire
plant eventually wilts and dies.

B. Disease Control

1. Correct the environmental conditions that
are allowing the disease to thrive. For in-
stance many rots thrive in excess water.
Treatment is to lower the humidity and
cut down on watering.

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 9

2. Pick off and destroy infected leaves and
plant parts. Repot or replant in new media.

3. Apply fungicidal dusts or drenches as
recommended, following label instruc-
tions for the specific disease.

VII. Propagation

A. Clone

Vegetative or asexual propagation produces
a clone of the plant that you propagate from.
1. This is the most common commercial

technique. It is fast and ensures genetic
consistency. It is also easy to do.

2. Propagate by using cuttings from the

stem, leaf, offsets, or stolons.

3. Air layering can be done with many

plants by scoring the stem, wrapping with
damp sphagnum moss, and enclosing in a
plastic covering secured above and below
by a loose tie.

4. Factors to consider when propagating

houseplants:
a. Be sure to start with vigorous, healthy

plants.

b. Use sterile, well-aerated rooting me-
dia. Most packaged mixes are steril-
ized before packaging. Peat mixed
with either perlite or vermiculite
makes a good rooting media.

c. Pieces of plants cannot be under water

stress while roots are forming. To
maintain a good water balance, re-
move part of leaves on large-leafed
plants, and raise humidity with enclo-
sure or mist.

d. Cuttings and newly rooted plants need
light for photosynthesis. However, cut-
tings should not be in direct light un-
less they are under an automatic mist
system. Newly rooted plants should be
eased into high light situations gradu-
ally.

e. Bottom heat (heat at root zone) helps
plants to root. A temperature of 70° to
75°F with an air temperature of 60° to
65°F is ideal. Use a heating cable or
mat to provide bottom heat.

f. Use rooting hormones to stimulate root

initiation and growth. These are ap-

plied as a dry powder or a solution in
which the cutting is dipped.

g. When placing cuttings in media, be
careful not to wipe off the hormone.

h. When roots have grown on cuttings to
where they are large enough to support
the cutting, transplant quickly since
there is less transplant shock for small
root systems.

B. Uniqueness

Seed or sexual propagation may produce an
individual similar to the mother plant. With
cross pollination, however, variation will
occur, and the resulting seedlings will all be
unique individuals.
1. With seed propagation you can produce

more plants. Plant breeders use this
method to produce new varieties using
the variation produced by seedling varia-
tion.

2. Some seeds need a presowing treatment

to break dormancy.
a. Stratification, or a moist cold treat-

ment, is needed for some.

b. Scarification, or scratching or breaking

down the seed coat, is needed for
some.

3. Seeds from different species of plants

have different light and temperature re-
quirements.

4. Be sure to use sterile media to avoid seed

rot and damping-off of seedlings.

5. Transplant seedlings when they become
crowded. Be sure to lift plants by a leaf,
not by the tender stem or growing tip.

VIII. Greenhouses

A home greenhouse is a satisfying addition for
the home gardener. Many plants will grow in
greenhouses including annual bedding plants,
forced bulbs, cacti and succulents, geraniums,
gloxinia, orchids, and tropical foliage plants.
You can grow vegetables and fruits such as
cucumbers, eggplant, lettuce, onions, peppers,
radishes, strawberries, and tomatoes in a
greenhouse.
The various plants require different tempera-
tures and light conditions, so the size of the
greenhouse and its cooling and heating equip-

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 10

ment may restrict the greenhouse grower to
certain plants. Providing proper growing con-
ditions is essential for successful greenhouse
gardening.
A. Types of Greenhouses

1. Attached lean-to—Built against a build-
ing, this greenhouse uses the building’s
walls for one or more of its sides. Usu-
ally, the width is limited to a total of 7 to
12 feet.

2. Attached even-span—Similar to a free-
standing structure, this greenhouse is at-
tached at one gable end to a house or
other structure. They are larger and more
flexible than the lean-to type.

3. Attached window-mounted—This reach-
in unit replaces a window and is ideal for
growing a few plants at low cost for heat-
ing and cooling.

4. Free-standing—Set apart to get the most

sun, this type of greenhouse can be as
large or small as desired. With many
shapes or frame types available, this type
of greenhouse is the most costly to build
and maintain.

B. Location and Orientation

1. Light—Get the most light by placing the

attached greenhouse on the south or
southeast side of the structure. The east
side is the second best location followed
by southwest and west. A north exposure
is the least desirable. Locate free-stand-
ing greenhouses where large trees, other
buildings, and obstructions will not shade
them.

2. Shelter—Locate small greenhouses in a

sheltered area to reduce wind-related heat
losses. A windbreak or building located
far enough away so as to not shade the
greenhouse will provide shelter. Choose a
site that has access to electricity, water,
and an energy source for heat.

3. Orientation—Once you have selected a
site, orient the greenhouse to make the
most of the available light. An east-west
orientation (with the ridge of the house
running east and west) is preferable, es-
pecially during the winter when light is
most critical.

C. Design and Construction

1. Shapes—Many styles of greenhouses are
possible, such as Quonset, dome, gothic
arch, A-frame, slant-leg, gable roof, and
tripenta. Plans, kits, or finished houses
are available from a variety of sources.

2. Frames

a. Wood: Wood contributes to uniform

greenhouse temperature because it
does not cool down quickly. Use a
wood resistant to decay, pressure
treated, or treated with non-toxic wa-
ter-borne, salt-type preservative.

b. Steel: Provides a more solid structure
than wood and lets more light into the
greenhouse. You must paint steel
frames to prevent rust.

c. Aluminum alloy: Lightweight and

strong, aluminum frames offer a high
degree of light reflectiveness and re-
quire little maintenance. They transmit
heat readily, resulting in greater heat
loss.

d. Plastic: Light, strong, and readily
available, plastic (especially PVC
pipe) is good for hoop-house construc-
tion.

3. Covering materials

a. Glass: Use extra strength or tempered
glass. Attractive, permanent, and ex-
pensive, it requires periodic
recaulking. Leave construction to a
manufacturer because glass is difficult
to fabricate. A single layer has 90 per-
cent light transmission.

b. Plastics

i. Rigid plastic: Resists breakage, is

lightweight, and easy to install.
Most degrade under sunlight.

ii. Polyvinylchloride (PVC): Avail-
able in UV-treated form, PVC al-
lows 88 to 90 percent light trans-
mission. It is flexible, comes corru-
gated or flat, and lasts 2 to 7 years.

iii. Clear acrylic (Plexiglas, Perspex,

Transpex, and Lucite): Half as
heavy as glass, acrylic plastics re-
sist impact and are flexible but ex-
pensive. All but Lucite scratches.

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 11

Most types are available in double-
walled panels that will last 20 years
and allow 90 to 95 percent light
transmission.

iv. Polycarbonate: More flexible and
less expensive than acrylic, poly-
carbonate plastic yellows and loses
transparency with age.

v. Film plastic: Inexpensive, but tem-

porary, film plastic requires more
maintenance. Ultraviolet (UV) ra-
diation will destroy it if not treated
with a UV inhibitor. Use double
layer to reduce heat loss.

c. Polyethylene

i. Regular polyethylene: Not recom-

mended because of its short life
span (9 to 12 months). Stronger
with increasing thickness, it usually
splits on the fold. Allows 85 to 88
percent light transmission.

ii. UV-treated polyethylene: Lasts 1 to

2 years. Use 4 to 6 mil thickness.
Keep clean to increase winter light;
85 to 88 percent light transmission.
iii. Co-polymer films (Monsanto 602):
An ethylene and vinyl acetate, co-
polymer films are stronger with a
life of 2 years. Keep clean for an
85 to 88 percent light transmission.
iv. Reinforced polyethylene: Contains
glass or acrylic fiber for additional
strength and a 2-year life span.
Keep clean for an 85 percent trans-
mission.

v. Reinforced UV-treated polyethyl-
ene: Has similar characteristics to
reinforced polyethylene.

vi. Vinyl films: Thicker (8 ml) types
are hazy. Keep clean because they
attract smog and dirt. This tears
easily when punctured and will last
for about 2 to 5 years. Allows 89 to
91 percent light transmission.
vii. Polyvinyl floride films (Tedlar

PVF and Teflon FEP): An expen-
sive type of film plastic that lasts 7
to 8 years with 92 percent light
transmission.

d. Polyester

i. Polyester films (Molar, Melinex,

and Llumar): This stiff plastic film
tears easily when punctured and
degrades rapidly in the sun.

ii. Acrylic laminated to polyester

(Flexigard): Reduced UV radiation
breakdown and tearing gives this
type of plastic a moderately long
life.

e. Fiberglass

i. Durable, attractive, and moderately
priced, fiberglass is more resistant
to impact than glass and much
lighter.

ii. Use UV-treated fiberglass because

the untreated types will yellow
with age. If not treated with UV-
resistant materials, the fibers be-
come exposed or “fray.” Low
maintenance, fiberglass lasts for a
year untreated and 15 to 20 years if
UV treated.

iii. With a 75 to 90 percent light trans-

mission, fiberglass is not recom-
mended for plants with high light
requirements in areas with less than
40 percent sunny days in the winter.

iv. Fiberglass comes corrugated or

flat. It is flammable. Buy only clear
(not colored) types of high grade
fiberglass.

4. Benches

a. Side benches: Because you access side

benches from only one side, they
should be no wider than what you can
reach across (generally 2 to 3 feet).
Leave about 6 inches between the
benches and the side walls for air-cir-
culation.

b. Center benches: Because you access
center benches from both sides, they
can be as wide as 6 feet. Small green-
houses may have room only for side
benches.

c. Other types: Beds, shelves, and imagi-
native types of benches are all possible
in a greenhouse. Tailor them to your
needs and plant requirements.

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 12

5. Walkways and flooring

a. Walkways should be easy on the feet,

well drained, and non-slippery.

b. Use pea gravel, ready-mix concrete,
porous concrete, treated wood, brick
on a sand bed, porous aggregate, or
stepping stones in any combination for
walkways and flooring.

6. Heating

a. Heating capacity will depend on size
of greenhouse, the type of covering,
and the coldness of the external tem-
perature and wind relative to the de-
sired inside temperature. Attached
greenhouses often can use the home
heat source for warmth.
i. Conventional: You can use coal,

electricity, gas, or oil heat sources.
You can use these sources to heat
the air directly in a forced air sys-
tem or to heat water for a hot water
or steam system. Use an approved
flue to vent gas, oil, and coal. Elec-
tricity is often too expensive to use.

ii. Solar: By capturing the sun’s heat
in water, stone, concrete, or similar
heat-absorbing material, you can
heat your greenhouse via radiation
during non-sunny periods. You
should combine solar heat with
other methods such as double
walls, covers, and blankets to mini-
mize heat loss from the greenhouse.

iii. Blankets and shutters: Movable

blankets and shutters can serve as
nighttime insulation. They are only
as effective as the operator who
must faithfully open and close
them. You can make these interior
insulating systems from black or
clear polyethylene film, aluminized
fabric, PVC laminate, spun-bonded
polyester, foam-backed fiberglass
drapery material, woven and lofted
polyester, or clear plastic bubble
wrap. Fit them on tracks, rollers, or
slides or secure with hooks.
Shutters are foam insulation boards
that you cut to fit between wall
studs and ceiling rafters. Foam with

aluminum foil facing is even more
effective. Wood turn knobs or mag-
netic clips will hold the panels in
place. They are more effective than
thin blanket materials but are labor
intensive to install and require a
larger storage space.

iv. An alternative is external blankets

or insulation. They are more expen-
sive to build, however, because
they must be weather resistant.
Sleet and snow are difficult to re-
move, and the operator must go
outside to install them.

7. Ventilation and cooling

i. Ventilation: Ventilation equipment
will help control temperatures in all
seasons. Hand-operated side or
roof vents require constant supervi-
sion. Automatic ventilation is
simple to install and requires only
an electric motor, thermostat, and a
pulley or gear system.

ii. Fans provide good ventilation. You
can use them alone or in combina-
tion with other vents. Vent fans to
draw in the outside air or to recir-
culate internal air. Fans in combi-
nation with a polyethylene duct
will help to distribute the air evenly
throughout the greenhouse.

iii. Exhaust fans will draw out the
heated air. Usually, you install
them near the roof line to prevent
drafts. Use in conjunction with a
second vent such as a louvered
shutter that opens when the exhaust
fan starts. Place the vent at a lower
level so cool air moves across the
greenhouse, mixing with warmer
air.

Note: Wire all fans to a thermostat set at the
temperature desired before beginning
ventilation.

iv. Cooling: When the external air is

not cool enough to provide internal
cooling for the greenhouse, you
should use evaporative coolers or
mist blowers to cool the air. Evapo-

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

23 - 13

rative cooling draws outside air
through wet fiber pads that cool the
air and add some moisture to it.
v. Mist blowers use fans that blow
mist from a fine jet of water into
the greenhouse. The mist cools the
air and provides needed humidity.
Control all cooling systems auto-
matically with thermostats.

vi. Shading: Shading can reduce the

need to ventilate and cool a green-
house because it curtails the
amount of radiation entering. Shad-
ing also protects plants from the
direct rays of the hot summer sun
and reduces light intensity. Often
needed from June to August, you
can provide shading by whitewash-
ing the greenhouse, attaching
blinds or panels, or by covering the
house with shade or saran cloth.

8. Lighting

In the greenhouse, you may need to
supplement natural light, especially dur-
ing the long winter nights. Light controls
most plant functions, so it is important to
understand the needs of your plants.
a. Light quality: Plants use red and blue

portions of white light for various
plant functions. It is important to have
red/orange light for germination, matu-
ration, and flower and seed production.
Plants use blue/violet light for growth
and leaf development. Artificial lights
must supply the proper light spectra.
b. Light intensity: Some plants require

bright light to grow, while others pre-
fer shady (less intense light) areas.
Light is measured in foot-candles or
lux (see section “I.B” on Light).

c. Light duration: A photoperiodic effect
is the response of a plant to the length
of the light and dark periods. Flower-
ing is the most dramatic effect associ-
ated with the length of exposure to
light.
i. Short-day plants respond to a day-

length of less than 12 hours.

ii. Long-day plants respond to a day-

length of longer than 12 hours.

iii. Day-neutral plants do not respond

to the variations in the light-dark
cycle.

iv. If you want flowering in certain
plants, you need to provide the
proper daylength. You do this by
extending the days with artificial
light, or if the days are too long, by
shading the plants with an opaque
black cloth supported on a frame.
v. Do not ever peek into the shaded
area, however, as just a “flash” of
light will destroy the long-night
effect!

vi. To provide a longer day-length, the

light intensity does not need to be
as high as it would be for proper
growing conditions.

d. Artificial lights: You can use various
types of lamps in the greenhouse. A
simple timer is ideal for turning the
lights on and off.
i.

Incandescent: These lamps give off
red light and infrared radiation that
becomes heat. They are not intense
enough to supply light to plants
with a high light requirement. Light
distribution is restricted.

ii. Fluorescent: Fluorescent lamps
produce less heat, and different
types vary in their output in the
red-blue areas. One cool-white and
one warm-white bulb provide a
good spectrum for plant growth.

iii. Mercury vapor, sodium, and metal-

lic halide: These lamps provide
high intensity lighting. They are
expensive and more suitable to
large-scale production.

e. Watering: In the home greenhouse, the

traditional watering method is a mist
or spray nozzle on a garden hose. The
greenhouse gardener who is gone a lot
can install automatic systems, such as
mist nozzles, spaghetti tubes, or capil-
lary mats.
i.

In some areas, water quality is a
concern. Water high in salts or high
in alkalinity may need special treat-
ment for greenhouse use.

Chapter 23, The Idaho Master Gardener Program Handbook

IX. Small Beds for Growing Plants

A. Cold Frames

A cold frame is a bottomless box with a re-
movable lid that you can prop open at various
degrees. The lid consists of glass or other
greenhouse covering material on a frame.
1. Cold frames do not require artificial heat or

manure. They use the sun’s heat to warm
the soil during the day, and the heat’s radia-
tion in the closed cold frame keeps the
plants warm at night.

2. During the day, control ventilation and heat-

ing by propping open the lid.

3. Use cold frames to plant seeds and produce
transplants for main season gardens and for
root cuttings.

B. Hotbeds

You can convert cold frames to hotbeds simply
by adding a heat source such as manure, elec-
tricity, steam, or hot-water pipes. Start seeds or
force plants in hotbeds.
1. The amount of extra heat needed depends
on available sun and the external tempera-
tures. Soil-heating cable that provides 10 to
15 watts of electric heat per square foot is
ideal for most hotbeds. If the bed is in a
sunny, well-sheltered location and the cli-
mate is not too severe; 10 watts per square
foot should be adequate.

2. Attach your heat source to a thermostat or
buy a heat cable with one to provide accu-
rate temperature control in the 50° to 79°F
range. On very cold nights, cover the beds
with extra insulating materials.

3. Adding manure that heats as it decomposes
is an effective practice that has worked for
centuries. Modern gardeners, however,
rarely use manure as a heat source.

C. Cloches

Protecting plants by providing a cloche, or
miniature greenhouse, is standard practice for
gardeners. The cloche offers only temporary
protection until the outside temperature is fa-
vorable enough to produce good growth. Hot
caps, commercial “Walls of Water,” and 1-gal-
lon plastic milk cartons with the bottom cut out
are temporary structures that help moderate the
temperature around plants.

1. Producing an entire crop under cover of a

cloche is practical wherever the weather
is unreliable or predominantly cool.
Growing a crop in a cloche allows the
gardener to produce plants that otherwise
may not grow in the area. Cloches are
suited to intensively managed gardens
and severe climates. The cloche provides
a constant warm temperature and pre-
vents wind, rain, frost, and pest damage.
They may be only the size of a single
plant or large enough to cover several.

2. Cloches can have a frame of some type to

support the covering material (use any
greenhouse material or floating row
cover). It may be necessary to use some
type of venting system to reduce the heat
that solar radiation produces. Construc-
tion and anchoring needs to be strong
enough to withstand the wind conditions
of the area. Often cloches are designed to
last only 1 year.
