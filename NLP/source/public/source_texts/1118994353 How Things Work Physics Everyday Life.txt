Foreword

IÂ 

n todayâs world we are surrounded by science and by
the technology that has grown out of that science. For
most of us, this is making the world increasingly mysterious and somewhat ominous as technology becomes
ever more powerful. For instance, we are confronted by
many global environmental questions such as the dangers of greenhouse gases and the best choices of energy
sources. These are questions that are fundamentally technical in nature and there is a bewildering variety of claims
and counterclaims as to what is âthe truthâ on these and
similar important scientific issues. For many people, the
reaction is to throw up their hands in hopeless frustration
and accept that the modern world is impossible to understand and one can only huddle in helpless ignorance at the
mercy of its mysterious and inexplicable behavior.
In fact, much of the world around us and the technology of our everyday lives is governed by a few basic
physics principles, and once these principles are understood, the world and the vast array of technology in our
lives become understandable and predictable. How does
your microwave oven heat up food? Why is your radio
reception bad in some places and not others? And why
can birds happily land on a high-voltage electrical wire?
The answers to questions like these are obvious once you
know the relevant physics. Unfortunately, you are not
likely to learn that from a standard physics course or
physics textbook. There is a large body of research showing that, instead of providing this improved understanding of
everyday life, most introductory physics courses are
doing quite the opposite. In spite of the best intentions of
the teachers, most students are âlearningâ that physics is
abstract, uninteresting, and unrelated to the world around
them.
How Things Work is a dramatic step toward changing
that by presenting physics in a new way. Instead of starting out with abstract principles that leave the reader with
the idea that physics is about artificial and uninteresting
ideas, Lou Bloomfield starts out talking about real objects
and devices that we encounter in our everyday lives. He
then shows how these seemingly magical devices can be
understood in terms of the basic physics principles that
govern their behavior. This is much the way that most
physics was discovered in the first place: people asked
why the world around them behaved as it did and as a
result discovered the principles that explained and predicted what they observed.

I have been using this book in my classes for several
years, and I continue to be impressed with how Lou can
take seemingly highly complex devices and strip away
the complexity to show how at their heart are simple
physics ideas. Once these ideas are understood, they can
be used to understand the behavior of many devices we
encounter in our daily lives, and often even fix things that
before had seemed impossibly complex. In the process of
teaching from this book, I have increased my own understanding of the physics behind much of the world around
me. In fact, after consulting How Things Work, I have had
the confidence to confront both plumbers and airconditioner repairmen to tell them (correctly as it turned out)
that their diagnosis did not make sense and they needed to
do something different to solve my plumbing and AC
problems. Now I am regularly amused at the misconceptions some trained physicists have about some of the
physics they encounter in their daily lives, such as how a
microwave oven works and why it can be made out of
metal walls, but putting aluminum foil in it is bad. It has
convinced me that we need to take the approach used in
this book in far more of our science texts.
Of course, the most important impact is on the students in my classes that use this book. These are typically
nonscience students majoring in fields such as film
studies, classics, English, business, etc. They often come
to physics with considerable trepidation. It is inspiring to
see many of them discover to their surprise that physics is
very different from what they thoughtâthat physics can
actually be interesting and useful and makes the world a
much less mysterious and more understandable place. I
remember many examples of seeing this in action: the
student who, after learning how both speakers and TVs
work, was suddenly able to understand that it was not
magic that putting his large speaker next to the TV distorted the picture but in fact it was just physics, and now
he knew just how to fix it; the young woman scuba diver
who, after learning about light and color, suddenly interrupted
class to announce that now she understood why it was
that you could tell how deep you were by seeing what
color lobsters appeared; or the students who announced
that suddenly it made sense that the showers on the first
floor of the dorm worked better than those on the second
floor. In addition, of course everyone is excited to learn
how a microwave oven works and why there are these
strange rules as to what you can and cannot put in it.

Foreword

These examples are particularly inspiring to a teacher,
because they tell you that the students are not just learning the material presented in class but they are then able
to apply that understanding to new situations in a useful
way, something that happens far too seldom in science
courses.
Whether a curious layperson, a trained physicist, or a
beginning physics student, most everyone will find this

book an interesting and enlightening read and will go
away comforted in that the world is not so strange and
inexplicable after all.

Preface

hysics is a remarkably practical science. Not only
does it explain how things work or why they donât,
it also offers great insight into how to create, improve, and repair those things. Because of that fundamental relationship between physics and real objects,
introductory physics books are essentially usersâ manuals
for the world in which we live.
Like usersâ manuals, however, introductory physics
books are most accessible when theyâre based on realworld examples. Both usersâ manuals and physics texts
tend to go unread when theyâre written like reference
works, organized by abstract technical issues, indifferent
to relevance, and lacking in useful examples. For practical guidance, most readers turn to âhow toâ books and
tutorials instead; they prefer the âcase-studyâ approach.
How Things Work is an introduction to physics and
science that starts with whole objects and looks inside
them to see what makes them work. It follows the casestudy method, exploring physics concepts on a need-toknow basis in the context of everyday objects. More than
just an academic volume, this book is intended to be
interesting, relevant, and useful to non-science students.
Most physics texts develop the principles of physics
first and present real-life examples of these principles
reluctantly if at all. That approach is abstract and inaccessible, providing few conceptual footholds for students as
they struggle to understand unfamiliar principles. After
all, the comforts of experience and intuition lie in the
examples, not in the principles. While a methodical and
logical development of scientific principles can be satisfying to the seasoned scientist, itâs alien to someone who
doesnât even recognize the language being used.
In contrast, How Things Work brings science to the
reader rather than the reverse. It conveys an understanding and appreciation for physics by finding physics
concepts and principles within the familiar objects of
everyday experience. Because its structure is defined by
real-life examples, this book necessarily discusses concepts as theyâre needed and then revisits them whenever
they reappear in other objects. What better way is there to
show the universality of the natural laws?
I wrote this book to be read, not merely referred to. It
has always been for nonscientists and I designed it with
them in mind. In the seventeen years I have been teaching

P
Â 

xiv

How Things Work, many of my thousands of students have
been surprised at their own interest in the physics of
everyday life, have asked insightful questions, have experimented on their own, and have found themselves explaining to friends and family how things in their world work.

Changes in the Sixth Edition
Content Changes
â˘Â Video figures. If a picture is worth a thousand words,
a video is worth a thousand pictures. Thatâs particularly true for this book because so much of physics
is about how things evolve with time. Most students
consider themselves visual learnersâthey need to
see what happens in order to understand it. Given
that requirement, still images are so 20th century.
In this edition, I have replaced many of the
static figures with video figures, using the tools of
modern 3D animation and video editing. In print,
those video figures are distilled into motionless
images but online, they move and talk. Whenever
possible and practical, the video figures are quantitatively accurate in both time and space. Theyâre
not just cartoons; theyâre careful models of the real
world.
â˘Â Rewriting and editing. Despite teaching How
Things Work for almost 25 years, I am still learning how to explain the physics of everyday life.
I continue to discover clearer approaches, better
analogies, and more effective techniques for conveying understanding and avoiding misconceptions.
For this edition, I have examined every word of the
book, editing and rewriting it to make sure that it is
doing the best job possible.
â˘Â Improved discussions of many physics concepts.
No one book can or should cover all of physics, but
whatever physics is included should be presented
carefully enough to be worthwhile. In this edition, I
have refined the discussions of many physics issues
and added some new ones. Look for improved coverage of concepts such as orbits, magnetic induction, and antennas, to name just a few.

Preface

The Goals of This Book
As they read this book, students should:
1. Begin to see science in everyday life. Science is
everywhere; we need only open our eyes to see it. Weâre
surrounded by things that can be understood in terms of
science, much of which is within a studentâs reach. Seeing
science doesnât mean that when viewing an oil painting
they should note only the selective reflection of incident
light waves by organic and inorganic molecules. Rather,
they should realize that thereâs a beauty to science that
complements aesthetic beauty. They can learn to look at
a glorious red sunset and appreciate both its appearance
and why it exists.
2. Learn that science isnât frightening. The increasing technological complexity of our world has instilled
within most people a significant fear of science. As the
gulf widens between those who create technology and
those who use it, their ability to understand one another
and communicate diminishes. The average person no
longer tinkers with anything and many modern devices
are simply disposable, being too complicated to modify
or repair. To combat the anxiety that accompanies unfamiliarity, this book shows students that most objects can
be examined and understood, and that the science behind
them isnât scary after all. The more we understand how
others think, the better off weâll all be.
3. Learn to think logically in order to solve problems.
Because the universe obeys a system of well-defined
rules, it permits a logical understanding of its behaviors.
Like mathematics and computer science, physics is a field
of study where logic reigns supreme. Having learned a
handful of simple rules, students can combine them logically to obtain more complicated rules and be certain that
those new rules are true. So the study of physical systems
is a good place to practice logical thinking.
4. Develop and expand their physical intuition. When
youâre exiting from a highway, you donât have to consider
velocity, acceleration, and inertia to know that you should
brake graduallyâyou already have physical intuition that
tells you the consequences of doing otherwise. Such physical intuition is essential in everyday life, but it ordinarily
takes time and experience to acquire. This book aims to
broaden a studentâs physical intuition to situations they
normally avoidor have yet to encounter. That is, after all,
one of the purposes of reading and scholarship: to learn
from other peopleâs experiences.
5. Learn how things work. As this book explores the
objects of everyday life, it gradually uncovers most of the
physical laws that govern the universe. It reveals those
laws as they were originally discovered: while trying to

xv

understand real objects. As they read this book and learn
these laws, students should begin to see the similarities
between objects, shared mechanisms, and recurring
themes that are reused by nature or by people. This book
reminds students of these connections and is ordered so
that later objects build on their understanding of concepts
encountered earlier.
6. Begin to understand that the universe is predictable rather than magical. One of the foundations of science is that effects have causes and donât simply occur
willy-nilly. Whatever happens, we can look backward in
time to find what caused it. We can also predict the future
to some extent, based on insight acquired from the past
and on knowledge of the present. And where predictability is limited, we can understand those limitations. What
distinguishes the physical sciences and mathematics from
other fields is that there are often absolute answers, free
from inconsistency, contraindication, or paradox. Once
students understand how the physical laws govern the
universe, they can start to appreciate that perhaps the
most magical aspect of our universe is that it is not magic;
that it is orderly, structured, and understandable.
7. Obtain a perspective on the history of science and
technology. None of the objects that this book examines
appeared suddenly and spontaneously in the workshop of
a single individual who was oblivious to what had been
done before. These objects were developed in the context
of history by people who were generally aware of what
they were doing and usually familiar with any similar objects that already existed. Nearly everything is discovered
or developed when related activities make their discoveries or developments inevitable and timely. To establish
that historical context, this book describes some of the
history behind the objects it discusses.

Visual Media
Because this book is about real things, its videos, illustrations, and photographs are about real things, too. Whenever possible, these visual materials are built around
familiar objects so that the concepts they are meant to
convey become associated with objects students already
know. Many students are visual learnersâif they see it,
they can learn it. By superimposing the abstract concepts
of physics onto simple realistic visuals, this book attempts
to connect physics with everyday life. That idea is particularly evident at the opening of each section, where the
object examined in that section appears in a carefully
rendered drawing. This drawing provides students with
something concrete to keep in mind as they encounter
the more abstract physical concepts that appear in that
section. By lowering the boundaries between what the

briefly at the end of the chapter, with an emphasis
on how the objects work. These summaries are followed by a restatement of the important physical
laws and equations encountered within the chapter.

This printed book contains 40 sections, each of which
discusses how something works. The sections are grouped
together in 15 chapters according to the major physical
themes developed. In addition to the discussion itself, the
sections and chapters include a number of features
intended to strengthen the educational value of this book.
Among these features are:

â˘Â Chapter exercises and problems. Following the
chapter summary material is a collection of questions dealing with the physics concepts in that
chapter. Exercises ask the students to apply those
concepts to new situations. Problems ask the students to apply the equations in that chapter and to
obtain quantitative results.

â˘Â Chapter introductions, experiments, and itineraries. Each of the 15 chapters begins with a brief introduction to the principal theme underlying that chapter.
It then presents an experiment that students can do
with household items to observe firsthand some of
the issues associated with that physical theme. Lastly,
it presents a general itinerary for the chapter, identifying some of the physical issues that will come up as
the objects in the chapter are discussed.

â˘Â Three-way approach to the equation of physics.
The laws and equations of physics are the groundwork on which everything else is built. But because
each student responds differently to the equations,
this book presents them carefully and in context.
Rather than making one size fit all, these equations
are presented in three different forms. The first is a
word equation, identifying each physical quantity
by name to avoid any ambiguities. The second is a
symbolic equation, using the standard format and
notation. The third is a sentence that conveys the
meaning of the equation in simple terms and often
by example. Each student is likely to find one of
these three forms more comfortable, meaningful,
and memorable than the others.

students see in the book and what they see in their environment, the rich visual media associated with this book
makes science a part of their world.

â˘Â Section introductions, questions, and experiments. Each of the 40 sections explains how something works. Often that something is a specific object or group of objects, but it is sometimes more
general. A section begins by introducing the object and then asks a number of questions about it,
questions that might occur to students as they think
about the object and that are answered by the section. Lastly, it suggests some simple experiments
that students can do to observe some of the physical
concepts that are involved in the object.
â˘Â Check your understanding and check your figures. Sections are divided into a number of brief
segments, each of which ends with a âCheck Your
Understandingâ question. These questions apply the
physics of the preceding segment to new situations
and are followed by answers and explanations.
Segments that introduce important equations also
end with a âCheck Your Figuresâ question. These
questions show how the equations can be applied
and are also followed by answers and explanations.
â˘Â Chapter epilogue and explanation of experiment. Each chapter ends with an epilogue that reminds the students of how the objects they studied in that chapter fit within the chapterâs physical
theme. Following the epilogue is a brief explanation of the experiment suggested at the beginning
of the chapter, using physical concepts that were
developed in the intervening sections.

â˘Â Glossary. The key physics terms are assembled into
a glossary at the end of the book. Each glossary term
is also marked in bold in the text when it first appears together with its contextual definition.
â˘Â Historical, technical, and biographical asides. To
show how issues discussed in this book fit into the
real world of people, places, and things, a number
of brief asides have been placed in the margins of
the text. An appropriate time at which to read a particular aside is marked in the text by a color-coded
mark such as .

Organization
The 40 sections that make up this book are ordered so that
they follow a familiar path through physics: mechanics,
heat and thermodynamics, resonance and mechanical
waves, electricity and magnetism, light, optics, and electronics, and modern physics. Because there are too many
topics here to cover in a single semester, the book is
designed to allow shortcuts through the material. In general, the final sections in each chapter and the final chapters
in each of the main groups mentioned above can be omitted

Preface

without serious impact on the material that follows. The
only exceptions to that rule are the first two chapters, which
should be covered in their entirety as the introduction to
any course taught from this book. The book also divides
neatly in half so that it can be used for two independent
one-semester coursesâthe first covering Chapters 1â9 and
the second covering Chapters 1, 2, and 10â15. That twocourse approach is the one I use myself. A detailed guide to
shortcuts appears on the instructorâs website.

guidance, and encouragement of Christine Kushner, Geraldine Osnato, and Petra Recter.
To my numerous other friends and collaborators at John Wiley, many thanks.
I continue to enjoy tremendous assistance from colleagues here and elsewhere who
have supported the How Things Work concept, discussed it with me, and often taught the
course themselves. They are now too many to list, but I appreciate them all. I am particularly grateful, however, to my colleagues in AMO physics at Virginia, Tom Gallagher, Bob
Jones, Olivier Pfister, and Cass Sackett, for more than making up for my reduced scientific
accomplishments while working on this project, and to Carl Weiman for his vision of physics education as outlined in the foreword to this book. I must also thank our talented lecturedemonstration group, Al Tobias, Max Bychkov, Mike Timmins, Nikolay Sandev, and
Roger Staton, for help to bring physics to life in my class and in the videos for this book.
Of course, the best way to discover how students learn science is to teach it. I am ever
so grateful to the students of the University of Virginia for being such eager, enthusiastic,
and interactive participants in this long educational experiment. It has been a delight and a
privilege to get to know so many of them as individuals and their influence on this enterprise has been immeasurable.
Lastly, this book has benefited more than most from the constructive criticism of a
number of talented reviewers. Their candid, insightful comments were sometimes painful
to read or hear, but they invariably improved the book. Not only did their reviews help me
to present the material more effectively, but they taught me some interesting physics as
well. My deepest thanks to all of these fine people:

The real test of this book, and of any course taught from it, is its impact on studentsâ lives
long after their classroom days are done. Theirsâ is a time both exciting and perilous; one

The Laws of Motion
PART 1

he aim of this book is to broaden your perspectives on familiar objects and situations by
helping you understand the science that makes them work. Instead of ignoring that science
or taking it for granted, weâll seek it out in the world around us, in the objects we encounter
every day. As we do so, weâll discover that seemingly âmagicalâ objects and effects are quite understandable once we know a few of the physical concepts that make them possible. In short, weâll
learn about physicsâthe study of the material world and the rules that govern its behavior.
To help us get started, this first pair of chapters will do two main things: introduce the language of physics, which weâll be using throughout the book, and present the basic laws of motion
on which everything else will rest. In later chapters, weâll examine objects that are interesting and
important, both in their own right and because of the scientific issues they raise. Most of these
objects, as weâll see, involve many different aspects of physics and thus bring variety to each section and chapter. These first two chapters are special, though, because they must provide an orderly
introduction to the discipline of physics itself.

ACTIVE LEARNING
EXPERIMENTS

Removing a Tablecloth from a Table
helps because you can then pull the cloth slightly downward at the edge of the table. When you get up the nerve to
tryâwith unbreakable dishes, of courseâmake sure that
you pull suddenly and swiftly, so as to minimize the time
it takes for the cloth to slide out from under the dishes.
Leaving a little slack in the cloth at first helps you get
your hands up to speed before the cloth snaps taut and
begins to slide off the table. Donât make the mistake of
starting slowly or youâll decorate the floor.

Courtesy Lou Bloomfield

One famous âmagicalâ effect allows a tablecloth to be
removed from a set table without breaking the dishes. The
person performing this stunt pulls the tablecloth sideways
in one lightning-fast motion. The smooth, slippery tablecloth slides out from under the dishes, leaving them
behind and nearly unaffected.
With some practice, you too can do this stunt. Choose
a slick, unhemmed tablecloth, one with no flaws that
might catch on the dishes. A supple fabric such as silk

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

Give the tablecloth a yank and watch what happens.
With luck, the table will remain set. If it doesnât, try
again, but this time go faster or change the types of dishes
or the way you pull the cloth.
If you donât have a suitable tablecloth, or any
dishes you care to risk, there are many similar experiments you can try. Put several coins on a sheet of paper
and whisk that sheet out from under them. Or stack several books on a table and use a stiff ruler to knock out
the bottom one. Especially impressive is balancing a

short eraserless pencil on top of a wooden embroidery
hoop that is itself balanced on the open mouth of a
glass bottle. If you yank the ring away quickly enough,
the pencil will be left behind and will drop right into
the bottle.
The purpose of this experiment is addressed in a simple question: Why do the dishes stay put as you remove
the tablecloth? Weâll return to that question at the end of
this chapter. In the meantime, weâll explore some of the
physics concepts that allow us to answer it.

Chapter Itinerary
To examine these concepts, weâll look carefully at three kinds of
everyday activities and objects: (1) skating, (2) falling balls, and
(3) ramps. In Skating, we see how objects move when nothing
pushes on them. In Falling Balls, we find out how that movement
can be influenced by gravity. In Ramps, we explore mechanical
advantage and how gradual inclines make it possible to lift heavy
objects without pushing very hard. For a more complete preview of
what we examine in this chapter, flip ahead to the Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations at the end of the chapter.

These activities may seem mundane, but understanding
them in terms of basic physical laws requires considerable
thought. These two introductory chapters will be like climbing
up the edge of a high plateau: the ascent wonât be easy, and our
destination will be hidden from view. However, once we arrive at
the top, with the language and basic concepts of physics in
place, weâll be able to explain a broad variety of objects with
only a small amount of additional effort. And so we begin the
ascent.

understand the first few laws of motion. Weâll leave sloping
surfaces for the section on ramps and wonât have time to teach
you how to do spins or win a race. Nonetheless, our exploration
of skating will get us well on the way to an understanding of the
fundamental principles that govern all movement and thereby
prepare us for many of the objects weâll examine in the rest of
this book.

Like many sports, skating is trickier than it appears. If youâre a
first-time skater, youâre likely to find yourself getting up repeatedly from the ground or ice, and it will take some practice
before you can glide smoothly forward or come gracefully to a
stop. But whether youâre wearing ice skates or roller skates, the
physics of your motion is surprisingly simple. When youâre on a
level surface with your skates pointing forward, you coast!
Coasting is one of the most basic concepts in physics and
our starting point in this book. Joining it in this section will be
starting, stopping, and turning, which together will help us

Experiments to Do: A visit to the ice or roller rink would be
ideal, but even a skateboard or a chair with wheels will suffice.
Get yourself moving forward on a level surface and then let
yourself coast. Why do you keep moving? Is anything pushing
you forward? Does your direction ever reverse as you coast?
How could you describe the details of your motion to someone
on your cell phone? How would you measure your speed?
Before you run into a wall or tree, slow yourself to a
stop. What was it that slowed you down? Were you still coasting as you stopped? Did anything push on you as you slowed
yourself?
Get yourself moving again. What caused you to speed up?
How quickly can you pick up speed, and what do you do differently to speed up quickly? Now turn to one side or the other.
Did anything push on you as you turned? What happened to
your speed? What happened to your direction of travel?

Skating

Gliding Forward: Inertia and Coasting
While youâre putting on your skates, letâs take a moment to think about what happens to a
person who has nothing pushing on her at all. When sheâs completely free of outside influences (Fig. 1.1.1), free of pushes and pulls, does she stand still? Does she move? Does she
speed up? Does she slow down? In short, what does she do?
The correct answer to that apparently simple question eluded people for thousands of
years; even Aristotle, perhaps the most learned philosopher of the classical world, was
mistaken about it (see 1 ). What makes this question so tricky is that objects on Earth are
never truly free of outside influences; instead, they all push on, rub against, or interact with
one another in some way.
As a result, it took the remarkable Italian astronomer, mathematician, and physicist
Galileo Galilei many years of careful observation and logical analysis to answer that
question 2 . The solution he came up with, like the question itself, is simple: if the person
is stationary, she will remain stationary; if she is moving in some particular direction, she
will continue moving in that direction at a steady pace, following a straight-line path.
This property of steady motion in the absence of any outside influence is called inertia
(Fig 1.1.2).

INERTIA
A body in motion tends to remain in motion; a body at rest tends to remain at rest.

The main reason that Aristotle failed to discover inertia, and why we often overlook
inertia ourselves, is friction. When you slide across the floor in your shoes, friction quickly
slows you to a stop and masks your inertia. To make inertia more obvious, we must get rid
of friction. Thatâs why youâre wearing skates.
Skates almost completely eliminate friction, at least in one direction, so that you can
glide effortlessly across the ice or roller rink and experience your own inertia. For simplicity,
imagine that your skates are perfect and experience no friction at all as you glide. Also, for
this and the next couple of sections, letâs forget not only about friction but also about air
resistance. Since the air is calm and youâre not moving too fast, air resistance isnât all that
important to skating anyway.
Now that youâre ready to skate, weâll begin to examine five important physical quantities relating to motion and look at their relationships to one another. These quantities are
position, velocity, mass, acceleration, and force.
Letâs start by describing where you are. At any particular moment, youâre located at
a positionâthat is, at a specific point in space. Whenever we report your position, itâs
always as a distance and direction from some reference point, how many meters north
of the refreshment stand or how many kilometers west of Cleveland. For our discussion
of skating, weâll choose as our reference point the bench you used while putting on your
skates.
Position is an example of a vector quantity. A vector quantity consists of both a magnitude and a direction; the magnitude tells you how much of the quantity there is, while
the direction tells you which way the quantity is pointing. Vector quantities are common in
nature. When you encounter one, pay attention to the direction part; if youâre looking for
buried treasure 30 paces from the old tree but forget that itâs due east of that tree, youâll
have a lot of digging ahead of you.
Youâre on your feet and beginning to skate. Once youâre moving, your position is
changing, which brings us to our second vector quantityâvelocity. Velocity measures the

glides without any horizontal
influences. If sheâs
stationary, sheâll tend to
remain stationary; if sheâs
moving, sheâll tend to
continue moving.
1 Aristotle (Greek
philosopher, 384â322 bc)
theorized that objectsâ
velocities were proportional
to the forces exerted on
them. While this theory
correctly predicted the
behavior of a sliding object,
it incorrectly predicted that
heavier objects should fall
faster than lighter objects.
Nonetheless, Aristotleâs
theory was respected for a
long time, in part because
finding the simpler and
more complete theory was
hard and in part because the
scientific method of
relating theory and observation took time to develop.
2 While a professor
in Pisa, Galileo Galilei
(Italian scientist,
1564â1642) was obliged to
teach the natural philosophy of Aristotle.
Troubled with the conflict
between Aristotleâs theory
and observations of the
world around him, Galileo
devised experiments that
measured the speeds at
which objects fall and
determined that all falling
objects fall at the same rate.

3 In 1664, while Sir Isaac
Newton (English scientist
and mathematician,
1642â1727) was a student
at Cambridge University,
the university was forced
to close for 18 months
because of the plague.
Newton retreated to the
country, where he
discovered the laws of
motion and gravitation
and invented the
mathematical basis
of calculus. These
discoveries, along with his
observation that celestial
objects such as the moon
obey the same simple
physical laws as terrestrial
objects such as an apple (a
new idea for the time), are
recorded in his PhilosophiĂŚ
Naturalis Principia
Mathematica, first
published in 1687. This
book is perhaps the most
important and influential
scientific and mathematical
work of all time.

and its direction is the direction in which youâre heading.
For example, if you move 2 meters (6.6 feet) west in 1 second, then your velocity is 2
meters per second (6.6 feet per second) toward the west. If you maintain that velocity, your
position moves 20 meters west in 10 seconds, 200 meters west in 100 seconds, and so on.
Even when youâre motionless, you still have a velocityâzero. A velocity of zero is special,
however, because it has no direction.
When youâre gliding freely, however, with nothing pushing you horizontally, your
velocity is particularly easy to describe. Since you travel at a steady speed along a straightline path, your velocity is constantâit never changes. In a word, you coast. And if you
happen to be at rest with nothing pushing you horizontally, you remain at rest. Your velocity is constantly zero.
Thanks to your skates, we can now restate the previous description of inertia in terms
of velocity: an object that is not subject to any outside influences moves at a constant velocity, covering equal distances in equal times along a straight-line path. This statement is
frequently identified as Newtonâs first law of motion, after its discoverer, the English
mathematician and physicist Sir Isaac Newton 3 . The outside influences referred to in this
law are called forces, a technical term for pushes and pulls. An object that moves in accordance with Newtonâs first law is said to be inertial.

NEWTONâS FIRST LAW OF MOTION
An object that is not subject to any outside forces moves at a constant velocity, covering
equal distances in equal times along a straight-line path.

INTUITION AL ERT: Coasting
Intuition says that when nothing pushes on an object, that object slows to a stop; you must push
it to keep it going.
Physics says that when nothing pushes on an object, that object coasts at constant velocity.
Resolution: Objects usually experience hidden forces, such as friction or air resistance, that tend
to slow them down. Eliminating those hidden forces is difficult, so that you rarely see the full
coasting behavior of force-free objects.

Check Your Understanding #1: A Puck on Ice
Why does a moving hockey puck continue to slide across an ice rink even though no one is pushing
on it?
Answer: The puck coasts across the ice because it has inertia.
Why: A hockey puck resting on the surface of wet ice is almost completely free of horizontal influences. If someone pushes on the puck, so that it begins to travel with a horizontal velocity across the
ice, inertia will ensure that the puck continues to slide at constant velocity.

Skating

The Alternative to Coasting: Acceleration
As you glide forward with nothing pushing you horizontally, what prevents your speed and direction from changing? The answer is your mass. Mass is the measure of your inertia, your resistance to changes in velocity. Almost everything in the universe has mass. Mass has no direction,
so itâs not a vector quantity. It is a scalar quantityâthat is, a quantity that has only an amount.
Because you have mass, your velocity will change only if something pushes on youâ
that is, only if you experience a force. Youâll keep moving steadily in a straight path until
something exerts a force on you to stop you or send you in another direction. Force is our
third vector quantity, having both a magnitude and a direction. After all, a push to the right
is different from a push to the left.
When something pushes on you, your velocity changes; in other words, you accelerate. Acceleration, our fourth vector quantity, measures the rate at which your velocity is
changing with time (Fig. 1.1.3). Any change in your velocity is acceleration, whether youâre
speeding up, slowing down, or turning. If either your speed or direction of travel is changing, youâre accelerating!
Like any vector quantity, acceleration has a magnitude and a direction. To see how
these two parts of acceleration work, imagine that youâre at the starting line of a speedskating race, waiting for it to begin. The starting buzzer sounds, and youâre off! You dig your
skates into the surface beneath you and begin to accelerateâyour speed increases and you
cover ground more and more quickly. The magnitude of your acceleration depends on how
hard the skating surface pushes you forward. If itâs a long race and youâre not in a hurry,
you take your time getting up to full speed. The surface pushes you forward gently and the
magnitude of your acceleration is small. Your velocity changes slowly. However, if the race
is a sprint and you need to reach top speed as quickly as possible, you spring forward hard
and the surface exerts an enormous forward force on you. The magnitude of your acceleration is large, and your velocity changes rapidly. In this case, you can actually feel your
inertia opposing your efforts to pick up speed.
Acceleration has more than just a magnitude, though. When you start the race, you also
select a direction for your accelerationâthe direction toward which your velocity is shifting
with time. This acceleration is in the same direction as the force causing it. If you obtain a forward force from the surface, youâll accelerate forwardâyour velocity will shift more and more
forward. If you obtain a sideways force from the surface, the other racers will have to jump out
of your way as you careen into the wall. Theyâll laugh all the way to the finish line at your failure
to recognize the importance of direction in the definitions of force and acceleration.
Once youâre going fast enough, you can stop fighting inertia and begin to glide. You
coast forward at a constant velocity. Now inertia is helping you; it keeps you moving

this baseball to accelerate toward the
right. Its velocity is increasing toward
the right so that it travels farther with
each passing second.

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

steadily along even though nothing is pushing you forward. (Recall that weâre neglecting
friction and air resistance. In reality, those effects push you backward and gradually slow
you down as you glide.)
Even when youâre not trying to speed up or slow down, you can still accelerate. As you
steer your skates or go over a bump, you experience sideways or upâdown forces that
change your direction of travel and thus cause you to accelerate.
Finally the race is over, and you skid to a stop. Youâre accelerating again, but this time
in the backward directionâopposite your forward velocity. Although we often call this
process deceleration, itâs just a special type of acceleration. Your forward velocity gradually diminishes until you come to rest.
To help you recognize acceleration, here are some accelerating objects:
1. A runner whoâs leaping forward at the start of a raceâthe runnerâs velocity is
changing from zero to forward, so the runner is accelerating forward.
2. A bicycle thatâs stopping at a crosswalkâits velocity is changing from forward to
zero, so itâs accelerating backward (that is, itâs decelerating).
3. An elevator thatâs just starting upward from the first floor to the fifth floorâits
velocity is changing from zero to upward, so itâs accelerating upward.
4. An elevator thatâs stopping at the fifth floor after coming from the first floorâits
velocity is changing from upward to zero, so itâs accelerating downward.
5. A car thatâs beginning to shift left to pass another carâits velocity is changing
from forward to left-forward, so itâs accelerating mostly leftward.
6. An airplane thatâs just beginning its descentâits velocity is changing from levelforward to descending-forward, so itâs accelerating almost directly downward.
7. Children riding a carousel around in a circleâwhile their speeds are constant,
their directions of travel are always changing. Weâll discuss the directions in
which theyâre accelerating in Section 3.3.
Here are some objects that are not accelerating:
1. A parked carâits velocity is always zero.
2. A car traveling straight forward on a level road at a steady speedâthere is no
change in its speed or direction of travel.
3. A bicycle thatâs climbing up a smooth, straight hill at a steady speedâthere is no
change in its speed or direction of travel.
4. An elevator thatâs moving straight upward at a steady pace, halfway between the
first floor and the fifth floorâthere is no change in its speed or direction of travel.
Seeing acceleration isnât as easy as seeing position or velocity. You can determine a
skaterâs position in a single glance and her velocity by comparing her positions in two
separate glances. To observe her acceleration, however, you need at least three glances
because you are looking for how her velocity is changing with time. If her speed isnât
steady or her path isnât straight, then sheâs accelerating.
Check Your Understanding #2: Changing Trains
Trains spend much of their time coasting along at constant velocity. When does a train accelerate
forward? backward? leftward? downward?
Answer: The train accelerates forward when it starts out from a station, backward when it arrives at
the next station, to the left when it turns left, and downward when it begins its descent out of the
mountains.
Why: Whenever the train changes its speed or its direction of travel, it is accelerating. When it speeds
up on leaving a station, it is accelerating forward (more forward-directed speed). When it slows down
at the next station, it is accelerating backward (more backward-directed speed or, equivalently, less
forward-directed speed). When it turns left, it is accelerating to the left (more leftward-directed
speed). When it begins to descend, it is accelerating downward (more downward-directed speed).

How Forces Affect Skaters
Your friends skate over to congratulate you after the race, patting you on the back and giving you high-fives. Theyâre exerting forces on you, so you accelerateâbut how much do
you accelerate and in which direction?
First, although each of your friends is exerting a separate force on you, you canât accelerate in response to each force individually. After all, you have only one acceleration.
Instead, you accelerate in response to the net force you experienceâthe sum of all the
individual forces being exerted on you. Drawing this distinction between individual forces
and net force is important whenever an object is experiencing several forces at once. For
simplicity now, however, letâs wait until you have only one friend left on the ice. When that
friend finally pats you on the back, you experience only that one force, so it is the net force
on you and it causes you to accelerate.
Your acceleration depends on the strength of that net force: the stronger the net force,
the more you accelerate. However, your acceleration also depends on your mass: the more
massive you are, the less you accelerate. For example, itâs easier to change your velocity
before you eat Thanksgiving dinner than afterward.
There is a simple relationship among the net force exerted on you, your mass, and your
acceleration. Your acceleration is equal to the net force exerted on you divided by your
mass or, as a word equation,
acceleration =

net force
.
mass

(1.1.1)

Your acceleration, as weâve seen, is in the same direction as the net force on you.
This relationship was deduced by Newton from his observations of motion and is
referred to as Newtonâs second law of motion. Structuring the relationship this way sensibly distinguishes the causes (net force and mass) from their effect (acceleration). However, it has become customary to rearrange this equation to eliminate the division. The
relationship then takes its traditional form, which can be written in a word equation:
net force = mass Âˇ acceleration

(1.1.2)

in symbols:

and in everyday language:
Throwing a baseball is much easier than throwing a bowling ball (Fig. 1.1.4).
Remember that in Eq. 1.1.2 the direction of the acceleration is the same as the direction of
the net force.
NEWTONâS SECOND LAW OF MOTION
The net force exerted on an object is equal to that objectâs mass times its acceleration.
The acceleration is in the same direction as the net force.

Because itâs an equation, the two sides of Eq. 1.1.1 are equal. Your acceleration equals
the net force on you divided by your mass. Since your mass is constant unless you visit the
snack bar, Eq. 1.1.1 indicates that an increase in the net force on you is accompanied by a

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

corresponding increase in your acceleration. That way, as the right side of the equation
increases, the left side increases to keep the two sides equal. Thus the harder your friend
pushes on you, the more rapidly your velocity changes in the direction of that push.
We can also compare the effects of equal forces on two different masses, for example,
you and the former sumo wrestler to your left. Iâll assume, for the sake of argument, that
youâre the less massive of the two. Equation 1.1.1 indicates that an increase in mass must
be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in acceleration. Sure enough, your velocity
changes more rapidly than the velocity of the sumo wrestler when the two of you are subjected to identical forces (Fig. 1.1.5).
So far weâve explored five principles:
1. Your position indicates exactly where youâre located.
2. Your velocity measures the rate at which your position is changing with time.
3. Your acceleration measures the rate at which your velocity is changing with time.
4. To accelerate, you must experience a net force.
5. The greater your mass, the less acceleration you experience for a given net force.
Weâve also encountered five important physical quantitiesâmass, force, acceleration,
velocity, and positionâas well as some of the rules that relate them to one another. Much
of the groundwork of physics rests on these five quantities and on their interrelationships.
Skating certainly depends on these quantities. We can now see that, in the absence of
any horizontal forces, you either remain stationary or coast along at a constant velocity. To
start, stop, or turn, something must push you horizontally and that something is the ice or
pavement. We havenât talked about how you obtain horizontal forces from the ice or pavement, and weâll leave that problem for later sections. As you skate, however, you should be
aware of these forces and notice how they change your speed, direction of travel, or both.
Learn to watch yourself accelerate.
Check Your Understanding #3: Hard to Stop
Itâs much easier to stop a bicycle traveling toward you at 5 kilometers per hour (3 miles per hour)
than an automobile traveling toward you at the same velocity. What accounts for this difference?
Answer: An automobile has a much greater mass than a bicycle.
Why: To stop a moving vehicle, you must exert a force on it in the direction opposite its velocity. The
vehicle will then accelerate backward so that it eventually comes to rest. If the vehicle is heading
toward you, you must push it away from you. The more mass the vehicle has, the less it will accelerate in response to a certain force and the longer you will have to push on it to stop it completely.
Although itâs easy to stop a bicycle by hand, stopping even a slowly moving automobile by hand
requires a large force exerted for a substantial amount of time.

Fig. 1.1.5 A baseball, bowling ball, and file
cabinet have different masses and accelerate quite
differently in response to equal rightward forces.
Arrows representing the accelerations and velocities
of the bowling ball and file cabinet are magnified to

Check Your Figures #1: At the Bowling Alley
Bowling balls come in various masses. Suppose that you try bowling with two different balls, one with
twice the mass of the other. If you push on them with equal forces, which one will accelerate faster
and how much faster?
Answer: The less massive ball will accelerate twice as rapidly.
Why: Equation 1.1.1 shows that an objectâs acceleration is inversely proportional to its mass:
acceleration =

force
.
mass

If you push on both bowling balls with equal forces, then their accelerations will depend only on their
masses. Doubling the mass on the right side of this equation halves the acceleration on the left side.
That means that the more massive ball will accelerate only half as quickly as the other ball.

Several Skaters: Frames of Reference
While skating alone is peaceful, itâs usually more fun with other skaters around. That way,
you have people to talk to and an audience for your athleticism and artistry.
However, with several skaters coasting on the ice at once, thereâs a question of perspective. As you glide steadily past a friend, the two of you see the world somewhat differently. From your perspective, you are motionless and your friend is moving. From your
friendâs perspective, though, your friend is motionless and you are moving. Who is right?
It turns out that youâre both right and that physics has a way of accommodating this
apparent paradox. Each of you is observing the world from a different inertial frame of
reference, the viewpoint of an inertial objectâan object that is not accelerating and that
moves according to Newtonâs first law. One of the remarkable discoveries of Galileo and
Newton is that the laws of physics work perfectly in any inertial frame of reference (Fig. 1.1.6).
From an inertial frame, everything you see in the world around you obeys the laws of
motion that weâre in the process of exploring. Although you may find it odd to think of
scenery as moving, your inertial frame of reference is as good as any and in your frame you
are at rest amid the moving landscape.

Fig. 1.1.6 Two skaters
who are moving relative
to one another, but

quantities, the laws of

observes from his own

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

Since both you and your friend are coasting, each of you views the world from an
inertial frame of reference and sees the surrounding objects moving in perfect accordance
with the laws of motion. Some objects travel at constant velocity, while others accelerate in
response to forces. However, because the two of you are observing those objects from different inertial frames, you will disagree on the particular values of some of the physical
quantities you might measure.
In the present case, you see yourself as motionless because you view the world from
your own inertial frame. In that frame, your friend is coasting westward at 2 meters per second (2 m/s, which is roughly 6.6 feet per second, or 6.6 ft/s). However, your friend sees things
differently. In your friendâs inertial frame, your friend is motionless and you are coasting
eastward at 2 m/s. As long as the two of you donât try to compare the positions or velocities
of the objects you observe, or certain physical quantities derived from those values, there will
be no disagreements and no inconsistencies. However, if you forget to watch where youâre
going and crash into a wall, donât expect your friend to sympathize when you claim that you
were motionless and that the moving wall ran into you. Thatâs not how your friend saw it.
Each time we examine an object in this book, weâll pick a specific inertial frame of
reference from which to view that object. Weâll normally select an inertial frame that makes
the object and its motions appear as simple as possible and then stick with that frame consistently. The best choice of inertial frame will usually be so obvious that weâll adopt it
without even a momentâs thought. On occasion, however, weâll have to pick the frame
carefully and deliberately. Finally, although there are formal methods for working with two
or more inertial frames at once, Iâll leave that for another book.
Check Your Understanding #4: Two Views
You are standing on the sidewalk, watching a train coast eastward at constant velocity. Your friend is
riding in that train. In her inertial frame of reference, the sweater in her lap is motionless. Describe
the sweaterâs motion in your inertial frame of reference.
Answer: The sweater is coasting eastward at constant velocity.
Why: Although both of you agree that the sweater is not accelerating and that it is moving according
to Newtonâs first law, you disagree on its specific velocity. She sees the sweater at rest, while you see
it coasting eastward at constant velocity. Your viewpoints are equally valid.

Measure for Measure: The Importance of Units
If you went to the grocery store and asked for â6 of sugar,â the clerk wouldnât know how
much sugar to give you. The number 6 wouldnât be enough information; you need to specify which unitsâcups, pounds, cubes, or tonsâyou have in mind. This need to specify
units applies to almost all physical quantitiesâvelocity, force, mass, and so onâand has
led our society to develop units that everyone agrees on, also known as standard units.
For example, when you say that a skaterâs speed is 20 miles per hour, you have chosen
miles per hour as the standard unit of speed and youâre asserting that the skater is moving
20 times that fast. You can report the skaterâs speed as a multiple of any standard unit of
speedâfeet per second, yards per day, or inches per century, to name only a fewâand you
can always find a simple relationship to convert from one unit of speed to another. For
example, to convert the skaterâs speed from miles per hour to kilometers per hour, you
multiply it by 1.609 kilometers/mile:

Many of the common units in the United States come from the old English system of
units, which most of the world has abandoned in favor of SI units (SystĂŠme Internationale

Skating

dâUnitĂŠs). The continued use of English units in the United States often makes life difficult.
If you have to triple a cake recipe that calls for Âž cup of milk, you must work hard to calculate that you need 2Âź cups. Then you go to buy 2Âź cups of milk, which is slightly more
than half a quart, but end up buying 2 pints instead. You now have 14 ounces of milk more
than you needâbut is that 14 fluid ounces or 14 ounces of weight? And so it goes.
The SI system has two important characteristics that distinguish it from the English
system and make it easier to use. In the SI system:
1. Different units for the same physical quantity are related by factors of 10.
2. Most of the units are constructed out of a few basic units: the meter, the kilogram,
and the second.
Letâs start with the first characteristic: different units for the same physical quantity are
related by factors of 10. When measuring volume, 1000 milliliters is exactly 1 liter and 1000
liters is exactly 1 cubic meter (1 meter3). When measuring mass, 1000 grams is exactly
1 kilogram and 1000 kilograms is exactly 1 metric ton. Because of this consistent relationship, enlarging a recipe thatâs based on the SI system is as simple as multiplying a few
numbers. You never have to think about converting pints into quarts, teaspoons into tablespoons, or ounces into pounds. Instead, if you want to triple a recipe that calls for 500 milliliters of sugar, you just multiply the recipe by 3 to obtain 1500 milliliters of sugar. Since
1000 milliliters is 1 liter, youâll need 1.5 liters of sugar. Converting milliliters to liters is as
simple as multiplying by 0.001 liter/milliliter. (See Appendix B, online, for more
conversion factors.)
SI units remain somewhat mysterious to many U.S. residents, even though some of the
basic units are slowly appearing on our grocery shelves and highways. As a result, although
the SI system really is more sensible than the old English system, developing a feel for
some SI units is still difficult. How many of us know our heights in meters (the SI unit of
length) or our masses in kilograms (the SI unit of mass)? If your car is traveling 200 kilometers per hour and you pass a police car, are you in trouble? Yes, because 200 kilometers
per hour is about 125 miles per hour. Actually, the hour is not an SI unitâthe SI unit of
time is the secondâbut the hour remains customary for describing long periods of time.
Thus the kilometer per hour is a unit that is half SI (the kilometer part) and half customary
(the hour part).
The second characteristic of the SI system is its relatively small number of basic units.
So far, weâve noted the SI units of mass (the kilogram, abbreviated kg), length (the meter,
abbreviated m), and time (the second, abbreviated s). One kilogram is about the mass of a
liter of water; 1 meter is about the length of a long stride; 1 second is about the time it takes
to say âone banana.â From these three basic units, we can create several others, such as the
SI units of velocity (the meter per second, abbreviated m/s) and acceleration (the meter
per second squared, abbreviated m/s2). One meter per second is a healthy walking speed;
1 meter per second2 is about the acceleration of an elevator after the door closes and it
begins to move upward. This conviction that many units are best constructed out of other,
more basic units dramatically simplifies the SI system; the English system doesnât usually
suffer from such sensibility.
The SI unit of force is also constructed out of the basic units of mass, length, and time.
If we choose a 1-kilogram object and ask just how much force is needed to make that object
accelerate at 1 meter per second2, we define a specific amount of force. Since 1 kilogram is
the SI unit of mass and 1 meter per second2 is the SI unit of acceleration, itâs only reasonable to let the force that causes this acceleration be the SI unit of force, the kilogram-meter
per second2. Since this composite unit sounds unwieldy but is very important, it has been
given its own name: the newton (abbreviated N)âafter, of course, Sir Isaac, whose second
law defines the relationship among mass, length, and time that the unit expresses. Conveniently,
1 newton is about the weight of a small apple; that is, if you hold that apple steady in your
hand, youâll feel a downward force of about 1 newton.

Because a complete transition to the SI system will take generations, this book uses
both unit systems whenever possible. Although I will emphasize the SI system, English and
customary units may give you a better intuitive feel for a particular physical quantity. A
bullet train traveling â67 meters per secondâ doesnât mean much to most of us, whereas one
moving â150 miles per hourâ (150 mph) or â240 kilometers per hourâ (240 km/h) should
elicit our well-deserved respect.

Check Your Understanding #5: Going for a Walk
If youâre walking at a pace of 1 m per second, how many miles will you travel in an hour?
Answer: About 2.24 miles.
Why: There are many different units in this example, so we must do some converting. First, an hour
is 3600 s, so in an hour of walking at 1 m per second you will have walked 3600 m. Second, a mile
is about 1609 m, so each time you travel 1609 m you have traveled 1 mile. By walking 3600 m, you
have completed 2 miles and are about one-quarter of the way into your third mile.

Falling Balls
weâll start simply by exploring gravity and its effects on motion
in the context of falling objects.

Questions to Think About: What do we mean by âfalling,â
and why do balls fall? Which falls faster, a heavy ball or a light
ball? Can a ball thatâs heading upward still be falling? How
does gravity affect a ball thatâs thrown sideways?
Experiments to Do: A few seconds with a baseball will help

Weâve all dropped balls from our hands or seen them arc gracefully through the air after being thrown. These motions are simplicity itself and, not surprisingly, theyâre governed by only a
few universal rules. We encountered several of those rules in
the previous section, but weâre about to examine our first
important type of forceâgravity. Like Newton, who reportedly
began his investigations after seeing an apple fall from a tree,

you see some of the behaviors that weâll be exploring. Toss the
ball into the air to various heights, catching it in your hand as
it returns. Have a friend time the flight of the ball. As you toss
the ball higher, how much more time does it spend in the air?
How does it feel coming back to your hands? Is there any difference in the impact it makes? Which takes the ball longer:
rising from your hand to its peak height or returning from its
peak height back to your hand?
Now drop two different ballsâa baseball, say, and a golf
ball. If you drop them simultaneously, without pushing either
one up or down, does one ball strike the ground first or do they
arrive together? Now throw one ball horizontally while dropping
the second. If they both leave your hands at the same time and
the first oneâs initial motion is truly horizontal, which one
reaches the ground first?

Falling Balls

Weight and Gravity
Like everything else around us, a ball has a weight. For example, a golf ball weighs about
0.45 N (0.10 lbf)âbut what is weight? Evidently itâs a force, since both the newton (N) and
the pound-force (lbf) are units of force. To understand what weight is, howeverâand, in
particular, where it comes fromâwe need to look at gravity.
Gravity is a physical phenomenon that produces attractive forces between every pair
of objects in the universe. In our daily lives, however, the only object massive enough and
near enough to have obvious gravitational effects on us is our planet, Earth. Gravity weakens with distance; the moon and sun are so far away that we notice their gravities only
through such subtle effects as the ocean tides.
Earthâs gravity exerts a downward force on any object near its surface. That object is
attracted directly toward the center of Earth with a force we call the objectâs weight (Fig. 1.2.1).
Remarkably enough, this weight is exactly proportional to the objectâs massâif one ball has
twice the mass of another ball, it also has twice the weight. Such a relationship between weight
and mass is astonishing because weight and mass are very different attributes: weight is how
hard gravity pulls on a ball, and mass is how difficult that ball is to accelerate. Because of this
proportionality, a ball thatâs heavy is also hard to shake back and forth!
An objectâs weight is also proportional to the local strength of gravity, which is measured by a downward vector called the acceleration due to gravityâan odd name that Iâll
explain shortly. At the surface of Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is about 9.8 N/kg
(1.0 lbf/lbm). That value means that a mass of 1 kilogram has a weight of 9.8 newtons and
that a mass of 1 pound-mass has a weight of 1 pound-force.
More generally, an objectâs weight is equal to its mass times the acceleration due to
gravity, which can be written as a word equation:
weight = mass Âˇ acceleration due to gravity,

(1.2.1)

in symbols:
w = m Âˇ g,
and in everyday language:
You can lose weight either by reducing your mass or by going someplace, like a
small planet, where the gravity is weaker.
But why acceleration due to gravity? What acceleration do we mean? To answer that
question, letâs consider what happens to a ball when you drop it.
If the only force on the ball is its weight, the ball accelerates downward; in other words,
it falls. Although a ball moving through Earthâs atmosphere encounters additional forces due
to the air, letâs ignore those forces for the time being. Doing so costs us only a little in terms
of accuracyâthe airâs forces on the ball are negligible as long as the ball is dense and its
speed relatively smallâand allows us to focus exclusively on the effects of gravity.
How much does the falling ball accelerate? According to Eq. 1.1.1, the ballâs acceleration is equal to the net force exerted on it divided by its mass. Because the ball is falling,
however, the only force on it is its own weight. That weight, according to Eq. 1.2.1, is equal
to the ballâs mass times the acceleration due to gravity. Using a little algebra, we get
falling ballâs acceleration =
=

ballâs weight
ballâs mass
ballâs mass Âˇ acceleration due to gravity
ballâs mass

= acceleration due to gravity.

Fig. 1.2.1 A dropped
baseball experiences only
its weightâthe force due
to gravity. It accelerates
downward.

14

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

As you can see, the falling ballâs acceleration is equal to the acceleration due to gravity.
Thus, acceleration due to gravity really is an acceleration after all: itâs the acceleration of a
freely falling object. Moreover, the units of acceleration due to gravity can be transformed
easily from those relating weight to mass, 9.8 N/kg (1.0 lbf/lbm), into those describing the
acceleration of free fall, 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2).
Thus a ball falling near Earthâs surface experiences a downward acceleration of
9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2), regardless of its mass (Fig. 1.2.2). This downward acceleration is substantially more than that of an elevator starting its descent. When you drop a ball, it picks
up speed very quickly in the downward direction.
Because all falling objects at Earthâs surface accelerate downward at exactly the same
rate, a billiard ball and a bowling ball dropped simultaneously from the same height will
reach the ground together. (Remember that weâre not considering forces due to the air yet.)
Although the bowling ball weighs more than the billiard ball, it also has more mass; so
while the bowling ball experiences a larger downward force, its larger mass ensures that its
downward acceleration is equal to that of the lighter and less massive billiard ball.
Check Your Understanding #1: Weight and Mass
Out in deep space, far from any celestial object that exerts significant gravity, would an astronaut
weigh anything? Would that astronaut have a mass?
Answer: The astronaut would have zero weight but would still have a normal mass.
Why: Weight is a measure of the force exerted on the astronaut by gravity. Far from Earth or any other
large object, the astronaut would experience virtually no gravitational force and would have zero
weight. But mass is a measure of inertia and doesnât depend at all on gravity. Even in deep space, it
would be much harder to accelerate a school bus than to accelerate a baseball because the school
bus has more mass than the baseball.

Check Your Figures #1: Weighing In on the Moon
Youâre in your spacecraft on the surface of the moon. Before getting into your suit, you weigh yourself
and find that your moon weight is almost exactly one-sixth your Earth weight. What is the moonâs
acceleration due to gravity?
Answer: It is about 1.6 m/s2 (5.3 ft/s2).
Why: You can rearrange Eq. 1.2.1 to show that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to an
objectâs weight:
acceleration due to gravity =

weight
.
mass

Your mass doesnât change in going to the moon, so any change in your weight must be due to a
change in the acceleration due to gravity. Since your moon weight is one-sixth of your Earth weight,
the moonâs acceleration due to gravity must be one-sixth that of Earth, or about 1.6 m/s2.

Fig. 1.2.2 A baseball (left) and a golf ball (right)
both accelerate downward at the acceleration due to
gravity. Their differences in weight and mass perfectly
compensate for one another.

Falling Balls

The Velocity of a Falling Ball
Weâre now ready to examine the motion of a falling ball near Earthâs surface. A falling
ball is one that has only its weight, the force due to gravity, acting on it and gravity, as
weâve seen, causes any falling object to accelerate downward at a constant rate. However, weâre usually less interested in the falling objectâs acceleration than we are in its
position and velocity. Where will the object be in 3 s, and what will its velocity be
then? When youâre trying to summon up the courage to jump off the high dive, you
want to know how long itâll take you to reach the water and how fast youâll be going
when you hit.
The first step in answering these questions is to look at how a ballâs velocity is related
to the time youâve been watching it fall. To do that, youâll need to know the ballâs initial
velocityâthat is, its speed and direction at the moment you start watching it. If you drop
the ball from rest, its initial velocity is zero.
You can then describe the ballâs present velocity in terms of its initial velocity, its
acceleration, and the time that has passed since you started watching it. Because a constant
acceleration causes the ballâs velocity to change by the same amount each second, the ballâs
present velocity differs from its initial velocity by the acceleration times the time that
youâve been watching it. We can relate these quantities as a word equation:
present velocity = initial velocity + acceleration Âˇ time,

(1.2.2)

in symbols:
vf = vi + a Âˇ t,
and in everyday language:
A stone dropped from rest descends faster with each passing second, but you can
give it a boost by throwing it downward instead of just letting go.
For a ball falling from rest, the initial velocity is zero, the acceleration is downward at
9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2), and the time youâve been watching it is simply the time since it started
to drop (Fig. 1.2.3). After 1 s, the ball has a downward velocity of 9.8 m/s (32 ft/s). After
2 s, the ball has a downward velocity of 19.6 m/s (64 ft/s). After 3 s, its downward velocity
is 29.4 m/s (96 ft/s), and so on.
Because a ball falls in a three-dimensional world, Eq. 1.2.2 is a relationship among
vector quantities. When a ball is dropped from rest, however, its motion is strictly vertical
and all of those vector quantities point either up or down. In that special case of motion
along a vertical line, we can represent vector quantities that point up by ordinary positive
values and vector quantities that point down by ordinary negative values. The acceleration
due to gravity is then â9.8 m/s2, and a ball that has been falling from rest for 2 s has a
velocity of â19.6 m/s. As weâll see later in this section, those simplified values are actually
the upward components of the ballâs acceleration and velocity.

Check Your Understanding #2: Half a Fall
You drop a marble from rest, and after 1 s, its velocity is 9.8 m/s (32 ft/s) in the downward direction.
What was its velocity after only 0.5 s of falling?
Answer: 4.9 m/s (16 ft/s) in the downward direction.
Why: A freely falling object accelerates downward at a steady rate. Its velocity changes by 9.8 m/s
(16 ft/s) in the downward direction each and every second. In half a second, the marbleâs velocity
changes by only half that amount, or 4.9 m/s (16 ft/s).

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

Fig. 1.2.3 The moment you let go of a ball that was resting in your hand, it begins to fall. Its
weight causes it to accelerate downward. After 1 s, it has fallen 4.9 m and has a velocity of 9.8 m/s
downward. After 2 s, it has fallen 19.6 m and has a velocity of 19.6 m/s downward, and so on. As the
ball continues to accelerate downward, its velocity continues to increase downward. Negative values for
the position and velocity are meant to indicate downward movement caused by a negative or downward
acceleration.

Check Your Figures #2: The High Dive
If it takes you about 1.4 s to reach the water from the 10-m (32-ft) diving platform, how fast are you
going just before you enter the water?
Answer: About 14 m/s (45 ft/s, 50 km/h, or 31 mph).
Why: The downward acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2). You fall for 1.4 s, during which
time your velocity increases steadily in the downward direction. Since you start with zero velocity,
Eq. 1.2.2 gives a final velocity of
final velocity = 9.8 m/s2 Âˇ 1.4 s = 13.72 m/s.
Since the time of the fall is given only to two digits of accuracy (1.4 s could really be 1.403 s or
1.385 s), we shouldnât claim that our calculated final velocity is accurate to four digits. We should
round the value to 14 m/s (45 ft/s).

The Position of a Falling Ball
The ballâs velocity continues to increase as it falls, but where exactly is the ball located? To
answer that question, you need to know the ballâs initial positionâthat is, where it was
when you started to watch it fall. If you dropped the ball from rest, the initial position was
your hand and you can define that spot as 0.
You can then describe the ballâs present position in terms of its initial position, its
initial velocity, its acceleration, and the time that has passed since you started watching it.
However, because the ballâs velocity is changing, you canât simply multiply its present
velocity by the time that itâs been falling to determine how much the ballâs present position
differs from its initial position. Instead, you must use the ballâs average velocity during the
whole period youâve been watching it. Since the ballâs velocity has been changing uniformly from its initial velocity to its present velocity, the ballâs average velocity is exactly
halfway in between the two individual velocities:
average velocity = initial velocity + 12 Âˇ acceleration Âˇ time.

Falling Balls

17

The ballâs present position differs from its initial position by this average velocity times the
time that youâve been watching it. We can relate these quantities as a word equation:
present position= initial position +initial velocity Âˇ time+ 12 Âˇ accelerationÂˇ time2, (1.2.3)
in symbols:
xf = xi + vi Âˇ t + 12 Âˇ a Âˇ t2,
and in everyday language:
The longer a stone has been falling, the more its height diminishes with each
passing second. However, it wonât overtake a stone that was dropped next to it at
an earlier time or dropped from beneath it at the same time.
For a ball falling from rest, the initial velocity is zero, the acceleration is downward at
9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2), and the time youâve been watching it is simply the time since it started
to drop (Fig. 1.2.3). After 1 s, the ball has fallen 4.9 m (16 ft). After 2 s, it has fallen a total
of 19.6 m (64 ft). After 3 s, it has fallen a total of 44.1 m (145 ft), and so on.
Equations 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 depend on the definition of acceleration as the measure of
how quickly velocity changes and the definition of velocity as the measure of how quickly
position changes. Because the acceleration of a falling ball doesnât change with time, the
two equations can be derived using algebra. In more complicated situations, however,
where an objectâs acceleration changes with time, predicting position and velocity usually
requires the use of calculus. Calculus is the mathematics of change, invented by Newton to
address just these sorts of problems.
Weâve been discussing what happens to a falling ball, but we could have chosen
another object instead. Everything falls the same way; heavy or light, large or small, all
objects take the same amount of time to fall a given distance, as long as theyâre dense
enough to be unaffected by the air. If there were no air, this statement would be exactly true
for any object; a feather and a lead brick would plummet downward together if you dropped
them simultaneously.
Now that weâve explored acceleration due to gravity, we can see why a ball dropped
from a tall ladder is more dangerous than the same ball dropped from a short stool. The
farther the ball has to fall, the longer it takes to reach the ground and the more time it has
to accelerate. During its long fall from the tall ladder, the ball acquires a large downward
velocity and becomes very hard to stop. If you try to catch it, youâll have to exert a very
large upward force on it to accelerate it upward and bring it to rest quickly. Exerting that
large upward force may hurt your hand.
The same notion holds if youâre the falling object. If you leap off a tall ladder, a substantial amount of time will pass before you reach the ground. By the time you arrive,
youâll have acquired considerable downward velocity. The ground will then accelerate you
upward and bring you to rest with a very large and unpleasant upward force. (For an interesting and less painful application of long falls, see 4 .)

Check Your Understanding #3: Half a Fall Again
You drop a marble from rest, and after 1 s, it has fallen downward a distance of 4.9 m (16 ft). How
far had it fallen after only 0.5 s?
Answer: It had fallen about 1.2 m (4 ft).
Why: While a freely falling objectâs velocity changes steadily in the downward direction, its change in
height is more complicated. When you drop the marble from rest, it starts its descent slowly but picks
up speed and covers the downward distance faster and faster. In the first 0.5 s, it travels only a
quarter of the distance it travels in the first 1 s, or about 1.2 m (4 ft).

4 In 1782, William
Watts, a plumber from
Bristol, England, patented
a technique for forming
perfectly spherical,
seamless lead shot for use
in guns. His idea was to
pour molten lead through
a sieve suspended high
above a pool of water. The
lead droplets cool in the
air as they fall, solidifying
into perfect spheres before
reaching the water. Shot
towers based on this idea
soon appeared throughout
Europe and eventually in
the United States.
Nowadays, iron shot has
all but replaced environmentally dangerous lead
shot. Iron shot is cast,
rather than dropped,
because the longer cooling
time needed to solidify
molten iron would require
impractically tall shot
towers.

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

Check Your Figures #3: Extreme Physics
Youâre planning to construct a bungee-jumping amusement at the local shopping center. If you want
your customers to have a 5-s free-fall experience, how tall will you need to build the tower from which
theyâll jump? (Donât worry about the extra height needed to stop people after the bungee pulls taut.)
Answer: The tower should be about 122 m (402 ft or as high as a 40-story building).
Why: As they fall, the jumpers will travel downward at ever increasing speeds. Since the jumpers start
from rest and fall downward for 5 s, we can use Eq. 1.2.3 to determine how far they will fall:
final height = initial height â 12 Âˇ 9.8 m/s2 Âˇ (5 s) 2
= initial height â 122.5 m.
The downward acceleration is indicated here by the negative change in height. At the end of 5 s, the
jumpers will have fallen more than 122 m (402 ft) and will be traveling downward at about 50 m/s
(160 ft/s). The tower will need additional height to slow the jumpers down and begin bouncing them
back upward. Clearly, a 5-s free fall is pretty unrealistic. Try for a 2- or 3-s free fall instead.

Tossing the Ball Upward
If the only force acting on an object is its weight, then the object is falling. So far, weâve
explored this principle only as it pertains to balls dropped from rest. However, a thrown ball
is falling, too; once it leaves your hand, itâs subject only to its weight and it accelerates
downward at 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2).
Equation 1.2.2 still describes how the ballâs velocity depends on the fall time, but now the
initial velocity isnât zero. If you toss the ball straight up in the air, it leaves your hand with a
large upward velocity (Fig. 1.2.4). As soon as you let go of the ball, it begins to accelerate
downward. If the ballâs initial upward velocity is 29.4 m/s (96 ft/s), then after 1 s its upward
velocity is 19.6 m/s (64 ft/s). After another second, its upward velocity is only 9.8 m/s (32 ft/s).
After a third second, the ball momentarily comes to a complete stop with a velocity of zero. It
then descends from this peak height, falling just as it did when you dropped it from rest.
The ballâs flight before and after its peak is symmetrical. It travels upward quickly at
first, since it has a large upward velocity. As its upward velocity diminishes, it travels more
and more slowly until it comes to a stop. It then begins to descend, slowly at first and then
faster and faster as it continues its constant downward acceleration. The time the ball takes
to rise from its initial position in your hand to its peak height is exactly equal to the time it
takes to descend back down from that peak to your hand. Equation 1.2.3 indicates how the
position of the ball depends on the fall time, with the initial velocity being the upward
velocity of the ball as it leaves your hand.

Fig. 1.2.4 The moment you let go of a ball
thrown straight upward, it begins to accelerate
downward at 9.8 m/s2. The ball rises but its
upward velocity diminishes steadily until it
momentarily comes to a stop. It then descends
with its downward velocity increasing steadily. In
this example, the ball rises for 3 s and comes to
rest. It then descends for 3 s before returning to
your hand in a very symmetrical flight.

Falling Balls

19

The larger the initial upward velocity of the ball, the longer it rises and the higher it
goes before its velocity is reduced to zero. It then descends for the same amount of time it
spent rising. The higher the ball goes before it begins to descend, the longer it takes to
return to the ground and the faster itâs traveling when it arrives. Thatâs why catching a high
fly ball with your bare hands stings so much: the ball is traveling very, very fast when it hits
your hands, and a large force is required to bring the ball to rest quickly.

Check Your Understanding #4: A Toss-Up
You toss a coin straight up, and it rises well above your head. At the moment the coin reaches its
peak height, what is its velocity? Is that velocity constant or changing with time? Is the coinâs acceleration constant or changing with time?
Answer: The coinâs velocity is momentarily zero at its peak, but that velocity is changing with time.
The coinâs acceleration, however, is constantâthe acceleration due to gravity.
Why: Once the coin leaves your hand, itâs a falling object and constantly accelerates downward at the
acceleration due to gravity. Because it begins its fall traveling upward, it rises at a gradually decreasing speed, is momentarily motionless at its peak, and then descends at a gradually increasing speed.

How a Thrown Ball Moves: Projectile Motion
What happens if you donât toss the ball exactly straight up? Suppose you throw the ball
upward at some angle. The ball still rises to a peak height and then descends, but it also
travels away from you horizontally so that it strikes the ground at some distance from
your feet. How much does this horizontal travel complicate the motion of a falling ball?
The answer is not very much. One of the beautiful simplifications of physics is that
you can often treat an objectâs vertical motion independently of its horizontal motion. This
technique involves separating the vector quantitiesâacceleration, velocity, and positionâ
into components, those portions of the quantities that lie along specific directions (Fig. 1.2.5).
For example, the upward component of an objectâs position is that objectâs altitude.
A ballâs altitude, however, is only part of its position; you still need to know where it
is in relation to your right or left and to your front or back. In fact, you can specify its position (or any other vector quantity) in terms of three components along three directions that
are perpendicular to one another. This means that you can completely specify the ballâs
position by its distance to your right, its distance in front of you, and its altitude above you.
If itâs to your left, behind you, or below you, the corresponding components have negative
values. For example, the ball might be 3 m to your right, â3 m in front of you (which is
3 m behind you), and 2 m above you.
When you drop the ball from rest or toss it straight up, its motion is entirely vertical and
only the upward components of its position, velocity, and acceleration are important. When
the falling ball is also moving horizontally, however, youâll need to pay attention to the
rightward and forward components of those vector quantities. Throwing the ball forward
helps because it eliminates any rightward components of the motion. The ball then arcs
forward with a position specified at each moment by its altitude (its upward component) and
its distance downfield (its forward component).
Although Eqs. 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 were introduced to describe a ballâs vertical motion, they
also describe its horizontal motion. More generally, they relate three vector quantitiesâ
the ballâs position, velocity, and constant accelerationâto one another and describe how
the ballâs position and velocity change with time when that ball undergoes constant acceleration in any direction. Of course, since weâre concerned now with falling balls, the relevant constant acceleration is the downward acceleration due to gravity.
These equations also apply to the components of the ballâs position, velocity, and constant acceleration. If you add the words upward component of in front of each vector quantity

Fig. 1.2.5 Even if the
ball has a velocity that
is neither purely vertical
nor purely horizontal, its
velocity may nonetheless
be viewed as having an
upward component and a
downfield component. Part
of its total velocity acts to
move this ball upward, and
part of its total velocity acts
to move this ball downfield.

20

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

Fig. 1.2.6 This golf ball
drifts steadily to the right
after being thrown because
gravity affects only the
ballâs upward component
of velocity.

Fig. 1.2.7 If you throw a
ball upward, at an angle, part
of the initial velocity will be
in the upward direction and
part will be in the downfield
direction. The vertical and
horizontal motions will take
place independently of one
another. The ball will rise
and fall just as it did in Figs.
1.2.3 and 1.2.4; at the
same time, however, it will
move downfield. Because
there is no horizontal
component of acceleration
(gravity acts only in the
vertical direction), the
downfield component of
velocity remains constant
during the ballâs 6-s trip.

in Eqs. 1.2.2 and 1.2.3, the equations correctly describe the ballâs vertical motion. Now itâs
time to add the words forward component of to those equations so that they describe the ballâs
horizontal motion.
Once youâve thrown the ball forward and are no longer touching it, its motion can be
broken into two parts: its upward motion and its forward motion (Fig. 1.2.5). Part of the
ballâs initial velocity is in the upward direction, and that upward component of velocity
determines the objectâs ascent and descent. Part of the ballâs initial velocity is in the forward
direction, and that forward component of velocity determines the ballâs progress downfield.
Because the ball is accelerating straight downward, the forward component of its
acceleration is zero and the forward component of its velocity thus remains constant. The
ball travels downfield at a steady rate throughout its flight (Fig. 1.2.6). Overall, the upward
component of the ballâs initial velocity determines how high the ball goes and how long it
stays aloft before striking the ground, while the forward component of the initial velocity
determines how quickly the ball travels downfield during its time aloft (Fig. 1.2.7).
Just before the ball hits the ground it still has its original forward component of
velocity, but its upward component of velocity is now negativeâthe ball is moving
downward. The total velocity of the ball is composed of these two components. The ball
starts with its velocity directed up and forward, and finishes with its velocity directed
down and forward.
If you want a ball or shot put to hit the ground as far from your feet as possible, you
should keep it aloft for a long time and give it a sizable forward component of velocity; in
other words, you must achieve a good balance between the upward and forward components
of velocity (Fig. 1.2.8). These components of velocity together determine the ballâs flight
path, its trajectory. If you throw the ball straight up, it will stay aloft for a long time but will
not travel downfield at all (and you will need to wear a helmet). If you throw the ball directly
forward, it will travel downfield quickly but hit the ground almost immediately.
Neglecting air resistance and the altitude difference between your throwing arm and
the ground that the ball will eventually hit, your best choice is to throw the ball forward
at an angle of 45Â° above horizontal. At that angle, the initial upward component of velocity will be the same as the initial forward component of velocity. The ball will stay aloft
for a reasonably long time and will make good use of that time to move downfield. Other
angles wonât make such good use of the initial speed to move the ball downfield.
(A discussion of how to determine the upward and forward components of velocity
appears in Appendix A, online.)

Fig. 1.2.8 If you want the ball to hit the ground as far
from your feet as possible, given a certain initial speed,
throw the ball at 45Â° above horizontal. Halfway between
horizontal and vertical, such a throw gives the ball equal
initial upward and downfield components of velocity. The
ball then stays aloft for a relatively long time and makes
good use of that flight time to travel downfield.

These same ideas apply to two baseballs, one dropped from a cliff and the other thrown
directly forward from that same cliff. If both leave your hands at the same time, they will
both hit the ground below at the same time (Fig. 1.2.9). The fact that the second ball has an
initial forward velocity doesnât affect the time it takes to descend to the ground because the
horizontal and vertical motions are independent. Of course, the ball thrown directly forward will strike the ground far from the base of the cliff, while the dropped ball will land
directly below your hand.
Check Your Understanding #5: Aim High
Why must a sharpshooter or an archer aim somewhat above her target? Why canât she simply aim
directly at the bullâs-eye to hit it?
Answer: The bullet or arrow will fall in flight, so she must compensate for its loss of height.

Fig. 1.2.9 When these
two balls were dropped,
they accelerated downward
at the constant rate of
9.8 m/s2 and their
velocities increased
steadily in the downward
direction. Even though
one of them was initially
moving to the right, they
descended together.

Why: To hit the bullâs-eye, the sharpshooter or archer must aim above the bullâs-eye because the
projectile will fall in flight. Even if the target is higher or lower than the sharpshooter, the projectile
will fall below the point at which she is aiming. The longer the bullet or arrow is in flight, the more it
will fall and the higher she must aim. As the distance to the target increases, the flight time increases
and her aim must move upward.

Ramps
In the previous section, we looked at what happens to an
object experiencing only a single force, its weight. But what
happens to objects that experience two or more forces at the
same time? Imagine, for example, an object resting on the
floor. That object experiences both its downward weight and
an upward force from the floor. If the floor is level, the object
doesnât accelerate; but if the floor is tilted, so that it forms a
ramp, the object accelerates downhill. In this section, weâll
examine the motion of objects traveling along ramps. In addition to making sports such as skateboarding and skiing more
fun, ramps are common tools that help us lift and move heavy
objects.

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

Experiments to Do: Place an unbreakable water bottle on a
level table or board. Hold the bottle steady for a second and
then let go of it without pushing on it. Why does the bottle
remain motionless?
Now, equip yourself with a pencil. Have a friend tilt the
surface of the table or board slightly so that the bottle begins
to roll downhill. Can you stop the bottle by pushing on it with
the pencil? Place the bottle back on the table and have your
friend tilt the table more sharply. Does the tilt of the table

affect your ability to stop the bottle from rolling downhill? Now
try to push the bottle uphill with the pencil (1) when the table
is slightly tilted and (2) when it is more sharply tilted. Which
task requires more force? Why?
Evidently a gentle push is all that may be needed to
raise a relatively heavy object if you use a ramp to help you.
To understand why this feat is possible, we need to explore
a handful of physical concepts and a few basic laws of
motion.

A Piano on the Sidewalk

ÂŠ SSPL via/Getty Images, Inc.

Imagine that you have a friend whoâs a talented but undiscovered pianist. Sheâs renting a
new apartment, and because she canât afford professional movers (Fig. 1.3.1), sheâs asked
you to help her move her baby grand. Fortunately, her new apartment is only on the second
floor. The two of you still face a difficult challenge, however: how do you get that heavy
piano up there? More important, how do you keep it from falling on you during the move?
The problem is that you canât push upward hard enough to lift the entire piano at once.
One solution to this problem, of course, would be to break the piano into pieces and carry
them up one by one. This method has obvious drawbacksâyour friend isnât expecting a
firewood delivery. A better solution would be to find something else to help you push
upward, and one of your best choices is the simple machine known as a ramp.
Throughout the ages, ramps, also known as inclined planes, have made tasks like
piano-moving possible. Because ramps can exert the enormous upward forces needed to lift
stone and steel, theyâve been essential building equipment since the days of the pyramids. To
see how ramps provide these lifting forces, weâll continue to explore the example of the
piano, looking first at the force that the piano experiences when it touches a surface. For the
time being, weâll continue to ignore friction and forces due to the air; they will needlessly
complicate our discussion. Besides, as long as the piano is on wheels, friction is negligible.
With the piano resting on the sidewalk outside the apartment, you make a startling
discovery: the piano is not falling. Has gravity disappeared? The answer to that question
would be painfully obvious if your foot were underneath one of the pianoâs wheels. No, the
pianoâs weight is still all there. But something is happening at the surface of the sidewalk
to keep the piano from falling. Letâs take a careful look at the situation.
To begin with, the piano is clearly pushing down hard on the sidewalk. Thatâs why
youâre keeping your toes out of the way. But the presence of a new downward force on the
sidewalk doesnât explain why the piano isnât falling. Instead, we must look at the sidewalkâs
response to the pianoâs downward push: the sidewalk pushes upward on the piano! You can
feel this response by leaning over and pushing down on the sidewalk with your handâthe
sidewalk will push back. Those two forces, your downward push on the sidewalk and its
upward push on your hand, are exactly equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
This observationâthat two things exert equal but opposite forces on one another, isnât
unique to sidewalks, pianos, or hands; in fact, itâs always true. If you push on any object,
that object will push back on you with an equal amount of force in exactly the opposite
direction. This ruleâoften expressed as âfor every action, there is an equal but opposite
reactionââis known as Newtonâs third law of motion, the last of his three laws.

NEWTONâS THIRD LAW OF MOTION
Fig. 1.3.1 A ramp would
make this move much
easier.

For every force that one object exerts on a second object, there is an equal but oppositely directed force that the second object exerts on the first object.

Ramps

The universality of this law is astounding. Whether an object is large or small, hard or
soft, stationary or faster than a rocket, if you can push on it, it will push back on you with
an equal but oppositely directed force.
In the present case, the sidewalk and piano push on one another with equal but oppositely directed forces. Of this pair of equal-but-opposite forces, only one force acts on the
piano: the sidewalkâs upward push. This upward push on the piano is what keeps the piano
from falling. Weâve solved the mystery.

INTUITION ALERT: Action and Reaction
Intuition says that, when you push an object thatâs moving away from you, it pushes back more
gently on you than you push on it and that, when you push an object thatâs moving toward you, it
pushes back harder on you than you push on it.
Physics says that when you push on an object, it always pushes back on you exactly as hard as
you push on it.
Resolution: Itâs difficult to push on an object thatâs moving away from you, so you naturally push
on it more gently than you expect. The gentle force it exerts on you is simply an equal but oppositely directed response to your gentle force on it. In contrast, itâs difficult not to push strongly on
an object thatâs moving toward you, so you naturally push on it harder than you expect. The strong
force it exerts on you is again an equal but oppositely direct response to your strong force on it.

SUMMARY OF NEWTONâS LAWS OF MOTION
1. An object that is not subject to any outside forces moves at a constant velocity,
covering equal distances in equal times along a straight-line path.
2. The net force exerted on an object is equal to that objectâs mass times its acceleration. The acceleration is in the same direction as the force.
3. For every force that one object exerts on a second object, there is an equal but
oppositely directed force that the second object exerts on the first object.

Check Your Understanding #1: Swinging
You are pushing a child on a playground swing. If you exert a 50-N (11-lbf) force on him as he is
swinging away from you, how much force will he exert back on you?
Answer: He will exert 50 N (11 lbf) on you.
Why: Whenever you exert a 50-N force on an object, whether itâs moving or stationary, it will exert a
50-N force back on you. There are no exceptions. If that object is a friend, it doesnât matter whether
she is stationary or moving or wearing roller skates or even sound asleep; she will push back with
50 N of force. She has no choice in the matter. Similarly, if someone pushes on you, you will feel
yourself pushing back. Thatâs how Newtonâs third law works.

Looking for Support and Adding Up the Forces
Although weâve figured out why the piano isnât falling, we still donât know what type of
force the sidewalk is using to hold it up or why that upward force so perfectly balances the
pianoâs downward weight.
Letâs begin with the type of force. Since two objects canât occupy the same space at the
same time, their surfaces push apart whenever theyâre in contact. They exert support forces

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

Fig. 1.3.2 A piano
resting on the sidewalk.
The sidewalk exerts an
upward support force that
exactly balances the pianoâs
downward weight. The net
force on the piano is zero, so
the piano doesnât accelerate.
5 Forces that are directed

surfaces are called
normal forces, since the
term normal is used by
mathematicians to
describe something that

a surfaceâat a right angle
or perpendicular to that

on one another, each pushing the other directly away from its surfaceâthe direction normal or perpendicular to its surface (see 5 ). Since the sidewalk is horizontal, the support
force it exerts on the piano is verticalâstraight up (Fig. 1.3.2).
How large is that support force? To answer this question, suppose the sidewalkâs support force were strong enough to make the piano accelerate upward. The piano would soon
lift off the sidewalk, and as their surfaces stopped touching, the sidewalkâs support force on
the piano would grow weaker. Alternatively, suppose the sidewalkâs support force was
weak enough to let the piano accelerate downward. The piano would soon drop into the
sidewalk, and as their surfaces overlapped more, the sidewalkâs support force on the piano
would grow stronger.
Because of these behaviors, the sidewalkâs upward support force on the piano adjusts
automatically until it exactly balances the pianoâs downward weight and the piano accelerates neither up nor down. When you sit on the piano during a break, the sidewalkâs upward
support force quickly readjusts to balance your weight as well.
Another way to state that the upward support force on the piano exactly balances the
pianoâs downward weight is to say that the net force on the piano is zero, meaning that the
sum of all the forces on the piano is zero. Objects often experience more than one force at
a time, and itâs the net force, together with the objectâs mass, that determines how it accelerates. When you and your friend push the piano in the same direction, your forces add up,
assisting one another so that the piano accelerates in that direction (Fig. 1.3.3a). When the
two of you push the piano in opposite directions, your forces oppose and at least partially
cancel one another (Fig. 1.3.3b).
When the two of you push the piano at an angle with respect to one another, the net
force points somewhere in between. For example, if you push the piano eastward while
your friend pushes it northward, the net force will point to the northeast and the piano will
accelerate in that direction (Fig. 1.3.3c). The precise angle of the net force and the pianoâs
subsequent acceleration depend on exactly how hard each person pushes. For most of the
following discussion, weâll need only a rough estimate of the net forceâs magnitude and
direction, and weâll obtain that estimate using common sense.
Apart from direction, thereâs one crucial difference between the force that gravity
exerts on the piano and the support force that the sidewalk exerts on it. While the pianoâs
weight is dispersed throughout the piano, the sidewalkâs upward support force acts only on
the pianoâs wheels. Even when the net force on the piano is zero, having individual forces
act on it at different locations can lead to considerable stress within the piano. If it werenât
built so well, the piano might lose a leg or two during the move.

Fig. 1.3.3 When several forces act simultaneously on an object, the object responds to the sum of the
forces. This sum is called the net force, and it has both a magnitude and a direction. Here, as elsewhere
in this book, the length of each force arrow indicates its magnitude. You can sum the forces graphically by
arranging the force arrows in sequence, head to tail. The net force arrow then points from the tail of the first
arrow to the head of the last arrow. Some of the force arrows are shown displaced slightly for clarity, a shift
that doesnât affect the summing process.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Newtonâs Third Law and Balanced Forces
Misconception: When you push on an object and it pushes back on you, those two equal-butopposite forces somehow cancel one another perfectly and therefore have no effect on either you
or the object.
Resolution: The two forces described by Newtonâs third law always act on two different things.
Your push acts on the object, while the objectâs push acts on you. Since the object accelerates in
response to the net force it experiencesâthe sum of all the individual forces acting on itâit is
affected only by your force on it, not by its force on you. If you are the only thing pushing on it, it
will accelerate. If the object is the only thing pushing on you, youâll accelerate, too!

Check Your Understanding #2: Riding the Elevator
As you ride upward in an elevator at a constant velocity, what two forces act on your body and what
is the net force on you?
Answer: The two forces are your downward weight and an upward support force from the floor. They
balance, so that the net force on you is zero.
Why: Whenever anything is moving with constant velocity, itâs not accelerating and thus has zero net
force on it. Although the elevator is moving upward, the fact that you are not accelerating means that
the car must exert an upward support force on you that exactly balances your weight. You experience
zero net force.

What the Piano Needs: Energy
As you approach the task of lifting your friendâs piano into her apartment, you might begin
to worry about safety. There is clearly a difference between the piano resting on the sidewalk and the piano suspended on a board just outside the second-floor apartment. After all,
which one would you rather be sitting beneath? The elevated piano has something that the
piano on the sidewalk doesnât have: the ability to do thingsâto break the board, to produce
motion, and to squash whatever is beneath it. This capacity to make things happen is called
energy, and the process of making them happen is called work.
Energy and work are both important physical quantities, meaning that both are measurable. For example, you can measure the amount of energy in the suspended piano and
the amount of work the piano does when the board breaks and it falls to the sidewalk. As
you may suspect, the physical definitions of energy and work are somewhat different from
those of common English. Physical energy isnât the exuberance of a child at the amusement park or whatâs contained in a so-called âenergy drinkâ; instead, itâs defined as the
capacity to do work. Similarly, physical work doesnât refer to activities at the office or in
the yard; instead, it refers to the process of transferring energy.
Energy is whatâs transferred, and work does the transferring. The most important characteristic of energy is that itâs conserved. In physics, a conserved quantity is one that canât
be created or destroyed but that can be transferred between objects or, in the case of energy,
be converted from one form to another. Conserved quantities are very special in physics;
there are only a few of them. An object that has energy canât simply make that energy disappear; it can only get rid of energy by giving it to another object, and it makes this transfer
by doing work on that object.
The relationship between energy and work is analogous to the relationship between
money and spending: money is what is transferred, and spending does the transferring.
Sensible, law-abiding citizens donât create or destroy money; instead, they transfer it
among themselves through spending. Just as the most interesting aspect of money is spending it, so the most interesting aspect of energy is doing work with it. We can define money
as the capacity to spend, just as we define energy as the capacity to do work.

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

So far weâve been using a circular definition: work is the transfer of energy, and energy
is the capacity to do work. But what is involved in doing work on an object? You do work
on an object by exerting a force on it as it moves in the direction of that force. As you throw
a ball, exerting a forward force on the ball as the ball moves forward, you do work on the
ball; as you lift a rock, pushing the rock upward as it moves upward, you do work on the
rock. In both cases, you transfer energy from yourself to an object by doing work on it.
This transferred energy is often apparent in the object. When you throw a ball, it
picks up speed and undergoes an increase in kinetic energy, energy of motion that allows
the ball to do work on whatever it hits. When you lift a rock, it shifts farther from Earth
and undergoes an increase in gravitational potential energy, energy stored in the gravitational forces between the rock and Earth that allows the rock to do work on whatever
it falls on. In general, potential energy is energy stored in the forces between or within
objects.
Returning to the task at hand, itâs now apparent that raising the piano to the second-floor
apartment is going to increase the pianoâs gravitational potential energy by a substantial
amount. Since energy is a conserved quantity, this additional energy must come from
something else. Unfortunately, that something is you! To deliver the piano, you are going
to have to provide it with the gravitational potential energy it needs by doing exactly that
amount of work on it. As weâll see, you can do that work the hard way by carrying it up a
ladder or the easy way by pushing it up a ramp.

Check Your Understanding #3: No Shortage of Energy
Do any of these objects have energy they can spare: a compressed spring, an inflated toy balloon, a
stick of dynamite, and a falling ball?
Answer: Yes, they all do.
Why: Each of these four objects can easily do work on you and thereby give you some of its spare
energy. It does this work by pushing on you as you move in the direction of that push.

Lifting the Piano: Doing Work
To do work on an object, you must push on it while it moves in the direction of your push.
The work you do on it is the force you exert on it times the distance it travels along the
direction of your force. We can express this relationship as a word equation:
work = force Âˇ distance,

(1.3.1)

in symbols:
W = F Âˇ d,
and in everyday language:
If youâre not pushing or itâs not moving, then youâre not working.
This simple relationship assumes that your force is constant while youâre doing the work.
If your force varies, the calculation of work will have to recognize that variation and may
require the use of calculus.
Calculating the work you do is easy if the object moves exactly in the direction of
your constant push; you simply multiply your force times the distance the object travels.
However, if the object doesnât move in the direction of your push, you must multiply your

Ramps

force times the component of the objectâs motion that lies along the direction of your
force.
As long as the angle between your force and the objectâs motion is small, you can often
ignore this complication. However, as the angle becomes larger, the work you do on the
object decreases. When the object moves at right angles to your force, the work you do on
it drops to zeroâitâs not moving along the direction of your force at all. And for angles
larger than 90Â°, the object moves opposite your force and the work you do on it actually
becomes negative!
Recalling that forces always come in equal but oppositely directed pairs, we can now
explain why energy is conserved: whenever you do work on an object, that object simultaneously does an equal amount of negative work on you! After all, if you push an object
and it moves along the direction of your force, then it pushes back on you and you move
along the direction opposite its force. You do positive work on it, and it does negative
work on you.
For example, when you lift the piano to judge its weight, you push it up as it moves up
and thus do work on it. At the same time, the piano pushes your hand down but your hand
moves up, so it does negative work on your hand. Overall, the pianoâs energy increases by
exactly the same amount that your energy decreasesâa perfect transfer! The energy that
youâre losing is mostly food energy, a form of chemical potential energy, and the energy the
piano is gaining is mostly gravitational potential energy.
When you lower the piano after realizing that itâs too heavy to carry up a ladder, the
process is reversed and the piano transfers energy back to you. Now the piano does work
on you, and you do an equal amount of negative work on the piano. The piano is losing
mostly gravitational potential energy, and you are gaining mostly thermal energyâa disordered form of energy that weâll examine in Section 2.2. Unlike a rubber band, your body
just isnât good at storing work done on it, so it simply gets hotter. Nonetheless, itâs usually
easier to have work done on you than to do work on something else. Thatâs why itâs easier
to lower objects than to lift them.
Finally, when you hold the piano motionless above the pavement, while waiting for
your friend to reinstall the wheel that fell off, you and the piano do no work on one another.
You are simply converting chemical potential energy from your last meal into thermal
energy in your muscles and getting overheated, probably in more ways than one.

CONSERVED QUANTITY: ENERGY

TRANSFERRED BY: WORK

Energy: The capacity to do work. Energy has no direction. It can be hidden as potential
energy.
Kinetic energy: The form of energy contained in an objectâs motion.
Potential energy: The form of energy stored in the forces between or within objects.
Work: The mechanical means for transferring energy; work = force Âˇ distance.

Check Your Understanding #4: Pitching
When you throw a baseball horizontally, youâre not pushing against gravity. Are you doing any work on
the baseball?
Answer: Yes.
Why: Any time you exert a force on an object and the object moves in the direction of that force, you
are doing work on the object. Since gravity doesnât affect horizontal motion, the work you do on the
baseball as you throw it ends up in the baseball as kinetic energy (energy of motion). As anyone who
has been hit by a pitch can attest, a moving baseball has more energy than a stationary baseball.

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

Check Your Figures #1: Light Work, Heavy Work
You are moving books to a new shelf, 1.20 m (3.94 ft) above the old shelf. The books weigh 10.0 N
(2.25 lbf) each, and you have 10 of them to move. How much work must you do on them as you move
them? Does it matter how many you move at once?
Answer: It takes 120 N Âˇ m (88.6 ft Âˇ lbf), no matter how many you lift at once.
Why: To keep each book from accelerating downward, you must support its weight with an upward
force of 10.0 N. You must then move it upward 1.20 m. The work you do pushing upward on the book
as it moves upward is given by Eq. 1.3.1:
work = force Âˇ distance = 10.0 N Âˇ 1.20 m = 12.0 N Âˇ m.
It takes 12.0 N Âˇ m of work to lift each book, whether you lift it together with other books or all by
itself. The total work you must do on all 10 books is 120 N Âˇ m.

Gravitational Potential Energy
How much work would you do on the piano while lifting it straight up a ladder to the apartment?
Apart from a little extra shove to get the piano moving upward, lifting it would entail supporting
the pianoâs weight while it coasted upward at constant velocity from the sidewalk to the second
floor. Since you would be pushing upward on the piano with a force equal in amount to its
weight, the work you would do on it would be its weight times the distance you lifted it.
As the piano rises in this scenario, its gravitational potential energy increases by an
amount equal to the work you do on it. If we agree that the piano has zero gravitational
potential energy when it rests on the sidewalk, then the suspended pianoâs gravitational
potential energy is simply its weight times its height above the sidewalk. Since the pianoâs
weight is equal to its mass times the acceleration due to gravity, its gravitational potential
energy is its mass times the acceleration due to gravity times its height above the sidewalk.
These ideas arenât limited to pianos. You can determine the gravitational potential
energy of any object by multiplying its mass times the acceleration due to gravity times its
height above the level at which its gravitational potential energy is zero. This relationship
can be expressed as a word equation:
gravitational potential energy = mass Âˇ acceleration due to gravity Âˇ height,

(1.3.2)

in symbols:
U = m Âˇ g Âˇ h,
and in common language:
The higher it was, the harder it hit.
Of course, if you know the objectâs weight, you can use it in place of the objectâs mass
times the acceleration due to gravity.
So what is the pianoâs gravitational potential energy when it reaches the second floor?
If it weighs 2000 N (450 lbf) and the second floor is 5 m (16 ft) above the sidewalk, you
will have done 10,000 N Âˇ m (about 7200 ft Âˇ lbf) of work in lifting it up there, and the
pianoâs gravitational potential energy will thus be 10,000 N Âˇ m. The newton-meter is the
SI unit of energy and work; itâs so important that it has its own name, the joule (abbreviated J).
At the second floor, the pianoâs gravitational potential energy is 10,000 J.
A few everyday examples should give you a feeling for how much energy a joule is.
Lifting a liter bottle of water 10 centimeters (4 inches) upward requires about 1 J of work.

Ramps

29

A 1500-watt hairdryer needs 1500 J every second to operate. Your body is able to extract
about 2,000,000 J from a slice of cherry pie. When youâre bicycling or rowing hard, your
body can do about 1000 J of work each second. A typical flashlight battery has about
10,000 J of stored energy.

Check Your Understanding #5: Mountain Biking
Bicycling to the top of a mountain is much harder than rolling back down to the bottom. At which
place do you have the most gravitational potential energy?
Answer: You have the most at the top of the mountain.
Why: Bicycling up the mountain is hard because you must do work against the force of gravity. This
work is stored as an increasing gravitational potential energy on your way uphill. Gravity then does
work on you as you roll downhill and your gravitational potential energy decreases.

Check Your Figures #2: Watch Out Below
If you carry a U.S. penny (0.0025 kg) to the top of the Empire State Building (443.2 m, or 1453.7 ft),
how much gravitational potential energy will it have?
Answer: About 11 J.
Why: The pennyâs gravitational potential energy is given by Eq. 1.3.2:
gravitational potential energy = 0.0025 kg Âˇ 9.8 N/kg Âˇ 443.2 m
= 11 N Âˇ m = 11 J.
This 11-J increase in energy would be quite evident if you were to drop the penny. In principle, the
penny could accelerate to very high speed (up to 340 km/h or 210 mph) and do lots of damage when
it hit the ground. Fortunately, a falling penny actually tumbles through the air, which slows it to about
40 km/h or 25 mph.

Lifting the Piano with a Ramp
Unfortunately, you probably canât carry a grand piano up a ladder by yourself. You need a
ramp, both to help you support the piano and to make it easier for you to raise the piano to
the second floor.
Like the sidewalk, a ramp exerts a support force on the piano to prevent the piano from
passing through its surface. However, since the ramp isnât exactly horizontal, that support
force isnât exactly vertical (Fig. 1.3.4). The pianoâs weight still points straight down, but
since the rampâs support force doesnât point straight up, the two forces canât balance one
another. There is a nonzero net force on the piano.
This net force canât point into or out of the ramp. If it did, the piano would accelerate
into or out of the ramp and the two objects would soon either lose contact or travel through
one another. Instead, the net force points exactly along the surface of the rampâa direction
tangent or parallel to the surface. More specifically, it points directly downhill, so the piano
accelerates down the ramp!
However, because this net force is much smaller than the pianoâs weight, the pianoâs
acceleration down the ramp is slower than if it were falling freely. This effect is familiar to
anyone who has bicycled downhill or watched a cup slip slowly off a tilted table. Although
gravity is still responsible, these objects accelerate more slowly than they would if falling
and in the direction of the downward slope.

Fig. 1.3.4 When a piano is
on a ramp, its weight and the
rampâs support force donât
cancel. Instead, they sum
to a downhill ramp force. If
no other forces act on the
piano, the ramp force is its
net force and it accelerates
downhill.

Fig. 1.3.5 To lift a piano
weighing 2000 N, you can
either (a) push it straight up
or (b) push it along a ramp.
To keep the piano moving
at a constant velocity,
you must make sure it
experiences a net force of
zero. If you lift it straight up
the ladder in (a), you must
exert an upward lifting force
of 2000 N to balance the
pianoâs downward weight.
If you push it up the ramp
shown in (b), you will only
have to push the piano
uphill with a force of 200 N
to give the piano a net force
of zero.

Therein lies the beauty of the ramp. By putting the piano on a ramp, you let the ramp
support most of the pianoâs weight. The piano experiences only a small residual force,
which I call a ramp force, pushing it downhill along the ramp. If you now push uphill on
the piano with a force that exactly balances that downhill ramp force, the net force on the
piano drops to zero and the piano stops accelerating. If you push uphill a little harder, the
piano will accelerate up the ramp!
How does the ramp change the job of moving the piano? Suppose that you build a ramp
50 m (164 ft) long that extends from the sidewalk to the apartmentâs balcony, 5 m (16.4 ft)
above the pavement. This ramp is sloped so that traveling 50 m uphill along its surface lifts
the piano only 5 m upward (Fig. 1.3.5). Because of the rampâs 10 to 1 ratio between distance
traveled along its surface and altitude change, you can push the 2000-N (450-lbf) piano up
it at constant velocity with a force of only 200 N (45 lbf). Most people can push that hard,
so the moving job is now realistic. To reach the apartment, you must push the piano 50 m
along this ramp with a force of 200 N so that you will do a total of 10,000 J of work.
By pushing the piano up the ramp, youâve used physical principles to help you perform
a task that would otherwise have been nearly impossible. You didnât get something for
nothing, however. The ramp is much longer than the ladder, and you have had to push the
piano for a longer distance to raise it to the second floor. Of course, you have had to push
with less force.
Remarkably, the amount of work you do in either case is 10,000 J. When you carry
the piano up the ladder, the force you exert is large but the distance the piano travels in the
direction of that force is small. When you push the piano up the ramp, the force is small
but the distance is large. Either way, the final result is the same: the piano ends up on the
second floor with an additional 10,000 J of gravitational potential energy and you have
done 10,000 J of work. Expressed graphically in an equation, this relationship appears as:
work = large force Âˇ small distance = small force Âˇ large distance.
In the absence of friction, the amount of work you do on the piano to get it to the second floor doesnât depend on how you raise it. No matter how you move that piano up to the
second floor, its gravitational potential energy will increase by 10,000 J, so youâll have to
do 10,000 J of work on it. Even if you disassemble the piano into parts, carry them individually up the stairs, and reconstruct the piano in your friendâs living room, you will have
done 10,000 J of work lifting the piano.
Unless youâre an experienced piano tuner, youâll probably be better off sticking with
the ramp. It offers an easy method for one person to lift a baby grand piano. The ramp
provides mechanical advantage, the process whereby a mechanical device redistributes
the amounts of force and distance that go into performing a specific amount of mechanical
work. In moving the piano with the help of the ramp, youâve performed a task that would
normally require a large force over a small distance by supplying a small force over a large
distance. You might wonder whether the ramp itself does any work on the piano; it doesnât.
Although the ramp exerts a support force on the piano and the piano moves along the
rampâs surface, this force and the distance traveled are at right angles to one another. The
ramp does no work on the piano.
Mechanical advantage occurs in many situations involving ramps. For example, it
appears when you ride a bicycle up a hill. Climbing a gradual hill takes far less uphill force
than climbing a steep hill of the same height. Since your pedaling ultimately provides the
uphill force, itâs much easier to climb the gradual hill than the steep one. Of course, you
must travel a longer distance along the road as you climb the gradual hill than you do on
the steep hill, so the work you do is the same in either case.
Ramps and inclined planes show up in many devices, where they reduce the forces
needed to perform otherwise difficult tasks. They also change the character of certain activities. Skiing wouldnât be very much fun if the only slopes available were horizontal or
vertical. By choosing ski slopes of various grades, you can select the ramp forces that set

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations

you in motion. Gentle slopes leave only small ramp forces and small accelerations; steep
slopes produce large ramp forces and large accelerations.
Finally, our observation about mechanical advantage is this: mechanical advantage
allows you to do the same work, but you must make a trade-offâyou must choose whether
you want a large force or a large distance. The product of the two parts, force times distance, remains the same.
Check Your Understanding #6: Access Ramps
Ramps for handicap entrances to buildings are often quite long and may even involve several sharp
turns. A shorter, straighter ramp would seem much more convenient. What consideration leads the
engineers designing these ramps to make them so long?
Answer: The engineers must limit the amount of force needed to propel a wheelchair steadily up the
ramp. The steeper the ramp, the more force is required.
Why: A person traveling in a wheelchair on a level surface experiences little horizontal force and can
move at constant velocity with very little effort. However, climbing a ramp at constant velocity requires
a substantial uphill force equal in magnitude to the downhill force from gravity. The steeper the ramp,
the more uphill force is needed to maintain constant velocity. A 12 to 1 grade (12 meter of ramp
surface for each meter of rise in height) is the accepted limit to how steep such a long ramp can be.

Epilogue for Chapter 1
In this chapter we have examined three everyday things and explored the basic physical
laws that govern their behaviors. In Skating, we looked at the concept of inertia and
observed that objects accelerate only in response to forces. In Falling Balls, we introduced
an important type of forceâweightâand saw how weight causes unsupported objects to
fall with equal downward accelerations.
In Ramps, we encountered another type of forceâsupport force. We also saw how the
work done in changing an objectâs altitude doesnât depend on how you raise the object,
since work is actually the mechanical means for transferring energy from one object to
another. Energy, we noted, is one of the conserved physical quantities that govern the
motion of objects in our universe. The particular type of energy we studied in Ramps was
gravitational potential energy, the potential energy associated with the force of gravity.

Explanation: Removing a Tablecloth from a Table
The dishes remain in place because of their inertia. As weâve seen, an object in motion
tends to remain in motion, while an object at rest tends to remain at rest.
Before you pull on the tablecloth, the dishes sit motionless on its surface, and they tend
to remain that way. By sliding the tablecloth off the table as quickly and smoothly as possible, you ensure that whatever force the tablecloth exerts on each dish occurs only for a
very short time. As a result, the dishes undergo only the tiniest changes in velocity and
remain essentially stationary on the tabletop.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Skating Works: When youâre gliding forward on frictionless skates, you experience no
horizontal forces and move at a constant velocity. Inertia alone carries you forward. To change
your velocityâto accelerateâsomething must exert a horizontal force on you. A forward force
speeds you up, while a backward force slows you down. Since sideways forces change your
direction of travel, they, too, make you accelerate.

CHAPTER 1 The Laws of Motion

How Falling Balls Work: Any ball thatâs subject only to its weightâthe force due to gravityâ
is a falling ball. It accelerates downward at a steady rate. Gravity affects only the ballâs vertical motion, causing the ballâs vertical component of velocity to increase steadily in the
downward direction. If the ball were initially moving horizontally, it would continue that
horizontal motion and drift steadily downfield as it falls.
A falling ball thatâs initially rising soon stops rising and begins to descend. The larger its
initial upward component of velocity, the longer the ball rises and the greater its peak height.
When the ball then begins to descend, the peak height determines how long it takes for the
ball to reach the ground.
When you throw a ball, the vertical component of initial velocity determines how long the
ball remains aloft. The horizontal component of initial velocity determines how quickly the
ball moves downfield. A thrower intuitively chooses an initial speed and direction for a ball so
that it moves just the right distance downfield by the time it descends to the desired height.
How Ramps Work: An object at rest on level ground experiences two forces: its downward
weight and an upward support force from the ground that exactly balances that weight. The
net force on the object is thus zero. If the ground is replaced with a ramp, however, the support force is no longer directly upward and the net force on the object isnât zero. Instead, the
net force points downhill along the ramp and is a ramp force thatâs equal to the weight of the
object multiplied by the ratio of the rampâs rise to the rampâs length. If a 10-m-long ramp
rises 1 m in height, then this ratio is 1 m divided by 10 m, or 0.10. The ramp force downhill
along this ramp is thus only 10% of the objectâs weight.
To stop an object from accelerating down a ramp, you must balance the downhill ramp
force by pushing equally hard uphill. In fact, if you exert more force up the ramp than it experiences down the ramp, the object will begin to accelerate up the ramp.
It takes less force to push an object up a ramp than to lift it directly upward, but you must
push that object a longer distance along the ramp. Overall, the work you do in raising the
object from one height to another is the same, whether or not you use the ramp. However, the
ramp gives you a mechanical advantage, allowing you to do work that would require an unrealistically large force by instead exerting a smaller force for a longer distance.

1. Newtonâs first law of motion: An object that is free from all

outside forces travels at a constant velocity, covering equal distances in equal times along a straight-line path.
2. Newtonâs second law of motion: An objectâs acceleration is

equal to the net force exerted on that object divided by the objectâs mass, or
net force = mass Âˇ acceleration.

(1.1.2)

3. Relationship between mass and weight: An objectâs weight is
equal to its mass times the acceleration due to gravity, or

weight = mass Âˇ acceleration due to gravity.

(1.2.1)

4. Velocity of an object experiencing constant acceleration: The

objectâs present velocity differs from its initial velocity by its
acceleration times the time since it was at that initial velocity, or
present velocity = initial velocity
+ acceleration Âˇ time.

(1.2.2)

5. Position of an object experiencing constant acceleration: The

objectâs present position differs from its initial position by its

average velocity since it was at that initial position times the
time since it was at that initial position, or
present position = initial position + initial velocity Âˇ time
+ 12 Âˇ acceleration Âˇ time2.

6. Newtonâs third law of motion: For every force that one object

exerts on a second object, there is an equal but oppositely directed
force that the second object exerts on the first object.
7. Definition of work: The work done on an object is equal to the

force exerted on that object times the distance that object travels
in the direction of the force, or
work = force Âˇ distance.

8. Gravitational potential energy: An objectâs gravitational potential energy is its mass times the acceleration due to gravity
times its height above a zero level, or

The Laws of Motion
PART 2

n the previous chapter, we saw how things move from place to place and encountered energy, an
important conserved quantity. But motion doesnât always involve a change of position, and energy
isnât natureâs only conserved quantity. In this chapter, weâll take a look at a second type of
motionârotationâand at two other conserved quantitiesâmomentum and angular momentum.
Spinning objects are quite common, and weâll do well to explore their laws of motion before proceeding much further. With those additional concepts under our belts, weâll be ready to explore the
physics behind a broad assortment of mechanical objects.

sort of influence do you have to exert on the dish to start
it rotating? If the dish doesnât wobble and the pencil
remains stationary, the dish should spin for a while before
coming to a stop. Once youâre no longer touching the
dish, what keeps it turning? On the other hand, why
doesnât it keep turning forever?
Now flip the pencil over so that its sharp point projects upward. What will happen when you place the dish
on that point? Will the dish still balance? When you spin
the dish, will it turn for a longer or shorter time than on
the bare eraser? If the dish is soft and the point digs into
it, protect the dishâs bottom by taping a coin to it. How
does this improved pivot affect the dishâs rotation? Can
you prolong the spin by taping weights around the outer
edge of the dish? Is there a way to get the dish spinning
just by blowing on it? Can you relate this motion to that
of a spinning skater or a bicycle wheel?

Spinning a dish on the top of a narrow post seems like a
simple activity. But donât let its uncomplicated appearance deceive you: there are lots of physics involved in
keeping the dish turning, in gradually slowing it down,
and in preventing it from falling off the post.
An easy way to experiment with a spinning dish is to
tape a pencil vertically to the edge of a table or chair so that
its eraser projects several inches upward into the air. To avoid
wobbling problems, the tape should hold the pencil rigidly in
place, and the table or chair should be sturdy and stable.
Now prepare to balance a metal pie dish on the eraser
before giving it a twist. If you donât have a pie dish, you can
use a Frisbee, a deep plastic plate, or a shallow plastic bowl
instead. Be creative. You probably have something that will
work; just donât use Grandmaâs heirloom porcelain unless
youâre willing to face the possible consequences.
The first thing youâll need to do is to balance the dish

Weâre going to explore the laws of rotational motion and two
new conserved quantities in the context of three everyday
objects: (1) seesaws, (2) wheels, and (3) bumper cars. In Seesaws, we look at twists and turns, and see how two children
manage to rock a seesaw back and forth. In Wheels, we examine how friction affects motion and learn how wheels make a

vehicle more mobile. In Bumper Cars, we learn the physics
behind collisions and uncover some of the simple rules that
govern what initially appear to be complicated motions. For a
more complete preview of what we examine in this chapter,
flip ahead to the Chapter Summary and Important Laws and
Equations at the end of the chapter.

children sit on the seesaw? What must the children do to start
the seesaw turning? To keep it turning? Who is doing work on
whom as they rock back and forth?

The ramp that we examined in Section 1.3 is only one tool that
provides mechanical advantage. In this section, weâll look at
another such device: the type of lever known as a seesaw.
Although seesaws move, their motion differs from that of the
objects in Chapter 1. Seesaws donât go anywhere; they rotate.
In this section, weâll revisit many of the laws of motion that we
encountered previously, but this time weâll see these laws in a
new contextârotational motion.
Questions to Think About: A playground seesaw balances only
when the children riding it are properly situated. What do we

Experiments to Do: To get a feel for how rotating objects work,
find a rigid ruler with a hole in its centerâthe kind that can be
clipped into a three-ring binder. If you support the ruler by
putting the tip of an upright pencil into the central hole, youâll
find that the ruler exhibits rotational inertia; that is, it either
remains stationary, at whatever orientation you choose, or
rotates steadily about the central hole. (Eventually, the ruler
comes to rest because of friction, a detail that weâll continue
to ignore for now.) Now, push on one end of the ruler. What
happens? Try pushing the rulerâs end toward its central hole.
What happens then? What is the most effective way to make
the ruler spin?
Now lay the pencil on a table and place the ruler flat on
top of it so that the pencil and the ruler are at right angles, or
perpendicular, to each other. If you center the ruler on the
pencil, the ruler will balance. How is this balanced ruler similar
to the freely turning, inertial ruler of the previous paragraph?
What role does gravity play in balancing the ruler? Load the two
ends of the ruler with coins or other small weights, trying as
you do so to keep the ruler balanced. Try placing the coins at
different positions relative to the pencil. Is there any way you
can balance a light weight on one end with a heavy weight on
the other end?

The Seesaw
Any child who has played on a seesaw with friends of different sizes knows that the toy
works best for two children of roughly the same weight (Fig. 2.1.1a). Evenly matched
riders balance each other, and this balance allows them to rock back and forth easily. In
contrast, when a light child tries to play seesaw with a heavy child, the heavy childâs side
of the seesaw drops rapidly and hits the ground with a thud (Fig. 2.1.1b). The light child is
tossed into the air.

Seesaws

There are several solutions to the heavy child-light child problem. Of course, two light
children could try to balance one heavy child. But most children eventually figure out that
if the heavy child sits closer to the seesawâs pivot, the seesaw will balance (Fig. 2.1.1c).
The children can then make the seesaw tip back and forth easily, just as it does when two
evenly matched children ride at its ends. This is a pretty useful trick, and weâll explore it
later in this section. First, though, weâll need to look carefully at the nature of rotational
motion.
For simplicity, letâs ignore the mass and weight of the seesaw itself. There are then
only three forces acting on the occupied seesaw shown in Fig. 2.1.1: two downward forces
(the weights of the two children) and one upward force (the support force of the central
pivot). Seeing those three forces, we may immediately think about net forces and begin to
look for some overall acceleration of this toy and its riders. But we know that the seesaw
remains where it is in the playground and isnât likely to head off for Kalamazoo or the
center of Earth anytime soon. Because the seesawâs fixed pivot always provides just enough
upward and sideways force to keep the seesaw from accelerating as a whole, the seesaw
always experiences zero net force and never leaves the playground. Overall movement of
an object from one place to another is called translational motion. Although the seesaw
never experiences translational motion, it can turn around the pivot, and thus it experiences
a different kind of motion. Motion around a fixed point (which prevents translation) is
called rotational motion.
Rotational motion is what makes a seesaw interestingâthe whole point of a seesaw is
that it can rotate so that one child rises and the other descends. (You may not think of going
up and down as rotating, but if the ground werenât there, the seesaw would be able to rotate
in a big circle.) But what causes the seesaw to rotate, and what observations can we make
about the process of rotation?
To answer those questions, weâll need to examine several new physical quantities
associated with rotation and explore the laws of rotational motion that relate them to one
another. Weâll do these things both by studying the workings of seesaws and other rotating objects and by looking for analogies between translational motion and rotational
motion.
Imagine holding onto the seesaw in Fig. 2.1.1a to keep it level for a moment while the
child on the left climbs off the seesaw. Now imagine letting go of the seesaw. As soon as
you let go, the seesaw begins to rotate clockwise, and the child on the right descends
toward the ground. The seesawâs motion is fairly slow at first, but it moves more and more
quickly until that child strikes the ground with a teeth-rattling thump. We could describe
the seesaw being twisted from rest in the following way:
âThe seesaw starts out not rotating at all. When we release the seesaw, it
begins to rotate clockwise. The seesawâs rate of rotation increases continuously
in the clockwise direction until the seesaw strikes the ground.â
This description sounds a lot like the description of a falling ball released from rest:
âThe ball starts out not moving at all. When we release the ball, it begins
to move downward. The ballâs rate of translation increases steadily in the
downward direction until the ball strikes the ground.â
The statement about the seesaw involves rotational motion, while the statement about
the ball involves translational motion. Their similarity isnât a coincidence; the concepts and
laws of rotational motion have many analogies in the concepts and laws of translational
motion. The familiarity that weâve acquired with translational motion will help us examine
rotational motion.

The guests at a large table in a Chinese restaurant use a revolving tray, a lazy Susan, to share
the food dishes. How does the motion of the lazy Susan differ from that of the passing dessert
cart?
Answer: The lazy Susan undergoes rotational motion, while the dessert cart undergoes translational
motion.
Why: The lazy Susan has a fixed pivot at its center. This pivot never goes anywhere, no matter
how you rotate the lazy Susan. In contrast, the dessert cart moves about the room and has no
fixed point. The server can rotate the dessert cart when necessary, but its principal motion is
translational.

In the previous chapter we looked at the concept of translational inertia, which holds that a
body in motion tends to stay in motion and a body at rest tends to stay at rest. This concept
led us to Newtonâs first law of translational motion. Inserting the word translational here is
a useful revision because weâre about to encounter the corresponding concepts associated
with rotational motion. Weâll begin that encounter by observing a seesaw thatâs free of
outside rotational influences. Weâll then examine how the seesaw responds to outside influences such as its pivot or a handful of young riders. Because of the similarities between
rotational and translational motions, this section closely parallels our earlier examinations
of skating and falling balls.
Letâs suppose that your local playground is installing a new seesaw and that this seesaw is presently dangling from a rope (Fig. 2.1.2). The rope is attached to the middle of the
seesaw, where it supports the seesawâs weight but exerts no other influences on the seesaw.
Most important, letâs suppose that the dangling seesaw can spin and pivot with complete
freedomânothing pushes on it or twists itâand that the rope doesnât get tangled or in the
way. This dangling seesaw is free to turn in any direction, even completely upside down.
You, the observer, are standing motionless near the seesaw. When you look over at the
seesaw, what does it do?
If the seesaw is stationary, then it will remain stationary. However, if itâs rotating, it
will continue rotating at a steady pace about a fixed line in space. What keeps the seesaw
rotating? Its rotational inertia. A body thatâs rotating tends to remain rotating; a body
thatâs not rotating tends to remain not rotating. Thatâs how our universe works.
To describe the seesawâs rotational inertia and rotational motion more accurately, weâll
need to identify several physical quantities associated with rotational motion. The first is
the seesawâs orientation. At any particular moment, the seesaw is oriented in a certain
wayâthat is, it has an angular position. Angular position describes the seesawâs orientation relative to some reference orientation; it can be specified by determining how far the
seesaw has rotated away from its reference orientation and the axis or line about which that
rotation has occurred. The seesawâs angular position is a vector quantity, pointing along the
rotation axis with a magnitude equal to the rotation angle (Fig. 2.1.3). Because changes in
orientation are usually more interesting than orientation itself, angular position is a relatively little-used physical quantity.
The SI unit of angular position is the radian, the natural unit for angles. Itâs a natural
unit because it follows directly from geometry, not from an arbitrary human choice or convention the way most units do. Geometry tells us that a circle of radius 1 has a circumference of 2Ď. By letting arc lengths around that circleâs circumference specify angles, we are
using radians. For example, there are 2Ď radians (or 360Â°) in a full circle and Ď/2 radians
(or 90Â°) in a right angle. Since the radian is a natural unit, it is often omitted from calculations and derived units.

Seesaws

If the seesaw is rotating, then its angular position is changing; this brings us to our first
important vector quantity of rotational motionâangular velocity. Angular velocity measures the rate at which the seesawâs angular position is changing with time. Its magnitude
is the seesawâs angular speed, the angle through which the seesaw turns in a certain
amount of time,
angular speed =

change in angle
time

and its direction is the axis about which that rotation proceeds. The SI unit of angular
velocity is the radian per second (abbreviated 1/s).
The seesawâs axis of rotation is the line in space about which the seesaw is rotating.
However, just knowing that line isnât quite enough: Is the seesaw rotating clockwise or
counterclockwise?
To resolve this ambiguity, we take advantage of the fact that any line has two directions to it. Once we have identified the line about which the seesaw is rotating, we can
look down that line at the seesaw from both directions. From one, the seesaw appears to
be rotating clockwise; from the other, counterclockwise. By convention, we choose to
view the seesaw from the direction in which it appears to be rotating clockwise and say
that the seesawâs rotation axis points away from our eye toward the seesaw. This convention is called the right-hand rule because if the fingers of your right hand are curling
around the axis in the way the seesaw is rotating, then your thumb is pointing along the
seesawâs rotation axis (Fig. 2.1.4). (Even if youâre left-handed, this rule still requires your
right hand, Fig. 2.1.5).
Remembering this convention isnât as important as understanding why you must specify the direction when reporting a rotating objectâs angular velocity. Just as translational
velocity consists of a translational speed and a direction in which the translational motion
occurs, so angular velocity consists of a rotational speed and a direction about which the
rotational motion occurs.
Weâre now prepared to describe the rotational motion of the dangling seesaw. Because
of its freedom from outside influences and its rotational inertia, its angular velocity is constant. If the seesaw is rotating, it keeps on rotating, always at the same angular speed,
always about the same axis of rotation. If it is not rotating, however, its angular velocity is
zero and remains zero.
As you might suspect, this observation isnât unique to seesaws. It is Newtonâs first
law of rotational motion, which states that a rigid object that is not wobbling and is not
subject to any outside influences rotates at a constant angular velocity, turning equal
amounts in equal times about a fixed axis of rotation. The outside influences referred to in
this law are called torquesâa technical term for twists and spins. When you twist off the
lid of a jar or spin a top with your fingers, youâre exerting a torque.
This law excludes objects that wobble or can change shape as they rotate because
those objects have more complicated motions. They are covered instead by a more
general principleâthe conservation of angular momentumâthat weâll meet up with in
Section 2.3.

A rigid object that is not wobbling and is not subject to any outside torques rotates at

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

Check Your Understanding #2: Going for a Spin
A rubber basketball floats in a swimming pool. It experiences zero torque, no matter which end of it
is up. If you spin the basketball and then let go, how will it move?
Answer: It will continue to spin at a steady pace about a fixed rotational axis (although friction with
the water will gradually slow the ballâs rotation).
Why: Because the basketball is free of torques, the outside influences that affect rotational motion,
it has a constant angular velocity. If you spin the basketball, it will continue to spin about whatever
axis you chose. If you donât spin the basketball, its angular velocity will be zero and it will remain
stationary.

Even without visiting the playground, you can find many objects that are nearly free from
torques: a baton thrown overhead by a baton twirler, for example, or a jugglerâs club whirling through the air between two clowns. These motions, however, are complicated because
those freely moving objects rotate and translate at the same time. The spinning baton travels up and down, the turning club arcs through the air, and if the rope breaks, your seesaw
will fall as it spins. How can we distinguish their translational motions from their rotational
motions?
Once again, we can make use of a wonderful simplification of physics. Thereâs a
special point in or near a free object about which all of its mass is evenly distributed and
about which it naturally spinsâits center of mass. The axis of rotation passes right
through this point so that, as the free object rotates, the center of mass doesnât move
unless the object has an overall translational velocity. The center of mass of a typical ball
is at its geometrical center, while the center of mass of a less symmetrical object depends
on how the mass of that object is distributed. You can begin to find a small objectâs center
of mass by spinning it on a smooth table and looking for the fixed point about which it
spins (Fig. 2.1.6).
Center of mass allows us to separate an objectâs translational motion from its rotational
motion. As a jugglerâs club arcs through space, its center of mass follows the simple path
we discussed in Section 1.2 on falling balls (Fig. 2.1.7). At the same time, the clubâs rotational motion about its center of mass is that of an object thatâs free of outside torques: if
itâs not wobbling, it rotates with a constant angular velocity.
Many of the objects weâll examine in this book translate and rotate simultaneously,
and itâs worth remembering that we can often separate these two motions by paying attention to an objectâs center of mass. For example, your seesaw has been designed with its
center of mass located exactly where the pivot will go. As a result, the pivot will prevent
any translational motion of the installed seesaw while permitting nearly free rotational
motion of the seesaw, at least about one axis.
When examining rotational motion, we need to choose the pivot point or center of
rotation, the point around which all the physical quantities of rotation are defined. For a
free object, the natural pivot point is its center of mass. For a constrained object, the best
pivot point may be determined by the constraintsâa door, for example, pivots about its
hinges. Since your installed seesaw will continue to pivot about its center of mass, that
point will remain the best choice for the center of rotation.
Once weâve chosen the pivot, however, we must calculate all the physical quantities of
rotation about that pivot. Because itâs tedious to write about its hinges or about its center
of mass every time I mention a physical quantity of rotation, I will often omit those phrases
when the pivot point is obvious or already identified.

Check Your Understanding #3: Tracking the High Dive
When a diver does a rigid, open somersault off a high diving board, his motion appears quite complicated. Can this motion be described simply? How?
Answer: Yes. His center of mass falls smoothly, obeying the rules governing falling objects. As he
falls, his body rotates at constant angular velocity about his center of mass.
Why: Like a thrown football or tossed baton, the diver is a rigid, rotating object. His motion can be
separated into translational motion of his center of mass (it falls) and rotational motion about his
center of mass (he rotates about it at constant angular velocity). While the diver may never think of
his motion in these terms, he is aware intuitively of the need to handle both his rotational and translational motions carefully. Hitting the water with his chest because he mishandled his rotation isnât
much more fun than hitting the board because he mishandled his translation.

How the Seesaw Responds to Torques
The workers are eating lunch, so the seesaw is still hanging from the rope. Why canât this
dangling seesaw change its rotational speed or axis of rotation? Because it has rotational
mass 1 . Rotational mass is the measure of an objectâs rotational inertia, its resistance to
changes in its angular velocity. An objectâs rotational mass depends both on its ordinary
mass and on how that mass is distributed within the object. The SI unit of rotational mass
is the kilogram-meter2 (abbreviated kg Âˇ m2). Because the seesaw has rotational mass, its
angular velocity will change only if something twists it or spins it. In other words, it must
experience a torque.
Torqueâour second important vector quantity of rotational motionâhas both a magnitude and a direction. The more torque you exert on the seesaw, the more rapidly its angular velocity changes. Depending on the direction of the torque, you can make the seesaw
turn more rapidly or less rapidly or even make it rotate about a different axis. How do you
determine the direction of a particular torque? One way is to imagine exerting this torque
on a stationary ball floating in water (Fig. 2.1.8a,b). The ball will begin to rotate, acquiring
a nonzero angular velocity (Fig. 2.1.8c). The direction of this angular velocity is that of the
torque. The SI unit of torque is the newton-meter (abbreviated N Âˇ m).
The larger an objectâs rotational mass, the more slowly its angular velocity changes in
response to a specific torque (Fig. 2.1.9). You can easily spin a basketball with the tips of
your fingers, but itâs much harder to spin a bowling ball. The bowling ballâs larger rotational
mass comes about primarily because it has a greater ordinary mass than the basketball.
However, rotational mass also depends on an objectâs shape, particularly on how far
each portion of its ordinary mass is from the axis of rotation. The farther a portion of mass
is from that axis, the more rapidly it must accelerate as the entire object undergoes angular
acceleration and the more leverage it has with which to oppose that acceleration. Weâll
examine levers shortly, but the consequence of these two effects of distance from the rotation axis is that each portion of mass contributes to the objectâs rotational mass in proportion to the square of its distance from that axis. Thatâs why an object that has most of its
mass located near the axis of rotation will have a much smaller rotational mass than an
object of the same mass that has most of its mass located far from that axis. Thus a ball of
pizza dough has a smaller rotational mass than the finished pizza. The bigger the pizza gets,
the harder it is to start or stop spinning.
Because an objectâs rotational mass depends on how far its mass is from the axis of
rotation, its rotational mass may change when its axis of rotation changes, even if itâs
rotating about its center of mass. For example, less torque is required to spin a tennis
racket about its handle (Fig. 2.1.10a) than to flip the racket head-over-handle (Fig.
2.1.10b). When you spin the tennis racket about its handle, the axis of rotation runs right
through the handle so that most of the racketâs mass is fairly close to the axis and the

rotational mass is small. When you flip the tennis racket head-over-handle, the axis of
rotation runs across the handle so that both the head and the handle are far away from the
axis and the rotational mass is large. The tennis racketâs rotational mass becomes even
larger when you hold it in your hand and make it rotate about your shoulder rather than
about its center of mass (Fig. 2.1.10c).
When something exerts a torque on the dangling seesaw, its angular velocity changes;
in other words, it undergoes angular acceleration, our third important vector quantity of
rotational motion. Angular acceleration measures the rate at which the seesawâs angular
velocity is changing with time. Itâs analogous to acceleration, which measures the rate at
which an objectâs translational velocity is changing with time. Just as with acceleration,
angular acceleration involves both a magnitude and a direction. An object undergoes
angular acceleration when its angular speed increases or decreases or when its angular
velocity changes directions. The SI unit of angular acceleration is the radian per second2
(abbreviated 1/s2).
If the seesaw is experiencing several torques at once, it canât respond to them individually. Instead, it undergoes angular acceleration in response to the net torque it experiences, the sum of all the individual torques being exerted on it.
There is a simple relationship between the net torque exerted on the seesaw, its rotational mass, and its angular acceleration. The seesawâs angular acceleration is equal to the
net torque exerted on it divided by its rotational mass or, as a word equation,
angular acceleration =

net torque
.
rotational mass

(2.1.1)

Seesaws

The seesawâs angular acceleration, as weâve seen, is in the same direction as the net torque
exerted on it.
This relationship is Newtonâs second law of rotational motion. Structuring the relationship this way distinguishes the causes (net torque and rotational mass) from their effect (angular
acceleration). Nonetheless, it has become customary to rearrange the relationship to eliminate
the division. In its traditional form, the relationship can be written in a word equation:
net torque = rotational mass Âˇ angular acceleration,

(2.1.2)

in symbols:
đnet = I Âˇ đś,
and in everyday language:
Spinning a marble is much easier than spinning a merry-go-round.
Itâs like Newtonâs second law of translational motion (net force = mass Âˇ acceleration),
except that net torque has replaced net force, rotational mass has replaced mass, and angular acceleration has replaced acceleration. This new law doesnât apply to nonrigid or wobbling objects, however, because nonrigid objects can change their rotational masses and
wobbling ones are affected by more than one rotational mass simultaneously (see the
earlier discussion of tennis rackets).

NEWTONâS SECOND LAW OF ROTATIONAL MOTION
The net torque exerted on a rigid object that is not wobbling is equal to that objectâs
rotational mass times its angular acceleration. The angular acceleration points in the
same direction as the net torque.

Because itâs an equation, the two sides of Eq. 2.1.1 are equal. Any change in the net
torque you exert on the seesaw must be accompanied by a proportional change in its
angular acceleration. As a result, the harder you twist the seesaw, the more rapidly its
angular velocity changes.
We can also compare the effects of a specific torque on two different rotational
masses. Equation 2.1.1 indicates that a decrease in rotational mass must be accompanied
by a corresponding increase in angular acceleration. If we replace the playground seesaw
with one from a dollhouse, the rotational mass will decrease and the angular acceleration
will increase. The angular velocity of the dollâs seesaw thus changes more rapidly than
the angular velocity of a playground seesaw when the two experience identical net
torques.
In summary:
1. Your angular position indicates exactly how youâre oriented.
2. Your angular velocity measures the rate at which your angular position is changing
with time.
3. Your angular acceleration measures the rate at which your angular velocity is
changing with time.
4. For you to undergo angular acceleration, you must experience a net torque.
5. The more rotational mass you have, the less angular acceleration you experience
for a given net torque.

Check Your Understanding #4: The Merry-Go-Round
The merry-go-round is a popular playground toy (see Fig. 2.1.9). Already challenging to spin empty,
a merry-go-round is even harder to start or stop when there are lots of children on it. Why is it so
difficult to change a full merry-go-roundâs angular velocity?
Answer: The full merry-go-round has a huge rotational mass.
Why: Starting or stopping a merry-go-round involves angular acceleration. As the pusher, you exert a
torque on the merry-go-round, and it undergoes angular acceleration. This angular acceleration
depends on the merry-go-roundâs rotational mass, which in turn depends on how much mass it has
and how far that mass is from the axis of rotation. With many children adding to the merry-go-roundâs
rotational mass, its angular acceleration tends to be small.

Why: To keep the angular acceleration in Eq. 2.1.1 unchanged while increasing the rotational mass

to spin or to stop from spinning, which is why automobiles use hollow tires.

Force

Fig. 2.1.11 (a) When
you push on the seesaw,
perpendicular to the lever
arm, you produce a torque
on the seesaw. But when
you (b) push at the pivot
or (c) push parallel to the
lever arm, you produce no
torque.

The workers have finally installed the seesaw. Because the pivot supporting the seesaw
passes directly through the seesawâs center of mass, the seesaw rotates about its own natural pivot. Moreover, the pivot supports the seesawâs weight in a manner that leaves it free
to obey Newtonâs first law of rotational motion. That is, when unoccupied and not influenced by anything else, the seesaw is either motionless or rotates with constant angular
velocity about its pivot.
To change the seesawâs angular velocity, you have to exert a torque on it. But how
do you actually exert a torque? To find out, you put your hand on one end of the seesaw
and push that end down (Fig. 2.1.11a). If the seesaw was motionless, it starts turning. If
it was already turning, its rate of rotation changes. You have indeed exerted a torque on
the seesaw.

Seesaws

43

You started by exerting a force on the seesawâyou pushed on itâso forces and
torques must be related somehow. Sure enough, a force can produce a torque and a torque
can produce a force. To help us explore their relationship, letâs think of all the ways not to
produce a torque by pushing on the seesaw.
What happens if you push on the seesaw exactly where the pivot passes through it
(Fig. 2.1.11b)? Nothing happensâthere is no angular acceleration. If you move a little
away from the pivot, you can get the seesaw rotating, but you have to push hard. You do
much better if you push on the end of the seesaw, where even a small force can start the
seesaw rotating. The shortest distance and direction from the pivot to the place where you
push on the seesaw is a vector quantity called the lever arm; in general, the longer the lever
arm, the less force it takes to cause a particular angular acceleration. Our first observation
about producing a torque with a force is this: you obtain more torque by exerting that force
farther from the pivot or axis of rotation. In other words, the torque is proportional to the
length of the lever arm.
Another ineffective way to start the seesaw rotating is to push its end directly toward
or away from the pivot (Fig. 2.1.11c). When your force is directed parallel to the lever
arm, as it is in this case, it produces no torque on the seesaw. Our second observation
about producing a torque with a force is that your force must have a component that is
perpendicular to the lever arm and only that perpendicular component contributes to the
torque.
We can summarize these two observations as follows: the torque produced by a force
is equal to the lever arm times that force, where we include only the component of the
force that is perpendicular to the lever arm. This relationship can be written as a word
equation:
torque = lever arm Âˇ force perpendicular to lever arm,

(2.1.3)

in symbols:
đ = r Âˇ FâĽ,
and in everyday language:
When twisting an unyielding object, it helps to use a long wrench.
The directions of the force and lever arm also determine the direction of the torque.
The three directions follow another right-hand rule (Fig. 2.1.12). If you point your right
index finger in the direction of the lever arm and your bent middle figure in the direction of
the force, then your thumb will point in the direction of the torque. Thus in Fig. 2.1.12a, the
lever arm points to the right, the force points downward, and the resulting torque points into
the page so that the seesaw undergoes angular acceleration in the clockwise direction. In
Fig. 2.1.12b, the lever arm has reversed directions and so has the torque.

Check Your Understanding #5: Cutting Up Cardboard
When you cut cardboard with a pair of scissors, itâs best to move the cardboard as close as possible
to the scissorsâ pivot. Explain.
Answer: The closer the cardboard is to the pivot, the more force it must exert on the scissors to
produce enough torque to keep the scissors from rotating closed. When the cardboard is unable to
produce enough torque, the scissors cut through it.
Why: When you place paper close to the pivot of a pair of scissors, you are requiring that paper to
exert enormous forces on the scissors to keep them from rotating closed. Rotations are started and
stopped by torques, and forces exerted close to the pivot exert relatively small torques.

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

Check Your Figures #2: A Few Loose Screws
Youâre trying to remove some rusty screws from your refrigerator, using an adjustable wrench with a
0.2-m (20-cm) handle. Although you push as hard as you can on the handle, you canât produce
enough torque to loosen one of the screws. You have a 1.0-m (100-cm) pipe that you can slip over
the handle of the wrench to make the wrench effectively 1 m long. How much more torque will you
then be able to exert on the screw?
Answer: Five times as much torque as before.
Why: The pipe increases the wrenchâs lever arm by a factor of 5, from 0.2-m to 1.0 m. According to
Eq. 2.1.3, the same force exerted five times as far from the pivot will produce five times as much
torque about that pivot. Extending the handle of a lever-like tool is a common technique to increase
the available torque, although it can be hazardous for both the tool and its user. Some tools that are
designed for such extreme use come with removable handle extensions.

Balancing and Unbalancing the Seesaw
When a child sits on one end of your seesaw, the childâs weight produces a torque on the
seesaw about its pivot. Gravity is ultimately responsible for that torque, so weâll call it a
gravitational torque. Because it depends on the lever arm (the vector from the pivot to the
child), moving the child to the other end of the seesaw reverses the torqueâs direction.
What happens when two children are sitting on opposite ends of the seesaw? Each
childâs weight produces a gravitational torque on the seesaw about its pivot, but those two
torques have opposite directions and thus at least partially cancel. If the two children have
equal weights and sit at equal distances from the pivot, the two gravitational torques cancel
exactlyâthey sum to zero. The seesaw then experiences no overall gravitational torque
about its pivot and it balances.
A balanced seesaw experiences no overall gravitational torque about its pivot. If
nothing twists it, the balanced seesaw is inertialâthe net torque on it is zero. When the
children arenât fidgeting, the seesaw is rigid and wobble-free, so it rotates at constant
angular velocity, in accordance with Newtonâs first law of rotational motion. If itâs
motionless, it stays motionless. If itâs turning, it continues turning at a steady pace.

COMMON M ISCON CE P T I ON S : A Balanced Object Is Motionless
Misconception: A balanced object is perfectly vertical or horizontal and doesnât move.
Resolution: A balanced object is experiencing zero gravitational torque about its pivot, but it may
well be tilted or even rotating. In fact, if it is free of other torques, Newtonâs first law of rotational
motion may apply to it. Only when an objectâs balance is easily disturbed (for example, a pencil
standing upright on its point or a pendulum hanging directly below its pivot) are orientation and
motionlessness important and then only because any small rotation will give rise to a gravitational
torque about its pivot and consequently to the loss of balance.

Two children with different weights can also balance the seesaw, but they must sit at
different distances from the pivot. According to Eq. 2.1.3, the gravitational torque a child
exerts on the seesaw is proportional to that childâs distance from the pivot times that childâs
weight. A heavier child must therefore sit closer to the pivot to balance a lighter child on
the other end of the seesaw.
With two children riding it, the balanced seesaw has a considerable weight, yet that
weight produces no torque on the seesaw about its pivot. Thatâs because the seesawâs
center of gravity, the effective location of the seesawâs overall weight, is located at the
pivot. Although gravity gives the children and the board their own individual weights, there

Seesaws

is a unique pointâthe seesawâs center of gravityâabout which all those individual weights
are balanced and at which gravity effectively pulls down on the entire seesaw. With the
seesawâs center of gravity located at the pivot, gravity has no lever arm with which to
produce a torque on the seesaw about the pivot.
Any object or system of objects has a center of gravityâthe effective location of its
overall weight. Although center of gravity (a gravitational concept) is different from center
of mass (an inertial concept), the two conveniently coincide; the seesawâs center of gravity
and its center of mass are located at the same point. That coincidence stems from the proportionality between an objectâs weight and its mass near Earthâs surface (see Section 1.2).

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Center of Mass Is Center of Gravity
Misconception: Center of mass and center of gravity are the same idea and can be used interchangeably.
Resolution: Center of mass is an inertial concept: the effective location of an objectâs mass as it
translates and the natural pivot as it rotates. Center of gravity is a gravitational concept: the effective location of the objectâs weight. Although these two centers coincide for objects near Earthâs
surface, interchanging the terms is as incorrect as confusing mass and weight.

As two children ride the balanced seesaw, theyâre inertial much of the timeâ
theyâre either motionless or turning steadily in one direction or the other. But motionlessness is tedious, and a turning seesaw eventually touches the ground. Therefore, the
children deliberately cause the seesaw to undergo angular acceleration so that it rocks
back and forth.
They can cause this angular acceleration in two different ways. First, a boy can push
on the ground with his feet so that the ground pushes back and thereby produces an additional torque on the seesaw. Although the seesaw remains balanced, that extra torque
from the ground causes it to undergo angular acceleration. When the boy stops pushing
on the ground, the groundâs torque vanishes and the seesaw resumes a constant angular
velocity.
Second, they can change their lever arms and thereby unbalance the seesaw. For example,
if one girl leans closer to the pivot, that girlâs lever arm decreases and so does her gravitational torque. Since the childrenâs gravitational torques no longer sum to zero, the seesaw
isnât balancedâit experiences an overall torque due to gravityâand it undergoes angular
acceleration. When the girl stops leaning so that the seesaw balances, its angular velocity
becomes constant again.

Check Your Understanding #6: Rocking the Boat
Loading a large container ship requires some care in balancing the cargo and fastening it down
firmly. The effective pivot about which the ship can rotate in the water is located roughly along the
centerline of the ship, from its bow to its stern. Why is improperly fastened-down cargo so dangerous
on such a ship, possibly causing it to capsize during a storm?
Answer: A substantial shift in the cargoâs position during a storm can unbalance the ship, giving rise
to a gravitational torque that may cause the ship to rotate about the effective pivot. The ship may
then capsize.
Why: Although most boats can compensate for some amount of cargo imbalance, shifting cargo can
easily flip even a fairly stable boat. It happens frequently in real life, often with fatal consequences.
Some boats, particularly canoes and racing shells, are notoriously sensitive to unbalanced loading
and are easily flipped by careless or moving occupants.

Fig. 2.1.13 When two
children ride a balanced

the rising child. (a) When
their weights are equal,
those two works involve
equal forces exerted over
equal distance. (b) When
one child is heavier than
the other, those two works

Levers and Mechanical Advantage
While discussing how to balance a seesaw, it was helpful to view the board and its riders as
a single rotating seesaw, subject to various gravitational and other torques, and undergoing
angular acceleration when those torques donât sum to zero. But we can also view the
seesaw board individually as a lever that allows two children to do work on one another as
it rotates. Most interestingly, that lever provides the mechanical advantage (see Section 1.3)
necessary for a light child sitting far from the pivot to do the work of lifting a heavy child
sitting near the pivot.
When two children sit on a motionless horizontal seesaw board (Fig. 2.1.13), each
child pushes down on the board with a force equal to that childâs weight. The force is
directed perpendicular to the lever arm from the pivot to the force, so it produces a torque
on the board about the pivot. If the children are properly situated on opposite sides of the
board, their torques cancel and the seesaw board experiences zero net torque. The seesaw
is balanced.
If the board is rotating steadily near horizontal, the forces and angles get a little complicated but the basic story doesnât change. Both children still push down on the board and
their torques still sum to zero. Now, however, the descending child does work on the board
by pushing it downward as it moves downward, and the board does work on the rising child
by pushing that child upward as the child moves upward. Because the seesaw is balanced,
the work done on the board by the descending child is equal to the work done by the board
on the rising child. In effect, the board transfers energy perfectly from the descending child
to the rising child.
To see this effect, suppose two 5-year-olds, each weighing 200-N (45 lbf), are sitting at
opposite ends of the seesaw (Fig. 2.1.13a). By exerting a 200-N downward force on the
seesaw board, 2 m (6.6 ft) from its pivot, each child produces a torque of 400 N Âˇ m (300 ft Âˇ lbf)
on the board (200 N Âˇ 2 m = 400 N Âˇ m). Since those torques are in opposite directions, they
sum to zero.
Now suppose the seesaw rotates clockwise, so that the girl rises 1 m and the boy
descends 1 m. Since the boy exerted a 200-N downward force on the board as the board
moved downward 1 m, he did 200-N Âˇ 1 m = 200 J of work on the board. Simultaneously,
the board exerted a 200-N upward force on the girl as the girl moved upward 1 m, so the
board did 200 J of work on the girl. Overall, the board has transferred 200 J of energy from
the boy to the girl.
Now letâs replace the 5-year-old girl with a 400-N (90-lbf) teenager (Fig. 2.1.13b). To
balance the seesaw, she must sit halfway to the pivot. She exerts a 400-N downward
force on the board, 1 m (3.3 ft) from its pivot, leaving the torque unchanged (400 N Âˇ 1 m =
400 N Âˇ m). As before, the childrenâs torques are in opposite directions and sum to zero.
This effect explains how a small boy at the end of the seesaw can balance a large girl nearer
the pivot.
Again, the seesaw rotates clockwise, but now the girl rises only 0.5 m when the boy
descends 1 m. As before, the boy did 200 J of work on the board. The board exerted a 400-N
upward force on the girl as the girl moved upward 0.5 m, so the board did 400 N Âˇ 0.5 m = 200 J
of work on the girl. Once again, the board has transferred 200 J of energy from the boy to
the girl, even though the girl weighs more than the boy.
The seesawâs mechanical advantage allows even the tiniest child sitting at its end to lift
the heaviest adult sitting near its pivot. Because the child travels much farther than the
adult, the childâs work on the seesaw equals the seesawâs work on the adult. This effectâa
small force exerted for a long distance on one part of a rotating system producing a large
force exerted for a short distance elsewhere in that systemâis an example of the mechanical
advantage associated with levers.

Check Your Understanding #7: Pulling Nails
Some hammers have a special claw designed to remove nails from wood. When you slide the claw
under the nailâs head and rotate the hammer by pulling on its handle, the claw pulls the nail out of
the wood. The hammerâs head contacts the wood to form a pivot thatâs about 10 times closer to the
nail than to the handle. The torque you exert on the hammer twists it in one direction, while the
torque that the nail exerts on the hammer twists it in the opposite direction. The hammer isnât
undergoing any significant angular acceleration, so the torques must nearly balance. If youâre exerting a force of 100 N (22 lbf) on the hammerâs handle, how much force is the nail exerting on the
hammerâs claw?
Answer: The nail is exerting about 1000 N (220 lbf).
Why: Since the nail is 10 times closer to the pivot, the nail must exert 10 times the force on the
hammer to create the same magnitude of torque as you do pulling on the handle. As the nail pulls
on the hammer, the hammer pulls on the nail. Although the wood exerts frictional forces on the nail
to keep it from moving, the extracting force overwhelms this friction and the nail slides slowly out of
the wood.

Children Support Each Other
While weâre thinking about the two children on a balanced seesaw as individual objects,
using the seesaw board to exchange energy, we may notice something else about those
children: theyâre using the seesaw board to support one another. In other words, each child
is using the board to exert a torque on the other child about the pivot, and that torque cancels
the other childâs gravitational torque. For example, the boy in Fig. 2.1.13a experiences a
clockwise torque due to gravity and a counterclockwise torque from the girl on the other
end of the seesaw. Since those two torques sum to zero, the boy rotates at constant angular
velocity about the pivot. Likewise, the boy exerts a torque on the girl so that she, too,
rotates at constant angular velocity.
Since the girl is exerting a torque on the boy and the boy is exerting a torque on the girl,
you might wonder if those two torques are related. It should come as no great surprise that
they are equal in amount but oppositely directed. Just as there is a Newtonâs third law for
translational motion, so there is a Newtonâs third law of rotational motion: if one object
exerts a torque on a second object, then the second object will exert an equal but oppositely
directed torque on the first object. The girlâs torque on the boy and the boyâs torque on the
girl are a Newtonâs third law pair.

NEWTONâS THIRD LAW OF ROTATIONAL MOTION
For every torque that one object exerts on a second object, there is an equal but oppositely
directed torque that the second object exerts on the first object.

Itâs worth noting that not all equal but oppositely directed torques are Newtonâs third
law pairs. On a balanced seesaw, each child experiences two torques that happen to be
equal but oppositely directed: a torque due to gravity and a torque due to the other child.
Those two torques form a matched pair because the seesaw is balanced, not because of
Newtonâs third law. In fact, if the seesaw werenât balanced, those two torques would not
be equal but oppositely directed and the children would both be undergoing angular
acceleration.

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

COMMON MISCON CE P T I ON S : Newtonâs Third Law or Not?
Misconception: Every pair of equal but oppositely directed forces or torques is associated with
Newtonâs third law.
Resolution: Newtonâs third law applies only to pairs of forces or torques that two objects exert on
one another. In such cases only, the forces or torques must be equal but oppositely directed. Two
forces or torques exerted on the same object are never a Newtonâs third law pair and can have any
values, including equal but oppositely directed.

SUMMARY OF NEWTONâS LAWS OF ROTATIONAL MOTION
1. A rigid object that is not wobbling and is not subject to any outside torques rotates
at a constant angular velocity, turning equal amounts in equal times about a fixed
axis of rotation.
2. The net torque exerted on a rigid object that is not wobbling is equal to that objectâs
rotational mass times its angular acceleration. The angular acceleration points in
the same direction as the torque.
3. For every torque that one object exerts on a second object, there is an equal but
oppositely directed torque that the second object exerts on the first object.
Note: These laws are the rotational analogs of the translational laws in Section 1.3.

Answer: The light exerted a torque on you.
Why: To unscrew the light, you must exert a torque on it. In accordance with Newtonâs third law of
rotational motion, that light exerts an equal but opposite torque on you. The ice is too slippery to
exert a torque on you, so you undergo angular acceleration and begin to rotate.

Like ramps and levers, wheels are simple tools that make our
lives easier. But a wheelâs main purpose isnât mechanical
advantage, itâs overcoming friction. Up until now, weâve ignored
friction, looking at the laws of motion as they apply only in
idealized situations. However, our real world does have friction,
and most objects in motion tend to slow down and stop because
of it. One of our first tasks in this section will therefore be to
understand frictionâthough, for the time being, weâll continue
to neglect air resistance.

Questions to Think About: If objects in motion tend to stay
in motion, why is it so hard to drag a heavy box across the
floor? If objects should accelerate downhill on a ramp, why
wonât a plate slide off a slightly tilted table? What makes the

Wheels

wheels of a cart rotate as you pull the cart forward? How does
spinning its wheels propel a car forward?

Experiments to Do: To observe the importance of wheels in
eliminating friction, try sliding a book along a flat table. Give
the book a push and see how quickly it slows down and stops.
Which way is friction pushing on the book? Does the force that
friction exerts on the book depend on how fast the book is

49

moving? Let the book come to a stop. Is friction still pushing
on the book when it isnât moving? If you push gently on the
stationary book, what force does friction exert on it?
Lay three or four round pencils on a table, parallel to one
another and a few inches apart. Rest the book on top of the
pencils and give the book a push in the direction that the pencils can roll. Describe how the book now moves. What do you
think has caused the difference?

Moving a File Cabinet: Friction
When we imagined moving your friendâs piano into a new apartment back in Section 1.3,
we neglected a familiar forceâfriction. Luckily for us, your friendâs piano had wheels on
its legs, and wheels facilitate motion by reducing the effects of friction. Weâll focus on
wheels in this section. First, though, to help us understand the relationship between wheels
and friction, weâll look at another item that needs to be movedâyour friendâs file cabinet.
The file cabinet is resting on a smooth and level hardwood floor; itâs full of sheet music
and weighs about 1000 N (225 lbf). Despite its large mass, you know that it should accelerate in response to a horizontal force, so you give it a gentle push toward the door. Nothing
happens. Of course, the file cabinet accelerates in response to the net force it experiences,
not to each individual force acting on it. Something else must be pushing on the file cabinet
in just the right way to cancel your force and keep it from accelerating. Undaunted, you push
harder and harder until finally, with a tremendous shove, you manage to get the file cabinet
sliding across the floor. However, the cabinet moves slowly even though you continue to
push on it. Something else is pushing on the file cabinet, trying to stop it from moving.
That something else is friction, a phenomenon that opposes the relative motion of two
surfaces in contact with one another. Two surfaces that are in relative motion are traveling
with different velocities so that a person standing still on one surface will observe the other
surface as moving. In opposing relative motion, friction exerts forces on both surfaces in
directions that tend to bring them to a single velocity.
For example, when the file cabinet slides by itself toward the left, the floor exerts a
rightward frictional force on it (Fig. 2.2.1). The frictional force exerted on the file cabinet,
toward the right, is in the direction opposite the file cabinetâs velocity, toward the left.
Since the file cabinetâs acceleration is in the direction opposite its velocity, the file cabinet
slows down and eventually comes to a stop.
According to Newtonâs third law of motion, an equal but oppositely directed force
must be exerted by the file cabinet on the floor. Sure enough, the file cabinet does exert a
leftward frictional force on the floor. However, the floor is rigidly attached to Earth, so it
accelerates very little. The file cabinet does almost all the accelerating, and soon the two
objects are traveling at the same velocity.

Fig. 2.2.1 A file cabinet sliding to the left
across a sidewalk experiences a frictional
force from the sidewalk to the right. Since
that sliding frictional force is the net force
on the file cabinet, the cabinet accelerates
opposite its velocity and gradually slows to
a stop.

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

Frictional forces always oppose relative motion, but they vary in strength according to
(1) how tightly the two surfaces are pressed against one another, (2) how slippery the surfaces are, and (3) whether the surfaces are actually moving relative to one another. First, the
harder you press two surfaces together, the larger the frictional forces they experience. For
example, an empty file cabinet slides more easily than a full one. Second, roughening the
surfaces generally increases friction, while smoothing or lubricating them generally
reduces it. Riding a toboggan down the driveway is much more interesting when the driveway is covered with snow or ice than when the driveway is bare asphalt. Weâll examine the
third issue later on.
Check Your Understanding #1: The One That Got Away
Your table at the restaurant isnât level, and your water glass begins to slide slowly downhill toward
the edge. Which way is friction exerting a force on it?
Answer: Friction is pushing the glass uphill.
Why: The glass is sliding downhill across the top of the stationary table. Since friction always opposes
relative motion, it pushes the glass uphill, in the direction opposite its motion.

A Microscopic View of Friction

Microscopic
contact points

Fig. 2.2.2 Two surfaces
that are pressed against
one another actually touch
only at specific contact
points. When the surfaces
slide across one another,
these contact points
collide, producing sliding
friction and wear.

As the file cabinet slides by itself across the floor, it experiences a horizontal frictional
force that gradually brings it to a stop. From where does this frictional force come? The
obvious forces on the file cabinet are both vertical, not horizontal; the cabinetâs weight is
downward, and the support force from the floor is upward. How can the floor exert a horizontal force on the file cabinet?
The answer lies in the fact that neither the bottom of the file cabinet nor the top of the
floor is perfectly smooth. They both have microscopic hills and valleys of various sizes. The
file cabinet is actually supported by thousands of tiny contact points, where the file cabinet
directly touches the floor (Fig. 2.2.2). As the file cabinet slides, the microscopic projections
on the bottom of the file cabinet pass through similar projections on the top of the floor. Each
time two projections collide, they experience horizontal forces. These tiny forces oppose the
relative motion and give rise to the overall frictional forces experienced by the file cabinet
and floor. Because even an apparently smooth surface still has some microscopic surface
structure, all surfaces experience friction as they rub across one another.
Increasing the size or number of these microscopic projections by roughening the
surfaces generally leads to more friction. If you put sandpaper on the bottom of the file
cabinet, it would experience larger frictional forces as it slides across the floor. On the other
hand, a microscopically smoother ânonstickâ surface, like that used in modern cookware,
would let the file cabinet slide more easily.
Increasing the number of contact points by squeezing the two surfaces more tightly
together also leads to more friction. The microscopic projections simply collide more
often. Thatâs why adding more sheet music to the file cabinet would make it harder to slide.
Doubling the file cabinetâs weight would roughly double the number of contact points and
make it about twice as hard to move across the floor. A useful rule of thumb is that the
frictional forces between two firm surfaces are proportional to the forces pressing those
two surfaces together.
Friction also causes wear when the colliding contact points break one another off. With
time, this wear can remove large amounts of material so that even seemingly indestructible
stone steps are gradually worn away by foot traffic. The best way to reduce wear between
two surfaces (other than to insert a lubricant between them) is to polish them so that they
are extremely smooth. The smooth surfaces will still touch at contact points and experience
friction as they slide across one another, but their contact points will be broad and round
and will rarely break one another off during a collision.

Wheels

Check Your Understanding #2: Weight and Friction
How much harder is it to slide a stack of two identical books across a table than it is to slide just one
of those books?
Answer: About twice as hard.
Why: The frictional forces between the table and books are roughly proportional to the forces pressing
them together. The bookâs weight is what pushes them together. When you effectively double the
bookâs weight, by stacking a second book on top of it, you double the frictional forces between the
table and the books.

Static Friction, Sliding Friction, and Traction
There are really two kinds of friction: sliding and static. When two surfaces are moving
across one another, sliding friction acts to stop them from sliding. But even when those
surfaces have the same velocity, static friction may act to keep them from starting to slide
across one another in the first place.
You find it particularly hard to start the file cabinet sliding across the floor. Contact
points between the cabinet and floor have settled into one another, so a small push does
nothing. Static friction always exerts a frictional force that exactly balances your push.
Since the net force on the file cabinet is zero, it doesnât accelerate.
However, the force that static friction can exert is limited. To get the file cabinet moving,
you need to give it a mighty shove and thereby exert more horizontal force on it than static
friction can exert in the other direction. The net force on the file cabinet is then no longer
zero, and the file cabinet accelerates.
Once the file cabinet is moving, static friction is replaced by sliding friction. Because
sliding friction acts to bring the file cabinet back to rest, you must push on the cabinet to
keep it moving. With the file cabinet sliding across the floor, however, the contact points
between the surfaces no longer have time to settle into one another, and they consequently
experience weaker horizontal forces. Thatâs why the force of sliding friction is generally
weaker than that of static friction and why itâs easier to keep the file cabinet moving than it
is to get it started.
Both forms of friction are incorporated in the concept of traction, the largest amount
of frictional force that the file cabinet can obtain from the floor at any given moment. When
the cabinet is stationary, its traction is equal to the maximum amount of force that static
friction can exert on it. Once it begins to slide across the floor, however, its traction reduces
to the amount of force that sliding friction exerts.
While the file cabinetâs traction is a nuisance that you must overcome, the traction of
your shoes on the floor is crucial. Unless you can push against the wall, your shoes are
going to need enough traction to provide the horizontal force required to move the file
cabinet. Letâs hope youâre wearing your basketball shoes!
There is another difference between static and sliding frictionâsliding friction wastes
energy. It converts useful, ordered energy, work or energy that can easily do work, into
relatively useless thermal energy, a disordered energy thatâs associated with temperature.
Sliding friction makes things hotter by turning work into thermal energy.
We can observe work becoming thermal energy as you slide the file cabinet across the
floor at constant velocity. Since the cabinet isnât accelerating, you and the floor are pushing
the cabinet equally hard in opposite directions. Because youâre pushing the cabinet forward
as it moves forward, youâre doing (positive) work on the cabinet. Sliding friction from the
floor, however, is pushing the cabinet backward as it moves forward, so sliding friction is
doing negative work on the cabinet. Overall, sliding friction is removing energy from the
cabinet just as fast as youâre adding it.
Where is your work going? The cabinet isnât transferring your work to the floor
because the floor canât move and therefore canât have work done on it. Alas, sliding friction

51

52

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

is grinding your work up into tiny fragments by way of countless collisions between the
contact points on the two sliding surfaces. The fragments of your energy are distributed
randomly among particles that make up those surfaces and thereby become thermal energy.
The cabinet and floor are both becoming hotter.
In contrast, static friction doesnât waste energy as thermal energy; it simply enables
objects to do work on one another. For example, your efforts have made you thirsty, so you
drink a glass of water. As you grip the sides of the glass with your fingers and lift it upward,
each finger is exerting an upward static friction force on the glass. Since the glass moves
upward as your fingers push it upward, your fingers are doing (positive) work on the glass.
At the same time, the glass is exerting a downward static friction force on each of your
fingers. Because each finger moves upward as the glass pushes it downward, the glass is
doing negative work on your fingers. In this manner, static friction is transferring energy
from you to the glass without wasting any of it as thermal energy.

Check Your Understanding #3: Skidding to a Stop
Antilock brakes keep an automobileâs wheels from locking and skidding during a sudden stop. Apart
from issues of steering, what is the advantage of preventing the wheels from skidding (sliding) on the
pavement?
Answer: If the wheels continue to turn, they experience static friction with the pavement. If they lock
and begin to skid, they experience sliding friction. Since the traction provided by static friction is
greater than that provided by sliding friction, the car will decelerate faster if the wheels donât skid.
Why: For a rapid stop, the car needs the maximum possible force in the direction opposite its velocity. The most effective way to obtain that stopping force from the road is with static friction between
the turning wheels and the pavement. Sliding friction, the result of skidding tires, is less effective at
stopping the car, wears out the tires, and diminishes the driverâs ability to steer the vehicle.

Friction and Energy
Weâve seen that sliding friction converts work into thermal energy, but what exactly is
thermal energy? To answer that question, letâs first reexamine energy in general.
Energy is the capacity to do work, and it is transferred between objects by doing that
work. As noted in Section 1.3, energy is a conserved physical quantityâit cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred between objects or converted from one form
to another. To distinguish energy from two other conserved quantities weâll encounter in
the next section, you can think of energy as the conserved quantity of doing. With practice,
youâll be able to follow the flow of energy through a system just as an accountant follows
the flow of money through a company.
Energyâs two basic forms are kinetic (energy contained in the motions of objects) and
potential (energy stored in the forces between or within those objects). Each force has its
own specific form of potential energy, some of which appear in Table 2.2.1.
The individual forms of energy are not conserved quantities; only total energyâthe
sum of all the individual formsâis conserved. For example, when you drop a ball from

TABLE 2.2.1 Several Specific Forms and Examples of Potential Energy

rest, its gravitational potential energy decreases and its kinetic energy increases, but its
total energy remains unchanged.
We measure energy in many common units: joules (J), calories, food Calories (also
called kilocalories), and kilowatt-hours, to name only a few. All these units measure the
same thing, and they differ from one another only by numerical conversion factors, some
of which can be found in Appendix B. For example, 1 food Calorie is equal to 1000 calories
or 4187 J. A jelly donut with about 250 food Calories thus contains about 1,000,000 J of
energy. Since a joule is the same as a newton-meter, 1,000,000 J is the energy youâd use to
lift your friendâs file cabinet into the second-floor apartment 200 times (1000 N times 5 m
upward equals 5000 J of work per trip). No wonder eating donuts is hard on your physique!
Letâs return now to thermal energy. Thermal energy is actually a mixture of ordinary kinetic and potential energies. But unlike the kinetic energy in a moving ball or the
potential energy in an elevated piano, the kinetic and potential energies in thermal energy
are contained entirely within those objects. Any object has internal energy, energy held
entirely within that object by its individual particles and forces between those particles;
thermal energy is the portion of internal energy thatâs associated with temperature. Thermal
energy makes every microscopic particle in the object jiggle randomly and independently;
at any moment, each particle has its own tiny supply of potential and kinetic energies, and
this dispersed and disordered energy is collectively referred to as thermal energy.
As you push the file cabinet across the floor, you do work on it, but it doesnât pick up
speed. Instead, sliding friction converts your work into thermal energy, and the cabinet and
floor become hotter as the energy you transfer to them disperses among their particles. But
although sliding friction easily turns work into thermal energy, thereâs no easy way to turn
thermal energy back into work. Disorder not only makes things harder to use, but it also is
difficult to undo. When you drop your favorite coffee mug on the floor and it shatters into a
thousand pieces, the cup is still all there; however, itâs disordered and thus much less useful.
Just as dropping the pieces on the floor a second time isnât likely to reassemble your cup,
energy converted into thermal energy canât easily be reassembled into useful, ordered energy.
Check Your Understanding #4: Burning Rubber
If you push too hard on your carâs accelerator pedal when the traffic light turns green, your wheels
will slip and youâll leave a black trail of rubber behind. Such a âjackrabbit startâ can cause as much
wear on your tires as 50 km (31 miles) of normal driving. Why is skidding so much more damaging
to the tires than normal driving?
Answer: Normal driving involves mostly static friction because the surfaces of the tires donât slide
across the pavement. Skidding involves sliding friction as the tire surfaces move independently of
the pavement. Because it involves sliding friction, skidding creates thermal energy and damages the tires.
Why: The expression âburning rubberâ is an appropriate name for skidding during a jackrabbit start.
Substantial thermal energy is produced, and a trail of hot rubber is left on the pavement behind the
car. At drag races, the frictional heating that results from skidding at the start can be so severe that
the tires actually catch on fire.

Wheels
Youâve wrestled your friendâs file cabinet out the door of the old apartment and are now
dragging it along the sidewalk. Youâre doing work against sliding friction the whole way,
producing large amounts of thermal energy in both the bottom of the cabinet and the surface of the sidewalk. Youâre also damaging both objects, since sliding friction is wearing
out their surfaces. The four-drawer file cabinet may be down to three drawers by the time
you arrive at the new apartment.
Fortunately, there are mechanical systems that can help you move one object across
another without sliding. The classic example is a roller (Fig. 2.2.3). If you place the file
cabinet on rollers, those rollers will rotate as the file cabinet moves so that their surfaces

never slide across the bottom of the cabinet or the top of the sidewalk. To see how the rollers work, make a fist with one hand and roll it across the palm of your other hand. The skin
of one hand doesnât slide across the skin of the other hand; since this silent motion doesnât
convert work into thermal energy, your skin remains cool. Now slide your two open palms
across one another; this time, sliding friction warms your skin.
Although the rollers donât experience sliding friction, they can experience static friction. The top of each roller is touching the bottom of the cabinet, and the two surfaces move
along together even when the file cabinet is accelerating because of static friction; they grip
one another tightly until the rollerâs rotation pulls them apart. A similar process takes place
between the rollers and the top of the sidewalk; static friction can exert torques on the rollers and cause them to rotate in the first place. Again, you can illustrate this behavior with
your hands. Try to drag your fist across your open palm. Just before your fist begins to
slide, youâll feel a torque on it. Static friction between the skins of your two hands, acting
to prevent sliding, causes your fist to begin rotating just like a roller.
Once you get the file cabinet moving on rollers, you can keep it rolling along the level
sidewalk indefinitely. Without any sliding friction, the cabinet doesnât lose kinetic energy,
so it continues at constant velocity without your having to push it. However, the rollers
move out from under the file cabinet as it travels, and you frequently have to move a roller
from the back of the cabinet to the front. In fact, you need at least three rollers to ensure
that the file cabinet never falls to the ground when a roller pops out the back. Although the
rollers have eliminated sliding friction, theyâve created another headacheâone that makes
the prospect of a long trip unappealing. Is there another device that can reduce sliding friction without requiring constant attention?
One alternative would be a four-wheeled cart. The simplest cart rests on fixed poles or
axles that pass through central holes or hubs in the four wheels (Fig. 2.2.4). The ground
exerts upward support forces on the wheels, the wheels exert upward support forces on the
axles, and the axles support the cart and its contents. As the cart moves forward, its wheels

roll. Their bottom surfaces donât slide or skid across the ground; instead, each wheel lowers
a portion of its surface onto the sidewalk, leaves it there briefly so that it may experience
static friction, and then raises it back off the sidewalk, with a new portion of wheel surface
taking its place. Because of the touch-and-release character of rolling, there is no sliding
friction between the cartâs wheels and the ground.
Unfortunately, as each wheel rotates, its hub slides across the stationary axle at its
center. This sliding friction wastes energy and causes wear to both hub and axle. However,
the narrow hub moves relatively slowly across the axle so that the work and wear done each
second are small. Still, this sliding friction is undesirable and can be reduced significantly
by lubricating the hub and axle with axle grease.
A better solution is to insert rollers between the hub and axle (Fig. 2.2.5). The result is a
roller bearing, a mechanical device that eliminates sliding friction between a hub and an axle.
A complete bearing consists of two rings separated by rollers that keep those rings from rubbing against one another. In this case, the bearingâs inner ring is attached to the stationary
axle, while its outer ring is attached to the spinning wheel hub. The nondriven wheels of
an automobile are supported by roller bearings on essentially stationary axles. The nondriven wheels of lighter vehicles, such as bicycles and wagons, are similarly supported on
stationary axles, but their bearings use balls instead of rollersâball bearings. When a vehicle
with free wheels starts forward, static friction from the ground pushes backward on the bottoms of those free wheels to keep them from skidding forward. Those frictional forces also
produce torques that cause the wheels to begin turning and they roll forward (Fig. 2.2.6a).
A carâs engine-powered or driven wheels are also supported by roller bearings, but these
bearings act somewhat differently. Because the engine must be able to exert a torque on each
driven wheel, those wheels are rigidly connected to their axles. As the engine spins these axles,
the axles spin their wheels (Fig. 2.2.6b). A bearing prevents each spinning axle from rubbing
against the carâs frame. This bearingâs outer ring is attached to the stationary car frame while
its inner ring is attached to the spinning axle. When a vehicle begins to spin its driven wheels,
static friction from the ground pushes forward on the bottoms of those driven wheels to keep
them from skidding backward. Since those forward frictional forces are the only horizontal
forces on the vehicle, the vehicle accelerates forward and the driven wheels roll forward.
Recognizing a good idea when you think of it, you load the file cabinet into the passenger
seat of your red convertible sports car and start the engine. The car isnât quite as responsive
as usual because of the added mass, but itâs still able to accelerate respectably. In a few seconds, youâre cruising down the road toward the new apartment and a very grateful friend.

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

Check Your Understanding #5: Jewel Movements
Many antique mechanical watches and clocks proudly proclaim that they have âjewel movements.â
Gears in these timepieces turn on axles that are pointed at either end and are supported at those
ends by very hard, polished gemstones. What is the advantage of having needlelike ends on an axle
and supporting those needles with smooth, hard jewels?
Answer: Because all the supporting forces are very close to the axis of rotation, the jewels exert
almost zero torque on the axle. The axle turns remarkably freely.
Why: Mechanical timepieces need almost ideal motion to keep accurate time. One of the best ways
to allow a rotating object free movement is to support it exactly on the axis of rotation, where the
support canât exert torque on the object.

Power and Rotational Work
Itâs a beautiful afternoon, and you thrill to the power of your car as it drives swiftly up a
steep hill. In this situation, power means more than just a sense of exhilaration and freedom; power is also the physical quantity that measures the rate at which your carâs engine
does workâthe amount of work it does in a certain amount of time, or
power =

work
.
time

The SI unit of power is the joule per second, also called the watt (abbreviated W).
Other units of power include Calories per hour and horsepower; like the units for energy,
these units differ only by numerical factors, which are listed in Appendix B online. For
example, 1 horsepower is equal to 745.7 W, so the engine of your 200-horsepower roadster
can supply about 150,000 W of power. With you and the file cabinet on board, the car
weighs about 15,000 N (3400 lbf), so the car engine can lift it about 10 m upward each
second. No wonder itâs climbing the hill so easily!
Up to now, weâve considered work only in the context of translation motion, where
work involves force and distance. For example, you do work on the file cabinet by exerting
a force on it as it moves a distance in the direction of that force. The carâs engine, however,
does work on each of its powered wheels in the context of rotational motion, where work
involves torque and angle. Specifically, the engine does work on a wheel by exerting a
torque on the wheel as the wheel rotates through an angle in the direction of the torque.
To do work on an object via rotational motion, you must twist it as it rotates through
an angle in the direction of your twist. The work you do on it is equal to the torque you
exert on its times the angle through which it rotates in the direction of your torque, where
that angle is measured in radians, the natural unit of angles. We can express this relationship as a word equation:
work = torque Âˇ angle(in radians)

(2.2.1)

in symbols:
W = đ Âˇ đ˝,
and in everyday language:
If youâre not twisting or itâs not turning, then youâre not working.
This simple relationship assumes that your torque is constant while youâre doing the work.
If your torque varies, the calculation of work will have to recognize that variation and may
require the use of calculus.

Wheels

As the engine does work on its wheels via rotational motion, those wheels do work on
the car via translational motion. Because each wheel grips the pavement with static friction,
its contact point with the ground canât move. Instead, the rotating wheel pushes the axle and
car forward as they move forward. So energy that flows into the wheels via rotational motion
returns to the car via translational motion and keeps the car climbing steadily up the hill.
Like work itself, power can be supplied by translational motion or rotational motion.
When youâre pushing the file cabinet across the floor, youâre using translational motion to
supply power to it. Since translational work is force times distance (Eq. 1.3.1) and power
is work divided by time, translational power is force times distance divided by time, or
power = force Âˇ velocity.
You can thus supply more power to the file cabinet either by pushing it harder or by having
it move faster in the direction of your push.
As your car drives up the hill, the car engine is using rotational motion to supply power
to its wheels. Since rotational work is torque times angle, rotational power is torque times
angle divided by time, or
power = torque Âˇ angular velocity.
The car can therefore supply more power to its wheels either by twisting them harder or by
having them rotate faster in the direction of that twist.

Check Your Understanding #6: Going Nowhere One Foot at a Time
Youâre pedaling a stationary bicycle when your shoelace comes undone. While you retie the lace, you
can pedal with only one foot and exert half as much torque on the pedals as before. The pedals are
still turning just as quickly, so are you still exercising as hard?
Answer: No.
Why: By halving the torque you exert on the pedals, you halve the work that you do on those pedals
each time they complete a rotation.

Check Your Figures #1: We All Knead Energy
When your kitchen mixer is kneading a loaf of sourdough bread, it exerts a torque of 20 newtonmeters on its mixing blade, and that blade completes 500 rotations. How much energy does the
mixer supply to its blade and the dough?
Answer: It supplies about 63,000 joules.
Why: According to Eq. 2.2.1, the energy that the mixer transfers to its blade is equal to the torque it
exerts on the blade times the angle through which the blade turns. Since there are 2đ radians per
complete rotation, the blade turns approximately 3140 radians. The work that the mixer does is
20 N-m times 3140, or about 63,000 J.

Kinetic Energy
As you near your destination, you begin thinking about the carâs brakes. Theyâre designed
to stop the car by turning its kinetic energy into thermal energy. Theyâll perform their task
by rubbing stationary brake pads against spinning metal discs. Although youâre confident
that those brakes are up to the task, just how much kinetic energy are they going to have to
convert into thermal energy?
One way to determine the carâs kinetic energy is to calculate the work its engine did on
it while bringing it from rest to its current speed. The result of that calculation is that the

57

58

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

moving carâs kinetic energy is equal to one-half its mass times the square of its speed. This
relationship can be written as a word equation:
kinetic energy = 12 Âˇ mass Âˇ speed2,

(2.2.2)

in symbols:
K = 12 Âˇ m Âˇ v2,
and in everyday language:
Racing around at twice the speed takes four times the energy.
With you and the file cabinet on board, the sports car has a mass of about 1500 kg
(3300 lbm). At a speed of 100 km/h (62 mph), it has over 575,000 J of kinetic energy. That
enormous energy is four times what it would be at 50 km/h (31 mph), so put down your cell
phone and drive carefully. The dramatic increase in kinetic energy that results from a modest
increase in speed explains why high-speed crashes are far deadlier than those at lower
speeds and why that police officer is checking out your car with a radar gun. Red cars get
all the attention.
Youâre traveling safely within the speed limit and exchange a polite wave with the officer. However, you soon pass another car that has been stopped for a ticket. The light on the
nearby police car spins round and round, and rotating objects have kinetic energy, too. Like
the kinetic energy of translational motion, the kinetic energy of rotational motion depends
on inertia and speed; however, itâs the rotational inertia and rotational speed that matter. The
lightâs kinetic energy of rotational motion is equal to one-half its rotational mass times the
square of its angular speed. This relationship can be written as a word equation:
kinetic energy = 12 Âˇ rotational mass Âˇ angular speed2,

(2.2.3)

in symbols:
K = 12 Âˇ I Âˇ Ď2,
and in everyday language:
It takes a very energetic person to spin his wheels twice as fast.
With the ticket complete, the police car pulls out into traffic with its light still spinning. The lightâs total kinetic energy is now the sum of two parts: translational kinetic
energy and rotational kinetic energy. Its translational kinetic energy depends on the speed
of the lightâs center of mass, which is equal to the police carâs speed through traffic. Its
rotational kinetic energy depends on the angular speed at which the light turns about its
center of mass.
As the police car disappears in the distance, it occurs to you that the spinning wheels
of your car also have rotational kinetic energy that adds to the carâs substantial translational
kinetic energy. Still, you trust your brakes. In a few minutes, you arrive at your destination
and brake to a stop. Although youâre aware of the added mass because the car decelerates
less quickly than usual, the brakes successfully transform the carâs kinetic energy into thermal energy. Youâve reached your goal safely and are now a hero.

Check Your Understanding #7: Throwing a Fastball
A typical grade school pitcher can throw a baseball at 80 km/h (50 mph), but only a few professional
athletes have the extraordinary strength needed to throw a baseball at twice that speed. Why is it so
much harder to throw the baseball only twice as fast?
Answer: Doubling the speed of the baseball requires quadrupling the energy transferred to it by the
pitcher.
Why: To throw a 160-km/h (100-mph) fastball, a major league pitcher must put four times as much
kinetic energy into both the ball and his arm as when pitching an 80-km/h slow ball. He also pitches
the fastball in half the time needed to pitch the slow ball. Overall, he must do four times as much
work throwing a fastball, and he must do that work in one-half the time. That means the pitcher
produces eight times as much power while throwing a fastball as when throwing a slow ball. No
wonder amateurs have trouble duplicating that feat.

Check Your Figures #2: Blowing in the Wind
The air in a hurricane travels at 200 km/h (124 mph). How much more kinetic energy does 1 kg of
this air have than 1 kg of air moving at only 20 km/h?
Answer: It has 100 times as much kinetic energy.
Why: Because kinetic energy is proportional to speed squared, the kilogram of air in the hurricane
moves 10 times as fast but has 100 times as much kinetic energy as the slower moving air. This enormous increase in energy is what makes a hurricaneâs wind dangerous. The airâs terrific speed also brings
large quantities of it to you quickly, so that the wind power arriving each second is overwhelming.

Check Your Figures #3: Playing Around at the Playground
When children climb onto a playground merry-go-round, they increase its rotational inertia. If the
children triple the merry-go-roundâs rotational mass, how will they alter the kinetic energy it has when
it spins at a certain angular speed?
Answer: The children will triple the merry-go-roundâs kinetic energy.
Why: The kinetic energy of a spinning object is proportional to its rotational mass. Since the children
triple the merry-go-roundâs rotational mass, they triple its kinetic energy.

For a few minutes, drivers in this amusement park ride race
madly about an oval track, deliberately crashing their vehicles
into one another and laughing hysterically at the violent
impacts. Jolts, jerks, and spins are half the fun, and itâs a wonder that no one gets whiplash. Hidden in the excitement,
though, are several important physics concepts that influence
everything from tennis to billiards.

While car crashes normally arenât much fun outside of movies
or television, there is one delightful exceptionâbumper cars.

Questions to Think About: Why does a stationary car begin
rolling forward after being struck by a moving car? What
aspects of motion are passed between cars as they collide?
Why does your car jolt more when the car that hits it contains
two big adults rather than one small child? What would happen if the bumper cars had hard steel bumpers rather than
soft rubber ones? Why is your car often set spinning by collisions, and what keeps it spinning?
Experiments to Do: Place a coin on a smooth table and flick a
second identical coin so that it slides along the table and

60

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

strikes the stationary coin squarely. What happens? Try this
experiment again, but now use two coins with different
masses. How is the collision different? Does it matter which
coin you crash into the other?
Now line up several identical coins so that they touch, and
slide another coin into one end of this line. How does the

collision affect the coin that was originally moving? How does
it affect the line of coins? What was transferred among the
coins by the collision?
Now stand a coin on its edge and flick it so that it spins
rapidly. Did you give it something that keeps it spinning? Why
does the coin eventually stop spinning?

Coasting Forward: Linear Momentum
Bumper cars are small, electrically powered vehicles that can turn on a dime and are protected on all sides by rubber bumpers. Each car has only two controls: a pedal that activates
its motor and a steering wheel that controls the direction in which the motor pushes the car.
Since the car itself is so small, its occupants account for much of the carâs total mass and
rotational mass.
Imagine that you have just sat down in one of these cars and put on your safety strap.
The other people also climb into their cars, usually one person per car, and the ride begins.
With your car free to move or turn, you quickly become aware of its translational and
rotational inertias. The carâs translational inertia makes it hard to start or stop, and its rotational inertia makes it difficult to spin or stop from spinning. While weâve seen these two
types of inertia before, letâs take another look at them and at how they affect your bumper car.
This time, weâll see that theyâre associated with two new conserved quantities: linear momentum and angular momentum. As promised, energy isnât the only conserved quantity in nature!
When fast-moving bumper cars crash into one another, they exchange more than just
energy. Energy is a scalar rather than vector quantity, so itâs directionless and canât account
for the fact that these cars seem to be exchanging some physical quantity that incorporates
both speed and direction of travel. For example, if your car is hit squarely by a car speeding
toward the right, then your carâs motion shifts rightward in response. What your car is
receiving from the other car is a rightward-directed dose of a conserved vector quantity
known as linear momentum.
Linear momentum, usually just called momentum, is the measure of an objectâs
translational impetus or tenacityâits determination to keep moving the way itâs currently
moving. Roughly speaking, your carâs momentum indicates the effort it took to get the car
moving with its present speed and direction of motion. To distinguish it from energy and
angular momentum, you can think of momentum as the conserved quantity of moving.
The carâs momentum is equal to its mass times its velocity and can be written as a
word equation:
momentum = mass Âˇ velocity,

(2.3.1)

in symbols:
p = m Âˇ v,
and in everyday language:
Itâs hard to stop a fast-moving truck.
Note that momentum is a vector quantity and that it has the same direction as the velocity.
As we might expect, the faster your car is moving or the more mass it has, the more momentum it has in the direction of its velocity. The SI unit of momentum is the kilogram-meter
per second (abbreviated kg Âˇ m/s).
To physicists, conserved quantities are rare treasures that make it easier to understand
otherwise complicated motions. Like all conserved quantities, momentum canât be created
or destroyed. It can only be transferred between objects. Momentum plays a very basic role
in bumper cars; the whole point of crashing them into one another is to enjoy the momentum

transfers. During each collision, momentum shifts from one car to the other so that they
abruptly change their speeds or directions or both. As long as these momentum transfers
arenât too jarring, everyone has a good time.
Youâve stopped your car, so it has zero velocity and zero momentum. To begin moving
again, something must transfer momentum to your car. While you could press the pedal and
let the motor gradually transfer momentum from the ground to your car, thatâs not much
fun. Instead, you let two grinning couch potatoes in an overloaded green car slam into you
at breakneck speed (Fig. 2.3.1).
The green car was heading westward, and in a few moments your car is moving westward, too, while the green car has slowed significantly. Before you recover from the jolt,
your car pounds a childâs car westward and your car slows down abruptly. Finally, its
impact with a wall stops the childâs car. Despite disapproving looks from the childâs parents, thereâs no harm done. Overall, westward momentum has flowed from the spudmobile
to your car, to the childâs car, and into the wall. No momentum has been created or
destroyed; youâve all simply enjoyed passing it along from car to car.
Check Your Understanding #1: Stuck on the Ice
Suppose youâre stuck in the middle of a frozen lake, with a surface so slippery that you canât get any
traction. You take off a shoe and throw it toward the southern shore. You find yourself coasting toward
the northern shore and soon escape from the lake. Why did this scheme work?
Answer: By transferring southward momentum to the shoe, you obtained northward momentum.
Why: Initially, both you and your shoe have zero momentum. But when you throw the shoe southward,
you give it southward momentum. Since the only source of that southward momentum is you, you
must have lost southward momentum. A negative amount of southward momentum is actually northward momentum, and thus you coast northward. Interestingly enough, the total momentum of you
and the shoe hasnât changed. Itâs still zero, as it must be because momentum is conserved. It has
simply been redistributed.

Check Your Figures #1: Follow That Train!
The bad guys are getting away in a four-car train, and youâre trying to catch them. The train has a mass
of 20,000 kg and itâs rolling forward at 22 m/s (80 km/h or 50 mph). What is the trainâs momentum?
Answer: The trainâs momentum is 4400,000 kg Âˇ m/s, in the forward direction.
Why: You can use Eq. 2.3.1 to calculate the trainâs momentum from its mass and velocity:
linear momentum = 20,000 kg Âˇ 22 m/s
= 440,000 kg Âˇ m/s.
That momentum is in the same direction the train is moving, the forward direction.

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

Exchanging Momentum in a Collision: Impulses
Momentum is transferred to a car by giving it an impulse, a force exerted on it for a certain
amount of time. When the motor and floor push your bumper car forward for a few seconds,
they give your car an impulse and transfer momentum to it. This impulse is the change in
your carâs momentum and is equal to the force exerted on the car times the duration of that
force. This relationship can be written as a word equation:
impulse = force Âˇ time,

(2.3.2)

in symbols:
Îp = F Âˇ t,
and in everyday language:
The harder and longer you push a bobsled forward at the start of a race, the
more momentum it will have when it starts down the hill.
The more force or the longer that force is exerted, the larger the impulse and the more your
bumper carâs momentum changes. Remember that an impulse, like momentum itself, is a
vector quantity; it points in the same direction as the force. If your aim is off and the misdirected impulse you obtain from the floor sends you crashing into the wall, donât say you
hadnât been warned!
Different forces exerted for different amounts of time can transfer the same momentum to a car:
impulse = large force Âˇ short time
= small force Âˇ long time.

(2.3.3)

Thus you can get your car moving with a certain forward momentum either by letting the
motor and floor push it with a small forward force of long duration or by letting the colliding green car push on it with a large forward force of short duration.
Forces that colliding objects exert on one another as they exchange momentum are
often called impact forces, and they explain why bumper cars have soft rubber bumpers. If
the bumpers were hard steel, the collision between the green car and your car would last
only an instant and would involve enormous impact forces. Youâd be in need of a neck
brace and the services of a personal injury lawyer. However, amusement parks donât like
lawsuits and sensibly limit the impact forces. To do this, they use rubber bumpers and
rather slow-moving cars.
Nonetheless, you can get a pretty good jolt when you collide head-on with another car.
Your two cars then start with oppositely directed momenta, and the collision roughly exchanges
those momenta between cars. In almost no time, you go from heading forward to heading
backward. The impulse that causes this reversal of motion is especially large because it not
only stops your forward motion but also causes you to begin heading backward.
During the collision, you gave the other car more forward momentum than you had
and ended up with less than zero forward momentum. A vector of negative magnitude is a
vector of positive magnitude pointing in the opposite direction. In this case, your deficit of
forward momentum after the collision means that you have backward momentum.
Momentum is conserved because of Newtonâs third law of motion. When the green car
exerts a force on your car for a certain amount of time, your car exerts an equal but oppositely
directed force on the green car for exactly the same time. Because of the equal but oppositely
directed nature of the two forces, the cars receive impulses that are equal in amount but opposite in direction. Since the momentum gained by one car is exactly equal to the momentum lost
by the other car, we say that momentum is transferred from one car to the other.

Bumper Cars

The more mass a car has, the less its velocity changes as a consequence of a momentum transfer. Thatâs why the green car doesnât stop completely when it crashes into your
car, whereas your car speeds up dramatically. Just a fraction of the green carâs forward
momentum causes a large change in your carâs velocity. Like a bug being hit by an automobile windshield, your bumper car does most of the accelerating.

CONSERVED QUANTITY: MOMENTUM

TRANSFERRED BY: IMPULSE

Momentum: The measure of an objectâs translational motion, its tendency to continue
moving in a particular direction. Momentum is a vector quantity, meaning that it has
a direction. It has no potential form and therefore cannot be hidden; momentum =
mass Âˇ velocity.
Impulse: The mechanical means for transferring momentum; impulse = force Âˇ time.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Momentum and Force
Misconception: A massive moving object carries a force with itâthe âforce of its momentum.â
Resolution: Although the impulses that transfer momentum involve forces, momentum itself does
not. A moving object carries only momentum, not force. Most important, a coasting object is free
of any net force. However, when that object hits an obstacle, the two exchange momentum via
impulses, and those impulses do involve forces.

Check Your Understanding #2: Bowling Them Over
When a beanbag hits the wall, it transfers all its forward momentum to the wall and comes to a stop.
When a rubber ball hits the wall, it transfers all its forward momentum, comes to a stop, and then
rebounds. During the rebound, it transfers still more forward momentum to the wall. If you wanted
to knock over a weighted bowling pin at the county fair, which would be the more effective projectile:
the rubber ball or the beanbag, assuming they have identical masses and you throw them with identical
velocities?
Answer: The bouncy rubber ball would be more effective.
Why: Either projectile will transfer all its original momentum to the bowling pin while coming to a
stop. However, the bouncy rubber ball will bounce back and continue to exert a force on the bowling
pin. The impulse (force Âˇ time) delivered by the rubber ball will be greater than that delivered by the
beanbag because the ball will exert its forward force for a longer time (during stopping and rebounding).
The ball will rebound with its momentum reversed, having transferred roughly twice its original
momentum to the pin.

Check Your Figures #2: Stop That Train!
The engine of the train youâre chasing (see Check Your Figures #1) has broken down, but itâs still
rolling forward. To stop it, you grab onto the last car and begin to drag your boot heels on the ground.
The backward force on the train is 200 N. How long will it take you to stop the train?
Answer: It will take 2200 s, so kiss your boot heels goodbye!
Why: To stop the train, you must give it a backward impulse that completely cancels its forward momentum. Since its forward momentum is 440,000 kg Âˇ m/s, the backward impulse must be 440,000 kg Âˇ m/s.
Since 200 N can also be written as 200 kg Âˇ m/s2, we can use Eq. 2.3.2 to find the time:
time =

440,000 kg Âˇ m/s

200 kg Âˇ m/s2
= 2200 s.

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

Spinning in Circles: Angular Momentum
When bumper cars are sent spinning during crashes, they are exchanging yet another conserved quantity. Like momentum, itâs a conserved vector quantity, but now itâs associated
with the angular speed and direction of rotation around a specific pivot. For example, when
your car receives a glancing blow from a car that is circling it rapidly in a clockwise direction, your car acquires more clockwise rotation about its center of mass. What your car is
receiving from the other car is a clockwise-directed dose of a conserved vector quantity
known as angular momentum.
Angular momentum is the measure of an objectâs rotational impetus or tenacity, its
determination to keep rotating the way itâs currently rotating. Simply put, your carâs angular momentum indicates the effort it took to get the car rotating with its present angular
speed and axis of rotation. To distinguish it from energy and momentum, you can think of
angular momentum as the conserved quantity of turning.
The carâs angular momentum is equal to its rotational mass times its angular velocity
and can be written as a word equation:
angular momentum = rotational mass Âˇ angular velocity,

(2.3.4)

in symbols:
L = I Âˇ đ,
and in everyday language:
Itâs hard to stop a spinning carousel.
Note that angular momentum is a vector quantity and that it has the same direction as the
angular velocity. The faster your car is spinning or the larger its rotational mass, the more
angular momentum it has in the direction of its angular velocity. The SI unit of angular
momentum is the kilogram-meter2 per second (abbreviated kg Âˇ m2/s).
Angular momentum is another conserved quantity; it canât be created or destroyed,
only transferred between objects. For your car to begin spinning, something must transfer
angular momentum to it, and your car will then continue to spin until it transfers this angular momentum elsewhere. To study angular momentum properly, however, we must pick
the pivot about which all the spinning will occur. In the present situation, a good choice for
this pivot is your carâs initial center of mass.
Your bumper car is stationary again, so it has zero angular velocity and zero angular momentum. Suddenly, a purple car sweeps by and strikes your car a glancing blow
(Fig. 2.3.2). Because the purple car was circling your car counterclockwise, it had counterclockwise angular momentum about the pivot. Its impact transfers some of this angular momentum to your car, which begins spinning counterclockwise itself. Since it has
given up some of its angular momentum, the purple car circles your car less rapidly.
Your car gradually stops spinning as its wheels and friction transfer the angular momentum to the ground and Earth. Overall, no angular momentum was created or destroyed
during the collision. Instead, it was transferred from the purple car to your car to Earth.
Check Your Understanding #3: Many Happy Returns
Satellites are often set spinning during launch to give them added stability. When astronauts visit
these satellites years later, they find them still spinning. Why donât the satellites stop spinning?
Answer: The satellites are unable to get rid of their angular momentum.
Why: Because of their extreme isolation, orbiting satellites have nothing with which to exchange
angular momentum. The angular momentum given to them at launch stays with them indefinitely, so
they continue to spin for decades.

Fig. 2.3.2 Since the purple car is circling your car counterclockwise, it has counterclockwise angular
momentum. When it hits your car, it transfers some of that angular momentum to your car. Because of
this transfer, the purple car stops circling quickly as your car begins to spin counterclockwise.

Check Your Figures #3: Want to Go for a Spin?
Spinning satellites are particularly stable. Suppose that the astronauts launching a particular satellite decide to increase its angular velocity by a factor of 5. How will that change affect the satelliteâs
angular momentum?
Answer: The angular momentum will increase by a factor of 5.
Why: Because the satelliteâs angular momentum is proportional to its angular velocity, spinning it five
times faster will increase its angular momentum by that same factor.

Glancing Blows: Angular Impulses
Angular momentum is transferred to a bumper car by giving it an angular impulse, that is,
a torque exerted on it for a certain amount of time. When the purple car hits your car and
exerts a torque on it briefly, it gives your car an angular impulse and transfers angular
momentum to it. This angular impulse is the change in your carâs angular momentum and
is equal to the torque exerted on your car times the duration of that torque. This relationship
can be written as a word equation:
angular impulse = torque Âˇ time,

(2.3.5)

in symbols:
ÎL = đ Âˇ t,
and in everyday language:
To get a merry-go-round spinning rapidly, you must twist it hard
and for a long time.
The more torque is exerted or the longer that torque is exerted, the larger the angular
impulse and the more your carâs angular momentum changes. Once again, an angular
impulse is a vector quantity and points in the same direction as the torque. Had the purple
car been circling your car clockwise when it struck the glancing blow, its angular impulse
would have been in the opposite direction and youâd be spinning the other way.

65

66

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

Different torques exerted for different amounts of time can transfer the same angular
momentum to a car:
angular impulse = large torque Âˇ short time
= small torque Âˇ long time.

ÂŠ Brian Kersey/NewsCom

Thus you can get your car spinning with a certain angular momentum either by letting
the motor and floor twist it with a small torque of long duration or by letting the colliding
purple car twist it with a large torque of short duration. As with linear momentum, sudden
transfers of angular momentum can break things, so the cars are designed to limit their
impact torques to reasonable levels. Even so, you may find yourself reaching for the motion
sickness bag after a few spinning collisions.
Angular momentum is conserved because of Newtonâs third law of rotational motion.
When the purple car exerts a torque on your car for a certain amount of time, your car
exerts an equal but oppositely directed torque on the purple car for exactly the same
amount of time. Because of the equal but oppositely directed nature of the two torques, the
cars receive angular impulses that are equal in amount but opposite in direction. Since the
angular momentum gained by one car is exactly equal to the angular momentum lost by
the other car, we say that angular momentum is transferred from one car to the other.
Because a carâs angular momentum depends on its rotational mass, two different cars
may end up rotating at different angular velocities even though they have identical angular
momenta. For example, when the purple car hits the overloaded green car and transfers
angular momentum to it, the green carâs enormous rotational mass makes it spin relatively
slowly. The same sort of behavior occurs with linear momentum, where a carâs mass affects
how fast it travels when itâs given a certain amount of linear momentum. But while a
bumper car canât change its mass, it can change its rotational mass. If it does so while itâs
spinning, its angular momentum wonât change, but its angular velocity will!
To see this change in angular velocity, consider the overloaded green car. Its two large
occupants are disappointed with the ride because their huge mass and rotational mass
prevent them from experiencing the intense jolts and spins that youâve been enjoying.
Suddenly they get a wonderful idea. As their car slowly spins, one of them climbs into the
otherâs lap and the two sit very close to the carâs center of mass. By rearranging the carâs
mass this way, they have reduced the carâs overall rotational mass and the car actually
begins to spin faster than before.
As the green carâs mass is being redistributed, itâs not a freely turning rigid object covered by Newtonâs first law of rotational motion. However, it is freely turning and thus covered
by a more general and equally useful rule: an object that is not subject to any outside torques
has constant angular momentum. As the carâs rotational mass becomes smaller, its angular
velocity must increase to keep its angular momentum constant. Thatâs just what happens.
This effect of changing oneâs rotational mass explains how an ice skater can achieve an enormous angular velocity by pulling herself into a thin, spinning object on ice (Fig. 2.3.3).

Angular momentum: The measure of an objectâs rotational motion, its tendency to continue
spinning about a particular axis. Angular momentum is a vector quantity, meaning that
it has a direction. It has no potential form and therefore cannot be hidden; angular
momentum = rotational mass Âˇ angular velocity.
Angular impulse: The mechanical means for transferring angular momentum; angular
impulse = torque Âˇ time.

Check Your Understanding #4: Spinning the Merry-Go-Round
A person who is initially motionless starts a merry-go-round spinning and then returns to being
motionless. If angular momentum is truly conserved, what is the source of the angular momentum
that the spinning merry-go-round now has?
Answer: It came from the entire Earth.
Why: Because the person stood on Earth as he started the merry-go-round spinning, he transferred
angular momentum from Earth to the merry-go-round. The merry-go-round spins in one direction,
and Earthâs rotation changes ever so slightly in the other direction. Because Earth is so huge and has
such an enormous rotational mass, its slight change in rotation is undetectable.

Check Your Figures #4: Spin Away!
How much longer will it take the astronauts launching the satellite in Check Your Figures #3 to bring
it to the faster angular velocity, if they use the initially planned torque?
Answer: It will take them five times as long.
Why: To reach the new, faster angular velocity, the astronauts will need an angular impulse thatâs five
times as large as originally planned. Since they will be using the same torque, they will have to exert
that torque for five times as long.

The Three Conserved Quantities
As you drive your bumper car around the oval track, its motion is governed in large
part by three conserved quantities: energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum
(Table 2.3.1). While you can exchange those quantities with Earth and the power company
by steering your car or switching on its motor, most of the interesting exchanges involve
collisions.
Each time your car shoves another car forward, your car does work on that other car
and transfers energy to it. Each time your car pushes another car northward, your car gives
a northward impulse to that other car and transfers northward momentum to it. And each
time your car twists another car clockwise about its center of mass, your car gives a clockwise angular impulse to the other car and transfers clockwise angular momentum to it.
These exchanges of energy, momentum, and angular momentum are fast and furious and
make for an exciting ride.

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

Check Your Understanding #5: Hitting the Wall
Youâre backing out of a parking space and accidentally hit a concrete wall. The wall doesnât move,
and your car sustains some damage. Did your car transfer any energy or momentum to the wall?
Answer: Your car transferred momentum but no energy.
Why: To transfer momentum to the wall, your car must give it an impulse: it must push on the wall
for an amount of time. It did so and thus transferred all its backward momentum to the wall. But to
transfer energy to the wall, your car must do work on it: it must push on the wall as the wall moves
in the direction of that push. The wall is immobile, however, so your car couldnât do work on it.
Instead, the carâs energy stayed in the car, where it caused damage.

Potential Energy, Acceleration, and Force
Shortly before the bumper car ride stops, you notice that the floor is somewhat uneven and
that cars accelerate down whatever slopes they encounter. These accelerations often deflect
cars as they cross depressions or bumps, adding to the craziness of the ride. Depending on its
initial velocity, a car that moves across a slope may change its speed, its direction, or both.
COMMON M ISCON CE P T I ON S : Acceleration and Velocity
Misconception: An objectâs acceleration and velocity always point along the same line.
Resolution: Although acceleration measures the rate at which velocity changes with time, those
two quantities are independent at any given moment and may or may not point along the same
line. When they are not aligned, the direction of the objectâs velocity will shift over time toward
the direction of its acceleration and the objectâs path will bend.

We have seen this tendency to accelerate downhill before with ramps, but now letâs
look at it in terms of potential energy. When a bumper car accelerates downhill, it also
accelerates in the direction that reduces its potential energy as quickly as possible. Thatâs
not a coincidence; there is a direct relationship between the carâs acceleration and how
the carâs potential energy changes with position. That relationship, which weâre about to
explore, will prove to be quite useful throughout this book.
Before elaborating further, however, I need to introduce a type of vector quantity
known as a gradient. A gradient characterizes how some physical quantity changes gradually with position. It points in the direction of fastest increase in its physical quantity,
and its magnitude is the rate of that increase. To find that rate, take a small step in the
direction of fastest increase and divide the resulting increase by the length of the step.
For example, this
has a redness gradient. That gradient points
toward the right because thatâs the direction of fastest redness increase, and its magnitude
is 100% per inch because the redness increases by 100% over a distance of 1 inch to the
right. Similarly, this
has a blueness gradient that points to the left and has a magnitude of 200% per inch.
A ramp has an altitude gradient; that is, the rampâs altitude increases gradually along
its surface from the bottom of the ramp to the top. That altitude gradient points uphillâin
the direction of quickest altitude increaseâand its magnitude is the increase in altitude
caused by a small uphill step divided by the length of that step. The steeper the ramp, the
larger its altitude gradient.
Last, a bumper car riding on a ramp has a potential energy gradient; that is, the carâs
potential energy increases gradually as the car moves along the surface of the ramp from
the bottom of the ramp to the top. This potential energy gradient, or simply potential
gradient, points uphillâin the direction of quickest potential energy increaseâand its
magnitude is the increase in the carâs potential energy caused by a small uphill step divided
by the length of that step. The steeper the ramp, the larger the carâs potential gradient.

Bumper Cars

Interestingly, the carâs potential gradient and its acceleration point in exactly opposite
directions. The carâs potential gradient points in the direction that increases its potential
energy as quickly as possible, whereas the bumper car accelerates in the direction that
reduces its potential energy as quickly as possible.
Thatâs not a coincidence. Potential energies are energies stored in forces and pushing
the bumper car in the direction of the potential gradient stores potential energy in a force
that must be pushing the bumper car in the opposite direction. In fact, the negative of the
carâs uphill potential gradient is the downhill force on the car. We can write this relationship as a word equation:
force = âpotential gradient,

(2.3.7)

in symbols:
F = âGradient (U),
and in everyday language:
An object accelerates in the direction that reduces its potential
energy as quickly as possible,
where the force points in the direction of quickest potential energy decrease.
A similar rule applies for rotational motion and torques. When there are multiple forms
of potential energy, we must remember to sum them to obtain total potential energy, total
potential gradient, and net force. These rules provide a useful way to determine how motion
will proceed: which way a spring will leap, a chair will tip, or a bumper car will roll. Weâll
use them frequently in this book.

POTENTIAL ENERGY AND ACCELERATION
An object accelerates in the direction that reduces its total potential energy as quickly
as possible.

Check Your Understanding #6: Heading Down
When you pull a child back on a playground swing and let go, which way does that child accelerate?
Answer: The child accelerates forward, in the direction that will reduce the childâs potential energy
as quickly as possible.
Why: The child has only one form of potential energyâgravitational potential energy. This gravitational potential energy is lowest when the child is directly below the swingâs supporting bar. The child
accelerates forward because that will put the child below the support as quickly as possible.

Check Your Figures #5: Pumpkin Chucking
Youâve constructed a catapult for a pumpkin-chucking contest. When you let go of the basket holding
the pumpkin, the catapult will swing that basket forward and release 10,000 J of potential energy as
it travels 1 m forward. What force must you exert on the basket to hold it in place prior to letting go?
Answer: You must exert 10,000 N on the basket in the backward direction.
Why: When you let go, the basket will accelerate forwardâthe direction that reduces its potential
energy as quickly as possible. According to Eq. 2.3.7, since the basket acquires 10,000 J in traveling backward 1 m, the forward force acting on the basket is:
10,000 J
= 10,000 N.
1m
To keep the basket stationary, you must exert a force of 10,000 N in the backward direction.

CHAPTER 2 The Laws of Motion

Epilogue for Chapter 2
In this chapter we have looked at rotating and colliding objects and have studied the physical laws that describe their motions. In Seesaws, we examined rotational inertia and saw
how torques cause angular accelerations. We also noticed how useful it can be to separate
an objectâs rotational motion from its translational motion. In Wheels, we discussed another
important type of force, friction, as well as a new type of energy, thermal energy, the energy
associated with heat and temperature. In Bumper Cars, we introduced two more conserved
physical quantities: momentum and angular momentum. As weâll see, following the transfers of energy, momentum, and angular momentum between objects often helps our understanding of how those objects work.

Explanation: A Spinning Pie Dish
Because the balanced dish has rotational inertia, torques are required both to start it spinning
and to stop it from doing so. When you twist the dish with your hand, the torque you exert
gives the dish an angular impulse and sets it spinning with a certain amount of angular
momentum. If the pivot were truly frictionless and there were no air resistance, the dish
would spin indefinitely because it would be unable to get rid of its angular momentum.
However, friction in the pivot exerts a small but significant torque that opposes the dishâs
motion and gradually slows it down. As this frictional torque transfers angular momentum
out of the dish and into the pencil, chair, and Earth, the dish turns more and more slowly
until it finally comes to a stop. The sharper the pivot and the smaller the contact area between
point and dish, the less frictional torque the dish experiences and the longer it spins.
Balancing the dish is easy as long as itâs upside-down. With its edge drooping downward, the dish has relatively little gravitational potential energy and is surprisingly stable. If
it begins to tip to one side, the dishâs average height rises and so does its gravitational potential energy. Since objects naturally accelerate in whatever direction lowers their potential
energy as quickly as possible, the upside-down dish quickly tips back toward level after
being disturbed. In contrast, an upright dish is virtually impossible to balance on a point
because any tip will lower its gravitational potential energy and lead quickly to catastrophe.
Weâll look at these stabilizing/destabilizing effects more carefully later on in this book.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Seesaws Work: A seesaw is a rotating toy that works best when itâs almost perfectly
balanced, meaning that it experiences no overall torque about its pivot due to gravity. The
seesawâs pivot usually passes through its center of gravity so that the seesaw balances when
itâs not occupied. The riders arrange themselves so that their gravitational torques cancel one
another and the occupied seesaw continues to balance. The seesaw then experiences zero
net torque and zero angular acceleration, and it rotates with constant angular velocity. It
either remains motionless or turns steadily in one direction or the other.
To make the seesaw tip back and forth, the riders briefly upset its inertial motion. Often
they do this by pushing against the ground with their feet to produce additional torques on the
seesaw. The seesaw then experiences both a net torque and an angular acceleration. By rhythmically changing the net torque on the seesaw, the riders cause it to rotate back and forth.
How Wheels Work: Wheels facilitate motion by eliminating or reducing sliding friction
between an object and a surface. The wheels convey the support forces needed to hold the
object up but allow the object to move without sliding. As a cart with freely turning wheels
moves along the surface, static friction between each wheel and the surface exerts a torque
on that wheel and causes it to turn. However, rubbing may occur between the wheelâs hub

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations

71

and the axle, where sliding friction can waste energy and cause wear. To eliminate this sliding
friction, roller or ball bearings are often used.
The torque that causes a powered wheel on a vehicle to turn comes from an engine by
way of an axle. In this case, static friction between the outside of the wheel and the ground
exerts a torque on the wheel that opposes the torque from the engine. This static frictional
force also contributes to the net force on the vehicle and propels it.
Once supported on wheels and bearings, objects can move freely and can retain linear
momentum, angular momentum, and energy for long periods of time. By eliminating sliding
friction, wheels can also keep objects from converting ordered energy into thermal energy.
Wheels allow vehicles to hold onto these conserved quantities for extended periods and make
transportation far more practical.
How Bumper Cars Work: Since they start from rest, bumper cars must obtain their initial
momenta and angular momenta from the ground and their initial kinetic energies from the
power company. They do this with the help of motors and wheels, which gradually transfer
energy, momentum, and angular momentum into the cars.
Once the cars are moving, they can begin to exchange those conserved quantities by
way of collisions. Each impact usually changes the carsâ speeds and directions of travel in
a manner that may seem rather complicated. However, following the exchanges of momentum, angular momentum, and energy often makes it easier to understand these collisions.
Cars containing massive riders respond weakly when collisions transfer momentum and
angular momentum to them. Thatâs because their large masses and rotational masses minimize their changes in velocity and angular velocity. Because of their small masses, children
experience the wildest rides.

1. Newtonâs first law of rotational motion: A rigid object that is
not wobbling and is not subject to any outside torques rotates at
a constant angular velocity, turning equal amounts in equal
times about a fixed axis of rotation.

6. Linear momentum: An objectâs linear momentum is its mass

2. Newtonâs second law of rotational motion: The net torque

to the force exerted on that object times the length of time that
force is exerted, or

exerted on an object is equal to that objectâs rotational mass
times its angular acceleration, or
net torque = rotational mass Âˇ angular acceleration. (2.1.2)
The angular acceleration points in the same direction as the torque.
This law doesnât apply to objects that are nonrigid or wobbling.
3. Relationship between force and torque: The torque produced

by a force is equal to the lever arm times the component of that
force perpendicular to the lever arm, or
torque = lever arm Âˇ force perpendicular to lever arm.

(2.1.3)

4. Rotational definition of work: The work done on an object is

equal to the torque exerted on that object times the angle (in
radians) through which that object rotates in the direction of the
torque, or
work = torque Âˇ angle (in radians).

(2.2.1)

5. Kinetic energy: An objectâs translational kinetic energy is

one-half its mass times the square of its speed, or
kinetic energy = 12 Âˇ mass Âˇ speed2.

(2.2.2)

An objectâs rotational kinetic energy is one-half its rotational
mass times the square of its angular speed, or
kinetic energy = Âˇ rotational mass Âˇ angular speed .

times its velocity, or
linear momentum = mass Âˇ velocity.

(2.3.1)

7. Definition of impulse: The impulse given to an object is equal

impulse = force Âˇ time.

(2.3.2)

8. Angular momentum: An objectâs angular momentum is its
rotational mass times its angular velocity, or

angular momentum = rotational mass Âˇ angular velocity.
(2.3.4)
9. Definition of angular impulse: The angular impulse given to
an object is equal to the torque exerted on that object times the
length of time that torque is exerted, or

angular impulse = torque Âˇ time.

(2.3.5)

10. Newtonâs third law of rotational motion: For every torque
that one object exerts on a second object, there is an equal but
oppositely directed torque that the second object exerts on the
first object.
11. Potential energy, acceleration, and force: An object experiences a force and accelerates in the direction that reduces its
total potential energy as quickly as possible. That force is equal
but opposite to the potential gradient, or

force = âpotential gradient.

Mechanical Objects
PART 1

ow that weâve surveyed the laws of motion, we can begin using those laws to explain the
behaviors of everyday objects. But while we can already address some of the central features
at work in a toy wagon, a weight machine, or a ski lift, weâre still missing a number of
mechanical concepts that are important in the world around us. In this chapter, we look at some of
those additional concepts.
One of the most important new concepts will be the feeling of acceleration. If we treat acceleration passively, it can be fairly uninteresting: we push on the cart, and the cart accelerates. If we
think of it more actively, thoughâfor example, if we envision ourselves on a roller coaster as it
plummets down that first big hillâthen the experience of acceleration becomes much more intriguing. In fact, we might even need to hold on to our hats.

ACTIVE LEARNING
EXPERIMENTS

Swinging Water Overhead

Courtesy Lou Bloomfield

To examine some of the novel effects of acceleration, try
experimenting with a bucket of water. If youâre careful,
you can swing the bucket over your head and upside
down without spilling a drop. In the process, youâll be
demonstrating a number of important physical concepts.
To do this experiment, youâll need a bucket with a
handle. (You might substitute some equivalent container;
even a plastic cup will do in a pinch.) Fill the bucket

72

partway full of water and then hold it by the handle so
that it hangs down by your side.
Now swing the bucket backward about an eighth of a
turn and bring it forward rapidly. In one smooth, fluid
motion, swing it forward, up, and over your head. Continue this motion all the way around behind you and then
bring the bucket forward again. Youâll need to swing the
bucket quickly to avoid getting wet. As you swing the

Spring Scales

bucket around and around, youâll notice that the water
stays in it even when it travels over your head and is
upside down. Why doesnât the water fall out?
You can carry this experiment a step further by swinging the bucket at various speedsâthat is, if you donât mind
getting wet. What will happen if you swing the bucket less
rapidly or more rapidly? Is the pull stronger or weaker
when you swing less rapidly? more rapidly? Is there any
relationship between the upward pull you feel from the
inverted bucket and the waterâs tendency to remain inside?
You might vary this experiment in several ways. Try
swinging a plastic cup held in your fingers, or try placing

73

a full wine glass in the bucket and swinging the two
objects together. In the latter case, youâll find that the wine
will stay in the glass and the glass will stay at the bottom
of the bucket, even when the bucket is upside down.
By the way, the hardest part of all these tricks is stopping. To avoid a catastrophe, youâll need to do the same
thing you did to get started, only in reverse. Come to a
smooth, gradual stop about an eighth of a turn in front of
you, and then let the bucket loosely drop back to your
side. If you stop moving the bucket too abruptly, the
water, wine, or glass will spill or smash. Why do you suppose that happens?

Chapter Itinerary
In this chapter, we examine three types of everyday objects:
(1) spring scales, (2) ball sports: bouncing, and (3) carousels and roller coasters. In Spring Scales, we review the relationship between mass and weight and explore how the distortion of a spring can be used to measure an objectâs
weight. In Ball Sports: Bouncing, we study how balls store
and return energy and how their bouncing depends both on
their own characteristics and on those of the objects they
hit. And in Carousels and Roller Coasters, we look at how
acceleration gives rise to gravity-like apparent forces that
can make us scream with delight at the amusement park.
For a more complete preview of what we examine in this

SECTION 3.1

chapter, skip ahead to the Chapter Summary and Important
Laws and Equations at the end of the chapter.
The concepts these objects illustrate can explain other
phenomena as well. Almost any solid object, from a mattress
to a diving board to a tire, behaves like a spring scaleâs spring
when you push on it. Bouncing balls offer a view of collisions
that will help you comprehend what happens when two cars
crash or when a hammer hits a nail. And the sensations associated with acceleration that you experience on a roller coaster
are also present when you ride in airplanes, on subways, or on
swing sets. When it comes to the physics of everyday objects,
there really is nothing new under the sun.

How much of you is there? From day to day, depending on how
much you eat, the amount of you stays approximately the
same. But how can you tell how much that is? The best measure
of quantity is mass: kilograms of gold, grain, or you. Mass is the

measure of an objectâs inertia and, as we saw in Section 1.1,
it doesnât depend on the objectâs environment or on gravity.
A kilogram box of cookies always has a mass of 1 kilogram, no
matter where in the universe you take it.
But mass is difficult to measure directly. Moreover, the
very concept of mass is only about 300 years old. Consequently, people began quantifying the material in an object by
measuring its weight. Spring scales eventually became one of
the simplest and most practical tools for accomplishing this
task, and they are still found in bathrooms and grocery stores
today. They really do contain springs, although these are normally hidden from view.
Questions to Think About: How is your weight related to your
mass? If Earthâs gravity became twice as strong, how would
your mass be affected? What about your weight? Does jumping
up and down change either your mass or your weight? If you
stand on a strong spring, how does your weight affect the
shape of the spring? Why should there be a relationship
between your weight and how much the spring bends?
Experiments to Do: Find a hanging spring scale of the type
used in the produce section of a grocery store and watch the

74

CHAPTER 3 Mechanical Objects

scaleâs basket and weight indicator as you put objects in the
basket. What happens to the basket as you fill it up? Can you
find a relationship between the basketâs height and the weight
reported by the scale? If you drop something into the basket,
instead of lowering it gently, how does the scale respond? Why
does the weight indicator bounce back and forth rhythmically?
What happens to the gravitational potential energy of the
dropped item?
Now find a spring bathroom scaleâthe short, flat kind
with a rotating dial. Stand on it. Why does it read your correct

weight only when you are standing still? If you jump upward,
how does the scaleâs reading change? What about if you let
yourself drop? Bounce up and down gently. How does the
scaleâs average reading compare with your normal weight?
Does bouncing really change your weight? You can also
change the scaleâs reading by pushing on the floor, wall, or
other nearby objects. Which way must you push to increase
the scaleâs reading? to decrease it? When you change the
reading in these ways, are you actually changing your
weight?

Why You Must Stand Still on a Scale
When you stand on a bathroom scale, the scale doesnât directly measure your weight.
Thatâs because your weight is a force that Earthâs gravity exerts on you, not on the scale, so
it affects the scale only indirectly. What the scale actually reports is how much upward
force it exerts on you to keep you from falling. When youâre not falling or otherwise accelerating, the scale pushes you upward just as hard as your weight pulls you downward, so
knowing the scaleâs force on you is equivalent to knowing your weight.
That subtle difference between your weight and what the scale reports is important,
however, because it makes the weighing process sensitive to acceleration. If youâre
accelerating, the scale wonât report your true weight. For example, when you jump up
and down on the scale, the scaleâs reading varies wildly. You accelerate as you jump, so
the two forces acting on youâyour weight downward and the scaleâs push upwardâ
donât sum to zero. If you want an accurate measurement of your weight, therefore, you
have to stand still.
Even when you stand still, weighing is not a perfect way to quantify the amount of
material in your body. Thatâs because your weight depends on your environment. If you
always weigh yourself in the same place, the readings will be pretty consistent, as long as
you donât routinely eat a dozen jelly doughnuts for lunch. But if you moved to the moon,
where gravity is weaker, youâd weigh only about one-sixth as much as on Earth. Even a
move elsewhere on Earth will affect your weight: Earth bulges outward slightly at the equator, and gravity there is about 0.5% weaker than at the poles. That change, together with a
small acceleration effect due to Earthâs rotation, means that a scale will read 1.0% less
when you move from the north pole to the equator. Obviously, moving south is not a useful
weight-loss plan.
Check Your Understanding #1: Space Merchants
Youâre opening a company that will export gourmet food from Earth to the moon. You want the
package labels to be accurate at either location. How should you label the amount of food in each
packageâby mass or by weight?
Answer:

You should sell by massâfor example, by kilogram or pound-mass.

Why: If you label your product by weight, you are specifying the force that gravity exerts on it near
Earthâs surface. When itâs exported to the moon, such a product will weigh just 1/6 as much, and your
company may be fined for selling underweight groceries. If you label the packages according to their
masses, that labeling will remain correct no matter where you ship the packages. Mass is the measure of inertia and depends only on the object, not on its environment.

Stretching a Spring
At the grocery store, you weigh a melon by placing it in the basket of a spring scale. Like
a bathroom scale, the grocery store scale canât measure the melonâs weight directly;

Spring Scales

instead, it reports how much upward force it exerts on the melon. As long as the melon
isnât accelerating, the scaleâs upward force on the melon is equal but opposite to the melonâs
weight, so measuring one force is equivalent to measuring the other. But how does the
spring scale determine how hard itâs pushing upward on the melon?
In keeping with its name, the spring scale uses a spring to push upward on the melon.
The beauty of that arrangement is that a simple relationship exists between a springâs length
and the forces itâs exerting on its ends. The spring scale determines how much upward force
itâs exerting on the melon by measuring the length of its spring.
The spring shown in Fig. 3.1.1 consists of a wire coil that pulls inward on its ends
when itâs stretched and pushes outward on them when itâs compressed. When that spring is
neither stretched nor compressed (Fig. 3.1.1a), it exerts no forces on its ends. If no other
forces act on this relaxed spring, each end is in equilibriumâit experiences zero net force.
As the phrase zero net force suggests, equilibrium occurs whenever the forces acting on an
object sum to zero so that the object doesnât accelerate. When you sit motionless in a chair,
for example, you are in equilibrium. The relaxed spring is also at its equilibrium length,
its natural length when you leave it alone. No matter how you distort this spring, it tries to
return to this equilibrium length.
Letâs attach the left end of our spring to a wall (Fig. 3.1.1b) and its right end to a moveable bar. When the bar isnât pulling or pushing on the springâs right end, that end is in
equilibrium at a particular locationâits equilibrium position. Since the springâs right end
naturally returns to this equilibrium position if the bar disturbs it and then lets go, the end
is in a stable equilibrium.
What happens if the bar moves the springâs right end to the right (Fig. 3.1.1c)? The
stretched spring now exerts a leftward force on that end, trying to restore it to its original
equilibrium position. Because the force that the spring exerts on its end acts to restore that
end to equilibrium, we call it a restoring force. The spring actually exerts restoring forces
on both of its ends, pulling them equally hard in opposite directions. Because the left end
of the spring is held in place by the wall, however, weâll focus our attention on its moveable
right end and the restoring force on that end.
The farther the bar stretches the spring to the right, the stronger its restoring force on
the right end becomes (Fig 3.1.1d). Remarkably, that restoring force is exactly proportional
to how far the bar has stretched the spring.
If the bar changes directions and moves the springâs right end to the left (Fig. 3.1.1e),
the compressed spring exerts a rightward force on its right end. Nonetheless, that force is
still a restoring force and it is still proportional to the springâs distortion.
In general, whenever a spring is distorted away from its equilibrium length, it exerts a
restoring force on its moveable end that is proportional to the distortion and points in the
opposite direction. This observation is expressed in Hookeâs law, named after the Englishman Robert Hooke, who discovered it in the late seventeenth century. This law can be
written in a word equation:
restoring force = âspring constant Âˇ distortion,

(3.1.1)

in symbols:
F = âk Âˇ x,
and in everyday language:
The stiffer the spring and the farther you stretch it, the harder it pulls back.
Here the spring constant, k, is a measure of the springâs stiffness. The larger the spring
constantâthat is, the firmer the springâthe larger the restoring force the spring exerts for

CHAPTER 3 Mechanical Objects

a given distortion. The negative signs in these equations indicate that a restoring force
always points in the direction opposite the distortion.

HOOKEâS LAW
The restoring force exerted by an elastic object is proportional to how far it has been
distorted from its equilibrium shape.

Springs are distinguished by their stiffness, as measured by their spring constants.
Some springs are soft and have small spring constantsâfor example, you need just one
finger to compress the spring in your retractable ballpoint pen. Other springs, like the
large ones that suspend an automobile chassis above the wheels, are firm and have
large spring constants. But no matter the stiffness, nearly all simple springs obey
Hookeâs law.
Hookeâs law is remarkably general and isnât limited to the behavior of coil springs.
Many objects respond to distortion with restoring forces that are proportional to how far
youâve distorted them away from their equilibrium lengthsâor, in the case of some complicated objects, their equilibrium shapes. Equilibrium shape is the shape an object adopts
when itâs not subject to any outside forces. If you bend a tree branch, it will push back with
a force proportional to how far it has been bent. If you pull on a rubber band, it will pull
back with a force proportional to how far it has been stretched, up to a point. If you squeeze
a mattress, it will push outward with a force proportional to how far it has been compressed. If a heavy truck bends a bridge downward, the bridge will push upward with a
force proportional to how far it has been bent (Fig. 3.1.2).
There is a limit to Hookeâs law, however. If you distort an object too far, it will usually
begin to exert less force than Hookeâs law demands. This is because you will have
exceeded the objectâs elastic limit and will have deformed it permanently in the process.
If you stretch a spring too far, it wonât return to its original equilibrium length when you
release it; if you bend a tree branch too far, it will break. As long as you stay within the
elastic limit, however, a great many things obey Hookeâs lawâa rope, a ruler, a tabletop,
and a trampoline.
Distorting a spring requires work. When you stretch a spring with your hand, pulling
its ends apart as they move apart, you transfer some of your energy to the spring. The spring
stores this energy as elastic potential energy. If you reverse the motion, the spring returns
most of this energy to your hand; the remainder is converted to thermal energy by frictional
effects inside the spring itself. Work is also required to compress, bend, or twist a spring.
In short, a spring that is distorted away from its equilibrium shape always contains elastic
potential energy.

As you watch people walk off the diving board at a pool, you notice that it bends downward by an
amount proportional to each diverâs weight. Explain.

(a)

Answer: The diving board is behaving as a spring, bending downward in proportion to the weight of
each diver.
Why: The heavier the diver, the more the board bends downward before exerting enough upward force
on the diver to balance the diverâs weight.

Check Your Figures #1: A Sinking Sensation
Youâre hosting a party in your third-floor apartment. When the first 10 guests begin standing in your
living room, you notice that the floor has sagged 1 centimeter in the middle. How far will the floor sag
when 20 guests are standing on it? when 100 guests are standing on it?
Answer: It will sag 2 centimeters and 10 centimeters (assuming that the floor doesnât break).
Why: A floor, like most suspended surfaces, behaves like a spring. Your floor distorts 1 cm before it
exerts an upward restoring force equal to the weight of 10 guests. It will thus distort 2 cm before
supporting 20 guests and 10 cm before supporting 100 guests. While this distortion should be within
the elastic limit of the floor beams, it may cause the plaster and paint to crack. If the beams break,
the floor will collapse.

How a Hanging Grocery Scale Measures Weight
Before you weigh another melon, letâs examine the grocery store scale. It contains a coil
spring thatâs responsible for the weighing process. One end of that spring is suspended
from the ceiling, and the other end supports the weighing basket (Fig. 3.1.3). For the sake
of simplicity, letâs suppose the spring and the basket have negligible weights and that the
basket is effectively the bottom end of the spring. With the basket empty, the spring adopts
its equilibrium length and the basket is in a position of stable equilibrium. If you shift the
basket up or down and then let go of it, the spring will push it back to this position. When
you place a melon in the basket, the melonâs weight pushes the basket downward and spoils
its equilibrium. The basket starts descending and as it does, the spring stretches and begins
to exert an upward force on the basket. The more the spring stretches, the greater this
upward force so that eventually the spring is stretched just enough so that its upward restoring force exactly supports the melonâs weight. The basket is now in a new stable equilibrium positionâagain experiencing zero net force.
The scale, then, uses Hookeâs law to determine the weight of the melon. When the
basket has settled at its new equilibrium position, where the melonâs downward weight is
exactly balanced by the springâs upward restoring force, the amount the spring has stretched
is an accurate measure of the melonâs weight.
The scales in Fig. 3.1.3 differ only in the way they measure how far the spring has
stretched beyond its equilibrium length. In Fig. 3.1.3a, the scale uses a pointer attached
to the end of the spring, while in Fig. 3.1.3b, the scale uses a rack and pinion gear system
that converts the small linear motion of the stretching spring into a much more visible
rotary motion of the dial needle. The rack is the series of evenly spaced teeth attached to
the lower end of the spring; the pinion is the toothed wheel attached to the dial needle.
As the spring stretches, the rack moves downward, and its teeth cause the pinion to
rotate. The farther the rack moves, the more the pinion turns and the higher the weight
reported by the needle.
Each of these spring scales reports a number for the weight of the melon you put in the
basket. For that number to mean something, the scale has to be calibrated. Calibration is
the process of comparing a local device or reference to a generally accepted standard to
ensure accuracy. To calibrate a spring scale, the device or its reference components must be

measure just how far the spring stretches. Each spring is different, although spring manufacturers try to make all their springs as identical as possible.

If you pull the basket of a hanging grocery store scale downward 1 cm, it reports a weight of 5 N
(about 1.1 lbf) for the contents of its basket. If you pull the basket downward 3 cm, what weight will
it report?
Answer: The scale will read 15 N (about 3.3 lbf).
Why: The scaleâs dial is simply reporting the position of its basket. The dial is calibrated so that a
1-cm drop in the basket indicates that the spring is pulling up on it with a force of 5 N. Since the
springâs restoring force is described by Hookeâs law, a 3-cm drop in the basket means that the spring
is exerting an upward force of 15 N on the basket.

Fig. 3.1.4 When you step
on this bathroom scale, its
surface moves downward
slightly and compresses
a stiff spring. The extent
of this compression is
proportional to your weight,
which is reported by the
dial. Levers inside the
scale make it insensitive to
exactly where you stand.

Fig. 3.1.5 When you
place a melon in the
basket of a spring scale,
the basket and melon
bounce briefly about their
equilibrium position as the
scale gradually removes
their excess energy. Their
rhythmic motion about
the equilibrium position is
that of a mass on a spring
and is an example of a
harmonic oscillator.

Bouncing Bathroom Scales
As we noted earlier, the most common type of bathroom scale is also a spring scale
(Fig. 3.1.4). When you step on this kind of scale, you depress its surface and levers inside
it pull on a hidden spring. That spring stretches until it exerts, through the levers, an upward
force on you that is equal to your weight. At the same time, a rack and pinion mechanism
(see Fig. 3.1.3b) inside the scale turns a wheel with numbers printed on it. When the wheel
stops moving, you can read one of these numbers through a window in the scale. That
number depends on how far the spring has stretched and has been calibrated so that it accurately indicates your weight.
However, the wheel rocks briefly back and forth around your actual weight before it
settles down. The wheel moves because youâre bouncing up and down as the scale gradually gets rid of excess energy. When you first step on the scaleâs surface, its spring is not
stretched and it isnât pushing up on you at all. You begin to fall. As you descend, the spring
stretches and the scale begins to push up on your feet. By the time you reach the equilibrium height, where the scale is exactly supporting your weight, you are traveling downward quickly and coast right past that equilibrium. The scale begins to read more than
your weight.
The scale now accelerates you upward. Your descent slows, and you soon begin to rise
back toward equilibrium. Again you coast past equilibrium, but now the scale begins to
read less than your weight. You are bouncing up and down because you have excess energy
that is shifting back and forth between potential energy and kinetic energy. This bouncing
continues until sliding friction in the scale has converted it all into thermal energy. Only
then does the bouncing stop and the scale read your correct weight.
The bouncing that you experience about this stable equilibrium is a remarkable motion
(Fig. 3.1.5), one that weâll study in detail when we examine clocks in Chapter 9. You are
effectively a mass supported by a spring, and your rhythmic rise and fall is that of a
harmonic oscillator. Harmonic oscillators are so common and important in nature that
Chapter 9 is devoted to them. The details can wait, but there are two features of your present situation that Iâll point out now.
First, your total potential energy is at its minimum when youâre at the stable equilibrium. Even though both gravitational and elastic potentials are involved, their sum increases
as you shift away from the equilibrium. Since an object always accelerates so as to reduce
its total potential energy as quickly as possible, you always accelerate toward the stable
equilibrium. Because the restoring force you experience increases as you move farther
from the equilibrium, you reach your peak acceleration and potential energy at the moment
when you are farthest from equilibrium and are turning around to head back toward that
equilibrium.

Ball Sports: Bouncing

79

Second, your kinetic energy reaches its peak as you pass through the stable equilibrium. Having accelerated toward that equilibrium until the moment of arrival, youâre moving fast and coast right through it. But once you leave equilibrium, you begin to accelerate
toward it again. That acceleration is backward, opposite your velocity, so you are decelerating. Therefore, you reach your peak speed and kinetic energy at the moment you pass
through equilibrium. As you bounce up and down, waiting for the scale to waste your
excess energy, that energy transforms back and forth rhythmically between kinetic and
potential forms.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Equilibrium and Motionlessness
Misconception: An object at equilibrium is always motionless.
Resolution: An object at equilibrium is not accelerating, but its velocity may not be zero. If it was
moving when it reached equilibrium, it will coast through that equilibrium at constant velocity.

Check Your Understanding #4: Weighed Down
When you step on the surface of a spring bathroom scale, you can feel it move downward slightly.
How is the distance that the scaleâs surface moves downward when you step on it related to the
weight it reports?
Answer: The distance the scaleâs surface moves downward is proportional to the weight it reports.
Why: The scaleâs spring is connected to its surface by levers so that as the surface moves downward,
the spring distorts by a proportional amount. The springâs distortion is reported on the dial. Thus the
dialâs reading is proportional to the surfaceâs downward movement.

If you visit a toy or sporting goods store, youâll find many different ballsâalmost a unique ball for every sport or ball game.
These balls differ in more than just size and weight. Some are
very hard, others very soft; some are smooth, others rough or
ridged.
In this section weâll focus primarily on another differenceâtheir ability to bounce. A bouncy ball, for example,
bounces extraordinarily well, while a foam rubber ball
hardly bounces at all. Even balls that appear identical can
be very different; a new tennis ball bounces much better
than an old one. Weâll begin this section by exploring these
differences.

Questions to Think About: Is it possible for a ball to bounce
higher than the height from which it was dropped? Where does
a ballâs kinetic energy go as it bounces, and what happens to
the energy that doesnât reappear after the bounce? What happens when a ball bounces off a moving object, such as a baseball bat? What role does the baseball batâs structure have in
the bouncing process? Does it matter which part of a baseball
bat hits the ball?
Experiments to Do: Drop a ball on a hard surface and watch it
bounce. What happens to the ballâs shape during the bounce?
Hold the ball in your hands and push its surface inward with
your fingers. What is the relationship between the force it
exerts on your fingers and how far inward you dent it? Denting
the ball takes work. Why? How does the ballâs energy change
as it dents? What happens to the ballâs energy as its shape
returns to normal (to equilibrium)?
Drop the ball from various heights and see whether you
can find a simple relationship between the ballâs initial height
and the height to which it rebounds. Now drop the ball on a
soft surface, such as a pillow, or on a lively surface, such as an
inflated balloon. Why does the surface it hits change the way
the ball bounces?

Fig. 3.2.1 A bounce from
a wall has two halves:
(a) the collision and (b) the
rebound. During the
collision between the ball
and the wall, some of their
kinetic energy is
transformed into other
formsâan amount called
the collision energy. During
the rebound, some stored
energy is released as
kinetic energyâan amount
called the rebound energy.
The rebound energy is
always less than the
collision energy because
some energy is lost as
thermal energy. However, a
lively ball wastes less
energy than a dead one.

What would sports be like without balls? Basketball, baseball, tennis, golf, soccer, volleyball âŚ
the list of sports that depend on them is almost endlessâand nearly all those ball sports involve
bouncing. While most bounces are obvious, others are more subtle. When a baseball hits a bat
or a player kicks a soccer ball, those balls are actually bouncing, albeit from moving objects.
Why does a ball bounce, and how do its characteristics and circumstances affect its bounce?
Weâll start by looking at a ballâs shape. When nothing pushes on the ball, it adopts its
equilibrium shape, typically a sphere. The term equilibrium shape, of course, is one weâve
seen already; the previous section used it to describe springs. Thatâs no coincidence, for
balls and springs have some important similarities. Chief among those similarities is their
ability to store and return energy. Both balls and springs store energy as you distort them
away from their equilibrium shapes and release that stored energy when you let them return
to their equilibrium shapes.
This energy storage and return is evident when a ball bounces off a hard surface. As those
two objects collide (Fig. 3.2.1a), the ballâs surface distorts and its elastic potential energy
increases. The energy responsible for that distortion is extracted from the kinetic energies of
the colliding objects. As the two objects subsequently rebound (Fig. 3.2.1b), the ballâs surface
returns toward its equilibrium and its elastic potential energy decreases. That return to equilibrium releases energy that is added to the kinetic energies of the rebounding objects.
Weâll call the kinetic energy absorbed during the collision the collision energy and the
kinetic energy released during the rebound the rebound energy. How do those two energies compare? Since energy is conserved and the two objects appear unchanged by the
bounce, shouldnât the rebound energy equal the collision energy?
In fact, the two energies would be equal except for one important detail: the two objects
have changed. Their thermal energies have increased. As it distorts and then returns to
equilibrium, the ball wastes some of the collision energy as thermal energy, so the rebound
energy is always less than the collision energy (Fig. 3.2.2). While total energy is conserved
during the bounce, individual forms of energy are not. No physical law prevents kinetic
energy from becoming thermal energy, and it happens every bounce.

Fig. 3.2.2 When a tennis ball hits the
floor, it dents inward to store energy and
then rebounds somewhat more slowly than
it arrived. These images show the ballâs
position at 12 equally spaced times. Is the
ball bouncing to the left or the right? How
can you tell?

Known as the coefficient of restitution, this speed ratio can be squared to obtain the energy ratio.

Some balls bounce better than others. A bouncy ball is often called âlively,â and a ball
that doesnât bounce well is said to be âdead.â A lively ball is extremely elasticâit converts
most of the collision energy into elastic potential energy during the collision and converts
most of that elastic potential energy into rebound energy during the rebound. A dead ball,
on the other hand, is barely elastic at allâit converts most of the collision energy into thermal energy during the collision and converts most of whatâs left into thermal energy during
the rebound.
The ratio of rebound energy to collision energy (Table 3.2.1) determines how high a
ball will bounce when you drop it from rest onto a hard floor (Fig. 3.2.3). Before you drop
it, the ball has only gravitational potential energy, which is proportional to its height above
the floor (Eq. 1.3.2). That potential energy becomes kinetic energy as the ball falls and then
collision energy when it collides with the floor. The ballâs rebound energy becomes kinetic
energy as it rebounds from the floor and then gravitational potential energy as it rises. At its
peak, the ball has only gravitational potential energy, which is again proportional to its
height. The ratio of the ballâs rebound energy to its collision energy is therefore equal to the
ratio of its final height to its initial height.
For an ideally elastic ball, these ratios are 1.00; all the collision energy is returned as
rebound energy and the ball rebounds to its initial height. Known as elastic collisions, such
perfect bounces are common among the tiny atoms in a gas but are unattainable for ordinary objects; there are just too many ways for any large item to divert or dissipate energy,
including as thermal energy, sound, vibration, and light.
A real ball experiences inelastic collisionsâit wastes some of the collision energy as
thermal energy and rebounds to a lesser height. For example, a baseballâs rebound energy
is only 0.30 times its collision energy, so it will rebound to only 30% of its original height
(Fig. 3.2.3a). Without that dramatic energy loss during a bounce, baseball pitchers would
need to wear armor.

CHAPTER 3 Mechanical Objects

While that energy ratio is useful, a ball is traditionally characterized by a speed ratio:
its rebound speed divided by its collision speed. Here, the collision speed is how fast the
two objects approach one another before the bounce, and the rebound speed is how fast
those objects separate after the bounce. The speed ratio is known as the ballâs coefficient
of restitution:
coefficient of restitution =

rebound speed of ball
collision speed of ball

(3.2.1)

(see Table 3.2.1). The larger a ballâs coefficient of restitution, the faster it rebounds from a
surface for a given collision speed. For example, a basketballâs coefficient of restitution is
0.80, so when it bounces off the backboard during a foul shoot, its rebound speed is only
0.80 times its collision speed. That decrease in speed makes it easier for the ball to drop
into the basket after it bounces than before it bounces.
Since a ballâs kinetic energy is proportional to the square of its speed, its energy ratio
is simply the square of its speed ratio. Measuring those ratios is more than an academic
exercise because most of the organizations that govern ball sports specify their ballsâ coefficients of restitution. Itâs a matter of fairness and safety. For example, baseballs could
easily be made so lively that every game would be a home-run derby. Just think of all the
asterisks.
Balls bounce best when they store energy through compression rather than through
surface bending. Thatâs because most ball materials, such as leather or leather-like plastics,
experience lots of wasteful internal friction during bending. Since solid balls involve compression, they usually bounce well, whether theyâre made of rubber, wood, plastic, or metal.
Air-filled balls, however, bounce well only when properly inflated. A normal basketball,
which stores most of its energy in its compressed air, has a high coefficient of restitution. In
contrast, an underinflated basketball, which experiences lots of surface bending during a
collision, barely bounces at all. Similarly, a tennis ball bounces best when new; after a while,
the compressed air inside leaks out and the ballâs coefficient of restitution drops.

Check Your Understanding #1: A Game of Marbles
As you head into the park to play a game of marbles with your friends, several of the glass marbles
fall through a hole in your marble bag and bounce nicely on the granite walkway. How can a marble
bounce?
Answer: When the marble collides with the hard granite surface, it dents inward and converts most
of its kinetic energy into elastic potential energy. It then rebounds, converting this stored energy back
into kinetic energy as it bounces from the surface.
Why: An elastic marble has a very high coefficient of restitution and bounces well from a hard
surface.

How the Surface Affects the Bounce
Since the surface on which a ball bounces isnât perfectly hard, that surface also contributes
to the bouncing process. It distorts and stores energy when the ball hits it and returns some
of this stored energy to the rebounding ball. Overall, the collision energy is shared between
the ball and the surface, and each provides part of the rebound energy.
Just how the collision energy is distributed between the surface and ball depends on
how stiff each one is. During the bounce, they push on one another with equal but oppositely directed forces. Since the forces denting them inward are equal, the work done in
distorting each object is proportional to how far inward it dents. The object that dents farthest receives most of the collision energy.

Ball Sports: Bouncing

Since the ball usually distorts more than the surface it hits, most of the collision energy
normally goes into the ball. You might expect the ball to provide most of the rebound
energy, too. However, thatâs not always true. Some lively elastic surfaces store collision
energy very efficiently and return almost all of it as rebound energy. Since a relatively dead
ball wastes most of the collision energy it receives, a lively surfaceâs contribution to the
rebound energy can be very important to the bounce.
For example, a lively racket is critical to the game of tennis because the racketâs
strings provide much of the rebound energy as the ball bounces off the racket (Fig. 3.2.4).
The strings are livelier than the ball, so increasing the fraction of collision energy that is
invested in the strings actually speeds up the rebounding ball. Thatâs why a player who is
willing to sacrifice aiming accuracy for greater ball speed will string his racket relatively
loosely. The looser strings will receive more of the collision energy and return almost all
of it as rebound energy.
Trampolines and springboards are even more extreme examples, with surfaces so lively
that they can make people bounce. People, like beanbags, have coefficients of restitution
near zero; when you land on a trampoline, it receives and stores most of the collision
energy and then provides most of the rebound energy.
The stiffnesses of the ball and surface also determine how much force each object
exerts on the other and thus how quickly the collision proceeds. When both objects are very
hard, the forces involved are large and the acceleration is rapid. Thus a steel ball rebounds
very quickly from a concrete floor because the two exert enormous forces on one another.
If the ball or surface is relatively soft, the forces are weaker and the acceleration is slower.
What if the surface that a ball hits isnât very massive? In that case, the surface may do
part or all of the âbouncing.â During the bounce, the ball and the surface accelerate in
opposite directions and share the rebound energy. Massive surfaces, such as floors and
walls, accelerate little and receive almost none of the rebound energy. But when the surface
a ball hits is not very massive, you may see it accelerate. For example, when a ball hits a
lamp on the coffee table, the ball will do most of the accelerating, but the lamp is likely to
fall over, too.
Similarly, when a baseball strikes a baseball bat, the ball and bat accelerate in opposite
directions. The more massive the bat, the less it accelerates. To ensure that most of the
rebound energy went to the baseball, the legendary hitters of the early twentieth century
used massive bats. Such bats are no longer in vogue because theyâre too difficult to swing.
But in the early days of baseball, when pitchers were less skillful, massive bats drove many
long home runs.
Check Your Understanding #2: The Game Begins
You are playing the game of marbles on a soft dirt field. The goal is to knock glass marbles out of a
circle by hitting them with other marbles. You initially drop several marbles onto the ground inside
the circle, and they hardly bounce at all. What prevents them from bouncing well here?
Answer: The soft dirt distorts more than the hard marble and receives most of the collision energy. It
converts most of that energy into thermal energy so the marble rebounds weakly.
Why: While a marble bounces nicely on a hard surface, the dirt is soft and receives virtually all the
collision energy when the hard marble hits it. The dirt distorts during the impact but stores little
energy because itâs not very elastic. The marble doesnât rebound much.

How a Moving Surface Affects the Bounce
When a moving ball hits a stationary bat, they bounce. When a moving bat hits a stationary
ball, they still bounce. In fact, any time the bat and ball approach one another and collide,
itâs a bounce and everything weâve discussed about bouncing applies. The ballâs coefficient
of restitution, for example, is still the ratio of the ballâs rebound speed to its collision speed.

Fig. 3.2.5 (a) Before they collide, the bat and ball are approaching one another at an overall speed
of 200 km/h. (b) After the collision, the two are separating from one another at a speed of 110 km/h.
However, because the bat is moving toward the pitcher at 100 km/h, the outgoing ball is traveling at
210 km/h in that same direction.

But when the bat is moving before or after the bounce, we clearly have to be careful what
we mean by collision speed and rebound speed.
Collision speed is neither the speed of the ball nor the speed of the bat; itâs the speed
at which those two objects approach one another before the bounce. Similarly, rebound
speed is the speed at which the objects separate from one another after the bounce. Technically, both speeds stem from the difference between the batâs velocity and the ballâs velocity. However, as long as each object is heading directly toward or away from the other
object, collision and rebound speeds are relatively simple to calculate. When the bat and
ball are heading in opposite directions, you add their speeds and when theyâre heading in
the same direction, you subtract their speeds.
That simple approach should be familiar from watching cars on the highway. When
two cars are moving 60 mph in opposite directions on a narrow road, they are approaching
one another at a hair-raising 120 mph. Letâs hope they donât collide. When a car traveling
60 mph comes up behind a second car traveling 55 mph in the same direction, however,
they are approaching one another at a leisurely 5 mph. If they collide, itâll be only a
fender-bender.
We can use these observations about speeds and bouncing to explain why the baseball
you just hit is now traveling over the center fielderâs head. Letâs suppose that, right before
the collision (Fig. 3.2.5a), the pitched baseball was approaching home plate at 100 km/h
(62 mph) and that, as you swung to meet the ball, your bat was moving toward the pitcher
at 100 km/h. Since each object is moving toward the other, their collision speed is the sum
of their individual speeds, or 200 km/h (124 mph).
The baseballâs coefficient of restitution is 0.55, so after the collision (Fig. 3.2.5b) their
rebound speed was only 0.55 times their collision speed, or 110 km/h. The outgoing ball
and the swinging bat separate from one another at 110 km/h. Since the bat is still moving
toward the pitcher at 100 km/h, the ball must be traveling toward the pitcher even faster: at
100 km/h plus 110 km/h or a total speed of 210 km/h (130 mph)! Thatâs why the baseball
flies past everyone in the outfield and into the stands.
Check Your Understanding #3: Marble Frames of Reference
Two of you flick your marbles into the circle simultaneously from opposite sides of the circle, and
they collide head-on. Each marble was traveling forward at 1 m/s (3.3 ft/s). How quickly were the two
marbles approaching one another just before they hit?
Answer: They were approaching at 2 m/s (6.6 ft/s).
Why: The velocities reported in the question are those observed by people sitting still with respect to
the circle. Since the marbles are heading toward one another, you must add their speeds to obtain
the collision speed.

Ball Sports: Bouncing

85

Surfaces Also Bounce âŚ and Twist and Bend
Weâve seen how a surface affects a ball when they bounce. Now letâs look at how the ball
affects the surface. When you swing your bat into a pitched ball, the bat doesnât continue
on exactly as before. The ball pushes on the bat during the collision, and the bat responds
in a number of interesting ways.
First, the ballâs impact force causes the bat to accelerate backward during the collision,
so its speed toward the pitcher decreases slightly. Since the ball finishes its rebound from
the slower-moving bat, the ball doesnât bounce back toward the pitcher quite as fast it
would if the bat had maintained its speed. Increasing the batâs mass reduces this slowing
effect, but it also makes the bat harder to swing.
Second, the ballâs impact force can also produce a torque on the bat about its center of
mass, so that the bat undergoes angular acceleration (Fig. 3.2.6). Together, the batâs acceleration and angular acceleration produce interesting effects on the batâs handle. The batâs
acceleration tends to jerk its handle away from the pitcher, while its angular acceleration
tends to jerk its handle toward the pitcher. The extent of these two opposing motions
depends on just where the ball hits the bat. If the ball hits the batâs center of percussion,
the two motions cancel and the bat handle moves forward steadily (Fig. 3.2.6c). The smooth
feel of such a collision explains why the center of percussion, located about 7 inches from
the end of the bat, is known as a âsweet spot.â
Third, the ballâs impact often causes the bat to vibrate. Like a xylophone bar struck by
a mallet (Fig. 3.2.7a), the bat bends back and forth rapidly with its ends and center moving
in opposite directions (Fig. 3.2.7b). These vibrations sting your hands and can even break
a wooden bat. However, near each end of the bat, thereâs a point that doesnât move when
the bat vibratesâa vibrational node. When the ball hits the bat at its node, no vibration
occurs. Instead, the bat emits a crisp, clear âcrackâ and the ball travels farther. Fortunately,
the batâs vibrational node and its center of percussion almost coincide, so you can hit the
ball with both sweet spots at once.
As these handle motions and bending vibrations illustrate, the science and engineering
of bats are surprisingly complicated. Thatâs why bat manufacturers are forever developing
better, more potent ones. Multiwalled aluminum, titanium, and composite bats are the latest examples. Each of these hollow bats has a thin outer wall that dents considerably on
impact with the ball and therefore receives much of the collision energy. Because that wall
is also highly elastic, nearly all this energy emerges as rebound energy as the wall returns
to its equilibrium shape. As a bonus, the batâs light outer wall and massive inner wall ensure
that it retains very little energy in its vibrations following the bounce.
Unlike the hard surface of a wooden bat, which barely dents and thus barely participates in the energy storage process, one of these hi-tech bats acts as a trampolineâit stores
and returns so much of the collision energy that it substantially increases the outgoing
speed of the batted ball. You can find equally hi-tech equipment at the golf shop or tennis
store. Weâre in an era in which scientific analysis and design are radically altering sports.
Check Your Understanding #4: Mass and Marbles
The marbles youâre playing with are not all the same size and mass. You notice that larger marbles
are particularly effective at knocking other marbles out of the circle. You decide to use a 10-cmdiameter glass ball as a marble, expecting to clean out the entire circle. But when you flick it with
your thumb, your thumb merely bounces off. Why doesnât the glass ball move forward quickly?
Answer: The glass ball is so much more massive than your thumb that your thumb receives almost
all the rebound energy. Your thumb bounces, not the glass ball.
Why: In any collision, itâs the least massive object that experiences the greatest acceleration and that
receives the largest share of the rebound energy. The effect is similar to what would happen if you
swung a light aluminum baseball bat at a pitched bowling ball. The bat would rebound wildly but the
bowling ball would continue to travel toward the catcher. This same effect is true in automobile collisions, where a massive sedan is much less disturbed than the tiny subcompact with which it collides.

As your sports car leaps forward at a green light, youâre pressed
firmly back against your seat. It feels as though gravity were
somehow pulling you down and backward at the same time. Itâs
not gravity pulling backward on you, though; itâs your own inertia trying to prevent you from accelerating forward with the car.
When this happens, youâre experiencing the feeling of
acceleration. We encounter this feeling many times each day,
whether through turning in an automobile or riding up several
floors in a fast elevator. Nowhere are the feelings of acceleration
more acute than at the amusement park. We accelerate up,
down, and around on the carousel, back and forth in the bumper
cars, and left and right in the scrambler. The ultimate ride, of
course, is the roller coaster, which is one big, wild experience
of acceleration. When you close your eyes on a straight stretch

of highway, you can hardly tell the automobile is moving. When
you close your eyes on a roller coaster, however, you have no
trouble feeling every last turn in the track. Itâs not the speed you
feel, but the acceleration. What is often called motion sickness
should really be called acceleration sickness.
Questions to Think About: How does your body feel its own
weight? When you swing a bucket full of water around in a
circle, as I asked you to do in the chapter opening, why does
the bucket pull outward on you? Why can you swing that
bucket completely over your head without spilling the water
inside it? What keeps you from falling out of a roller coaster as
it goes over the top of a loop-the-loop? Which car of a roller
coaster should you sit in to experience the best ride?
Experiments to Do: To begin associating the familiar sensations
of motion with the physics of acceleration, travel as a passenger
in a vehicle that makes lots of turns and stops. Close your eyes
and find whether you can tell which way the vehicle is turning
and when itâs starting or stopping. Which way do you feel pulled
when the vehicle turns left? turns right? starts? stops? How is
this sensation related to the direction of the vehicleâs acceleration? Now during a time when the vehicle is traveling at constant velocity on a level path, find if you feel any sensations that
tell you which way itâs heading. Try to convince yourself that itâs
heading backward or sideways rather than forward. Which is
easier to feel: your acceleration or your velocity?

Carousels and Acceleration

comes from their accelerations. Plenty of other amusement park rides suspend you sideways or upside down so that you feel ordinary gravity pulling at you from unusual angles.
But why pay for those when you can stand on your head for free? For a real thrill, you need
acceleration to give you the weightless feeling you experience as a roller coaster dives over
its first big hill or the intense heaviness you feel as it whips you around a sharp corner. Why
do accelerations give rise to these wonderful sensations, and why are they most extreme
when youâre sitting in the last car of the roller coaster?
To answer those questions, weâll need to take another look at acceleration. Although
you may start your day at an amusement park by riding its biggest roller coaster, some of
us might benefit from a warm-up. Letâs start with a simpler ride, a carousel.
When you ride on a carousel, you travel in a circular path around a central pivot.
Thatâs not the motion of an object thatâs simply coasting forward and exhibiting inertia. If
you were experiencing zero net force, you would travel in a straight line at a steady pace in
accordance with Newtonâs first law. However, since your path is circular instead of straight,
your direction of travel is changing; you are accelerating and must be experiencing a nonzero net force.
Which way are you accelerating? Remarkably, you are always accelerating toward the
center of the circle. To see why thatâs so, letâs look down on a simple carousel thatâs turning
counterclockwise at a steady pace (Fig. 3.3.1). At first, the boy riding the carousel is directly
east of its central pivot and is moving northward (Fig. 3.3.1a). If nothing were pulling on
the boy, he would continue northward and fly off the carousel. Instead, he follows a circular
path by accelerating toward the pivotâthat is, toward the west. As a result, his velocity
turns toward the northwest and he heads in that direction. To keep from flying off the
carousel, he must continue to accelerate toward the pivot, which is now southwest of him
(Fig. 3.3.1b). His velocity turns toward the west, and he follows the circle in that direction.
And so it goes (Fig. 3.3.1c).
The boyâs body is always trying to go in a straight line, but the carousel keeps pulling
him inward so that he accelerates toward the central pivot. The boy is experiencing uniform circular motion. Uniform means that the boy is always moving at the same speed,
although his direction keeps changing. Circular describes the path the boy follows as he
moves, his trajectory.
Like any object undergoing uniform circular motion, the boy is always accelerating
toward the center of the circle. An acceleration of this type, toward the center of a circle,
is called a centripetal acceleration and is caused by a centrally directed force, a centripetal force. A centripetal force is not a new, independent type of force like gravity
but the net result of whatever forces act on the object. Centripetal means âcenter-seeking,â and a centripetal force pushes the object toward that center. The carousel uses
support forces and friction to exert a centripetal force on the boy, and he experiences a
centripetal acceleration. Amusement park rides often involve centripetal acceleration
(Fig. 3.3.2).
The amount of acceleration the boy experiences depends on his speed and the radius
of the carousel. The faster the boy is moving and the smaller the radius of his circular trajectory, the more he accelerates. His acceleration is equal to the square of his speed divided
by the radius of his path.
We can also determine the boyâs acceleration from the carouselâs angular speed and
its radius. The faster the carousel turns and the larger the radius of the boyâs circular trajectory, the more he accelerates. His acceleration is equal to the square of the carouselâs
angular speed times the radius of his path. We can express these two relationships as word
equations:

COMMON MISCON CEPT I O N S: Centrifugal Force
Misconception: As you swing an object in a circle, that object is pulled outward by âcentrifugal
force.â
Resolution: If the object were free of forces, inertia would cause it to travel in a straight line. But
because you are pulling the object inward, it accelerates inward and its path bends into a circle.
Since you are exerting an inward force on the object, it is exerting an outward force on you, in
accordance with Newtonâs third law. However, that outward force acts on you, not on the object.
There is no outward âcentrifugal forceâ acting on the object itself.

Check Your Understanding #1: Banking on a Curve
Your racing car comes to a banked, left-hand turn, which it completes easily. Why is it essential that
a racetrack turn be banked so that it slopes downhill toward the center of the turn?
Answer: A banked turn is needed so that the support force exerted by the racetrack on the carâs
wheels can provide at least some of the centripetal force needed to accelerate the car around the
turn.
Why: As a car and driver travel around a circular turn, they are accelerating toward the center of the
track and require a huge centripetal force inward. On a level track, the only horizontal force available
is static friction between the ground and the carâs tires. If static friction is unable to provide enough
inward force, the car will skid off the track, following a straight-line path. This type of accident is
typical of a highway curve on an icy day and is why designers bank the curves. The banks are ramps
sloping down toward the center so that the horizontal component of the support force exerted by the
track on the carâs wheels provides an additional, inward, centripetal force to help that car accelerate
around the curve.

Check Your Figures #1: Going for a Spin
Some children are riding on a playground carousel with a radius of 1.5 m (4.9 ft). The carousel turns
once every 2 s. How quickly are the children accelerating?
Answer: They are accelerating about 15 m/s2 (50 ft/s2).
Why: Because the children are in uniform circular motion, their acceleration is given by Eq. 3.3.1.
The carousel turns once every 2 s, so its angular velocity is 2Ď radians divided by 2 s. Omitting radians
because theyâre the natural unit of angle, the carouselâs angular velocity is Ď 1/s. Since its radius is
1.5 m, the childrenâs acceleration is
childrenâs acceleration = (Ď 1/s) 2 Âˇ 1.5 m = 14.8 m/s2.
Since our measurements of the carouselâs radius and its turning time are accurate only to about 10%,
our calculation of the childrenâs acceleration is accurate only to about 10%. We report it as 15 m/s2
(50 ft/s2).

The Experience of Acceleration
Nothing is more central to the laws of motion than the relationship between force and
acceleration. Until now, weâve looked at forces and noticed that they can cause accelerations; now letâs take the opposite perspective, looking at accelerations and noticing that
they require forces. For you to accelerate, something must push or pull on you. Just where
and how that force is exerted on you determines what you feel when you accelerate.
The backward sensation you feel as your car accelerates forward is caused by your
bodyâs inertia, its resistance to acceleration (Fig. 3.3.3). For you to accelerate forward with
the car, something must push you forward; otherwise, inertia will keep you in steady
motion as the accelerating car drives out from under you. Fortunately, your seat provides
you with that forward push. But the seat canât exert a force uniformly throughout your
body. Instead, it pushes only on your back, and your back then pushes on your bones, tissues, and internal organs to make them accelerate forward. Each piece of tissue or bone is
responsible for the forward force needed to accelerate forward the tissue in front of it. A
whole chain of forces, starting from your back and working forward toward your front,
causes your entire body to accelerate forward.
Letâs compare this situation with what happens when youâre standing motionless on
the floor. Since gravity exerts a downward force on you thatâs distributed uniformly
throughout your body, each part of your body has its own independent weight; these individual weights, taken together, add up to your total weight. The floor, for its part, is exerting
an upward support force on you that keeps you from accelerating downward through its
surface. But the floor canât exert a force uniformly throughout your body. Instead, it pushes
only on your feet, and your feet then push on your bones, tissues, and internal organs to
keep them from accelerating downward. Each piece of tissue or bone is responsible for the
upward force needed to keep the tissue above it from accelerating downward. A whole
chain of forces, starting from your feet and working upward toward your head, keeps your
entire body from accelerating downward.
As you probably noticed, the two previous paragraphs are very similarâand so are the
sensations of gravity and acceleration. When the ground is preventing you from falling, you
feel âheavyâ; your body senses all the internal forces needed to support its pieces so that
they donât accelerate, and you interpret these sensations as weight. When the car seat is
causing you to accelerate forward, you also feel âheavyâ; your body senses all the internal
forces needed to accelerate its pieces forward, and you interpret these sensations as weight.
This time you experience the weight-like sensation toward the back of the car.
Try as you may, you canât distinguish the weight-like sensation that you experience as
you accelerate from the weight sensation you experience due to gravity. And youâre not the
only one fooled by acceleration. Even the most sophisticated laboratory instruments canât

determine directly whether they are experiencing gravity or are accelerating. However,
despite the convincing sensations, the backward heavy feeling in your gut as you accelerate
forward is the result of inertia and is not due to a real backward force.
Weâll call this experience a feeling of acceleration. It always points in the direction
opposite the acceleration that causes it, and its strength is proportional to that acceleration.
When you turn your car to the left, youâre accelerating leftward and experience a rightward
feeling of acceleration. The tighter your turn, the stronger that feeling of acceleration
becomes. When youâre not driving and can safely close your eyes, you should be able to
sense both the direction and amount of each acceleration you make.
So what does the boy on the spinning carousel feel? Since he is accelerating inward,
toward the center of the circle, he experiences a feeling of acceleration outward, away
from the center of the circle. Although the boyâs actual weight canât change, his feeling of
acceleration can have any strength. If the carousel is spinning fast enough, he can experience a feeling of acceleration that is much stronger than his weight. Thatâs why heâs holding on tight!
Since you often compare your feelings of acceleration to your feeling of weight, it is
customary to measure feelings of acceleration in gâs, where 1 g (1 gravity) is equal to the
feeling of your actual weight. In this context, it is also customary to measure acceleration
in gâs, where 1 g is 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2), the acceleration due to gravity. These two definitions
lead to a simple observation: a 1-g acceleration produces a 1-g feeling of acceleration in the
opposite direction. For example, a 1-g inward acceleration on a playground carousel produces a 1-g outward feeling of acceleration. If you accelerate five times that quickly, on the
scrambler or on an airplane maneuvering sharply, your 5-g acceleration will produce a 5-g
feeling of acceleration in the opposite direction.
As weâve seen, you experience a backward feeling of acceleration when you accelerate
forward in your car. However, you donât experience this feeling of acceleration all by itself;
you also experience the downward feeling of your weight. Together these two effects feel
like an especially strong weight at an angle somewhere between straight down and the back
of the car (Fig. 3.3.4a). Weâll call the combined feelings of weight and acceleration your
apparent weight. The faster you accelerate forward, the stronger your apparent weight
becomes and the more it points toward the back of the car (Fig. 3.3.4b).
You feel apparent weight because the seat is pushing on you, both to support your
actual weight and to make you accelerate. In fact, your apparent weight is equal but opposite to the real force that the seat is exerting on you. As you accelerate forward in your car,
the seat pushes you upward and forward, and your apparent weight is downward and backward (Fig. 3.3.4).
Like feeling of acceleration, apparent weight is customarily measured in gâs. When
you slam the carâs accelerator pedal to the floor and accelerate forward rapidly, your apparent weight may reach 2 g. The seat is then pushing you forward and upward with a force
thatâs twice as large as your actual weight, and youâre pushing back just as hard. No wonder
youâre pressed tightly into the seat!
Check Your Understanding #2: The Feel of a Tight Turn
Youâre sitting in the passenger seat of a racing car that is moving rapidly along a level track. The track
takes a sharp turn to the left, and you find yourself thrown against the door to your right. What horizontal forces are acting on you, and what feelings of acceleration do you experience?
Answer: The car seat and door are exerting a leftward force on you, causing you to accelerate leftward
with the car. You also experience a rightward feeling of acceleration as your inertia acts to keep you
from accelerating leftward.
Why: As the car turns left, it accelerates toward the left. The car seat and right door together exert a
leftward force on you to prevent the car from driving out from under you. Because it has mass, your
body resists this leftward acceleration. You feel your body trying to go in a straight line, which would
carry it out the right door of the car as the car accelerates toward the left.

Carousels and Roller Coasters

Roller Coaster Acceleration
Weâre now prepared to look at a roller coaster and understand what you feel when you go
over hills (Fig. 3.3.5) and loop-the-loops (Fig. 3.3.6). Every time the roller coaster accelerates, you experience a feeling of acceleration in the direction opposite your acceleration.
That feeling of acceleration gives you an apparent weight thatâs different from your actual
weight.
As we saw with a car, rapid horizontal accelerations tip your apparent weight in the
direction opposite your acceleration. A roller coaster, however, can do something a car
normally canâtâit can accelerate downward! In that case, the feeling of acceleration you
experience is upward and opposes your downward feeling of weight. The two feelings at
least partially cancel, so that your apparent weight points weakly downward or perhaps, if
the downward acceleration is fast enough, points upward.
There is one more possibility: if you accelerate downward at just the right rate, your
upward feeling of acceleration will exactly cancel your downward feeling of weight. Your
apparent weight will then be zero, and youâll feel perfectly weightless. Since your feeling
of weight is 1 g downward, perfect cancellation occurs when your feeling of acceleration
is 1 g upward. You must be accelerating downward at 1 g; you must be in free fall!
When youâre falling, you feel perfectly weightless. Your apparent weight is zero, and
nothing is supporting you. Because your hat and sunglasses are falling with you, nothing is
supporting them, either. If they come off your head, they will hover around you as you all
fall together.
Similarly, your internal organs donât need to support one another as they fall, and the
absence of internal support forces gives rise to the exhilarating sensation of free fall. Our
bodies are very sensitive to even partial weightlessness, and this falling sensation is half the
fun of a roller coaster. An astronaut falling freely in space has this disquieting weightless
feeling for days on end. No wonder astronauts have such frequent troubles with motion (or,
rather, acceleration) sickness.
Because a roller coaster is attached to a track, however, its rate of downward acceleration can actually exceed that of a freely falling object. In those special situations, the track
will be assisting gravity in pushing the roller coaster downward. As a rider, youâll be pushed
downward, too, and your apparent weight will point upward, as though the world had
turned upside down!

Check Your Understanding #3: Drop Tower Panic
A drop tower is a terrifying amusement park ride in which you are strapped into a seat, lifted high in
the air, and then dropped. While youâre in free fall, what is your apparent weight?
Answer: Your apparent weight is zero.
Why: As you fall freely, you are accelerating downward at 1 g, the full acceleration due to gravity. The
1-g upward feeling of acceleration you experience exactly matches your downward weight, so that
your apparent weight is zero. You feel perfectly weightless.

Roller Coaster Loop-the-Loops
Figure 3.3.7 shows a single-car roller coaster at various points along a simple track with
one hill and one loop-the-loop. You are riding in the car, and your weight, feeling of acceleration, and apparent weight are indicated with arrows of varying lengths that show each
vector quantityâs direction and magnitude. The longer the arrow, the greater the magnitude
of the quantity that it represents.
At the top of the first hill (Fig. 3.3.7a), the single-car roller coaster is almost stationary.
You feel only your weight, straight downânothing exciting yet. However, as soon as the
car begins its descent, accelerating down the track, a feeling of acceleration appears

pointing up the track (Fig. 3.3.7b). Your feelings of weight and acceleration together give
you an apparent weight that is much less than 1 g and points down and into the track. Most
people find this sudden reduction in apparent weight to be terrifying, so youâre welcome to
scream!
On Earth, weightless feelings canât last. They occur only during downward acceleration and disappear as your car levels off near the bottom of the hill. By the time the car
begins its rise into the loop-the-loop, it is traveling at maximum speed and has begun to
accelerate upward (Fig. 3.3.7c). This upward acceleration of about 2 g creates a downward
feeling of acceleration of about 2 g. Your apparent weight is about 3 g downward, and
youâre pressed tightly into your seat.
As the car climbs the right side of the loop-the-loop against gravity, its speed decreases
somewhat and its path bends inward, toward the center of the loop. Halfway up the right
side, youâre accelerating inward and downward, so your feeling of acceleration is outward
and upward (Fig. 3.3.7d). Your apparent weight is greater than 1 g outward, away from the
center of the loop, and youâre still pressed into your seat (Fig. 3.3.8).
At the top of the loop-the-loop (Fig. 3.3.7e), the carâs path is still bending inward,
toward the center of the loop. Youâre accelerating downward, and your feeling of acceleration points in the opposite directionâupward toward the sky. That upward feeling of acceleration is greater than your downward feeling of weight, so your apparent weight is upward
(Fig. 3.3.6)!
Not only does the inverted car stay on its track, but you also remain pressed into your
seat. Actually, the car is pushing downward on you to help gravity accelerate you around
the loop. If your hat were to come off at the top of the loop, it would land in your seat, even
though that seems to involve some sort of upward movement. In fact, the car is accelerating
downward at more than 1 g, while your hat has only the 1-g downward acceleration of a
freely falling object. Gravity and the track together push the car downward so fast that it
overtakes the hatâyour hat is falling, but the car is plummeting even faster.

Carousels and Roller Coasters

Fig. 3.3.8 The roller coaster pushes these riders inward as it travels around the loop-the-loop. The
riders experience strong feelings of acceleration outward and can hardly tell that theyâre upside down.

In truth, a typical loop-the-loop isnât perfectly circular; itâs more sharply curved on
top than on its sides or bottom. This varying radius curve, known as a clothoid, is chosen for safety and comfort. By sharpening the curve only on top, the clothoid track
maximizes the downward acceleration there while reducing the accelerations elsewhere
on the track. High acceleration is important only when the roller coaster is upside
down. Everywhere else, it simply makes the riders feel heavy and uncomfortable, particularly at the bottom of the loop where the coaster is traveling fastest and accelerating
upward rapidly.
Most roller coaster tracks are designed so that their riders are always pressed into their
seats, even when the cars go upside down. On loop-the-loops, for example, these tracks
ensure that the riders are accelerating inward rapidly enough to remain seated securely. In
principle, roller coasters that travel on such tracks donât need seat belts to prevent their
riders from falling out (although seat belts are comforting to the passengers and insurance
companies). Their ridersâ apparent weights are always directed toward the track, so the
riders and their seats push against one another throughout the ride.
However, some roller coaster tracks use special cars and restraints that allow them to
direct their ridersâ apparent weights away from the track. At such moments, the cars must
pull on their riders to keep them from popping out of their seats. These roller coasters can
and do go upside down without the strong downward accelerations needed to press their
riders into their seats. The riders are then hanging from their inverted cars, and if one of
them loses a hat, it falls to the ground rather than into the car.
What about a roller coaster with more than one car? For the most part, the same rules
apply. However, new forces now act on each carâforces exerted by the other cars in the
train. The effects of these cars are most pronounced at the top of the first and biggest hill.
As the train disconnects from the lift chain and approaches the descent, it is rolling forward
slowly and the first cars are well over the crest of the hill before they pick up much speed
(Fig. 3.3.9a). Theyâre pulling hard on the cars behind them, and those cars are pulling back,
slowing their descent. By the time the train is moving fast, the first car is well down the hill
and the track is beginning to turn upward. The first carâs riders experience mostly upward
acceleration and downward feeling of acceleration. Thatâs why riders in the first few cars
of a roller coaster donât feel much weightlessness.

In contrast, the last car is moving at high speed early in its descent. It undergoes a
dramatic downward acceleration as itâs yanked over the crest of the first hill by the cars in
front of it (Fig. 3.3.9b). As a result, its riders experience large upward feelings of acceleration and quite extreme weightlessness. In fact, the designers of the track must be careful not
to make the downward acceleration too rapid or the roller coaster will flick the riders in the
last car right out of their seats. Each time the last car crests a hill, it accelerates downhill in
a way that no other car on the coaster can match.
Obviously, it does matter where you sit on a roller coaster. The first seat offers the
most exciting view, but it provides less than spectacular weightless feelings. The last car
almost always offers the best weightless feelings. Probably the dullest seat in the roller
coaster is the second; it offers a relatively tame ride and an unchanging view of the people
in the front seat.
Check Your Understanding #4: Taking to the Air
Your racing car travels over a bump in the track and suddenly becomes airborne. What keeps you in
the air? Has gravity disappeared?

(b)

Answer: Gravity is still present, but your inertia prevents you from following a rapid downturn in the
surface you are traveling along.
Why: If the road you are traveling along suddenly turns downward, you must accelerate downward to
stay in contact with its surface. The steeper and more abrupt the descent, the more downward acceleration you need. The only downward force you experience is your weight, which can cause a downward acceleration of no more than 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2). If the surface drops out from under you faster
than that, you will become airborne. You will then be falling freely and accelerating downward as fast
as gravity will permit. Eventually, you will fall to the surface. In many sports, including skiing, motorcycle racing, and skateboarding, a person traveling along an uneven surface becomes airborne after
passing over a bump.

Epilogue for Chapter 3
In this chapter we have looked at the physical concepts involved in four types of simple
machines. In Spring Scales, we explored the relationship between the force acting on a
spring and its distortion, and we examined how this distortion can be used to measure an
objectâs weight. In Ball Sports: Bouncing, we examined the process of storing and releasing kinetic energy during a collision. As we saw, both the ball and the object it hits contribute to the bounce.
In Carousels and Roller Coasters, we explored both the sensations we feel as we accelerate and why those sensations occur. We saw that circular motion involves a centrally
directed acceleration that gives rise to an outwardly directed feeling of acceleration.

Explanation: Swinging Water Overhead
As you swing the bucket over your head, you are pulling downward on it and causing it
to accelerate downward very rapidly. The water remains in the inverted bucket because
the bucket is accelerating downward faster than gravity alone can accelerate the water.
As the water tries to fall, the bucket overtakes the falling water. As a result, the water is
pressed into the bottom of the bucket. The same effect occurs when you throw a book
toward the floor by pushing it downward rapidly with your open palm. As the book tries
to fall, your palm overtakes it, and it remains pressed into your palm because your hand
is accelerating it downward faster than gravity. Finally, if you stop swinging the bucket
too abruptly, the bucketâs contents will not decelerate with it. Instead, they will spill or
smash.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Spring Scales Work: A spring scale measures an objectâs weight by supporting that
object with a spring. When the object is at rest, the springâs upward force exactly balances
the objectâs downward weight; the scale then reports the upward restoring force its spring is
exerting on the object. As Hookeâs law describes, that restoring force is proportional to the
springâs distortion, so the scale can determine it by measuring how far the spring has bent.
This measurement is often done mechanically and is reported using a needle or dial.
How Bouncing Balls Work: A ball behaves like a spherical or oblong spring. It stores elastic
potential energy as it distorts away from its equilibrium shape and releases some of that
energy as it returns to normal. When a ball strikes a surface, some kinetic energy is removed
from the ball and the surface, and is either stored within those objects as elastic potential
energy or lost as thermal energy. As the objects rebound, some of the stored energy becomes
kinetic energy again. The kinetic energy returnedâthe rebound energyâis always less than
the kinetic energy initially removed from the objectsâthe collision energy. The missing energy has been converted into thermal energy.
How Carousels and Roller Coasters Work: A carousel uses centripetal acceleration to give
each rider an outward feeling of acceleration. Combined with weight, this gravity-like sensation gives the rider an apparent weight that points downward and outward.
A roller coaster also uses rapid acceleration to create unusual apparent weights for its
riders. Each time the coaster accelerates on a hill or turn, the rider experiences a feeling of
acceleration in the direction opposite the acceleration. This feeling of acceleration, combined with the riderâs weight, creates an apparent weight that varies dramatically in amount
and direction throughout the ride. Itâs this fluctuating apparent weight, particularly its near
approaches to zero, that make riding a roller coaster so exciting.

the simple principles that we have already encountered. In this chapter, we take a look at two
more fascinating machines and see what makes them tick. As we do, weâll find ourselves
revisiting familiar issues and exploring a few new ones all the way to the frontiers of science and

Among the physical issues that we discuss in this chapter
are the reaction effects that push rockets forward. These
reaction effects appear in an interesting way in a simple
experiment that involves two different-size balls: a basketball and a tennis ball.
If you canât find a basketball and a tennis ball, any
two lively balls of very different masses will do. Drop the
balls separately and see how high they bounce. Youâll
immediately notice that an individual ball canât bounce
higher than the point from which you dropped it. Such a
rebound would give it more energy than it had originally.
In fact, some of the ballâs energy will be lost to thermal
energy, so it will not even reach its original height.

But what will happen when you stack the smaller
ball on top of the larger ball and drop the two balls
together? Think about the sequence of events that will
occur, and then give it a try. Make sure that the small ball
remains directly above the large ball as the two balls fall
to the floor.
Why does the smaller ball rebound as it does?
How does your choice of balls influence this effect? If
you put the smaller ball on the bottom, will that change
the outcome? What about dropping the pair of balls
from a different height? Try the same experiment with
balls of various sizes to gather more insight into what
is happening.

motion and clever design can make an apparently unstable vehicle stable enough to ride easily, even without your hands on the
handlebars. In Rockets and Space Travel, we look at the principle of action and reaction, and see how this basic idea makes it
possible for spacecraft to leave Earthâs surface and even travel
toward the stars. For a more complete preview of this chapter,

A bicycle is a wonderfully energy-efficient, human-powered vehicle. Its wheels allow its rider to coast forward easily on level surfaces and accelerate effortlessly down hills. Compare the easy
motion of a bicycle to that of walking, which requires effort every
step of the way. Bicycles are very simple machines, and most of
their moving parts are quite visible: the pedals, sprockets, brakes,
and steering mechanisms, to name a few. Their simplicity and
visibility make bicycles relatively easy to fix, even for a novice.

Questions to Think About: Why is a two-wheeled bicycle preferable to the apparently more stable three-wheeled tricycle?
Why do you lean a bicycle in the direction that you are turning? How is it possible to ride a bicycle without hands on the
handlebar? How does pedaling a bicycle make it move forward? Why does a bicycle have such a complicated drive system between its pedals and its rear wheel?
Experiments to Do: If you know how to ride a bicycle, pay
attention to its stability as you ride it. Notice how you lean
the bicycle in the direction that you are turning and how the
bicycle naturally steers into that turn as you begin to lean.
This automatic steering is part of the bicycleâs self-stabilizing
behavior. As you ride, observe how fast the pedals are turning and how hard you must push on the pedals to keep them
turning at that rate. Go up and down some hills in various
gears, and see how each gear choice affects the pedaling
rate and the forces you must exert on the pedals. Why do you
choose a certain gear for a certain situation? What pedaling
rate do you find most comfortable? What pedaling force feels
best?

Tricycles and Static Stability
Bicycles have a stability problem. With only two wheels to support them, stationary bicycles tip over easily. Why then do we use two-wheeled bicycles for transportation?
We can begin to answer that question by looking at static stability, an objectâs stability at rest. To have static stability, an object needs a stable equilibriumâa concept we first
encountered in Section 3.1. Equilibrium means zero net force or torque, but near a stable
equilibrium an object experiences restoring influencesâforces and/or torquesâthat push
it back toward that equilibrium. Aided by such influences, a statically stable object returns
to its stable equilibrium after being displaced slightly.
A marble in a bowl exhibits static translational stabilityâwhen displaced from its
equilibrium position at the bottom of the bowl, it experiences restoring forces that act to
return it to the bottom of the bowl. In contrast, a stool exhibits static rotational stabilityâ
when displaced from its upright equilibrium orientation it experiences restoring torques

that act to return it to upright. The fact that bicycles donât exhibit static translation stability
is a good thing; a bicyclist doesnât want to stay near one place. But bicycles donât exhibit
static rotational stability either. If you want a pedal-powered vehicle that has statically
rotational stability, try a tricycle (Fig. 4.1.1).
An upright tricycle has static rotational stability because it experiences restoring torques
following a tip (Fig. 4.1.2a). Rather than look for those torques directly, however, letâs take
a much more general approach. Physicists are trained to look for the big-picture concepts
hiding behind seemingly unrelated examples, and sometimes I just have to do it.
Recall that an object accelerates in whichever direction reduces its total potential
energy as quickly as possible. In this case, the tricycle undergoes angular acceleration in
whichever rotational direction reduces its total potential energy as quickly as possible.
Since small tips always raise the tricycleâs center of gravity and thus increase its gravitational potential energy, the tipped tricycle can reduce its total potential energy by rotating
back to upright. The upright tricycle is thus in a stable rotational equilibriumâit will
return spontaneously to that upright equilibrium after being tipped slightly. No wonder
children love tricycles!
This relationship between static stability and total potential energy is universal. There
is no need to look directly for the restoring influences, which may be complicated anyway.
If an objectâs total potential energy rises whenever itâs displaced, itâs in a stable equilibrium
and will tend to return there following the displacement. That useful rule applies not only
to static rotational stability and tricycles but also to static translational stability and everything from canoes to bridge spans to decorative mobiles. If you want an object to be stable
at rest, ensure that any small displacement increases its total potential energy.

STABLE EQUILIBRIUM AND POTENTIAL ENERGY
An object is in a stable equilibrium when any small displacement increases its total
potential energy.

That general observation underlies a simple rule of thumb: an object resting on a surface is in a stable rotational equilibrium if a vertical line passing through its center of
gravity also passes through the interior of its base of supportâthe polygon defined by its
contact points with the ground. This rule follows from geometry: if a vertical line through
the objectâs center of gravity passes within its base of support, then tipping it always raises
its center of gravity and increases its gravitational potential energy. Assuming that no other
potential energies are significant, the tipped object will undergo angular acceleration back
toward its original orientation, making that orientation a stable rotational equilibrium. For
example, a tricycle is in a stable rotational equilibrium when its center of gravity is above
the interior of its triangular base of support (Fig. 4.1.3).
Geometry also sets the limits of the objectâs static rotational stability. If the vertical
line passing through its center of gravity also passes through the edge of its base of support, there are three possibilities. If its center of gravity is below the edge, the object is in
a stable rotational equilibrium. If its center of gravity is exactly on the edge, the object is
in a neutral equilibriumâit remains in rotational equilibrium even when you tip it about
that edge.
If the objectâs center of gravity is above the edge, however, it is in an unstable equilibriumâthat is, when displaced slightly in certain directions, the object will experience
anti-restoring torques that cause angular acceleration away from equilibrium. Tipping the
object in those directions lowers its center of gravity and decreases its gravitational potential energy, so it undergoes angular acceleration away from equilibrium and tips over. If the
rider of a tricycle leans out so far that their combined center of gravity is located above the
edge of the triangular base of support, theyâll be in an unstable equilibrium and in danger
of tipping over.
Unlike a tricycle, a bicycle has no stable equilibrium (Fig. 4.1.2b). Its base of support
is a line defined by its two wheels and a line has only an edge, no interior. Although the
rider of a bicycle can achieve rotational equilibrium by locating their combined center of
gravity above that edge, that equilibrium is unstable and the slightest displacement to the
side will tip them over.

UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM AND POTENTIAL ENERGY
An objectâs equilibrium is unstable when a small displacement can decrease its total
potential energy.

Check Your Understanding #1: Keeping Coffee in Its Place
Some travel mugs taper outward at the bottom so that they have very wide bases. Why does
this shape make such a mug particularly stable and keep it from flipping over during the morning
commute?
Answer: The mugâs wide base ensures that its total potential energy will continue to increase as it
tips, even if that tip becomes quite severe, so it will naturally return to its stable equilibrium.
Why: A mug with a narrow base is stable, but only if it never tips very far. As soon as its center of
gravity moves beyond its original base of support, over it will go. However, a mug with a wide base
has a broad base of support and will recover even from severe tips.

Fig. 4.1.4 (a) A tricycle
that is heading straight
is stable because any tip

the tricycle accelerates

large leftward force on
the wheels. This frictional
force produces a torque
about the tricycle and
riderâs combined center of
mass and can cause the
tricycle to tip over.

Static rotational stability matters most to people who have difficulty balancing. Thatâs why
children learn to ride tricycles first (Fig. 4.1.4a). But when a tricycle is moving, static rotational stability doesnât guarantee safety. If a child rolls down a steep hill and then makes a
sudden sharp turn, he or she will probably flip over. What has gone wrong?
A moving tricycle stays upright only if the girl riding it avoids sudden accelerations,
such as a left turn at high speed. To make such a turn, she steers the tricycleâs wheels so that
friction with the pavement pushes the tricycle to the left (Fig. 4.1.4b). Frictional forces on
the wheel accelerate the tricycle leftward, redirecting its speed so that it turns. Of course,
the girl needs to turn, too, so the tricycle pushes her along with it. As long as the turn is
slow, a gentle push is all thatâs required and the tricycle and girl turn together safely.
If the turn is too abrupt, however, the girl doesnât complete the turn along with the tricycle. Instead, her body goes straight as the tricycle drives out from under her. Crash. As you
can see, a tricycle has good static stability but poor dynamic stability, stability in motion.
The tricycle flips because it canât handle the enormous torque that friction exerts on it
during a sharp turn. Because the horizontal frictional force that turns the tricycle is exerted
well below the tricycle and riderâs combined center of mass (Fig. 4.1.4b), it produces a
torque about that center of mass. If this torque is small, the tricycleâs static rotational stability will provide enough restoring torque in the opposite direction to prevent any angular
acceleration. If the turn is too sharp, the huge frictional torque will overwhelm the limited
restoring torque and the tricycle and rider will flip over. During high-speed turns, the tricycle is dynamically unstable.
Since the goal of a wheeled vehicle is to go somewhere, dynamic rotational stability is
ultimately more important than static rotational stability. And while a bicycle lacks static
stability, a moving bicycle is remarkably stable. Its dynamic stability is so good that itâs
almost hard to tip over and can even be ridden without any hands on the handlebars. This
feat is a popular daredevil stunt among children who havenât yet realized how easy it is.
As British physicist David Jones discovered, the bicycleâs incredible dynamic stability
results from its tendency to steer automatically in whatever direction itâs leaning. For example, if the bicycle begins leaning to the left, the front wheel will automatically steer toward
the left so as to return the bicycle to an upright position. Although a stationary bicycle falls
over when itâs displaced from its unstable equilibrium, a forward-moving bicycle naturally
drives under the combined center of mass and returns to that unstable equilibrium.
There are two physical mechanisms acting together to produce this automatic steering
effect: one involving rotation and one involving potential energy. The first is based on the
wheels alone: they behave as gyroscopes. Because each wheel is spinning, it has angular
momentum and tends to continue spinning at a constant angular speed about a fixed axis in
space. Since a wheelâs angular momentum can be changed only by a torque, it naturally
tends to keep its upright orientation.
But angular momentum alone doesnât prevent the bicycle from tipping over, any more
than it prevents a tricycle from doing so. Instead, it prompts the bicycle to steer automatically by way of gyroscopic precession, the pivoting of a gyroscopeâs rotational axis caused
by a torque exerted perpendicular to its angular momentum. When a bicycle is upright, the
pavementâs upward support force points toward the front wheelâs center of mass and produces no torque on that wheel. But when the bicycle leans to the left, the pavementâs
upward support force no longer points at the wheelâs center of mass and it therefore produces a torque on the wheel. That torque is perpendicular to the wheelâs angular momentum, so the wheel precesses; its axis of rotation pivots toward the left and thereby steers the
bicycle to safety!
Assisting gyroscopic precession in this automatic steering process is a second effect
due to potential energy. Because of the shape and angle of the fork supporting its front
wheel, a leaning bicycle can lower its center of gravity and reduce its total potential energy
by steering its front wheel in the direction that the bicycle is leaning. When the bicycle

Bicycles

leans to the left, its front wheel steers toward the left to reduce the bicycleâs total potential
energy as quickly as possible. Once again the bicycle automatically steers in the direction
that itâs leaning and avoids falling over. These self-correcting effects explain why a riderless bicycle stays up so long when you roll it forward or down a hill.
There is little a bicycle designer can do to change the gyroscopic effect, but the potential energy effect depends on fork shape and angle. To be stable, the front wheel must touch
the ground behind the steering axis (Fig. 4.1.5). If the fork is flawed, so that the wheel
touches the ground ahead of the steering axis, the bicycle will steer the wrong way when it
leans and be virtually unridable.
The front fork of a typical adultâs bicycle arcs forward so that the wheel touches the
ground just behind the steering axis. This situation leaves the bicycle dynamically stable enough to ride yet highly maneuverable. In contrast, the front fork of a typical
childâs bicycle is relatively straight so that the wheel touches the ground far behind the
steering axis. The childâs bicycle is therefore more dynamically stable than the adultâs
bicycle but also less easy to turn. That trade-off between dynamic stability and maneuverability is universal, appearing not only in pedal-powered vehicles but in cars, boats,
and aircraft as well.

Check Your Understanding #2: Like a Rolling Coin
Standing a coin on edge is difficult, but a rolling coin stays upright easily. What effect is stabilizing
the moving coin?
Answer: The effect is gyroscopic precession.

(a)

Why: On its edge, the coin has little or no static stability and tips over easily. But when itâs rolling
forward quickly, the same gyroscopic precession effect that causes a bicycle to steer under its center
of gravity also dynamically stabilizes the coinâs otherwise unstable equilibrium.

Leaning While Turning
Why does a bicycle rider lean during a turn? The answer is that leaning can balance out the
torque that friction exerts on him during the turn, the same frictional torque that flipped our
unfortunate tricycle rider. With the proper lean, the bicyclist can safely complete even the
sharpest turn.
As he rides along, the bicyclist tries to keep himself and the bicycle in rotational equilibrium. Since they experience a frictional torque about their combined center of mass each
time they turn, the bicyclist balances that torque by leaning them toward the inside of the
turn. The pavementâs upward support force then produces a torque on them about their
center of mass that opposes the frictional torque. When those two torques sum to zero, the
bicyclist and bicycle are safely in rotational equilibrium.
These two opposing torques are both produced by pavement forces on the wheels, and
their sum is the overall torque that the overall pavement force on the wheels produces. That
overall torque drops to zero when the overall pavement force points directly toward the
combined center of mass. As we saw in Section 2.1, a force exerted directly toward a pivot
produces zero torque about that pivot. To stay in rotational equilibrium as he rides, the
bicyclist always places the combined center of mass directly in line with the pavementâs
overall force on the wheels.
For example, when the bicycle is heading straight, the rider can obtain zero net torque
by keeping the bicycle upright. The pavement pushes the wheels straight upward, directly
toward the combined center of mass (Fig. 4.1.6a). But when the bicycle is turning left, the
rider must lean to the left to stay in rotational equilibrium. During the leftward turn,
the pavement pushes the wheels upward and leftward (Fig. 4.1.6b). Leaning leftward the
proper amount ensures that the pavement force points toward the combined center of mass
and produces zero torque (Fig. 4.1.7).

Fig. 4.1.7 As they round
a turn during a race,
these cyclists lean toward
the inside of the turn.
This leaning prevents the
pavement from producing
torques on them and
tipping them over.

After a while, leaning the bike while turning becomes so automatic, so habitual, that
you donât even think about it. You simply canât ride a bicycle or motorcycle without leaning
as you turn. Even if you turn one of these vehicles so sharply that it skids, leaning can still
keep it safely in rotational equilibrium.
All this discussion of leaning during turns begs the question: How do you make the
bicycle lean prior to a turn? Actually, you cause that lean unconsciously by steering the
bicycle briefly in the wrong directionâthe direction opposite the turn itself! The bicycle
then drives out from under you, and the two of you begin to lean in the desired manner. You
then steer in the correct direction and remain in rotational equilibrium throughout the turn.
When youâre ready to stop turning, you steer extra hard briefly in the direction of the turn.
The bicycle then drives under you, and the two of you return to upright. The turn is over.
Since only a statically unstable vehicle can lean, a statically stable one must rely on
restoring torques to keep it near its rotational equilibrium. As we saw with tricycles, restoring torques are limited, and a vehicle can tip out of its rotational equilibrium during rapid
accelerations. A car, truck, or SUV will flip if it turns too sharply, and some are particularly
prone to such catastrophes. The higher a vehicleâs center of mass and the narrower its base
of support, the more limited its restoring torques and the more easily it flips during turns.
SUVs are surprisingly vulnerable to such rollover accidents, and small trucks that have
been boosted up to resemble tractor-trailer cabs are truly hazardous. Even some ordinary
cars have been found unsafe in this regard.
Check Your Understanding #3: Cutting Corners
Why does a skier lean in the direction of a turn during a downhill run?
Answer: She leans into the turn to make sure that the force on her skis is directed toward her center
of mass.
Why: In many sports and situations a person must lean in the direction of a turn. Since a turn always
involves horizontal acceleration and horizontal force, the person must shift her center of mass toward
the inside of the turn. When she leans just the right amount, the net force on her feet points directly
toward her center of mass and exerts no torque on her about her center of mass. She remains in
rotational equilibrium and doesnât tip over.

Pedaling Bicycles
So far, we have only discussed stability. Once weâve settled on a bicycle as the most likely
configuration for a useful person-powered vehicle, we need to figure out how to person
power it. The rider could push his feet on the ground, but that would be pretty inconvenient
and even dangerous at high speeds. Instead, we use foot pedals to produce a torque on one
of the wheels. But which wheel, and how do we produce that torque?
The original answer was to power the front wheel, using cranks attached directly to its
axle. A crank is simply a lever that projects from the axle and produces a torque on that axle
as you push its free end around in a circle. Each bicycle crank has a pedal installed on its
free end so that you can use your foot to push on it. With its axle suspended in bearings, the
front wheel turns as you pedal it. Friction between the turning wheel and the ground then
pushes the bicycle forward.
This pedaling method is still used in childrenâs tricycles, but it has three drawbacks.
First, pedaling the front wheel interferes with its other responsibility: steering. Second, you
canât take a break from pedaling; if the vehicle is moving, so are the pedals. Third, you can
produce more than enough torque on the front wheel, but you often have trouble moving
your legs quickly enough to keep up with the pedals. When you ride fast on level ground,
you find yourself pedaling furiously and feeling very little resistance from the pedals.
The frantic pedaling problem goes to the heart of all pedal-powered vehicles, vehicles
that draw power from you, the rider. You provide that power by doing a certain amount of

work on the pedals each second. Since work is equal to force times distance, you can do the
same work on the pedals each secondâthat is, you can provide the same power to the
vehicleâby pushing the pedals forward hard as they turn slowly or by pushing the pedals
forward gently as they turn quickly. However, for reasons having to do with physiology
more than physics, your legs are best at providing power when you are pushing the pedals
forward medium hard as they turn medium fast.
Unfortunately, the pedals of an ordinary tricycle turn too quickly and too easily to
make good use of your pedaling power. When the tricycle is moving fast on level ground,
you can barely keep up with its pedals, let alone do work on them. The only time a tricycle
makes good use of your capacity to supply power is when itâs going uphill at moderate
speed; only then do the pedals turn medium fast and require that you push them forward
medium hard.
An early solution to the frantic pedaling problem was to use a gigantic front wheel. In
such a configuration, one turn of the wheel would take you a considerable distance, so you
no longer had to pedal furiously to go fast on a level road. At last you could reach your
peak performance on level ground, pushing the pedals forward medium hard as they
turned medium fast. The pennyfarthing of the mid-nineteenth century was this sort of
bicycle (Fig. 4.1.8). But pedaling still interfered with steering and you couldnât stop pedaling while the bicycle was moving. Furthermore, this bicycle had a new problemâyou
couldnât push the pedals forward hard enough to keep its front wheel turning steadily on
uphill stretches.
These problems were solved by removing the cranks from the front wheelâs axle and
using an indirect drive scheme to convey power to the rear wheel (Fig. 4.1.9). Employing
toothed sprockets and a chain loop, that indirect drive allowed the pedals and the wheels
to turn at different rates. This change lets you use mechanical advantage to choose how
you supply power to the bicycle: whether you exert large forces on slowly moving pedals
or small forces on rapidly moving pedals or, ideally, medium forces on medium-fastmoving pedals. Whether youâre zooming along a level road or grinding slowly up a steep
hill, you can always find a drive setting, or gear, that lets you comfortably supply your
maximum power.
Finally, the nonstop pedaling problem was solved by incorporating a one-way drive or
freewheel in the hub of the rear wheel. This freewheel (Fig. 4.1.10) allows the rear wheel
to turn freely in one direction so that you can stop pedaling as you coast forward. A modern
bicycle with these improvements appears in Fig. 4.1.11.

Check Your Understanding #4: Bigger Isnât Always Better
Why is it so difficult to climb a hill on a pennyfarthing?
Answer: Each turn of the huge wheel takes you a long distance up the hill and requires lots of work.
To do this much work in a single turn of the pedals, you must push on the pedals very hard.
Why: As you pedal a bicycle, you are doing work on the pedals; you push the pedals as they move in
the direction of that push. If too much work is required, as is the case when youâre going uphill on a
pennyfarthing, the force required becomes unbearable.

Rockets and Space Travel
Despite the complexity of modern spacecraft, the rocket is
one of the simplest of all machines. Itâs based on the principle that every action has a reaction. A rocket is propelled
forward by pushing material out of its tail. As simple as
rockets are, however, people have been developing better
rockets for over 700 years. Theyâre used for such pursuits
as space exploration, weaponry, rescue operations, and
amusement.

Rocket Propulsion
Among a rocketâs most impressive features are its ability to propel itself forward even in
the complete isolation of space and its capacity to reach astonishing speeds using that propulsion. It somehow manages to push itself forward without any outside help and to use
that forward push to accelerate seemingly without limits.
Of course, a rocket canât really push itself forward, any more than you can lift yourself up by your boots, and it canât accelerate forever. In reality, it obtains a forward
force, a thrust force, by pushing against its own limited store of fuel, and when that fuel
runs out, it stops accelerating. To understand how a rocket obtains thrust from its fuel
supply, letâs look at how Newtonâs third law, the one describing action and reaction,
applies to rockets.
Imagine that youâre standing in the middle of a frozen pond with zero velocity and no
momentum. Itâs a warm day and the wet ice is remarkably slippery. Try as you may, you
canât seem to get moving at all. How can you get off the ice?
Because of your inertia, the only way you can start moving is if something pushes on
you. Sure, you could order a pizza and then push against the delivery truck when it arrives.
Instead you remove a shoe and throw it as hard as you can toward the east side of the pond
(Fig. 4.2.1). As you throw the shoe, you exert a force on it with your hand. The shoe accelerates and heads off across the ice.
What happens to you? You head off toward the west side of the pond! Youâre moving
because when you pushed the shoe toward the east side of the pond, it pushed you equally
hard toward the west side of the pond. In the process, you transferred momentum to the
shoe and it transferred momentum in the opposite direction to you. Momentum isnât being
created or destroyed, itâs only being redistributed. Even after you let go of the shoe, your
combined momentum remains at zero. The shoe has as much momentum in one direction
as you have in the other.
Of course, you are much more massive than the shoe, so you end up traveling slower
than it does. Momentum is equal to mass times velocity, so the more massive the object, the
less velocity it needs for the same amount of momentum. Still, youâve achieved what you
set out to doâyouâre sliding slowly toward the west side of the pond.
Your final speed is limited because you managed to transfer only a small amount of
momentum to the shoe and thus received only a small amount of opposite momentum in
return. If youâd been able to throw the shoe faster or if youâd thrown a whole display case
of shoes, youâd have transferred more momentum and would be going faster.
Instead of throwing shoes, youâd have done better to throw very fast-moving gas
molecules. Even at room temperature, the molecules in air are traveling about 1800 km/h
(1100 mph). When gas molecules are heated to roughly 2800 ÂşC (5000 ÂşF), as they are in
a liquid-fuel rocket engine, they move about three times that fast. If you throw something
in one direction at that kind of speed, you receive quite a lot of momentum in the other
direction.
Thatâs what a conventional rocket engine does. It uses a chemical reaction to create
very hot exhaust gas from fuels contained entirely within the rocket itself. What started as
chemical potential energy in those fuels becomes thermal energy during the reaction and
then mostly directed kinetic energy as the hot gas rushes out of the rocket engine in a plume
of incandescent exhaust.
The rocket engine exerts a tremendous backward force on the gas, accelerating that gas
to exhaust velocities measured in kilometers per second or miles per second. The gas
pushes forward equally hard on the rocket engine. Propelled by such rocket engines, spacecraft can reach astonishing heights and speeds (Fig. 4.2.2).
Achieving those amazing exhaust velocities requires carefully designed nozzles. If
youâve ever watched the launch of a large rocket, youâve probably noticed the bell-shaped
nozzles through which the exhaust flows (Fig. 4.2.3). Each nozzle allows the rocket to

engineer Carl Gustaf de
Lavalâs (1845â1913)

the modern development
of rockets by several
decades. He invented this

steam turbines more
efficient and is credited
with laying the foundation
for all future turbine

obtain as much forward momentum as possible from its exhaust by directing that exhaust
backward and accelerating it to the greatest possible speed. As weâll see in Chapter 6, nozzles allow gases to convert their various internal energies into kinetic energy and are ideally
suited for directing and accelerating gases. In the case of rocket exhaust, the most effective
nozzle shape is a converging-diverging one, called a de Laval nozzle after its Swedish
inventor, Carl Gustaf de Laval. 1
To understand fully why this complicated nozzle structure works so well for rocket
engines, weâd need to examine the physics of flowing gases up to and beyond the speed of
sound. Weâll encounter some of these issues later in this book, but for now a brief summary
will have to suffice.
Inside the rocket and before the de Laval nozzle, the hot exhaust gas is tightly packed
and its pressure is enormous. Like the gas in a spray bottle, this exhaust gas accelerates
rapidly through the nozzle toward the lower pressure environment outside. The narrowing
throat of that nozzle aids its acceleration, up to a point. When the gas reaches the narrowest
part of the nozzle, itâs traveling at the speed of sound and its characteristics begin to change
dramatically. To coax the supersonic exhaust gas to accelerate still further, the nozzle stops
narrowing and begins to widen. The tightly packed exhaust gas expands in volume as it
flows through that widening bell and thereby prepares to enter the more open environment
outside the nozzle.
Just how wide the diverging end of the de Laval nozzle must be to obtain the maximum
thrust from its exhaust gas depends on the nozzleâs surroundings. Near sea level, the
exhaust gas flows into ordinary air outside the nozzle and a relatively narrow de Laval
nozzle works best. At high altitude or in space, the exhaust gas enters thinner air or nothing
at all, so a wider de Laval nozzle is more ideal. Rockets typically make a compromise in
their nozzle shapes so as to operate reasonably well in all environments.
By the time the gas reaches the end of the de Laval nozzle, it has converted most of its
original energy into kinetic energy, with its velocity directed away from the nozzle. In fact,
because the gas actually continues to burn even as it flows through the nozzle, its kinetic
energy and speed keep rising until they reach fantastic levels. With the help of the de Laval
nozzle, exhaust gas leaves the rocketâs engine at an exhaust velocity, or backward-directed
flow speed, of between 10,000 and 16,000 km/h (6000 and 10,000 mph).
As it creates this plume of exhaust, the rocket pushes the gas backward and gives it
backward momentum. The gas completes the momentum transfer by pushing the rocket
forward. The very act of ejecting the exhaust is all thatâs required to obtain forward thrust;

Rockets and Space Travel

the rocket doesnât need anything external to push and will operate perfectly well in empty
space (see 2 ). When it pushes hard enough on its exhaust, the rocket not only can support
its own weight, it can even accelerate upward.
COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Action and Reaction in Rockets
Misconception: A rocket needs some external object to react against to push itself forward.
Resolution: While rocket propulsion does involve a pair of equal but opposite forces, action and
reaction, the rocket is pushing its exhaust backward (action) and the exhaust is pushing the
rocket forward (reaction). What this exhaust plume hits, if anything, makes no difference to the
propulsion effect.

Check Your Understanding #1: A Rocket with a Head Start
When a missile is launched from beneath the wing of a fighter aircraft, what does it push against to
accelerate forward?
Answer: It pushes against its own exhaust, as do all rockets.
Why: While it may appear that the plume of exhaust beneath a ground-launched rocket is what lifts
that rocket upward, the ground itself doesnât contribute to the thrust. The very act of pushing the gas
out the nozzle propels the rocket forward.

The Ultimate Speed of a Spacecraft
At rest on the launchpad, a rocket consists principally of a spacecraft and a supply of fuel.
Once the rocketâs engine begins to fire, exhaust from the burned fuel accelerates backward
and the spacecraft accelerates forward. The fuel is gradually consumed until eventually it
runs out and the spacecraft coasts along on its own. Although weight and air resistance
influence this story, letâs neglect both for now to see what determines the spacecraftâs
eventual speed.
Remarkably, the ultimate speed of the spacecraft is not limited to the rocketâs exhaust
speed. As long as the rocket keeps pushing exhaust backward, it will continue to accelerate
forward. For the spacecraft to reach speeds in excess of its exhaust speed, however, the
rocket must push the majority of its initial mass backward as exhaust. After all, the momentum of the exhaustâs larger mass heading backward at the exhaust speed cancels the
momentum of the spacecraftâs smaller mass heading forward at more than the exhaust
speed. For a rocket that is 90% fuel and 10% spacecraft at launch, we might reasonably
expect the spacecraft to end up traveling forward at nine times the exhaust speed.
Unfortunately, that simple analysis overestimates the spacecraftâs speed. Because the
rocket accelerates forward while its engine is firing, only the first portion of its exhaust travels backward at the full exhaust speed (Fig. 4.2.2.). As the rocket picks up speed in the forward direction, its exhaust moves less rapidly in the backward direction. When the rocketâs
forward speed exceeds its exhaust speed, the exhaust actually ends up moving forward!
Despite this problem, a spacecraft can still travel forward faster than the exhaust speed;
it just needs more fuel. If we neglect air resistance and weight, the spacecraftâs final speed
is given by the rocket equation:
spacecraft speed = exhaust speed Âˇ loge (

massspacecraft + massfuel
massspacecraft

).

(4.2.1)

For a rocket that is 90% fuel and 10% spacecraft at launch, its spacecraft can reach
2.3 times the speed of its exhaust gas. If it is more than 90% fuel, it can go even faster.

the development of
liquid-fuel rockets. The

CHAPT ER 4 Mechanical Objects

Thereâs a problem, however, with trying to burn up and eject a huge fraction of the
rocketâs original mass as exhaust. Itâs difficult to construct a rocket that is 99.99% fuel
and 0.01% spacecraft. Instead, a space-bound rocket is typically a stack of several separate rocket stages, each stage much smaller than the previous stage. Once the first
stage has used up all its fuel, the whole stage is discarded and the next rocket stage
begins to operate. In this manner, the rocket behaves as though itâs ejecting almost all
its mass as rocket exhaust. With the help of several stages and lots of fuel, rockets can
travel substantially faster than their exhaust velocities and reach Earth orbit or the solar
system beyond.

Check Your Understanding #2: Not Everything Is Disposable
The space shuttle didnât have the staged look of expendable rockets. How did it manage to eject most
of its launch mass as exhaust?
Answer: It was actually staged subtly. Its two solid-fuel boosters were effectively the first stage, the
external liquid-fuel tank was the second stage, and the orbiter itself was the third stage.
Why: Although the space shuttle was not stacked one stage on the next like a Saturn or Delta rocket,
it didnât travel from ground to space as a single object. It discarded empty fuel containers as it
accelerated upward. First to go were the two boosters, followed by the external fuel tank. The final
mass of the orbiter itself was much less than what left the launchpad.

Orbiting Earth

3 English physicist Henry
Cavendish (1731â1810)
proved that terrestrial
objects do exert gravitational forces on one
another. His experiment,
performed in 1798,
measured the tiny forces
that two metal spheres
exert on one another,
using a very sensitive
torsion balance. Comparing the forces between the
two spheres with those
between Earth and those
same spheres (their
weights), Cavendish
was able to deduce the
mass of Earth. In effect,
Cavendishâs tabletop
experiment allowed him
to weigh the Earth.

If the spacecraft were heading straight up when it ran out of fuel, it would either fall back
to the ground or leave Earth forever (more on that later). But if it were heading primarily
horizontally when its engine turned off, it might find itself circling Earth endlessly. With no
atmosphere to affect it, the spacecraft follows a path determined only by inertia and gravity,
and since the spacecraftâs weight causes it to accelerate toward the center of Earth, its
trajectory can bend into a huge elliptical loop around Earth.
The spacecraft is following an orbit around Earth. An orbit is the path an object
takes as it falls freely around a celestial object. Although the spacecraft accelerates
directly toward Earthâs center at every moment, its huge horizontal speed prevents it
from actually hitting Earthâs surface. Instead, Earthâs curved surface bends away from
it so rapidly that the fast-moving spacecraft falls around Earth rather than into it
(Fig. 4.2.4). To orbit Earth just above the atmosphere, a spacecraft must travel at the
enormous horizontal speed of 7.9 km/s (about 17,800 mph) and will circle Earth once
every 84 minutes.
The farther the spacecraftâs orbit is from Earthâs surface, however, the longer its
orbital period, the time it takes to complete one orbit. That longer period is due in part to
the increased distance the spacecraft must travel when completing a larger orbit, but itâs
also due to an important characteristic of gravity: Earthâs gravity becomes weaker as
distance from Earthâs center of mass increases.
Section 1.2 observed that an objectâs weight is equal to its mass times 9.8 N/kg, the
acceleration due to gravity. That relationship (Eq. 1.2.1), however, is only an approximation, valid for an object near Earthâs surface. As the objectâs altitude increases, both the
acceleration due to gravity and the objectâs weight decreaseâyou truly weigh less on a
mountaintop than you do in the valley nearby. Moreover, Eq. 1.2.1 completely ignores the
fact that gravity attracts every object in the universe toward every other object in the
universe (see 3 ).
To determine orbits around Earth and other celestial bodies, scientists and engineers
use a more general formula that relates the gravitational forces between two objects to their
masses and the distance separating them. These forces are equal to the gravitational constant times the product of the two masses, divided by the square of the distance separating

and in common language:
The pull of gravity is strongest between massive objects but diminishes rapidly
as distance increases.
Note that the force on mass1 is directed toward mass2 and the force on mass2 is directed
toward mass1. Those two forces are equal in magnitude but oppositely directed. The
gravitational constant is a fundamental constant of nature, with a measured value of
6.6720 Ă 10â11 N Âˇ m2/kg2.

THE LAW OF UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION
Every object in the universe attracts every other object in the universe with a force
equal to the gravitational constant times the product of the two masses, divided by the
square of the distance separating the two objects.

CHAPT ER 4 Mechanical Objects

This relationship describes any gravitational attraction, whether itâs between two
planets or between Earth and you. The effective location of an objectâs mass is its center
of mass, so the distance used in Eq. 4.2.2 is the distance separating the two centers of
mass. For a spacecraft orbiting Earth just above its atmosphere, that distance is roughly
Earthâs radius of 6378 km (3964 miles). For a spacecraft far above the atmosphere, however, the distance is larger and the force of gravity is weaker; that spacecraft experiences
a smaller acceleration due to gravity. To give it the additional time it needs for its path to
bend around in a circle, the high-altitude spacecraft must travel more slowly than the
low-altitude spacecraft. This reduced speed explains the long orbital periods of highaltitude spacecraft.
At 35,900 km (22,300 miles) above Earthâs surface, the orbital period reaches
24 hours. A satellite traveling eastward in such an orbit turns with the Earth and is said to
be geosynchronous. If a geosynchronous satellite orbits Earth around the equator, itâs also
geostationaryâit always remains over the same spot on Earthâs equator. Such a fixed
orientation is useful for communications and weather satellites.
Not all orbits are circular (Fig. 4.2.5). The orbits of some spacecraft are elliptical, so
their altitudes vary up and down once per orbit. At apogee, its greatest distance from Earthâs
center, a spacecraft travels relatively slowly because it has converted some of its kinetic
energy into gravitational potential energy. At perigee, its smallest distance from Earthâs
center, the spacecraft travels relatively rapidly because it has converted some of its gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy. Of course, the perigee should not bring the
spacecraft into Earthâs atmosphere or it will crash.
The greater a spacecraftâs total energy, the farther its orbit extends from Earth. If the
spacecraft has too much total energy, Earthâs gravity will be unable to bend its path into a
closed loop and the spacecraft will coast off into interplanetary space. The spacecraftâs path
near Earth is then a parabola or hyperbola. The spacecraft follows this parabolic or hyperbolic path only once and then drifts away from Earth forever.
A spacecraft usually enters parabolic or hyperbolic orbit by firing its rocket engine. It
starts in an elliptical orbit around Earth and uses its rocket engine to increase its kinetic
energy. The spacecraft then arcs away from Earth, and its kinetic energy gradually transforms into gravitational potential energy. But Earthâs gravity becomes weaker with distance,
and the spacecraftâs gravitational potential energy slowly approaches a maximum value
even as its distance from Earth becomes infinite. If the spacecraft has enough kinetic energy
to reach this maximum gravitational potential energy, it will be able to escape completely

so a spacecraft following
one of those orbits does

from Earthâs gravity. If its kinetic energy approaches zero as it escapes, itâs in a parabolic
orbit. If it retains excess kinetic energy after the escape, itâs in a hyperbolic orbit.
The speed that a spacecraft needs to escape from Earthâs gravity is called the escape
velocity. This escape velocity depends on the spacecraftâs altitude and is about 11.2 km/s
(25,000 mph) near Earthâs surface. A spacecraft traveling at more than the escape velocity
follows a hyperbolic orbital path and heads off toward the other planets or beyond.
COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Astronauts and âWeightlessnessâ
Misconception: An astronaut orbiting Earth is too far from Earth to experience gravity and is truly
weightless.
Resolution: The astronaut is still so near Earthâs surface that he experiences almost his full Earth
weight. He feels weightless only because he is in free fall.

The moon orbits Earth every 27.3 days, at a distance of 384,400 km from Earthâs center of mass.
For the moon to orbit in less time, how would its distance from Earth have to change?
Answer: The distance between Earth and moon would have to decrease.
Why: The moon behaves just like a spacecraft orbiting Earth at a distance of 384,400 km. Such a
spacecraft would also have an orbital period of 27.3 days. To reduce this orbital period, the moon
would have to move closer to Earth so that Earthâs gravity could bend its path more rapidly.

Check Your Figures #1: Attractive Cars
How much gravitational force does a 1000-kg automobile exert on an identical car located
10 m away?
Answer: It exerts about 6.73 Ă 10â7 N.
Why: We use Eq. 4.2.2 to obtain the force:
force =

(10 m) 2

= 6.6720 Ă 10â7 N.
This force is roughly equal to the weight of a grain of sand. No wonder itâs hard to feel gravity from
anything but the entire Earth.

Orbiting the Sun: Keplerâs Laws
Once it escapes from Earthâs gravity and again turns off its rocket engine, the spacecraft
behaves like a tiny planet and orbits the sun. If you watch it patiently as it travels and compare its orbital motion with the motions of the planets themselves, you may begin to notice
three universal features of all these solar orbits. First recognized by German astronomer
Johannes Kepler (1571â1630) through his careful analysis of the extensive observational
data collected by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, those three orbital behaviors are known
as Keplerâs laws.
Keplerâs first law is already rather familiar to us from our examination of Earth orbits.
This law describes the shape of the spacecraftâs looping orbit around the sun; itâs an ellipse,
with the sun at one focus of that ellipse (Fig. 4.2.6). An ellipse isnât an arbitrary oval; itâs a
planar curve with two foci and a rule stating that the sums of the distances between each
point on the curve and the two foci are the same. In this case, one focus is occupied by the
sun, and the other focus is usually empty. If you add the distance from the spacecraft to the

sun and the distance from the spacecraft to the empty focus, that sum will remain constant
as the spacecraft orbits the sun. A circular orbit around the sun is a particularly simple
elliptical one; its two foci coincide and the sun occupies them both.
Kepler recognized that every object orbiting the sun follows such an elliptical path. The
planets move along nearly circular ellipses, while the comets travel in highly elongated
ones. Our spacecraftâs orbit may be circular or elongated, depending on its position and
velocity at the time its engine stopped firing. To reach another planet, the spacecraftâs solar
orbit and that of its destination planet must overlap and the two objects must reach that overlapping point at the same time. Traveling from planet to planet is clearly a tricky business.
Newton later recognized that these elliptical orbits are a direct consequence of the law
of universal gravitation (Eq. 4.2.2) and its inverse square relationship between force and
distance (force â 1/distance2). Any other relationship between force and distance would
yield curving paths that donât close on themselves at all, let alone form ellipses. As you
follow the spacecraftâs elliptical orbit around the sun, you are witnessing an elegant exhibition of the law of universal gravitation.

KEPLERâS FIRST LAW: ORBITS
All planets move in elliptical orbits, with the sun at one focus of the ellipse.

Keplerâs second law describes the area swept out by a line stretching from the sun to
the spacecraft: that line sweeps out equal areas in equal times (Fig. 4.2.7). Regardless of
how circular or elongated the spacecraftâs orbit is, or where the spacecraft is along that
orbit, the area marked off each second by that moving line is always the same.

This observation demonstrates another physical lawâconservation of angular momentum. Since the sunâs gravity pulls the spacecraft directly toward the sun, it exerts no torque
on the spacecraft and the spacecraftâs angular momentum about the sun is constant.
Remarkably, the rate at which this line sweeps out area is proportional to the spacecraftâs
angular momentum, so the steadiness of that sweep demonstrates the constancy of the
spacecraftâs angular momentum about the sun.

KEPLERâS SECOND LAW: AREAS
A line stretching from the sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

Keplerâs third law describes the spacecraftâs orbital period around the sun: the
square of its orbital period is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the sun,
that is, the average of its maximal and minimal distances from the sun (Fig. 4.2.8). This
relationship can be derived from the law of universal gravitation (Eq. 4.2.2), the equations describing centripetal acceleration (for example, Eq. 3.3.1), and Newtonâs second
law (Eq. 1.1.2).

KEPLERâS THIRD LAW: PERIODS
The square of a planetâs orbital period is proportional to the cube of that planetâs mean
distance from the sun.

Your spacecraft has just left Earth behind and is now orbiting the sun independently. Its elongated
orbit has the same mean distance from the sun as Earthâs orbit, but its maximal distance from the
sun is twice its minimal distance. Compare its speeds at the maximal and minimal distances from
the sun. Will it ever meet up with Earth again?
Answer: It is moving half as fast at its maximal distance from the sun as at its minimal distance, and
it will meet Earth again in exactly 1 year.
Why: In accordance with Keplerâs first law, the spacecraft is traveling in an elliptical orbit. Since
Keplerâs second law requires it to sweep out area at a constant rate, the spacecraft must move half
as fast when it is twice as far from the sun. Finally, because the spacecraftâs mean distance from the
sun is the same as that of Earth, the two have the same orbital periods. Theyâll both complete their
orbits in one year and meet up at that time.

Travel to the Stars: Special Relativity
4 In 1905, while Albert
Einstein (German-born
Swiss then American
physicist, 1879â1955)
was working as a patent
examiner in Bern, he
published four revolutionary papers in three
different areas of physics.
For the 26-year-old
doctoral student from
Germany, it was quite a
banner year. Though
Einstein is often portrayed
as an elderly, wild-haired
gentleman, his most
important contributions to
science were made when
he was a vibrant young
man who had married his
first wife only just two
years earlier.

Despite formidable challenges, it may one day be possible for human-crewed spacecraft to
venture away from the solar system and travel to the stars. The distances involved are so
vast that the only way to cover them in an astronautâs lifetime would be to move at fantastic
speeds, speeds comparable to that of light itself.
Should spacecraft one day be able to attain such enormous speeds, theyâll find that the
basic laws of motion, the Galilean and Newtonian laws that we have been learning up to
this point, are incomplete. Although extremely accurate at ordinary speeds, those laws
falter near the speed of light (exactly 299,792,458 m/s). They turn out to be low-speed
approximations for the more accurate laws of motion developed by Einstein in 1905 ( 4 ).
Built on the observation that light always travels at the same speed, regardless of an observerâs inertial frame of reference, these relativistic laws of motion are accurate at any speed.
They are part of Einsteinâs special theory of relativity, the conceptual framework that
describes space, time, and motion in the absence of gravity.
We saw in Section 1.1 that observers in different inertial frames of reference can disagree on an objectâs position and velocity. Special relativity recognizes that those observers can also disagree on the distance and time separating two events. More broadly, two
inertial observers who are in relative motion perceive space and time somewhat differently. If theyâre moving at ordinary speeds, that difference in perceptions is negligible and
the Newtonian laws of motion are nearly perfect. But if theyâre moving relative to one
another at a substantial fraction of the speed of light, then they perceive space and time
quite differently. In that case, the Newtonian approximations fail and the full laws of relativity are required.
Special relativity has many consequences for high-speed space travel, but weâll concentrate on how relativity alters two familiar conserved quantities: momentum and energy.
At low speeds, our spacecraftâs momentum takes its usual Newtonian value: mass times
velocity (Eq. 2.3.1). But with increasing speed, a new relativistic factor enters the picture:
(1 â speed2/light speed2)â1/2. Relativistic momentum is equal to the objectâs mass times
its velocity times that factor. This relationship can be written as a word equation:
relativistic momentum =

mass Âˇ velocity
â1 â speed2/light speed2

,

(4.2.3)

in symbols:
p=

mÂˇv
â1 â v2/c2

,

and in common language:
For a spacecraft to reach the speed of light, its momentum would have
to be infinite.
At ordinary speeds, the relativistic factor is so nearly equal to 1 that this relativistic
relationship is beautifully approximated by the Newtonian one. However, as the spacecraftâs speed begins to approach that of light itself, the relativistic factor spoils the simple
proportionality between momentum and velocity. Momentum then increases more rapidly
than velocity. One result of this change is that it becomes impossible to reach the speed of
light, let alone exceed it. Even if the spacecraftâs thrust increases its forward momentum at
a steady rate, its speed will increase less and less quickly. It will approachâbut never
reachâthe speed of light.
A similar change happens to the spacecraftâs energy as it approaches the speed of light.
At low speeds, our isolated spacecraftâs kinetic energy takes its usual Newtonian value:

Rockets and Space Travel

half its mass times the square of its speed (Eq. 2.2.1). At high speeds, however, we must
begin using relativistic energy. Relativistic energy is equal to the objectâs mass times the
square of the speed of light times the relativistic factor. This relationship can be written as
a word equation:
relativistic energy =

mass Âˇ light speed2
â1 â velocity2/light speed2

,

(4.2.4)

in symbols:
E=

m Âˇ c2
â1 â v2/c2

,

and in common language:
A spacecraft starts with a rest energy and its energy grows toward infinity as its
speed approaches the speed of light.
At ordinary speeds, the spacecraftâs relativistic energy can be approximated as:
relativistic energy â mass Âˇ light speed2 + 12 Âˇ mass Âˇ speed2.
The usual Newtonian kinetic energy appears at the right in this approximation, but to its left
is a new energy that weâve never seen before. Called the rest energy, itâs present even when
the spacecraft is motionless. Because the rest energy is constant, it doesnât affect low-speed
motion and was overlooked in the Newtonian laws. However, this energy associated with
mass itself (stated symbolically as E = mc2) does have consequences and is surely the most
famous feature of the special theory of relativity.
The relativistic version of energy has two implications for our spacecraft. First, the
spacecraftâs energy increases so quickly as it nears the speed of light that it can never reach
that speed. Second, the spacecraftâs initial store of energy before launch is associated with
its initial mass. That mass and energy are so closely related is something to which weâll
return in Chapter 15.
Check Your Understanding #5: Stellar Tugboats
A stellar tugboat is pulling forward on a spacecraft that is already traveling close to the speed of light.
Although the tugboat is steadily increasing the spacecraftâs forward momentum, the spacecraft is
speeding up less and less quickly. Why?
Answer: Although the spacecraftâs forward momentum increases steadily, in accordance with the relativistic relationship between momentum and velocity, the spacecraftâs velocity increases ever more slowly.
Why: At ordinary speeds, a steady transfer of momentum to an object will yield a steady increase in
its speed. Near the speed of light, however, the objectâs increase in speed no longer keeps pace with
its increase in momentum.

Check Your Figures #2: The Real Speed Limit
A spacecraft passes your planetary base going half the speed of light. Using special equipment, you
transfer exactly enough momentum to that spacecraft to double its forward momentum. How fast is
it going now?
Answer: It is going â4/7 times the speed of light.
Why: When the spacecraft is traveling at Â˝ the speed of light, Eq. 4.2.3 gives its forward momentum
as â1/3 times its mass times the speed of light. Doubling that momentum and solving Eq. 4.2.3 for
the velocity yields â4/7 times the speed of light.

Check Your Figures #3: It Packs a Wallop
The speed of a 1-kg minispacecraft is â3/4 times the speed of light. What is its relativistic energy
and what fraction of that energy is rest energy?
Answer: Its total energy is 1.8 Ă 1017 J, of which half is rest energy.
Why: For an object traveling at â3/4 times the speed of light, Eq. 4.2.4 gives a total energy of 2
times its mass times the square of the speed of light. For a 1-kg object, that energy is 1.8 Ă 1017 J.
Its rest energy is simply its mass times the square of the speed of light, or 9.0 Ă 1016 J. Both values
of energy are astonishingly large.

Visiting the Stars: General Relativity
In its travels near stars and other massive celestial objects, our spacecraft is likely to
encounter another surprise: the Newtonian view of gravity is also an approximation! Near
extremely dense, massive objects, gravity is no longer accurately described by Newtonâs
law of universal gravitation. Instead, understanding gravity requires a new conceptual
framework that Einstein first presented in 1916, the general theory of relativity.
This new framework is based on the observation that you canât distinguish between
downward gravity and upward acceleration. As we found in Section 3.3, they feel exactly
the same. For example, if you feel heavy as you stand inside a closed spacecraft, you canât
be sure whether youâre experiencing a weight due to downward gravity or a feeling of
acceleration due to upward acceleration. In fact, the spacecraftâs scientific instruments
canât help you because they canât distinguish the effects of gravity from those of-acceleration either. No matter how hard you try, you canât tell the difference.
At the heart of this problem is the concept of mass. Up to this point, we have seen mass
play two apparently different roles that we can refer to as gravitational mass and inertial
mass. When youâre experiencing a weight, your gravitational mass is acting together with
gravity to make you feel heavy. When youâre experiencing a feeling of acceleration, your
inertial mass is acting together with acceleration to make you feel heavy. However, in spite
of their different roles, these two masses seem to be related. Without exception, an object
that has a large inertial mass and is therefore difficult to shake back and forth also has a large
gravitational mass and is therefore hard to support against gravity. In fact, the two masses
seem to be the same. That observation led Einstein to propose the principle of equivalence,
that these two masses, gravitational and inertial, are truly identical and therefore that no
experiment you perform inside your spacecraft can distinguish between free fall and the
absence of gravity. The general theory of relativity is based on this principle of equivalence.
As long as your spacecraft stays in regions of weak gravity, Newtonâs law of universal
gravitation will adequately describe its motion. At the extremes of gravity, however, the
general theory of relativity is necessary. That theory describes a universe in which massive
objects distort the structure of nearby space and time, and in which extreme masses produce extreme distortions. One of the most startling predictions of this theory is the existence of objects so radical in their gravitational warping of nearby space and time that they
are black holes, spherical or nearly spherical surfaces from which not even light can
escape. A number of black holes have been discovered, including an enormous one at the
center of our galaxy. You might want to avoid them.
Check Your Understanding #6: Rip-van-Twinkle
You awaken aboard your small spacecraft only to discover that you have been asleep for almost 20
years and the crew has vanished. The windows are closed, and you have no idea where your spacecraft is located or what it is doing. You realize that you feel pulled toward the floor of the spacecraft.
Are you experiencing weight or a feeling of acceleration?
Answer: Trick question! You canât possibly determine the answer!
Why: The central principle of general relativity is that no experiment you make inside your spacecraft
can distinguish between the consequences of gravity and the consequences of acceleration. Youâre
simply going to have to look out the window to figure it out.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations

Epilogue for Chapter 4
This chapter has discussed the physical concepts behind two types of machines. In Bicycles, we
investigated the concept of dynamic stability, where an object that falls over when stationary
becomes remarkably stable in motion. We also saw how the need for mechanical advantage
between the pedals and the wheels led to the development of the modern multispeed bicycle.
In Rockets and Space Travel, we studied the ways in which reaction forces propel
rockets forward. We found that a rocketâs ultimate speed is not limited by its exhaust velocity, allowing it to lift itself into orbit around Earth. We also learned that gravity weakens as
the distance between two gravitating objects increases, making it possible for a spaceship
to break free from Earthâs gravity and begin orbiting the sun. Finally, we took a brief look
at the exotic physics a spacecraft would encounter if it approached the speed of light or
passed through the extreme gravity near some celestial objects.

Explanation: High-Flying Balls
The top ball doesnât bounce off the ground; it bounces off the bottom ball. The top ball
actually completes its bounce as the bottom ball is heading upward. After colliding, the two
balls push off one another in just the same way that a rocket pushes off its exhaust. The
balls exchange momentum and energy as they push against one another, and the small top
ballâwhich has less mass and accelerates much more easily than the bottom ballâends up
with a large upward momentum and more than its fair share of energy. It flies upward as
though it were hit by a massive upward-moving bat. In fact, it has been hit by a massive
upward-moving ball, and it rebounds at high speed.
If the small ballâs mass were really negligible compared to that of the large ball and the
balls bounced without wasting any energy, then the small ball would rebound from the big ball
traveling three times as fast as when it arrived. Its kinetic energy would be nine times as great
as before, and it would rebound to nine times its original height. Of course, real balls arenât
perfect, so the tennis ball wonât bounce quite so high. Still, the effect is pretty impressive.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Bicycles Work: While a stationary bicycle tips over easily, a moving bicycle is remarkably stable. It remains upright with the help of two stabilizing effects of motion: one due to
gyroscopic precession and the other due to the shape and angle of the front fork. These
effects work together to steer the bicycle in the direction that itâs leaning. Whenever it tips,
it automatically drives under its center of gravity and returns to upright. Leaning is also an
essential part of turns. By leaning his body and/or the bicycle properly during a turn, the
bicyclist ensures that there is no overall torque on the bicycle and that it doesnât tip over.
The rider powers the bicycle by pushing its pedals around in a circle. Since the rider can
provide the most pedaling power when the pedals are turning at a moderate rate and he is
pushing on them with moderate forces, a modern multispeed bicycle allows him to adjust the
relative rotation rates of the pedals and the wheels. By choosing the right gear, the bicycle
allows him to provide his peak power comfortably.
How Rockets Work: A rocket obtains its thrust by ejecting gas from an engine in its tail. The
rocket pushes on the gas, and the gas pushes back. This gas usually comes from burning
chemical fuels contained entirely inside the rocket itself and is released from the rocketâs
engine through a nozzle. A carefully designed nozzle permits the rocket to make efficient use
of the energy stored in the fuel by ensuring that gas leaves the rocket at the maximum possible speed. The rocketâs thrust is used to lift the rocket against the force of gravity and to
accelerate it upward. Once in space, with its engine inactive, the rocket will orbit Earth or
the sun, or it may travel off into interstellar space.

Fluids

o far all the everyday objects weâve examined have been solids. However, since gases and
liquids are also important parts of the world around usâas the air we breathe, the water we
swim in, and even the blood we pump through our veinsâwe now turn to objects that, unlike
solids, donât have well-defined shapes. These objects are called fluids, and the study of fluid behavior and motion is a broad field, extending across the sciences and engineering. Fluid dynamics,
often called hydrodynamics, is as important to an oil-well engineer as to an animal physiologist or
a stellar astrophysicist. The tools used to analyze fluids are somewhat more complicated than for
solids because fluids themselves are more complicatedâitâs hard to exert a force directly on them,
and even if we could, they usually donât move as a single rigid object. In this chapter, weâll look at
some of the concepts and tools needed to understand their complex behaviors.

object thatâs more dense than the surrounding fluid sinks,
while one thatâs less dense than that fluid floats.
To see the importance of density in determining
whether an object sinks or floats, you can construct a simple toy called a Cartesian diver. This once-popular parlor
gadget consists of a small air-filled vial floating in a
sealed container of water. Normally, the air bubble inside

Courtesy Lou Bloomfield

One of these concepts is buoyancy: an object immersed in
a fluid experiences an upward force from that fluid. This
buoyant force is what lifts a helium balloon into the sky
and suspends a boat on the surface of water. How the object
responds to buoyancy depends on the relative densities of
the object and the fluid surrounding it, where density is the
ratio of mass to volume. As weâll see in this chapter, an

119

120

CHAPT ER 5 Fluids

the vial keeps it floating at the surface of the water, but
whenever you squeeze the container, the vial sinks.
To make a Cartesian diver, youâll need only a plastic
soda bottle and a small vial thatâs open at one end. The
vial can be made of almost anythingâplastic, metal, or
glassâas long as itâs dense enough to sink in water. Fill
the plastic soda bottle with water and float the vial in it
upside down; air trapped inside the vial should keep the
vial afloat. Now slowly reduce the size of the air bubble
inside the vial until the vial barely floats. You can make
this adjustment by tipping the vial to let some of its air
escape or by removing it from the bottle and pouring
water into it. Once you have the vial floating only a few
millimeters out of the water at the top of the soda bottle,
cap the bottle and prepare to test your diver.

Before you squeeze the soda bottle, think about how
squeezing it will affect the air bubble. Now squeeze the
bottle gently and watch the air bubble. How does the bubbleâs size depend on how hard you squeeze the bottle?
Why should the two be related? Squeeze the bottle hard
enough that the vial sinks. Why is there a relationship
between the size of the air bubble and the diverâs height in
the water?
As you release the pressure on the bottle, the diver
will float back up to the surface. Why does the sunken
diver suddenly become buoyant again? By carefully
squeezing the bottle, you can even make the diver hover
in the middle of the bottle. Try making the diver hover
while your eyes are closed. Why is hovering so difficult to
sustain? Why must you watch the diver to make it hover?

Chapter Itinerary
Weâll return to the diver at the end of the chapter. First, we
examine two things from the world around us: (1) balloons and
(2) water distribution. In Balloons, we explore how the concepts
of pressure and buoyancy help explain how Earthâs atmosphere
keeps hot-air and helium balloons from falling to the ground. In
Water Distribution, we see both how pressure propels water
through plumbing and the ways in which water can contain
energy. For a more complete preview of this chapter, jump
ahead to the Chapter Summary and Important Laws and
Equations at the end of the chapter.

SECTION 5.1

The issues weâll be looking at crop up frequently in our
everyday experiences. Pressure plays an important role in aerosol cans, steam engines, firecrackers, and even the weather;
buoyancy supports ships on water and keeps oil above vinegar
in a bottle of salad dressing. Just as important, these concepts
lay the groundwork for Chapter 6, where weâll examine objects
in which motion affects the behavior of fluids.

Balloons
Because gravity gives every object near Earthâs surface a weight
proportional to its mass, objects fall when you drop them. Why
then does a helium-filled balloonâwhich, after all, is just
another object with a mass and a weightâsail upward into the
sky when you let go of it? Does the balloon have a negative
mass and a negative weight, or are we forgetting something?
Weâre forgetting airâspecifically, the layer of air that sits
atop Earthâs surface and is held in place by gravity. Since this
air is difficult to see and moves out of our way so easily, we
often forget that itâs there. But air sometimes makes itself
noticeable. When you ride a bicycle, you feel its forces; when
you blow up a beach ball, you see that it takes up space. And
when you release a helium balloon, air lifts the balloon upward.

Questions to Think About: Since most objects fall to the
ground through the atmosphere, why doesnât the atmosphere
itself fall downward? Why is the air âthinnerâ in the mountains
than at sea level? If you suck all the air out of a plastic bag,
what squeezes the bag into a thin sheet? Why does blowing air
into the bag make it inflate? What happens to the bagâs total
mass when you fill it with air? with hot air? with helium? If you
took a sturdy helium balloon to the moon, where there is no
air, and then released it, which way would it move?

Balloons

Experiments to Do: Pull on the string of a helium balloon to
get a feel for how it behaves. If it pulls upward on your fingers,
does that mean its weight (and mass) is negative? How would
an object with a negative mass respond to a force? Shake the
balloon and convince yourself that the balloonâs mass is positive. Do you think there are any objects with negative masses?
Since the balloonâs mass and weight are both positive,
gravity must be pulling the balloon downward. But how can the
stationary balloon pull upward on your finger? What other

121

forces might be pushing the balloon upward? You can enhance
these upward forces by partially submerging the balloon in a
container of water. Where else do similar upward forces appear
in everyday life?
Take the helium balloon for a ride in a car. Which way
does the balloon move when you start suddenly? when you stop
suddenly? Again, it seems as though the balloonâs mass is negative. What is pushing on the balloon to make it move in this
counterintuitive way?

Air and Air Pressure
Hot-air and helium balloons donât really defy gravity. In fact, theyâre not even close to
weightless. But even though these balloons may weigh hundreds of pounds, something
supports their weight and holds them aloftâthe surrounding air. To understand balloons,
we must start by understanding air.
Like the objects weâve already studied, air has weight and mass. If you donât believe
me, compare two identical scuba tanks, one freshly filled with air and the other empty. If
you weigh each tank carefully, youâll find that the full tank is heavier than the empty tankâ
an indication that air has weight. If you shake each tank, youâll find that the full tank is
harder to accelerate than the empty tankâan indication that air has mass. So air really is
like any other object âŚ or almost.
What makes air different from our previous objects is that air has no fixed shape or
size. You can mold 1 kg of air into any form you like, and it can occupy a wide range of
volumes. Air is compressible, that is, you can squeeze a certain mass of it into almost any
space. For example, 1 kg of air could fill a single scuba tank or a whole basketball arena.
This flexibility of size and shape originates in the microscopic nature of air. Air is a
gas, a substance consisting of tiny, individual particles that travel around independently.
These individual particles are atoms and molecules. An atom is the smallest portion of an
element that retains all the chemical characteristics of that element; a molecule, an assembly of two or more atoms, is the smallest portion of a chemical compound that retains all
the characteristics of that compound. A moleculeâs atoms are held together by chemical
bonds, linkages formed by electromagnetic forces between the atoms.
Air particles are extremely small, less than 1 millionth of a millimeter in diameter.
Most are nitrogen and oxygen molecules, but others include carbon dioxide, water, methane, and hydrogen molecules, and also argon, neon, helium, krypton, and xenon atoms.
Those particular atoms, which donât make strong chemical bonds and rarely form molecules, are called inert gases because of their chemical inactivity.
Like tiny marbles, these air particles have sizes, masses, and weights. But, while marbles quickly settle to the ground when you spill them from a bag, air particles donât seem
to fall at all. Why donât they pile up on Earthâs surface?
The answer has to do with airâs thermal energy, the portion of airâs internal energy
thatâs associated with temperature. Airâs individual particles have such minuscule masses
that, even at room temperature, they exhibit frenetic thermal motion (Fig. 5.1.1a); thermal
energy keeps them moving, spinning, and ricocheting off one another at bullet-like speeds
of roughly 500 m/s (1100 mph). Their frequent collisions prevent them from making much
progress in any particular direction and, between collisions, they travel in nearly straightline paths because gravity doesnât have time to make them fall very far. This vigorous
thermal motion spreads the air particles apart, so they donât accumulate on the ground. Real
marbles, however, are too massive to exhibit noticeable thermal motion and fall to the
ground in heaps.
Letâs ignore gravity for the moment and consider what happens in a truck tire containing 1 kg of room-temperature air. The air particles whiz around inside the tire, and each

CHAPT ER 5 Fluids

time a particle bounces off a wall of the tire, it exerts a force on that wall. Although the
individual forces are tiny, the number of particles is not, and together they produce a large
average force. The size of this total force depends on the wallâs surface area; the larger its
surface area, the more average force it experiences. To characterize the air, however, we
donât really need to know the wallâs surface area; instead, we can refer to the average force
the air exerts on each unit of surface area, a quantity called pressure:
pressure =

force
.
surface area

Pressure is measured in units of force per area. Since the SI unit of surface area is the
meter2 (abbreviated m2 and often referred to as the square meter), the SI unit of pressure is
the newton per meter2. This unit is also called the pascal (abbreviated Pa), after French
mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal. One pascal is a small pressure; the air around
you has a pressure of about 100,000 Pa (2100 lbf/ft2 or 15 lbf/inch2), so it exerts a force of
about 100,000 N on a 1-m2 surface. Since 100,000 N (22,500 lbf) is about the weight of a
city bus, air pressure can exert enormous forces on large surfaces.
Besides pushing on the walls of the tire, air also pushes on any object immersed in it.
Its particles bounce off the objectâs surfaces, pushing them inward. As long as the object
can withstand these compressive forces, the air wonât greatly affect it since the uniform air
pressure ensures that the forces on all sides of the object cancel one another perfectly. A
sheet of paper, for example, will experience zero net force because the forces exerted on its
two sides will sum to zero.
Air particles also bounce off one another, so that air pressure exerts forces on air, too.
A cube of air inserted into the tire experiences all of the inward forces that a cube of metal
would experience. The air around the cube pushes inward on it, and the cube pushes outward on the air around it. Since the net force on the cube of air is zero, the cube doesnât
accelerate.

Check Your Understanding #1: Getting a Grip on Suction
After you push a suction cup against a smooth wall, the elastic cup bends back and a small, empty
space is created between the cup and the wall. What keeps the suction cup against the wall?
Answer: Air pressure keeps it against the wall.
Why: Because the space between the suction cup and the wall is empty, the pressure there is zero.
Pressure of the surrounding air exerts large inward forces on the outsides of both the cup and the
wall, squeezing them together. As long as there is no air between them to push outward, the cup and
wall remain tightly attached. Once air leaks into the suction cup, itâs easily detached from the wall.

Pressure, Density, and Temperature
Since air pressure is produced by bouncing air particles, it depends on how often, and how
hard, those particles hit a particular region of surface. The more frequent or harder the
impacts, the greater is the air pressure.
To increase the rate at which air particles hit a surface, we can pack them more tightly.
Suppose we use an air pump to add another 1 kg of room-temperature air to the tire. Since that
truck tire is sturdy and stiff, its volume doesnât change significantly as the number of air molecules inside it doubles. However, doubling the number of air particles in the same volume
doubles the rate at which they hit each surface and therefore doubles the pressure (Fig. 5.1.1b).
Airâs pressure is thus proportional to its density, that is, its mass per unit of volume:
density =

mass
.
volume

Balloons

Since the SI unit of volume is the meter3 (abbreviated m3 and often referred to as the cubic
meter), the SI unit of density is the kilogram per meter3 (abbreviated kg/m3). The air
around you has a density of about 1.25 kg/m3 (0.078 lbm/ft3). Water, in contrast, has a
much greater density of about 1000 kg/m3 (62.4 lbm/ft3).
We can also increase the rate at which air particles hit a surface by speeding them up
(Fig. 5.1.1c). The hotter the air, the more thermal energy it contains and the faster its particles move. Thermal energy is a combination of internal kinetic energy in the particlesâ
random thermal motion and internal potential energy stored as part of that random thermal motion. Since air particles are essentially independent, except during collisions, nearly
all of airâs thermal energy is internal kinetic energy.
If we double the internal kinetic energy of the calm air in the tire, we double the average kinetic energy of each particle. Because a particleâs kinetic energy is proportional to
the square of its speed, doubling its kinetic energy increases its speed by a factor of â2.
As a result, each particle hits the surface â2 times as often and exerts â2 times as much
average force when it hits. With each particle exerting â2 ? â2, or two times as much
average force, the pressure doubles. Calm airâs pressure is thus proportional to the average
kinetic energy of its particles. Even when air is moving as wind and has noninternal kinetic
energy in its overall motion, its pressure is proportional to the average internal kinetic
energy of its particles.
Temperature measures this average internal kinetic energy per particle; the hotter the
air, the larger is the average internal kinetic energy per particle and the greater the airâs
pressure. Thatâs why the tireâs air pressure increases on hot days and when it heats up during highway driving.
The most convenient scales for relating airâs temperature to airâs pressure arenât
the common Celsius (Â°C) and Fahrenheit (Â°F) scales; instead, they are special absolute temperature scales, in which the zero of the temperature scale is absolute zero,
the temperature at which an object contains zero thermal energy. At absolute zero
(â273.15 Â°C or â459.67 Â°F), air contains no internal kinetic energy at all and has no
pressure. When you use an absolute temperature scale, airâs pressure is proportional to
its temperature.
The SI scale of absolute temperature is the Kelvin scale (K). The Kelvin scale is
identical to the Celsius scale, except that itâs shifted so that 0 K is equal to â273.15 Â°C.
In addition to associating the zero of temperature with the zero of internal kinetic energy,
the Kelvin scale avoids the need for negative temperatures. Room temperature is about
293 K.
Since air pressure is proportional to both the airâs density and its absolute temperature,
we can express the relationship among these quantities in the following way:
pressure â density Âˇ absolute temperature.

(5.1.1)

This relationship is useful because it allows us to predict what will happen if we change
the temperature or density of a specific gas, such as air. The relationship does have its
limitations; in particular, it doesnât work if we compare the pressures of two different
gases, such as air and helium, which differ in their chemical compositions. To make such
a comparison, weâll need to improve on Eq. 5.1.1. Weâll do that later when we examine
helium balloons.
Even in describing a specific gas, Eq. 5.1.1 has other shortcomings. The main problem
is that real gas particles arenât completely independent of one another. If the temperature
drops too low, the particles begin to stick together to form a liquid and Eq. 5.1.1 becomes
invalid. Despite its limitations, however, this simple relationship between pressure, density,
and temperature will prove useful in understanding how hot-air balloons float. It will help
us understand the basic structure of Earthâs atmosphere, the origins of the upward force that
keeps a hot-air balloon aloft, and the reason why hot air rises.

Check Your Understanding #2: Snacks That Go Pop in the Night
If you remove a partially filled container of food from the refrigerator and allow it to warm to room
temperature, the lid will often bow outward and may even pop off. What has happened?
Answer: The pressure of the air trapped in the container increases as its temperature increases,
causing the lid to bulge outward.
Why: Whenever a trapped quantity of gas changes temperature, it also changes volume or pressure or both. In this case, warming the air trapped in the container causes its pressure to increase.
The unbalanced pressures inside and outside the container cause the lid to bow outward or even
to pop off.

Earthâs Atmosphere
Most of the mass of Earthâs atmosphere is contained in a layer less than 6 km (4 miles)
thick. Since Earth is 12,700 km (7,900 miles) in diameter, this layer is relatively thinâso
thin that, if Earth were the size of a basketball, it would be no thicker than a sheet of paper.
The atmosphere stays on Earthâs surface because of gravity. Every air particle, as
weâve seen, has a weight. Just as a marble thrown upward eventually falls back to the
ground, so the particles of air keep returning toward Earthâs surface. Although the particles
are moving too fast for gravity to affect their motions significantly over the short term,
gravity works slowly to keep them relatively near Earthâs surface. An air particle, like a
rapidly moving marble, may appear to travel in a straight line at first, but it will arc over and
begin to fall downward eventually. Only the lightest and fastest moving particles in the
atmosphereâhydrogen molecules and helium atomsâoccasionally manage to escape
from Earthâs gravity and drift off into interplanetary space.
While gravity pulls the atmosphere downward, air pressure pushes the atmosphere
upward (Fig. 5.1.2a). As the air particles try to fall to Earthâs surface, their density increases
and so does their pressure. Itâs this air pressure that supports the atmosphere and prevents
it from collapsing into a thin pile on the ground.
To understand how gravity and air pressure structure the atmosphere, picture a 1-m2
column of the atmosphere as though it were a tall stack of 1-kg air blocks (Fig. 5.1.2b).
These blocks support one another with air pressure to form a stack of about 10,000 blocks.
The bottom block must support the weight of all the blocks above it and is tightly compressed, with a height of about 0.8 m, a density of about 1.25 kg/m3, and a pressure of about
100,000 Pa. A block farther up in the stack has less weight to support and is less tightly
compressed. The higher in the stack you look, the lower the density of the air and the less
the air pressure.
The atmosphere has essentially the same structure as this stack of blocks. The air near
the ground supports the weight of several kilometers of air above it, giving it a density
of about 1.25 kg/m3 and a pressure of about 100,000 Pa. At higher altitudes, however, the
airâs density and pressure are reduced, since there is less atmosphere overhead and the
air doesnât have to support as much weight. High-altitude air is thus âthinnerâ than lowaltitude air.

Fig. 5.1.2 (a) A model of Earthâs atmosphere, showing that a competition between gravity and thermal energy gives rise to the
structure of Earthâs atmosphere, notably its increasing pressure, density, and temperature with decreasing altitude. (b) The air in a
1-m2 column of atmosphere has a mass of about 10,000 kg. The bottom 1000 kg is the most tightly compressed because it supports
the most weight above it. At higher altitudes, the air is less tightly compressed because it has less weight above it.

Since the atmosphereâs density and pressure increase gradually with distance in the
downward direction, the atmosphere has a downward density gradient and a downward
pressure gradient. As weâll see shortly, that pressure gradient is what allows a balloon to
float. Whatever the altitude, however, the pressure of the surrounding air is always referred
to as atmospheric pressure. The atmosphere also has a downward temperature gradient
that makes ballooning chilly at high altitudes; you might want to bring coffee or hot chocolate. Weâll return to that temperature gradient in Section 7.3.
Check Your Understanding #3: Mountain Travel Is a Pain in the Ears
As you drive up and down in the mountains, you may feel a popping in your ears as air moves to
equalize the pressures inside and outside your eardrum. What causes these pressure changes?
Answer: As you change altitude, the atmospheric pressure changes.
Why: The air inside your ears is trapped, so its temperature, density, and pressure are normally
constant. As your altitude changes, the pressure outside your ear changes and your eardrum experiences a net force. It bows inward or outward, muting the sounds you hear and causing some discomfort. The pressure imbalance is relieved during swallowing, when air can flow into or out of your
middle ear.

The Lifting Force on a Balloon: Buoyancy
So far weâve examined air, air pressure, and the atmosphere. While it may seem that weâve
avoided dealing with balloons, these topics really are involved in keeping hot-air and
helium balloons aloft. As weâve seen, the air in Earthâs atmosphere is a fluid, a shapeless
substance with mass and weight. This air has a pressure and exerts forces on the surfaces it
touches; that pressure is greatest near the ground and decreases with increasing altitude.
Air pressure and its variation with altitude allow air to lift hot-air and helium balloons
through an effect known as buoyancy.
Buoyancy was first described more than 2000 years ago by the Greek mathematician
Archimedes (287â212 bc). Archimedes realized that an object partially or wholly immersed
in a fluid is acted on by an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it

126

CHAPT ER 5 Fluids

displaces. Archimedesâ principle is actually very general and applies to objects floating or
submerged in any fluid, including air, water, or oil. The buoyant force originates in the
forces that a fluid exerts on the surfaces of an object. Weâve seen that such forces can be
quite large but tend to cancel one another. How then can pressure create a nonzero total
force on an object, and why should that force be in the upward direction?

ARCHIMEDESâ PRINCIPLE
An object partially or wholly immersed in a fluid is acted on by an upward buoyant
force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.

Without gravity, the forces would cancel each other perfectly because the pressure of
a stationary fluid would be uniform throughout. But gravity causes a stationary fluidâs pressure to increase with distance in the downward direction; the fluid has a downward pressure
gradient. When nothing is moving, the air pressure beneath an object is always greater than
the air pressure above it. Thus air pushes upward on the objectâs bottom more strongly than
it pushes downward on the objectâs top, and the object consequently experiences an upward
overall force from the airâa buoyant force.
How large is the buoyant force on this object? Itâs equal in magnitude to the weight of
the fluid that the object displaces. To understand this remarkable result, imagine replacing
the object with a similarly shaped portion of the fluid itself (Fig. 5.1.3a). Since the buoyant
force is exerted by the surrounding fluid, not the object, it doesnât depend on the objectâs
composition. A balloon filled with helium will experience the same buoyant force as a
similar balloon filled with water or lead or even air. So replacing the object with a similarly
shaped portion of fluid will leave the buoyant force on it unchanged.
However, a portion of fluid suspended in more of the same fluid doesnât accelerate
anywhere; it just sits there, so the net force on it is clearly zero. It has a downward weight,
but that weight must be canceled by some upward force that can come only from the surrounding fluid. This upward force is the buoyant force, and itâs always equal in magnitude
to the weight of the object-shaped portion of fluid displaced by the object.
This buoyant principle explains why some objects float while others sink. An object
placed in a fluid experiences two forces: its downward weight and an upward buoyant
force. If its weight is more than the buoyant force, it will accelerate downward (Fig. 5.1.3b);
if its weight is less than the buoyant force, it will accelerate upward (Fig. 5.1.3c). If the
two forces are equal, it wonât accelerate at all and will maintain a constant velocity. If the
balloon in this latter case starts motionless, it will remain motionless and will hover at a
constant velocity of zero.

Whether an object will float in a fluid can also be viewed in terms of density. An object
that has an average density greater than that of the surrounding fluid sinks, while one that
has a lesser average density floats. A water-filled balloon, for example, will sink in air
because water and rubber are denser than air. If you double the volume of the balloon, you
double both its weight and the buoyant force on it, so it still sinks. The total volume of an
object is less important than how its density compares to that of the surrounding fluid.
Check Your Understanding #4: Only Eyes above the Surface
Crocodiles sometimes swallow rocks, partly to aid their digestion but also to lower their heights in the
water. To float with only its eyes above the waterâs surface, approximately what average density does
a crocodile need?
Answer: It needs an average density just slightly less than the density of water.
Why: The crocodile should weigh a little less than the water it displaces when fully immersed. That
way, it will experience a net upward force and will rise to the waterâs surface. Once its eyes are above
the surface and not displacing water, the net force on the crocodile will drop to zero and it will hover.
Since the crocodileâs mass is slightly less than an equal volum of water, its average density is slightly
less than that of water.

Check Your Figures #1: Why People Donât Float in Air
If a person displaces 0.08 m3 (2.8 ft3) of air, what is the buoyant force he experiences?
Answer: It is about 1 N (0.22 lbf).
Why: Air exerts a buoyant force on a person equal to the weight of the air he displaces. The density
of air near sea level is about 1.25 kg/m3, so 0.08 m3 of air has a mass of about 0.1 kg (1.25 kg/m3
times 0.08 m3) and a weight of about 1 N. So the upward buoyant force on him is about 1 N. This
buoyant force due to the air is real and reduces the weight you read when you stand on a scale by
about 0.125%.

Hot-Air Balloons
Since air is very light, with a density of only 1.25 kg/m3 (0.078 lbm/ft3), few objects float
in it. One of these rare objects is a balloon with a vacuum inside it. Assuming that the balloon has a very thin outer shell or envelope, it will weigh almost nothing and have an average density near zero. Because its negligible weight is less than the upward buoyant force
it experiences, the empty balloon will float upward nicely.
Unfortunately, this empty balloon wonât last long. Because itâs surrounded by atmosphericpressure air, each square meter of its envelope will experience an inward force of 100,000 N.
With nothing inside the balloon to support its envelope against this crushing force, it will
smash flat. A thick, rigid envelope might be able to withstand the pressure of the surrounding
air, but then the balloonâs average density would be large and it would sink. So an empty
balloon wonât work.
What will work is a balloon filled with something that exerts an outward pressure on
the envelope equal to the inward pressure of the surrounding air. Then each portion of the
envelope will experience zero net force and the balloon will not be crushed. We could fill
the balloon with outside air, but that would make its average density too high. Instead, we
need a gas that has the same pressure as the surrounding air but a lower density.
One gas that has a lower density at atmospheric pressure is hot air. Filling our balloon
with hot air takes fewer particles than filling it with cold air, since each hot-air particle is
moving faster and contributes more to the overall pressure than does a cold-air particle. A
hot-air balloon contains fewer particles, has less mass, and weighs less than it would if it
contained cold air (Fig. 5.1.4). Now we have a practical balloon with an average density
less than that of the surrounding air. The buoyant force it experiences is larger than its
weight, and up it goes.

Cold

Because the air pressure inside a hot-air balloon is the same as the air pressure outside
the balloon, the air has no tendency to move in or out (an issue we will cover in the next
section), and the balloon doesnât need to be sealed (Fig. 5.1.5). A large propane burner,
located beneath the balloonâs open end, heats the air that fills the envelope. The heated air
expands to fill more volume at the same pressure and some of it flows out the balloonâs
open bottom.
The hotter the air in the envelope, the lower its density and the less the balloon
weighs. The balloonâs pilot controls the flame so that the balloonâs weight is very nearly
equal to the buoyant force on the balloon. If the pilot raises the airâs temperature, particles leave the envelope, the balloonâs weight decreases, and the balloon rises. If the pilot
allows the air to cool, particles enter the envelope, the balloonâs weight increases, and the
balloon descends.
Even if the pilot heats the air until it is very hot, the balloon wonât rise upward forever.
As the balloon ascends, the air becomes thinner and the pressure decreases both inside and
outside the envelope. Although the balloonâs weight decreases as the air thins out, the buoyant force on it decreases even more rapidly and it becomes less effective at lifting its cargo.
When the air becomes too thin to lift the balloon any higher, the balloon reaches a flight
ceiling above which it canât rise. For each hot-air temperature, then, there is a cruising
altitude at which the balloon will hover. When the balloon reaches that altitude, itâs in a
stable equilibrium. If the balloon shifts downward for some reason, the net force on it will
be upward; if it shifts upward, the net force on it will be downward.
Because a balloonâs fabric envelope ages quickly at high temperatures, the balloonâs
air mustnât be heated above about 120 Â°C (248 Â°F). Lower air temperatures prolong the life
of the envelope, and a pilot usually tries to reduce the air temperature required by reducing
the weight of the balloonâs cargo. If you want to bring yet another friend on board, you
might have to leave the champagne behind.

Check Your Understanding #5: Ballooning Weather
Can a hot-air balloon lift more on a hot day or a cold day?
Answer: It can lift more on a cold day.
Why: On a cold day, the outside air is relatively dense and the buoyant force on a balloon is larger
than it would be on a hot day. The hot air in the balloon will cool off more quickly on a cold day, but
the balloon will be able to carry a heavier load. Airplanes also fly better on cold days.

Balloons

Helium Balloons
Although the particles in hot and cold air are similar, there are fewer of them in each cubic
meter of hot air than in each cubic meter of cold air. We call the number of particles per unit
of volume the particle density,
particle density =

particles
,
volume

and hot air has a smaller particle density than cold air (Fig. 5.1.4). Because they contain
similar particles, hot air also has a smaller density than cold air and is lifted upward by the
buoyant force.
Thereâs another way to make one gas float in another: use a gas consisting of very light
particles. Helium atoms, for example, are much lighter than air particles. When they have
equal pressures and temperatures, helium gas and air also have equal particle densities.
Since each helium atom weighs 14% as much as the average air particle, 1 m3 of helium
weighs only 14% as much as 1 m3 of air. Thus a helium-filled balloon has only a fraction
of the weight of the air it displaces, and the buoyant force carries it upward easily.
Why should air and helium have the same particle densities whenever their pressures
and temperatures are equal? Because a gas particleâs contribution to the pressure doesnât
depend on its mass (or weight). At a particular temperature, each particle in a gas has the
same average internal kinetic energy in its translational motion, regardless of its mass.
Although a helium atom is much less massive than a typical air particle, the average helium
atom moves much faster and bounces more often. As a result, lighter but faster-moving
helium atoms are just as effective at creating pressure as heavier but slower-moving air
particles.
Thus, if you allow the helium atoms inside a balloon to spread out until the pressures
and temperatures inside and outside the balloon are equal, the particle densities inside and
outside the balloon will also be equal (Fig. 5.1.6). Since the helium atoms inside the
balloon are lighter than the air particles outside it, the balloon weighs less than the air it
displaces, and it will be lifted upward by the buoyant force.

Helium

Fig. 5.1.6 A cube of helium contains the same number of particles as a cube of air at the same
pressure and temperature. Since each helium atom weighs much less than the average air particle,
the helium inside the balloon experiences an upward buoyant force that is greater than its downward
weight.

The pressure of a gas is proportional to the product of its particle density and its
absolute temperature, as the following formula indicates:
pressure â particle density Âˇ absolute temperature.

(5.1.2)

This proportionality holds regardless of the gasâs chemical composition. Our previous
proportionality, Eq. 5.1.1, worked only as long as the gasâs composition didnât change, so
density and particle density remained proportional to one another. Now, however, we have
a relationship with a wider applicability.
Equation 5.1.2, with an associated constant of proportionality, is called the ideal gas
law. This law relates pressure, particle density, and absolute temperature for a gas in which
the particles are perfectly independent. Itâs also fairly accurate for real gases in which the
particles do interact somewhat. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant,
with a measured value of 1.381 Ă 10â23 Pa Âˇ m3/(particle Âˇ K). Using the Boltzmann constant,
the ideal gas law can be written as a word equation:
pressure = Boltzmann constant Âˇ particle density Âˇ absolute temperature, (5.1.3)

THE IDEAL GAS LAW
The pressure of a gas is equal to the Boltzmann constant times the particle density
times the absolute temperature.

Helium isnât the only âlighter-than-airâ gas. Hydrogen gas, which is half as dense as
helium, is also used to make balloons float. However, donât expect hydrogen to lift twice as
much weight as helium. A balloonâs lifting capacity is the difference between the upward
buoyant force it experiences and its downward weight. Although the gas in a hydrogen balloon weighs half that in a similar helium balloon, the balloons experience the same buoyant
force. Thus the hydrogen balloonâs lifting capacity is only slightly more than that of the
helium balloon. Hydrogenâs main advantage is that itâs cheap and plentiful, while helium is
scarce (see 1 ). Hydrogen is also dangerously flammable, so itâs avoided in situations where
safety is important. However, even helium-filled airships can have problems (see 2 ).
Check Your Understanding #6: What Not to Put in a Balloon
A carbon dioxide molecule is heavier than an average air particle. If you pour carbon dioxide gas from
a cup, which way does it flow in air, up or down?
Answer: It flows down.
Why: Carbon dioxide, found in carbonated beverages, dry ice, and fire extinguishers, is heavier than
air because its molecules are heavier than air particles. The carbon dioxide you pour from the cup
has the same pressure and temperature as the air around it and thus the same particle density.
However, each carbon dioxide molecule weighs more, so the carbon dioxide is the denser gas (it has
a higher mass density) and flows down in air. This tendency to flow along the floor makes carbon
dioxide very good at extinguishing low-lying flames by depriving them of oxygen.

When you take an air-filled plastic container out of the refrigerator, it warms from 2 Â°C to 25 Â°C. How
much does the pressure of the air inside it change?
Answer: It increases by 8.4%.
Why: To use Eq. 5.1.3 to determine the pressure change, we need temperatures measured on an
absolute scale, such as the Kelvin scale. Since 0 Â°C is about 273 K, 2 Â°C is about 275 K and 25 Â°C
is about 298 K. We can write Eq. 5.1.3 twice, once for each temperature:
pressure298 K = Boltzmann constant Âˇ particle density Âˇ 298 K,
pressure275 K = Boltzmann constant Âˇ particle density Âˇ 275 K.
The particle density of the air in the container canât change as it warms up because its volume is
fixed. Therefore we can divide the upper equation by the lower one and cancel out the Boltzmann
constant and particle density on the right-hand side, giving:
pressure298 K
298 K
=
pressure275 K
275 K
= 1.084.
The pressure in the container thus increases by a factor of almost 1.084, or about 8.4%. This elevated
pressure will cause the container to emit a pop sound when you open it.

Now that weâve explored the behavior of objects in fluids, letâs
turn to the behavior of fluids in objects. In this section, as we
examine how plumbing distributes water, weâll see that pressure, density, and weight are just as important in plumbing as
they are in ballooning. To keep things simple, weâll focus on
the causes of waterâs motion through plumbing and leave the
many complications of that motion itself for the next chapter.
For the rest of this section, weâll ignore friction-like effects

Experiments to Do: To see the effects of pressure and weight
on water, try these simple experiments with a drinking straw.
First, suck water up the straw from a glass to your mouth. Are
you exerting an attractive force on the water, or is some other
force pushing it upward toward your mouth? With the straw
full of water, seal the top with your finger; keeping the seal
tight, remove the straw from the glass. What happens to the
water inside? What happens to the water when you release the
seal? Now blow into one end of a straw full of water while
sealing the far end with your finger. When you release the seal
on the far end, what happens to the water? What forces are
responsible for this effect?

Water Pressure
Water distribution systems require two things: plumbing and water pressure. Plumbing is
what delivers the water, and water pressure is what starts that water flowing. Water pressure
is important because, like everything else, water has mass and accelerates only when
pushed. If nothing pushed on the water when you opened a faucet, the water simply

wouldnât budge. Since the pushes that send water through pipes come principally from
differences in water pressure, we need to look carefully at how this pressure is created and
controlled.
We begin our study of water distribution by ignoring gravity. As weâve seen with the
atmosphere, gravity creates downward pressure gradients in stationary fluidsâtheir pressures increase with depth and decrease with altitude. These downward pressure gradients
complicate plumbing in hilly cities and skyscrapers. However, if all our plumbing is in a
level regionâfor example, a single-story house in a very flat cityâour job is much simpler.
With no significant changes in height, the pressure gradients due to gravity produce negligible effects. In fact, we can neglect gravity altogether.
In this simplified situation, water accelerates only in response to unbalanced pressures.
Just as unbalanced forces make a solid object accelerate, so too do unbalanced pressures
make a fluid accelerate. If the water pressure inside a pipe is uniform, then each portion of
water feels no net force and doesnât accelerate; it either remains stationary or coasts at
constant velocity (Fig. 5.2.1a). If the pressure is out of balance, however, then each portion
of water experiences a net force and accelerates toward the region of lowest pressure
(Figs. 5.2.1b,c).
This acceleration doesnât mean that the water will instantly begin moving toward the
lowest pressure. Because of its inertia, water changes velocity gradually; it speeds up,
slows down, or turns to the side, depending on where the lowest pressure is located. A
complicated arrangement of high and low pressures can steer water through an intricate
maze of pipes, and that is exactly how water reaches your home from the city pumping
station. Every change in its velocity during its trip through the plumbing is caused by a
pressure imbalance.
You can create a pressure imbalance in water simply by squeezing parts of it. The
pressure in a squeezed portion will rise and it will accelerate toward lower pressures elsewhere. Since this sort of pressure change isnât caused by the waterâs motion, itâs a static
variation in pressure. The waterâs motion can also affect its pressure and such dynamic
variations in pressure can be complicated and fascinating. As weâll see in the next chapter,
they contribute to such diverse effects as the spray of a garden hose nozzle, the lift on an
airplaneâs wing, and the curve of a curve ball.
Check Your Understanding #1: Under Pressure in the Garden
With the water faucet open and the nozzle at the end of your garden hose shut tightly, the hose is full
of high-pressure water. Why doesnât this water accelerate?
Answer: The water pressure (force on a unit of surface area) inside the hose is uniform throughout,
so the water experiences no net force and doesnât accelerate.
Why: In the absence of gravity, fluids accelerate only when they experience pressure imbalances.
Since water throughout the hose is at the same pressure, there is no pressure imbalance and no
acceleration. When you open the nozzle, the pressure at that end of the hose drops and the water
accelerates toward it.

Water Distribution

Creating Water Pressure with Water Pumps
To start water flowing through the plumbing in a level house or city, you need a water
pump, a device that uses mechanical work to deliver pressurized water through a pipe. At
its most basic level, a water pump squeezes a portion of water to raise its local pressure so
that it accelerates toward regions of lower pressure. The pump continues to squeeze that
water as it flows out through the plumbing.
To understand how a pump works, picture a sealed plastic soda bottle full of water.
When you donât squeeze the bottle, the pressure inside it is atmospheric and uniform
(remember that weâre neglecting gravity). But when you squeeze the sides of the bottle and
push inward on the water, the water responds by pushing outward on youâNewtonâs third
lawâand it does this by increasing its pressure. The harder you push, the harder the water
pushes back and the greater its pressure becomes.
Water, like all liquids, is incompressible; that is, it experiences almost no change in
volume as its pressure increases. Although the bottle wonât get smaller as you squeeze, the
water pressure inside it can increase substantially. It doesnât take much force, exerted with
your thumb on a small area of the bottle, to increase the pressure in the bottle from atmospheric to twice that value or more.
The pressure increases uniformly throughout the water bottle, an observation known
as Pascalâs principle: a change in the pressure of an enclosed incompressible fluid is conveyed undiminished to every part of the fluid and to the surfaces of its container. This uniform pressure rise leads to a large upward force on the bottleâs cap. If the cap were wider
and had more surface area, the upward force on it might be large enough to blow it off the
bottle. That effect is the basis for hydraulic systems and lifts, where pressure produced in
an incompressible fluid by a small force exerted on a small area of the fluidâs container
results in a large force exerted on a large area of the fluidâs container (Fig. 5.2.2). It also
explains why plastic drinking bottles usually have small caps and why wide-mouth plastic
containers are better suited for candies, cookies, and nuts.

PASCALâS PRINCIPLE
A change in the pressure of an enclosed incompressible fluid is conveyed undiminished to every part of the fluid and to the surfaces of its container.

Itâs time to remove the cap from the water bottle. Now when you squeeze the bottle
and increase the local water pressure, the water can move. As its pressure increases inside
the bottle, the water begins to accelerate toward the lower pressure outside the bottleâs open
top and the result is a fountain. You are pumping water!
You are also doing work; as the water flows out of the bottle, your hands move inward.
Since you are pushing inward on the water and the water is moving inward, you are doing
work on the water. Pumps do work when they deliver pressurized water, and pressurized
water carries with it the energy associated with that work.
Although a water bottle can act as a pump briefly, it soon runs out of water. A more
practical pump appears in Fig. 5.2.3. In this pump, a piston slides back and forth in the open
end of a hollow cylinder, making a watertight seal. Pushing inward on that piston squeezes
any water in the cylinder and increases the local water pressure. Water begins to flow.
In contrast to our simple bottle, this pumpâs cylinder is easy to refill. The cylinder
actually has two openings, each with a valve that permits water to flow in only one direction. Water can leave the cylinder only through the top opening and can enter only through
the bottom opening. As you push the pumpâs piston into the water-filled cylinder, the water
pressure in the cylinder rises and water accelerates and flows out through the top valve. As
you pull the pumpâs piston out of the water-filled cylinder, the water pressure inside the

withdraw the piston, the pressure inside the cylinder drops below atmospheric pressure, so
even water in an open reservoir nearby will accelerate toward the partial vacuum in the

Fig. 5.2.3 Water is

(a) As the piston is drawn
outward, water flows into
the cylinder from the lowpressure region. (b) As the
piston is pushed inward,
the inlet one-way valve
closes and water is driven
out of the cylinder and into
the high-pressure region.

Why: When you pull the piston out of the cylinder, you are moving air out of the way and creating a
partial vacuum inside the cylinder. This action requires a modest amount of work because the air
doesnât push terribly hard on the back of the piston and pressure from the water flowing into the
cylinder assists you. But as you push the piston back into the cylinder, you are pressurizing the water.
Depending on the pressure of water in the outlet hose, the water in the cylinder may exert a very large
force on the piston. In that case, you must do a great deal of work on the water as you push the
piston inward and drive the water out of the cylinder.

Moving Water: Pressure and Energy
The pump of Fig. 5.2.3 can draw low-pressure water from a pond and fill a hose with highpressure water. If the nozzle at the other end of the hose is open, the water will accelerate
toward lower pressure outside the nozzle and spray toward the garden with considerable
kinetic energy. From where does this kinetic energy come?
The energy comes from you and the pump. As you push the piston into the cylinder,
pressurizing the water and squeezing it out through the top valve, youâre doing work on the
waterâyouâre exerting an inward force on the water, and the water is moving a distance in
the direction of your force. The inward force you exert on the water is equal to the water
pressure times the surface area of the piston, or
force = pressure Âˇ surface area,
and the distance the water moves is equal to the volume of water pumped divided by the
surface area of the piston, or
distance =

volume
.
surface area

Since work equals force times distance, the work you do pumping water is equal to the
water pressure times the volume of water you pump, or
work = pressure Âˇ volume.
As you pump high-pressure water through the hose, high-speed water sprays out of its
nozzle. Since water is incompressible, water enters and exits the hose at equal rates and the
work you do pumping 1 liter of water into the hose becomes kinetic energy in 1 liter of
water leaving the nozzle. That energy travels directly from the pump to the nozzle, and the
water doesnât actually store any of it along the way. Nonetheless, we can imagine that the
waterâs kinetic energy after it reaches the nozzle was stored in that waterâs pressure before
the nozzle. We create a useful fictionâpressure potential energy. Water thatâs under pressure has a pressure potential energy equal to the waterâs volume times its pressure.
Because pressure potential energy actually comes from the pump, it vanishes as soon
as you break the link between the pressurized water and the pump that pressurizes it; you
canât save a bottle of high-pressure water and expect it to retain this potential energy. The

Water Distribution

135

concept of pressure potential energy is meaningful only if the water is flowing steadily, so
that water leaving the plumbing is replaced exactly by water from the pump or something
equivalent. The ideal situation in which to use the concept of pressure potential energy is
also the simplest type of water flowâflow in which nothing ever changes. In keeping with
its constancy, this situation is known as steady-state flow.
In steady-state flow, a fluid flows continuously and steadily through a stationary environment. When you watch steady-state flow, you canât detect the passage of time in either
the fluid or its environment, and a video of steady-state flow looks exactly like a still photograph. With small allowances for the inevitable imperfections of real life, water traveling
steadily through plumbing in your home, a soft wind blowing smoothly across your
motionless cheek, and a gentle current flowing silently between the motionless banks of a
lazy river are all cases of steady-state flow in fluids.
Although pumps and other devices with moving components arenât allowed in steadystate flow, they can be connected to it so long as they operate steadily. For example, if you
pump water as steadily as you can through a motionless hose and nozzle, the water will
exhibit steady-state flow from where it enters the hose to well after it sprays out of the
nozzle.
The beauty of steady-state flow is in how it handles energy along streamlines. A
streamline is the path taken by a tiny portion of water in the flow, a portion that I refer to
here as a âdrop.â In steady-state flow, an endless series of identical drops travels that same
unchanging streamline, like the cars of an infinite train on a stationary track. In steady-state
flow with no friction-like effects, a dropâs ordered energy remains constant as it travels
along its streamline. Moreover, since all the drops along that streamline are identical, the
ordered energy per drop is constant everywhere along that streamline. As weâll soon see,
those observations are surprisingly useful.
A dropâs ordered energy can take three different forms: kinetic energy, pressure potential energy, and gravitational potential energy. Since weâre still considering plumbing in a
level region, weâll omit gravitational potential energy for now. Weâve already seen that the
dropâs pressure potential energy is equal to its pressure times its volume. The dropâs kinetic
energy is given by Eq. 2.2.2 as one-half its mass times the square of its speed. Since a
dropâs mass is its density times its volume, the dropâs ordered energy is
ordered energy = pressure potential energy + kinetic energy
= pressure Âˇ volume + 12 Âˇ density Âˇ volume Âˇ speed2
= constant (along a streamline).

(5.2.1)

If we divide both sides of this expression by the dropâs volume, we can obtain another
useful form of this relationship:
ordered energy
pressure potential energy
kinetic energy
=
+
volume
volume

= pressure + 12 Âˇ density Âˇ speed2
= constant (along a streamline).

Equation 5.2.2 is called Bernoulliâs equation, after Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli 3 ,
whose work led to its development, although Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler
(1707â1783) actually completed it. It applies only to incompressible fluids such as water
and assumes no ordered energy is wasted by friction-like effects.
According to Eq. 5.2.2, water thatâs in steady-state flow can exchange pressure for
speed or speed for pressure as it flows along a streamline. As water accelerates out of a
nozzle, for example, its pressure drops but its speed increases because itâs converting pressure potential energy into kinetic energy. And as that moving water sprays against the car

energy back into pressure potential energy. In both cases, the waterâs ordered energy is

Check Your Understanding #3: How Does Your Garden Grow?
Water in your garden hose has considerable pressure and arcs several meters through the air as you
water your plants. What is the water pressure in the falling water once it leaves the nozzle at the end
of the hose?
Answer: It is atmospheric pressure.
Why: As the water accelerates out of the nozzle, its pressure drops. It is converting pressure potential
energy into kinetic energy. The water pressure drops until it reaches the pressure of the surrounding
air, which is atmospheric pressure.

Fig. 5.2.4 The pressure
of stationary water in pipes
increases with depth by
about 10,000 Pa per meter
of depth. The shape of the
pipes doesnât matter. For
plumbing thatâs open on
top and connected near
the bottom, as shown here,
water will tend to flow
until its height is uniform
throughout the plumbing.

Gravity creates a downward pressure gradient in water; the deeper the water, the more
weight there is overhead and the greater the pressure. Since water is much denser than air,
water pressure increases rapidly with depth. In a vertical pipe thatâs open on top, the waterâs
surface is at atmospheric pressure (about 100,000 Pa). Only 10 m (33 feet) below the
waterâs surface, however, the pressure has already doubled to 200,000 Pa. At that modest
depth, the water overhead weighs as much as the air overhead, even though the atmosphere
is many kilometers thick.
The shape of the pipe doesnât affect the relationship between pressure and depth. No
matter how complicated the plumbing, the pressure of stationary water inside it increases
with depth by 10,000 Pa per meter, or 10,000 Pa/m (Fig 5.2.4). This uniform downward
pressure gradient creates an upward buoyant force on anything immersed in the water. In
fact, that buoyant force is what supports the water itself (Fig. 5.2.5).
The dependence of water pressure on depth has a number of important implications for
water distribution. First, water pressure at the bottom of a tall pipe is substantially higher
than at the top of that same pipe. Consequently, if only a single pipe supplies water to a
skyscraper, then the water pressure on the ground floor will be dangerously high while the
pressure in the penthouse will be barely enough for a decent shower. Tall buildings must
therefore handle water pressure very carefully; they canât simply supply water to every
floor directly from the same pipe.
Second, pressure in a city water main does more than just accelerate water out of a
showerhead; it also supports water in the pipes of multistory buildings. Lifting water to the
third floor against the downward force of gravity requires a large upward force, and that
force is provided by water pressure. The higher you want to lift the water, the more water
pressure you need at the bottom of the plumbing. Lifting the water also requires energy,
which is often provided by a water pump.
Third, as water travels up and down the streets of a hilly city, its pressure varies with
height. In the valleys the pressure can be very large, and at the tops of hills the pressure can
be very small. Water mains in valleys must therefore be particularly strong to keep from
bursting. The large pressure in a valley is quite useful because it helps push the water back
uphill on the other side of the valley (Fig. 5.2.6). Nonetheless, a hilly city must have pumping stations and other water-pressure-control systems located throughout to provide reasonable water pressures to all the buildings, regardless of their altitudes.
Apart from those pressure-control systems, even a hilly cityâs plumbing often involves
steady-state flow and can be explained using a version of Bernoulliâs equation that includes
gravity. Before we explore that topic, though, letâs take a look at the non-steady-state flow
that occurs when water in an isolated section of plumbing has free surfaces that can move
up or down so that you see things change with time.

Check Your Understanding #4: Whatâs the Water Pressure?
If all the water to a 400-m-tall skyscraper were delivered from a single pipe, how much higher would
the water pressure be on the ground floor than on the top floor?
Answer: It would be about 4,000,000 Pa (40 atmospheres) higher.

ÂŠ The Granger Collection, New York

Why: The weight of water inside the pipe would create an enormous excess pressure near the bottom
of the building. Water spraying from an open faucet on the first floor at this enormous pressure could
accelerate to 319 km/h (200 mph), as it does in some high-pressure jet washing and cutting machines.

Fig. 5.2.6 Los Angeles receives much of its water from
Owens Valley, 300 km to the north. The water negotiates
the mountains and valleys in between, driven by gravity
alone. Giant pipes allow pressure to build during downhill
stretches to push the water back uphill later on. Parts of
the 1913 aqueduct support so much pressure that the
steel pipe used in them has to be more than an inch thick.

When all of those free surfaces are at atmospheric pressure, there are no pressure
imbalances and the water accelerates only in response to gravity. The waterâs only potential
energy is gravitational and, like any object, it accelerates in the direction that lowers that
gravitational potential as quickly as possible. If the waterâs free surface is higher in one
place than another, it can reduce its average height and, therefore, its gravitational potential
energy by letting its highest water fill in its lowest valley. After some sloshing about, the
water settles down in stable equilibrium with all its free surfaces smooth and level at a
single uniform height. No matter how complicated the plumbing, water that is open to the
air on top always âseeks its level.â The natural flow associated with this leveling effect is
often used in water delivery (see 4 ).
Remarkably, the leveling effect works even when some of the water-filled plumbing is
located above the waterâs free surfaces. For example, water can seek its level between two
open containers through an elevated pipe known as a siphon (Fig. 5.2.7). In such cases, the
pressure of water in those elevated segments of plumbing is less than atmospheric pressure.
If you seal off part of the isolated plumbing and reduce the pressure above one of the
waterâs free surfaces, that surface will rise higher than all of the others. It will rise until the
added pressure produced by the taller column of water replaces the missing pressure above
the waterâs free surface. The less pressure there is above that surface, the higher the water
must rise to make up for the missing pressure. This effect lifts water in a drinking straw and
allows it to travel between two open containers in a siphon.
However, removing all the air pressure above the waterâs free surface inside a long
straw or siphon will raise its height only about 10 m (33 feet) above the level of the water
elsewhere in an open container. Even with no pressure above it, this 10-m column of elevated water completely replaces the absent air pressure and thus prevents water in the rest
of the plumbing from lifting it any higher. Itâs therefore impossible to draw water from a
deep well simply by lowering a pipe into that well and reducing the air pressure in the pipe;
the water will rise no more than 10 m upward. Instead, a pump must be attached to the
bottom of the pipe to pressurize the water and push it all the way to the top of the pipe.

Moving Water Again: Gravity
As weâve seen, it takes pressure and energy to lift water to the third floor of a building. We
can now expand our description of fluids undergoing steady-state flow to include gravity
and gravitational potential energy.
A dropâs gravitational potential energy is given by Eq. 1.3.2 as its mass times the
acceleration due to gravity times its height. The waterâs gravitational potential energy per
volume is thus its density times the acceleration due to gravity times its height.
If we include gravitational potential energy in Eq. 5.2.2 and recognize that, for fluids
in steady-state flow along a streamline, the energy per volume is constant, we obtain a
relationship that can be written as a word equation:
ordered energy
pressure potential energy

p + 12 Âˇ Ď Âˇ v2 + Ď Âˇ g Âˇ h = constant (along a streamline),
and in everyday language:
When a stream of water speeds up in a nozzle or flows uphill in a pipe,
its pressure drops.
This is a revised version of Bernoulliâs equation, one that includes gravity. It correctly
describes steady-state flow in streamlines that change height. As before, it applies only
to incompressible fluids such as water and assumes no ordered energy is wasted by
friction-like effects.

BERNOULLIâS EQUATION
For an incompressible, frictionless fluid in steady-state flow, the sum of its pressure
potential energy, its kinetic energy, and its gravitational potential energy is constant
along a streamline. Equation 5.2.3 expresses this law as a formula.

Water Distribution

Fig. 5.2.8 Many buildings in New York City have water towers on their roofs. These towers maintain
water pressure in the plumbing and help in firefighting.

Because energy is conserved, water thatâs in steady-state flow can exchange the energies associated with its speed, pressure, and height for one another. Thus as water
flows downward, its speed or pressure or both increase; if it falls from an open faucet,
its speed increases; and if it descends steadily inside a uniform pipe, its pressure
increases. The reverse happens as water flows upward. Water rising from a fountain
loses speed as it ascends, while water rising steadily in a uniform pipe loses pressure
on its way up.
This interchangeability of height, pressure, and speed makes it possible to pressurize
plumbing by connecting a tall column of water to the pipes. Thatâs why cities, communities, and even individual buildings have water towers (Fig. 5.2.8). A water tower is
built at a relatively high site within the region it serves. A pump fills the water tower
with water, and then gravity maintains a constant high pressure throughout the plumbing that connects to it (Fig. 5.2.9). The water is at atmospheric pressure at the top of
the water tower, but the pressure is much higher at the bottom; at the base of a 50-m-high
water tower, for example, the pressure is about 600,000 Pa, or six times atmospheric
pressure.
In addition to providing a fairly steady pressure in the water mains, a water tower
stores energy efficiently and can deliver that energy quickly. When water is drawn out of
the water tower, its gravitational potential energy at the top becomes pressure potential
energy at the bottom. The water tower replaces a pump, supplying a steady flow of water at
an almost constant high pressure. Unlike a pump, however, the water tower can supply this
high-pressure water at an enormous rate. As long as the water level doesnât drop too far,
high-pressure water keeps flowing.

Check Your Understanding #5: Water Power
A hydroelectric power plant extracts energy from water that has descended from an elevated reservoir
in a pipe. In the reservoir, this energy takes the form of gravitational potential energy. Just before the
power plant, what form does the energy take?
Answer: It takes the form of pressure potential energy (and some kinetic energy).
Why: As the water descends inside the pipe, its gravitational potential energy is converted into pressure potential energy. The water reaching the power plant is under enormous pressure, and itâs this
pressure that exerts the forces needed to turn the turbines that run the generators. Work is required
to turn the turbines, so the water gives up much of its energy in the power plant. This energy leaves
the power plant via the electric power lines.

If the water pressure at the entrance to a building is 1,000,000 Pa, how high can the water rise
inside the building and how fast will it flow out of a faucet right at the entrance? (A liter of water
inside a pipe has a mass of 1 kg.)
Answer: It can rise about 100 m or emerge from the faucet at about 45 m/s (101 mph).
Why: As the water flows through the pipe (a streamline), its pressure potential energy can become
gravitational potential energy or kinetic energy. At the start, the waterâs energy is all pressure potential energy so, from Eq. 5.2.3, the waterâs energy per volume is 1,000,000 Pa. If the water flows up
the pipe, that energy will become gravitational potential energy. We can rearrange Eq. 5.2.3 to find

Epilogue for Chapter 5
In this chapter we have investigated some of the basic concepts associated with fluids.
In Balloons, we explored the concept of pressure and the way in which air pressure
structures and supports Earthâs atmosphere. We saw that increased air pressure beneath
an object produces an upward buoyant force on that object and that this buoyant force
can float objects, such as hot-air and helium balloons, that are less dense than the
surrounding air.
In Water Distribution, we examined how water pressure causes water to accelerate
through plumbing, from high pressure to low pressure. We then focused on ways to produce water pressure, either using pumps or using gravity. By studying the forms of energy
in water, we were led to Bernoulliâs equation, which describes the interconversion of a
fluidâs ordered energy among pressure potential energy, kinetic energy, and gravitational
potential energy. Although the most dramatic applications of Bernoulliâs equation are
ahead of us, weâve already used it to understand the changes in pressure and speed that
accompany waterâs movement up and down in pipes and in fountains.

Explanation: A Cartesian Diver
The diver floats because its average densityâthat is, the mass of the vial and its contents
divided by the volume of space those two components occupyâis less than the density
of water. Since the upward buoyant force on the diver exceeds its downward weight, the
diver floats upward toward the top of the bottle. When the diver begins to stick out of the
water, it displaces less water and more air and the buoyant force it experiences decreases.
Eventually it experiences zero net force and floats without accelerating at the waterâs
surface.
When you squeeze the soda bottle, you increase the pressure inside it. Because water
is incompressible, its density doesnât change as the pressure goes up. However, the air

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations

141

bubble inside the vial is compressed and takes up less space inside the vial. Water flows
into the vial and increases the average density of the vial and its contents. When the average
density of the diver finally exceeds the density of water, the diver sinks.
To keep the diver hovering in the water, you must adjust the water pressure until the
diverâs average density is exactly that of water. This adjustment is impossible to make
without looking at the diver. Even the slightest overpressure or underpressure will cause the
diver to drift slowly down or up.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Balloons Work: A hot-air balloon floats because its total weight (basket, envelope, and
hot air) is less than that of the cooler air it displaces. By heating the air in the envelope with
a flame, the pilot reduces its density. As the air warms up, fewer particles are needed to fill
the envelope, the extra particles flow out of the envelope through the opening at its bottom,
and the balloon becomes lighter.
A helium balloon also weighs less than the air it displaces. However, its lower weight is
due to the lightness of the individual helium atoms, each of which weighs much less than
the air particle it replaces. By filling a balloon with helium, the balloonâs weight is dramatically reduced. Since the buoyant force exerted on the balloon by the surrounding air exceeds
the balloonâs weight, the balloon accelerates upward.
How Water Distribution Works: Water distribution begins when a pump transfers low-pressure
water from a reservoir to high-pressure plumbing. Along a level path, water accelerates
toward regions of lower pressure, such as open hoses or showerheads. Pressure imbalances
allow the water to negotiate bends in the pipes en route to its destination. During its travels,
the water may rise or fall in height; as it does, its pressure changes, decreasing as the water
moves upward and increasing as the water moves downward. In low-lying regions, where the
water pressure may be too high to use directly, a pressure regulator may have to be added to
the plumbing. In high-lying regions, where the water pressure may be too low to be practical,
an additional pump may have to be employed to boost its pressure.

immersed in a fluid is acted on by an upward buoyant force

Fluids and Motion
luids are fascinating when they move. Stationary water and air may be essential to life, but
theyâre also fairly simple; only their pressures vary from place to place, and even these are
determined primarily by gravity. Rushing rivers or gusts of wind, however, with their wonderful
variety of simple and complicated behaviors, are much more exciting. The motions of fluids arenât
just interesting; theyâre also important, since our world is filled with objects and machines that work
in whole or part because of the behaviors of moving fluids. In this chapter, we look at a variety of
situations in which fluid motion contributes to the way things work.

Seal the rectangular box on all edges with tape, and
cut a circular hole 5 cm. (2 in.) in diameter in the center
of one face. To use your cannon, just tap hard on the other

Fluids are real; they exist independently of any solids that
might move through them. That notion is easy to accept
in reference to water, since we can see that water doesnât
wait for a boat to pass before moving in interesting ways.
Air is harder to visualize in this fashion because we seldom see it by itself, apart from its effects on buildings or
airplanes or our skin.

Although you canât see these rings, you can follow
their motion by looking for their effects on objects they
encounter. The rings can easily blow out candles or rustle
light window drapes across a small room. If you have a
friend blow some rings at you, youâll feel exactly where
they hit on your face or shirt.
To see these rings directly, fill the cereal box with
smoke, mist, or dust. What do you think the rings will
look like when they emerge from the hole? Will the
smoke in each ring be stationary, or will it be swirling
about the ring in some manner? How will the ringâs size

and speed of travel depend on the size of the hole from
which it emerges? Will it depend on how hard you tap the
cereal box? Will the ringâs size and speed change in
flight?
Now tap the box and watch the smoke rings. What
motions do you see? Change the hole size and see how
this change affects the rings and their motion. As you can
see, the air can execute some very complicated movements all by itself. In this chapter, we will examine how
moving air, water, and other fluids affect our everyday
lives.

In particular, we explore (1) garden watering, (2) balls sports:
air, and (3) airplanes. In Garden Watering, we look at how
waterâs pressure and speed vary as it flows through a faucet, a
hose, and a nozzle. In Ball Sports: Air, we investigate the effects
of air on the motions of balls. In Airplanes, we study the ways in
which moving air supports and propels airplanes in flight. A
more complete preview can be found in the Chapter Summary

SECTION 6.1

This chapter continues to develop the concept of energy
conservation along a streamline that was introduced in
Chapter 5. It also brings up several new types of forces that
are present when fluids move past one another or past solid
objects. These ideas are present in a vast array of commonplace activities, from washing windows with a hose to pumping water with a windmill.

of the laws of fluid flow and will introduce us to several important complications, notably friction-like effects and turbulence, that we had previously chosen to ignore.

Questions to Think About: What determines the rate at
which water flows through a hose? If honey ran through your
hose instead of water, how would that affect the flow? Why
does water make noise as you sprinkle your garden? Why
does a nozzle make the water spray so fast and so far?
Why do the pipes sometimes clank when you abruptly close
the faucet?

Hose

Tending a flower garden often involves watering. While this
once meant walking the gardenâs paths with a watering can,
modern plumbing has made such effort unnecessary. With a
hose and nozzle attached to a faucet, you can do your job
without leaving your lawn chair. Although the tools involvedâ

Experiments to Do: Open a faucet gradually and watch the
water begin to flow. Whatâs pushing the water out of the faucet? What happens to the flow rate and speed of the water as
you open the faucet further? Look below or behind the faucet
and try to determine how the water enters and exits the faucet.
When do you hear the water flowing?
Attach a hose to the faucet. Does the water flow as
quickly from the open end of the hose as it did from the
faucet alone? Cover most of the hose end with your thumb
and watch the water spray out into the air. Why does the

144

CHAPT ER 6 Fluids and Motion

water travel so much farther when you almost stop its flow?
Do you feel the water pressing against your thumb? Attach a
nozzle to the hose and see how the flow rate affects the

strength of the spray. Fill a bucket with the open hose and
then again while using the nozzle. Which method fills the
bucket faster?

Waterâs Viscosity
1 Your carâs engine is
protected by motor oil
with a carefully chosen
viscosity. If that oil were
too thin, it would flow out
from between surfaces
and wouldnât keep them
from rubbing against one
another. If that oil were
too thick, the engine
would waste power
moving its parts through
the oil. Years ago, you had
to change your motor oil
for the season. Thick
40-weight motor oil was
used in summer because
hot weather made it
thinner; thin 10-weight oil
was used in winter
because cold weather
made it thicker. Now, a
modern multigrade oil
maintains a nearly
constant viscosity over a
wide range of temperatures and need not be
changed with the seasons.
This oil contains tiny
molecular chains that ball
up when cold but
straighten out when hot.
These chains thicken hot
oil so that 10W-40 oil
resembles 10-weight oil in
winter and 40-weight oil
in summer.

Having brought water to your home in the previous chapter, weâre already well on our way
to watering your garden. However, to reach the garden, water must first travel through a
long stretch of hose thatâs lying straight on level ground. Does the length of this hose have
any effect on the water delivery process?
The answer is yes, longer hoses generally deliver less water. However, according to
what we learned in Chapter 5, water should coast through a straight, level hose at a constant
velocity and constant pressure, and the length of that hose shouldnât matter. We evidently
overlooked something importantâfriction. Moving water doesnât slide freely through a
stationary hose. In reality, it experiences frictional forces that oppose its motion relative to
the hose.
This friction is unusual, though, because most of the water in the hose never actually
touches the hose itself. If water deep inside the hose is going to experience any forces due
to relative motion, then those forces are going to have to occur within the water. Water must
exert frictional forces on itself!
Sure enough, water does experience internal frictional forces. Theyâre called viscous
forces, forces that appear whenever one layer of a fluid tries to slide across another layer of
that fluid. Viscous forces oppose relative motion, and you can observe their effects easily
when you pour honey out of a jar. The honey at the jarâs surface is stuck there by chemical
forces and remains stationary. But even honey thatâs far from the walls canât move easily;
it experiences viscous forces as it tries to move relative to nearby honey. Since honey is a
âthick,â or viscous, fluid, viscous forces act quite effectively to keep all the honey moving
with nearly the same velocity. Since the honey at the walls canât move, viscous forces tend
to prevent any of the honey from moving.
Water isnât as thick as honey (Table 6.1.1), so itâs less resistant to relative motion. The
measure of this resistance to relative motion within a fluid is called viscosity, and waterâs
viscosity is less than that of honey. In fact, if you heat the water up, it will become even less
viscous and thus flow more easily. Typical of most liquids, this decrease in viscosity with
increasing temperature reflects the molecular origins of viscous forces: the molecules in a
liquid stick to one another, forming weak chemical bonds that require energy to break. In a
hot liquid, the molecules have more thermal energy, so they break these bonds more easily
to move past one another (see 1 ).

Check Your Understanding #1: Keeping Warm on a Windy Day
A loosely woven wool sweater has many tiny air passages between the wool fibers, yet it dramatically
reduces the rate at which air flows through to your skin when you stand in a breeze. Why doesnât air
flow easily through the gaps between the fibers?
Answer: The air at the surfaces of the fibers is stationary, and the airâs viscosity slows the motion of
air in the vicinity of the fibers.
Why: Although air trying to pass through the gaps may not directly touch the fibers, viscous forces
tend to keep all the air moving together at the same velocity. As soon as some air is held up by a fiber,
the air nearby is slowed by viscous forces. The fibers of a sweater are close enough together that
viscous forces slow all the air trying to pass through the sweater. Imagine trying to pour honey
through a sweater.

Flow in a Straight Hose: The Effect of Viscosity
Viscosity slows the flow of water through your hose. Chemical forces between the hose and
the outermost layer of water hold that layer of water stationary, and this motionless layer
exerts viscous forces on the layer of moving water inside it. As this second layer slows, it
exerts viscous forces on yet another layer. Layer by layer, viscous forces hold back the
moving water until even water at the center of the hose feels viscosityâs slowing effects
(Fig. 6.1.1). Although water at the center of the hose moves faster than water in any other
layer, itâs still affected by the stationary hose.
These viscous forces impede water delivery. Instead of coasting effortlessly through
the straight, level hose, real water needs a pressure gradient to push it steadily forward.
Like the file cabinet sliding on the sidewalk in Section 2.2, water must be pushed through
the hose if itâs to maintain a continuous flow. Also like that file cabinet, the water becomes
hotter as the work done pushing it forward is wasted and becomes thermal energy.
However, unlike the forces of ordinary sliding frictionâwhich donât depend on relative
velocitiesâviscous forces become larger as the relative velocities within a fluid increase.
Thatâs because as two layers of water slide past one another faster, their molecules collide
harder and more frequently. Since it experiences stronger viscous forces, fast-moving water
wastes more energy per meter and needs a larger pressure gradient to keep it moving steadily through a hose than does slow-moving water.
Because of viscous forces, the amount of water flowing steadily through a hose has
four properties:
1.
2.
3.

4.

Itâs inversely proportional to the waterâs viscosity. The more viscous the water, the
more difficulty it has flowing through the hose.
Itâs inversely proportional to the length of the hose. The longer the hose, the more
opportunity viscous forces have to slow the water down.
Itâs proportional to the pressure difference between the hoseâs inlet and its outlet.
This pressure difference determines the waterâs pressure gradient and thus how
hard the water is pushed forward through the hose.
Itâs proportional to the fourth power of the diameter of the hose. Tripling the
hoseâs diameter provides the water with nine times as much room and also allows
water near the hoseâs center to move nine times faster.

We can turn these four proportional relationships into an equation by adding the correct
numerical constant (Ď/128). The final relationship is called Poiseuilleâs law and can be
written as a word equation:

POISEUILLEâS LAW
The volume of fluid flowing through a cylindrical pipe each second is equal to (đ/128)
times the pressure difference (Îp) across that pipe times the pipeâs diameter to the
fourth power, divided by the pipeâs length times the fluidâs viscosity (Ć).

2 To deliver large
amounts of water at high
pressure or velocity, fire
hoses must have large
diameters. When filled
with high-pressure water,
these wide hoses become
stiff and heavy, making
them difficult to handle.
Chemical additives that
decrease waterâs viscosity
allow firefighters to use
narrower, lighter, and
more flexible hoses.
3 Very large diameter
pipes are required to
transport crude oil across
the Alaskan wilderness.
The distances are long,
and the fluid is viscous,
although it is heated to
lower its viscosity.

Itâs hardly surprising that the flow rate depends in this manner on the pressure difference, pipe length, and viscosity; weâve all observed that low water pressure or a long hose
lengthens the time needed to fill a bucket with water and that viscous syrup pours slowly
from a bottle. However, the dependence of the flow rate on the fourth power of pipe diameter is unexpected. Even a small change in the diameter of a hose significantly changes the
amount of water that hose delivers each second. The two most common garden hoses in the
United States have diameters of 58 inch and 34 inch, and while these hoses differ by a seemingly insignificant 20% or a factor of 1.2 in diameter, the 34-inch hose can carry about 1.24
or two times as much water as the 58-inch hose (see 2 and 3 ).
We can also look at viscous forces in terms of ordered energy. By opposing the flow of
water through a hose, viscous forces do negative work on it and reduce its ordered energyâ
the energy considered in Bernoulliâs equation, which doesnât include thermal energy. Just
how much ordered energy the water retains depends on how fast it moves inside the hose.
If you allow lots of water to leave the hose, water will move through it quickly and encounter large viscous forces. In the process, most of the waterâs ordered energy will be wasted
as thermal energy and the water will pour gently out of the end of the hose.
However, if you partially block the hoseâs opening with your thumb and reduce the
flow, water will travel slowly through the hose and encounter smaller viscous forces. As a
result, the water will retain most of its ordered energy and will still be at high pressure
when it reaches your thumb. This high-pressure water will then accelerate to enormous
speed as it passes through the narrow opening and sprays out into the air.
We can now explain why water delivery systems normally use the widest pipes that are
practical and affordable. In contrast to a narrow hose, wide pipes can carry large amounts of
water while letting that water travel slowly, experience weak viscous forces, and waste little
of its ordered energy. In such energy-efficient water delivery systems, friction is insignificant
and Bernoulliâs equation (Eq. 5.2.4) accurately predicts waterâs properties throughout its trip.
Check Your Understanding #2: Air Ducts
The long air ducts used to ventilate homes and businesses usually have very large diameters. These
ducts are often visible near the ceilings of modern warehouse-style stores and restaurants as pipes
roughly 0.5 m across. Why must the ducts be so large in diameter?
Answer: Airâs viscosity slows its flow through ductwork. Moving large volumes of air rapidly without a
large pressure difference between inlet and outlet requires a large diameter pipe.
Why: The airflow through long ductwork is dominated by viscous forces. The volume of air moved
through ductwork is often enormous, and the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet is
normally only a fraction of an atmosphere. To allow the air to move quickly through the ducts, their
diameters must be large.

Garden Watering

Check Your Figures #1: Old Plumbing
When your friendâs house was new, the kitchen faucet could deliver 0.50 liter per second (0.50 L/s).
Over the years, mineral deposits have built up in the pipes and reduced their effective diameters by
20%. How much water can the faucet deliver now?
Answer: It can deliver about 0.20 L/s.
Why: Water flow in pipes obeys Poiseuilleâs law (Eq. 6.1.1) and is proportional to the pipe diameter
to the fourth power. Reducing the diameter by 20%, a factor of 0.8, while leaving the pipe length,
pressures, and viscosity unchanged, will reduce the volume flow rate by a factor of 0.84 or 0.41. The
pipes now deliver about 0.20 L/s (0.50 L/s times 0.41). It clearly doesnât take much mineral accumulation to dramatically reduce the flow through a pipe.

Flow in a Bent Hose: Dynamic Pressure Variations
Letâs suppose that on reaching your garden the hose bends toward the right and the flowing
water bends with it. That water is accelerating as it turns, and as we observed in Chapter 5,
water accelerates horizontally only in response to unbalanced pressures. Since the hose is
motionless, the unbalanced pressures inside it must be caused by the water itself; the water
is experiencing dynamic pressure variations.
To understand these dynamic pressure variations, letâs follow the streamlines as water
traverses this bend. Although weâve just introduced viscous forces, weâre going to ignore
them here for clarity and simplicity. Viscous forces are certainly important in the long narrow hose; however, the bend is so short that viscous forces have little effect on what happens to the water passing through it.
Neglecting viscous forces, the waterâs ordered energy is constant along each streamline
and we can observe the interchanges of energy allowed by Bernoulliâs equation (Eq. 5.2.4).
However, since the hose rests on level ground, waterâs gravitational potential energy canât vary
and the only interchanges weâll see are between pressure potential energy and kinetic energy.
Figure 6.1.2 shows the waterâs steady-state flow pattern near the bend. Weâre looking
down on the hose in this calculated drawing and, as indicated by the black streamlines,
water that is initially flowing straight ahead arcs rightward at the bend and eventually continues directly toward the right.
Water approaches the bend through a straight section of hose in which its streamlines
are straight and parallel. Water flows at constant velocity along these streamlinesâthe

148

CHAPT ER 6 Fluids and Motion

waterâs direction is fixed and it canât change its speed. If it tried to speed up, it would leave
a gap behind it; if it tried to slow down, it would cause a âtraffic jam.â The waterâs pressure
must be uniform throughout this straight section because it would accelerate if there were
any differences in pressure.
The waterâs constant velocity and uniform pressure are represented visually in
Fig. 6.1.2. Local water velocities are revealed by the directions and separations of the
streamlines. Waterâs velocity always points along its streamline, and its speed is inversely
proportional to the streamline spacing. Streamlines that become more widely spaced denote
decreasing speedâwater that slows down spreads out sideways and its streamlines separate from one another. Streamlines that become more narrowly spaced denote increasing
speedâwater that speeds up stretches out along its path and its streamlines draw toward
one another. Since the streamlines leading up to the bend are straight and evenly spaced, we
know that water moves along each streamline at constant velocity.
Local water pressure is displayed in Fig. 6.1.2 as the colors of the rainbow. Colors
toward the violet end of the spectrum denote higher pressures, while those toward the red
end of the spectrum denote lower pressures. Since the straight section has a uniform bluegreen color, the water there has a uniform, moderate pressure.
Once the water starts bending toward the right, however, its velocities and pressures
begin to vary. Since the water is accelerating toward the inside of the bend, there must be a
pressure imbalance pushing it in that direction. Sure enough, the turning stream of water
develops higher local pressure (violet) near the outside of the bend and lower local pressure
near the inside of the bend (red). A similar pressure imbalance accompanies any bend in a
fluidâs path; the pressure is always higher on the outside of the bend than it is on the inside
of that bend. After all, that pressure imbalance is what causes the fluid flow to bend!

BENDS AND PRESSURE IMBALANCES
When the path of a fluid in steady-state flow bends, the pressure on the outside of the
bend is always higher than the pressure on the inside of the bend.

To keep the ordered energy constant along a streamline, each decrease in the waterâs
local pressure is accompanied by an increase in the waterâs local speed, and the opposite is
also true. Water arcing around the outside of the bend slows down (the streamline spacing
widens) as its pressure rises, while the water arcing around the inside of the bend speeds up
(the streamline spacing narrows) as its pressure drops.
As the hose straightens out beyond the bend, the waterâs pressures and speeds return
to what they were before the bend. Water from the outside of the bend speeds up and its
pressure drops, while water from the inside of the bend slows down and its pressure rises.
In the straight section following the bend, waterâs velocity is once again constant along
each streamline and its pressure is uniform.
Odd as these pressure and speed changes may seem, they are quite real and have real
consequences. If your hose were clear and you could introduce thin threads of dye into
the flowing water, youâd see these dyed streamlines arc around the bend just as they do
in Fig. 6.1.2. If the hose were weak and couldnât tolerate excessive pressure, it would be
most likely to burst on the outside of the bend, where the local water pressure is highest.
You might wonder which causes which: Does each pressure change cause a speed
change, or does each speed change cause a pressure change? The answer is that they occur
together and are equally entitled to be called cause and effect. Once the steady-state flow
pattern has established itself, water following a particular streamline experiences rises and
falls in pressure at the same time that it experiences decreases and increases in speed. The
two effectsâpressure changes and speed changesâsimply go hand in hand.

Check Your Understanding #3: Washing Your Shirt with a Spoon
Youâre washing dishes when the stream of water falling from the kitchen faucet follows the curve of
a spoon and sprays up onto your shirt. As the stream bent upward, where was its pressure greatest?
Answer: Pressure was greatest at the surface of the spoon.
Why: The pressure in the stream of water must be higher on the outside of the bendâat the spoonâs
surfaceâthan on the inside of the bend.

Flow through a Nozzle: From Pressure to Speed
When water finally flows through the nozzle at the end of your hose, it exchanges its remaining pressure potential energy for kinetic energy and sprays out into the garden. The nozzleâs
narrowing channel initiates this energy transformation so that low-speed, high-pressure water
entering the nozzle becomes fast-moving, atmospheric-pressure water leaving the nozzle.
Figure 6.1.3 shows that, as water passes through the nozzle, the narrowing channel
herds all the streamlines together, so the waterâs local speed increases. The water following
each streamline is speeding up to squirt through the bottleneck without causing a backup.
This increase in waterâs local speed is accompanied by a decrease in waterâs local pressure,
as indicated by the color shift toward the red end of the spectrum.
By the time the water leaves the hose nozzle, its pressure has dropped all the way to
atmospheric pressure and it has turned all its available pressure potential energy into
kinetic energy. It emerges as a narrow stream of fast-moving water and arcs gracefully
through the air. No wonder you can reach the farthest parts of your garden with water when
you use a nozzle.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Speed and Pressure in Fluids
Misconception: A fast-moving fluid always has a low pressure.
Resolution: The pressure of a specific portion of fluid depends on its circumstances and can
take any value, high or low. However, if a fluid speeds up without descending as it flows along
a streamline in steady-state flow, its pressure will decrease. In that special context, the faster
moving fluid has a lower pressure.

As air rushes steadily into the narrow opening of a vacuum cleaner attachment, it accelerates to high
speed and its pressure drops well below atmospheric pressure. From where does the airâs newfound
kinetic energy come?
Answer: Even at atmospheric pressure, air has pressure potential energy. As it accelerates toward
even lower pressure in the attachment, air converts some of that pressure potential energy into
kinetic energy.
Why: Vacuum cleaners employ nozzles to get air moving very quickly. Fast-moving air rushing into the
vacuum cleaner draws dust with it and cleans your home.

As you direct the stream of water at the plants in your garden, you notice two interesting phenomena: first, the stream pushes on any surface that slows it down, and second,
it tends to break up into fragments as it flows around obstacles. The pushing effect is
another Bernoulli result: when the stream collides with a surface and bends away, its
pressure at the surface rises to cause the bend and that rising pressure pushes the
surface forward.
The breakup effect, however, is something new. In trying to go around the obstacle,
the stream of water loses its orderly structure and disintegrates into a swirling, hissing
froth. Actually, the hiss you hear is familiar; you heard it as you opened the faucet to start
water flowing through the hose. That faucet uses a movable stopper to control the flow of
water into the hose; as you opened the faucet, you gradually removed this stopper from the
water pipe to allow water to flow more freely into the hose and the faucet hissed. Whether
water encounters a plant or a faucet stopper, there is something about high speeds and
obstacles that upsets the smoothly flowing fluid.
Up until now, weâve discussed only laminar flow, the smooth, silent flow thatâs characterized by simple streamlines. In laminar flow, adjacent regions of a fluid always remain
adjacent. For example, if you place two drops of dye near one another in a smoothly flowing stream, they will remain close together indefinitely as they follow streamlines in the
laminar flow (Fig. 6.1.4, left). Laminar flow is the orderly result of viscous forces, which
tend to bring adjacent portions of fluid to the same velocity. When viscosity dominates a
fluidâs motion, the flow is usually laminar.
However, as the stream flows swiftly past rocks and obstacles, its streamlines break up
into the eddies and churning âwhite waterâ that make rafting exciting (Fig. 6.1.4, right).
The dye is quickly dispersed in this frenzied turbulence. The stream is experiencing
turbulent flow, a roiling, noisy flow in which adjacent regions of fluid soon become separated from one another as they move independently in unpredictable directions. Turbulent
flow is the disorderly consequence of inertia, which tends to propel each portion of fluid
independently according to its own momentum. When inertia dominates a fluidâs motion,
the flow is usually turbulent.

Garden Watering

The plants and faucet stopper are evidently initiating turbulence in what had been
laminar flows; flows that were dominated by viscous forces are suddenly dominated by
inertia instead. Whether a flow is laminar or turbulent depends on several characteristics of
the fluid and its environment:
1.
2.

3.

4.

The fluidâs viscosity. Viscous forces tend to keep nearby regions of fluid moving
together, so high viscosity favors laminar flow (Fig. 6.1.5).
The fluidâs speed past a stationary obstacle. The faster the fluid is moving, the
more quickly two nearby regions of fluid can become separated and the harder it
is for viscous forces to keep them together.
The size of the obstacle the fluid encounters. The larger the obstacle, the more
likely that it will cause turbulence because viscous forces will be unable to keep
the fluid ordered over such a long distance.
The fluidâs density. The denser the fluid, the less it responds to viscous forces and
the more likely it is to become turbulent.

Rather than keeping track of all four physical quantities independently, English mathematician and engineer Osborne Reynolds (1842â1912) found that they could be combined
into a single number that permits a comparison of seemingly different flows. The Reynolds
number is defined as
Reynolds number =

density Âˇ obstacle length Âˇ flow speed
.
viscosity

(6.1.2)

Courtesy Lou Bloomfield

The units on the right side of Eq. 6.1.2 cancel one another, so the Reynolds number is
dimensionless; that is, itâs just a simple number, such as 10 or 25,000. As the Reynolds
number increases, the flow goes from viscous-dominated to inertia-dominated and therefore from laminar to turbulent. In his experiments, Reynolds found that turbulence usually
appears when the Reynolds number exceeds roughly 2300. You can observe this transition
by moving a 1-cm-thick (0.4-in-thick) stick through still water. If you move the stick
slowly, about 10 cm/s (4 in/s), the Reynolds number will be about 1000 and the flow around
the stick will be laminar. But if you speed the stick up to about 50 cm/s (20 in/s), the Reynolds number will rise to about 5000 and the flow will become turbulent.

Fig. 6.1.5 Honeyâs large viscosity keeps it flowing smoothly (laminar flow) when you pour it. Waterâs
small viscosity allows it to splash about (turbulent flow) in a fountain. In both cases, the effective
obstacle length is the width of the flowing fluid, about 1 cm.

CHAPT ER 6 Fluids and Motion

One of the most common features of turbulent flows is the vortex, a swirling region of
fluid that moves in a circle around a central cavity. A vortex resembles a miniature tornado,
with its cavity created by inertia as the fluid spins. Vortices are easily visible behind a canoe
paddle, in a mixing bowl, or in a cup of coffee stirred rapidly with a spoon. Once an object
moves fast enough through a fluid to create turbulence, these vortices begin to form. Each
vortex builds up behind the object but is soon whisked away to form a wake of shed vortices, vortices that have broken free of the object that made them.
While laminar flow is fully predictable, turbulent flow exhibits chaotic behavior or
chaos; you can no longer predict exactly where any particular drop of water will go.
The study of chaos is a relatively new field of science. Because a chaotic system, that
is, a system exhibiting chaos, is exquisitely sensitive to initial conditions, even the
slightest change in those conditions may produce profound changes in its situation
later on.
Even when you canât see turbulent water flow, you can usually hear it. The churning
motion of turbulence converts some of the waterâs ordered energy into thermal energy and
sound. The turbulence near the faucet slightly reduces the waterâs ordered energy as it
enters the hose and therefore its speed as it emerges from the nozzle and sprays toward
your garden.
A different sound occurs when you abruptly close the nozzle and stop the flow of
water. Moving water has momentum, and stopping it suddenly requires an enormous backward force. Since the slowing flow is not steady state, Bernoulliâs equation doesnât apply
and the pressure can surge to astronomical values near the front of the moving water. This
pressure surge is what accelerates the water backward to slow it down and what leads to the
loud âthumpâ sound you hear as the water stops. Known as water hammer, the surging
pressure in front of stopping water jerks the nozzle, swells the hose, and may even rattle the
pipes in your home.

Check Your Understanding #5: Urban Windstorms
On a windy day in a city with many tall buildings, leaves and papers can be seen swirling about in
the air or on the sidewalks. What causes these whirling air currents?
Answer: The air flowing through the âcanyonsâ created by the buildings becomes turbulent and forms
vortices that swirl the leaves and papers.
Why: Whether an object moves through a fluid or a fluid moves past an object, a Reynolds number is
associated with the situation. When the Reynolds number becomes high enough that viscosity is
unable to keep the fluid flowing in an orderly fashion, turbulence appears. In wind blowing through
a big city, turbulence and its whirling vortices are everywhere.

Check Your Figures #2: Wind on the Open Road
Is the flow of air around a convertible laminar or turbulent as the convertible cruises down the highway? (Airâs viscosity is given in Table 6.1.1.)
Answer: Turbulent.
Why: To calculate the Reynolds number for the airflow around the car, you need airâs viscosity from
Table 6.1.1 (0.0000183 Pa â s, or 0.0000183 kg/m â s), airâs density from Section 4.1 (1.25 kg/m3),
the carâs size (roughly 3 m), and its speed through the air (roughly 55 mph or 25 m/s). You can then
calculate its approximate Reynolds number using Eq. 6.1.2:
Reynolds number =

1.25 kg/m3 Âˇ 3 m Âˇ 25 m/s
= 5.1 million.
0.0000183 kg/m Âˇ s

The convertibleâs Reynolds number is far above the threshold for turbulence (2300), so the air swirls
chaotically around the vehicle. That explains why your hair flies around wildly.

Questions to Think About: Why can you throw a real baseball so
much farther than a hollow plastic one? Why does a long fly ball
appear to drop straight down when you try to catch it in deep
center field? What kind of force could make a curveball curve?
What makes a well-hit golf ball hang in the air before falling to
the green? How can a knuckleball or spitball jitter about in flight?
Experiments to Do: To make airâs effects most apparent, you
need a ball that weighs little but has lots of surface area. A beach
ball is ideal, but a whiffle ball or hollow plastic ball will also do
nicely. See how far you can throw it. How does it stop? Does it
slow down and lose height gradually, or does it stop rapidly and
fall to the ground? Now make the ball spin as you throw it. Why
does the ball curve in flight? Does a faster spin make the ball
curve more or less? Which way is the ball spinning, and how is
the spin related to the direction of its curve? Change the direction of spin. Which way does the ball curve now?

When a Ball Moves Slowly: Laminar Airflow
One of the first things you might notice if you joined a new baseball franchise on the moon
is that pitched balls reach home plate faster than back at home. Since the moon has no
atmosphere, there is no air resistance to slow a ball down. In the previous section, we saw
how objects affect moving fluids. Now as we study aerodynamics, the science of airâs
dynamic interactions, weâll see how fluids affect moving objects.
In air, a moving ball experiences aerodynamic forcesâthat is, forces exerted on it by
the air because of their relative motion. These consist of drag forces that push the ball
downwind and lift forces that push the ball to one side or the other (Fig. 6.2.1). Weâll begin
our study of ball aerodynamics with drag forces, commonly called air resistance, and weâll
start with a slow-moving ball. The reason for starting slow is that at low speeds viscous
forces are able to organize the air as it flows around the ball; viscosity dominates over inertia, and the airflow around the slow-moving ball is laminar.
Figure 6.2.2 shows the pattern of laminar airflow around a slow-moving ball. Actually,
the pattern is the same whether the ball moves slowly through the air or the air moves
slowly past the ball. For simplicity, letâs move along with the ball and study the airflow
from the ballâs inertial frame of reference. In that inertial frame, the ball appears stationary
with the air flowing past it.
The slow-moving air separates neatly around the front of the ball and comes back
together behind it. It produces a wake, an air trail behind the ball, thatâs smooth and free of
turbulence. However, the airâs speed and pressure arenât uniform all the way around the
ball. The airflow bends several times as it travels around the ball and, as we saw in the
previous section, such bends always involve pressure imbalances. Since the air pressure far
from the ball is steadfastly atmospheric, those pressure imbalances are always caused by
pressure variations near the ballâs surface. Whenever air bends away from the ball, so
that the ball is on the outside of a bend, the pressure near the ball must be higher than
atmospheric. Whenever the air bends toward the ball, so that the ball is on the inside of a
bend, the pressure near the ball must be lower than atmospheric.

Fig. 6.2.2 The airflow around a slowly moving ball is laminar. Air slows down in front of and behind
the ball (widely spaced streamlines), and its pressure increases (shifts toward the violet end of the
spectrum). Air speeds up at the sides of the ball (narrowly spaced streamlines), and its pressure
decreases (shifts toward the red end of the spectrum). However, the pressure forces on the ball balance
one another perfectly, and it experiences no pressure drag. Only viscous drag is present to affect the ball.

4 When the airflow
around an object is
laminar, the pressure
forces on it cancel
perfectly and it experiences no drag due to
pressure imbalancesâno
pressure drag. The
absence of pressure drag
was a great puzzlement to
early aerodynamicists,
who knew that the airflow
around dust is laminar and
that it experiences a drag
force. This mystery was
named dâAlembertâs
paradox, after Jean Le
Rond dâAlembert
(1717â1783), the French
mathematician who first
recognized it. DâAlembert
and his contemporaries
didnât know about the
viscous drag force, which
is what really slows dustâs
motion through the air.

With that introduction, letâs examine the slow-moving airflow around the ball. Air
heading toward the ballâs front bends away from it, so the pressure near the front of the ball
must be higher than atmospheric. This rise in air pressure is accompanied by a decrease in
airspeed, the airâs speed relative to the ball. Figure 6.2.2 indicates the pressure rise by a
color shift toward the violet end of the spectrum and the decrease in airspeed by the widening separation of the streamlines.
The air rounding the ballâs sides bends toward it, so the pressure near those sides of the
ball must be below atmospheric. This drop in air pressure is accompanied by an increase in
airspeed. Figure 6.2.2 indicates the pressure drop by a color shift toward the red end of the
spectrum and the increase in airspeed by the narrowing separation of the streamlines.
The laminar airflow continues around to the back of the ball and then trails off behind
it. Since the departing air again bends away from the ball, the pressure near the back of the
ball must be higher than atmospheric. As before, the shift toward violet in Figure 6.2.2
indicates this pressure rise and the widening separation of the streamlines points out the
accompanying decrease in airspeed.
It may seem strange that the air pressure can be different at different points on the ball,
but thatâs what happens in a flowing stream of air. Itâs particularly remarkable that lowpressure air at the sides of the ball is able to flow around to the back of the ball, where the
pressure is higher. This air is experiencing a pressure imbalance that pushes it backward,
opposite its direction of travel. But a pressure imbalance causes acceleration, not velocity,
and the low-pressure air flowing past the sides of the ball has enough ordered energy and
forward momentum to carry it all the way to the back of the ball. Although this air slows as
it flows into the rising pressure, it manages to complete its journey.
The airflow around the ball is symmetrical, and the forces that air pressure exerts on
the ball are also symmetrical. These pressure forces cancel one another perfectly, so the
ball experiences no overall force due to pressure. Most important, the high pressure in
front of the ball is balanced by the high pressure behind it. As a result of this symmetrical
arrangement, the only aerodynamic force acting on the ball is viscous drag, the downstream frictional force caused by layers of viscous air sliding across the ballâs surface
(see 4 ).

Ball Sports: Air

Weâll soon see that viscous drag is only a small fraction of the air resistance experienced by sports balls. It is also the force that suspends dust in the air for hours and is an
important issue for airplane wings. Moreover, itâs a force that weâve encountered before:

Boundary layer

Check Your Understanding #1: Smooth Flow in a Stream
When water in a stream flows slowly past a small rock, the water in front of the rock slows down and
its increased pressure lifts the water level slightly. The water level behind the rock also rises slightly.
Explain.
Answer: The slow flow of water around the rock is laminar, so its pressure is highest at the front and
back of the rock. The increased pressure behind the rock lifts the water level there.
Why: Laminar flow around an obstacle tends to create high-pressure regions at the front and back,
and low-pressure regions on the sides. In the case of our small rock, the pressure differences are
visible as changes in the water level. At the front and back of the rock, the relatively high pressures
push the water level upward, while at the sides of the rock, the water level is depressed.

Fig. 6.2.3 As air flows
past a surface, a thin
layer of it is slowed
by viscous drag forces.
This boundary layer is
laminar at low Reynolds
numbers and doesnât
become turbulent until the
Reynolds number exceeds
about 100,000.

When a Ball Moves Fast: Turbulent Airflow
Balls donât always experience laminar airflow. Turbulence is common, particularly in
sports, and brings with it a new type of drag force. When the air flowing around a ball is
turbulent, the air pressure distribution is no longer symmetrical and the ball experiences
pressure drag, the downstream force exerted by unbalanced pressures in the moving air.
These unbalanced pressures exert an overall force on the ball that slows its motion
through the air.
A ball can experience turbulent airflow and pressure drag when the Reynolds number
exceeds about 2000. The Reynolds number, introduced in the previous section, combines
the ballâs size and speed with the airâs density and viscosity to give an indication of whether
the airflow is dominated by viscosity or inertia. At low Reynolds numbers, the airâs viscosity
dominates over its inertia and the airflow is laminar. At high Reynolds numbers, however,
airâs inertia dominates over its viscosity and the airflow tends to become turbulent. This
turbulence, however, wonât start until something triggers it, and viscosity provides that
trigger.
To understand viscosityâs role, we must look at the air near the ballâs surface. Even in
a strong wind, viscous forces slow down a thin boundary layer of air near the ballâs
surface (Fig. 6.2.3). Discovered by Ludwig Prandtl 5 with help from Gustave Eiffel
(Fig. 6.2.4), this boundary layer moves more slowly and has less ordered energy than the
freely flowing air farther from the surface.
As air flows toward the back of the ball, it travels through an adverse pressure gradient, a region of rising pressure that pushes backward on the air and causes it to decelerate.
While the freely flowing airstream outside the boundary layer has enough energy and forward momentum to continue onward and reach the back of the ball on its own, air in the
boundary layer does not. It needs a forward push.
At low Reynolds numbers, the entire airstream helps to push that boundary layer all
the way to the back of the ball and the airflow remains laminar. At high Reynolds numbers, however, viscous forces between the freely flowing airstream and the boundary
layer are too weak to keep the boundary layer moving forward into the rising pressure
behind the ball.
Without adequate help, the boundary layer eventually stalls; that is, it comes to a stop
and thereby spoils steady-state flow. More horrible still, this stalled boundary layer air is
pushed backward by the adverse pressure gradient and returns all the way to the ballâs
sides. As it does, it cuts like a wedge between the ball and the freely flowing airstream. The

result is an aerodynamic catastropheâthe airstream separates from the ball, leaving a huge
turbulent wake or air pocket behind the ball (Fig. 6.2.5).
Because of this turbulent wake, air no longer bends smoothly away from the back of
the ball and there is no rise in pressure there. Instead, the pressure behind the ball is
roughly atmospheric. The absence of a high-pressure region behind the ball spoils the
symmetry of pressure forces on the ball, and those forces no longer cancel. The ball experiences an overall pressure force downwindâthe force of pressure drag. In effect, the ball
is transferring forward momentum to the air in its turbulent wake and dragging that wake
along with it.
Pressure drag slows the flight of almost any ball moving faster than a snailâs pace. The
pressure drag force is roughly proportional to the cross-sectional area of the turbulent air
pocket and to the square of the ballâs speed through the air. Area times speed is the volume
of air the ball affects per second. The second factor of speed recognizes how much the airâs
speed changes as the ball drags it along in its air pocket. For a ball moving at a moderate
speed, the air pocket is about as wide as the ball and the ball experiences a large pressure
drag force.

Check Your Understanding #2: Leaving No Trace
When your canoe coasts extremely slowly across the water of a still lake, it leaves almost no trail in
the water behind it. When you paddle it swiftly through the water, however, the canoe leaves a swirling wake. Explain this difference.
Answer: The slow-moving canoe experiences laminar flow in the water, while the fast-moving canoe
experiences turbulent flow.
Why: If the canoeâs speed is less than about 1 cm/s, its Reynolds number will be less than 2000 and
the water flow around it will be laminar. The water will pass smoothly around the canoeâs sides and
join back together behind it. However, when the canoe is moving fast enough that its Reynolds number exceeds 2000, the water flow becomes turbulent and the canoe leaves a churning wake in the
water behind it. This wake produces pressure drag on the canoe and extracts energy from it. Anyone
who has paddled a canoe knows that overcoming this pressure drag can be exhausting.

The Dimples on a Golf Ball
If this were the whole story, you would never hit a home run at a baseball game or a
250-yard drive on the golf course. But inertia has yet another card to play.
At very high Reynolds numbers, the boundary layer itself becomes turbulent
(Fig. 6.2.6). It loses its laminar streamlines and begins to mix rapidly within itself and with
the freely flowing airstream nearby. This mixing brings additional ordered energy and forward momentum into the boundary layer and makes it both harder to stop and more resistant to reversed flow. Although this turbulent boundary layer still stalls before reaching the
back of the ball, the stalled air flows upstream only a short distance. The freely flowing
airstream still separates from the ball; however, that separation occurs far back on the ball
and the resulting turbulent wake is relatively small (Fig. 6.2.7).
As a result of this smaller air pocket, the pressure drag is reduced from what it would
be without the turbulent boundary layer. The effect of replacing the laminar boundary layer
with a turbulent one is enormous; itâs the difference between a golf drive of 70 yards and
one of 250 yards! The effects of the Reynolds number on the airflow around a ball are
summarized in Table 6.2.1.
Delaying the airflow separation behind the back of the ball is so important to distance
and speed that the balls of some sports are designed to encourage a turbulent boundary
layer (Fig. 6.2.8). Rather than waiting for the Reynolds number to exceed 100,000, the
point near which the boundary layer spontaneously becomes turbulent, these balls âtripâ
the boundary layer deliberately (Fig. 6.2.9). They introduce some impediment to laminar
flow that causes the air near the ballâs surface to tumble about and become turbulent. The
drop in pressure drag more than makes up for the small increase in viscous drag, which is
why a golf ball has dimples. A tennis ballâs fuzz, however, evidently creates more drag than
it eliminates; shaving a tennis ball would actually help it maintain its speed.

How much does drag affect balls in various sports? For those that involve rapid movements through air or water, the answer is quite a bit. Drag forces increase dramatically with
speed; as soon as a turbulent wake and pressure drag appear, the drag force increases as the
square of a ballâs speed. As a result, baseball pitches slow significantly during their flights
to home plate, and the faster theyâre thrown, the more speed they lose. A 90-mph fastball
loses about 8 mph en route, while a 70-mph curveball loses only about 6 mph.
A batted ball fares slightly better because it travels fast enough for the boundary layer
around it to become turbulent, an effect that appears at around 160 km/h (100 mph). While
the resulting reduction in drag explains why itâs possible to hit a home run, the presence of
air drag still shortens the distance the ball travels by as much as 50%. Without air drag, a
routine fly ball would become an out-of-the-park home run. To compensate for air drag, the
angle at which the ball should be hit for maximum distance isnât the theoretical 45Â° above
horizontal discussed in Section 1.2. Because of the ballâs tendency to lose downfield velocity, it should be hit at a slightly lower angle, about 35Â° above horizontal (Fig. 6.2.10).
Since the ball loses much of its horizontal component of velocity during its trip to the
outfield, a long fly ball tends to drop almost straight down as you catch it. Gravity causes it
to move downward, but drag almost stops its horizontal motion away from home plate.
Drag also limits the downward speed of a falling ball to about 160 km/h (100 mph). Thatâs
the baseballâs terminal velocity, the downward velocity at which the upward drag force
exactly balances its downward weight and it stops accelerating. Even if the ball is dropped
from a plane, its velocity wonât exceed this value.

Ball Sports: Air

Check Your Understanding #3: Designing a Great Sports Car
As an automobile designer, your job is to minimize the aerodynamic drag experienced by the car on
which you are working. Where should you try to locate the point at which the airflow separates from
the car?
Answer: The point should be located as far back on the car as possible.
Why: As for all large, fast-moving objects in air, pressure drag is the main source of air resistance.
You want to minimize this drag by keeping the air flowing smoothly over the car until it leaves the
rear around a small turbulent wake. The smaller the air pocket behind a car, the better. Aerodynamically designed production cars leave a turbulent wake that is only about one-third as large in area as
the thickest cross section of the car. Although there is still room for improvement, these cars experience far less drag than the boxy cars of earlier times.

Curveballs and Knuckleballs
The drag forces on a ball push it downstream, parallel to the onrushing air. In some cases,
though, the ball may also experience lift forcesâforces that are exerted perpendicular to
the airflow (Fig. 6.2.1). To experience drag, the ball only has to slow the airflow down; to
experience lift, the ball must deflect the airflow to one side or the other. Although its name
implies an upward force, lift can also push the ball toward the side or even downward.
Curveballs and knuckleballs both use lift forces. In each of these famous baseball pitches,
the ball deflects the airstream toward one side and the ball accelerates toward the other. Again
we have action and reactionâthe air and the ball push off one another. Getting the air to push
the ball sideways is no small trick. Explaining it isnât easy either, but here we go.
A curveball is thrown by making the ball spin rapidly about an axis perpendicular to
its direction of motion. The choice of this axis determines which way the ball curves. In
Fig. 6.2.11, the ball is spinning clockwise, as viewed from above. With this choice of rotation axis, the ball curves to the pitcherâs right because the ball experiences two lift forces
to the right. One is the Magnus force, named after the German physicist H. G. Magnus
(1802â1870) who discovered it. The other is a force we will call the wake deflection force.
The Magnus force occurs because the spinning ball carries some of the viscous air around
with it (Fig. 6.2.11a). The steady-state flow pattern that forms around this ball is asymmetric:
the airstream that moves with the turning surface is much longer than the airstream that moves
opposite that surface. Since the longer airstream bends mostly toward the baseball, the average
pressure on that side of the ball must be below atmospheric. The shorter airstream bends
mostly away from the ball, so the average pressure on that side of the ball must be above
atmospheric. Because the pressure forces on the ballâs sides donât balance one another, the ball
experiences the Magnus force toward the low-pressure sideâthe side turning toward the
pitcherâand deflects in that direction. The airflow deflects in the opposite direction.
In laminar flow, the Magnus force is the only lift force acting on a spinning object.
However, a pitched baseball has a turbulent wake behind it and is also acted on by the wake
deflection force. This force appears when the ballâs rapid rotation deforms the wake that
develops behind it at high Reynolds numbers. When the ball isnât spinning, the freely flowing
airstream separates from the ball approximately at its side and that separation is symmetrical all the way around the ballâs middle (Fig. 6.2.5). However, when the ball is spinning
(Fig. 6.2.11b), the moving surface pushes on the airstream with viscous forces. As a result,
airstream separation is delayed on one side of the ball and hastened on the other. The overall wake of air behind the ball is thus deflected to one side, and the ball experiences the
wake deflection force toward the opposite sideâthe side turning toward the pitcher. The
wake deflection force and the Magnus force both push the ball in the same direction.
Of these two forces, the wake deflection force is probably the more important for a
curveball, although the Magnus force is usually given all the credit. A skillful pitcher can
make a baseball curve about 0.3 m (12 in) during its flight from the mound to home plateâ

the more spin, the more curve. The pitcher counts on this change in direction to confuse the
batter. The pitcher can also choose the direction of the curve by selecting the axis of the
ballâs rotation. The ball will always curve toward the side of the ball that is turning toward
the pitcher. When thrown by a right-handed pitcher, a proper curveball curves down and to
the left, a slider curves horizontally to the left, and a screwball curves down and to the right.
When the pitcher throws a ball with backspin, so that the top of the ball turns toward
the pitcher, the ball experiences an upward lift force. In baseball this force isnât strong
enough to overcome gravity, but it does make the pitch hang in the air for an unusually long
time and appear to âhop.â Not surprisingly, a fastball thrown with strong backspin is called
a hanging fastball. A fastball thrown with relatively little spin falls naturally and is called a
sinking fastball. In golf, where the club can give the ball enormous backspin, the ball really
does lift itself upward so that it flies down the fairway like a glider.
There are, however, some interesting cases when a ballâs behavior stems from its lack
of spin. In baseball, for example, a knuckleball is thrown by giving the ball almost no rotation. The ballâs seams are then very important. As air passes over a seam, the flow is disturbed so that the ball experiences a sideways aerodynamic force, a lift force. The ball
flutters about in a remarkably erratic manner. Releasing the ball without making it spin is
difficult and requires great skill. Pitchers who are unable to throw a knuckleball legally
sometimes resort to lubricating their fingers so that the ball slips out of their hands without
spinning. Like its legal relative, this so-called spitball dithers about and is hard to hit. The
same is true for a scuffed ball.
Check Your Understanding #4: Center Court
One of the most difficult and effective strokes in tennis is the topspin lob, in which the top of the
ball spins away from the player who hit it. Which way is the lift force on this ball directed?
Answer: The lift force is directed downward, so the ball accelerates downward faster than it would by
gravity alone.
Why: A ball with topspin falls faster than it would without a spin. In tennis, the topspin strokes
appear to dive downward once they cross the net. Their downward curve means that they can travel
very fast and still remain inside the court and are thus very hard to return.

We have now set the stage for the ultimate aerodynamic
machinesâairplanes. Freed from contact with the ground, airplanes are affected only by aerodynamic forces and gravity,
hopefully in that order. Despite their complex appearances,
airplanes employ physical principles that we have already successfully examined. This section revisits many familiar concepts, but it also explores new territory. For example, you may
have already figured out what type of aerodynamic force holds
an airplane up, but what type of aerodynamic force keeps it
moving forward?
Questions to Think About: Why are the wings of small, propeller-driven aircraft relatively large and bowed compared to
those of jets? Why does a commercial airplane extend slats
and flaps from its wings during takeoffs and landings? What
pushes airplanes forward in flight? How can some airplanes fly

Experiments to Do: The best experiment for this section is to
take a plane flight or at least to visit the airport and watch the
planes.
As you sit in the plane during takeoff, feel the plane accelerating forward. If youâre on a commercial jet, notice that the
slats and flaps on the airplaneâs wings are extended during
takeoff, making the wings wider and more curved. How could
this increased width and curvature help the plane take off? The
pilot holds the plane on the ground until it reaches the proper
speed, then quickly tips it upward into the air. An invisible
vortex of air peels away from the trailing edge of the wing, and
the plane lifts off the ground.
Once airborne, the airplane retracts its landing gear, slats,
and flaps. Watch the trailing edge of each wing as the plane
turns or changes altitudes; youâll see various surfaces there
move up or down. Similar motions occur on the tail. How do
these surfaces control the planeâs orientation?
Near its destination, the airplane prepares for landing.
Again the slats and flaps are extended. Watch as spoilers on
the tops of the wings pop up and down noisily. How do these
surfaces affect the drag force on the plane? The planeâs landing gear extends, and it touches down on the runway. The propellers or jet engines abruptly begin to slow the airplane,
assisted by the spoilers on the wings. Feel the plane accelerating backward. Another invisible vortex of air peels away from
the trailing edge of the wing, rotating in the opposite direction
from the first vortex, and the flight is over.

Airplane Wings: Streamlining
By now youâve probably realized that an airplane is supported in flight by an upward lift
force on its wings and that this lift force comes from deflecting the passing airflow downward. Each wing is an airfoil, an aerodynamically engineered surface thatâs designed to
obtain particular lift and drag forces from the air flowing past it. More specifically, each
wing is shaped and oriented so that, during flight, the airstream flowing over the wing bends
downward toward its top surface while the airstream under the wing bends downward away
from its bottom surface. These bends are associated with pressure changes near the wing
itself and are responsible for the upward lift force that suspends the airplane in the sky.
However, to get a more complete understanding of how the wing develops this lift, letâs
go for a flight. Imagine yourself in an airplane that has just begun rolling down the runway.
From your perspective, air is beginning to flow past each of the airplaneâs wings. When this
moving air encounters the wingâs leading edge, it separates into two airstreams: one traveling over the wing and the other under it (Fig. 6.3.1). These airstreams continue onward until
they leave the wingâs trailing edge. Since the airplaneâs nose is still on the ground, the wing
is essentially horizontal and the airflow around it is simple and symmetrical.
Since the wing isnât deflecting the airflow yet, itâs experiencing no lift, only drag.
However, while this drag pushes the airplane downwind, opposite its forward motion along

deflect the airflow, it experiences no lift.

the runway, the effect is weak. The wing produces almost no turbulent wake and thus experiences almost no pressure drag. What little drag it does experience is mostly viscous drag,
essentially surface friction with the passing air.
Although the wingâs near lack of air resistance should surprise you, you probably take
it for granted. Thatâs because youâve often observed that such âstreamlinedâ objects cut
through the air particularly well. Having a long, tapered tail allows the wing to avoid the
flow separation and turbulent wake that occur behind an unstreamlined ball.
What makes the horizontal wing streamlined is the extremely gradual rise in air pressure after its widest point. Although this gently rising pressure pushes the wingâs boundary
layer backward, opposite the direction of flow, the force it exerts is so weak that the layer
doesnât stall. Driven onward by viscous forces from the freely flowing airstream, the wingâs
boundary layer manages to keep moving forward all the way to the wingâs trailing edge and
never triggers flow separation. The wing produces almost no turbulent wake and experiences almost no pressure drag.
Check Your Understanding #1: Slicing through the Air
The fastest bicycles are those with fairings, streamlined shells that reduce air resistance dramatically. How do those fairings work?
Answer: A fairing delays airstream separation in the airflow around a bicycle and thereby reduces
pressure drag.
Why: Without a fairing, a bicycle racer must struggle against severe pressure drag. The sharply rising
pressure gradients that follow wide parts of his body trigger flow separation, and he develops a huge
turbulent wake. A fairing makes the vehicle streamlined; the gently rising pressure gradient following
its widest part doesnât trigger flow separation.

Airplane Wings: Producing Lift
With so little air resistance, the airplane accelerates forward rapidly and soon reaches takeoff speed. The pilot then raises the airplaneâs nose so that its wings are no longer horizontal,
and they begin to experience upward lift forces. The airplaneâs total lift soon exceeds its
weight, and it begins to accelerate upward into the air. The airplane is flying!
Letâs take a closer look at the moment of takeoff. If you could see the airflow and were
paying close attention, youâd notice a remarkable sequence of events that begins when the
wings tilt upward.

Fig. 6.3.2 (a) Although this wingâs leading edge has been tipped upward, giving it a positive angle
of attack, the airflow around it is relatively symmetric and produces no lift. (b) The kink at the trailing
edge of the wing is unstable and is blown away or shed as a horizontal vortex. (c) The resulting airflow
is deflected downward and the wing experiences an upward lift force.

At first, the airflow around the tilted wings continues to travel horizontally on average,
although it develops a peculiar shape (Fig. 6.3.2a). The two airstreams, one over the tilted wing
and one under it, each bend twiceâonce up and once down. As we saw while studying balls,
when an airstream bends toward the wing, the pressure near the wing is less than atmospheric
and when an airstream bends away from the wing, the pressure near the wing is greater than
atmospheric. Since each airstream bends equally toward and away from the wing, the average
pressures above and below the wing are equal and the wing experiences no lift.
The lower airstream, however, is making a sharp bend around the wingâs trailing edge,
essentially an upward kink. Airâs inertia makes such a kink unstable, and it soon blows
away from the wingâs trailing edge as a swirling horizontal vortex of air (Fig. 6.3.2b). After
shedding that vortex, the wing establishes a new, stable flow pattern in which both airstreams glide smoothly away from the wingâs trailing edge (Fig. 6.3.2c), a situation named
the Kutta condition after the German mathematician M. Wilhelm Kutta (1867â1944).
In this new pattern, the airstream flowing over the wing is longer than the airstream
flowing under it and both airstreams bend downward (Fig. 6.3.3). The upper airstream bends
primarily toward the wing, so the airâs pressure just above the wing is less than atmospheric
(a shift toward red) and its speed is increased (narrowly spaced streamlines). In contrast, the
lower airstream bends primarily away from the wing, so the airâs pressure just below the
wing is greater than atmospheric (a shift toward violet) and its speed is decreased (widely
spaced streamlines). The air pressure is now higher under the wing than over it, so this new
flow pattern produces upward lift. The air now supports your plane and up you go.
Another way to think about this lift is as a deflection of the airflow. Air approaches the
wing horizontally but leaves heading somewhat downward. To cause this deflection, the
wing must push the airflow downward. In reaction, the airflow pushes the wing upward and
produces lift. In other words, the wing transfers downward momentum to the air and is left
with upward momentum. These two explanations for liftâthe Bernoullian view that lift is
caused by a pressure difference above and below the wing, and the Newtonian view that lift
is caused by a transfer of momentum to the airâare perfectly equivalent and equally valid.
However, the overall aerodynamic force on the wing isnât quite perpendicular to the
onrushing air; it tilts slightly downwind. The perpendicular component of this aerodynamic force is lift, but the downwind component is a new type of drag forceâinduced
drag. Induced drag is a consequence of energy conservation; in addition to transferring
momentum to the passing air, the wing also transfers some energy to it. The air extracts
that energy from the wing by pushing the wing downwind with induced drag and thereby
doing negative work on it. Since induced drag is undesirable, the airplane minimizes it by
using as much air mass as possible to obtain its lift. A larger mass of air carries away the

airplaneâs unwanted downward momentum while moving downward less quickly and
with less kinetic energy. Since larger wings obtain their lift from larger air masses, they
experience less induced drag.
Unfortunately, larger wings also have more surface area and experience more viscous
drag, so bigger isnât always better. Also, because wing shape and airspeed affect aerodynamic forces, too, wings must be carefully matched to their airplanes. Small propeller airplanes that move slowly through the air need relatively large, highly curved wings to support them. Those wings are often asymmetricalâmore curved on top than on bottom to
make maximum use of the limited, low-speed air they encounter each second. Commercial
and military jets fly faster and encounter far more high-speed air each second, so they can
get by with relatively small, moderately curved wings.
Even at constant airspeed, a wingâs lift can be adjusted by varying its angle of attack,
the angle at which it approaches the onrushing air. The larger the angle of attack, the more
the two airstreams bend and the greater the wingâs lift. Because the wings are rigidly attached
to the plane, the pilot has no choice but to tip the entire plane to adjust its lift. The pilot tips
the nose of the plane upward to increase the lift and downward to reduce the lift. Thatâs why
raising the planeâs nose during takeoff is what finally makes the plane leap up into the air.
Since lift depends so strongly on a wingâs angle of attack, some planes can be flown
upside down. As long as the inverted wing is tilted properly, it obtains upward lift and supports the plane. This feat is easiest when a planeâs wing has the same curvature, top and
bottom. Thatâs why stunt fliers who regularly fly upside down often use sport aircraft that
have symmetrical or nearly symmetrical wings.
When a plane is in level flight through calm air, the wingâs angle of attack is simply its
angle above horizontal (Fig. 6.3.4a). As viewed from the planeâs inertial frame of reference,
the airâs velocity is directed horizontally toward the plane and acts as a horizontal virtual
wind as it approaches the wings. The angle of attack is measured relative to that virtual wind.
When the plane is not in level flight or when the air itself is moving up or down, however, the virtual wind is no longer horizontal. While descending or flying through rising air,
the plane encounters a rising virtual windâthe onrushing airâs velocity is tilted upward (Fig.
6.3.4b). The wingâs angle of attack, still measured relative to that virtual wind, is greater
than its angle above horizontal and its lift increases. While ascending or flying through

descending air, the plane encounters a descending virtual windâthe onrushing airâs velocity
is tilted downward (Fig. 6.3.4c). The wingâs angle of attack is less than its angle above horizontal and its lift decreases. When a plane flies through bad weather, with air that is moving
alternately up and down, the rapid changes in virtual wind direction lead to fluctuations in
lift and exciting accelerations. No wonder there are air sickness bags in the seat pockets.
Check Your Understanding #2: Blowing in the Wind
The sail of a small sailboat bows forward and outward so that wind traveling around the sailâs outside
surface bends toward the sail, while wind traveling across its inside surface bends away from the sail.
How does this arrangement propel the sailboat across the water?
Answer: The air traveling around the outside of the sail has a lower pressure than that traveling across
the inside of the sail. The sail experiences a lift force that pushes it and the boat across the water.
Why: Sails experience both lift and drag forces. The sail experiences an aerodynamic force that
pushes it outward (lift) and slightly downwind (drag) just as an airplane wing experiences an aerodynamic force upward (lift) and slightly downwind (drag). The sailboatâs keel, or centerboard, and its
rudder provide additional forces so that the net force on the sailboat can be controlled and it can
travel in a variety of directions.

Lift Has Its Limits: Stalling a Wing
Thereâs a limit to how much lift the pilot can obtain by increasing the wingâs angle of attack
because tilting the wing gradually transforms it from streamlined to bluntâthat is, to having a rapid rise in air pressure after its widest point. As we saw for balls, blunt objects
generally experience airflow separation and pressure drag. Indeed, beyond a certain angle
of attack, the airstream over the top of a wing separates from its surface and the wing stalls.
This separation starts when air in the upper boundary layer is brought to a standstill by the
rapidly rising pressure beyond the wingâs widest point. Once this boundary layer stalls, it
shaves most of the airstream away from the wingâs upper surface.
The separated airstream over the top of the stalled wing leaves a billowing storm of
turbulence beneath it (Fig. 6.3.5). This airstream separation is an aerodynamic catastrophe

for the airplane. Because the average pressure above the wing increases, the wing loses
much of its lift. Also, the appearance of a turbulent wake heralds the arrival of severe pressure drag. The plane slows dramatically and begins to fall.
To avoid stalling, pilots keep the angle of attack within a safe range. The possibility of
stalling also limits the minimum speed at which the airplane will fly. As the airplane slows
down, the pilot must increase its angle of attack to maintain adequate lift. Below a certain
speed, the airplane canât obtain that lift without tilting its wings until they stall. It can no
longer fly.
To avoid stalling, a plane must never fly slower than this minimum speed, particularly
during landings and takeoffs. For a small, propeller-driven plane with highly curved wings,
the minimum flight speed is so low that itâs rarely an issue. For a commercial jet, however,
the minimum airspeed is about 220 km/h (140 mph). Airplanes taking off or landing this
fast would require very long runways on which to build up or get rid of speed. Instead,
commercial jets have wings that can change shape during flight. Slats move forward and
down from the leading edges of the wings, and flaps move back and down from the trailing
edges (Fig. 6.3.6). With both slats and flaps extended, the wing becomes larger and more
curved, similar to the wings of a small propeller plane, and the minimum safe airspeed
drops to a reasonable 150 km/h (95 mph). Vanes near the flaps also emerge during landings
to direct high-energy air from beneath the wings onto the flaps. These jets of air keep the
boundary layers moving downstream and help prevent stalling. (For another approach to
stall prevention, see 6 ).
Once a commercial jet lands, flat panels on the top surfaces of its wings are tilted
upward and cause the airflow to separate from the tops of the wings. The resulting
turbulence created by these spoilers reduces the lift of the wings and increases their
drag so the plane doesnât accidentally start flying again. Even before landing, the
spoilers are sometimes used to slow the plane and help it descend rapidly toward an
airport.
In flight, a wing does more than just push the passing air downward; it also twists the
air near its tip. Since the air pressure below the wing is greater than the air pressure above
it, air tends to flow around the wingâs tip from bottom to top. The plane soon leaves this
air behind, but not before the air has acquired lots of angular momentum and kinetic
energy.
A swirling vortex thus emerges from each wingtip and trails behind the plane for several kilometers, like an invisible tornado. You can occasionally see them behind a plane
thatâs landing or taking off in humid air. A wingtip vortex from a jumbo jet can flip over a
small aircraft that flies through it or give passengers in a much larger plane an unexpected
thrill. Entered from behind, one of these vortices feels like a horizontal blender; from the
side, it feels like a speed hump that you might drive over in a car.
For safety, air traffic controllers are careful to keep planes from flying through one
anotherâs wakes and schedule them at least 90 seconds apart on runways. Many modern
airplanes have vertical wingtip extensions that reduce these vortices, both to save energy
and to diminish the hazard (Fig. 6.3.7).

Check Your Understanding #3: Stunt Flying
A pilot normally tips the planeâs nose upward to gain altitude. If the pilot tries to make the plane rise
too quickly, the plane will suddenly begin to drop. What is happening?
Answer: The planeâs wings are stalling.
Why: Tipping the planeâs nose upward increases the wingsâ angle of attack. While this action increases
lift up to a point, it can also cause the airflow to separate from the top surface of the wing. The
sudden reduction in lift and increase in drag that accompany stalling can cause the plane to drop. A
stall during takeoff or landing is extremely dangerous.

energy and are hazardous for
other aircraft.

Propellers
For a plane to obtain lift, it needs airspeed; air must flow across its wings. And since drag
forces push it downwind, a plane in level flight canât maintain its airspeed unless something
pushes it upwind. Thatâs why a plane has propellers or jet engines, to push the air backward
so that the air pushes the plane forwardâaction and reaction.
A propeller is an assembly of rotating wings. Extending from its central hub are two
or more blades that together form a sophisticated fan (Fig. 6.3.8). These blades have airfoil
cross sections and are designed to create forward lift forces when the propeller turns and
the blades move through the air.
As a propeller blade slices through the air, the airstreams bending around that blade
experience pressure variations (Fig. 6.3.9). The forward airstream bends toward the bladeâs
front surface, so the pressure in front of the blade drops below atmospheric. The rearward
airstream bends away from the bladeâs rear surface, so the pressure behind the blade rises
above atmospheric. The resulting pressure difference produces a forward force on the blade
and propeller, a thrust force.
The propeller blades have all the features, good and bad, of airplane wings. Their
thrust increases with size, front-surface curvature, pitch (that is, angle of attack), and
airspeed; in other words, the larger the propeller, the faster it turns, and the more its
blades are angled into the wind, the more thrust it produces. The blades themselves have
a twisted shape to accommodate the variations in airspeed along their lengths, from hub
to tip.
Like a wing, a propeller stalls when the airflow separates from the front surfaces of
its blades; it suddenly becomes more of an air mixer than a propeller. This stalled-wing

it (right). The blade experiences a lift force that pushes the propeller

rotation of the propeller.

accomplished aerodynamicists, using
this wind tunnel to study and perfect
wings and propellers for their airplanes.

8 In addition to achieving
the first self-propelled
flight of an airplane in
1903, Orville (1871â1948)
and Wilbur (1867â1912)
Wright (American
aviators) were exceptionally accomplished
aerodynamicists. In 1902,
Wilbur was the first
person to recognize that a
propeller is actually a
rotating wing. Propellers
up until his time were
little more than rotating
paddles, more effective at
stirring the air than
propelling the plane.

for a decade.

behavior was the standard operating condition for air and marine propellers (see 7 ) before
the work of Wilbur Wright in 1902 (see 8 ). The Wrights were among the first people to
study aerodynamics using a wind tunnel (Fig. 6.3.10), and their methodical and scientific
approach to aeronautics allowed them to achieve the first powered flight (Fig. 6.3.11).
Since the Wrightsâ work, propellers have experienced almost no pressure drag.
A propeller does, however, experience induced drag. As the propellerâs thrust pushes
the plane through the air, induced drag extracts energy from the propeller. To keep the propeller turning steadily, an engine must do work on the propeller. Propellers are driven by
high-performance reciprocating (piston-based) engines, like those found in automobiles, or
by the turbojet engines that weâll discuss later.
Propellers arenât perfect; they have three serious limitations. First, a propeller exerts a
torque on the passing air, so that air exerts a torque on the propeller. This reaction torque
can flip a small plane. To minimize torque problems, some planes use pairs of oppositely
turning propellers and single-propeller planes usually locate their propellers in front so that
the spinning air can return angular momentum to them while passing over their wings.
A second problem with a propeller is that its thrust diminishes as the planeâs forward
speed increases. When the airplane is stationary, a propeller blade moves through motionless air (Fig. 6.3.12a). When the airplane is traveling fast, though, the air approaches that
same propeller blade from the front of the plane (Fig. 6.3.12b). To retain its thrust at higher
airspeeds, the propeller blade must increase its pitchâthat is, its angle of attack. It must
swivel forward to meet the onrushing air.

powered flight began at 10:35
a.m. on Dec. 17, 1903, when
the Wright Flyer lifted Orville
Wright into the air over Kitty
Hawk, North Carolina. His

7 One of the principal
sources of noise in
submarines is the
turbulence created by their
propellers. To reduce this
turbulence, the propellers
of modern nuclear
submarines are designed
to avoid water flow
separation and stalling.

Airplanes

The third and most discouraging problem with propellers, especially in high-speed
aircraft, is drag. To keep up with the onrushing air at high airspeeds, the propellers must
turn at phenomenal rates. The tips of the blades must travel so fast that they exceed the
speed of sound, the fastest speed at which a fluid such as air can convey forces from one
place to another. When the blade tip exceeds this speed, the air near the tip doesnât accelerate
until the tip actually hits it. Instead of flowing smoothly around the tip, the air forms a
shock wave, a narrow region of high pressure and temperature caused by the supersonic
impact, and the propeller stalls. Thatâs why propellers arenât useful on high-speed aircraft.

Answer: The inlet side of each fan blade experiences the lowest air pressure.

Why: Air blowing toward you from a fan is like the air blown back by a propeller. The lowest pressures
experienced by a propeller are on its forward surfaces. Similarly, the lowest pressures experienced by
a fan are on its inlet side surfaces. This pressure imbalance pushes the fan away from you while the
fan pushes the air toward you.

Jet Engines
Unlike propellers, jet engines work well at high speeds. While a propeller tries to operate
directly in the high-speed air approaching the plane, a jet engine first slows this air down to
a manageable speed. To achieve this change in speeds, the jet engine makes wonderful use
of the energy transformations allowed by Bernoulliâs equation. Strictly speaking, Bernoulliâs
equation applies only to incompressible fluids such as water. Nonetheless, itâs often usable
for compressible fluids such as air, especially when the speed and pressure variations are
relatively small.
A turbojet engine is depicted in Fig. 6.3.13. During flight, air rushes into the engineâs
inlet duct or diffuser at about 800 km/h (500 mph), the airspeed of the plane. Once inside
that diffuser, the air slows down and its pressure increases, leaving its ordered energy
unchanged. The air then passes through a series of fanlike compressor blades that push it
deeper into the engine, doing work on it and increasing both its pressure and its ordered
energy. By the time the air arrives at the combustion chamber, its pressure is many times
atmospheric.

9 Ramjets are jet engines
that have no moving parts.
Air that approaches the
engine at supersonic
speeds interacts with
carefully tapered surfaces
so that its own forward
momentum compresses it
to high density. The
engine then adds fuel to
this pressurized air, ignites
the mixture, and allows
the hot burned gas to
expand out of a nozzle.
The engine pushes this
exhaust backward, and the
exhaust propels the engine
and airplane forward.
Although the air enters the
engine at supersonic
speeds, it passes through
the combustion chamber
much more slowly. In a
supersonic combustion
ramjet, or âscramjet,â the
fuel and air mixture flows
through the combustion
chamber at supersonic
speeds. This motion
makes it extremely
difficult to keep the fuel
burning because the flame
tends to flow downstream
and out of the engine. The
flame canât advance
through the mixture faster
than the speed of sound,
so it wonât spread
upstream fast enough to
stay in the engine on its
own.

Fig. 6.3.14 The turbofan engine adds a giant fan to the shaft of a normal turbojet engine. Most of
the air passing through the fan bypasses the turbojet and returns directly to the airstream around the
engine. Because the fan does work on this air, it leaves the engine at a higher speed than it had when
it arrived. The air has transferred forward momentum to the engine and the plane.

Now fuel is added to the air, and the mixture is ignited. The pressure of this gaseous
mixture doesnât increase as it burns; instead, it expands to occupy more volume. Furthermore, combustion subdivides the fuel molecules into smaller pieces that, therefore, take up
still more volume. This extremely hot, high-pressure exhaust gas pours out of the combustion chamber through a wider channel than the one it entered.
The exhaust gas then streams through windmill-like turbine, doing work on that turbine and thereby powering the compressor for the incoming air. After the turbine, the still
high-pressure gas finally accelerates and expands through the engineâs outlet nozzle and
emerges into the open sky at atmospheric pressure, moderately high temperature, and
extraordinarily high speed.
Overall, the engine slows the air down, adds energy to it, and then lets it accelerate back
to high speed. Because the engine has added energy to the air, the air leaves the engine traveling faster than when it arrived. The airâs increased backward velocity means that the jet
engine has pushed it backward and the air has reacted by exerting a forward thrust force on
the jet engine. In other words, the airplane has obtained forward momentum by giving the
departing air backward momentum.
The turbojet is less energy efficient than it could be. Since it gives backward momentum to a relatively small mass of air, that air ends up traveling overly fast and with excessive kinetic energy. To make the engine more efficient, it should give backward momentum
to a larger mass of air.
The turbofan engine solves this problem by using a turbojet engine to spin a huge fan
(Fig. 6.3.14). Since this fan is located in the engineâs inlet duct, the airâs speed decreases
and its pressure increases before it enters the fan. The fan then does work on the air and
further increases its pressure. While about 5% of this air then enters the turbojet engine, the
vast majority of it accelerates out the back of the fan duct and emerges into the open sky at
atmospheric pressure and increased speed. Overall, the fan has pushed the air backward
and the air has pushed the fan forward, producing forward thrust.
Like a turbojet, the turbofan slows air down, adds energy to it, and then lets it accelerate
back to high speed. However, because the turbofan engine moves more air than a turbojet
engine, it gives that air less energy and uses less fuel. Because of their increased efficiency,
turbofans are used in all modern commercial jets. (For another type of jet engine, see 9 .)

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations

Check Your Understanding #5: Energy and a Jet Engine
A jet engine somehow slows the air down, adds energy to it at low speed, and then returns the air to
high speed. Why doesnât slowing the air down waste lots of energy?
Answer: As the air is slowed down, its pressure increases. The airâs ordered energy remains constant.
Why: The remarkable result of Bernoulliâs effect is that you can slow the air down without squandering its kinetic energy. That energy becomes pressure potential energy, and it passes through the jet
engine in that form. As the air leaves the jet engine, its pressure potential energy becomes kinetic
energy once again, so no energy is wasted.

Epilogue for Chapter 6
In this chapter, we have looked at a number of objects that use moving fluids to perform
their tasks. In Garden Watering, we saw how water moves through openings and channels.
We looked at the effects of viscosity and the importance of Bernoulliâs equation in describing the conversion of pressure potential energy into kinetic energy and vice versa. Two
types of fluid flow appeared: laminar and turbulent. While laminar flow is smooth and
predictable, turbulent flow involves unpredictability and chaos, a common behavior in our
complicated universe.
In the section on Ball Sports: Air, we examined the ways in which moving air exerts
forces on larger objects, both in the downstream direction as drag and in a perpendicular
direction as lift. We learned about two different types of drag forces and how these can be
controlled or reduced by choosing the shapes or motions of the balls.
Finally, in Airplanes, we explored the aerodynamics of those remarkable machines.
We saw how they use air to support and propel themselves. We also examined the limitations of wings and saw what can go wrong if those limitations are exceeded. We studied
propulsion in propeller planes and in jet aircraft, and saw that these systems involve
Bernoulliâs equation and the forward force that comes from pushing air backward.

Explanation: A Vortex Cannon
The vortex cannon creates ring vortices, tiny tornadoes that are bent into loops and so have
no beginnings or ends. Air swirls forward in the middle of each ring and backward on its
outer edge. This circular tornado structure is created when air flows through the hole of the
vortex cannon. Air flows forward in the middle of the hole, while the holeâs edges create
the backward flow around the outside of the ring. After it leaves the cannon, each ring vortex crawls forward through the surrounding air until its kinetic energy has been exhausted
and it slows to a stop. It finishes its existence swirling in place until viscous forces bring its
moving air to rest.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Garden Watering Works: As water flows through a hose, viscous forces in the hose limit
its speed, particularly near the walls of the hose. Each time the hose bends, the water pressure rises on the outside of the bend and drops on the inside of the bend. When the water
reaches the nozzle, it accelerates through the narrow opening, increasing in speed and
decreasing in pressure until it emerges at atmospheric pressure and arcs gracefully into the
garden. Whenever the water flows rapidly around obstacles, both in the garden and at the
faucet leading the hose, the flow becomes turbulent and noisy.
How Balls and Air Work: A ball traveling through the air experiences two major types of
aerodynamic force: drag and lift. For a nonspinning ball traveling very slowly, the only drag

171

172

CHAPT ER 6 Fluids and Motion

force is viscous drag; it experiences no lift force. As the ballâs speed through the air increases, a large turbulent wake appears behind the ball and the ball experiences pressure
drag. At a still higher speed, the boundary layer of air near the ballâs surface becomes turbulent and the size of the wake behind the ball shrinks. A ball with a turbulent boundary layer
experiences less drag than one with a laminar boundary layer, which is why some balls are
designed to encourage turbulent boundary layers.
Rotating balls experience lift forces. These forces occur because bending and deflecting
airstreams push asymmetrically on these balls. Lift forces can cause a ball to curve in flight
or take surprisingly long to fall.
How Airplanes Work: An airplane is supported in flight by air passing across its wings. Air
bending toward the top surface of a wing experiences a drop in pressure, while air bending
away from the bottom surface of a wing experiences a rise in pressure. As a result of this
pressure difference, the wing experiences an upward lift force. The airplane also experiences
drag, which tends to slow it down. To keep the airplane moving forward, the plane employs
propellers or jet engines. These devices push the air backward, and the air reacts by pushing
them forward. A propeller works directly in the oncoming air, increasing the airâs energy and
pushing it backward with rotating blades. A jet engine first slows the air, then increases its
energy by burning fuel in it, and finally lets it accelerate backward to high speed.

Heat and Phase Transitions

e canât see all the motion that takes place around us. Some of it is hidden deep inside each
object, where thermal energy keeps the individual atoms and molecules jiggling back and
forth in an endless flurry of activity. Weâre usually aware of this thermal energy only because
it determines an objectâs temperature; the more thermal energy an object contains, the higher its
temperature and the hotter it feels.
Nevertheless, thermal energy plays an important role in everyday life. In addition to moving
from one place to another, thermal energy can transform a substance from a solid to a liquid to a
gas. What youâre feeling when you touch a hot object is actually its thermal energy flowing into your
comparatively colder hand and raising the temperature of your skin. When thermal energy is flowing
in this manner, from a hotter object to a colder one, we call it heat. In this chapter, we examine
temperature, heat, and the phases of matter to understand more about our hot and cold world.

A Ruler Thermometer

One effect that a change in temperature has on a typical
object is to change its size. Although this size change is
tiny and easily overlooked, you can use mechanical
advantage to make it quite visible. Hereâs how to make
a size-change thermometer using only a clear plastic
ruler, a pin, a small weight, a piece of stiff paper, and
some tape.
Lay the plastic ruler along the edge of a table and
tape one end of it securely to the table. Cut a thin strip of
stiff paper, about 3 mm (0.1 in) wide and 15 cm (6 in)
long, and push the pin carefully through one end of the
strip. Use a dot of tape to stick the pinâs head to the paper.
When youâre done, the paper strip should be securely
attached to the pin so that as the pin turns, the strip turns.
This strip is your thermometerâs pointer.
Now slide the pin under the free end of the ruler, and
place the small weight above it. The weight is there to
push the ruler and pin together so they experience plenty

of static friction. That way, as the free end of the ruler
moves left or right, the pin will rotate and turn the pointer.
Your thermometer is now complete. If you turn the
pin and pointer carefully by hand so that the pointer is
horizontal, you can âreadâ the thermometer by its angle
relative to the tabletop. If you heat the plastic ruler by
breathing on it, laying your hands on it, or warming
it gently with a hair dryer, the ruler will become longer.
Its free end will move away from its fixed end and will
cause the pin to rotate. You will see a small change in the
pointerâs orientation as your thermometer reports its new
temperature.
You can also make the needle turn the other way by
cooling the ruler. If you place a few ice cubes on the ruler,
the ruler will contract and the needle will turn in the
opposite direction. As you can see, the ruler is slightly
shorter on a cold day than on a hot one, a fact that limits
the rulerâs accuracy in measuring distance.

Winter would be pretty unpleasant for most of us were it not for
heating. Heating keeps our rooms warm even when the weather
outside is cold. One of the most fashionable types of heating is
a woodstove, which burns logs in its firebox and sends thermal
energy out into the room. In this section, weâll look at how a
woodstove produces thermal energy and how this thermal
energy flows out of the stove to keep us warm.
Questions to Think About: What happens to the chemical
potential energy in a log when you burn it? Why do you get

Experiments to Do: A burning candle produces thermal
energy, providing both light and warmth to a small room.
Where does this thermal energy come from and how does it
flow into its surroundings?
Light a short candle and look first at how it releases
thermal energy. The flame slowly consumes the wax, but it
also needs air. Cover the candle with a tall glass, one that
wonât be touched or damaged by the flame. The glass should
prevent room air from reaching the candle. How does the
newly sealed environment affect the candle flame? Try to
explain this result.
Relight the candle and consider the ways in which heat
flows from the flame to you. Carefully pass your hand over the
flame, keeping a safe distance above it to avoid being burned.
Why does the flame warm your skin so quickly when your hand
is directly above it? Now hold your hand beside the flame at a
safe distance. You should again feel warmth from the flame.
How is heat flowing from the flame to your hand now?
Take a wooden pencil and hold it a few centimeters above
the flame for no more than 2 seconds. Then carefully touch the
pencilâs surface with your fingers. It should warm your fingers.
How is heat flowing from the pencil to your hand in this case?
Why would it be a painful mistake to try this experiment with a
metal pencil? Why should you hold it above the flame for only
2 seconds?

A Burning Log: Thermal Energy
A woodstove produces thermal energy and distributes it as heat to the surrounding room
(Fig. 7.1.1). Weâve encountered thermal energy before: in a file cabinet sliding along the
sidewalk, in an old tennis ball bouncing inefficiently off the floor, and in honey pouring
slowly from a jar. In each case, ordered energyâenergy that could easily be used to do
workâbecame disordered thermal energy and the temperatures of the objects increased.
Now that weâre going to study devices that are intended to provide heat, letâs reexamine
thermal energy and temperature to see how thermal energy moves from one object to another.

Woodstoves

When you burn a log in the fireplace or woodstove, youâre turning the logâs ordered
chemical potential energy into disordered thermal energyâenergy contained in the kinetic
and potential energies of individual atoms and molecules. The presence of thermal energy
in the log, the woodstove, or the room air is what gives it a temperature; the more thermal
energy it has, the higher its temperature.
The nature of thermal energy depends somewhat on what itâs in. In the hot burning log,
thermal energy is mostly in the woodâs atoms and molecules, which jitter back and forth
rapidly relative to one another. When each of these particles moves, it has kinetic energy.
When it pushes or pulls on its neighbors, it has potential energy.
In the air near the burning log, thermal energy is again mostly in the atoms and molecules. However, since those particles are essentially free and independent, most of this
thermal energy is kinetic energy. The air particles store potential energy only during the
brief moments when they collide with one another.
In the metal poker that you use to stir the fire, thermal energy is not only in the atoms
and molecules but also in the mobile electrons that move about the metal and allow it to
conduct electricity. As I noted in Chapter 2, thermal energy is the portion of internal energy
thatâs associated with temperature. Internal energy excludes any energy due to external
forces or overall motion, so lifting the poker to increase its gravitational potential energy or
waving it to increase its kinetic energy does not affect either its internal energy or its thermal energy. Furthermore, some of the pokerâs internal energy, including most of its chemical and nuclear potential energy, is not associated with temperature and is not part of its
thermal energy.

If you drop a ball, will its thermal energy increase as it falls? (Neglect air resistance.)

forces

Answer: No, its thermal energy will remain constant.
Why: As it falls, the ballâs gravitational potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. However,
both energies enable the ball to do work, so they arenât included in its thermal energy.

(b)

Forces between Atoms: Chemical Bonds
To understand how a burning log produces thermal energy, letâs take a look at bonds
between atoms and the chemical potential energy thatâs stored in those bonds. Since both
result from the forces between atoms, thatâs where weâll begin.
As you bring two atoms close together, they exert attractive forces on one another (Fig.
7.1.2a). These chemical forces are primarily electromagnetic in origin and grow stronger
as the atoms approach. The attraction diminishes, however, when the atoms start to touch
and is eventually replaced by repulsion when the atoms are too close (Fig. 7.1.2b). The
separation between atoms at which the attraction ends and the repulsion begins is their
equilibrium separationâthat is, the separation at which the atoms exert no forces on one
another (Fig. 7.1.2c). Since atoms are tiny, this equilibrium separation is also tiny, typically
only about a ten-billionth of a meter.
Imagine holding two atoms in tweezers and slowly bringing them together. They pull
toward one another as they approach, doing work on you and increasing your energy. Since
energy is conserved, their energy must be decreasing. Theyâre giving up chemical potential energy, energy stored in the chemical forces between atoms.
Once the atoms reach their equilibrium separation, you can let go of them and they
wonât come apart. Since theyâve given up some of their chemical potential energy,
they canât separate unless that energy is returned to them; it takes work to drag them
apart. Without that energy, the atoms are held together by an energy debt known as a
chemical bond.

CHAPT ER 7 Heat and Phase Transitions

The bound atoms have become a molecule. The strength of their bond is equal to the
amount of work the atoms did when they drew together or, equivalently, the work required
to separate them. Bond strengths range from extremely strong in the case of two nitrogen
atoms to extremely weak in the case of two neon atoms.
If they have a little extra energy, bound atoms can vibrate back and forth about their
equilibrium separation (Fig. 7.1.2d). Whenever the atoms are moving quickly toward or
away from one another, most of their energy is kinetic. Whenever the atoms are traveling
slowly while turning around, most of their energy is chemical potential. Overall, the moleculeâs total energy remains constant, and it vibrates back and forth until it transfers its extra
energy elsewhere.
Many molecules have more than two atoms. In a large molecule, many pairs of atoms
have chemical bonds and equilibrium separations. If you give this molecule excess energy,
it will vibrate in a complicated manner as the energy moves among the various atoms and
chemical bonds. The atoms in the molecule will continue to jiggle until something removes
the excess energy from the molecule.
Like all liquids and solids, our burning log is just a huge assembly of atoms and molecules, held together by chemical bonds of various strengths. These particles push and pull
on one another as they vibrate about their equilibrium separations. Their motion is thermal
motion, and the energy involved in this disorderly jiggling is thermal energy. Because thermal energy is fragmented among the atoms and exchanged between them unpredictably, it
canât be used directly to do work.
Check Your Understanding #2: When Atoms Collide . . .
As two independent nitrogen atoms collide with one another, what forces do they experience?
Answer: At first, the atoms experience attractive forces. When the atoms come too close, the forces
become repulsive and they bounce. As they subsequently separate, the forces again become attractive.
Why: As they approach one another, the two nitrogen atoms experience attractive forces and a chemical bond begins to form between them. They accelerate toward one another, converting chemical
potential energy into kinetic energy. However, when they are very close together, the forces become
repulsive and they bounce off one another. They head apart and the forces again become attractive,
but their kinetic energy breaks the bond and they separate forever.

Heat and Temperature
Everything contains thermal energy, from the hot burning log to the cold metal poker you
use to stir the fire. However, that doesnât mean that the thermal energy is equitably distributed. What happens to thermal energy when you push the log with the poker?
When they touch, the poker and the log begin to exchange thermal energy. In effect,
the two objects become one larger object, and thermal energy that has been moving
about randomly among the particles in each individual object begins to move about
randomly among the particles of both objects. Well, not quite randomly. Although tiny
portions of thermal energy move in both directions between the two objects, those
exchanges donât cancel. Overall, there is a net flow of thermal energy from the hot log
to the cold poker.
To allow us to predict the direction of this flow, we define a temperature for each of
the objects. Their temperatures indicate which way, if any, thermal energy will naturally
flow between two objects. If no thermal energy flows when two objects touch, then
those objects are in thermal equilibrium and their temperatures are equal. But if thermal energy flows from the first object to the second, then the first object is hotter than
the second.
A temperature scale classifies objects according to which way thermal energy will
flow between any pair. An object with a hotter temperature will always transfer thermal

Woodstoves

energy to an object with a colder temperature, and two objects with the same temperature
will always be in thermal equilibrium. Thus the hot burning log will transfer thermal energy
to the cold poker. We say that the burning log is hot because it tends to transfer thermal
energy to most objects, while the poker is cold because most objects tend to transfer thermal energy to it.
Energy that flows from one object to another because of a difference in their temperatures is called heat. Heat is thermal energy on the move. Strictly speaking, the burning log
doesnât contain heat; it contains thermal energy. However, when that log transfers energy
to the cold poker because of their temperature difference, itâs heat that flows from the log
to the poker. (For a historical note about the understanding of heat, see 1 .)
Our present definition of temperature can order the objects around us from hottest to
coldest, but it doesnât quantify temperature in any unique way. You could make your own
temperature scale by comparing every pair of objects to see which way heat flows between
them, but you probably wouldnât enjoy it. You would do better with a standard temperature
scale such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin.
Standard temperature scales are based on an objectâs average thermal kinetic energy
per atom. The more kinetic energy each atom has, on average, the more vigorous the
objectâs thermal motion and the more thermal energy it transfers to the atoms in a second
object by way of microscopic portions of work. Microscopic work is what actually passes
heat between objectsâa teeny shove here, a tiny yank there, all at the atomic scale. Since
an object with more average thermal kinetic energy per atom will pass heat to an object
with less, it makes sense to assign temperatures according to average thermal kinetic energies per atom.
The Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales all measure temperature in this manner.
In each scale, a 1-degree, or unit, increase in temperature reflects a specific increase in
average thermal kinetic energy per atom. The relationship between average thermal kinetic
energy per atom and assigned temperature is based on several standard conditions: absolute
zero, waterâs freezing temperature, and waterâs boiling temperature. (Recall from Section
5.1 that absolute zero is the temperature at which all thermal energy has been removed
from an object.) Once specific temperatures have been assigned to two of these standard
conditions, the whole temperature scale is fixed. For example, the Celsius scale is built
around 0 Â°C being waterâs freezing temperature and 100 Â°C being waterâs boiling temperature. Temperatures for the three standard conditions appear in Table 7.1.1.

If you pick up an ice cube, your hand suddenly feels cold. Which way is heat flowing?
Answer: From your hotter hand to the colder ice cube.
Why: Heat naturally flows from a hotter object to a colder object. Since the ice cube is colder
than your hand, heat flows out of your hand and into the ice cube. Since your hand is losing
thermal energy, its temperature drops and you sense cold. Although itâs tempting to think of
cold as something that flows out of an ice cube, the only thing that really moves about is heat.
Ice cubes are wonderful absorbers of heat and cool our drinks by reducing the drinksâ thermal
energies.

1 Before the time of
Benjamin Thompson, Count
Rumford (American-born
British physicist and
statesman, 1753â1814),
heat was believed to be a
fluid called caloric that
was contained within
objects. Thompson
disproved the caloric
theory by showing that the
boring of cannons
produced an inexhaustible
supply of heat. Among his
scientific and technological contributions,
Thompson improved
cooking and heating
methods. He reshaped
fireplaces and developed
the damper as ways to
reduce smoking and
improve heat transfer to
the room. Thompson also
had a life of sensational
escapades and great rises
and falls in fortune. He
fled New Hampshire in
1775 because he was a
British loyalist, he fled
London in 1782 under
suspicion of being a
French spy, and he was, at
the time of his studies of
heat, among the most
powerful people in
Bavaria.

CHAPT ER 7 Heat and Phase Transitions

Open Fires and Woodstoves
Suppose you needed an easy way to heat your room. The oldest and simplest method would
be to start a campfire in the middle of the floor. The burning wood would produce thermal
energy, which would flow as heat into the colder room. But how does burning wood produce thermal energy?
This thermal energy is released by a chemical reaction between molecules in the
wood and oxygen in the air. Recall that atoms do work as they join together in a chemical
bond and that the amount of work done depends on which atoms are being joined. For
example, while carbon and hydrogen atoms can bond with one another to form hydrocarbon molecules, these atoms form much stronger bonds with oxygen atoms. Thus, although
it may take work to disassemble a hydrocarbon molecule, the work done by its hydrogen
and carbon atoms as they bind to oxygen atoms more than makes up for that investment. As
a hydrocarbon molecule burns in oxygen, new, more tightly bound molecules are formed
and chemical potential energy is released as thermal energy. The reaction products produced by burning hydrocarbons in air are primarily water and carbon dioxide.
Wood is composed mostly of cellulose, a long carbohydrate molecule. Carbohydrates
contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Despite the presence of a few oxygen atoms,
carbohydrates still burn nicely to form water and carbon dioxide. When you light the wood
with a match, youâre supplying the energy needed to break the old chemical bonds so that
the new bonds can form. This starting energy is called activation energy, the energy
needed to initiate the chemical reaction. Heat from the match flame gives the wood enough
thermal energy to break chemical bonds between various atoms and start the reaction.
Unfortunately, wood isnât pure cellulose. It also contains many complex resins that
donât burn well and that create smoke. If you plan to breathe the air in which you burn
fuel, wood is an awful choice. Youâd be better off with kerosene or natural gas, both of
which are nearly pure hydrocarbons and burn cleanly. Actually, wood can be converted to
a cleaner fuel by baking it in an airless oven to remove all its volatile resins. This process
converts the wood into charcoal, which burns to form nearly pure carbon dioxide, water
vapor, and ash.
However, even with clean-burning fuels, the direct fire-in-the-room heating concept
has its disadvantagesâit consumes the roomâs oxygen and presents a safety hazard. Nonetheless, fires have heated dwellings for thousands of years. While fireplaces that burn wood
or peat have chimneys that carry away their noxious fumes, the rising smoke also takes
with it much of the fireâs thermal energy and some of the roomâs air. Thatâs why a room
thatâs heated by a fireplace often feels drafty away from the fireplace itselfâcold outside
air is seeping in through cracks to replace air drawn up the chimney. Even when
clean-burning fuels are used without a chimney, there are no simple solutions to the oxygen
-loss or safety problems.
Like a fireplace, a woodstove sends fumes from its burning wood up a chimney. But
before its thermal energy can follow the fumes outside, a well-designed woodstove transfers most of that energy into the room. A woodstove is an example of a heat exchanger, a
device that transfers heat without transferring the hot molecules themselves. Its smoke
never enters the room, but heat from that smoke does. Most combustion furnaces, such as
those fueled by natural gas, propane, oil, and coal, also employ heat exchangers.
The burning coals and hot gases inside the woodstove contain a great deal of thermal
energy and are much hotter than the room air. Because of this temperature difference,
heat tends to flow from the fire to the room. What is not so clear yet is how that heat is
transferred.
There are three principal mechanisms by which heat moves from the fire to the room:
conduction, convection, and radiation. The woodstove makes wonderful use of all three so
that most of the thermal energy released by the burning wood is transferred to the room.
Letâs examine these three mechanisms of heat transport, beginning with conduction.

Check Your Understanding #4: Feeling the Heat
You can make a heat pack by wrapping hot wet towels in a plastic sheet. This pack will warm an
injured muscle but will not get it wet. Is thermal energy moving in this case?
Answer: Yes, thermal energy is flowing from the hot towels, through the plastic, to the muscle.
Why: The plastic sheet is acting as a heat exchanger, allowing heat to flow from the hot towels to the
cooler muscle but preventing any movement of the hot water itself.

Heat Moving through Metal: Conduction
Conduction occurs when heat flows through a stationary material. The heat moves from a
hot region to a cold region, but the atoms and molecules donât. For example, if you place
the tip of a metal poker in the fire, the pokerâs handle will gradually become warm as the
metal conducts heat.
Some of this heat is conducted by interactions between adjacent atoms. The vibrating
atoms frequently push on one another, doing microscopic work in the process and exchanging miniscule amounts of thermal kinetic energy. In this fashion, thermal energy flows
randomly from atom to neighboring atom.
However, when the pokerâs tip is hotter than its handle, the flow is no longer completely random. The atoms at the hot tip have more thermal kinetic energy to exchange with
their neighbors than atoms at the cold handle. The exchanges statistically favor the flow of
thermal energy away from the hot tip and toward the cold handle. This flow of thermal
energy from hot to cold through the poker is conduction (Fig. 7.1.3).
This atom-by-atom bucket brigade isnât the only way in which materials conduct heat.
In a metal, the primary carriers of heat are actually mobile electrons, the tiny negatively
charged particles that make up the outer portions of atoms. When atoms join together to
form a metal, some of the electrons stop belonging to particular atoms and travel almost
freely throughout the metal. These mobile electrons can carry electricity (as weâll discuss
in Chapter 10) and are also good at transporting heat.
Mobile electrons participate in the bucket brigade of heat conduction because they,
too, can push on vibrating atoms and exchange thermal kinetic energy with them. However,
while atoms can pass thermal energy only from one neighbor to the next, mobile electrons
can travel great distances between exchange partners and can move thermal energy quickly
from one place to another.
The ease with which electrons move heat about a metal explains why metals generally
have higher thermal conductivities than nonmetals. Thermal conductivity is the measure
of how rapidly heat flows through a material when itâs exposed to a difference in temperatures. The best conductors of electricityâcopper, silver, aluminum, and goldâare also the
best conductors of heat. Poor conductors of electricityâstainless steel and insulators such
as plastic and glassâare also poor conductors of heat. There are a few exceptions to this
rule. Diamonds, for example, are terrible conductors of electricity but wonderful conductors of heat.
Conduction is what moves thermal energy from the woodstoveâs inside to its outside.
No atoms move through the metal walls of the stove, just heat. So conduction serves as a
filter, separating desirable thermal energy from the unwanted smoke and noxious gases that
then go up the chimney.
Thus conduction makes the outside surface of the woodstove hot, allowing heat to flow
from it to the colder room. What carries that heat into the room? If you touch the stove,
conduction will immediately transfer a huge amount of heat to your skin and youâll be
burned. Even without touching the stove, youâre aware of its high temperature. It transfers
heat into the room by convection and radiation.

Check Your Understanding #5: Too Hot to Handle
Some pot handles remain cool during cooking while others become unpleasantly hot. What determines which handles remain cool and which become hot?
Answer: Itâs determined by the handleâs thermal conductivity.
Why: Some handles are made of plastics or stainless steel, which are poor conductors of both electricity and heat. These handles normally remain cool unless hot gases from the stove directly heat
them. Other handles are made from aluminum, copper, or cast iron, which are good conductors of
electricity and heat. These handles often become unbearably hot.

Heat Moving with Air: Convection
Convection occurs when a moving fluid transports heat from a hotter object to a colder
object. The heat moves as thermal energy in the fluid so that the two travel together. The
fluid usually follows a circular path between the two objects, picking up heat from the
hotter object, giving it to the colder object, and then returning to the hotter object to begin
the cycle again.
This circulation often develops naturally. As the fluid warms near the hotter object, its
density decreases and it floats upward, lifted by the buoyant force. When the fluid cools
near the colder object, its density increases and it sinks downward.
Thus air heated by contact with the woodstove rises toward the ceiling and is replaced
by colder air from the floor (Fig. 7.1.4). Eventually, this heated air cools and descends.
Once it reaches the floor, itâs drawn back toward the hot woodstove to start the cycle over.
This moving air is a convection current, and the looping path that it follows is a convection cell. Within the room, convection currents carry heat up and out from the woodstove
to the ceiling and walls. When you put your hand over the stove, you feel this convection
current rising as it transfers heat to your hand.
Natural convection is good at heating the air above the woodstove, but most of that hot
air ends up near the ceiling. Although some of it will eventually drift downward to where
youâre standing, convection sometimes needs help. Adding a ceiling fan will help move the
hot air around the room and make the woodstove more effective. This forced convection
still transfers heat from the hot stove to the colder occupants of the room, but it doesnât rely
on the buoyant force to keep the air circulating. The faster the air moves, the more heat it
can transport from hot objects to cold objects.

Check Your Understanding #6: Heat and Wind
When sunlight warms the land beside a cool body of water, a breeze begins to blow from the water
toward the land. Explain.
Answer: Convection occurs, with warmed air rising over the land and being replaced by cooler air
from above the water. The air moving from over the water to over the land creates the breeze.

Fig. 7.1.4 When the
woodstove is hot, convection
carries heat from its
surfaces to the ceiling and
walls of the room. Warm
air rises upward, supported
by the buoyant force, and
is replaced by cooler air
from the floor. The warmed
air eventually cools and
descends. It then returns
toward the stove to repeat
the cycle.

Why: Winds are giant convection currents caused by solar heating. Air rises over warm spots on
Earthâs surface, and surface winds blow toward those warm spots to replace the missing air.

Heat Moving as Light: Radiation
There is one more important mechanism of heat transferâradiation. As the particles inside
a material jitter about with thermal energy, they emit and absorb electromagnetic radiation.
This radiation consists of electromagnetic waves, which include radio waves, microwaves,
and infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light.
Weâll study electromagnetic radiation later in this book. For now, whatâs most important is that this radiation can carry thermal energy. When heat flows from a hot object to a

absorber of light.

cold object as electromagnetic radiation, we say that heat is being transferred by thermal
radiation or simply radiation. Unlike conduction and convection, which depend on atoms,
molecules, or electrons to carry the heat, radiation occurs directly through space. Radiative
heat transfer happens even when two objects have nothing at all between them.
The types of electromagnetic waves in an objectâs thermal radiation depend on its
temperature. While a colder object emits only radio waves, microwaves, and infrared light,
a hotter object can also emit visible or even ultraviolet light. The red glow of a hot coal in
the woodstove is that coalâs thermal radiation.
Since our eyes are sensitive only to visible light, we canât see all the thermal radiation
emitted by an object, even when itâs hot. However, whether we see it or not, electromagnetic radiation contains energy and transfers heat to whatever absorbs it. While everything
emits thermal radiation, the amount of that emission depends on temperature: the hotter an
object, the more thermal radiation it emits. When two objects face one another, thermal
radiation will travel in both directions between them. However, the hotter object will dominate this radiant exchange of thermal energy, resulting in a net transfer of thermal energy
to the colder object. Exchanges of thermal energy via radiation always transfer heat from a
hotter object to a colder one.
Radiation transfers a great deal of heat from the woodstoveâs surface to the surrounding objects. The stove bathes the room in infrared light, which warms everything it reaches.
To encourage such radiative heat transfer, the metal woodstove and its chimney are often
painted black. Black not only absorbs light well, but itâs also particularly good at emitting
thermal light (Fig. 7.1.5). If you heat a black poker red hot, it will glow much more brightly
than one thatâs white, silvery, or transparent.
COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Black Objects and Light
Misconception: A black object never emits light.
Resolution: Although a black object absorbs all light that strikes it, it still emits thermal radiation
and will glow brightly if itâs hot enough.

Even if air in the room is cold, you can usually feel the invisible infrared light from a
woodstove on your face. When you block this light with your hands, your face suddenly
feels colder because less heat is reaching your skin. This thermal radiation effect is even
more pronounced with a fireplace or campfire, where thermal radiation from the hot coals
and flames is the primary mechanism for heat transfer to the surroundings.

CHAPT ER 7 Heat and Phase Transitions

Overall, a modern woodstove is an excellent heat exchanger. As convection draws
hot smoke up the long black chimney pipe, the smoke heats the stove and the pipe.
These metal components conduct heat to their outer surfaces, which then distribute it
around the room by convection and radiation. Although the stove consumes some room
air, it controls the airflow with dampers so that it draws in only enough air to completely
burn the wood. Overall, the stove extracts heat efficiently, cleanly, and safely from the
burning wood.
Check Your Understanding #7: Keeping Warm
When you stand under a heat lamp, you feel warm even though the lamp emits little visible light. How
is heat reaching your skin?
Answer: Radiation transfers heat from the lampâs filament to your skin.
Why: A heat lamp emits large amounts of invisible infrared radiation. Although you canât see this
radiation, you can feel it on your skin.

Warming the Room
You light the woodstove, and its heat begins flowing out into the cold room. Moving always
from a hotter object to a colder object, heat enters each item in the room and gradually
raises its temperature. For example, a once-frigid brass bowl near the woodstove is soon
pleasantly warm to the touch.
Letâs take a look at the relationship between the heat added to that bowl and its temperature rise. Because the bowlâs temperature increases steadily when heat is flowing
into it steadily, its overall temperature rise must be proportional to the added heat.
The constant of proportionality is called the bowlâs heat capacity and is the amount of
heat that must be added to the bowl to cause its temperature to rise by 1 unit. In effect,
the bowlâs heat capacity is the measure of its thermal sluggishness, its resistance to
temperature changes.
Now suppose that you have an assortment of bowls near the woodstove, each a different material. If you keep track of their temperatures, youâll find that some of them warm
faster than others. Even when you take into account differences in their masses and in how
much heat each one is receiving from the woodstove, youâll find that bowls made of different materials respond differently to added heat. Some materials are more thermally sluggish than others.
We can characterize each material by its heat capacity per unit mass, a quantity known
as specific heat. To find the specific heat of the material from which a particular bowl is
made, you divide that bowlâs heat capacity by its mass, or
specific heat =

heat capacity
.
mass

The SI unit of specific heat is the joule per kilogram-kelvin (abbreviated J/kg â K).
Table 7.1.2 contains the specific heats for a number of common materials. The wide
range of values indicates that different materials respond quite differently to added heat.
Each materialâs specific heat depends principally on the number of microscopic ways it can
store thermal energy per kilogram. Known as a degree of freedom, each independent way
of handling thermal energy stores an average thermal energy equal to one-half the Boltzmann constant times the absolute temperature (Â˝ kT). The Boltzmann constant, which we
first encountered in Section 5.1, has a measured value of 1.381 Ă 10â23 J/K, and its units
here are equivalent to those that appeared in Section 5.1.
Brassâs relatively small specific heat explains why the brass bowl heats up so quickly
when you place it directly on the woodstove; the bowl has relatively few degrees of

freedom in which to store its thermal energy. But if you add even a modest amount of water
to the bowl, the waterâs astonishingly large specific heat will dramatically slow the bowlâs
temperature rise. Water has a remarkable capacity for thermal energy.
Like brass or water, air also has a specific heat. However, airâs specific heat depends
on how you measure it. Thatâs because gases tend to expand as they warm up. If you seal
the air in a bottle, so that its volume doesnât change, it warms relatively easily; airâs specific
heat at constant volume is 715 J/kg â K. But if you allow the air to expand as its temperature
rises, so that its pressure doesnât change, itâs harder to warm. Thatâs because it needs extra
energy to push the surrounding air out of its way as it expands; airâs specific heat at constant
pressure is 1001 J/kg â K.
Since the room isnât perfectly sealed, the air inside it expands as itâs heated and
the larger specific heat applies. If itâs a typical living room, then its volume is about
40 m3 (1400 ft3) and it contains about 50 kg (110 lbm) of air. The heat needed to warm
that air is proportional to how much you want to raise its temperature and is equal to
airâs specific heat times its mass, or about 50,000 J/K. For every kelvin or degree
Celsius you want to warm the room air, the woodstove has to provide about 50,000
joules of heat!
When the temperature outside is 0 Â°C (32 Â°F), it takes about 1,000,000 joules to warm
the roomâs air to 20 Â°C (68 Â°F). Thatâs the heat energy in about 0.07 kg (2 ounces) of wood.
Every time you open the front door and let the room fill with outdoor air, the woodstove has
to burn that amount of wood to return the room air to 20 Â°C. You can save energy and help
the environment simply by keeping the doors and windows closed whenever youâre trying
to keep the room air hotter (or colder) than it is outside.
Check Your Understanding #8: Hot Stuff
When you pull a metal tray of moist cookies out of the oven, the tray initially feels much hotter than
the cookies. A little while later, however, the cookies feel much hotter than the tray. Explain.
Answer: At first, both the tray and the cookies are hot. The tray feels hottest because its metal conducts heat well and can deliver more heat to your skin. But the tray has a relatively small heat
capacity, and its temperature plummets in the cool room air. The moist cookies have large heat
capacities, so they cool relatively slowly.
Why: Metals often feel hotter or colder to the touch than insulators because theyâre so good at transferring heat in either direction. However, materials containing water have much larger specific heats
than metals and therefore maintain their temperatures better.

Water

Water is probably the most important chemical in our daily
lives. It is so crucial to biology, climate, commerce, industry,
and entertainment that it merits a whole section of its own.
Moreover, it exhibits the three classic phases of matterâsolid,
liquid, and gasâand illustrates the role that heat plays in
transforming one phase into another. Although most of what we
can learn from water is applicable to any material, there are a
few aspects of water that are almost unique in nature. Water
really is a remarkable substance.

Questions to Think About: Why does adding ice make a
drink cold? Why do icebergs float on water? How does perspiration cool you off? Why do humid days feel so muggy?
What is the difference between evaporating and boiling?
How does snow disappear from the ground even when itâs
very cold outside?
Experiments to Do: Experimenting with water is easy. Pick up
an ice cube with wet fingers. What happens if the ice cube has
just come out of the freezer? What if it has been melting on
the table for a few minutes? Why is there a difference? Put
both ice cubes in water. Why do they float?
Now heat tap water in a pot. Shortly before the water
starts to boil, you will see mist begin to form above it. What is
this mist, and why does it form? Carefully feel the mist, but
donât burn yourself! The mist feels damp because it contains
water. How can water be leaving the pot before the water boils?
Notice the small gas bubbles on the walls of the pot. Theyâre
not steam; where did this gas come from?
Once the water boils, invisible steam (gaseous water) will
push the mist layer upward. Donât touch this steam because it
can burn you quickly. Why does steam release so much thermal
energy when it touches your skin?

Solid, Liquid, and Gas: The Phases of Matter

Courtesy Lou Bloomfield

Like most substances, water exists in three distinct forms or phases: solid ice, liquid water,
and gaseous steam (Fig. 7.2.1). These phases differ in how easily their shapes and volumes
can change. Ice is solid, rigid and incompressible; you canât alter an ice cubeâs shape or its
volume. Water is liquid, fluid but incompressible; you can reshape the water in a pitcher
but you canât change its volume. Steam is gaseous, fluid and compressible; you can vary
both the shape and the volume of the steam in a tea kettle.
These different characteristics reflect the different microscopic structures of steam,
water, and ice. Steam, or water vapor, is a gas, a collection of independent molecules kept

in motion by thermal energy. These water molecules bounce around their container, periodically colliding with one another or with the walls. The water molecules fill the container
uniformly and can accommodate any changes in its shape or size. Enlarging the container
simply decreases the steamâs density and lowers its pressure.
When they are independent of one another as gaseous steam, water molecules have a
substantial amount of chemical potential energy. They can release some of this energy by
joining together to form ordinary water. Water is a liquid, a disorderly collection of molecules that cling to one another with chemical bonds. Because these bonds arenât very
strong, the molecules in water can use thermal energy to break them temporarily and then
change bonding partners. This rebonding process allows water to change shape so that it is
a fluid. Despite their flexibility, however, these bonds manage to bunch the water molecules
together so snugly that even squeezing canât pack them much tighter. Thatâs why water is
incompressible.
The molecules in water can release still more chemical potential energy by linking
together stiffly as ice. Ice is a solid, a rigid collection of chemically bound molecules. Like
most solids, ice is crystallineâits water molecules are arranged in an orderly latticework
that extends over long distances and gives rise to the beautiful crystal facets seen on snowflakes and frost. Iceâs crystalline structure is so constraining that its water molecules canât
use thermal energy to change bonding partners, and consequently ice canât change shape.
Just as an orderly stack of oranges at the grocery store takes up less volume than a
disorderly heap, a crystalline solid almost always occupies less volume than its corresponding disorderly liquid. The solid phase of a typical substance is thus denser than the liquid
phase of that same substance, so the solid phase sinks in the liquid phase.
There is only one common substance that violates that ruleâwater. Iceâs crystalline
structure is unusually open, and its density is surprisingly low. Almost unique in nature,
solid ice is slightly less dense than liquid water, and ice therefore floats on water. Thatâs
why icebergs float on the open ocean and why ice cubes float in your drink. In fact, water
reaches its greatest density when it is liquid at about 4 Â°C (39 Â°F).

As a pond freezes, where does the ice begin to form?
Answer: It begins to form at the surface of the pond.
Why: Because ice is less dense than water, it floats at the surface of the pond. The pond therefore
freezes from its top down. The insulating layer of ice at the top of the pond impedes the freezing of
the remainder of the water, so the pond is unlikely to freeze solid. This behavior allows animals to
live in the pond during winter. If ice sank, the pond would freeze solid and the animals would die.
Thus, iceâs tendency to float has profound implications for life on our planet.

Melting Ice and Freezing Water
Ice in a freezer is extremely cold, typically â18 Â°C (0 Â°F). When you place this ice on a
warm countertop, heat flows into it and its temperature rises. The ice remains solid until its
temperature reaches 0 Â°C (32 Â°F). At that point, the ice stops getting warmer and begins to
melt. Melting is a phase transition, a transformation from the ordered solid phase to the
disordered liquid phase. This transition occurs when heat breaks some of the chemical
bonds between water molecules and permits the molecules to move past one another. The
melting ice transforms into water, losing its rigid shape and crystalline structure.
Zero degrees Celsius is iceâs melting temperature, the temperature at which heat
goes into breaking bonds and converting ice into water, rather than into making the ice
hotter. The ice-water mixture remains at 0 Â°C until all the ice has melted. When only water
remains, heat once again causes its temperature to rise.

CHAPT ER 7 Heat and Phase Transitions

The heat used to transform a certain mass of solid into liquid, without changing its
temperature, is called the latent heat of melting or, more formally, latent heat of fusion.
The bonds between the water molecules in ice are strong enough to give ice an enormous
latent heat of melting; it takes about 333,000 J of heat to convert 1 kg of ice at 0 Â°C into 1 kg
of water at 0 Â°C. Since waterâs specific heat is 4190 J/kg â K, that same amount of heat
would raise the temperature of 1 kg of liquid water by about 80 Â°C. Thus it takes almost as
much heat to melt an ice cube as it does to warm the resulting water all the way to boiling.
The latent heat of melting reappears when you cool the water back to its melting temperature and it starts to freeze. Freezing is another phase transition, a transformation from
the disordered liquid phase to the ordered solid phase. As you remove heat from water at
0 Â°C, the water freezes into ice rather than becoming colder. Because the water molecules
release energy as they bind together to form ice crystals, the water releases heat as it freezes.
The heat released when transforming a certain mass of liquid into solid, without changing
its temperature, is again the latent heat of melting. You must add a certain amount of heat
to ice to melt it and you must remove that same amount of heat from water to solidify it.
Check Your Understanding #2: Keeping Crops Warm
Fruit growers often spray their crops with water to protect them from freezing in unusually cold
weather. How does liquid water keep the fruit from freezing?
Answer: Liquid water releases a large amount of heat as it solidifies, and this heat helps to protect
the fruit from freezing.
Why: Fruit freezes at a temperature somewhat below 0 Â°C. As cold air removes heat from the watercoated fruit, the water begins to freeze. The liquid water gives up a great deal of heat as it solidifies
and prevents the fruitâs temperature from dropping below 0 Â°C until the water has completely turned
to ice. At that point, iceâs poor thermal conductivity insulates the fruit and slows its loss of heat to
the colder air.

Phase Equilibrium: Leaving and Landing
Weâve seen that ice has a melting temperature, so now letâs see why it has a melting
temperature. To do that, we must look at the interface between solid ice and liquid water.
Whenever both phases are in contact, they exchange water molecules across the interface
between them. Water molecules regularly break free from the ice to enter the water, and
they often drop out of the water to stick to the ice. In other words, water molecules are
leaving the ice and landing on it all the time, like airplanes at a busy airport.
Although you canât see the individual leavings and landings, you can observe their net
effect. If leavings outpace landings, the ice will gradually transform into water. If the landings outpace leavings, the water will gradually transform into ice. If the two processes
balance one another, the ice and water will coexist indefinitelyâa situation known as
phase equilibrium.
Temperature plays a crucial role in this balance because it affects the rate at which
water molecules leave the ice. The warmer the ice, the more often water molecules at its
surface can gather enough thermal energy to break free and leave. Below iceâs melting
temperature, water molecules leave the ice too infrequently to balance the landing process
and the water transforms completely into ice. Above iceâs melting temperature, water molecules leave the ice so often that they outstrip the landing process and the ice transforms
completely into water. Only at the melting temperature do the leaving and landing rates
balance so that ice and water can coexist in phase equilibrium.
Iceâs huge latent heat of melting has a stabilizing effect on the phase equilibrium
between ice and water. Whenever ice and water are mixed together, the mixtureâs temperature will shift rapidly toward 0 Â°C. Thatâs because if the mixtureâs temperature is above
0 Â°C, the ice will meltâa phase transformation that absorbs the heat of melting and thereby

Water, Steam, and Ice

lowers the mixtureâs temperature toward 0 Â°C. If the mixtureâs temperature is below 0 Â°C,
the-water will freezeâa phase transformation that releases the heat of melting and thereby
raises the mixtureâs temperature toward 0 Â°C.
As long as the mixture doesnât run out of ice or water, its temperature will soon reach
0 Â°C and remain there even as you add or remove heat from it. Any heat you add to the
mixture goes into melting more ice, not into raising its temperature. Any heat you remove
from the mixture comes from freezing more water, not from lowering its temperature.
Thatâs why your glass of ice water remains at 0 Â°C, even in the hottest or coldest weather
(Fig. 7.2.2).

Check Your Understanding #3: Ice Water
At a restaurant, your glass of water contains 25% ice while your friendâs glass of water contains 75%
ice. Whose water is colder, or are their temperatures equal?
Answer: Their temperatures are equal.
Why: Both glasses contain mixtures of ice and water at 0 Â°C (32 Â°F). If either mixture were colder
than that, its water would be freezing rapidly into ice, and if either mixture were warmer than that,
its ice would be melting rapidly into water.

Evaporating Water and Condensing Steam
Waterâs open surface is another active interface between phases, but this time the liquid
water is exchanging molecules with gaseous steam. Water molecules are feverishly leaving
the water for the steam and landing on the water from the steam, once again like planes at
a busy airport.
While this frantic exchange of molecules is intriguing, what matters most is its net
effect. If more molecules leave the water than return to it, then water gradually evaporates
into steam. Evaporation is the phase transition from liquid to gas. On the other hand, if
more molecules are landing on the water than leaving it, the steam gradually condenses
into water. Condensation is the phase transition from gas to liquid. If landing and leaving
are balanced, water and steam coexist in phase equilibrium.
These two phase transitions have enormous thermal consequences. Since the molecules in water cling to one another with chemical bonds, it takes energy to separate them.
Although the bonds between water molecules are weaker than the bonds within water
molecules, it still takes a great deal of energy to transform water into steam.
The heat needed to transform a certain mass of liquid into gas, without changing its
temperature, is called the latent heat of evaporation or, more formally, latent heat of
vaporization. Waterâs latent heat of evaporation is truly enormous because water molecules are surprisingly hard to separate. About 2,300,000 J of heat is needed to convert 1 kg
of water at 100 Â°C into 1 kg of steam at 100 Â°C. That same amount of heat would raise the
temperature of 1 kg of water by more than 500 Â°C!
You are most aware of this latent heat of evaporation on hot summer days when the
perspiration that evaporates from your skin draws heat from you and lowers your temperature. As each water molecule leaves your skin to become steam, it gathers up more than its
fair share of thermal energy from its environment and carries it away as chemical potential
energy. The departing water molecules thus leave you bereft of thermal energy, and you
grow colder.
The latent heat of evaporation reappears when steam condenses and the gathering
water molecules release their chemical potential energy as heat. The heat released when a
certain mass of gas is transformed into liquid, without changing its temperature, is again
the latent heat of evaporation. You must add a certain amount of heat to water to evaporate
it, and you must remove that same amount of heat from steam to condense it.

The huge amount of heat released by condensing steam is often used to cook food or
warm radiators in older buildings. When you steam vegetables, you are allowing steam to
condense on the vegetables and transfer heat to them. A double-boiler uses condensing
steam to transfer heat from a burner to a cooking container in a controlled manner.
Check Your Understanding #4: Tea Time
A kettle of water heats up rapidly on the stove but takes quite a while to boil away. Why does the
water take so long to turn into steam?
Answer: The stove must operate for a long time to provide waterâs huge latent heat of evaporation.
Why: Converting a kettle of hot water into steam requires an enormous amount of heat. This heat
separates the molecules without raising their temperature. Since the stove provides only a certain
amount of heat each second, it may take many minutes to boil away the water.

Relative Humidity

determine the airâs
relative humidity using
two thermometers, one

to the airâs relative
humidity. The dryer the
air, the colder the wet-bulb
thermometer becomes.

Although weâve examined the consequences of evaporating and condensing, we havenât
yet seen what conditions determine when theyâll occur. It all comes down to water molecules leaving and landing, so letâs take a look at why one process wins out over the other.
The basic indicator of whether water will evaporate or steam will condense is relative
humidity. Relative humidity measures the water moleculesâ landing rate as a percentage
of the leaving rate. When the relative humidity is 100%, the two rates are equal and water
and steam can coexistâthey are in phase equilibrium. When the relative humidity is less
than 100%, the landing rate is less than the leaving rate and the water evaporatesâonly
steam will remain at equilibrium. Finally, when the relative humidity is more than 100%,
the landing rate is more than the leaving rate and the steam condensesâno equilibrium is
possible until the relative humidity has dropped to 100%.
Relative humidity depends on the temperature and on the density of the steam. Temperature affects the leaving rate. The warmer the water, the more thermal energy it contains
and the more frequently water molecules leave its surface to become gas. By itself, an
increase in temperature will boost the leaving rate and thereby decrease the relative humidity. Rising temperatures thus favor evaporation.
The density of water molecules in the steam affects the landing rate. The denser the
steam, the more often water molecules land on the water to become liquid. By itself, an
increase in steam density will boost the landing rate and thereby increase the relative
humidity. Rising steam densities thus favor condensation. Even when that steam is mixed
with air, as it often is, the air molecules act as passive bystanders. The density of water
molecules alone determines the airâs relative humidity.
Relative humidity plays an important role in countless experiences of everyday life.
When the relative humidity is low, water evaporates quickly and the air feels dry. Perspiration
cools you effectively. When the relative humidity is high (near 100%), water barely evaporates at all and the air feels damp. Perspiration clings to your skin and doesnât cool you much.
When the relative humidity exceeds 100%, perhaps because of a sudden temperature
drop, steam begins to condense everywhere. Water droplets grow on surfaces as dew or
form directly in the air as fog, mist, or clouds. If the humidity remains high, these droplets
grow larger and eventually fall as rain.
You can measure relative humidity by observing the cooling that accompanies evaporation. The most common scheme involves two thermometers (Fig. 7.2.3), one of which
has a wet cloth wrapped around its bulb (right). Water evaporating from the wet cloth cools
the thermometer until that water reaches phase equilibrium with steam in the air and
evaporation ceases. The dryer the air, the colder the thermometer gets. The temperatures of
the two thermometers can then be used to determine the relative humidity, usually with the
help of tabulated values.

Water, Steam, and Ice

Check Your Understanding #5: Seeing Your Breath
When you breathe out on a cold day, you often see mist appearing from your mouth. Explain.
Answer: As the warm, moist air from your mouth cools, its relative humidity increases above 100%.
The water vapor condenses to form a mist of water droplets.
Why: Changes in temperature affect relative humidity. Although the warm air leaving your lungs can
contain a large portion of water vapor, its relative humidity increases dramatically as it cools. At lower
temperatures, condensation takes over and the invisible water vapor condenses into a mist of visible
water droplets.

Subliming Ice and Depositing Steam
Weâve examined phase transitions between ice and water and between water and steam.
That brings us to the phase transitions between ice and steam. Oddly enough, water molecules can leave ice to become steam and can land from steam to become ice. In fact, ice and
steam regularly exchange water molecules even when there is no liquid water present at all.
As usual, this exchange of water molecules occurs at the surface of the ice, the interface between ice and steam. Since weâre most interested in the net movement of molecules,
it comes down to leaving and landing rates on the ice. If molecules leave the ice more often
than they land, the ice sublimes. Sublimation is the phase transition from solid to gas. If
molecules land on the ice more often than they leave, the steam deposits. Deposition is the
phase transition from gas to solid. Once again, relative humidity measures the landing rate
as a percentage of the leaving rate. At 100% relative humidity, ice and steam are in phase
equilibrium.
When the relative humidity is below 100%, ice sublimes. This effect gives rise to a
number of familiar phenomena. When the weather is cold and dry, snow gradually disappears from the ground without ever melting. In the low relative humidity of a frostless
freezer, the ice cubes slowly shrink to miniature size. When you leave food unprotected in
that same frostless freezer, it eventually dries out. While this âfreezer burnâ is a nuisance at
home, sublimation from frozen food is used commercially to prepare freeze-dried foods.
When the relative humidity exceeds 100%, steam deposits. This process yields several
other familiar effects. Frost forms on cold windows and lawns that are exposed to humid
air. In the high relative humidity of a nonfrostless freezer, frost and ice accumulate on the
walls and require periodic defrosting. Snowflakes grow in clouds and then descend gracefully to the ground.
Check Your Understanding #6: Disappearing Stink
Mothballs are smelly, crystalline pellets used to protect woolen clothes from attack by insects. If you
sprinkle them into a closet and wait a few years, the mothballs will disappear. How do they vanish?
Answer: The mothballs sublime.
Why: Although mothballs do not melt at room temperature, they sublime readily. The air around them
quickly becomes saturated with gaseous mothball molecules, and thatâs why it smells so strongly.

Boiling Water
With three phases and six phase transitions, we seem to be out of possibilities. Where does
boiling fit into this picture? Boiling is simply an accelerated form of evaporation in which
bubbles of pure steam grow by evaporation inside the water itself. To understand boiling,
letâs take a look at the interplay between water and steam.
Suppose we seal some water inside an airless container and keep it at a constant temperature. The water will evaporate as steam until the relative humidity inside the container

reaches 100%. At that point, the water and steam will have reached phase equilibrium; the
steam will have just the right density so that its water molecules will land on the water as
often as they leave. Steam at its equilibrium density is said to be saturated.
Of course, the density of that saturated steam depends on the temperature of the container. If you warm up the container, water molecules will leave the water more frequently
and the density of the steam will have to increase to match the landing rate to the leaving
rate. The density of saturated steam is thus an increasing function of the temperature.
The saturated steamâs density, together with its temperature, determines its pressureâ
the pressure inside our container. Near room temperature, the pressure of saturated steam
is only a few percent of atmospheric pressure. It increases with temperature, however, so
that, as the temperature approaches 100 Â°C (212 Â°F), the pressure of saturated steam
approaches atmospheric pressure.
With that background, suppose that we place a bubble of pure saturated steam in room
temperature water thatâs at atmospheric pressure. Because the pressure inside that bubble
is much lower than atmospheric pressure, the surrounding water will rush inward and compress it. As the steam bubbleâs volume shrinks, the steam will exceed its saturated density
and begin to condense. In the blink of an eye, the bubble will be smashed out of existence.
Now suppose we begin warming the water on the stove. As the water temperature
increases, steamâs saturated density and pressure both increase. At first, saturated steam
bubbles remain unstable; theyâre crushed quickly by atmospheric pressure. However, when
the water temperature is near 100 Â°C, something remarkable happens: saturated steam bubbles suddenly become stable and the water can begin boiling (Fig. 7.2.4). At that temperature, waterâs boiling temperature, the pressure of saturated steam reaches atmospheric
pressure and bubbles of saturated steam can survive indefinitely within the water. Even
more remarkably, these bubbles can grow by evaporation; each bubbleâs surface is an interface between water and steam, so when heat is added to the water, water can transform into
steam and enlarge the bubble. Although the bubbles quickly float to the waterâs surface and
pop, new bubbles can promptly take their place.
Boiling converts water to steam so rapidly that it consumes almost any amount of heat
you add to the water. Thatâs why itâs so difficult to warm water above its boiling temperature. An open pot of water on the stove warms to waterâs boiling temperature and then
remains at that temperature until all the water has transformed into steam. Only then can
the potâs temperature again begin to increase.
The constant, well-defined temperature of boiling water allows you to cook vegetables
or an egg at a particular rate. When you place an egg in boiling water, it cooks in 3 minutes
because itâs in contact with water at its boiling temperature.
Check Your Understanding #7: Vanishing Bubbles
You are heating water in a pot on the stove. Shortly before the water boils properly, bubbles of steam
begin rising from the bottom of the pot but vanish before they reach the waterâs surface. What happens to those bubbles?
Answer: The rising steam bubbles condense as they pass through water that is below its boiling
temperature.
Why: Water at the bottom of the pot reaches its boiling temperature first, so bubbles of steam begin
to rise from it. But water nearer the surface of the pot isnât quite hot enough to sustain those bubbles. Instead, the steam inside them condenses and they collapse completely.

Changing Waterâs Boiling Temperature
Waterâs boiling temperature depends on the ambient pressure. For an open pot or pan, that
pressure is atmospheric pressure. However, atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude
and depends somewhat on the weather. Water boils at 100 Â°C (212 Â°F) near sea level but at

Water, Steam, and Ice

only 90 Â°C (194 Â°F) at an altitude of 3000 m (9800 ft). This reduction in waterâs boiling
temperature with altitude explains why many recipes must be adapted for use at higher
elevations. At 3000 m, an egg cooks slowly in boiling water because itâs surrounded by
90 Â°C water, not 100 Â°C water. The same problem slows the cooking of rice, beans, and
many other foods at high altitudes.
At sufficiently low pressures, water boils even at room temperature or below. At the
other extreme, high pressures can prevent water from boiling until itâs extremely hot. The
boilers in steam engines and power plants often operate at such high pressures that waterâs
boiling temperature inside them may exceed 300 Â°C (572 Â°F).
One way to decrease cooking times is to use a pressure cooker, a sturdy pot that seals
in steam so that the pressure inside it can exceed atmospheric pressure. This increased
pressure prevents boiling until the water temperature is well above 100 Â°C. If you subject
water to twice sea-level atmospheric pressure, it wonât boil until 121 Â°C (250 Â°F). An egg
cooks very quickly at that temperature, as do vegetables and other foods.
However, just because water can boil, doesnât mean that it will boil. Boiling depends on
tiny seed bubbles that subsequently grow by evaporation. Without seed bubbles, the water
wonât boil. Because nucleation, or seed-bubble formation, almost never occurs spontaneously in water below 300 Â°C, something else must create those seeds. Most nucleation occurs
at defects or hotspots on the container or at contaminants in the liquid. Those nucleation sites
usually trap air or other permanent gases and then serve as nurseries for seed bubbles of
steam. Reliance on these specific nucleation sites explains why the-bubbles of boiling water,
like those in soda or champagne, often stream upward from-specific spots on their containers.
When you heat water uniformly in a clean, glass container, it may not boil properly at
its boiling temperature. Glass has a liquid-like smoothness even at the atomic scale and
rarely aids seed-bubble formation. Without any long-lived nucleation sites, the water may
stop forming seed bubbles and cease boiling. Once boiling stops, the waterâs temperature
can rise above the boiling temperature so that it becomes superheated.
Superheated water, which forms easily and often in a microwave oven, can be extremely
dangerous. Touching it with a fork, adding sugar or salt, or even just tapping its container
can initiate violent or even explosive boiling (Fig. 7.2.5). The more the waterâs temperature
exceeds its boiling temperature, the more energy it can release suddenly if it abruptly boils.
Be careful when you heat water in a microwave oven, particularly in a glass or glazed container. If it doesnât appear to be boiling properly despite being very hot, recognize that it
may be superheated. Your safest bet is to stay away from it until it has cooled down.
There is one other interesting way to change waterâs boiling temperature: dissolve
chemicals in it. A dissolved chemical keeps the water molecules busy so that they are less
likely to leave the water to become steam, or ice for that matter. Since dissolved chemicals
discourage water molecules from leaving waterâs liquid phase, they suppress any phase
transitions that reduce the amount of liquid phase water. Thatâs why dissolving sugar or salt
in water slows its evaporation and raises its boiling temperature. Itâs also why salt water
freezes at a lower temperature than freshwater and why salt tends to melt ice. In contrast,
sand doesnât melt ice because it doesnât dissolve in water.

Check Your Understanding #8: Lucky Accident
You pull a ceramic mug of hot water out of the microwave oven and add a spoonful of instant coffee.
It bubbles amusingly and splatters a little onto the table. What happened?
Answer: The water in your mug was mildly superheated, and adding the powdered coffee nucleated
boiling.
Why: Like glass, a glazed ceramic mug has no permanent nucleation sites to assist seed-bubble
formation and boiling. Youâre lucky. The water was only slightly superheated, and when you triggered
boiling by adding the powder, it boiled relatively gently and quickly cooled to its normal boiling temperature. Had the water been more severely superheated, you might have been badly scalded.

When you sit in front of a fire on a cold winter day, heat flows
from the glowing coals to your skin and you feel warm. When
you walk through the snow on your way to the store, however,
heat flow is the last thing you want. As the hottest object
around, you will become colder, not warmer. So you bundle up
in your new down coat. Its thermal insulation keeps you warm
in your frigid environment. In this section, weâll examine thermal insulation and see how it prevents heat from moving easily
between objects.
Questions to Think About: When you wear a thick coat on a
cold day, what provides the heat that keeps you warm? How
does your coat keep that heat from leaving you? Your head is
exposed, so what keeps your head warm? Why is good cookware

often made of several different materials? Why does wrapping
food in aluminum foil help keep it hot or cold? Why do most
modern windows have more than one pane of glass in them?
Why does increasing the fraction of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere raise the average temperature at Earthâs surface?
Experiments to Do: Examine the effects of thermal insulation by touching objects while your hand has or does not
have insulation on it. As you pick up a piece of hot toast with
your bare hand, why does your skin feel so hot? Now try again
with a towel or napkin between your skin and the toast. What
has changed? Perform the same experiment with an ice
cube. The towel or napkin keeps your skin comfortable when
you touch either hot or cold objects. How is that possible?
What happens when you use aluminum foil instead of the
towel or napkin?
You can do similar experiments with a heavy coat. The
coat will obviously keep you warm in a cold environment, but it
will also keep you cool (at least briefly) in a hot environment.
Sit in front of a fireplace with a heavy coat on. The parts of your
body that are covered by the coat will barely notice the fireâs
presence. Now touch the exposed surface of the coat carefully
with your fingers. Why is it so hot? As you can see, you need to
be careful when wearing insulated clothes near a fire because
itâs possible to scorch or even ignite those clothes without feeling the heat. Firefighters use heavy fireproof coats to keep cool
as they combat building fires.

The Importance of Insulation
Thermal insulation slows the flow of heat from hot objects to cold and helps keep your
body warm, your refrigerator cold, and your home at a comfortable temperature year
round. Yet in a world where ordered energy is increasingly precious, good insulation is
more than just a convenience; itâs a necessity. Thatâs because whenever thermal energy
leaves something that must remain hot or enters something that must remain cold, replacing or removing that thermal energy consumes ordered energy. You can save ordered
energy and do your part for the environment simply by using good insulation to keep thermal energy where it belongs.
One of the most important examples of thermal insulation is your clothing. Together
with your skin, clothing lowers the rate at which heat flows into or out of your body and
makes it possible for you to keep your body temperature constant.
Why keep your body temperature constant? After all, cold-blooded animals such as
reptiles, amphibians, and fish make no attempts to control their body temperatures. Instead,
they exchange heat freely with their surroundings and are generally in thermal equilibrium
with their environments. Maintaining a constant body temperature is a goal thatâs unique to
mammals and birds. Why bother?
The chemical processes that are responsible for life are very sensitive to temperature.
That sensitivity is due in part to thermal energyâs role in initiating chemical reactions; it
provides the activation energies that many chemical reactions need in order to proceed. As
a cold-blooded animalâs temperature decreases, there is less thermal energy per molecule

Clothing, Insulation, and Climate

and these chemical reactions occur less frequently. The animalâs whole metabolism slows
down, and it becomes sluggish, dimwitted, and vulnerable to predators.
In contrast, warm-blooded animals have temperature regulation systems that allow
them to maintain constant, optimal body temperatures. Regardless of its environment, a
mammal or bird keeps the core of its body at a specific temperature so that it functions the
same way in winter as in summer. The advantages of constant temperature are enormous.
On a cold day, a warm-blooded predator can easily catch and devour its slower-moving
cold-blooded prey.
There is, however, a cost to being warm-blooded. The thermal energy associated with
an animalâs body temperature must come from somewhere, and the animal must struggle
against its environment to maintain its temperature. Without realizing it, many of our
behaviors are governed by our need to maintain body temperature. Our bodies are careful
about how much thermal energy they produce, and we strive to control the rate at which we
exchange heat with our surroundings.
A resting person converts chemical potential energy into thermal energy at the rate of
about 80 calories per hour. Eighty calories per hour is a measure of power, equal to about
100 W, so a resting person generates about 100 W of thermal power. An active person
generates even more. This steady production of thermal energy is why a room filled with
people can get pretty warm. One hundred watts may not seem like much, but when a hundred
people are packed into a tight space, they act like a 10,000-W space heater and the whole
room becomes unpleasantly hot.
If you had no way to get rid of this thermal energy of metabolism, you would become
hotter and hotter. To maintain a constant temperature, you must transfer heat to your surroundings. Since heat flows naturally from a hotter object to a colder object, your body
temperature must generally be higher than the temperature around you. That requirement
is one reason why human body temperature is approximately 37 Â°C (98.6 Â°F). This temperature is higher than all but the hottest locations on Earth, so heat flows naturally from your
body to your surroundings. You produce thermal energy as a by-product of your activities
and transfer this thermal energy as heat to your colder surroundings.
The rate at which your resting body generates thermal energy is fairly constant, so the
principal way in which you stabilize your body temperature is by controlling heat loss.
Like all warm-blooded animals, you have a number of physiological and behavioral techniques for doing just that. In hot weather or when youâre exercising hard, you encourage
heat loss to avoid overheating. In cold weather, you limit heat loss to stay warm. Since this
section is about clothing, weâre going to focus primarily on heat loss in cold weather. All
three heat-transfer mechanisms are involved in that heat loss, so you must control them all
to keep warm.

A toaster oven turns electric energy into thermal energy at a rate of 500 J/s, or 500 W. If the applianceâs temperature remains constant, at what rate is it transferring heat to its environment?
Answer: Itâs transferring heat at the rate of 500 W.
Why: For the oven to maintain a constant temperature, its total thermal energy mustnât change.
Since it produces 500 W of thermal power electrically, it must transfer that same amount of thermal
power to its environment. It acts as a 500-W space heater.

Staying Warm by Limiting Thermal Conduction
One way in which your body retains heat in cold weather is by impeding conductive heat
loss. Heat flows through a material via conduction whenever that material is exposed to a
difference in temperatureâwhenever one side of the material is hotter than the other side.
The rate at which heat flows, however, depends on several factors: the overall temperature

193

194

CHAPT ER 7 Heat and Phase Transitions

difference, the distance separating the hot side from the cold side, the area through which
heat can flow, and the material itself.
Remarkably, heat flows in direct proportion to the temperature difference and to the
area through which that heat can flow. Thus, if you touch your finger to two different cold
surfaces, one 20 Â°C colder than your internal temperature and the other 40 Â°C colder, youâll
lose heat about twice as fast to the colder surface. If you touch two fingers at once, doubling
the area through which heat can flow, youâll lose heat about twice as fast.
On the other hand, further separating the hot and cold sides slows heat flow. The rate
of heat flow is inversely proportional to that distance. For example, doubling the thickness
of your gloves when youâre building a snowman will double the separation between hot
and cold and roughly halve the heat flow.
Finally, some materials are better conductors of heat than others; they have different
thermal conductivities. Skin has a particularly low thermal conductivity, meaning that it
conducts relatively little heat compared to materials such as glass or copper. Thermal conductivity is a characteristic of the material itself, and its SI unit is the watt per meter-kelvin
(W/m â K). Table 7.3.1 shows the thermal conductivities of a number of common materials.

Clothing, Insulation, and Climate

Equation 7.3.1 tells us that the amount of heat flowing through your skin depends on its
thermal conductivity, surface area, thickness, and the temperature difference across it.
Amazingly, your body has optimized these factors to help you minimize heat loss. Even
without clothes, you are surprisingly well insulated against conductive heat loss.
Your skin and the layers immediately beneath it contain fats and other thermal insulators. Fatâs thermal conductivity is quite low, about a third that of water, so by placing fat in
and just beneath your skin, your body improves its heat retention. Furthermore, the presence of a fatty layer beneath your skin effectively thickens your skin and increases the
distance separating hot from cold. âThick-skinnedâ people retain body heat better than
those who are âthin-skinned.â
Minimizing surface area means that your body is relatively compact, shaped more like
a ball than a sheet. Although other adaptive influences have given you arms, legs, and fingers, which increase your total surface area, you have little superfluous surface through
which to lose heat.
Finally, your body tries to lessen conductive heat loss by reducing the temperature difference between your skin and the surrounding air. It does this by letting your hands and feet
become much cooler than your core body temperature. That arrangement would be simple
were it not for your circulating blood. Your blood must cool down from core body temperature
as it approaches your cold fingers and warm back up to core body temperature as it returns to
your heart. This change in blood temperature occurs via a mechanism called countercurrent
exchange. As the warm blood flows through arteries toward your cold fingers, it transfers heat
to the blood returning to your heart through nearby veins (Fig. 7.3.1). The blood heading
toward your fingers becomes colder, while the blood returning to your heart becomes warmer.
Check Your Understanding #2: Hot Potatoes
You have been cooking potatoes in a pot of boiling water, and itâs time to fish them out. With which
are you least likely to burn your hands: copper tongs or stainless steel tongs?
Answer: Stainless steel tongs are less likely to burn you.
Why: The rate at which heat flows from the hotter water to your colder hand is proportional to the
tongsâ thermal conductivity, and stainless steel has a much lower thermal conductivity than copper.

Check Your Figures #1: Cold Hard Brick
You are visiting a tiny fifteenth-century house that was built entirely of bricks. Its walls have a surface
area of 20 m2 (215 ft2), and the bricks are 9.2 cm (358 in) thick. When the winter air outside is â20 Â°C
and the heated air inside is 20 Â°C, at what rate is heat flowing through the walls of the house?
Answer: 5200 W.
Why: According to Table 7.3.1, the thermal conductivity of brick is 0.6 W/m â K. The temperature
difference between the inside and outside of each brick is 40 Â°C, or, equivalently, 40 K. From Eq.
7.3.1, we obtain:
heat flow =

0.6 W/m Âˇ K Âˇ 40 K Âˇ 20 m2
= 5217 W.
0.092 m

Because of the limited accuracy of our starting values, we round the result to 5200 W. That is an
enormous rate of heat loss, and we havenât even considered losses through the roof. This house needs
insulation!

Staying Warm by Impeding Convection
Despite its great insulating qualities, skin alone isnât enough to keep you warm in all situations. Some of your body heat inevitably flows to the surface of your skin and from there
to your environment. Limiting that second step of heat flow is a job for clothing.

CHAPT ER 7 Heat and Phase Transitions

On a cold day, heat leaving your skin warms the nearby air. Since air is a very poor
conductor of heat, however, your skin warms only a thin layer of it. If that warmed air never
moved, you would have to heat it only once and that would be that. Protected by this insulating layer of air, your skin would no longer have to transport much heat and the temperature difference across your skin would shrink. You would feel warm.
But air moves all too easily. In reality, each time your skin manages to warm the
nearby air, natural convection gently lifts that warmed air upward and replaces it with fresh
cold air. The temperature difference across your skin thus remains large, and heat flows
quickly out through your skin. You feel cold.
Wind worsens this heat loss because it blows away warmed air near your skin even
faster than does natural convection. Just as a forced convection oven cooks food faster, so
a forced convection freezer (such as a cold, windy day) chills people faster. The enhanced
heat loss caused by moving air is called wind chillâyou feel even colder on a windy day.
To combat convective heat loss and wind chill, most warm-blooded animals are covered
with hair or feathers. These finely structured materials are poor conductors of heat, but their
main purpose is actually to trap an even better insulator: air. In the dense tangle of a sheepâs
wool, air experiences such severe drag forces that it can barely move at all. Since convection
requires airflow, the sheep can lose heat only via conduction through the trapped air and
wool. That combination of materials is a terrible conductor of heat, so the sheep stays warm.
We humans have relatively little hair and are thus poorly adapted to living in cold,
windy climates. Our lack of natural insulation is one of the reasons we wear clothing. Like
hair and feathers, our clothing traps the air and reduces convection. Finely divided strands
or filaments are particularly effective at stopping the flow of air. Not surprisingly, the best
insulating clothing is made of hair (natural or synthetic) and feathers (also natural or synthetic). Since motionless air has a lower thermal conductivity than any of the materials that
trap it, the ideal coat uses only enough material to keep a thick layer of air from moving.
This discussion also applies to swimming in cold water. If the water near your skin
would stay put, you could warm up a layer of it and then feel relatively warm. Thatâs why
some swimmers wear wet suits. The spongy material in a wet suit keeps the layer of water
near the swimmerâs skin from moving. As long it remains in place, water is a respectable
thermal insulator.
Check Your Understanding #3: When a Cold Wind Blows
Why does wearing a thin nylon windbreaker make such a difference in your ability to keep warm on
a cool, windy day?
Answer: It traps a layer of insulating air near your skin.
Why: Even though the windbreaker is too thin to provide much insulation itself, it traps air near your
skin. With much less circulation of cold air across your skin, you lose heat more slowly and feel
relatively warm.

More about Thermal Radiation
When you sit in front of a glowing fire, you feel its thermal radiation warming your skin.
But your skin also emits thermal radiation, so what youâre really noticing is that your skin
is absorbing more thermal radiation from the fire than itâs emitting toward your surroundings. Youâre gaining heat. In contrast, if you sit inside an ice sculpture castle, your skin will
absorb less thermal radiation from the ice than itâs emitting, so youâll be losing heat and
feeling cold.
Short of walking back and forth between fire and ice, how can you control how much
heat you gain or lose via thermal radiation? More broadly, what determines how much
thermal power you radiate toward your environment and how much you absorb from it? To
answer these questions, we need to take a closer look at thermal radiation itself.

Youâve probably noticed that you can often judge the temperature of a hot object by
the color of the light it emits. An object thatâs glowing red is too hot to touch, but one thatâs
glowing yellow-white is a serious fire hazard. That connection between temperature and
color isnât a coincidence. The light that you see emanating from a hot object is part of that
objectâs thermal radiation. You are quite literally seeing its heat.
However, youâre not seeing all of its heat. Although thermal radiation consists of electromagnetic waves and you can see some electromagnetic waves, most are invisible to your
eyes. Those that you can see, visible light, are part of a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic radiation that extends from radio waves at one extreme to gamma rays at the other
(Fig. 7.3.2).
Electromagnetic waves are distinguished by their wavelengths, that is, the distances
between their wave crests. You can easily recognize the wavelength for the waves on a lake
or sea, where the crests are visible and you can directly measure the distance from one to
the next. Although the wave crests of electromagnetic waves arenât so easy to observe, they
exist and itâs possible to measure the distance between them. Moreover, within the visible
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 7.3.3), you perceive different wavelengths
of light as different colors. Light with a wavelength of 630 nanometers (billionths of a
meter, abbreviated nm) appears red, while light at 420 nm appears blue.
However, an objectâs thermal radiation isnât a single electromagnetic wave with one
specific wavelength. Instead, itâs many individual waves that cover a broad range of wavelengths. The distribution of those wavelengths depends on the objectâs temperature and
surface properties, particularly its emissivity, the efficiency with which it emits and absorbs
thermal radiation. Emissivity is measured on a scale from 0 to 1, with 1 being ideal efficiency. A perfectly black object has an emissivity of 1; it absorbs all light that strikes it and
emits thermal light as efficiently as possible.
The distribution of wavelengths emitted by a black object is determined by its temperature alone and is called a blackbody spectrum. As shown in Fig. 7.3.4, that spectrum
brightens and shifts toward shorter wavelengths as the objectâs temperature increases. When
a black object is colder than about 400 Â°C, its thermal radiation lies entirely in the invisible
long-wavelength portion of the spectrum and you canât see the radiation at all. Even at
400 Â°C, only your night vision is able to sense the thermal radiation, which appears dim and
colorless. At about 500 Â°C, your color vision begins to detect the glow and your eyes make
an average assessment of the distribution of wavelengths. You see dull red. With increasing
temperature, you then observe reddish, orangish, yellowish, whitish, and eventually bluish

light (Table 7.3.2). The temperature of thermal radiation associated with a particular distribution of wavelengths is the color temperature of that light.
Whether visible or not, the entire spectrum of thermal radiation is important to retaining body heat. Your body radiates thermal power and if your radiated power is greater than
the thermal power you absorb from your environment, you are losing heat via radiation.
The thermal power you radiate depends primarily on your temperature. Itâs clear from
Fig. 7.3.4 that a black object radiates more power as its temperature increases. What may
be surprising, however, is how dramatically that radiated power increases with temperature: it is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature! Thus, although a
black pot full of boiling water (373 K) and an identical black pot full of ice water (273 K)
have an absolute temperature ratio of only 1.37, the hotter one radiates 1.374, or 3.5, times
as much thermal power as the cooler one.

Your radiated power also depends on your surface area and on your emissivity, and it
is proportional to each of those quantities. The precise relationship between temperature
and radiated power can be written as a word equation:
radiated power = emissivity Âˇ StefanâBoltzmann constant
Âˇ temperature4 Âˇ surface area,

(7.3.2)

in symbols:
P = e â Ď â T 4 â A,
and in everyday language:
Hot food radiates away lots of heat, so wrap it compactly in aluminum foil
to keep it warm.
This relationship is called the StefanâBoltzmann law, and the StefanâBoltzmann constant (Ď) that appears in it has a measured value of 5.67 Ă 10â8 J/(s â m2 â K4). Remember
that the temperature must be measured in kelvins.
Your skin temperature and your surface area arenât hard to measure, but what is your
emissivity for radiating heat? Prepare for a surprise. Looking at a surface tells you only
about its high-temperature emissivityâhow well it absorbs visible thermal radiation from
a very hot object (such as the 5800 K sun) and would emit visible thermal radiation if it
were heated red, yellow, or white hot. Your skinâs temperature is only 307 K, however, so
its thermal radiation depends on its low-temperature emissivityâhow well it absorbs and
emits invisible long-wavelength infrared light.
Now for the surprise: regardless of your appearance in visible light, your skin is almost
perfectly black at the infrared wavelengths of skin-temperature thermal radiation! Your
skinâs low-temperature emissivity is approximately 0.97. In fact, most nonmetallic objects
have low-temperature emissivities greater than 0.95. If you could see infrared light rather
than visible light, all the people and most of the objects around you would look blackâyou
would see that they absorb almost all the infrared light that strikes them and that they glow
brightly with their own infrared thermal radiation.
Check Your Understanding #4: Seeing Your Outer Glow
Passive infrared sensors are commonly used to turn on lights when a person walks by. They sense
changes in long-wavelength infrared light. How do they recognize a person in total darkness?
Answer: Both the person and his environment radiate infrared light, but because the personâs
temperature is different from his surroundings, his infrared brightness is also different.
Why: The sensor responds to the thermal radiation emitted by the objects in front of it. As the person
walks by, the brightness and pattern of that thermal radiation change and the sensor switches on the light.

Check Your Figures #2: De-Lighted at the Blacksmithâs Shop
When a blacksmith pulls a piece of yellow-hot steel out of the furnace, its temperature plummets and
it dims rapidly. However, it remains too hot to touch for several minutes. How much faster does the
steel cool by radiation at 800 Â°C than it does at 400 Â°C? (Assume the steelâs emissivity doesnât
depend on temperature.)
Answer: The steel cools about 6.46 times as fast at 800 Â°C.
Why: We first convert the two temperatures to Kelvin: 1073 K and 673 K, respectively. We then find
the ratio of the radiated powers at these two temperatures by dividing Eq. 7.3.2 for 1073 K by that
same equation for 673 K:

Staying Warm by Controlling Thermal Radiation
The average temperature of human skin is about 307 K (34 Â°C or 93 Â°F), and a typical person has a body surface area of about 1.8 m2 (19 ft2). Assuming an emissivity of 0.97, the
StefanâBoltzmann law predicts that a person will radiate about 850 W of thermal power. If
you actually lost heat that fast, youâd cool off quickly and be very uncomfortable. Thus,
limiting radiative heat loss is important to maintaining your body temperature.
Fortunately, everything around you is also emitting thermal radiation, and you typically absorb about as much thermal power as you emit. You even absorb some of your own
thermal radiation. If you hold your hand in front of your face on a cold day, youâll feel its
thermal radiation warming your face.
However, whenever thereâs a temperature difference between you and your environment, heat will flow from hotter to colder every way it can, including radiation. While
conduction and convection transfer heat in proportion to the difference in temperature,
radiation transfers heat in proportion to the difference between the fourth powers of the
absolute temperatures. That exotic relationship between temperatures and heat flow
explains why radiative heat transfer to or from your skin is most noticeable when youâre
exposed to unusually hot or cold objects.
For example, the sun warms your skin quickly because it radiates more heat at you
than the rest of your surroundings combined. Measured on an absolute temperature scale,
the sunâs surface temperature (5800 K) is about 20 times that of your skin (307 K). Though
itâs very distant and appears small to your eye, the sun radiates about 204, or 160,000, times
as much heat at you as you radiate at it.
In contrast, the dark night sky cools you quickly because itâs actually colder than your
surroundings. The nearly empty space beyond Earthâs atmosphere is only a few degrees
above absolute zero, and even with the atmosphereâs considerable help, the skyâs effective
radiant temperature is still about 20 Â°C colder than the air around you. When you lie on the
snow in an open field and look up at the clear night sky, your 307-K skin radiates about
twice as much heat at the approximately 250-K sky as it radiates back at you. You lose heat
quickly and feel cold.
You can improve your situation by moving under a sheltering pine tree. Although the
tree is no warmer than the snow, itâs about 20 Â°C hotter than the sky and therefore emits
more thermal radiation at you. Although the tree isnât quite a crackling campfire, it will still
help to keep you warm.
That said, we still have you running back and forth between hot and cold objects to
keep warm. Itâs time to look at how you can control thermal radiation while staying in
one place.
You can start by wearing a heavy coat. The coatâs internal insulation allows its outer
surface to cool down to the temperature of your environment, so that it radiates only a little
more thermal power than it absorbs and doesnât lose much heat. This strategy is common
in birds and mammals. Penguins and polar bears let the outsides of their insulated feathers
and fur cool to the temperatures of their frozen worlds and therefore lose almost no heat by
radiation.
You can also change your emissivity to control radiative heat transfer. Weâve seen that
black surfaces are ideal whenever you want to exchange thermal radiation with other
objects, but what about when you donât want to exchange thermal energy? Thatâs where
shiny, white, and transparent surfaces come into play.
A perfectly shiny or white surface has an emissivity of zero; it reflects all of the light
that strikes it, absorbing none, and is itself unable to emit any thermal radiation. If you put
a shiny or white surface between yourself and a snowman, youâll each see your own thermal radiation coming back at you and you wonât exchange any heat. This insulating effect
works even if one of you wears the shiny or white surface as clothing; whoever is wearing
it wonât emit thermal radiation at all, and the other will see his or her own thermal radiation
returned by that clothing.

Fig. 7.3.5 This silver coffee urn may not seem to be insulated,
but it is. Its polished silver surface is so shiny that it is an
almost perfect mirror for infrared and visible light. As a result,
it neither emits nor absorbs room-temperature thermal radiation
well. Moreover, the air near the urnâs vertical sides forms tall
convection cells that arenât very efficient at carrying heat away
from the urn. Overall, the urn loses heat much more slowly than
it would if it were black and had fewer vertical surfaces.

Unfortunately, while truly white clothing would make you immune to radiant heat
transfer, such clothing doesnât exist. Clothing exemplifies the difference between hightemperature and low-temperature emissivities. Regardless of their colors in visible light,
virtually all clothing materials are black to infrared light and have low-temperature emissivities close to 1. In other words, most clothes absorb and emit low-temperature thermal
radiation almost perfectly. Thus, although wearing a white robe on a scorching summer day
will reduce the amount of thermal radiation you absorb directly from the sun because the
robeâs high-temperature emissivity is nearly 0, it wonât protect you from the sun-warmed
objects around you because its low-temperature emissivity is nearly 1.
In contrast, shiny clothing can protect you from those sun-warmed objects, but only if it
contains metals. Metals have small low-temperature emissivities because they conduct electricity, a property that allows them to reflect electromagnetic waves extremely well. When
you wrap food in aluminum foil, its emissivity drops to about 0.05 and it can barely exchange
heat by radiation (Fig. 7.3.5). Wearing metallic clothes has the same effect for people. LamĂŠ
fabricsâfabrics with metal threads woven into themâhelp to keep their typically underdressed wearers warm. A less flamboyant use of metallic cloth is in the-metal-coated plastic
blankets that are part of emergency rescue kits; wrapping yourself in one of these blankets
shiny-side out keeps you from exchanging thermal radiation with your surroundings (see 2 ).
Transparent materials also have emissivities near 0 and neither absorb nor emit thermal
radiation well. Unlike shiny or white surfaces, however, transparent materials avoid absorbing thermal radiation by letting it pass through them. For example, when sunlight streams
through a window to warm your skin, itâs obvious that glass doesnât absorb much of the
sunâs thermal radiation. As for emission, any artist who sculpts molten glass knows from
painful experience that glass provides almost no visible warning that itâs extremely hot.
However, emissivity once again varies with temperature. Nearly all the materials that are
transparent to the visible light of high-temperature thermal radiation, including glass, are black
to the infrared light of low-temperature thermal radiation. Thatâs probably just as well for clothing because clothing thatâs transparent to thermal radiation wouldnât provide much insulation.
Check Your Understanding #5: Foil Wrapping
Wrapping a hot dish of food in shiny aluminum foil seems to keep the dish warm longer than wrapping it in clear plastic film. Aluminum is a much better conductor of heat than plastic, so why does
it impede the flow of heat so well?
Answer: The aluminum foil prevents the dish from losing heat to its environment via thermal radiation.
Why: Both wraps insulate by trapping air, not by preventing heat from conducting through the wrap
itself. Theyâre both too thin to permit much of a temperature difference between their inner and outer
surfaces, despite their huge difference in thermal conductivities. In the case of the aluminum foil,
however, aluminumâs low emissivity also prevents it from exchanging thermal radiation with the food
or with the surroundings.

The goal of housing insulation is to limit heat flow into or out of a house so that the temperature inside the house is nearly independent of the temperature outside. Itâs based on the
same insulating concepts that help keep people and animals warm, but because houses and
their contents rarely move, they can employ insulating methods and materials that are
heavy, bulky, rigid, or fragile.
While there are many solid materials that are poor conductors of heat, including glass,
plastic, wood, sand, and brick, they arenât nearly as insulating as air. Of course, since air
tends to undergo convection, it needs to be held in place by porous or fibrous materials such
as glass wool, sawdust, plastic foam, or narrow channels. Trapped air is the primary insulation in most buildings.
Glass wool or fiberglass is made by spinning molten glass into long, thin fibers that are
then matted together like cotton candy. Solid glass is already a poor conductor of heat, but
reducing it to fibers makes it even more insulating. The path that heat must take as itâs
conducted through the tangled fibers is so long and circuitous that little heat gets through.
Most of the volume in glass wool is taken up by trapped air. The glass fibers keep the air
from undergoing convection so the air can carry heat only by conduction.
Together, glass wool and the air trapped in it make excellent insulation. Since theyâre
also nonflammable, they are commonly used in ovens, hot-water heaters, and other hightemperature appliances. Most modern houses have about 10â20 cm (4â8 in) of glass wool
insulation built into their outside walls, along with a vapor barrier to keep the wind from
blowing air directly through the insulation. (For a discussion of older insulating techniques,
see Fig. 7.3.6.)
Because hot air rises and cold air sinks, the temperature difference between the hot air
below the ceiling of the top floor and the cold air above that ceiling can become quite large
during the winter. That ceiling is thus a very important site of unwanted heat transfer and
requires heavy insulation. Glass wool inserted above the ceiling of the top floor in a modern
house may be more than 30 cm (12 in) thick (Fig. 7.3.7).
While glass wool is an excellent insulator, other materials are used in certain situations. Urethane foam and polystyrene foam are waterproof, windproof, and even better
insulators than glass wool. Unfortunately, theyâre also flammable and fragile. Nonetheless,
they are frequently used in buildings and in refrigerators and freezers, where condensation
makes waterproof insulation a necessity. Polystyrene foam also makes insulating cups that
keep hot coffee hot and cold drinks cold. Unfortunately, polystyrene foam is hard to recycle, so many coffee shops now use alternatives that are less insulating but more environmentally friendly.

Check Your Understanding #6: Is More Always Better?
Glass wool insulation is easily compressed so that you can put two or three layers into the space that
one layer will normally fill. To improve a buildingâs insulation, why not pack as much glass wool
insulation into the walls as possible?
Answer: The glass woolâs purpose is to trap air so that the air can act as the insulation. Glass is a
better conductor of heat than air, so adding more glass wool will actually reduce the insulating effect.
Why: Commercial glass wool is designed to thwart convection in air while minimizing conduction
through the glass. The wool is just dense enough to keep the air in place. Overpacking the wool will
reduce its insulation and add weight and expense to the construction.

Modern Insulating Windows
Since windows have to be transparent, they canât be filled with fiberglass or foam, and a
window made of solid glass is a poor insulator unless itâs extremely thick. Insulating windows requires a different approach.
The most common way to insulate a window is to use two thin panes of glass that are
spaced a centimeter or two apart. That vertical gap is typically filled with argon gas, which is
an even poorer conductor of heat than air (see Table 7.3.1). Although convection occurs inside
the gap, the convection cells that form are tall and thin and therefore relatively ineffective at
carrying heat from one pane to the other. When properly designed, assembled, and installed,
a double-pane window transports relatively little heat by conduction or convection.
What about radiative heat transfer? Alas, this turns out to be a big problem. Although
ordinary glass is clear to visible light, it has a low-temperature emissivity of 0.92 and is
nearly black to long-wavelength infrared light. Thus the glass panes of a conventional
double-pane window are exchanging thermal radiation with almost perfect efficiency. If
thereâs a big temperature difference between the inside and outside panes, heat will flow
via thermal radiation from the hotter pane to the colder pane and spoil the windowâs insulating behavior.
To decrease this radiant heat flow, an energy-efficient low-emissivity (Low-E) window
has a thin coating applied to the inner surface of one of its panes. That coating makes the
paneâs surface behave like a shiny mirror for infrared light; it emits very little thermal radiation, and it reflects back most of what it receives from the other pane. The coating doesnât
reflect visible light, though, so the window still looks clear. Known as a âheat mirrorâ
because it reflects only low-temperature thermal radiation, this coating dramatically reduces
the flow of radiant heat through the window.
One of the most common Low-E coatings is indium-tin-oxide, a transparent electrical
conductor thatâs also widely used in electronic displays for watches and computers. Like a
metal, indium-tin-oxide uses its electrical conductivity to reflect electromagnetic waves. It
has a low-temperature emissivity of about 0.10, so itâs almost as reflective as aluminum
foil. However, because indium-tin-oxideâs conductivity is limited, it can respond only to
long-wavelength electromagnetic waves. It reflects low-temperature thermal radiation but
transmits visible light.
By suppressing all three heat transfer mechanisms, a Low-E window is able to provide
surprisingly good insulation. The temperature of its outer pane matches the outdoor temperature and the temperature of its inner pane matches the indoor temperature, yet little
heat flows through the gap between those panes.
One potential problem for Low-E windows is leakage. If the argon gas escapes from
between the two panes and is replaced by moist air, the heat mirror coating may degrade
and the window can become foggy. Keeping the window assembly perfectly sealed for
decades is a challenge, particularly when that assembly is subject to large changes in temperature. The metals, plastics, and glass used in the window assembly donât all expand
equally as they warm up, and the assembly can literally tear itself apart.

Average separation
Fig. 7.3.8 The thermal
kinetic energy of a
solid increases with
temperature, causing
its atoms to bounce
against one another more
vigorously. As they vibrate,
the atoms repel more
strongly than they attract,
so their average separation
increases slightly.

A materialâs thermal expansion is caused by atomic vibrations. Because of thermal
energy, adjacent atoms vibrate back and forth about their equilibrium separations (Fig.
7.3.8). This vibrational motion isnât symmetrical; the repulsive forces the atoms experience
when theyâre too close together are stiffer than the attractive forces they experience when
theyâre too far apart. As a result of this asymmetry, they push apart more quickly than they
draw together and thus spend most of their time at more than their equilibrium separation.
On average, their actual separation is larger than their equilibrium separation, and the
material containing them is bigger than it would be without thermal energy.
As an objectâs temperature rises, it grows larger in all directions. The extent to which
it expands with increasing temperature is normally described by its coefficient of volume
expansion, the fractional change in the objectâs volume per unit of temperature increase.
Fractional change in volume is the net change in volume divided by the total volume. Since
most materials expand only a small amount when becoming 1 Â°C (or 1 K) hotter, coefficients of volume expansion are small, typically about 2.5 Ă 10â5 Kâ1 for glass , 5 Ă 10â5
Kâ1 for metals, and 2 Ă 10â4 Kâ1 for plastics.
As the window assembly heats up, its plastics expand more than its metals, which
expand more than its glass. Those differences in expansion put stresses on the components
and can separate them or break them. Making an assembly that tolerates thousands of
warming and cooling cycles without leaking is no small feat.

Check Your Understanding #7: Cool Light
To provide bright white light and almost no unnecessary heat, a special lamp uses a heat mirror. What
does that heat mirror do?
Answer: The heat mirror reflects infrared light back toward the actual light source while allowing the
visible light to continue on to its destination.
Why: The heat mirror transmits only visible light, so it reflects away infrared light that would simply
add unnecessary heat to the lampâs output.

Earthâs Temperature and the Greenhouse Effect
Despite variations with time, place, and season, Earthâs overall surface temperature has a
fairly constant average value of about 15 Â°C (59 Â°F). To maintain that constant average
temperature, Earth must avoid gaining or losing heat. A net flow of heat to Earth would
increase its average temperature, while a net flow from Earth would decrease its temperature. In short, Earth must balance any heat it receives with an equal amount of heat it emits.
Earthâs main source of heat is the sun, and this heat reaches Earth almost entirely as
electromagnetic radiation. Because the sunâs surface temperature is about 5800 K, solar
radiation is primarily visible light, although it also includes a substantial amount of infrared
and ultraviolet light (Fig. 7.3.4). The total solar power reaching Earth is about 1.74 Ă 1017 W.
For comparison, the worldâs total electric-generating capacity is roughly 3 Ă 1012 W.
While about 30% of the sunlight is simply reflected or scattered back from Earthâs
surface and atmosphere, the remaining 1.21 Ă 1017 W is absorbed by Earthâs surface and
atmosphere. Earth must get rid of that heat by radiating it into cold, dark space as blackbody radiation. To radiate 1.21 Ă 1017 W of thermal power, Earthâs radiating surfaceâthe
effective source of its blackbody radiationâmust have a temperature of about â18 Â°C
(0 Â°F). So while Earth receives heat as mostly visible sunlight, it reemits that heat as invisible infrared light.
If there were no atmosphere, Earthâs radiating surface would be the ground itself and
the average temperature of that ground would be about â18 Â°C. But Earth does have an
atmosphere, and even though that atmosphere is nearly transparent to visible light, it
absorbs and emits infrared light fairly well. Earthâs principal source of thermal radiation

Clothing, Insulation, and Climate

therefore isnât the ground but the atmosphere. In fact, Earthâs radiating surface is located
about 5 km (3 miles) above the ground, and it is the air at that altitude that has the â18 Â°C
average temperature!
This displacement of Earthâs radiating surface from ground level to an elevated layer
in the atmosphere gives rise to the greenhouse effect. Since the ground itself isnât responsible for radiating away Earthâs excess heat, its temperature doesnât have to be â18 Â°C.
Also because the atmosphere naturally develops a temperature gradient of about â6.6 Â°C
per kilometer of altitude (see 3 ), the ground 5 km below Earthâs radiating surface is about
33 Â°C hotter, or roughly 15 Â°C.
Since life would be difficult at â18 Â°C, we are fortunate to have the greenhouse effect.
However, too large a greenhouse effect would be disastrous. If the atmosphere were to
become even more effective at absorbing and emitting infrared light, the altitude of Earthâs
radiating surface would increase and so would the temperature at Earthâs surface. It is
critical to our climate that this altitude stay about 5 km and not rise to 6 km or more.
Just how effective Earthâs atmosphere is at absorbing and emitting infrared light
depends on its chemical makeup. Nitrogen and oxygen molecules, though extremely common in the atmosphere, are remarkably transparent to both infrared and visible light. Itâs
the less common, more complicated gas molecules that allow air to absorb and emit infrared light and are thus greenhouse gases.
Although the principal greenhouse gas is water vapor, gases such as carbon dioxide,
methane, and nitrous oxide are also extremely important. Each gas absorbs its own characteristic portions of the infrared spectrum, and together they darken the atmosphere to infrared light the way a mixture of watercolors darkens a canvas to visible light. The more
greenhouse gases the atmosphere contains, the higher the altitude of Earthâs radiating surface and the warmer Earthâs surface.
There is now overwhelming scientific evidence that human production of greenhouse
gases, particularly carbon dioxide, is causing a rapid warming of Earthâs surface and a
change in its climate. That climate change will be severe unless we dramatically reduce
greenhouse emissions now. Since burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide, our current
approach to using those fuels must change. Atmospheric methane is generated primarily by
digestive bacteria in cows, and reducing it will require changes to the cattle and dairy
industries. There are other gases that we have been releasing casually into the atmosphere
for years, including refrigerants and aerosol propellants, that turn out to be especially
potent greenhouse gases and donât belong in the atmosphere. Alas, maintaining the environment turns out to be much harder than people thought at the dawn of the industrial
revolution. We reap what we sow.
Check Your Understanding #8: Canned Heat
When you use a can of spray paint, its propellant (typically propane and butane) immediately enters
the atmosphere. As the paint dries, its solvents also enter the atmosphere. How do these gases affect
the atmosphereâs transparency in the infrared?
Answer: All these gas molecules darken the atmosphere in the infrared.
Why: Most of the chemicals in your spray can end up in the atmosphere, where they increase its
efficiency at emitting and absorbing infrared light and therefore contribute to the greenhouse effect.

Epilogue for Chapter 7
This chapter has examined the roles of thermal energy and heat in a variety of common
objects. In Woodstoves, we saw how combustion converts ordered chemical potential energy
into disordered thermal energy and we studied the ways in which this thermal energy flows
into the woodstoveâs surroundings: conduction, convection, and radiation. In Water, Steam,
and Ice, we examined the three phases of matter and looked at how the transformations

between those phases are influenced by temperature, heat, and other characteristics of their
environment. In Clothing, Insulation, and Climate, we examined the laws governing heat
flow and found out how to limit that flow. We then used that understanding to explain the
greenhouse effect and the ways humans are contributing to climate change.

Explanation: A Ruler Thermometer
Like most things, the clear plastic ruler expands when you heat it. Its length increases by an
amount proportional to its increase in temperature. When you transfer heat to the ruler, by
breathing on it, touching it, or exposing it to a hair dryer, its temperature rises, it expands,
and its free end turns the needle and pointer. Since the pointerâs movement is proportional to
the rulerâs length change, itâs also proportional to the thermometerâs change in temperature.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Woodstoves Work: A woodstove burns wood in air to obtain hot gas. The burning process
is actually a chemical reaction in which molecules in the wood and air are disassembled into
fragments and then reassembled into new, more tightly bound molecules such as water and
carbon dioxide. This reassembly process releases more energy than was required to disassemble the original wood and oxygen molecules. This extra energy appears as thermal energy
within the reaction products, so theyâre hot. Rather than distributing the hot burned gas directly to the room, a woodstove transfers heat from the burned gas to clean air or water. Heat
is conducted through the walls of a woodstove and then flows into the room via convection
and radiation.
How Water, Steam, and Ice Work: Water, steam, and ice are the liquid, gaseous, and solid
phases of the chemical we call water. The water molecules in liquid water are bound together
strongly enough to fix waterâs volume, but not strongly enough to give water a rigid shape. In
steam, the water molecules are independent and the gas has neither a fixed shape nor a fixed
volume. The molecules in ice are bound together rigidly in solid crystals, so ice is rigid and
its volume is constant.
Ice can transform into water, or vice versa, at its melting temperature. Heat added to ice
at this temperature causes it to melt without becoming warmer. Heat removed from water at
this temperature causes it to freeze without becoming colder. Similarly, water and ice can
transform into steam, or vice versa, through evaporation, condensation, sublimation, and
deposition. Turning water into steam requires heat, and this heat is released when the steam
turns back into water. Boiling is a special case of evaporation in which evaporation occurs
within the body of the water itself. For boiling to occur, the waterâs vapor pressure must equal
the ambient pressure on the water, which is normally atmospheric pressure.
How Clothing, Insulation, and Climate Work: Clothing serves as insulation for people, helping them maintain their body temperatures in inhospitable environments. Most clothes are
constructed out of threads and other fibrous materials that not only are poor conductors of
heat but also trap air so that it can act as the primary insulation. The outer surface of thick
clothing has nearly the same temperature as its surroundings and therefore exchanges little
heat via radiation.
Building insulation reduces heat flow between inside and outside. The insulation in
walls and ceilings consists primarily of air trapped in fibrous or porous materials such as
glass wool and urethane foam, but the insulation in windows is necessarily different. The
narrow, gas-filled gap between doubled panes in a modern window limits the heat that can
flow between the panes by conduction and convection, while a low-emissivity coating on one
of the panes limits radiative heat transfer.

Earthâs climate is determined in large part by how it eliminates the heat it receives from
the sun. That heat is emitted into space as infrared thermal radiation, mostly by Earthâs
atmosphere. The average temperature at Earthâs surface increases in proportion to the effective altitude from which that thermal radiation is emitted. Since greenhouse gases darken the
atmosphere to infrared light and increase that altitude, they warm Earthâs surface. Human
production of such gases is changing Earthâs climate.

mountain. But not everything in nature permits heat to flow passively. Our technological
world includes many devices that actively transfer heat from colder objects to hotter objects or that
use the flow of heat to do useful work. In this chapter, we examine the rules governing the movement of heat, a field of physics known as thermodynamics.

Fog occurs naturally when humid air experiences a sudden drop in temperature. To make fog in a bottle, youâll
need to do the same thing: cool humid air quickly. In a
room where everything is at the same temperature, cooling air sounds impossible. Itâs not.

In this chapter, we examine the movement of heat in two everyday machines: (1) air conditioners and (2) automobiles. In Air
Conditioners, we look at the rules governing the movement of
thermal energyâthe laws of thermodynamicsâand see how
those rules permit an air conditioner to use ordered electric
energy to transfer heat from the cold room air to the hot outdoor
air. In Automobiles, we investigate the ways in which thermal
energy can be used to do work and see how the engine is able
to convert thermal energy into work as heat flows from the
hot burning fuel to the cold outdoor air. For additional preview

The principles illustrated by these two machines are also
found in many other places. Refrigerators and home heat
pumps use ordered energy to transfer heat from cold objects
to hot objects, and steam engines and hot-air balloons use the
natural flow of heat to make things move. Once you understand the concepts behind these heat pumps and heat
engines, youâll see that theyâre quite common in the world
around you.

On a summer day, your problem isnât staying warm; itâs keeping
cool. Instead of looking for something to burn in your woodstove, you turn on your air conditioner. An air conditioner is a
device that cools room air by removing some of its thermal
energy. The air conditioner, however, canât make thermal
energy either disappear or become ordered energy. Instead, it
transfers thermal energy from the cooler room air to the warmer
air outside. Since the air conditioner transfers heat against its
natural direction of flow, the air conditioner is a heat pump. Itâs

Questions to Think About: Why doesnât heat naturally flow
from a colder object to a hotter object? An air conditioner
removes thermal energy from room air, so why does the air
conditioner require electric energy to operate? Where does this
electric energy go? Why does an air conditioner always have an
indoor component and an outdoor component? If you put a
window air conditioner in the middle of a room and turn it on,
what will happen to the temperature of the room?
Experiments to Do: Take a look at a window air conditioner. If you
canât find one, examine a refrigerator instead because itâs basically
a powerful air conditioner cooling a food-storage closet. As the air
conditioner (or refrigerator) operates, feel the air leaving the indoor
air vent (or inside the refrigerator) and compare its temperature to
that of air leaving the outdoor air vent (or near the metal coils on
the back of the refrigerator). Which way does the cooling mechanism move heat? If that mechanism were absent, which way would
heat flow? Turn off the air conditioner or refrigerator, and observe
the resulting heat flow. Did you confirm your prediction?

Moving Heat Around: Thermodynamics
On a sweltering summer day, the air in your home becomes unpleasantly hot. Heat enters
your home from outdoors and doesnât stop flowing until itâs as hot inside as it is outside.
You can make your home more comfortable by getting rid of some of its thermal energy.
Although weâve already looked at ways to add thermal energy to room air, we havenât yet
learned how to remove it. At present, the only cooling method weâve discussed is contact
with a colder object. Unless you have an icehouse nearby, you need another scheme for
eliminating thermal energy. You need an air conditioner.
An air conditioner transfers heat against its natural direction of flow. Heat moves
from the colder air in your home to the hotter air outside so that your home gets colder
while the outdoor air gets hotter. Thereâs a cost to transferring heat in this manner.
The air conditioner requires ordered energy to operate and typically consumes large

210

CHAPT ER 8 Thermodynamics

amounts of electric energy. Itâs a type of heat pump, a device that uses ordered energy
to transfer heat from a colder object to a hotter object, against its natural direction
of flow.
Before studying how an air conditioner pumps heat, we should first show that pumping
is necessary. There are three harebrained cooling alternatives that we need to discredit
before turning to air conditioning:
1. Letting heat flow from your home to your neighborâs home.
2. Destroying some of your homeâs thermal energy.
3. Converting some of your homeâs thermal energy into electric energy.

Fig. 8.1.1 Although they
are touching, no heat is
flowing between the red
bottle and the blue bottle.
Similarly, no heat is flowing
between the red bottle and
the green bottle. Based on
those two observations, the
law of thermal equilibrium
states that no heat will flow
between the blue bottle
and the green bottle when
they touch.

Weâll find it useful to examine each of these alternatives because, in doing so,
weâll learn about the laws governing the movement of thermal energy, the laws of
thermodynamics.
The first alternative raises an interesting issue. Your home is in thermal equilibrium
with the outdoor air, meaning that no heat flows from one to the other and theyâre at the
same temperature. Your neighborâs home is also in thermal equilibrium with the outdoor
air. What will happen if you permit heat to flow between your home and your neighborâs
home? Nothing. Since both homes are simultaneously in thermal equilibrium with the outdoor air, theyâre also in thermal equilibrium with one another. All three are at the same
temperature.
This observation is an example of the law of thermal equilibrium (often called the
zeroth law of thermodynamics), which says that two objects that are each in thermal
equilibrium with a third object are also in thermal equilibrium with one another (Fig. 8.1.1).
This seemingly obvious law is the basis for a meaningful system of temperatures. If you
had a roomful of objects at 35 Â°C (95 Â°F) and some were in thermal equilibrium with one
another while others were not, then âbeing at 35 Â°Câ wouldnât mean much. However, every
object that has a temperature of 35 Â°C is in thermal equilibrium with every other object at
35 Â°C. The law of thermal equilibrium is observed to be true in nature, so temperature does
have meaning. Since your neighborâs home is just as hot as yours, they can relax because
youâre not going to be sending them any extra heat.

THE LAW OF THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM
Two objects that are each in thermal equilibrium with a third object are also in thermal
equilibrium with one another.

The second alternative sounds unlikely from the outset. Weâve known since the first
chapter that energy is special, that itâs a conserved quantity. You canât cool your home by
destroying thermal energy because energy canât be destroyed. To eliminate thermal energy,
you must convert it to another form or transfer it elsewhere.
This concept of energy conservation is the basis for the law of conservation of
energy (often called the first law of thermodynamics), which officially recognizes that
there are actually two ways to transfer energy: the mechanical means we know as work
and the thermal means we know as heat. You can increase an objectâs internal energy,
which includes its thermal energy, only by doing work on it or by transferring heat to it
(Fig. 8.1.2).
In its traditional form, the law of conservation of energy observes that the change in a
stationary objectâs internal energy is equal to the heat transferred into that object minus the
work that object does on its surroundings. In other words, heat added to the object increases

conservation of energy can be written as a word equation:
change in objectâs internal energy = heat added to object â work done by object, (8.1.1)

ÎU = Q â W,
and in everyday language:
You can add energy to a ball as heat by cooking it or as work by squeezing it.

THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
The change in a stationary objectâs internal energy is equal to the heat transferred into
that object minus the work that object does on its surroundings.

Check Your Understanding #1: Stirring Up Trouble
If you put cold water into a blender and mix it rapidly for several minutes, the water will become
warm. From where does the additional thermal energy come?
Answer: The blenderâs blade does work on the water, and this work becomes thermal energy.
Why: The law of conservation of energy states that the change in the waterâs internal energy is equal to
the heat flowing into it minus the work it does on its surroundings. In this case, the waterâs surroundings
are doing work on it by stirring it, so its internal energy increases. Since the water canât store this new
internal energy as ordered potential energy, the energy becomes thermal energy and the water gets hotter.

Check Your Figures #1: Powerful You
You have been pedaling the exercise bicycle steadily for 20 min at a power of 200 W. How much
thermal power is the bicycle emitting into the room?
Answer: 200 W.
Why: Since the bicycleâs internal energy canât increase or decrease forever, it must be emitting as much
thermal power into the room as it is receiving mechanical power from you. As required by Eq. 8.1.1, the
200 W of mechanical power you supply to the bicycle is flowing into the room as 200 W of thermal power.

Disorder and Entropy
The third alternative looks much more promising than the first two. It seems as though you
should be able to convert thermal energy into electricity (or some other ordered form of
energy). You could then sell it back to the electric company and get credit on your bill.
Wouldnât that be great?
Thereâs a problem with this ideaâordered energy and thermal energy arenât equivalent. You can easily convert ordered energy into thermal energy, but the reverse is much
harder. For example, you can burn a log to convert its chemical potential energy into
thermal energy, but youâll have trouble converting that thermal energy back into chemical
potential energy to recreate the log.
The basic laws of motion are silent on this issue. The logâs original energy and constituent particles still exist, and they could, in principle, act together to reassemble the log.
It is the laws of statistics that prevent the logâs reassembly. That reassembly process would
require a long series of remarkably unlikely events. The particles would all have to move
in just the right ways to turn the burned gases back into wood and oxygen, an incredible
coincidence that simply never happens. Similarly, all the air particles in your home would
have to act together to convert their thermal energy into electricity. Since that coordinated
behavior is ridiculously improbable, youâre not going to be selling thermal-energy power
to the electric company any time soon.
Once ordered energy has been scattered randomly among the individual air particles, you
canât collect that energy back together again. Creating disorder out of order is easy, but recovering order from disorder is nearly impossible. As a result, systems that begin with some amount
of order gradually become more and more disordered, never the other way around (Fig. 8.1.3).
The best they can do is to stay the same for a while so that their disorder doesnât change. From
these observations, we can state that the disorder of an isolated system never decreases.
This notion of never-decreasing disorder is one of the central concepts of thermal physics. There is even a formal measure of the total disorder in an object, entropy. All disorder
contributes to an objectâs entropy, including its thermal energy and its structural defects.
Both breaking a window and heating it increase its entropy. Although its name sounds similar to energy, donât confuse energy and entropy. Energy is a conserved quantity, while
entropy is a quantity that can and generally does increase. Itâs easy to make more entropy.
Because disorder never decreases, the third cooling alternative is impossible. Turning
your homeâs thermal energy into electric energy would reduce its disorder and decrease its
entropy. Our observations about entropy arenât yet complete, though. There is one way to
decrease your homeâs entropy: you can export that entropy somewhere else. In fact, you
export entropy every time you take out the garbage, though that action also changes the
contents of your home. You can also export entropy without modifying your homeâs contents by transferring heat somewhere else. Heat carries disorder and entropy with it, so
getting rid of heat also gets rid of entropy.
Our rule about entropy never decreasing is weakened by the possibility of exchanging
heat and entropy between objects. Before asserting that an object or system of objects canât
decrease its entropy, we must ensure that the object is thermally isolated from its surroundings
so that it canât export its entropy. With that in mind, the strongest statement that we can make

Fig. 8.1.3 Itâs easy to place these three photographs in their
correct time sequence. You simply look for disorder in each
photograph and arrange the sequence from least disorder to most
disorder. You are making use of the law of entropy, which observes
that the entropy (disorder) of a thermally isolated system never
decreases.

concerning entropy is that the entropy of a thermally isolated system of objects never decreases.
This observation is the law of entropy (often called the second law of thermodynamics).
THE LAW OF ENTROPY
The entropy of a thermally isolated system of objects never decreases.

Because of the law of entropy, the only way to cool your home is to export its thermal
energy and entropy elsewhere. Such a transfer would be easy if you had a cold object nearby
to receive the heat. Lacking a cold object, you must use an air conditioner. Like all heat
pumps, an air conditioner transfers heat and entropy in such a way that the law of entropy is
never violated and the entropy of each thermally isolated system of objects never decreases.
As weâll see, the air conditioner lowers the entropy of your home but raises the entropy of
the outdoor air even more, so that, overall, the entropy of the world actually increases.
Check Your Understanding #2: Something for Nothing
People have tried for centuries to build machines that provide endless outputs of useful, ordered
energy without any inputs of ordered energy. Unfortunately, such perpetual motion machines violate
the laws of thermodynamics. If such a machine is thermally isolated, which law does it violate? What
if itâs not thermally isolated?
Answer: A thermally isolated perpetual motion machine violates the law of conservation of energy,
while one that is not thermally isolated violates the law of entropy.
Why: A thermally isolated perpetual motion machine clearly violates the conservation of energy. This
isolated machine simply canât export energy forever because it will eventually run out. A perpetual
motion machine that is not thermally isolated may not violate conservation of energy because it can
absorb heat energy from its surroundings. Instead, it violates the law of entropy. This machine canât
endlessly absorb heat energy and then export it as ordered energy. In doing so, the machine will
eventually begin to reduce the entropy of the universe and violate the law of entropy. Sad though it
may be, perpetual motion machines canât exist.

Pumping Heat Against Its Natural Flow
Although the law of entropy doesnât allow the entropy of a thermally isolated system to
decrease, it does permit the objects in that system to redistribute their individual entropies.
One objectâs entropy can decrease as long as the entropy of the rest of the system increases
by at least as much. Such entropy redistribution allows part of the system to become colder
if the rest of the system becomes hotter.
For example, suppose that thereâs a pond of cold water behind your home. You pump
that water through your bathtub and let it draw heat out of the room air. Your home
becomes colder while the pond becomes warmer. This transfer of heat from the hot air in
your home to the cold water in the pond satisfies the law of entropy. The entropy of the
combined systemâyour home and the pool of waterâdoesnât decrease. In fact, it actually increases!
This entropy increase occurs because heat is more disordering to cold objects than it is
to hot objects. Each joule of heat that flows from your home to the pool creates more disorder in the pool than it creates order in your home.
A useful analog for this effect involves two parties taking place simultaneously: the
garden societyâs annual tea party and a 4-year-oldâs birthday party. The orderly tea party
represents the cold pool while the disorderly birthday party represents your hot home. The
analogy to letting heat flow from your hot home to the cold pool is to trade one lively
4-year-old from the disorderly birthday party for one quiet octogenarian from the orderly
tea party. This exchange will reduce the birthday partyâs disorder only slightly, but it will
dramatically increase the disorder of the tea party. The attendance at each party will be
unchanged but their total disorder will increase.
When heat flows from your home to the pool, the overall entropy increases and the
law of entropy is more than satisfied. A similar increase in entropy occurs whenever
heat flows from a hot object to a cold object, which is why heat normally flows in that
direction.
An air conditioner, however, does the seemingly impossible: it transfers heat from a
cold object, your home, to a hot object, the outdoor air. This heat flows in the wrong
direction, and the disorder it creates by entering the hot outdoor air is less than the disorder it removes by leaving the cold indoor air. Itâs like returning the tea partyâs lone
4-year-old to the birthday party in exchange for the elderly garden fancierâthe birthday
party becomes only a tiny bit more disorderly while the garden party becomes much
more orderly, so the net disorder of the two gatherings decreases substantially. Similarly,
if nothing else happened when the air conditioner moved heat from the cold indoor air to
the hot outdoor air, the entropy of the combined system would decrease and the law of
entropy would be violated!
However, weâve omitted an important feature of the air conditionerâs operationâthe
electric energy it consumes. The air conditioner converts this ordered energy into thermal
energy and delivers it as additional heat to the outdoor air (Fig. 8.1.4). In doing so, the air
conditioner creates enough extra entropy to ensure that the overall entropy of the combined
system increases. The law of entropy is satisfied after all.

Fig. 8.1.4 A heat pump transfers heat from a colder
region to a hotter region. In doing so, it converts some
work (ordered energy) into heat (thermal energy in the
hotter region). The larger the temperature difference
between the two regions, the more work is required to
transfer each joule of heat.

Air Conditioners

The amount of ordered energy the air conditioner consumes depends on the temperatures of the indoor air and outdoor air. If the two are close in temperature, the transfer
of heat reduces the entropy only slightly, so the air conditioner doesnât need to convert
much ordered energy into thermal energy. If they are far apart in temperature, however,
the air conditioner must create lots of extra entropy to make up for the entropy lost in
the transfer.
This requirement that entropy not decrease explains why an air conditioner works
best when itâs cooling your home the least. The greater the temperature difference
between the indoor air and the outdoor air, the more electric energy or other form of work
the air conditioner must consume to transfer each joule of heat. For an ideally efficient
air conditioner or other heat pump, the relationships between the work consumed, the
heat removed from the cold object, and the heat added to the hot object can be written as
two word equations:
heat removed from cold object = work consumed Âˇ

temperaturecold
temperature hot â temperaturecold

heat added to hot object = heat removed from cold object + work consumed, (8.1.2)
in symbols:
âQc = W

Tc
,
Th â Tc

Qh = âQc + W,
and in everyday language:
The closer the two temperatures are, the easier it is to move heat
from cold to hot,
where the temperatures are measured on an absolute scale. The hot object receives not only
the heat removed from the cold object but also an amount of heat equal to the work consumed by the transfer. Note also that the work needed to remove heat from your home
approaches infinity as its temperature approaches absolute zero; thatâs why absolute zero is
unattainable.
Sadly, a practical air conditioner never reaches ideal efficiency, so it moves less heat
than promised by Eqs. 8.1.2. Moreover, heat leaks back into your home through its walls at
a rate thatâs roughly proportional to the temperature difference. No wonder your electric
bill soars when you cool your home to arctic temperatures in tropical weather!

Check Your Understanding #3: Heat Pumps in Cold Weather
Homes located in mild climates are often heated by heat pumps during the winter. Home heat pumps
are essentially air conditioners run backward. They extract heat from the cold outdoor air and release
it to the warm indoor air. Why are heat pumps most effective in mild weather, when the outdoor air
isnât too cold?
Answer: heat pump requires more ordered energy to pump heat from a cold object to a hot object
when the temperature difference between them is large.
Why: A heat pump becomes less efficient at pumping heat when the temperature of the heatâs source
becomes much colder than the heatâs destination. The colder it is outside, the more ordered energy
it takes to move each joule of heat. On bitter cold days, heat pumps arenât able to move enough heat
to keep their homes warm, which is why most home heat pumps have built-in electric or gas furnaces
to assist them during unusually cold weather.

CHAPT ER 8 Thermodynamics

Check Your Figures #2: A Hot House for Cheap
Your house is heated by an ideally efficient heat pump that uses ordered energy to pump heat from
the colder outdoor air to the warmer indoor air. On a winter day, the outdoor temperature is 270 K
(â3 Â°C or 26 Â°F) and the indoor temperature is 300 K (26 Â°C or 80 Â°F). To deliver 1000 J of heat to
the indoor air, how much electric energy must the heat pump consume?
Answer: The pump must consume 100 J.
Why: The difference in temperature between indoor air and outdoor air is 30 K, so according to
Eqs. 8.1.2, the heat pump can remove 9 times as much heat from the outdoor air as it consumes in
work and deliver 10 times as much heat to the indoor air. Thus it takes only 100 J of electric energy
to remove 900 J of heat from the outdoor air and deliver all 1000 J as heat to the indoor air. What
a bargain!

How an Air Conditioner Cools the Indoor Air
Having determined the air conditionerâs goals, we can now look at how a real air conditioner meets them. In most cases, the air conditioner uses a fluid to transfer heat from the
colder indoor air to the hotter outdoor air. Known as the working fluid, this substance
absorbs heat from the indoor air and releases that heat to the outdoor air.
The working fluid flows in a looping path through the air conditionerâs three main
components: an evaporator, a condenser, and a compressor (Fig. 8.1.5). The evaporator is
located indoors, where it transfers heat from the indoor air to the working fluid (Fig. 8.1.6).
The condenser is located outdoors, where it transfers heat from the working fluid to the
outdoor air. The compressor is also located outdoors, where it squeezes the working fluid
and does the work needed to move heat against its natural flow. To see how these three
components pump heat out of your home, letâs look at them individually.
Weâll begin with the evaporator, a long metal pipe thatâs decorated with thin metal fins.
The evaporator is a heat exchanger that allows heat to flow from the warm indoor air around
it to the cool working fluid inside it. Its fins provide additional surface area through which
heat can flow, and a fan blows indoor air rapidly past those fins to encourage that flow.
True to its name, the evaporator is where the working fluid evaporates from liquid to
gas. To evaporate, the liquid working fluid needs its latent heat of evaporation, the energy
required to separate a liquidâs molecules so that it becomes a gas. The working fluid obtains
part of that energy from its own thermal energy, and its temperature decreases. Heat from
the indoor air then flows into the chilled working fluid and completes the evaporation. By
the time the working fluid leaves the evaporator as a gas, it has absorbed a great deal of the
indoor airâs thermal energy and carries that energy with it as chemical potential energy.
To make the working fluid evaporate, the air conditioner abruptly reduces its pressure. In
Chapter 7, we learned that phase transitions such as evaporation depend on molecular landing
and leaving rates, and that those rates are sensitive to pressure and temperature. Working fluid

flows toward the evaporator as a warm, high-pressure liquid, but its pressure drops dramatically when it flows into the evaporator through a narrow constriction in the tubing. That pressure drop slows the rate at which working fluid molecules land on the liquid from the gas so
that molecules leaving the liquid for the gas dominate and the liquid starts to evaporate.
As the working fluid evaporates, its temperature plummets and its evaporation slows down;
molecules rarely gather enough thermal energy from the cold liquid to leave it for the gas. However, heat from the warmer room air now rushes into the cold working fluid and encourages
further evaporation. By the time the working fluid emerges from the evaporator, it has evaporated completely and has absorbed considerable thermal energy from the indoor air. It leaves the
evaporator as a cool low-pressure gas and travels through a pipe toward the compressor.
Half the air conditionerâs job is done: it has removed heat from the indoor air. The
remaining half of its job is more challenging; it must add heat to the outdoor air while
ensuring that the total entropy of the combined system doesnât decrease. After all, thereâs
no getting around the law of entropy.

Check Your Understanding #4: Cooling at the Gas Grill
When liquid propane evaporates into a gas in the tank of a propane grill, the tank that contains that
liquid propane becomes colder. Why?
Answer: The tankâs liquid propane needs heat to evaporate into a gas, and it extracts that heat from
its surroundings.
Why: Just as in the evaporator of an air conditioner, the evaporating liquid propane absorbs heat.

How an Air Conditioner Warms the Outdoor Air
Satisfying the law of entropy is the task of the compressor, an electrically powered device
that squeezes gas into a smaller volume. The compressor receives low-pressure gaseous
working fluid from the evaporator, compresses it to much higher density, and delivers it as
a high-pressure gas to the condenser. The compressor may use a piston and one-way valves,
like the water pump in Fig. 5.2.3, or it may use a rotary pumping mechanism. Regardless
of how it functions, the result is the same: the gaseous working fluid undergoes a dramatic
increase in density and pressure as it passes through the compressor.

217

CHAPT ER 8 Thermodynamics

Fig. 8.1.7 The
compressor (bottom) and
condenser coils (top)
are visible on the back
of this refrigerator. The
compressor squeezes the
working fluid into a hot
dense gas and delivers it
to the condenser. There
it gives up heat to the
room air and condenses
into a liquid. The working
fluid evaporates inside the
refrigerator, extracting heat
from the food.

The compressor does work on the gas while compressing itâpushing the gas inward
as the gas moves inward. In accordance with the law of conservation of energy, this work
increases the internal energy of the working fluid. The only way that a gas can store additional energy is as thermal energy, so the working fluid leaves the compressor much hotter
than when it arrived. There is no getting around that temperature rise; compressing a gas
unavoidably raises its temperature.
Hot, high-pressure working fluid then flows into the condenser. Like the evaporator,
the condenser is a long metal pipe with fins attached to it. It acts as a heat exchanger, and
its fins provide extra surface area to speed the flow of heat from the hotter working fluid
inside it to the less hot outdoor air. There may also be a fan to move outdoor air quickly past
the condenser and speed up the heat transfer.
As its name suggests, the condenser is where the working fluid condenses from gas to
liquid. That condensation starts when the gas begins to cool after compression. While it flows
through a pipe toward the compressor, the low-pressure working fluid is stable as a gas. But in
the high-pressure, high-density working fluid that emerges from the compressor and starts to
cool in the condenser, the landing rate outpaces the leaving rate and the gas begins to condense.
As its molecules bind together to form a liquid, the hot gaseous working fluid releases
its latent heat of evaporation. This chemical potential energy becomes thermal energy in
the working fluid, keeping it hot so that heat continues to flow out of it through the walls of
the condenser to the cooler outdoor air.
By the time the working fluid leaves the condenser as a liquid, it has transformed a great
deal of chemical potential energy into thermal energy and released that energy into the outdoor
air. The outdoor air receives as heat not only the thermal energy extracted from the indoor air
but also the electric energy consumed by the compressor. The working fluid exits the condenser as a warm, high-pressure liquid and travels through a pipe toward the evaporator.
The second half of the air conditionerâs job is now complete; it has released heat into
the outdoor air and, in the process, converted ordered energy into thermal energy. From
here, the working fluid returns to the evaporator to begin the cycle all over again. The working fluid passes endlessly around the loop, extracting heat from the indoor air in the evaporator and releasing it to the outdoor air in the condenser. The compressor drives the whole
process and thereby satisfies the law of entropy.
In fact, heat pumps of this type also appear in many common appliances. A refrigerator
uses a heat pump to extract heat from food and release that heat to the room air (Fig. 8.1.7).
A drinking fountain uses a heat pump to transfer heat from water to the room air (Fig. 8.1.8).
Like all heat pumps, these cooling devices release more heat to the warm object (room air)
than they extract from the cold object (food or water). Thatâs why when you hold the refrigerator door open and it begins to pump heat from one portion of room air to another portion

of room air, the room gets warmer overallâthe electric energy the refrigerator consumes
while operating is being turned wastefully into thermal energy in the room. To save energy,
keep the refrigerator closed whenever possible.
Many homes in moderate climates are heated by effectively running their air conditioners backward. Called heat pumps rather than air conditioners, these systems are capable
of pumping heat against its natural direction of flow in winter as well is in summer.
In summer, a heat pump moves heat from indoor air to outdoor air to cool the home. In
winter, however, it moves heat from outdoor air to indoor air to heat the home. Rather than
turning electricity directly into thermal energy to heat the home, it leverages that electrical
energy by using it to gather the abundant thermal energy from outdoors and to carry that indoors.
Before leaving air conditioners, we should take a moment to look at the working fluid
itself. This fluid must become a gas at low pressure and a liquid at high pressure, over most
of the temperature range encountered by the air conditioner. For decades, the standard
working fluids were chlorofluorocarbons such as the various Freons. These compounds
replaced ammonia, a toxic and corrosive gas used in early refrigeration.
Chlorofluorocarbons are ideally suited to air conditioners because they easily transform from gas to liquid and back again over a broad range of temperatures. Theyâre also
chemically inert and inexpensive. Unfortunately, chlorofluorocarbon molecules contain
chlorine atoms and, when released into the air, can carry those chlorine atoms to the upper
atmosphere. There they promote the destruction of ozone molecules, essential atmospheric
constituents that absorb portions of the sunâs ultraviolet radiation. Recently, chlorine-free
hydrofluorocarbons have replaced chlorofluorocarbons as the working fluids in most air
conditioners. Though not as energy efficient and chemically inert as the materials they
replace, hydrofluorocarbons do not damage the ozone layer. They are, however, potent
greenhouse gases (see Section 7.3) and should not be released to the atmosphere.

What would happen to the average air temperature in your room if you placed a window air-conditioning

Answer: The room air would become warmer, on average.
Why: The air conditioner would begin to pump heat from its front to its back. The air right in front of
the unit would become colder, while the air behind the unit would become hotter. Since the unit
would deliver more heat to the hotter air than it would absorb from the colder air, it would increase

more than a century ago. It uses thermal energy released by

Questions to Think About: What obstacles stand in the way of

energy into useful work? What hot and cold objects does a car
have? Why does a car have a cooling system to get rid of waste
heat rather than just converting it all into useful work? How does
premium, high-octane gasoline differ from regular, low-octane
gasoline? Why arenât gasoline and diesel fuel interchangeable?

Experiments to Do: The recent advances in automobile
technology and the increasing demands for pollution-control
equipment have made automobiles exceedingly complicated.
Nonetheless, take a moment to look under the hood of your or

a friendâs car. You should be able to identify the engine and
its electric support system. You should be able to count four
or more spark plug wires heading toward the engineâs cylinders. These cylinders convert thermal energy from burning
fuel into work to propel the car. Why does the engine need so
many cylinders rather than relying on one larger cylinder?
At the front of the engine compartment, youâll find the
radiator. How does this device extract waste heat from the
engine? Does heat flow naturally into the radiator and then into
the outdoor air, or is there a heat pump involved?

Using Thermal Energy: Heat Engines
The light turns green, and you step on the accelerator pedal. The engine of your car roars
into action, and in a moment, youâre cruising down the road a mile a minute. The engine
noise gradually diminishes to a soft purr and vanishes beneath the sound of the radio and
the passing wind.
The engine is the heart of the automobile, pushing the car forward at the light and
keeping it moving against the forces of gravity, friction, and air resistance. Itâs not simply
a miracle of engineering. Itâs also a wonder of thermal physics because it performs the
seemingly impossible task of converting thermal energy into ordered energy. However, the
law of entropy forbids the direct conversion of thermal energy into ordered energy, so how
can a car engine use burning fuel to propel the car forward?
The car engine avoids conflict with the law of entropy by being a heat engine, a device
that converts thermal energy into ordered energy as heat flows from a hot object to a cold
object (Fig. 8.2.1). Although thermal energy in a single object canât be converted into work,
that restriction doesnât apply to a system of two objects at different temperatures. Because
heat flowing from the hot object to the cold object increases the overall entropy of the system, a small amount of thermal energy can be converted into work without decreasing the
systemâs overall entropy and without violating the law of entropy.
Another way to look at a heat engine is through the contributions of the two objects.
The hot object provides the thermal energy thatâs converted into work. The cold object
provides the order needed to carry out that conversion. As the heat engine operates, the hot
object loses some of its thermal energy and the cold object loses some of its order. The heat
engine has used them to produce ordered energy. Since the heat engine needs both thermal
energy and order, it canât operate if either the hot or the cold object is missing.
In a car engine, the hot object is burning fuel and the cold object is outdoor air. Some
of the heat passing from the burning fuel to the outdoor air is diverted and becomes the
ordered energy that propels the car. But what limits the amount of thermal energy the
engine can convert into ordered energy?
To answer that question, letâs examine a simplified car engine. Weâll treat the burning
fuel and outdoor air as a single, thermally isolated system and look at what happens to their
total entropy as the engine operates. In accordance with the law of entropy, this total entropy
canât decrease while the engine is transforming some thermal energy into ordered energy.

Fig. 8.2.1 A heat engine converts heat (thermal energy
from the hotter region) into work (ordered energy) as heat
flows from a hotter region to a colder region. The larger the
temperature difference between the two regions, the larger
the fraction of heat that can be converted into work.

When the car is idling at a stoplight, its engine is doing no work and heat is simply
flowing from the hot burning fuel to the cold outdoor air. The systemâs total entropy
increases because this heat is more disordering to the cold air it enters than to the hot burning fuel it leaves. In fact, the systemâs entropy increases dramatically because the burning
fuel is extremely hot compared to the cold outdoor air.
This increase in the systemâs entropy is unnecessary and wasteful. The law of entropy
requires only that the engine add as much entropy to the cold outdoor air as it removes from
the hot burning fuel. Since a little heat is quite disordering to cold air, the car engine can
deliver much less heat to the outdoor air than it removes from the burning fuel and still not
cause the systemâs total entropy to decrease. As long as the engine delivers enough heat to
the outdoor air to keep the total entropy from decreasing, thereâs nothing to prevent it from
converting the remaining heat into ordered energy!
This conversion starts as soon as you remove your foot from the brake and begin to
accelerate forward. Instead of transferring all the thermal energy in the burning fuel to the
outdoor air, your car then extracts some of it as ordered energy and uses it to power the
wheels. The car engine can convert thermal energy into ordered energy, as long as it passes
along enough heat from the hot object to the cold object to satisfy the law of entropy.
Obeying the law of entropy becomes easier as the temperature difference between the
two objects increases. When the temperature difference is huge, as it is in an automobile
engine, a large fraction of the thermal energy leaving the hot object can be converted into
ordered energyâat least in theory. For an ideally efficient automobile engine or other heat
engine, the relationships among the heat removed from the hot object, the heat added to the
cold object, and the work provided can be written as two word equations:
work provided = heat removed from hot object Âˇ

The greater the temperature difference between hot and cold, the larger the

where the temperatures are measured on an absolute scale.
Unfortunately, theoretical limits are often hard to realize in actual machines, and the best
automobile engines extract only about half the ordered energy specified by Eqs. 8.2.1. Still,
obtaining even that amount is a remarkable feat and a tribute to scientists and engineers who,
in recent years, have labored to make automobile engines as energy efficient as possible.

Check Your Figures #1: Back to the Steam Age
A train locomotive is powered by an ideal steam engine. If the steam boiler operates at 450 K (177 Â°C
or 350 Â°F) and the outdoor temperature is 300 K (26 Â°C or 80 Â°F), how much work can the steam
engine obtain by removing 1200 J of heat from the boiler?
Answer: It can obtain 400 J of work.
Why: Since the hot object is at 450 K and the temperature difference is 150 K, Eqs. 8.2.1 allow 1/3
of the heat removed from the boiler to be converted into work. The remaining 800 J of heat must flow
into the outdoor air.

The Internal Combustion Engine
Invented by the German engineer Nikolaus August Otto in 1867, the internal combustion
engine burns fuel directly in the engine itself. Gasoline and air are mixed and ignited in an
enclosed chamber. The resulting temperature rise increases the pressure of the gas and
allows it to perform work on a movable surface.
To extract work from the fuel, the internal combustion engine must perform four tasks
in sequence:
1. It must introduce a fuel-air mixture into an enclosed volume.
2. It must ignite that mixture.
3. It must allow the hot burned gas to do work on the car.
4. It must get rid of the exhaust gas.
In the standard, four-stroke fuel-injected engine found in modern gasoline automobiles,
this sequence of events takes place inside a hollow cylinder (Fig. 8.2.2). Itâs called a fourstroke engine because it operates in four distinct steps, or strokes: induction, compression,
power, and exhaust. Fuel-injected refers to the technique used to mix the fuel and air as
theyâre introduced into the cylinder.
Automobile engines usually have four or more of these cylinders. Each cylinder is a
separate energy source, closed at one end and equipped with a movable piston, several
valves, a fuel injector, and a spark plug. The piston slides up and down in the cylinder,
shrinking or enlarging the cavity inside. The valves, located at the closed end of the cylinder, open to introduce fuel and air into the cavity or to permit burned exhaust gas to escape
from the cavity. The fuel injector adds fuel to the air as it enters the cylinder. The spark
plug, also located at the closed end of the cylinder, ignites the fuel-air mixture to release its
chemical potential energy as thermal energy.

The fuel-air mixture is introduced into each cylinder during its induction stroke. In this
stroke, the engine pulls the piston away from the cylinderâs closed end so that its cavity
expands to create a partial vacuum. At the same time, the cylinderâs inlet valves open so
that atmospheric pressure can push fresh air into the cylinder. The cylinderâs fuel injector
adds a mist of fuel droplets to this air so that the cylinder fills with a flammable fuel-air
mixture. Because it takes work to move air out of the way and create a partial vacuum, the
engine does work on the cylinder during the induction stroke.
At the end of the induction stroke, the inlet valves close to prevent the fuel-air mixture from
flowing back out of the cylinder. Now the compression stroke begins. The engine pushes the
piston toward the cylinderâs closed end so that its cavity shrinks and the fuel-air mixture becomes
denser. The engine does work on the mixture while compressing itâthe piston pushes the gas
inward as the gas moves inwardâso the mixtureâs internal energy increases. The only way that
a gas can store this additional energy is as thermal energy, so the mixtureâs temperature rises as
itâs compressed. Since increases in a gasâs density and temperature both increase its pressure,
the pressure in the cylinder rises rapidly as the piston approaches the spark plug.
At the end of the compression stroke, the engine applies a high-voltage pulse to the spark
plug and ignites the fuel-air mixture. The mixture burns quickly to produce hot, high-pressure
burned gas, which then does work on the car during the cylinderâs power stroke. In that
stroke, the gas pushes the piston away from the cylinderâs closed end so that its cavity expands
and the burned gas becomes less dense. Since the hot gas exerts a huge pressure force on the
piston as it moves outward, it does work on the piston and ultimately propels the car. As it
does work, the burned gas gives up thermal energy and cools in accordance with the law of
conservation of energy. Its density and pressure also decrease. At the end of the power stroke,
the exhaust gas has cooled significantly and its pressure is only a few times atmospheric
pressure. The cylinder has extracted much of the fuelâs chemical energy as work.
The cylinder gets rid of the exhaust gas during its exhaust stroke. In this stroke, the
engine pushes the piston toward the closed end of the cylinder while the cylinderâs outlet
valves are open. Because the burned gas trapped inside the cylinder at the end of the power
stroke is well above atmospheric pressure, it accelerates out of the cylinder the moment the
outlet valves open. These sudden bursts of gas leaving the cylinders create the âpoof-poofpoofâ sound of a running engine. Without a muffler on its exhaust pipes, the engine would
be loud and unpleasant.
Just opening the outlet valves releases most of the exhaust gas, but the rest is squeezed
out as the piston moves toward the cylinderâs closed end. The engine again does work on
the cylinder as it squeezes out the exhaust gas. At the end of the exhaust stroke, the cylinder
is empty and the outlet valves close. The cylinder is ready to begin a new induction stroke.
Check Your Understanding #2: Getting Out More Than You Put In
Why does the burned gas do more work on the piston during the power stroke than the piston does
on the unburned fuel-air mixture during the compression stroke?
Answer: The pressure is much higher in the burned gas than in the unburned fuel-air mixture.
Why: The amount of work done on the piston by the gas or done on the gas by the piston depends on
the pressure inside the cylinder. The higher that pressure, the more outward force the piston experiences and the more work is done on it as it moves. The sudden rise in pressure that occurs when the
fuel-air mixture burns explains why the burned gas does so much work on the piston as it moves
outward. That pressure rise is due partly to the rise in temperature and partly to the fragmentation of
the fuel and oxygen molecules into more, smaller molecules.

Engine Efficiency
The goal of an internal combustion engine is to extract as much work as possible from a
given amount of fuel. In principle, the fuelâs chemical potential energy can be converted
entirely into work because both are ordered energies. However, itâs difficult to convert

223

224

CHAPT ER 8 Thermodynamics

chemical potential energy directly into work, so the engine burns the fuel instead. This step
is unfortunate, for in burning the fuel, the engine converts the fuelâs chemical potential
energy directly into thermal energy and produces lots of unnecessary entropy.
But all is not lost. Since the burned fuel is extremely hot, a good fraction of its thermal
energy can be converted into ordered energy by diverting some of the heat that flows from
the burned fuel to the outdoor air. As we noted earlier, the hotter the burned fuel and the
colder the outdoor air, the more ordered energy the engine can extract. To maximize its fuel
efficiency, an internal combustion engine obtains the hottest possible burned gas, lets that
gas do as much work as it can on the piston, and releases the gas at the coldest possible
temperature.
It would be wonderful if, during the power stroke, the burned gas expanded and cooled
until it reached the temperature of the outdoor air. The exhaust gas would then leave the
engine with the same amount of thermal energy it had when it arrived, and the engine
would have extracted all of the fuelâs chemical potential energy as work. Unfortunately,
that would violate the law of entropy by converting thermal energy completely into ordered
energy. As Eqs. 8.2.1 indicate, an operating heat engine always adds some heat to its cold
object. In this case, the engine releases the burned gas before it cools to the temperature of
the outdoor air. It has no choice; the engineâs exhaust must be hot!
An ordinary internal combustion engine, however, is even less fuel efficient than the
law of entropy requires. It releases the burned gas while that gas is still well above atmospheric pressure and is therefore still capable of doing work on the piston. By allowing that
gas to expand further before release, an improved engine could extract more work from it
and thus be more fuel efficient. The Atkinson cycle engine is just such a device, with a
power stroke that is longer than its compression stroke. However, even if the engine expanded the burned gas until it reached atmospheric pressure, the temperature of its exhaust
would still remain somewhat above the temperature of the outdoor air. Invented in 1882,
Atkinson cycle engines have become popular only recently as part of the effort to build
more fuel-efficient vehicles.
Regardless of these improvements, real internal combustion engines always waste
some energy and extract less work than the law of entropy allows. For example, a fraction
of the heat leaks from the burned gas to the cylinder walls and is removed by the carâs
cooling system. This wasted heat isnât available to produce work. Similarly, sliding friction
in the engine wastes mechanical energy and necessitates an oil-filled lubricating system.
Overall, real internal combustion engines convert only about 20â30% of the fuelâs chemical potential energy into work.
Check Your Understanding #3: Too Much of a Good Thing
What would happen to the pressure of the burned gas in an internal combustion engine if that engine
tried to expand it until it cooled to the temperature of the outdoor air?
Answer: The pressure of the burned gas would drop below atmospheric pressure.
Why: As the engine lets the burned gas expand, that gas does work on the piston and its temperature
and pressure decrease. By the time the gas reaches atmospheric pressure, it has cooled significantly
but it is still hotter than the outdoor air. To cool the burned gas further, the engine would have to
expand it further and its pressure would drop below atmospheric. The engine would then be doing
work on its piston to create a partial vacuum.

Improving Engine Efficiency
To obtain the hottest possible burned gas, the compression stroke should squeeze the fuelair mixture into as small a volume as possible. The more tightly the piston compresses the
mixture, the higher its density, pressure, and temperature will be before ignition and the
hotter the burned gases will be after ignition. Since the efficiency of any heat engine

increases as the temperature of its hot object increases and since the hot burned gas is the
automobile engineâs âhot object,â its high temperature after ignition is good for efficiency.
The extent to which the cylinderâs volume decreases during the compression stroke is
measured by its compression ratio, its volume at the start of the compression stroke
divided by its volume at the end of the compression stroke. The larger this compression
ratio, the hotter the burned gas and the more energy efficient the engine. While normal
compression ratios are between 8:1 and 12:1, those in high-compression engines may be
as much as 15:1.
Unfortunately, the compression ratio canât be made arbitrarily large. If the engine
compresses the fuel-air mixture too much, the flammable mixture will become so hot that
it will ignite all by itself. This spontaneous ignition due to overcompression is called preignition or knocking. When an automobile knocks, the gasoline burns before the engine is
ready to extract work from it and much of the energy is wasted.
There are two ways to reduce knocking. First, you can mix the fuel and air more
uniformly. In a nonuniform mixture, there may be small regions of gas that get hotter or
are more susceptible to ignition than others. The fuel-injection technique used in all
modern cars provides excellent mixing and also allows a carâs computer to adjust the
fuel-air mixture for complete combustion and minimal pollution. So unless a car is seriously out of tune, there isnât much room for improvement as far as mixture uniformity is
concerned.
Second, you can use the most appropriate fuel. Not all fuels ignite at the same temperature, so you should select a fuel that is able to tolerate your carâs compression process
without igniting spontaneously. Thatâs exactly what you do when you purchase the proper
grade of gasoline. Regular gasoline ignites at a relatively low temperature and is most susceptible to knocking. Premium gasoline ignites at a relatively high temperature and is most
resistant to knocking.
Fuels that are more difficult to ignite and more resistant to knocking are assigned
higher octane numbers. Regular gasoline has an octane number of about 87, while premium
has an octane number of about 93 (Table 8.2.1). Choosing the proper fuel is simply a matter
of finding the lowest octane gasoline that your car can use without excessive knocking. A
little knocking in the most demanding circumstances is quite acceptable. Most modern
well-tuned automobiles work beautifully on regular gasoline. Since only high-performance
cars with high-compression engines need premium gasoline, putting anything other than
regular gasoline in a normal car is usually a waste of money.
Check Your Understanding #4: The Only Premium Is the Price
As part of its aggressive advertising campaign, one oil company has begun calling its 93-octane
gasoline âthe auto elixir.â People are flocking to the pumps to fill up even the most ordinary cars with
it. Should you join them or merely chuckle?
Answer: Chuckle away.
Why: Like any high-octane gasoline, the elixir is an expensive fuel that has been carefully formulated
to be hard to ignite. Although it works wonders for a high-compression engine that would otherwise
overheat the fuel-air mixture and cause it to knock, its resistance to ignition is wasted on most ordinary engines.

CHAPT ER 8 Thermodynamics

Diesel Engines and Turbochargers
Since knocking sets the limit for compression ratio, it also sets the limit for efficiency in a
gasoline engine. However, diesel engines avoid the knocking problem by separating the
fuel and air during the compression stroke (Fig. 8.2.3). Invented by German engineer
Rudolph Christian Karl Diesel (1858â1913) in 1896, the diesel engine has no spark plug to
ignite the fuel. Instead, it compresses pure air with an extremely high compression ratio of
perhaps 20:1 and then injects diesel fuel directly into the cylinder just as the power stroke
begins. The fuel ignites spontaneously as it enters the hot compressed air. Unlike an internal combustion engine, which uses a fuel that is difficult to ignite, a diesel engine uses fuel
that ignites easily.
Because of its higher compression ratio, a diesel engine burns its fuel at a higher temperature than a standard gasoline engine and can therefore be more energy efficient. It
effectively has a hotter âhot objectâ and can convert a larger fraction of heat into work.
Some gasoline or diesel engines combine fuel injection with a turbocharger. A turbocharger is essentially a fan that pumps outdoor air into the cylinder during the induction stroke. By
squeezing more fuel-air mixture into the cylinder, a turbocharger increases the engineâs power
output. The engine burns more fuel with each power stroke and behaves like a larger engine.
The fan of a turbocharger is powered by pressure in the engineâs exhaust system. A nearly
identical device called a supercharger is driven directly by the engineâs output power.
For an internal combustion engine, turbochargers have a downside: they encourage
knocking. As a turbocharger squeezes air into the cylinder, it does work on that air and the
air becomes hot. Since the fuel-air mixture enters the engine hot, it may ignite spontaneously during the compression stroke. To avoid knocking in a car equipped with a turbocharger, you may need to use premium gasoline. Some turbocharged cars are equipped
with an intercooler, a device that removes heat from the air passing through the turbocharger. By providing cool, high-density air to the cylinders, the intercooler reduces the peak
temperature of the compression stroke and avoids knocking.
For diesel engines, however, knocking is not an issue. In fact, turbochargers have revolutionized diesel engines, transforming them from sluggish to high performance. Because
of their high compression ratios and extremely hot combustion temperatures, diesel engines
develop enormous pressures inside their cylinders and tremendous forces on their pistons.
As a result, diesel engines can provide large torques and enormous powers, even at low
engine speeds.
With higher fuel efficiency and enhanced performance, these modern diesel engines
have a clear environmental advantage over gasoline engines. However, they still had to

solve a long-standing problem with diesel enginesâparticulate pollution. Because a diesel
engine must burn its oily liquid fuel in about 1/1000th of a second, it was difficult to burn
the fuel completely and some of it became carbon soot. To eliminate that soot, diesel
engines were reengineered to swirl their fuel and air vigorously for more complete burning
and they now incorporate filters that capture and burn up any soot that does manage to get
into the exhaust system. The result is a relatively fuel-efficient vehicle with environmental
specifications that rival hybrid vehicles.
COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: The Hydrogen Economy
Misconception: One day soon, hydrogen will eliminate the need for other sources of energy.
Resolution: Since hydrogen doesnât occur naturally on Earth, it is not a primary energy source.
Hydrogen is a secondary energy source, meaning that it is produced using a primary source of
energy. Although hydrogen can be made using solar, wind, or hydroelectric energy, most hydrogen
is now produced using natural gas or coal. Hydrogen itself is neither renewable nor nonrenewable;
what matters is which energy source you use to make it.

Check Your Understanding #5: Steam Heat
How can a steam engine be more energy efficient when it operates on 325 Â°C steam than when it
uses 300 Â°C steam?
Answer: Like all heat engines, the steam engine can convert more thermal energy into work when
the temperature of its hot object (the steam) increases.
Why: The steam engine converts thermal energy into work as heat flows from the hot steam to the
outdoor air. The greater the temperature difference between those two objects, the more efficient
the steam engine can be at turning thermal energy into work. That is why most steam engines use
extremely hot steam.

Multicylinder Engines
Since the purpose of the engine is to extract work from the fuel-air mixture, itâs important
that each cylinder do more work than it consumes. Three of the strokes require the engine to
do work on various gases, and only one of the strokes extracts work from the burned gas.
During the induction stroke, the engine does work drawing the fuel-air mixture into the
cylinder. During the compression stroke, the engine does work compressing the fuel-air
mixture. During the exhaust stroke, the engine does work squeezing the exhaust gas out of
the cylinder. Fortunately, the work done on the engine by the hot burned gas during the
power stroke more than makes up for the work the engine does during the other three strokes.
Still, the engine has to invest a great deal of energy into the cylinder before each power
stroke. To provide this initial energy, most four-stroke engines have four or more cylinders,
timed so that there is always one cylinder going through the power stroke. The cylinder that
is in the power stroke provides the work needed to carry the other cylinders through the
three nonpower strokes, and there is plenty of work left over to propel the car itself.
While the pistons move back and forth, the engine needs a rotary motion to turn the
carâs wheels. The engine converts each pistonâs reciprocating motion into rotary motion by
coupling that piston to a crankshaft with a connecting rod. The crankshaft is a thick steel
bar, suspended in bearings, that has a series of pedal-like extensions, one for each cylinder.
As the piston moves out of the cylinder during the power stroke, it pushes on the connecting rod and the connecting rod pushes on its crankshaft pedal. The connecting rod thus
produces a torque on the crankshaft. The crankshaft rotates in its bearings and transmits
this torque out of the engine so that it can be used to propel the car. So, while each cylinder
initially exerts a force, the crankshaft uses that force to produce a torque.

227

228

CHAPT ER 8 Thermodynamics

The spinning crankshaft conveys its rotary power to the carâs transmission, and from
there the power moves on to the wheels. Overall, a significant portion of the heat flowing
out of the burning fuel-air mixture is being converted into work and used to spin the carâs
wheels. Assisted by friction with the pavement, the wheels push the car forward, and you
cruise down the highway toward your destination.
Check Your Understanding #6: Hard Starting
Modern cars use an electric motor to start the engine turning, but early cars were started with a hand
crank. Why was it so hard to turn the crank?
Answer: The person turning the crank had to do all the work needed to move the engineâs pistons
through the three nonpower strokes.
Why: Before the engine started running on its own, it couldnât provide any of the energy the cylinders
needed during the induction, compression, and exhaust strokes. The person turning the crank had to
provide this energy. Once the fuel started burning, the power strokes could take over, but up to that
point, turning the crank was hard work.

Epilogue for Chapter 8
This chapter has examined two devices that control the flow of heat to accomplish challenging tasks. In Air Conditioners, we learned how heat pumps use ordered energy to pump
heat against its natural flow and observed that the only way to get rid of thermal energy is
to transfer it to something else. In Automobiles, we saw that heat engines are able to divert
some of the heat flowing from a hot object to a cold object and convert it into useful work.
We also examined the roles of the two objects in a heat engine, hot and cold, finding that
the hot object provides the energy needed to do the work, while the cold object provides the
order that makes the conversion of thermal energy into ordered energy possible.

Explanation: Making Fog in a Bottle
Even when everything in the room is at a single temperature, you can still use thermodynamics to cool the air in the bottle below room temperature. When you step on the bottle,
you compress the air inside it and do work on that air. Since air can accommodate added
energy only as thermal energy, its temperature rises. The air in the bottle becomes hotter,
and heat flows out of the warmer bottle into the cooler room. After half a minute or so, the
temperature of air in the bottle returns to the temperature of the room.
When you step off the bottle, the air inside it expands and does work on you. Since air
can obtain that work only from its thermal energy, its temperature drops. The air in the
bottle becomes colder, and its relative humidity suddenly exceeds 100%. As a result, moisture inside the bottle condenses into droplets and the air becomes foggy.
Smoke particles assist the droplet formation by acting as seeds for the droplets. As we
saw in Chapter 7, water canât boil without seed bubbles. Similarly, steam canât condense in
air without seed droplets. When the seed droplets fail to form spontaneously, the smoke
gives them a little help.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Air Conditioners Work: An air conditioner moves heat against its natural direction of
flow, using a working fluid that passes endlessly through an evaporator, a compressor, and a
condenser. The working fluid flows toward the evaporator as a stable high-pressure liquid. Just
before pouring into the evaporator, this liquid passes through a constriction in the pipe and

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations

229

experiences a large drop in pressure. Since the working fluid is not stable as a low-pressure
liquid, it evaporates rapidly in the evaporator and thereby absorbs a great deal of heat from
the indoor air.
The working fluid then flows to the compressor as a stable low-pressure gas. The compressor squeezes it into a hot, high-density, high-pressure gas and blows it into the condenser.
Since the working fluid is not stable as a high-pressure gas, it condenses rapidly in the condenser and thereby releases a large amount of heat to the outdoor air. The resulting liquid
working fluid then returns toward the evaporator to begin the cycle again.
To propel this process, the compressor consumes ordered energy and delivers it as heat
to the outdoor air. Without this input of ordered energy, the air conditioner could not move
heat against its natural direction of flow.
How Automobiles Work: An automobile engine extracts work from its chemical fuel by burning that fuel inside its cylinders and making the resulting burned gas do work on the engine.
Most engines have at least four cylinders, each of which requires four strokes to extract work
from the fuel. During the induction stroke, a piston moves out of the cylinder and draws a
mixture of fuel and air into the resulting cavity. During the compression stroke, the piston
moves into the cylinder, compressing this fuel-air mixture to high density, pressure, and
temperature. An electric spark then ignites the mixture and it burns to form extremely hot
burned gas. During the power stroke, the piston again moves out of the cylinder while the hot
gas does work on it. This work is what powers the car. Finally, during the exhaust stroke, the
piston moves into the cylinder and squeezes out the burned gas. The cylinder then begins
again with fresh fuel and air.

1. Law of thermal equilibrium: Two objects that are each in
thermal equilibrium with a third object are also in thermal equilibrium with one another.
2. Law of conservation of energy: The change in a stationary
objectâs internal energy is equal to the heat transferred into
that object minus the work that object does on its surroundings or

internal energy change = heat added â work done. (8.1.1)
3. Law of entropy: The entropy of a thermally isolated system

of objects never decreases.

any fascinating motions in the world around us are repetitive ones. Our lives are filled with
cycles, from the sunâs daily passage overhead to a pondâs undulating ripples on a rainy day.
These cyclic motions are governed by the physical laws and steadily mark our journey
through time and space. Some of these cycles structure our lives out of necessity or tradition, while
others are simply there to be observed. Still other cycles have become part of our everyday world
because theyâre useful or enjoyable. In this chapter, we cover those three possibilities by examining
cyclic motions in three contexts: in clocks, in musical instruments, and at the seashore.

such issues as tides, tsunamis, and surf. For a more detailed

People measure their lives according to the sky, dividing existence into days, months, and years according to the celestial
motions of the sun, moon, and stars. On the less romantic
scale of daily life, the sky offers little help. Since it provides no
easy way to measure short periods of time, people invented
clocks.
Early clocks were based on the time it took to complete
simple processesâthe flow of sand or water, or the burning of
candles. However, these clocks had limited accuracy and

required constant attention. Better clocks measure time with
repetitive motions such as swinging or rocking. In this section,
weâll examine the workings of modern clocks based on repetitive motions. As we do, weâll see that repetitive motions are
interesting in their own right and appear throughout nature in
countless objects in addition to clocks.
Questions to Think About: What exactly is time? Why do some
objects swing or rock back and forth repetitively? How can you
use a repetitive motion to measure time? How can you change
the rate at which an object swings or rocks? Since repetitive
motions donât normally continue forever, how can you keep
them going without upsetting their timekeeping ability?
Experiments to Do: You can build the timekeeping portion of
a pendulum clock by attaching a small, dense object to the
end of a string and hanging that string from a table or doorway.
Push the object gently so that it swings back and forth. Youâll
find that it completes this repetitive motion with great regularity. What limits its regularity?
If the string is about 25 cm (10 in) long, a complete swing
(back and forth) will take almost exactly 1 s. Change the length
of the string and observe its effect on the swing. Do you think
that the objectâs weight affects the swing? Try a different object
and see whether youâre right.
Now vary the extent of the swing to find out whether it
affects the time each swing takes. How can it be that a small
swing takes the same time as a large swing? Notice that you can
get the object swinging by pushing on it rhythmically. Randomly
timed pushes wonât do; you must push the object in synchrony
with its motion. At what times should you push it to make it
swing farther? To make it swing less far? Rhythmic pushes of
this sort keep the timekeeper in a clock moving, hour after hour.

Time
Before examining clocks, we should take a brief look at time itself. Scientists treat time as a
dimension, similar but not identical to the three spatial dimensions that we perceive in the
world around us. In total, our universe has four dimensions: three spatial dimensions and one
temporal dimension. Thus it takes four numbers to completely specify when and where an
event occurs: three numbers identify the eventâs location and one identifies its moment in time.
An obvious difference between space and time is that, while we can see space stretched
out around us, we can observe only the passage of time. Although we occupy only one
location in space at a given moment, we are somehow more aware of the expanse of space
around us. Itâs much harder to sense the whole framework of time stretching off into the
past and future; you must use your imagination.
Another difference between time and space is that, while you can turn around and walk
back the way you came, you canât grow any younger. Our travels through space are reversible, but our travels through time are one-way. That irreversibility of time is associated with
entropy and the law of entropy (see Chapter 8), particularly the ever-increasing disorder of
the universe. Disorder increases, we get older, the weeds grow around our homes, and even
clocks run down.
Our perception of space is ultimately based on the need for forces, accelerations, and
velocities to travel from one place to another. A city seems far away because we know that
traveling there with reasonable forces, accelerations, and velocities will take a long time.
Our perception of time is based on the same mechanical principles. If two moments are
separated by a long time, then reasonable forces, accelerations, and velocities will permit
us to travel large distances between the two moments. In short, our perceptions of space
and time are interrelated, and measurements of time and space are connected as well.
We measure space with rulers and time with clocks. How would you make a ruler? You
could construct a rather large ruler by driving a car at constant velocity and marking the
pavement with paint once each second. Your ruler wouldnât be very practical, but it would
fit the definition of a ruler as having spatial markings at uniform distances. You would be
using your movement through time to measure space.
How would you make a clock? You could make a rather strange clock by driving a car
at constant velocity down your giant ruler and counting each time you see one of your
marks go by. You would then be using your movement through space to measure time.
Most clocks really do use motion to measure time. As we are about to see, however, they
use motions that are a bit more compact than a car ride.
Check Your Understanding #1: The Ultimate Moon Bounce
To measure the distance from Earth to the moon, scientists bounce light from reflectors placed on
the moon by the Apollo astronauts. Light travels at a constant speed. How can a measurement of
lightâs travel time to and from the moon be used to determine the distance from Earth to the moon?
Answer: Since light travels at a constant speed, the distance it travels is equal to its speed times its
travel time. If you know the travel time and the speed, you can determine that distance.
Why: Many distance measurements are made by measuring time. Surveyors routinely use lightâs
travel time to measure distances. Decorators and architects often use soundâs travel time to measure
the distances between walls. In general, the motion of an object at constant velocity can be used
either to measure the distance traveled if you know the elapsed time or to measure the elapsed time
if you know the distance traveled.

Natural Resonances
An ideal timekeeping motion should offer both accuracy and convenience. That rules out
some of the obvious choices. The sun, moon, and stars keep excellent time but fail the
convenience test. Sure, conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum so

dominate their motions that these celestial bodies move steadily and predictably through
the heavens, century after century, but what do you do on a cloudy day? And while simple
interval timers like sandglasses and burning candles are easy to make and use, theyâre not
very accurate. Besides, whoâs going to stay up all night lighting fresh candles just to keep
the âclockâ running? (For an interesting astronomical clock, see 1 .)
Instead, practical clocks are based on a particular type of repetitive motion called a
natural resonance. In a natural resonance, the energy in an isolated object or system of
objects causes it to perform a certain motion over and over again. Many objects in our
world exhibit natural resonances, from tipping rocking chairs to sloshing basins of water to
waving flagpoles, and those natural resonances usually involve motion about a stable equilibrium. Like the bouncing spring scale in Section 3.1, an object that has been displaced
from its stable equilibrium accelerates toward that equilibrium but then overshoots; it
coasts right through equilibrium and must turn around to try again. As long as it has excess
energy, this object continues to glide back and forth through its equilibrium and thus exhibits a natural resonance.
Some resonances, such as those of bouncing balls and teetering bottles, donât maintain
a steady beat and arenât suitable for clocks. However, we are about to encounter a group of
resonances that are extremely regular and that can be used to measure the passage of time
with remarkable accuracy. Those resonances belong to an important class of mechanical
systems known as harmonic oscillators.

Although a sandglass can be made repetitive by turning it over every time the sand runs out, this
manual restarting process introduces timing errors. If a 3-min sandglass is always turned over within
10 s after the sand runs out, how accurately will it measure time over the course of a day?
Answer: It may have lost as much as 80 min after 24 h.
Why: If the operator of a sandglass waits 10 s before turning it over each time the sand runs out,
the clock will lose 10 s every 3 min, 200 s every h, and 4800 s every day. If you could be sure that
the operator would always wait 10 s, you could include it in the clockâs design. However, the operator might be faster one time than the next, and this uncertainty makes the clock unreliable and
inaccurate. For a repetitive clock to keep accurate time, it must repeat its motion with almost perfect
regularity.

Pivot

Pendulums and Harmonic Oscillators
One of the first natural resonances to find its way into clocks is the swing of a pendulum, a
weight hanging from a pivot (Fig. 9.1.1). When the pendulumâs center of gravity is directly
below its pivot, itâs in a stable equilibrium. Its center of gravity is then as low as possible,
so displacing it raises its gravitational potential energy and a restoring force begins pushing
it back toward that equilibrium position (Fig. 9.1.2). For geometrical reasons, this restoring
force is almost exactly proportional to how far the pendulum is from equilibrium. As you
displace the pendulum steadily from equilibrium, the restoring force on it also increases
steadily.
When you release the displaced pendulum, its restoring force accelerates it back
toward equilibrium. Instead of stopping, however, the pendulum swings back and forth
about its equilibrium position in a repetitive motion called an oscillation. As it swings, its
energy alternates between potential and kinetic forms. When it swings rapidly through its
equilibrium position in the middle of a swing, its energy is all kinetic. When it stops
momentarily at the end of a swing, its energy is all gravitational potential. This repetitive
transformation of excess energy from one form to another is part of any oscillation and
keeps the oscillatorâthe system experiencing the oscillationâmoving back and forth until
that excess energy is either converted into thermal energy or transferred elsewhere.

The pendulum isnât just any oscillator, though. Because its restoring force is proportional to its displacement from equilibrium, the pendulum is a harmonic oscillatorâthe
simplest and best understood mechanical system in nature. As a harmonic oscillator,
the pendulum undergoes simple harmonic motion, a regular and predictable oscillation
that makes it a superb timekeeper.
The period of any harmonic oscillator, the time it takes to complete one full cycle
of its motion, depends only on how stiffly its restoring force pushes it back and forth,
and on how strongly its inertia resists the accelerations of that motion. Stiffness is the
measure of how sharply the restoring force increases as the oscillator is displaced from
equilibrium; stiff restoring forces are associated with firm or hard objects, while less
stiff restoring forces are associated with soft objects. The stiffer the restoring force, the
more forcefully it pushes the oscillator back and forth and the shorter the oscillatorâs
period. On the other hand, the larger the oscillatorâs mass, the less it accelerates and the
longer its period.
However, the most remarkable and important characteristic of a harmonic oscillator is
not that its period depends on stiffness and mass, but that its period doesnât depend on
amplitude, its furthest displacement from equilibrium. Whether that amplitude is large or
small, the harmonic oscillatorâs period remains exactly the same. This insensitivity to amplitude is a consequence of its special restoring force, a restoring force that is proportional
to its displacement from equilibrium. At larger amplitudes, the oscillator travels farther
each cycle, but the forces accelerating it through that cycle are stronger as well. Overall, the
harmonic oscillator completes a large cycle of motion just as quickly as it completes a
small cycle of motion.
Any harmonic oscillator can be thought of as having a restoring force component that
drives the back and forth motion and an inertial component that resists that motion. Their
competition determines the oscillatorâs period. Harmonic oscillators with stiff restoring
forces and little inertia have short periods, while those with soft restoring forces and great
inertia have long periods. Their amplitudes of oscillation simply donât affect their periods,
which is why harmonic oscillators are so ideal for timekeeping. Because practical clocks
canât control the amplitudes of their timekeeping oscillators perfectly, virtually all of them
are based on harmonic oscillators.

Clocks

HARMONIC OSCILLATORS
A harmonic oscillator is an oscillator with a restoring force proportional to its displacement from equilibrium. Its period of oscillation depends only on the stiffness of that
restoring force and on its mass, not on its amplitude of oscillation.

Actually, a pendulum is an unusual harmonic oscillator because increasing its mass
doesnât increase its period. Thatâs because increasing the pendulumâs mass also increases
its weight and therefore stiffens its restoring force. These two changes compensate for one
another perfectly so that the pendulumâs period is unchanged.
A pendulumâs period does, however, depend on its length and on gravity. When you
reduce the pendulumâs length, the distance from its pivot to its center of mass, you stiffen
its restoring force and shorten its period. Similarly, when you strengthen gravity (perhaps
by traveling to Jupiter), you increase the pendulumâs weight, stiffen its restoring force, and
reduce its period. Though we wonât try to prove it, the period of a pendulum is

Thus a short pendulum swings more often than a long one, and any pendulum swings more
often on Earth than it would on the moon.
On Earthâs surface, a 0.248-m (10-in) pendulum has a period of 1 s (Fig. 9.1.3),
making it suitable for a wall clock that advances its second hand by 1 s each time the
pendulum completes a cycle. Since a pendulumâs period increases as the square root of
its length, a 0.992-m (40-in) pendulum (four times as tall as a 0.248-m pendulum) takes
2 s to complete its cycle and is appropriate for a floor clock that advances its second hand
by 2 s per cycle.

Fig. 9.1.3 The swinging pendulum

each cycle takes 1 s to complete and

Because a pendulumâs period depends on its length and gravity, a change in either one
causes trouble. As we learned in Chapter 7, materials expand with increasing temperature,
so a simple pendulum slows down as it heats up. A more accurate pendulum is thermally
compensated by using several different materials with different coefficients of loudness
expansion to ensure that its center of mass remains at a fixed distance from its pivot.
Although gravity doesnât change with time, it does vary slightly from place to place.
To correct for differences in gravity between the factory and a clockâs final destination, its
pendulum has a threaded adjustment knob. This knob allows you to change the pendulumâs
length to fine-tune its period.
Check Your Understanding #3: Swing Time
A child swinging on a swing set travels back and forth at a steady pace. What determines the period
of the childâs motion?
Answer: The strength of Earthâs gravity and the length of the swingâs chains.
Why: A child swinging on a swing set is a form of pendulum. As with any pendulum, the childâs period
of motion is determined only by the strength of gravity and the length of the pendulum. In this case,
the length of the pendulum is approximately the length of the swingâs supporting chains. Thus, a tall
swing has a longer period than a short swing.

Fig. 9.1.4 A pendulum
clock uses a swinging
pendulum to determine
how quickly a toothed
wheel turns and advances
a series of gears that
control the hands of the
clock. The anchor permits
the toothed wheel to
advance by one tooth
each time the pendulum
completes a full cycle.

Although a pendulum maintains a steady beat, itâs not a complete clock. Something must
keep the pendulum swinging and use that swing to determine the time. A pendulum clock
does both. It sustains the pendulumâs motion with gentle pushes, and it uses that motion to
advance its hands at a steady rate.
The top of the pendulum has a two-pointed anchor that controls the rotation of a
toothed wheel (Fig. 9.1.4). This mechanism is called an escapement. A weighted cord
wrapped around the toothed wheelâs shaft exerts a torque on that wheel, so that the wheel
would spin if the anchor werenât holding it in place. Each time the pendulum reaches the
end of a swing, one point of the anchor releases the toothed wheel while the other point
catches it. The wheel turns slowly as the pendulum rocks back and forth, advancing by one
tooth for each full cycle of the pendulum. This wheel turns a series of gears, which slowly
advance the clockâs hands. Although these hands are actually counting the number of pendulum swings since midnight, their movement is calibrated so that their positions indicate
the current time.
The toothed wheel also keeps the pendulum moving by giving the anchor a tiny
forward push each time the pendulum completes a swing. Since the anchor moves in the
direction of the push, the wheel does work on the anchor and pendulum, and replaces energy
lost to friction and air resistance. This energy comes from the weighted cord, which releases
gravitational potential energy as its weight descends. When you wind the clock, you rewind
this cord around the shaft, lifting the weight and replenishing its potential energy.
While these pushes from the toothed wheel can keep even the clumsiest pendulum
swinging, a clock works best when its pendulum swings with almost perfect freedom.
Thatâs because any outside forceâeven the push from the toothed wheelâwill influence
the pendulumâs period. The most accurate timekeepers are those that can oscillate without
any assistance or energy replacement for thousands or millions of cycles. These precision
timekeepers need only the slightest pushes to keep them moving and thus have extremely
precise periods. Thatâs why a good pendulum clock uses an aerodynamic pendulum and
low-friction bearings.
Finally, the clock must keep the oscillation amplitude of its pendulum relatively constant. From a practical perspective, drastic changes in that amplitude will make the toothed
wheel turn erratically. However, there is a more fundamental reason to keep the pendulumâs

Clocks

237

amplitude steady: itâs not really a perfect harmonic oscillator. If you displace the pendulum
too far, it becomes an anharmonic oscillatorâits restoring force ceases to be proportional
to its displacement from equilibrium, and its period begins to depend on its amplitude. Since
a change in period will spoil the clockâs accuracy, the pendulumâs amplitude must be kept
small and steady. That way, the amplitude has almost no effect on the pendulumâs period.

Check Your Understanding #4: Swing High, Swing Low
When pushing a child on a playground swing, you normally push her forward as she moves away from
you. What happens if you push her forward each time she moves toward you?
Answer: The amplitude of her motion will gradually decrease so that she comes to a stop.
Why: To keep her swinging, you must make up for the energy she loses to friction and air resistance.
By pushing her forward each time she moves away from you, you do work on her and increase her
energy. However, when you push her as she moves toward you, she does work on you and you extract
some of her energy. You are then slowing her down rather than sustaining her motion.

Balance Clocks
Because it relies on gravity for its restoring force, a swinging pendulum mustnât be tilted
or moved. Thatâs why there are so few pendulum-based wristwatches. To make use of the
excellent timekeeping characteristics of a harmonic oscillator, a portable clock needs some
other restoring force thatâs proportional to displacement but independent of gravity. It
needs a spring!
As we saw in Section 3.1, the force a spring exerts is proportional to its distortion. The
more you stretch, compress, or bend a spring, the harder it pushes back toward its equilibrium shape. Attach a block of wood to the free end of a spring, stretch it gently, and let go,
and youâll find you have a harmonic oscillator with a period determined only by the stiffness of the spring and the blockâs mass (Fig. 9.1.5). Since the period of a harmonic oscillator doesnât depend on the amplitude of its motion, the block oscillates steadily about its
equilibrium position and makes an excellent timekeeper.
Unfortunately, gravity complicates this simple system. Although gravity doesnât
alter the blockâs period, it does shift the blockâs equilibrium position downward. That

shift is a problem for a clock that might be tilted sometimes. However, thereâs another
spring-based timekeeper that marks time accurately in any orientation or location. This
ingenious device, used in most mechanical clocks and watches, is called a balance ring
or simply a balance.
A balance ring resembles a tiny metal bicycle wheel, supported at its center of mass/
gravity by an axle and a pair of bearings (Fig. 9.1.6). Any friction in the bearings is exerted
so close to the ringâs axis of rotation that it produces little torque and the ring turns
extremely easily. Moreover, the ring pivots about its own center of gravity so that its weight
produces no torque on it. In keeping with its name, the balance is balanced.
The only thing exerting a torque on the balance ring is a tiny coil spring. One end of
this spring is attached to the ring, while the other is fixed to the body of the clock. When
the spring is undistorted, it exerts no torque on the ring and the ring is in equilibrium. If
you rotate the ring either way, however, torque from the distorted spring will act to restore
it to its equilibrium orientation. Since this restoring torque is proportional to the ringâs
rotation away from a stable equilibrium, the balance ring and coil spring form a harmonic
oscillator!
Because of the rotational character of this harmonic oscillator, its period depends on
the torsional stiffness of the coil spring, that is, on how rapidly the springâs torque
increases as you twist it, and on the balance ringâs rotational mass. Since the balance
ringâs period doesnât depend on the amplitude of its motion, it keeps excellent time. Also,
because gravity exerts no torque on the balance ring, this timekeeper works anywhere and
in any orientation.
The rest of a balance clock is similar to a pendulum clock (Fig. 9.1.7). As the balance
ring rocks back and forth, it tips a lever that controls the rotation of a toothed wheel. An
anchor attached to the lever allows the toothed wheel to advance one tooth for each complete cycle of the balance ringâs motion. Gears connect the toothed wheel to the clockâs
hands, which slowly advance as the wheel turns.
Because the balance clock is portable, it canât draw energy from a weighted cord.
Instead, it has a main spring that exerts a torque on the toothed wheel. This main spring is
a coil of elastic metal that stores energy when you wind the clock. Its energy keeps the
balance ring rocking steadily back and forth and also turns the clockâs hands. Since the

Check Your Understanding #5: A Little Light Entertainment
When you accidentally strike a chandelier with a broom, this hanging lamp begins to twist back and
forth with a regular period. What determines its period of oscillation?
Answer: Itâs determined by the torsional stiffness of the chandelierâs supporting cord and the chandelierâs rotational mass.
Why: The hanging chandelier is a harmonic oscillator. Its supporting cord opposes any twists by
exerting a restoring force on the chandelier. Once you twist it away from its equilibrium orientation,
the chandelier oscillates back and forth with a period determined only by the cordâs torsional stiffness
(its stiffness with respect to twists) and the chandelierâs rotational mass. As with any harmonic oscillator, the amplitude of the chandelierâs motion doesnât affect its period.

Electronic Clocks
The potential accuracy of pendulum and balance clocks is limited by friction, air resistance, and thermal expansion to about 10 s per year. To do better, a clockâs timekeeper must
avoid these mechanical shortcomings. Thatâs why so many modern clocks use quartz oscillators as their timekeepers.
A quartz oscillator is made from a single crystal of quartz, the same mineral found
in most white sand. Like many hard and brittle objects, a quartz crystal oscillates
strongly after being struck. In fact, itâs a harmonic oscillator because it acts like a spring
with a metal cylinder at each end (Fig. 9.1.8, left). The two cylinders oscillate in and out
symmetrically about their combined center of mass, with a period determined only by
the cylindersâ masses and the springâs stiffness. In a quartz crystal, the spring is the
crystal itself and the cylindersâ are its two halves (Fig. 9.1.8, right). Since their restoring
forces are proportional to displacement from equilibrium, both systems are harmonic
oscillators.
Because of its exceptional hardness, a quartz crystalâs restoring forces are extremely
stiff. Even a tiny distortion leads to huge restoring forces. Since the period of a harmonic
oscillator decreases as its spring becomes stiffer, a typical quartz oscillator has an extremely
short period. Its motion is usually called a vibration rather than an oscillation because
vibration implies a fast oscillation in a mechanical system. Oscillation itself is a more general term for any repetitive process, and it can even apply to such nonmechanical processes
as electric or thermal oscillations.

Because of its rapid vibration, a quartz oscillatorâs period is a small fraction of a
second. We normally characterize such a fast oscillator by its frequency, the number of
cycles it completes in a certain amount of time. The SI unit of frequency is the cycle per
second, also called the hertz (abbreviated Hz) after German physicist Heinrich Rudolph
Hertz. Period and frequency are reciprocals of one another,

period

so an oscillator with a period of 0.001 s has a frequency of 1000 Hz.
Because the vibrating crystal isnât sliding across anything or moving quickly through
the air, it loses energy slowly and vibrates for a long, long time. Also, because quartzâs
coefficient of thermal expansion is extremely small, the crystalâs period is nearly indepen-dent of its temperature. With its exceptionally steady period, a quartz oscillator can
serve as the timekeeper for a highly accurate clock, one that loses or gains less than a tenth
of a second per year.
Of course, a quartz crystal isnât a complete clock. Like the pendulum and balance, it
needs something to keep it vibrating and to use that vibration to determine the time.
Although these tasks could conceivably be done mechanically, quartz clocks are normally
electronic. There are two reasons for this choice. First, the crystalâs vibrations are too fast
and too small for most mechanical devices to follow. Second, a quartz crystal is intrinsically electronic itself; it responds mechanically to electrical stress and electrically to mechanical stress. Because of this coupling between its mechanical and electrical behaviors,
crystalline quartz is known as a piezoelectric material and is ideal for electronic clocks.
The clockâs circuitry uses electrical stresses to keep the quartz crystal vibrating (Fig.
9.1.9). Just as carefully timed pushes keep a child swinging endlessly on a playground
swing, carefully timed electrical stresses keep the quartz crystal vibrating endlessly in its
holder. Because the crystal loses so little energy with each vibration, only a tiny amount of
work is required each cycle to maintain its vibration.
The clock also detects the crystalâs vibrations electrically. Each time its halves move
in or out, the crystal experiences mechanical stress and emits a pulse of electricity. These
pulses may control an electric motor that advances clock hands or may serve as input to an
electronic chip that measures time by counting the pulses.
The quartz crystals used in clocks and watches are carefully cut and polished to vibrate
at specific frequencies. In effect, these crystals are tuned like musical instruments to match
the requirements of their clocks. Because counting each vibration of the crystal consumes
energy, we can prolong clocksâ battery lives by using crystals that vibrate relatively
slowlyâjust above the range of human hearing. To make a small crystal vibrate slowly, the
manufacturer cuts away most of the center of that crystal to weaken its restoring forces and
slow its oscillations. The resulting quartz âtuning forkâ oscillator (Fig 9.1.10) is carefully
metalized to permit the watch to interact with it electrically and then itâs tuned: a laser
beam slowly evaporates the metal from the tips of the fork, decreasing its mass and increasing its frequency, until the desired frequency is reached.

If you drop a metal rod on the floor, end first, you hear a high-pitched tone. Whatâs happening?
Answer: The rod is vibrating as a harmonic oscillator, with its two halves first approaching one another

Why: The metal rod vibrates in the same manner as a quartz crystal. The body of the rod exerts
restoring forces on its two halves. After hitting the floor, these halves move toward and away from one
another rapidly, emitting the tone that you hear. Because itâs a harmonic oscillator, the frequency
(and pitch) of the tone doesnât change as the amplitude of motion decreases.

Experiments to Do: Find a violin or guitar, or stretch a strong
string between two rigid supports. Even a rubber band will do
in a pinch. Pluck the string with your finger and listen to the
tone it makes. The string vibrates back and forth at a particular frequency or pitch even as its amplitude of motion gradually decreases. What kind of oscillator has that behavior?
Change the stringâs frequency of vibration by changing its
tension or length. What happens when you shorten the string or
prevent part of it from moving? What happens if you increase its
tension by pulling it tighter? You can also increase the stringâs
mass by wrapping it with tape. How does that affect its pitch?
You can imitate a pipe organ by blowing gently across
the mouth of a bottle or soda straw. If done properly, youâll get
the air inside the bottle vibrating up and down rhythmically
and youâll hear a tone. What happens to its pitch when you add
water to the bottle or pinch off the straw at various points? Why
does this tone sound different from that of the string, even
when the two have the same pitch?
Finally, a table or plate will act like a drum when you tap
it. Compare the sound it makes with those of the previous two
âinstruments.â Does it have a pitch? What distinguishes the
sounds of different tables or plates?

Sound and Music
To understand how instruments work, we need to know a bit more about sound and music.
In air, sound consists of density waves, patterns of compressions and rarefactions that travel
outward rapidly from their source. When a sound passes by, the air pressure in your ear
fluctuates up and down about normal atmospheric pressure. Even when these fluctuations
have amplitudes less than a millionth of atmospheric pressure, you hear them as sound.
When the fluctuations are repetitive, you hear a tone with a pitch equal to the fluctuationâs frequency. Pitch is the frequency of a sound. A bass singerâs pitch range extends
from 80 to 300 Hz, while that of a soprano singer extends from 300 to 1100 Hz. Musical
instruments can produce tones over a much wider range of pitches, but we can hear only
those between about 30 and 20,000 Hz, and that range narrows as we get older.
Most music is constructed around intervals, the frequency ratio between two different
tones. This ratio is found by dividing one toneâs frequency by that of the other. Our hearing
is particularly sensitive to intervals, with pairs of tones at equal intervals sounding quite
similar to one another. For example, a pair of tones at 440 and 660 Hz sounds similar to a
pair at 330 and 495 Hz because they both have the interval 3/2.
The interval 3/2 is pleasing to most ears and is common in Western music, where itâs
called a fifth. A fifth is the interval between the two âtwinklesâ at the beginning of âTwinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star.â If your ear is good, you can start with any tone for the first twinkle
and will easily find the second tone, located at 3/2 the frequency of the first. Your ear hears
that factor of 3/2 between the two frequencies.
The most important interval in virtually all music is 2/1, or an octave. Tones that differ
by a factor of 2 in frequency sound so similar to our ears that we often think of them as

music.

being the same. When men and women sing together âin unison,â they often sing an octave
or two apart, and the differences in the tones, always factors of 2 or 4 in frequency, are only
barely noticeable.
The octave is so important that it structures the entire range of audible pitches. Most of
the subtle interplay of tones in music occurs in intervals of less than an octave, less than a
factor of 2 in frequency. Thus most traditions build their music around the intervals that lie
within a single octave, such as 5/4 and 3/2. They pick a particular standard pitch and then
assign notes at specific intervals from this standard pitch. This arrangement repeats at
octaves above and below the standard pitch to create a complete scale of notes. (For a history of scales, see 4 .)
The scale used in Western music is constructed around a note called A4, which has a
standard pitch of 440 Hz. At intervals of 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, and 15/8 above A4 lie the six
notes B4, C#5, D5, E5, F#5, and G#5. Similar collections of six notes are built above A5 (880
Hz), which has a frequency twice that of A4, and above A3 (220 Hz), which has a frequency
half that of A4. In fact, this pattern repeats above A1 (55 Hz) through A8 (7040 Hz).
Actually, Western music is built around 12 notes and 11 intervals that lie within a
single octave. Five more intervals account for five additional notes, Bb4, C5, D#5, F5, and
G5. Itâs also not quite true that every note is based exclusively on its interval from A4. While
A4 remains at 440 Hz, the pitches of the other 11 notes have been modified slightly so that
theyâre at interesting and pleasing intervals from one another as well as from A4. This
adjustment of the pitches led to the well-tempered scale that has been the basis for Western
music for the last several centuries.

A typical singing voice can cover a range of about two octavesâfor example, from C4 to C6. How
broad is this range of frequencies?
Answer: There is a factor of 4 in frequency between the lowest and the highest notes that the typical
voice can sing.

Why: Since notes separated by an octave are separated by a factor of 2 in frequency, notes separated
by two octaves are separated by a factor of 4.

A Violinâs Vibrating String
The tones produced by a violin begin as vibrations in its strings. On their own, these strings
are limp and shapeless so they rely on the violinâs rigid body and neck for structure. The
violin subjects its strings to tension, outward forces that act to stretch it, and this tension
gives each string an equilibrium shapeâa straight line.
To see that a straight violin string is in equilibrium, think of it as being composed of
many individual pieces that are connected together in a chain (Fig. 9.2.1). Tension exerts a
pair of outward forces on each piece of the string; its neighboring pieces are pulling that
piece toward them. Since the stringâs tension is uniform, these two outward forces sum to
zero; they have equal magnitudes but point in opposite directions. With zero net force on
each of its pieces, the straight string is in equilibrium.
When the string is curved, however, the pairs of outward forces no longer sum to zero
(Fig. 9.2.2). Although those outward forces still have equal magnitudes, they now point in
slightly different directions. As a result, each piece experiences a small net force.
The net forces on its pieces are restoring forces because they act to straighten the
string. If you distort the string and release it, these restoring forces will cause the string to
vibrate about its straight equilibrium shape in a natural resonance. The stringâs restoring
forces are special; the more you curve the string, the stronger the restoring forces on its
pieces become. In fact, the restoring forces are springlike forcesâthey increase in proportion to the stringâs distortionâso the string is a form of harmonic oscillator!

Musical Instruments

Actually, the string is much more complicated than a pendulum or a balance ring. It
can bend and vibrate in many distinct modes, or basic patterns of distortion, each with its
own period of vibration. Nonetheless, the string retains the most important feature of a
harmonic oscillator: the period of each vibrational mode is independent of its amplitude.
Thus a violin stringâs pitch doesnât depend on how hard itâs vibrating. Think how tricky it
would be to play a violin if its pitch depended on its loudness!
A violin string has one simplest vibrationâits fundamental vibrational mode. In
this mode, the entire string arcs alternately one way and then the other (Fig. 9.2.3). Its
kinetic energy peaks as it rushes through its straight equilibrium shape, and its potential
energy (elastic potential energy in the string) peaks as it stops to turn around. The stringâs
midpoint travels the farthest (the vibrational antinode), while its ends remain fixed (the
vibrational nodes). At each moment, its shape is the gradual curve of the trigonometric
sine function.
In this fundamental mode, the violin string behaves as a single harmonic oscillator. As
with any harmonic oscillator, its vibrational period depends only on the stiffness of its
restoring forces and on its inertia. Either stiffening the violin string or reducing its mass
will quicken its fundamental vibration and increase its fundamental pitch.
A violin has four strings, each with its own stiffness and mass, and therefore with its
own fundamental pitch. In a tuned violin, the notes produced by these strings are G3
(196 Hz), D4 (294 Hz), A4 (440 Hz), and E5 (660 Hz). The G3 string, which vibrates rather
slowly, is the most massive. Itâs usually made of gut, wrapped in a coil of heavy metal wire.
The E5 string, on the other hand, must vibrate quite rapidly and so needs to have a low
mass. Itâs usually a thin steel wire.
You tune a violin by adjusting the tension in its strings using the pegs in its neck and
tension adjusters on the tailpiece. Tightening the string stiffens it by increasing both the
outward forces on its pieces and the net forces they experience during a distortion. Since
temperature and time can alter a stringâs tension, you should always tune your violin just
before a concert.
A stringâs fundamental pitch also depends on its length. Shortening the string both
stiffens it and reduces its mass, so its pitch increases. That stiffening occurs because a
shorter string curves more sharply when itâs displaced from equilibrium and therefore subjects its pieces to larger net forces. This dependence on length allows you to raise a stringâs
pitch by pressing it against the fingerboard in the violinâs neck and effectively shortening
it. Part of a violinistâs skill involves knowing exactly where on the string to press it against
the fingerboard to produce a particular note.
If the arc of a string vibrating in its fundamental mode reminds you of a wave, thatâs
because it is one. Itâs a mechanical wave, the natural motions of an extended object about
its stable equilibrium shape or situation. An extended object is one like a string, stick, or
lake surface that has many parts that move with limited independence. Since its parts influence one another, an extended object with a stable equilibrium exhibits fascinating natural
motions that involve many parts moving at once; it exhibits mechanical waves.
With its innumerable linked pieces and its stable equilibrium shape, the violin string
exhibits such waves. The stringâs fundamental mode is a particularly simple wave, a standing wave, which is a wave with fixed nodes and antinodes. A standing waveâs basic shape
doesnât change with time; it merely scales up and down rhythmically at a particular frequency and amplitude (its peak extent of motion). Most important, the standing wave
doesnât travel along the string.

Although this wave extends along the string, its associated oscillation is perpendicular

Waves on strings, drums, and the surface of water are all transverse waves.
Check Your Understanding #2: Feeling Tense?
A common way to determine the tension in a cord is to pluck it and listen for how fast it vibrates. Why
does this technique measure tension?
Answer: The frequency of a stringâs fundamental vibrational mode increases with its tension.
Why: Any cord that is drawn taut from its ends will exhibit natural resonances like those in a violin
string. The tauter the string, the higher will be the frequencies of those resonances.

The Violin Stringâs Harmonics
The fundamental vibrational mode isnât the only way in which a violin string can vibrate.
The string also has higher-order vibrational modes in which the string vibrates as a chain
of shorter strings arcing in alternate directions (Fig. 9.2.5). Each of these higher-order
vibrational modes is another standing wave, with a fixed shape that scales up and down
rhythmically at its own frequency and amplitude.

For example, the string can vibrate as two half-strings arcing in opposite directions and
separated by a motionless vibrational node. In this mode, the violin string not only vibrates as
half-strings but has the pitch of half-strings as well. Remarkably, that half-string pitch is
exactly twice the whole-string (fundamental) pitch! In general, a stringâs vibrational frequency
is inversely proportional to its length, so halving its length doubles its frequency. Frequencies
that are integer multiples of the fundamental pitch are called harmonics, so this half-string
vibration occurs at the second harmonic pitch and is called the second harmonic mode.
A violin string can also vibrate as three third-strings, with a frequency thatâs three
times the fundamental. The interval between this third harmonic pitch and the fundamental
pitch is an octave and a fifth (2/1 times 3/2). Overall, the fundamental and its second and
third harmonics sound very pleasant together.
While the violin string can vibrate in even higher harmonics, whatâs more important is
that the string often vibrates in more than one mode at the same time. For example, a violin
string vibrating in its fundamental mode can also vibrate in its second harmonic and emit
two tones at once.
Harmonics are important because bowing a violin excites many of its vibrational
modes. The violinâs sound is thus a rich mixture of the fundamental tone and the harmonics. Known as timbre, this mixture of tones is characteristic of a violin, which is why an
instrument producing a different mixture doesnât sound like a violin.
When a violin string is vibrating in several modes at once, its shape and motion are
complicated. The individual standing waves add on top of one another, a process known as
superposition. Each vibrational mode has its own amplitude and therefore its own loudness contribution to the stringâs timbre.
While these individual waves coexist beautifully on the string, with virtually no effect
on one another, the stringâs overall distorted shape is now the superposition of the individual wave shapes. Not only is that overall shape quite complicated, it also actually
changes substantially with time. Thatâs because the different harmonic waves vibrate at
different frequencies, and their superposition changes as they change. The stringâs overall
wave is not a standing wave, and its features can even move along the string!
Check Your Understanding #3: Swinging High and Low Together
When two people swing a long jump rope, they can make it swing as a single arc or as two half-ropes
arcing in opposite directions. To make the rope swing as two half-ropes, it must be turned faster or
with less tension. Why?
Answer: A jump rope is essentially a vibrating string. The two-half-rope pattern is the second harmonic mode, with a vibrational frequency twice that of the normal fundamental arc.
Why: Although it swings around in a circle, the jump rope is actually vibrating up and down at the
same time itâs vibrating forward and back. Together, these two vibrations create the circular motion.
To make the rope vibrate in its second harmonic mode (as two half-ropes) without changing its tension, it must be swung twice as fast as normal.

Bowing and Plucking the Violin String
You play a violin by drawing a bow across its strings. The bow consists of horsehair, pulled
taut by a wooden stick and coated with rosin, a sticky substance based on pine sap. This
coated horsehair exerts frictional forces on the strings as it moves across them. Most important, however, is that it exerts much larger static frictional forces than sliding ones.
As the sticky bow hairs rub across a string, they grab the string and push it forward
with static friction. Eventually the stringâs restoring force overpowers static friction, and
the string suddenly starts sliding backward across the hairs. Because the hairs exert little
sliding friction, the string completes half a vibrational cycle with ease. As it stops to reverse
direction, however, the hairs grab the string again and begin pushing it forward. This process repeats over and over.

energy transfer makes

Because the sound must

frequency of the glass,
only the most extraordinary
opera singers can break a
crystal wineglass.

Each time the bow pushes the string forward, it does work on the string and adds
energy to the stringâs vibrational modes. This process is an example of resonant energy
transfer, in which a modest force doing work in synchrony with a natural resonance can
transfer a large amount of energy to that resonance. Just as gentle, carefully timed pushes
can get a child swinging high on a playground swing, so too can gentle, carefully timed
pushes from a bow get a string vibrating vigorously on a violin. Similar rhythmic pushes
can cause other objects to vibrate strongly, notably a crystal wineglass (Fig. 9.2.6) and the
Tacoma Narrows Bridge near Seattle, Washington (Fig. 9.2.7). The wineglassâs response to
a certain tone is also an example of sympathetic vibration, the transfer of vibrational
energy between two systems that share a common vibrational frequency.
The amount of energy the bow adds to each vibrational mode depends on where it
crosses the violin string. When you bow the string at the usual position, you produce a
strong fundamental vibration and a moderate amount of each harmonic. Bowing the string
nearer its middle reduces the stringâs curvature, weakening its harmonic vibrations and
giving it a more mellow sound. Bowing the string nearer its end increases the stringâs
curvature, strengthening its harmonic vibrations and giving it a brighter sound.
The sound of a plucked violin string also depends on harmonic content and thus on
where that string is plucked. However, this sound is quite different from that of a bowed
string. The difference lies in the soundâs envelope, the way the sound evolves with time.
This envelope can be viewed as having three time periods: an initial attack, an intermediate
sustain, and a final decay. The envelope of a plucked string is an abrupt attack followed
immediately by a gradual decay. In contrast, the envelope of a bowed string is a gradual
attack, a steady sustain, and then a gradual decay. We learn to recognize individual instruments not only by their harmonic content but also by their sound envelopes.
Check Your Understanding #4: Whatâs the Buzz?
Sometimes a tone from an instrument or sound system will cause some object in the room to begin
vibrating loudly. Why does this happen?
Answer: The object has a natural resonance at the toneâs frequency, and sympathetic vibration is
transferring energy to the object.
Why: Energy moves easily between two objects that vibrate at the same frequency. A note played on
one instrument will cause the same note on another instrument to begin playing. Even everyday
objects will exhibit sympathetic vibration when the right tone is present in the air.

An Organ Pipeâs Vibrating Air
Like a violin, a pipe organ uses vibrations to create sound. However, its vibrations take
place in the air itself. An organ pipe is essentially a hollow cylinder, open at each end
and filled with air. Because that air is protected by the rigid walls of the pipe, its pressure can fluctuate up and down relative to atmospheric pressure and it can exhibit
natural resonances.
In its fundamental vibrational mode, air moves alternately toward and away from the
pipeâs center (Fig. 9.2.8), like two blocks on a spring. As air moves toward the pipeâs center, the density there rises and a pressure imbalance develops. Since the pressure at the
pipeâs center is higher than at its ends, air accelerates away from the center. The air eventually stops moving inward and begins to move outward. As air moves away from the
pipeâs center, the density there drops and a reversed pressure imbalance occurs. Since the
pressure at the pipeâs center is lower than at its ends, air now accelerates toward the center.
It eventually stops moving outward and begins to move inward, and the cycle repeats. The
airâs kinetic energy peaks each time it rushes through that equilibrium and its potential
energy (pressure potential energy in the air) peaks each time it stops to turn around.
This air is vibrating about a stable equilibrium of uniform atmospheric density and
pressure, and it is clearly experiencing restoring forces. It should come as no surprise that
those restoring forces are springlike and that the air column is yet another harmonic oscillator. As such, its vibrational frequency depends only on the stiffness of its restoring forces
and on its inertia. Either stiffening the air column or reducing its mass will quicken its
vibration and increase its pitch.
These characteristics depend on the length of the organ pipe. A shorter pipe not only
holds less air mass than a longer pipe, it also offers stiffer opposition to any movements of
air in and out of that pipe. With less room in the shorter pipe, the pressure inside it rises and
falls more abruptly, leading to stiffer restoring forces on the moving air. Together, these
effects make the air in a shorter pipe vibrate faster than the air in a longer pipe. In general,
an organ pipeâs vibrational frequency is inversely proportional to its length.
Unfortunately, the mass of vibrating air in a pipe also increases with the airâs average
density, so even a modest change in temperature or weather will alter the pipeâs pitch. Fortunately, all the pipes shift together so that an organ continues to sound in tune. Nonetheless, this shift may be noticeable when the organ is part of an orchestra.

As you may suspect, the fundamental vibrational mode of air in the organ pipe is
another standing wave. Air in the pipe is an extended object with a stable equilibrium, and
the disturbance associated with its fundamental vibrational mode has a basic shape that
doesnât change with time; it merely scales up and down rhythmically.
However, the shape of the wave in the pipeâs air now has to do with back-and-forth
compressions and rarefaction, not with side-to-side displacements, as it did in the violin
string. In fact, all the waveâs associated oscillation is along the pipe and therefore along the
wave itself. A wave in which the underlying oscillation is parallel to the wave itself is called
a longitudinal wave (Fig. 9.2.9). Waves in the air, including those inside organ pipes and
other wind instruments and those in the open air, are all longitudinal waves.

If you blow across a soda bottle, it emits a tone. Why does adding water to the bottle raise the pitch
of that tone?
Answer: The water shortens the column of moving air inside the bottle and increases the frequency
of its fundamental vibrational mode.

(a)

Why: A water bottle is essentially a pipe that is open at only one end. It has a fundamental vibrational
mode with a frequency that is half that of an open pipe of equal length. As you add water to the
bottle, you shorten the effective length of the pipe and raise its pitch.

lower opening in an organ
pipe is cut in its side for
practical reasons.

The organ uses resonant energy transfer to make the air in a pipe vibrate. It starts this
transfer by blowing air across the pipeâs lower opening (Fig. 9.2.10a), although for
practical reasons that lower opening is usually found on the pipeâs side (Fig. 9.2.10b).
As the air flows across the opening, itâs easily deflected to one side or the other and
tends to follow any air thatâs already moving into or out of the pipe. If the air inside the
pipe is vibrating, the new air will follow it in perfect synchrony and strengthen the
vibration.
This following process is so effective at enhancing vibrations that it can even initiate
a vibration from the random noise thatâs always present in a pipe. Thatâs how the sound
starts when the organâs pump first blows air across the pipe. Once the vibration has
started, it grows quickly in amplitude. That amplitude increases until energy leaves the
pipe as sound and heat as quickly as it arrives via compressed air. The more air the organ
blows across the pipe each second, the more power it delivers to the pipe and the louder
the vibration.

Like a violin string, an organ pipe can support more than one mode of vibration. In its
fundamental vibrational mode, the pipeâs entire column of air vibrates together. In the
higher-order vibrational modes, this air column vibrates as a chain of shorter air columns
moving in alternate directions. If the pipe has a constant width, these vibrations occur at
harmonics of the fundamental. When the air column vibrates as two half-columns, its pitch
is exactly twice that of the fundamental mode. When it vibrates as three third-columns, its
pitch is exactly three times that of the fundamental. And so on.
Also, the air column inside a pipe can vibrate in more than one mode simultaneously.
As with a violin string, the standing waves superpose and the fundamental and harmonic
tones are produced together. The shape of the organ pipe and the place where air is blown
across it determine the pipeâs harmonic content and thus its timbre. Different pipes can
imitate different instruments. To sound like a flute, the pipe emits mostly the fundamental
tone and keep the harmonics fairly quiet. To sound like a clarinet, its harmonics must be
much louder. An organ pipeâs loudness always builds slowly during the attack, so it canât
pretend to be a plucked string. However, a clever designer can make the organ imitate a
surprising range of instruments.
Check Your Understanding #6: An Across Blow
To make the air in a soda bottle vibrate, you must blow across the bottleâs mouth. Why doesnât blowing into its mouth work?
Answer: By blowing across the mouth, you let air that is already vibrating in the bottle redirect your
breath so that it enhances the vibration. Blowing into the bottleâs mouth merely compresses the air
inside the bottle.
Why: Like the bow of a violin moving across its strings, your breath moving across the bottleâs mouth
enhances the airâs vibration via resonant energy transfer. The spontaneous redirection of your breath
when you blow across the bottleâs mouth leads to rhythmic pushes that are perfectly synchronized
with the airâs vibration.

A Drumâs Vibrating Surface
After examining violin strings and organ pipes, you might think that drums have no new
physics concepts to show us. But while a drumhead is yet another extended object with a
stable equilibrium and springlike restoring forces, its overtone vibrations have an important
difference: they arenât harmonics.
Violin strings and organ pipes are effectively one-dimensional or linelike objects,
dividing easily into half-objects or third-objects that then vibrate at second or third harmonic pitches. Together with the many other one-dimensional instruments in an orchestra
or band, they blend seamlessly when theyâre playing the same fundamental pitch because
they share the same harmonics.
However, because a drumhead is effectively two-dimensional or surfacelike, it doesnât
divide easily into pieces that resemble the entire drumhead. As a result, the pitches of its
overtone vibrations have no simple relationship to its fundamental pitch. A timpani stands
out relative to other instruments in part because of the unique overtone pitches.
Figure 9.2.11 illustrates the fundamental (Fig. 9.2.11a) and five lowest-pitched overtone (Fig. 9.2.11bâf) vibrational modes for a drumhead. Each vibrational mode is a
standing wave but with vibrational nodes that are curves or lines rather than points. The
fundamental mode (Fig. 9.2.11a) has only one node on its outer edge, while the overtone
modes have additional nodes within the surface. In each vibrational mode, these nodes
remain motionless as the rest of the surface vibrates up and down, its peaks and valleys
interchanging alternately. The pitches of the overtone vibrations are indicated relative to
the pitch of the fundamental vibration. (For a historical note on the understanding of
surface modes, see 5 ).

Because striking a drumhead causes it to vibrate in several modes at once, the drum
emits several pitches simultaneously. The amplitude of each mode, and consequently its
loudness, depends not only on how hard you hit the drumhead but also on where you hit it.
If you hit it at its center, it vibrates primarily in circular modes (Fig. 9.2.11a,d). If you hit
it nearer its edge, it also vibrates in noncircular modes (Fig. 9.2.11b,c,e,f).
A timpani sounds most musical when itâs struck off-center in such a way that the amplitude of its fundamental vibrational mode is nearly zero and its overtones, particularly Fig.
9.2.11b, dominate its sound. Thatâs because the fundamental vibrational mode emits sound
so efficiently that its vibrational energy dissipates before it can produce a discernible tone.
Unless all you want is a loud thump, you must hit the timpani off-center so that its longlived overtone vibrations receive most of the energy and emit most of the sound. The dominant pitch of a properly played timpani is that of its first overtone vibration, and it is tuned
with that pitch in mind.
In truth, the pitches shown in Fig. 9.2.11 neglect the effects of airâs inertia on the drumheadâs vibrations. Since air adds inertia to the drumhead, it lowers the pitches of all the
vibrational modes, some more than others. Because of airâs influence on pitch, a drum must
be tuned to accommodate changes in temperature and weather.
Check Your Understanding #7: Space Kid One
A trampoline is hazardous with several children on it because a child landing on one side of its surface can launch skyward a second child standing on the other side of the surface. How does a downward impact on one side of the trampoline produce a sudden rise of the other side?
Answer: The off-center impact causes the surface to vibrate in its noncircular overtone modes. The
simplest such mode, Fig. 9.2.11b, has its two sides moving in alternate directions.
Why: The trampoline is essentially a drumhead, and the children are riding its vibrational modes.
Off-center impacts can cause the surface to vibrate in its overtone modes, and these can toss the
children in unexpected directions.

Sound in Air
All these vibrations would serve little purpose if we couldnât hear them, so itâs time to look
at how instruments produce sound. Weâll start by looking at sound itself.

Musical Instruments

We noted at the beginning of this section that sound in air consists of density
wavesâpatterns of compressions and rarefactions that travel outward rapidly from their
source. While that observation was mysterious at the time, we can now understand those
waves as vibrations in an extended object with a stable equilibrium. That extended
object is air.
Neglecting gravity, air is in a stable equilibrium when its density is uniform. If we
disturb it from equilibrium, the resulting pressure imbalances will provide springlike
restoring forces. These forces, together with airâs inertia, lead to rhythmic vibrationsâthe
vibrations of harmonic oscillators. In open air, the most basic vibrations are waves that
move steadily in a particular direction and are therefore called traveling waves. Like the
standing waves inside an organ pipe, the traveling waves in open air are longitudinalâair
vibrates along the same direction as the sound wave travels.
As it moves through the open air, a basic traveling sound wave consists of an
alternating pattern of high-density regions weâll call crests and low-density regions
weâll call troughs (Fig. 9.2.12). While those names will seem more appropriate when
we examine water surface waves in the next section, itâs customary to refer to the
alternating highs and lows of any wave as crests and troughs, respectively. Whether a
wave is standing or traveling, the shortest distance between two adjacent crests is
known as the wavelength.
A standing waveâs crests and troughs merely flip back and forth in place, crests becoming troughs and troughs becoming crests. However, a traveling waveâs crests and troughs
move steadily in a particular direction at a particular speed. The speed and direction of
travel together constitute the traveling waveâs wave velocity.
Figure 9.2.13 shows five snapshots of a simple sound wave thatâs heading toward the
right. If we watch airâs density at the same point in space (green line), it begins as a crest
(a), decreases (b) to a trough (c), then rises (d) back to a crest (e) during one complete
vibration cycle. However, if we follow the same crest (red line) over time, it travels one
wavelength to the right during one complete vibration cycle (aâe). Since a crest moves
one wavelength per vibration cycle and frequency is the number of vibration cycles per
second, the speed at which the crest moves is equal to the wavelength times the frequency.
That relationship can be written as a word equation:
wave speed = wavelength Âˇ frequency,

Remarkably enough, all sound waves travel at the same speed through air, regardless
of wavelength or frequency. Thatâs because as a sound waveâs wavelength increases, its
crests travel farther during one cycle of vibration but that cycle also takes longer. The two
changes balance one another, so the crests travel at the same speed. Longer wavelengths
lead to slower vibrations because broadening out the pressure variations in the sound wave
weakens its restoring forces. With softer restoring forces and the same inertia (that is, its
density), the air vibrates more slowly as the wavelength increases.
Equation 9.2.1 thus yields the same wave speed for any sound wave. Known as the
speed of sound in air, itâs about 331 m/s (1086 ft/s) under standard conditions at sea level
(0 Â°C, 101, 325 Pa pressure). Although thatâs fast, there is still a noticeable delay between

hall. Fortunately, because the speed of sound doesnât depend on frequency, when the entire
orchestra plays in unison you hear all its different pitches simultaneously.
This discussion of sound assumes that the instruments and listener maintain a constant
separation, as they usually do at an orchestra concert. However, when a marching band
steps quickly toward or away from the listener, something odd happens: the listener hears
its music shifted up or down in pitch. Known as the Doppler effect, this frequency shift
occurs because the listener encounters sound wave crests at a rate thatâs different from the
rate at which those crests were created. If an instrument and the listener are approaching
one another, the listener encounters the crests at an increased rate and the pitch increases.
If the two are moving away from one another, the listener encounters the crests at a
decreased rate and the pitch decreases. Fortunately, the Doppler effect is subtle at speeds
that are small compared to the speed of sound, so you can listen to parades without their
sounding flat or sharp.

Check Your Understanding #8: Sounds Faster
Helium in a toy balloon has the same stiffness as ordinary air, but its density and inertia are smaller.
How does this difference affect the speed of sound in helium?
Answer: Sound travels faster in helium than it does in ordinary air.
Why: With its reduced density and inertia, helium vibrates faster than air when the two gases carry
sound waves of equal wavelengths. Since the speed at which sound of a specific wavelength travels
is proportional to the frequency of that sound, the wave speed in helium is greater than that in air.

Check Your Figures #1: Underwater Sound
Although water is about 800 times as dense as ordinary air, water is also about 15,000 times as stiff
and its sound vibrations therefore have increased frequencies relative to those in air. When two sound
waves have equal wavelengths, the wave in water has a frequency about 4.3 times greater than the
wave in air. What is the speed of sound in water?
Answer: The speed of sound in water is about 1420 m/s (4700 ft/s).
Why: From Eq. 9.2.1, the wave speed in water must be 4.3 times the wave speed in air. Since the
sound waves have a wave speed of about 331 m/s in air, they must have a speed of about 331 m/s
times 4.3 or 1420 m/s in water.

Turning Vibrations into Sound
Anything that disturbs airâs otherwise uniform density can produce traveling sound waves.
Instruments emit sound by compressing and rarefying the nearby air in synch with their
own vibrations. How they accomplish this task differs from instrument to instrument, so
weâll have to look at them individually. As weâll see, some instruments find it easier to
produce sound than others.
A drum produces sound when its vibrating drumhead alternately compresses and rarefies the nearby air. As portions of that drumhead rise and fall, they upset the airâs uniform
density and thereby produce sound waves. Whenever it can, though, air simply flows
silently out of the drumheadâs way, leading to smaller density fluctuations and less intense
sound. For example, when the drumhead is experiencing one of the five overtone vibrations
shown in Fig. 9.2.11, air flows away from each rising peak in the undulating surface and
toward each falling valley. The overtone vibrations still manage to produce sound, but itâs
less intense and the vibrational energy in the drumhead transforms relatively inefficiently
into sound energy.
Airâs partial success in dodging the drumheadâs overtone vibrations allows those
overtones to complete many vibrational cycles before running out of vibrational

Musical Instruments

energy. Their vibrations are therefore long-lived and have distinct pitches. In contrast,
air has difficulty dodging the drumheadâs fundamental vibrational mode, which alternately compresses and rarefies the air so effectively that it transfers all its vibrational
energy to the air in just a few cycles. Thatâs why the fundamental vibrational mode of
a drumhead produces the intense and nearly pitchless âthumpâ sound that we associate
with a drum.
If air can dodge a vibrating surface, it can certainly dodge a vibrating string. Little
of a violinâs sound comes directly from its vibrating strings; the air simply skirts
around them. Instead, the violin creates sound with its top plate, or belly (Fig. 9.2.14).
The strings transfer their vibrational motions to the belly and the belly pushes on the
air to create sound.
Most of this vibrational energy flows into the belly through the violinâs bridge,
which holds the strings away from the violinâs body (Fig. 9.2.15). Beneath the G3-string
side of the bridge is the bass bar, a long wooden strip that stiffens the belly. Beneath the
E5-string side of the bridge is the sound post, a shaft that extends from the violinâs belly
to its back.
As a bowed string vibrates across the violinâs belly, it exerts a torque on the bridge
about the sound post. The bridge rotates back and forth, causing the bass bar and belly to
move in and out. The bellyâs motion produces most of the violinâs sound. Some of this
sound comes directly from the bellyâs outer surface, and the rest comes from its inner surface and must emerge through its S-shaped holes.
An organ pipe doesnât have to produce sound because that sound already exists. In
effect, the pipeâs vibrating column of air is a standing sound wave that gradually leaks out
of the pipe as a traveling one. Trapped sound is escaping from its container.
This conversion of a standing wave into a traveling wave isnât so remarkable because
the two types of waves are closely related. The pipeâs standing wave can be thought of as a
reflected traveling wave, a traveling wave thatâs bouncing back and forth between the two
ends of the pipe. Because of the reflections, the traveling wave is superposed with itself
heading in the opposite direction, and the sum of two equal but oppositely directed traveling waves is a standing wave!
The fact that sound reflects from the open end of an organ pipe is rather surprising. If
that end were closed, youâd probably expect a reflection. After all, sound echoes from cliffs
and other rigid surfaces. But sound partially reflects from a surprising range of other transitions, including the transition from inside a pipe to outside it. If you donât believe that,
clap your hands inside a long pipe and listen for the decaying echoes.
The reflections at the organ pipeâs open ends arenât perfect, so the trapped sound
wave gradually leaks out and becomes the sound you hear. This process of letting a
standing sound wave emerge slowly as a traveling wave is typical of woodwind and
brass instruments. The reflection at an open pipe end depends on the shape of that end.
Flaring it into the horn shape common in brass instruments reduces the reflection and
eases the transition from standing wave to traveling wave. Thatâs why horns project
sound so well.

Check Your Understanding #9: Air Guitar
Why does an acoustic guitar have a sound box?
Answer: The sound box transfers the vibrational energy of the strings to the air.
Why: Guitar strings are too narrow to push effectively on the air and emit sound. They do better by
transferring their energy to the body of the acoustic guitar so that its flat surfaces can push on the
air. An electric guitar avoids the need for a sound box by converting the stringâs vibrations directly
into electric currents and from there into movements of an audio speaker.

SECTION 9.3

The Sea

Breaking crest

Trough

The sea is never still. If youâve visited the seashore, youâve probably noticed two of the seaâs most important motions: tides and
surface waves. In this section, weâll examine the cycle of tides
and look at how surface waves travel across water. These water
waves can help us understand other wave phenomena, including the electromagnetic waves that are responsible for light and
the density waves that are the basis for sound.
Questions to Think About: Why do the tides vary in height
from place to place? Why are there no significant tides in a
lake or swimming pool? Why does high tide occur about every
12 hours? What moves in a water wave? Do all waves travel at

the same speed? How deep is a wave? Why do waves break
near shore? Why do waves always seem to head almost directly
toward shore? Why is there often a rhythm to the surf?
Experiments to Do: Although you can make water waves in a
basin or tub, they move too quickly for you to see them clearly.
You would do better to watch waves at the beach. On a calm
day, the sea is in its flat equilibrium shapeâbut when the
wind picks up, look out. How does wind affect the seaâs surface? If water waves contain energy, where does that energy
come from and what forms does it take in the water?
Watch a floating object move as a wave passes it. Does the
object travel with the wave? Does the water itself travel with the
wave? Can you think of other cases in which a disturbance
moves steadily forward but the material carrying the disturbance remains behind?
Now watch as waves break near the shore. If you look
around at different beaches, youâll find waves breaking in two
different ways. In some cases a wave will simply collapse into
churning froth, while in others its top will dive forward over the
water ahead of it. Can you see anything about the beaches or
water that might account for this difference?

The Tides

Moonâs

Earth

Fig. 9.3.1 The moonâs
gravity varies over the
surface of Earth. The closer
a point is to the moon,
the stronger the gravity it
experiences. This variation
in the moonâs gravity
produces the tides.

If you watch the sea for a few days, youâll notice the tides. In a cycle as old as the oceans
themselves, the water level rises for about 6Âź hours to reach high tide, drops for about 6Âź
hours to arrive at low tide, and then begins rising again. Once a wonderful mystery, we now
know that the tides are caused by Earthâs rotation, the moonâs gravity, and, to a lesser
extent, the sunâs gravity.
On Earth, the moonâs gravity is so weak that we normally donât notice it. The moon is
far away, and as we learned in Section 4.2, gravity diminishes with distance. But this
dependence on distance also means that the moonâs gravity is stronger on one side of Earth
than the other; you experience a stronger pull when youâre on the side of Earth nearest the
moon than you do when youâre on the side opposite it (Fig. 9.3.1). Although you canât feel
these variations in moon gravity yourself, Earthâs oceans respond to them. The oceans are
deformed by the moonâs gravity (Fig. 9.3.2), and this deformation produces the tides.
The differences between the moonâs gravity at particular locations on Earth and its
average strength for the entire Earth give rise to tidal forces, residual gravitational forces
that act to displace those locations relative to Earth as a whole. The near side of Earth is
pulled toward the moon more strongly than average, so it experiences a tidal force toward
the moon. The far side of Earth is pulled less strongly than average, so it experiences a tidal
force away from the moon.
If Earth were less rigid, these tidal forces would stretch it into an egg shape. The near
side of Earth would bulge outward toward the moon, while the far side of Earth would
bulge outward away from the moon. But while Earth itself is too stiff to deform much, the
oceans are not and they bulge outward in response to the tidal forces. Two tidal bulges
appear: one closest to the moon and one farthest from the moon (Fig. 9.3.2). The near-side
bulge develops because the water there tries to fall toward the moon faster than Earth does
as a whole. The far-side bulge forms because water there tries to fall toward the moon

surface as it rotates.

slower than Earth does as a whole. A beach located in one of these tidal bulges experiences
high tide, while one in the ring of ocean between the bulges experiences low tide.
As Earth rotates, the locations of the two tidal bulges move westward around the
equator. Since a particular beach experiences high tide whenever itâs closest to or farthest
from the moon, the full cycle from high to low to high tide occurs about once every 12 h and
24.4 min. The extra 24.4 min reflects the fact that the moon isnât stationary; it orbits Earth
and completes a lunar month (the time it takes for the moon to orbit Earth) every 29.53 days.
The moon thus passes overhead once every 24 h and 48.8 min, rather than every 24 h.
The moon isnât the only source of tidal forces on Earthâs oceans. Although the sun is
much farther away from Earth than the moon is, itâs so massive that the tidal forces it exerts
are almost half as large as those exerted by the moon. The sunâs principal effect is to
increase or decrease the strength of the tides caused by the moon (Fig. 9.3.3). When the
moon and the sun are aligned with one another, their tidal forces add together and produce
extra large tidal bulges. When the moon and the sun are at right angles to one another, their
tidal forces partially cancel and produce tidal bulges that are unusually small. Twice each
lunar month, the tides are particularly strong. These spring tides occur whenever the moon
and sun are aligned with one another (full moon and new moon). Twice each lunar month
the tides are particularly weak. These neap tides occur whenever the moon and sun are at
right angles to one another (half moon).
Because of this interplay between lunar and solar tidal effects, the cycle of tides varies
slightly from day to day. While the average cycle is 12 h and 24.4 min, it fluctuates over a lunar
month. Moreover, the exact moment of high or low tide at a particular location is influenced by
waterâs inertia, Earthâs rotation, and the environment through which water must flow to form
the tidal bulge. This variation is why shore areas often publish tables of the local tides.

Tidal Resonances
The sizes of the tides depend on where you are, but high tide is typically a meter or two
above low tide. Because the tidal bulges are located near the equator, tides far to the north or
south are smaller than that; tides in isolated lakes or seas are smaller still because water canât
flow in to create the bulges. However, there are a few special places that have enormous
tides. For example, tides in the Bay of Fundy, an estuary between New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia, can change the water level by as much as 15 m. How can tides ever get this large?
Giant tides result from natural resonances in channels and estuaries. Just as air in an
organ pipe can be made to vibrate strongly by a series of carefully timed pushes from a
pump, water in a channel or estuary can be made to oscillate strongly by a series of carefully

timed pushes from the tides. The water in that channel is another extended object with a
stable equilibrium, so it will oscillate about its equilibrium after being disturbed. Giant
tides occur through resonant energy transfer when the cycle of the tides gradually builds up
the amplitude of a suitable standing wave in a channel.
However, while standing waves in an organ pipe involve the column of air as a whole,
standing waves in a channel involve primarily the waterâs open surface. That water is at
equilibrium when its surface is smooth and horizontal, and it experiences springlike restoring forces whenever its surface is disturbed. For the broad waves weâre considering in this
section, those restoring forces are due to gravity and they are known as gravity waves. For
the miniature waves in a small drinking glass, however, waterâs springy, elastic surface
contributes significantly to the restoring forces. Waves that involve this surface tension are
known as capillary waves.
You can observe standing gravity waves on the surface of a large cup of coffee. As you
walk with the cup in hand and jostle it back and forth rhythmically, youâll produce gravity
waves on the coffeeâs surface. If you time your walking motion so that itâs synchronized
with the natural rhythm of a particular standing wave, youâll build up the amplitude of that
wave by resonant energy transfer and may find yourself needing a change of clothes. Similar gravity-wave resonances occur in washbasins and bathtubs, phenomena that children
find particularly amusingâto the dismay of their parents and the delight of people who
repair water-damaged floors and ceilings.
Like standing waves on violin strings and drumheads, standing surface waves on
water are transverseâthe waterâs vertical surface vibrations are perpendicular to the horizontal waves themselves. In a basin, the fundamental vibrational mode (Fig. 9.3.4) has a
node along the middle of the basin and antinodes at either end. At one antinode, water arcs
up to a crestâa maximum upward displacement from equilibrium. At the other antinodes,
water arcs down to a troughâa maximum downward displacement from equilibrium. Over
time, the crest drops to become a trough, while the trough rises to become a crest. That
process reverses and then repeats, over and over again until the sloshing water turns all its
vibrational energy into thermal energy or transfers it elsewhere.
The giant tides at the end of an estuary are simply the antinode of a standing wave
fluctuating up and down between a crest and a trough. While the standing waves in an
ordinary washbasin have periods measured in seconds or less, large bodies of water can
sustain standing waves known as seiches that have periods of minutes or even hours. These
standing waves appear throughout the oceans and significantly affect the heights and timings of the tides almost everywhere on Earth.
Water in the Bay of Fundy has a fundamental seiche mode with a period of roughly
13.3 hours. Because this period nearly matches the 12.5-hour cycle of the tides, thereâs a
resonant transfer of energy from the moon to the water oscillating in the estuary. The tides
drive water back and forth in this estuary until, after many cycles, that water is moving so
strongly that its height varies dramatically with time (Fig. 9.3.5).

Check Your Understanding #2: Potential Profits
People occasionally propose using giant tides to generate electric power, but thereâs a problem with
this idea. If you extracted all the gravitational potential energy from the water at high tide in the Bay
of Fundy, how long would it take for a giant high tide to appear again?
Answer: It would take many days.
Why: The sloshing water in the Bay of Fundy acquires its energy via resonant energy transfer. The
tides do work on the water, slowly increasing its energy over many cycles of its periodic motion. Since
each cycle takes half a day, many days are required to build up the energy needed for a giant tide. If
you were to extract all this stored energy at once, the bay would have to start sloshing all over again.
A small power plant that extracts only a tiny portion of the stored energy each cycle is possible, however, and one such plant is actually in operation.

Traveling Waves on the Surface of Water
As you sit at the seashore on a cloudless day, enjoying a warm, steady breeze, you canât
help but notice that the sea in front of you is covered with ridges. These ridges move steadily toward land and finally crash on the beach. Though itâs customary to think of each
breaking swell as a separate wave, weâll find it useful to view the entire moving pattern of
evenly spaced ridges as a single waveâa traveling surface wave on water.
Traveling surface waves are the basic modes of oscillation on the open ocean, the
simplest waves on that effectively limitless surface. Despite their steady progress across
the water, these traveling waves actually involve oscillation. You can see this oscillation by
watching a fixed point on the waterâs surface. That point fluctuates up and down as the
crests and troughs of a traveling wave pass through it. The period of this oscillation is
the time required for one full cycle of rise and fall, and the frequency is the number of
crests passing through that fixed point each second.
The oceanâs surface can host an incredible variety of traveling waves, each moving in
its own direction with its own period and frequency. Moreover, these basic waves can coexist, adding together on the oceanâs surface to create ever more complicated patterns. Like
the pure tones of many flutes, which when blended together in proper proportions imitate
the richer timbres of oboes and violins and which when blended still further can produce
any possible pattern of sound, traveling waves can be superposed in proper proportions to
produce any possible surface pattern or wave. When the ocean is rough and its surface
features are ripples layered on swells layered on broad undulations, youâre seeing this
superposition of âpure toneâ traveling waves in all its glory.
In contrast, the basic modes of oscillation on a channel or lake are standing surface
wavesâthe simplest waves on that limited surface. In a standing wave, the waterâs surface
oscillates up and down vertically, with its crests and troughs interchanging periodically:
crests become troughs and troughs become crests. The standing waveâs pattern of crests and
troughs doesnât move anywhere; it simply flips up and down in place at a certain frequency.
On their limited surface, these standing waves can be superposed to produce any possible surface pattern or wave, so they, too, are like primary colors. Overall, traveling waves
constitute the primary palette of waves for a limitless ocean, and standing waves constitute
the primary palette of waves for a limited channel or lake.
STANDING AND TRAVELING WAVES
The most basic waves on an extended object of limited dimensions are standing waves.
With their different periods and/or patterns, these standing waves can be superposed
to form any possible wave on that limited object.
The most basic waves on an extended object of limitless dimensions are traveling
waves. With their different periods and/or directions of travel, these traveling waves
can be superposed to form any possible wave on that limitless object.

CHAPT ER 9 Resonance and Mechanical Waves

Actually, weâve seen these ideas before in the context of musical instruments and
sound. Since instruments are limited objects, their basic vibrations are standing wavesâ
the fundamental and overtone vibrations. And because air is effectively limitless, its basic
vibrations are traveling wavesâthe sound waves it carries. The timbre of an instrument
reveals the superposition of its many standing waves, while the full sound of an orchestra
or band displays the superposition of its many traveling waves.
Both standing and traveling water surface waves carry energyâenergy that they typically obtain from the wind, the tide, and occasionally seismic activity. Each waveâs energy
consists of kinetic energy in moving water and gravitational potential energy in water that
has been displaced from its level equilibrium.
In a standing wave, the energy of the entire wave fluctuates back and forth between
kinetic and gravitational potential; the waveâs kinetic energy peaks as the surface rushes
through its level equilibrium, and its potential energy peaks as the surface stops to turn
around at its maximum displacement from equilibrium.
A traveling waveâs crests and troughs move steadily forward, so the water is never
level or motionless. The energy in a traveling wave is therefore always an even mixture of
kinetic and potential energies. Also, because of its directed motion, a traveling wave carries
momentum pointing in the same direction as the wave velocity.
Check Your Understanding #3: The Frequency of Seasickness
Youâre sitting in a small boat on the open ocean, rising and falling with each passing wave crest. How
could you measure the frequency of the wave passing under your boat?
Answer: Count the number of up and down cycles you complete in a certain amount of time.
Why: Your boatâs up and down motion is caused by the oscillation of the oceanâs surface. You are
rising and falling at the frequency of the passing wave.

The Structure of a Water Wave
Weâve seen that a traveling surface wave moves across the open ocean with a certain velocity, wavelength, and frequency. But what is the water itself doing as the wave passes?
You can begin to answer that question by watching a bottle floating on the waterâs
surface (Fig. 9.3.6). As a wave passes it, that bottle rises and falls with the crests and
troughs, but it makes no overall progress in any direction. Instead, the bottle travels in a
circle. Like the bottle, the water itself doesnât actually move along with the passing wave.
Although this water bunches up to create each crest and spreads out to create each trough,
it returns to its starting point once the wave has left.
Like the bottle in Fig. 9.3.6, a patch of water on the oceanâs surface moves in a circular
pattern (Fig. 9.3.7) as a traveling wave passes. Water that starts out on top of a crest moves
down and forward as the crest departs. It moves down and backward as the trough arrives,
then up and backward as the trough departs, and finally up and forward as the next crest
arrives. When it reaches the top of the arriving crest, this water is back where it started on

the oceanâs surface. Which way the water circles depends on the wave velocityâs directionâthe waveâs direction of travel. The water at the top of a crest always moves in the
same direction as the wave itself.
It isnât only the surface water that moves; water beneath the surface also circles. However, the circles diminish in radius gradually with depth and become negligible at a depth
roughly equal to half the waveâs wavelength. Thus although itâs called a surface wave, it
has a depth to it and therefore a sensitivity to shallow water, as weâll soon see.
âThese surface waves have another interesting characteristicâtheir wave speed
increases with wavelength. As you may have noticed, long-wavelength swells travel faster
than short-wavelength ripples. Thatâs quite different from sound waves, which all have the
same wave speed regardless of wavelength.
Such dependence of wave speed on wavelength is known as dispersion. It occurs in
this case because waterâs surface is surprisingly stiff when carrying long-wavelength
waves. Unlike a taut violin string, which opposes short-wavelength distortions much more
stiffly than long-wavelength ones, waterâs surface uses its weight to oppose long-wavelength
disturbances almost as vigorously as it opposes short-wavelength ones. That heightened
stiffness for long-wavelength waves boosts their frequencies and therefore increases their
wave speeds (see Eq. 9.2.1).
Little ripples have short wavelengths and travel slowly, while large ocean swells have
long wavelengths and travel much more rapidly. Giant waves produced by earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions, known as tsunamis, have extremely long wavelengths and can travel at
hundreds of kilometers per hour. Because these giant waves travel so fast and move water
so deep in the ocean, they carry enormous amounts of energy and momentum and are
potentially disastrous to shore areas (Fig. 9.3.8).
Check Your Understanding #4: Beneath the Waves
If youâre swimming and want to dive beneath a wave, how deep must you go to avoid any significant
motion in the water?
Answer: You must dive about half a wavelength beneath the waterâs surface.
Why: A wave causes motion in the water up to a depth of roughly half its wavelength. A typical wave
has a wavelength of about 5 m, so you must dive 2.5 m under water before the water will remain
essentially still.

Fig. 9.3.9 When a
traveling water surface
wave encounters shallow
water, it slows down and its
direction of travel changes.
This refraction process
bends the wave velocity so
that it points more directly
toward the beach.

As a wave approaches the shore, it begins to travel through shallow water. Since the waterâs
circular motion extends below the surface, there comes a point at which the wave begins to
encounter the seabed. Once the water is shallower than half the wavelength of the wave, the
seabed distorts the waterâs circular motion so that it becomes elliptical.
That change has a number of interesting effects on the wave. First, its wave speed
gradually decreases so that the crests begin to bunch together. Second, its amplitude (the
height of its crests and depth of its troughs) increases as the wave acts to keep its overall
forward momentum constant despite its decrease in speed. These two effects explain why
waves that look broad and gradual on the open ocean look quite steep and dangerous nearer
the beach. Their crests have bunched together and grown taller, so the slopes between crests
and troughs really have become steeper.
A third effect of the shallowing water is a gradual change in the waveâs direction of
travel. Known as refraction, this bending occurs whenever a waveâs speed changes as it
passes from one environment to another. Since a water surface wave slows as it approaches
the shore, that wave refractsâit bendsâso as to head more directly toward the shore (Fig.
9.3.9). Because of refraction, waves approach the beach almost perpendicular to it, even if
they were traveling at relatively oblique angles far from shore.
A fourth and final effect is the destruction of the waveâit eventually runs out of water
and crashes onto the beach. The wave builds each of its crests using local water. When the
crest enters very shallow water, there isnât enough water in front of it to construct its forward side. The crest becomes incomplete and begins to âbreak.â
The form of its demise depends on the slope of the seabed. If that slope is gradual, the
wave breaks slowly to form a smooth, rolling, âboilingâ surf (Fig. 9.3.10). However, if the
slope of the seabed is steep, the wave breaks quickly by having the top of its crest plunge
forward over the trough in front of it (Fig. 9.3.11). The steep slope essentially prevents the
forward half of the crest from forming. The rearward half continues through its normal
circular motion and dives over the missing half-crest in front of it.
The wave can avoid this violent end by colliding with a seawall or cliff instead of a
beach. Rather than breaking, the wave will then bounce off the wall and continue on in a new
direction. Known as reflection, this bouncing effect occurs whenever a wave would have to
change significantly to cross a boundary. In this case, the water actually ends at the rigid
wall, so the wave simply cannot cross that boundary and must reflect instead. The reflecting
wave passes back over itself, and as it does, what had been a traveling wave develops some
standing-wave characterâa consequence of the wallâs limiting the surface of the sea.

Fig. 9.3.11 When the water becomes too shallow to form a complete crest for the wave, the wave
âbreaks.â If the slope of the shore is steep enough, the crest will be quite incomplete on its shore side
and will plunge forward over the trough in front of it.

262

CHAPT ER 9 Resonance and Mechanical Waves

Less severe changes in how a wave travels on opposite sides of a boundary can also
make that wave reflect from the boundary, if only partially. Thus when a water surface wave
passes over a sandbar or coral reef and its wave speed changes, it may experience both
partial reflection and refraction. These effects contribute to the complicated dynamics of
waves near the shore.

Check Your Understanding #5: Out Past the Surf
As you swim away from shore at the ocean, you go through a region where the wave crests are
breaking and then reach a more distant region where they donât break. What distinguishes the two
regions?
Answer: The breaking region is too shallow for complete crests to form. The nonbreaking region is
deep enough to form complete crests.
Why: Wave crests break in shallow regions, where complete crests canât be formed. As long as the
water is deep enough, the waves travel intact. However, if there is a shallow region such as a sandbar,
even quite far from shore, the crests may break as the wave passes through it.

The Rhythm of the Surf: Wave Interference
If the ocean were carrying only one pure traveling wave toward shore, every breaking swell
would look and sound the same. However, there is often a complicated rhythm to the crashing surf; its loudness fluctuates with an overall pattern known as surf beat. Surf beat is a
sign that the oceanâs surface is a busy place; itâs actually carrying more than one traveling
wave at a time, and these various waves all contribute to the surf.
To understand how multiple traveling waves produce surf beat, letâs consider a
simple case. Suppose that two traveling waves are heading toward shore and that they
have equal amplitudes but different wavelengths (Fig. 9.3.12). Such a situation can easily arise when winds over two portions of the ocean produce two different traveling
waves that later overlap. Since they are sharing the oceanâs surface, they are superposed
on one another.
Because these traveling waves are different, their patterns of crests and troughs
canât coincide everywhere. Instead, these waves experience interference, their overlying patterns enhance one another at some locations and cancel one another at other
locations. Wherever the two waves are in phase, that is, whenever their crests or troughs
coincide, they experience constructive interferenceâthe waves act together to produce enormous crests or troughs. Wherever the two waves are out of phase, that is,
whenever the crest of one wave coincides with the trough of the other wave, they experience destructive interferenceâthe waves oppose one another to produce muted or
absent crests or troughs.
The result is an interference pattern, an intricate structure that spreads across space
and time when waves are superposed. This interference pattern on the oceanâs surface
moves and evolves as the traveling waves head toward shore, and it leaves its impression
Destructive interference
Constructive interference
Waves A+B (superposed)

interference pattern A + B. As this moving pattern encounters
the shore, its varying crest heights give rise to surf beat.

on the crests that eventually break on the beach. Since these crests are no longer equal in
height, they exhibit the complicated rhythm of surf beat. When you listen to that beat,
youâre hearing the consequence of superposition and the interference of waves.
Of course, the real ocean carries many traveling waves, each with its own amplitude, wavelength, and direction of travel. But no matter how complicated the oceanâs
surface or how intricate the surface beat, you are still just observing the interference of
waves.

SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT WAVE PHENOMENA
Reflection: The complete or partial mirror redirection of a wave that occurs when certain
dynamical properties of that wave, particularly its speed, change abruptly as it passes
from one environment to another.
Refraction: The bending of a wave that occurs when that waveâs speed changes as it
passes from one environment to another.
Dispersion: The dependence of a waveâs speed on its wavelength.
Interference: The interaction of two or more waves when they are superposed; their
crests and troughs can enhance one another (constructive interference) or cancel
one another (destructive interference) and can produce an interference pattern.

Check Your Understanding #6: Sound Beats
Many notes on a piano are played by two or even three separate strings. If those strings arenât tuned
to exactly the same pitch, the resulting sound has a pulsing characterâit grows louder and softer
rhythmically. What causes this strange pulsation or beat?
Answer: The slightly different sound waves produced by the separate strings are experiencing
interference.
Why: Like slightly different water waves, slightly different sound waves exhibit interference effects.
The resulting pulsation reflects alternating constructive and destructive interference between the
sound waves with slightly different pitches.

Epilogue for Chapter 9
In this chapter, we have looked at natural resonances in a variety of objects. In Clocks, we
examined resonances in pendulums, balance rings, and quartz crystals, and we found that
these objects are harmonic oscillatorsâtheir restoring forces are proportional to displacement. As such, these timekeepers have periods that donât depend on the amplitudes of
their motions.
In Musical Instruments, we explored the vibrations of strings and air columns and
found that they, too, behave as harmonic oscillators, but with many modes of vibration
and thus more complicated behaviors. We found that we could view their motions as
waves.
In The Sea, we further explored two different types of waves: standing waves and
traveling waves. We saw that both types of waves are found in water, with standing waves
appearing in tidal resonances and traveling waves heading out over the open ocean.

Explanation: A Singing Wineglass
Rubbing the lip of the glass is similar to bowing a violin string; both procedures cause
resonant energy transfer. Your finger alternately pushes on the glass and then slips,

263

264

CHAPT ER 9 Resonance and Mechanical Waves

helping the glass itself to vibrate back and forth beneath your finger in its fundamental
vibrational mode. As the glass begins to vibrate, your finger does a little work on it each
time the glass is moving in the same direction as your finger. Once the glass is singing
loudly, you can keep it singing by circling your finger steadily around the glass. Although
the glass continues to emit its energy as sound, you keep giving it more energy by doing
work on it with your finger. Adding more water to the glass increases its inertia and slows
its vibrations.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Clocks Work: Clocks are usually based on harmonic oscillators because of their extremely steady periods. Most important, the period of a harmonic oscillator doesnât depend on
the amplitude of its motion. Common harmonic oscillator timekeepers include pendulums,
balance rings, and quartz crystals.
In a pendulum clock, a swinging pendulum controls the rotation of a toothed wheel,
which in turn controls the rotation of the clockâs hands. Energy needed to keep the pendulum
swinging and to advance the hands comes from the descent of a weighted cord. In a balance
clock, a rocking balance ring controls the toothed wheel. Energy for this clock comes from a
wound coil spring. A quartz crystal clock detects the vibration of its crystal electronically and
uses that vibration to control a motor that advances its clock hands or an electronic circuit
that measures time by counting the crystalâs vibrations. Small, carefully timed electric pulses
from the clock provide the energy that keeps the crystal vibrating.
How Musical Instruments Work: A violin string exhibits natural resonances by vibrating
back and forth about its equilibrium shape, a straight line. Bowing the string causes it to
vibrate by pushing it away from its equilibrium shape and then allowing it to slip back.
The bow transfers energy to the vibrating string by pushing it each time it moves in the
bowâs direction. The stringâs fundamental pitch is determined by its mass, tension, and
length, and the pitch corresponds to a standing wave on the string. After selecting a string
of the correct mass, you tune that string by adjusting its tension. While playing, you
change the stringâs length and pitch by pressing it against the fingerboard. The belly of
the violin serves to convert the stringâs vibration into sound by moving in and out as the
string vibrates.
The air inside an organ pipe also exhibits natural resonances. As the organ blows air
across the opening at the bottom of a pipe, the air inside that pipe begins to vibrate as a
standing wave. The frequency of this vibration is determined principally by the pipeâs length,
so a short pipe has a higher pitch than a long one. Pipes with different shapes produce different amounts of harmonics and yield different sounds.
The surface of a drum has natural resonances but with a difference: theyâre not harmonics of the fundamental pitch. The complicated standing waves on the drumhead contribute to
its unique sound.
How the Sea Works: The sea exhibits two interesting motions: tides and waves. Tides are
caused by bulges in Earthâs oceans, created by gravitational tidal forces from the moon and
sun. The moon dominates the tides so that bulges appear on the regions of Earth closest to
and farthest from the moon. Since Earth is rotating, these bulges move with respect to land
and give the tides their 12Â˝-hour cycle.
Waves occur because the waterâs surface has a stable equilibrium. When itâs disturbed
from that flat, level equilibrium, this surface will oscillate. Its most basic oscillations are
standing waves on confined bodies of water and traveling waves on open water.
The familiar ripples on the oceanâs surface are traveling waves that head toward shore
at speeds that increase with wavelength. As they approach the shore, these waves form

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations

incomplete crests, which eventually break. The shallowing water also slows the waves, so
that they bend more directly toward shore. Interference effects among multiple traveling
waves give rise to intricate patterns on the waterâs surface and to complicated rhythms in
the crashing surf.

Electricity
hile itâs hard to see the electric charges that are responsible for electricity, itâs easy to see
their effects. Theyâre all around us, in the sparks and shocks of a cold winter day, the
imaging process of a xerographic copier, and the illumination of a flashlight when you turn
on its switch. Although we often take electricity for granted, it clearly underlies many aspects of
our modern world.
Just imagine what life would be like if there were no electric charges and no electricity. For starters,
weâd probably be sitting around campfires at night, trying to think of things to do without television, cell
phones, or computer games. But before you remark on just how peaceful such a pre-electronic-age
existence would be, let me add one more sobering thought: we wouldnât exist either. Whether itâs motionless as static charge or moving as electric current, electricity really does make the world go âround.

Chapter Itinerary
Although we often experience electric forces and currents as
novelties or nuisances, there are also many devices that depend
on them. In this chapter, we examine the mysteries of (1) static
electricity and study two modern devices based on electricity:
(2) xerographic copiers and (3) flashlights. In Static Electricity,
we look at how clothes and other objects acquire charges and
how they exert forces on one another as a result. In Xerographic
Copiers, we see how these same electric forces work together
with light to control the placement of black powder to reproduce
images on sheets of paper. In Flashlights, we look at how a

lightbulb. For a more complete preview of the chapter, turn

This chapter concentrates on electricity and its charges,
but as we will see in Chapter 11, electricity is closely related to
magnetism and its poles. While weâll leave the relationships
between electricity and magnetism for that next chapter, you
may already begin seeing similarities between those two seemingly separate phenomena as you read Chapter 10.

things around, however, as youâve probably noticed while
reaching for a doorknob or a friendâs hand on a cold, dry day. In
this section, weâll examine static electricity and the physics
behind its intriguing forces and often painful shocks.
Questions to Think About: How does a dryer produce static
electricity, and why do some clothes cling while others repel
each other? Why does walking across a carpet on a cold, dry
day put you at great risk of a shock as you reach for a doorknob? Why do you get only a single brief shock from that knob
and not a long sustained one? When you touch a friend and get
a shock, did one of you cause that shock or are you both
responsible? If rubbing is required to develop static electricity,
why does the plastic wrap produce so much of it when you
open a package? Why do moist air and antistatic chemicals
reduce static electricity?

Electricity may be difficult to see, but you can easily observe
its effects. How often have you found socks clinging to a shirt
as you remove them from a hot dryer or struggled to throw away
a piece of plastic packaging that just wonât leave your hand or
stay in the trash can? The forces behind these familiar effects
are electric in nature and stem from what we commonly call
static electricity. Static electricity does more than just push

Experiments to Do: You can study static electricity by rubbing
a toy balloon vigorously through your hair or against a wool
sweater. Though its appearance wonât change, the balloon will
begin to attract other things, particularly your hair. What has
happened to the balloon? to your hair? Why does the balloon
also attract things that werenât rubbed?
Try to get rid of the balloonâs attractiveness by letting a thick
stream of water flow over its surface. Why does this process return
the balloon to normal? What did you âwashâ off the balloon? Now
rub two identical balloons through your hair and see whether they
attract or repel one another. Does the result make sense?
Finally, draw two long strips of transparent tape from a
dispenser without rubbing them on anything, and see if they
attract or repel. Is rubbing essential to the development of
static electricity?

Unless you have always lived in a damp climate and avoided synthetic materials, you have
experienced the effects of static electricity. Seemingly ordinary objects have pushed or
pulled on one another mysteriously, and youâve received shocks while reaching for light
switches, car doors, or friendsâ hands. Static electricity is more than an interesting nuisance, though; itâs a simple window into the inner workings of our universe and worthy of
a serious look. It will take some time to lay the groundwork, but soon youâll be able to
explain most of the effects of static electricity and even to control it to some extent.
The existence of static electricity has been known for several thousand years. About
600 bc, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus (ca. 624â546 bc) observed that when
amber is rubbed vigorously with fur, it attracts light objects such as straw and feathers.
,
Known in Greek as elektron (Îˇ'ÎťÎľÎşĎĎÎżĎ), amber is a fossil tree resin with properties similar
to those of modern plastics. The term static electricity, like many others in this chapter,
derives from that Greek root.
Static electricity begins with electric charge, an intrinsic property of matter. Electric
charge is present in many of the subatomic particles from which matter is constructed,
and these particles incorporate their charges into nearly everything. No one knows why
charge exists; itâs simply one of the basic features of our universe and something that people discovered through observation and experiment. Because electric charge has so much
influence on the objects that contain it, we sometimes refer to those objects as electric
charges, or simply as charges.
Charges exert forces on one another, and these forces are what you observe with static
electricity. Next time youâre doing laundry, experiment with your clothes as they come out
of the dryer. Youâll find that some electrically charged garments attract one another, while
others repel each other. Evidently, there are two different types of charge. Although this
dichotomy has been known since 1733, when it was discovered by French chemist CharlesFranĂ§ois de Cisternay du Fay (1698â1739), it was Benjamin Franklin 1 who finally gave
the two charges their present names. Franklin called what appears on glass when itâs rubbed
with silk âpositive chargeâ and what appears on hard rubber when itâs rubbed with animal
fur ânegative charge.â
Two like charges (both positive or both negative) push apart, each experiencing a
repulsive force that pushes it directly away from the other (Figs. 10.1.1a, b). Two opposite
charges (one positive and one negative) pull together, each experiencing an attractive force
that pulls it directly toward the other (Fig. 10.1.1c). These forces between stationary electric charges are called electrostatic forces.
When you find that two freshly laundered socks push apart, itâs because they both have
the same type of charge. Whether that charge is positive or negative depends on the fabrics
involved (more on that later), so letâs just suppose that the dryer has given each sock a
negative charge. Since like charges repel, the socks push apart. What does it mean for the
dryer to give each sock a negative charge?
The answer to that question has several parts. First, the dryer didnât create the negative
charge that it gave to a sock. Like momentum, angular momentum, and energy, electric
charge is a conserved physical quantityâit cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. The negative charge that the dryer gave to the sock must have come from something
else, perhaps a shirt.
Second, positive charge and negative charge arenât actually separate entitiesâtheyâre
just positive and negative amounts of the same physical quantity: electric charge. Positive
charges have positive amounts of electric charge, while negative charges have negative
amounts. Like most physical quantities, we measure charge in standard units. The SI unit
of electric charge is the coulomb (abbreviated C). Small objects rarely have a whole coulomb of charge, and your sockâs charge is only about â0.0000001 C.
Third, the sockâs negative charge refers to the sock as a whole, not to its internal
pieces. As with all ordinary matter, the sock contains an enormous number of positively

Static Electricity

269

and negatively charged particles. Each of the sockâs atoms consists of a dense central core
or nucleus, containing positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by
a diffuse cloud of negatively charged electrons. The electrostatic forces between those tiny
charged particles hold together not only the atoms but also the entire sock. However, in
giving the sock a negative charge, the dryer saw to it that the sockâs net electric charge, the
sum of all its positive and negative amounts of charge, is negative. With its negative net
charge, the sock behaves much like a simple, negatively charged object.
Last, the sock became negatively charged when it contained more electrons than protons. Underlying that seemingly simple statement is a great deal of painstaking scientific
study. To begin with, experiments have shown that electric charge is quantized, that is,
charge always appears in integer multiples of the elementary unit of electric charge. This
elementary unit of charge is extremely small, only about 1.6 Ă 10â19 C, and is the magnitude of the charge found on most subatomic particles. An electron has a â1 elementary unit
of charge, while a proton has a +1 elementary unit of charge. Since the only charged subatomic particles in normal matter are electrons and protons, the sock becomes negatively
charged simply by having more electrons than protons.
Returning to the original question, we now know what the dryer did that gave a sock a
negative charge. Assuming the sock was electrically neutral to startâit had zero net chargeâ
the dryer must have added electrons to the sock or removed protons from the sock or both.
These transfers of charge upset the sockâs charge balance and gave it a negative net charge.
In keeping with our convention regarding conserved quantities, all unsigned references
to charge in this book imply a positive amount. For example, if the dryer gave charge to a
jacket, we mean it gave a positive amount of charge to that jacket. We follow this same
convention with money: when you say that you gave money to a charity, we assume that
you gave a positive amount.
Finally, Franklinâs charge-naming scheme was brilliant in concept but unlucky in execution. Although it reduced the calculation of net charge to a simple addition problem, it
required Franklin to choose which type of charge to call âpositiveâ and which to call ânegative.â Unfortunately, his seemingly arbitrary choice made electrons, the primary constituents of electric current in wires, negatively charged. By the time physicists had recognized
the mistake, it was too late to fix. Scientists and engineers have had to deal with negative
amounts of charge flowing through wires ever since. Imagine the awkwardness of having
to carry out business using currency printed only in negative denominations!
Check Your Understanding #1: In Charge of Opening Gifts
The gift you are about to unwrap is electrically neutral. You tear off the clingy wrapper and find that
it has a large negative charge. What charge does the gift itself have, if any?
Answer:

It has a large positive charge equal in amount to the wrapperâs negative charge.

Why: Since charge is a conserved physical quantity, the wrapper and gift must remain neutral
overall even after you separate them. The wrapperâs negative charge must be balanced by the giftâs
positive charge.

Coulombâs Law and Static Cling
Although your sock and shirt pull together strongly when theyâre only inches apart, you can
put on your shirt and go to the movies without fear of being attacked by your sock from the
other side of town. Evidently, the forces between charges weaken with distance.
Over two centuries ago, French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb 2 studied
electrostatic forces experimentally and determined that the forces between two electric
charges are inversely proportional to the square of their separation (Fig. 10.1.2). For example, doubling the separation between your shirt and sock reduces their attraction by a factor
of four, which explains your uneventful night out on the town.

2 In 1781, after a career
as a military engineer in
the West Indies, French
physicist Charles-Augustin
de Coulomb (1736â1806)
returned to his native Paris
in poor health. There he
conducted scientific
investigations into the
nature of the forces
between electric charges
and published a series of
memoirs on the subject
between 1785 and 1789.
His research came to a
close in 1789 when he
was forced to leave Paris
because of the French
Revolution.

Coulombâs experiments also showed that the forces between electric charges are proportional to the amount of each charge. That means that doubling the charge on either your shirt
or your sock doubles the force each garment exerts on the other. Finally, changing the sign of
either charge turns attractive forces into repulsive ones or vice versa. If both garments were
either positively charged or negatively charged, theyâd repel instead of attracting.
These ideas can be combined to describe the forces acting on two charges and can be
written as a word equation:

and in everyday language:
When there are enough like charges packed close together on your hair,
itâll stand up.
The force on charge1 is directed toward or away from charge2, and the force on charge2 is
directed toward or away from charge1.
This relationship is called Coulombâs law, after its discoverer. The Coulomb constant
is about 8.988 Ă 109 N â m2/C2 and is one of the physical constants found in nature. Consistent with Newtonâs third law, the force that charge1 exerts on charge2 is equal in amount
but oppositely directed from the force that charge2 exerts on charge1.

COULOMBâS LAW
The magnitudes of the electrostatic forces between two objects are equal to the Coulomb constant times the product of their two electric charges divided by the square of
the distance separating them. If the charges are like, then the forces are repulsive. If
the charges are opposite, then the forces are attractive.

In addition to protecting you from distant charged socks, this relationship between
electrostatic forces and distance gives rise to another intriguing feature of laundry static:
charged clothes can cling to objects that are electrically neutral! For example, a negatively
charged sock can stick to a neutral wall.
The origin of this attraction is a subtle rearrangement of charges within the wall. Even
though the wall has zero net charge, it still contains both positively and negatively charged
particles. When the negatively charged sock is near the wall, it pulls the wallâs positive
charges a little closer and pushes the wallâs negative charges a little farther away (Fig.
10.1.3). Although each individual charge shifts just a tiny distance, the wall contains so
many charges that together they produce a dramatic result. The wall develops an electric
polarizationâit remains neutral overall but has a positively charged region nearest the
sock and a negatively charged one farthest from the sock.
The wallâs positive region attracts the sock, while its negative region repels the sock.
Although you might expect those two opposing forces to balance, Coulombâs law says
otherwise. Since electrostatic forces grow weaker with distance, the sock is attracted more
strongly to the nearer positive region than it is repelled by the more distant negative region.
Overall, there is a net electrostatic attraction between the charged sock and the polarized
wall, so the sock clings to the wall!

Check Your Understanding #2: Wrapper Recycling
After opening your gift, you try to throw away its negatively charged wrapper. However, the wrapper
keeps returning to your hand. What attracts it to your electrically neutral hand?
Answer:
charge.

Its negative charge polarizes your hand and is then attracted to your handâs nearby positive

Why: Although your hand is neutral, its charges rearrange in response to the nearby wrapperâs negative charge. Positive charge in your hand shifts toward the wrapper and attracts it.

Check Your Figures #1: Moving Out
You have two positively charged balls, each of which is experiencing a force of 1 N away from the
other. If you halve the distance separating the balls, what force will each exert on the other?
Answer:

4 N.

Why: According to Coulombâs law, the force on each charge varies inversely with the square of their
separation. By halving that separation, you increase the electrostatic force by a factor of 4.

Transferring Charge: Sliding Friction or Contact?
While itâs clear that the dryer transfers charge between the clothes, why does that charge
move and what determines which garments gain charge and which lose it?
You might suppose that sliding friction is responsible for the transferâthat the dryer
rubs the clothes together and somehow wipes charge from one garment to the other. After
all, friction seems to help you charge a balloon as you rub it through your hair or against a
wool sweater. However, be carefulâthere are other cases of charge transfer that donât
involve rubbing at all. For example, the plastic wrap you remove from a store package can
acquire a charge no matter how careful you are not to rub it against its contents. And an
antique car can build up enough charge to give you a nasty shock even when its pale rubber
tires never skid across the pavement.
Charge transfer is less the result of rubbing than it is of contact between dissimilar surfaces. When two different materials touch one another, a few electrons normally shift from
one surface to the other. That transfer results from the chemical differences between the two
touching surfaces and the associated change in an electronâs potential energy when it shifts.
In effect, some surfaces are âhungrierâ for electrons than others, and whenever two dissimilar surfaces touch, the hungrier surface steals a few electrons from its âless hungryâ partner.
The physics behind this theft has to do with chemical potential energy, energy stored
in the chemical forces that bind together a materialâs constituent atoms and electrons. To
hold onto its electrons, a surface reduces their chemical energies to less than zero, meaning
that it would take additional energy to free those electrons from the surface. However, some
surfaces reduce the electron chemical potential energies more than others and thus bind
their electrons more tightly. If an electron on one surface can reduce its chemical potential
energy by shifting to the other surface, it will accelerate toward that âhungrierâ surface and
eventually stick there. You can picture the electron as ârolling downhillâ from a chemical
âvalleyâ on one surface to an even deeper valley on the other surface.

271

272

CHAPT ER 10 Electricity

This transfer of electrons is self-limiting. As electrons accumulate on the lower
energy surface, they begin to repel any electrons that try to follow and the transfer process
soon grinds to a halt. It stops altogether when the electrons reach equilibriumâwhen the
forward chemical force an electron experiences is exactly balanced by the backward electrostatic force. The transfer wonât resume until you bring fresh uncharged surface regions
into contact.
Thatâs where rubbing enters the picture. Rubbing involves lots of surface contact and
almost endless opportunities for charge transfer between those surfaces. As clothes tumble
about in the dryer, touching one another and often rubbing, some fabrics steal electrons and
become negatively charged, while other fabrics lose electrons and become positively charged.
That said, you should be aware that the details of contact charging are messy. For
starters, the surfaces that actually touch one another are neither chemically pure nor free of
microscopic defects. Although itâs generally true that whichever fabric binds electrons
most tightly is the one most likely to develop a negative net charge, surface contamination
and defects can change the outcome radically. Even your choice of laundry detergent may
affect the fabricâs surface chemistry and thus how it charges. Furthermore, water molecules
cling to most surfaces and influence the contact charging process. Finally, while weâve
concentrated on the exchange of electrons, itâs also possible for certain surfaces to exchange
ions, that is, electrically charged atoms, molecules, or small particles, along with electrons
and acquire net charges as a result.
Check Your Understanding #3: Sticky Tape
When you peel a piece of adhesive tape off a glass window, you find that the tape is attracted toward
the spot it left behind. How did the tape and glass acquire electric charges?
Answer: While the tape and glass were in contact, charge was unevenly distributed between their
surfaces. Removing the tape merely made that imbalance more obvious.
Why: The tape and glass have different chemical affinities for electrons and become oppositely
charged whenever they touch. In fact, the tapeâs stickiness itself comes from electrostatic attraction.

Separating Your Clothes: Producing High Voltages
The dryer stops, and you take out your favorite shirt. It has several socks clinging to it,
so you begin to remove them. As you separate the garments, they crackle and spark.
Their attraction is obviously due to opposite charges, but why does separating them make
them spark?
To answer that question, letâs think about energy as you pull the negatively charged
sock steadily away from the positively charged shirt. Since the sock would accelerate
toward the shirt if you let go, you are clearly exerting a force on the sock. And because that
force and the sockâs movement are in the same direction, you are also doing work on the
sock. You are transferring energy to it.
That energy is stored in the electrostatic forces; the shirt and sock accumulate electrostatic potential energy. Electrostatic potential energy is present whenever opposite charges
have been pulled apart or like charges have been pushed together. With the negatively
charged sock now far from the positively charged shirt, both attraction and repulsion contribute to the electrostatic potential energyâopposite charges are separated on the two
garments, and like charges are assembled together on each garment.
The total electrostatic potential energy in the shirt and sock is the work you did to
separate them. However, that potential energy isnât divided equally among the individual
charges on these garments. Depending on their locations, some charges have more electrostatic potential energy than others and are therefore more important when it comes to
sparks. In recognition of those differences, we need a proper way to characterize the electrostatic potential energy available to a charge at a particular location. The measure weâre

Static Electricity

seeking is voltage, the electrostatic potential energy available per unit of electric charge at
a given location, or
voltage =

electrostatic potential energy
.
charge

Voltage is a difficult quantity to conceptualize because you canât see charge or sense
its stored energy. To help you understand voltage, letâs use a simple analogy. In this analogy, the role of charge will be played by water and the role of voltage will be played by
pressure. Where voltage is high, visualize water at high pressure. Where voltage is low,
picture water at low pressure. Just as water tends to flow from a higher pressure to a lower
pressure, so charge tends to flow from a higher voltage to a lower voltage.
This analogy works well because both voltage and pressure measure the energy per unit
of something. Voltage is the electrostatic potential energy per unit of charge and pressure is the
pressure potential energy per unit of volume (see Section 5.2). Both water at high pressure and
charge at high voltage are loaded with energy per unit and likely to do something exciting!
Since the SI unit of energy is the joule and the SI unit of electric charge is the coulomb,
the SI unit of voltage is the joule per coulomb, more commonly called the volt (abbreviated
V). Where the voltage is positive, (positive) charge can release electrostatic potential
energy by escaping to a distant neutral place, where the voltage is zero. Charge at positive
voltage is analogous to pressurized water, which can release pressure potential energy by
flowing into the open air. Where the voltage is negative, charge needs energy to escape to a
distant neutral place, where the voltage is zero. Charge at negative voltage is analogous to
water at less than atmospheric pressure, which needs energy to flow out into the open air.
In addition to the voltage â pressure analogy, we can also draw a voltage â altitude
one. In this second analogy, charges at high voltage are like bicyclists at high altitude. Just
as charges tend to flow from a higher voltage to a lower voltage, so bicyclists tend to roll
from a higher altitude to a lower altitude. In this analogy, altitude plays the role of voltage
and gravitational potential energy plays the role of electrostatic potential energy. The bicyclists release gravitational potential energy as they roll downhill from a mountain, and they
need energy to climb uphill from a valley.
Returning to those clothes, youâll find that each point on the shirt or sock has its own
voltage. You can determine that voltage by taking a tiny amount of positive charge at that
point and moving it to a distant neutral place, where the voltage is zero. The pointâs voltage
is simply the electrostatic potential energy the charge releases during that trip divided by
the amount of its charge. If the point you examine is on the positively charged shirt, youâll
measure a large positive voltageâprobably several thousand volts. If itâs on the negatively
charged sock, pulling positive charge away from that point will require considerable work,
so youâll measure a large negative voltageâprobably negative several thousand volts.
Whether positive or negative, these large or âhighâ voltages tend to cause sparks.
Weâll look at the physics of sparks and discharges soon, but you can already see why
oppositely charged clothes spark as you separate them: thatâs when the high voltages
develop. As long as your sock is clinging tightly to your shirt, there isnât much electrostatic
potential energy available. But as soon as you begin to separate them, watch out!
Check Your Understanding #4: High-Altitude Voltage
Although any cloud may contain opposite charges, only the violent updrafts inside thunderheads are
able to separate those charges and produce lightning. Why does such separation lead to lightning?
Answer: That separation takes work, which appears as electrostatic potential energy in the separated charges. The positively charged regions of the thunderhead acquire huge positive voltages, and
the negatively charged regions acquire huge negative voltages.
Why: When opposite charges are near each other, they donât necessarily have much electrostatic
potential energy per charge and the voltages may be small. Separating those charges to great distances dramatically increases their stored energy and produces high voltages.

electricity can be produced
by mechanical processes.
In this Van de Graaff
generator, a moving rubber
belt transfers negative
charges from the base to
the shiny metal sphere.
This negative charge
creates dramatic sparks as
it returns through the air
toward the positive charge
it left behind.

Weâve seen that touching two different materials together causes a small transfer of charge
from one surface to the other and that separating those oppositely charged surfaces produces elevated voltages and perhaps sparks. However, the quiet crackling and snapping of
items in your laundry basket is nothing compared to the miniature lightning bolts you can
unleash after walking across a carpet on a dry winter day, stepping out of an antique car, or
playing with a static generator. To get a really big spark, you need to separate lots of charge,
and that usually requires repeated effort.
Walking across a carpet is just such a repetitive process. Each time your rubber-soled
shoe lands on an acrylic carpet, some (positive) charge shifts from the carpet to your shoe.
Although the transfer is brief and self-limiting, you now have a little extra charge on your
shoe. When you lift that shoe off the carpet, you do work on its newfound charge and your
shoeâs voltage surges to a high positive value. High-voltage charge tends to leak from one
place to another, and the shoeâs charge quickly spreads to the rest of your body. By the time
your foot lands again on a fresh patch of carpet, the shoe has given away most of its charge
and is ready to begin the process all over again.
Each time your foot lands on the carpet, it picks up some charge. Each time it lifts off
the carpet, that charge spreads out on your body. By the time you finally reach for the doorknob, you are covered with charge and have an enormous positive voltage. As your hand
draws close to the doorknob, it begins to influence the doorknobâs chargesâpulling the
doorknobâs negative charges closer and pushing its positive charges away. You are polarizing the doorknob.
As we saw while separating your freshly laundered sock from your shirt, oppositely
charged objects that are close but not touching can have both large electrostatic potential
energies and strong electrostatic forces. Thatâs the situation here. The closer your hand
gets to the doorknob, the stronger the electrostatic forces become until finally the air itself
cannot tolerate the forces and a spark forms. In an instant, most of your accumulated electrostatic potential energy is released as light, heat, and sound. And that doesnât include
any screams.
As good as walking is at building up charge, though, an antique car is even better. Its
pale rubber tires gather negative charge when they touch the pavement and develop large
negative voltages as they roll away from it. This charge migrates onto the car body so that,
after a few seconds of driving, the car accumulates enough charge to give anyone who
touches it a painful shock. Collecting tolls used to be hazardous work! Fortunately, modern
tires are formulated to allow this negative charge to return safely to the pavement, so now
cars rarely accumulate much charge. Instead, most shocks associated with cars now come
from sliding across the seat as you step in or out.
While cars try to avoid static charging, some machines deliberately accumulate separated charge to produce extraordinarily high voltages. The most famous of these static
machines is the Van de Graaff generator (Fig. 10.1.4). It uses a rubber belt to lift positive or
negative charges onto a metal sphere until the magnitude of that sphereâs voltage reaches
hundreds of thousands or even millions of volts.
A typical classroom Van de Graaff generator uses a motor-driven rubber belt to carry
negative charges from its base to its spherical metal top. Once inside the sphere, the beltâs
negative charges flow outward onto the sphereâs surface, where they can be as far apart as
possible. There they remain until something releases them.
Suspended at the top of a tall, insulating column, the Van de Graaff generatorâs
sphere can accumulate an enormous negative charge. You may hear the motor struggling
as it pushes the beltâs negative charges up to the sphere, a reflection of how much negative voltage the sphere is developing. Eventually it releases its negative charge via an
immense spark.
Even without sparks, the Van de Graaff generator is an interesting novelty. If you isolate yourself from the ground and touch the metal sphere while itâs accumulating negative

Static Electricity

charges, some of those negative charges will spread onto you as well. If your hair is long
and flexible, and permits the negative charges to distribute themselves along its length, it
may stand up, lifted by the fierce repulsions between those like charges.
Check Your Understanding #5: Stop the Presses!
The paper in some printing presses moves through the rollers at half a kilometer per minute. If no
care is taken, dangerous amounts of static charge can accumulate on parts of the press. How does
the moving paper contribute to that charging process?
Answer: Contact between dissimilar materials puts charge on the paper, which then carries that
charge with it to isolated parts of the press. Enough charge can accumulate on those parts to be
dangerous.
Why: Nonconductive paper is an excellent transporter of electric charge. Once the paper picks
up a static charge by touching a dissimilar material, it can carry that charge with it as it moves
through the press. Not surprisingly, printing presses use various tools to suppress this static
charging.

Controlling Static Electricity: Fabric Softeners
and Conditioners
Now that weâve seen what static electricity is and how to produce it, weâre ready to see how
to tame it. Static cling, flyaway hair, and electrifying handshakes arenât everyoneâs cup of
tea. The basic solution to static charge is mobility; if charges can move freely, theyâll eliminate static electricity all by themselves. Opposite charges attract, so any separated positive
and negative charges will join up as soon as theyâre allowed to move.
Materials such as metals that permit free charge movement are called electrical conductors. Those such as plastic, hair, and rubber that prevent free charge movement are
called electrical insulators. Since charge movement eliminates static electricity, our troubles with static electricity stem mostly from insulators. If you wore metal clothing, you
wouldnât have static problems with your laundry.
The simplest way to reduce static electricity is to turn the insulators into conductors.
Even slight conductors, ones that just barely let charges move, will gradually get rid of any
accumulations of separated charge. Thatâs one of the main goals of fabric softeners, dryer
sheets, and hair conditioners. They all turn insulating materialsâfabrics and hairâinto
slight electrical conductors. The result is the near disappearance of static electricity and all
its fashion inconveniences.
How these three items work is an interesting tale. They all employ roughly the same
chemical: a positively charged detergent molecule. A detergent molecule is a long molecule
that is electrically charged at one end and electrically neutral at the other end. Its charged
end clings electrostatically to opposite charges and is chemically âat homeâ in water. Its
neutral end is oil-like, slippery, and âat homeâ in oils and greases. This dual citizenship is
what makes detergents so good for cleaning.
While it might seem that positively and negatively charged detergent molecules would
clean equally well, thatâs not the case. Since cleaning agents shouldnât cling to the materials theyâre cleaning, itâs important that the two not have opposite charges. Fabrics and hair
generally become negatively charged when wetâanother example of a charge shift when
two different materials touchâso negatively charged detergent molecules clean much better than positively charged ones.
Positively charged detergents are still useful, however, although you mustnât apply
them until after youâve cleaned your clothes or hair. Because they cling so well to wet
fibers, these slippery detergent molecules will remain in place long after washing and give
fabrics and hair a soft, silky feel. Theyâll also allow those materials to conduct electricity,
albeit poorly, so as to virtually eliminate static electricity!

275

276

CHAPT ER 10 Electricity

This conductivity is due principally to their tendency to attract moisture. Water is
a slight electrical conductor and damp surfaces allow charges to move around. Thatâs
why moist air decreases static electricity. By making fabrics and hair almost imperceptibly damp, the positively charged detergents allow separated charges to get back
together and do away with static hair problems and laundry cling. Thatâs why theyâre
the main ingredients in fabric softeners, dryer sheets, hair conditioners, and even many
antistatic sprays.

Check Your Understanding #6: No Lightning at Work
The conveyor belts used to move flammable materials often have metal threads woven into their
fabric. Why are such conducting belts important for fire safety?
Answer: An insulating conveyor belt can separate enormous amounts of charge, leading to high
voltages, sparks, and possibly fire. A conductive belt canât carry charge with it as it moves, so no
charge accumulates.
Why: When an insulating belt has charge on its surface, that charge must move with the belt. However, charges are mobile in a conductive belt and donât normally move with it.

The days of carbon paper and mimeograph machines are long
gone. What modern office could operate without a xerographic
copier? Advertisements for copiers are everywhere, and
although each manufacturer claims to make the best copiers,
thatâs mostly just salesmanship. In reality, all xerographic copiers are based on the same principles, discovered in 1938 by
Chester Carlson. In this section, weâll examine xerographic
copiers and the ideas that make them possible.

Experiments to Do: To get a feel for how a copier works, cut a
small sheet of paper into tiny squares, about 1 mm on a side.
Put the squares on a table and suspend a thin plate of clear
plastic above them, a few millimeters away. The top of a clear
plastic box will do. Now run a plastic comb through your hair
or against a sweater several times and touch it to the top of the
plastic plate. Squares of paper will leap off the table and stick
to the plastic plate. Whatâs holding the squares against the
plastic? If the paper were black, how could you form letters on
the surface of the plastic?

Xerography: Using Light to Print Copies
The image that a xerographic copier prints on a sheet of paper begins as a pattern of tiny
black particles or toner on a smooth, light-sensitive surface. The copier uses static electricity and light reflected from the original document to arrange this toner on the surface
and then carefully transfers the toner to the paper (Fig. 10.2.1). Invented in 1938 by
Chester Carlson 3 , this process is basically our old friend static electricity doing something useful.
At the heart of the xerographic copier is a thin, light-sensitive surface made from a
photoconductor, a normally insulating material that becomes a conductor while exposed
to light. Although the darkened photoconductor can keep positive and negative charges
apart, these charges quickly draw together when light hits the photoconductor (Fig. 10.2.2).

Fig. 10.2.1 This xerographic copying machine uses a photoconductor belt to form black-and-white
images of an original document. The copying process begins with the precharger, which coats the
photoconductor with charge. The optical system then forms a real image on a flat region of the
photoconductor belt, producing a charge image. After the charge image picks up toner particles, the
first charge erase lamp eliminates the charge image and weakens the tonerâs attachment to the belt.
The toner is then transferred and fused to the paper.

That flexibility allows light from the original document to determine the pattern of static
electricity on the photoconducting surface and consequently the placement of toner on the
piece of paper.
Each copying cycle begins in the dark with the copier spraying negative charges onto
its photoconductor. On the other side of the photoconductor is a grounded metal surfaceâ
grounded in the sense that itâs electrically connected to Earth so that charges are free to
flow between the two. As negative charges land on the open surface of the photoconductor,
they attract positive charges onto the metal surface beneath it. When the charge-spraying
process is complete, the open surface of the photoconductor is uniformly coated with negative charges while the underlying metal surface is uniformly coated with positive charges
(Fig. 10.2.3a).
After this precharging, the copier uses a lens to cast a sharp image of the original
document onto the photoconducting surface. Weâll examine lenses and the formation of
images when we study cameras in Chapter 14. For now, what matters is that light hits the
photoconductor only in certain places, corresponding to the white parts of the original
document.
There are two standard techniques for exposing the photoconductor to light. Some
copiers illuminate the whole original document with the brilliant light of a flash lamp and
cast a complete image onto a flattened portion of a photoconductor belt. In other copiers,
a moving lamp or mirror illuminates the original a little at a time and the image is cast as
a moving stripe on a rotating photoconductor drum. Either way, charges move through any
regions of the photoconductor that are exposed to light, leaving these regions electrically
neutral (Fig. 10.2.3b). The result is a charge image, a pattern of electric charge on the
photoconductorâs surface that exactly matches the pattern of ink on the original document
(Fig. 10.2.3c).

3 Impoverished as a
youth, American inventor
Chester F. Carlson
(1906â1968) supported
his family by washing
windows and cleaning
offices after school. His
work in a print shop as a
teenager started him
thinking about copying
and he began to experiment with electrophotography. After attending
Caltech (the California
Institute of Technology),
he worked for Bell
Laboratories but was laid
off during the Depression.
While attending law
school, he continued his
experiments and invented
the xerographic copying
process in 1937â1938.
Development of commercial copiers was slow, and
it wasnât until 1960 that
the Haloid Xerox
Corporation produced its
first successful copier,
Model 914. Carlson
became extremely wealthy
but gave most of his
money away anonymously.

Fig. 10.2.3 The
photoconductor is first
coated (a) with a uniform
layer of negative charge.
Exposure to light (b) erases
some charge to form a
charge image (c). The
charge image attracts (d)
positively charged toner
particles (e). The charge
image is erased (f) to
release the toner particles
(g). The toner is transferred
to the negatively charged
paper (h) and fused to the
paper with heat (i).

To develop this charge image into a visible one, the xerographic copier exposes
the photoconductor to positively charged toner particles (Fig. 10.2.3d). This toner is a
fine, insulating plastic powder containing a colored pigment, usually black. Applying
toner to the photoconductor must be done gently, and itâs often accomplished with
the help of Teflon-coated iron balls. These tiny balls are held together in long filaments
by a rotating magnetic shaft, so that the shaft resembles a spinning brush with extraordinarily soft bristles. These bristles wipe toner particles out of their storage tray
and onto the photoconductor. Contact with the Teflon leaves the toner particles positively charged, so they stick to the negatively charged portions of the photoconductor
(Fig. 10.2.3e).
The photoconductor now carries a black image of the original document, an image that
the copier must transfer to the paper. Before attempting that transfer, the copier first weakens the photoconductorâs grip on the toner by exposing it to light from a charge erase lamp.
This light eliminates the photoconductorâs charge (Fig. 10.2.3f) and leaves the positively
charged toner particles clinging only loosely to its surface (Fig. 10.2.3g).
The copier then transfers the toner image to a blank sheet of paper by pressing that
paper lightly against the photoconductor while spraying negative charge onto the paperâs
back (Fig. 10.2.3h). The positively charged toner is attracted to the negatively charged
paper, and the two leave the photoconductor together. The copier then heats and presses the
copy, permanently fusing the toner onto the paper (Fig. 10.2.3i). Once the image has been
transferred to the paper, the copier cleans its photoconducting surface in preparation for the
next copy; a second charge erase lamp eliminates any remaining charge, and a brush or
squeegee mops up any residual toner.
With that introduction to xerography, you can already explain many things about copiers. For example, while fixing a copier jam, you may find that you have removed unfinished
copiesâones bearing toner images that havenât yet been fused onto the paper. The toner of
an unfused copy comes off on your hand because itâs held in place only by electrostatic
forces. When you replace the toner cartridge in a personal copier, in addition to adding new
toner, youâre also installing a new precharge system, photoconductor drum, and toner
applicator (Fig. 10.2.4).
However, weâve glossed over three important physics issues. Two weâll leave for later
chapters: why a photoconductor becomes conducting when exposed to light (Chapter 13,
Light), and how a lens projects an image of the document onto the photoconductor (Chapter 14, Optics and Electronics). The third issue is relevant now, and so weâll examine it
carefullyâhow the copier sprays charges onto surfaces.

Check Your Understanding #1: Sticky Copies
When the copies emerge from a xerographic copier, they tend to stick to things and attract lint. What
causes this effect?
Answer: The charge that was placed on the paper to attract the toner isnât always removed completely. Moreover, the toner itself is charged.
Why: The final transfer process, lifting the toner particles from the photoconductor to the paper, is
done by charging the paper, and some of this charge remains on the paper when it leaves the copier.
Copier transparencies are particularly clingy because plastic retains charge so well.

Discharges and Electric Fields
At the start of the copy cycle, the xerographic copier coats its photoconducting surface
uniformly with electric charges. Because this precharging process is done in the dark,
while the surface is an electrical insulator, the charges must be sprayed onto it like paint.
The copierâs charge sprayer is a corona discharge, a gentle sustained spark that forms in
the air near a needle or fine wire thatâs kept at high voltage.

Xerographic Copiers

Itâs a type of discharge, a flow of electric charge through a gas. Air is normally an
insulator because its atoms and molecules are neutral and canât convey charge from one
place to another. However, by seeding air liberally with individual charged particles, the
copier manages to turn that air into a conductor and then to produce a discharge in it.
How does the copier seed the air with charges and produce its discharge? And how does
it use that discharge to coat its photoconducting surface? To answer those questions, we
need to know more about electrostatic forces and voltages, and about a related concept,
electric fields.
Because free charges are hard to come by in the air, the copier begins with just a few
charged particles and uses them to generate more. The idea is simple: the copier uses electrostatic forces to accelerate those initial charges to enormous speeds and lets them smash
into airâs neutral particles. When hit hard enough, a neutral air particle breaks into oppositely charged fragments and thus adds two more free charges to the air. These new charges
join the mix, accelerating, colliding, and breaking up still more air particles. A cascade of
collisions ensues, and the air âbreaks down,â transforming from an insulator to a conductor.
The copier then uses this conducting air to spray the photoconductor with charges.
Where do those initial charges come from? Surprisingly, theyâre already there, the
products of cosmic rays and natural radioactivity! Every cubic centimeter of ordinary air
contains almost 2000 charged particles, roughly half positive and half negative. Considering that this same volume of air contains almost 3 Ă 1019 neutral particles, thatâs not many
charges. But itâs enough to get the discharge started.
To parlay those initial charges into the vast numbers it needs, the copier must accelerate them aggressively. The neutral air particles are so densely packed that itâs difficult for
the charged ones to pick up much speed before they hit something and slow down. To give
each initial charge a good shot at breaking the first neutral particle it hits, the copier must
accelerate that charge very quickly.
The copier accelerates its charges using strong electrostatic forces. Up until now,
weâve associated electrostatic forces with pairs of charges, each charge pushing or pulling
on the other. As long as there are only a handful of charges in a given situation, the individual electrostatic forces on a particular charge can be added together to obtain the overall
electrostatic force on that charge. However, in the copierâs wires and discharge, there are so
many individual charges that adding up their forces is virtually impossible. We need some
other way to characterize the overall electrostatic force on a particular charge.
Instead of thinking about the many interactions between one particular charge and all the
other charges around it, we can view the electrostatic force on our charge as the result of its
one interaction with something local: an electric field, an attribute of space that exerts an
electrostatic force on a charge. The surrounding charges create the electric field and that electric field pushes on our charge. The electrostatic force on our charge depends on the chargeâs
location in space and time, so the value of the electric field also depends on space and time.
The electric field is an example of a field, a structure that associates a physical quantity
with each point in space and time. The term field suggests another structure that extends
across space and timeâa field of growing wheat. Since the length of the wheat stalks
depends on where and when you look, stalk length is a field. Moreover, in windy weather,
the direction of those wheat stalks also depends on where and when you look, so the stalks
are actually vectors and form a vector field, a structure that associates a vector quantity
with each point in space and time. The electric field is also a vector field; at each point, its
magnitude is the amount of electrostatic force it exerts per unit of electric charge and its
direction is the direction in which it pushes a positive charge.
Figure 10.2.5a illustrates the electric field of a motionless positive charge. Each white
dot represents a point in space and time, and the red arrow passing through that dot represents the electric field at that point. The direction of the arrow indicates the direction of
the field, and its volume is proportional to the fieldâs magnitude. Also shown are the fieldâs
effects on two test charges, idealized positive charges that have no electric fields of their
own and thus no influence on their surroundings.

Electrostatic force
Test charge

Test charges donât really exist, but theyâre useful conceptual tools for examining electric fields. In the present case, the central positive chargeâs electric field pushes each test
charge away from the positive charge with an electrostatic force that is inversely proportional to the distance from the positive charge. When the central charge is negative (Fig.
10.2.5b), its electric field is reversed and that field pushes each test charge toward the
central charge.
From this new perspective, the electrostatic force on a charge is exerted by the electric
field itself, not by the source of the electric field. That electrostatic force is equal to the
charge times the electric field at the chargeâs position. We can write this relationship as a
word equation:
electrostatic force = charge Âˇ electric field,

(10.2.1)

in symbols:
F = qE,
and in everyday language:
Charged lint accelerates quickly in a region full of static electricity,
where the electrostatic force is in the direction of the electric field. Note that a particle
carrying a negative amount of charge (an electron) experiences a force opposite the electric
field. The SI unit of electric field is the newton per coulomb (abbreviated N/C).
At present, the electric field may seem like an unnecessary fiction. In later sections,
however, weâll see that the electric field is much more than just a new way of thinking about
the forces between charges. Thatâs because the electric field truly exists in space, independent of the charges that produce it. In fact, electric fields are often created by things other
than charges and can influence things other than charges as well.
The copier employs a very strong electric field to âbreak downâ the air so that it can
operate its discharge. That field accelerates charges so rapidly that collision cascades
occur and fill the air with free charges. Unfortunately, you canât sense electric fields
directly, so itâs hard to visualize a strong one. Weâll work on that problem, but for now just
remember that strong electric fields can initiate discharges in air. Thatâs how thunderstorms produce lightning!

Check Your Understanding #2: Medical Electrons
A medical linear accelerator uses a strong electric field to accelerate electrons forward and give them
enormous kinetic energies. These high-energy electrons enter the patient and kill cancer cells. In
which direction does the acceleratorâs electric field point?
Answer:

It points backward, away from the patient.

Why: Since electrons are negatively charged, they accelerate in the direction opposite to the field.
Since the accelerator must push the electrons forward, toward the patient, its field must point away
from the patient.

Check Your Figures #1: Lint Floats
A piece of charged lint refuses to fall because an electric field is exactly supporting its weight. If the
lint weighs 10â8 N and has a positive charge of 10â11 C, what electric field is supporting it?
Answer:

The lint is supported by an electric field of 1000 N/C in the upward direction.

Why: The electric field is equal to the force it exerts divided by the charge, or 10â8 N divided by
10â11 C. It must point upward to support the positively charged lint against the downward pull of
gravity.

Conductors and Voltage Gradients
A copierâs precharging system uses the gentle corona discharge that develops in the strong
electric field just outside a fine high-voltage wire. This discharge ferries charges to the
photoconductor surface and coats it uniformly. To understand why a strong electric field
exists outside a fine high-voltage wire and why the discharge it produces is âgentle,â we
need some background. Letâs start by looking at electric fields inside and outside electrical
conductors.
Consider the simplest conducting objectâa solid metal ball. If you release some identical positive charges inside that ball (Fig. 10.2.6a), what happens to them? Because they
repel one another, those charges accelerate outward and move apart. In fact, theyâd leave
the ball altogether if they werenât chemically bound to its metal. After spending a moment
or two ridding themselves of extra electrostatic potential energy, principally as thermal
energy, the charges settle down in stable equilibria on the ballâs surface (Fig. 10.2.6b). At
its equilibrium point, the outward electrostatic force that each charge experiences from its
fellow charges is perfectly balanced by the inward chemical force it experiences from the
metal. The net force on it is zero.
At equilibrium, each charge has also minimized its total potential energy. After all, it
canât stop accelerating until there is no direction in which it can move to lower its potential
energy further. Whatâs amazing about how the charges arrange themselves on the ballâs
surface is that each one ends up with the same total potential energy. Thatâs because if one
of them had less total potential energy than the rest, the other charges would accelerate
toward it to lower their total potential energies as well!
Since the only potential energy that significantly affects charges in our small homogeneous ball is electrostatic potential energy, every charge in our ball has essentially the same
electrostatic potential energy. Because voltage is the electrostatic potential energy per unit
of charge, equal potential energies on equal charges means equal voltagesâthe entire ball
has a single, uniform voltage! In our voltage â altitude analogy, this observation is analogous to the fact that, at equilibrium, the water level in a swimming pool has a single uniform altitude.
Because of the ballâs perfect symmetry, charges in equilibrium are spread evenly on its
surface. Had we chosen a less symmetric conducting object, such as the copierâs fine metal
wire, charges in equilibrium would not be spread so evenly. Nonetheless, those charges
would still be on the outside of the object, and it would still have a single uniform voltage.

VOLTAGE AND CHARGE ON A CONDUCTING OBJECT
With its charges at equilibrium, a homogeneous conducting object has a single uniform
voltage and the net charge anywhere in its interior is zero.

Given a conducting objectâs charges in equilibrium on its surface, we can make one
more remarkable observation: the electric field inside that object is zero! To see why, letâs
place a test charge inside the object. Putting a real charge inside the object would upset the
equilibrium, and that charge would be pushed toward the surface. A test charge, however,
has no electric field of its own and doesnât influence its surrounding; it leaves the other
charges in equilibrium and merely responds to the existing electric field. Because the voltage is uniform throughout the object, the test chargeâs electrostatic potential energy doesnât
depend on its position and it therefore canât reduce its electrostatic potential energy by
moving. It doesnât accelerate, so it must be experiencing zero electrostatic force and zero
electric field.

ELECTRIC FIELD IN A CONDUCTING OBJECT
With its charges at equilibrium, a homogeneous conducting object has zero electric
field in its interior.

Although the voltage is uniform in and on the copierâs fine conducting wire, it varies
rapidly with position outside that wire (Fig. 10.2.6b). Accompanying this large spatial variation in voltage is a strong electric field, officially called a voltage gradient. You can think
of a spatial variation in voltage as a âslopeâ in the voltage. In our voltage â altitude analogy, a voltage gradient is analogous to an altitude gradient, the slope of an ordinary hill.

Xerographic Copiers

Just as water accelerates swiftly down a steep slope toward a lower altitude, so (positive)
charge accelerates swiftly down a large voltage gradient toward a lower voltage. Both are
examples of the accelerations toward lower potential energy that we first examined in
Chapter 2. In our voltage â pressure analogy, a voltage gradient is analogous to a pressure
gradient and charge accelerates toward lower voltage in the same way that water accelerates toward lower pressure.
Since both electric fields and voltage gradients cause charges to accelerate, it shouldnât
surprise you to learn that a voltage gradient is an electric field. Although weâll uncover a
second source of electric fields in the next chapter, weâll treat a voltage gradient and an
electric field as equivalent for now. Their relationship can be written as a word equation:
electric field = voltage gradient =

voltage drop
,
distance

(10.2.2)

in symbols:
E = Gradient(V),
and in everyday language:
Charges rush down steep drops in voltage, much as bicycles rush down steep
drops in hill height,
where the electric field points in the direction of the most rapid voltage decrease.
This relationship gives us a second way to look at an electric field. In addition to being
the electrostatic force exerted per unit of charge, electric field is also the voltage drop
per unit of distance. The SI unit of electric field therefore has a second form: the volt per
meter (abbreviated V/m). The volt per meter is exactly the same unit as the newton per
coulomb. As an example of an electric field produced by a voltage drop, consider the top of
a normal 9-V battery. With its two terminals separated by just 0.005 m and a voltage drop
of 9 V between them, the space between those terminals contains an electric field of about
1800 V/m, pointing toward the negative terminal.
Check Your Understanding #3: Donât Get Out of a Hot Car!
During a thunderstorm, a lightning strike places a huge static charge on your car. Why donât you
notice this charge as long as you remain inside the car?
Answer: The accumulated charge is all on the outside of the conducting car, so it will affect you
only if you step outside and offer it a conducting path to the ground.
Why: Since the car body is an electrical conductor and its charges are in equilibrium, the car has a
uniform voltage and there is no electric field inside the car. Outside the car, however, there is a substantial electric field. If your body provides a conducting path to the ground, that electric field will
push charges through you and you will experience a shock. Similarly, if electric power lines ever fall
on your car, stay inside the car to avoid a potentially lethal shock.

Check Your Figures #2: Riding the Field
An electric field pushes charged particles through the tube of a fluorescent lamp, allowing it to produce light. To operate properly, a typical fluorescent tube needs an electric field of about 100 V/m.
If the average voltage difference between the two ends of a tube is 120 V, how long can that fluorescent tube be?
Answer:

It can be about 1.2 m (4 ft).

Why: With a voltage difference of 120 V between its ends and a length of 1.2 m, the tubeâs electric
field will be 120 V divided by 1.2 m, or about 100 V/m. This result explains why so many fluorescent
lamps in the United States are about 1.2 m (4 ft) long.

Fig. 10.2.7 These
two metal spheres are
1 cm apart. When their
difference in voltage is
about 30,000 V, the air
between them breaks down
and forms a spark.

Fine Wires and High Voltages: Corona Discharges
Ordinary air breaks down in an electric field of about 3 Ă 106 V/m, or, in customary units,
about 30,000 V per centimeter. At that field, free charges accelerate so rapidly that a cascade of charge-freeing collisions suddenly transforms air from a nearly perfect insulator
into a reasonably good conductor.
You can produce such a strong field all by yourself. On a dry winter day, you can coat
yourself with positive charges and raise your voltage to about 30,000 V simply by scuffing
your rubber-soled shoes across an acrylic carpet. As you then approach a grounded doorknob at 0 V, the voltage difference between the doorknob and your hand will be 30,000 V.
When your hand is about 1 cm from the doorknob, the electric field will reach 30,000 V per
centimeter and the air will break down with a brilliant spark (Fig. 10.2.7).
Because your hand and the doorknob are similar in size and shape, the voltage
changes smoothly between them (Fig. 10.2.8a). It varies steadily from 0 V on the doorknob to 30,000 V on your hand, so the voltage gradient or electric field is nearly uniform.
When two objects differ significantly in size, however, the larger object dominates voltages in the space between them. For example, if you hold a long pin in your hand as you
approach the doorknob, the doorknob will control the voltage most of the way to the pin
and nearly all the increase in voltage will occur just outside the pinâs point (Fig. 10.2.8b).
Rather than being uniform, the voltage gradient or electric field will be strongest near
that point.

The copier makes good use of this nonuniform field. Its fine high-voltage wire is nearly
surrounded by a much larger metal shroud. The wire is so thin that its influence fades just
a hairâs breadth from its surface and the grounded shroud dominates voltage almost all the
way to the wire. Although the wireâs negative voltage is only â3000 V and itâs about 1 cm
from the shroud, the voltage changes so rapidly in the air just outside this wire that the
electric field there easily exceeds 30,000 V/cm and breaks down the air.
The discharge that forms near the fine wire is a special, self-regulating oneâa corona
discharge (Fig. 10.2.9). While most discharges canât control how many free charges they
produce, a corona discharge automatically maintains a steady production. Because free
charges form only in the strong electric field near its thin conductor, their production rate
is very sensitive to changes in that conductorâs effective thickness. If there are too many
free charges in the air near the conductor, their ability to conduct electricity effectively
thickens the conductor, weakens the electric field, and slows the production of free charges.
The discharge is correcting its own mistake.
Because of this stabilizing effect, the air in a corona discharge maintains a steady electrical conductivity thatâs ideal for charging a copierâs photoconductor. However, corona
discharges were common long before copiers. They often occur spontaneously near sharp
points or fine wires at high voltages, leading to charge leakage from power transmission
lines and occasionally producing a glow called St. Elmoâs fire on the masts and rigging of
sailing ships (see 4 ).

Check Your Understanding #4: A Safety Pin
You can avoid the shock of static electricity by holding out a sharp needle as you reach for a metal
doorknob or wall. How does that needle protect you from static electricity?
Answer:

The needle emits charge into the air via a corona discharge.

Why: The needle acts as your personal lightning rod. When you are carrying a net electric charge,
some of that charge settles onto the needle. The strong electric field near the needleâs tip initiates a
corona discharge, and much of your accumulated charge leaves through it. This discharge limits your
net electric charge and thus the size of any shock you experience.

Getting Ready to Copy: Charging by Induction
A corona discharge does more than just turn air into a conductor; it also produces an
outward spray of electric charges. Those charges are pushed outward by the electric
field surrounding the corona wire. Since the copierâs corona wire has a negative voltage, the surrounding electric field points toward that wire. Because negative charges
accelerate opposite an electric field, the copierâs corona produces a shower of outgoing
negative charges. They spray onto the photoconducting surface as it moves steadily
past the corona, and the photoconductor thus acquires a uniform coating of negative
charges.
As each negative charge lands, it draws a positive charge onto the grounded metal
surface beneath the photoconductor and the attraction between those two opposite charges
holds them firmly in place. While the photoconductorâs open surface is acquiring its uniform negative charge, the metal layer underneath is acquiring an equivalent positive charge
(Fig. 10.2.3a). This process, whereby a grounded conductor acquires a charge through the
attraction of nearby opposite charge, is called âcharging by induction.â
The induced positive charge on the metal side of the photoconductor is important to
the xerographic process for several reasons. First, it lowers the electrostatic potential energy
of the negative charge so that the surfaceâs negative voltage isnât as enormous. Second,
without that positive layer nearby, repulsion between like charges would tend to push negative charges on the open surface toward the edges of the photoconductor and distort the
resulting images.

4 Contrary to popular
belief, lightning rods
donât simply attract
lightning strikes so as to
protect the surrounding
roof. Instead, they
produce corona discharges
that diminish any local
buildups of electric
charge. By neutralizing
the local electric charge,
the lightning rod reduces

Most significantly, however, the positive charge layer gives the negative charge layer
somewhere to go when the photoconductor is exposed to light! Wherever light from the
original document turns a patch of the photoconductor into a conductor, the negative and
positive charge layers rush together and cancel. The resulting uncharged portion of the photoconductor subsequently attracts no toner and produces a white patch on the finished copy.
Having come full circle, we can now see how the copier achieves its goal. It uses a
corona discharge to coat a photoconducting surface with negative charge and then selectively erases portions of that charge layer with light from the original document. The
remaining charged patches on the photoconductor attract positively charged black toner,
which is then transferred permanently to the paper.
Itâs worth mentioning that, for technical reasons, some copiers precoat their photoconductors with positive rather than negative charges and then use that charge to attract negatively charged toner. These copiers put high positive voltages on their fine wires so that
their coronas spray positive charges.
Check Your Understanding #5: Hot Rod
A thick wire connects the lightning rod on the courthouse steeple to the ground and normally ensures
that the rod is electrically neutral. However, when a negatively charged cloud floats overhead, what
charge does that rod acquire?
Answer:

The rod becomes positively charged.

Why: The lightning rod charges by inductionâthe cloudâs negative charge attracts positive charge
up the wire and onto the rod. The rodâs sharp point initiates a corona discharge, spraying positive
charge toward the cloud and gradually decreasing the cloudâs charge. In that fashion, the lightning
rod acts to suppress lightning strikes.

When itâs in the dark, the copierâs photoconductor system is an example of a capacitor, a
device that stores separated positive and negative charge. Capacitors are common in modern technology, and most consist of two oppositely charged surfaces separated by a thin
insulating layer. To make adding or removing charge easy, those surfaces are usually made
of metals or other electrical conductors (Fig. 10.2.10). The copierâs capacitor, however, has
only one metal surface on its insulating photoconductor layer; the other surface is open and
nonconducting (Fig. 10.2.3a). The copier uses its corona discharge to put charge on that
open surface, and it uses light to remove that charge.
The two conducting surfaces of an ordinary capacitor are often called plates. When one
plate is positively charged and the other is negatively charged, the attraction of opposite charges
on those plates offsets the repulsion of like charges on each plate. The plates thus manage to
store large quantities of separated charge while leaving the overall capacitor electrically neutral.
You can âchargeâ a capacitorâs plates by transferring (positive) charge from its negative plate to its positive one. Since each charge you move experiences an electrostatic force
in the opposite direction, you must do work on that charge as you push it from the negative
plate to the positive plate. Your work is stored in the capacitor as electrostatic potential
energy, and that stored energy is released when you let the separated charge get back
together. Since (positive) charge has more electrostatic energy on the positive plate than on
the negative plate, the voltage of the positive plate is higher than the voltage of the negative
plate. The voltage difference between plates is proportional to the separated charge on
them; the more separated charge the capacitor is holding, the larger the voltage difference.
This voltage difference also depends on the physical structure of the capacitor. Increasing the surface area of each plate decreases the repulsion of its like charges. Thinning the
insulating layer between the plates increases the attraction of their opposite charges. Both
changes lower the separated chargeâs electrostatic potential energy and, consequently, the

Flashlights

voltage difference between the plates. The bigger and closer the plates, the less energy it
takes to store separated charge on them.
Changes that allow the capacitor to store separated charge more easily increase its
capacitance, the amount of separated charge the capacitor holds divided by the voltage
difference between its plates. The SI unit of capacitance is the coulomb per volt, also called
the farad (abbreviated F). A capacitor with a farad of capacitance stores an incredible
amount of separated charge, even at a low voltage difference, but a capacitor with a billionth of a farad of capacitance is much more typical. A capacitorâs capacitance is marked
on its wrapper, often in an abbreviated form. A Greek letter Îź appearing in front of the F
means millionths of a farad (ÎźF, or microfarads), a letter n appearing in front of the F means
billionths of a farad (nF, or nanofarads), and a letter p appearing in front of the F means
trillionths of a farad (pF or picofarads).
Check Your Understanding #6: Recycling Charges
As you recycle old computer parts, you come across a capacitor and wonder if it has separated charge
in it. How can you tell?
Answer:

If it has separated charge, it will have a voltage difference between its two plates.

Why: If the capacitor contains no separated charge, its two plates will have the same voltage. In
other words, the energy per charge on the two plates will be equal. If the plates store separated
charge, however, their voltages will be different. The plate containing extra positive charge will have
more energy per charge and thus a greater voltage than the plate containing extra negative charge.

There isnât much to a typical flashlight; you can see the few
parts it has when you open it to replace its batteries. A flashlight isnât a mechanical device, though; itâs electrical. It contains an electric circuit, and most of its components are
involved in the flow of electricity. To understand how a flashlight works, we need to understand how an electric circuit
works and how electricity carries power from batteries to a
lightbulb or LED. As weâll see, flashlights arenât as simple as
they appear.

Questions to Think About: Why are some flashlights brighter
than others? Why is it important that all the batteries point in
the same direction? What is the difference between old batteries and new ones? What makes a flashlight suddenly become
dim or bright when you shake it?
Experiments to Do: Find a flashlight that uses two or more removable batteries. Turn it on. What did the switch do to make the
flashlight produce light? With the flashlight turned on, slowly open
the battery compartment. The lamp will probably become dark.
You should be able to turn the flashlight on and off by opening and
closing the battery compartment. Why does this method work?
Replace the flashlightâs batteries with older or newer ones
and compare its brightness. Turn one or more of the batteries
around backward, and see how that change affects the flashlight. What happens when you put a piece of paper or tape
between two of the batteries? What happens when you carefully clean the metal surfaces of each battery with a pencil
eraser before putting the batteries in the flashlight? Does it
matter whether the flashlight uses a bulb or an LED?

Electricity and the Flashlightâs Electric Circuit
A basic, old-fashioned flashlight has just three componentsâa battery, a lightbulb, and a
switchâconnected together by metal strips. When the switch is on, the strips transfer
energy from the batteries to the bulb. How does energy move through the strips, and why
does the switch start or stop that energy transfer? To answer these questions, we must first
understand electricity and electric circuits, so thatâs where weâll begin.

When you turn on a flashlight, electricity conveys energy from the batteries to the bulb.
An electric current, a current of electric charges, flows through these components, carrying the energy with it. Weâll examine the exact nature of this current soon; for now, you can
picture it as a steady stream of tiny positive charges following a circular route that takes
them through the batteries, through the bulb, and then back to the batteries for another trip
(Fig. 10.3.1). As long as the flashlight is on, charges flow around this loop, receiving energy
from the batteries and delivering it to the bulb, over and over again. On route, the charges
carry this energy mostly as electrostatic potential energy.
The looping path taken by charges in a flashlight is called an electric circuit.
Because a circuit has no beginning or end, charges canât accumulate in one place, where
their mutual repulsion would eventually stop them from flowing. Circuits are present in
virtually all electric devices, and they explain the need for at least two wires in the
power cord of any home appliance: one wire carries charges to the appliance to deliver
energy, and the other wire carries those charges back to the power company to receive
some more.
But what role does the switch play in all this? As part of one conducting path
between the batteries and bulb, the switch can make or break the flashlightâs circuit
(Fig. 10.3.2). When the flashlight is on, the switch completes the loop so that charges
can flow continuously around the closed circuit (Fig. 10.3.2a). A closed circuit appears
in Fig. 10.3.3a.
However, when you turn off the flashlight, the switch breaks the loop to form an open
circuit (Fig. 10.3.2b). Although one conducting path still connects the batteries and bulb,
the loop now has a gap in it and can no longer carry a continuous current. Instead, charges
accumulate at the gap and current stops flowing through the flashlight. Since energy can no
longer reach the bulb, it goes dark. An open circuit appears in Fig. 10.3.3b.
Thereâs one other type of circuit worth mentioning. A short circuit forms when the
two separate paths connecting the batteries to the bulb accidentally touch one another
(Fig. 10.3.4). This unintended contact creates a new, shorter loop around which the charges
can flow. Because the bulb is expected to extract energy from the charges, itâs designed to
impede their flow and to convert their electrostatic potential energy into thermal energy and
light. This opposition to the flow of electricity is called electrical resistance. Since the
shortened loop offers little resistance, most of the charges flow through it, bypassing the
bulb. The bulb dims or goes out altogether.
Since the bulb is the only part of the flashlight thatâs designed to consume electric
energy, a short circuit leaves the charges without a safe place to get rid of their electrostatic
potential energy. They deposit it dangerously in the batteries and the metal paths, making
them hot. Since short circuits can start fires, flashlights and other electric equipment are
designed to avoid them.

Fig. 10.3.4 When an
unwanted conducting path
allows current to bypass
the flashlightâs filament,
it forms a short circuit.
Because it has no proper
place for electrons to
deposit their energy, the
short circuit becomes hot.

the battery to the lightbulb. When the switch is off (b), no current flows through the open circuit.

Flashlights

Many modern flashlights use one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in place of
the old-fashioned bulb. However, an LED is more complicated than a bulb, and operating several LEDs at once complicates the flashlightâs electric circuit. For simplicity,
weâll start with a single bulb in our flashlight and replace it with one or more LEDs later
in this section.
Check Your Understanding #1: Cutting the Power
If you remove just one of the wires from an automobileâs battery, the vehicle will not start at all. Why
doesnât the other wire supply any energy?
Answer: Removing a single wire from the battery breaks the circuit and prevents a steady flow of
electric current through the carâs electric system.
Why: Neither the battery nor the rest of the car can accumulate charges indefinitely. Without one
wire to carry charges from the battery to the car and a second wire to return those charges from the
car to the battery, accumulation will occur and charge movement will stop.

The Electric Current in the Flashlight
Each of the tiny charged particles flowing through the flashlightâs circuit carries with it just
a single elementary unit of electric charge and a miniscule amount of electrostatic potential
energy. However, because those charges flow in astonishing numbers, they convey a considerable amount of energy per secondâthe quantity we know as power (see Section 2.2)
and measure in watts (abbreviated W). The bulb needs a certain amount of power to keep
its filament glowing brightly, and you can determine how much power is reaching the bulb
by multiplying the number of elementary charges passing through the bulb each second by
the amount of energy each one delivers.
There are too many elementary charges to count, though. Youâll do much better to measure the circuitâs current, that is, the amount of charge passing a particular point in the circuit
per unit of time. The SI unit of current is the coulomb per second, more commonly called the
ampere (abbreviated A). One ampere corresponds to 1 C of charge passing by the designated
point each second. One coulomb is roughly 6.25 Ă 1018, or 6,250,000,000,000,000,000, elementary charges, so even a 1-A current involves a tremendous flow of elementary charges.
Using electric current instead of counting charges, you can determine how much
power is reaching the bulb by multiplying that current by its electrostatic energy per coulombâthe quantity we already know as voltage. For example, a current of 2 A (2 C/s) at a
voltage of 3 V (3 J/C) will bring 6 W of power (6 J/s) to the bulb. Brighter flashlights
involve larger currents, greater voltages, or both.
Current has a direction, pointing along the route of positive charge flow. When you
turn on the flashlight in Fig. 10.3.1, charge flows around the circuit clockwise, from the
battery chainâs positive terminal, through the bulbâs filament, through the switch, and
into the battery chainâs negative terminal. However, now itâs time to address an awkward issue: the positive charges that flow clockwise around this circuit are fictitious. In
reality, the electric current is carried by negatively charged electrons heading in the
opposite direction!
As mentioned before, this issue dates back to Franklinâs unfortunate choice of which
charge to call positive and which to call negative. By the time scientists discovered the
electron and realized that these negatively charged particles carry currents in wires, current
had already been defined as pointing in the direction of positive charge flow. Since it was
far too late to make current and electron flow point in the same direction, scientists and
engineers simply pretend that current is carried by fictitious positive charges heading in the
currentâs direction.
This fiction actually works extremely well, as illustrated by a simple example. When
negatively charged electrons flow to the right through a neutral piece of wire, the wireâs

right end becomes negatively charged and its left end becomes positively charged (Fig.
10.3.5a). But exactly the same thing would happen if a current of fictitious positively
charged particles were to flow to the left through that same piece of wire (Fig. 10.3.5b).
Without sophisticated equipment, you canât tell whether negative charges are flowing to the
right or positive charges are flowing to the left because the end results are essentially indistinguishable.
We, too, adopt this fiction and pretend that current is the flow of positively charged
particles. In this and subsequent chapters, weâll stop thinking about electrons and imagine
that electricity is carried by positive charges moving in the direction of the current. There
are only a few special cases in which the electrons themselves are important, and weâll
consider those situations separately when they arise.

Check Your Understanding #2: Donât Touch That Pipe
A walk across wool carpeting in rubber-soled shoes has left you covered with negative charges. If you
bring your hand near a large piece of metal, the negative charges will leap through the air as a spark
to reach the metal. Which way is current flowing in this spark?
Answer:

The current flows from the metal toward your hand.

Why: Because current is defined as the flow of positive charges, it points in the direction opposite
the flow of negative charges. Thus, the current flows from the metal toward your hand. These charges
move only briefly because there is no circuit. For the charges to move continuously, they would have
to be recycled and a circuit would be essential.

Batteries
While a battery is basically a portable source of electric power, here are two other interesting ways to think of it. The first is rather abstract: a battery is a type of pump. It âpumpsâ
charge from low voltage to high voltage, much as a water pump pumps water from a low
altitude to a high altitude or as a second water pump pumps water from low pressure to high
pressure. Once again, our voltage â altitude and voltage â pressure analogies are helpful.
Each pump moves something against its natural direction of flow, pushing it forward and
doing work on it in the process. The battery increases a chargeâs electrostatic potential
energy by pushing it up a voltage gradient. The first water pump increases waterâs gravitational potential energy by pushing it up an altitude gradient. The second water pump
increases waterâs pressure potential energy by pushing it up a pressure gradient.
The second perspective on batteries is more mechanical: a battery is a chemically
powered machine. It uses chemical forces to transfer charges from its negative terminal to
its positive terminal. As positive charges accumulate on the batteryâs positive terminal, the
voltage there rises, and as negative charges accumulate on the batteryâs negative terminal,
the voltage there drops. Since the battery does work transferring charges from low voltage
to high voltage, it is converting its chemical potential energy into electrostatic potential
energy in these separated charges.
A batteryâs rated voltage reflects its chemistry, specifically the amount of chemical
potential energy it has available for each charge transfer. As the voltage difference between
its terminals increases, so does the energy required for each charge transfer. Eventually, the
chemicals canât do enough work on a charge to pull it away from the negative terminal and
push it onto the positive terminal, so the transfers stop. The battery is then in equilibriumâ
the electrostatic forces opposing the next charge transfer exactly balance the chemical
forces promoting it. A typical alkaline battery reaches this equilibrium when the voltage of
its positive terminal is 1.5 V above the voltage of its negative terminal. Lithium batteries,
with their more energetic chemistries, can achieve voltage differences of 3 V or more.
When you turn on the flashlight, you upset its equilibrium by allowing charges to leave
the batteryâs positive terminal for its negative terminal. With fewer separated charges now

A lead-acid automobile battery provides 12 V between its negative terminal and its positive terminal.
It actually contains six individual batteries, connected in a chain. How much voltage does each individual battery provide?
Answer:

Each individual battery provides 2 V.

Why: The voltages of the individual batteries add, so it takes six 2-V batteries to yield a 12-V chain.
If one of the batteries becomes weak, through damage, loss of fluid, or consumption of its chemical
potential energy, the voltage of the chain will drop below 12 V. Pushing current backward through a
lead-acid battery recharges it.

on its terminals, the batteryâs voltage difference decreases slightly and it begins pumping
charges again. That renewed charge transport replenishes the terminalsâ separated charges
and opposes any further decrease in the batteryâs voltage. In this manner, a 1.5-V alkaline
battery maintains a nearly steady voltage difference of 1.5 V between its terminals, whether
its flashlight is on or off.
That alkaline battery is powered by an electrochemical reaction in which powdered
zinc at its negative terminal reacts with manganese dioxide paste at its positive terminal.
This reaction resembles controlled combustion. In effect, the battery âburnsâ zinc to obtain
the energy it needs to pump charges from its negative terminal to its positive terminal.
However, as the battery consumes its chemical potential energy, its ability to pump charges
diminishes. When its chemicals are nearly exhausted, the batteryâs increasing disorder
reduces its voltage. An aging battery can pump less current than a fresh one, and it provides
that current with less voltage. Ultimately, less power reaches the flashlightâs bulb and it
goes dim.
Most flashlights use more than one battery. When two alkaline batteries are connected
together in a chain, so that the positive terminal of one battery touches the negative terminal
of the other, the two batteries work together to pump charges from the chainâs negative
terminal to its positive terminal (Fig. 10.3.6). Each battery pumps charges until its positive
terminal is 1.5 V above its negative terminal, so the chainâs positive terminal is 3.0 V above
its negative terminal. Because charges never leave the flashlightâs circuit, only relative
voltages matter in that circuit. Weâll find it convenient to ignore the flashlightâs absolute
voltages and define the voltage of the battery chainâs negative terminal to be 0 V (Fig.
10.3.6). With that choice, the voltage of its positive terminal becomes 3.0 V.
The more batteries in the flashlightâs chain, the more energy a charge receives overall
and the more the voltage will increase from the chainâs negative terminal to its positive
terminal. A flashlight that uses six alkaline batteries in its chain has a positive terminal that
is 9 V above its negative terminal. A typical 9-V battery actually contains a chain of six
miniature 1.5-V batteries, arranged so that their voltages add up to 9 V (Fig. 10.3.7).
If you reverse one of the batteries in a chain, the reversed battery will extract energy
from any charge passing through it (Fig. 10.3.8). While the chain may still pump charge
from its negative terminal to its positive terminal, its overall voltage will be reduced
because, instead of adding 1.5 V to the chainâs overall voltage, the reversed battery will
subtract that amount. If the chain has three batteries, two will add energy to the charge
while the third will subtract it, and the chainâs overall voltage will be only 1.5 V.
As the reversed battery extracts energy from the charges passing through it, at least
some of that extracted energy is converted into chemical potential energy. The reversed
battery is recharging! Battery chargers follow that concept, pushing current backward
through a batteryâfrom its positive terminal to its negative terminalâto restore the chemical potential energy in a rechargeable battery. However, normal alkaline batteries are
ânonrechargeable,â meaning that they turn most of the recharging currentâs energy into
thermal energy instead of chemical potential energy. Nonrechargeable batteries may overheat and explode during recharging.

Bulbs and Metal Strips
Whereas a battery gives charges electrostatic potential energy by pushing them up a voltage
gradient, a bulb releases that electrostatic potential energy by letting charges slide down
another voltage gradient. Those two devices make a perfect pair: the battery provides electric power, and the bulb consumes it. The bulb uses this power to heat its tungsten filament
so hot that it glows yellow-whiteâbut how does electricity heat the filament?
Consider a flashlight with two alkaline batteries (Fig. 10.3.9a). The bulbâs filament is
a fine wire, and its two ends are electrically connected to the battery chainâs terminals. With
one end at 3.0 V and the other at 0.0 V, the filament has a voltage gradient across it and
therefore an electric field. How is that possible? While discussing copiers, we observed that
a conductor has a uniform voltage throughout. Isnât the filament violating that rule?
No, it isnât. While a conductor has a uniform voltage when its charges are in equilibrium, the charges in the bulb are in equilibrium only when the flashlight is off. When you
switch the flashlight on, you impose a 3.0-V difference between the two ends of the filament and the filamentâs charges immediately begin accelerating down the voltage gradient
toward the 0.0-V end.
In our voltage â altitude analogy, itâs as though you suddenly tilted a level field to
create a hill and water that had been lying motionless on that field now accelerated downhill.
However, a better analog to the individual charges that weâre considering at the moment
would be bicyclists. Picture hundreds of bicyclists on a level field that suddenly tilts to form
a hill. All the bicyclists that were at equilibrium on the level field now accelerate downhill.

If the filament were a perfect conductor of electricity, each charge would accelerate
steadily down the voltage gradient and convert its electrostatic potential energy into kinetic
energy. However, the filament has a large electrical resistanceâit significantly impedes the
flow of electric current. Instead of accelerating smoothly from one end of the filament to
the other, each charge bounces its way down the voltage gradient, colliding frequently with
the filamentâs tungsten atoms and giving up kinetic energy with each collision (Fig.
10.3.9b). What began as ordered electrostatic potential energy in the charges becomes thermal energy in the tungsten atoms, and the filament glows brightly. Referring again to our
voltage â altitude analogy, picture the bicyclists riding down a rough hill strewn with
rocks and trees (Fig. 10.3.9c). They pick up bruises instead of speed.
What about the metal strips connecting the flashlightâs batteries and bulb? These strips
are excellent conductors, but like all ordinary electrical wires, theyâre not quite perfect.
Each strip has a small electrical resistance, so charges canât coast through it because of
inertia alone. Instead, the charges need a small voltage gradient to keep them moving forward, and they emerge from the strip at a slightly lower voltage than where they entered.
The missing energy has become thermal energy, slightly heating the metal strip. In general,
the less electrical resistance in the strips carrying current to and from the bulb, the less
power is wasted on route and the more power reaches the bulb. Thatâs why itâs so important
to use thick metal strips or even the flashlightâs metal case in the connections.
A poor connection anywhere in the circuit can spoil this efficient transfer of power. If
there is dirt or grease on a battery terminal or worn materials in the switch, the current will
have to pass through a large electrical resistance and waste power. Improving that connection, either by shaking the flashlight or by cleaning the metal surfaces, will increase the
current flow through the circuit, reduce the wasted power, and brighten the flashlight.

Check Your Understanding #4: You Get What You Pay For
The battery in your car is dead, so you use cheap jumper cables to connect the electric system in your
car to the electric system in your friendâs car. When you try to start your car, too little power reaches
it to start its engine. Whatâs wrong with those cables?
Answer:

The cables have relatively large electrical resistances.

Why: Starting your car requires a huge current, and the wires supplying that current must not limit
it or waste its energy. Cheap jumper cables have too much electrical resistance to fulfill those requirements. There is no substitute for good, thick jumper cablesâtheyâre worth the extra money.

When you turn on the flashlight, an electric current carries power from its two alkaline
batteries to its bulb. Letâs suppose that a current of 1 A is flowing through the flashlightâs
circuit and take a look at how much power is being transferred.
A bulb consumes electric power because the current passing through it slides down the
voltage gradient and there is a drop in voltage between where the current arrives at the filament and where it leaves the filament. This voltage drop measures the electrostatic potential energy each unit of charge loses while struggling through the filament. Multiplying the
voltage drop by the current passing through the bulb gives you the power consumed by
the bulb. This observation can be written as a word equation:
power consumed = voltage drop Âˇ current,
in symbols:
P = V Âˇ I,

(10.3.1)

CHAPT ER 10 Electricity

and in everyday language:
A large electric current dropping from high voltage to low voltage is like the
torrent of water dropping from high to low over Niagara Falls: both release a lot
of power.
Since the voltage drop across the bulb is 3.0 V and the current passing through it is 1.0 A,
itâs consuming 3.0 W of power.
A battery chain produces electric power because the current passing through it is
pushed up a voltage gradient and there is a rise in voltage between where the current
arrives at the battery chain and where it leaves the battery chain. This voltage rise measures the electrostatic potential energy each unit of charge gains while being pumped
through the batteries. Multiplying the voltage gain by the current passing through the
batteries gives you the power provided by the batteries. This observation can be written as
a word equation:
power provided = voltage rise Âˇ current,

(10.3.2)

in symbols:
P = V Âˇ I,
and in everyday language:
Raising a large current from low voltage to high voltage is like pumping a huge
stream of water from low to high to fight a fire at the top of a skyscraper: both
require a lot of power.
Since the voltage rise across the chain is 3.0 V and the current passing through it is 1.0 A,
itâs providing 3.0 W of power.

Check Your Understanding #5: Current Trends in Music
A large battery powers your portable radio. Current enters the radio through one wire and leaves
through another. Which wire has a higher voltage?
Answer:

The wire through which current enters the radio.

Why: The radio is consuming power, so the current passing through it is experiencing a voltage
drop. The current has a higher voltage when it enters the radio than when it leaves.

Check Your Figures #1: When You Turn the Ignition Key
When you first start your car, its cold engine is difficult to turn and a 200-A current flows through its
starter motor. If there is a voltage drop of 12 V between where the current enters the starter and
where it leaves the starter, how much power is being consumed?
Answer:

2400 W of power is begin consumed.

Why: The voltage drop across the starter motor is 12 V (each coulomb of charge loses 12 J of energy
in passing through it), and the current through it is 200 A (200 C of charge pass through it each
second). We can use Eq. 10.3.1 to determine the power the motor is consuming:
power consumed = voltage drop Âˇ current
= 12 V Âˇ 200 A = 2400 W.

Flashlights

Check Your Figures #2: When You Turn the Ignition Key Again
When you restart the car, its warm engine is easier to turn and a smaller current of 150 A flows
through the carâs starter motor. The battery is supplying power to this current, and there is a voltage
rise of 12 V between where the current arrives at the battery and where it leaves the battery. How
much power is the battery providing?
Answer:

It is providing 1800 W of power.

Why: The voltage rise across the battery is 12 V (each coulomb of charge gains 12 J of energy in
passing through it), and the current through it is 150 A (150 C of charge pass through it each second). We can use Eq. 10.3.2 to determine the power the battery is providing:
power provided = voltage rise Âˇ current
= 12 V Âˇ 150 A = 1800 W.

Choosing the Bulb: Ohmâs Law
Our flashlightâs bulb is designed to operate properly with a voltage drop of 3.0 V. Subjected
to that voltage drop, it will carry a current of 1 A and thus consume 3 W of electric powerâ
just enough to make it glow properly. If you were to use the wrong bulb in this flashlight,
one designed for a different voltage drop, its filament would carry the wrong amount of
current and receive the wrong amount of power. Too much power would quickly burn out
its filament, while too little power would make the filament glow dimly.
The bulbâs filament must clearly match the flashlight, particularly the voltage of the
flashlightâs battery chain. For example, flashlights that use many batteries require bulb filaments that are designed to operate with large voltage drops. Why is the current carried by
a particular bulb filament related to the voltage drop across it, and why do different bulbs
respond differently to a particular voltage drop?
The relationship between current and voltage drop is the result of collisions. Charges
effectively stop each time they crash into metal atoms, so they need the push of an electric
field to keep them moving forward (Fig. 10.3.10). Doubling that electric field doubles each
chargeâs average speed and, because the number of mobile charges in the filament is fixed,
also doubles the overall current flowing through the filament. Since the electric field that
propels this current is the filamentâs voltage gradient, doubling the voltage drop through the
filament doubles the current as well.
Returning to our voltage â altitude analogy, picture bicyclists riding on extremely
rocky terrain without pedaling. These lazy bicyclists effectively stop each time they crash
into rocks, so they need the push of a slope to keep them moving forward. Doubling the

5 German physicist
Georg Simon Ohm
(1787â1854) served as a
professor of mathematics,
first at the Jesuitsâ college
of Cologne and then at the
polytechnic school of
Nuremberg. His numerous
publications were
undistinguished, with the
exception of one pamphlet
on the relationship
between current and
voltage. This extraordinary document, written in
1827, was initially
dismissed by other
physicists, even though it
was based on good
experimental evidence and
explained many previous
observations by others. In
despair, Ohm resigned his
position at Cologne, and it
was not until the 1840s
that his work was
accepted. He was finally
appointed professor of
physics at Munich only
two years before his
death.

slopeâs altitude gradientâthe altitude drop per meter of downhill travelâdoubles each
bicyclistâs average speed and, because the number of bicyclists who can fit on the hill at one
time is fixed, also doubles the overall current of bicyclists rolling down the hill. Since the
slope that propels this bicyclist current is the hillâs altitude gradient, doubling the hill height
doubles the current of bicyclists as well.
The influence of filament choice on current flow reflects the different electrical resistances of those filaments. Anything that increases the number of mobile electric charges
across the filamentâs width or allows those charges to maintain a higher average speed for a
given voltage drop will decrease the filamentâs electrical resistance and increase the current
flowing through it. In fact, electrical resistance is defined as the voltage drop through the
filament divided by the current that arises as a result. Making the filament thicker or shorter
will lower its resistance, as will changing its composition to make collisions less frequent.
Again our voltage â altitude analogy with bicyclists on a hill is helpful. Anything
that increases the number of bicyclists across the hillâs width or allows those bicyclists to
maintain a higher average speed for a given hill height will decrease the hillâs âbicycle
resistanceâ and increase the current of bicyclists rolling down it. In fact, âbicycle resistanceâ is defined as the hill height divided by the current of bicyclists it produces. Making
the hill wider or shorter will lower its bicycle resistance, as will changing its rockiness to
make collisions less frequent.
Combining these observations, we see that the current flowing through the filament is
proportional to the voltage drop through it and inversely proportional to the filamentâs
electrical resistance, which can be written:
current =

Wire

(10.3.3)

This relationship is called Ohmâs law, after its discoverer Georg Simon Ohm 5 .
Structuring the relationship this way separates the causes (voltage drop and electrical resistance) from their effect (current flow). However, this equation is often rearranged to eliminate the division. The relationship then takes its customary form, which can be written as a
word equation:

Long, skinny jumper cables have large resistances. When you connect them to
a battery to jumpstart your car, theyâll carry a relatively small current and your
car probably wonât start.
The SI unit of electrical resistance, the volt per ampere, is called the ohm (abbreviated
ÎŠ, the Greek letter omega). Despite its simplicity, Ohmâs law is extremely useful in physics
and electrical engineering. It applies to so many systems that nearly everything is ohmic,
that is, can be characterized by an electrical resistance. Once an objectâs electrical resistance is known, the current flowing through it can be calculated from its voltage drop or its
voltage drop can be calculated from the current flowing through it. Devices that obey
Ohmâs law are common in modern technology, often as simple electronic components
known as resistors (Figs. 10.3.11). A resistor carries a current equal to its voltage drop
divided by its resistance, and it experiences a voltage drop equal to the current it carries
times its resistance.

Flashlights

OHMâS LAW
The voltage drop through a wire is equal to the current flowing through that wire times
the wireâs electrical resistance.

Finally, an objectâs electrical resistance is typically temperature dependent. Rising
temperature increases the number of mobile charges in an object but also makes them collide more frequently with the jiggling atoms. If the increasing collision frequency dominates, as it does in metals, an objectâs resistance increases with temperature. For example,
a filament carries less and less current as it approaches operating temperature, a behavior
that helps it avoid overheating. However, if the increase in mobile charges dominates, as it
does in semiconductors, an objectâs resistance decreases with temperature. This explains
why semiconductor-based computer chips carry more and more current as they get hotter
and will self-destruct at excessive temperatures.
Check Your Understanding #6: Skin Protection
Your skin has a much larger electrical resistance than your tissues. If you touch the two terminals of
a battery with your fingers, where is the larger voltage dropâin your skin or in your tissues?
Answer:

The larger voltage drop is in your skin.

Why: The fluids in your body resemble saltwater when exposed to voltages; they conduct current
relatively well. If it werenât for your skinâs large electrical resistance, even battery voltages would be
capable of pushing large currents through you and might disrupt your heart and other functions.
However, your skinâs high resistance protects you from battery voltages. As long as your skin is dry
and intact, it usually takes higher voltages to push enough current through you to cause injury.

Check Your Figures #3: Light Resistance
Two 3-W flashlight bulbs have different resistances: 3 ÎŠ and 12 ÎŠ. Which bulb is meant to operate
from two 1.5-V alkaline batteries?
Answer:

Itâs the 3-ÎŠ bulb.

Why: Equation 10.3.3 indicates that, with the voltage drop of 3 V supplied by the two alkaline
batteries, the 3-ÎŠ bulb will carry:

Equation 10.3.1 then shows that this bulb consumes the specified 3 W:
power consumed = voltage drop Âˇ current
= 3 V Âˇ 1 A = 3 W.
With a voltage drop of 3 V, the 12-ÎŠ bulb will carry a current of 0.25 A and consume just 0.75 W of
power. It needs a voltage drop of 6 V to consume 3 W.

LED Flashlights: Series and Parallel Circuits
Unfortunately, lightbulbs drain flashlight batteries quickly and burn out at inconvenient
times. Since LEDs are much more energy efficient than bulbs and last almost forever, itâs
no surprise that LED flashlights are rapidly replacing bulb flashlights.

CHAPT ER 10 Electricity

LEDs are sophisticated semiconductor devices that weâll examine in Chapter 13. I
have ignored them until now because theyâre nonohmic; that is, they donât obey Ohmâs law
and cannot be characterized by resistance. Instead, an LED conducts zero current when the
voltage drop across it is less than a threshold voltage of about 2â4 V, depending on color,
and it conducts a large, potentially damaging current when the voltage drop is significantly
more than that threshold. Because small changes in voltage drop across the LED dramatically change the current passing through it, the LED is difficult to control on its own. Thatâs
why an LED is often paired with a resistor.
In a simple LED flashlight, current leaving the positive terminal of the batteries flows
sequentially through a resistor and an LED before returning to the negative terminal of
the batteries (Fig. 10.3.12a). That arrangement, in which the same current flows sequentially through each component, is known as a series circuit. Although all the components
in a series circuit carry the same current, they share the circuitâs overall voltage drop
(Fig. 10.3.12b). To apply the voltage â altitude analogy, a current of charge flowing through
a series of components is like a current of water flowing down a series of waterfalls
(Fig. 10.3.12c).
The overall voltage drop available to the LED flashlightâs power-consuming components is equal to the voltage rise provided by its batteries. Because they are in series, the
resistor and the LED must share that overall voltage drop (neglecting the small voltage
drops in the metal strips and switch). Since they also carry the same current, the resistorâs
ohmic behavior limits the current passing through the entire circuit, including the LED. In
effect, the resistor and LED negotiateâeach component takes enough of the overall voltage drop to allow it to conduct the same current as the other component. Following the
negotiation, the voltage drop across the LED is slightly more than its threshold voltage
and the rest of the overall voltage drop is taken by the resistor. The resistor is chosen so
that, when subject to that voltage drop, it conducts the right amount of current to power
the LED properly.
When an LED flashlight has more than one LED, the flashlight must supply each with
current. This is usually done by dividing the current from the batteries into parts and sending one part through each of the LEDs (Fig. 10.3.13a). That arrangement, in which the
current is divided into parts that flow simultaneously through each component, is known as
a parallel circuit. Although each component in a parallel circuit carries its own fraction of
the overall current, all the components experience the same voltage drop (Fig. 10.3.13b). In
the voltage â altitude analogy, a current of charge flowing through components in parallel
is like a current of water flowing down waterfalls in parallel (Fig. 10.3.13c).
In a typical multiple-LED flashlight, each LED is actually paired with a resistor to
regulate its current. The flashlight thus combines parallel and series circuits. Each LED and
its resistor are connected in series, so they carry the same current but share the overall
voltage drop. The multiple LED-resistor pairs are connected in parallel, so they carry separate portions of the circuitâs overall current but experience the same voltage drop.
Check Your Understanding #7: Electric Defrosters
Your car has an electric defroster on its rear window. That defroster consists of 12 thin metal strips
bonded to the inside surface of the glass. All the driver-side ends join together and all the passenger-side ends join together. When you switch on the defroster, current flows from the positive terminal
of the battery to the driver-side end of the defroster and from the passenger-side end of the defroster
to the negative terminal of the battery. Do the individual defroster strips form a series circuit or a
parallel circuit?
Answer:

The defroster strips form a parallel circuit.

Why: Current from the batteryâs positive terminal is divided into 12 portions, one for each of the 12
defroster strips. After flowing through the strips, those portions rejoin into a single current to return
to the batteryâs negative terminal. Because the strips are connected in parallel, they carry separate
currents but experience the same voltage drop.

Epilogue for Chapter 10
This chapter has dealt with three venues in which charge and electricity play important
roles. In Static Electricity, we introduced the concept of electric charge and discussed the
attractive and repulsive forces that charged particles exert on one another. We studied the
electrostatic potential energies stored in those charge forces and the relationship between
this energy and the voltages of various locations. We learned how different objects acquire

net charges through contact and how high voltages can be produced by separating large
quantities of opposite charge.
In Xerographic Copiers, we studied electric fields and saw how those fields can be
used to move charges from one place to another. We examined the corona discharges that
form in the strong electric fields around sharp points or thin wires at high voltages. We also
saw how placing a charge on one object can induce an opposite charge on a grounded
object nearby.
In Flashlights, we examined circuits to see how a current of electric charges can transfer power from batteries to a lightbulb. We found that both voltage and current contribute
to this power transfer, and we learned how the bulbâs electrical resistance governs the
power it consumes.

Explanation: Moving Water without Touching It
This experiment uses contact between dissimilar materials to give the comb a net electric
charge. Electrons shift from your hair to the comb, leaving your hair positively charged and
the comb negatively charged. Because the comb is an electrical insulator, its negative
charge remains trapped on its surface for a long time.
As you hold the negatively charged comb near the water stream, the comb attracts
positive charges present in the water and repels negative charges. Because the water conducts electricity somewhat, positive charges can travel down the water stream from the
faucet while negative charges travel the other way. The water thus acquires a net positive
charge in the presence of the negatively charged comb, an example of charging by induction. Since the oppositely charged water and comb attract one another, the water accelerates toward the comb and arcs sideways as it falls.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Static Electricity Works: When clothes tumble about in the dryer, contact between
dissimilar materials transfers negatively charged electrons from one item to the other. As a
result of this contact-charging effect, the various garments acquire net charges, some positive and others negative. When the clothes are subsequently separated, the work done in
pulling them apart becomes electrostatic potential energy and the clothes develop high voltages. High voltages can also develop when you walk across a carpet or drive your car along
the road. Since high voltage tends to push charges into the air as leaks and sparks, static
charging can be a nuisance. You can control it with the help of conducting materials; allowing charge to move spontaneously from high voltage to low voltage prevents large quantities
of separated charge from accumulating so that high voltages canât develop.
How Xerographic Copiers Work: The photoconductor in a xerographic copier allows light to
control the distribution of electric charge on its surface. This photoconductor is uniformly
precoated with charge by passing it near a corona discharge. An optical image of the original
document is then projected onto this charged photoconductor. Wherever light hits the photoconductor, the surface charge escapes. The result is a charge image on the photoconductor.
Tiny black toner particles, oppositely charged from the unilluminated portions of the photoconductor, are brought near the charge image. These toner particles stick to the charged
portions of the photoconductor, forming a visible image of the document. The toner particles
are then transferred to and fused onto a sheet of paper to create a finished copy.
How Flashlights Work: A flashlight produces light when a current flows through its electric
circuit. This circuit consists of a chain of batteries, a lightbulb, a switch, and several metal
strips, all connected in a continuous loop. The current obtains power as it passes through the
battery, and it releases this power as it passes through the filament of the lightbulb, heating
that filament white hot.
The switch provides a way to control the flow of current in the circuit. When the switch is
off, it breaks the circuit and prevents current from flowing completely around the circuit. Without a steady current to carry power from the batteries to the bulb, the bulb is dark. When the
switch is on, it completes the circuit so that power can reach the bulb and the bulb lights up.

If the charges are like, then the forces are repulsive. If the charges
are opposite, then the forces are attractive.

Magnetism and
Electrodynamics
ike electricity, magnetism is an important part of daily life. We use it to post notes on the
refrigerator and to figure out which way is north. The story of magnetism wouldnât be complete,
though, without including electricity. As weâll see, these two topics are related to one another
through change and motion. For example, moving electric charges give rise to magnetism, and
changing magnetism gives rise to electricity.
In this chapter, weâll examine magnetism itself, as well as several objects that use the relationships between electricity and magnetism to perform useful tasks. Since the word dynamics covers
change and motion, these relationships are part of a field of physics known as electrodynamics.
Brevity isnât the only reason for omitting reference to magnetism in the title of this field; the other
reason is that most magnetism is actually produced by electricity. In other words, most magnetism
is actually electromagnetism.

ACTIVE LEARNING
EXPERIMENTS

A Nail and Wire Electromagnet

To explore the relationships between electricity and
magnetism, try building a simple electromagnet. For this
project, you need a large steel nail or bolt, a meter or so
of insulated wire, a fresh 1.5-V AA battery, and
some small steel objects such as paper clips. The wireâs
metal conductor should be at least 0.65 mm in diameter
(22 gauge or larger) to carry the current youâll send
through it without becoming too hot.

Wind the wire tightly around the nail or bolt to form
a coil. You should complete at least 50 turns of wire, all in
the same direction. The exact number of turns isnât important, and you can make several layers. Be sure that the
two ends of the wire are still accessible and remove the
insulation from each end so that you can connect them to
the battery.

WARNING

Courtesy Lou Bloomfield

The electromagnet that you construct in this experiment will become hot during use.
Be prepared to drop the electromagnet if it becomes uncomfortably hot. Donât work
near flammable materials.

302

Household Magnets

Now test your electromagnet. Connect one uninsulated end of the coil to each terminal of the battery. You
can either hold the wires on the terminals with your fingers or use tape. A 1.5-V battery canât give you a shock
unless your skin is broken, but you should be prepared
for the wire to get hot as current flows through it. If it
gets too hot to hold, let go and make sure that the wire
detaches from the battery so that it doesnât start a fire.
Donât use a battery larger than AA or the wire may get
dangerously hot.

303

While current is flowing through the wire, the nail
will act as a strong magnet, an electromagnet. Try picking
up steel objects with this electromagnet. As you touch
each object with the nail, it should stick to the nailâs surface. Your electromagnet will temporarily magnetize the
steel object and attract it. What happens when you touch
this magnetized steel object to a second object? What
happens when you stop the flow of electric current
through the coil of the electromagnet? Why does the coil
get hot while current is flowing through it?

Chapter Itinerary
This chapter will examine (1) household magnets and (2)
electric power distribution. In Household Magnets, we look
at the forces that bind magnets to refrigerators and see why
compasses point northward. We also examine electromagnets to explain how electric doorbells work. In Electric
Power Distribution, we see how electricity and magnetism
are used to transport electric power from a distant power

plant to your home and how that electric power differs from
the power supplied by batteries. Although there are many
other magnetic and electromagnetic objects that we encounter daily, these two topics are representative of most of the
basic electromagnetic phenomena. For a more complete
preview, turn ahead to the Chapter Summary and Important
Laws and Equations at the end of the chapter.

Household Magnets
Weâre so used to having magnets around that we take
them for granted. Along with being useful, household magnets
also let us experiment with another of the basic forces in
nature. Although weâll see that magnetism is so intimately
related to electricity that the two are ultimately a single unified
whole, weâll find it helpful to begin our study of magnetism by
treating it as a separate phenomenon and bring electricity into
the picture gradually.
Questions to Think About: Why do two magnets attract or repel
each other, depending on how theyâre oriented? If a magnet is
attracted to two different refrigerators, why donât those two
refrigerators attract or repel one another? How can two strong
magnets grip one another from opposite sides of your hand?
Why isnât your hand involved in that magnetic attraction? How
can some magnets be turned on or off using electricity?

How would a family stay organized without refrigerator magnets? How would the doorbell ring if it couldnât use a magnet
to strike its bells? How would a scout navigate in the woods
without a compass? How would you get cash or charge purchases without magnetic strips on plastic cards?

Experiments to Do: Find two button-type refrigerator magnetsâsimple cylinders that resemble small hockey pucks. If
you try to stack these magnets, youâll find that they either
attract or repel one another. How do those forces depend on the
orientations of the magnets? on their separation? See whether
you can float one magnet on top of the other using the repulsive
force. What happens when you let go of the top magnet?
Now hold one of the button magnets near a refrigerator or
another steel object and study the forces that arise. Can you
find a way to make the two objects repel one another? Will a
magnet stick to things that arenât made of steel? What about
stainless steel?

304

CHAPT ER 11 Magnetism and Electrodynamics

Now find two identical sheet-type refrigerator magnetsâ
flexible strips that may have advertising printed on their surfaces.
Experiment with their interactions. Youâll find that simply flipping
one over doesnât change the forces from attraction to repulsion.
Instead, youâll have to slide the strips across one another. As they
slide, theyâll alternately attract and repel. How is that possible?
Finally, obtain iron powder or make some by filing down a

quite similar). Sprinkle some of this powder on your collection
of magnets. Notice that it forms strands that seem to bridge
the gaps between various points on the magnets. What is the
powder bridging? If you sprinkle your powder on a credit card
or magnetic ID card, youâll find that it also forms bridges. However, those bridges are tiny and spaced at irregular intervals.
Could there be information encoded in these erratically spaced
magnetic features?

1 Since magnetic
monopoles apparently
donât exist, magnets and
magnetic materials must
obtain their magnetic
poles through other
means. As weâll see later
in this section, electric
currents are magnetic and
electric current loops act
as magnetic dipoles.
Circulating currents exist
deep within all magnetic
materials and are
responsible for their
magnetism. Some of those
currents are associated
with charged electrons
orbiting atomic nuclei, but
most are associated with
the rotating nature of
electrons, a fundamental
characteristic known as
spin. Every electron is a
tiny magnetic dipole.

Refrigerator magnets come in all shapes and sizes, and some are more magnetically complicated than others. Itâs always best to start simple, so weâll begin with button-shaped magnets.
As you bring two button magnets together, they begin exerting forces on one another.
Youâll find that those forces can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on how the
magnets are oriented, but they always grow weaker with greater distance. Such magnetic
forces resemble the electric ones you encounter while removing clothes from a hot dryer,
but there are at least two important differences. First, reorienting two electrically charged
garments wonât turn their attraction into repulsion or vice versa. Second, no matter how
you arrange two button magnets, you canât get a magnetic spark to jump from one to the
other. Electricity and magnetism are evidently similar yet different. Whatâs the story?
Magnetism is a phenomenon that closely resembles electricity. Just as there are two
types of electric charges that exert electrostatic forces on one another, so there are two types
of magnetic poles that exert magnetostatic forces on one another. The word pole serves to
distinguish magnetism from electricity; poles are magnetic, while charges are electric.
The two types of poles are called north and south, and in keeping with this geographical
naming, theyâre exact opposites of one another. Both types of poles carry just one physical
quantity: magnetic pole. North poles carry positive amounts of magnetic pole, while south
poles carry negative amounts. It should come as no surprise that like poles repel each other,
while opposite poles attract. Furthermore, the magnetostatic forces between two poles grow
weaker as they move apart and are inversely proportional to the square of the distance
between them. So far, the similarities between electricity and magnetism are striking.
However, we now come to a crucial difference between electricity and magnetism:
while subatomic particles that carry pure positive or negative electric charges are common,
particles that carry pure north or south magnetic poles have never been found. Called magnetic monopoles, such pure magnetic particles may not even exist in our universe. That
cosmic omission explains why there are no magnetic sparks: without monopoles, there is
no magnetic equivalent of an electric charge that can leap from one place to another as a
magnetic current, let alone a magnetic spark.
Although isolated magnetic poles arenât available in nature, pairs of magnetic poles
are. These pairs consist of equal north and south poles, spatially separated from one another
in an arrangement called a magnetic dipole. Since the two opposite poles have equal magnitudes, they sum to zero and the magnetic dipole has zero net magnetic pole.
A simple button magnet has both a north pole and a south pole, usually on opposite
faces of the button (Fig. 11.1.1a). There are no purely north buttons or purely south buttons.
Amazingly enough, even slicing that button magnet in half wonât yield separated north and
south poles (Fig. 11.1.1b). Instead, new poles will appear at the cut edges and each piece
of the original magnet will end up with zero net pole! Breaking the button magnet in half
(Fig. 11.1.1c) will also produce pieces with zero net pole. For a discussion of why button
magnets always have zero net magnetic pole, see 1 .
We can now explain why two of these magnets sometimes attract and sometimes repel.
With two poles on each magnet, we have to consider four interactions: two repulsive interactions between like poles (north-north and south-south) and two attractive interactions

between opposite poles (north-south and south-north). Although it might seem that all
these forces should cancel, the distances separating the various poles and therefore the
forces between them depend on the magnetsâ orientations. Since the closest poles experience the strongest forces, they dominate. If you turn two like poles toward one another, the
two magnets will push apart (Fig. 11.1.2a). If you turn their opposite poles toward one
another, theyâll pull together (Fig. 11.1.2b). If you tip them at an angle, theyâll experience
torques that tend to twist opposite poles together and like poles apart.
Because there are no monopoles, weâre going to need some imagination to understand
magnetism well. Letâs start with units. Even though we canât collect a unit of pure north
pole, we can still define such a unit and understand its behavior. The SI unit of magnetic
pole is the ampere-meter (abbreviated AÂˇm). That astonishing choice, an electric unit
appearing in a magnetic unit, foreshadows the profound connections between electricity
and magnetism that weâll soon encounter.
Just as there is a Coulombâs law for electric charges, there is a Coulombâs law for magnetic poles. Coulombâs magnetic experiments, which were complicated by the fact that he had
to work with magnetic dipoles rather than individual poles, showed that the forces between
magnetic poles are proportional to the amount of each pole and inversely proportional to the
square of their separation. The exact relationship can be written as a word equation:
force =

,

(11.1.1)

in symbols:

,

and in everyday language:
Donât hold two strong magnetic poles near one another unless youâre prepared
to be pushed around hard as they attract or repel each other.
The force on pole1 is directed toward or away from pole2, and the force on pole2 is directed
toward or away from pole1. The permeability of free space is 4Ď Ă 10â7 N/A2. Consistent
with Newtonâs third law, the force that pole1 exerts on pole2 is equal in amount but oppositely directed from the force that pole2 exerts on pole1.

COULOMBâS LAW FOR MAGNETISM
The magnitudes of the magnetostatic forces between two magnetic poles are equal to
the permeability of free space times the product of the two poles divided by 4Ď times
the square of the distance separating them. If the poles are like, then the forces are
repulsive. If the poles are opposite, then the forces are attractive.

Check Your Understanding #1: Two Halves Make a Whole
You have a disk-shaped permanent magnet. The top surface is its north pole and the bottom surface
is its south pole. If you crack the magnet into two half circles, the two halves will push apart. Why?
Answer: The top surfaces of both halves are still north poles, and the bottom surfaces are still south
poles. The two tops repel, as do the two bottoms.
Why: This puzzling phenomenon, in which a shattered permanent magnet opposes attempts to reassemble it, is an illustration of the potential energy contained in a permanent magnet. The magnet is
a collection of many tinier magnets, all aligned with their north poles together and their south poles
together. Like poles repel one another, so the tiny magnets are difficult to hold together. Given a
chance, the magnet will push apart into fragments. Very strong permanent magnets release so much
potential energy when they break that they practically explode when cracked.

The Refrigerator: Iron and Steel
Two button magnets can push or pull on one another, but what if you have only one? The
easiest way to observe magnetic forces in that case is to hold that single magnet near your
refrigerator or another piece of iron or steel. The magnet is attracted to the refrigerator.
However, if you flip the button magnet over, thinking that it will now be repelled by the
refrigerator, youâll be disappointed. Although the refrigerator is clearly magnetic, its magnetism somehow responds to the button magnet so that the two always attract.
Actually, the refrigeratorâs behavior isnât all that mysterious. Its steel is composed
of countless microscopic magnets, each with a matched north pole and south pole
(Fig. 11.1.3). Normally those individual magnetic dipoles are oriented semirandomly
(Fig. 11.1.3a), so the refrigerator exhibits no overall magnetism. However, as you bring one
pole of a button magnet near the refrigerator, its tiny magnets evolve in size, shape, and
orientation (Fig. 11.1.3b). Overall, opposite poles shift closer to the button magnetâs pole
and like poles shift farther from the button magnetâs pole. The steel develops a magnetic
polarization and consequently attracts the pole of the button magnet.
This polarization remains strong only as long as the button magnetâs pole is nearby.
When you remove the button magnet, most of the tiny magnets in the steel resume their
semirandom orientations and the steelâs magnetic polarization shrinks or disappears.
When you then bring the button magnetâs other pole close to the refrigerator, its steel
develops the opposite magnetic polarization and again attracts the button magnetâs pole.
No matter which pole or assortment of poles you bring near the refrigerator, its steel will
polarize in just the right way to attract those poles.

If you try this trick with a plastic or aluminum surface, the button magnet wonât stick.
Whatâs special about steel that allows it to develop such a strong magnetic polarization?
The answer is that ordinary steel, like its constituent iron, is a ferromagnetic materialâit
is actively and unavoidably magnetic on the size scale of atoms.
To understand ferromagnetism, we must start by looking at atoms and the subatomic
particles from which theyâre constructed: electrons, protons, and neutrons. For complicated
reasons, all those subatomic particles have magnetic dipoles, particularly the electrons, and
the atoms they form often display this magnetism. Despite a tendency for the subatomic
particles to pair up with opposite orientations so that their magnetic dipoles cancel one
another, most isolated atoms have significant magnetic dipoles.
Although most atoms are intrinsically magnetic, most materials are not. Thatâs because
another round of pairing and canceling occurs when atoms assemble into materials. This
second round of cancellation is usually so effective that it completely eliminates magnetism at the atomic scale. Materials such as glass, plastic, skin, copper, and aluminum retain
no atomic-scale magnetism at all, and your button magnet wonât stick to them. Even most
stainless steels are nonmagnetic.
However, there are a few materials that avoid this total cancellation and thus manage
to remain magnetic at the atomic scale. The most important of these are the ferromagnets,
a class of magnetic materials that includes ordinary steel and iron. If you examine a small
region of ferromagnetic steel, youâll find that it is composed of many microscopic regions, or
magnetic domains, that are naturally magnetic and cannot be demagnetized (Fig. 11.1.3a).
Within a single domain, all the atomic-scale magnetic dipoles are aligned and together they
give the overall domain a substantial net magnetic dipole.
While common steel always has these magnetic domains, magnetic interactions orient
nearby domains so that their magnetic dipoles oppose one another and cancel. The microscopic magnets balance one another so well that the steel appears nonmagnetic. Thatâs too
bad; the appliance showroom would be a much more exciting place to visit if the cancellation werenât so good.
However, when you bring a strong magnetic pole near steel (Fig. 11.1.3b), the individual domains grow or shrink, depending on which way theyâre oriented magnetically.
The steel undergoes magnetization and becomes magnetized (Fig. 11.1.3c). The atoms
themselves donât move during this process; the change is purely a reorientation of the
atomic-scale magnetic dipoles. Domains that attract your button magnetâs pole grow
while those that repel it shrink, and the button magnet sticks to the refrigerator.

If you touch the north pole of a permanent magnet to one end of a steel paper clip, the clipâs other
end will become magnetic. What pole will that other end have?
Answer: It will have a north pole.

Why: The paper clip will become magnetically polarized with its south pole nearest the permanent

long chain.

When you remove your button magnet from the refrigerator, the steel returns to its original
nonmagnetic stateâit undergoes demagnetization and becomes demagnetized. Well,
almost demagnetized. The demagnetization process isnât perfect because some of the
domains get stuck. Although magnetic forces within the steel favor a complete return to
apparent nonmagnetism, chemical forces can make it hard for the domains to grow or
shrink. Adjacent domains are separated by domain walls, boundary surfaces between one
direction of magnetic orientation and another. These domain walls must move if the
domains are to change size. However, flaws and impurities in the steel can interact with a
domain wall and keep it from moving. When that happens, the steel fails to demagnetize
itself completely (Fig. 11.1.4). To remove the last bit of residual magnetism from steel, you
must help the domain walls move, typically with heat or mechanical shock.
A soft magnetic material is one that demagnetizes itself easily when all nearby poles
are removed. Chemically pure iron, which has few flaws or impurities, is a soft magnetic
materialâeasy to magnetize and easy to demagnetize. A hard magnetic material is one
that does not demagnetize itself easily and that tends to retain whatever domain structure is
imposed on it by its most recent exposure to strong nearby poles (Fig. 11.1.3c). Your button
magnet is made from a hard magnetic material!
Like steel, the material in your button magnet is ferromagnetic (or closely related to
ferromagnetic). Unlike steel, however, your button magnetâs domains do not shrink or
grow easily. During its manufacture, the button magnet was magnetized by exposing it to
such strong magnetic influences that its domains rearranged to give it permanent magnetic poles. It now has a north pole on one face and a south pole on the other. Unless you
expose the button to extremely strong magnetic influences or heat it or pound it, it will
retain its present magnetization almost indefinitely. In that respect, the button is a permanent magnet.
Not all permanent magnets are as simple as button magnets. Depending on how they
were magnetized, they can have their north and south poles located in unexpected places
and even have more than one pair of poles. Plastic sheet magnets are a good example of
multiple-pole magnets: each has a repeating pattern of alternate poles along its length. The
exact patterns vary, but most have poles that form alternating parallel stripes. You can find
these stripes by letting them polarize and attract iron powder (Fig. 11.1.5) or by sliding two
identical sheet magnets across one another. The sheets will attract and bind together most
strongly when opposite poles are aligned across from each other. Theyâll repel when you
shift one of the magnets so that like poles are aligned.
A hard magnetic materialâs ability to ârememberâ its magnetization can be useful for
saving information. Once magnetized in a particular manner so as to represent a piece of
information, the material will retain its magnetization and the associated information until
something magnetizes it differently. Information retention in hard magnetic materials
forms the basis for most magnetic recording and storage, including the magnetic strips
on credit cards, magnetic tapes, computer disks, and magnetic random access memory
(MRAM) (Fig. 11.1.6).

Check Your Understanding #3: Now for the Flip Side
If you bring the north pole of a large strong magnet near the north pole of a small weak magnet that
you are holding in place, what will happen to that small magnet?
Answer: Its magnetic poles will interchange.
Why: Even though the small magnet canât move, its magnetic poles can. When the repulsion between
the two north poles becomes strong enough, the poles of the small magnet will interchange and it
will then present its south pole to the north pole of the large magnet. You will have permanently
reversed the small magnetâs poles.

Compasses
If youâve spent time hiking, you may well own a magnetic compass. Like a button magnet,
the needle of that compass is a simple permanent magnet with one north magnetic pole and
one south magnetic pole. This needle aids navigation because Earth itself has a magnetic
dipole and that dipole affects the orientation of the needleâthe needleâs north magnetic
pole tends to point northward.
Already, we can guess what must be located near Earthâs north geographic poleâa
south magnetic pole. Attraction from that south magnetic pole is what draws the compassâs
north magnetic pole toward the north. However, the full story is more complicated. To
begin with, Earthâs magnetic poles are actually located far beneath its surface and arenât
perfectly aligned with the geographic poles. To make matters worse, magnetically active
materials in everything from distant mountains to nearby buildings assert their own magnetic influences on the compass needle. Overall, the compass needle is responding to the
influences of countless magnetic poles, both near and far. Given how difficult it would be
to sum up all those separate influences, it is easier to view the compass needle as interacting
with something localâa magnetic field, an attribute of space that exerts a magnetostatic
force on a pole. According to this new perspective, the compass needle responds to the
local magnetic field, a field thatâs created by all the surrounding magnetic poles.
As with an electric field, the magnetic field here appears to be acting merely as an
intermediary; various poles produce the magnetic field, and this magnetic field affects our
compass needle. As weâll see, however, a magnetic field is more than just an intermediary
or a fiction. It is quite real and can exist in space, independent of the poles that produce it.
Just as electric fields can be created by things other than charge, so magnetic fields can be
created by things other than pole.
The magnetic field at a given location measures the magnetostatic force that a unit of
pure north pole would experience if it were placed at that point. More specifically, the
magnetostatic force is equal to the pole times the magnetic field at the poleâs position. We
can write this relationship as a word equation:
magnetostatic force = pole Âˇ magnetic field,

(11.1.2)

in symbols:
F = pB,
and in everyday language:
If you place a strong magnet in a big magnetic field, expect to be pushed around,
where the magnetostatic force is in the direction of the magnetic field. Note that a negative
amount of pole (a south pole) experiences a force opposite the magnetic field. The SI unit
of magnetic field is the newton per ampere-meter, also called the tesla (abbreviated T).

2 Earthâs magnetic poles
are not particularly well
aligned with its geographical poles and have
actually moved about
1100 km over the past
century. Earthâs south
magnetic pole is presently
drifting northwest across
the Canadian arctic at
about 40 kilometers per
year. Moreover, Earthâs
magnetic poles have been
trading places about once
every 700,000 years for
the past 330 million years.
The most recent reversal
was about 780,000 years
ago.

Earthâs magnetic field is relatively weak, about 0.00005 T in a roughly northward direction (see 2 ). (For comparison, the field near your button magnet may be 0.1 T or more.)
Earthâs field pushes the compass needleâs north pole northward and south pole southward
(Fig. 11.1.7). Unless the compass needle is perfectly aligned with that field, it experiences a
torque and undergoes angular acceleration. Since its mount allows the needle to rotate only
horizontally and it experiences mild friction as it does, the needle soon settles down with its
north pole pointing roughly northward. If its mount allowed it to rotate vertically as well as
horizontally, the needleâs north pole would dip downward in the northern hemisphere and
upward in the southern hemisphere. In general, the needle minimizes its magnetostatic
potential energy by pointing along the direction of the local magnetic field and is thus in a
stable equilibrium when orientated that way. After a few swings back and forth, your compass needle points along the local magnetic field, which, we hope, points northward.
Because Earthâs magnetic field is so uniform in the vicinity of your compass, its northward push on the needleâs north pole exactly balances its southward push on the needleâs
south pole and the needle experiences zero net force. However, if you bring your compass
near a button magnet, the local magnetic field will not be uniform and the needle may
experience a net force. The magnetic field gets stronger near one of the buttonâs poles and
the compass needle will experience a net force toward or away from that pole, depending
on which way itâs orientated.
When the needle is aligned with a nonuniform fieldâits north pole pointing in the
same direction as the local fieldâthe forces on its two opposite poles wonât balance and it
will experience a net force in the direction of increasing field. If it is aligned against the
field, it will experience a net force in the direction of decreasing field. In practice, as you
bring the compass near your button magnet, its needle will first pivot into alignment with
the local field and then find itself pulled toward increasing field, toward the nearest pole of
the button magnet. The same thing happens when you bring two button magnets together;
each pivots into alignment with the otherâs magnetic field, and the two then leap at each
other. Watch out for your fingers!
A piece of steel exhibits similar behavior when you hold it near a button magnet: it
becomes magnetized along the direction of the local magnetic field and then finds itself
pulled toward increasing field, toward the button magnetâs nearest pole. Thatâs how the
button magnet holds your notes to the refrigerator!
Check Your Understanding #4: Crazy Compass

Earth's magnetic field

You lock the needle of your compass and move its north pole near the north pole of a powerful button
magnet. Will the needle experience a magnetostatic force toward strong field or weak field?
Answer: The needle will experience a force toward weak magnetic field (away from the button magnet).

N
S

Why: With its magnetic poles aligned opposite to the buttonâs magnetic field, the compass needle
experiences a force toward weaker magnetic field. Actually, if you continue to push the needle closer
to the button magnet, you can accidentally remagnetize that needle; its poles will permanently interchange and it will subsequently point south rather than north! Not to worry, though, because you can
simply repeat this procedure to restore the compass to normal.

Check Your Figures #1: Careful with That Wrench!

Fig. 11.1.7 A compass
needle aligns with the
local magnetic field. Its
north pole experiences a
magnetostatic force in the
direction of the field, and
its south pole experiences
a force opposite the field.

You mistakenly place a long steel wrench in the 1-T field near a strong magnet. The field magnetizes
the wrench, and it develops a north pole of 1000 AÂˇm at its near end and an equal south pole at its
distant end. Only the near end of the wrench is in the 1-T field and experiences a magnetic force.
What force does the field exert on the wrench and its north pole?
Answer: It exerts almost 1000 N (225 lb) in the direction of the field.
Why: According to Eq. 11.1.2, the force exerted on the wrenchâs north pole is equal to its 1000-AÂˇm
pole times the 1-T magnetic field. Since 1 T = 1 N/AÂˇm, that product is 1000 N and points in the
direction of the field. Such large forces are not unusual when steel or iron objects are exposed to a
strong magnetic field, so be careful working near big magnets!

Household Magnets

Iron Filings and Magnetic Flux Lines
Magnetic fields seem abstract; it would be helpful if you could see them. Remarkably
enough, you canâjust sprinkle iron filings into the field! Although youâll need to support
their weight with paper or a liquid, an interesting pattern will form. Like tiny compass
needles, the iron particles magnetize along the local magnetic field and then stick together,
north pole to south pole, in long strands that delineate the magnetic field (Fig. 11.1.8)!
These strands map the magnetic field in an interesting way. First, at each point on a
strand, the strand points along the local magnetic field. Second, the strands are most tightly
packed where the local magnetic field is strongest. In other words, the strands follow along
the local magnetic field direction and have a density proportional to that local field. The
lines highlighted by these strands are so useful that they have their own name, magnetic
flux lines.
Flux lines are often helpful when exploring a magnetic field. If youâre studying the
magnetic field in a large area, you probably donât want to use iron filings. Instead, you can
hold a compass in your hand and walk in the direction its needle is pointingâthe direction
of the magnetic field. The path youâll follow in this compass-guided walk is a magnetic flux
line. If you repeat this trip from many different starting points, youâll explore the whole
magnetic field, flux line by flux line. Since a magnetic field tends to point away from north
poles and toward south poles, these tours will typically take you from north poles to south
poles. In fact, for our permanent magnets, every magnetic flux line begins at a north pole
and ends at a south pole.
That last observation about flux lines is quite general: they never start at or end on
anything other than a magnetic pole. While flux lines emerge in all directions from a north
pole and converge from all directions on a south pole, thatâs it; flux lines never begin or end
in empty space. If youâre following a magnetic flux line with your compass, you will either
reach a south pole or walk forever!
The possibility of that endless walk is somewhat disconcerting; if the flux line youâre
following doesnât end at a pole, what created its magnetic field? The answer reveals a
deep connection between magnetism and electricity. Some magnetic fields arenât produced by magnetic poles at all; theyâre produced by electricity! To see how thatâs possible, letâs take a look at another common household magnetâthe electromagnet in an
ordinary doorbell.

Check Your Understanding #5: Building Bridges
If you sprinkle iron filings onto the magnetic strip of a credit card, a pattern of tiny iron bridges will
form. Where are the magnetic poles relative to those bridges?
Answer: The poles are at the ends of the bridges.
Why: The iron filings follow the magnetic flux lines, which extend from north poles to south poles.
Thus, one end of each bridge is a north pole and the other end is a south pole.

Electric Doorbells and Electromagnets
A classic electric doorbell uses a magnet and a spring to drive a piece of iron into two
chimes, âding-dong.â When you press the doorbell button, you close an electric circuit and
the resulting electric current pushes the iron magnetically into the first chime, âding.â
When you release the button, you open the circuit, stopping the current and its magnetism
so that the spring can push the iron back into the second chime, âdong.â
The big news here is that electric currents can produce magnetic forces. In fact, there
is nothing optional about this connectionâelectric currents are magnetic. More specifically, moving electric charge produces a magnetic field.

FIRST CONNECTION BETWEEN ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Moving electric charge produces a magnetic field.

Imagine the surprise of Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted (1777â1851) when
he observed in 1820 that current in a wire caused a nearby compass needle to rotate.
Until that moment, electricity and magnetism had appeared to be independent phenomena. Inspired by Oerstedâs experiment, French physicist AndrĂŠ-Marie AmpĂ¨re 3 undertook a 7-year study of the relationships between electricity and magnetism, and started
the revolution that eventually unified them within a single overarching conceptual
framework.
When we use iron powder to disclose the magnetic flux lines surrounding a long,
straight, current-carrying wire, we too are in for a surprise (Fig. 11.1.9). Those flux lines
circle the wire like concentric rings, growing more widely separated as the distance from
the wire increases. The wire is an electromagnet, a device that becomes magnetic when it
carries an electric current. However, because an electromagnet has no true magnetic poles,
the magnetic flux lines canât stretch from north pole to south pole. Instead, each flux line of
an electromagnet is a closed loop. If you took a compass-guided walk along one of these
flux lines, youâd retrace your steps over and over.
Since the flux lines are packed tightest near the surface of the current-carrying wire,
thatâs where the magnetic field is strongest. Recalling that a piece of iron is pulled toward
increasing magnetic field, we see that the wire will attract iron to it whenever itâs carrying
a current.
The magnetic field around a current-carrying wire is fairly weak, however, and a practical doorbell winds that wire into a coil to concentrate and strengthen its field. Although
the magnetic field around a current-carrying coil is complicated, we can use iron powder to
make it visible (Fig. 11.1.10). Remarkably enough, the flux lines outside the coil resemble
those outside a button magnet of similar dimensions (Fig. 11.1.11). Itâs as though the coil
has a north pole at one end and a south pole at the other! Because there are no true poles
present, however, the flux lines donât end anywhere. Instead, they continue right through
the middle of the coil and form complete loops.
When current flows through the coil, nearby iron finds itself magnetized along the
local magnetic field and then pulled toward increasing fieldâtoward the tightly packed
flux lines at the coilâs end. But why stop there? Since the flux lines continue right into the
coil and grow even more tightly packed inside, the iron will be pulled inward toward
the very center of the coil!
Thatâs how the doorbell works. When you press the doorbell button, current flows
through a coil of wire and the resulting magnetic field yanks an iron rod into the center of

that coil. About the time the rod reaches the center, part of it hits the first chime. When you
then open the switch, stopping the current and its magnetism, a spring pushes the iron rod
back out of the coil and it hits the second chime. These two chimes make the familiar dingdong!
While current is flowing through the coil and the iron rod is inside it, the two objects
act as a single powerful electromagnet. The magnetic field surrounding the pair is the sum
of the coilâs modest magnetic field and the magnetized ironâs much stronger field. In effect,
the current in the coil magnetizes the iron and the iron then creates most of the surrounding
magnetic field. Practical electromagnets, which control switches and valves in your furnace or air conditioner and can lift cars at the scrap yard, generally use iron or related
materials to dramatically enhance the magnetic field produced by a current in a coil of
wire (Fig. 11.1.12).

In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a patient is immersed in an intense magnetic field. That field
is created entirely without permanent magnets or even iron. How is that possible?
Answer: The magnetic field is created by the current in a coil of wire.
Why: MRI requires a magnetic field that is intense, uniform, and spacious enough for a patient to fit
inside. The best way to create such a colossal field is with a current-carrying coil. In fact, the field is
so enormous that its flux lines extend far from the magnet and can attract iron or steel objects from
across the room. Understandably, magnetic materials are forbidden near MRI magnets.

Electricity is a particularly useful and convenient form of
ordered energy. Because itâs delivered to our homes and offices
as a utility, we barely think about it, except to pay the bills. The
wires that bring it to us never plug up or need cleaning and
work continuously except when thereâs a power failure, blown
fuse, or tripped circuit breaker.
Just how does electricity get to our homes? In this section,
weâll look at the problems associated with distributing electricity far from the power plant at which itâs generated. To understand these problems, weâll examine the ways in which wires
affect electricity and see how electric power is transferred and
rearranged by devices called transformers.

Questions to Think About: Why do power distribution systems
use alternating current? What is the purpose of high-voltage
wires? Why does the power company place large electric
devices on the utility poles near homes or on the ground near
neighborhoods? What are the advantages and disadvantages of
120-V versus 230-V electric power?
Experiments to Do: Experiments with electric power distribution are rather dangerous, but you can observe the ways in
which your local electric power is distributed. If your area is
connected to a major electric power network, youâll be able to
find an entire hierarchy of power-conversion facilities. The
power should travel from the power plant to your town on highvoltage wires, normally located overhead on tall pillars or
pylons. These wires should end at a large power-conversion
facility, where enormous devices transfer power to the lowervoltage power lines that fan out across your town. In some
places, these wires are overhead; in others, theyâre underground. However, this power is still not ready for household
use. It goes through at least one more stage of conversion
before it reaches individual homes.
All these conversion steps are performed by transformers.
You can find transformers as boxes or cylinders on utility poles
or on the ground outside homes. In cities, transformers are
often located inside buildings, out of sight. Even though you
may have trouble finding these transformers, theyâre there. In
this section, weâll see why theyâre necessary.

WARNING
Electricity is dangerous, particularly when it involves high voltages. The principal hazard is that an electric current will pass through your body in the vicinity of your heart
and disrupt its normal rhythm. Very little current is needed to cause trouble, but your
skin is such a poor conductor that it normally prevents harmful currents from passing
through you. Be careful around high voltages, however, because they can propel dangerous currents through your skin and put you at risk. Although your body usually has
to be part of a closed circuit for you to receive a shock, donât count on the absence of
an identifiable circuit to protect you from injuryâcircuits have a tendency to form in
surprising ways whenever you touch an electric wire. Be especially careful whenever
youâre near voltages of more than 50 V, even in batteries, or when youâre near any
voltages if youâre wet or your skin is broken. That said, voltages of 12 V or less are so
unlikely to injure you that they are generally considered safe. Nearly all household
batteries provide voltages in that safe range and can be handled individually with little
risk of shock. Similarly, most power adapters for electronic devices provide 12 V or less
and thus rarely cause shocks.

Direct Current Power Distribution

4 Lewis Howard Latimer
(African American
scientist and inventor,
1848â1928) was only 8
years old when the U.S.
Supreme Courtâs Dred
Scott decision made his
escaped-slave father a
fugitive and forced him to
disappear. Left behind
with his mother, Latimer
did well in school and
became a skilled draftsman and engineer. While
working for Edisonâs
rival, Hiram Maxim,
Latimer became an expert
in fabricating carbon
filaments for incandescent
lamps. When Latimer
later joined Edisonâs team
of inventors, the âEdison
Pioneers,â his sturdy
carbon filaments quickly
replaced Edisonâs own
fragile bamboo ones and
provided the crucial
ingredient necessary for
Edisonâs lamps to become
a commercial success.

Batteries may be fine for powering flashlights, but theyâre not very practical for lighting
homes. Early experiments that placed batteries in basements were disappointing because
the batteries ran out of energy quickly and needed service and fresh chemicals all too
frequently.
A more cost-effective source for electricity was coal- or oil-powered electric generators. Like batteries, generators do work on the electric currents flowing through them and
can provide the electric power needed to illuminate homes. But although generators produce electricity more cheaply than batteries, early ones were large machines that required
fresh air and attention. These generators had to be built centrally, with people to tend them
and chimneys to get rid of the smoke.
This was the approach taken by the American inventor Thomas Alva Edison (1847â
1931) in 1882 when he began to electrify New York City following his development of a
practical incandescent lightbulb 4 . Each of the Edison Electric Light Companyâs generators acted like a mechanical battery, producing direct current (DC) that always left the
generator through one wire and returned to it through another. Edison placed his generators
in central locations and conducted the current to and from the homes he served through
copper wires. However, the farther a building was from the generator, the thicker the copper wires had to be. Thatâs because wires impede the flow of current and making them
thicker allows them to carry current more easily.
Wire thickness is important because, like the filament of the flashlight bulb we studied
in Chapter 10, wires have electrical resistance. In accordance with Ohmâs law (Eq. 10.3.4),
the voltage drop through a wire is equal to its electrical resistance times the current passing
through it. In the case of a wire conducting current from a generating plant to a home, our
primary concern is how much power the wire wastes as thermal power. We can determine
this wasted power by combining Ohmâs law with the equation for power consumed by a
device (Eq. 10.3.1):
power consumed = voltage drop Âˇ current
= (current Âˇ electrical resistance) Âˇ current
= current2 Âˇ electrical resistance.

(11.2.1)

Electric Power Distribution

The wireâs wasted power is proportional to the square of the current passing through it!
This relationship became all too clear to Edison when he tried to expand his power distribution systems. The more current he tried to deliver over a particular wire, the more power
it lost as heat. Doubling the current in the wire quadrupled the power it wasted.
Edison tried to combat this loss by lowering the electrical resistances of the wires. He
used copper because only silver is a better conductor of current. He used thick wires to
increase the number of moving charges. He also kept the wires short so that they didnât
have much chance to waste power. This length requirement forced Edison to build his generating plants within the cities he served. Even New York City contained many local power
plants. (For an interesting tale about the early days of electric power, see 5 .)
Edison also tried to minimize waste by decreasing the currents in the wires while
increasing the voltage differences between those wires. Delivered power is equal to the
current times the voltage drop (see Eq. 10.3.1), so while less current flowed through each
home, the larger voltage drop left the delivered power unchanged.
The voltage difference between the two wires carrying current to and from a home is
often referred to as the voltage of the electric power. Using that terminology, Edison needed
to provide large-voltage or âhigh-voltageâ DC electric power to his customers. High voltage power is dangerous, however, because it can cause fire-starting sparks and nasty shocks.
It could be handled safely outside a home, but bringing it inside was another matter. Edison
used the highest voltage power that safety allowed.
Although scientists have discovered a number of materials that lose their electrical
resistance at extremely low temperatures and become perfect electrical conductors, or
superconductors (Fig. 11.2.1), these superconductors are still too impractical for powerdistribution systems. Their use is limited to local applications such as large electromagnets
and specialized electronic devices.

5 Love Canal is the most
famous U.S. toxic waste
dump. The dump was
created in the 1920s at an
abandoned section of
canal constructed in 1892
by William T. Love.
Love intended his canal
to connect the upper and
lower Niagara Rivers so
that the descending water
could be used to generate
DC electric power for the
citizens of Niagara Falls,
New York. The advent of
AC power transmission
systems in 1896 made the
canal less useful, and it
was never finished.

Check Your Understanding #1: The Trouble with DC Electric Power
If Edison doubled the length of his delivery wires, while keeping the currents through them the same,
what would happen to the power they consumed?

Courtesy Lou Bloomfield

Answer: The power would roughly double.
Why: Doubling the length of a wire is like placing two identical wires one after the next. If each wire
uses 1 unit of power, then two wires should use roughly 2 units of power. Electrical resistance is
proportional to the length of a wire and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of that wire.
Shortening and thickening a wire reduce its resistance.

Introducing Alternating Current
The real problem with distributing electric power via direct current is that thereâs no easy
way to transfer power from one DC circuit to another. Because the generator and the lightbulbs must be part of the same circuit, safety requires that the entire circuit use low voltages
and large currents. DC power distribution therefore wastes much of its power in the wires
connecting everything together.
However, as weâll soon see, alternating current (AC) makes it easy to transfer power
from one AC circuit to another so that different parts of the AC power-distribution system
can operate at different voltages with different currents. Most significantly, the wires that
carry the power long distances are part of a high-voltage, low-current circuit and therefore
waste little power.
An alternating current is one that periodically reverses directionâit alternates. For example, when you plug a toaster into an AC electrical outlet and switch it on, the current that flows
through the toasterâs heating element reverses its direction of travel many times each second.
The power company propels this alternating current through the toaster by subjecting
it to an alternating voltage drop, a voltage drop that periodically reverses direction. As you

voltage of its hot wire varies

flows through the toaster

voltage, that current reverses
each time the voltage of the
hot wire reverses.

may recall from Section 10.3 on flashlights, current in a filament, heating element, or any
other device that obeys Ohmâs law flows down a voltage gradient, from a higher voltage to
a lower voltage, much as bicyclists roll down an altitude gradient from a higher altitude to
a low altitude or as water flows down a pressure gradient from a higher pressure to a lower
pressure. While a flashlightâs battery subjects the flashlightâs filament to a steady voltage
drop and obtains a direct current, the power company subjects the toasterâs heating element
to an alternating voltage drop and obtains an alternating current.
Alternating voltages are present at any AC electrical outlet. In the United States, an
ordinary AC outlet offers three connections: hot, neutral, and ground (Fig. 11.2.2). In a
properly installed outlet, the absolute voltage of neutral remains near 0 V, while the absolute voltage of hot alternates above and below 0 V. Ground, which is an optional safety
connection that weâll discuss later, also remains near 0 V absolute.
One of the toasterâs wires is connected to hot and the other to neutral (Fig. 11.2.3).
Since current always flows through the toasterâs heating element from higher voltage to
lower voltage, it flows from hot to neutral when hot has a positive voltage (Fig. 11.2.3a).
and from neutral to hot when hot has a negative voltage (Fig. 11.2.3b).
In normal AC electric power, the hot voltage varies sinusoidallyâitâs proportional to the
trigonometric sine function with respect to time (Fig. 11.2.4). This smoothly alternating voltage propels a smoothly alternating current through the toaster. During each reversal, the current in the heating element gradually slows to a stop before gathering strength in the opposite
direction. In the United States, AC voltages reverse every 120th of a second, yielding 60 full
cycles of reversal (back and forth) each second (60 Hz). In Europe, the reversals occur every
100th of a second, so AC voltages complete 50 full cycles of reversal each second (50 Hz).
Fortunately, these reversals have little effect on many household devices. Toasters,
electric heaters, and incandescent lightbulbs consume power because of their electrical
resistances and donât care which way current passes through them. In fact, power consumption in such simple ohmic devices is used to define an effective voltage for AC electric
power. An outletâs nominal AC voltageâtechnically, its root mean square (RMS) voltageâis defined to be equal to the DC voltage that would cause the same average power
consumption in an ohmic device. Thus, 120-V AC power delivers the same average power
to a toaster as 120-V DC power.
However, the reversals of AC power arenât without consequence. First, some electrical
and most electronic devices are sensitive to the direction of current flow and must handle
the reversals carefully. Second, the power available from an ordinary AC outlet rises and
falls with each voltage reversal and is momentarily zero at the reversal itself. The toasterâs
heating element actually varies slightly in temperature because of these power fluctuations,
and devices that canât tolerate even an instant without power must store energy to avoid
shutting down during the reversals.
Finally, AC powerâs sinusoidally varying voltages peak well above their nominal values, exceeding those values by a factor of the square root of 2 (about 1.414). For example,
the voltage of the hot connection in an ordinary 120-V AC power outlet actually swings
between +170 V and â170 V. Those higher peak voltages are important for insulation and
electrical safety.
Check Your Understanding #2: Timing Is Everything
Sticking your fingers into an electrical outlet is never a good idea, but is there a moment when you
could do it without getting a shock?
Answer: Yes, you could do it at the moment the voltages are reversing.
Why: While the ground and neutral wires of the electrical outlet are normally without charge and
therefore relatively safe, the hot wire is usually charged and dangerous. That hot wireâs voltage alternates rapidly between high positive voltage and high negative voltage. Only when itâs passing through
0 V can you touch it without risking a shock. However, that safe moment is so brief that you canât
realistically avoid a shock. Donât try it!

Magnetic Induction
Edison was adamantly opposed to alternating current, which he viewed as dangerous and
exotic. Indeed, its fluctuating voltages and moments without power donât make alternating
current look attractive at all.
The champion of alternating current was Nikola Tesla (1856â1943), a Serbian American inventor who was backed financially by the American inventor and industrialist George
Westinghouse (1846â1914). The advantage that Tesla and Westinghouse saw in alternating
current was that its power could be transformedâit could be passed via electromagnetic
action from one circuit to another by a device called a transformer.
A transformer uses two important connections between electricity and magnetism to
convey power from one AC circuit to another. The first is familiar: moving electric charge
creates magnetic fields. This connection allows electricity to produce magnetism. The second connection, however, is something new: magnetic fields that change with time create
electric fields. Discovered in 1831 by Michael Faraday 6 , this relationship allows magnetism to produce electricity!

SECOND CONNECTION BETWEEN ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Magnetic fields that change with time produce electric fields.

Whether you wave a permanent magnet back and forth, or switch an electromagnet on
and off, you are changing a magnetic field with time and thereby producing an electric
field. If there are mobile electric charges around to respond to that electric field, theyâll
accelerate and youâll have created or altered an electric current and possibly done work on
it as well. This process, whereby a time-changing magnetic field initiates or influences an
electric current, is called magnetic induction.
A transformer combines these two connections in sequenceâelectricity produces
magnetism produces electricity. However, rather than returning electric power to where it
started, the transformer moves that power from the current in one coil of wire through a
magnetic field to the current in a second coil of wire.

In the days of vinyl records, a phonograph reproduced sound by sliding a diamond stylus through a
recordâs undulating groove. A magnet attached to that stylus moved up and down with each undulation and produced a current in a nearby coil of wire. Why did the magnetâs motion affect the coil?
Answer: The moving magnet produced an electric field, which pushed mobile charges through that
wire coil.
Why: The tiny vibrating magnet affected the coilâs current via magnetic induction.

To help us understand the power transfer that takes place in a transformer, letâs start with a
simpler case. What happens when you send an alternating current through a single coil of
wire?
Because currents are magnetic, the coil becomes an electromagnet. However, since the
current passing through it reverses periodically, so does its magnetic field. Also, because a
magnetic field that changes with time produces an electric field, the coilâs alternating magnetic field produces an alternating electric field.
This induced electric field has a remarkable effectâit pushes on the very alternating
current that produces it! Although itâs not obvious how this electric field should affect that
current, the result turns out to be simple (Fig. 11.2.5). As the coilâs current increases,
the induced electric field pushes that current backward and thereby opposes its increase
(Fig 11.2.5b). As the coilâs current decreases, the induced electric field pushes that current
forward and thereby opposes its decrease (Fig 11.2.5d). No matter how the coilâs current
changes, the induced electric field always opposes that change!
This opposition to change is universal in magnetic induction, where itâs known as
Lenzâs law: when a changing magnetic field induces a current in a conductor, the magnetic
field from that current opposes the change that induced it. In other words, the effects of
magnetic induction oppose the changes that produce them. In the present case, self-directed
magnetic induction or âself-inductanceâ leads our coil to oppose its own changes in current. A wire coilâs natural opposition to current change makes it quite useful in electrical
equipment and electronics, where itâs called an inductor (Fig. 11.2.6).

When a changing magnetic field induces a current in a conductor, the magnetic field
from that current opposes the change that induced it.

the inductorâs current and

its induced electric field
opposes the current increase
and its induced emf takes
energy from the current.
(c) A constant current has a
constant magnetic field and
zero induced emf. (d) As
the inductorâs current and
magnetic field decrease,
its induced electric field
opposes the current decrease
and its induced emf gives
energy to the current.

However, our coilâs induced electric field does more than just push the current around;
it can also do positive or negative work on that current and thereby shift that current from
one voltage to another. The coilâs overall voltage shift, from one end of the coil to the other,
is known as its induced emf (short for electromotive force). Current enters the coil at one
voltage and exits at another voltage, courtesy of the coilâs induced emf.
For comparison, a battery has an electrochemical emf; current enters the battery at one
voltage and exits at another voltage, thanks to the batteryâs electrochemical emf. But while
a batteryâs electrochemical emf is fixed, a coilâs induced emf can change with time. When
an alternating voltage difference is applied to the coil, its induced emf alternates and exactly
matches the applied voltage difference.
A coilâs ability to shift an alternating current gracefully from one voltage to another
makes it possible to plug a properly designed coil into an AC electric outlet without causing
disaster. As the outletâs voltage difference alternates, the coilâs induced emf follows that voltage difference perfectly. Magnetic induction keeps the coilâs current small and, if we neglect
the coilâs tiny electrical resistance, none of the AC electric power is wasted as thermal power.
As the coilâs voltage difference and induced emf alternate, the coilâs current keeps
trying to flow from higher voltage to lower voltage. The coilâs opposition to current change,
however, delays the currentâs response so that its alternating current lags a quarter of an AC
cycle behind its alternating voltage difference. For example, the current reaches its peak
flow toward the top of the coil a quarter of an AC cycle after the voltage at the top of the
coil reached its peak positive value. Although the coilâs voltage difference and current both
vary sinusoidally with time, the current has a phase shift or phase delay of 90Â° relative to
the voltage difference.

Electric Power Distribution

Because of this phase shift, current flows through the coil from higher voltage to lower
voltage only half the time. The other half, current flows from lower voltage to higher voltage. When current flows toward lower voltage, the induced emf removes electrostatic
potential energy from the current. When current flow toward higher voltage, the induced
emf returns electrostatic potential energy to the current. Energy alternately leaves the current and returns, but where does that energy reside when itâs not in the current?
The missing energy is in the coilâs magnetic field! Magnetic fields contain energy. The
amount of energy in a uniform magnetic field is half the square of the field strength times
the volume of the field divided by the permeability of free space. We can write this relationship as a word equation:

Strong permanent magnets store so much magnetic energy that they
can be dangerous if you break them. The pieces will flip around violently,
and you may get pinched.

COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Magnets as Limitless Sources of Energy
Misconception: Magnets are infinite sources of energy that could provide electric or mechanical
power forever!
Resolution: Although a magnetâs field does contain energy, that energy is limited and was invested
in it during its magnetization. To extract that energy, youâd have to demagnetize and thus destroy
the magnet.

In effect, our coil is playing with the alternating currentâs energy, storing it briefly in
the magnetic field and then returning it to the current. The coil stores energy while the
magnitude of the current increasesâthe field strengthens and the current loses voltage. The
coil returns energy while the magnitude of the current decreasesâthe field weakens and
the current gains voltage. Because the coilâs self-induced emf is responsible for bouncing
this energy back to the current, itâs frequently called a back emf.

Check Your Understanding #4: Slow Fall
If you drop a strong magnet onto a nonmagnetic but highly conducting surface, the magnet will
descend remarkably slowly. Whatâs delaying the magnetâs fall?
Answer: The falling magnet is inducing currents and magnetism in the surface. In accordance with
Lenzâs law, that induced magnetism opposes the change that produces it; it acts to slow the magnetâs
descent.
Why: A strong magnet induces such powerful magnetic opposition in a good conductor that moving
the magnet is difficult. This effect is most evident with a superconductor, that is, a material that
conducts electricity perfectly and can sustain induced currents forever. A superconductor can slow a
falling magnet to a stop and hold it suspended indefinitely (Fig. 11.2.1).

Answer: The field contains about 640,000 J.
Why: Since 1 T is equivalent to 1 N/AÂˇm, Eq. 11.2.2 gives us the energy of a 4-T field occupying
0.1 m3 as:
energy =

(4 N/A Âˇ m) 2 Âˇ 0 .1 m3
2 Âˇ (4Ď Ă 10 â7 N/A2 )

= 640,000 N Âˇ m = 640,000 J.

Two Coils Together: A Transformer
A single coil experiences only self-inductance. Any energy removed from the coilâs current by its induced emf must eventually be returned to that same current; it has nowhere
else to go. But when two coils share the same electromagnetic environment, they experience mutual inductance and can exchange energy via magnetic induction. Energy removed
from one coilâs current by its induced emf can be given to the other coilâs current by its
induced emf.
That possibility is the basis for a transformer, a device that transfers electric power
from one circuit to another. In its simplest form, a transformer consists of two coils, primary and secondary, wrapped around a magnetizable core that enhances magnetic induction and allows them to share the same electromagnetic environment. When alternating
current flows through the primary coil, it produces an induced electric field that affects both
coils and both coils develop induced emfs. The induced emf in the primary coil removes
energy from its alternating current while the induced emf in the secondary coil gives that
energy to its alternating current.
Iâll explain how this energy transfer works by starting with the transformer shown in
Fig. 11.2.7a. A generator provides its primary coil with 120-V AC electric power, while its
secondary coil is an open circuit.
With the generator subjecting the primary coil to an alternating voltage difference, the
primary coil behaves like an inductor. It carries an alternating current and develops an
induced emf that exactly matches the voltage difference imposed by the generator. Although
the coilâs current naturally tries to flow from higher voltage to lower voltage, the coilâs
self-inductance opposes current changes and delays the currentâs response. As a result, the
coilâs alternating current lags a quarter of an AC cycle or 90 degrees in phase behind the
coilâs alternating voltage difference.
Because of its 90-degree phase lag, this alternating current conveys no average power
from the generator to the primary coil. Nonetheless, it plays an important role in the transformer: it alternately magnetizes and demagnetizes the transformerâs core and thereby
produces the induced emfs in both coils. For that reason, it is known as the magnetizing
current.
The transformerâs secondary coil is identical to its primary coil, except for being
upside down on the right side of the magnetizable core. The secondary coilâs induced emf
is therefore identical to that of the primary coil, except for being upside down. Though itâs
an open circuit and canât carry a significant current, the secondary coil has a voltage
difference across it due to the induced emf and it can thus act as a source of 120-V AC
electric power!
In Fig. 11.2.7b, the transformerâs secondary is connected to a lightbulb. Because the
lightbulbâs filament obeys Ohmâs law, its current remains proportional to the voltage difference across it, even if that voltage difference alternates. With the secondary coil imposing
an alternating voltage difference on the filament, that filament carries an alternating current

that is synchronized with the voltage difference. That current always flows toward lower
voltage in the filament, dropping off energy, and toward higher voltage in the secondary
coil, picking up energy. Provided with 120-V AC power by the secondary coil, this particular lightbulb filament carries an AC current of 1 A.
The current that is now flowing through the secondary coil has its own magnetic effect
on the transformer. Fortunately, that effect is surprisingly simple: it causes an additional
current to flow through the primary coil.
Known as the load current, this additional current shares the same conducting path as
the magnetizing current, like two fleets of cars sharing the same two-lane road. Unlike the
magnetizing current, however, the load current is synchronized with the voltage difference
across the primary coil and its two effects are different. It produces a magnetic field that
exactly cancels the magnetic field of the secondary current and it conveys electric power
from the generator to the primary coil.
Iâll start with the magnetic cancellation. When a current travels in a circle, the magnetic
field inside the circle is proportional to the current. A wire coil guides its current in a circle
multiple times, effectively multiplying that current by the number of turns in the coil.
The magnetic field inside a coil of wire is thus proportional to the current in the wire times
the number of turns in the coil.

CHAPT ER 11 Magnetism and Electrodynamics

Since the transformerâs primary and secondary coils are identical, they have the same
number of turns. If the currents in those two coils are equal in amount but opposite in direction, their magnetic fields will cancel.
The transformer naturally adjusts its load current to achieve that magnetic cancellation. Since the secondary coil has a 1-A alternating current flowing through it toward higher
voltage, the primary coil acquires a 1-A alternating load current flowing through it toward
lower voltage. Their magnetic fields cancel perfectly, leaving the magnetizing current
solely responsible for the transformerâs magnetic field and its induced emfs.
Because the coils are identical, their induced emfs are both 120-V AC. The negative
work that the primary coilâs induced emf does on its 1-A current is therefore equal in
amount to the positive work that the secondary coilâs induced emf does on its 1-A current.
Overall, the transformer is transferring an AC power of 120 W from the current in its primary circuit to the current in its secondary circuit.
To maintain their magnetic cancellation, the load current automatically mirrors any
changes in the secondary current. For example, if we add a second lightbulb to the secondary circuit and thereby double the current in the secondary coil, the load current will also
double. Because of this mirroring effect, the transformer always consumes as much power
from its primary circuit as is consumed by its secondary circuit.
Check Your Understanding #5: Use Only with AC Power
If you send direct current through the primary coil of a transformer, no power will be transferred to
the secondary circuit. Explain.
Answer: When direct current flows through the transformerâs primary coil, it creates a constant magnetic field around the iron core. Since that field doesnât change, it doesnât create any electric fields
and doesnât induce current in the transformerâs secondary coil.
Why: The current through the primary coil must change so that the magnetic field in the coils will
change and current will be induced in the secondary coil. Transferring power from one circuit to
another is so useful that there are many DC-powered devices that switch their power on and off to
mimic alternating current so that they can use transformers.

Changing Voltages
When a source of AC electric power is connected to a transformerâs primary coil, the transformerâs primary and secondary coils both develop induced emfs. If the secondary coil is
identical to the primary coil (Fig. 11.2.7), their induced emfs are equal and the secondary
coil becomes a source of AC power at the same voltage as that received by the primary coil.
For example, if you plug the transformerâs primary coil into a 120-V AC outlet, its secondary coil will provide 120-V AC electric power to the secondary circuit.
A transformer with identical coils is known as an isolation transformer and it provides an
important measure of electrical safety. Since its primary and secondary circuits are electrically
isolated, charge canât move between those circuits and cause trouble. For example, when lightning strikes the power companyâs wires, the resulting burst of charge on the primary circuit
canât pass to any appliances or instruments that are part of the secondary circuit. Not surprisingly, hospitals often employ isolation transformers to protect patients from shocks.
Most transformers, however, have unequal coils and therefore different induced emfs
in those coils. They provide AC power at voltages that are different from those they receive.
The primary coilâs induced emf naturally matches the voltage difference applied to it,
but the secondary coilâs emf can vary. It depends on the number of secondary turnsâthe
number of times the secondary coilâs wire encircles the magnetizable core. The more loops
the secondary current makes around the core, the more positive or negative work the transformerâs induced electric field does on that current and the larger the secondary coilâs
induced emf.

Since the secondary coilâs induced emf is proportional to its number of turns, it acts as
a source of AC power with a voltage equal to the voltage applied to the primary coil times
the ratio of secondary turns to primary turns, or
secondary voltage = primary volatge Âˇ

secondary turns
primary turns

(11.2.3)

An isolation transformer is simply the special case in which the turn numbers are equal
and their ratio is 1.
When a transformer has fewer secondary turns than primary turns (Fig. 11.2.8), it
provides a secondary voltage that is less than the primary voltage and is called a step-down
transformer. Step-down transformers are common in electronic devices and power adapters, where they step household AC voltages down to much smaller AC voltages. For example, if a transformerâs ratio of secondary turns to primary turns is 0.1 and you supply 120-V
AC power to its primary coil, its secondary coil will act as a source of 12-V AC power.
Not surprisingly, there are also step-up transformers that have more secondary turns than
primary turns and that provide secondary voltages that are greater than their primary voltages
(Fig. 11.2.9). The transformer that powers a neon sign typically has 100 times as many turns
in its secondary coil as in its primary coil. When its primary coil is supplied by 120-V AC
power, its secondary coil provides the 12,000-V AC power needed to illuminate the neon tube.
Even when a transformer has unequal coils, the magnetic fields produced by the load
current in its primary coil and the secondary current in its secondary coil must still cancel.
Since each coilâs magnetic field is proportional to its current times its number of turns, the
coil with fewer turns must compensate by carrying a larger current. As a result, a transformerâs secondary current is equal to its primary load current times the ratio of primary turns
to secondary turns, or
secondary current = primary load current Âˇ

primary turns
,

where those currents flow in opposite directions; the primary load current flows toward
lower voltage in the primary coil while the secondary current flows toward higher voltage
in the secondary coil.
As you can see, changing a transformerâs ratio of secondary turns to primary turns
affects both the voltage and the current in the secondary circuit. The secondary voltage is
proportional to that ratio, while the secondary current is inversely proportional to that ratio.

The product of those two quantities, secondary voltage and secondary current, no longer depends on the turn ratio and itâs the power provided to the secondary circuit. Itâs also
equal to the primary voltage times the primary load current, which is the power received
from the primary circuit. The transformer is providing the same power to its secondary
circuit as itâs receiving from its primary circuit!
With that in mind, we can look again at the three types of transformers. An isolation
transformer (Fig. 11.2.7) transfers AC power without any change in voltage or current; the
secondary circuit has the same voltage and the same current as in the primary circuit. With
a step-down transformer (Fig. 11.2.8), the secondary circuit has a smaller voltage and a
larger current than in the primary circuit. With a step-up transformer (Fig. 11.2.9), the
secondary circuit has a larger voltage and a smaller current than in the primary circuit.
Check Your Understanding #6: Travel Trouble
Your portable lava lamp operates on 120-V AC power, but youâre visiting a country with 240-V AC
power. You plug a travel adapter into the 240-V AC outlet and its transformer provides your lamp with
the 120-V AC power it expects. Compare the numbers of turns in the transformerâs two coils.
Answer: The transformerâs secondary coil has half as many turns as its primary coil.
Why: To step down the voltage, a transformer must have fewer turns in its secondary coil than in its
primary coil. Fewer turns leads to a smaller emf in the secondary coil and a smaller output voltage
for the transformer.

Real Transformers: Not Quite Perfect
Although weâve been pretending that inductors and transformers are flawless and that their
wires conduct electricity perfectly, thatâs not quite true. In reality, the wires used in those
devices have electrical resistances and waste power in proportion to the squares of the
currents they carry. To minimize this wasted power, real inductors and transformers are
designed to minimize their resistances. To the extent it is practical, they employ thick wires
made of highly conducting metals and those wires are kept as short as possible.
Unfortunately, inductors and transformers built from wires alone canât develop strong
magnetic fields and large induced emfs unless they carry large magnetizing currents or
have long, many-turn coils. To avoid those current or coil problems, many inductors and
virtually all transformers wrap their coils around magnetizable cores. Those cores respond
magnetically to the alternating currents around them, enhancing their magnetic fields

Electric Power Distribution

and increasing the induced emfs. Aided by those magnetizable materialsâtypically iron or
iron alloysâcored inductors and transformers work well even with short, few-turn coils.
A core provides another crucial benefit to a transformer; it guides the transformerâs
magnetic flux lines so that nearly all of them pass through both coils, even when those coils
are somewhat separated in space. Sharing their flux lines in that manner gives the coils a
common electromagnetic environment and permits them to exchange electric power easily.
Making two separate coils share their flux lines isnât easy. Since a coil has no net magnetic pole, each flux line that emerges from it must ultimately return to it. Without a core,
however, most flux lines leaving a coil return to it almost directly and remain nearby
throughout their trip. Those unadventurous flux lines are unlikely to pass through a second,
separate coil. Not surprisingly, a coreless transformer works well only when its two coils
are wound so closely together that they canât help but share the same flux lines.
Winding both coils around a ring-shaped magnetic core makes it easy for the flux lines
to pass through both coils because those flux lines are drawn into the coreâs soft magnetic
material and follow it as if in a pipe. Although the flux lines leaving a coil must still return
to it eventually, most of them complete that trip by way of the coreâa journey that then
takes them through the other coil. With nearly all the flux lines channeled by the core
through both coils, power can flow easily from one coil to the other.
A core thus provides a transformer with great flexibility; its coils can be practically
anywhere as long as they encircle that core. However, cores arenât quite perfect pipes for
flux; they leak slightly. Therefore, the most efficient transformers have coils that are wound
nearby or on top of one another.
Although magnetizable cores make small efficient transformers practical, they also
introduce a few problems. First, the cores must magnetize and demagnetize easily to keep
up with the magnetizing current in the primary coil. If they lag behind, theyâll waste power
as thermal power. Sadly, perfect magnetic softness is unobtainable and all cores waste at
least a little power through delays in their magnetizations.
Second, because these cores are subject to the same electric fields that push currents
around in the coils, they shouldnât conduct electricity. If they do, theyâll develop useless
internal currents known as eddy currents and thereby waste power heating themselves up.
Since most soft magnetic materials are electrical conductors, transformer cores are frequently divided up into insulated particles or sheets so that little or no current can flow
through them. Despite best efforts at minimizing resistive heating in their coils, and magnetization and eddy current losses in their cores, all transformers still waste some power.
Even the best transformers are only about 99% energy efficient.
Check Your Understanding #7: Winds of Change
Large power transformers have cooling fins and often fans to blow air across them. Why does a transformer need this cooling?
Answer: Its magnetic core converts some of the electric power into thermal power. Unless that thermal power is eliminated, the transformer will overheat.
Why: Transformers arenât perfectly energy efficient; they convert a small fraction of the electric power
they handle into thermal power. Their magnetic cores contribute to that inefficiency because their
limited magnetic softness and electric conductivity cause them to heat up. Fins and fans are essential for keeping large transformers cool.

Alternating Current Power Distribution
Weâre finally prepared to deal with the basic conflicts of power transmission. To minimize
resistive heating in the power lines connecting a power plant with a distant city, electric
power should travel through those lines as small currents at very high voltages. To be practical, though, as well as to avoid shock and fire hazard, electric power should be delivered
to homes as large currents at modest voltages.

circuits used in this delivery system are electrical insulated from one another.

Although there is no simple way to meet both requirements simultaneously with direct
current, transformers make it easy to satisfy them both with alternating current. We can use
a step-up transformer to produce the very-high-voltage AC electric power suitable for
cross-country transmission and a step-down transformer to produce the low-voltage AC
electric power thatâs appropriate for delivery to communities (Fig. 11.2.10).

primary circuit, but the voltage supplied by the secondary coil is much higher, typically
about 500,000 V AC.
This transformerâs secondary circuit is extremely long, extending all the way to the
city where the power is to be used. Since the current in this circuit is modest, the power
wasted in heating the wires is within tolerable limits.
Once it arrives in the city, this very-high-voltage AC electric power passes through the
primary coil of a step-down transformer (Fig. 11.2.11). The voltage provided by the secondary coil of this transformer is only about 1/100 the voltage supplied to its primary coil,
but the current flowing through the secondary circuit is about 100 times the current in its
primary circuit.
Now the voltage is reasonable for use in a city. Before entering homes, this voltage is
reduced still further by other transformers. The final step-down transformers can frequently
be seen as oil-drum-size metal cans hanging from utility poles (Fig. 11.2.12) or as green
metal boxes on the ground (Fig. 11.2.13). Current enters the buildings at between 110 and
240 V AC, depending on the local standards. Although 240-V AC electricity wastes less
power in home wiring, itâs more dangerous than 110-V AC power. The United States has
adopted a 120-V AC standard, and Europe has a 230-V AC standard.

Check Your Understanding #8: High-Voltage Wires
If a power utility were able to increase the voltage of its transmission line from 500,000 to 1,000,000 V,
how would that affect the power lost to heat in the wires?
Answer: It would reduce the amount of heat produced to only 25% of the previous value.
Why: At 1,000,000 V, the transmission line would be able to carry the same power as a 500,000-V
transmission line with only half the current. Since the power wasted by the transmission line itself is
proportional to the square of the current, halving the current would reduce the power waste to 25%.

AC Electric Generators and Motors
As weâve seen, a transformer âconvertsâ electric power into electric powerâit extracts
electric power from a primary circuit and delivers electric power to a secondary circuit.
However, electric power and mechanical power are physically equivalent, and mechanical
power can substitute for electric power. What if we replace one of the electric circuits in a
transformer with a mechanical system?
If we replace the transformerâs primary circuit with a mechanical system, we obtain a
generator. A generator is a device that extracts mechanical power from machinery and
delivers electric power to a circuit. Figure 11.2.14a shows a simple generator, one that

looks strikingly like the transformer in Fig. 11.2.7. Both devices have a (secondary) coil
wrapped around a magnetizable core. However, in place of the transformerâs primary coil,
the generator has a spinning magnet, or rotor. As the generatorâs magnetic rotor spins, it
produces a sinusoidally alternating magnetic field in the core. This alternating magnetic
field, in turn, produces an alternating electric field and an alternating induced emf in the
coil. That emf propels an alternating current through the circuit that delivers electric power
to the lightbulb.
The current in the generatorâs coil has consequences for its rotor. The rotor turns
slightly ahead of the generatorâs alternating magnetic field, so that the rotorâs magnetic
field cancels the currentâs magnetic field. Because the rotor is a little ahead the generatorâs
alternating magnetic field, it experiences a backward torque and has mechanical power
extracted from it. To keep the rotor spinning, the machinery must continue to supply
mechanical power to the generator. Overall, the generator is converting mechanical power
into electric power.
If we replace the transformerâs secondary circuit with a mechanical system, we obtain
a motor. A motor is a device that extracts electric power from a circuit and delivers mechanical power to machinery. Figure 11.2.14b shows a simple motor, one that again resembles
the transformer in Fig. 11.2.7. Like the transformer, the motor has a (primary) coil wrapped
around a magnetizable core. In place of the transformerâs secondary coil, however, the
motor has a spinning magnetic rotor. As an alternating current flows through the motorâs
circuit and coil, it produces a sinusoidally alternating magnetic field in the coil. That alternating magnetic field interacts with the magnetic rotor and delivers mechanical power to it.
The rotorâs motion has consequences for the current in the motorâs coil. If the rotor is
spinning freely and remains perfectly synchronized with the coreâs alternating magnetic
field, it has no effect on the coreâs magnetic field or the current in the coil. If the rotor is
doing mechanical work, however, it needs a forward torque to keep it spinning and it
obtains that torque by turning slightly behind the motorâs alternating magnetic field. The
rotorâs magnetic field then causes a load current to flow through the motorâs coil. That load
current delivers power to the motor and its magnetic field cancels the rotorâs magnetic field.
Overall, the motor is converting electric power into mechanical power.
Notice that Figs. 11.2.14a and 11.2.14b are almost mirror images of one another.
Thatâs because generators and motors are wonderfully similar devices. In fact, a single
device can often act as either a generator or a motor. If you supply electric power to its
circuit, its rotor will spin and provide mechanical power. If you supply mechanical power
to its rotor, current will flow through its circuit and provide electric power.

When you pedal a high-tech exercise bicycle, you are probably spinning the rotor of an electric generator. That generator supplies power to a heating filament with an adjustable electrical resistance.
How should the bicycle alter that electrical resistance to make pedaling more difficult?
Answer: It should reduce the heaterâs resistance.
Why: By lowering the heaterâs resistance, the bicycle increases the current flowing through the circuit. That increased current carries more power from the generator to the heater, so the generator
extracts more mechanical work from the bicyclist.

In this chapter, we studied magnetism and the ways in which magnetism relates to electricity. In Household Magnets, we looked at the concept of magnetic pole and the attractive or
repulsive forces that poles exert on one another. We examined magnetic materials and saw
how their magnetic properties make them useful for various purposes. We also encountered
electromagnets and began to see that magnetism isnât independent of electricity. In Electric

Power Distribution, we saw how alternating electric currents make it possible to transfer
power from one circuit to another by way of a transformer and its electromagnetic properties. We learned that transforming electric power to extremely high voltages and small
currents minimizes the power wasted between power plants and cities.

Explanation: A Nail and Wire Electromagnet
When you connect the wire from one terminal of the battery to the other, a current flows
from the positive terminal to the negative terminal through the wire. (In reality, negatively
charged electrons move from the batteryâs negative terminal, through the wire, to its positive terminal, but weâve adopted a fiction that positive charges are heading the other way.)
This current produces a magnetic field around the wire. Because the wire is coiled around
the nail, this magnetic field passes through the nail and causes its magnetic domains to
resize until most of them are aligned with the field. Without any current in the wire, the
magnetic domains in the steel point in many different directions, so the nail appears nonmagnetic. However, with the current orienting the domains, they together produce a large
magnetization. The nail becomes magnetic and exerts strong magnetic forces on other
nearby objects.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Household Magnets Work: Common refrigerator magnets are composed of hard magnetic materials that were permanently magnetized by their manufacturers. Simple button
magnets have a single pair of magnetic poles, one north and one south, but plastic sheet
magnets usually have many poles. These magnets stick to a refrigeratorâs surface by temporarily magnetizing that surfaceâs soft magnetic materials and then becoming attracted to the
opposite poles on that surface.
A compass is another permanent magnet, but one designed to align with Earthâs magnetic field. In fact, that magnetic field can be mapped out using a compass. The magnetic
fields around smaller magnets can be made visible with iron filings instead. However, permanent magnets arenât the only sources of magnetic fields; we found that when current flows
through the coil in a doorbell, it becomes a magnet as wellâan electromagnet.
How Electric Power Distribution Works: To minimize power losses in the transmission lines
between power plants and cities, power distribution systems use alternating currents and
transformers. Near the power plant, relatively low-voltage, high-current electric power is transformed into very-high-voltage, low-current power for transmission through cross-country power
lines. Because the power consumed by these high-voltage wires depends on the square of the
currents they carry, the power losses are greatly reduced by this technique. When the power
arrives at a city, itâs transformed into medium-voltage, high-current power for distribution to
neighborhoods. Finally, in neighborhoods, step-down transformers transform this power to

Electromagnetic Waves
lectric and magnetic fields are so intimately related that each can create the other even in
empty space. In fact, the two fields can form electromagnetic waves, in which they recreate
one another endlessly and head off across space at an enormous speed. These electromagnetic waves are all around us and are the basis for much of our communications technology, for
radiative heat transfer, and for our ability to see the universe in which we live.

EXPERIMENTS

A Disc in the Microwave Oven
exposed to the microwave electric fields in the oven, that
metal will carry large currents, heat up, tear, and spark.
To perform the experiment, youâll need a CD or DVD
that you are comfortable destroying. Place a microwave-safe
ceramic mug near the center of the microwave oven. Lean
the CD or DVD against the mug so that you can see the
discâs shiny face through the oven door. If the oven has a
rotating tray, you may want to remove that tray temporarily
for the experiment. You may also want to block the ovenâs
light temporarily with black tape. Be sure that you replace
the tray and unblock the light when youâre done.
Close the oven door, and check that you can see the
shiny surface of the CD or DVD clearly. Now prepare to
turn the microwave oven on for no more than 4 s. You
should know what to expect: 2 s during which the oven
will build up its microwave power and 2 s during which
the discâs metal layer will spark wildly.
When youâre prepared and everything is safely
arranged, turn the oven on for 4 s. You should see lots of
sparking in that metal layer. Even if you donât, turn the
oven off after 4 s or the overheated plastic smell will
become a serious problem. Let the disc cool and the smell
dissipate. Discard the disc safely.

You can experiment with electromagnetic waves using a
microwave oven. As weâll see in Section 12.2, microwaves
are a type of electromagnetic wave that falls between radio
waves and light. Because electromagnetic waves consist
of electric and magnetic fields, they can propel electric
currents through metal objects. Those currents can do
some interesting things.
In this experiment, youâll put metal in a microwave
oven. There is always some risk associated with this
activity, so if you cannot fully accept that risk yourself,
skip this experiment and look at the photographs instead.
If youâre young enough to require adult supervision or
consent, obtain it or skip the experiment.
If you choose to conduct this experiment, make sure
that there is nothing flammable in or near the oven and
that the area around you is well ventilated. The plastic in
the disc will heat up and release a mildly unpleasant smell
that will dissipate. Do not leave the oven on for more than
4 s or that smell will become truly unpleasant.
The metal for this experiment is the ultrathin reflective film located inside a CD or DVD. Although that metal
layerâs electrical conductivity makes it reflective, it
wasnât designed to carry large electric currents. When

charge moving in an antenna can emit or respond to electromagnetic waves and how those waves can be controlled to send sound
information from a radio transmitter to a radio receiver. In Microwave

A fluctuating electric current can represent sound information,
and thatâs what it does each time you speak into a microphone
or listen to music through earphones. Currents need wires,
however, so how can we send sound information to someone
who is moving? We need a way to represent sound that doesnât
involve wires. We need radio.

This section describes how radio works. Weâll look at how
radio waves are transmitted and how theyâre received. Weâll also
examine the common ways in which sound is represented by radio
waves so that it can travel through space to a receiver far away.
Questions to Think About: How might the movement of electric charge in one metal antenna affect electric charge in a
second antenna nearby? What about when the second antenna
is far away from the first antenna? What does it mean when a
radio station claims to transmit 50,000 W? How does your
radio select one channel from among all the possibilities?
Experiments to Do: Listen to a small AM radio and notice that
the volume of the sound depends on the radioâs orientation or
location. Radio waves are pushing electric charges back and
forth along the radioâs hidden internal antenna. You can sometimes find an orientation in which the radio is silent because
in that orientation the radio waves are unable to move charges
along the antenna. If you put the radio inside a metal box, it
will also become silent. Can you explain why?
You can try similar experiments with a cordless telephoneâ
actually a radio transmitter and receiver. See how far you can
go with the handset before you lose contact with the base unit.
Notice that the antennaâs size and orientation affect its range.
What happens to the reception if you stand behind a large
metal object?

A Prelude to Radio Waves
Before we can examine radio and radio waves, letâs take a moment to finish the introduction to electrodynamics that we began in Chapters 10 and 11. Although weâve already
learned most of the fundamental relationships between electricity and magnetism, the
remaining one is about to become important. To refresh your memory, we have observed so
far that electric fields can be produced by electric charges, subatomic particles, and changing magnetic fields and that magnetic fields can be produced by subatomic particles and

moving electric charges (Table 12.1.1). If isolated magnetic poles exist, they produce magnetic fields and, when moving, electric fields.
In 1865, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831â1879) discovered one additional source of magnetic fields: changing electric fields. That effect is subtle and scientists
overlooked it for most of the nineteenth century. It wasnât until Maxwell was trying to
formulate a complete electromagnetic theory that he uncovered this additional connection
between electricity and magnetism. This final relationship completed the set shown in
Table 12.1.1. Taken together, these relationships allowed Maxwell to understand one of the
most remarkable phenomena in natureâelectromagnetic waves!

THIRD CONNECTION BETWEEN ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
Electric fields that change with time produce magnetic fields.

Since electric fields can create magnetic fields and magnetic fields contain energy, itâs
clear that electric fields must contain energy, too. The amount of energy in a uniform electric field is the square of the field strength times the volume of the field divided by 8Ď times
the Coulomb constant. We can write this relationship as a word equation:
energy =

electric field2 Âˇ volume

8Ď Âˇ Coulomb constant

(12.1.1)

in symbols:
U=

E2 Âˇ V
,
8Ď Âˇ k

and in everyday language:
When you charge a large capacitor, it stores a great deal of energy in the electric
field between its plates.
With these observations, we have finished the prelude and are ready to see how radio
works.

Check Your Understanding #1: A Real Flux Capacitor
When a capacitor has separated charge on its plates, there is a strong electric field between
those plates. Connecting the plates with a wire will discharge the capacitor, and its electric field
will suddenly vanish. As the electric field disappears, what other field is present between the
plates?
Answer: There is now a magnetic field between the plates.
Why: Since a changing electric field produces a magnetic field, the plates have a magnetic field
between them while their electric field is disappearing.

Radio

Check Your Figures #1: Lightning in the Fields
During a thunderstorm, the charged clouds produce an electric field of about 10,000 V/m near the
ground. How much energy is contained in 1.0 cubic meter of that electric field?
Answer: The electric field in 1.0 m3 is about 0.00045 J.
Why: Since 10,000 V/m is equivalent to 10,000 J/C Âˇ m, Eq. 12.1.1 gives us the energy of a 10,000 V/m
field occupying 1.0 m3 as:

While that isnât much energy per cubic meter, a single lightning strike may release the electric field
energy in almost a billion cubic meters. No wonder it produces such a bang!

Antennas and Tank Circuits
A radio transmitter communicates with a receiver via radio waves. These waves are produced by electric charge as it moves up and down the transmitterâs antenna and are detected
when they push electric charge up and down the receiverâs antenna. What exactly are radio
waves, and how does charge on the antenna produce them?
Weâve already seen that electric charge produces electric fields and that moving charge
produces magnetic fields. However, something new happens when charge accelerates.
Accelerating charge produces a mixture of changing electric and magnetic fields that can
reproduce one another endlessly and travel long distances through empty space. These
interwoven electric and magnetic fields are known generally as electromagnetic waves. In
the case of radio, the electromagnetic waves have low frequencies and long wavelengths,
and are known as radio waves.
Before we look at the structure of a radio wave and at how it travels through space,
letâs start with a much simpler situation. Weâll look at how two nearby metal antennas
affect one another. Figure 12.1.1 shows a radio transmitter and a radio receiver, side by
side. Because of their proximity, electric charge on the transmitterâs antenna is sure to
affect charge on the receiverâs antenna.
To communicate with the nearby receiver, the transmitter sends charge up and down its
antenna. This chargeâs electric field surrounds the transmitting antenna and extends all the
way to the receiving antenna, where it pushes charge down and up. Unfortunately, the
resulting charge motion in the receiving antenna is weak and the receiver may have difficulty distinguishing it from random thermal motion or from motion caused by other electric fields in the environment. Therefore the transmitter adopts a clever strategyâit moves
charge up and down its antenna rhythmically at a particular frequency. Since the resulting
motion on the receiving antenna is rhythmic at that same frequency, itâs much easier for the
receiver to distinguish from unrelated motion.

Fig. 12.1.2 A tank circuit
is an electromagnetic
harmonic oscillator
consisting of a capacitor
and an inductor. This
sequence shows half a cycle
of its oscillation at five
equally spaced moments
in time. Energy sloshes
rhythmically back and forth
between the capacitorâs
electric field and the
inductorâs magnetic field.

Using this rhythmic motion has another advantage: it allows the transmitter and
receiver to use tank circuits, resonant electronic devices consisting only of capacitors and
inductors (Fig. 12.1.2). Charge can âsloshâ back and forth through a tank circuit at a particular frequency, much as water can slosh back and forth in a water storage tank at a particular frequency (see Fig. 9.3.4). Just as you can get the water sloshing strongly by giving
it gentle pushes that are synchronized with its rhythmic motion, so the transmitter can get
charge sloshing strongly through its tank circuit by giving that charge gentle pushes that are
synchronized with its rhythmic motion. Both are examples of resonant energy transfer (see
Section 9.2). By helping the transmitter move larger amounts of charge up and down the
antenna, the tank circuit dramatically strengthens the transmission.
A second tank circuit attached to the receiving antenna helps the receiver detect this
transmission. Gentle, rhythmic pushes by fields from the transmitting antenna cause more
and more charge to move through the receiving antenna and its attached tank circuit. While
the motion of charge on this antenna alone may be difficult to detect, the much larger
charge sloshing in the tank circuit is unmistakable.
We can understand how a tank circuit works by looking at how charge moves between
its capacitor and its inductor. Letâs imagine that the tank circuit starts out with separated
charge on the plates of its capacitor (Fig. 12.1.2a). Since the inductor conducts electricity,
current begins to flow from the positively charged plate, through the inductor, to the negatively charged plate. The current through the inductor must rise slowly and, as it does, it
creates a magnetic field in the inductor (Fig. 12.1.2b).
Soon the capacitorâs separated charge is gone and all the tank circuitâs energy is stored
in the inductorâs magnetic field (Fig. 12.1.2c). However, the current keeps flowing, driven
forward by the inductorâs opposition to current changes. The inductor uses the energy in its
magnetic field to keep the current flowing, and separated charge reappears in the capacitor
(Fig. 12.1.2d). Eventually, the inductorâs magnetic field decreases to zero and everything is
back to its original stateâalmost. While all the tank circuitâs energy has returned to the
capacitor, the separated charge in that capacitor is now upside down (Fig. 12.1.2e).
This whole process now repeats in reverse. The current flows backward through the
inductor, magnetizing it upside down, and the tank circuit soon returns to its original state.
This cycle repeats over and over again, with charge sloshing from one side of the capacitor
to the other and back again.
A tank circuit is an electronic harmonic oscillator, equivalent to the mechanical harmonic oscillators we examined in Chapter 9. Like all harmonic oscillators, its period (the
time per cycle) doesnât depend on the amplitude of its oscillation. Thus, no matter how
much charge is sloshing in the tank circuit, the time it takes that charge to flow over and
back is always the same.
The tank circuitâs period depends only on its capacitor and its inductor. The larger the
capacitorâs capacitance, the more separated charge it can hold with a given amount of
energy and the longer it takes that charge to move through the circuit as current. The larger
the inductorâs inductance, its opposition to current changes, the longer that current takes
to start and stop. A tank circuit with a large capacitor and a large inductor may have a
period of a thousandth of a second or more, while one with a small capacitor and a small
inductor may have a period of a billionth of a second or less.
Inductance is defined as the voltage drop across the inductor divided by the rate at
which current through the inductor changes with time. This division gives inductance the
units of voltage divided by current per time. The SI unit of inductance is the volt-second
per ampere, also called the henry (abbreviated H). While large electromagnets have inductances of hundreds of henries, a 1-ÎźH (0.000001-H) inductor is more common in radio.
Its resonant behavior makes the tank circuit useful in radio. Thatâs because small,
rhythmic pushes on the current in a tank circuit can lead to enormous charge oscillations in
that circuit. In radio, these rhythmic pushes begin when the transmitter sends an alternating
current through a coil of wire. Fields from this coil push current back and forth through the
nearby transmitting tank circuit, causing enormous amounts of charge to slosh back and

Radio

forth in it and travel up and down the transmitting antenna. That chargeâs electric field then
pushes rhythmically on charge in the receiving antenna, causing substantial amounts of
charge to travel down and up it and slosh back and forth in the receiving tank circuit. The
receiver can easily detect this sloshing charge.
Energy flows from the transmitter to the receiver via resonant energy transfer: from the
transmitter, to the transmitting tank circuit and antenna, to the receiving antenna and tank
circuit, and finally to the receiver. This sequence of transfers can work efficiently only if all
the parts have resonances at the same frequency. Tuning a radio receiver to a particular
station is largely a matter of adjusting its capacitor and inductor so that its tank circuit has
the right resonant frequency.
Check Your Understanding #2: No Tanks
Why doesnât the radio transmitter simply push electric charge directly on and off the antenna,
without using a tank circuit?
Answer: The amount of charge that the transmitter can move directly on and off the antenna is too
small to create a strong radio wave.
Why: The tank circuit is useful because it allows the transmitter to move much more charge. Just as
a tuning fork is inefficient at emitting sound waves by itself, so a radio antenna is inefficient at emitting radio waves by itself. You can make the tuning fork much louder by coupling it to an object that
resonates at its frequency. Similarly, you can make the radio antenna emit a much stronger radio
wave by coupling it to a tank circuit that resonates at its frequency.

Radio Waves
When the two antennas are close together, charge in the transmitting antenna exerts electrostatic force directly on charge in the receiving antenna. However, when the antennas are
far apart, the interactions between them are more complicated. Charge in the transmitting
antenna must then emit a radio wave to push on charge in the receiving antenna. Like a
water wave, a radio wave is a disturbance that carries energy from one place to another. But
unlike a water wave, which must travel in a fluid, a radio wave can travel through otherwise
empty space, from one side of the universe to the other.
Like all electromagnetic waves, a radio wave consists only of a changing electric field
and a changing magnetic field. These fields re-create one another over and over again as the
wave travels through empty space at the speed of lightâexactly 299,792,458 m/s (approximately 186,282 miles per second).
The radio wave is created when electric charge in the antenna accelerates. Whereas
stationary charge or a steady current produces constant electric or magnetic fields, accelerating charge produces fields that change with time. As charge flows up and down the
antenna, its electric field points in alternating directions vertically, and its magnetic field
points in alternating directions horizontally. These changing fields then re-create one
another again and again, and sail off through space as an electromagnetic wave. At each
point along its path, the waveâs electric field direction, magnetic field direction, and direction of travel are mutually perpendicular.
The wave emitted by a vertical transmitting antenna has a vertical polarization, that
is, its electric field points alternately up and down (Fig. 12.1.3a). We identify those âupsâ
as crests, and the distance between adjacent crests is its wavelength. For radio waves, that
wavelength is usually 1 m (3.3 ft) or more. The waveâs magnetic field is perpendicular to
its electric field and points in alternating directions horizontally.
Had the transmitting antenna been tipped on its side, the waveâs electric field would have
pointed in alternating directions horizontally and the wave would have had a horizontal
polarization (Fig. 12.1.4b). The waveâs magnetic field would then point alternately up and
down. Whatever the polarization, the electric and magnetic fields move forward together as a
traveling wave, so the pattern of fields moves smoothly through space at the speed of light.

COMMON M ISCON CE P T I ON S : Electromagnetic Waves and Undulations
Misconception: Since the fields of an electromagnetic wave appear wavy (Fig. 12.1.3), the light
wave itself undulates; it actually undulates up and down or back and forth as it heads rightward!
Resolution: The arrows drawn to represent the fields in an electromagnetic wave are associated
with points along the straight path of the wave. Each wave in Fig. 12.1.3 is heading directly
rightward along the yellow path and the arrows indicate field values at points along that path.

If you stood in one place and could watch this wave pass, youâd notice its electric field
fluctuating up and down at the same frequency as the charge that created it. When the wave
passes a distant receiving antenna, it pushes charge up and down that antenna at this frequency. If the receiving tank circuit is resonant at this frequency, the amount of charge
sloshing in it should become large enough for the receiver to detect.
A radio station can optimize its transmission by using a resonant transmitting antenna. A
straight antenna is another electronic harmonic oscillator, with a period that depends only on
its length. When that length is half the wavelength of the radio wave itâs transmitting, charge
sloshes up and down the antenna in a natural resonance at the frequency of the radio wave.
Surprisingly, the antenna is actually a tank circuit (Fig. 12.1.4)âits tips act as the plates
of a capacitor and its middle acts as the inductor. Despite its linear shape, the antenna has the

same resonant behavior as the coiled tank circuit shown in Fig. 12.1.2. When the transmitting tank circuit and antenna are resonant at the same frequency, thereâs a resonant energy
transfer from one to the other. These resonant effects help to produce a powerful radio wave.
Because itâs half a wavelength long and its ends are oppositely charged, this antenna is
known as a halfwave dipole antenna. Many radio stations use such antennas. Itâs possible,
however, to omit the bottom half of the dipole antenna by placing the top half above an
electrically conducting surface. The conducting surface is a mirror (Fig. 12.1.5) and its
reflection of the top half acts like the missing bottom half of the dipole antenna. Known as
a quarter-wave monopole antenna, this shorter antenna is often more convenient, particularly when the antenna projects upward from a metal surface or the ground.
The transmitting antenna sends the strongest portion of its radio wave out perpendicular to its length. Thatâs not unexpected because the motion of charge on the antenna is most
obvious when viewed from a line perpendicular to its length. Thus, a vertical antenna sends
most of its wave out horizontally, where people are likely to receive it. No wave emerges
from the end of an antenna.
Both electric and magnetic fields contain energy, so as the electromagnetic wave
travels through space, it carries energy away from the transmitter. When a radio station
advertises that it âtransmits 50,000 W of music,â itâs claiming that its antenna emits 50,000 J
of energy per second or 50,000 W of power in its electromagnetic wave. The receiving
antenna must absorb enough of this power to detect the wave. However, the farther the wave
gets from the transmitting antenna, the more spread out and weaker it becomes. Trees and
mountains also absorb or reflect some of the wave and hinder reception.
For the best reception, a listener should be located where the radio wave is strong and
where thereâs an unobstructed path from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna.
To be resonant, the receiving antenna should be a half-wave dipole or a quarter-wave
monopole, and it should be oriented along the radio waveâs polarization: vertical for a vertically polarized radio wave or horizontal for a horizontally polarized radio wave. Aligning
the receiving antenna with the waveâs polarization makes certain that the waveâs electric
field pushes charge along the antenna, not across it.
To ensure good reception regardless of receiving antenna orientation, many radio stations transmit a complicated circularly polarized wave that combines both vertical and
horizontal polarizations. To form this wave, they need several antennas. For wavelengths
under a few meters, these antennas can all be attached inexpensively to a single mast.
Thatâs why commercial FM and TV broadcasts, which use short-wavelength radio waves,
are usually transmitted with circular polarization. However, commercial AM broadcasts,
which use long-wavelength radio waves, are transmitted only with vertical polarization.
Because commercial FM radio waves usually include both polarizations, FM receiving
antennas can be vertical or horizontal. Portable FM receivers often use vertical telescoping
antennas, while home receivers frequently use horizontal wire antennas. All these antennas
are approximately half-wave dipole antennas or quarter-wave monopole antennas.
A quarter-wave monopole antenna for commercial AM radio would have to be about 100 m
(330 ft) long, so straight AM antennas (such as those on cars) are much shorter than optimal.
Thatâs why many AM antennas are designed to respond to the radio waveâs horizontal magnetic field rather than to its vertical electric field. These magnetic antennas are horizontal coils
of wire that experience induced currents when exposed to fluctuating magnetic fields.

Why do cordless telephones work only when theyâre close to their base units?
Answer: When the cordless telephone is too far from its base unit, the electromagnetic waves become
so spread out that they have trouble communicating.
Why: The powers emitted by the base unit and the handset are small, so their waves are relatively
difficult to detect. As long as the handset and base unit are close, they are able to detect each otherâs
waves. When the distance between them becomes too great, the waves become too spread out to
detect and the handset and base unit lose contact with one another.

A radio transmitter does more than simply emit a radio wave. It uses that radio wave to
represent sound. Because sound waves are fluctuations in air density and radio waves are
fluctuations in electric and magnetic fields, a radio wave canât literally âcarryâ a sound
wave. However, a radio wave can carry sound information and instruct the receiver how to
reproduce the sound.
To convey sound information, the radio station alters its radio wave to represent compressions and rarefactions of the air. The receiver then recreates those compressions and
rarefactions. There are two common techniques by which a radio wave can represent those
density fluctuations. One is called amplitude modulation and involves changing the overall
strength of the radio wave. The other is called frequency modulation and involves small
changes in the frequency of the radio wave.
In the amplitude modulation (AM) technique, air density is represented by the
strength of the transmitted wave (Fig. 12.1.6). To represent a compression of the air, the
transmitter is turned up so that more charge moves up and down the transmitting antenna.
To represent a rarefaction, the transmitter is turned down so that less charge moves up and
down the antenna. The frequency at which charge moves up and down the antenna remains
steady, so only the amplitude of the radio wave changes. The receiver measures the strength
of the radio wave and uses this measurement to re-create the sound. When it detects a
strong radio wave, it pushes its speaker toward the listener and compresses the air. When it
detects a weak radio wave, it pulls its speaker away from the listener and rarefies the air.
In the frequency modulation (FM) technique, air density is represented by the frequency of the transmitted wave (Fig. 12.1.7). To represent a compression of the air, the

transmitterâs frequency is increased slightly so that charge moves up and down the transmitting antenna a little more often than normal. To represent a rarefaction, the transmitterâs
frequency is decreased slightly so that the charge moves up and down a little less often than
normal. These changes in frequency are extremely smallâso small that charge continues
to slosh strongly in all the resonant components and reception is unaffected. The receiver
measures the radio waveâs frequency and uses this measurement to re-create the sound.
When it detects an increased frequency, it compresses the air, and when it detects a
decreased frequency, it rarefies the air.
Although the AM and FM techniques for representing sound can be used with a radio
wave at any frequency, the most common commercial bands in the United States are the
AM band between 550 kHz and 1600 kHz (550,000 Hz and 1,600,000 Hz) and the FM
band between 88 MHz and 108 MHz (88,000,000 Hz and 108,000,000 Hz). Elsewhere in
the spectrum of radio frequencies are many other commercial, military, and public transmissions, including TV, shortwave, amateur radio, telephone, data, police, and aircraft
bands. These other transmissions use AM, FM, and a few other techniques to represent
sound and information with radio waves.
Check Your Understanding #4: Another Volume Control
When you are listening to the AM radio in a car and drive through a tunnel, the volume becomes very
low. Explain.
Answer: The tunnel blocks most of the radio wave. Since only a small fluctuating wave reaches your
radio, the radio produces only small fluctuations in air density with its speaker.
Why: An AM radio has trouble distinguishing between a distant transmission representing loud music
and a nearby transmission representing soft music. In both cases, the receiver detects only small
variations in the current moving up and down its antenna. Thatâs why you must turn up the volume
of an AM radio as you move farther from the transmitting antenna or as you enter a tunnel.

Bandwidth and Cable
A pure, single-frequency radio wave doesnât carry any information. To represent sound,
video, or any other form of information, the radio wave must vary with time. Think of
smoke signalsâa steady stream of smoke carries no information, but carefully timed puffs
of smoke can send a message.
Once a radio wave is varying with time to carry information, it no longer has a single
pure frequency. Regardless of which aspects of the radio wave are varying, that wave now
includes a range of frequencies. The more information the radio wave carries each second,
the broader that range of frequencies becomes.
When itâs representing sound, a radio wave has a range of radio frequencies that
stretches from somewhat below the official frequency of the radio wave, the carrier frequency, to somewhat above that frequency. The wider the audio frequency range of the
sound, the more sound information must be sent each second and the broader the range of
radio frequencies needed to represent that sound. The range of frequencies needed to transmit such a stream of information is known as the transmissionâs bandwidth.
By international agreement, an AM radio station may use 10 kHz of bandwidth, 5 kHz
above and below its carrier frequency. To stay within that bandwidth, the sound being
represented canât contain frequencies above 5 kHz. Although this restricted frequency
range is bad for music, it allows competing stations to function with carrier frequencies
only 10 kHz apart, so 106 different stations can operate between 550 kHz and 1600 kHz.
An FM radio station may use 200 kHz of bandwidth, 100 kHz on each side of its carrier frequency. This luxurious allocation permits FM radio to represent a very broad range
of audio frequencies, in stereo, which is why an FM radio station can do a much better job
of sending music to your radio than an AM station can. In recent years, FM stations have

341

342

CHAPT ER 12 Electromagnetic Waves

begun using their 200-kHz bandwidths to carry digital information representing several
programs of âhigh-definitionâ sound. (Weâll examine digital audio in Chapter 14.)
Because high-frequency radio waves travel in straight lines between antennas, itâs hard
to receive a commercial FM station from more than about 100 km (60 mi) away. Even
when the transmitting antenna sits on top of a tall tower, Earthâs curvature and surface
terrain severely limit the range of FM reception.
Low-frequency radio waves, such as those used by commercial AM stations, are
reflected by charged particles in Earthâs outer atmosphere, so portions of the radio wave
that would otherwise be lost to space bounce back toward the ground. This returning power
allows you to receive AM stations over a considerable distance, even when you have no
direct line of sight to the transmitterâs antenna. At sundown, these atmospheric layers
become so effective at reflecting AM radio that you can hear a transmission from thousands
of kilometers away as clearly as if it were a hometown station.
The spectrum of electromagnetic waves is a limited resource, and if it could only be
used once, it would quickly run out of bandwidth. Fortunately, distance and enclosures
make it possible to reuse the spectrum many times. Cell phones that are far from one
another can share the same carrier frequencies and bandwidth because their radio waves
weaken with distance and essentially donât overlap. However, even nearby radio transmissions can use the same carrier frequencies by enclosing their electromagnetic waves
inside cables.
Cable radio, television, and data networks are similar to broadcast networks except
that they send electromagnetic waves through cables rather than through empty space. A
typical radio or television cable consists of an insulated metal wire inside a tube of metal
foil or woven metal mesh. This wire-inside-a-tube arrangement is called coaxial cable
because its two metal components share the same centerline or axis. In contrast, a typical
computer-data cable consists of a number of insulated metal wires that are twisted into
several pairs.
Electromagnetic waves can propagate easily through a coaxial or twisted-pair cable,
following its twists and turns from the transmitter that produces the waves to the receiver
that uses them. The fact that wires are assisting these waves in their travels makes them
more complicated than waves in empty space. However, they still involve electric and magnetic fields and still propagate forward at nearly the speed of light.
Because the electromagnetic waves inside a cable donât interact with those outside it,
the transmitter and receiver can use whatever parts of the spectrum they choose, without
concerns about sharing. A typical coaxial cable can handle frequencies up to about 1000 MHz
and typical twisted-pair cable can reach 350 MHz, so either one can carry a great deal of
information each second.
However, coaxial cables must now compete with optical fiber cables that guide light
from one place to another. Weâll examine optical fibers in Section 14.2. Like radio waves,
light is an electromagnetic wave and can be amplitude or frequency modulated to represent
information. However, lightâs frequency is extremely high; the frequencies of visible light
range from 4.5 Ă 1014 to 7.5 Ă 1014 Hz. If we were to allocate FM radio channels 200 kHz
apart throughout the visible spectrum, there would be about 1.5 billion channels available!

Check Your Understanding #5: Beaten by the Bandwidth
Youâre playing piano for an AM radio station, and you strike the highest key on the piano. The pitch
of the resulting sound is 4186 Hz. Can the listeners hear that note from their radios?
Answer: Yes, they can hear it, at least in principle.
Why: The bandwidth of an AM radio station extends to 5000 Hz above and below its carrier frequency, so the station is officially permitted to represent sound frequencies as high as 5000 Hz.
However, in practice the station probably begins to filter out sounds well below that frequency to
avoid accidentally violating their license.

In addition to carrying sounds from one place to another, electromagnetic waves can carry power. One interesting example of
such power transfer is a microwave oven. It uses relatively
high-frequency electromagnetic waves to transfer power
directly to the water molecules in food so that the food cooks
from the inside out. This section discusses both how those
waves are created and why they heat food.

Questions to Think About: Why do microwave ovens tend to
cook food unevenly if you donât move the food during cooking? How can part of a frozen meal become boiling hot
while another part remains frozen? Why must you be careful
with metal objects placed inside the oven? Why do some
objects remain cool in the microwave oven, while other
objects become extremely hot? How does microwave popcorn work?
Experiments to Do: A microwave oven transfers power primarily
to the water in food. You can see this effect by placing completely water-free food ingredients such as salt, baking
powder, sugar, or salad oil on a microwave-safe ceramic dish
in a microwave oven. Cook the ingredients briefly. You will find
that the ingredients and dish remain relatively cool. Add just
a little water to the collection. What happens when you cook
them this time?
Now try cooking a very cold ice cube. The cube should
come directly from the freezer on an ice-cold plate, so that its
surface is solid and dry. What happens? If ice contains water
and water is what absorbs power in a microwave oven, why
doesnât the ice absorb power and melt?

Microwaves and Food
When studying thermal radiation in Section 7.3, we discussed the wavelengths of electromagnetic waves. While examining radio, we concentrated on the frequencies of electromagnetic waves. However, we know from Eq. 9.2.1 that the wavelength and frequency of a
wave arenât independent. A basic electromagnetic wave in empty space has both a wavelength and a frequency, and their product is the speed of light. That relationship can be
written as a word equation:
speed of light = wavelength Âˇ frequency

(12.2.1)

in symbols:
c = Îť Âˇ Î˝,
and in everyday language:
The higher the frequency of an electromagnetic wave, the shorter its wavelength
becomes.
Like Fig. 7.3.2, Fig. 12.2.1 shows the approximate wavelengths of many types of electromagnetic waves, but it also shows their frequencies.
Radio broadcasts use the low-frequency, long-wavelength portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Commercial AM radio broadcasts at frequencies of 550 to 1600 kHz
(wavelengths of 545 to 187 m) and commercial FM radio broadcasts at frequencies of 88
to 108 MHz (wavelengths of 3.4 to 2.8 m). As long as their wavelengths are 1 m (3.3 ft) or
longer, electromagnetic waves are called radio waves. Electromagnetic waves that have

wavelengths of 1 mm or longer, but less than 1 m, are called microwaves. Microwave
ovens usually cook food with 0.122-m electromagnetic waves, so their name is appropriate.
To explain how a microwave oven heats food 1 , letâs begin by looking at water molecules. Water molecules are electrically polarizedâthat is, they have positively charged
ends and negatively charged ends. This polarization comes about because of quantum
physics and the tendency of oxygen atoms to pull electrons away from hydrogen atoms.
The water molecule is bent, with its two hydrogen atoms sticking up from its oxygen atom
like Mickey Mouseâs ears. When the oxygen atom pulls the electrons partly away from the
hydrogen atoms, its side of the molecule becomes negatively charged, while the hydrogen
atomsâ side becomes positively charged. Water is thus a polar molecule.
In ice, these polar water molecules are arranged in an orderly fashion with fixed positions and orientations. However, in liquid water, the molecules are more randomly oriented
(Fig. 12.2.2). Their arrangements are constrained only by their tendency to bind together,
positive end to negative end, to form a dense network of coupled molecules. This binding
between the positively charged hydrogen atom on one water molecule and the negatively
charged oxygen atom on another molecule is known as a hydrogen bond.
If you place liquid water in a strong electric field, its water molecules will tend to rotate
into alignment with the field. Thatâs because a misaligned molecule has extra electrostatic
potential energy and accelerates in the direction that reduces its potential energy as quickly as
possible. In this case, the water molecule will experience a torque and will undergo an angular acceleration that makes it rotate into alignment. As it rotates, the molecule will bump into
other molecules and convert some of its electrostatic potential energy into thermal energy.
A similar effect occurs at a crowded party when everyone is suddenly told to face the front
of the room. People brush against one another as they turn, and sliding friction converts some
of their energy into thermal energy. If the people are told to turn back and forth repeatedly, they
will become quite warm. The same holds true for water. If the electric field reverses its direction many times, the water molecules will turn back and forth and become hotter and hotter.
A microwaveâs fluctuating electric field is well suited to heating water. A microwave
oven uses 2.45-GHz (2.45-gigahertz or 2,450,000,000-Hz) microwaves to twist the foodâs
water molecules back and forth billions of times per second. As the water molecules turn,
they bump into one another and heat up. The water absorbs the microwaves and converts
their energy into thermal energy. This particular microwave frequency was chosen not
because of any resonant effect but because it was not in use for communications and because
it cooks food uniformly. If the frequency were higher, the microwaves would be absorbed
too strongly by food and wouldnât penetrate deeply into large items. If the frequency were
lower, the microwaves would pass through food too easily and wouldnât cook it efficiently.
This twisting effect explains why only foods or objects containing water or other polar
molecules cook well in a microwave oven. Microwave-safe ceramic plates, glass cups, and
plastic containers are water-free and usually remain cool. Even ice has trouble absorbing microwave power because its crystal structure constrains the water molecules so they canât turn easily.

Although ice melts slowly in a microwave oven, the liquid water it produces heats
quickly. This peculiar heating behavior explains why itâs so easy to burn yourself on frozen
food heated in a microwave oven. The portions of the food that defrost first absorb most of
the microwave power and overheat, while the rest of the food remains frozen solid. You
never know whether your next bite will break your teeth or sear the roof of your mouth. To
address this problem, many microwave ovens have defrost cycles in which microwave
heating is interrupted periodically to let heat flow naturally through the food to melt the ice.
Once the frozen parts have melted, all the food can absorb microwaves.
Check Your Understanding #1: Microwave Popcorn
A popcorn kernel contains moist starch trapped inside a hard, dry hull. You can scorch this hull by
cooking the corn in hot oil but not when you cook it in a microwave oven. How can the microwave
oven pop the corn without risk of overheating the hull?
Answer: The microwave oven transfers heat to water molecules in the starch so that the hull never
becomes hotter than the material inside it.
Why: A corn kernel cooked in oil is heated by contact with the hot oil and the pot. You can easily overheat
the outer hull and burn it. However, microwaves transfer heat to the water molecules inside the kernel.
The hull canât overheat because the hottest thing it touches is the starchy insides of the kernel. When
the pressure of steam inside the kernel becomes high enough, the hull breaks and the kernel âpops.â

Metal in a Microwave Oven
Contrary to popular lore, metal objects and microwave ovens arenât always incompatible. In fact, the walls of the ovenâs cooking chamber are metal, yet they cause no
trouble when exposed to microwaves during cooking. Like most metal surfaces, the
walls reflect microwaves. They do this by acting as both receiving and transmitting
antennas. Electric fields in the microwaves cause mobile charges in the metal surfaces
to accelerate and absorb the original microwaves. As these charges accelerate, they
emit new microwaves. The emitted microwaves have the same frequencies as the original ones, but they travel in new directions. The original microwaves have been reflected
by the surface.
The cooking-chamber walls reflect the ovenâs microwaves and keep them bouncing
around inside. Even the metal grid covering the window reflects microwaves. Thatâs
because charge has enough time during a microwave cycle to flow around each hole in the
Courtesy Lou Bloomfield
grid and compensate for the holeâs presence. As long as the wavelength of
Microwave guide
Magnetron
an electromagnetic wave is much larger than the holes in a metal grid, the
wave reflects perfectly from that grid. In fact, if thereâs nothing inside the
oven to absorb the microwaves, theyâll bounce around inside it until they
return to their source, a vacuum tube called a magnetron (Fig. 12.2.3), and
eventually cause it to overheat.
While metal surfaces help confine the microwaves inside the oven,
Fan cooking your food and not you, extra metal inside the microwave can
cause trouble. If you wrap food in aluminum foil, the foil will reflect the
microwaves and the food wonât cook. However, food placed in a shallow
metal dish cooks reasonably well because microwaves enter the open top,
pass through the food, reflect, and pass through the food again.
Sometimes metalâs mobile charges do more than just reflect microwaves. If enough charge is pushed onto the sharp point of a metal twist-tie
or scrap of aluminum foil, some of it will jump right into the air as a spark.

This spark can start a fire, particularly when the twist-tie is attached to

Resistive heating in conducting objects can actually be useful at times. Since microwave ovens cook food inside and outside at the same time, the foodâs surface never gets
particularly hot, and the food doesnât brown or become crisp. To improve their textures and
appearances, some foods come with special wrappers that conduct just enough current to
become very hot in a microwave oven. These wrappers provide the high surface temperatures needed to brown the foods.
Another peculiar feature of microwave ovens is that they donât always cook evenly.
Thatâs because the amplitude of the microwave electric field isnât uniform throughout
the oven. As the microwaves bounce around the cooking chamber, they pass through
the same spot from several different directions at once. When they do, they exhibit
interference effects (see Section 9.3). At one location, the individual electric fields may
point in the same direction and experience constructive interference so that food there
heats up quickly. At another location, however, those fields may point in opposite
directions and experience destructive interference so that food there doesnât cook well
at all.
If nothing is moving in the microwave oven, the pattern of microwaves inside it doesnât
move either. There are then regions in which the electric field has very large amplitudes and
regions in which the amplitudes are very small. The larger the amplitude of the electric
field, the faster it cooks food.
To heat food uniformly in such a microwave oven, you must move the food around as
itâs cooking. Many ovens have turntables inside that move the food automatically. Another
solution to this problem is to stir the microwaves around the oven with a rotating metal
paddle. The pattern of microwaves inside the chamber changes as the paddle turns, and the
food cooks more evenly. Still other microwave ovens use two separate microwave frequencies to cook the food. Because these two frequencies cook independently, itâs unlikely that
a portion of the food will be missed by both waves.

Check Your Understanding #2: Half and Half
You place a thick metal divider into your microwave oven so that it divides the cooking chamber
exactly in half. The oven sends its microwaves into the right half of the chamber. If you put food in
the left half of the chamber, will it cook?
Answer: No, it wonât cook.
Why: The metal divider will reflect the microwaves and keep them from entering the left half of the
oven.

Creating Microwaves with a Magnetron
Clearly, changing electric fields cook the food as microwaves bounce around the inside of
an oven. But how are these microwaves created? From the previous section on radio, you
might guess that the oven creates an alternating current at 2.45 GHz and that this current
causes charge to slosh in a tank circuit and move up and down an antenna. Thatâs pretty
much what actually happens inside a magnetron tube.
A magnetron is a special vacuum tubeâa hollow chamber from which all the air
has been removed. Composed primarily of metal and ceramic parts, the magnetron
uses beams of electrons to make charge slosh in a number of microwave tank circuits.
These tank circuits have resonant frequencies of 2.45 GHz, the operating frequency of
the oven. With the help of a tiny antenna, the magnetron emits the microwaves that
cook the food.
The microwave tank circuits are arranged in a ring around the magnetronâs evacuated chamber. For one of these tank circuits to oscillate naturally at 2.45 GHz, its
capacitor must have an extremely small capacitance and its inductor must have an

extremely small inductance. These requirements can be met by a C-shaped
strip of metal (Fig. 12.2.4). Its curve is the inductor, and its tips are the
capacitor.
Electric charge sloshes back and forth on the C-shaped strip just as it does
in a conventional tank circuit (Fig. 12.1.2). Known as a resonant cavity, this
strip is another electronic harmonic oscillator and therefore has a period that
doesnât depend on the amount of charge thatâs sloshing.
The magnetron of a microwave oven typically contains eight of these resonant cavities, each carefully adjusted in size and shape so that its natural
resonance occurs exactly at 2.45 GHz. Because these cavities are arranged in
a ring and each one shares its tips with those of its neighboring cavities, they
tend to oscillate alternately (Fig. 12.2.5). At the start of an oscillatory cycle,
half the metal tips are positively charged and half are negatively charged (Fig.
12.2.5a). Currents begin to flow through the ring and produce magnetic fields
in the resonant cavities (Fig. 12.2.5b). These magnetic fields propel the
currents around the ring even after the charge separations have vanished.
Soon the charge separations reappear but with the positive and negative tips
interchanged (Fig. 12.2.5c).

Check Your Understanding #3: Large Economy Size
If a manufacturer made a magnetron that was slightly larger than normal in every dimension, how
would that magnetron behave?
Answer: It would operate at a frequency below 2.45 GHz.
Why: The frequency of the microwaves emitted by a magnetron is determined exclusively by the
natural resonances of its cavities. If those cavities are enlarged, both the inductances of their curves
and the capacitances of their tips will increase. Their resonant frequencies will decrease, and the
magnetron will emit lower-frequency microwaves.

As currents oscillate back and forth around the cavities at 2.45 GHz, they fill the
magnetron with alternating electric and magnetic fields. However, as the energy
in these fields is extracted to cook the food or is lost to the imperfect conductivities of the cavities themselves, something must continuously replenish it. That
replacement power is supplied to the cavities by four streams of energetic
electrons.
At the center of the magnetron tube, surrounded only by empty space, is
an electrically heated cathode that tends to emit electrons (Fig. 12.2.6a). A highvoltage power supply pumps negative charge onto this cathode so that a strong
electric field points toward it from the positively charged cavity tips. If there were
no other fields present in the magnetron, negatively charged electrons would
emerge from the hot cathode and accelerate toward the positively charged tips as
four beams of electrons (Fig. 12.2.6b).
However, the magnetron also includes a large permanent magnet. Why else
would it be called a magnetron? This magnet creates a strong, steady magnetic
field that points upward along the axis of the magnetron, parallel to the cathode
itself (Fig. 12.2.6c). The purpose of this magnetic field is to alter the motions of

the electrons. An electron has an electric charge but not a magnetic pole, and a stationary
charge experiences a force from an electric field but not from a magnetic field. How then
can the magnetronâs magnetic field affect the motion of the electrons?
The key word in that last paragraph is stationary. Once a charge is moving through a
magnetic field, it does experience a forceâthe Lorentz force. Named after its discoverer,
Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853â1928), the Lorentz force affects a charge
that is moving through a magnetic field. This force pushes the charge at right angles to both
the chargeâs velocity and the magnetic field (Fig. 12.2.7). The strength of the Lorentz force
is proportional to the charge, to the velocity, to the magnetic field, and to the sine of the

on a positive charge follows a right-hand rule: when the extended index finger of your right
hand points along the chargeâs velocity and your bent middle finger points along the magnetic field, the force on the charge points along your extended thumb. A negative charge
experiences a force in the opposite direction. This relationship can be written as a word

CHAPT ER 12 Electromagnetic Waves

The Lorentz force dramatically changes the paths of electrons in the magnetron. If
there were no other fields inside the magnetron, electrons would experience only Lorentz
forces perpendicular to their velocities and would circle around the magnetic flux lines in
counterclockwise loopsâa behavior known as cyclotron motion. The circling electrons
would remain near the cathode and would never go near the cavities.
In a real magnetron, however, the electric field of Fig. 12.2.6b and the magnetic field
of Fig. 12.2.6c are present simultaneously. Because both of these fields exert forces on
moving electrons, the paths the electrons follow are extremely complicated (Fig. 12.2.6d).
The outward-directed and circulating motions merge together into four electron beams that
arc outward and rotate counterclockwise, like the spokes of a spinning bicycle wheel. An
electron beam reaches each cavity, not at its positively charge tip, as it would without the
magnetic field, but at its negatively charged tip. The electron beams actually add to the
charge separations in the cavities!
The electron beams sweep around the cathode in perfect synchronization with the
oscillating charge on the cavities. The beams sweep from one tip to the next in the same
amount of time it takes for the charge separation on the tips to reverse. As a result,
the beams always arrive on the negatively charged tip. By adding to the charge separations,
the electron beams provide power to the oscillations in the cavities, keeping them going
and allowing them to transfer power to the food. The electron beams actually initiate the
oscillation in the cavities by adding energy to tiny random oscillations that are always
present in electric systems.
How does the oscillating charge inside the magnetron create microwaves inside
the ovenâs cooking chamber? There are many ways to extract microwaves from the
ring of cavities. One extraction method is to insert a single-turn wire coil into one of
the magnetronâs cavities. As the magnetic field in that cavity changes, it induces a
2.45-GHz alternating current in the coil. One end of this coil is attached to the ring,
but the other end passes out of the magnetron through an insulated, air-tight hole in
the ring and connects to a quarter-wave monopole antenna. This 3-cm (1.2-in) antenna
emits microwaves into a metal pipe attached to the cooking chamber. These microwaves reflect their way through the pipe and into the cooking chamber, where they
cook the food.

Check Your Understanding #4: Lorentz Speaks
An ordinary audio speaker contains a wire coil immersed in a strong magnetic field. When an audio
system sends currents through the coil, the coil experiences a force proportional to that current.
What force is pushing on the coil?
Answer: The pushing force is the Lorentz force.
Why: The moving charges in the coilâs current experience the Lorentz force as they pass through the
magnetic field. This force is conveyed to the wire coil, which is attached to a movable surface. That
surface moves back and forth as the current fluctuates and produces sound. Speakers are clearly an
elegant and practical application of the Lorentz force in everyday life.

Check Your Figures #2: Lorentz Speaks with Precision
If the coil in an audio speaker experiences a Lorentz force of 1 N when it carries a current of 1 A,
what force will it experience when it carries a current of 2 A and all the charges in it are thus traveling twice as fast as before?
Answer: It will experience a force of 2 N.
Why: As indicated in Eq. 12.2.2, the Lorentz force is proportional to the velocity of a charge. Doubling the current in the coil doubles the velocities of its mobile charges, and they experience twice
the Lorentz force.

Epilogue for Chapter 12
This chapter examined two common devices that are based on electromagnetic waves.
In Radio, we saw that electromagnetic waves can be created by accelerating electric
charge and that these waves can be detected by looking for their effects on other electric
charges. We also examined the techniques that are used to send sound information
through space by having them control either the amplitude or the frequency of electromagnetic waves.
In Microwave Ovens, we explored the ways in which electromagnetic waves can
interact directly with polar water molecules and can transfer energy to those molecules.
We saw how interactions between microwaves and a metal object can lead to reflection,
sparking, or heating. We also examined the technique used in ovens to create powerful
microwave radiation.

Explanation: A Disc in the Microwave Oven
The fluctuating electric field in the microwave oven propels large currents back and forth
through the discâs metal layer. That layer is so thin that it has a large electric resistance and
it heats up as the current flows through it. The temperature of the plastic also rises because
of its intimate contact with the metal layer. Since the plastic has a larger coefficient of volume
expansion than the metal, the expanding plastic tears the metal layer and reduces it to
islands with sharp points and narrow bridges.
Once the metal layer has fragmented, the microwave-driven currents can put substantial electric charges on the sharp points. Those charges can jump between islands as sparks.
The currents passing through narrow conducting bridges can heat those bridges so hot that
their metal vaporizes and they form glowing, current-carrying plasma arcs.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Radio Works: A radio transmitter creates a radio wave when electric charge accelerates
up and down its antenna. To get as much charge moving as possible, the transmitter attaches
a tank circuit to the antenna and slowly adds energy to that tank circuit until an enormous
amount of charge is flowing up and down the antenna. If the antenna is one-quarter wavelength long, itâs also resonant at the transmission frequency and boosts the amount of charge
sloshing up and down.
The radio receiver detects this radio wave when it causes charge to accelerate up and
down the receiving antenna. If both the receiving antenna and the receiverâs tank circuit are
resonant at the transmission frequency, large amounts of charge will slosh back and forth in
the receiverâs tank circuit and the receiver will detect the transmission.
This radio wave can represent sound using either the AM or FM technique. In the
AM technique, the strength of the wave is increased or decreased to represent compressions and rarefactions of the air, respectively. In the FM technique, the precise frequency of the transmission is increased or decreased to represent those compressions
or rarefactions.
How Microwave Ovens Work: A microwave oven uses microwaves to cook food. These microwaves bounce around the cooking chamber, where they transfer energy to water molecules in
the food. Because a water molecule is polar, having a positive end and a negative end, it
tends to align with an electric field. The microwaveâs fluctuating electric field causes the
tightly packed water molecules to twist back and forth rapidly, and the ensuing collisions
heat the water and cook the food.

CHAPT ER 12 Electromagnetic Waves

The ovenâs microwaves are produced by a magnetron, a vacuum tube containing resonant cavities and a heated cathode. By combining strong electric and magnetic fields, the
magnetron produces powerful beams of electrons that add energy to the charge oscillating in
the cavities. A loop of wire and a short antenna extract power from the resonant cavities and
emit the microwaves that then cook the food.

Light

lthough radio waves and microwaves are useful for communications and energy transfer,
thereâs another portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we find far more importantâ
light. Light consists of very-high-frequency, very-short-wavelength electromagnetic waves.
Lightâs frequencies are so high that normal antennas canât handle it. Instead, itâs absorbed and
emitted by the individual charged particles in atoms, molecules, and materials. Because of its
special relationship with the charged particles in matter, light is important to physics, chemistry,
and materials science. Moreover, itâs one of the principal ways by which we interact with the world
around us.

We see light because it stimulates cells in our eyes. This
stimulation is an example of lightâs ability to influence
chemistry. And because our eyes are able to distinguish
among the different wavelengths of light, we perceive
colors. Sunlight normally appears uncolored because it
contains a rich mixture of wavelengths that our eyes
interpret as whiteness. However, there are situations in

you should see colors as well.
Turn the object slowly in your hand and observe how
the colors change. You will see gradual progressions from
one color to the next. What should that sequence of colors

be? How does this sequence relate to the colors of the rainbow? What is the relationship between this sequence and
the wavelengths of light? Can you get some sense for the
relative wavelength spacings of the classic rainbow colors:
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet?

Chapter Itinerary
In this chapter, weâll examine three sources of light: (1) sunlight,
(2) discharge lamps, and (3) LEDs and lasers. In Sunlight, we
see how sunlight travels to our eyes and how its passage through
the atmosphere, raindrops, and soap bubbles can separate it
into its constituent colors. In Discharge Lamps, we explore the
ways in which atoms and molecules emit and absorb light, and
how different atoms and molecules can be used to produce
light of different colors. In LEDs and Lasers, we look at how

electronic devices can produce light and at how atoms, molecules, and solids can duplicate or amplify the light passing
through them to produce intense beams of highly ordered light.
In the process of studying these three light sources, weâll also
learn about three different types of light: thermal light, atomic
resonance light, and coherent light. For additional preview
information, flip to the Chapter Summary and Important Laws
and Equations at the end of the chapter.

Sunlight

Red setting sun

Pool of water
Reflection of sky

For thousands of years, people have marked the passage of
time by the rising and setting of the sun over the horizon. The
sun first appears as a red disk in the east every morning, rises
white in the blue sky, and then sets once again as a red disk in
the west. The sunlight that we see takes about 8 minutes to
travel the 150,000,000 km (93,000,000 mi) from the sun to
our eyes and provides most of the energy and heat that make

life on Earth possible. Although the light in sunlight is really
just another electromagnetic wave, and could be considered
part of the previous chapter, itâs so important to everyday life
that it deserves special attention. Therefore weâll begin by looking at how sunlight interacts with our world.
Questions to Think About: Why is the sky blue during the day?
Why is the sun red at sunrise and sunset? Why do you see
rainbows only when the sun is relatively low in the sky? Why do
we see colors when sunlight passes through cut crystal or
through a soap bubble?
Experiments to Do: Sunlight is actually composed of many different electromagnetic waves. These waves differ in frequency
and wavelength like the radio waves from your two favorite stations. You donât need a machine to help you distinguish among
the various wavelengths of light; you can use your eyes. Take a
look at a soap bubble on a bright sunny day. You see the bubble
because it reflects light. In fact, the clear bubble appears
colored, even though the sunlight hitting it is white. Thatâs
because the bubble separates sunlight according to wavelength
and sends only certain wavelengths toward your eyes.

Sunlight and Electromagnetic Waves
Electromagnetic waves can have any wavelength, from thousands of kilometers to a fraction of the width of an atomic nucleus. The radio waves and microwaves that we examined
in Chapter 12 have wavelengths longer than 1 mm. In the present chapter, we turn our
attention to shorter-wavelength radiation. In particular, weâll study electromagnetic waves
with wavelengths between 400 nm and 750 nm (recall that 1 nm, or 1 nanometer, is 10â9 m).
These are the electromagnetic waves that we perceive as visible light and the principal
components of sunlight.

Why does a burning candle emit reddish or yellowish light?
Answer: Charged particles in the hot flame accelerate back and forth and emit electromagnetic waves
that include the low-frequency end of the visible spectrum.
Why: The accelerating charged particles in hot objects emit light. The hotter the object, the faster
the charged particles move and accelerate and the higher the frequencies of light they emit. A
candle isnât hot enough to emit the whitish light of the sun, so it emits mostly reddish or yellowish light.

electromagnetic waves.
Because the sunâs surface emits light through the random, thermal motions of its
charged particles, the distribution of wavelengths it emits is determined only by its
temperature. It emits a blackbody spectrum, as we discussed in Section 7.3. Because
the photosphereâs temperature is 5800 K, the jostling motions are extremely rapid
and most of the sunlight falls in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum
(Fig. 13.1.2).
However, not all sunlight is visible. On the long-wavelength, low-frequency side of
visible light is infrared light. We canât see infrared light with our eyes, but we feel it when
we stand in front of a hot object. In sunlight, infrared light is produced by charges that are
accelerating back and forth more slowly than average.
On the short-wavelength, high-frequency side of visible light is ultraviolet light.
We canât see ultraviolet light either, but weâre aware of its presence because it induces
chemical damage in molecules. It causes sunburns and encourages skin to tan. In sunlight, ultraviolet light is produced by charges that are accelerating back and forth more
rapidly than average.

CHAPT ER 13 Light

Sunlightâs Passage to Earth
Sunlight travels from the sun to Earth at the speed of lightâbut what sets the speed of
light? Actually, as we learned in Section 4.2, itâs one of the fundamental constants of nature,
with a defined value of 299,792,458 m/s in empty space. Although we could argue that the
speed of light is set by the relationships between the electric and magnetic fields, that
observation simply passes the buck. If you were then to ask what sets the relationships
between the electric and magnetic fields, the answer would be the speed of light.
Rather than justifying why sunlight travels as fast as it does in empty space, letâs look
at what happens to it when it enters a region thatâs not empty. After all, sunlight eventually
reaches Earthâs atmosphere and, when it does, several interesting things happen.
First, the sunlight slows down as its electric and magnetic fields begin to interact with
the electric charges and magnetic poles in the atmosphere. Light polarizes the molecules it
encountersâits electric field displaces positive charges from negative charges, and its
magnetic field displaces north poles from south poles. These polarization effects delay
lightâs passage so that it travels more slowly. Since most transparent materials respond
much more strongly to lightâs electric field than to its magnetic field, weâll concentrate on
only electric effects.
The factor by which light slows down in a material is known as the materialâs
index of refraction. Light travels particularly slowly through materials that are easy to
polarize, and some of them have indices of refraction of 2 or even 3. Because air near
sea level is only slightly polarizable, however, its index of refraction is just 1.0003.
Although this reduction in lightâs speed is too small to notice directly, we do notice the
polarized air particles that cause it. These polarized air particles are what makes the
sky blue (Fig. 13.1.3).
The particles in air consist of individual atoms and molecules, small collections of
atoms and molecules, water droplets, and dust. As a wave of sunlight passes through one of
these particles, the particle becomes polarized. Its electric charges accelerate back and
forth as the sunlightâs electric field pushes them around, and they reemit a new electromagnetic wave of their own.
This new wave draws its energy from the original wave. In effect, the particle acts as a
tiny antenna, temporarily receiving part of the electromagnetic wave and immediately
retransmitting it in a new direction. This process, whereby a tiny particle redirects the path
of a passing light wave, is called Rayleigh scattering, after the English physicist Lord
Rayleigh (John William Strutt, 1842â1919), who first understood it in some detail.

Fig. 13.1.3 (a) During the day, the sky above Monument Valley appears blue because Earth
atmosphere scatters mostly blue sunlight toward us. (b) At night, the scattered sunlight is gone and
the atmosphere is a clear window through which to observe the stars.

Sunlight

Although most sunlight travels directly to our eyes, some of it undergoes Rayleigh
scattering and reaches us by more complicated paths. We see the direct light as coming
from the brilliant disk of the sun, but the scattered light gives the entire sky a fairly uniform
blue glow (Fig. 13.1.4). Why is this glow blue?
The skyâs blue color comes about because the tiny air particles that Rayleigh-scatter
sunlight are too small to make good antennas for that light. We observed in Section 12.1
that a dipole antenna works best when it is about half as long as the wavelength of its electromagnetic wave. The air particles make particularly bad antennas for long-wavelength
red light, so very little red sunlight undergoes Rayleigh scattering on its way through the
atmosphere. However, the air particles make less poor antennas for short-wavelength blue
light. Some of the violet, indigo, and blue sunlight does Rayleigh-scatter and reaches our
eyes from all directions. We see this Rayleigh-scattered light as the bluish glow of the sky.
Rayleigh scattering not only makes the sky blue; it also makes the sunrises and sunsets
red. As the sun rises or sets, its light must travel long distances through Earthâs atmosphere
to reach your eyes. Its path is so long that most of the violet, indigo, and blue light Rayleighscatters away miles to your east or west and all you see is the remaining red light. Sometimes the whole local sky appears reddish because there simply isnât any bluish light left to
scatter toward you. Sunrises and sunsets are particularly colorful when extra dust or ash is
present in the atmosphere to enhance the Rayleigh scattering. Air pollution, forest fires, and
volcanic eruptions tend to create unusually red sunrises and sunsets.
In contrast, clouds and fog appear white because theyâre composed of relatively large water
droplets. These droplets are larger than the wavelengths of visible light and scatter all of sunlightâs wavelengths equally well. Although this scattering is often so effective that you canât see
the sunâs disk through a cloud, it doesnât give the cloud any color. The cloud simply looks white.
Check Your Understanding #2: Seeing the Blues
The air in a dark, smoky room often looks bluish when illuminated by white light. What creates this
bluish appearance?
Answer: Rayleigh scattering from the microscopic smoke particles scatters more blue light than red
light and gives the air a bluish glow.
Why: When smoky air in a dark room is illuminated by a bright spotlight or another white light source,
the tiny particles in the air Rayleigh-scatter some of the light. When you look at the air against a dark
background, you can see this glow. Since Rayleigh scattering affects blue light most strongly, the air
appears bluish.

Rainbows
Sometimes water droplets do separate the colors of sunlight. When sunlight shines on clear
round raindrops as they fall during a storm, these raindrops can create a rainbow. To understand how clear spheres of water can bend sunlightâs path and separate it according to
wavelength, we must understand three important optical effects: refraction, reflection, and
dispersion. We encountered those same wave phenomena while studying water surface
waves in Section 9.3, but now they appear in a new contextâlight waves!
Letâs begin by looking at what happens when a wave of sunlight passes directly
through a raindrop. Because water is more polarizable than air, the wave slows down inside
the raindrop and its cycles bunch together (Fig. 13.1.5). This bunching effect reduces the
lightâs wavelength inside the drop. Lightâs frequency remains unchanged because the
cycles canât disappear, but they move more slowly.
If a narrow wave of sunlight is aimed directly through the center of the raindrop, it will
follow a straight path and emerge essentially unaffected from the other side (Fig. 13.1.6a).
However, if that wave strikes the raindrop near the top, it will bend as it enters the water
(Fig. 13.1.6b). This occurs because the lower edge of the wave will reach the water first and

slow down, the upper edge will then overtake it and the wave will bend downward. The
wave will head more directly into the water.
As the wave in Fig. 13.1.6b leaves the raindrop, its upper edge emerges first and speeds
up while the lower edge lags behind. The wave bends downward even further and heads
less directly into the air and away from the water.
This bending of sunlight at the boundaries between materials is refraction. It occurs
whenever sunlight changes speeds as it passes through a boundary at an angle. If sunlight
slows down at a boundary (Fig. 13.1.7a), it bends toward the line perpendicular to the boundary and heads more directly into the new material. If sunlight speeds up at a boundary
(Fig. 13.1.7a), it bends away from the line perpendicular to the boundary and heads less
directly into the new material. The amount of the bend increases as the speed change increases.
However, part of the sunlight striking a boundary doesnât pass through the boundary at
all. Instead, it reflects. In Section 9.3, we attributed wave reflection specifically to changes
in wave speed at a boundary. However, the more general cause of wave reflections is an
impedance mismatch, an abrupt change in how the wave moves through its environment.
In general, impedance measures a systemâs opposition to the passage of a current or a
wave. For an electric current, impedance measures how much voltage is needed to propel a
given current. For an electromagnetic wave, impedance measures how much electric field
is needed to produce a given magnetic field. Impedance effects are common in nature (see
1 ) and also apply to mechanical waves and mechanical currents. When sound and water
waves encounter impedance mismatches, they partly reflect as echos.

The impedance of empty space is high because there an electric field has nothing to aid
it in producing a magnetic field. Inside most materials, however, the electric field has help.
The electric field polarizes the material, which then helps to create the magnetic field.
Because of this assistance, the impedance of most materials is much less than that of empty
space. Since air is almost empty space, the boundary between air and water is an impedance
mismatch for light.
Passing through an impedance mismatch upsets the balance between a light waveâs
electric and magnetic fields. To compensate for this imbalance, part of the incoming wave
reflects off the boundary. Thus some sunlight reflects each time it enters or leaves a water
droplet. The fraction of light that reflects depends on the severity of the impedance mismatch, but it is typically 4% between air and most transparent materials, including water
(for reflection from sand, see 2 ). In contrast, metals polarize so easily that their impedances are essentially zero and they reflect light almost perfectly.
There is one more important point about sunlightâs passage through water: red light
travels about 1% faster through water than violet light does. Thatâs because higher-frequency
violet light polarizes the water molecules a little more easily than lower-frequency red light
does and that increased polarization slows down the violet light. This frequency dependence of lightâs speed in a material is dispersion. Dispersion affects refraction. The more
light slows as it enters a raindrop, the more it bends at the boundary. Since violet light
slows more than red light, violet light also bends more and the different colors of sunlight
follow somewhat different paths through the raindrop.
A rainbow is created when raindrops separate sunlight according to color (Fig. 13.1.8).
To see the rainbow, you stand with the sun at your back and look up at the sky. When sunlight hits the raindrops, they redirect some of that light back toward you. Since each raindrop redirects light only in a narrow range of angles, you canât see light from every raindrop. Only the raindrops in a narrow arc of the sky redirect visible light toward you. This
arc appears brightly colored because raindrops at the inner edge of the arc send violet light
toward you while raindrops at the outer edge of the arc send red light toward you. In
between, you see all the colors of the rainbow.
Figure 13.1.9 shows how a raindrop redirects different colors of light in different
directions. Although there are many possible paths light can take through the raindrop, this
path is the one that produces rainbows. Sunlight enters near the top of the raindrop and
bends inward. Violet light bends more than red light, so the sunlight begins to separate
according to color. Some sunlight is also reflected from the raindrop but doesnât contribute
to rainbows.
When the light inside the raindrop strikes the back surface, most of it leaves the drop and
is lost. A small fraction of the light reflects from that surface, however, and continues to travel

because it redirects
sunlight in all directions.
One explanation for this
effect is that the sand
grains act as tiny antennas
that respond to and reemit
lightâs electromagnetic
waves. A second explanation is that the sand grains
present the sunlight with
thousands of air-sand
boundaries from which to
reflect. However, both
explanations are descriptions of exactly the same
physicsâthe charged
particles in the sand grains
are electrically polarized
by the waves passing
through them. These
waves are randomly
redirected without being
absorbed, and they give
the sand its white
appearance.

through the raindrop. When this light reaches the raindropâs front surface, most of it leaves
the drop. Violet light bends more strongly than red light as they reenter the air, so the different
colors of light leave the drop heading in different directions. Since violet light is redirected
more upward than red light, you see violet light coming toward you from the lower raindrops.
Red light is redirected more downward so you see it coming toward you from the upper raindrops. Thus the upper arc of the rainbow is red, while the lower arc is violet.
Check Your Understanding #3: The Look of Diamonds
A diamond pendant sparkles with color when you look at it in sunlight. From where do the colors
come?
Answer: A diamond exhibits dispersion, so different frequencies of sunlight follow somewhat different paths through the diamondâs polished facets. The different colors of sunlight emerge from the
diamond traveling in slightly different directions, so you can see them individually.
Why: One of the delightful aspects of a diamond is its strong dispersion. It bends violet light much
more than red light, so sunlight is separated into its different colors as it passes through the stone.
Cleverly cut facets help to isolate the individual colors.

Soap Bubbles
Soap bubbles also separate sunlight into its various colors (Fig. 13.1.10), but they use
another wave phenomenonâinterference. We encountered interference of mechanical
waves in Section 9.3 when we studied wave beat at the seashore and interference of electromagnetic waves in Section 12.2 when we considered the unevenness of microwave
cooking. Now weâll look at interference in another type of electromagnetic wave, light.
Lightâs interference effects stem from the summing or superposition of its electromagnetic waves. When several light waves overlap at a particular location, their electric fields
sum together and so do their magnetic fields. If their individual fields all point in the same
direction, the waves experience constructive interferenceâthey sum together in a mutually
assisting way and the light intensity at that location is enhanced (Fig. 13.1.11a). However,
when their individual fields point in opposing directions, the waves experience destructive
interferenceâthey sum together in a canceling way and the light intensity at that location
is reduced (Fig. 13.1.11b).
Both forms of interference occur when sunlight reflects from the outer skin of a soap
bubble. As each wave of sunlight hits that thin film of soapy water, the filmâs front surface
reflects about 4% of the wave and the filmâs back surface reflects another 4% (Fig. 13.1.12).
Since both reflections travel in the same direction, the reflected light that you see reaches
your eyes via two different paths, one from each reflection. If these two waves arrive in
phaseâthat is, with their electric fields synchronized and assisting one anotherâyou see
the particularly bright reflection of constructive interference. If the two waves arrive out of
Fig. 13.1.10 Light reflected by the front
and back surfaces of this soap film interferes
with itself and gives the film its colorful
appearance. Since the colors are determined
by film thickness and since the filmâs
thickness increases in the downward direction,
the film displays horizontal bands of color.

phaseâwith their electric fields canceling one anotherâyou see the particularly dim
reflection of destructive interference.
Whether you see constructive or destructive interference depends on the wavelength of
the sunlight. The back-surface reflection has to travel twice through the soap film, so itâs
delayed relative to the front-surface reflection. If the delay is just long enough for the wave
to complete an integral number of cycles, then the two reflected waves are in phase with
one another as they head toward your eye and you see a bright reflection. If the delay allows
the back-surface reflection to complete an extra half cycle, then the two reflected waves are
out of phase with one another and you see a dim reflection.
Sunlight contains many different wavelengths of light, and these wavelengths behave
differently during the reflection process. You see a colored reflection, consisting mainly of
those wavelengths of light that experience constructive interference. Because the delay
experienced by the back-surface reflection depends on the thickness of the soap film, you
can actually determine the filmâs thickness by studying its colors.

Check Your Understanding #4: A Slick-Looking Oil Slick
A thin layer of oil or gasoline floating on water appears brightly colored in sunlight. From where do
these colors come?
Answer: They come from interferences between light reflected by the top and bottom surfaces of the
floating layer of oil.
Why: A thin film of almost anything on water will appear colored because of interference. Part of each
light wave striking the film reflects from the top surface, and part reflects from the bottom surface.
These two reflected waves interfere with one another in a wavelength-dependent manner and make the
layer appear brightly colored. Different colors correspond to different thicknesses of the thin films.

All sunglasses absorb some of the sunlight passing through them, but the best ones absorb
horizontally polarized light much more strongly than vertically polarized light. These
polarizing sunglasses dramatically reduce glare by eliminating most of the light reflected
from horizontal surfaces.
When light strikes a transparent surface at right angles, about 4% of that light is
reflected, regardless of its polarization. When light strikes a horizontal surface at a shallow
angle, however, its polarization profoundly affects its reflection. A light wave that has a
horizontal electric field (essentially horizontally polarized light) reflects strongly from the
surface (Fig. 13.1.13a). In contrast, a light wave that has a horizontal magnetic field (essentially vertically polarized light) barely reflects at all (Fig. 13.1.13b).
When the waveâs electric field is horizontal, it pushes electric charges back and forth
along a horizontal surface. Charges shift relatively easily in that direction, so the surface
polarizes well and reflects the wave strongly. The shallower the angle between the surface
and the incident light wave, the larger the surfaceâs polarization and the greater the reflection. Horizontally polarized light thus reflects strongly from horizontal surfaces and its
reflection increases as its angle to the surface becomes shallower.
When the waveâs electric field is vertical or nearly vertical, it pushes electric charges
in and out of a horizontal surface. Since the charges canât leave the surface, the surface

polarizes ineffectually and reflects the wave weakly. The polarization and reflection become
even weaker as the angle becomes shallower until, at Brewsterâs angle, the wave doesnât
reflect at all. Vertically polarized light thus reflects weakly from horizontal surfaces and
that reflection drops to zero at Brewsterâs angle. For angles shallower than Brewsterâs
angle, however, the reflection becomes stronger as the angle becomes shallower.
Although direct sunlight is an even mixture of vertically and horizontally polarized
waves, the shallow-angle glare reflecting from the horizontal surfaces of water, pavement,
or painted car hoods is mostly horizontally polarized waves. Polarizing sunglasses are
designed to absorb horizontally polarized light, which is why they are so effective at reducing glare (Fig. 13.1.14).
Check Your Understanding #5: Looking into the Reflecting Pool
When you look into a pool of water, you see mostly a reflection of the sky. When you wear polarizing
sunglasses, however, you see into the water clearly. Explain.
Answer: Most of the light that reflects from the water is horizontally polarized. The sunglasses block
horizontally polarized light, so you see mostly light from within the pool of water.
Why: Sunlight reflecting from a horizontal surface is mostly horizontally polarized waves. By blocking
horizontally polarized light, polarizing sunglasses virtually eliminate this reflected light, and you see
mostly light from below the surface. If you turn the sunglasses sideways, they will block the wrong
polarization of light and you will see mostly the reflected light. Try it.

Energy efficiency is crucial to modern lighting. Incandescent
lamps provide pleasant, warm illumination, but most of the
power they consume is wasted as invisible infrared light. Fluorescent and other gas discharge lamps produce far more visible
light with the same amount of electric power and now dominate office, industrial, and street lighting. In this section weâll
explore several types of discharge lampsâfluorescent, mercury
vapor, sodium vapor, and metal-halide lampsâthat all share a
common theme: current passing through a gas.
Questions to Think About: Why are incandescent lightbulbs
being phased out? Why do different fluorescent lamps often

CHAPT ER 13 Light

have slightly different colors? Why is the light from a neon sign
red? Why shouldnât you turn a fluorescent lamp on and off
frequently? Why are streetlights so dim when they first turn
on? Why are some highway lights orange?
Experiments to Do: Examine the discharge lamps around you,
particularly the white fluorescent tube lamps. Where do their
lights originate? In a fluorescent lamp, light comes from the
white phosphor coating on the tubeâs inner surface. What
about in a neon lamp or a mercury vapor streetlight? Compare

the colors of various lamps, including several different fluorescent lamps. Are their lights identical?
Both fluorescent and neon lamps start almost immediatelyâ
but watch how long it takes a streetlight to start. Fluorescent and neon lamps remain cool during operation, but the
mercury, sodium, and metal-halide lamps used in street
lighting get hot. Watch a streetlight warm up. Does its color
change? If the streetlight loses power even for a moment, it
must wait about 5 minutes before it can start again. Why
must it wait?

How We See Light and Color
Before examining discharge lamps, letâs look at how our eyes recognize color. It might
seem that they actually measure the wavelengths of light, but thatâs not the case. Instead,
our retinas contain three groups of light-sensing cone cells that respond to three different
ranges of wavelengths. One group of cone cells responds to light near 600 nm and lets us
see red, another responds to light near 550 nm and lets us see green, and a third responds
to light near 450 nm and lets us see blue (Fig. 13.2.1). These cone cells are most abundant
at the center of our vision. Our retinas also contain rod cells, which are more light-sensitive
than cone cells, but rod cells canât distinguish color. They are most abundant in our peripheral vision and provide us with night vision.
Having only three types of color-sensing cells doesnât limit us to seeing just three
colors. We perceive other colors whenever two or more types of cone cells are stimulated
at once. Each type of cell reports the amount of light it detects, and our brains interpret the
overall response as a particular color.
Although light of a certain wavelength will stimulate all three types of cone cells
simultaneously, the cells donât respond equally. If the wavelength is 680 nm, the red cone
cells will respond much more strongly than the green or blue cells. Because of this strong
red response, we see the light as red.
Other wavelengths of light stimulate the three types of cells somewhat more
evenly. Light with a wavelength of 580 nm is in between red and green light. Both the
red-sensitive and the green-sensitive cone cells respond about equally to this light, and
we see it as yellow.
We also see yellow when looking at an equal mixture of 640-nm light (red) and 525-nm
light (green). The 640-nm light stimulates the red-sensitive cone cells and the 525-nm light
stimulates the green-sensitive ones. Even though there is no 580-nm light entering our
eyes, we see the same yellow color as before.
In fact, mixtures of red, green, and blue light can make us see virtually any color. For
that reason, these three are called the primary colors of light or the primary additive

and blue light to produce their full-color images.
Although the idea of mixing primary colors also applies to paints, inks, and pigments,
the palette is different. The primary colors of pigment or the primary subtractive colors
are cyan, magenta, and yellow (Fig. 13.2.2b). When you apply one of these primary pigments to a white surface, it absorbs or subtracts one of the primary colors of light from the
surfaceâs reflection. Cyan subtracts the reflection of red, magenta subtracts the reflection
of green, and yellow subtracts the reflection of blue. Color printers, photographs, magazines, and books use tiny patches of cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments to produce their
full-color images.

More Light, Less Heat: Gas Discharges
When all three of our color-sensing cells respond about equally, we see white light. Thatâs
because our vision evolved under a single incandescent light sourceâthe sun. Sunlight
stimulates the red-, green-, and blue-sensitive cells in our eyes about evenly, so any other
source of âwhite lightâ must do the same.
Most of the twentieth centuryâs white-light illumination came from incandescent lightbulbs, but that wonât be true for the twenty-first century. Although an incandescent lightbulb makes a good attempt at producing white light, it suffers from two serious drawbacks.
First, because its filament canât reach the temperature of the sunâs surface (5800 K), its
blackbody spectrum contains too little blue light and appears redder than sunlight. Second,
because most of its electromagnetic radiation is invisible infrared light, it doesnât use
energy efficiently to produce visible light. It produces only about 15 lumens per watt,
where the lumen is a standard measure of usable illumination. (For comparison, the discharge lamps that weâre about to discuss can easily exceed 100 lumens per watt.)
Fortunately, modern science has given us some alternative sources of light, sources
that donât use heat and thermal radiation to produce their light. Among these sources are
gas discharge lamps, which emit light when electric currents pass through their gases.
Some discharge lamps are colored, and others do excellent jobs of producing white light.
Also, many of them are far more energy efficient at producing visible light than are incandescent lightbulbs.
To get an understanding of gas discharges and the lights they emit, letâs start with one
of the simplest examples, a neon sign tube. Although neonâs rich red glow isnât suitable for
lighting and isnât particularly energy efficient, itâs great for signs and also relatively easy to
understand.
A neon sign tube is a sealed glass tube that contains pure neon gas at a density less than
1% that of the atmosphere outside the tube. It has metal electrodes at each end so that electric current can enter the gas through one electrode and leave through the other. Of course,
gases are normally electrical insulators, and neon is no exception. To transform the tubeâs
neon into a conductor, a large voltage difference is applied between its two electrodes. As
we saw in Section 10.2, a gas breaks down when exposed to large voltage gradients; its few
naturally occurring ions initiate a cascade of ionizing collisions that quickly fill the gas
with charged particles and render it conducting.

Whereas ordinary air breaks down at a voltage gradient of about 30,000 V/cm,
low-density neon breaks down at a much lower voltage gradient. Thatâs because
in a low-density gas, charged particles can travel farther and accumulate more

Check Your Understanding #2: Making Whiter Light
Some photographic lamps simulate sunlight by placing a blue filter in front of an incandescent bulb.
This filter absorbs some of the red light so that the lamp appears whiter. Does this filter increase or
decrease the lampâs energy efficiency?
Answer: It decreases the lampâs energy efficiency.
Why: Although the bluish filter changes the spectrum of wavelengths so that the amount of blue light
leaving the lamp increases relative to the red light, it does this by absorbing some of the red light.
The filter gets hot, and less electric power used by the bulb leaves as visible light.

Particles, Waves, and Quantum Physics
As quantum physics gradually revealed itself to the scientists of the early twentieth century,
they found the experience both exhilarating and disorienting. Prior to that era, the physical
world seemed to divide neatly into particles and waves: scientists viewed an electron only
as a particle and light only as a wave. However, one of the most basic observations of quantum physics, and the one most relevant to our present topic, is that everything has both
particle and wave characteristics. Put simply, everything begins and ends as a particle, but
travels as a wave.
For an electron, the quantum surprise is that it travels as a wave. For light, the quantum
surprise is that it is emitted and absorbed as a particle. Called the wave-particle duality,
this observation that everything in nature has both particle and wave characteristics has left
few areas of physics unaffected. But although quantum physics is now a basic and essential
part of nearly all modern physics research, its effects are subtle and often nonintuitive.
They are most apparent in the microscopic world and are visible to us only indirectly. No
wonder they seem so strange.
Weâll encounter quantum physics and its effects throughout the remainder of this
book. It figures prominently in the light emitted by atoms, the electronic properties of semiconductors, the operation of lasers, and the radioactive decays that release nuclear energy.
Our examination of atoms will acquaint us with the wave nature of electrons and show us
how the wave phenomena that we studied in Chapter 9 reappear in quantum physics. In
discharge lamps, LEDs, and lasers, weâll explore the particle nature of light and see how
the collision effects we studied in Chapters 1â3 are influenced by quantum physics. In our
examination of radioactivity, weâll uncover particle and wave effects that we would not

Discharge Lamps

367

even have anticipated without quantum physics. With each encounter, weâll take another
small bite of the quantum appleâlooking at how quantum effects manifest themselves in
our everyday world.
Check Your Understanding #3: Wavy Atoms
Do atoms ever exhibit wave properties?
Answer: They certainly do.
Why: Like everything else in nature, atoms have both particle and wave properties. Atoms travel as
waves and have recently been shown to exhibit many of the wave effects we studied in Chapter 9,
including refraction, reflection, and interference.

Electron Standing Waves in Atoms: Orbitals
According to the wave-particle duality, electrons have both particle and wave characteristics. Like all objects in our universe, electrons travel as waves when they move from place
to place, and itâs only when you go looking for them that you find them as particles at
particular locations (see 3 ). When they reside in atoms and you leave them alone, electrons are best understood as waves.
In a nonquantum world, an electron would exist only as a particle and would be able
to move at any speed along any path, even in an atom. However, ours is a quantum world
and the electron does not travel as a particle at all; it travels as a wave. The electron is
therefore constrained by the rules that govern waves, some of which we encountered in
Chapter 9. Like the confined mechanical waves on a violin string, drumhead, or basin of
water, the confined electron waves in an atom have limited possibilities.
We observed in Chapter 9 that the most basic mechanical waves on a limited object are
all standing wavesâwaves that effectively oscillate in place. This rule also applies to quantum waves in limited objects. An atom is a limited object, and the electrons in an atom are
best understood as standing waves in that atom. Each electron wave extends across the
atom and has such wave characteristics as wavelength and frequency.
Unlike a vibrating string or drumhead, however, the electron is a three-dimensional
wave and its oscillation is internal. Instead of vibrating back and forth, each point of the
wave cycles invisibly around a quantum phase. Since that quantum phase is rather mysterious, you can think of an electron standing wave as a fuzzy cloud in which each point
cycles endlessly through a series of colors: red, yellow, green, blue, red, yellow, and so on
(Fig. 13.2.4). All those points cycle at the same quantum frequency, but theyâre not necessarily the same color at the same time. When the electron is in a three-dimensional standing
wave, the electron cloudâs spatial structure is constant as the wave oscillates internally and
the electron exhibits no motion at all.
This wave character has profound effects on the electronic structure of atoms.
Most significantly, it limits what electrons can do in those atoms. As we saw in Section
9.2, a violin stringâs one-dimensional standing waves consist only of its fundamental
mode (Fig. 9.2.3) and its harmonic modes (Fig. 9.2.5), and a drumheadâs two-dimensional
standing waves consist only of its fundamental mode and overtones (Fig. 9.2.11). Similarly, an electronâs three-dimensional standing waves in an atom consist only of a
fundamental mode (Fig. 13.2.4a) and overtone modes (Figs. 13.2.4bâd). Although
there are a great many overtone modes available to the electron, their possibilities are
nonetheless limited.
The electron standing waves in atoms are known as orbitalsâa nod to the orbits that
electrons would make around atomic nuclei if this were a nonquantum world. Electrons in
solids are less focused on specific atomic nuclei, so the standing waves in solids are instead
called levelsâa recognition that each standing wave has an amount, or level, of energy
associated with it. Weâll see when we examine LEDs in Section 13.3 that each solidâs

limited level choices determine whether itâs a conductor, an insulator, or a semiconductorâ
the basis for modern electronics. In the present section, weâll see that an atomâs limited
orbital choices determine the colors of light it can emit or absorb and therefore the characteristics of most discharge lamps.

Check Your Understanding #4: Going Nowhere Fast
When an electron is in an atomic orbital, how often does it shift from one side of the atom to the
other?
Answer: An electron in an atomic orbital doesnât move at all, so it never shifts from one side of the
atom to the other.
Why: An atomic orbital is an electron standing wave that is spread across the atom. Although that
wave is oscillating internally, it makes no spatial motion at all and therefore doesnât shift from one
place to another. The electron wave simply oscillates in place.

Another remarkable observation of quantum physics is that every indistinguishable electron must have its own orbital or level, its own unique quantum wave. This law is called the
Pauli exclusion principle, after its discoverer, Wolfgang Pauli 4 . The principle applies to
a whole class of subatomic particles, the Fermi particles, that includes all the basic constituents of matter: electrons, protons, and neutrons. For reasons that lie deep in what is
known as quantum field theory, two indistinguishable Fermi particles can never be in the
same quantum wave.

THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE
No two indistinguishable Fermi particles ever occupy the same quantum wave.

However, a peculiar property of electrons allows two of them to share an orbital or
level. Electrons have two possible internal states, usually called spin-up and spin-down.
Because a spin-up electron is distinguishable from a spin-down electron, one spin-up electron and one spin-down electron can share a single orbital or level. However, two electrons
is the absolute maximum allowed by quantum physics and the Pauli exclusion principle.
Despite being a wave, an electron in an orbital has a specific total energyâthe sum of
its kinetic and potential energies. That energy, which depends on the shape and structure of
the electron wave, also determines the waveâs oscillation frequency. According to quantum
physics, the electronâs total energy and the oscillation frequency of its wave are exactly
proportional to one another; a low-energy electron oscillates slowly, while a high-energy
electron oscillates quickly. Each orbital, each quantum standing wave in an atom, has a
specific frequency and energy. The electronâs fundamental mode (the 1s orbital, Fig. 13.2.4a)
has the lowest frequency and energy, while the overtone modes have progressively higher
frequencies and energies (Figs. 13.2.4bâd).
Although these orbitals are three-dimensional standing waves, they resemble the
two-dimensional standing waves of the drumhead shown in Fig. 9.2.9. Like the drumheadâs
vibrational modes, the orbitals are distinguished from one another by their patterns of
nodesâsurfaces along which the electron wave has no amplitude. An electronâs fundamental mode has no nodes (Fig. 13.2.4a) and has the lowest quantum frequency. Each of the
overtone modes, however, has at least one node (Figs. 13.2.4bâd). In general, the more
nodes an orbital has, the greater its quantum frequency.
Physicists have come to view these standing waves as abstract placeholders, independent of the electrons that may or may not exhibit them at a given moment. The orbitals are
then analogous to seats in an stadium, each of which may or may not be occupied by electrons. Instead of saying that the electron exhibits a particular standing wave or orbital, we
often say that the orbital is occupied by an electron.
At sufficiently low temperature, electrons occupy those orbitals that have the least
energy and fill the atomâs orbitals from lowest energy on up. In accordance with the Pauli
exclusion principle, each orbital accommodates two electrons, one spin-up and one spindown, until all the atomâs electrons have been placed. The chemical nature of a particular
atom, and its location in the periodic table of the elements (Fig. 13.2.5), is determined by
how many electrons it has and how those electrons fill the available orbitals. Atoms are
electrically neutral, so the number of negatively charged electrons in an atom is the same
as the number of positively charged protons in its nucleus, its atomic number.
There are patterns to orbitals; orbitals may share the same number of nodes or be
rotated versions of one another. These patterns among orbitals give rise to the shells, that
is, groups of orbitals that have similar energies and tend to fill with electrons at about the
same time. Although the orbital patterns and shells are complicated by the fact that charged

electrons influence one another and distort one anotherâs standing waves, many atomic
properties are determined simply by which orbitals are occupied by an atomâs electrons.
The atomic orbitals are identified primarily by an integer and a letter, both of which
relate to their node patterns (Fig. 13.2.4). The integer (1, 2, 3,âŚ) is one more than the
number of node surfaces in the orbital (0, 1, 2,âŚ) and the letter (s, p, d, f, g, h,âŚ) indicates
how many of those node surfaces pass through the atomâs center (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,âŚ).
Although s orbitals appear one at a time, p orbitals appear in groups of three, d orbitals in
groups of five, f orbitals in groups of seven, and so on.
Check Your Understanding #5: Threeâs a Crowd
Suppose that electrons had three different internal states: spin-up, spin-down, and spin-off. How
would that change affect the way electrons arrange themselves in atoms?
Answer: Each orbital could then accommodate up to three electrons, so atoms would have fewer
occupied orbitals.
Why: The Pauli exclusion principle prevents two indistinguishable electrons from occupying the same
quantum wave. With three distinguishable electron states, each orbital could accommodate up to
three electrons: a spin-up electron, a spin-down electron, and a spin-off electron. With more electrons settling into the low-energy orbitals, atoms would have fewer occupied orbitals and quite different behaviors.

Neonâs Red Glow
A neon atom has 10 electrons, so it takes 5 orbitals to accommodate them. The first two
electrons go into the 1s orbital, the fundamental mode with zero nodes (Fig. 13.2.4a). Filling the 1s orbital completes the first major shell. The next two electrons go into the 2s
orbital, which has one node surface, a hollow sphere (Fig. 13.2.4b). Finally, neonâs last six
electrons go into the three 2p orbitals, each of which has one node surface, a plane passing
through the atomâs center (Fig. 13.2.4c). Since filling the 2s and 2p orbitals completes the
second major shell, the neon atom (Ne in Fig. 13.2.5) is chemically inert. That is why neon
exists as a gas of individual atoms!
An arrangement of occupied orbitals is called a state, and the state we have just
described is neonâs ground state, the state with the lowest possible total energy. The neon
atom has other states available, but they all involve additional energy. Thatâs where the
discharge enters the picture. When a charged particle collides with a ground-state neon
atom, thereâs a chance that the collision will knock an electron out of its usual orbital into
one of the empty orbitals. The neon atom will then be in an excited stateâit will have
extra energy.
Suppose, for example, that a collision has just shifted one of the neon atomâs electrons from a 2p orbital to a 3p orbital. The atom will quickly undergo a series of stateto-state transitions that eventually return it to its ground state. With each transition, the
atom will drop to a lower energy state and emit a photon, a particle, or quanta, of light.
The photon carries away the energy released in transitioning from the higher-energy
state to the lower-energy state. In all likelihood, one of those transitions will shift the
electron from its 3p orbital to the 3s orbital and produce a photon of red light, the red of
a neon sign!
As long as the electron remains in the 3p orbitalâa particular standing waveâit canât
emit an electromagnetic wave. That standing wave has a quantum oscillation; however, the
oscillation is internal to the electron and neither the electron wave nor its charge has any
overall motion. Since charge must accelerate to emit electromagnetic waves (see Section
12.1), without such overall motion there can be no emission of electromagnetic waves.
When the 3p electron begins its transition to the empty 3s orbital, however, its quantum wave starts to move. That wave is no longer one motionless standing wave but is,
instead, composed of two partial waves: part 3p orbital and part 3s orbital. Because those
two partial waves have different energies and different quantum frequencies, they experience time-dependent interference effects. The patterns of constructive and destructive
interference change so that the overall electron wave moves rhythmically back and forth
and the atom begins to emit an electromagnetic wave. By the time the transition is complete
and the electron is entirely in the 3s orbital, the atom has emitted a photon of red light. Like
an electron, light travels as a wave but behaves as a particle when you try to locate it. While
itâs being emitted or absorbed by an atom, light exhibits its particle nature.
Weâve seen that hot objects emit light, a process called incandescence, but here the
neon atom emits light without heat, a process called luminescence. That luminescence is
the result of a radiative transition, a transition between quantum states in which a photon of light is emitted or absorbed. In this case, the radiative transition emits a photon
that carries away the energy released when the excited neon atomâs 3p electron shifts
into the empty 3s orbital. The difference in energy between those two states determines
the photon energy, which in turn determines the frequency and color of the photonâs
light wave.
According to quantum physics, a photonâs frequency is proportional to its energy.
Specifically, the photonâs energy is equal to the frequency of its electromagnetic wave
times a fundamental constant of nature known as the Planck constant. This relationship
between energy and frequency can be written as a word equation:
energy = Planck constant Âˇ frequency,

in symbols:
E = h Âˇ Ď,
and in everyday language:
Ultraviolet light and X-rays can injure your skin and tissues because each
particle of high-frequency light carries a great deal of energy.
First used by German physicist Max Planck (1858â1947) in 1900 to explain the light spectrum of a hot object, the Planck constant has a measured value of 6.626 Ă 10â34 J â s. Also,
although we have just encountered the Planck constant and Eq. 13.2.1 in the context of
light waves, it actually applies to all quantum waves. For example, the quantum frequency
of an electron is related to its energy by Eq. 13.2.1.
The value of the Planck constant is so tiny that even a photon of 1015-Hz ultraviolet
light has an energy of only 6.626 Ă 10â19 J. A typical beam of light thus contains so many
photons that you canât see that theyâre arriving as particles. However, the energy in a single
ultraviolet photon is substantial on a molecular scale. It can damage a molecule in your
skin, contributing to a sunburn and inducing your skin to tan as a defensive response.
X-rays have even higher frequencies, and their energetic photons can cause more severe
molecular damage.
A neon atom can only emit photons corresponding to energy differences between two
of its states, a constraint that severely limits its light spectrum. Neglecting nuclear issues
that weâll discuss in Chapter 15, all neon atoms are identical and emit the same characteristic spectrum of light. The visible part of that spectrum is dominated by the warm red glow
of photons emitted when electrons shift from 3p to 3s orbitals, which is why a neon sign
glows red.
Since atoms of different elements have different numbers of electrons and different
states, each emits its own unique spectrum of light after being excited. Copper atoms emit a
blue-green spectrum, strontium atoms a deep red, and sodium a bright yellow-orange. Chemists, astronomers, and manufacturers rely on those emission spectra for information and
applications. As we will soon see, so do scientists and engineers working on illumination.
Check Your Understanding #6: Colorful Atoms
Many fireworks involve brilliantly colored lights. How do the atoms in burning chemicals produce
particular colors of light?
Answer: When fire adds energy to an atom and shifts it to an excited state, it emits photons in order
to return to its ground state. Each photonâs energy, frequency, and color are determined by energy
differences between the atomâs states.
Why: Each color in fireworks is produced by a particular type of atom. Some atoms, such as strontium
and lithium, emit mostly red light as they return to their ground states. Barium atoms emit green
light, copper atoms emit blue-green light, and sodium atoms emit yellow-orange light.

Check Your Figures #1: The Particles in a Radio Wave
How much energy is carried by a photon from a 1000-kHz AM radio station?
Answer: The photon carries 6.626 Ă 10â28 J.
Why: Since the Planck constant is 6.626 Ă 10â34 J Âˇ s and the frequency of the radio wave is 106 Hz
or 106 cycles/second, the energy per photon is given by Eq. 13.2.1 as
energy = (6.626 Ă 10â34 J Âˇ s) Âˇ (106 cycles/s) = 6.626 Ă 10â28 J.
This energy is so small that itâs virtually impossible to observe the particulate character of radio
waves.

Fluorescent Lamps
If neon tubes appeal to you for illumination, you probably march to your own drummer.
Most people opt for a somewhat better simulation of sunlight in their discharge lamps. As
an energy-efficient source of artificial sunlight, though, itâs hard to beat fluorescent lamps.
At the heart of a fluorescent lamp is a narrow glass tube filled with argon, neon, and/or
krypton gases at about 0.3% of atmospheric density and pressure. The tube also contains a
few drops of liquid mercury metal, some of which evaporates to form mercury vapor. About
1 in every 1000 gas atoms inside the tube is a mercury atom, and itâs these mercury atoms
that are responsible for the light.
Like a neon sign tube, a fluorescent lamp uses a discharge in its gas to produce light.
Although fluorescent lamps occasionally use high voltages to initiate their discharges, most
operate their discharges at household voltages and must rely on alternative techniques to
render their gases conducting. These low-voltage lamps normally heat their electrodes so
that thermal energy ejects electrons from their surfaces into the gas. Regardless of how the
discharge is started, however, the result is current flowing through the gas and the emission
of light.
The fluorescent lamp has a problem, though. While its mercury atoms emit most of the
light in its discharge, that light is almost entirely ultraviolet. The final radiative transition
that returns each mercury atom to its ground state (6p â 6s) releases a large amount of
energy and produces a photon with a wavelength of 254 nm. This light canât go through the
glass walls of the tube, and you couldnât see it if it did. So the fluorescent lamp converts it
into visible light with the help of phosphor powder on the inside of the glass tube.
Phosphors are solids that luminesceâthey emit lightâwhen something transfers
energy to them. Their behavior is similar to that of an atom; an energy transfer shifts the
phosphor from its ground state to an excited state, and it then undergoes a series of transitions
that return it to its ground state. Some of those transitions are radiative ones and emit light.
In a fluorescent lamp, the phosphor is excited by ultraviolet light. This excitation or
energy transfer is actually a radiative transition, but one in which the photon is absorbed by
the phosphor; one of its electrons makes a transition from a lower-energy level to a higherenergy level. During this absorption, the lightâs electric field pushes the electronâs wave
back and forth rhythmically until it shifts to the new level. The photon disappears, and the
phosphor receives its energy.
Once the phosphor is in an excited state, its electrons begin to make transitions back to
their ground-state levels. Most of those transitions radiate visible light, the light that you
see when you look at the lamp. However, some of the transitions radiate invisible infrared
light or cause useless vibrations in the phosphor itself. Despite this wasted energy, phosphors are relatively efficient at turning ultraviolet light into visible light, a process called
fluorescence.
The phosphors in a fluorescent lamp are carefully selected and blended to fluoresce
over a broad range of visible wavelengths. That blending is necessary because, like atoms,
each phosphor fluoresces with a characteristic spectrum of light thatâs determined by the
energy differences between its levels. Several different phosphors are needed to produce
the rainbow spectrum of white light. While some advertising and novelty lamps use brightly
colored, unblended phosphors, fluorescent lighting tubes use phosphor mixtures that imitate white thermal radiation sources such as the sun or incandescent lightbulbs.
Because compact fluorescent lamps typically produce 60 to 100 lumens per watt,
about 4 to 6 times the luminous efficiency of incandescent lightbulbs, you can save a great
deal of energy by replacing incandescent lightbulbs with compact fluorescents. In fact,
incandescent lightbulbs are being phased out because of their poor energy inefficiency. To
ease the acceptance of compact fluorescent lamps by a reluctant public, scientists and engineers have had to improve the quality of their light.
Early fluorescent lamps used a phosphor blend known as âdaylight,â which emitted far
too much blue light and made everything look cold and medicinal. Daylight lamps rarely

373

374

CHAPT ER 13 Light

found their way into homes. The first improvement came with the developments of the
âcool whiteâ and âwarm whiteâ phosphor blends. Cool white resembled sunlight, and
warm white resembled light from an incandescent lightbulb. However, even these improved
lamps didnât emit true white-light spectraâthe blackbody spectra of the hot sun or the hot
filament of an incandescent lightbulb. Objects looked a little off-color when illuminated by
these lamps, so people were hesitant to use them in place of incandescent lightbulbs. Photographers and cinematographers wanting to capture true colors were particularly troubled
by fluorescent lighting of that era.
However, the latest generation of fluorescent lamps uses phosphor blends that produce
nearly perfect blackbody spectra. Many of those blends are even sold according to their
color temperatures (see Section 7.3). For example, a 5100 K compact fluorescent lamp
emits light that is almost indistinguishable from the thermal radiation emitted by a black
object heated to 5100 K. That 5100 K color temperature is approximately the color temperature of sunlight averaged over a day. (Sunlightâs color temperature is affected by the atmosphere and is highest at noon and lowest at dawn and dusk.) If you like the color of sunlight,
use 5100 K compact fluorescents.
People who prefer the warm look of incandescent lighting should choose compact
fluorescent lamps with a 2700 K color temperature. These lamps imitate the blackbody
spectrum of a 2700 K tungsten filament almost perfectly. Because this 2700 K blackbody
spectrum is richer in reds and oranges, it has a comforting, warm character to it. If you
canât make up your mind between 5100 K sunlight and 2700 K incandescent light, you can
choose many color temperatures in between. Even photographers and cinematographers
are now using fluorescent lights, to the delight of actors and news anchors who used to
sweat under the intense heat of powerful, energy-inefficient incandescent lamps.
Check Your Understanding #7: Sorry, We Forgot the Coating
If there were no phosphor coating on the inside of a fluorescent tube, what would you see when the
lamp operated?
Answer: You would see only a dim (blue-white) glow from the lamp because most of the light produced by the mercury discharge is invisible ultraviolet light.
Why: Without its phosphor coating, a fluorescent tube produces very little visible light. The phosphor coating is needed to convert the dischargeâs ultraviolet light into visible light. Even if you
could see ultraviolet light, you would see very little of it leaving the tube. The tube is made of glass,
which absorbs virtually all ultraviolet light with wavelengths shorter than 350 nm. Even in a normal
fluorescent tube, any ultraviolet not converted to visible light by the phosphors is absorbed by the
glass tube.

A Few Practical Issues
A fluorescent tube needs a substantial electric field inside it to keep its electrons moving
forward. Since this electric field is proportional to the voltage drop through the tube, longer
tubes need higher voltages. Power-line voltages (110 to 240 V) are appropriate for tubes up
to 3 m (10 ft) in length, but the longer and frequently colored fluorescent tubes used in
artwork or advertising require much higher voltages.
To keep electrons from pushing one another into its walls, a fluorescent tube must
also contain positively charged mercury ions. The discharge naturally produces these
ions during particularly energetic collisions. The result, a gaslike mixture of positively
charged ions and negatively charged electrons, is called a plasma. A plasma is distinct
from a gas because its charged particles exert forces on one another over considerable
distances. All operating discharge lamps contain plasmas, including the neon sign that
we discussed earlier.
Since a typical fluorescent lamp must heat its electrodes red-hot to form its plasma, it
runs current through filaments at each end of its tubes (Fig. 13.2.6). Once the discharge is

discharge and it will need to be replaced. Because sputtering is particularly severe during
start-up, most fluorescent lamps fail after 10,000 to 40,000 starts. Since it takes energy to
construct each fluorescent lamp, turning a lamp off for only a short period, a few minutes
or less, wonât actually save energy in the long run. When youâll be returning to the room in
a couple of minutes, leave the fluorescent lights on. Otherwise, turn them off.
Fluorescent lamps operate most efficiently and are at their brightest when their internal
temperatures reach about 40 Â°C. Below that temperature, the vapor pressure of mercury is
too low and too much of the lampâs tiny store of mercury is liquid rather than gas. Thatâs
why most fluorescent lamps are somewhat dim when you first turn them on and they
brighten as they warm up from room temperature to about 40 Â°C. It takes time for the mercury vapor to reach its optimum density. Although this warm-up period is objectionable to
some people, itâs a small price to pay for a vastly more energy-efficient lighting.
It would be great if fluorescent lamps could be based on a substance less toxic than
mercury. However, mercury is uniquely well-suited to those lamps: its vapor pressure near
room temperature is nearly ideal for an electric discharge, it converts electric energy into
ultraviolet light with great efficiency, and it isnât damaged or consumed as the lamp operates. Much more important than eliminating mercury from fluorescent lamps is recycling
those lamps after they fail. Itâs not hard to extract and reuse the mercury, and it should be
done routinely.

Check Your Understanding #8: Getting Red-y
Why do the ends of some fluorescent lamps glow red during starting?
Answer: To start many lamps, their electrodes must be heated red-hot. You can often see light emitted by these hot filaments/electrodes.
Why: In most fluorescent fixtures, the filaments are heated to high temperatures just before the discharge starts. Thermal energy then ejects electrons from the filament so that they can carry current
through the gas.

Mercury, Metal-Halide, and Sodium Lamps
Whereas a low-pressure mercury discharge emits mostly ultraviolet light, a high-pressure
mercury discharge emits more visible light than ultraviolet light. This change occurs
because ultraviolet light becomes trapped in densely packed mercury atoms and only visible light is able to escape from the discharge.
Known as radiation trapping, this effect occurs because mercury atoms absorb 254-nm
photons just as well as they emit them. The same radiative transition that causes a mercury
atom to emit a 254-nm photon (6p â 6s) can also run backward to absorb that photon
(6s â 6p). In a dense gas of mercury, whenever one mercury atom emits a 254-nm photon,
another mercury atom snaps that photon up. So while the discharge keeps pouring energy
into the mercury atoms, they canât get rid of it as 254-nm photons. Instead, they emit most
of their energy through radiative transitions between other excited states. Since this light is
much less likely to be captured by other mercury atoms, it emerges from the lamp as bluish
visible light.

376

CHAPT ER 13 Light

When you first turn on a high-pressure mercury lamp, most of the mercury is liquid
and the pressure is low. The lamp starts like a small fluorescent tube without phosphor, so
you see very little visible light. However, the tube is designed to heat up during operation
so that the liquid mercury evaporates to form a dense gas. As the gas pressure rises, the
tubeâs color changes. The 254-nm photons become trapped and photons emitted by many
other radiative transitions begin to dominate. The lamp emits brilliant, blue-white light.
To make a lamp thatâs a little less bluish, some high-pressure mercury lamps contain
additional metal atoms. These atoms are introduced into the lamps as metal-iodide compounds, so they are often called metal-halide lamps. Sodium, thallium, indium, and scandium iodides all contribute their own emission spectra to the outgoing light and help to
strengthen the red end of its spectrum. They give metal-halide lamps a warmer color than
pure mercury lamps. Both high-pressure mercury and metal-halide lamps produce about 50
to 60 lumens per watt, making them almost as energy efficient as fluorescent lamps.
Pure sodium lamps resemble mercury lamps, except that they use sodium atoms.
Sodium is a solid at room temperature, so both low- and high-pressure sodium lamps must
heat up before they begin to operate properly. A low-pressure sodium lamp is extremely
energy efficient because its 590-nm light comes directly from a sodium atomâs strongest
radiative transition. That transition is from sodiumâs lowest excited state to its ground state
(3p â 3s). Low-pressure sodium lamps produce almost 200 lumens per watt, which is why
highways were frequently illuminated by their yellow-orange glow.
However, this monochromatic illumination is unpleasant and permits no color vision
at all. Although itâs marginally acceptable on a highway, you wouldnât want it near your
home. Thatâs why people buy high-pressure sodium lamps for home use (Fig. 13.2.7). For
a small decrease in energy efficiency, to about 150 lumens per watt, you get a big improvement in color.
Remarkably enough, the 590-nm emission itself smears out at high pressure to cover a
wide range of wavelengths, from yellow-green to orange-red. This spreading occurs
because of the many collisions suffered by the densely packed sodium atoms as they try to
emit 590-nm light. These collisions distort the atomic orbitals so that the photons emerge
with somewhat shifted energies. Overall, a high-pressure sodium lamp emits remarkably
little light exactly at 590 nm because the ground-state sodium atoms trap that light; they run
the (3p â 3s) transition backward and absorb the photons (3s â 3p). This trapping is so
effective that there is actually a hole in the lampâs spectrum right at 590 nm.

High-pressure discharge lamps suffer from a problem not found in low-pressure lamps:
theyâre difficult to start when hot. Itâs much harder to initiate a discharge in a high-pressure
gas than in a low-pressure gas, so they all start at low pressure and then evolve to high
pressure. If the discharge in a high-pressure mercury, sodium vapor, or metal-halide lamp
is interrupted and loses its plasma, the lamp must cool down before it can be restarted.
Check Your Understanding #9: Slow Glowing
At dusk, a mercury streetlight turns on. It glows dimly at first and gradually increases in brightness.
What is happening during this warm-up period?
Answer: The small high-pressure discharge tube is heating up, vaporizing more mercury.
Why: When the streetlight first turns on, the pressure of mercury atoms inside it is low and it emits
very little visible light. As the discharge heats the tube, more mercury atoms evaporate until eventually all the mercury inside the tube is gaseous.

Todayâs electronic devices have so many LEDs (light-emitting
diodes) that our homes are ablaze with tiny colored lights at night.
LEDs are quickly replacing lightbulbs in flashlights, and LED illumination is on the rise. LEDs combine the light-producing quantum transitions of discharge lamps with the solid-state physics of
modern electronics. In this section, weâll see how electrons
behave in solids and how those solids can be tailored to emit light.
Weâll also take a look at lasers. Since their invention in the
late 1950s, lasers have found countless uses, from cutting
metal and clearing human arteries to surveying land and playing
CDs and DVDs. However, lasers are more than just novel applications of old ideas. Instead, they bring together quantum and
optical physics to produce a new type of light. This light is
radically different from the light produced by incandescent and

Questions to Think About: Why is laser light usually brightly
colored? Why does laser light often appear as a narrow beam?
In movies, âlasersâ are often shown to emit bright streaks of
light that can be dodged if one jumps quickly enough; is that
view realistic?
Experiments to Do: Although lasers are household objects, the
ones in CD or DVD players and laser printers are relatively inaccessible. If you donât own a laser pointer, look at a store barcode
scanner. The scanning system contains a gas or solid-state laser
that emits a very narrow beam of bright red light. This system
also contains a rotating mirror or holographic disk that directs
the beam as a pattern of thin stripes onto anything that passes
through the scanner. A light sensor inside the window watches
for this moving beam of light to travel across a label. If you look
down at the laser light emerging from the scannerâs window or
observe the spot of a laser pointer on the wall, youâll see both
the purity of its color and its strange speckled character; the
light appears to consist of tiny light and dark speckles. These
speckles are caused by interference effects, which are extremely
pronounced in the ordered laser light. This light also appears
unusually bright and, as when looking at the sun, you should
keep your gaze brief to avoid eye injury.

WARNING
Laser light is dangerous. Because laser light can be extremely bright and can focus so
tightly, it presents a serious eye hazard. A laser beam entering your eye will focus to a
tiny spot on your retina and may cause rapid and permanent injury. Although lasers up
to Class III are relatively eye-safe, they rely on your natural blink reflex to protect you.
You should never stare into any laser. Class IV lasers are not eye-safe, and their light
should never enter your eyes at all.

Fig. 13.3.1 A conceptual
representation of the
levels (electron quantum
standing waves) in a solid.
Each level is a box holding
at most one spin-up
electron (blue) and one
spin-down electron (red).
The horizontal axis is
position and the vertical
axis is the energy of an
electron in a level. Because
levels form out of atomic
orbitals, levels made from
similar orbitals have similar
energies and group into
bands. For this portion of
the solid to be electrically
neutral, 140 positive
charges in its nuclei must
be cancelled by electrons
in these levels, so 140
electrons settle into them.

An LED is a solid-state deviceâthat is, itâs a solid object that luminesces. Like light from
a neon sign, light from an LED is produced when an electron shifts from a higher-energy
quantum state to a lower-energy quantum state by way of a radiative transition. In the neon
sign, those quantum states involve orbitals, the electron standing waves of an atom. In an
LED, however, those quantum states involve levels, the electron standing waves of a solid.
To understand how an LED emits light, we must start by understanding levels.
Solids are limited objects, and the basic quantum waves for electrons in limited objects
are always standing waves. The electron standing waves in atoms are called orbitals because
the positively charge nucleus wraps the negatively charged waves around itself in a manner
suggesting orbits. The electron standing waves in solids are less focused on specific atomic
nuclei and are called levels instead. Although the nuclei are present, of course, each electron is attracted to all the nuclei at once and that changes the nature of the standing waves.
As we did with orbitals, weâll view levels as abstract placeholders, independent of the
electrons that may or may not exhibit them at a given moment. The levels in a solid are then
analogous to seats in a theater, each of which may or may not be occupied right now.
Instead of saying that the electron is experiencing a particular standing wave or level, we
say that the level is occupied by an electron. In this reversed perspective, the level plays the
more important role.
Like an electron in an orbital, an electron in a level has a specific total energyâthe sum
of its kinetic and potential energies. That energy, which depends on the shape and structure
of the electron wave, also determines the waveâs quantum frequency (see Eq. 13.2.1).
A solid contains an enormous number of electrons, and there are always plenty of
levels around to accommodate those electrons. But which levels do they occupy?
At sufficiently low temperature, electrons occupy those levels that have the least
energy. For thermodynamic reasons, the electrons settle into the lowest-energy levels available, two electrons per level (recall the Pauli exclusion principle). By the time all the electrons have been accommodated, they fill the levels up to a certain maximum energy. Halfway between the highest filled level and lowest unfilled level is the Fermi level, a
hypothetical level that defines the top of this Fermi sea of electrons. The energy an electron
would have in that hypothetical level is called the Fermi energy.
Our theater analogy can again provide insight into this level-filling process. It is analogous to what happens at a popular show: the seats fill from the orchestra level on upâ
everyone wants to sit in the lowest (and closest) seat. When the show starts, people have
filled all the seats up to a certain highest seat. Halfway between that last filled seat and the
next unfilled seat is the hypothetical Fermi seat.
If we represent the levels graphically by boxes and arrange them vertically according
to energy (Fig. 13.3.1), then the levels (boxes) below the Fermi level contain two electrons

each, while those above the Fermi level are empty. Although thermal energy complicates
this picture somewhat by shifting electrons about near the Fermi level, we can ignore that
detail near room temperature or below.
Since levels are standing waves, they donât have sharply defined locations in space.
However, we can safely imagine that each level places its electrons near a particular location in the solid, as shown in Fig. 13.3.1. Although this picture is somewhat oversimplified,
itâs accurate enough to illustrate much of the physics of charge motion in materials.
Of course, electrons arenât the only charged particles in a solid. The atoms also have
positively charged nuclei. But those nuclei are essentially immobile and rarely participate
in the flow of electricity.
Check Your Understanding #1: Taking It to a Higher Level
If you add one extra electron to an otherwise neutral metal ball, into which level will that electron go?
Answer: The electron will go into the lowest-energy empty level, the one just above the Fermi level.
Why: Since each electron goes into the lowest-energy level thatâs available, this new electron will fill
the level just above the Fermi level. Actually, if the neutral metal ball has an odd number of electrons, then the Fermi level contains only one electron. In that case, the new electron will fill the other
opening in the Fermi level.

Metals, Insulators, and Semiconductors
The levels in a solid occur in groups called bands. Each band corresponds to standing
waves with a particular type of structure. Since the levels in a band involve similar waves,
they also involve similar energies. Between these bands of levels there are sometimes band
gaps, ranges of energy in which no levels exist. The solid does not and cannot contain
electrons with energies that lie within a band gap.
Bands and band gaps are what distinguish metals, insulators, and semiconductors.
When the Fermi level is located in a band gap, it can prevent the electrons in a solid from
responding to outside forces. To see how that happens, letâs examine first a metal and then
an insulator.
In a metal, the Fermi level lies in the middle of a band (Fig. 13.3.2). Because the
bandâs empty levels are just above its filled levels, very little energy is needed to shift electrons from the filled levels to empty levels. This feature allows the metal to conduct electricity. When you subject the metal to a voltage difference, giving its left side a higher
voltage than its right side, the resulting electric field points toward the right. That field
pushes the metalâs negatively charged electrons toward the left and they being to move left.
They move by shifting from filled levels to empty levels (Fig. 13.3.2), obtaining the energy
needed to reach those empty levels from the work done on them by the electrostatic forces.
Overall, electrons enter the metal from its right and leave from its left, so the metal conducts electricity!

In our theater analogy, a metal is a theater in which only about half the ground-floor
seats are filled. If you ask people in the theater to begin shifting left, those near the top of
the occupied seats can shift about easily. Each finds an empty seat nearby on the left and
moves over. New people are then able to enter the theater from the right while others leave
the theater from the left. This metal theater is conducting people.
Unlike the situation in a metal, in an insulator the Fermi level lies in the middle of a
band gap, between the top of one band and the bottom of another band (Fig. 13.3.3). With no
easily accessible empty levels available, a great deal of energy is required to shift electrons
from the filled levels to empty levels. When you subject the insulator to a voltage difference,
higher voltage on the left, the resulting electric field points toward the right and pushes the
insulatorâs electrons toward the left. Those electrons, however, have no empty levels nearby
and are thus unable to move. To shift into one of the empty levels in the upper band, an electron in the lower band would need more energy than it can get from the electrostatic forces.
Since no net charge flows through the insulator, it doesnât conduct electricity!
In our theater analogy, an insulator is a theater in which all the ground-floor seats are full
and the balcony seats are empty. When you ask people in this theater to begin shifting left,
they canât do it. All the ground-floor seats to the left are filled, and people canât reach the
balcony to make use of its empty seats. This insulator theater is unable to conduct people.
In a metal, the band of levels containing the Fermi level is only partially filled, and
electrons can easily shift from filled to unfilled levels. In an insulator, the band below the
Fermi levelâthe valence bandâis full and the band above the Fermi levelâthe conduction bandâis empty, making such shifts extremely difficult.
Even in an insulator, however, an electron can shift from a valence level (a level in the
valence band) to a conduction level (a level in the conduction band) if something provides
the necessary energy. One such energy source is light. When an insulator is exposed to the
right type of light, that light can shift electrons from the materialâs valence band to its conduction band (Fig. 13.3.4).

Once electrons appear in the normally empty conduction band and empty levels appear
in the normally full valence band, electrons can respond to electric fields. They can shift from
filled levels to nearby empty levels and thus travel through the material. Electrons can then
enter the material from one side and leave from the other, so the material conducts electricity.
Because light has made this insulator a conductor, we call the material a photoconductor.
Turning again to our analogy, lightâs role in the insulator theater is performed by a
playful gorilla that walks about the ground floor, tossing patrons into the balcony. With
some of the ground-floor seats suddenly empty and some of the balcony seats suddenly
occupied by dazed theatergoers, the crowd can now respond to your request to move left.
The gorilla has made the insulator theater a conductor of peopleâwhat you might call a
âgorillaconductor.â
Not all light causes photoconductivity in an insulator. As we saw in Section 13.2, light is
emitted and absorbed as particles called photons. Each photonâs energy is proportional to its
frequency; the higher the frequency of light, the more energy each of its photons contains. To
shift an electron across the large band gap in a typical insulator, high-energy, high-frequency
light is needed; the insulator must be exposed to violet or even ultraviolet light.
Nature also provides materials with smaller band gaps that can be crossed with the
help of low-energy, low-frequency red or even infrared light. These materials are called
semiconductors because their properties lie somewhere between those of conductors and
insulators. Semiconductors have small band gaps, making it relatively easy for light, heat,
or other types of energy to shift electrons between valence and conduction levels. In our
analogy, a semiconductor theater is an insulator theater with a low balcony, so that even a
baby gorilla can toss people into it.
For more than half a century, scientists and engineers have worked with semiconductors to produce an astonishing array of electronic devices. By carefully tailoring the shapes
and chemical compositions of semiconducting materials such as silicon, germanium, and
gallium arsenide, they have created virtuoso instruments for electron waves in solids that
are every bit as remarkable as the instruments for musical waves found in great orchestras.
Of all these electronic instruments, the simplest is the semiconductor diode.
Check Your Understanding #2: Stop and Go Shopping
In many grocery checkout counters, a conveyor belt carries food to the register but stops when the
food reaches the end and blocks a beam of light. How might a photoconductor be used to sense this
blockage?
Answer: The beam of light shines on the photoconductor, allowing it to carry current and turn on the
conveyer beltâs motor. When food blocks the light beam, the photoconductor becomes an electrical
insulator and the belt stops moving.
Why: Photoconductors are commonly used in light sensors. Light allows the photoconductor to carry
current, and that current can be used to operate machinery, trigger a burglar alarm, or turn lights on
or off. In the present case, it turns on the conveyor beltâs motor.

Diodes
A diode is a one-way device for current; it allows current to flow through it in one direction
but not in the other. Although diodes have taken many forms over the years, the diodes in
virtually all modern electronic devices are built from semiconductors.
A basic semiconductor diode is made by joining together two different semiconductors. These two semiconductors have been modified so that they donât have perfectly filled
valence levels and perfectly empty conduction levels. Instead, theyâre doped with atomic
impurities that either create a few empty valence levels (p-type semiconductor,
Fig. 13.3.5a) or place a few electrons in the conduction levels (n-type semiconductor,
Fig. 13.3.5b). These empty valence levels or conduction-level electrons allow p-type and
n-type semiconductors to conduct electricity.

When a piece of p-type semiconductor touches a piece of n-type semiconductor, however, something remarkable happensâa p-n junction forms at the place where the two
meet (Fig. 13.3.5c). To reduce their potential energies, higher-energy conduction-level
electrons from the n-type semiconductor migrate across the p-n junction to fill empty lowerenergy valence levels in the p-type semiconductor. Itâs an example of static electricity (see
Section 10.1); when two dissimilar materials touch, the material that is hungrier for electrons (the p-type semiconductor) steals some electrons from its partner (the n-type semiconductor).
As the electron migration proceeds, the n-type semiconductor acquires a positive net
charge because it now has fewer electrons than positive charges. The p-type semiconductor acquires a negative net charge because it now has more electrons than positive
charges. Electrostatic forces from this separated charge oppose the further migration of
electrons across the junction and gradually bring that migration to a halt. Everything is
then in equilibrium.
Near the p-n junction, there is now a depletion region, an area in which electron
migration has emptied all the conduction levels and filled all the valence levels. With no
conduction-level electrons or empty valence levels left, the depletion region canât conduct
electricity and charge canât move across the p-n junction. The depletion region is an insulator, and the two pieces of semiconductor have become a diode.
In our theater analogy, the p-n junction is analogous to a theater with two halves. In the
left or âp-typeâ half, the balcony is empty and even the ground floor has some empty seats.
In the right or ân-typeâ half, the ground floor is filled and there are even a few people in the
balcony. Since these two halves touch, people in the right balcony notice the empty seats in
the left ground floor, and a few of them near the center of the theater clamber down from
the right balcony to the left ground floor to take advantage of the better seats. Near the
center of the theater, the ground floor is now filled and the balcony is empty, forming a
depletion region in which no one can move left or right. The central part of the theater canât
conduct people!

LEDs and Lasers

383

Letâs now look at what happens when we attach wires to each semiconductor half and
use a battery to impose a voltage difference between those two halves. In Fig. 13.3.6a, the
voltage of the p-type side (left) is higher than the voltage of the n-type side (right), so the
resulting electric field points toward the right and pushes electrons toward the left. Electrons migrate toward the p-n junction in the n-type sideâs conduction levels and away from
the p-n junction in the p-type sideâs valence levels. At the same time, some electrons enter
the n-type side from its wire and some electrons exit the p-type side to its wire. The depletion region becomes thinner and, when the voltage difference is large enough, vanishes
altogether. Once that happens, electrons begin to cross the p-n junction and the entire
device and it conducts electric current.
In the theater analogy, weâre adding people on the right to the n-type balcony and
removing them on the left from the p-type ground floor. The new people in the n-type balcony can move about the empty seats and migrate toward the center of the theater. Similarly, the empty seats in the p-type ground floor allow people to shift about so that empty
seats become available near the center of the theater. At that point, people in the n-type
balcony can cross over to the p-type balcony and then jump down to the ground floor. There
is a net leftward flow of people through the theater; the theater is conducting people from
right to left.
What happens if we reverse the battery? In Fig. 13.3.6b, the voltage of the n-type side
(right) is higher than the voltage of the p-type side (left), so the resulting electric field points
toward the left and pushes electrons toward the right. In this case, the depletion region
becomes thicker as the electrons fill in the empty valence levels in the p-type side and leave
the conduction levels in the n-type side. The widening depletion region prevents charge from
moving and no current flows across the p-n junction. The device remains an insulator.
In the theater analogy, weâre removing people on the right from the n-type balcony and
adding them on the left to the p-type ground floor. Soon the n-type balcony is virtually
empty and the p-type ground floor is essentially full. The entire theater is now a depletion
region and behaves like the insulator theater. No one can move and the theater canât conduct people.

Since it allows current to flow in one direction but not the other, the p-n junction is a
diode. For historical reasons, the diodeâs p-type side is called the anode and its n-type side
is called the cathode. Current, which is the flow of positive charge, can pass through a
diode only from its anode to its cathode. Since current naturally flows from higher voltage
to lower voltage, a diode carries current only when it is forward biased, that is, when its
anode has a higher voltage than its cathode. When it is reverse biased, when its anode has
a lower voltage than its cathode, no current flows through the diode.
Check Your Understanding #3: Itâs a One-Way Street
What will happen if you include a p-n junction (a diode) in the AC circuit that connects the power
company to your table lamp?
Answer: Current will flow through the circuit only half the time, and your lamp will be dim.
Why: If you include a diode in an AC circuit, it will prevent current from flowing in one direction.
Current will flow through the circuit only during the half of each power-line cycle when the diodeâs
cathode is negatively charged and its anode positively charged. Since the lamp will receive only about
half of its normal power, its filament wonât reach normal operating temperature. The lamp will glow
dimly but the bulb will last an extraordinarily long time. Diodes are often used in this manner to
create dim light levels in lamps or appliances.

Light-Emitting Diodes
Even when a diode is forward biased, its depletion region doesnât vanish until the voltage
of its anode is significantly higher than the voltage of its cathode. For the ordinary silicon
diodes commonly used in AC adapters and computer power supplies, a voltage drops of
0.6 V is required before theyâll conduct current. Since the current passing through the diode
is then experiencing a voltage drop, the diode is consuming electric power. Because the
diodes used in adapters and power supplies serve only as switches to control the direction
of current flow, the electric power consumed by these diodes is simply converted into thermal power. But some specialized diodes are designed to convert much of the electric power
they consume into optical powerâthey emit light!
When a diode is forward biased and current flows from its anode to its cathode,
conduction-level electrons in the n-type cathode travel across the p-n junction to become
conduction-level electrons in the p-type anode. In effect, the anode is then in an excited
state; it has conduction-level electrons and empty valence levels (Fig. 13.3.6a).
What happens next depends on the characteristics of the diode. In a normal silicon
diode, those conduction-level electrons shift to empty valence levels without producing
significant light. Siliconâs band structure has characteristics that discourage light emission,
so most of these electron transitions produce internal vibrations and heat the diode instead
of producing light.
In specialized diodes made from more exotic semiconductors, conduction-level electrons injected from the n-type cathode into the p-type anode frequently undergo radiative
transitions to empty valence levels and thereby emit light (Fig. 13.3.7). Composed primarily from combinations of gallium, indium, aluminum, arsenic, phosphorus, and nitrogen,
they are known as light-emitting diodes, or LEDs. LEDs now come in just about any color
of the rainbow, including infrared, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, and ultraviolet
(Fig. 13.3.8). Although white LEDs are also common, theyâre actually violet or ultraviolet
LEDs with built-in phosphors that fluoresce white.
An LEDâs color is directly related to the energy released when an electron in its p-type
anode shifts from a conduction level to a valence level. The most convenient unit in which
to measure that energy is the electron volt (abbreviated eV), the energy released when 1
elementary unit of electric charge experiences a 1-V decrease in voltage (1 eV is equal to
1.6021 Ă 10â19 J). In a typical red LED, an electron releases 1.9 eV as it shifts from a conduction level to a valence level and can produce a photon with an energy of 1.9 eV. Since

Fig. 13.3.7 When current flows through the p-n junction of light-emitting diode, conduction-level
electrons from the n-type cathode are injected into conduction levels of the p-type anode. In the
anode, those conduction-level electrons can shift to empty valence levels and release energy. About
half the time, a radiative transition converts that energy into a photon of light.

energy and frequency are related by Eq. 13.2.1 and frequency and wavelength are related by
Eq. 9.2.1, that 1.9-eV photon has a frequency of 4.6 Ă 1014 Hz and a wavelength of 650 nm.
To operate and produce these 1.9-eV photons, the red LED must be forward biased
with a voltage drop of at least 1.9 V. The current-carrying diode uses that voltage drop to
inject electrons into the anodeâs conduction band, where they have energies 1.9 eV above
the valence band. Many of those electrons subsequently release their excess energies as
1.9-eV photons of light.
The shorter the wavelength of the light an LED emits, the more energy each electron
must release as it shifts from a conduction level to a valence level and the larger the
semiconductorâs band gap must be. A violet LED that emits 400-nm light requires a band
gap of about 3.1 eV to produce its 3.1-eV photons. That LED also needs a forward-bias
voltage in excess of 3.1 V. The larger voltage drops required by LEDs near the violet end
of the spectrum explain why those LEDs need higher-voltage power sources or more
batteries.
Unfortunately, at most about half of the electrons sent across an LEDâs p-n junction
succeed in lighting the room. Although a substantial fraction of those electrons emit photons, most of the photons are reabsorbed by the semiconductor before they leave the LED;
the same radiative transitions that emit this light (conduction level â valence level) can
also absorb it (valence level â conduction level). Despite those difficulties, modern LEDs
can produce visible light with energy efficiencies comparable to those of fluorescent lamps.
LED efficiencies continue to rise along with their operating lifetimes, and they are gradually becoming a primary form of illumination.

Fig. 13.3.8 These LEDs are
connected in series so that the same
current flows sequentially through
each of them. However, their different
band gaps cause them to emit
different colors of light.

When you increase the current flowing through an incandescent lightbulb, it brightens and its color
shifts toward the blue end of the spectrum. If you increase the current flowing through an LED, what
happens to its brightness and color?
Answer: The diode becomes brighter, but its color doesnât change significantly.
Why: The diodeâs brightness depends on how many electrons cross its p-n junction each second, and
increasing that number increases the brightness. However, the color of light the diode emits depends
mostly on its band gap and therefore doesnât change much when you increase the current in the
diode.

To understand lasers, you must understand how laser light differs from the normal light emitted by hot objects or by individual atoms in an electrical discharge. Each particle of normal
light, each photon, is emitted willy-nilly without any relationship to the other light particles
being emitted nearby. Because of this lightâs independent and unpredictable character, itâs
called spontaneous light and its creation is called spontaneous emission of radiation.
Theoretical work by Albert Einstein and others in the 1920s and 1930s predicted the
existence of a second type of light, stimulated light, that can be created when an excited
atom or atomlike system duplicates a passing photon. Although this stimulated emission
of radiation can occur only when the excited atom is capable of emitting the duplicate
photon spontaneously, the copy that it produces is so perfect that the two photons are absolutely indistinguishable. Together, these two photons form a single electromagnetic wave.
To get a slightly better picture of how such stimulation occurs, think about an isolated
atom in an excited state. That atom will eventually return to its ground state, but it must
emit one or more photons for this to happen. That atom waits around in the excited state
until it begins a spontaneous radiative transition. During the transition, one of the atomâs
electrons accelerates back and forth, and the atom emits a photon.
If a similar photon passes through the atom as itâs waiting in the excited state, that
photonâs electric field can stimulate the radiative transition process through sympathetic
vibration. The field pushes and pulls on the atomâs electrons and makes them accelerate
back and forth. Although this effect is small, it may be enough to trigger the emission of
light. If the atom does emit light, the photon it produces will be a perfect copy of the stimulating photon.
When this stimulated emission process was first discovered, people immediately recognized that it made light amplification possible. If enough excited systems could be
assembled together, a single passing photon could be duplicated exactly over and over
again. Instead of a single particle of light, you would soon have thousands, or millions, or
even trillions of identical light particles.
Implementing this idea had to wait until the late 1950s, however, when the technical
details of how to actually achieve light amplification were worked out. In 1960, the first
laser oscillators were constructed. These were devices that emitted intense beams of light
in which each particle of light was identical to every other particle of light. A single particle
of light had been duplicated by the stimulation process into countless copies.
When individual excited atoms or atomlike systems emit light through spontaneous
emission, the particles of light head off separately as many independent electromagnetic
waves (Fig. 13.3.9a). Light consisting of many independent electromagnetic waves is
called incoherent light.
However, when that same collection of excited atoms or atomlike systems emit light
by stimulated emission, all of the light particles are absolutely identical and form a single
electromagnetic wave (Fig. 13.3.9b). Unlike electrons, which are Fermi particles, many
identical photons can have the same quantum wave because photons are Bose particles and

LEDs and Lasers

Bose particles donât obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Light consisting of many identical
photons and a single electromagnetic wave is called coherent light. Because of its singlewave nature, coherent light exhibits remarkable interference effects. These effects are easily seen in the coherent light emitted by lasers.
Check Your Understanding #5: A Light Dusting of Photons
If you were to measure the electric field in the light from a flashlight, you would find that it fluctuates
about randomly. Why is the lightâs electric field so disorderly?
Answer: The flashlight produces incoherent light, with many independent light waves contributing
their individual electric fields to the overall electric field. When you were to measure that overall field,
you find it very disorderly.
Why: Because the photons of incoherent light are independent, their individual electric fields donât
fluctuate together. At any place and time, the individual electric fields will add in a complicated,
random fashion. As time passes, this overall field will fluctuate randomly. In contrast, coherent light,
in which each photon is the same as all the others, has a much more orderly electric field because
all of the photons contribute equally.

Laser medium

Dim light

Producing coherent light requires amplification. You must start with only one particle of light
and duplicate it many times. The basic tool for this duplication of light is a laser amplifier
(Fig. 13.3.10). When weak light enters an appropriate collection of excited atoms or atomlike
systemsâthe laser mediumâthat light is amplified and becomes brighter. The new light has
exactly the same characteristics as the original light, but it contains more photons.
When we think of lasers, however, we rarely imagine a device that duplicates photons
from somewhere else. We usually picture one that creates light entirely on its own. To do
that, the laser must produce the initial particle of light that it then duplicates to produce
others. A laser oscillator is a device that uses the laser medium itself to provide the seed
photon, which it then duplicates many times (Fig. 13.3.11). If a laser medium is enclosed
in a pair of carefully designed mirrors, itâs possible for the stimulation process to become
self-initiating and self-sustaining. However, the mirrors must be curved properly and must
have the correct reflectivities. One mirror must normally be extremely reflective, while the
other must transmit a small fraction of the light that strikes its surface.
When the laser medium is placed between the two mirrors, there is a chance that a
photon, emitted spontaneously by one of the excited systems, will bounce off a mirror and
return toward the laser medium. As that returning photon passes through the laser medium,
itâs amplified. Because the photon was emitted by one of the excited systems, it has the
right wavelength to be amplified by other excited systems. (For a discussion of a photonâs
properties, see 5 .)
By the time the original photon leaves the laser medium, it has already been duplicated
many times. This group of identical photons then bounces off the second mirror and returns
for another pass through the laser medium. It continues to bounce back and forth between
the mirrors until the number of identical photons in the collection is astronomical.
Eventually there are so many identical photons that the laser medium is no longer able
to amplify them. The laser medium has only so much stored energy and only so many
excited systems in it. If the laser medium continues to receive additional energy, it may
continue to amplify the light somewhat. If it doesnât receive more energy, light amplification will eventually cease.
To let the light out of this laser oscillator, one of its mirrors is normally semitransparentâ
that is, some of the photons that strike the surface of the mirror travel through it rather than
reflecting. (The one-way glass used for surveillance is actually a semitransparent mirror.)
This transmission creates a beam of outgoing light, a laser beam. The laser beam continues
to emerge from the mirror as long as the amplification process can support it.

5 Although it might seem
that a photon should have
an exact wavelength and
frequency, and travel in
only one direction, thatâs
not the case. Photons
travel as electromagnetic
waves and spread in more
than a single direction.
Also, because each photon
has a beginning and an
end, its wave contains
more than a single
wavelength or a single
frequency. Thus, while
lasers can produce some
of the most perfect

imaginable, those waves
still spread outward
slightly and still have a
range of wavelengths and

Because this laser beam consists of duplicates of one original photon, it is coherent
light. For technical reasons, many lasers duplicate more than one original photon simultaneously, so their laser beams are a little less coherent than they might be. However, with
suitable fine-tuning, one original photon can usually be made to dominate the laser beam.
When you focus a flashlightâs beam with a lens, its independent photons wonât end up
exactly together at the focus of the lens. Thatâs because the photons leave the flashlight
heading in somewhat different directions and because their broad range of wavelengths
leads to dispersion problems in the lens. However, since virtually all the photons in a laser
beam are identicalâthey travel along the same path, and their wavelengths are the sameâ
they can all focus together to an extremely small spot. Thatâs why a laser printer employs
a laser; a laser beam can illuminate a very small spot on the photoconductor drum that is
used in the xerographic process (Section 10.2) to produce a printed image.
COMMON M ISCON CE P T I ON S : Laser Beams
Misconception: A laser beam is a narrow glowing cylinder that travels through space at the speed
of an arrow.
Resolution: A laser beam is light, and it travels through space at the speed of light. To be visible
from the side, a laser beam must scatter off something in its path, such as dust, mist, or air
molecules. In empty space, a laser beam is invisible except when it directly illuminates your eyes.

Check Your Understanding #6: More of a Good Thing
If you take the laser beam from a particular laser oscillator and send it through a similar laser amplifier, what will happen to the laser beam?
Answer: It will become even brighter.
Why: A laser oscillator normally emits as intense a beam of light as it can, based on the amount of
stored energy in the laser medium. This beam of light can be amplified further by sending it through
a separate laser amplifier. Most high-powered lasers use a laser oscillator and one or more laser
amplifiers to create particularly bright beams of light.

Ground state
Fig. 13.3.12 An ideal
laser system passes
through four different
states during the laserâs
operation.

Obtaining the excited systems needed to amplify light is a critical issue for lasers. Ideally,
a laser involves four different states of an atom or atomlike system: the ground state, an
excited state, the upper laser state, and the lower laser state. The reason for having four
separate states should become clear in a moment.
Letâs consider an atom that acts as an ideal laser amplifier (Fig. 13.3.12). The atom
starts in its ground state. A collision or the absorption of a photon shifts it to the excited
state, giving it the energy it needs to amplify light. The atom then shifts to the upper laser
state, either by emitting a photon or as the result of a collision. This preliminary shift is
important because it prevents the excited atom from returning directly to the ground state
and avoiding the amplification process. Once it has shifted to the upper laser state, the atom
is stuck there and will wait around long enough to amplify light.
The atom is poised to duplicate a passing photon. But not any old photon will do; it
must match the photons that the atom is capable of emitting. For example, a neon atom
with an excited 3p electron (Section 13.2) can duplicate a red photon but not a blue
photon. This color selectivity of a laser amplifier is why most laser beams have a single,
pure color.
When a suitable photon passes through the atom, that photon stimulates the emission
of a duplicate photon and the atom undergoes a radiative transition to the lower laser
state. So far, so good. However, if the atom remains in the lower laser state, it might

LEDs and Lasers

absorb a photon of the laser light and return to the upper laser state. To prevent this sort
of radiation trapping, the atom must quickly shift to the ground state, either by emitting
a photon or as the result of another collision. The atom is then ready to begin the cycle
all over again.
This four-state cycle, or something close to it, is found in nearly all lasers. The
cycle helps the laser develop a population inversion between its upper and lower laser
states, a situation in which there are more atoms in the upper laser state prepared to emit
the laser light than there are atoms in the lower laser state prepared to absorb that light.
Developing a population inversion is critical to laser amplification because, without it,
the laser medium is more absorbing than amplifying and there canât be a buildup of light
intensity.
In each laser, something provides the energy needed to shift atoms or atomlike systems
in the laser medium from their ground states to their excited states in order to develop a population inversion. This transfer of energy into the laser medium to prepare it for amplifying
light is called pumping. How a particular laser medium is pumped depends on the laser.
The most common pumping mechanisms are electronic and optical. In electronic
pumping, currents of charged particles use their kinetic or electrostatic energies to excite
the mediumâs atoms or atomlike systems from their ground states to their excited states. In
optical pumping, intense light is shone on the laser medium, causing a similar excitation.
The most important examples of optical pumping are ion-doped solid-state lasers.
These lasers are based on atomic ions embedded in transparent solids. Common ions are
titanium (Ti), neodymium (Nd), and erbium (Er), and they are often embedded in sapphire,
yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG), or glass. Ti:sapphire, Nd:YAG, and Er:glass lasers are
important in modern research, technology, and optical communications systems. When
these laser media are exposed to extremely bright light, their ions become excited and they
can act as laser oscillators or amplifiers (Figs. 13.3.13 and 13.3.14).
A laser diode is quite similar to an LED, except that a laser diode uses its radiative
transitions to amplify light. Since that amplification can occur only when light emission
exceeds light absorption, the laser diode must produce a population inversion between an
upper laser state and a lower laser state.
The laser diode achieves such an inversion by concentrating current into a very narrow
p-n junction made from heavily doped semiconductors. The intense current injects an enormous density of electrons into the anodeâs conduction band, where they quickly settle into
the lowest-energy conduction levelsâthe upper laser state. The heavy doping empties most
of the anodeâs highest-energy valence levelsâthe lower laser state. With many electrons in
the upper laser state and few in the lower laser state, the diode has a population inversion
and can amplify light.

Most laser diodes act as laser oscillators (Fig. 13.3.15), amplifying their own spontaneously emitted light until it forms an intense coherent beam. The ends of the anode itself
are usually reflective enough to act as mirrors and form a complete laser oscillator. However, to concentrate the laser light in one direction and to control its beam characteristics,
many laser diodes have complicated structures and coatings.

A secret agent in a movie uses a tiny hand-held laser to burn a hole through a thick metal plate. From
the point of view of power, why is such a laser essentially impossible to make?
Answer: The light in such a laser beam would carry an enormous amount of power. Something must
transfer that power to the laser medium, an impossible task in a tiny hand-held unit.
Why: The power in a laser beam comes from the laser medium. The laser medium must have gotten
it from somewhere else. Since batteries arenât up to delivering thousands of watts of electric power,
itâs unlikely that powerful hand-held lasers will ever be developed. Even if a suitable power source
were available, these lasers would tend to overheat. The conversion of power to light is not perfectly
efficient, and most of the energy ends up as thermal energy in the laserâs components. Lasers require
cooling to remove this wasted energy.

Epilogue for Chapter 13
In this chapter, we explored the creation and movement of light. In Sunlight, we looked at
how light is scattered during its passage through the atmosphere and at how it bends and
reflects when it moves from one material to another. We also examined the interference
effects that occur when a light wave follows more than one path to a particular destination
and learned how polarizing sunglasses can diminish glare.
In Discharge Lamps, we examined electrical discharges in gases. We saw that atoms
excited by collisions with charged particles can subsequently emit light through radiative
transitions. We studied the primary colors of light to see how the phosphors on the inside
surface of a fluorescent tube are able to produce a reasonable facsimile of white sunlight.
In LEDs and Lasers, we looked at how electrons can emit light after crossing a junction between two different types of semiconductor, and we looked at the difference between
common incoherent light and the unusual coherent light emitted by a laser. We saw that
lasers use stimulated emission to duplicate photons so that a small number of initial photons can be amplified into an enormous number.

Explanation: Splitting the Colors of Sunlight
Light bends as it passes through the cut facets of the crystal glass or bowl. Because of dispersion, the angle of each bend depends slightly on the wavelength of the light involved, so
the different colors of sunlight follow slightly different paths through the crystal. When the

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations

391

light emerges from the crystal, its various wavelengths head in somewhat different directions; you see colors. Color sequences progress from long wavelength to short wavelength,
or vice versa. You see red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, or the reverseâ
the colors of the rainbow.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Sunlight Works: Sunlight originates at the 5800 K outer surface of the sun when
electrically charged particles there accelerate back and forth rapidly and emit electromagnetic waves. This sunlight travels at the speed of light through empty space until it
reaches Earthâs atmosphere. There it slows slightly and some of it Rayleigh-scatters.
Short-wavelength light is Rayleigh-scattered more strongly than long-wavelength light,
so the sky appears blue.
As the sunlight passes through various objects, it slows down and its colors separate. When sunlight passes through falling raindrops, its different wavelengths follow
different paths and create rainbows. As sunlight reflects from thin films such as soap
bubbles, its waves are divided and may follow several different paths to the same destination. These light waves then interfere with one another so that some waves appear
strong and bright while others are weak and dim. Interference depends on the wavelengths of light, so thin films appear brightly colored.
How Discharge Lamps Work: Discharge lamps produce light by passing electric currents
through gases. Those gases are turned into electrical-conducting plasmas by filling
them with charged particles, either by exposing them to strong voltage gradients or by
injecting electrons into them from heated electrodes. Once a plasma is formed, current
can pass through it and collisions within that current-carrying plasma cause the gas
particles to emit light.
A fluorescent lamp emits visible light when the phosphor coating on the inside of its
tube is exposed to 254-nm ultraviolet light produced inside the tube by a low-pressure
mercury vapor discharge. This ultraviolet light excites the phosphor coating and causes
it to emit visible light. In contrast, mercury, metal-halide, and sodium lamps use discharges to produce visible light directly and donât employ phosphors. By operating at
high pressures, those discharge lamps produce relatively broad light spectra and provide
energy-efficient illumination.
How LEDs and Lasers Work: In an LED, light is emitted when conduction-level electrons
from the diodeâs cathode cross the p-n junction into the anode and undergo radiative
transitions to empty valence levels. The color of light produced by the LED is determined primarily by the anodeâs band gap.
Lasers amplify light through the process of stimulated emission. In this process,
energy is transferred to atoms or atomlike systems contained in a laser medium. These
excited systems might emit light spontaneously, and they can be stimulated into emitting duplicates of a passing photon. When a photon with just the right wavelength
passes through an excited system, that system is likely to give up its stored energy by
emitting an exact copy of the initial photon. In a laser oscillator, two mirrors cause light
to bounce back and forth through the laser medium. An initial photon is duplicated
endlessly to produce coherent light. One of the mirrors is semitransparent so that part
of the light emerges from the laser as a laser beam.
1. Pauli exclusion principle: No two indistinguishable Fermi

particles ever occupy the same quantum wave.
2. Relationship between energy and frequency: The energy in

a photon of light is equal to the Planck constant times the

frequency of the light wave, or
energy = Planck constant Âˇ frequency.

Optics and Electronics
any of the devices around us perform useful tasks by manipulating light, charge, or both.
The techniques of optics deal with light and allow cameras to record images of the objects
in front of them, our eyes to observe those objects directly, and eyeglasses and magnifying
glasses to help us see details weâd miss with our eyes alone. The techniques of electronics deal
with charge and permit an audio playerâs memory to store sound information, its computer to
retrieve that information, and its amplifier and headphones to re-create the sound at the push of
a button.
Optical tools such as lenses and prisms have been around for hundreds of years, and electronic
devices such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors also have a long history. Advances of modern
technology, however, have accelerated developments in both fields. The invention of lasers has sped
the growth of the optics industry and the invention of transistors has revolutionized the world of
electronics. Rapid progress in both fields, optics and electronics, has brought them closer together
and has given birth to the combined field of optoelectronics. There is even hope that one day computers will be as much optical devices as they are electronic.

these sorts of manipulation of light and charge: (1) cameras,
(2) optical recording and communication, and (3) audio players.
In Cameras, we see how lenses bend light to form images and
how those images are used to create photographs. In Optical

In the two centuries since their invention, cameras have become
extremely easy to use. What started as a hobby for a few dedicated enthusiasts has evolved into an everyday activity. Despite
all the technological improvements, however, photography still
employs many of the same principles it did in the 1800s.
Cameras still use lenses to project images onto light-sensitive
surfaces, and photographers still have to worry about getting
the exposure right, focusing properly, and avoiding the blur of
rapid motion. In this section, weâll explore some of the principles
that make cameras work.
Questions to Think About: Why are expensive camera lenses
so complicated, with so many separate pieces of glass? Why

Experiments to Do: The basic activity of a cameraâprojecting
an image of the scene in front of you onto its image sensorâ
requires nothing more than a simple magnifying glass. In fact,
you can use almost any simple lens thatâs bowed outward in
the middle, including the eyeglasses of a farsighted person
with no astigmatism or drugstore reading glasses. Stand in a
darkened room across from a single bright lamp. Hold a sheet
of white paper so that it faces the lamp and move the lens
back and forth in front of the paper. Make sure that the lens
itself is also facing the lamp.
You should find a distance at which the lens casts a clear
image of the lamp onto the sheet of paper. Youâll find that the
lamp appears upside down and backwards and that the image
becomes fuzzy if you move the lens toward or away from the
paper. Youâll also find that, when the lampâs image is sharp, the
images of things in front of or behind the lamp are fuzzy, and
vice versa. Which way must you move the lens to bring more
distant or less distant objects into focus?
Cut a hole in a piece of cardboard and use it to cover all
but the center portion of the lens. The image of the lamp will
now be substantially darker, but it will also be sharper over a
wider range of distances from lens to paper. If the hole is narrow enough, virtually everything is in focus at once. Evidently,
the diameter of the lens and its ability to focus on several
things at once are closely related. Why?

Fig. 14.1.1 (a) Without
a lens, light from a candle
uniformly illuminates an
image sensor. (b) When a
lens is introduced between
the candle and the sensor,
it brings light from each
point on the candle back
together on the sensorâs
surface, forming an upside
down and backward real
image of the candle. The
distance between the lens
and the sensor must be
chosen correctly or the
image will be blurry.

When you take a picture of the scene in front of you, the lens of your camera bends light
from that scene into a real image on a light-sensitive surface. A real image is a pattern of
light, projected in space or on a surface, that exactly reproduces the pattern of light in the
original scene. Since the real image thatâs projected looks just like the scene youâre photographing, recording the light in that image is equivalent to recording the appearance of the
scene itself.
That light-sensitive surface was at one time always photographic film, but now digital
cameras have almost completely replaced film with electronic image sensors. Fortunately,
the two light-sensing surfaces are essentially interchangeable, so we can refer to them both
as image sensors: one is electronic, and one is photochemical.
Real images donât occur without help. When light from a candle falls directly on an
image sensor, it produces only diffuse illumination (Fig. 14.1.1a). Similarly, you canât tell
by looking at a sheet of paper what a candle looks like because the light that leaves the
candle travels in all directions and is as likely to hit the top of the paper as it is to hit the
bottom (Fig. 14.1.1b).
Thatâs why a camera needs a lens, a transparent object that uses refraction to form
images. The light passing through a lens bends twice, once as it enters the glass or
plastic and again as it leaves. In a camera lens, this bending process brings much of the
light from one point on the candle back together at one point on the sensor. As you can
see in Fig. 14.1.2, the real image that forms is upside down and backward. This inversion
of the real image relative to the object always happens when a single lens creates a
real image.
The curved shape of the camera lens allows it to form a real image. Light passing
through the upper half of the lens is bent downward, while light passing through the lower
half is bent upward. Because the camera lens bends light rays toward one another, itâs a
converging lens. You can see how it forms an image in Fig. 14.1.2b by following some of
the rays of light leaving one point on the candle.
The upper ray from the candle flame travels horizontally toward the top of the lens. As
it enters the lens and slows down, this ray of light bends downward. It bends downward
again as it leaves the lens and travels downward toward the bottom of the image sensor.
The lower ray from the candle flame travels downward toward the bottom of the lens
and bends upward as it enters the lens. It bends upward again as it leaves the lens and travels horizontally toward the bottom of the image sensor.
These two rays of light reach the image sensor at the same point. They are joined there
by many other rays from the same part of the candle flame so that a bright spot forms on
the sensor. Overall, each part of the candle illuminates a particular spot on the image sensor, so the lens creates a complete image of the candle on the sensor.

Focus

However, the lens can bring the light back together to form a sharp image on the sensor
only if the lens and sensor are separated by just the right distance (Fig. 14.1.3). If the sensor
is too close to the lens, then the light doesnât have room to come together. If the sensor is
too far from the lens, then the light begins to come apart again before reaching the sensor.
In either case, the image on the sensor is blurry. The candleâs real image is only in focus at
one distance from the lens.
If the candle moves toward or away from the camera lens, the distance between the
lens and the image sensor must also change (Fig. 14.1.4). When the candle is far away, all
its light rays that pass through the lens arrive traveling almost parallel to one another and
the inward bend caused by the lens makes those rays converge together quickly. The rays
come into focus relatively near the lens, and thatâs where the sensor must be (Fig. 14.1.4a).
The candleâs image on the sensor is much smaller than the candle itself because the light
rays have only a short distance over which to move up or down after leaving the lens.
When the candle is nearby, its light rays that pass through the lens are diverging rapidly and the inward bend caused by the lens is just barely enough to make those rays converge at all. As a result, the rays come into focus relatively far from the lens (Fig. 14.1.4b).
The candleâs image on the sensor is quite large because the light rays have considerable
distance over which to move up or down after leaving the lens.
Because distant and nearby objects form real images at different distances from the
camera lens, they canât both be in focus on the same image sensor. When you take a picture
of a person standing in front of a mountain, only one of them can be in sharp focus. However, if youâre willing to compromise a little bit on sharpness, a lens can sometimes form
acceptable images of both objects.

Check Your Understanding #1: Seeing the Lights
If you hold a magnifying glass at the proper distance above a sheet of white paper, you will see an
image of the overhead room lights on the paper. Explain.
Answer: It is a real image of the room lights, created by the converging magnifying glass.
Why: A magnifying glass is a converging lens and can form a real image. It brings light spreading
outward from the room lights together onto the sheet of paper as a real image.

Focusing and Lens Diameter
A disposable camera is little more than a box with a lens. The lens projects a real image of
the scene in front of it onto the cameraâs image sensor. Light in the real image exposes the
image sensor, which records the image permanently. While it may also have a shutter that
starts and stops the exposure, a flash to provide extra light, and a mechanism that prepares
for the next photograph, thereâs little else to this simple camera.
However, there are limitations to the disposable camera design. One of the most severe
limitations is that you canât focus itâthe camera has a fixed distance between the lens and image
sensor. Nonetheless, it manages to form relatively sharp real images on the sensor, even when
there are objects at various distances from the camera. These simple cameras work because they
use narrow (small-diameter) lenses. A narrow lens gathers less light than a wide lens, but it
doesnât require focusing, adjusting the distance between the lens and the image sensor.
Because a wide (large-diameter) lens brings rays together from many different directions, you must focus it (Fig. 14.1.5a); if the image sensor is even slightly too near or too
far from the lens, the recorded image will be blurry. In contrast, a narrow lens forms a
reasonably clear image even without focusing. Any rays from one part of the scene that
succeed in passing through the narrow lens must already be fairly close together. Their
initial closeness means that these converging rays illuminate only a small part of the image
sensor even when the sensor isnât exactly the right distance from the lens (Fig. 14.1.5b).

Since the image sensor canât record every minute detail anyway, the image that forms on it
doesnât have to be in absolutely perfect focus. As a result, a camera with a narrow lens and
no focus adjustment manages to take pretty good pictures.
Unfortunately, these simple cameras collect very little light and need extremely lightsensitive image sensors. These high-speed sensors canât record photographs that are as
sharp as low-speed sensors can. Furthermore, the pictures produced by simple cameras
lack fine details; although everything is almost in focus, most things are a bit fuzzy if you
look carefully or make enlargements.
More sophisticated cameras use wider lenses that gather more light and expose the image
sensors much more rapidly. They also automatically adjust the distance between the lens and
the sensor. They identify the object you are photographing and position the camera lens so that
it projects a sharp image on the sensor. As the camera focuses, you can usually see components
in the lens moving backward or forward to arrive at the correct distance from the sensor.
Even a camera with a wide lens can take advantage of the narrow lens trick for focusing.
Its lens contains an internal diaphragm that reduces its aperture, or effective diameter. The
diaphragm is a ring of metal strips with a central opening. These strips can swing in or out, changing the diameter of the diaphragmâs opening and with it the aperture of the lens (Fig. 14.1.6).
When its lens aperture is narrow, the sophisticated camera imitates a simple cameraâ
nearly everything is essentially in focus simultaneously. In such a situation, the camera has
a large depth of focus. Actually, the sophisticated camera can bring the most important
object into perfect focus, so it produces pictures that are superior to those from simple
cameras. However, narrowing the aperture of the lens also reduces the amount of light
reaching the image sensor. The scene in front of the camera must either be very bright or
the exposure must be relatively long. You donât get something for nothing.
Although widening the aperture of a large lens makes full use of its light-gathering
capacity, focusing then becomes crucial. Even a small error in the lens-to-sensor distance
produces a blurry picture, so the depth of focus is very small. This trade-off between light
gathering and depth of focus is a continual struggle for photographers. However, photographers sometimes take advantage of the small depth of focus in wide lenses to blur the
background or foreground of a photograph deliberately. A cameraâs portrait setting adopts
this strategy to produce sharp images of people against blurred backgrounds.
At other times, photographers choose long exposures at narrow apertures to bring an
entire scene into sharp focus. A cameraâs landscape setting takes this route, so everything in
the photograph shows full detail. To capture fast motion while retaining a large depth of
focus, photographers use a flash to brighten the scene and shorten the exposure. Unfortunately, a camera flash is ineffective at brightening a distant scene, and it can produce unpleasant reflections from windows and eyes. A cameraâs sports setting emphasizes brief exposures
to avoid speed blur, even though that may require a wide aperture and small depth of focus.
Check Your Understanding #2: Portrait Photos
While taking a photograph of your friend, with the diaphragm of your large camera lens wide open,
you notice that the background is blurry. Explain.
Answer: Light from the more distant background focuses closer to the lens than light from your
friend. Since the camera is focusing on your friend, the background appears out of focus.
Why: When the aperture of your camera lens is wide open, focusing becomes critical. Objects in front
of or behind your friend are out of focus on the image sensor and appear blurry.

Fig. 14.1.6 The aperture
of this lens can be reduced
by closing its internal
diaphragm, dimming its
image but increasing its
depth of focus.

Focal Lengths and f-Numbers
Lenses are characterized by two quantities: focal length and f-number. The focal length of
a lens is the distance between the lens and the real image it forms of a very distant object.
For example, if a real image of the moon forms 100 mm (4 in) behind a particular lens, then

Cameras
(a)
that lens has a focal length of 100 mm. The focal lengths of camera lenses
range from less than 10 mm (0.4 in) in many cell phones and compact cameras
to about 2 m (7 ft) in cameras used for nature photography.
When light from a scene passes through a short-focal-length lens, it
comes to a focus near that lens and produces a relatively small image on the
image sensor. Because a long-focal-length lens permits the light passing Object
through it to spread out more before coming to a focus, it produces a larger
real image on the sensor.
(b)
The ânormalâ lens for a particular camera has a focal length that allows
all the objects in your central field of vision to fit onto the image sensor (see
Table 14.1.1). When you hold the finished photograph about 30 cm (1 ft)
from your eyes, the objects in the picture appear about the same size they did
when the photograph was taken. The focal length of a cameraâs normal lens
Object
is about 1.5 times the horizontal width of its image sensor.
A wide-angle lens has a shorter focal length than the normal lens
(Fig. 14.1.7a). The image it projects onto the image sensor is smaller but brighter, and
most of the objects in your entire field of vision appear in the photograph. A telephoto lens
has a longer focal length than the normal lens (Fig. 14.1.7b). The image it projects onto
the sensor is larger but dimmer, with only objects at the center of the scene appearing in
the photograph.
In addition to indicating where the image of a distant object forms, the focal length of
the camera lens relates the object distance to the image distance. The object distance is the
distance between the lens and the object youâre photographing. The image distance is the
distance between the lens and the real image it forms (Fig. 14.1.8). The relationship is
called the lens equation and can be written in a word equation:

According to the lens equation, the image distance for a distant object is equal to the
focal length of the lens. That agrees with our earlier discussion of focal length. However,
when the object is nearby, the image distance becomes larger than the focal length. Thatâs
why a camera lens moves away from the image sensor as you focus closer. When the object
distance becomes less than the focal length, the image distance becomes negative and no
real image forms at all. Thatâs why you canât focus on an object thatâs too close to the lens.
A lensâs f-number characterizes the brightness of the real image that it forms on the
image sensor, with smaller f-numbers indicating brighter images. The f-number is calculated by dividing the lensâs focal length by its diameter, or
f-number =

focal length
.
diameter

Since long focal length lenses naturally produce larger and dimmer images on the image
sensor, the f-number takes into account both the light-gathering capacity of the lens and its
focal length. Increasing a lensâs diameter increases its light-gathering capacity and
decreases its f-number. Increasing a lensâs focal length decreases the brightness of its real
image and increases the f-number. Doing both at once, increasing the lens diameter and
focal length equally, leaves the brightness and f-number unchanged.
Most sophisticated cameras use large-diameter lenses so that their f-numbers are generally less than 4. Since itâs difficult to fabricate a lens thatâs larger in diameter than its focal
length, the smallest practical f-number is about 1. Also, because long-focal-length lenses
need large apertures to keep their f-numbers small, some telephoto lenses are huge.
The diaphragm inside a lens allows you to decrease the lensâs aperture and thus
increase its f-number. A factor of 2 increase in f-number corresponds to a factor of
2 decrease in the lensâs effective diameter and a factor of 4 decrease in the lensâs lightgathering area. Thus when you double the f-number of the lens, you must compensate by
quadrupling the exposure time. Although closing the aperture increases the lensâs depth of
focus, it requires a longer exposure.
Check Your Understanding #3: Bright and Sharp Photographs
On bright, sunny days, your automatic camera takes photographs with large depths of focus, while
on dark, overcast days its pictures have much smaller depths of focus. What causes this difference?
Answer: On a bright day, your camera needs only a small aperture to gather enough light for an exposure, so the depth of focus is large. On a dark day, it uses the largest aperture available to gather light
and has a small depth of focus.
Why: Light gathering and depth of focus go hand in hand. If you must open the aperture of your
cameraâs lens to gather enough light for an exposure, focusing will become critical and your photographs will have small depths of focus.

Check Your Figures #1: The Image of an Apple
If the distance from an apple to a converging lens is twice the focal length of that lens, where will

Check Your Understanding #4: Not Such a Good Picture
If you use a large magnifying glass to form a real image of an overhead fluorescent light fixture, you
will find that the corners of the light fixture are blurry and have rainbow colors in them. Why is the
image quality so poor?
Answer: The magnifying glass has only one glass element and suffers from chromatic aberration (and
many other image imperfections).
Why: A single converging lens canât form a high-quality image on a flat surface because it has
chromatic aberration, spherical aberration, coma, and astigmatism. If the lens is small, these failings
are often invisible. In a large magnifying glass, however, they are all readily apparent and you canât
form a sharp image of the entire light fixture.

The Viewfinder and Virtual Images
SLR (single lens reflex) cameras permit you to change their lenses so that you can choose
a lens thatâs optimized for the task at hand. When you peer through the viewfinder of an
SLR camera (Fig. 14.1.10), youâre looking at the same real image that will be projected

A high-quality camera lens isnât a single piece of glass or plastic. Instead, itâs
composed of many separate elements that function together as a single lens. This
complexity improves the quality of the real image. To begin with, dispersion in a
single-element lens causes different colors of light to bend differently and focus
at different distances behind that lens. Known as chromatic aberration, this problem can be fixed by using several lens elements made of different types of glass
or plastic with different amounts of dispersion. These elements compensate for
one another so that the overall lens, known as an achromat, has very little dispersion and almost no color-focusing problems.
After correcting for color and other technical image problems, a sophisticated camera lens may contain more than 10 individual elements. For the purposes of the
lens equation, this complicated lens has an effective center from which to calculate object
and image distances. However, having so many separate elements creates reflection
problems; each time light passes from air to glass or vice versa, some of it reflects. To
avoid fogging the photographs with this bouncing stray light, the individual elements are
antireflection coated with thin layers of transparent materials. The best coatings use
interference effects to cancel out the reflected light waves and give the lens only a weak
violet reflection.
Many modern cameras are equipped with zoom lenses. A zoom lens is a complicated
lens that can change the size of the real image it projects onto the image sensor. By carefully moving its lens elements relative to one another, the zoom lens can adjust its effective
focal length.
A common type of zoom lens contains three separate groups of lens elements and
produces a sequence of three images (Fig. 14.1.9). The first lens group forms a first image
of the scene in front of the camera. The second lens group forms a second image of that first
image. The third lens group projects a third, real image of the second image onto the image
sensor. Zooming the lensâthat is, changing its focal lengthâinvolves altering the spacings between the lens groups to vary the second lens groupâs object and image distances
and thus the relative sizes of the first and second images.
As the zoom lens changes from short focal length to long focal length, the image it
projects on the sensor becomes larger. This effect allows you to compose the picture so that
the scene fills the photograph completely. A lens that can change its focal length while
retaining the same f-number and still keep the real image in focus on the sensor is a truly
remarkable achievement.

onto the image sensor during the exposure. The light you see travels through the cameraâs
main lens, reflects off a mirror, and projects onto a translucent screen inside the top of the
camera. Youâre simply inspecting this screen and the real image through a magnifying lens
in the eyepiece. During the exposure, the mirror flips out of the way and the real image
projects briefly onto the image sensor.
Since the screen and real image are only an inch or two from your eye, you canât focus
on them without the help of the eyepiece lens. The eyepiece lens is converging, but in this
case it doesnât form a real image. Instead, it forms a virtual image, an image located at a
negative image distanceâthat is, on the wrong side of the lens!
The screen displaying the scene that youâre photographing is so close to the eyepiece
lens that the object distance is less than that lensâs focal length. According to the lens equation, the image distance should be negative, and it is; the image is located on the screen side
of the eyepiece lens (Fig. 14.1.11). You canât put your fingers in the light and project this
image on your skin because the image is virtual rather than real.
You can, however, see this image through the eyepiece. Itâs located farther away than
the screen itself, so your eye can comfortably focus on it. Also, the image is magnifiedâ
the eyepiece lens is acting as a magnifying glass (Fig. 14.1.12). This lens provides magnification because, when you look at the screen through it, the screen image covers a wider
portion of your field of vision. This magnification increases as the eyepiece lensâs focal
length decreases. Thatâs because a shorter-focal-length eyepiece lens must be quite close to
the screen, where it can bend light rays coming from a smaller region so that they fill your
field of vision. The eyepiece lens in a typical camera has been chosen so that the screen fills
a comfortable portion of your visual field, allowing you to examine the virtual image in
great detail and adjust the lens and camera settings until you have just the right picture in
your view. Then all you have to do is take the photograph.
Cameras with fixed lenses often have two separate viewfinder systems. A typical digital camera has an electronic viewfinder, which displays the real image being projected onto
its image sensor. Many digital and most film cameras also have optical viewfinders.

Although optical viewfinders vary in style and sophistication, the best combine real and

prisms produces an erect real image of the scene and you then examine that real image
through an eyepiece magnifying glass. The lenses projecting the real image zoom along
with the cameraâs main lens so that what you see through the viewfinder is similar to what
the cameraâs image sensor will record.

Check Your Understanding #5: Real and Virtual Images
As you move a magnifying glass slowly toward the photograph in front of you, you see an inverted
image that grows larger and nearer to your eye. This image eventually becomes blurry, and then a new
upright and enlarged image appears on the photographâs side of the lens. Whatâs happening?
Answer: The lens is initially creating a real image near your eye. This real image moves past you as
the lens approaches the photograph. Finally, the lens is close enough to create an enlarged virtual
image of the photograph.
Why: A magnifying glass forms either a real or virtual image, depending on object distance and the
lensâs focal length. If the lens and photograph are separated by more than the focal length, the image
is real and you see it near your eye. You can touch this inverted image or project it on a piece of
paper. If the lens and picture are separated by less than the focal length, the upright image is virtual
and you see it on the far side of the lens.

Image Sensors
Once the lens has projected its real image onto the image sensor, itâs the image sensorâs job
to record that pattern of light. Interestingly enough, both film and electronic image sensors
use semiconductors, and both detect light when its photons shift electrons from valence
levels to conduction levels. However, how those two image sensors act on the electron
transitions is quite different.
Photographic film detects light photochemically. Embedded in the film are tiny crystals of silver salts. Composed primarily of silver and halogen atoms, these semiconductor
crystals are extremely sensitive to light. When a silver halide crystal absorbs a photon of
visible light, it can undergo a radiative transition that shifts an electron from a valence level
to a conduction level and eventually frees one silver atom from a silver halide molecule.
After several nearby silver atoms have been freed by light, they can form a tiny particle of
silver metal. When the film is developed, this silver particle transforms the entire silver
halide crystal into metallic silver. The microscopically rough structure of that silver makes
it appear black rather than shiny.
In black-and-white photography, the silver particles themselves form a negative image
on the developed film. Wherever the film was struck by light, it acquires a dense, black
pattern of silver particles. Wherever light was absent, the film becomes clear once the unexposed silver salts are washed away. Although the image on the developed film itself is
negativeâlight is dark and dark is lightâthe process of preparing photographic prints
reverses light and dark a second time so that the image on the prints is positive.
In color photography, the silver halide crystals are exposed to light through color
filters and sensitizers, so that the film separately records its exposure to the three primary colors of light (see Section 13.2). During development, the silver itself is washed
away, but a negative color image remains in the film. For example, wherever blue light
struck the film, it acquires a yellow tint and therefore absorbs blue light. Again, the
photographic printing process reverses the colors a second time so that the prints have
positive images.
Electronic image sensors are based on photodiodes, diodes that are optimized to
detect light. They combine the light-sensing behavior of photoconductors (see Fig. 13.3.4)
with the current-controlling behavior of diodes (see Fig. 13.3.6). A vast array of these

401

402

CHAPT ER 14 Optics and Electronics

photodiodes record the pattern of light in the real image, and the camera subsequently
reads that pattern by measuring the accumulated charges on each of its photodiodes. To
obtain color information, the image sensorâs photodiodes are covered with a pattern of
red, green, and blue filters so that each photodiode measures the intensity of only one
primary color of light.
Check Your Understanding #6: Foggy Photos
Airport screening devices often use X-rays to search for hidden items. These high-energy photons can
damage film. How?
Answer: X-rays cause radiative transitions in the silver salt crystals.
Why: X-rays can penetrate through normally opaque objects and reach the film. If a silver salt crystal
in the film absorbs an X-ray, it will respond as though it was exposed to visible light. Although most
modern screening devices use such weak X-ray sources that the effects are minimal, repeated
screenings of high-speed film will gradually ruin it.

Cornea

Iris Lens

Retina

Not all cameras involve modern technology. Most people are born with
two of themâtheir eyes. Like the cameras we have discussed, each eye
consists primarily of a converging lens and an image sensor (Fig.
14.1.13). In this case, the lens is a combination of the front surface of
the eyeball, its cornea, and the internal lens just beneath the cornea. The
image sensor is the retina, a vast pattern of light-sensitive cells and nerves at the back
of the eyeball.
When you look at the scene in front of you, the cornea and lens of your eye project a
real image of that scene onto your retina and your retina reports the resulting pattern of
light to your brain. As usual, the real image is inverted and reversed left to right, but your
brain compensates for that effect.
Since your eyeball canât alter the distance between the lens and the
image sensor, it focuses the real image by adjusting the focal length of the
lens. When you look at nearer objects, the lens in your eye becomes more
highly curved and its focal length decreases. The light rays from that nearer
object thus converge more sharply and form a real image on your retina.
When you view a more distant object, the lens becomes less curved and its
focal length increases.
Image
Like a sophisticated camera, your eye has an iris within its lens system.
When you view a bright scene, that iris shrinks to limit the amount of light
striking your retina. As a side effect, your depth of focus increases and everything appears sharper. Itâs easier to focus when you read or work in a welllighted environment.
However, not all eyes are perfect, and many need help forming sharp real
images on their retina. Although modern laser surgical techniques can reshape
Image corneas to improve image sharpness, the classic approach to better vision is to
wear eyeglasses or contact lenses. An eyeâs lens system already consists of two
components, the cornea and the lens, so adding a third component, eyeglasses, is no big deal.
A person who is farsighted canât see nearby objects sharply because her lens system
has too long a focal length (Fig. 14.1.14a). Although it can project real images of distant
objects on her retina, nearby objects focus too far away from the front of her eye and the
light strikes her retina before it forms a real image.
To compensate for farsightedness, she wears eyeglasses with converging lenses
(Fig. 14.1.14b). These lenses begin the task of bending light rays together even before they

enter her eyes. Her own lens system completes the bending, and the real images
form closer to the front of her eyes. She is thus able to see nearby objects clearly.
In contrast, a person who is nearsighted is unable to focus on distant
objects because his lens system has too short a focal length (Fig. 14.1.15a).
The real images of those distant objects form too close to the front of his
eye, and the light has already begun to spread apart by the time it reaches
his retina.
To compensate for nearsightedness, he wears eyeglasses with diverging
lenses (Fig. 14.1.15b). A diverging lens is one that bends light rays apart and
therefore has a negative focal length. Typically thinner at its middle than at its
edge, a diverging lens bends the nearly parallel rays of light from a distant
object so that they diverge more rapidly. Those rays then appear to come from
a much nearer object, actually a nearby virtual image, and his eyes are able to
focus them properly on his retina.

Check Your Understanding #7: Keeping Up Your Image
The eyeglasses of a farsighted person can project a real image of a distant scene on a white wall.
However, the eyeglasses of a nearsighted person produce no real image. Why not?
Answer: Nearsighted eyeglasses use diverging lenses, which bend light rays apart and donât focus
them together into a real image.
Why: To form a real image of a distant scene, you need to bring light rays together with a converging
lens. Diverging lenses spread light rays apart and canât form real images on their own.

Using light to convey information is as old as signal fires and
as natural as sight itself. Over the years, advances in light
sources, optical materials, and electronics have radically
increased the possibilities for optical information systems.
Optics and information go so well together that theyâre partly
responsible for the current information revolution. The introduction of compact disc players in the early 1980s transformed the music industry virtually overnight, and optical
fibers are knitting our world together at an astonishing pace. In

Questions to Think About: Where is a CDâs or DVDâs information
stored? How do CD or DVD players ignore fingerprints, dust, and
other surface contamination during playback? Why is a laser
involved in recording and playing back a CD or DVD? Why can a
Blu-ray disc hold more information than a DVD and a DVD more
than a CD? Why are CDs and DVDs so free of noise? How can a
glass fiber direct light in a curving path? How can light travel
through kilometers of glass fiber without becoming dim?
Experiments to Do: Hold a prerecorded CD, DVD, or Blu-ray
by its edges, and look at its unlabeled surface. Beneath the
clear plastic face is a smooth, shiny layer that reflects a rainbow of colors. Tiny pits in this layer cause this coloration.
These pits form a spiral track around the center of the disc,
and adjacent arcs of this track are so closely spaced that light
waves reflecting from them interfere, as from a soap film. The
reflective layer is so thin that you can see through it if you hold
it in front of a bright light. Can you see the reflections of dust
particles on the unlabeled surface? How deep below the plastic surface is the shiny layer?

Representing Sound and Light: Analog and Digital
A CD doesnât store sound any more than a DVD or Blu-ray stores flickering light. Instead,
these discs store representations of sound and light that it can use to recreate them on demand.

404

CHAPT ER 14 Optics and Electronics

Embedded in each disc is enough information to reproduce a concert or a movie, and to do so
almost perfectly. Between the microphones or camera that originally collected that information and the headphones or home theater that finally reconstructs the sound or light are a
number of fascinating processes, some optical and some electronic. In this section, we concentrate on the optical processes. In Section 14.3, weâll look at the electronic ones.
In Section 12.1, we saw that a radio wave can be used to represent sound. Sound waves
are fluctuations in airâs density, and the AM technique represents those density changes by
changes in the amplitude of a radio wave. The FM technique is similar, but it represents
those density changes by small changes in the frequency of a radio wave. Both techniques
are analog representations of the sound, meaning that a continuously variable physical
quantity (a radio waveâs amplitude or frequency) represents another continuously variable
physical quantity (airâs density). Like any analog representation, the radio transmitter is
drawing an analogy between two continuously variable physical quantitiesâamplitude or
frequency is serving as an analog for air density. The radio receiver draws the reverse analogy and thereby recreates the sound itself.
Although parts of the CD player use analog representations for sound, the optical
recording and playback part uses a different representationâdigital. In digital representations, a continuously variable physical quantity is first represented by a series of numbers
and then each of those numbers is represented by a set of physical quantitiesâa set of
digitsâeach of which can have only a limited number of discrete values. Those discrete
values are known as symbols, and symbols can be just about anything, as long as you can
tell them apart. As weâll see in a moment, the numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are such
symbols, and the set of numerals 392 is a digital representation of the number three hundred
ninety-two.
Suppose that youâre recording your band and want a digital representation of its sound.
The first step is to represent that soundâs density fluctuations as a series of numbers. With
the help of a microphone and some other equipment, you measure the air density many
times per second and obtain the series of numbers. Letâs assume that one of those numbers
is one hundred twenty-four, meaning that the air density during that measurement was 124
units above the normal density.
The second step is to represent each number by a set of digits. Weâll allow each digit
to hold 1 of 10 possible symbols. Those symbol choices could be , â , , , , , , ,
and , but letâs use a more familiar collection, the numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Note that the symbol 5 isnât actually a number; itâs just a shape consisting of two straight
lines and partial circle.
With a single digit and our set of 10 symbols, we can represent the numbers zero
through nine. With 2 digits and those same 10 symbols, we can represent the numbers zero
through ninety-nine. With three digits, we can represent zero through nine hundred ninetynine. Since weâre trying to represent the number one hundred twenty-four, we clearly need
at least three digits. When we place the symbols 1, 2, and 4 in those three digits, as 124, we
are representing the number one hundred twenty-four.
The convention that we are following when letting 124 represent one hundred twentyfour is known as decimal. In decimal, we break numbers into ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, and so onâthe powers of 10âand use 1 digit and a set of 10 symbols to represent
how much of each power of 10 is present in the number weâre representing. The decimal
representation of one hundred twenty-four is 124, meaning that it contains 1 hundred (102),
2 tens (101), and 4 ones (100). When these pieces are added together, they sum to one hundred
twenty-four.
What if, instead of 10 symbols, our collection had only 2 symbols: 0, 1? We could still
represent large numbers, but we would need many more digits than before. We would have
to break numbers into ones, twos, fours, eights, sixteens, and so on. Instead of using the
powers of 10 (as in decimal), we would be using the powers of 2. This system for representing numbers using the powers of 2 is called binary.

Optical Recording and Communication

In binary, one hundred twenty-four is written as 1111100, meaning that it contains 1
sixty-four (26), 1 thirty-two (25), 1 sixteen (24), 1 eight (23), 1 four (22), 0 twos (21), and 0
ones (20). When these pieces are added together, they again sum to one hundred twentyfour. This apparently complicated way to represent even a fairly small number is actually
quite useful. The number has been broken into pieces that have only two possible values;
there is either a thirty-two in the number being represented or there isnât.
Binary representations require only two different symbols, and those symbols can be any
distinguishable objects. Weâve been using (1 and 0), but we could use (heads and tails), (smoke
and no-smoke), (dot and dash), (shiny and dull), (charged and uncharged), and so on. Inside an
optical disc, for example, there is a surface covered with shiny and dull spots, and those spots
are a binary representation of numbers. Similarly, in a computer, there are capacitors that are
charged or uncharged, and those capacitors are a binary representation of numbers.
There are good reasons for using digital representation to record your bandâs sound
and for using binary. Analog representations are inherently noisy because every accidental
change in the physical quantity doing the representing is interpreted as a change in the
physical quantity being represented. Thatâs why a phonograph record, which uses height
fluctuations in a groove to represent the density fluctuations of sound, canât re-create that
sound perfectly. Whenever dust settles into the groove on the record and introduces its own
height fluctuations, the phonograph reproduces inaccurate sound, full of pops and snaps.
In contrast, digital representations are noise free. Dust and other imperfections have no
effect on digital representations as long as the symbols can still be distinguished for one
another. For example, even without brushing the cracker crumbs off your book, laptop, or
tablet, you can still read 5049 or 101001 with perfect accuracy, unless youâre a total slob.
Even when some of the symbols are so badly obscured that they cannot be read, extra symbols can be incorporated into the digital representation to correct for such reading errors.
The reason that binary is so useful in both optical and electronic devices is that working with 2 symbols is much easier than working with 10 of them. The symbols used in these
devices arenât shapes on a sheet of paper or computer screen, theyâre things like the shininess of a surface or the charge on a capacitor. Itâs easy to distinguish a dull spot (0) from a
shiny spot (1) inside an optical disc, but itâs much harder to distinguish between dull (0),
not quite dull (1), slightly shiny (2), . . . , very shiny (8), and extremely shiny (9) spots.
Although there are modern technologies that use more than two symbols, notably digital
television transmission, binary is much more common.
Check Your Understanding #1: New Math
What number does binary 10000001 represent?
Answer: One hundred twenty-nine.
Why: Binary 10000001 contains only 1 one hundred twenty-eight (27) and 1 one (20). All the other
powers of 2 are not present. Since 128 + 1 is 129, that is the number represented by this binary
value.

Digital Recording
In the conventional CD format, density measurements are made 44,100 times each second
for two independent audio channels and these measurements are recorded on the disc in
binary form, using 16 bits for each measurement (Fig. 14.2.1). Since the air density can go
down as well as up, these bits represent the positive and negative integers from â32,768 to
32,767, which in turn represent how much the air density is above or below the average
density. Density measurements with 16 bits of precision are sufficient to reproduce both
loud and soft music with almost perfect fidelity.
Like CDs, DVDs record information digitally. But DVDs are a newer technology and
therefore more sophisticated. Audio DVDs can choose from several measurement rates, bits per

measurement, and numbers of channels. A typical DVD might have five audio channels: leftfront, center-front, right-front, left-rear, and right-rear. The three front channels might have
96,000 density measurements per second at 24 bits per measurement, and the two rear channels
might have 48,000 measurements per second at 20 bits per measurement. All these samples,
bits, and channels involve far more information than is stored on a CD, and a DVD compresses
that information before storing it. In contrast, a conventional CDâs information is uncompressed
although some more modern formats (e.g., mp3) do employ compression techniques.
In either case, air density measurements arenât simply recorded one after another on a
discâs surface. Instead, these numbers are extensively reorganized before theyâre stored.
This reorganization allows the player to reproduce the sound perfectly even if the disc canât
be read completely. As weâll see shortly, reading these discs is a technological tour de force
and susceptible to various failures. To be sure that the sound (and video) can be reproduced
completely and without interruption, the numbers are recorded in an encoded manner. They
appear redundantly so that, even if one copy of a number is illegible, there is still enough
legible information along the same arc of the discâs spiral track to completely re-create that
missing number. This duplication of information reduces the playing time of both CDs and
DVDs, but it is essential for reliability.
Its encoding scheme leaves a CD or DVD almost completely immune to all but the
most severe playback problems. In principle, you can damage or obscure a 2-mm-wide
swath of the disc, from its center to its edge, and the player will still be able to reproduce
the sound (and video) perfectly. However, damage along an arc of the spiral track is far
more threatening to the data. If the player canât read a long stretch of a single arc, it wonât
be able to recover the information. Thatâs why you should always clean a CD or DVD from
its center outward to its edge.
Check Your Understanding #2: Cordless Clarity Away from Home
Cell phones transmit your voice in digital form. In general terms, how does this digital transmission
work?
Answer: Your cell phoneâs microphone converts the sound of your voice into a fluctuating current.
This current is measured periodically and represented as a sequence of numbers. These numbers are
then represented by radio waves and transmitted through space. The numbers eventually work their
way to a receiving cell phone, where the radio waves are converted back into numbers and the numbers
are converted back into a fluctuating current. Finally, the current is amplified and sent through a
speaker to create sound.
Why: Many modern communication devices use a digital representation of sound. In radio-wave
communication, digital representations are particularly useful because they are immune to the noise
that plagues analog radio transmissions and also permit more efficient use of the radio bandwidth.

The Structure of CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays
Standard CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays are 120 mm (4.72 in.) in diameter and 1.2 mm (0.05
in.) thick. One side of a CD is clear and smooth but the other side contains a sandwich of
layers: a thin film of aluminum, a protective lacquer, and a printed label (Fig. 14.2.2a). In
contrast, a DVD is laminated from two 0.6-mm-thick clear plastic discs, with one, two, or
four reflective layers of aluminum, gold, or silicon stacked up in between them (Fig.
14.2.2c). The more layers in the DVD, the more information it holds. A Blu-ray disc (BRD)
also has 1 to 4 reflective layers, but they are so near the BRDâs surface that a hard protective
coating is applied to prevent scratches.
The reflective layers are the recording surfaces. These layers are so thin that they actually transmit a small amount of light. In the gold or silicon DVD layers, this semitransparency is essential because it allows the optical system that reads information to send light
through the semitransparent layer to the aluminum layer beyond it. The aluminum layers
also transmit some light. Although aluminumâs electrons accelerate in response to the
lightâs electric field and normally reflect that light completely, there arenât enough electrons in these 50- to 100-nm-thick layers to do the job and some light gets through.
The reflective layers arenât perfectly smooth. Instead, each has a narrow spiral track
formed in its surface (Figs. 14.2.2b,d). This track is a series of microscopic pits, as short as
0.83 đm long on a CD, 0.40 đm long on a DVD, and 0.15 đm long on a Blu-ray. Adjacent
arcs in the spiral track are only 1.6 đm apart on a CD, 0.74 đm apart on a DVD, and just
0.32 đm apart on a Blu-ray. The lengths of the pits and the flat âlandsâ that separate them
represent numbers. The player examines these pits and lands as the disc turns and converts
their lengths into numbers, sound, and video.

CHAPT ER 14 Optics and Electronics

The pit lengths and the spacings between arcs werenât chosen arbitrarily. Since electromagnetic waves are unable to detect structures much smaller than their wavelengths (see
Section 12.2), the laser beamâs wavelength limits the size of the smallest features on a disc.
In a CD player, that beamâs wavelength is 780 nm in air and 503 nm in polycarbonate plasticâshort enough to detect the pits of a CD easily. In a DVD player, the laser beamâs
wavelength is between 635 and 650 nm in air and between 410 and 420 nm in plasticâjust
short enough to detect the pits in a DVD. The wavelength reduction inside the disc occurs
because polycarbonate plastic has an index of refraction of 1.55, meaning that the lightâs
speed in that plastic is reduced from its vacuum speed by a factor of 1.55. Its wavelength is
reduced by the same factor. In a Blu-ray player, the laser beamâs wavelength is 405 nm in
air and about 260 nm in plastic, and it is just able to observe the tiny pits.
The player detects a pit by bouncing light from the disc and determining how much of
it reflects. As the focused laser beam passes over a pit, the reflection becomes dim, in part
because the curved pit scatters light in all directions and in part because of interference
effects. Light thatâs reflected back from a pit travels farther than light thatâs reflected from
the flat region around it, so electric and magnetic fields in the two waves are shifted relative
to one another. The pit depth was chosen so that the two reflected waves are approximately
out of phase and they interfere destructively. Overall, the playerâs light sensors detect relatively little light when the laser beam is located over a pit.
A CD, DVD, or Blu-ray player uses a laser diode to produce its light. The 780-nm
standard for CD players was adopted in 1980, when 780-nm infrared laser diodes were
reliable but still fairly expensive. Technology advanced by the mid-1990s, however, and the
635- to 650-nm standard for DVD players reflects the development of inexpensive red laser
diodes. New standards follow technology, so with the development of reliable blue laser
diodes, new optical recording systems appeared. Blu-ray players and discs, which first
appeared in 2006, are based on a 405-nm laser. Because a Blu-ray player can focus its blue
laser beam to a much smaller spot than either a CD or a DVD player, a Blu-ray disc holds
far more information than either of the earlier formats.
Check Your Understanding #3: The Blue-Light Special
Blu-ray disc players use blue lasers with a wavelength of 405 nm in air or vacuum. A CD player uses
an infrared laser with a wavelength of 780 nm. How must the pit depths in the reflective layer of a
Blu-ray disc compare to the pit depths in a CD?
Answer: The pits in a Blu-ray disc must be about half as deep as those in a CD.
Why: The pits in the reflective layer should be about a quarter of a wavelength deep so that light
reflected from the bottom of a pit interferes destructively with light reflected from an adjacent flat
region. Halving the wavelength of the laser light requires halving the depth of the pits to achieve
destructive interference.

The Optical System of a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray Player
A CD, DVD, or Blu-ray playerâs optical system measures the lengths of the tiny pits as they
move by on a spinning disc. That reading process requires incredible precision. Not only
must the player focus its spot of laser light exactly on the reflective layer, but it must also
follow the spiral track as it moves by. The disc itself is neither perfectly flat nor perfectly
round, so the player must continuously adjust its reading unit during playback. The optical
system must keep its laser beam focused on the reflective layer (autofocusing) and must
follow the track as it passes (autotracking). These two automatic processes are beautiful
examples of the use of feedback.
The basic structure of a typical CD, DVD, or Blu-ray player is shown in Fig. 14.2.3.
Light from a laser diode passes through several optical elements on its way to the discâs
reflective layer. It comes to a tight focus on that layer, where it illuminates only a single

track. Some light reflects from the layer and returns through the optical elements. Finally,
the reflected light turns 90Â° at a special mirror called a polarization beam splitter and
focuses on an array of light detectors. The player measures the electric currents flowing
through the detectors and uses those measurements both to obtain data from the disc and to
control the focusing and tracking systems.
Letâs examine this optical system one element at a time. After leaving the laser diode,
light passes through a polarization beam splitter. This device analyzes the lightâs polarization. As we saw in Section 13.1, different polarizations of light reflect differently when they
strike a transparent surface at an angle. In this case, polarized light from the laser passes
through the 45Â° surface, but light of the other polarization reflects. The beam splitter is
specially coated to separate the two polarizations almost perfectly.
Light from the laser diode diverges rapidly as it passes through the beam splitter.
Itâs not that the laser diode is broken or poorly designed; itâs that a light wave emerging
from a small opening naturally spreads outward, like ripples on a pond. This spreading
is known as diffraction and occurs whenever a light wave is truncated by passing
through an opening. The smaller the opening, the worse is the spreading. Because the
emitting surface of the laser diode is essentially a very small opening, the laser beam
spreads rapidly as it heads away from the diode. The player uses a converging lens
located after the beam splitter to stop this spreading. At that point, the light beam is
already wide enough that diffraction causes little additional spreading. The beam leaves
the lens collimated, meaning that it maintains a nearly constant diameter after passing
through the lens.
The laser light then passes through a quarter-wave plate. This remarkable device performs half the task of converting horizontally polarized light into vertically polarized light
or vice versa. Horizontally and vertically polarized lights are said to be plane polarized
because their electric fields always oscillate back and forth in one plane as they move
through space. The quarter-wave plate turns plane polarized light into circularly polarized
light. We encountered circular polarization before in the radio transmissions from FM stations. In circularly polarized light, the electric field actually rotates about the direction in
which the light is traveling.
Now the light passes through an objective lens that focuses it onto the reflective layer
of the disc. On its way to the reflective layer, the light enters the plastic surface of the disc.
At its entry point, the beam is still more than 0.5 mm in diameter, which explains why dust
or fingerprints on the discâs surface donât cause much trouble. While contamination may
block some of the laser light, most of it continues onward to the reflective layer.
The light comes to a tight focus just as it arrives at the reflective layer. Although it
might seem that all the light should converge together to a single point on that surface, it
actually forms a spot roughly 1 wavelength in diameter. This spot size is limited by the

wave nature of light. No matter how perfectly you try to focus light, you canât
make a spot thatâs much smaller than the lightâs wavelength. Instead, the beam

be diffraction limited.
The amount of light that reflects from the layer depends on whether or not the laser
spot hits a pit. This reflected light follows the optical path in reverse. The light is collimated
by the objective lens and then passes through the quarter-wave plate again. The plate now
finishes the job it started earlier; the light ends up plane polarized but with the opposite
polarization it had when it left the laser. Horizontally polarized light is now vertically
polarized, and vice versa.
The reflected light then passes through the collimating lens, which makes the light converge, and then strikes the polarization beam splitter. Because the lightâs polarization has
changed, the beam splitter no longer allows the beam to pass directly through. Instead, it turns
this reflected beam 90Â° and directs it toward the detector array. This clever redirection scheme
is important for two reasons. First, it conserves laser light by allowing most of it to travel from
the laser diode to the detector. Second, it prevents reflected light from returning to the laser
diode, where that light would be amplified and cause the laser diode to misbehave.
The light comes to a focus on an array of photodiodes. This array allows the player to
detect pits via the reflected light intensity and also to determine whether the objective lens
is properly positioned relative to those pits. For generality, Fig. 14.2.3 omits optical elements involved in autofocusing and autotracking. However, because of those elements, the
pattern of light hitting the detector array indicates which way the objective lens should
move, if necessary. That lens is attached to coils of wire that are suspended near permanent
magnets. By varying the currents flowing through those coils, the player uses Lorentz
forces to move its objective lens about rapidly and keep it in the right place over the disc.
Check Your Understanding #4: Thatâs Why Itâs Called a Laser Disc
Why must the CD, DVD, or BRD player use a laser diode rather than a more conventional light source
such as an incandescent bulb?
Answer: The light in a CD, DVD, or BRD player must be coherent so that it can be focused to a single
diffraction-limited spot on the reflective layer and experience destructive interference when it
encounters a pit.
Why: You canât focus light from an incandescent bulb to a diffraction-limited spot. Each photon
leaving the bulb is independent and will focus at a somewhat different point in space. The bulbâs
incoherent light also doesnât experience the strong interference effects of laser light.

Optical Fibers
Optical playback of prerecorded discs is fine for music and movies, but it isnât of much use
when you want up-to-the-minute information. The Internet and World Wide Web require
communication links that operate at lightning speed. Yet, even here, optics and light have
an important role to play. The fastest way to send enormous amounts of information is to
use optical fibers.

Optical Recording and Communication

An optical fiber is a glass conduit that guides light from one place to another. Nearly
every photon that enters the fiber at one end emerges from the other end moments later. In
its simplest form, the fiber is made from two different glasses: a solid core of one glass surrounded by a cladding of the other glass. Both glasses are so incredibly transparent that light
can travel through them for kilometers with little loss. For comparison, look through the
edge of an ordinary piece of window glass and youâll see how dark the glass looks. It absorbs
far too much light to be suitable for optical fibers. Theyâre made of the purest glasses known.
If both glasses are almost perfectly transparent, what keeps the light from leaking out
of the sides of the fiber? The answer is a phenomenon known as total internal reflection. As
light tries to move from the inner glass core to the outer glass cladding, itâs reflected perfectly and thus canât escape.
Total internal reflection is an extreme case of refraction. When light encounters the
boundary between two materials with different indices of refraction, refraction causes that
light to bend (Fig. 14.2.5). If the material it enters has a smaller index of refraction than the one
it leaves, the light bends away from a line perpendicular to the boundary. The amount of this
bend depends on the two indices of refraction and on the angle at which the light approaches
the boundary. As long as the approach angle is steep enough, light will succeed in entering the
second material. However, if the approach angle is too shallow, the light wonât enter the second
material at all. Instead, it will reflect perfectly from the boundary. In fact, total internal reflection is far more efficient at reflecting light than a conventional metal mirror.
To keep the light inside the fiberâs core, the core glass must have a higher index of
refraction than the cladding glass. As light in the high-index core encounters the boundary
with the low-index cladding, it experiences total internal reflection and bounces back into
the core (Fig. 14.2.6a). As long as the fiber doesnât bend too sharply, the light bounces back
and forth inside the core and canât escape. As a result, light entering the fiber core through
one of its cut ends follows the fiber all the way to its other cut end.
A large-diameter fiber (typically 50 đm or more) has a problem. Light rays bouncing
through it at slightly different angles travel different distances during their passage through
the fiber. Light heading almost straight down the center of the fiber rarely bounces and takes
less time to complete its trip than light that bounces many times. Because this wide fiber
has many bouncing paths or âmodesâ in which light can travel through it, a short pulse of
light going through the fiber gets stretched out in time (Fig. 14.2.6a). This pulse-broadening
severely limits the rate at which information can be sent through a multimode fiber.

If its approach angle is too
shallow, the light will bend
so much that it will simply

This effect is called total
internal reflection.

412

CHAPT ER 14 Optics and Electronics

To reduce stretching problems, the core of a better-performance optical fiber has a
graded refractive index. The core glass is specially treated so that its index of refraction
decreases smoothly away from its center toward the cladding. Instead of bouncing abruptly
when it reaches the boundary between core and cladding, light in this graded-index environment turns smoothly back toward the core (Fig. 14.2.6b). The path differences between
the modes in a graded-index multimode fiber arenât so different, and a short pulse of light
isnât stretched very much in a fiber of moderate length.
In very long fibers, however, even small path differences add up, and short pulses
become blurred in multimode fibers. Therefore, the highest-performance optical conduits
are single-mode fibers. These fibers have very narrow graded-index cores that permit light
to travel only in one modeâeffectively right down the center of the fiber (Fig. 14.2.6c).
The core is typically only 9 đm in diameter. A pulse of light entering this narrow core
broadens very little in time during its passage.
What little broadening occurs in a single-mode fiber isnât caused by the light taking
different paths; itâs caused by ordinary dispersion in the glass. To carry information, the
light wave must change with time and thus must have a range of frequencies and wavelengths. As usual, the shorter wavelengths travel slower than the longer wavelengths and
the pulses get stretched out in time. To minimize these dispersion effects, the highest-speed
optical fibers operate at wavelengths that minimize dispersion. They also operate at wavelengths that minimize the loss of light through absorption in the glass. These two wavelengths coincide at 1550 nm in dispersion-shifted fibers, so this infrared wavelength is
commonly used in long-haul optical communication.
Check Your Understanding #5: If It Looks like a Mirror . . .
When you look into an aquarium from the front, the sides of the aquarium often look like mirrors.
Those sides are actually clear glass, so why do they reflect light so well?
Answer: The light you see is experiencing total internal reflection as it tries to leave the glass at a
shallow angle. You see perfect reflections of the fish inside the aquarium.
Why: Light has trouble passing from water or glass into the air at a shallow angle. When it tries, it
experiences total internal reflection and bounces off the surface without losing any intensity at all.

Optical Communication
A typical optical communication transmitter uses a 1550-nm laser diode to generate short
pulses of light. These pulses carry information from the transmitter to a receiver somewhere far away. The transmitter produces its pulses by varying the current passing through
the laser diode. Light emerging from the laser diode is focused into the exposed core of a
single-mode optical fiber, and it follows the core all the way to the other end of the fiber.
When the light emerges, itâs gathered by a lens and focused onto the receiverâs photodiode.
Each pulse of light causes a pulse of current to flow through the photodiode, allowing the
receiver to begin processing the information.
A laser diode and a single-mode optical fiber can send billions of bits of data per second for 50 km or 100 km without significant errors. At longer distances, the gradual absorption of light in the glass makes it difficult to receive the information reliably. The easiest
solution to this problem is to receive the data before the light becomes too weak and then
to retransmit it with another laser diode.
Instead of interrupting the optical transmission with a receiver and retransmitter, some
long-haul communication systems employ erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). An
EDFA is a piece of optical fiber that has about 0.01% erbium ions in its glass core. When
the EDFA is exposed to 980-nm or 1480-nm light, it becomes a laser amplifier for 1550-nm
light. As the weakened pulses of light from a long fiber pass through the fiber amplifier, the
amplifier duplicates photons and brightens the pulses. These amplified pulses then continue

Audio Players

413

through ordinary fiber before being amplified again. Undersea optical cables often splice
fiber amplifiers into the fibers every 50 km or so. These amplifiers allow light to travel
thousands of kilometers through a continuous path, from one side of an ocean to the other.
To get the most out of a single optical fiber, many communication systems use several
laser diodes operating at somewhat different wavelength ranges around 1550 nm. Light from
these diodes is merged together and focused into the fiber. When the light emerges at the far
end of the fiber, its different wavelength ranges are split apart and directed onto individual
receivers. The different wavelength ranges are like different channels, so that this wavelength-division multiplexing allows one fiber to carry far more information than it could
with light from a single laser. Remarkably enough, an EDFA can amplify all of these different channels at once because erbium ions can copy a wide range of wavelengths.
Check Your Understanding #6: Making Something Out of Nothing
If light weakens gradually as it passes through a long optical fiber, why canât you simply wait until the
very end of the fiber to amplify what little light remains and then send the amplified light into a receiver?
Answer: As the light is absorbed, the number of photons in a pulse gradually diminishes. When that
number gets to zero, thereâs nothing left to amplify.
Why: Each pulse of light in the fiber contains a limited number of photons. The glass absorbs many
of these photons during their long passage through a fiber, so they must be amplified before their
numbers become so small that thereâs a chance that none of them makes it at all.

Audio players have revolutionized portable music systems.
Everywhere you look, people are sporting earpieces and listening
to their favorite tunes with these little electronic marvels or their
smartphone siblings. Part computer and part stereo system, an
audio player is a spectacular synthesis of some of the highest
forms of modern electronic technology. Because they contain
such a broad range of electronic components, audio players offer
an excellent introduction to much of modern electronics.

To understand how audio players work, we need to look at
how sound can be represented electronically and at how those
electronic representations can be stored, retrieved, and ultimately used to re-create the sound itself. That exploration will
take us all the way from the digital world of computers to the
analog world of amplifiers and headphones.
It will also expose us to that workhorse of modern electronicsâthe transistor. Early audio electronic devices were
built with vacuum tubes, which were relatively bulky components that wasted power and aged quickly. Transistors have
made audio electronics much more practical. They have also
made computers so small and inexpensive that every audio
player can have its own computer.
Questions to Think About: What does it mean to store songs?
How can a computer use numbers to represent music? Why
does an audio player need electric power to operate? Why does
an audio player become warm as it operates? Does the volume
of the sound affect the battery life? What does an audio amplifierâs power rating mean? How are electric power and sound
volume related? How do the treble and bass controls of an
audio player affect the sound?
Experiments to Do: Find an audio player or a smartphone.
Turn it on, and notice that it takes a short time to âwake up.â
Youâre observing the boot process of a computer. But if all of
the computerâs information is already inside it, why does it
need to do so much work as its starts? As weâll soon see, the
deviceâs computer uses different types of memory, some of

414

CHAPT ER 14 Optics and Electronics

which are wiped clean when the audio player is turned off.
With that tidbit in mind, try to imagine what is happening
during the boot process.
Play some music and experiment with the sound controls.
The volume control determines how much power reaches the
headphones. Recall that a flashlight with a poor connection
produces dim light. If you create a poor connection between

the player and the earpiece, what happens to the volume?
Where did the lost power go?
Now experiment with the bass and treble controls. If the
player has any other audio effects, try them. Are you still hearing
sound as it was originally performed? How do the playerâs tone
settings influence the sound reproduction? Is the most perfect
imitation of the original sound always what you want to hear?

Transistors

The story of audio players begins with the story of transistors. Invented in 1948 by three
American physicists, William Shockley (1910â1989), John Bardeen (1908â1991), and
Walter Brattain (1902â1987), transistors are key elements in nearly all modern electronic
equipment. Like the diodes we examined in Section 13.3, transistors are built from doped
semiconductorsâsemiconductors such as silicon to which chemical impurities have been
added. However, unlike diodes, which operate in only a single circuit, transistors allow the
current in one circuit to control the current in another circuit.
There are many types of transistors, but the simplest and most important type is the
field-effect transistor. Actually, even here there are several varieties, so weâll focus on the
one thatâs most widely used in audio players, cell phones, video equipment,

Fig. 14.3.2 (a) An n-channel MOSFET is formed from three pieces of semiconductor: a n-type drain,
p-type channel, and n-type source. (b) When those pieces touch, conduction-level electrons from the
n-type source and drain fill the empty valence levels of the p-type channel and form a vast insulating
depletion region. The depleted channel is nonconducting and the MOSFET is Off. (c) When positive
charge is placed on the nearby gate, however, it attracts extra electrons into the channelâs conduction
levels and the negatively charged channel then behaves as n-type semiconductor. The entire structure
is conducting and the MOSFET is On.

We can now understand the n-channel MOSFETâs name. N-channel refers to the channelâs n-type behavior when its gate is positively charged and the transistor can carry current. Although the channel is chemically p-type (Fig. 14.3.2a), it becomes electrically
n-type when extra electrons are drawn into it and it acquires a negative net charge (Fig.
14.3.2c). Metal-oxide-semiconductor indicates that the metal or metal-like gate is separated from the semiconductor channel by a thin insulating layer of oxide. This insulator can
be as little as 1.2 nm thick and agonizingly easy to puncture, so modern electronic devices are
heavily protected against the damaging effects of static electricity. Field-effect transistor
indicates that the electric field from charge on the gate is what draws electrons into the
channel and controls the current flow through the transistor.

Check Your Understanding #1: Power and Control
Widening the channel of an n-channel MOSFET allows it to handle more current between its source
and drain. However, the enlarged transistor needs more positive charge on its gate to control that
current. Explain.
Answer: The larger transistor also has a larger gate. With more surface over which to spread its
charge, the gate needs more positive charge to draw conduction-level electrons into the channel.
Why: MOSFETs range in size from remarkably small (less than 0.01 đm2) to relatively large (several
square millimeters). The smallest ones are used in computer chips, where millions of MOSFETs are
created on a single wafer of silicon only a centimeter square. A tiny charge on the gate of one of these
MOSFETs will allow it to conduct current. The largest MOSFETs are used in power-control devices
such as amplifiers and power supplies. These transistors have large gates, and much more charge is
needed to allow one of them to conduct current.

Storing Digital Sound Information
An audio player is half computer and half stereo system. It stores and manipulates sound
information in digital form like a computer but then amplifies that information for the headphones in analog form like a stereo system. Weâll mirror that sequence when examining the
playerâs electronics: weâll start with its digital memory and processing systems and finish
with its audio amplifier.
Inside the digital portion of the audio player, air pressure measurements and other
numbers are represented in binary form. How large or precise those numbers are determines how many binary digits are needed to represent them. Each binary digit is called a
bit, and using more bits allows you to represent larger or more precise numbers. In general,
the more detailed the information, the more bits are needed to represent it.
Eight bits can be used to represent any number from 0 (which is 00000000) to 255
(which is 11111111). Since there are fewer than 256 of many common objects, these
objects can be identified by groups of 8 bits. For example, the symbols used in ordinary text
have been assigned numbers between 0 and 255, with 65 denoting the letter A. Since the 8
bits 01000001 represent 65, they also specify an A. Groups of 8 bits are so common and
useful that they are called bytes.
Although itâs possible to store sound information using 1 byte per air pressure measurement, a byte usually doesnât provide enough precision for quality sound reproduction. More
often, digital audio is saved using 2 bytes per pressure measurement. These pressure measurements are made tens of thousands of times per second, usually from several microphones
simultaneously to provide stereo or surround sound. Even when sophisticated data compression techniques are used to eliminate redundant or inconsequential information, a great many
bits are still needed to represent an album. Thus an audio player needs a lot of memory.
There are several ways in which the audio player, like any computer, stores a bit. In its
main working memory (often called random access memory, or RAM), each bit is a tiny
capacitor that uses the presence or absence of separated electric charge to denote a 1 or a 0.
The player stores a bit by producing or removing separated charge and recalls the bit by
checking for that charge.
Each capacitor is built right at the end of its own n-channel MOSFET. That MOSFET
controls the flow of charge to or from the capacitor. To store or recall a bit, the audio player
places positive charge on the gate of the MOSFET so that the MOSFET becomes electrically conducting. The memory system can then transfer charge to or from the bitâs capacitor.
Storing the bit is relatively easy; the player simply sends the appropriate charge
through the MOSFET to the capacitor. Recalling the bit is harder because the charge on the
capacitor is extremely small. Sensitive amplifiers in the memory system detect any charge
flowing through the MOSFET from the capacitor and report what they find to the audio
player. Since this reading process removes charge from the capacitor, the memory system
must immediately store the bit again.

Audio Players

Unfortunately, these tiny capacitors canât hold separated charge forever because it
leaks out to their surroundings. Memory that uses charged capacitors to store bits is called
dynamic memory and must be refreshed (read and restored) hundreds of times each second
to ensure that a 1 doesnât accidentally switch to a 0 or vice versa.
Dynamic memory is also volatileâits contents are lost when the audio player turns
off. To conserve its batteries, the player keeps its music information in nonvolatile memory,
memory that doesnât need power to retain its information. New possibilities for nonvolatile
memory appear almost every year, but at present the three leading forms are flash, magnetic
disk, and optical disc memories.
Flash memory resembles dynamic memory in that each bit is stored as the presence or
absence of charge associated with a MOSFET. In flash memory, though, that charge resides
on the MOSFETâs floating gateâa second, unattached gate located in the insulating layer
between the channel and the normal gate. Since this floating gate is surrounded by insulator, it can keep its charge for decades. As long as that charge is present, it will determine
the MOSFETâs conductivity and whether the bit is a 0 or a 1.
Reading bits from flash memory is easy, but storing them is a challenge. The same isolation
that traps charge on the floating gate for years makes that charge difficult to change. To add or
remove electrons from the floating gate, the memory system applies relatively large voltages to
the MOSFETâs source, drain, and normal gate and the resulting strong electric fields permit
electrons to cross through the insulation separating the channel from the floating gate.
To add electrons to the floating gate, the electric fields are arranged so they accelerate
channel electrons to such high speeds that those electrons simply burrow right through the
insulating layer to the floating gate. To remove electrons from the floating gate, the electric
fields are arranged so that the floating gateâs electron standing waves are distorted into the
insulator. When these distorted waves reach far enough into the insulator, electrons begin
to leak through it into the channel via a process known as quantum tunneling. (Weâll return
to explore quantum tunneling in Chapter 15.)
Flash memory is fast to read but relatively slower to write. Moreover, the electron
burrowing process causes cumulative damage to the insulating layer and limits the number
of times flash memory can be written. An audio player uses a mixture of dynamic memory
and flash memory; it does its computational work in dynamic memory but retains its longterm information in flash memory.
However, thereâs another memory concept that remains more cost-effective than flash
memory for storing vast amounts of informationâmagnetic disk memory. Although flash
memory has largely replaced magnetic disks in audio players, computers still depend
extensively on magnetic disks.
Just as the magnetic strip on a credit card (Fig. 11.1.6) can store information in the
locations of its magnetic poles, the surface of a magnetic disk can store information in the
orientations of its magnetic poles. Actual hard disks are smooth aluminum platters that
have been coated with hi-tech hard magnetic materials. Using microscopic electromagnets
to write magnetic poles and sophisticated semiconductor magnetic sensors to read them,
modern hard disks can pack over 1 billion bits into a square millimeter of surface (over 80
gigabytes per square inch). Simply locating those microscopic bits on platters that rotate
over 100 times per second is an electromechanical tour de force, yet these disks do it routinely even while you are moving your laptop around the room.
Check Your Understanding #2: Like Sending a Letter to Yourself
Every few thousandths of a second, a computerâs memory system stops briefly to read and then
rewrite every bit in its dynamic memory. What is going on?
Answer: The computer is making sure that the charge stored on each capacitor in the dynamic memory adequately represents that bitâs contents.
Why: Since charge leaks quickly from the capacitors in dynamic memory, the contents of each bit
must be refreshed many times a second. This refreshing process, reading each bit and storing it back
into memory, slows the computer down slightly.

Weâve seen how sound information can be represented and stored as bits, so now letâs look
at how an audio playerâs computer works with those bits. This digital processing is done by
electronic devices that take groups of bits as their inputs and produce new groups of bits as
their outputs. Since their output bits are related to their input bits by the rules of logic, these
electronic devices are called logic elements.
The simplest logic element is the inverter, which has only one input bit and one output
bit. Its output is the inverse of its input (Fig. 14.3.3). If an inverterâs input bit is a 1, then its
output bit is a 0, and vice versa. Inverters are used to reverse an actionâturning a light on
rather than off or starting a song rather than stopping it. Inverters are also used as parts of
more complicated logic elements.
But inverters arenât just abstract logic elements; theyâre real electronic devices. They
act on electrical inputs and create electrical outputs. In an audio playerâs computer, inverters and other logic elements represent input and output bits with electric charge. Positive
charge represents a 1, and negative charge represents a 0. Thus when positive charge arrives
at the input of an inverter, the inverter releases negative charge from its output.
Inverters and other logic elements are usually constructed from both n-channel and
p-channel MOSFETs. Weâve already seen that n-channel MOSFETs conduct current only
when their gates are positively charged. P-channel MOSFETs do just the reverse, conducting current only when their gates are negatively charged. The drain and source of a p-channel
MOSFET are made from p-type semiconductor, and the channel is made from n-type semiconductor. Since n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs are exact complements to one
another, logic elements built from them are called complementary MOSFET or CMOS
elements. An audio playerâs computer is built almost entirely from CMOS elements.
A CMOS inverter consists of one n-channel MOSFET and one p-channel MOSFET
(Fig. 14.3.4). The n-channel MOSFET is connected to the negative terminal of the computerâs power supply and controls the flow of negative charge to the inverterâs output. The
p-channel MOSFET is connected to the power supplyâs positive terminal and controls the
flow of positive charge to the output. When negative charge arrives at the inverterâs input
and moves onto the gates of the MOSFETs, only the p-channel MOSFET conducts current
and the output becomes positively charged. When positive charge arrives at the input, only
the n-channel MOSFET conducts current and the output becomes negatively charged.
A computer, however, needs logic elements that are more complicated than inverters.
One such element is the Not-AND or NAND gate. This logical element has 2 input bits and
1 output bit, and its output bit is 1 unless both input bits are 1s (Fig. 14.3.5). Itâs called a
Not-AND gate because itâs the inverse of an AND gate. An AND gate produces a 0 output
unless both input bits are 1s. Simple memoryless logic elements are often called gates.
A CMOS NAND gate uses two n-channel MOSFETs and two p-channel MOSFETs
(Fig. 14.3.6). The two n-channel MOSFETs are arranged in seriesâone after the nextâso
that current passing through one must also pass through the other. If either transistor has
negative charge on its gate, no current can flow through the series. Components arranged in
series all carry the same current, but they may experience different voltage drops.
The two p-channel MOSFETs are arranged in parallelâone beside the otherâso that
current can flow through either one of them to the output. If either transistor has negative
charge on its gate, current can flow from one side of the pair to the other. Components
arranged in parallel share the current they receive through one wire and deliver it together
to the second wire. Although parallel components may share the current unevenly among
themselves, they all experience the same voltage drop.
If negative charge arrives at either input of the CMOS NAND gate, the series of n-channel MOSFETs will be nonconducting and one of the p-channel MOSFETs will deliver positive charge to the output. However, if positive charge arrives at both inputs, both p-channel
MOSFETs will be nonconducting and the series of n-channel MOSFETs will deliver negative charge to the output. Thus the CMOS NAND gate has the correct logic behavior.

Audio Players

These two logic elements, inverters and NAND gates, can be combined to produce any
conceivable logic element. For example, they can be used to build an adder, a device that
sums the numbers represented by two groups of input bits and produces a group of output
bits representing that sum. These adders can themselves be used to build multipliers, and
multipliers can be built into still more complicated devices. In this fashion, the simplest
logic elements can be used to construct an entire computer.
Actually, a computer isnât built exclusively from NAND gates and inverters. To
improve its speed and reduce its size, it uses a few other basic logic elements as well. Like
the CMOS NAND gate and inverter, these elements are constructed directly from n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs.
All these logic elements are wired together in an intricate pattern to create a complete
computer (Fig. 14.3.7). In an audio player, this computer retrieves and organizes music
information and prepares it for the playback electronics, which are not digital. The computerâs last act is to deliver the digital music information, the air pressure measurements, to a
digital-to-analog converter, or DAC. This electronic device is the interface between the two
representations of information: digital and analog. The music information leaves the DAC
as a voltage thatâs proportional to air pressure. This voltage is the input for the audio playerâs main analog component, its audio amplifier. Actually, the player has two complete
analog audio systems so that it can produce stereo sound. But since those systems are
identical, weâll focus on only one of them.
Check Your Understanding #3: Getting It Together
How could you use inverters and NAND gates to create an AND gate, a logic element that has two
inputs and one output, with the output being 1 only if both of the inputs are also 1s?
Answer: You could connect an inverter to a NAND gate so that the output signal of the NAND gate is
the input signal of the inverter. When both of the NAND gateâs input signals are 1s, it will produce
an output of 0. This 0 will arrive at the inverter, which will invert it and yield an output of 1.
Why: Connecting logic elements together one after the next is the standard method for producing
more complicated logic elements. In this case, two elements connected together produce a third.

The Audio Playerâs Audio Amplifier

ÂŠ Michael W. Davidson/Photo Researchers, Inc.

The fluctuating voltage provided by the audio playerâs DAC is often called an audio signal
because it represents audio information. Many analog or digital representations of information are called signals, including video signals, data signals, and even turn signals. But
although the playerâs audio signal contains all the information needed to reproduce the
original sound, in convenient analog format, it doesnât have the power that the headphones
need to produce that sound at a reasonable volume. Something must first enlarge the audio
signal; it needs to be amplified.

Devices that enlarge various characteristics of signals are called amplifiers. An audio
amplifier is an amplifier thatâs designed to boost signals in the frequency range that we hear
or feel (20 to 20,000 Hz). It has two separate circuitsâan input circuit and an output circuitâand it uses the small current passing through its input circuit to control a much larger
current passing through its output circuit. In this manner, the amplifier provides more
power to its output circuit than it receives from its input circuit. Since energy is conserved,
an amplifier needs a separate power source to provide its amplificationâin this case, the
9-V battery.
Figure 14.3.8 shows the schematic diagram for a simple audio amplifier, built from the
components weâve just studied. This amplifier has only five components: an n-channel
MOSFET, two resistors, and two capacitors. It draws power from a 9-V battery (or an
equivalent power adapter) and amplifies a tiny alternating current in its input circuit into a
large alternating current in its output circuit.
To understand how this amplifier works, letâs first remove everything but the MOSFET
and the 50-âŚ resistor (Fig. 14.3.9). These two components are in series, so any current that
passes through one must also pass through the other. When the MOSFET doesnât conduct
current, no current flows through the 50-âŚ resistor and it experiences no voltage drop. So
the voltage at A is 9 V. However, if the transistor does conduct current, a voltage drop will
appear through the 50-âŚ resistor and the voltage at A will decrease.
The transistor will conduct current only if positive charge is put on its gate. That can
be done by connecting the gate to A with a 100-kâŚ resistor (Fig. 14.3.10). Since A is at
9 V, it is positively charged and pushes charge toward anything at lower voltage. Current
flows slowly through the resistor from A to the gate. However, as positive charge accumulates on the gate, the transistor begins to conduct current and the voltage at A drops. When
the voltage at A reaches the voltage on the gate, current stops flowing through the resistor.
The amplifier is then in a stable equilibrium; A has a voltage of approximately 5 V and
the transistorâs gate has a modest amount of charge on it. The 100-kâŚ resistor provides the
transistor with feedback; that is, it provides the transistor with information about the present situation at A that the transistor can use to correct or improve that situation. Although
the feedback is slowed by the resistorâs large electrical resistance, it perpetually acts to
return the voltage at A to its equilibrium value. If the transistor conducts too little current,
charge flows onto its gate and makes it conduct more. If the transistor conducts too much
current, charge flows off its gate and makes it conduct less.
The amplifier is now exquisitely sensitive to small changes in the charge on the transistorâs gate. If you add just a tiny bit more positive charge to the gate, down goes the voltage
at A. If you remove just a tiny bit of positive charge from the gate, up goes the voltage at A.
Although current in the feedback resistor tries to undo these changes, it acts too slowly to
oppose short-timescale variations. The amplifierâs input signal successfully adds or subtracts positive charge from the gate, and the amplifierâs output signal emerges from A.

Audio Players

+9 volts
The amplifier has two input wires. An analog audio signalâs current flows into
the amplifier through one wire and returns through the other. However, the audio
50 ÎŠ
signal is not connected directly to the gate. Instead, itâs connected to the gate
through a capacitor (Fig. 14.3.11). In addition to storing charge and energy, a
capacitor can transfer current between two wires that have different voltages.
100 kÎŠ
Such voltage flexibility is important in battery-powered audio amplifiers that must
A
do their amplifying exclusively with positive voltages. Aided by input and output
1 ÎźF
capacitors, our audio amplifier can have an average operating voltage of about +5
V while it also has average input and output voltages of 0 V.
Input
To see how a capacitor passes along current, letâs watch input current flow current
rightward into our amplifierâs input capacitor. As that currentâs positive charge
accumulates on the capacitorâs left plate, it attracts negative charge onto the capacitorâs right plate and away from the gate. The capacitor remains electrically neutral,
0 volt
but the gate becomes more positively charged. Overall, the capacitor has conveyed

input current to the gate even though no charge has actually passed through its insulating current flowing back and
forth through the two input
layer and its two plates remain at different voltages.
With the help of the input capacitor, the amplifierâs fluctuating input current produces wires affects the charge on
the transistorâs gate, it also

a tiny fluctuating current on the input wires creates a large fluctuating voltage at A.
This fluctuating voltage is responsible for sending a fluctuating current
+9 volts
through the headphones. Although headphones are not truly ohmic devices, they
respond to fluctuating voltages by carrying fluctuating currents. By applying a
50 ÎŠ
fluctuating voltage drop across the headphoneâs two wires, the amplifier can
cause it to carry a fluctuating current and produce corresponding pressure fluctu100 ÎźF

However, the voltage at A averages about 5 V, while the headphones expect

an average voltage drop of 0 V. To convey the fluctuating voltages and currents

from A to the headphones, while eliminating their large voltage difference, our

amplifier connects them via an output capacitor (Fig. 14.3.12). As before, the current
fluctuations in current and voltage on the output capacitorâs left plate are mirrored by current and voltage fluctuations on its right plate. Even though the
amplifier operates at a high average voltage, the output signal for the head0 volt

for these problems. Most use feedback to make sure that their output signals are essentially
perfect replicas of their input signals, only larger. They sense their own shortcomings and
correct for them.
Perfect replication of the input signal isnât always desirable. Sometimes you want to
boost the volume for part of the sound. The treble and bass controls on an audio player
allow you to selectively change the loudnesses for the high- and low-frequency portions of
the sound, respectively.
An amplifier is typically rated according to the peak power it can supply to the headphones (or speakers) and its average power should never reach that value. Yet the amplifier
can reach its peak power during a passage thatâs not particularly loud. Thatâs because sound
waves often interfere with one another (see Section 9.3 to review wave interference), and
when their crests and troughs coincide at the microphone, constructive interference can
briefly produce enormous pressure fluctuations.

422

CHAPT ER 14 Optics and Electronics

To reproduce those overlapping waves properly, the audio amplifier must be able to
provide several times its average power, though only for a moment. If the amplifier canât
deliver that much power, the audio signal it sends to the headphones or speakers will be
distorted and the sound will be unpleasant. Thatâs why audiophiles often use powerful
amplifiers even when theyâre playing quiet music. Most modern amplifiers are designed
cleverly so that they consume only a little more electric power than they actually need to
produce their outputs. They consume little power during quiet passages but can still provide great power during the loud moments.
As for the headphones themselves, they generally use electromagnetic effects to move
a surface back and forth in sync with the amplifierâs current fluctuations. In most cases, the
amplifierâs current is sent through a coil of wire thatâs immersed in a strong magnetic field
and attached to a movable surface. This current experiences a Lorentz force due to the
magnetic field, and that force drives the current, coil, and surface back and forth as the
current fluctuates. The moving surface alternately compresses and rarefies the air, thereby
reproducing the original sound. The electric power in the circuit becomes sound power for
your ears.

Check Your Understanding #4: Sound Control
When you connect a microphone to the input of a MOSFET-based amplifier, the microphone sends
current back and forth through the input wires. As a result, charge moves onto or off what critical
control element in the amplifier?
Answer: The critical control element is the gate of a MOSFET.
Why: In all likelihood, the input current adds or removes charges from the gate of a MOSFET in the
amplifierâs first stage of amplification.

Epilogue for Chapter 14
In this chapter we looked at several common objects and studied the ways in which they
use optics. In Cameras, we saw how a converging lens can form a real image of an object
and how that real image can be used to record a scene on a piece of film or an image sensor
chip. We learned about the roles of focal length and f-number in determining the size and
brightness of the real image and explored some of the complications that must be considered when designing lenses.
In Optical Recording and Communication, we studied the ways in which sound and
other information can be represented in digital form and stored as structural features on
optical discs. We looked at how laser light is affected by various optical devices and looked
at what happens to it when itâs focused to a small spot. We learned about total internal
reflection and how this effect makes it possible to send light hundreds or thousands of
kilometers through a fiber of ultraclear glass.
In Audio Players, we looked at the electronic techniques used to represent sound and
other information in digital and analog forms. We also examined the most important
modern electronic componentâthe transistor, a semiconductor device that allows the
current in one circuit to control the current in another circuit. We saw how an audio
player uses transistors and other electronic components in both its digital computer and
its analog amplifier.

Explanation: Magnifying Glass Camera
The magnifying glass forms a real image of the window on the wall. All the light rays passing through the lens from one point on the window converge together to one point on the
wall. Since each point on the window illuminates one point on the wall, you see a pattern

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations

of light on the wall that looks just like the window itself. The real image on the wall, however, is flipped upside down and its sides are reversed.
Because the window is closer to the lens than any of the objects outside the window,
the real image of the window itself forms farthest from the lens. When you hold the magnifying glass so that the window appears sharp on the wall, the objects outside the window
are blurry. To bring those more distant objects into sharp focus, you must move the lens
toward the wall. Very distant objects, such as a mountain or the moon, will form sharp
images on the wall when the distance between the magnifying glass and wall is equal to the
focal length of the lens.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Cameras Work: A camera lens projects a real image of the scene in front of the
camera onto the image sensor inside the camera. This real image is formed when the
lens bends all the light reaching it from one part of the scene onto one part of the sensor. For this imaging process to work well, the distance between the lens and the image
sensor must be adjusted so that the light converges together (focuses) just as it reaches
the sensor. If the sensor is too close to or too far from the lens, the image is blurry. The
depth of focus depends on the effective diameter of the lensâits aperture. The smaller
the lensâs aperture, the less critical the focus but the less light the lens gathers. A longfocal-length lens brings the light to a focus far behind it, forming a relatively large but
dim real image on the image sensor. To brighten this image, the long-focal-length lens
must have a large aperture so that it gathers lots of light. The f-number, the ratio of a
lensâs focal length to its aperture, characterizes the brightness of the lensâs image.
How Optical Recording and Communication Work: A CD, DVD, or Blu-ray represents
sound or video information in digital form as a pattern of pits on a thin reflective layer
inside the disc. The player uses a beam of laser light to read that pattern. As the disc
rotates, the pits pass through the focused laser beam and the amount of reflected
light fluctuates up and down. The player monitors the reflected light and uses it both
to recreate the music and to keep its optical system properly aligned. This continual
realignment allows the player to follow the spiral track of pits as the disc turns and to
keep the laser beam tightly focused on the reflective layer. The optical system, which
includes a laser diode, several photodiodes, and a variety of lenses and other optical
elements, is so well designed and executed that the spot it creates on the reflective
layer is limited in how small it can be only by diffraction effects due to the wave nature of light.
Laser light can also carry information long distances through an optical fiber. Made
from a core of extremely transparent glass that is clad in a second glass, this fiber confines light via total internal reflection. As light attempts to leave the core at a shallow
angle, it is perfectly reflected from the boundary with the cladding and continues
through the fiber for great distances.
How Audio Players Work: An audio player combines a computer and an audio amplifier
into a single unit. The playerâs computer stores and retrieves the sound information in
digital form, with each air pressure measurement represented by a collection of binary
bits. These bits can take only values of 0 or 1. For long-term storage, the player places
its digital sound information in flash memory and/or magnetic disk memory. For temporary storage while playing a song or working on its song collection, it uses dynamic
memory.
After the playerâs computer has manipulated that information digitally, using logic
elements built primarily from MOSFETs, it passes the digital information to a digitalto-analog converter and that information then takes analog form. This analog signal

423

424

CHAPT ER 14 Optics and Electronics

represents sound as a current thatâs proportional to the soundâs shift in air pressure
away from atmospheric pressure.
The analog sound signal enters the input circuit of the playerâs audio amplifier,
which makes use of MOSFETs. This amplifier uses power obtained from the battery
to produce an output signal that represents the same sound but with increased voltage
and current. This amplified output signal has enough power to produce loud sound in
the headphones.

into space to see how the universe works, and more carefully into matter and motion to see how
complicated things can be understood in terms of simple laws. Among the most important tools
that these scientists have to work with are quantum theory and the theory of relativity. This chapter
will look at some of the ways in which modern physics affects our lives.

Radiation-Damaged Paper

One path of modern physics involves the control and use
of high-energy radiation. Although our access to most
forms of high-energy radiation is restricted, thereâs one
source that anyone can useâthe sun. Because the sunâs
ultraviolet light is energetic enough to damage chemical
bonds and rearrange molecules, it can provide us with a
glimpse of the effects that occur with X-rays and
beyond.
To see sun damage for yourself, expose some sheets
of colored construction paper to direct sunlight for a few
days. Cover the paper with some opaque objects such as
coins and place it outdoors. Donât cover the paper with
glass because glass absorbs enough ultraviolet light to
slow the damage process. After a day or two, you should

find that the exposed portions of the paper have lightened;
the sunâs ultraviolet radiation has destroyed some of the
dye molecules in the paper. If you find that nothing happens, the dye is evidently robust enough to tolerate ultraviolet light for a while.
Try the experiment again with different papers and
different colors. Which papers fade fastest? Do they seem
to have a half-life? How could you tell?
This same optical bleaching appears on items that are
displayed in shop windows and on outdoor furniture. It

itâs radiation damage.

weapons so difficult to build? Why do we associate uranium
and plutonium with nuclear weapons? How much uranium or
plutonium does it take to build a bomb?

Uranium (238U) sphere

The atomic bomb is one of the most remarkable and infamous
inventions of the twentieth century. It followed close on the
heels of various developments in the understanding of nature,
developments that in many ways made the invention of nuclear
weapons inevitable. By the late 1930s, scientists had discovered most of the principles behind nuclear energy and were
well aware of how those principles might be applied. The
onset of World War II prompted concern that Germany would
choose to follow the military path of nuclear energy. Propelled
by fear, curiosity, and temptation, the scientists, engineers,
and politicians of that time brought nuclear weapons into existence. The world has lived in the shadow of these terrible
devices ever since.
Questions to Think About: Where is nuclear energy stored in
the atoms? From where did this nuclear energy come? How do

Experiments to Do: Since uranium and plutonium arenât sold
in hardware stores, you wonât be able to build your own bomb.
However, you can get a feel for the way a chain reaction works
by playing with a box of dominoes. If you stand the dominoes
on end on a level table, each of them will have extra gravitational potential energy that it can release by tipping over. If
you spread the dominoes widely about the table and then give
the table a gentle shake, theyâll tip over one by one.
However, if you pack the dominoes tightly together, so
that one falling domino can knock over others, theyâll no longer
be independent. As you jiggle the table, nothing will happen
until the first domino falls, but then many or even all of the
dominoes will tip over in quick succession. You will have created a chain reaction, where a single event triggers an everincreasing number of subsequent events. What characteristics
of the dominoes and their arrangement determine whether or
not such a chain reaction occurs? Can you envision a scenario
in which a single tipping domino could trigger the release of an
enormous amount of stored energy? Another chain reaction,
this time in the decay of atomic nuclei, is what makes nuclear
weapons possible.

Background
At the end of the nineteenth century, classical physics reigned supreme. Here classical physics means the rules of motion and gravitation identified by such people as
Galileo, Newton, and Kepler, and the rules of electricity and magnetism developed by
others, including AmpĂ¨re, Coulomb, Faraday, and Maxwell. It was generally felt that
most of physics was well understood. Physicists knew all the laws governing the
behavior of objects in our universe, and all that was left to do was to apply those laws
to more and more complicated examples. It was a time when physicists didnât know
what they didnât know.
However, a few nagging problems remainedâspecific difficulties that couldnât be
explained by the rules of classical physics. Among these were the spectrum of light emitted
by a blackbody, the photoelectric effect in which electrons are ejected from metals by light,
and the apparent absence of an ether or medium in which light traveled. At the beginning
of the twentieth century, the whole of classical physics collapsed under the weight of these
seemingly trivial difficulties, and a largely new understanding of the universe emerged. The
major advances took 25 years, from 1901 to 1926, and the time since has largely been spent
applying those new laws to more and more complicated examples.

Nuclear Weapons

427

The two main developments, both essential to the making of the atomic bomb, were
the discoveries of quantum physics and relativity. Often these are called quantum theory
and the theory of relativity. But while the word theory might imply that theyâre somehow
on shaky ground, theyâre not theories in the sense of hypotheses waiting to be tested. In
fact, theyâve been confirmed countless times since they were developed and have been
shown to have enormous predictive power. Rather, theyâre theories in the sense of being
carefully constructed and codified rules that model the behavior of the physical universe in
which we live. Between them, these two theories made the discovery of nuclear forces and
nuclear energy unavoidable. Finally, given peopleâs love for gadgets and power, they also
made nuclear weapons inevitable.
Check Your Understanding #1: In Theory, It Means That . . .
If something is referred to as a theory, how likely is it to be true?
Answer: That depends completely on the theory and the extent to which it has been compared to the
real world.
Why: A great many theories have been formulated to explain the world around us. Each of these
theories is an attempt at describing some particular behavior of our universe in terms of various rules
or mechanisms. However, until a theory has been tested by comparing it carefully to the system itâs
trying to explain, you canât tell whether itâs true or not. Some theories are eventually proven true,
others false, and many remain uncertain. The theories of relativity and quantum physics have long
since been proven true, although there is always the possibility that they may be only parts of a more
complete theory.

The Nucleus and Radioactive Decay
Though the name atomic bomb has stuck for more than half a century, the more
correct name would be nuclear bomb. The items that are responsible for the
energy released by nuclear weapons are not atoms but tiny pieces of atomsâ
their nuclei (plural of nucleus). Before we can discuss nuclei, though, letâs put
them into context. Letâs start by looking at atoms.
To get an idea of just how tiny atoms are, imagine magnifying a grain of
table salt, which is 1 mm (0.04 in) on a side, until it is the size of the state of
Colorado. That grain would then appear as an orderly arrangement of spherical
particles, each about the size of a grapefruit (Fig. 15.1.1). These spherical particles would be single atoms, and there would be about 7.2 million of them
along each edge of the grain.
Table salt crystal
(Sodium chloride)
Like most solids, table salt is a crystal and its atoms are bound to one
another by their outermost components, their electrons. Electrons dominate the
Chlorine negative ion
chemistry of atoms and molecules. Sodium is a reactive metal because of its
Diameter: 1.81 x 10â10 meter
electrons, and chlorine is a reactive gas because of its electrons. When mixed,
these two chemicals react violently to form table salt and release a considerSodium positive ion
Diameter: 0.97 x 10â10 meter
able amount of light and heat. This, then, is a true âatomic bomb.â
Fig. 15.1.1 A salt crystal
Obviously, something is missing here. If a crazy person could buy a kilogram or two of sodium and a tank of chlorine from a chemical company and destroy an is an orderly array of
positively charged sodium
entire city, rural living would be a whole lot more popular. Fortunately the energy released ions and negatively charged
by chemical reactions is fairly limited. A kilogram of chemical atomic explosives just canât chlorine ions. These ions
do that much damage. However, nuclear bombs tap an entirely different store of energy are held together by the
attractive forces between
deep within the atoms.
Although all nuclear weaponry is often attributed to Einsteinâs famous equation, E = mc2, oppositely charged ions.
The ions are so small that
that notion is vastly oversimplified. Nonetheless, this equation is quite significant. As we there are about 7.2 million
noted in Section 4.2, one of Einsteinâs discoveries at the beginning of the twentieth century ions on the edge of a
was that matter and energy are in some respects equivalent. In certain circumstances, mass 1-mm-wide salt crystal.

can become energy or energy can become mass. This equivalence is part of the theory of
relativity and has some interesting consequences. It implies that an object can reduce its
mass by transferring energy to its surroundings. Thus, if you weigh an object before and
after it undergoes some internal transformation, you can use any weight loss to determine
how much energy was released from the object by that transformation.
Because of this equivalence, mass and changes in mass can be used to locate energy
thatâs hidden within normal matter. This technique is important in nuclear physics, but it
also applies to chemistry. When sodium and chlorine react to form table salt, their combined mass decreases by a tiny amount. Whatâs missing is some chemical potential energy,
which becomes light and heat and escapes from the mixture. In leaving, this chemical
potential energy reduces the mass of the sodium and chlorine mixture by about 1 part in 10
billion. That tiny change in mass is too small to detect with present measuring devices,
although scientists are working on techniques that will soon make it possible to measure
mass changes due to forming chemical bonds.
Electrons are, however, by far the lightest part of an atom and thus have relatively little
mass to release as energy. Most of an atomâs mass is located in its nucleus. The nucleus is
fantastically smallâonly a little more than 10â15 m in diameter. If you were to peer into
one of the grapefruit-size sodium ions of our giant salt crystal, you would see a tiny particle
at its center. There, just at the threshold of visibility, would be the ionâs nucleus, only 1 Îźm
(0.00004 in) in diameter. The remaining 99.9999999999999% of the ion is occupied only
by its 10 electrons in their orbitals.
The sodium nucleus contains 11 protons and 12 neutrons (Fig. 15.1.2). Each of these
nuclear particles, or nucleons, has about 2000 times as much mass as an electron, so
99.975% of the sodium ionâs mass is in this nucleus. Thus, while the electrons are certainly
important to chemistry and matter as we know it, their contribution to the ionâs mass is
insignificant. The ion is mostly empty space, lightly filled with fluffy electrons and having
a tiny nuclear lump at its center.
The nucleons that make up this nucleus experience two competing forces. The first of
these forces is the familiar electrostatic repulsion between like electric charges. Because
each proton in the nucleus has a single positive charge, theyâre constantly trying to push
one another out of the nucleus. However, the second of these forces is attractive and holds
the nucleus together. This new force is called the nuclear force, and at short distances it
dominates the weaker electrostatic repulsion. However, the nuclear force attracts the nucleons toward one another only when theyâre touching. As soon as theyâre separated, theyâre
on their own.
The competition between these two forcesâthe repulsive electrostatic force between
like charges and the attractive nuclear force between nucleonsâis analogous to what happens in a familiar toy (Figs. 15.1.3 and 15.1.4). This hopping toy has a suction cup attached
to a spring, and the spring tries to separate the toyâs top from its base while the suction cup
tries to keep the two parts together. When the two parts are well separated, only the spring
exerts a force. But when the two parts touch, the suction cup begins to act and holds the two
parts together.
What makes the hopping toy exciting is that its suction cup leaks. Eventually, the
suction cup lets go and allows the spring to toss the toy into the air. Suppose, however,
that the suction cup didnât leak. Once pushed together, the pieces would never separate
and the spring would retain its stored energy indefinitely. To get the suction cup to let go,
you would have to pull it away from the base. Only then could the spring release its
stored energy.
In effect, an energy barrier would be preventing the leak-free toy from hopping. Until
you did a little work on it by pulling the suction cup off the base, it wouldnât be able to
release its stored energy. Another example of a system that needs energy to release energy
is a bottle of champagne, where you must push on the cork to help it out of the neck. After
that initial investment of energy, a great deal of energy is released as gas inside the bottle
blasts the cork across the room.

Nuclear Weapons

The nucleus is in a similar situation. The attractive nuclear force prevents the nucleus
from coming apart, despite the enormous amount of electrostatic potential energy it contains. The nuclear force creates an energy barrier that prevents the nucleons from separating. Unless something adds energy to the nucleus to help the nucleons break free of the
nuclear force, the nucleus will remain together forever. At least, thatâs the prediction of
classical physics.
Quantum physics, however, has an important influence on the behavior of the nucleus.
One of the many peculiar effects of quantum physics is that you can never really tell exactly
where an object is located, or at least not for long. That fuzziness is a manifestation of the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which observes that some pairs of physical quantities,
such as position and momentum or energy and time, are not entirely independent and cannot be determined simultaneously beyond a certain accuracy. This principle is a result of
the partly wave and partly particle nature of objects in our universe (Section 13.2). Since
waves are normally broad things that occupy a region of space rather than a single point,
objects in our universe normally donât have exact locations.
The smaller an objectâs mass, the fuzzier it is and the more uncertain its location.
Although the fuzzy nucleons in a nucleus will normally stay in contact with one another for
an extremely long time, thereâs always a tiny chance that theyâll find themselves temporarily separated by a distance thatâs beyond the reach of the nuclear force. The nucleons will
then suddenly be free of one another, and electrostatic repulsion will push them apart in a
process called radioactive decay. The quantum process that allows the nucleons to escape
from the nuclear force without first obtaining the energy needed to surmount the energy
barrier is called tunneling because the nucleons effectively tunnel through the barrier. We
first encountered quantum tunneling in Section 14.3, when we saw that erasing flash memory requires that electrons tunnel through an insulating barrier.
Natural radioactive decay is a perfectly random process. Although half of a large population of identical radioactive nuclei will decay in a certain amount of time, you absolutely cannot predict in advance which of the original nuclei will have survived. Because of
this randomness, radioactive decay is characterized simply by a half-life, the time required
for half of the nuclei to decay. After one half-life, only half the original nuclei will remain
intact. If you wait a second half-life, only a quarter of the original nuclei will remain (half
of the remaining half). After a third half-life, only an eighth will remain (half of the remaining half of a half). And so on.
This halving of the population with each additional half-life is a type of exponential
decay. In general, the fraction of nuclei remaining after a given amount of time is one-half
raised to the power of the time divided by the half-life. Written as a word equation, that
relationship is:

Radioactivity goes away, but you have to wait it out.
Although most radioactive nuclei have short half-lives and donât linger long in our
environment, there are a few with half-lives of billions of years. It is those long-lived radioactive nuclei, particularly uranium and thorium nuclei, that have survived since the formation of Earth, remain abundant in nature, and gave rise to nuclear weapons.

Check Your Understanding #2: Who Hid the Energy?
When a large nucleus breaks apart into fragments, it releases a great deal of energy. In what form was
that energy stored in the intact nucleus?
Answer: It was stored as electrostatic potential energy in the repulsion between protons.
Why: Although it is routinely called nuclear energy, much of the energy stored in radioactive nuclei
is actually electrostatic potential energy. Assembling a giant nucleus out of positively charged particles requires a considerable amount of work against electrostatic forces, and it is that stored work
thatâs released when the nucleus decays.

A small fraction of the carbon found in Earthâs atmosphere is carbon 14, a rare, radioactive form thatâs
synthesized by cosmic rays and has a half-life of 5730 years. While plants and animals are alive, they
incorporate carbon 14 into their tissues along with ordinary carbon. Once they die, the fraction of
carbon 14 in their tissues begins to decrease as the carbon 14 nuclei decay. If you are a museum
curator and someone donates a garment that is supposed to be 1001 years old, what fraction of the
original carbon 14 should you expect to find in that garment when you examine its carbon content?
Answer: The fraction of the original carbon 14 that remains should be about 0.886.
Why: According to Eq. 15.1.1, the fraction of carbon 14 nuclei remaining after 1001 years should be

If you find that fraction of carbon 14 when you test the garment, that indicates that the fibers in the
garment come from plants or animals that died approximately 1001 years ago, although you canât tell
exactly when the fabric itself was woven. If you find a larger fraction, that proves that the garment is
less than 1001 years old.

Fission and Fusion
The more protons there are in a nucleus, the more they repel one another and the more
likely they are to cause radioactive decay. Adding additional neutrons to the nucleus reduces
this proton-proton repulsion by increasing the size of the nucleus without adding to its
positive charge. However, adding too many neutrons also destabilizes the nucleus for reasons that weâll discuss in Section 15.3. Thus, constructing a stable nucleus is a delicate
balancing act.
In nuclei with only a few protons, the attractive nuclear force wins big over the repulsive electrostatic force and the nucleons stick like crazy. These nuclei resemble hopping
toys with weak springs and big suction cups; once brought together, the pieces never come
apart. In fact, the average binding energy of the nucleons (the energy required to separate
them from one another divided by the number of nucleons) would increase if these nuclei
had even more protons and neutrons.
In nuclei with many protons, the electrostatic repulsion is so severe that the nuclear
force canât hold the nucleons together for long. These nuclei decay rapidly. They resemble
hopping toys with strong springs and small suction cups. The average binding energy of the
nucleons would increase if these nuclei had fewer protons and neutrons.
In nuclei with roughly 26 protons, in between the two extremes weâve just considered,
the attractive nuclear force and repulsive electrostatic force are nicely balanced. These
nuclei are extremely stable, and you canât increase the average binding energy of their
nucleons by adding or subtracting nucleons. Smaller nuclei can release potential energy by
growing to reach this intermediate size, while larger nuclei can release potential energy by
shrinking toward the same goal.

Fission
For a small nucleus to grow, something must push more nucleons

toward it. Electrostatic repulsion will initially oppose this growth, but once
everything touches, the nuclear force will bind the particles together and
release a large amount of potential energy. This coalescence process is

For a large nucleus to shrink, something must separate its pieces Incoming
beyond the reach of the nuclear force. Electrostatic repulsion will then neutron
push the fragments apart and release a large amount of potential energy.

ing polonium (named after Marieâs homeland) and radium.
In 1911, British physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871â1937) discovered that atoms have
nuclei. He subsequently found that nuclei sometimes shatter when struck by energetic helium
nuclei. In 1932, British physicist James Chadwick (1891â1974) discovered a fragment of the
nucleus, the neutron, that has no electric charge and can thus approach a nucleus without any
electrostatic repulsion. It was soon discovered that neutrons stick to the nuclei of many atoms.
The crucial discovery that made the atomic bomb possible was neutron-induced fission of nuclei. In 1934, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi (1901â1954) and his colleagues were
trying to solve a particular riddle about the nucleus, a radioactive decay process called beta
decay. They were adding neutrons to the nuclei of every atom they could get hold of. When
they added neutrons to uranium, with its huge nucleus, they observed the production of
some very short-lived radioactive systems. They thought that they had formed ultraheavy
nuclei and even went so far as to give these new elements tentative names.
Four years later, however, Austrian physicists Lise Meitner (1878â1968) and Otto
Frisch (1904â1979) and German chemists Otto Hahn (1879â1968) and Fritz Strassmann
(1902â1980) collectively showed 1 that what Fermiâs group had actually done was to
fragment uranium into lighter nuclei (Fig. 15.1.5). Many of the fragments created by this
induced fission were neutrons, which could themselves cause the destruction of other uranium nuclei.

Check Your Understanding #3: A Sticky Nuclear Problem
If you take two intermediate-size nuclei and combine them to make a single uranium nucleus, will
the process release or consume energy?
Answer: It will consume energy.
Why: To merge two smaller nuclei and form a uranium nucleus, you will have to push the two together
with considerable force because they contain many protons. You will have to do considerable work to
bring these nuclei close enough for the nuclear force to bind them. The energy you invested in this
new nucleus is the same energy that is released when it undergoes fission.

Fig. 15.1.6 A chain reaction occurs when the fragments of one fissioning nucleus induce fission in
at least one additional nucleus. Such a chain reaction is particularly easy in 235U, the light isotope of
uranium, where each fissioning nucleus releases an average of 2.5 neutrons.

Chain Reactions and the Fission Bomb
Physicists quickly realized that a chain reaction was possible, a reaction in which the fission of one uranium nucleus would induce fission in two nearby uranium nuclei, which
would in turn induce fission in four other uranium nuclei, and so on (Fig. 15.1.6). The result
would be a catastrophic nuclear process in which many or even most of the nuclei in a piece
of uranium would shatter and release fantastic amounts of energy.
In a sense, the remaining work toward both the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb
was a matter of technical details. Only four conditions had to be satisfied for an atomic or
fission bomb to be possible:
1. A source of neutrons had to exist in the bomb to trigger the explosion.
2. The nuclei making up the bomb had to be fissionable; that is, they had to fission
when hit by a neutron.
3. Each induced fission had to produce more neutrons than it consumed.
4. The bomb had to use the released neutrons efficiently so that each fission induced
an average of more than one subsequent fission.
Meeting the first condition was easy. Many radioactive elements emit neutrons. Meeting the
second and third conditions was more difficult. Here is where uranium fit into the picture. It
was known to be fissionable, and it was known to release more neutrons than it consumed.
However, not all uranium nuclei are the same. Although a uranium nucleus must contain 92 protons, so that it forms a neutral atom with 92 electrons and has all the chemical
characteristics of uranium (U in Fig. 13.2.5), the number of neutrons in that nucleus is
somewhat flexible. Nuclei that differ only in the numbers of neutrons they contain are
called isotopes, and natural uranium nuclei come in two isotopes: 235U and 238U, where the
number specifies how many nucleons are in each nucleus. The 235U nucleus contains 92
protons and 143 neutrons, for a total of 235 nucleons. In contrast, the 238U nucleus contains
238 nucleons: 92 protons and 146 neutrons.

Nuclear Weapons

It turns out that only 235U is suitable for a bomb. Itâs marginally stable, with too many
protons for the nuclear force to keep together, even with the diluting effects of 143 neutrons. Like many proton-rich nuclei, 235U eventually undergoes alpha decay; it emits a
helium nucleus (4He) and thereby loses two protons and two neutrons. 235U has a radioactive half-life of 710 million years. However, when struck by a neutron, 235U shatters immediately into fragments, and this induced fission releases about 2.5 neutrons.
238
U is slightly more stable than the lighter isotope, and its half-life is 4.51 billion years.
238
The U nucleus absorbs most neutrons without undergoing fission. Instead, it undergoes a
series of complicated nuclear changes that eventually convert it into plutonium, an element
not found in nature. It becomes 239Pu, which has a nucleus with 94 protons and 145 neutrons.
As weâll see later on, plutonium itself is useful for making nuclear weapons.
Thus 238U actually slows a chain reaction rather than encouraging it. Since only 235U can
support a chain reaction, natural uranium has to be separated before it can be used in a bomb.
235
U is quite rare, however. Earthâs store of uranium nuclei was created long ago, in the explosion of a dying star. That supernova heated the nuclei of smaller atoms so hot that they collided together and stuck. Uranium nuclei were formed, with the supernovaâs energy trapped
inside them. They were incorporated in the Earth during its formation about 4 or 5 billion
years ago and have been decaying ever since. The only uranium isotopes that remain in any
quantity are 235U and 238U. Since 235U is less stable, its percentage of the naturally occurring
uranium nuclei has dwindled to only 0.72%. The remaining 99+% of the uranium is 238U.
Separating 235U from 238U is extremely difficult. Since atoms containing these two
nuclei differ only in mass, not in chemistry, they can be separated only by methods that
compare their masses. Because the mass difference is relatively small, heroic measures are
needed to extract 235U from natural uranium. During World War II and the Cold War era,
the U.S. government developed enormous facilities for separating the two uranium isotopes. The need for such installations is one of the major obstacles to the proliferation of
nuclear weapons.
The last condition for sustaining a chain reaction is that the bomb must use neutrons
efficiently, so that each fission induces an average of more than one subsequent fission.
That means that the bombâs contents canât absorb neutrons wastefully and that it canât let
too many of them escape without causing fission. A lump of relatively pure 235U wouldnât
absorb neutrons wastefully, but it might allow too many of them to escape through its surface. For a chain reaction to occur, the lump must be large enough that each neutron has a
good chance of hitting another nucleus before it leaves the lump. The lump also should
have a minimal amount of surface. It should be a sphere.
How large must that sphere be? Since atoms are mostly empty space, a neutron can
travel several centimeters through a lump of uranium without hitting a nucleus. Thus a golf
ballâsize sphere of uranium would allow too many neutrons to escape. For a bare sphere of
235
U, the critical mass required to initiate a chain reaction is about 52 kg (115 lbm), a ball
about 17 cm (7 in) in diameter. At that point, each fission will induce an average of one
subsequent fission. For an explosive chain reaction, in which each fission induces an average of much more than one fission, additional 235U is neededâa supercritical mass. About
60 kg (132 lbm) will do it.
By 1945, the scientists and engineers of the Manhattan Project had found ways to meet
these four conditions and were prepared to initiate an explosive chain reaction. They had
accumulated enough 235U to construct a supercritical mass. Carefully machined pieces of
235
U would be put into the bomb so that they would join together at the moment the bomb
was to explode. When the critical mass was reached, a few initial neutrons would start the
chain reaction. When the uranium became supercritical, catastrophic fission would quickly
turn it into a tremendous fireball.
However, assembly was tricky. The supercritical mass had to be completely assembled
before the chain reaction was too far along; otherwise the bomb would begin to overheat
and explode before enough of its nuclei had time to fission. In pure 235U, the time it takes for
one fission to induce the next fission is only about 10 ns (10 nanoseconds or 10 billionths of

plutonium that had been synthesized from 238U in nuclear reactors. A nuclear reactor carries out a controlled chain reaction in uranium, and neutrons from this chain reaction can
convert 238U into 239Pu.
Like 235U, 239Pu meets the conditions for a bomb. The 239Pu nucleus is relatively unstable, with a half-life of only 24,400 years. It fissions easily when struck by a neutron and
releases an average of three neutrons when it does. Thus 239Pu can be used in a chain reaction. For a bare sphere of 239Pu, the critical mass is about 10 kg (22 lbm)âa ball about
10 cm (4 in) in diameter.
There is a problem with 239Pu, however. Itâs so radioactive and releases so many neutrons when it fissions that a chain reaction develops almost instantly. There is much less
time to assemble a supercritical mass of plutonium than there is with uranium. The cannon
assembly method wonât work because the plutonium will overheat and blow itself apart
before the cylinder can fully enter the sphere.
Thus a much more sophisticated assembly scheme was employed for the Gadget. At

bouncing off bowling balls. The implosion process compressed the plutonium well beyond
its normal density. With the plutonium nuclei packed more tightly together, they were more
likely to be struck by neutrons and undergo fission.
The scheme worked. The chain reaction that followed caused 17% of the plutonium
nuclei to fission and released energy equivalent to the explosion of about 22,000 tons of
TNT. The tower and equipment at the Trinity test site disappeared into vapor, and the desert
sands turned to glass for hundreds of meters in all directions. A nearly identical device
named âFat Manâ (Fig. 15.1.7b) was dropped over Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945, at

In the years following the first fission bombs, development focused on how best to
bring the fissionable material together. The longer a supercritical mass could be held
together before it overheated and exploded, the larger would be the fraction of its nuclei
that would fission and the greater the explosive yield. The crushing technique of The Gadget and Fat Man became the standard, and bombs grew smaller and more efficient at using
their nuclear fuel. The implosion process reduced the amount of plutonium needed to reach
a supercritical mass, so very small fission bombs were possible. The smallest atomic bomb,

What would happen if you slowly moved two 30-kg (66-lbm) hemispheres of 235U together to form a
single sphere?
Answer: Before they actually touched, a chain reaction would occur.
Why: As soon as the hemispheres became close enough that each fission began to induce an average
of one subsequent fission, a chain reaction would occur. You would have assembled a critical mass.
The hemispheres would begin to get hotter and hotter and would eventually melt or explode. Because
they would blow apart before most of the nuclei could fission, any explosion would be rather small.
But you would suffer severe radiation injury. Just such an accident killed Louis Slotin during the
Manhattan Project.

The Fusion or Hydrogen Bomb
Since fissionable material begins to explode as soon as it exceeds critical mass, this critical
mass limits the size and potential explosive yield of a fission bomb. In search of a way
around this limit, bomb scientists took a look back at small nuclei and figured out how to
extract energy by sticking them together.
The fission bomb brought to Earth, for the first time, temperatures that had previously been observed only in stars. Stars obtain most of their energy by fusing hydrogen

energy. Because hydrogen nuclei are protons and repel one another with tremendous forces, hydrogen doesnât normally undergo fusion here on Earth.
To cause fusion, something must bring those protons close enough for the
nuclear force to stick them together. The only practical way we know of to
bring the nuclei together is to heat them so hot that they crash into each
other. That is what happens in a fusion bomb, also called a thermonuclear or
hydrogen bomb.
Deuterium,
In a fusion bomb, an exploding fission bomb heats a quantity of hydrotritium,
or lithium deuteride
gen to about 100 million degrees Celsius (Fig. 15.1.11). At that temperature, hydrogen nuclei begin to collide with one another. To ease the nuclear
fusion processes, heavy isotopes of hydrogen are used: deuterium (2H) and
tritium (3H). While the normal hydrogen nucleus (1H) contains only a proHigh

into energy, the helium nucleus and the neutron fly away from one another

Check Your Understanding #5: Itâs Hard to Get Together
Why must hydrogen be heated to an extremely high temperature to initiate fusion?
Answer: The protons in hydrogen nuclei repel one another quite strongly at short distances. They
must be moving very quickly with lots of thermal energy for them to touch.
Why: In a gas, thermal energy takes the form of kinetic energy. The hotter the gas, the faster the
particles are moving. At 100 million degrees Celsius, the hydrogen nuclei are moving so fast that
they can overcome their electrostatic repulsion and touch. When they do, the nuclear force pulls
them together and they fuse.

Nuclear Weapons

Heat, Radiation, and Fallout
Once a nuclear weapon has explodedâafter its fissionable material has fissioned and its
fusible material has fusedâwhat then? First, a vast number of nuclei and subatomic particles emerge from the explosion at enormous speeds, many at nearly the speed of light.
These particles crash into nearby atoms and molecules, heating them to fantastic temperatures and producing a local fireball around the bomb itself. They also cause extensive radiation damage in the surrounding area.
Second, a flash of light emerges from the explosion, caused partly by the fission and
fusion processes themselves and partly by the ultrahot fireball that follows. This light is not
only visible light, but also every portion of the electromagnetic spectrum from infrared to
visible to ultraviolet to X-rays to gamma rays. It burns things nearby, inside and out.
Third, the explosion creates a huge pressure surge in the air around the fireball. A
shock wave propagates outward from the fireball at the speed of sound, knocking over
everything in its path for a considerable distance. Fourth, the rarefied and superheated air
rushes upward, lifted by buoyant forces, to create a towering mushroom cloud.
However, the most insidious aftereffect of a nuclear explosion is fallout, the creation
and release of radioactive nuclei. Fission converts uranium and plutonium nuclei into
smaller nuclei. Each new nucleus has several dozen protons and its share of neutrons from
the nucleus that fissioned. These new nuclei attract electrons and become seemingly normal atoms like iodine or cobalt. But while large nuclei such as uranium need extra neutrons
to dilute their protons and reduce their electrostatic repulsions, intermediate and small
nuclei like those of iodine and cobalt donât need as many neutrons. The new nuclei wind up
with too many neutrons and are radioactive. They have half-lives that are anywhere from
thousandths of a second to thousands of years.
Until they decay, the atoms that contain these nuclei are almost indistinguishable from
normal atoms. They are radioactive isotopes of common atoms, and our bodies naively incorporate them into our tissues. There they sit, performing whatever chemical tasks our bodies require
of them. Eventually, however, these radioactive atoms fall apart and release nuclear energy.
Because each radioactive decay that occurs near us or inside us releases perhaps a million times
more energy than is present in a chemical bond, these decays cause chemical changes in our
cells. They can kill cells or damage the cellsâ genetic information, potentially causing cancer.
This transmutation of elements, the restructuring of nuclei to transform atoms of one
element into another, occurs in an uncontrolled fashion in nuclear weapons and produces a
lethal mix of unstable isotopes. Those isotopes take years to decay out of the environment,
and all anyone can do is wait. Even nuclear weapons with poor explosive yields, so-called
dirty bombs, can litter the surrounding landscape with radioactive debris. Nuclear reactors
produce similar mixtures of radioactive isotopes in their fuel assemblies and core structures, which is why disposing of spent nuclear fuel remains so problematic.
On the other hand, radioactive isotopes have been a boon to medicine and biochemistry, where many of them have found valuable and life-saving applications. Moreover, in
controlled circumstances, elements can be transmuted systematically to generate primarily
desirable isotopes rather than a random assortment. Such transmutation is difficult and
expensive, and it involves nuclear rather than chemical processes. Although the alchemistsâ
dream of transmuting lead into gold is finally possible, itâs not a path to riches.
COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS: Radiation and Radioactivity
Misconception: When a material such as food is exposed to microwave, radio wave, infrared, or
ultraviolet radiation, it may become radioactive.
Resolution: To render a material radioactive, something must alter its nuclei so that they are no
longer stable. Such an alteration requires vastly more energy than one of those low-energy photons can provide. The only forms of electromagnetic radiation with enough energy per photon to
affect nuclei are gamma rays and, occasionally, X-rays.

Normal iodine (127I) is stable forever. But the fission product 131I is radioactive and has a half-life of
about 8 days. What are the consequences of eating 131I?
Answer: The 131I is incorporated into your body and exposes you to radiation, particularly during the
first few weeks before most of it has decayed away.
Why: Your body canât distinguish 127I from 131I because theyâre chemically identical. Since your body
uses iodine in its functions, any 131I that you ingest is likely to become part of your bodyâs iodine
supply. Over the next 8 days, about half of this iodine will decay and expose you to radiation. The
remaining 131I is also radioactive, and half of this amount will decay in the next 8 days. Thus after
16 days, only one-quarter of the original amount will remain. After 24 days, only one-eighth will
remain. And so on.

useful energy. By controlling the same nuclear reactions

century since their conception, nuclear fission reactors
have developed into a fairly mature technology and have
become one of our major sources of energy. Nuclear fusion

Questions to Think About: Why doesnât a nuclear reactor
explode once it reaches a critical mass? How is the energy
released in a nuclear reactor turned into electricity? What
caused the famous accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl,
and Fukushima Daiichi? How can hydrogen fusion be initiated
in a container? How is hydrogen held together at the temperatures needed for fusion?
Experiments to Do: A nuclear reactor operates very close to
critical mass. Below critical mass, each spontaneous fission
induces a limited number of subsequent fissions. Above critical mass, the number of subsequent fissions becomes unlimited. A similar effect occurs in a sand pile as it becomes
steeper. If you pour sand slowly onto the pile, its shape will
change and its steepness will increase. Initially, the grains will
stay where they land, but once the pile becomes quite steep,
they will begin to roll down the pileâs sides. If the pile becomes
too steep, a single grain of sand can trigger an avalanche. That
same behavior occurs in a reactor thatâs near critical massâa
single spontaneous fission can trigger an enormous number of
subsequent fissions.

Nuclear Fission Reactors
Assembling a critical mass of uranium doesnât always cause a nuclear explosion. In fact,
itâs rather hard to cause a big explosion. The designers of the atomic bomb had to assemble
not just a critical mass but a supercritical mass, and they had to do it in much less than a
millionth of a second. That rapid assembly is not something that happens easily or by accident. Itâs much easier to reach a critical mass slowly, in which case the uranium will simply
become very hot. It may ultimately explode from overheating, but it will not vaporize
everything in sight.

Nuclear Reactors

This slow assembly of a critical mass is the basis for nuclear fission reactors. Their
principal product is heat, which is usually used to generate electricity. Fission reactors are
much simpler to build and operate than fission bombs because they donât require such
purified fissionable materials. In fact, with the help of some clever tricks, nuclear reactors
can be made to operate even with natural uranium.
Letâs begin by showing that a fission chain reaction doesnât always lead to an explosion. Whatâs important is just how fast the fission rate increases. In an atomic bomb, it
increases breathtakingly quickly. At detonation, the fissionable material is far above the
critical mass, so the average fission induces not just one but perhaps two subsequent fissions. With only about 10 ns (10 nanoseconds) between one fission and the two it induces,
the fission rate may double every 10 ns. In less than a millionth of a second, most of the
nuclei in the material undergo fission, releasing their energy before the material has time
to blow apart.
However, things arenât as dramatic right at critical mass, where the average fission
induces just one subsequent fission. Since each generation of fissions simply reproduces
itself, the fission rate remains essentially constant. Only spontaneous fissions cause it to
rise at all. The fissionable material steadily releases thermal energy, and that energy can be
used to power an electric generator.
A nuclear reactor contains a core of fissionable material. Because of the way in
which this core is assembled, itâs very close to a critical mass. Several neutronabsorbing rods, called control rods, which are inserted into the reactorâs core, determine whether itâs above or below critical mass. Pulling the control rods out of the core
increases the chance that each neutron will induce a fission and moves the core toward
supercriticality. Dropping the control rods into the core increases the chance that each
neutron will be absorbed before it can induce a fission and moves the core toward
subcriticality.
A nuclear reactor uses feedback to maintain the fission rate at the desired level. If the
fission rate becomes too low, the control system slowly pulls the control rods out of the
core to increase the fission rate. If the fission rate becomes too high, the control system
drops the control rods into the core to decrease the fission rate. Itâs like driving a car. If
youâre going too fast, you ease off the gas pedal. If you are going too slowly, you push
down on the gas pedal.
The car-driving analogy illustrates another important point about reactors. Both cars
and reactors respond relatively slowly to adjustments of their controls. It would be hard to
drive a car that stopped instantly when you lifted your foot off the gas pedal and leaped to
supersonic speed when you pushed your foot down. Similarly, it would be impossible to
operate a reactor that immediately shut down when you dropped the control rods in and that
instantly exploded when you pulled the control rods out.
But reactors, like cars, donât respond quickly to movements of the control rods.
Thatâs because the final release of neutrons following some fissions is slow. When a
235
U nucleus fissions, it promptly releases an average of 2.47 neutrons which induce
other fissions within a thousandth of a second. However, some of the fission fragments
are unstable nuclei that decay and release neutrons long after the original fission. On
average, each 235U fission eventually produces 0.0064 of these delayed neutrons, which
then go on to induce other fissions. It takes seconds or minutes for these delayed neutrons to appear, and they slow the response of the reactor. The reactorâs fission rate
canât increase quickly because it takes a long time for the delayed neutrons to build up.
The fission rate canât decrease quickly because it takes a long time for the delayed
neutrons to go away.
To further ease the operation of modern nuclear reactors, they are designed to be stable
and self-regulating. This self-regulation ensures that the core automatically becomes subcritical if it overheats. As weâll see later on, this self-regulation was not present in the
design of Chernobyl Reactor Number 4 and that led to disaster.

Check Your Understanding #1: No Delayed Decays
If the fission of 235U produced only stable fission fragments, would a nuclear reactor be easier or
harder to operate?
Answer: It would be much harder to operate.
Why: Without any delayed neutrons, one generation of fissions would finish inducing the next generation of fissions in about a thousandth of a second and the response of the reactor core to changes
in the criticality would become extremely rapid. When the reactor core became supercritical, its fission rate would skyrocket and when it became subcritical, its fission rate would plummet. Trying to
keep the fission rate steady would be a wild roller coaster ride, and the reactor would be impossible
or impractical to control. Fortunately the delayed neutrons slow the reactorâs response to changes in
criticality, so it can be controlled fairly easily.

Thermal Fission Reactors
The basic concept of a nuclear reactor is simple: assemble a critical mass of fissionable
material and adjust its criticality to maintain a steady fission rate. But what should the fissionable material be? In a fission bomb, it must be relatively pure 235U or 239Pu. In a fission
reactor, however, it can be a mixture of 235U and 238U. It can even be natural uranium. The
trick is to use thermal neutrons, slow-moving neutrons that have only the kinetic energy
associated with the local temperature.
In a fission bomb, 238U is a serious problem because it captures the fast-moving neutrons
emitted by fissioning 235U nuclei. Natural uranium alone canât sustain a chain reaction because
its many 238U nuclei gobble up most of the fast-moving neutrons before they can induce more
fissions in the rare 235U nuclei. The uranium must be highly enrichedâmost of its 238U nuclei
must be removed so that it contains far more than the natural abundance of 235U.
Slow-moving neutrons have a different experience as they travel through natural uranium. For complicated reasons, the 235U nuclei seek out slow-moving neutrons and capture
them with remarkable efficiency. 235U nuclei are so good at catching slow-moving neutrons
that they easily win out over the more abundant 238U nuclei. Even in natural uranium, a
slow-moving neutron is more likely to be caught by a 235U nucleus than it is by a 238U
nucleus. As a result, itâs possible to sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction in natural uranium if all of the neutrons are slow moving.
Because 235U nuclei emit fast-moving neutrons when they fission, natural or slightly
enriched uranium alone canât use the slow-moving-neutron effect to maintain a chain reaction. However, most nuclear reactors contain something else besides uranium, natural or
otherwise. Along with uranium, they use a material called a moderator that slows the neutrons down so that 235U nuclei can grab them. A fast-moving neutron from a fissioning 235U
nucleus enters the moderator, rattles around for about a thousandth of a second, and emerges
as a slow-moving neutron, one with only thermal energy left. It then induces fission in
another 235U nucleus. Once the moderator is present, even natural uranium can sustain a
chain reaction! Reactors that carry out their chain reactions with slow-moving, or thermal,
neutrons are called thermal fission reactors.
To be a good moderator, a material must remove energy and momentum from the neutrons without absorbing them. A fast-moving fission neutron entering that moderator
should leave with only thermal energy. The best moderators are small nuclei that rarely or
never absorb neutrons and donât fall apart during collisions with them. Hydrogen (1H),
deuterium (2H), helium (4He), and carbon (12C) are all good moderators. When a fastmoving neutron hits the nucleus of one of these atoms, the collision resembles that between
two bumper cars (Section 2.3). Because the fast-moving neutron transfers some of its
energy and momentum to the nucleus, the neutron slows down while the nucleus speeds
up. That collision is most effective when the neutron and nucleus have similar masses, so
small nuclei are better moderators than large ones.

Fig. 15.2.1 The core of a thermal fission reactor consists of uranium pellets interspersed with a moderator
that slows the fission neutrons to thermal energies. Neutron-absorbing control rods are inserted into the
core to control the fission rate. A cooling fluid such as water flows through the core to extract heat.

Water, heavy water (water containing the heavy isotope of hydrogen, deuterium or 2H),
and graphite (carbon) are the best moderators for nuclear reactors. They slow neutrons
down to thermal speeds without absorbing many of them. Of these moderators, heavy
water is the best because it slows the neutrons quickly yet doesnât absorb them at all. However, heavy water is expensive because only 0.015% of hydrogen atoms are deuterium and
separating that deuterium from ordinary hydrogen is difficult.
Graphite moderators were used in many early reactors because graphite is cheap and
working with it is easy (see 2 ). However, graphite is a less efficient moderator than heavy
water, so graphite reactors had to be big. Furthermore, graphite can burn and was partly
responsible for two of the worldâs four major reactor accidents. Normal, or âlight,â water is
cheap, safe, and an efficient moderator, but it absorbs enough neutrons that it canât be used
with natural uranium. For use in a light-water reactor, uranium must be enriched slightly,
to about 2â3% 235U.

water passes through the core at high speeds. Heat flows into this
water and increases its temperature. In a boiling water reactor, the
water boils directly in the reactor core, creating high-pressure
steam that drives the turbines of an electric generator (Fig.
15.2.2). In a pressurized water reactor, the water is under enormous pressure, so it canât boil (Fig. 15.2.3). Instead, itâs pumped to a heat exchanger outside the reactor. This heat exchanger transfers heat to water in another pipe, which boils to
create the high-pressure steam that drives a generator (Fig. 15.2.4).
When properly designed, a water-cooled thermal fission reactor is inherently stable.
The cooling water is actually part of the moderator. If the reactor overheats and the water
escapes, there will no longer be enough moderator around to slow the fission neutrons
down. The fast-moving neutrons will be absorbed by 238U nuclei, and the chain reaction
will slow or stop.

Would wax made from hydrogen and carbon atoms be a good moderator?
Answer: Yes.
Why: Paraffin wax is made up of carbon and hydrogen atoms, both of which are good moderators. The
fast fission neutrons donât care what molecules the carbon or hydrogen nuclei are inside. They just
collide with those nuclei and lose energy and momentum. The problem with using wax as a reactor

Nuclear Reactors

Fast Fission Reactors
Thermal reactors require simple fuel and are relatively straightforward to construct. However, they consume only the 235U nuclei and leave the 238U nuclei almost unaffected. Anticipating the day when 235U will become scarce, several countries have built a different kind
of reactor that contains no moderator. Such reactors carry out chain reactions with fast-moving neutrons and are thus called fast fission reactors.
A fast fission reactor operates much like a controlled fission bomb and requires highly
enriched uranium fuel as well. While a thermal fission reactor can get by with natural uranium
or uranium that has been enriched to about 2â3% 235U, a fast fission reactor needs 25â50%
235
U fuel. That way, there are enough 235U nuclei around to maintain the chain reaction.
There is a side effect to operating a fast fission reactor. Many of the fast fission neutrons are captured by 238U nuclei, which then transform into 239Pu nuclei. Thus the reactor
produces plutonium as well as heat. For that reason, fast fission reactors are often called
breeder reactorsâthey create new fissionable fuel. The 239Pu can eventually replace the
235
U as the principal fuel used in the reactor.
A thermal fission reactor makes some plutonium, which is usually allowed to fission
in place, but a fast fission reactor makes a lot of it. Because plutonium can be used to make
nuclear weapons, fast fission reactors are controversial. However, because they convert
otherwise unusable 238U into a fissionable material, they use natural uranium far more efficiently than thermal fission reactors.
One interesting complication of the unmoderated design is that fast fission reactors
canât be water-cooled. If they were, the water would act as a moderator and slow the neutrons down. Instead, they are usually cooled with liquid sodium metal. The sodium nuclei
of 23Na rarely interact with fast-moving neutrons, so they donât slow them down.
Check Your Understanding #3: A Mix-Up at the Uranium Plant
What would happen if someone tried to fuel a fast fission reactor with natural uranium?
Answer: It would not sustain a chain reaction.
Why: Fast neutrons arenât good at inducing fission in 235U. If the reactor doesnât slow down the neutrons, most of them will zip right by the 235U nuclei and be captured by the more abundant 238U
nuclei of the natural uranium.

Fission Reactor Safety and Accidents
One of the greatest concerns with nuclear fission reactors is the control of radioactive
waste. Anything that comes in contact with the reactor core or the neutrons it emits becomes
somewhat radioactive. The fuel pellets themselves are quickly contaminated with all sorts
of fission fragments that include radioactive isotopes of many familiar elements. Some of
these radioactive isotopes dissolve in water or are gases, and all of them must be handled
carefully.
The first line of defense against the escape of radioactivity is the large and sturdy containment vessel around the reactor. Because most of the radioactive materials remain in the
reactor core itself or in the cooling fluid, they are trapped in the containment vessel. Whenever the nuclear fuel is removed for reprocessing, care is taken not to allow radioactive
materials to escape.
The other great concern is the safe operation of the reactors themselves. Like any
equipment, reactors experience failures of one type or another, and a safe reactor must not
respond catastrophically to such failures. Toward that end, reactors have emergency cooling systems, pressure-relief valves, and many ways to shut down the reactor. For example,
injecting a solution of sodium borate into the core cools it and stops any chain reactions.
The boron nuclei in sodium borate absorb neutrons extremely well and are the main con-

tents of most control rods. However, the best way to keep reactors safe is to design them so
that they naturally stop their chain reactions when they overheat.
There have been five major reactor accidents since the dawn of the nuclear age. The
first of these accidents began on October 7, 1957, during a maintenance procedure at Windscale Pile 1, one of Britainâs two original plutonium production reactors. The reactor was
cooled by air rather than water and had a graphite moderator. The reactorâs intense radiation modified the graphiteâs crystalline structure so that it gradually accumulated large
amounts of chemical potential energy. That potential energy had to be released periodically
by heating the graphite to about 250 Â°C so that it recrystallized. During the accident, however, hot spots developed unexpectedly in the moderator and fuel rods, the metallic uranium in those rods ignited, and the burning reactor core distributed radioactive debris
across the British countryside.
The second serious accident occurred at Three Mile Island on March 28, 1979. This
pressurized water thermal fission reactor shut down appropriately when the pumps that
circulated water in the power-generating loop stopped unexpectedly. Although this water
loop wasnât directly connected to the reactor, it was important for removing heat from the
reactor core. Even though the reactor shut down immediately, its neutron-absorbing control
rods swiftly stopping its chain reaction, the radioactive nuclei created by recent fissions
were still decaying and releasing energy. The core continued to release heat, and it eventually boiled the water in the cooling loop. This water escaped from the loop through a pressure-relief valve, and the top of the reactor core became exposed. With nothing to cool it,
the core became so hot that it suffered permanent damage. Some of the water from the
cooling loop found its way into an unsealed room, and the radioactive gases it contained
were released into the atmosphere.
The third and most serious accident occurred at Chernobyl Reactor Number 4 on April
26, 1986. This water-cooled, graphite-moderated thermal fission reactor was a cross
between a pressurized water reactor and a boiling water reactor. Cooling water flowed
through the reactor at high pressure but didnât boil until it was ready to enter the steamgenerating turbines.
The accident began during a test of the emergency core-cooling system. To begin the
test, the operators tried to reduce the reactorâs fission rate. However, the core had accumulated
many neutron-absorbing fission fragments, which made it incapable of sustaining a chain
reaction at a reduced fission rate. The chain reaction virtually stopped. To get the chain reaction running again, the operators had to withdraw a large number of control rods. These
control rods were motor-driven, and it would take about 20 seconds to put them back in again.
The operators now initiated the test by shutting off the cooling water. That should have
immediately shut down the reactor by inserting the control rods, but the operators had
overridden the automatic controls because they didnât want to have to restart the reactor a
second time. With nothing to cool it, the reactor core quickly overheated and the water
inside it boiled. The water had been acting as a moderator along with the graphite. However, the reactor was overmoderated, meaning it had more moderator than it needed. Getting rid of the water actually helped the chain reaction because the water had been absorbing some of the neutrons. The fission rate began to increase.
The operators realized they were in trouble and began to shut down the reactor manually. However, the control rods moved into the core too slowly to make a difference. As
water disappeared from the core, the core went âprompt critical.â The chain reaction no
longer had to wait for neutrons from the decaying fission fragments because prompt neutrons from the 235U fissions were enough to sustain the chain reaction on their own. The
reactorâs fission rate skyrocketed, doubling many times each second. The fuel became
white hot and melted its containers. Various chemical explosions blew open the containment vessel, and the graphite moderator caught fire.
The fire burned for 10 days before firefighters and pilots encased the wreckage in concrete. Many of these heroic people suffered fatal exposures to radiation. The burning core

Nuclear Reactors

released all its gaseous radioactive isotopes and many others into the atmosphere, forcing
the evacuation of more than 100,000 people and leading to thousands or perhaps tens of
thousands of premature cancer deaths in the millions of people exposed to the radioactive
debris. The accident site remains dangerously radioactive and will need careful tending for
centuries.
Although not a true reactor accident, the September 30, 1999, disaster in Tokai-mura,
Japan, did involve a critical mass and a resulting chain reaction. At about 10:35 am, employees of the Conversion Test Facility of JCO Co., Ltd. Tokai Works were pouring a solution
of uranyl (uranium) nitrate into a precipitation tank. Destined for an experimental fast fission reactor, this uranium had been enriched to about 18.8% 235U. Although the equipment
and facilities were designed to prevent the assembly of a critical mass, the workers decided
to save time by circumventing the safeguards and combining many small batches into one
large one.
After they had poured six or seven batches of uranyl nitrate solution into the stainless
steel tank through a sampling hole, the solution suddenly reached critical mass. There was
about 16.6 kg of enriched uranium in the tank, and a sudden burst of radiation was released.
The water temperature leapt upward, and the solutionâs resulting expansion dropped the
mixture below critical mass. However, as heat flowed from the solution to the water-cooled
jacket around the tank, the solution again approached critical mass. An episodic chain reaction continued in the tank for about 20 hours, until draining the cooling jacket of its neutron-reflecting water finally put an end to the critical mass.
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident north of Tokyo, Japan (the fifth reactor accident), began on March 11, 2011, following the 9.0-magnitude Tohoku earthquake and the
resulting tsunami. The Fukushima nuclear facility housed six separate boiling water reactors, but only reactors 1, 2, and 3 were operating at the time, and they shut down automatically after the earthquake. Even after stopping their chain reactions, however, those reactor
cores continued to generate heat through the decay of their vast accumulations of radioactive nuclei, and they needed to be water-cooled to avoid overheating. Emergency generators began supplying power to maintain that cooling.
When the tsunami struck the Tohoku coast less than an hour after the earthquake, it
inundated the nuclear facility, flooded its generators and switching equipment, and detached
the entire area from the Japanese electric power grid. Reactor cooling soon ceased, and
despite heroic efforts by emergency workers, it wasnât restored for days. By then, the reactors were damaged beyond repair, and the worldâs second worst nuclear accident was well
underway.
Lacking adequate cooling, the cores of reactors 1, 2, and 3 gradually overheated and
then melted. Explosions, pressure venting, and discharges of cooling water into the sea all
contributed to an enormous release of radioactive nuclei into the environment. Even spent
fuel in storage pools at the facility contributed to the overall accident because it also suffered overheating and damage when cooling was lost. The Fukushima Daiichi plant will
never reopen and will remain a radioactive disaster area for years to come.

One of the common fission fragments of 235U is 131I, a radioactive isotope of iodine. Iodine easily
becomes a gas. Why shouldnât you sit in a room full of used uranium pellets?
Answer: The 131I will enter the room air, and you will breathe it in. It will be incorporated into your
bodyâs iodine supply.
Why: The fission products of 235U include radioactive isotopes of almost every element. Some of
these isotopes are gaseous and can be absorbed by your lungs. Others can be carried away in water.
To safely contain the fission fragments from used nuclear fuel, these fragments must be carefully
separated and stored. Because the radioactive isotopes may continue to change from one element to
another, such storage is particularly tricky.

Nuclear Fusion Reactors
Nuclear fission reactors use a relatively rare fuelâuranium. Although Earthâs supply of
uranium is vast, most of that uranium is distributed broadly throughout Earthâs crust. There
are only so many deposits of high-grade uranium ores that are easily turned into pure uranium or uranium compounds. Fission reactors also produce all sorts of radioactive fission
fragments that must be disposed of safely. There is still no comprehensive plan for the
safekeeping of spent reactor fuels. These must be kept away from any contact with people
and animals virtually forever. No one really knows how to store such dangerous materials
for hundreds of thousands of years.
An alternative to nuclear fission is nuclear fusion. By joining hydrogen nuclei together,
heavier nuclei can be constructed. The amount of energy released in such processes is
enormous. Recall, however, that fusion is much harder to initiate than fission because it
requires that at least two nuclei be brought extremely close together. These nuclei are both
positively charged, and they repel one another fiercely. To make them approach one another
closely enough to stick, we must heat the nuclei to temperatures of more than 100 million
degrees Celsius.
The sun combines four hydrogen nuclei (1H) to form one nucleus of helium (4He), a
very complicated and difficult nuclear fusion reaction. For fusion to occur on Earth, it must
be done between the heavy isotopes of hydrogen: deuterium and tritium. These are the
isotopes used in thermonuclear weapons. If a mixture of deuterium and tritium are mixed
together and heated to about 100 million degrees Celsius, their nuclei will begin to fuse and
release energy. The deuterium and tritium become helium and neutrons.
In contrast to fission reactions, there are no radioactive fragments produced in fusion.
Tritium itself is radioactive, but it can easily be reprocessed into fuel and retained within
the reactor system. The dangerous neutrons can be caught in a blanket of lithium metal,
which then breaks into helium and tritium. Itâs convenient that new tritium is created by the
reaction because tritium isnât naturally occurring and must be made using nuclear reactions. Thus, fusion holds up the promise of producing relatively little radioactive waste. If
the neutrons that are released by fusion events are trapped by nuclei that donât become
radioactive, then there will be no radioactive contamination of the fusion reactor either.
This is easier said than done, but itâs better than in a fission reactor.
Unfortunately, heating deuterium and tritium and holding them together long enough
for fusion to occur isnât easy. There are two main techniques that are being tried: inertial
confinement fusion and magnetic confinement fusion.
Inertial confinement fusion uses intense pulses of laser light to heat and compress a
tiny sphere containing deuterium and tritium (Fig. 15.2.5). The pulses of light last only a
few trillionths of a second, but in that brief moment they vaporize and superheat the surface
of the sphere. The surface explodes outward, pushing off the inner portions of the sphere.
The sphereâs core experiences huge inward forces as a result, and it implodes. As the core
is compressed, its temperature rises to that needed to initiate fusion. In effect, it becomes a
tiny thermonuclear bomb, with the laser pulses providing the starting heat.
To date, inertial confinement fusion experiments have observed fusion in a small fraction of the deuterium and tritium nuclei. The technique is called inertial confinement fusion
because there is nothing holding or confining the ball of fuel. The laser beams crush it while
itâs in free fall, and its own inertia keeps it in place while fusion takes place. Unfortunately,

Fig. 15.2.5 In inertial confinement fusion experiments,
several laser beams are focused onto a tiny sphere
containing deuterium and tritium. These ultra-intense
pulsed beams compress and heat the sphere so that
fusion occurs.

Why canât you initiate fusion by running an electric discharge through deuterium and tritium in a
glass tube?
Answer: The gases will lose heat to the glass tube and will never reach the temperatures needed to
start fusion.

M

Why: Very hot gases lose heat extremely easily. The hotter the gas, the faster heat flows out of it.
Without something to keep the gas from touching the walls of the glass tube, it will never get close
to the 100 million degrees Celsius needed for fusion.

the lasers and other technologies needed to carry out inertial confinement fusion
are sufficiently complex and troublesome that this may never be viable as a
source of energy. Nonetheless, these experiments provide important information on the behaviors of fusion materials at high temperatures and pressures.
The other technique being developed to control fusion is magnetic confinement. When
you heat hydrogen atoms hot enough, they move so quickly and hit one another so hard that
their electrons are knocked off. Instead of a gas of atoms, you have a gas of free, positively
charged nuclei and negatively charged electronsâa plasma. A plasma differs from a normal gas because itâs affected by magnetic fields.
Because of the Lorentz force (see Section 12.2), charged particles that are moving in a
magnetic field tend to circle around magnetic field lines (Fig. 15.2.6). This cyclotron
motion occurs, for example, in the magnetron of a microwave oven. If the magnetic field
surrounding a charged particle is carefully shaped in just the right way, the charged particle
will find itself trapped by the magnetic field. No matter what direction it heads, the charged
particle will spiral around the magnetic field lines and will be unable to escape.
Magnetic confinement makes it possible to heat a plasma of deuterium and tritium to
fantastic temperatures with electromagnetic waves. Since the heating is done relatively
slowly, itâs important to keep heat from leaving the plasma. Magnetic confinement prevents
the plasma from touching the walls of the container, where it would quickly cool off.
One of the most promising magnetic confinement schemes is the tokamak. The main
magnetic field of the tokamak runs around in a circle to form a magnetic doughnut, or toroid (the geometrical name for a doughnut-shaped object) (Fig. 15.2.7). The magnetic field
is formed inside a doughnut-shaped chamber by running an electric current through coils
that are wrapped around the chamber. Plasma nuclei inside the chamber travel in spirals
around the magnetic field lines and donât touch the chamber walls. They are confined inside
the chamber and race around the doughnut endlessly. The nuclei can then be heated to the
extremely high temperatures they need to collide and fuse.
Magnetic confinement fusion reactors have observed considerable amounts of fusion.
They can briefly achieve scientific break-even, the point at which fusion is releasing enough
energy to keep the plasma hot all by itself. However, much more development is needed to
meet and exceed practical break-even, the point at which the entire machine produces more
energy than it needs to operate.

Patient support

Some of the most important recent advances in health care
have occurred at the border between medicine and physics. As
scientists have refined their understanding of atomic and
molecular structure and learned to control various forms of
radiation, they have invented tools that are enormously valuable for diagnosing and treating illness and injury. The developments continue, with new applications of physics appearing
in clinical settings almost every time you turn around. In this
section, weâll examine two of the most significant examples of
medical physics: the imaging techniques that are used to
detect problems and the radiation therapies that are used to
treat them.
Questions to Think About: Whatâs different about bones and
tissue that makes bones appear light in an X-ray image while
tissue appears dark? How can a CT scan or an MRI image show

a cross-sectional view of a living person without touching that
person? If X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, why
donât opaque materials absorb them? Why does a CT scan
show primarily bone, while an MRI image shows primarily tissue? The subatomic particles used in radiation therapy often
have enormous energies. From where do these energies come?
Experiments to Do: One triumph of medical imaging is its
ability to locate objects inside a person without actually entering the body. This is often done using X-rays to look through
the person from several different angles. From each vantage
point, the imaging machine determines which objects are to
the left or right of one another, but it canât tell how far away
those objects are. Nonetheless, by piecing together information from many different observations, the imaging machine
can locate each object exactly.
You can experiment with this process by sprinkling a number of coins onto the surface of a small table, without looking
to see where they come to rest. Close your eyes, and bring your
head to the height of the tableâs surface. Open only one eye,
and take a brief look at the coins. If the lighting is bright and
uniform, and you donât move your head, youâll have trouble
telling how far the coins are from your eye. Although youâll
know something about where each coin is, you wonât know
enough to locate one exactly on the tableâs surface. Now move
your head to a new position around the table, and take a second brief look. Again, you wonât be able to tell how far away the
coins are, but youâll learn more about their relative positions.
How many such views will it take for you to learn exactly where
the coins are? How does the presence of many opaque coins
complicate the problem? Why does opening both eyes at once
make it much easier for you to locate the coins?

X-Rays
Since their discovery in 1895, X-rays have played an important role in medical treatment.
Their usefulness was obvious from the very evening they were discovered. It was November 8, and German physicist Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen (1845â1923) was experimenting
with an electric discharge in a vacuum tube. He had covered the entire tube in black cardboard and was working in a darkened room. Some distance from the tube, a phosphored
screen began to glow. Some kind of radiation was being released by the tube, passing
through the cardboard and the air, and causing the screen to fluoresce. Roentgen put various objects in the way of the radiation, but they didnât block the flow. Finally, he put his
hand in front of the screen and saw a shadowed image of his bones. He had discovered
X-rays and their most famous application at the same time.
The first clinical use of X-rays was on January 13, 1896, when two British doctors
used them to find a needle in a womanâs hand. In no time, X-ray systems became common
in hospitals as a marvelous new technique for diagnosis. However, this imaging capability
was not without its side effects. Although the exposure itself was painless, overexposure to
X-rays caused deep burns and wounds that took some time to appear. Evidently the X-rays
were doing something much more subtle to the tissue than simply heating it.

Medical Imaging and Radiation

X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, as are radio waves, microwaves, and
light. These different forms of electromagnetic radiation are distinguished from one another
by their frequencies and wavelengthsâwhile radio waves have low frequencies and long
wavelengths, X-rays have extremely high frequencies and short wavelengths. Theyâre also
distinguished by their photon energies. Because of its low frequency, a radio wave photon
carries little energy. A medium-frequency photon of blue or ultraviolet light carries enough
energy to rearrange one bond in a molecule. But a high-frequency X-ray photon carries so
much energy that it can break many bonds and rip molecules apart.
In a microwave oven, the microwave photons work together to heat and cook food. The
amount of energy in each microwave photon is unimportant because they donât act alone.
In radiation therapy, however, the X-ray photons are independent. Each one carries enough
energy to damage any molecule that absorbs it. Thatâs why X-ray burns involve little heat
and appear long after the exposureâthe molecular damage caused by X-rays takes time to
kill cells.
Check Your Understanding #1: Forms of Radiation
Which is more closely related to X-rays: the beam of electrons traveling through a microwave ovenâs
magnetron tube or the infrared light from the hot filament of a toaster?
Answer: The infrared light from the hot filament is more closely related to X-rays.
Why: Infrared light and X-rays are both forms of electromagnetic radiation. All that distinguishes
them is their frequencies and wavelengths, and the energy of their photons. The beam of electrons
in a magnetron tube is also a form of radiation, but it involves particles of matter, not electromagnetic waves.

Making X-Rays
Medical X-ray sources work by crashing fast-moving electrons into heavy atoms. These
collisions create X-rays via two different physical mechanisms: bremsstrahlung and X-ray
fluorescence.
Bremsstrahlung occurs whenever a charged particle accelerates. This process is nothing really new, since we know that radio waves are emitted when a charged particle accelerates on an antenna. In a radio antenna, however, the electrons accelerate slowly and emit
low-energy photons. Bremsstrahlung usually refers to cases in which a charged particle
accelerates extremely rapidly and emits a very high-energy photon. In X-ray tube
bremsstrahlung, a fast-moving electron arcs around a massive nucleus and accelerates so
abruptly that it emits an X-ray photon (Fig. 15.3.1). This photon carries away a substantial
fraction of the electronâs kinetic energy. The closer the electron comes to the nucleus, the
more it accelerates and the more energy it gives to the X-ray photon. However, the electron
is more likely to miss the nucleus by a large distance than to almost hit it, so bremsstrahlung
is more likely to produce a lower-energy X-ray photon than a higher-energy one.
In X-ray fluorescence, the fast-moving electron collides with an inner electron in a
heavy atom and knocks that electron completely out of the atom (Fig. 15.3.2). The collision
leaves the atom as a positive ion, with a vacant orbital close to its nucleus. An electron in
that ion then undergoes a radiative transition, shifting from an outer orbital to this empty
inner one and releasing an enormous amount of energy in the process. This energy emerges
from the atom as an X-ray photon. Because this photon has an energy thatâs determined by
the ionâs orbital structure, itâs called a characteristic X-ray.
To discuss the energies carried by X-ray photons, weâll use the energy unit we encountered in Section 13.3âthe electron volt (eV). Photons of visible light carry energies of
between 1.6 eV (red light) and 3.0 eV (violet light). Because the ultraviolet photons in
sunlight have energies of up to 7 eV, they are able to break chemical bonds and cause sunburns. X-ray photons have much larger energies than even ultraviolet photons.

transition that creates a

In a typical medical X-ray tube, electrons are emitted by a hot cathode and accelerate
through vacuum toward a positively charged metal anode (Fig. 15.3.3). The anode is a
tungsten or molybdenum disk, spinning rapidly to keep it from melting. The energy of the
electrons as they hit the anode is determined by the voltage difference across the tube. In a
medical X-ray machine, that voltage difference is typically about 87,000 V, so each electron has about 87,000 eV of energy. Since an electron gives a good fraction of its energy to
the X-ray photon it produces, the photons leaving the tube can carry up to 87,000 eV of
energy. No wonder X-rays can damage tissue!
When the electrons collide with a target of heavy atoms, they emit both bremsstrahlung
and characteristic X-rays (Fig. 15.3.4). The characteristic X-rays have specific energies, so
they appear as peaks in the overall X-ray spectrum. The bremsstrahlung X-rays have different energies but are most intense at lower energies. Because lower-energy X-ray photons
injure skin and arenât useful for imaging or radiation therapy, medical X-ray machines use
absorbing materials, such as aluminum, to filter them out.
Check Your Understanding #2: The Origins of Synchrotron Radiation
The giant particle accelerators used in high-energy physics are often built as rings so that they can
use the same electrically charged particles over and over again. As these particles travel in circles
around the rings, they emit X-rays. Explain.
Answer: Because a particle traveling in a circle is accelerating, it emits electromagnetic waves. In
this case, those waves are X-rays.
Why: A rapidly accelerating charged particle will emit an X-ray, whether itâs accelerating around the
nucleus of a heavy atom or around the ring of a particle accelerator. In an accelerator, these X-rays
are called synchrotron radiation. Synchrotron radiation is useful in research and industry and is often
deliberately enhanced by adding special magnets to the ring of the accelerator.

Using X-Rays for Imaging

451

Outgoing
X-ray photon

X-rays have two important uses in medicine: imaging and radiation therapy. In
Incoming
X-ray imaging, X-rays are sent through a patientâs body to a sheet of film or
X-ray
photon
an X-ray detector. Some of the X-rays manage to pass through tissue, but most
of them are blocked by bone. The patientâs bones form shadow images on the
film behind them. In X-ray radiation therapy, the X-rays are again sent through
a patientâs body, but now their lethal interaction with diseased tissue is whatâs
important.
Atom
X-ray photons interact with tissue and bone through four major processes:
Fig. 15.3.5 When an
elastic scattering, the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, and electronpositron pair production. Elastic scattering is already familiar to us as the cause of X-ray photon scatters
elastically from an atom,
the blue sky; an atom acts as an antenna for the passing electromagnetic wave, absorb- the whole atom acts as
ing and reemitting it without keeping any of its energy (Fig. 15.3.5). Because this an antenna. The passing
process has almost no effect on the atom, elastic scattering isnât important in radiation photon jiggles all the

photon and reemit it in a

machines use filters to block X-rays that donât approach the film from the direction of
the X-ray source.
The photoelectric effect is what makes X-ray imaging possible. In this effect, a passing photon induces a radiative transition in an atom; one of the atomâs electrons absorbs the
photon and is tossed completely out of the atom (Fig. 15.3.6). If the atom were using the
X-ray photon to shift an electron from one orbital to another, that photon would have to
have just the right amount of energy. However, because a free electron can have any amount
of energy, the atom can absorb any X-ray photon that has enough energy to eject one of its
electrons. Part of the photonâs energy is used to remove the electron from the atom, and the
rest is given to the emitted electron as kinetic energy.
The likelihood of such a photoemission event decreases as the ejected electronâs energy
increases. This decreasing likelihood makes it difficult for a small atom to absorb an X-ray
photon. All its electrons are relatively weakly bound, and the X-ray photon would give the
ejected electron a large kinetic energy. Rather than emitting a high-energy electron, a small
atom usually just ignores the passing X-ray photon.
In contrast, some of the electrons in a large atom are quite tightly bound and require
most of the X-ray photonâs energy to remove them. These electrons would depart with
relatively little kinetic energy. Because the photoemission process is most likely

bone (calcium and phosphorus) absorb X-rays frequently. Thatâs why bones
cast clear shadows onto X-ray film. Tissue shadows are also visible, but theyâre
less obvious.
Although one shadow image of a patientâs insides may help to diagnose a
broken bone, more subtle problems may not be visible in a single X-ray image. For

Why: Like the small atoms in biological tissue, aluminum atoms rarely use the photoelectric effect
to absorb high-energy X-rays. This result makes it possible to use thin films of aluminum as windows
and filters for X-ray sources.

Using X-Rays for Therapy
Radiation therapy also uses X-rays, but not the ones used for medical imaging. Even
though tissue absorbs fewer imaging photons than bone, most imaging photons are
absorbed before they can pass through thick tissue. For example, only about 10% of the
imaging photons make it through a patientâs leg even when they miss the bone. That percentage is good enough for making an image, but it wouldnât do for radiation therapy
because most imaging X-rays would be absorbed long before they reached a deep-seated
tumor. Instead of killing the tumor, intense exposure to these X-rays would kill tissue near
the patientâs skin.

Medical Imaging and Radiation

To attack malignant tissue deep beneath the skin, radiation therapy uses
Incoming
extremely high-energy photons. At photon energies near 1,000,000 eV, the
X-ray photon
photoelectric effect becomes rare in tissue and bone, and the photons are much
more likely to reach the tumor. Photons still deposit lethal energy in the tissue
and tumor, but they do this through a new effectâCompton scattering.
Compton scattering occurs when an X-ray photon collides with a single
electron so that the two particles bounce off one another (Fig. 15.3.9). The
X-ray photon knocks the electron right out of the atom. This process is different from the photoelectric effect because Compton scattering doesnât involve
the atom as a whole and the photon is scattered (bounced) rather than absorbed.
The physics behind this effect resembles that of two billiard balls colliding,
although itâs complicated by the theory of relativity. The fact that it occurs at all is proof
that a photon carries both energy and momentum and that these quantities are conserved
when a particle of light collides with a particle of matter.
Compton scattering is crucial to radiation therapy. When a patient is exposed to
1,000,000-eV photons, most of the photons pass right through, but a small fraction undergo
Compton scattering and leave some of their energy behind. This energy kills cells and can
be used to destroy a tumor. By approaching a tumor from many different angles through the
patientâs body, the treatment can minimize the injury to healthy tissue around the tumor
while giving the tumor itself a fatal dose of radiation.
Compton scattering isnât the only effect that occurs when high-energy photons encounter matter. X-rays with slightly more than 1,022,000 eV can do something remarkable
when they pass through an atom; they can cause electron-positron pair production. A
positron is the antimatter equivalent of an electron. Our universe is symmetrical in many
ways, and one of its nearly perfect symmetries is the existence of antimatter. Almost every
particle in nature has an antiparticle with the same mass but opposite characteristics. A
positron, or antielectron, has the same mass as an electron, but itâs positively charged.
There are also antiprotons and antineutrons.
Antimatter doesnât occur naturally on Earth, but it can be created in high-energy collisions. When an energetic photon collides with the electric field of an atom, the photon can
become an electron and a positron. In the previous section, we discussed matter becoming
energy; pair production is an example of energy becoming matter. It takes about 511,000 eV
of energy to form an electron or a positron, so the photon must have at least 1,022,000 eV
to create one of each. Any extra energy goes into kinetic energy in the two particles.
The positron doesnât last long in a patient. It soon collides with an electron and the two
annihilate one anotherâthe electron and positron disappear, and their mass becomes
energy. They turn into photons with a total of at least 1,022,000 eV. Thus energy became
matter briefly and then turned back into energy. This exotic process is present in highenergy radiation therapy and becomes quite significant at photon energies above about
10,000,000 eV. Not surprisingly, it also helps to kill tumors.

About how much energy would a photon need to create a proton-antiproton pair?
Answer: It would need about 2,000,000,000 eV.
Why: A proton has about 2000 times the mass of an electron, so producing a proton-antiproton pair
should take about 2000 times the 1,000,000-eV energy required to produce an electron-positron pair.

Gamma Rays
Producing very high-energy photons isnât quite as easy as producing those used in X-ray
imaging. In principle, a power supply could create a huge voltage difference through an
X-ray tube so that very high-energy electrons would crash into metal atoms and produce

very high-energy photons. However, million-volt power supplies are complicated and dangerous, so other schemes are used instead.
One of the easiest ways to obtain very high-energy photons is through the decay of
radioactive isotopes. The isotope most commonly used in radiation therapy is cobalt
60 (60Co). The nucleus of 60Co has too many neutrons and, like many neutron-rich nuclei,
60
Co undergoes beta decay; that is, one of its neutrons breaks up into a proton, an electron,
and a neutrino (or more precisely, an antineutrino). Beginning with that beta decay, 60Co
undergoes a series of transformations that produce two high-energy photons: one with
1,170,000 eV and one with 1,330,000 eV. These photons penetrate tissue well and are quite
effective at killing tumors.
Although the process by which 60Co produces those two high-energy photons is complicated, beta decay itself shows that protons, electrons, and neutrons are not immutable
and that there are other subatomic particles in our universe. Neutrons that are by themselves or in nuclei with too many neutrons are radioactive and experience beta decay. When
that beta decay process occurs in a 60Co nucleus, the negatively charged electron and neutral neutrino quickly escape from the nucleus but the newly formed proton remains. The
nucleus thus becomes nickel 60 (60Ni).
The neutrino is a subatomic particle with no charge and little mass. Neutrinos
arenât found in normal atoms. Although important in nuclear and particle physics, neutrinos are difficult to observe directly because they travel near the speed of light and
hardly ever collide with anything. Without charge, they donât participate in electromagnetic forces and, unlike the electrically neutral neutron, they donât experience the
nuclear force. They experience only gravity and the weak force, the last of the four
fundamental forces known to exist in our universe. (The other three fundamental forces
are the gravitational force; the electromagnetic force; and the strong force, which is a
more complete version of the nuclear force that we discussed in Section 15.1.) Because
itâs weak and occurs only between particles that are very close together, the weak force
rarely makes itself apparent. One of the few occasions on which it plays an important
role is in beta decay.
With almost no way to push or pull on another particle, a neutrino can easily pass right
through the entire Earth. Neutrinos are detected occasionally, but only with the help of
enormous detectors. Thatâs why physicists first showed that neutrinos are emitted from
decaying neutrons by measuring energy and momentum before and after the decay. The
proton and electron produced by the decay donât have the same total energy and momentum as the neutron had before the decay. Something must have carried away the missing
energy and momentum, and that something is the neutrino.
Once 60Co has turned into 60Ni, the decay isnât quite over. The 60Ni nucleus that forms
still has extra energy in it. Nuclei are complicated quantum physical systems, just as atoms
are, and they have excited states, too. The 60Ni nucleus is in an excited state, and it must
undergo two radiative transitions before it reaches the ground state. These radiative transitions produce very high-energy photons or gamma rays that are characteristic of the 60Ni
nucleus: one with 1,170,000 eV of energy and the other with 1,330,000 eV. The gamma
rays are what make 60Co radiation therapy possible.

If someone offered to sell you a bottle of neutrinos, youâd be foolish to buy it. Whatâs wrong with the
idea of a bottle of neutrinos?
Answer: The bottle couldnât confine neutrinos because it barely interacts with them.
Why: Because neutrinos experience only gravity and the weak force, the bottle couldnât trap them for
long. Actually, youâre being bathed in neutrinos from the sun all the time without even noticing it.
Theyâre as common as dirt and you canât do anything with them anyway.

Medical Imaging and Radiation

Particle Accelerators
Electromagnetic radiation isnât the only form of radiation used to treat patients. Energetic
particles such as electrons and protons are also used. Like tiny billiard balls, these fastmoving particles collide with the atoms inside tumors and knock them apart. As usual, this
atomic and molecular damage tends to kill cells and destroy tumors.
However, obtaining extremely energetic subatomic particles isnât easy. High-voltage
power supplies can be used to accelerate an electron or proton to about 500,000 eV, but that
isnât enough. When a charged particle enters tissue, it experiences strong electric forces
and is easily deflected from its path. To make sure that it travels straight and true, all the
way to a tumor, the particle must have an enormous energy. Giving each charged particle
the millions or even billions of electron volts it needs for radiation therapy takes a particle
accelerator.
Particle accelerators use resonant cavities, the microwave-frequency tank circuits we
encountered in Section 12.2. Each of these metal chambers acts simultaneously as a capacitor and an inductor and thus has a natural resonance for sloshing charge. In the resonant
cavities of a particle accelerator, this sloshing charge creates huge electric fields that change
with time. Those electric fields push charged particles through space until they reach
incredible energies.
One important type of particle accelerator is the linear accelerator. In this device,
the electric fields in a series of resonant cavities push charged particles forward in a
straight line (Fig. 15.3.10). Each of these cavities has charge sloshing back and forth
rhythmically on its wall. When a small packet of charged particles enters the first cavity
through a hole, itâs suddenly pushed forward by the strong electric field inside that cavity
(Fig. 15.3.10a). The packet accelerates forward and leaves the first resonant cavity with
more kinetic energy than it had when it arrivedâthe electric field in that cavity has done
work on the packet.
If the fields in the cavities were constant, the electric field in the second cavity would
slow the packet down. In Fig. 15.3.10a, you can see that the electric field in the second
cavity points in the wrong direction. By the time the packet reaches the second cavity, the
charge sloshing in its walls has reversed and so has the electric field (Fig. 15.3.10b). The
packet is again pushed forward, and it emerges from the second cavity with still more
kinetic energy.

Fig. 15.3.11 This
radiation therapy unit uses
a linear accelerator to
produce extremely highenergy subatomic particles.
These particles penetrate
deep inside the patient to
destroy a cancerous tumor.
The linear accelerator
itself is hidden from view
in the room behind this
one. Its beam is steered by
magnets in the rotatable
arm toward a particular
spot in the patient. The
arm moves periodically
during treatment so
that its beam intersects
the tumor from many
different directions and
causes less damage to
healthy tissue nearby. That
multidirectional strategy is
also widely used in X-ray
and gamma-ray therapies.

Each resonant cavity in this series adds energy to the packet, so that a long string of
cavities can give each of the packetâs charged particles millions or even billions of electron
volts. This energy comes from microwave generators that cause charge to slosh in the
acceleratorâs resonant cavities. The linear accelerator then has only to inject charged particles into the first cavity, using equipment resembling the insides of a television picture
tube, and those charged particles will come flying out of the last cavity with incredible
energies (Fig. 15.3.11).
This acceleration technique, however, has a few complications. Most important, each
cavity must reverse its electric field at just the right moment to keep the packet accelerating
forward. For simplicity of operation, all the cavities have the same resonant frequency and
reverse their electric fields simultaneously. Since the packet spends the same amount of
time in each cavity and since it speeds up as it goes from one cavity to the next, each cavity
must be longer than the previous one.
As the packet approaches the speed of light, something strange happens. The packetâs
energy continues to increase as it goes through the cavities, but its speed stops increasing very
much. This effect is a consequence of special relativity, the rules governing motion at speeds
comparable to the speed of light. As we saw in Section 4.2, the simple relationship between
kinetic energy and speed given in Eq. 2.2.1 isnât valid for objects moving at almost the speed
of light; we must use Eq. 4.2.4 instead. As a further consequence of relativity, the packet can
approach the speed of light but canât actually reach it. Although each charged particleâs
kinetic energy can become extraordinarily large, its speed is limited by the speed of light.
Because the packetâs speed stops increasing significantly after it has gone through the
first few cavities of the linear accelerator, the lengths of the remaining cavities can be constant. Only the first few cavities have to be specially designed to account for the packetâs
increasing speed inside them. The charged particles emerge from the accelerator traveling
at almost the speed of light. They pass through a thin metal window that keeps air out of the
accelerator and enter the patientâs body. They have so much energy that they can penetrate
deep into tissue before coming to a stop.
Check Your Understanding #6: Particle Recycling
Many research accelerators send each packet of electrons through the same series of resonant cavities several times. After the packet leaves the last cavity, magnets steer it around in a circle and send
it back through the cavities again. With each pass through the cavities, the packet acquires more
energy, so how can it possibly stay synchronized with the reversing electric fields in the cavities?
Answer: The packet is traveling at almost the speed of light, so its speed barely changes as its energy
increases.
Why: If the packet were speeding up with each trip through the cavities, it wouldnât stay synchronized
with the reversing electric fields inside them. However, the packetâs speed is so nearly constant once it
nears the speed of light that it can travel through the cavities over and over again without any problem.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Although X-rays do an excellent job of imaging bones, they arenât as good for imaging
tissue. A better technique for studying tissue is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This
technique locates hydrogen atoms by interacting with their magnetic nuclei. Since hydrogen atoms are common in both water and organic molecules, finding hydrogen atoms is a
good way to study biological tissue.
The nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom, 1H, is a proton. Protons, like electrons,
have two possible internal quantum states, usually called spin-up and spin-down. Calling it
spin is appropriate because spin-up and spin-down protons have equal but oppositely
directed angular momentum. When electric charge and rotation are both present, itâs not
surprising that magnetism is, too; electric currents are magnetic, after all. Sure enough,
protons have magnetic dipolesâequal north and south poles at a distance from one another.

Medical Imaging and Radiation

A spin-up proton acts as though it has its north pole on top, while a spin-down proton acts
as though it has its south pole on top.
When a proton is immersed in a magnetic field, it tends to align its magnetic dipole
with that field. Doing so minimizes its magnetic potential energy. But although protons
would align perfectly with the field at absolute zero, they are less successful near room
temperature. Thermal energy agitates the protons so that, even in a strong, upward-pointing
magnetic field, spin-up protons only slightly outnumber spin-down protons.
In that upward-pointing magnetic field, each proton has two possible quantum states:
alignment with the field (spin-up) or anti-alignment (spin-down). Because alignment
reduces the protonâs magnetic potential energy, itâs the ground stateâthe lower energy of
the two possible states. The anti-aligned state is the excited state.
With its two possible states, ground and excited, a proton in a magnetic field can
exhibit many of the behaviors we explored when looking at atoms in Section 13.2. Most
important, the proton can experience radiative transitions between its two states. A groundstate proton can absorb a photon while making a radiative transition to its excited state, and
an excited-state proton can emit a photon while transiting to its ground state.
In Section 13.2, we saw that a given atom can absorb or emit only certain photons,
photons carrying exactly the right amount of energy to shift the atom from one quantum
state to another. For example, neon signs are red because neon atoms have states that are
separated in energy by the energy of red photons. Similarly, a proton in a magnetic field can
absorb or emit only certain photons, photons carrying exactly the right amount of energy to
shift the proton from one quantum state to the other.
However, unlike a neon atom, which always interacts with red photons, a proton in a
magnetic field interacts with photons that vary in âcolorâ according to the strength of the
magnetic field. Thatâs because the energy separating the protonâs two states is proportional
to the magnetic field in which it resides. As a result, the photon energy needed to cause
radiative transitions between the protonâs two states is also proportional to the magnetic
field. If the field changes, so does the photon energy.
When a patient enters the strong magnetic field of an MRI machine (Figs. 15.3.12 and
15.3.13), the protons in the patientâs body respond to the field and a small excess of aligned
protons develops. Only these excess aligned protons matter to the MRI machine because effects
due to the remaining protons, which are equally aligned and anti-aligned, cancel completely.
The excess aligned protons are in their ground state, and they are what the MRI machine studies.
The MRI machine interacts with these ground-state protons using radio wave photons,
photons with energies equal to the energy difference between their ground and excited
states. The protons can absorb and subsequently emit those radio wave photons, and they
can also exhibit a variety of fascinating and useful quantum interference effects.

interactions between electromagnetic waves and protons that take place in magnetic fields, MRI

CHAPT ER 15 Modern Physics

If the protons in the patientâs body were all experiencing exactly the same magnetic
field, they would all interact with the same radio wave photonsâbut the protons donât all
experience the same field. The MRI machine introduces a slight spatial variation to its
magnetic field. Because the magnetic field is different for different protons, only some of
them can interact with radio wave photons of a particular energy. This selective interaction
is how the MRI imager locates protons within a patient.
In its simplest form, an MRI machine applies a spatially varying magnetic field to the
patientâs body. It then sends various radio waves through the patient and looks for the radio
wave photons to interact with protons. Since only a proton that is experiencing the right
magnetic field can interact with a particular radio wave photon, the MRI machine can
determine where each proton is by the photons with which it interacts. By changing the
spatial variations in the magnetic field and adjusting the energies of the radio wave photons, the MRI machine gradually locates the protons in the patientâs body. It builds a
detailed three-dimensional map of the hydrogen atoms. A computer manages this map and
can display cross-sectional images of the patient from any angle or position.
Check Your Understanding #7: Major Magnets
Some of the most modern MRI machines use extremely strong magnetic fields. As a machineâs magnetic field gets stronger, what must happen to the radio waves that are used to interact with protons
in a patient?
Answer: Each radio wave photon must carry more energy (the radio waves must have higher frequencies).
Why: The stronger the magnetic field in which a proton is immersed, the more energy separates the
protonâs two states. The MRI machine must use higher-frequency, more energetic radio waves to
cause radiative transitions between those two states. There are many advantages to using extremely
strong magnetic fields, including lower noise and better spatial resolution in the image. However, the
magnetic fields of these advanced MRI machines are so strong that they can erase credit cards from
across the room and rip steel objects right out of your pockets.

Epilogue for Chapter 15
In this chapter we examined some of the applications of modern physics. In Nuclear
Weapons, we examined nuclear fission to see how nuclear chain reactions can be used to
release electrostatic potential energy stored in the large nuclei of uranium and plutonium
atoms. We also studied nuclear fusion and found that when small nuclei of hydrogen bind
together, they release a potential energy associated with the nuclear force. We learned
about radioactive isotopes and fallout.
In Nuclear Reactors, we studied the techniques used to harness nuclear energy for less
destructive purposes. We saw that natural or slightly enriched uranium can support a chain
reaction if the fission neutrons are slowed in a moderator. We reviewed reactor and safety
issues and looked at the worldâs most significant nuclear accidents.
In Medical Imaging and Radiation, we learned how X-rays are produced and why
those X-rays pass more easily through tissue than through bone. We saw how X-rays can
be used to make images and explored the uses of gamma rays for radiation therapy. We
looked at particle accelerators and concluded by examining magnetic resonance imaging.

Explanation: Radiation-Damaged Paper
The paper fades because the ultraviolet light photons in sunlight have enough energy to
shift electrons out of the orbitals that bond the dye molecules together. These dye molecules
then fall apart and leave the paper without color. In some cases, the photons of light completely remove the electrons from the dye molecules. The process is the same photoelectric
effect that makes it possible to distinguish tissue from bone in X-ray imaging.

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations

Chapter Summary and Important Laws and Equations
How Nuclear Weapons Work: A fission bomb releases nuclear energy through a chain reaction in the fissionable isotopes of uranium or plutonium. In a chain reaction, each fission
induces, on average, at least one subsequent fission. Assembling a supercritical mass must
be done rapidly so that the bomb doesnât blow itself apart before most of the nuclei have
undergone fission.
A fusion bomb uses heat from a fission bomb to initiate fusion in the heavy isotopes of
hydrogen: deuterium and tritium. Because tritium has a short half-life, it must be replaced
frequently. In some fusion bombs, the tritium is created during the explosion by neutron
collisions with lithium.
How Nuclear Reactors Work: A thermal fission reactor can sustain a controlled chain reaction in natural or slightly enriched uranium. By slowing its fission neutrons to thermal velocities in a moderator, the reactor is able to make those neutrons interact almost exclusively
with the rare 235U nuclei and leave the more common 238U nuclei almost unaffected. The
235
U nuclei fission in a chain reaction and release heat that is used to power electric generators. The presence of some delayed fission neutrons makes it easy to control the chain reaction using neutron-absorbing control rods.
To use the 238U nuclei, a fast fission or breeder reaction uses more highly enriched uranium and no moderator. Although the chain reaction initially proceeds primarily among the
235
U nuclei, the fast fission neutrons gradually transform the 238U nuclei into 239Pu nuclei.
Like 235U nuclei, those 239Pu nuclei are fissionable and can participate in the chain reaction,
so the fast fission reaction can ultimately extract energy from all the original uranium nuclei.
239
Pu is also chemically separable from uranium and can be used to manufacture nuclear
weapons. Fast fission reactors therefore pose the danger of nuclear proliferation.
Although the goal of obtaining energy from the fusion of hydrogen nuclei on Earth remains elusive, gradual progress is being made. The main challenge is to contain and heat the
hydrogen nuclei to the enormous temperatures needed to make them collide and fuse.
How Medical Imaging and Radiation Work: Because X-rays pass more easily through tissue
than they do through bone, X-rays form shadow images of a patientâs bones. These X-rays are
produced when energetic electrons accelerate near metal nuclei and when they knock other
electrons out of the metal atoms.
Radiation therapy is done with very high-energy X-rays and gamma rays because they
pass more easily through tissue. These electromagnetic waves kill tumor cells by depositing
energy in the atoms and molecules of those cells. Gamma rays are usually obtained from
radioactive nuclei. Some radiation therapy is done with energetic particles that are given
enormous energies by particle accelerators.
Magnetic resonance imaging uses the magnetic nature of hydrogen nuclei (protons) to
locate hydrogen atoms in a patientâs body. The patient is put in a strong magnetic field, and
the protons tend to align with this field. The imaging machine then uses radio waves to reverse the alignments of those protons. By making the magnetic field vary slightly from place
to place, the machine is able to locate the protons in the patientâs body. A computer records
and analyzes the results so that it can present cross-sectional images of the hydrogen atoms
in a patientâs body.

Vectors
Some physical quantities are simply numbers (e.g., 0, â1.5, and đ)
or numbers with units (e.g., 10 s, 5 kg, and 1 m3). These are
known as scalar quantities, that is, quantities that have only
magnitudes (amounts). Many other physical quantities, however, are vectorsâthey have both magnitudes and directions.
In our three-dimensional world, vector quantities are quite
common and useful, and they include position, velocity, acceleration, force, torque, momentum, and angular momentum.
Because vector quantities include both magnitude and direction,
they convey more information than scalar quantities and theyâre
also a bit more difficult to understand.
Position is probably the easiest vector quantity to visualize:
you specify an objectâs position by giving its position vectorâ
its distance and direction from a reference point. For example,
you can specify the libraryâs position with respect to your home
by giving both its distance from your home (say 3.162 km, or
1.965 miles) and its direction from your home (18.43Â° east of
due north). That position vector is all the information someone
would need to travel from your home to the library.
In illustrations, such as Fig. A.1, vector quantities are
drawn as arrows. The length of each arrow indicates the vectorâs
magnitude, while the direction of the arrow indicates which way
the vector points. Suppose that you live in a city with major
east-west and north-south streets spaced 1 km apart. Figure A.1
shows four aerial views of your city. The vector A in Fig. A.1a
shows the position of the library with respect to your home. It
begins at your home and ends at the library, thus indicating both
the magnitude and direction of the libraryâs position.
Letâs look at another position vector. The vector B in Fig.
A.1b begins at the library and ends at your friendâs home. This
position vector shows the position of your friendâs home with
respect to the library and is 2.828 km long and points 45Â° east of
south. If you happen to be at the library, you can use this vector
to find your friendâs home.
But how can you go from your home to your friendâs
home? To make this trip, you must add two vectors: you first
follow vector A from your home to the library and then follow
vector B from the library to your friendâs home. This combined
trip is shown as the upper path in Fig. A.1c. But you could also
go directly from your home to your friendâs home by following
a new vector in Fig. A.1câvector C. This vector from your home
to your friendâs home is the sum of vectors A and B, and is 3.162
km long and points 18.43Â° north of east. Using bold letters to
indicate that A, B, and C are vectors, we can write A + B = C,
meaning that vector C is the sum of vectors A and B.
Another interesting path from your home to your friendâs
home is shown in Fig. A.1d; you first travel along vector B
460

and then along vector A. On this path, you will arrive at your
friendâs home without visiting the library. The first leg of this
journey will take you into new territory, but the second leg will
leave you at your friendâs home. The sum of vectors B and A is
still vector C, or B + A = C. Thus vectors added in any order
yield the same sum.
While you can estimate the sum of two vectors by drawing
arrows on a sheet of paper, obtaining an accurate sum requires
some thought. Adding their magnitudes is unlikely to give you
the magnitude of the sum vector, and adding their directions
doesnât even make sense. To add two vectors, it helps to specify
them in another form: as their components along two or three
directions that are at right angles with respect to one another. In
our example of travel in a city, two right-angle directions are all

2.828 km in the direction 45Â° east of south, which is vector B.
(c) You can go from your home to your friendâs home by two
routes: you can go first to the library along vector A and then go
to your friendâs home along vector B, or you can travel directly
along vector C, which is the sum of vectors A and B. (d) You can
also reach your friendâs home by going first along vector B and
then along vector A. The sum of these two vectors is still vector
C. However, you will not visit the library on that trip.

we need. If height were also important, weâd need three right-angle directions.
For the two right-angle directions we need in the city,
letâs choose east and north. We can then specify vector A as its
component toward the east and its component toward the north.
Its east component is 1 km and its north component is 3 km, so
vector A, the position of the library with respect to your home,
is 1 km to the east and 3 km to the north.
This new form for vector A, a pair of distances, is often
more convenient than the old form, a distance and a direction.
If you go to the library by walking 3.162 km in the direction
18.43Â° east of north, youâll have to pass through a lot of other
buildings and backyards. Walking to the library by heading 1 km
east and 3 km north allows you to travel on the sidewalks.
If we designate the position of your home as 0 km east and
0 km north, then the position of the library is 1 km east and 3 km
north. These positions are labeled in Fig. A.1a as (0,0) and (1,3),
respectively. The first number in the parentheses is the distance
east, measured in kilometers, and the second number is the
distance north, also in kilometers.
To go from the library to your friendâs home, you must
go 2 km east and 2 km south. Thatâs the new form of vector B.
Because a southward position has a negative component along

461

the northward direction, the position of your friendâs home with
respect to the library is 2 km east and â2 km north. In Fig. A.1b,
the library is at (0,0) and your friendâs home is at (2,â2).
Now adding these vectors A and B is relatively easy. To
go from your home to your friendâs home by way of the library,
you must move east first 1 km and then 2 km for a total of 3 km,
and you must move north 3 km and then â2 km for a total of
1 km. Thus the position of your friendâs home with respect to
your home, vector C, is 3 km east and 1 km north. In Fig. A.1c,
your home is at (0,0) and your friendâs home is at (3,1).
Similarly, you can go from your home to your friendâs
home by following first vector B and then vector A, as shown in
Fig. A.1d. This trip will take you through unknown regions, but
youâll still arrive at the right place. You move east first 2 km and
then 1 km, and you move north first â2 km and then 3 km. In
the end, youâll be 3 km east and 1 km north of your home, the
position of your friendâs home. Thus the sum of vectors B and
A is still vector C.
As you can see, vectors are useful for specifying physical
quantities in our three-dimensional world. When you encounter
vectors, remember that their directions are just as important as
their magnitudes and that these directions must be taken into
account when you add two vectors together.

Appendix B

Units, Conversion of Units
When you return from a camping trip and begin to describe it to
your friends, there are a number of physical quantities that you
may find useful in your conversation. Distance, weight, temperature, and time are as important in everyday life as they are in
a laboratory. And when you explain to your friends how far you
hiked, how much your backpack weighed, how cold the weather
was, and how long the trip took, youâll have to relate those quantities to standard units or your friends wonât appreciate just how
difficult the trip was.
Most physical quantities arenât simple numbers like 7 or
2.9. Instead, they have units like length or time, and are specified
in multiples of widely accepted standard units such as meters or
seconds. When you say a door is 3.0 meters tall, youâre comparing
the doorâs height to the meter, a widely accepted standard unit
of length. With this comparison, most people can determine just
how tall the door is, even though theyâve never seen it.
But the meter isnât familiar to everyone; many people prefer
to measure length in multiples of another standard unitâthe
foot. These people might be more comfortable hearing that
the door is 9.8 feet tall. These two quantities, 3.0 meters and
9.8 feet, are the same length.
Determining the doorâs height in feet doesnât require a new
measurement because we can convert the one in meters to one
thatâs in feet. To perform this conversion, we need to know how
to express one particular length in both units. Any length will
do. For example, Table B.1 states that 1 foot is the same length
as 0.30480 meters. Because of that equality, we know that the
following equation is true:
1 foot
= 1.
0.30480 maters

462

We can multiply 3.0 meters, the height of the door, by this
version of 1 and obtain the doorâs height in feet:
3.0 meters Âˇ

1 foot
= 9.8425 feet.
0.30480 meters

Notice that the original units (meters) cancel and are replaced
by the new units (feet). Since we knew the doorâs height only to
2 digits of precision in meters, we canât report the doorâs height
to any more than 2 digits of precision in feet. So, we round the
result to 9.8 feet.
You can change the units of almost any physical quantity
by multiplying that quantity by a version of 1. You should form
this 1 by dividing new units by old units, where the number of
new units in the numerator is equivalent to the number of old
units in the denominator. You can obtain these pairs of equivalent quantities from Table B.1. When you do this multiplication,
the old units will cancel and youâll be left with the physical
quantity expressed in the new units.
One last note about units: When you use physical quantities
in a calculation, make sure that you keep the units throughout
the process. Theyâre as important in the calculation as they are
anywhere else. Some of the units may cancel, but in all likelihood the result of the calculation will have some units left, and
these units must be appropriate to the type of result you expect.
If youâre expecting a length, the units of your result should be
meters or feet or another standard unit of length. If the units you
obtain are seconds or kilograms, youâve made a mistake in the
calculation.

absolute temperature scale A scale for
measuring temperature in which 0 K
corresponds to absolute zero.
absolute zero The temperature at which
all thermal energy has been removed
from an object or system of objects.
Because itâs impossible to find and
remove all the thermal energy from
an object, absolute zero can be approached but is not actually attainable.
acceleration A vector quantity that measures the rate at which an objectâs
velocity is changing: the greater the
acceleration, the more the objectâs velocity changes each second. It consists
of both the amount of acceleration and
the direction in which the object is accelerating. This direction is identical
to the direction of the force causing
the acceleration. The SI unit of acceleration is the meter per second2.
acceleration due to gravity A physical
constant that specifies how quickly a
freely falling object accelerates and
also relates an objectâs weight to its
mass. At Earthâs surface, the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s2 (or
9.8 N/kg).
activation energy The energy required
to initiate a chemical reaction. This
energy serves to break or weaken
the bonds in the starting chemicals
so that the reaction can proceed to
form the reaction products.
adverse pressure gradient A region of
fluid flow in which the fluid must
flow toward higher pressure. The
fluidâs momentum and kinetic energy carry it through this situation,
although the fluid does slow down.
aerodynamic forces The forces exerted
on an object by the motion of the
air surrounding it. The two types of
aerodynamic forces are lift and drag.
aerodynamics The study of the dynamic
(moving) interactions of air with
objects.

airfoil An aerodynamically engineered
surface designed to obtain particular lift and drag forces from the air
flowing around it.
airspeed An objectâs speed relative to
the air through which it moves.
alpha decay A radioactive decay in
which a helium nucleus (two protons
and two neutrons) escapes from a
larger proton-rich nucleus via quantum tunneling.
alternating current (AC) An electric
current that periodically reverses its
direction of flow.
ampere (A) The SI unit of electric current (synonymous with the coulomb
per second). One ampere is defined as the passage of 6.25 Ă 1018
charged particles per second and is
roughly the current flowing through
a 100-W lightbulb operating on
household electric power.
ampere-meter (A â m) The SI unit of
magnetic pole.
amplifier A device that replicates an input signal as a larger output signal.

of an oscillator away from its equilibrium position.
amplitude modulation (AM) A technique for representing sound or data
by changing the amplitude (strength)
of a wave.
analog representation The representation of numbers directly as continuous values of physical quantities
such as voltage, charge, or pressure.
angle of attack The angle at which an
airfoil is tilted relative to the airflow
around it.
angular acceleration A vector quantity
that measures how quickly an objectâs angular velocity is changing;
the greater the angular acceleration,
the more the objectâs angular velocity changes each second. It consists

of both the amount of angular acceleration and the direction about which
the angular acceleration occurs. This
direction is identical to the direction
of the torque causing the angular acceleration. The SI unit of angular acceleration is the radian per second2.
angular impulse The mechanical means
for transferring angular momentum.
One object gives an angular impulse
to a second object by exerting a certain torque on the second object for
a certain amount of time. In return,
the second object gives an equal but
oppositely directed angular impulse
to the first object.
angular momentum A conserved vector
quantity that measures an objectâs rotational motion. It is that objectâs rotational mass times its angular velocity. The SI unit of angular momentum
is the kilogram-meter2 per second.
angular position A quantity that describes an objectâs orientation relative to some reference orientation.
angular speed A measure of the angle
through which an object rotates in a
certain amount of time.
angular velocity A vector quantity that
measures how rapidly an objectâs
angular position is changing; the
greater the angular velocity, the farther the object turns each second. It
consists of both the objectâs angular
speed and the direction about which
the object is rotating. This direction
points along the axis of rotation
in the direction established by the
right-hand rule. The SI unit of angular velocity is the radian per second.
anharmonic oscillator An oscillator
in which the restoring force on an
object is not proportional to its
displacement from a stable equilibrium. The period of an anharmonic
oscillator depends on the amplitude
of its motion.

antimatter Matter resembling normal
matter, but with many of its characteristics such as electric charge reversed.
aperture The diameter or effective
diameter of a lens or opening.
apparent weight The sum of a personâs
weight plus their feeling of acceleration. All three quantities are vectors, so apparent weight can be quite
large if the weight and feeling point
in the same direction or quite small
if they point in opposite directions.
Archimedesâ principle The observation
that an object partially or wholly
immersed in a fluid is acted on by an
upward buoyant force equal to the

element that retains the chemical
properties of that element.
atomic number The number of protons
present in an atomic nucleus and
equal to the number of electrons in
a neutral atom.
axis of rotation The straight line in
space about which an object or
group of objects rotates. More specifically, the axis of rotation points
in a particular direction along that
line to reflect the sense of rotation
according to the right-hand rule.
back emf The self-induced electromotive force that develops in an inductor when its current changes or
in the coil of an electromechanical
system such as a motor when its current causes magnets to move.
balanced Experiencing zero
torque due to gravity.

overall

band A group of levels in a solid that
involve similar standing waves and
thus have similar energies.
band gap A range of energies over
which a solid has no levels available.
bandwidth The range of frequencies
involved in a group of electromagnetic waves.
base of support A surface outlined on
the ground by the points at which an
object is supported.

Bernoulliâs equation An equation relating the total energy of an incompressible fluid in steady-state flow
to the sum of its pressure potential
energy, kinetic energy, and gravitational potential energy.

Brewsterâs angle The angle at which
no vertically polarized light reflects
from a transparent surface that is
oriented horizontally. The precise
angle depends on the surfaceâs index
of refraction.

beta decay A radioactive decay in which
the weak force allows a neutron in a
neutron-rich nucleus to disintegrate
into an electron, a proton, and an
antineutrino. The proton remains
in the nucleus, but the electron and
antineutron escape.

buoyant force The upward force exerted
by a fluid on an object immersed
in that fluid. The buoyant force is
actually caused by pressure from the
fluid. That pressure is highest below
the object, so the force exerted
upward on the objectâs bottom is
greater than the force exerted downward on the objectâs top.

binary The digital representation of
numbers in terms of the powers of
two. The number 6 is represented in
binary as 110, meaning 1 four (22),

black hole A region of space, normally
spherical, within which the gravitational distortions of space and time
are so severe that not even light can
escape.
blackbody spectrum The distribution
of thermal electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black object. This
distribution is the amount of radiation emitted at each wavelength and
depends only on the temperature of
the black object.

around a blunt object stalls and experiences flow separation and pressure
drag.
boiling Accelerated evaporation that occurs when stable gas-phase bubbles
form and grow inside a materialâs
liquid phase.
boiling temperature The threshold
temperature at which gas-phase
bubbles first become stable within a
materialâs liquid phase.
Boltzmann constant The constant of
proportionality relating a gasâs pressure to its particle density and temperature. It has a measured value of
1.381 Ă 10â23 Pa â m3/(particle â K).
boundary layer A thin region of fluid
near a surface that, because of viscous
drag, is not moving at the full speed
of the surrounding airflow.
bremsstrahlung The process in which
a rapidly accelerating charge emits
electromagnetic radiation, usually
an X-ray or gamma-ray photon.

byte Eight binary bits that collectively
can represent a number from 0 to
255. Bytes are often used to represent
letters and other characters, where a
convention associates each character
with a specific number.
calibration The process of comparing a
local reference object to a generally
accepted standard.
capacitance The amount of separated
charge on the plates of a capacitor
divided by the voltage difference
across those plates. The SI unit of
capacitance is the farad.
capacitor An electronic component that
stores separated electric charge on a
pair of plates that are separated by
an insulating layer.
Celsius (Â°C) A temperature scale in
which 0 Â°C is defined as the melting
point of water and 100 Â°C is defined
as the boiling point of water at sea
level. Absolute zero is â273.15 Â°C.
center of gravity The unique point
about which all of an objectâs weight
is evenly distributed and therefore
balanced. Because weight is proportional to mass, the center of mass
is identical to the center of gravity
for objects that are much smaller
than Earth. For larger objects, the
centers of mass and gravity differ
slightly. An object suspended from
its center of gravity will balance and
will experience no net torque due to
gravity. In many situations, you can
accurately predict an objectâs behavior by assuming that all the objectâs
weight acts at its center of gravity.
center of mass The unique point about
which all the objectâs mass is balanced.

Glossary

The center of mass is the natural pivot
point for a free object. In the absence
of outside forces or torques, a rigid
objectâs center of mass travels at constant velocity while the object rotates
at constant angular velocity about this
center of mass.
center of percussion The special spot
on a bat or racket where a collision
with a second object will not cause
any acceleration of the batâs handle.
center of rotation The point around
which all the physical quantities of
rotation are defined.
centripetal acceleration An acceleration that is always directed toward
the center of a circular trajectory.
centripetal force A centrally directed
force on an object. A centripetal
force is not an independent force
but, rather, the sum of other forces
such as gravity acting on the object.
chain reaction A process in which one
event triggers an average of one
or more similar events so that the
process becomes self-sustaining.
chaos Unpredictable behavior in which
minute changes in a systemâs initial
arrangement lead to very different
final arrangements. These differences grow more dramatic with each
passing second.
chaotic system A dynamic system that
is exquisitely sensitive to initial conditions. Minute changes in how you
set up a chaotic system can lead to
wildly different final configurations.
characteristic X-ray An X-ray emitted by X-ray fluorescence from an
atom. The energy of the characteristic X-ray is determined by the
atomâs orbital structure.
charges Objects, particularly small
particles, that carry electric charge.
chemical bond An energy deficit that
holds two or more atoms together
to form a molecule and that must be
repaid to separate the atoms. Chemical bonds form when chemical
potential energy is released during a
moleculeâs assembly.
chemical potential energy Energy
stored in the chemical forces between
atoms. Those chemical forces are
electromagnetic in origin.

a straight-line path in accordance
with inertia and the constant-velocity motion of an object that is experiencing zero net force.

which a black object will emit thermal
electromagnetic radiation with this
particular distribution of wavelengths.
components The portions of a vector
quantity that lie along particular
directions.
compressible Changing density significantly as the pressure changes. A
gas is compressible, since its density
is proportional to its pressure.
Compton scattering The process in
which a photon bounces off a
charged particle, usually an electron. The photon and charged particle exchange energy and momentum
during the collision.
condensation The phase transformation
in which a gas becomes a liquid.
conduction band The group of quantum
levels in an insulator that lies above
the Fermi level.

467

conduction level A quantum level in an
insulator that requires more energy
than the Fermi level and that is normally unoccupied by electrons.
conserved quantity A physical quantity,
such as energy, that is neither created nor destroyed within an isolated

from one another. A converging lens
has a positive focal length and often
produces real images.
corona discharge A faintly glowing discharge that surrounds a small, highly
charged object in the presence of a
gas. In the discharge, electric charge
is transferred from the object to the
