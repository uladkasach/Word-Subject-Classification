Preface

The main objective of Introduction to Environmen-
tal Geology, fifth edition, is to assist students—
particularly those who intend to take only a single
science  course—in  gaining  an  understanding  of
the  interactions  between  geologic  processes,  eco-
logical processes, and society. During the first half
of the twenty-first century, as the human popula-
tion  increases,  the  use  of  resources  grows,  and
changes to the climate occur, many decisions con-
cerning our use of those resources—such as water,
soil, air, minerals, energy, and space to live—will
determine  our  standard  of  living  and  the  quality
of our lives and of the broader environment of our
home, Earth. Scientific knowledge combined with
our  values  will  dictate  many  important  decisions
that  will  have  far-reaching  consequences  for  this
and future generations. Your charge, as a student,
future  leader,  or  informed  citizen,  is  to  choose
paths of development that are beneﬁcial for people
and the environment—that is, the larger commu-
nity that includes plants, animals, water, and air—
in  other  words,  the  environment  consisting  of
ecosystems  that  we  and  all  living  things  depend
upon for our well-being.

Earth’s  dynamic  and  changing  environment
constitutes one of the most compelling and excit-
ing  areas  of  study.  Environmental  geology  in-
volves  the  application  of  geologic  information  to
the entire spectrum of interactions between peo-
ple and the physical environment. During a course
in environmental geology, you will develop an un-
derstanding  of  how  geology  interacts  with  major
environmental  problems  facing  people  and  soci-
ety. This is the essence of Introduction to Environ-
mental  Geology,  fifth  edition.  Our  strategy  with
this text is to:

• Introduce you to the basic concepts and princi-
ples of physical and environmental geology, fo-
cusing on Earth materials and processes.

• Provide  you  with  sufﬁcient  information  con-
cerning  natural  hazards  and  the  geologic
environment that you will be a more informed
citizen. You will be better prepared to make de-
cisions  concerning  where  you  live  and  how
society responds to natural hazards and cata-
strophes  such  as  earthquakes,  volcanic  erup-
tions, and ﬂooding.

• Help  you  develop  an  understanding  of  rela-
tionships between natural resources and pollu-
tion. We seek, ﬁnd, and use resources and, as a
result, may pollute our environment. Thus, it
is important to know how we might minimize
pollution problems.

• Help you understand the basic concepts of en-
vironmental management as they relate to the
geologic  environment  in  areas  such  as  waste
management,  environmental  health,  global
change, and environmental assessment.

After  finishing  your  course  in  environmental
geology, you will be better prepared to make deci-
sions concerning where you build or buy a home,
what  resources  you  choose  to  utilize,  and  appro-
priate  environmental  actions  relevant  to  society
and  Earth’s  ecosystems  from  a  local  scale  to  a
global scale.

New to This Edition
This  ﬁfth  edition  beneﬁted  greatly  from  feedback
from instructors using the text; most of the changes
reﬂect  their  thoughtful  reviews.  One  new  chapter,
on  tsunamis  (Chapter  7),  recognizes  important
links  between  earthquakes  and  marine  processes
that pose a serious hazard to millions of people liv-
ing in coastal areas. In addition to this new chapter,
new  or  extensively  revised  discussions  with  some
quantiﬁcation include:

• The Wilson Cycle and plate tectonics (Chapter 2)
• Earthquake process and how we determine slip

rates on faults (Chapter 6)

• How  a  simple  landslide  hazard  and  factor  of

safety may be determined (Chapter 10)

• How a beach budget is produced (Chapter 11)
• Evaluation  of  ﬂooding  and  water  pollution

linked to ecosystems (Chapters 13 and 14)

• Extensive revision of energy resources and pol-

icy (Chapter 16)

• Global climate change and, in particular, global

warming (Chapter 18)

• New  capstone  chapter  (Chapter  19)  on  envi-
ronmental  health,  air  pollution,  waste  man-
agement,  environmental  analysis  (impact,

planning,  and  law),  and  the  central  role  of
sustainability

• Making the Connection:  Most chapters con-
tain  material  that  help  students  “make  the
connection” between the case histories within
the  chapter  and  the  Five  Fundamental  Con-
cepts on which this book is founded.

Five Fundamental Concepts
This book begins with ﬁve fundamental concepts of
environmental geology. These ﬁve concepts were se-
lected and designed to provide a memorable, trans-
portable framework of understanding that you can
carry away from the class and use throughout life to
make informed choices about your interaction with
and effect upon geologic processes:

• Human population growth: Population growth
is  the  number-one  environmental  problem.
As  population  increases,  so  do  our  effects  and
demands on the environment.

• Sustainability: Sustainability is the long-term
environmental  objective  of  providing  for  the
future of humans and other living things who
share the planet.

• Earth  as  a  system: The  activities  of  human
beings can have important effects on any or all
of  Earth’s  systems,  often  affecting  the  global
environment.

• Hazardous Earth processes: Earth’s hazardous
processes have always occurred and will always
occur.  Human  beings  need  to  recognize  the
threat  of  hazards,  assess  the  risk  to  life  and
property, and either avoid these hazards or plan
accordingly.

• Scientiﬁc  knowledge  and  values: Scientiﬁc
inquiries  often  provide  a  variety  of  potential
solutions to environmental problems. The so-
lution  we  choose  is  a  direct  reﬂection  of  our
value system.

These concepts are introduced in the ﬁrst chapter
and then highlighted throughout the text (look for
the “Revisiting the Fundamental Concepts” section
at the end of each chapter). Also at the end of each
chapter, we return to the case history opening the
chapter  and  reconnect  to  the  case  history  through
selected  aspects  of  the  fundamental  concepts
through  posing  a  series  of  questions.  By  tying  the
content to these ﬁve principles, the text provides a

framework  for  understanding  that  will  extend  be-
yond the conﬁnes of this course and into your every-
day life.

Organization
Introduction to Environmental Geology, ﬁfth edition, is
well suited to your study of environmental geology,
whether  you  are  a  geology  major  or  are  taking  this
class  as  a  science  elective.  I  have  organized
Introduction to Environmental Geology, ﬁfth edition, to
ﬂow naturally from the introduction of fundamental
principles of environmental science and geology, to
more  speciﬁc  information  concerning  how  Earth
works,  to  natural  processes  and  hazards,  to  under-
standing  natural  resources  and  their  management,
with the objective of minimizing environmental degra-
dation.  We  end  with  a  detailed  discussion  of  global
change, focusing on climate and some important inter-
actions between society and the geologic environment.
Introduction  to  Environmental  Geology,  ﬁfth  edi-
tion, consists of 19 chapters arranged in four parts:
• Part 1 introduces philosophy and fundamen-
tal concepts, the structure of Earth and plate
tectonics,  and  the  origin  and  signiﬁcance  of
minerals and rocks. Thus, Part 1 presents fun-
damentals  of  physical  geology,  with  impor-
tant environmental information necessary to
understand  the  remainder  of  the  text.
Chapter  1 introduces  ﬁve  fundamental  con-
cepts  of  environmental  science,  with  an  em-
phasis on the geologic environment. Chapter 2
discusses  the  structure  of  Earth  and  the
important subject of plate tectonics and how
our planet works from a geologic perspective.
Chapter 3 presents geologic information con-
cerning rocks and minerals necessary for un-
derstanding environmental geology problems
and solutions to those problems. In Chapter 3,
we  also  introduce  some  of  the  fundamental
principles  of  geology,  including  the  law  of
original horizontality, the law of cross-cutting
relationships, the concept of the depositional
environment,  the  concept  of  the  rock  cycle,
and the principle of magmatic differentiation.
Chapter  4 presents  basics  of  ecology  with
links  to  geology.  An  ecosystem  includes  a
community of life and its non-living environ-
ment (rock, soil, etc.). The emerging study of
geology  linked  to  ecology  is  exciting  and  of-
fers many opportunities.

• Part 2 addresses natural hazards, including an
introduction  to  natural  hazards  (Chapter  5),
earthquakes (Chapter 6), tsunami (Chapter 7),
volcanic activity (Chapter 8), rivers and ﬂood-
ing  (Chapter  9), 
landslides  (Chapter  10),
coastal processes (Chapter 11), and impacts of
extraterrestrial  objects  (Chapter  12).  The  in-
tent is not to provide copious amounts of de-
tailed information concerning these processes
but to focus on the basics involved and the en-
vironmental  concerns  of  Earth  processes  and
natural hazards.

• Part 3 presents the major resources associated
with the geologic environment and the subject
of  pollution.  Important  topics  include  water
resources 
(Chapter  13),  water  pollution
(Chapter 14), mineral resources (Chapter 15),
energy  resources  (Chapter  16),  and  soils
(Chapter 17). The focus is to present the basic
principles concerning natural resources and to
identify  potential  environmental  problems
and solutions.

• Part 4 is concerned with the important topics
of global change, environmental management,
and  relationships  between  environment  and
society.  Chapter  18 discusses  global  change
with  a  focus  on  global  warming  and  stratos-
pheric ozone depletion. Finally, in Chapter 19,
which is a capstone for the book, we discuss re-
lationships between environment and society,
with  topics  such  as  environmental  health,  air
pollution,  waste  management,  land  use  plan-
ning,  environmental  law,  environmental  im-

host the online version of Hazard City.

Hazard  City:  Assignments  in  Applied  Geology,
fourth  edition Found  on  the  premium  website,
Hazard City provides  instructors  meaningful,  easy-
to-assign,  and  easy-to-grade  as-
signments  for  students.  Based
on  the  ﬁctional  town  of  Hazard
City,  the  assignments  put  stu-
dents  in  the  role  of  a  practicing
geologist—gathering  and  ana-
lyzing  real  data,  evaluating  risks,  and  making
assessments  and  recommendations.  Hazard  City
provides the following resources and beneﬁts:

• Substantial  critical  thinking  assignments:
Each activity takes 30–90 minutes. The activities
require students to gather and analyze real data,
participate in real issues, encounter uncertainty,
and make decisions.

• New assessment questions: Assignable, as-
sessable  multiple-choice  questions  have  been
added  to  each  Hazard  City assignment.  The
questions  engage  students  in  higher-order
thinking  to  apply  the  concepts  and  processes
learned  in  the  assignments  to  the  broader
world in different contexts.

• Student ﬂexibility for submitting answers:
Using  downloadable  worksheets,  students
can  print  out,  complete,  and  submit  their
answers to the instructor. Students can also
answer assignable multiple-choice questions
directly  from  the  premium  website  that  are
computer graded and feed to a course grade
book.

• Thoroughly class tested: All activities have
been reﬁned through testing in both the tradi-
tional and online classroom.

Hazard City provides the following activities:

• Map  Reading: This  activity  builds  map-
reading skills and gives students the conﬁdence
they need to solve map-based problems in later
assignments.

• Groundwater Contamination: Students use
ﬁeld and laboratory data to prepare a contour
map  of  the  water  table,  determine  the  direc-
tion of groundwater ﬂow, and map a contami-
nated area.

• Volcanic  Hazard  Assessment: Students
research  volcanic  hazards,  collect  ﬁeld  infor-
mation, and make decisions to determine the
potential impact of a volcanic eruption on dif-
ferent parts of Hazard City.

• Landslide  Hazard  Assessment: Students
research  the  factors  that  determine  landslide
hazard at ﬁve construction sites and make rec-
ommendations for development.

• Earthquake Damage Assessment: Students
research  the  effects  of  earthquakes  on  build-
ings, explore Hazard City, and determine how
many  people  need  emergency  housing,  given
an earthquake of speciﬁc intensity.

• Flood  Insurance  Rate  Maps: Flood  insur-
ance  premiums  are  estimated  using  a  ﬂood
insurance  rate  map,  insurance  tables,  and  site
characteristics.

• Snowpack  Monitoring: Students  utilize  cli-
matic data to estimate variables that are key to
ﬂood  control  and  water  supply  management.
• Coal  Property  Evaluation: The  potential
value  of  a  mineral  property  is  estimated  by
learning about mining and property evaluation
and then applying that knowledge in a resource
calculation.

• Landﬁll Siting: Students use maps and geo-
logic  data  to  determine  whether  any  of  ﬁve
proposed  sites  meet  the  requirements  of  the
state administrative code for landﬁll siting.

• Shoreline  Property  Assessment: Students
visit  four  related  waterfront  building  sites—
some  developed  and  some  not—and  analyze
the  risk  each  faces  due  to  shoreline  erosion
processes.

• Tsunami/Storm Surge: Students learn about
the  causes  and  effects  of  tsunamis  and  storm
surge, and then they develop a hazard assess-
ment response in case of inundation by water.

This book is dedicated to the next generation of people on Earth 
who will, more than others before them, by necessity make many 
important decisions about population growth, global change, energy use, 
and land use that will be so important in the next few decades. 
It appears that environmental problems will need to be very seriously 
addressed very soon if we wish to sustain Earth as we 
in the present generation know it.

About the Author
Edward A. Keller

Ed Keller is a professor, researcher,
writer, and, most importantly, men-
tor  and  teacher  to  undergraduate
and  graduate  students.  Currently,
Dr. Keller’s students are working on
earthquake  hazards,  tectonic  geo-
morphology  of  active  ﬂooding,  the
role  of  wildﬁre  in  landscape  devel-
opment,  geologic  and  hydrologic
that control the formation of pools
that  are  important  habitat  to  en-
dangered southern steelhead trout,
ﬂood hazards, the role of the inva-
sive  plant  Arundo  donax (which
looks like bamboo) on stream form
and process in southern California, and the origin of
small coastal lagoons in southern California.

Ed was born and raised in southern California. He
holds a bachelor’s degree in Geology and Mathemat-
ics  from  California  State  University  at  Fresno,  a
master’s  degree  in  Geology  from  the  University  of
California  at  Davis,  and  a  Ph.D.  in  Geology  from
Purdue  University.  While  pursuing  his  Ph.D.  in
Geology from Purdue University in 1973, Ed wrote
part  of  the  ﬁrst  edition  of  Environmental  Geology
(now in the ninth edition). The text soon became a
foundation of the environmental geology curriculum.

Ed joined the faculty of the Univer-
sity  of  California  at  Santa  Barbara
in  1976  and  has  been  there  since,
serving multiple times as the chair
of  both  the  Environmental  Studies
and  Hydrologic  Science  programs.
In that time, he has been an author
of more than 100 articles, including
seminal  works  on  ﬂuvial  processes
and  tectonic  geomorphology.  Ed’s
academic  honors  include  the  Don  J.
Easterbrook  Distinguished  Scientist
Award, Geological Society of America
(2004), the Quatercentenary Fellow-
ship  from  Cambridge  University,
England  (2000),  two  Outstanding  Alumnus  Awards
from Purdue University (1994, 1996), a Distinguished
Alumnus  Award  from  California  State  University  at
Fresno (1998), and the Outstanding Outreach Award
from  the  Southern  California  Earthquake  Center
(1999).  Ed  is  a  fellow  of  the  Geological  Society  of
America.

Ed and his wife, Valery, who brings clarity to his
writing, love walks on the beach at sunset and when
the  night  herons  guard  moonlight  sand  at  Arroyo
Burro  Beach  in  Santa  Barbara.  Walking  beaches  in
the moonlight inspired the following.

We Are Children of the Pleistocene

Whether  it  is  clear  to  us  or  not  we  are  a  children  of
the Pleistocene

Our genes gives us away
Nearly  invariant  over  more  than  one  hundred

thousand years of deep time

Morning mist
Fresh barriers
Our loved ones
We  are  more  at  ease  in  nature  than  with  the  horn

We remain connected to nature in many fascinating

and mysterious ways

Vision connects us with our universe
Children playing
Star light

Natural sounds make us feel alive
Music of frogs at night ﬂow of stream over pebbles

Swish of water on the beach
Rustle  of  leaves  from  wind  crunch  of  grass  from

Wet forest soil following rain
Salty air kicked up by waves

Fire  provokes  an  image  of  contentment  safety  and

community

We dance play instruments sing and tell stories about
other  tribes  and  predators  perhaps  another  football
team around a ﬁre as we always have

Hike with a group during the day we spread out
At night hike and we group together with ﬂashlights on
We feel safer when closer together

We walk our property
Marking territory with signs or acts

We seek romantic natural places such as meadows
beaches  or  forest  to  be  with  our  mate  at  intimate
times

When  we  are  not  connected  to  nature  we  deprive
ourselves and our children of our heritage and our souls
suffer

We are a children of the Pleistocene
Embrace our heritage and our souls sing

1Part
Foundations of 
Environmental Geology

he objective of Part 1 is to present the ﬁve funda-
mental principles of environmental geology and the im-
portant concepts necessary to understand the rest of the
text. Of particular importance are (1) the fundamental con-
cepts of environmental science, emphasizing the geologic
environment; (2) information about the structure of Earth
and, from a plate tectonics perspective, how our planet
works; (3) geologic information concerning rocks and min-
erals necessary to understand environmental geology
problems and solutions to those problems; and (4) an un-
derstanding of linkages between geologic processes and
the living world.

Chapter 1 opens with a deﬁnition and discussion of en-

vironmental geology, followed by a short history of the
universe and the origin of Earth. Of particular importance
is the concept of geologic time, which is critical in evaluat-
ing the role of geologic processes and human interaction
in the environment. Five fundamental concepts are intro-
duced: human population growth, sustainability, Earth as a
system, hazardous Earth processes, and scientiﬁc knowl-
edge and values. These are revisited throughout the text.
Chapter 2 presents a brief discussion of the internal struc-
ture of Earth and a rather lengthy treatment of plate tec-
tonics. Over periods of several tens of millions of years, the
positions of the continents and the development of
mountain ranges and ocean basins have dramatically
changed our global environment. The patterns of ocean

currents, global climate, and the distribution of living
things on Earth are all, in part, a function of the processes
that have constructed and maintained continents and
ocean basins over geologic time.

Minerals and rocks and how they form in geologic envi-
ronments are the subjects of Chapter 3. Minerals and rocks
provide basic resources that our society depends on for
materials to construct our homes, factories, and other
structures; to manufacture airplanes, trains, cars, buses,
and trucks that move people and goods around the globe;
and to maintain our industrial economy, including every-
thing from computers to eating utensils. The study of min-
erals and rocks aids in our general understanding of Earth
processes at local, regional, and global levels. This knowl-
edge is particularly important in understanding hazardous
processes, including landslides and volcanic eruptions, in
which properties of the rocks are intimately related to the
processes and potential effects on human society.

Geology and ecology and the many links between

them are presented in Chapter 4. An ecosystem includes
the nonliving environment, which is the geologic environ-
ment. In addition, the living part of an ecosystem (i.e., a
community of organisms) has many important feedback
cycles and links to important landscape and geologic
processes. Chapter 4 presents some basics of ecology for
geologists and emphasizes their relationship to environ-
mental geology.

population as the
number-one
environmental problem

• The concept of

sustainability and
important factors
related to the
environmental crisis

Case History
Caribbean Island of Hispaniola: Story of History, People,
Environmental Damage, and Earthquake

When we study the his-
tory of the landscape
or people through
time, we often em-
ploy a scientiﬁc
method different
from that used 
in laboratory 
experiments
with quantita-
tive manipula-
tion of vari-
ables to test
hypotheses
(i.e., assumed
answers to
questions).
We cannot
manipulate
the past, and,
as a result, we
sometimes use
comparative
studies that
have the objec-
tive of observ-
ing and describ-
ing the history
of an area and
making infer-
ences within a
larger framework.
This may involve
studying the geologic
and anthropologic
record to make com-

parisons. This approach
can be a fruitful technique
in the historical sciences, in-

cluding geology, ecology, hy-
drology, and environmental sci-
ence. One of the research tools is
the application of uniformitarian-

ism which states that if we study
processes operating today, we can say
something about what happened in
the past. We may also study the pre-
historic and historic record to make

inferences about what future changes
may occur.1

The island of Hispaniola offers an
opportunity for comparative research
and the evaluation of two countries
that are side by side. The eastern two-
thirds of the island is the site of what
is today the Dominican Republic, and
the western one-third of the island is
the country Haiti. Both countries
share the island, but there are signiﬁ-
cant differences between them. For
example, in the Dominican Republic
there is a central area that is a good
place for agriculture, and the eastern
end of the island receives more rainfall
than does the western end. Haiti has
more rugged topography, steeper
slopes, and less rainfall, and you might
expect that it has natural processes
working more against it than does the
Dominican Republic. This certainly is
the case today, but it has not always
been so. Earlier in their history, soon
after independence, Haiti was far
richer than the Dominican Republic;
however, there has been a reversal of
fortunes, and today Haiti is the poor-
est country in the Western Hemi-
sphere and one of the poorest in the
world. The differences between the
Dominican Republic and Haiti are eas-
ily seen by examining high-altitude
aerial photographs which reveal that
the Dominican Republic has a green,
forest-covered landscape, compared to
the much more desolate, dryer-look-
ing landscape to the east that is Haiti
(Figure 1.1).1

Comparisons of Haiti with the 

Dominican Republic in terms of size,
population, gross domestic product
per person, and several other vari-
ables are shown in Table 1.1 (page 6),
along with comparative data for Cuba
and Puerto Rico. In Haiti, the median
age of the population (i.e., that age
where 50 percent are younger) is 18,
compared to 24 for the Dominican

Republic; life expectancy in Haiti is 
60 years, compared to 72 in the 
Dominican Republic; and, most impor-
tantly, the forest cover of Haiti is 3.8
percent, compared to 28.4 percent in
the Dominican Republic. The percent-
age of forest cover is much lower for
Haiti than for the other Caribbean is-
lands shown in Table 1.1. The annual
income for the average Haitian person
is only about one-fourth that of the
Dominican Republic, half of that for
Cuba, and a small percentage of that
for Puerto Rico. Also shown in Table
1.1 are the major environmental issues
associated with the four islands. Haiti
stands out from the other countries be-
cause of its extensive deforestation and
serious soil erosion problem, both of
which are linked to an inadequate and
unsafe water supply for the people. As
a result, Haiti is nearly a failed state.
The government is not able to provide
its people with the basics for an ade-
quate life. This situation is unique
among the other Caribbean islands.1,2

Historians and other scientists

have studied the differences between
Haiti and the Dominican Republic for
a number of years. There is general
agreement that many of the differ-
ences result from the different colo-
nial histories of the two countries.
The people of Haiti went through a
bloody revolution with France, gain-
ing their freedom in 1804. Haiti at
the time of French rule was prosper-
ous, but it was a slave state with a
high population density. Following
the bloody revolution when the
French were defeated, the Haitian
people mistrusted Europeans to such
an extent that trade with other coun-
tries was much reduced. Furthermore,
they had a language and dialect spo-
ken only in Haiti, so there were com-
munication problems with the rest of
the world. To complicate matters,
Western countries were reluctant to

REPUBLIC

deal with a country that had gone
through a bloody revolution and over-
thrown slavery as early as 1804. Even
so, following the revolution, Haiti was
relatively wealthy and did well for a
while. However, eventually, political,
social, and economic forces led to a
downward spiral that resulted in Haiti
becoming the poorest country in the
Western Hemisphere. In the Domini-
can Republic, the path to indepen-
dence was a much different story.
Spain was wealthy in terms of its
colonies and wasn’t particularly inter-
ested in the Dominican Republic; it
was more interested in ﬁnding gold
and other things than in agriculture.
As a result, periods of independence
for the Dominican Republic ﬂuctu-
ated on and off until, ﬁnally, the
Spanish just walked away. The 
Dominican people were left with the
Spanish language, a dominant lan-
guage of the time,1 and good contacts
with European people and, so, were

able to be effective in the develop-
ment of trade and commerce with the
rest of the world.

Later in their histories, absolute
dictators ruled both countries—but
one of the dictators in the Dominican
Republic was interested in preserving
forests for sustainable timber harvest-
ing in order to increase the money in
his own accounts. For this and other
reasons, the Dominican Republic
today has retained much of its forest
cover and has a good deal of land in
national parks. On the other hand,
when the French were getting ready to
leave, they began the deforestation of
Haiti by taking a lot of timber with
them to Europe; during the period fol-
lowing independence, that deforesta-
tion continued at an accelerating pace.
Trees were unable to regenerate effec-
tively, due to Haiti’s lesser amounts 
of rainfall, and extensive soil erosion
occurred. Today, Haiti is virtually 
denuded of forests and has a seriously

high erosion rate that favors landslid-
ing and other problems related to
storms from the Caribbean.1,2

The population of Haiti has grown, 
as has that of the Dominican Republic.
However, in Haiti, the high density of
people living in degraded land areas
has led to a situation in which the
people cannot adequately support
themselves on their own land, and, as
a result, they have become dependent
upon importing food and other com-
modities necessary for life. Further-
more, because the country is so poor, 
the government has been unable to
ensure that adequate building con-
struction codes have been imple-
mented. As a result, when a large
earthquake struck in 2010, many gov-
ernment and private buildings col-
lapsed, and the number of deaths was
inordinately high. More than 1 million
people were displaced when about
190,000 homes were destroyed or
damaged. A similar earthquake in the

United States probably would have
produced a few dozen deaths, not
over 200,000. In this sense, Haiti’s
earthquake of 2010, which nearly de-
stroyed the country (one-third of the
population was affected), can be con-
sidered a human-made disaster.3,4
One year after the earthquake, most
of the displaced people were still liv-
ing in temporary housing (often
tents; see Figure 1.2), with too little
sanitation, food, and clean water.
They remained vulnerable to further
hazards from violent storms that
periodically strike the region. Most 
of the earthquake rubble from 
the destroyed buildings had not 
been cleared.

In summary, Haiti is an example of
what can happen when environmen-
tal degradation linked to high human
population, degraded water and soil
resources, and inadequate infrastruc-
ture result in extreme poverty and

loss of control of the government in
the country. Controlling, limiting,
and minimizing adjunct poverty is an

important goal for the future of the
people of the world if peace and secu-
rity are to be obtained.

1.1 Introduction to

Environmental Geology

Everything has a beginning and an end. Our Earth
began about 4.6 billion years ago, when a cloud of
interstellar  gas  known  as  a  solar  nebula  collapsed,
forming  protostars  and  planetary  systems  (see  A
Closer  Look:  Earth’s  Place  in  Space).  Life  on  Earth
began  about  3.5  billion  years  ago,  and,  since  then,
multitudes  of  diverse  organisms  have  emerged,
prospered, and died out, leaving only fossils to mark
their  place  in  Earth’s  history.  Just  a  few  million
years ago, our ancestors set the stage for the present
dominance of the human species. As certainly as our
Sun  will  die,  we  too  will  eventually  disappear.
Viewed  in  terms  of  billions  of  years,  our  role  in
Earth’s history may be insigniﬁcant, but, for those
of us now living and for our children and theirs, our
impact on the environment is signiﬁcant indeed.

Geologically  speaking,  we  have  been  here  for  a
very  short  time.  Dinosaurs,  for  example,  ruled  the
land for more than 100 million years. Although we
do not know how long our own reign will be, the fos-
sil record suggests that all species eventually become

extinct. How will the history of our own species un-
fold,  and  who  will  write  it?  Our  hope  is  to  leave
something more than some fossils that mark a brief
time when Homo sapiens ﬂourished. Hopefully, as we
evolve  we  will  continue  to  become  more  environ-
mentally  aware  and  ﬁnd  ways  to  live  in  harmony
with our planet.

Geology is the science of processes related to the
composition, structure, and history of Earth and its
life. Geology is an interdisciplinary science, relying
on aspects of chemistry (composition of Earth’s ma-
terials), physics (natural laws), and biology (under-
standing of life-forms).

Environmental geology is applied geology. Speciﬁ-
cally, it is the use of geologic information to help us
solve conﬂicts in land use, to minimize environmental
degradation, and to maximize the beneﬁcial results of
using  our  natural  and  modiﬁed  environments.  The
application of geology to these problems includes the
study of the following (Figure 1.3):

1. Earth  materials,  such  as  minerals,  rocks,  and
soils, to determine how they form, their poten-
tial  use  as  resources  or  waste  disposal  sites,
and their effects on human health

Look

Earth’s Place in Space

The famous geologist Preston Cloud
wrote:

Born from the wreckage of stars,
compressed to a solid state by the
force of its own gravity, mobilized
by the heat of gravity and radioac-
tivity, clothed in its ﬁlmy garments
of air and water by the hot breath
of volcanoes, shaped and mineral-
ized by 4.6 billion years of crustal
evolution, warmed and peopled
by the Sun, this resilient but ﬁnite
globe is all our species has to sus-
tain it forever.5

In this short, eloquent statement,

Cloud takes us from the origin of Earth
to the concept of sustainability that
today is at the forefront of thinking
about the environment and our future.

We Have a Right to Be Here.
The place of humanity in the uni-
verse is stated well in the Desiderata:
“You are a child of the universe, no
less than the trees and the stars; you
have the right to be here. And
whether or not it is clear to you, no
doubt the universe is unfolding as it
should.”6 To some, this might sound a
little out of place in science, but, as
emphasized further by Cloud, people
can never escape the fact that we are
one piece of the biosphere, and, al-
though we stand high in it, we are
not above it.5

Origin of the Universe. Figure
1.A presents an idealized view of the
history of the universe, with an em-
phasis on the origin of our solar sys-
tem and Earth. Scientists studying
the stars and the origin of the uni-
verse believe that, about 12 billion

years ago, there was a giant explo-
sion known as the big bang. This ex-
plosion produced the atomic
particles that later formed galaxies,
stars, and planets. It is believed that,
about 7 billion years ago, one of the
ﬁrst generations of giant stars experi-
enced a tremendous explosion
known as a supernova. This released
huge amounts of energy, producing
a solar nebula, which is thought to
be a spinning cloud of dust and gas.
The solar nebula condensed as a
result of gravitational processes, and
our Sun formed at the center, but
some of the particles may have been
trapped in solar orbits as rings, similar
to those we observe around the
planet Saturn. The density of parti-
cles in individual rings was evidently
not constant, so gravitational attrac-
tion from the largest density of parti-
cles in the rings attracted others until
they collapsed into the planetary sys-
tem we have today. Thus, the early
history of planet Earth, as well as that
of the other planets in our solar sys-
tem, was characterized by the in-
tense bombardment of meteorites.
This bombardment was associated
with accretionary processes—that is,
the amalgamation of various-sized
particles, from dust to meteorites,
stony asteroids, and ice-rich comets
many kilometers in diameter—that
resulted in the formation of Earth
about 4.6 billion years ago.5,7 This is
the part of Earth’s history that Cloud
refers to when he states that Earth
was born from the wreckage of stars
and compressed to a solid state by
the force of its own gravity. Heat
generated deep within Earth, along
with gravitational settling of heavier

elements, such as iron, helped
differentiate the planet into the
layered structure we see today 
(see Chapter 2).

Origin of Atmosphere and
Water on Earth. Water from ice-
cored comets and outgassing, or the
release of gases, such as carbon diox-
ide and water vapor from volcanoes
and other processes, produced
Earth’s early atmosphere and water.
About 3.5 billion years ago, the ﬁrst
primitive life-forms appeared on
Earth in an oxygen-deﬁcient environ-
ment. Some of those primitive organ-
isms began producing oxygen
through photosynthesis, which pro-
foundly affected Earth’s atmosphere.
Early primitive, oxygen-producing life
probably lived in the ocean, protect-
ed from the Sun’s ultraviolet radia-
tion. However, as the atmosphere
evolved and oxygen increased, an
ozone layer was produced in the at-
mosphere that shielded Earth from
harmful radiation. Plants evolved that
colonized the land surface, producing
forests, meadows, ﬁelds, and other
environments that made possible the
evolution of animal life on the land.5

The spiral of life generalized in

Figure 1.A delineates evolution as life
changed from simple to complex
over several billion years of Earth’s
history. The names of the eras, peri-
ods, and epochs that geologists use
to divide geologic time are labeled

of years from the present (Table 1.2).
If you go on to study geology, they
will become as familiar to you as the
months of the year. The boundaries

are based on both the study of what
was living at the particular time and
on important global geologic events
in Earth’s history. Relative ages of
rocks are based on the assemblage of
fossils—that is, evidence for past life,
such as shells, bones, teeth, leaves,
seeds—that are found in rocks or sed-
iments. A general principle of geol-
ogy, known as the law of faunal 
assemblages, states that rocks with
similar fossils are most likely of a simi-
lar geologic age. For example, if we
ﬁnd bones of dinosaurs in a rock, we

know the rocks are Mesozoic in age.
Fossils provide relative ages of rocks;
numerical, or absolute, dates depend
upon a variety of sophisticated,
chemical age-dating techniques.
These age-dating techniques allow
geologists to often pinpoint the geo-
logic age of rocks containing fossils to
within a few million years or better.

Evolution as a Process. The
evolutionary process as deduced
from the fossil record has not been a
smooth continuous one but, instead,

has been punctuated by explosions
of new species at some times and ex-
tinction of many species at other
times. Five mass extinction events
are shown in Figure 1.A.

Evolution and extinction of

species are natural processes, but, for
those times when many species be-
came extinct at approximately the
same time, we use the term mass ex-
tinction. For example, the dinosaurs
became extinct approximately 
65 million years ago. Some geologists
believe this mass extinction resulted

CHAPTER 1

Philosophy and Fundamental Concepts

from climatic and environmental
changes that naturally occurred on
Earth; others believe the planet was
struck by a “death star,” an asteroid of
about 10 km (6 mi) in diameter, that
crashed into what is today the
Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. It is
believed that another such impact
would produce ﬁrestorms and huge
dust clouds that would circle Earth in
the atmosphere for a prolonged
period of time, blocking out sunlight,
greatly reducing or stopping photo-
synthesis, and eventually leading to
mass extinction of both the species
that eat plants and the predators that
feed on the plant eaters.7

It is speculated that asteroids of
the size that may have caused the 

dinosaurs to become extinct are not
unique, and such catastrophic im-
pacts have occurred at other times
during Earth history. Such an event is
the ultimate geologic hazard, the ef-
fects of which might result in another
mass extinction, perhaps including
humans! (See Chapter 11.) Fortu-
nately, the probability of such an oc-
currence is very small during the next
few thousand years. In addition, we
are developing the technology to
identify and possibly deﬂect asteroids
before they strike Earth. The history of
our solar system and Earth, brieﬂy
outlined here, is an incredible story of
planetary and biological evolution.
What will the future bring? We do not
know, of course, but, certainly, the fu-

ture will be punctuated by a change,
and, as evolutionary processes con-
tinue, we too will evolve, perhaps to a
new species. Through the processes
of pollution, agriculture, urbanization,
industrialization, and the land clear-
ing of tropical forests, humans appear
to be causing an acceleration of the
rate of extinction of plant and animal
species. These human activities 
are signiﬁcantly reducing Earth’s
biodiversity—the number and vari-
ability of species over time and space
(area)—and are thought to be a
major environmental problem be-
cause many living things, including
humans, on Earth depend on the en-
vironment with its diversity of life-
forms for their existence.

2. Natural  hazards,  such  as  ﬂoods,  landslides,
earthquakes, and volcanic activity, in order to
minimize loss of life and property

3. Land for site selection, land-use planning, and

environmental impact analysis

4. Hydrologic processes of groundwater and sur-
face  water  to  evaluate  water  resources  and
water pollution problems

5. Geologic processes, such as deposition of sedi-
ment  on  the  ocean  ﬂoor,  the  formation  of
mountains, and the movement of water on and
below the surface of Earth, to evaluate local, re-
gional, and global change

Considering  the  breadth  of  its  applications,  we
can  further  deﬁne  environmental  geology  as  the
branch of Earth science that studies the entire spec-
trum of human interactions with the physical envi-
ronment. In this context, environmental geology is a
branch of environmental science, the science of link-
ages  between  physical,  biological,  and  social
processes in the study of the environment.
1.2 Fundamental Concepts 

of Environmental Geology

fundamental concepts serve as a conceptual frame-
work upon which the rest of the textbook will build.
As  you  read  through  Introduction  to  Environmental
Geology, you will notice that these concepts are revis-
ited throughout the text:

1. Human population growth
2. Sustainability
3. Earth as a system
4. Hazardous Earth processes
5. Scientiﬁc knowledge and values

The ﬁve concepts presented here do not constitute
a list of all concepts that are important to environ-
mental  geologists,  and  they  are  not  meant  to  be
memorized.  However,  having  a  general  under-
standing of each concept will help you comprehend
and  evaluate  the  material  presented  in  the  rest  of
the text.

Concept One: Human Population
Growth

The number-one environmental problem
is the increase in human population.

Before we begin to explore the many facets of envi-
ronmental geology presented in this textbook, some
basic  concepts  need  to  be  introduced.  These  ﬁve

The number-one environmental problem is the ever-
growing human population. For most of human his-
tory, our numbers were small, as was our impact on

Fundamental Concepts of Environmental Geology

13

Earth.  With  the  advent  of  agriculture,  sanitation,
modern  medicine,  and,  especially,  inexpensive  en-
ergy sources, such as oil, we have proliferated to
the point where our numbers are a problem.
The total environmental impact from peo-
ple is estimated by the impact per person
multiplied  by  the  total  number  of  peo-
ple. Therefore, as population increases,
the  total  impact  must  also  increase.
As  population  increases,  more  re-
sources  are  needed  and,  given  our
present technology, greater environ-
mental disruption results. When local
population  density  increases  as  a  re-
sult  of  political  upheaval  and  wars,
famine may result (Figure 1.4).

FIGURE 1.4 Famine Korem Camp, Ethiopia, in 1984. Hungry people are forced
to flee their homes as a result of political and military activity and gather in camps
such as these. Surrounding lands may be devastated by overgrazing from stock
animals, gathering of ﬁrewood, and just too many people in a conﬁned area. The
result may be famine. (David Burnett/Contact Press Images, Inc.)

Figure 1.4 illustrates two examples of exponen-
tial  growth.  In  each  case,  the  object  being  consid-
ered (student pay or world population) grows quite
slowly at ﬁrst, begins to increase more rapidly, and
then continues at a very rapid rate. Even very mod-
est  rates  of  growth  eventually  produce  very  large
increases in whatever is growing.

How  Fast  Does  Population  Double? A  general
rule is that doubling time (D) is roughly equal to 70
divided by the growth rate (G):
D = 70>G

Using this approximation, we ﬁnd that a population
with a 2 percent annual growth rate would double in
about 35 years. If it were growing at 1 percent per
year, it would double in about 70 years. Figure 1.5b
compares  four  countries  (Kenya,  Haiti,  the  United
States, and Italy) in terms of age structure (percent-
age  of  population  at  speciﬁed  age  ranges),  popula-
tion  growth  rate  as  a  percentage  per  year,  and  the
doubling time. Age structure is important because it
is  related  to  socioeconomic  issues.  Countries  with  a
high percentage of young people under age 15, such
as Kenya and Haiti, will have to invest more in educa-
tion  and  youth  programs.  Countries  with  a  young
population may also have difﬁculty with employment.

Exponential Growth
What  Is  the  Population  Bomb?
Overpopulation has been a problem in
some  areas  of  the  world  for  at  least
several  hundred  years,  but  it  is  now
apparent  that  it  is  a  global  problem.  From  1830  to
1930, the world’s population doubled from 1 to 2 bil-
lion  people.  By  1970  it  had  nearly  doubled  again,
and  by  the  year  2010  there  were  nearly  7  billion
people  on  Earth.  The  problem  is  sometimes  called
the population bomb because the exponential growth
of the human population results in an explosive in-
crease  in  the  number  of  people  (Figure  1.5a).
Exponential growth for increase in humans means
that the number of people added to the population
each  year  is  not  constant;  rather,  a  constant  per-
centage  of  the  current  population  is  added  each
year. As an analogy, consider a high-yield savings ac-
count that pays interest of 7 percent per year. If you
start with $100, at the end of the ﬁrst year you have
$107, and you earned $7 in interest. At the end of
the  second  year,  7  percent  of  $107  is  $7.49,  and
your balance is $107 plus $7.49, or $114.49. Inter-
est in the third year is 7 percent of 114.49, or $8.01,
and your account has $122.51. In 30 years you will
have saved about $800.00. Read on to ﬁnd out how I
know this.

There  are  two  important  aspects  of  exponential

growth:

• The growth rate, measured as a percentage
• The  doubling  time,  or  the  time  it  takes  for

whatever is growing to double

Lack of employment can result in social unrest. Coun-
tries with an older population, such as Italy, will have
to provide more for health programs for the elderly.
Providing retirement beneﬁts may be difﬁcult as the
percentage of older people grows compared to people
working to support social services.

Returning  to  our  discussion  of  exponential
growth, many systems in nature display exponential

growth some of the time, so it is important that we
be able to recognize such growth because it can even-
tually yield incredibly large numbers. As an extreme
example  of  exponential  growth  (Figure  1.6a),  con-
sider  the  student  who,  after  taking  a  job  for 
1 month, requests from the employer a payment of 1
cent for the ﬁrst day of work, 2 cents for the second
day,  4  cents  for  the  third  day,  and  so  on.  In  other

Fundamental Concepts of Environmental Geology

15

words,  the  payment  would  double  each  day.  What
would be the total? It would take the student 8 days
to earn a wage of more than $1 per day, and by the
eleventh day, earnings would be more than $10 per
day.  Payment  for  the  sixteenth  day  of  the  month
would be more than $300, and on the last day of the
31-day  month,  the  student’s  earnings  for  that  one
day would be more than $10 million! This is an ex-
treme  case  because  the  constant  rate  of  increase  is
100  percent  per  day,  but  it  shows  that  exponential
growth is a very dynamic process. The human popu-
lation  increases  at  a  much  lower  rate—1.4  percent
per  year  today—but  even  this  slower  exponential
growth  eventually  results  in  a  dramatic  increase  in
numbers (Figure 1.6b).

Consider the often-cited analogy of a farmer with
a 100-acre (40 ha) pond. The pond is invaded by an
exotic  water  plant  (i.e.,  an  invasive  species)  that
ﬂoats on the surface, covering the water with a thick
mat  of  vegetation.  The  farmer  observes  that  the
plant  doubles  its  area  every  2  weeks.  At  ﬁrst  the
growth appears slow, as the plant grows to covers a
small part of the pond. The farmer decides to elimi-
nate  the  plant  when  it  covers  one-fourth  of  the
pond.  How  much  time  will  he  have?  He  will  have
only  4  weeks!  One-fourth  of  the  pond  doubles  to
one-half  in  2  weeks,  and  in  another  2  weeks,  the
pond  would  be  completely  covered  by  the  invasive
species.

Exponential  growth  will  be  discussed  further
under  Concept  Three,  when  we  consider  systems
and change.

Human Population Through History
What  Is  Our  History  of Population  Growth?
The story of human population increase is put in his-
toric perspective in Table 1.3. When we were hunter-
gatherers, our numbers were very small, and growth
rates were very low. With agriculture, growth rates
in human population increased by several hundred
times,  due  to  the  stable  food  supply.  During  the
early industrial period (A.D. 1600 to 1800), growth
rates  increased  again  by  about  10  times.  With  the
Industrial Revolution, with modern sanitation and
medicine,  the  growth  rates  increased  another  10
times. Human population reached 6 billion in 2000.
By  2013  it  will  be  7  billion,  and  by  2050  it  will  be
about 9 billion. That is 1 billion new people in only 13
years and 3 billion (almost one-half of today’s popula-
tion) in 50 years. By comparison, total human popu-
lation had reached only 1 billion in about A.D. 1800,
after over 40,000 years of human history! Less devel-
oped  countries  have  death  rates  similar  to  those  of
more  developed  countries,  but  their  birth  rates  are
twice  those  of  developed  countries.  India  will  likely
have the greatest population of all countries by 2050,
with about 18 percent of the total world population,

followed by China, with 15 percent. Together, these
two countries will have about one-third of the total
world population by 2050.8

Population Growth and the Future
How  Many  People  Can  Earth  Comfortably
Support? Because  Earth’s  population  is  increasing
exponentially, many scientists are concerned that in
the twenty-ﬁrst century it will be impossible to sup-
ply resources and a high-quality environment for the
billions  of  people  who  may  be  added  to  the  world
population. Three billion more people by 2050, with
almost all of the growth in the developing countries,
is cause for concern. Increasing population at local,
regional, and global levels compounds nearly all envi-
ronmental geology problems, including pollution of
ground and surface waters; production and manage-
ment  of  hazardous  waste;  and  exposure  of  people
and  human  structures  to  natural  processes  (haz-
ards), such as ﬂoods, landslides, volcanic eruptions,
and earthquakes.

There  is  no  easy  answer  to  the  population  prob-
lem. In the future, we may be able to mass-produce
enough food from a nearly landless agriculture or use
artiﬁcial  growing  situations  to  support  our  ever-
growing numbers. However, the ability to feed people
does not solve the problems of limited space available
to people and maintenance or improvement of their
quality of life. Some studies suggest that the present

population  is  already  above  a  comfortable  carrying
capacity for the planet. Carrying capacity is the maxi-
mum number of people Earth can hold without caus-
ing environmental degradation that reduces the abil-
ity of the planet to support the population. The role
of education is paramount in the population problem.
As  people  (particularly  women)  become  more  edu-
cated, the population growth rate tends to decrease.
As the rate of literacy increases, population growth is
reduced.  Given  the  variety  of  cultures,  values,  and
norms in the world today, it appears that our greatest
hope for population control is, in fact, education.9

Earth  Is  Our  Only  Suitable  Habitat. Earth  is
now and for the foreseeable future the only suitable
habitat we have, and its resources are limited. Some
resources,  such  as  water,  are  renewable,  but  many,
such as fuels and minerals, are not. Other planets in
our solar system, such as Mars, cannot currently be
considered  a  solution  to  our  resource  and  popula-
tion problems. We may eventually have a colony of
people  on  Mars,  but  it  would  be  a  harsh  environ-
ment, with people living in bubbles.

When resource and other environmental data are
combined with population growth data, the conclu-
sion is clear: It is impossible, in the long run, to sup-
port exponential population growth with a ﬁnite re-
source base. Therefore, one of the primary goals of
environmental work is to ensure that we can defuse
the  population  bomb.  Some  scientists  believe  that

Fundamental Concepts of Environmental Geology

17

population  growth  will  take  care  of  itself  through
disease  and  other  catastrophes,  such  as  famine.
Other scientists are optimistic that we will ﬁnd bet-
ter  ways  to  control  the  population  of  the  world
within  the  limits  of  our  available  resources,  space,
and other environmental needs.

Good  News  on  Human  Population  Growth. It
is  not  all  bad  news  regarding  human  population
growth;  for  the  ﬁrst  time  since  the  mid-1900s,  the
rate  of  increase  in  human  population  is  decreasing.
Figure 1.7 shows that the number of people added to
the total population of Earth peaked in the late 1980s
and has generally decreased since then. This is a mile-
stone in human population growth, and it is encour-
aging.10 From an optimistic point of view, it is possi-
ble that our global population of 6 billion persons in
2000  may  not  double  again.  Although  population
growth  is  difﬁcult  to  estimate  because  of  variables
such as agriculture, sanitation, medicine, culture, and
education, it is estimated that by the year 2050 about
40 million new people will be added (today, about 74
million are added each year), and the human popula-

Census and Worldwatch Institute)

tion  will  be  about  9  billion.  Population  reduction  is
most  likely  related  to  the  education  of  women,  the
decision to marry later in life, and the availability of
modern birth control methods. Until the growth rate
is  zero,  however,  population  will  continue  to  grow.
About 20 countries, mostly in Western Europe but in-
cluding  China,  have  achieved  a  total  fertility  rate
(number of children per woman) less than 2.1, which
is the level necessary for replacement.

Concept Two: Sustainability

Sustainability is the environmental
objective.

What  is  sustainability?  Sustainability is  something
that  we  are  struggling  to  deﬁne.  One  deﬁnition  is
that sustainability is development which ensures that
future  generations  will  have  equal  access  to  the  re-
sources  that  our  planet  offers.  Sustainability  also
refers to types of development that are economically
viable, do not harm the environment, and are socially
just.9  Sustainability  is  a  long-term  concept,  some-
thing  that  happens  over  decades  or  even  over  hun-
dreds  of  years.  It  is  important  to  acknowledge  that
sustainability with respect to use of resources is pos-
sible  for  renewable  resources  such  as  air  and  water.
Sustainable development with respect to nonrenew-
able resources such as fossil fuels and minerals is pos-
sible  by,  ﬁrst,  extending  their  availability  through
conservation and recycling; and second, rather than
focusing on when a particular nonrenewable resource
is depleted, focusing on how that mineral is used and
developing substitutes for those uses.

There is little doubt that we are using living envi-
ronmental  resources,  such  as  forests,  ﬁsh,  and
wildlife,  faster  than  they  can  be  naturally  replen-
ished. We have extracted minerals, oil, and ground-
water without concern for their limits or for the need
to  recycle  them.  As  a  result,  there  are  shortages  of
some  resources.  We  must  learn  how  to  sustain  our
environmental  resources  so  that  they  continue  to
provide  beneﬁts  for  people  and  other  living  things
on the planet.

We  stated  in  Concept  One,  with  respect  to  hu-
mans and resources, that Earth is the only place to
live that is now accessible to us, and our resources are
limited. To meet future resource demands and to sus-
tain our resources, we will need large-scale recycling
of many materials. Most materials can theoretically

18

CHAPTER 1

Philosophy and Fundamental Concepts

be recycled. The challenge is to ﬁnd ways to do it that
do not harm the environment, that increase the qual-
ity  of  life,  and  that  are  economically  viable.  A  large
part of our solid and liquid waste disposal problems
could be alleviated if these wastes were reused or re-
cycled.  In  other  words,  many  wastes  that  are  now
considered  pollutants  can  be  turned  into  resources.
Land is also an important resource for people, plants,
and  animals,  as  well  as  for  manufacturing,  mining,
and energy production; transportation; deposition of
waste products; and aesthetics. Due in part to human
population  increases  that  demand  more  land  for
urban  and  agricultural  purposes,  human-induced
change to Earth is increasing at a rapid rate. A recent
study of human activity and the ability to move soil
and rock concluded that human activity (agriculture,
mining, urbanization, and so on) moves as much or
more soil and rock on an annual basis than any other
Earth process (Figure 1.8), including mountain build-
ing and river transport of sediment. These activities
and their associated visual changes to Earth (e.g., lev-
eling  hills)  suggest  that  human  activity  is  the  most
signiﬁcant  process  shaping  the  surface  of  Earth.11
We’ll discuss land use planning in Chapter 19.

Are We in an Environmental Crisis? Demands
made on diminishing resources by a growing human
population  and  the  ever-increasing  production  of
human  waste  have  produced  what  is  popularly  re-
ferred to as the environmental crisis. This crisis in
the  United  States  and  throughout  the  rest  of  the
world  is  a  result  of  overpopulation,  urbanization,
and industrialization, combined with too little ethi-
cal regard for our land and inadequate institutions
to cope with environmental stress.12 The rapid use
of resources continues to cause environmental prob-
lems on a global scale, including the following:

• Deforestation  and  accompanying  soil  erosion
and water and air pollution occur on many con-
tinents (Figure 1.9a).

• Mining of resources, such as metals, coal, and
petroleum, wherever they occur produces a va-
riety of environmental problems (Figure 1.9b).
• Development of both groundwater and surface-
water resources results in loss of and damage to
many environments on a global scale (see Case
History: The Aral Sea: The Death of a Sea).

On a positive note, we have learned a great deal
from the environmental crisis, particularly concern-

FIGURE 1.8 Mining A giant excavating machine in this mine
can move Earth materials at a rate that could bury one of the
Egyptian Pyramids in a short time. (GMVozd/iStockphoto)

ing the relationship between environmental degra-
dation and resource utilization. Innovative plans for
sustainable  development  of  resources,  including
water  and  energy,  are  being  developed  to  lessen  a
wide variety of environmental problems associated
with using resources.

Do We Need to Save Earth or Ourselves? The en-
vironmental  slogan  of  the  1990s  was  “save  our
planet.”  Is  Earth’s  very  survival  really  in  danger?  In
the long view of planetary evolution, it seems highly
likely that Earth will outlive the human race. Our Sun
is likely to last another several billion years at least,
and even if all humans became extinct in the next few
years, life would still ﬂourish on our planet. The envi-
ronmental degradation we have imposed on the land-
scape,  atmosphere,  and  waters  might  last  for  a  few
hundred or thousand years, but they would eventu-
ally be cleansed by natural processes. Therefore, our
major concern is the quality of the human environ-

ment,  which  depends  on  sustaining  our  larger  sup-
port systems, including air, water, soil, and other life.

Concept Three: Earth as a System

Understanding Earth’s systems and 
their changes is critical to solving
environmental problems.

A  system is  any  deﬁned  part  of  the  universe  that
we  select  for  study.  Examples  of  systems  are  a
planet,  a  volcano,  an  ocean  basin,  and  a  river
(Figure 1.10, page 21). Most systems contain sev-
eral component parts that mutually adjust to func-
tion  as  a  whole,  with  changes  in  one  component
bringing  about  changes  in  other  components.  For
example, the components of our global system are
water,  land,  atmosphere,  and  life.  These  compo-
nents  mutually  adjust,  helping  to  keep  the  entire
Earth system operating.

Input–Output Analysis
Input–output analysis is an important method for
analyzing  change  in  open  systems.  Figure  1.11
(page 21) identiﬁes three types of change in a pool
or  stock  of  materials;  in  each  case,  the  net  change
depends on the relative rates of the input and out-
put. Where the input into the system is equal to the
output (Figure 1.11a), a rough steady state is estab-
lished,  and  no  net  change  occurs.  The  example
shown  is  a  university  in  which  students  enter  as
freshmen and graduate 4 years later, at a constant
rate. Thus, the pool of university students remains a
constant  size.  At  the  global  scale,  our  planet  is  a
roughly steady-state system with respect to energy:
Incoming solar radiation is roughly balanced by out-
going  radiation  from  Earth.  In  the  second  type  of
change,  the  input  into  the  system  is  less  than  the
output (Figure 1.11b). Examples include the use of
resources,  such  as  fossil  fuels  or  groundwater  and

Case History
The Aral Sea: The Death of a Sea

The Aral Sea, located between 
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, formerly
part of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, was a prosperous tourist
vacation spot in 1960. Water diver-
sion for agriculture nearly eliminated
the Aral Sea in a period of only 
30 years. It is now a dying sea sur-
rounded by thousands of square kilo-
meters of salt ﬂats, and the change is
permanently damaging the economic
base of the region.

In 1960 the area of the Aral Sea

was about 67,000 km2 (around
26,200 mi2). Diversion of the two
main rivers that fed the sea has re-
sulted in a drop in surface elevation

of more than 20 m (66 ft) and loss of
about 28,000 km2 (10,800 mi2) of
surface area (Figure 1.B). Towns 
that were once ﬁshing centers on the
shore are today about 30 km (19 mi)
inland. Loss of the sea’s moderating
effect on weather is changing the re-
gional climate; the winters are now
colder and the summers warmer.
Windstorms pick up salty dust and
spread it over a vast area, damaging
the land and polluting the air.

The lesson to be learned from the

Aral Sea is how quickly environmental
damage can bring about regional
change. Environmentalists, including
geologists, worry that what people

have done to the Aral region is symp-
tomatic of what we are doing on many
fronts on a global scale.13 Today an
ambitious restoration project is
underway to save the northern,
smaller part of the lake. A low 13 km-
long dam (dike) has been constructed
across the lake just south of where
the Syr Darya ﬂows into the lake (see
Figure 1.B). With water conservation
of the river water, more water is ﬂow-
ing in the lake, and the dam keeps the
water in the northern part of the lake
bed. Water levels there are rising, and
some ﬁshing has returned. This is a
promising sign, but much more needs
to be done.

the  harvest  of  certain  plants  or  animals.  If  the
input  is  much  less  than  the  output,  the  fuel  or
water  source  may  be  completely  used  up  or  the
plants or animals may become extinct. In a system
in  which  input  exceeds  output  (Figure  1.11c),  the
stock of whatever is being measured will increase.
Examples  include  the  buildup  of  heavy  metals  in
lakes  from  industrial  pollution  or  the  pollution  of
soil and water.

How  Can  We  Evaluate  Change? By  evaluating
rates of change or the input and output of a system,
we can derive an average residence time for a par-
ticular material, such as a resource. The average resi-
dence time is a measure of the time it takes for the
total  stock  or  supply  of  the  material  to  be  cycled
through a system. To compute the average residence
time (T; assuming constant size of the system and
constant rate of transfer), we take the total size of
the  stock  (S)  and  divide  it  by  the  average  rate  of
transfer (F) through the system:

T ⫽ S/F

Input from stream 1 m3/sec

For  example,  if  a  reservoir  holds  100  million  cubic
meters  of  water,  and  both  the  average  input  from
streams entering the reservoir and the average out-
put  over  the  spillway  are  1  cubic  meter  per  second,
then the average residence time for a cubic meter of
water in the reservoir is 100 million seconds, or about
3.2 years (Figure 1.12). We can also calculate average
residence time for systems that vary in size and rates
of transfer, but the mathematics is more difﬁcult. It
is  often  possible  to  compute  a  residence  time  for  a
particular  resource  and  then  to  apply  the  informa-
tion  to  help  understand  and  solve  environmental
problems. For example, the average residence time of
water  in  rivers  is  about  2  weeks,  compared  with
thousands  of  years  for  some  groundwater.  Thus,
strategies to treat a one-time pollution event of oil
spilled in a river will be much different from those
for  removing  oil  ﬂoating  on  groundwater  that  re-
sulted  from  a  rupture  of  an  underground  pipeline.
The oil in the river is a relatively accessible, straight-
forward,  short-term  problem,  whereas  polluted
groundwater  is  a  more  difﬁcult  problem  because  it
moves slowly and has a long average residence time.

Predicting Changes 
in the Earth System
The  idea  that  “the  present  is  the  key  to  the  past,”
called  uniformitarianism,  was  popularized  by
James Hutton, referred to by some scholars as the
father of geology, in 1785. It is heralded today as a
fundamental concept of Earth sciences. As the name
suggests,  uniformitarianism  holds  that  processes
we observe today also operated in the past (e.g., ﬂow
of water in rivers, formation and movement of glac-
iers, landslides, waves on beaches, uplift of the land
from earthquakes). Uniformitarianism does not de-
mand  or  even  suggest  that  the  magnitude  (i.e.,
amount  of  energy  expended)  and  frequency  (i.e.,
how  often  a  particular  process  occurs)  of  natural
processes remain constant with time. We can infer
that,  for  as  long  as  Earth  has  had  an  atmosphere,
oceans, and continents similar to those of today, the
present processes were operating.

of human activity on the Earth system and what ef-
fect  these  changes  to  the  system  as  a  whole  may
have  on  natural  Earth  processes.  For  example,
rivers  ﬂood  regardless  of  human  activities,  but
human  activities,  such  as  paving  the  ground  in
cities,  increase  runoff  and  the  magnitude  and  fre-
quency of ﬂooding. That is, after the paving, ﬂoods
of a particular size are more frequent, and a partic-
ular rainstorm can produce a larger ﬂood than be-
fore  the  paving.  Therefore,  to  predict  the  long-
range  effects  of  ﬂooding,  we  must  be  able  to
determine how future human activities will change
the size and frequency of floods. In this case, the
present  is  the  key  to  the  future.  For  example,  when
environmental  geologists  examine  recent  landslide
deposits (Figure 1.13) in an area designated to be-
come a housing development, they must use unifor-
mitarianism  to  infer  where  there  will  be  future
landslides as well as to predict what effects urban-
ization  will  have  on  the  magnitude  and  frequency
of future landslides. We will now consider linkages
between processes.

Present  Human  Activity  Is  Part  of the  Key  to
Understanding the Future. In making inferences
about geologic events, we must consider the effects

that one action causes others in a chain of actions, is

Look

The Gaia Hypothesis

Is Earth Analogous to an 
Organism? In 1785, at a meeting
of the prestigious Royal Society of 
Edinburgh, James Hutton, the father
of geology, said he believed that 
planet Earth is a superorganism
(Figure 1.C). He compared the 
circulation of Earth’s water, with its
contained sediments and nutrients, to
the circulation of blood in an animal.
In Hutton’s metaphor, the oceans are
the heart of Earth’s global system,
and the forests are the lungs.14 Two
hundred years later, British scientist
and professor James Lovelock intro-
duced the Gaia hypothesis, reviving
the idea of a living Earth. The hy-
pothesis is named for Gaia, the Greek
goddess Mother Earth.

The Gaia hypothesis is best stated

as a series of hypotheses:
• Life significantly affects the 

planetary environment. Very few
scientists would disagree with this
concept.

• Life affects the environment for the
betterment of life. This hypothesis
is supported by some studies
showing that life on Earth plays an
important role in regulating plan-
etary climate, so that it is neither

few scientists accept this
third hypothesis. Interac-
tions and the linking of
processes that operate in
the atmosphere, on the sur-
face of Earth, and in the
oceans are probably sufﬁ-
cient to explain most of the
mechanisms by which life
affects the environment. In
contrast, humans are begin-
ning to make decisions 
concerning the global 
environment, so the idea
that humans can con-
sciously inﬂuence the 
future of Earth is not an 
extreme view. Some people
have interpreted this idea
as support for the broader
Gaia hypothesis.

the North Atlantic Ocean, North America, and the
polar ice sheets. Given this perspective of our planet, it
is not difﬁcult to conceive it as a single large system.

too hot nor too cold for life to sur-
vive. For example, it is believed
that single-cell plants ﬂoating
near the surface of the ocean par-
tially control the carbon dioxide
content of the atmosphere and
thereby global climate.14

• Life deliberately or consciously con-
trols the global environment. Very

Gaia Thinking Fosters Inter-
disciplinary Thinking. The real
value of the Gaia hypothesis is that it
has stimulated a lot of interdiscipli-
nary research to understand how our
planet works. As interpreted by most
scientists, the hypothesis does not
suggest foresight or planning on the
part of life but, rather, that natural
processes are operating.

an important principle in the prediction of changes
in the Earth system. For example, if we constructed
a dam on a river, a number of changes would occur.
Sediment  that  moved  down  the  river  to  the  ocean
before construction of the dam would be trapped in
the  reservoir.  Consequently,  beaches  would  be  de-
prived of the sediment from the river, and the result
of that deprivation might be increased coastal ero-
sion. Having less sediment on the beach may also af-
fect coastal animals that use the sand, such as sand
crabs and clams. Thus, building the dam would set

off a chain or series of effects that would change the
coastal environment and what lived there. The dam
would  also  change  the  hydrology  of  the  river  and
would block ﬁsh from migrating upstream. We will
now consider global linkages.

Earth Systems Science
Earth  systems  science is  the  study  of  the  entire
planet as a system in terms of its components (see A
Closer  Look:  The  Gaia  Hypothesis).  It  asks  how

Fundamental Concepts of Environmental Geology

25

component  systems  (i.e.,  subsystems  of  the  Earth
system)—such as the atmosphere (air), hydrosphere
(water),  biosphere  (life),  and  lithosphere  (rocks)—
are linked and have formed, evolved, and been main-
tained;  how  these  components  function;  and  how
they  will  continue  to  evolve  over  periods  ranging
from  a  decade  to  a  century  and  longer.15 Because
these systems are linked, it is also important to un-
derstand  and  be  able  to  predict  the  impacts  of  a
change  in  one  component  on  the  others.  The  chal-
lenge is to learn to predict changes that are likely to
be important to society and then to develop manage-
ment strategies to minimize adverse environmental
impacts.  For  example,  the  study  of  atmospheric
chemistry  suggests  that  our  atmosphere  has
changed over millennia. Trace gases such as carbon
dioxide  have  increased  by  about  100  percent  since
1850. Chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs), used as refriger-
ants and aerosol-can propellants, released at the sur-
face  have  migrated  to  the  stratosphere,  where  they
react with energy from the Sun, causing destruction
of the ozone layer that protects Earth from harmful
ultraviolet radiation. The important topics of global
change and Earth systems science will be discussed
in Chapter 18, following topics such as Earth materi-
als, natural hazards, and energy resources.

Concept Four: Hazardous 
Earth Processes

There have always been Earth processes
that are hazardous to people. These
natural hazards must be recognized and
avoided when possible, and their threat
to human life and property must be
minimized.

We humans, like all other animals, have to contend
with natural processes, such as storms, ﬂoods, earth-
quakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions, that peri-
odically damage property and kill us. During the past
20 years, natural hazards on Earth have killed several
million  people.  The  annual  loss  has  been  about
150,000 people, with ﬁnancial damages of about $20
billion.

Natural  Hazards  That  Produce  Disasters 
Are  Becoming  Superdisasters  Called  Cata-
strophes. Early  in  human  history,  our  struggle
with natural Earth processes was mostly a day-to-

day  experience.  Our  numbers  were  neither  great
nor  concentrated,  so  losses  from  hazardous  Earth
processes were not signiﬁcant. As people learned to
produce and maintain a larger and, in most years,
more  abundant  food  supply,  the  population  in-
creased and became more concentrated locally. The
concentration of population and resources also in-
creased  the  impact  that  periodic  earthquakes,
ﬂoods, and other natural disasters had on humans.
This  trend  has  continued,  so  that  many  people
today  live  in  areas  likely  to  be  damaged  by  haz-
ardous  Earth  processes  or  susceptible  to  the  ad-
verse impact of such processes in adjacent areas. An
emerging  principle  concerning  natural  hazards  is
that, as a result of human activity (e.g., population
increase and changing the land through agriculture,
logging, mining, urbanization), what were formerly
disasters  are  becoming  catastrophes.  For  example:

• Human  population  increase  has  forced  more
people  to  live  in  hazardous  areas,  such  as  in
ﬂoodplains, on steep slopes (where landslides
are more likely), and near volcanoes.

• Land-use transformations, including urbaniza-
tion  and  deforestation,  increase  runoff  and
ﬂood  hazard  and  may  weaken  slopes,  making
landslides more likely.

• Burning vast amounts of oil, gas, and coal has
increased the concentration of carbon dioxide
in  the  atmosphere,  contributing  to  warming
the atmosphere and oceans. As a result, more
energy  is  fed  into  hurricanes.  The  number  of
hurricanes has not increased, but the intensity
and size of the storms have increased.

We  can  recognize  many  natural  processes  and
predict their effects by considering climatic, biolog-
ical, and geologic conditions. After Earth scientists
have  identiﬁed  potentially  hazardous  processes,
they  have  the  obligation  to  make  the  information
available to planners and decision makers who can
then  consider  ways  of  avoiding  or  minimizing  the
threat to human life or property. Put concisely, this
process  consists  of  assessing  the  risk  of  a  certain
hazard  in  a  given  area  and  basing  planning  deci-
sions on that risk assessment. Public perception of
hazards  also  plays  a  role  in  the  determination  of
risk  from  a  hazard.  For  example,  although  they
probably understand that the earthquake hazard in
southern California is real, the residents who have
never  experienced  an  earthquake  ﬁrsthand  may

26

CHAPTER 1

Philosophy and Fundamental Concepts

have  less  appreciation  for  the  seriousness  of  the
risk  of  loss  of  property  and  life  than  do  persons
who have experienced an earthquake.

Concept Five: Scientiﬁc Knowledge
and Values

The results of scientiﬁc inquiry to solve a
particular environmental problem often
provide a series of potential solutions
consistent with the scientiﬁc ﬁndings. The
chosen solution is a reﬂection of our value
system.

What Is Science? To understand our discussion of
scientiﬁc  knowledge  and  values,  we  need  to  ﬁrst
have  an  appreciation  for  the  conventions  of  scien-
tiﬁc inquiry. Most scientists are motivated by a basic
curiosity about how things work. Geologists are ex-
cited  by  the  thrill  of  discovering  something  previ-
ously unknown about how the world works. These
discoveries  drive  them  to  continue  their  work.
Given that we know little about internal and exter-
nal  processes  that  form  and  maintain  our  world,
how do we go about studying it? The creativity and
insight  that  may  result  from  scientiﬁc  break-
throughs  often  begin  with  asking  questions  perti-
nent  to  some  problem  of  interest  to  the  investiga-
tors.  If  little  is  known  about  the  topic  or  process
being studied, they will ﬁrst try to conceptually un-
derstand what is going on by making careful obser-
vations in the ﬁeld or, perhaps, in a laboratory. On
the basis of his or her observations, a scientist may
then  develop  a  question  or  a  series  of  questions
about  those  observations.  Next,  the  investigator
will suggest an answer or several possible answers to
the question. The possible answer is a hypothesis to
be tested. The best hypotheses can be tested by de-
signing an experiment that involves data collection,
organization,  and  analysis.  After  collection  and
analysis of the data, the scientist interprets the data
and draws a conclusion. The conclusion is then com-
pared with the hypothesis, and the hypothesis may
be rejected or tentatively accepted. Often, a series of
questions or multiple hypotheses are developed and
tested. If all hypotheses suggested to answer a par-
ticular question are rejected, then a new set of hy-
potheses must be developed. This method is some-
times  referred  to  as  the  scientiﬁc  method.  The

steps of the scientiﬁc method are shown in Figure
1.14.  The  ﬁrst  step  of  the  scientiﬁc  method  is  the
formation of a question—in this case, “Where does
beach sand come from?” In order to explore this ques-
tion, the scientist spends some time at the beach. She
notices some small streams that ﬂow into the ocean;
she knows that the streams originate in the nearby
mountains.  She  then  reﬁnes  her  question  to  ask
speciﬁcally, “Does beach sand come from the moun-
tains to the beach by way of streams?” This question
is the basis for the scientist’s hypothesis: Beach sand
originates in the mountains. To test this hypothesis,
she collects some sand from the beach and from the
streams and some rock samples from the mountains.
She then compares their mineral content. She ﬁnds
that  the  mineral  content  of  all  three  is  roughly  the
same.  She  draws  a  conclusion  that  the  beach  sand
does come from the mountains, and, so, accepts her
hypothesis. If her hypothesis had proved to be wrong,
she would have had to formulate a new hypothesis. In
complex geologic problems, multiple hypotheses may
be  formulated  and  each  one  tested.  This  is  the
method of multiple working hypotheses. If a hypoth-
esis withstands the testing of a sufﬁcient number of
experiments, it may be accepted as a theory. A theory
is  a  strong  scientiﬁc  statement  that  the  hypothesis
supporting the theory is likely to be true but has not
been  proved  conclusively.  New  evidence  often  dis-
proves  existing  hypotheses  or  scientiﬁc  theory;  ab-
solute proof of scientiﬁc theory is not possible. Thus,
much of the work of science is to develop and test hy-
potheses, striving to reject current hypotheses and to
develop better ones.

Laboratory  studies  and  ﬁeldwork  are  commonly
used in partnership to test hypotheses, and geologists
often  begin  their  observations  in  the  ﬁeld  or  in  the
laboratory by taking careful notes. For example, a ge-
ologist in the ﬁeld may create a geologic map, carefully
noting  and  describing  the  distribution  of  different
Earth materials. The map can be completed in the lab-
oratory, where the collected material can be analyzed.
An  important  aspect  of  science  not  often  dis-
cussed  in  detail  is  concerned  with  the  roles  of
knowledge, imagination, and creative critical think-
ing. If we have prepared our mind to do science by
studying  mathematics,  physics,  chemistry,  hydrol-
ogy, and geology, we may be more able to link basic
science  to  a  particular  problem,  such  as  why  and
how erosion occurs. It is helpful to be able to imag-
ine  the  processes  occurring  that  play  a  role  in  a

The important variable that distinguishes geology
from most of the other sciences is the consideration
of time (see the geologic time scale in Table 1.2). Ge-
ologists’ interest in Earth history over time periods

that are nearly incomprehensible to most people nat-
urally leads to some interesting questions:

• How fast are mountains uplifted and formed?
• How fast do processes of erosion reduce the av-

erage elevation of the land?

Knowledge, Imagination, and Critical Thinking

Knowledge and Imagination.
In science, imagination is the ability
to form a mental image or idea of a
process that has not previously been
perceived. This process is linked to
creativity. The process might lead to
performing a thought experiment
that can be expressed in mathemat-
ics (i.e., the language of science). 
Albert Einstein once stated that the
most important aspect of science is
imagination. He justiﬁed this state-
ment with the observation that
human knowledge is limited to what
we have learned and been taught,
while imagination has no limits.
Knowledge is taught in schools from
the very beginning through the en-
tire education process and is critical
as basic input to feed our imagina-
tion. Knowledge is what is known,
but the remainder of the natural
world is something like a black box
about which little is known. We make
observations of the natural world in
the ﬁeld and record (i.e., take data) on
what processes we believe may be
occurring. However, in order to link
observation and process, we must
ﬁrst be able to imagine what is possi-
bly happening. For example, I recent-
ly made a research trip to Oregon to
study a coastal river that has been
heavily affected by timber harvesting.
The river ﬂows over bedrock that is a
mixture of hard, volcanic rock and
softer sediments. One of the interest-
ing areas of research in rivers is to
better understand how bedrock con-
trols the morphology of river chan-
nels and how rivers incise channels
into bedrock. At one particular pool
that was about 10 m deep, the up-
stream head of the pool (i.e., the part
that is under water at even low

summer ﬂow) is a nearly vertical rock
wall. The rock juts up from the bot-
tom of the pool to less than 1 m from
the surface. Of particular importance
to the river and the ﬁsheries resource,
which includes salmon, is how these
very large pools are formed. We be-
lieve they result from scour (i.e., the
removal and transport of material
from the bed of the river) of rock and
sediment, but processes in bedrock
rivers are poorly understood.

Immediately upstream from the

rock wall and pool is a gravel bar
composed of very large particles
(about the size of baseballs to basket-
balls). We would like to know why the
gravel doesn’t simply ﬁll the pool and
thereby stop the river from maintain-
ing the pool. One of the ways of ap-
proaching this problem is to imagine
that you are a particle, say the size of
a baseball, and are moving through
the river system and are temporarily
stored on the gravel bar upstream of
the pool. During high-ﬂow events,
the particle, along with many others,
is transported by the ﬂowing water
from the bar. You might expect the
large particles would end up in the 10
m-deep pool. If this happened, the
pool would become a deposition site
for the particles and would become
ﬁlled. The pool has been nearly gravel
free and in the same location for
many years, and it is a well-known
salmon-resting pool. In trying to
imagine what happens, we must
think about the forces that move the
particles along the bed of the river
and why particles are not trapped
within the deep pool. The pool is too
large and deep for making detailed
current ﬂow measurements and
gravel transport measurements at

high ﬂow. We can imagine that there
must be processes capable of trans-
porting coarse material through the
pool. After we have come to the real-
ization that we believe that the
coarse particles move from bar to bar
and do not become trapped in pools,
we can devise experiments and
gather data. For example, we can
place small tags within the rock parti-
cles and use electronic monitoring to
track them as they move through the
pool. We could also make topo-
graphic measurements at low ﬂow
and calculate the forces on the parti-
cles to provide insight into what the
water is doing during the ﬂood
stages. The point is, we would not
know how to approach this problem
were we not able to imagine what is
likely to be happening. Observation
and calculation would be a step (or
level of investigation) in the research
to understand how the deep pool is
formed and maintained. There is a se-
ries of levels from qualitative and de-
scriptive to quantitative analysis, as
deﬁned below.

Levels of Investigation. When
we approach critical scientiﬁc think-
ing (i.e., disciplined thinking using in-
tellectual standards to help determine
the meaning and signiﬁcance of an
idea or argument) and use our imagi-
nation and work to solve problems in
the natural world, there are several
possible levels of investigation:
• Describe the problem and what
we think is happening physically
in a nonquantitative way. That is,
try to describe what is happening
in simple terms and ask questions
that are hypotheses that may be
tested.

Fundamental Concepts of Environmental Geology

29

• Make measurements and gather
data on the processes and materi-
als we are studying. We need to be
sure that measurements will ex-
haustively resolve the questions
we are posing. This process could
lead to formation of a hypothesis
to be tested. The second level,
therefore, is the beginning of the
quantiﬁcation process. Quantify-
ing problems and analyzing data
provides a deeper level of under-
standing. Some scientists have
stated that, if we are not able to
quantify a problem and analyze
data associated with it, we do not
really understand the problem or
process being studied. I would dis-
agree with that statement; how-
ever, quantiﬁcation is necessary to
fully understand a problem.

• Monitor our studies through time
as much as possible. In the Earth
sciences, this is particularly impor-
tant. When we qualitatively under-
stand what we think is happening
and have analyzed data, we inte-
grate our results through time,
perhaps to develop a conceptual
evolutionary model of how the
system under investigation works.

The next step is applying critical
thinking. Actually, critical thinking 
is important in all phases of an 
investigation.

Thinking Critically. Critical
thinking in the sciences, as mentioned
earlier, is disciplined thinking, with the
objective of determining the meaning
and signiﬁcance of an idea or argu-
ment. In order to help think critically, it
is useful to consider some intellectual
standards to assist us in our thought
processes. Some standards can help
us with effective communication, 
clarity, and commitment in acquiring
useful skills and knowledge:16
• Signiﬁcance:

Is the problem we

are addressing an important one?

Why? For our pool, it is known that
salmon need resting places where
they can hold during their migra-
tion up the river to spawn.

• Logic: Do our arguments make
sense and follow from the evi-
dence we have collected? Can we
show qualitatively and quantita-
tively that the processes we have
imagined to produce a pool or
maintain it will do the job?

• Relevance: How well is our argu-
ment connected to the problem
we are investigating? If the prob-
lem is pool formation and mainte-
nance, does our argument address
that speciﬁcally?

• Breadth: Have we considered

other points of view and looked at
the problem at hand from differ-
ent perspectives? For example,
have we separated (in our mind)
the question of the gravel not ac-
cumulating in the pool from the
issue of how the pool is formed?
• Precision: Do we understand the

degree of exactness to which
something is measured? If we are
measuring a velocity or distance,
what are the errors of measure-
ment? Based on that, can we make
more speciﬁc measurements or be
more exact in our analysis? Is the
precision of the measurement ad-
equate for answering the original
question?

• Clarity: Have we stated our argu-
ments clearly? If we are not clear
in our presentation, we will not be
able to tell if our argument is rele-
vant or accurate.

• Fairness: Have we considered

other points of view?

Research involves a lot of reading
and study. It may be said that every-
thing is rediscovered each generation,
but each generation of scientists
brings new thinking and tools (e.g.,
better instruments of measurement

and computer models). For example,
G. K. Gilbert, one of the most famous
and creative American Earth 
Scientists, stated qualitatively in the
early 1800s how pools might scour at
high ﬂow. Field tools (i.e., adequate
current meters) for measurement
were not yet generally available to
quantify his visual observations and
qualitative analysis.

Creativity and imagination are 

important in all aspects of scientiﬁc
work. If we are to understand the 
unknown and move science forward,
we ﬁrst must be able to imagine
processes and problems with poten-
tial avenues to explore them. From
this, we develop hypotheses, collect
data, and apply our knowledge to
better understand how our world
works. Unfortunately, teaching cre-
ativity and imagination is not possi-
ble in any detail. The best advice I
can offer is to provide the time you
need to think about your work. We
often get so involved in the details
that we may lose sight of the big pic-
ture and not allow our minds to work
on a problem and apply imagination.
I cannot overemphasize the impor-
tance of imagination. The best scien-
tists form their arguments and dis-
cussion by starting with something
like: “Imagine that you are a particle
of sediment that has been loosened
by rock weathering in a landslide
and moved into a stream channel.
Further imagine the processes that
will transport you (the particle) to-
ward the ocean, where deposition
may take place or processes may
transport you further along the coast
to enter you into other processes
that are operating.” All this may
sound rather vague, and, unfortu-
nately, this is true. For example, once
I was sitting on the bank of a river
that was dry at the time, looking 
at a pool that was scoured to hard
compacted gravel (essentially rock).
Just downstream was abundant 

30

CHAPTER 1

Philosophy and Fundamental Concepts

deposition of coarse gravel, and
coarse gravel was also found above
the pool. I sat there for hours, trying
to imagine how this might occur. It
came to me that the gravel, when it’s
being transported, must move
through the pool quickly to be de-
posited on the next gravel bar down-
stream. This led to the hypothesis
that the tractive forces that move
gravel must be greater in the pool at
high ﬂow, when sediment is being
transported, than on the gravel bars
above and below the pool. This led
me to the hypothesis that the
processes operating at low ﬂow,
when the pool was essentially a
small pond, were very different from
those at high ﬂow when sediment
was being transported. I stated this
in the form of a hypothesis, namely
that tractive forces in pools at high

ﬂow exceed those on gravel bars 
upstream and downstream. I then
tested this hypothesis in the small
stream by making measurements of
velocity of ﬂow over a variety of ﬂow
conditions.

Sometimes, imagination and in-

sight come directly in the form of an
event that you witness. In North
Carolina, over 30 years ago, I was
studying a small stream called Mal-
lard Creek. I was looking for pools to
study, as I had done in other loca-
tions, but there was so much large,
woody debris that the pools that I
was expecting to ﬁnd were simply
not there. I thought, “What kind of a
stream is this? What is all this woody
debris about? I can’t even ﬁnd the
pools I came here to study.” About
that time, I heard a large creak and
crash and splash about 100 m away

and observed a very large hardwood
tree falling into the channel. A little
light went off in my head, and I real-
ized that this is natural! Large woody
debris in forests and streams has a
profound effect on channel form and
process. That observation and the in-
sight from it, along with work of
other scientists, led to a new ﬁeld
that, today, we call forest geomor-
phology. Thousands of papers since
the 1970s have been written about
how large, woody debris inﬂuences
channel form and process, as well as
its importance for ﬁsh habitat. The
important point is that in our work
and research to understand how our
world works, we have to be open to
new ideas and use our imagination
and critical thinking and hope that
we will break new ground—that is,
make new discoveries.

• How  fast  do  rivers  erode  canyons  to  produce
scenic valleys such as Yosemite Valley and the
Grand Canyon (Figure 1.15)?

• How  fast  do  ﬂoodwaters,  glaciers,  and  lava

ﬂows move?

As shown in Table 1.4 (page 32), rates of geologic
processes  vary  from  a  fraction  of  a  millimeter  per
year  to  several  kilometers  per  second.  The  fastest
rates are more than a trillion times the slowest. The
most rapid rates, a few kilometers per second, are for
events with durations of a few seconds. For example,
uplift of 1 m (3.3 ft) during an earthquake may seem
like a lot, but when averaged over 1,000 years (the
time between earthquakes), it is a long-term rate of
1  mm  per  year  (0.039  in.  per  year),  a  typical  uplift
rate in forming mountains. Of particular importance
to  environmental  geology  is  that  human  activities
may accelerate the rates of some processes. For ex-
ample, timber harvesting and urban construction re-
move  vegetation,  exposing  soils  and  increasing  the
rate of erosion. Conversely, the practice of sound soil
conservation may reduce rates.

Humans  evolved  during  the  Pleistocene  epoch
(the past 1.65 million years), which is a very small
percentage of the age of Earth. To help you concep-
tualize  the  geologic  time  scale,  Figure  1.16  (page

33) illustrates  all  of  geologic  time  as  analogous  to
yards  on  a  football  ﬁeld.  Think  back  to  your  high
school  days,  when  your  star  kick-off  return  player
took  it  deep  into  your  end  zone.  Assume  that  the
100-yard ﬁeld represents the age of Earth (4.6 bil-
lion  years),  making  each  yard  equal  to  45  million
years. As your star zigs and zags and reaches the 50-
yard line, the crowd cheers. But in Earth history he
has traveled only 2,250 million years and is still in a
primitive oxygen-deﬁcient environment. At the op-
ponent’s 45 yard line, free oxygen in the atmosphere
begins to support life. As our runner crosses the 12
yard line, the Precambrian period comes to an end,
and life becomes much more diversiﬁed. At less than
half  a  yard  from  the  goal  line,  our  star  runner
reaches the beginning of the Pleistocene, the most
recent  2.6  million  years  of  Earth  history,  when 
humans evolved. As he leaps over the 1 inch line and
in for the touchdown, the corresponding period in
Earth history is 100,000 years ago, and modern hu-
mans were living in Europe. Another way to visual-
ize geologic time is to imagine that 1 calendar year is
equal to the age of Earth, 4.6 billion years. In this
case, Earth formed on January 1; the ﬁrst oxygen in
the atmosphere did not occur until July; and mam-
mals did not make their appearance until December
18. The ﬁrst human being arrived on the scene on

CHAPTER 1

Philosophy and Fundamental Concepts

TABLE 1.4 Some Typical Rates of Geologic Processes

• Uplift that produces mountains. Generally 0.5 to 2 mm per year (about 0.02 to 0.08 in. per year). Can be

as great as 10 mm per year (about 0.39 in. per year). It takes (with no erosion) 1.5 million to 6 million
years to produce mountains with elevations of 3 km (around 1.9 mi).

• Erosion of the land. Generally 0.01 to 1 mm per year (about 0.004 to 0.039 in. per year). It takes (with no

uplift) 3 million to 300 million years to erode a landscape by 3 km (about 1.9 mi). Erosion rate may be
signiﬁcantly increased by human activity, such as timber harvesting or agricultural activities that increase
the amount of water that runs off the land, causing erosion. Rates of uplift generally exceed rates of
erosion, explaining why land above sea level persists.

• Incision of rivers into bedrock, producing canyons such as the Grand Canyon in Arizona. Incision is

different from erosion, which is the material removed over a region. Rates are generally 0.005 to 10 mm
per year (about 0.0002 to 0.39 in. per year). Therefore, to produce a canyon 3 km (around 1.9 mi) deep
would take 300 thousand to 600 million years. The rate of incision may be increased several times by
human activities, such as building dams, because increased downcutting of the river channel occurs
directly below a dam.

• Movement of soil and rock downslope by creeping in response to the pull of gravity. Rate is generally

0.5 to 1.2 mm per year (about 0.02 to 0.05 in. per year).

• Coastal erosion by waves. Generally 0.25 to 1.0 m per year (0.82 to 3.28 ft per year). Thus, to provide
100 years’ protection from erosion, a structure should be built about 25 to 100 m (about 82 to 328 ft)
back from the cliff edge.

• Glacier movement. Generally a few meters per year to a few meters per day.
• Lava ﬂows. Depends on the type of lava and slope. From a few meters per day to several meters per second.
• River ﬂow in ﬂoods. Generally a few meters per second.
• Debris avalanche, or ﬂow of saturated earth, soil, and rocks downslope. Can be greater than 100 km

(62 mi) per hour.

• Earthquake rupture. Several kilometers per second.

only 48 seconds before midnight on December 31!
In answering environmental geology questions, we
are often interested in the latest Pleistocene (the past
18,000 years), but we are most interested in the past
few thousand or few hundred years of the Holocene
epoch, which started approximately 10,000 years ago
(see Appendix D). Thus, in geologic study, geologists
often  design  hypotheses  to  answer  questions  inte-
grated through time. For example, we might want to
test the hypothesis that burning fossil fuels, such as
coal and oil, which we know releases carbon dioxide
into  the  atmosphere,  is  causing  global  warming  by
trapping heat in the lower atmosphere. We term this
phenomenon the greenhouse effect, which is discussed
in detail in Chapter 18. One way to test this hypothe-
sis would be to show that before the Industrial Revo-
lution,  when  we  started  burning  a  lot  of  coal  and,

later, oil to power the new machinery of the time pe-
riod,  the  mean  global  temperature  was  signiﬁcantly
lower than it is now. We would be particularly inter-
ested in the last few hundred to few thousand years
before  temperature  measurements  were  recorded  at
various spots around the planet as they are today. To
test the hypothesis that global warming is occurring,
the investigator could examine prehistoric Earth ma-
terials  that  might  provide  indicators  of  global  tem-
perature.  This  examination  might  involve  studying
glacial  ice  or  sediments  from  the  bottoms  of  the
oceans or lakes to estimate past levels of carbon diox-
ide  in  the  atmosphere.  Properly  completed,  studies
can provide conclusions that enable us to accept or re-
ject the hypothesis that global warming is occurring.
Our discussion about what science is emphasizes
that  science  is  a  process.  As  such,  it  is  a  way  of
knowing  that  constitutes  a  current  set  of  beliefs

based  on  the  application  of  the  scientiﬁc  method.
Science is not the only way a set of beliefs are estab-
lished.  Some  beliefs  are  based  on  faith,  but  these,
while valid, shouldn’t be confused with science. The
famous Roman philosopher Cicero once concluded
that  divine  providence,  or  as  we  call  it  now,
intelligent design, was responsible for the organiza-
tion  of  nature  and  harmony  that  maintained  the 
environment  for  all  people.  As  modern  science
emerged with the process of science, other explana-
tions  emerged.  This  has  included  explanations  for
biological  evolution  by  biologists,  the  understand-
ing of space and time by physicists, and the expla-
nation  that  continents  and  ocean  basins  form
through plate tectonics by geologists.

Culture and Environmental
Awareness
Environmental awareness involves the entire way of
life that we have transmitted from one generation to
another. To uncover the roots of our present condi-
tion, we must look to the past to see how our culture
and  our  political,  economic,  ethical,  religious,  and

An  ethical  approach  to  maintaining  the  envi-
ronment  is  the  most  recent  development  in  the
long history of human ethical evolution. A change
in  the  concept  of  property  rights  has  provided  a
fundamental transformation in our ethical evolu-
tion.  In  earlier  times,  human  beings  were  often
held  as  property,  and  their  masters  had  the  un-
questioned  right  to  dispose  of  them  as  they
pleased. Slaveholding societies certainly had codes
of ethics, but these codes did not include the idea
that  people  cannot  be  property.  Similarly,  until
very  recently,  few  people  in  the  industrialized
world  questioned  the  right  of  landowners  to  dis-
pose of land as they please. Only within this cen-
tury has the relationship between civilization and
its physical environment begun to emerge as a re-
lationship involving ethical considerations.

Environmental  (including  ecological  and  land)
ethics involves limitations on social as well as indi-
vidual  freedom  of  action  in  the  struggle  for  exis-
tence in our stressed environment. A land ethic as-
sumes  that  we  are  responsible  not  only  to  other
individuals and society but also to the total environ-
ment,  the  larger  community  consisting  of  plants,
animals, soil, rocks, atmosphere, and water. Accord-
ing to this ethic, we are the land’s citizens and pro-
tectors, not its conquerors. This role change requires
us to revere, love, and protect our land rather than
allow  economics  to  determine  land  use.17 The  cre-
ation of national parks and forests is an example of
protective action based on a land ethic. Yellowstone
National  Park  in  Wyoming  and  Montana  was  the
ﬁrst national park in the United States, established
in  March  1872.  Later,  the  United  States  created
other  national  parks,  monuments,  and  forests  to
preserve  some  of  the  country’s  most  valued  aes-
thetic  resources.  Trees,  plants,  animals,  and  rocks
are protected within the bounds of a national park
or  forest.  In  addition,  rivers  ﬂow  free  and  clean,
lakes are not overﬁshed or polluted, and mineral re-
sources are protected. Finally, the ethic that led to
the protection of such lands allows us the privilege
of enjoying these natural areas and ensures that fu-
ture generations will have the same opportunity.

We will now change focus to discuss why solving
environmental problems tends to be difﬁcult and in-
troduce  the  emerging  environmental  policy  tool
known as the precautionary principle.

Easter Island: A Complex Problem to Understand

Easter Island, at 140 km2, is a small, 
triangular-shaped, volcanic island 
located several thousand kilometers
west of South America, with a subtrop-
ical climate (Figure 1.Da). Polynesian
people ﬁrst reached the island ap-
proximately 1,500 years ago. When
the Polynesians ﬁrst arrived, they
were greeted by a green island cov-
ered with forest, including large palm
trees. By the sixteenth century, 15,000
to 30,000 people were living there.
They had established a complex soci-
ety spread among small villages, and
they raised crops and chickens to sup-
plement the ﬁsh, marine mammals,
and seabirds that sustained their diet.
For religious reasons, they carved
massive statues (called moai) from
volcanic rock (Figure 1.D). The statues
have the form of a human torso with
a stone headdress. Most are about 
7 m high (21 ft), but some are higher
than 20 m. The statues were moved
into place at various locations on the
island using ropes, with tree trunks 
as rollers.

When Europeans reached Easter 

Island in the seventeenth century, only
about 2,000 people were living on the
island. The main symbols of the once-
vibrant civilization were the statues,
most of which had been toppled and
damaged. No trees were growing on
the island, and the people were living
in a degraded environment.

Why Did the Society Collapse?
Evidently, Easter Island society col-
lapsed in just a few decades, proba-
bly as a result of degradation of the
island’s limited resource base. As the
human population of the island in-
creased, more and more land was
cleared for agriculture, and the re-

maining trees were used for fuel and
for moving the statues into place.
Previously, the soils had been pro-
tected beneath the forest cover and
had held water in the subtropical en-
vironment. Soil nutrients had proba-
bly been supplied by dust from
thousands of kilometers away that
reached the island on the winds.
Once the forest was cleared, the soils
eroded, and the agricultural base of
the society was diminished. Loss of
the forest also resulted in loss of for-
est products necessary for building
homes and boats, and, as a result,
the people were forced to live in
caves. Without boats, they could 
no longer rely on ﬁsh as a source 
of protein. As population pressure 
increased, wars between villages 
became common, as did slavery and
even cannibalism, in attempts to sur-
vive in an environment depleted of
its resource base.18

Lessons Learned. The story of
Easter Island is a dark one that
vividly points to what can happen
when an isolated area is deprived 
of its resources through human ac-
tivity: Limited resources cannot
support an ever-growing human
population.

The people of Easter Island de-

pleted their resources, because they
failed to understand and recognize a
number of factors. Easter Island has a
naturally fragile environment18–22
compared to many other islands the
Polynesians colonized:
• The island is small and very iso-
lated. The inhabitants couldn’t 

expect help in hard times from
neighboring islands.

• Volcanic soils were originally fer-
tile, but agricultural erosion was a
problem, and soil-forming
processes on the island were slow
compared to those on more tropi-
cal islands. Nutrient input to soils
from atmospheric dust from Asia
was not signiﬁcant.

• The island’s three volcanoes (see
Figure 1.Da) are not active, so no
fresh volcanic ash added nutrients
to the soils. The topography is low,
with gentle slopes. Steep high
mountains generate clouds, rain,
and runoff that nourish lowlands.

• With a subtropical climate with
annual rainfall of 80 cm (50 in.),
there was sufﬁcient rainfall, but
the water quickly inﬁltrated
through the soil into porous vol-
canic rock.

• There are no coral reefs near

Easter Island to provide abundant
marine resources.
There is fear today that our

planet, an isolated island in space,
may be reaching the same threshold
faced by the people of Easter Island
in the sixteenth century. In the
twenty-ﬁrst century, we are facing
limitations of our resources in a vari-
ety of areas, including soils, freshwa-
ter, forests, rangelands, and ocean
ﬁsheries. The primary question from
both an environmental perspective
and for the history of humans on
Earth is: Will we recognize the limits
of Earth’s resources before it is too
late to avoid the collapse of human

society on a global scale? Today,
there are no more frontiers on Earth,
and we have a nearly fully integrated
global economy. With our modern
technology, we have the ability to
extract resources and transform our
environment at rates much faster
than any people before us. The
major lesson from Easter Island is
clear: Develop a sustainable global
economy that ensures the survival
of our resource base and other 
living things on Earth or suffer 
the consequences.18

Some aspects of the history of

Easter Island have recently been chal-
lenged as being only part of the
story. Deforestation certainly played
a role in the loss of the trees, and rats
that arrived with the Polynesians
were evidently responsible for eating
seeds of the palm trees, not allowing
regeneration. The alternative expla-
nation is that the Polynesian people
on Easter Island at the time of Euro-
pean contact in 1722 numbered
about 3,000 persons. This population
may have been close to the maxi-
mum reached in about the year 1350.
Following contact, introduced dis-
eases and enslavement resulted in re-
duction of the population to about
100 by the late 1870s.19,22 As more of
the story of Easter Island emerges
from scientiﬁc and social studies, the
effects of human resource exploita-
tion, invasive rats, and European con-
tact will become clearer. The complex
processes that led to the collapse will
hopefully lead to a better under-
standing of how we can sustain our
global human culture.

Why Is Solving Environmental
Problems So Difﬁcult?
Many  environmental  problems  tend  to  be  complex
and multifaceted. They may involve issues related to
physical,  biological,  and  human  processes  (see  A
Closer Look: Easter Island: A Complex Problem to Un-
derstand).  Some  of  the  problems  are  highly  charged

from  an  emotional  standpoint,  and  potential  solu-
tions are often vigorously debated.

Solving environmental problems may be difﬁcult

for three main reasons:

• Expediential  growth  is  often  encountered.
Expediential growth means that the amount
of change may be happening quickly, whether

increase  or  a 

• There  are  often  lag  times  between  when  a
change  occurs  and  when  it  is  recognized  as  a
problem. If the lag time is long, it may be very
difﬁcult to even recognize a particular problem.
• An environmental problem involves the possi-
bility  of  irreversible  change.  If  a  species  be-
comes extinct, it is gone forever.

Environmental policy links to environmental eco-
nomics are in their infancy. That is, the policy frame-
work to solve environmental problems is a relatively
new  arena.  We  are  developing  policies  such  as  the
precautionary principle and ﬁnding ways to evaluate
the economics of gains and losses from environmen-
tal  change.  For  example,  how  do  you  put  a  dollar
amount on aesthetics or living in a quality environ-
ment? Such an analysis often comes down to an exer-
cise  in  values  clariﬁcation.  Science  can  provide  a
number  of  potential  solutions  to  problems,  but
which solution we pick depends upon our values.

Precautionary Principle
What  Is  the  Precautionary  Principle? Science
has  the  role  of  trying  to  understand  physical  and
biological  processes  associated  with  environmental
problems, such as global warming, exposure to toxic
materials, and depletion of resources, among others.
However, all science is preliminary, and it is difﬁcult to
prove  relationships  between  physical  and  biological
processes  and  link  them  to  human  processes.  Partly
for this reason, in 1992, the Rio Earth Summit on sus-
tainable  development  supported  the  precautionary
principle. The idea behind the principle is that when
there exists a potentially serious environmental prob-
lem, scientiﬁc certainty is not required to take a pre-
cautionary approach. In other words, it is better to be
safe than sorry. The precautionary principle thus con-
tributes to the critical thinking on a variety of envi-
ronmental concerns, such as manufacture and use of
toxic chemicals or burning of huge amounts of coal as
oil becomes scarcer. It is considered one of the most
inﬂuential ideas for obtaining an intellectual, environ-
mentally  just  policy  framework  for  environmental
problems.23

The  precautionary  principle  recognizes  that  sci-
entiﬁc proof is not possible in most instances, and
management practices are needed to reduce or elim-
inate  environmental  problems  believed  to  result
from  human  activities.  In  other  words,  in  spite  of

the fact that full scientiﬁc certainty is not available,
we should still take cost-effective action to solve en-
vironmental problems.

The Precautionary Principle May Be Difficult
to  Apply. One  of  the  difﬁculties  in  applying  the
precautionary  principle  is  the  decision  concerning
how  much  scientiﬁc  evidence  is  needed  before  ac-
tion on a particular problem should be taken. This is
a  signiﬁcant  and  often  controversial  question.  An
issue being considered has to have some preliminary
data and conclusions but awaits more scientiﬁc data
and  analysis.  For  example,  when  considering  envi-
ronmental  health  issues  related  to  burning  coal,
there may be an abundance of scientiﬁc data about
air, water, and land pollution, but with gaps, incon-
sistencies, and other scientiﬁc uncertainties. Those
in favor of continuing or increasing the use of coal
may argue that there is not sufﬁcient proof to war-
rant  restricting  its  use.  Others  would  argue  that
absolute proof of safety is necessary before a big in-
crease in burning of coal is allowed. The precaution-
ary principle, applied to this case, would be that lack
of full scientiﬁc certainty concerning the use of coal
should  not  be  used  as  a  reason  for  not  taking,  or
postponing,  cost-effective  measures  to  reduce  or
prevent  environmental  degradation  or  heath  prob-
lems. This raises the question of what constitutes a
cost-effective  measure.  Determination  of  beneﬁts
and costs of burning more coal compared to burning
less or treating coal more to clean up the fuel should
be  done,  but  other  economic  analysis  may  also  be
appropriate.23,24

There  will  be  arguments  over  what  constitutes
sufﬁcient  scientiﬁc  knowledge  for  decision  making.
The precautionary principle may be difﬁcult to apply,
but it is becoming a common part of the process of
environmental  analysis  and  policy  when  applied  to
environmental protection and environmental health
issues.  The  European  Union  has  been  applying  the
principle for over a decade, and the City and County
of  San  Francisco  in  2003  became  the  ﬁrst  govern-
ment in the United States to make the precautionary
principle the basis for its environmental policy.

Applying  the  precautionary  principle  requires  us
to use the principle of environmental unity and pre-
dict potential consequences of activities before they
occur. Therefore, the precautionary principle has the
potential to become a proactive, rather than reactive,
tool in reducing or eliminating environmental degra-
dation resulting from human activity. The principle

bear stories!

moves  the  burden  of  proof  of  no  harm  from  the
public to those proposing a particular action. Those
who develop new chemicals or actions are often, but
not always, against the precautionary principle. The
opponents often argue that applying the principle
is  too  expensive  and  will  stall  progress.  It  seems
unlikely  that  the  principle  will  be  soon  applied
across  the  board  in  the  United  States  to  potential
environmental problems. Nevertheless, it will likely
be invoked more often in the future. When the pre-
cautionary principle is applied, it must be an honest
debate between all informed and potentially affected
parties. The entire range of alternative actions should
be considered, including taking no action.

Science and Values
We Are Creatures of the Pleistocene. There is
no arguing that we are a very successful species that
until  recently  has  lived  in  harmony  with  both  our
planet  and  other  forms  of  life  for  over  100,000
years. We think of ourselves as modern people, and,
certainly,  our  grasp  of  science  and  technology  has
grown  tremendously  in  the  past  several  hundred
years.  However,  we  cannot  forget  that  our  genetic
roots are in the Pleistocene. In reality, our deepest
beliefs and values are probably not far distant from
those of our ancestors who sustained themselves in
small  communities,  moving  from  location  to  loca-
tion and hunting and gathering what they needed.
At ﬁrst thought, this statement seems inconceivable
and  not  possible  to  substantiate,  considering  the
differences between our current way of life and that
of our Pleistocene ancestors. It has been argued that
studying our Pleistocene  ancestors,  with whom we
share nearly identical genetic information, may help
us understand ourselves better.25 That is, much of
our human nature and, in fact, our very humanity
may be found in the lives of the early hunters and
gatherers, explaining some of our current attitudes
toward the natural world. We are more comfortable
with natural sounds and smells, like the movement
of grass where game is moving or the smell of ripe
fruit,  than  the  shrill  noise  of  horns  and  jackham-
mers and the smell of air pollution in the city. Many
of  us  enjoy  sitting  around  a  campﬁre,  roasting
marshmallows  and  telling  stories  about  bears  and
rattlesnakes.  We  may  ﬁnd  a  campﬁre  comforting
even  if  smoke  stings  our  eyes  because  our  Pleis-
tocene  ancestors  knew  ﬁre  protected  them  from
predators,  such  as  bears,  wolves,  and  lions.  If  you

Solutions we choose to solve environmental prob-
lems  depend  upon  how  we  value  people  and  the
environment.  For  example,  if  we  believe  that
human  population  growth  is  a  problem,  then  con-
scious  decisions  to  reduce  human  population
growth  reﬂect  a value decision that we as a society
choose to endorse and implement. As another exam-
ple,  consider  ﬂooding  of  small  urban  streams.
Flooding is a hazard experienced by many commu-
nities.  Study  of  rivers  and  their  natural  processes
leads to a number of potential solutions for a given
ﬂood hazard. We may choose to place the stream in
a concrete box—a remedy that can signiﬁcantly re-
duce the ﬂood hazard. Alternatively, we may choose
to restore our urban streams and their ﬂoodplains,
the  ﬂat  land  adjacent  to  the  river  that  periodically
ﬂoods, as greenbelts. This choice will reduce damage
from ﬂooding, while providing habitat for a variety
of  animals,  including  raccoons,  foxes,  beavers,  and
muskrats that use the stream environment; resident
and migratory birds that nest, feed, and rest close to
a river; and a variety of ﬁsh that live in the river sys-
tem. We will also be more comfortable when inter-
acting with the river. That is why river parks are so
popular.

The coastal environment, where the coast line and
associated  erosional  processes  come  into  conﬂict
with development, provides another example for sci-
ence and values. Solutions to coastal erosion may in-
volve defending the coast, along with its urban de-
velopment,  at  all  cost  by  constructing  “hard
structures,”  such  as  seawalls.  Science  tells  us  that
consequences  from  the  hard  solution  generally  in-
clude reduction or elimination of the beach environ-
ment  in  favor  of  protecting  development.  Science
also tells us that using appropriate setbacks from the
erosion  zone  of  coastal  processes  provides  a  buffer
zone  from  the  erosion,  while  maintaining  a  higher
quality  coastal  environment  that  includes  features
such as beaches and adjacent sea cliffs or dune lines.
The solution we pick depends upon how we value the
coastal zone. If we value the development more than
the beach, then we may choose to protect develop-
ment at all cost. If we value the beach environment,
we may choose more ﬂexible options that allow for
erosion to take place naturally within a buffer zone
between the coast and development.

By  the  year  2050,  the  human  population  on  our
planet  will  likely  increase  to  about  9  billion  people,

38

about 2 billion more than today. Thus, it appears that
during  the  next  50  years,  crucial  decisions  must  be
made concerning how we will deal with the increased

population associated with increased demands on re-
sources including land, water, minerals, and air. The
choices we make will inevitably reﬂect our values.

Summary

The immediate causes of the environ-
mental crisis are overpopulation, ur-
banization, and industrialization,
which have occurred with too little
ethical regard for our land and inade-
quate institutions to cope with 
environmental stress. Solving environ-
mental problems involves both scien-
tiﬁc understanding and the fostering
of social, economic, and ethical behav-
ior that allows solutions to be imple-
mented. Beyond this, complex envi-
ronmental problems can be difﬁcult to
solve, due to the possibility of expo-
nential growth, lag times between
cause and effect, and irreversible con-
sequences. A new emerging policy tool
is the precautionary principle. The idea

behind the principle is that when a po-

lem exists, scientiﬁc certainty is not re-
quired to take a precautionary
approach and ﬁnd a cost-efﬁcient solu-
tion. Some environmental problems
are sufﬁciently serious that it is better
to be safe than sorry.

Five fundamental concepts establish

a philosophical framework for our in-
vestigation of environmental geology:
1. The increasing world population is

the number-one environmental
problem.

2. Sustainability is the preferred 

solution to many environmental
problems.

3. Having an understanding of the
Earth system and rates of change
in systems is critical to solving en-
vironmental problems.

4. Earth processes that are hazardous

to people have always existed.
These natural hazards must be rec-
ognized and avoided when possi-
ble, and their threat to human life
and property minimized.

unity is an important one today.

Case History
Two Cities on a Plate Boundary

California straddles
the boundary
between two 
tectonic plates,
which are 
discussed in
detail in this
chapter. That
boundary
between the
North Ameri-
can and Paciﬁc
plates is the
notorious San
Andreas fault
(Figure 2.1). A
fault is a fracture
along which one
side has moved 
relative to the other,
and the San Andreas
fault is a huge fracture
zone, hundreds of kilo-

meters long. Two major

cities, Los Angeles to the south

and San Francisco to the north,
are located on opposite sides of this

fault. San Francisco was nearly
destroyed by a major earthquake in
1906, which led to the identiﬁcation
of the fault. Many of the moderate to
large earthquakes in the Los Angeles
area are on faults related to the San
Andreas fault system. Most of the
beautiful mountain topography in
coastal California near both Los 
Angeles and San Francisco is a direct
result of processes related to move-
ment on the San Andreas fault. How-
ever, this beautiful topography comes
at a high cost to society. Since 1906,
earthquakes on the San Andreas fault
system or on nearby faults, undoubt-
edly inﬂuenced by the plate boundary,
have cost hundreds of lives and many
billions of dollars in property damage.
Construction of buildings, bridges,
and other structures in California is
more expensive than elsewhere
because these structures must be
designed to withstand ground shaking
caused by earthquakes. Older struc-
tures have to be retroﬁtted, or have
changes made to their structure, to

withstand the shaking, and many peo-
ple purchase earthquake insurance in
an attempt to protect themselves
from the “big one.”

Los Angeles is on the Paciﬁc plate

and is slowly moving toward San 
Francisco, which is on the North
American plate. In about 20 million
years, the cities will be side by side. If
people are present, they might be
arguing over which city is a suburb of
the other. Of course, there will still be
a plate boundary between the Paciﬁc
and North American plates 20 million
years from now, because large plates
have long geologic lives. However,
the boundary may not be the San
Andreas fault. The plate boundary
will probably have moved eastward,
and the topography of what is now
California may be somewhat differ-
ent. In fact, some recent earthquake
activity in California, such as the
large 1992 Landers earthquake, 
east of the San Andreas fault, may 
be the beginning of a shift in the
plate boundary.

2.1 Internal Structure of Earth
You may be familiar with the situation comedy Third
Rock from the Sun, a phrase that refers to our planet
Earth. Far from being a barren rock, Earth is a com-
plex dynamic planet that in some ways resembles a
chocolate-covered  cherry.  That  is,  Earth  has  a  rigid
outer shell, a solid center, and a thick layer of liquid in
between  the  two  that  moves  around  as  a  result  of
dynamic  internal  processes.  The  internal  processes
are  incredibly  important  in  affecting  the  surface  of
Earth. They are responsible for the largest landforms
on the surface: continents and ocean basins. The con-
ﬁguration of the continents and ocean basins in part
controls the oceans’ currents and the distribution of
heat  carried  by  seawater  in  a  global  system  that
affects climate, weather, and the distribution of plant

and  animal  life  on  Earth.  Finally,  Earth’s  internal
processes are also responsible for regional landforms,
including  mountain  chains,  chains  of  active  volca-
noes, and large areas of elevated topography, such as
the  Tibetan  Plateau  and  the  Rocky  Mountains.  The
high  topography  that 
includes  mountains  and
plateaus  signiﬁcantly  affects  both  global  circulation
patterns of air in the lower atmosphere and climate,
thereby  directly  inﬂuencing  all  life  on  Earth.  Thus,
our understanding of the internal processes of Earth
is of much more than simply academic interest. These
processes are at the heart of producing the multitude
of environments shared by all living things on Earth.

The  Earth  Is  Layered  and  Dynamic. Earth
(Figure  2.2a,  page  44)  has  a  radius  of  about 
6,300  km  (4,000  mi)  (Figure  2.2b).  Information

• A liquid outer core with a thickness of just over
2,000 km (1,243 mi), with a composition simi-
lar to that of the inner core. The outer core is
very ﬂuid, more similar to water than to honey.
The average density of the inner core and outer
core is approximately 10.7 g/cm3 (0.39 lb/in.3).
The  maximum  near  the  center  of  Earth  is
about 13 g/cm3 (0.47 lb/in.3). By comparison,
the  density  of  water  is  1  g/cm3 (0.04  lb/in.3)
and  the  average  density  of  Earth  is  approxi-
mately 5.5 g/cm3 (0.2 lb/in.3).

• The mantle, nearly 3,000 km (1,864 mi) thick,
surrounds  the  outer  core  and  is  mostly  solid,
with  an  average  density  of  approximately
4.5 g/cm3 (0.16 lb/in.3). Rocks in the mantle are

regarding the internal layers of the Earth is shown
in Figure 2.2b. We can consider the internal struc-
ture of Earth in two fundamental ways:

• By composition and density (heavy or light)
• By physical properties (e.g., solid or liquid, weak

or strong)

Our discussion will explore the two ways of looking
at  the  interior  of  our  planet.  Some  of  the  compo-
nents of the basic structure of Earth1 are:

• A  solid  inner  core with  a  thickness  of  more
than  1,300  km  (808  mi)  that  is  roughly  the
size of the moon but with a temperature about
as  high  as  the  temperature  of  the  surface  of
the Sun.2 The inner core is believed to be pri-
marily  metallic,  composed  mostly  of  iron
(about  90  percent  by  weight),  with  minor

by tectonic processes; and (3) meteorites, thought to be pieces of an old
Earthlike planet. (From Levin, H. L. 1986. Contemporary Physical Geology, 2nd ed.

Interestingly,  the  density  difference  between
the  outer  core  and  the  overlying  mantle  is
greater than that between the rocks at the sur-
face of Earth and the overlying atmosphere! In
the case of the outer core and mantle, the more
ﬂuid  phase  of  the  outer  core  is  beneath  the
solid  phase  of  the  mantle.  This  is  just  the
opposite  of  the  case  of  the  rock–atmosphere
relationship, where the ﬂuid atmosphere over-
lies  the  solid  lithosphere.  Because  it  is  liquid,

the  outer  core  is  dynamic  and  greatly  inﬂu-
ences the overlying mantle and, thus, the sur-
face of Earth.

• The  crust,  with  variable  thickness,  is  the
outer  rock  layer  of  the  Earth.  The  boundary
between  the  mantle  and  crust  is  known  as
the Mohoroviˇcic´ discontinuity (also called the
Moho).  It  separates  the  lighter  rocks  of  the
crust with an average density of approximately
2.8 g/cm3 (0.10 lb/in.3) from the denser rocks
of the mantle below.

How We Know About the Internal Structure of Earth

45

Continents  and  Ocean  Basins  Have  Signifi-
cantly  Different  Properties  and  History.
Within the uppermost portion of the mantle, near
the  surface  of  Earth,  our  terminology  becomes
more  complicated.  For  example,  the  cool,  strong
outermost  layer  of  Earth  is  also  called  the  litho-
sphere (lithos means  “rock”).  It  is  much  stronger
and  more  rigid  than  the  material  underlying  it, 
the  asthenosphere (asthenos means  “without
strength”), which is a hot and slowly ﬂowing layer
of  relatively  weak  rock.  The  lithosphere  averages
about  100  km  (62  mi)  thick,  ranging  from  a  few
kilometers  (1  to  2  mi)  thick  beneath  the  crests  of
mid-oceanic  ridges  to  about  120  km  (75  mi)
beneath ocean basins and 20 to 400 km (13 to 250
mi) beneath the continents. The crust is embedded
in the top of the lithosphere. Crustal rocks are less
dense  than  the  mantle  rocks  below,  and  oceanic
crust  is  slightly  denser  than  continental  crust.
Oceanic crust is also thinner: The ocean ﬂoor has a
uniform crustal thickness of about 6 to 7 km (3.7 to
4.4 mi), whereas the crustal thickness of continents
averages about 35 km (22 mi) and may be up to 70
km  (44  mi)  thick  beneath  mountainous  regions.
Thus,  the  average  crustal  thickness  is  less  than  1
percent of the total radius of Earth and can be com-
pared to the thin skin of a tangerine. Yet it is this
layer that is of particular interest to us because we
live at the surface of the continental crust.

In addition to differences in density and thick-
ness, the continental and oceanic crusts have very
different  geologic  histories.  The  oceanic  crust  of
the  present  ocean  basins  is  less  than  approxi-
mately  200  million  years  old,  whereas  the  conti-
nental crust may be several billion years old. Three
thousand  kilometers  (1,865  mi)  below  us,  at  the
core–mantle  boundary,  processes  may  be  occur-
ring that significantly affect our planet at the sur-
face. It has been speculated that gigantic cycles of
convection  occur  within  Earth’s  mantle,  rising
from  as  deep  as  the  core–mantle  boundary  up  to
the surface and then falling back again. The con-
cept of convection is illustrated by heating a pan
of hot water on a stove (Figure 2.3). Heating the
water at the bottom of the pan causes the water to
become less dense and more unstable, so it rises to
the top. The rising water displaces denser, cooler
water, which moves laterally and sinks to the bot-
tom  of  the  pan.  It  is  suggested  that  Earth  layers

contain  convection  cells  and  operate  in  a  similar
fashion.

A  complete  convection  cycle  in  the  mantle  may
take  as  long  as  500  million  years.1 Mantle  convec-
tion is fueled at the core–mantle boundary both by
heat supplied from the molten outer core of Earth
and  by  radioactive  decay  of  elements  (such  as  ura-
nium) scattered throughout the mantle. Let us now
examine some of the observations and evidence that
reveal the internal structure of Earth.

2.2 How We Know About the

Internal Structure of Earth

What  We  Have  Learned  About  Earth  from
Earthquakes. Our  knowledge  concerning  the
structure  of  Earth’s  interior  arises  primarily  from
our study of seismology. Seismology is the study of
earthquakes  and  the  passage  of  seismic  waves
through  Earth.3 When  a  large  earthquake  occurs,
seismic energy is released and seismic waves move
both through Earth and along its surface. The prop-
erties  of  these  waves  are  discussed  in  detail  in
Chapter 6 with earthquake hazards.

Some waves move through solid and liquid mate-
rials, while others move through solid, but not liq-
uid,  materials.  The  rates  at  which  seismic  waves

dense hot water rises from the bottom to displace the denser

This process of mass transport is called convection, and each cir-
cle of rising and falling water is a convection cell.

Internal Structure of Earth and Plate Tectonics

propagate are on the order of a few kilometers per
second (1 or 2 mi per second). Their actual velocity
varies with the properties of the materials through
which  the  waves  are  propagating  (i.e.,  moving).
When the seismic waves encounter a boundary, such
as  the  mantle–core  boundary,  some  of  them  are
reﬂected back.  Others  cross  the  boundary  and  are
refracted (i.e., change the direction of propagation).
Still  others  fail  to  propagate  through  the  liquid
outer core. Thousands of seismographs (i.e., instru-
ments  that  record  seismic  waves)  are  stationed
around the world. When an earthquake occurs, the
reﬂected  and  refracted  waves  are  recorded  when
they emerge at the surface. Study of these waves has
been a powerful tool for deducing the layering of the
interior of Earth and the properties of the materials
found there.

In  summary,  the  boundaries  that  delineate  the
internal structure of Earth are determined by study-
ing  seismic  waves  generated  by  earthquakes  and
recorded on seismographs around Earth. As seismol-
ogy has become more sophisticated, we have learned
more and more about the internal structure of Earth
and are ﬁnding that the structure can be quite vari-
able and complex. For example, we have been able to
recognize the following:

• Where magma, which is molten rock beneath
Earth’s surface, is generated in the asthenos-
phere

• The existence of slabs of lithosphere that have

apparently sunk deep into the mantle

• The  extreme  variability  of  lithospheric  thick-

ness, reﬂecting its age and history

2.3 Plate Tectonics
The term tectonics refers to the large-scale geologic
processes  that  deform  Earth’s  lithosphere,  produc-
ing landforms such as ocean basins, continents, and
mountains. Tectonic processes are driven by forces
within  the  Earth.  These  processes  are  part  of  the
tectonic  system,  an  important  subsystem  of  the
Earth system.

Movement of the Lithospheric Plates
What  Is  Plate  Tectonics? The  lithosphere  is
broken  into  large  pieces  called  lithospheric  plates
that move  relative  to  one  another  (Figure  2.4a).4

Processes  associated  with  the  creation,  movement,
and destruction of these plates are collectively known
as plate tectonics.

Locations  of Earthquakes  and  Volcanoes
Define  Plate  Boundaries. A  lithospheric  plate
may include both a continent and part of an ocean
basin or an ocean region alone. Some plates are very
large, and some are relatively small, though they are
signiﬁcant  on  a  regional  scale.  For  example,  the
Juan de Fuca plate off the Paciﬁc Northwest coast of
the  United  States,  which  is  relatively  small,  is
responsible  for  many  of  the  earthquakes  in  north-
ern California. The boundaries between lithospheric
plates  are  geologically  active  areas.  Most  earth-
quakes  and  many  volcanoes  are  associated  with
these  boundaries.  In  fact,  plate  boundaries  are
deﬁned by the areas in which concentrated seismic
activity  occurs  (Figure  2.4b).  Over  geologic  time,
plates  are  formed  and  destroyed,  cycling  materials
from  the  interior  of  Earth  to  the  surface  and  back
again at these boundaries (Figure 2.5, page 48). The
continuous recycling of tectonic processes is collec-
tively called the tectonic cycle.

Seafloor Spreading Is the Mechanism for Plate
Tectonics. As  the  lithospheric  plates  move  over
the asthenosphere, they carry the continents embed-
ded within them.5 The idea that continents move is
not new; it was ﬁrst suggested by German scientist
Alfred Wegener in 1915. The evidence he presented
for continental drift was based on the congruity of
the  shape  of  continents,  particularly  those  across
the Atlantic Ocean, and on the similarity in fossils
found  in  South  America  and  Africa.  Wegener’s
hypothesis  was  not  taken  seriously  because  there
was  no  known  mechanism  that  could  explain  the
movement of continents around Earth. The explana-
tion  came  in  the  1960s,  when  seaﬂoor  spreading
was  discovered.  In  seaﬂoor  regions  called  mid-
oceanic  ridges,  or  spreading  centers,  new  crust  is
continuously  added  to  the  edges  of  lithospheric
plates  (Figure  2.5,  left).  As  oceanic  lithosphere  is
added along some plate edges (spreading centers), it
is  destroyed  along  other  plate  edges,  such  as  at
subduction zones (i.e., areas where one plate sinks
beneath  another  and  is  destroyed)  (see  Figure  2.5,
right).  Thus,  continents  do  not  move  through
oceanic crust; rather, they are carried along with it by
the movement of the plates. Also, because the rate of

Sinking Plates Generate Earthquakes. The con-
cept of a lithospheric plate sinking into the upper man-
tle is shown in diagrammatic form in Figure 2.5. When
the wet, cold oceanic crust comes into contact with the
hot asthenosphere, magma is generated. The magma
rises back to the surface, producing volcanoes, such as
those that ring the Paciﬁc Ocean basin, over subduc-
tion zones. The path of the descending plate (or slab, as
it sometimes is called) into the upper mantle is clearly
marked by earthquakes. As the oceanic plate subducts,
earthquakes  are  produced  both  between  it  and  the
overriding plate and within the interior of the subduct-
ing plate. The earthquakes occur because the sinking

FIGURE 2.7 Plate movement Model of plate movement and mantle. The outer layer (or lithos-
phere) is approximately 100 km (approximately 62 mi) thick and is stronger and more rigid than the
deeper asthenosphere, which is a hot and slowly flowing layer of relatively low-strength rock. The
oceanic ridge is a spreading center where plates pull apart, drawing hot, buoyant material into the
gap. After these plates cool and become dense, they descend at oceanic trenches (subduction zones),
completing the convection system. This process of spreading produces ocean basins, and mountain
ranges often form where plates converge at subduction zones. A schematic diagram of Earth’s layers is
shown in Figure 2.2b. (Grand, S. P. 1994. Mantle shear structure beneath the Americas and surrounding
oceans. Journal of Geophysical Research 99:11591–11621. Modified after Hamblin, W. K. 1992. Earth’s
Dynamic Systems, 6th ed. New York: Macmillan)

lithospheric plate is relatively cooler and stronger than
the surrounding asthenosphere; this difference causes
rocks to break and seismic energy to be released.6

The  paths  of  descending  plates  at  subduction
zones may vary from a shallow dip to nearly verti-
cal,  as  traced  by  the  earthquakes  in  the  slabs.
These  dipping  planes  of  earthquakes  are  called
Wadati-Benioff  zones (Figure  2.6).  The  very
existence  of  Wadati-Benioff  zones  is  strong  evi-
dence that subduction of rigid “breakable” lithos-
phere is occurring.6

Plate Tectonics Is a Unifying Theory. The the-
ory  of  plate  tectonics  is  to  geology  what  Darwin’s
origin  of  species  is  to  biology:  a  unifying  concept
that  explains  an  enormous  variety  of  phenomena.
Biologists now have an understanding of evolution-
ary change. In geology, we are still seeking the exact
mechanism that drives plate tectonics, but we think
it  is  most  likely  convection  within  Earth’s  mantle.
As rocks are heated deep in Earth, they become less
dense and rise. Magma leaks out, cools to form rock
and  is  added  to  the  surfaces  of  plates  at  spreading

centers. As the rocks move laterally, they cool, even-
tually becoming dense enough to sink back into the
mantle  at  subduction  zones.  This  circulation  is
known as convection, which was introduced in Sec-
tion 2.1. Figure 2.7 illustrates the cycles of convec-
tion that may drive plate tectonics.

Types of Plate Boundaries
There  are  three  basic  types  of  plate  boundaries:
divergent,  convergent,  and  transform  (see  Figures
2.4 and  2.5 and  Table  2.1).  These  boundaries  are
not narrow cracks, as shown on maps and diagrams;
rather, they are zones that range from a few kilome-
ters to hundreds of kilometers across. Plate bound-
ary zones are narrower in ocean crust and broader
in continental crust.

Divergent  boundaries occur  where  new  lithos-
phere  is  being  produced  and  neighboring  parts  of
plates are moving away from each other. Typically,
this  process  occurs  at  mid-ocean  ridges,  and  the
process is called seaﬂoor spreading (Figure 2.5). Mid-
ocean  ridges  form  when  hot  material  from  the

mantle rises up to form a broad ridge, typically with
a  central  rift  valley.  It  is  called  a  rift valley,  or  rift,
because  the  plates  moving  apart  are  pulling  the
crust apart and splitting, or rifting, it. Molten vol-
canic rock that is erupted along this rift valley cools
and  forms  new  plate  material.  The  system  of  mid-
oceanic  ridges  along  divergent  plate  boundaries
forms  linear  submarine  mountain  chains  that  are
found in virtually every ocean basin on Earth.

Convergent boundaries occur where plates col-
lide. If one of the converging plates is oceanic and
the  other  is  continental,  an  oceanic–continental
plate  collision  results.  The  higher-density  oceanic
plate  descends,  or  subducts,  into  the  mantle

beneath the leading edge of the continental plate,
producing a subduction zone (Figure 2.5). The con-
vergence or collision of a continent with an ocean
plate  can  result  in  compression.  Compression is  a
type  of  stress,  or  force  per  unit  area.  When  an
oceanic–continental  plate  collision  occurs,  com-
pression is exerted on the lithosphere, resulting in
shortening of the surface of Earth, like pushing a
table cloth to produce folds. Shortening can cause
folding, as in the table cloth example, and faulting,
or displacement of rocks along fractures to thicken
the  lithosphere  (Figure  2.8a).  This  process  of
deformation produces major mountain chains and
volcanoes such as the Andes in South America and

the Cascade Mountains in the Paciﬁc Northwest of
the United States (see A Closer Look: The Wonder
of  Mountains).  If  two  oceanic  lithospheric  plates
collide  (oceanic-to-oceanic  plate  collision),  one
plate subducts beneath the other, and a subduc-
tion  zone  and  arc-shaped  chain  of  volcanoes
known as an island arc is formed (Figure 2.8b)
as,  for  example,  the  Aleutian  Islands  of  the
North  Paciﬁc.  A  submarine  trench,  rela-
tively narrow depression on the ocean ﬂoor
(usually  several  thousand  kilometers  long
and  several  kilometers  deep),  is  often
formed as the result of the convergence of
two  colliding  plates,  with  the  subduction 
of one. A trench is often located seaward of
a  subduction  zone  associated  with  an
oceanic–continental  plate  or  oceanic–oceanic
plate collision. Submarine trenches are sites of
some  of  the  deepest  oceanic  waters  on  Earth.
For  example,  the  Marianas  trench  at  the  center
edge  of  the  Philippine  plate  is  11  km  (7  mi)
deep. Other major trenches include the Aleutian
trench  south  of  Alaska  and  the  Peru–Chile
trench west of South America. If the leading edges
of both plates contain relatively light, buoyant con-
tinental  crust,  subduction  into  the  mantle  of  one
of the plates is difﬁcult. In this case, a continent-
to-continent  plate  collision  occurs,  in  which  the
edges of the plates collide, causing shortening and
lithospheric thickening due to folding and faulting.
(Figure 2.8c). Where the two plates join is known
as  a  suture  zone.  Continent-to-continent  collision
has  produced  some  of  the  highest  mountain  sys-

tems on Earth, such as the Alpine and Himalayan
mountain belts (Figure 2.9). Many older mountain
belts  were  formed  in  a  similar  way;  for  example,
the Appalachians formed during an ancient conti-
nent-to-continent  plate  collision  250  to  350  mil-
lion years ago.

Transform boundaries, or transform faults, occur
where the edges of two plates slide past one another,
as shown in Figure 2.5. If you examine Figures 2.4a
and 2.5, you will see that a spreading zone is not a

The Wonder of Mountains

Mountains have long fascinated peo-
ple with their awesome presence. We
are now discovering a fascinating
story concerning their origin. The
story removes some of the mystery
as to how mountains form, but it has
not removed the wonder. The new
realization that mountains are sys-
tems (see Chapter 1) resulting from
the interaction between tectonic
activity (that leads to crustal thicken-
ing), the climate of the mountain,
and Earth surface processes (particu-
larly erosion) has greatly expanded
our knowledge of how mountains
develop.7,8 Speciﬁcally, we have
learned the following:
• Tectonic processes at convergent
plate boundaries lead to crustal
thickening and initial develop-
ment of mountains. The mean (or
average) elevation that a moun-
tain range attains is a function of
the uplift rate, which varies from
less than 1 mm to about 10 mm
per year (0.04 to 0.4 in. per year).
The greater the rate of uplift, the
higher the point to which the
mean elevation of a mountain
range is likely to rise during its
evolution.

• As a mountain range develops

and gains in elevation, it begins to
modify the local and regional cli-
mate by blocking storm paths and
producing a “rain shadow” in
which the mountain slopes on the
rain shadow side receive much less
rainfall than does the other side 
of the mountain. As a result, rates
of runoff and erosion on the side
of the rain shadow are less than
for the other side. Nevertheless,
the rate of erosion increases as 

the elevation of the mountain
range increases, and eventually
the rate of erosion matches the
rate of uplift. When the two
match, the mountain reaches its
maximum mean elevation, which
is a dynamic balance between
uplift and erosion. At this point,
no amount of additional uplift will
increase the mean elevation of the
mountains above the dynamic
maximum. However, if the uplift
rate increases, then a higher equi-
librium mean elevation of the
range may be reached. Further-
more, when the uplift ceases or
there is a reduction in the rate of
uplift, the mean elevation of the
mountain range will decrease.7
Strangely, the elevations of indi-
vidual peaks may still increase!

• Despite erosion, the elevation of a

mountain peak in a range may
actually increase. This statement
seems counterintuitive until we
examine in detail some of the
physical processes resulting from
erosion. The uplift that results from
the erosion is known as isostatic
uplift. Isostasy is the principle
whereby thicker, more buoyant
crust stands topographically
higher than crust that is thinner
and denser. The principle govern-
ing how erosion can result in uplift
is illustrated in Figure 2.A. The ﬁc-
titious Admiral Frost has been
marooned on an iceberg and is
uncomfortable being far above the
surface of the water. He attempts
to remove the ice that is above the
water line. Were it not for isostatic
(buoyant) uplift, he would have
reached his goal to be close to the

water line. Unfortunately for Admi-
ral Frost, this is not the way the
world works; continuous isostatic
uplift of the block as ice is removed
always keeps one-tenth of the ice-
berg above the water. So, after
removing the ice above the water
line, he still stands almost as much
above the water line as before.7

• Mountains, of course, are not ice-
bergs, but the rocks of which they
are composed are less dense than
the rocks of the mantle beneath.
Thus, they tend to “ﬂoat” on top of
the denser mantle. Also, in moun-
tains, erosion is not uniform but is
generally conﬁned to valley walls
and bottoms. Thus, as erosion con-
tinues and the mass of the moun-
tain range is reduced, isostatic
compensation occurs, and the
entire mountain range rises in
response. As a result of the ero-
sion, the maximum elevation of
mountain peaks actually may
increase, while the mean elevation
of the entire mountain block
decreases. As a general rule, as the
equivalent of 1 km (0.6 mi) of ero-
sion across the entire mountain
block occurs, the mean elevation
of mountains will rise approxi-
mately 0.83 km (0.5 mi).
In summary, research concerning

the origin of mountains suggests
that they result in part from tectonic
processes that cause the uplift, but
they also are intimately related to cli-
matic and erosional processes that
contribute to the mountain building
process. Erosion occurs during and
after tectonic uplift, and isostatic
compensation to that erosion
occurs for millions of years. This is

Plate Tectonics

53

one reason it is difﬁcult to remove
mountain systems from the land-
scape. For example, mountain sys-
tems such as the Appalachian Moun-
tains in the southeastern United

States were originally produced by
tectonic uplift several hundred mil-
lion years ago, when Europe collided
with North America. There has been
sufﬁcient erosion of the original

Appalachian Mountains to have
removed them as topographic fea-
tures many times over were it not for
continued isostatic uplift in response
to the erosion.

FIGURE 2.A Isostasy Cartoon showing
the principle of isostatic uplift. Admiral Frost is
left adrift on an iceberg and is uncomfortable
being so far above the surface of the water (a).
He decides to remove the 10,000 kg (22,046
lb) of ice that is above the water 
line on the iceberg on which he is standing
(b). Were it not for isostatic (buoyant) uplift,
Admiral Frost would reach his goal (c). 
However, in a world with isostasy, uplift results
from removal of the ice, and one-tenth of the
iceberg is always above the water 
(d). What would have happened if Admiral
Frost had elected to remove 10,000 kg of ice
from only one-half of the area of ice exposed
above the sea? Answer: The maximum eleva-
tion of the iceberg above the water would
have actually increased. Similarly, as moun-
tains erode, isostatic adjustments also occur,
and the maximum elevation of mountain
peaks may actually increase as a result of the
erosion alone! (From Keller, E. A., and Pinter, N.

single, continuous rift but a series of rifts that are
offset from one another along connecting transform
faults.  Although  the  most  common  locations  for
transform plate boundaries are within oceanic crust,
some  occur  within  continents.  A  well-known  conti-
nental transform boundary is the San Andreas fault in
California, where the rim of the Paciﬁc plate is sliding
horizontally past the rim of the North American plate
(see Figures 2.4a and 2.10).

Locations where three plates border one another
are  known  as  triple  junctions.  Figure  2.10 shows
several such junctions: Two examples are the meet-
ing point of the Juan de Fuca, North American, and
Paciﬁc  plates  on  the  West  Coast  of  North  America
(this is known as the Mendocino triple junction) and
the junction of the spreading ridges associated with
the  Paciﬁc,  Cocos,  and  Nazca  plates  west  of  South
America.

Rates of Plate Motion
Plate Motion Is a Fast Geologic Process. The
directions in which plates move are shown in Figure
2.4a. In general, plates move a few centimeters per
year,  about  as  fast  as  some  people’s  ﬁngernails  or
hair grows. The Paciﬁc plate moves past the North
American  plate  along  the  San  Andreas  fault  about
3.5  cm  (1.4  in.)  per  year,  so  that  features  such  as
rock  units  or  streams  are  gradually  displaced  over
time where they cross the fault (Figure 2.11). Dur-
ing the past 5 million years, there has been about
175 km (about 110 mi) of displacement, a distance
equivalent to driving 2 hours at 55 mph on a high-
way along the San Andreas fault. Although the cen-
tral  portions  of  the  plates  move  along  at  a  steady

slow rate, plates interact at their boundaries, where
collision  or  subduction  or  both  occur,  and  move-
ment  may  not  be  smooth  or  steady.  The  plates
often  get  stuck  together.  The  movement  is  analo-
gous to sliding one rough wood board over another.
Movement occurs when the splinters of the boards
break  off  and  the  boards  move  quickly  by  one
another.  When  rough  edges  along  the  plate  move
quickly, an earthquake is produced. Along the San
Andreas fault, which is a transform plate boundary,
the displacement is horizontal and can amount to
several  meters  during  a  great  earthquake.  During
an earthquake in 1857 on the San Andreas fault, a
horse corral across the fault was reportedly changed
from a circle to an “S” shape. Fortunately, such an
event  generally  occurs  at  any  given  location  only

once every 100 years or so. Over long time periods,
rapid displacement from periodic earthquakes and
more  continuous  slow  “creeping”  displacements
add together to produce the rate of several centime-
ters  of  movement  per  year  along  the  San  Andreas
fault.

2.4 A Detailed Look at Seaﬂoor

Spreading

When  Alfred  Wegener  proposed  the  idea  of  conti-
nental  drift  in  1915,  he  had  no  solid  evidence  of  a
mechanism that could move continents. The global
extent  of  mid-oceanic  ridges  was  discovered  in  the
1950s,  and  in  1962  geologist  Harry  H.  Hess  pub-
lished a paper suggesting that continental drift was
the result of the process of seaﬂoor spreading along
those  ridges.  The  fundamentals  of  seaﬂoor  spread-
ing are shown in Figure 2.5. New oceanic lithosphere
is  produced  at  the  spreading  ridge  (i.e.,  divergent
plate boundary). The lithospheric plate then moves
laterally, carrying along the embedded continents in
the  tops  of  moving  plates.  These  ideas  produced  a
new major paradigm that greatly changed our ideas
about how Earth works.3,6,9

The  validity  of  seaﬂoor  spreading  was  estab-
lished  from  three  sources:  (1)  identiﬁcation  and
mapping  of  oceanic  ridges,  (2)  dating  of  volcanic

rocks on the ﬂoor of the ocean, and (3) understand-
ing  and  mapping  of  the  paleomagnetic  history  of

We  introduce  and  discuss  Earth’s  magnetic  ﬁeld
and paleomagnetic history in some detail in order
to  understand  how  seaﬂoor  spreading  and  plate
tectonics  were  discovered.  Earth  has  had  a  mag-
netic  ﬁeld  for  at  least  the  past  3.5  billion  years
(Figure 2.12a).2 The ﬁeld can be represented by a
dipole magnetic ﬁeld with lines of magnetic force
extending from the South Pole to the North Pole. A
dipole  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  one  that  has  equal  and
opposite charges at either end. Convection occurs
in  the  iron-rich,  ﬂuid,  hot  outer  core  of  Earth
because of compositional changes and heat at the
inner-outer core boundary. As more buoyant mate-
rial in the outer core rises, it starts the convection
(Figures 2.3 and 2.7). The convection in the outer
core, along with the rotation of Earth that causes
rotation of the outer core, initiates a ﬂow of elec-
tric current in the core. This ﬂow of current within
the  core  produces  and  sustains  Earth’s  magnetic
ﬁeld.2,3

Earth’s  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  sufﬁcient  to  perma-
nently magnetize some surface rocks. For example,
volcanic rock that erupts and cools at mid-oceanic

ridges  becomes  magnetized  at  the  time  it  passes
through  a  critical  temperature.  At  that  critical
temperature,  known  as  the  Curie  point,  magnetic
domains  within  iron-bearing  minerals  (such  as
magnetite) in the volcanic rock orient themselves
parallel to the magnetic field. This is a permanent
magnetization  known  as  thermoremnant  magneti-
zation.3 The  term  paleomagnetism refers  to  the
study of the magnetism of rocks at the time their
magnetic  signature  formed.  It  is  used  to  deter-
mine the magnetic history of Earth.

The magnetic ﬁeld, based on the size and conduc-
tivity  of  Earth’s  core,  must  be  continuously  gener-
ated or it would decay away in about 20,000 years. It
would decay because the temperature of the core is
too high to sustain permanent magnetization.2

Earth’s Magnetic Field Periodically Reverses.
Before  the  discovery  of  plate  tectonics,  geologists
working on land had already discovered that some
volcanic rocks were magnetized in a direction oppo-
site  to  the  present-day  ﬁeld,  suggesting  that  the
polarity  of  Earth’s  magnetic  ﬁeld  was  reversed  at
the  time  the  volcanoes  erupted  and  the  rocks
cooled (Figure 2.12b). The rocks were examined for
whether  their  magnetic  ﬁeld  was  normal,  as  it  is
today, or reversed relative to that of today, for cer-
tain time intervals of the Earth’s history. A chronol-
ogy for the past few million years was constructed
on the basis of the dating of the “reversed” rocks.
You  can  verify  the  current  magnetic  ﬁeld  of  the

Earth  by  using  a  compass;  at  this  point  in  Earth’s
history,  the  needle  points  to  the  north  magnetic
pole. During a period of reversed polarity, the nee-
dle  would  point  south!  The  cause  of  magnetic
reversals is  not  well  known,  but  it  is  related  to
changes  in  the  convective  movement  of  the  liquid
material in the outer core and processes occurring
in the inner core. Reversals in Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld
are apparently random, occurring on average every
few hundred thousand years. The change in polar-
ity  of  Earth’s  magnetic  ﬁeld  takes  a  few  thousand
years  to  occur,  which  in  geologic  terms  is  a  very
short time.

What  Produces  Magnetic  Stripes? To  further
explore the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, geologists towed
magnetometers,  instruments  that  measure  mag-
netic properties of rocks, from ships and completed
magnetic surveys. The paleomagnetic record of the
ocean ﬂoor is easy to read because of the fortuitous
occurrence of the volcanic rock basalt (see Chapter
3) that is produced at spreading centers and forms
the ﬂoors of the ocean basins of Earth. The rock is
ﬁne  grained  and  contains  sufﬁcient  iron-bearing
minerals  to  produce  a  good  magnetic  record.  The
marine  geologists’  discoveries  were  not  expected.
The  rocks  on  the  ﬂoor  of  the  ocean  were  found  to
have irregularities in the magnetic ﬁeld. These irreg-
ular  magnetic  patterns  were  called  anomalies or
perturbations of  Earth’s  magnetic  ﬁeld  caused  by
local ﬁelds of magnetized rocks on the seaﬂoor. The

anomalies  can  be  represented  as  stripes  on  maps.
When  mapped,  the  stripes  form  quasi-linear  pat-
terns  parallel  to  oceanic  ridges.  The  marine  geolo-
gists found that their sequences of stripe width pat-
terns  matched  the  sequences  established  by  land
geologists  for  polarity  reversals  in  land  volcanic
rocks. Magnetic survey data for an area southwest
of  Iceland  are  shown  in  Figure  2.13.  The  black
stripes  represent  normally  magnetized  rocks,  and
the  intervening  white  stripes  represent  reversed
magnetized rocks.10 Notice that the stripes are not
evenly spaced but have patterns that are symmetri-
cal  on  opposite  sides  of  the  Mid-Atlantic  Ridge
(Figure 2.13).

A Detailed Look at Seaﬂoor Spreading

57

Why  Is  the  Seafloor  No  Older  Than  200  Mil-
lion Years? The discovery of patterns of magnetic
stripes at various locations in ocean basins allowed
geologists to infer numerical dates for the volcanic
rocks.  Merging  the  magnetic  anomalies  with  the
numerical ages of the rocks produced the record of
seaﬂoor spreading. The spreading of the ocean ﬂoor,
beginning at a mid-oceanic ridge, could explain the
magnetic stripe patterns.11 Figure 2.14 is an ideal-
ized  diagram  showing  how  seafloor  spreading
may  produce  the  patterns  of  magnetic  anomalies
(stripes). The pattern shown is for the past several
million years, which includes several periods of nor-
mal  and  reversed  magnetization  of  the  volcanic
rocks. Black stripes represent normally magnetized
rocks, and brown stripes are rocks with a reversed
magnetic  signature.  Notice  that  the  most  recent
magnetic reversal occurred approximately 0.7 million
years ago. The basic idea illustrated by Figure 2.14 is
that rising magma at the oceanic ridge is extruded,
or  pushed  out  onto  the  surface,  through  volcanic
activity,  and  the  cooling  rocks  become  normally
magnetized. When the ﬁeld is reversed, the cooling
rocks preserve a reverse magnetic signature, and a
brown stripe (Figure 2.14) is preserved. Notice that
the patterns of magnetic anomalies in rocks on both
sides of the ridge are mirror images of one another.
The only way such a pattern might result is through
the process of seaﬂoor spreading. Thus, the pattern
of  magnetic  reversals  found  on  rocks  of  the  ocean
ﬂoor is strong evidence that the process of spread-
ing  is  happening.  Mapping  of  magnetic  anomalies,
when  combined  with  age-dating  of  the  magnetic
reversals in land rocks, creates a database that sug-
gests exciting inferences; Figure 2.15 shows the age
of the ocean ﬂoor as determined from this database.
The  pattern,  showing  that  the  youngest  volcanic
rocks  are  found  along  active  mid-oceanic  ridges,  is
consistent with the theory of seaﬂoor spreading. As
distance from these ridges increases, the age of the
ocean ﬂoor also increases, to a maximum of about
200  million  years,  during  the  early  Jurassic  period
(see  Table  1.1).  Thus,  it  appears  that  the  present
ocean ﬂoors of the world are no older than 200 mil-
lion years. In contrast, rocks on continents are often
much older than Jurassic, going back about 4 billion
years, almost 20 times older than the ocean ﬂoors!
We  conclude  that  the  thick  continental  crust,  by
virtue  of  its  buoyancy,  is  more  stable  at  Earth’s

black stripes represent normal magnetization; the brown stripes are reversed magnetization. The record shown here
was formed over a period of several million years. Magnetic anomalies (stripes) are a mirror image of each other on
opposite sides of the mid-oceanic ridge. Thus, the symmetrical bands of the normally and reversely magnetized rocks
are produced by the combined effects of the reversals and seaﬂoor spreading. (Courtesy of Tanya Atwater)

surface  than  are  rocks  of  the  crust  of  the  ocean
basins.  Continents  form  by  the  processes  of  accre-
tion  of  sediments,  addition  of  volcanic  materials,
and collisions of tectonic plates carrying continental
landmasses. We will continue this discussion when
we consider the movement of continents during the
past 200 million years. However, it is important to
recognize that it is the pattern of magnetic stripes
that allows us to reconstruct how the plates and the
continents embedded in them have moved through-
out history.

Hot Spots
What Are Hot Spots? There are a number of places
on Earth called hot spots, characterized by volcanic
centers  resulting  from  hot  rocks  produced  deep  in
the mantle, perhaps near the core–mantle boundary.
The partly molten rock (magma) is buoyant enough
to  move  up  through  mantle  and  overlying  moving
tectonic  plates.3,6 An  example  of  a  continental  hot
spot  is  the  volcanic  region  of  Yellowstone  National
Park. Hot spots are also found in both the Atlantic
and Paciﬁc Oceans. If the hot spot is anchored in the
slow-moving deep mantle, then, as the plate moves
over  a  hot  spot,  a  chain  of  volcanoes  is  produced.
Perhaps the best example of this type of hot spot is
the line of volcanoes forming the Hawaiian–Emperor
Chain in the Paciﬁc Ocean (Figure 2.16a). Along this
chain, volcanic eruptions range in age from present-
day activity on the big island of Hawaii (in the south-
east)  to  more  than  78  million  years  ago  near  the
northern end of the Emperor Chain. With the excep-
tion  of  the  Hawaiian  Islands  and  some  coral  atolls
(i.e.,  ring-like  coral  islands  such  as  Midway  Island),
the chain consists of submarine volcanoes known as
seamounts. Seamounts are islands that were eroded
by waves and submarine landslides and subsequently
sank beneath the ocean surface. As seamounts move
farther  off  the  hot  spot,  the  volcanic  rocks  the
islands are composed of cool, and the oceanic crust
they are on becomes denser and sinks.

Seamounts constitute impressive submarine vol-
canic  mountains.  In  the  Hawaiian  Chain,  the
youngest  volcano  is  Mount  Loihi,  which  is  still  a
submarine volcano, presumably directly over a hot
spot, as idealized in Figure 2.16b. The ages of the
Hawaiian  Islands  increase  to  the  northwest,  with
the  oldest  being  Kauai,  about  6  million  years  old.
Notice  in  Figure  2.16a that  the  line  of  seamounts

Pangaea and Present Continents

makes a sharp bend at the junction of the Hawaiian
and Emperor Chains. The age of the volcanic rocks
at the bend is about 43 million years, and the bend
is  interpreted  to  represent  a  time  when  plate
motions changed.12 If we assume that the hot spots
are ﬁxed deep in the mantle, then the chains of vol-
canic  islands  and  submarine  volcanoes  along  the
ﬂoor  of  the  Paciﬁc  Ocean  that  get  older  farther
away from the hot spot provide additional evidence
to  support  the  theory  of  movement  of  the  Paciﬁc
plate.  In  other  words,  the  ages  of  the  volcanic
islands  and  submarine  volcanoes  could  systemati-
cally change as they do only if the plate is moving
over the hot spot.

2.5 Pangaea and Present

Continents

Plate  Tectonics  Shapes  Continents  and  Dic-
tates  the  Location  of Mountain  Ranges.
Movement of the lithospheric plates is responsible
for the present shapes and locations of the conti-
nents. There is good evidence that the most recent
global  period  of  continental  drift,  driven  by
seafloor  spreading,  started  about  200  million
years  ago,  with  the  breakup  of  a  supercontinent
called  Pangaea  (this  name,  meaning  “all  lands,”
was  first  proposed  by  Wegener).  Pangaea  (pro-
nounced  pan-jee-ah)  was  enormous,  extending
from pole to pole and over halfway around Earth
near the equator (Figure 2.17, page 61). Pangaea
had  two  parts  (Laurasia  to  the  north  and  Gond-
wana  to  the  south)  and  was  constructed  during
earlier  continental  collisions.  Figure  2.17a shows
Pangaea  as  it  was  nearly  200  million  years  ago.
Seafloor spreading over the past 200 million years
separated  Eurasia  and  North  America  from  the
southern landmass, Eurasia from North America,
and  the  southern  continents  (South  America,
Africa, India, Antarctica, and Australia) from one
another 
(Figure  2.17b–d).  The  Tethys  Sea,
between Africa and Europe-Asia (Figure 2.17a–c),
closed,  as  part  of  the  activity  that  produced  the
Alps  in  Europe.  A  small  part  of  this  once  much
larger sea remains today as the Mediterranean Sea
(Figure  2.17d).  About  50  million  years  ago,  India
crashed  into  China.  That  collision,  which  has
caused India to forcefully intrude into China a dis-
tance comparable from New York to Miami, is still

tains (the highest mountains in the world) and the
Tibetan Plateau.

Understanding  Plate  Tectonics  Solves  Long-
Standing  Geologic  Problems. Reconstruction
of  what  the  supercontinent  Pangaea  looked  like
about  200  million  years  ago  has  cleared  up  two
interesting geologic problems:

• Occurrence of the same fossil plants and ani-
mals on different continents that would be dif-
ﬁcult to explain if they had not been joined in
the past (see Figure 2.18).

• Evidence of ancient glaciation on several con-
tinents,  with  inferred  directions  of  ice  ﬂow,
that  makes  sense  only  if  the  continents  are
placed  back  within  Gondwanaland  (southern

Pangaea) as it was before splitting apart (see
Figure 2.19).

2.6 How Plate Tectonics Works:

Putting It Together

Driving  Mechanisms  That  Move  Plates. The
primary source of energy that drives plate tectonics
is energy from the molten interior of Earth (see Sec-
tion 2.1 and Figure 2.7). Convection of the mantle
heated by the core has kept Earth tectonically active
for several billion years and will likely continue for
several billion more years.13 Now that we have pre-
sented the concept that new oceanic lithosphere is
produced at mid-oceanic ridges because of seaﬂoor
spreading  and  that  old,  cooler  plates  sink  into  the

The arrows indicate the direction of ice movement. Notice that the arrows are all pointing away from ocean sources. Also, these areas are
close to the tropics today, where glaciation would have been very unlikely in the past. These Paleozoic glacial deposits were formed when
Pangaea was a supercontinent, before fragmentation by continental drift. (b) The continents are restored. (It is thought that continents
had drifted north, away from the South Pole.) Notice that the arrows now point outward, as if moving away from a central area where
glacial ice was accumulating. Thus, restoring the position of the continents produces a pattern of glacial deposits that makes much more
sense. (Modiﬁed after Hamblin, W. K. 1992. Earth’s Dynamic Systems, 6th ed. New York: Macmillan)

Both are gravity driven. The heavy lithosphere falls down the mid-oceanic ridge slope and subducts down

mantle  at  subduction  zones,  let  us  evaluate  the
process  of  what  causes  the  lithospheric  plates  to
actually move and subduct. Figure 2.20 is an ideal-
ized  diagram  illustrating  the  two  possible  driving
processes: ridge push and slab pull.6

The  mid-oceanic  ridges  or  spreading  centers
stand at elevations of 1 to 3 km (3,000 to 9,000 ft)
above the ocean ﬂoor as linear, gently arched uplifts
(submarine mountain ranges; see Figure 2.21) with
widths  greater  than  the  distance  from  Florida  to
Canada.  The  total  length  of  mid-oceanic  ridges  on
Earth  is  about  twice  the  circumference  of  Earth.
Ridge  push  is  a  gravitational  push,  like  a  gigantic
landslide, away from the ridge crest toward the sub-
duction  zone  (the 
lithosphere  slides  on  the
asthenosphere).  Slab  pull  results  because,  as  the
lithospheric  plate  moves  farther  from  the  ridge,  it
cools, gradually becoming denser than the asthenos-
phere  beneath  it.  At  a  subduction  zone,  the  plate
sinks through the lighter, hotter mantle below the
lithosphere, and the weight of this descending plate
pulls  on  the  entire  plate,  resulting  in  slab  pull.
Which of the two processes, ridge push or slab pull,
is the more inﬂuential of the driving forces? Calcula-
tions  of  the  expected  gravitational  effects  suggest
that ridge push is of relatively low importance com-

pared with slab pull. In addition, it is observed that
plates  with  large  subducting  slabs  attached  and
pulling  on  them  tend  to  move  much  more  rapidly
than  those  driven  primarily  by  ridge  push  alone
(e.g., the subduction zones surrounding the Paciﬁc
Basin).  Thus,  slab  pull  may  be  more  inﬂuential  in
moving plates than ridge push.

2.7 Plate Tectonics and

Environmental Geology

Plate Tectonics Affects Us All. The importance
of the tectonic cycle to environmental geology can-
not  be  overstated.  Everything  living  on  Earth  is
affected  by  plate  tectonics.  As  the  plates  slowly
move a few centimeters each year, so do the conti-
nents  and  ocean  basins,  producing  zones  of
resources  (oil,  gas,  and  minerals),  as  well  as  earth-
quakes  and  volcanoes  (Figure  2.4b).  The  tectonic
processes  occurring  at  plate  boundaries  largely
determine  the  types  and  properties  of  the  rocks

different landscapes, but both have favorable condi-
tions  for  urban  development.  New  York  (Figure
2.22a)  is  sited  on  the  “trailing  edge”  of  the  North
American plate, and the properties of the coastline
are directly related to the lack of collisions between
plates in the area. The divergent plate boundary at
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between North America and
Africa  is  several  thousand  kilometers  (over  1,500
mi)  to  the  east.  The  collision  boundaries  between
the  North  American  and  Caribbean  plates  and
between the North American and Paciﬁc plates are
several thousands of kilometers (over 1,500 mi) to
the  south  and  west,  respectively  (see  Figure  2.4a).
The passive processes of sedimentation from rivers,
glaciers,  and  coastal  processes,  depositing  sedi-
ments  on  rifted  and  thinned  continental  crust,
instead of the more active crustal deformation that
produces  mountains,  have  shaped  the  coastline  of
the  eastern  United  States  north  of  Florida.  The
breakup  of  Pangaea  about  200  million  years  ago
(Figure  2.17)  produced  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  which,
with a variety of geologic processes, including ero-
sion,  deposition,  and  glaciation  over  millions  of

years,  eventually  led  to  the  development  of  the
beautiful  but  subdued  topography  of  the  coastal
New York area. In contrast, the Los Angeles metro-
politan area is near the “leading edge” of the bound-
ary between the North American and Paciﬁc plates
(Figure  2.10),  characterized  by  active,  vigorous
crustal  deformation  (uplift;  subsidence,  or  sinking
of  the  ground’s  surface;  and  faulting)  associated
with the San Andreas fault, a transform boundary.
The  deformation  has  produced  the  Los  Angeles
Basin,  rimmed  by  rugged  mountains  and  uplifted
coastline (Figure 2.22b).

Plate motion over millions of years can change or
modify ﬂow patterns in the oceans and the atmos-
phere, inﬂuencing or changing global climate, as well
as  regional  variation  in  precipitation.  Over  several
hundred million to several billion years, plate tecton-
ics has formed, maintained, destroyed, and reformed
ocean  basins  and  continents.  This  cyclic  nature  of
plate  tectonics  has  been  called  the  Wilson  Cycle,
named after the famous Canadian geologist and geo-
physists  John  Tuzo  Wilson,  who  made  signiﬁcant
contributions  to  plate  tectonics.  A  summary  of  the

FIGURE 2.23 Wilson Cycle Idealized diagram of the Wilson Cycle, which is a relatively simple model of how Earth works. The cycle
shown here is in six parts (stages), starting with a relatively thin-crusted continent worn down by erosion (1), fringed by oceans, that rifts
(i.e., spreads apart) due to upwelling of magma, forming a spreading ridge (2); seaﬂoor spreading forms an ocean basin. A subduction
zone forms (3), initiating convergence, volcanic processes, and welding of sediment and rock to the continent; the ocean basin begins to
close (4). With closing of the ocean basin, collision occurs (5) and high mountains form. Erosion of the continent and crustal thinning (6) is
a ﬁnal stage before another cycle is initiated (1). One cycle takes several hundred million years. Over the history of Earth, many cycles have
formed, maintained, and destroyed ocean basins and rearranged and eroded continents.

Plate tectonics affects the productivity of the land
and its desirability as a place to live. Plate tectonics

also determines, in part, what types of minerals and
rocks  are  found  in  a  particular  region.  We  will
explore  how  rocks  and  minerals  are  inﬂuenced  by
plate tectonics in Chapter 3.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About the San Andreas fault 
to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. What is the link between popu-
lation growth and the hazards
from the San Andreas fault?

2. How does the San Andreas fault
link to understanding the Earth
as a system?

Summary

Our knowledge concerning the struc-
ture of Earth’s interior is based on
the study of seismology. Thus, we are
able to deﬁne the major layers of
Earth, including the inner core, outer
core, mantle, and crust. The upper-
most layer of Earth, known as the
lithosphere, is relatively strong and
rigid compared with the soft
asthenosphere found below it. The
lithosphere is broken into large
pieces called plates that move relative
to one another. As these plates move,
they carry along the continents
embedded within them. This process
of plate tectonics produces large
landforms, including continents,

ocean basins, mountain ranges, and
large plateaus. Oceanic basins are
formed by the process of seaﬂoor
spreading and are destroyed by the
process of subduction, both of which
result from convection within the
mantle.

The three types of plate bound-

aries are divergent (e.g., mid-oceanic
ridges, spreading centers), conver-
gent (e.g., subduction zones, conti-
nental collisions), and transform
faults. At some locations, three
plates meet in areas known as triple
junctions. Rates of plate movement
are generally a few centimeters per
year.

Evidence supporting seafloor

spreading includes paleomagnetic
data, the configurations of hot 
spots and chains of volcanoes, and
reconstructions of past continental
positions.

The driving forces in plate tecton-

ics are ridge push and slab pull. At
present, we believe the process of slab
pull is more signiﬁcant than ridge
push for moving tectonic plates from
spreading centers to subduction
zones.

Plate tectonics is very important

in environmental geology because
everything living on Earth is affected
by it.

Critical Thinking Question
1. Assume that the supercontinent

up. Deduce how Earth processes,
landforms, and environments

might be different than they are
today with the continents spread

about what the breakup of the 

continents did in terms of building
mountain ranges and producing
ocean basins that affect climate
and so forth.

Learning Objectives
Minerals and rocks are part of our inheritance from the geologic past. They are the basic building
blocks of the solid Earth and are particularly important in environmental geology for the
following reasons: (1) Minerals and rocks are among the basic resources we depend upon for
building our homes, driving our automobiles, and manufacturing our computers, among many
other things; (2) minerals and rocks play an important role in many Earth processes, such as
landsliding, coastal erosion, and volcanic activity; (3) study of minerals and rocks provides
important information concerning the history of Earth; and (4) knowledge of mineral and rock
processes and properties is an integral part of understanding how Earth works and how to best

manage Earth’s resources. Mineral resources are discussed in detail in Chapter 15.

In this chapter we focus on the following learning objectives:

• Understand minerals in
terms of their chemistry
and internal structure

• Know the major 

groups of important
rock-forming minerals
and their environmental
signiﬁcance

• Understand the rock

cycle and how it
interacts with plate
tectonics

• Know the three rock laws

• Know the basic rock

types and their
environmental
signiﬁcance

• Know basic rock

structures

CHAPTER 3

74
Case History
The Asbestos Controversy

For many people, the
word asbestos is a red ﬂag
that signals a hazard to
human health because
asbestos may cause fatal

lung disease. In response
to the perceived hazard,

people in the United
States have spent
large sums of money
to remove asbestos
from old buildings,
such as schools
and other public
buildings, where
it was used in
ceiling and ﬂoor
tiles and for
insulation (Figure
3.1). The asbestos
controversy is con-
cerned with when
and where asbestos
should be removed,
but ﬁrst let us
deﬁne asbestos and
discuss the hazards it
causes.

Asbestos is broadly

deﬁned as small, elongated

mineral ﬁbers that are present in
certain silicate minerals. Silicate miner-
als and rocks are those that contain 
silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) in their
chemical composition. Asbestos has
proved to be a useful mineral/ﬁber, par-
ticularly because of its ﬁre-retardant
properties. It is also used in brake
linings and in a variety of insulations.
However, human exposure to asbestos
has caused lung disease, including
cancer. Realization of the health hazard
led to efforts to reduce and remove
asbestos or to ban it outright.

The mineral quartz, which is 

not asbestos but may be present in
crushed rock as small mineral frag-
ments or grains, is also considered a
probable carcinogenic material to
humans. As a result, any natural 
material in the United States contain-
ing 0.1 percent of free silica, including
quartz, must display hazardous
warning signs. Theoretically, trucks
that transport crushed rocks need to
carry warning signs; a truck driver
transporting crushed stones in
Delaware was issued a citation for not
displaying such signs on his truck! A
local Delaware paper reported face-

tiously that beaches composed of silica
sand might also present a public health
hazard, so warnings should be posted
on the beaches. The author of the 
article went on to state that much 
misunderstanding has resulted from
well-meaning efforts to extrapolate
data from environmental toxicity stud-
ies without understanding common
natural characteristics of minerals.1,2
The author’s point was that, although
sand is composed of quartz, it is in the
form of hard, rounded particles, not
potentially hazardous ﬁbrous dust.

The different types of asbestos are

not equally hazardous. In fact,
exposure to “white asbestos,” or
chrysotile, the variety most commonly
used in the United States, is evidently
not very harmful. On the other hand,
“blue asbestos,” the mineral crocido-
lite, is known to cause lung disease.2
A good deal of fear is associated
with nonoccupational exposure to
asbestos, particularly exposure of
children. Identifying potentially
hazardous blue asbestos in schools,
public buildings, and homes and then
removing or covering it to avoid
human exposure is an important goal.

3.1 Minerals
What Is a Mineral? A mineral is a naturally occur-
ring,  solid  Earth  material  that  has  formed  by  geo-
logic processes. A more precise deﬁnition will follow,
after we introduce some basic chemistry necessary
for  deeper  understanding  of  minerals.  For  now,
think  of  minerals  as  the  building  blocks  of  rocks
that form the solid framework of Earth’s crust.

Atoms and Elements
The study of atoms and elements of importance to
geologic  processes  is  a  part  of  geochemistry,  the
study  of  the  chemistry  of  Earth.  Geochemistry

includes  the  study  of  the  natural  distribution  of
chemical  elements  in  minerals,  rocks,  soils,  water,
and  the  atmosphere,  along  with  the  transfer  of
atoms  through  the  environment.  Let  us  start  with
some deﬁnitions.

All  matter—including  rocks,  minerals,  water,
and  you—is  composed  of  atoms.  An  atom  is  the
smallest part of a chemical element that can take
part  in  a  chemical  reaction  or  combine  with  an-
other  atom.  An  element  is  a  chemical  substance
composed  of  identical  atoms  that  may  not  be
separated  into  different  substances  by  ordinary
chemical means. An atom of a particular element
is denoted by its atomic symbol, often the abbrevi-
ation of the first letter or first and second letters

Minerals

75

Funds spent to remove hazardous
blue asbestos constitute a good
investment in environmental health.
Large amounts of money have been
spent to remove white asbestos,
which is not very hazardous and 

may not always require removal. 
Deciding whether to remove asbestos
requires the careful study of ﬁbrous
minerals and rocks in the context in
which they are used; only then can we
understand their potential toxicity 

to people and other living things. 
In the larger context, the asbestos
controversy emphasizes the need to
know more about the minerals we use
in modern society and how they are
linked to the environment.

of  the  English  or  Latin  name  of  that  element.3
For  example,  the  atomic  symbol  for  an  atom  of
carbon  is  C,  and  oxygen’s  atomic  symbol  is  O. 
The  periodic  table  (Table  3.1)  includes  a  list  of 
known elements.

Conceptual Model of an Atom
Idealized diagrams of an atom are shown in Figure
3.2 (page 77). These models show the core, or nucleus,
of  an  atom  and  three  subatomic  particles:  protons,
neutrons,  and  electrons.  The  nucleus  of  the  atom  is
composed of protons, which carry a positive charge,
and  neutrons,  which  carry  no  charge.  Electrons
carry  a  negative  charge  and  are  found  outside  the

nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus of an
atom for a particular element is unique and deﬁnes
its atomic number, as listed in Table 3.1. For example,
hydrogen  has  1  proton  in  its  nucleus,  oxygen  has 
8 protons, silicon has 14, gold has 79, uranium has
92, and so on. Also shown in Table 3.1 are those ele-
ments that are relatively abundant in the minerals
and  rocks  of  Earth’s  crust,  such  as  silicon,  oxygen,
aluminum, and iron; those of major importance to
life,  including  carbon,  oxygen,  and  nitrogen;  and
those  that  have  environmental  importance  in  very
small amounts, referred to as trace elements, such as
cobalt, zinc, lead, and uranium.

An  atom  may  be  conceptualized  as  a  nucleus
surrounded  by  an  electron  cloud  (Figure  3.2a).

FIGURE 3.2 The atom (a) Idealized diagram showing the basic structure of an atom as a nucleus surrounded by an electron
cloud. (b) This conceptualized view is only an approximation or model showing the nucleus of the atom surrounded by orbiting
electrons. (c) A more realistic view of an atom consists of electron shells surrounding the nucleus. (Shown here is oxygen; the size 
of the nucleus relative to electron shells has been greatly exaggerated in order to be viewed.) (After Press, F., and Siever, R. 1994.
Understanding Earth. New York: W. H. Freeman)

Electrons can also be depicted as revolving in orbits
around the nucleus, much as Earth and our neigh-
boring planets revolve around the Sun (Figure 3.2b).
Although this is a satisfactory model for conceptual-
izing what an atom looks like, it is too simple and
inaccurate  from  a  mathematical  standpoint.3 Elec-
trons are actually arranged in energy levels, or shells,
around the nucleus (Figure 3.2c). Because the elec-
trons  are  negatively  charged,  those  closest  to  the
positively  charged  nucleus  are  held  more  tightly
than those in the outer shells.

Although  electrons  carry  a  negative  charge,
they  have  a  very  small  mass  compared  with  pro-
tons and neutrons. As a result, almost the entire
mass  of  an  atom  is  concentrated  in  the  nucleus.
The sum of the number of neutrons and protons
in the nucleus of an atom is known as the atomic
mass  number.  Because  neutrons  carry  no  charge,
an atom is electrically balanced when the number
of  protons  is  equal  to  the  number  of  electrons.
However,  atoms  may  gain  or  lose  loosely  bound
electrons that are in the outer shells. An atom that
has lost or gained electrons is known as an ion. If
an  atom  loses  electrons,  it  becomes  positively
charged  and  is  known  as  a  cation.  For  example,
potassium,  atomic  symbol  K,  becomes 
after
losing one electron. If an atom gains electrons, it
becomes  negatively  charged  and  is  known  as  an
O2-
anion.  Oxygen,  atomic  symbol  O,  becomes 
after gaining two electrons.

Isotopes
What Is an Isotope? Atoms of the same element
always  have  the  same  atomic  number.  However,
they may have a variable number of neutrons and,
therefore,  a  variable  atomic  mass  number.  Two
atoms of the same element with a different number
of  neutrons  in  the  nucleus  are  known  as  isotopes.
Two  isotopes  of  the  element  carbon,  which  is  the
13
building block of the living world, are 
6C.
Atoms  of  both  of  these  isotopes  have  an  atomic
number of 6, but their atomic mass numbers are 12
and 13, respectively. These isotopes are sometimes
written  as  C-12  and  C-13.  Of  the  two,  C-12  is  the
common isotope.

and 

Why  Are  Isotopes  Important  in  Studying  the
Environment? It  is  a  triumph  of  science  that  so
much has been learned from studying isotopes. For
example,  some  isotopes  are  called  radioisotopes
because they are unstable and undergo nuclear decay
(i.e.,  spontaneously  change  and  emit  nuclear  radia-
tion). These are discussed in Chapter 16, with nuclear
energy. Other elements have stable isotopes that do
not undergo nuclear decay. For example, oxygen has
two stable isotopes, 
Study of the abun-
dance  of  these  two  oxygen  isotopes  in  seawater,
glacial ice (frozen water), and very small marine or-
ganisms known as forminifera has provided exciting
evidence about global climate change and how much

mined, we can infer how much ice was on land and
whether the climate was warm or cold.

Mineral Chemistry: Compounds
A  mineral is  formally  deﬁned  as  an  element  or  a
chemical compound that must4:

1. Be naturally formed. This requirement excludes
human-made substances such as human-made
diamonds.

2. Normally be a solid. This requirement excludes

most ﬂuids and all gases.

3. Have a characteristic chemical formula.
4. Have  a  characteristic  crystalline  structure,  in
most  cases.  Although  some  geologists  require
that the substance have a crystalline structure,
the deﬁnition of mineral was revised in the mid-
1990s to include some noncrystalline solids and
even some liquids, such as mercury.

Minerals  can  be  either  elements  or  compounds.
We  discussed  elements  earlier.  A  compound  is  a
substance composed of two or more elements that

can  be  represented  by  a  chemical  formula,  such  as
PbS for lead sulﬁde. Naturally occurring PbS is the
mineral  galena that  we  mine  to  obtain  lead.  Thus,
minerals  may  be  composed  of  either  a  single  ele-
ment,  such  as  the  mineral  diamond,  which  is
composed  of  carbon  (C),  or  several  elements  in  a
compound such as the mineral galena, which is com-
posed of lead sulﬁde (PbS).

Minerals and Chemical Bonding
The  atoms  that  constitute  a  mineral  are  held  to-
gether by chemical bonding. Bonding results from at-
tractive forces between atoms, sharing of electrons,
or both. Types of bonds determine some of the pri-
mary physical properties of minerals; they explain in
part, for example, why diamonds and graphite have
the same chemical formula of pure carbon (C) but are
so different.

There  are  four  main  types  of  chemical  bonds  in
minerals: covalent, ionic, van der Waals, and metallic.
Covalent bonds form when atoms share electrons. For
example, diamond, one of the hardest substances on
Earth,  is  composed  of  covalently  bonded  carbon
atoms (Figure 3.4). Gem-quality diamonds are clear,
hard crystals that jewelers may cut to form beautiful
gemstones of high value. Covalent bonds are stronger
than ionic bonds, which form because of an attraction
between  negatively  and  positively  charged  ions.  An
example of an ionic bond is the attraction of Na+ and
Cl- ions, forming sodium chloride, the mineral halite.
Compounds with ionic bonds are much more soluble
and  easily  dissolved  in  water  than  are  those  with
covalent bonds. Therefore, minerals with ionic bonds
tend to be chemically active and mobile in the envi-
ronment.  van der Waals bonds involve  a  weak  attrac-
tion between chains or sheets of ions that themselves
are likely to be bonded by stronger covalent and ionic
bonds. As previously mentioned, the mineral graphite,
like diamond, is composed of pure carbon. However,
the  similarity  between  graphite  and  diamond  ends
there.  Graphite  is  black  and  consists  of  soft  sheets 
of  carbon  atoms  that  easily  part,  or  break  from  one 
another  (a  mineral  property  called  cleavage;  see
Appendix A). Graphite is the “lead” used in pencils. It
is  also  a  good  dry  lubricant,  sprayed  as  a  dust  into
door locks to help the parts of the lock move freely.
Metallic bonds form  between  metal  atoms.  Gold  con-
tains metallic bonds. Gold’s properties, such as its abil-
ity to conduct an electrical current, and malleability,

the ability to form paper-thin sheets, are both due to
metallic  bonds.  In  a  metallic  bond,  electrons  are
shared by all atoms of the solid rather than by only
speciﬁc atoms, as in covalent bonds. The electrons can
ﬂow, making gold both an excellent conductor of elec-
tricity and easy to pound into a thin sheet.5 As a re-
sult, gold is in high demand for electronic processing.
When learning about chemical bonding of miner-
als, keep in mind that you are dealing with a complex
subject: Bonding in minerals may not be strictly of a
particular type but may have properties of the vari-
ous types. Thus, for a particular mineral, more than
one type of bond is often present.5

Crystalline Structure of Minerals
Now  that  we  know  that  chemical  bonds  hold  the
atoms of minerals together, let’s consider the term
crystalline.  Crystalline refers  to  the  orderly  regular
repeating  geometric  patterns  of  atoms  found  in
most minerals. The smallest unit of this geometric
pattern in a crystal is called the unit cell. A crystal is
composed of stacking unit cells.3 The internal struc-
ture for a given mineral typically contains a particu-
lar symmetry that determines the external form of
the crystal. Figure 3.5 shows some of the common
shapes of crystals for selected minerals.

The  internal  crystal  structure  or  framework  for
halite is shown in Figure 3.6. The structure is a cube
with sodium ions at the corners and chlorine ions
at  intermediate  positions  in  the  crystal  lattice,  the
framework that deﬁnes the regular geometric pattern

of  atoms  in  a  crystal.  Notice  that  in  Figure  3.6b,
which is drawn to relative scale, the sodium ions are
approximately  half  the  size  of  the  chloride  ions. 
The length along one of the edges is approximately
0.56  nanometers  (1  nm 0.000000001  m).  This
distance  is  so  short  that  it  needs  to  be  magniﬁed
approximately 1 million times to be the same size as
a grain of sand or the head of a pin.

3.2 Important Rock-Forming

Minerals

Although there are more than 4,000 minerals, only a
few dozen are common constituents of Earth mate-
rials on or near Earth’s surface. These few minerals
are  often  important  to  many  environmental  con-
cerns  and  are  necessary  in  identifying  most  Earth
materials we know as rocks, which are aggregates of
one  or  more  minerals.  Some  selected  minerals  are
shown in Figure 3.7 (page 81).

Determining  a  mineral’s  chemical  composition
and crystalline structure requires the use of sophis-
ticated  instruments.  When  we  identify  minerals
from  hand  specimens,  samples  that  you  can  hold 
in  your  hand,  we  also  use  appearance  and  some
physical properties to assist us. Mineral properties,
with  their  chemical  compositions,  are  deﬁned  in
Appendix  A,  with  a  table  of  some  of  the  common
minerals likely to be encountered in environmental
geology  work.  Finally,  weathering,  the  way  that  a
mineral  breaks  down  by  physical  and  chemical

tant  in  forming  sediments  and  soil  (see  A  Closer
Look: Weathering).

Although it is not often stated, geologists learn to
identify the common minerals in hand specimens or
under a microscope through the mental process of
pattern  recognition,  based  on  clues  such  as  color,
speciﬁc  gravity,  crystal  form,  cleavage,  and  so  on.
After careful examination of a number of samples,
you learn to recognize a particular mineral, and the
identiﬁcation can be veriﬁed by a simple test or two.
Recognition  of  the  important  rock-forming  miner-
als is an important skill for a geologist.

The  important  groups  of  rock-forming  minerals
are summarized in Table 3.2 (on page 83 ). Each group
is based primarily upon chemistry, and this abbrevi-
ated list serves as a summary for our discussion of
types of minerals. We will now discuss each of the
major mineral groups.

Silicates
The Earth’s crust by weight is composed of oxygen
(45 percent) and silicon (27 percent). These two el-
ements, in combination with a few others, includ-

(5  percent),  magnesium  (3  percent),  sodium  (2  per-
cent),  and  potassium  (2  percent),  account  for  the
chemical composition of minerals that make up about 
98 percent by weight of Earth’s crust. Astoundingly,
about 94 percent by volume of the crust is oxygen!
Geologists  commonly  report  the  abundance  of  a
material  by  either  mass  (weight)  or  volume.  Al-
though  mass  is  normally  measured  in  kilograms,
the  correct  unit  for  weight  is  Newtons.  Newtons
are  calculated  as  kilograms  multiplied  by  gravity;
since  gravity  is  a  constant  on  Earth,  we  often  ig-
nore it in common uses of everyday life. Therefore,

in Europe cheese is sold by the kilogram, and in the
United States it is sold by the pound. Whatever the
units, we all know that a cup ﬁlled with Styrofoam
weighs less than a cup of sand. Volume refers to the
amount  of  space  a  material  takes  up.  One  cubic
meter of Styrofoam and 1 cubic meter of sand have
the  same  volume,  but  the  sand  is  much  heavier
than the Styrofoam.

Minerals  that  include  the  elements  silicon  (Si)
and  oxygen  (O)  in  their  chemical  composition  are
called silicates; these are the most abundant of the
rock-forming  minerals.  The  basic  building  block  of

Weathering

What Is Weathering? Brieﬂy
deﬁned, weathering is the breaking
apart or chemical decomposition 
of minerals and rocks at or near 
the surface of Earth by physical,
biological, and chemical processes.
Weathering processes are important
for various reasons:
• They are some of the primary

processes involved in the
formation of soil (see Chapter 17).
• They prepare—that is, reduce in
size and weaken—Earth material
for easier transport by running
water or slope processes, such 
as landslides.

• Through chemical decomposition
of some rock types, such as lime-
stone, discussed in Section 3.6,
they produce characteristic 
landforms, such as surface pits or
sinkholes, and subsurface voids,
such as caverns (see Chapter 13).

• They are responsible for the

transformation of minerals, such
as transforming feldspars to 
clay minerals.
As stated above, the processes

involved in weathering are physical,
chemical, and biological, or some
combination of these. For example,
physical weathering or breaking of
rocks may be caused by frost action;
water in rock fractures freezes and
expands, breaking apart individual
mineral grains from each other.
Examples of biologically induced
weathering include burrowing of
animals and microbial digestion of
rocks by a variety of organisms. The
term chemical weathering refers to

the partial dissolution of rocks and
their minerals by chemical reactions,
usually in the presence of natural
acidic solutions such as carbonic
acid, commonly found in soils. Even
rainwater is slightly acidic because
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
combines with the water to 
produce a weak carbonic acid

(CO2 + H2O :    H 2CO3).

Stronger
acids may be formed as a result of
water’s mixing with sulﬁde minerals
to form sulfuric acid. The net result
from weathering is that, near the
surface of Earth, rocks are broken
down or dissolved. This breakdown
prepares the sediment that com-
monly constitutes the load that rivers
transport to a lake or an ocean. In 
environmental geology, when
describing Earth materials such as
minerals, rocks, and soils at a site, one
must carefully evaluate how those

materials have weathered and where
the weathered products, such as clay
minerals, are concentrated.

You are probably familiar with the

ﬁght to control rust on your car,
bicycle, or tools. Rust results from the
oxidation, a chemical weathering
process, of iron. Rust is composed of
a group of minerals collectively
named limonite, often a soft earthy
material with a yellow-brown color.
Rust weakens metals, reducing their
strength and usefulness. Similarly,
the chemical weathering of an other-
wise strong rock by the “rusting” of
iron-bearing minerals or formation of
clay along fractures in the rock may
weaken the rock (Figure 3.A). The
weathered rock will not be as strong
or as desirable for a foundation
material for a structure such as a
concrete dam and may be likely to
fail by a landslide.

stained orange) and thin lighter layer of calcite and gypsum min-
erals that form along weathered layers can weaken rock. (Edward

all  silicate  minerals  is  the  pyramid-shaped  silicon–
oxygen  tetrahedron  composed  of  relatively  large
oxygen ions at the corners, with the small silicon ion
in the center (Figure 3.8). The tetrahedron may be
present  in  a  particular  mineral  framework  as  iso-
lated tetrahedra, single or double chains, sheets, or
complex networks (Figure 3.9).3 The silicon–oxygen
tetrahedra  combine  with  other  elements,  such  as
calcium,  magnesium,  sodium,  and  aluminum,  to
form the various silicate minerals. The arrangement
of  the  silicon–oxygen  tetrahedra  in  their  various
forms  determines  the  properties  of  minerals  (see
Figures  3.8 and  3.9).  The  most  important  rock-
forming  silicate  minerals  or  mineral  groups  are
quartz, the feldspar group, micas, and the ferromag-
nesian group.

Quartz. Quartz,  a  form  of  silicon  dioxide  (
SiO2
)
with a network structure of silicon–oxygen tetrahe-
dra,  is  one  of  the  most  abundant  minerals  in  the
crust  of  Earth.  It  can  usually  be  recognized  by  its
hardness, which is greater than that of glass, and by
the  characteristic  way  it  fractures—conchoidally
(Figure  3.10).  Pure  quartz  is  colorless  (i.e.,  clear),
but most quartz crystals contain impurities that can
make  them  white,  rose,  purple,  or  smoky  black,
among  other  colors  (Figure  3.7a).  Some  of  these

colored varieties are semiprecious gemstones, such as
purple amethyst. Large six-sided, clear, pointed crys-
tals of quartz are abundant in nature and are often
sold as crystals. Because it is very resistant to the nat-
ural  weathering  processes  and  the  processes  that
transport mineral grains, such as in rivers, quartz is a
common mineral in river and beach sands.

Feldspars. Feldspars are  aluminosilicates,  contain-
ing  silicon  (Si),  oxygen  (O),  and  aluminum  (Al)  in
combination with potassium (K), sodium (Na), or cal-
cium  (Ca)  in  a  network  structure  of  silicon–oxygen
tetrahedra. The most abundant group of rock-forming
minerals,  constituting  60  percent  of  Earth’s  crust,
feldspars are commercially important in the ceramics
and glass industries. They are generally gray or pink
and are fairly hard (Figure 3.7b).

(Na, K)AlSi3O8,

There  are  two  major  types  of  feldspar:  (1)  alkali
feldspars, 
which  represent  several
feldspar  minerals  rich  in  potassium  (K-feldspar)  or
sodium;  and  (2)  plagioclase  feldspars, 
(Na, Ca)
which are a series of minerals rang-
Al(Si, Al)
ing from sodium rich to calcium rich. In the chemical
formulas, the elements in parentheses, as for example
the  (Na,  Ca)  in  plagioclase,  represent  elements  that
can substitute for one another.

Feldspars  may  weather  chemically  to  form  clay
minerals (Figure 3.7c) with important environmen-
tal implications (see both A Closer Look: Weathering
and A Closer Look: Clay).

Mica. Mica is a name for a group of important rock-
forming  minerals  formed  from  sheets  of  silicon–
oxygen  tetrahedra,  including  the  colorless  mica,
muscovite, 
and  the  ferro-
magnesian mica, biotite, defined below. The micas
are distinguished by a perfect basal cleavage—that
is,  they  cleave  parallel  to  the  base  of  the  crystal
and  peel  into  sheets.  The  mineral  muscovite  was

Ferromagnesian Minerals. Ferromagnesian min-
erals are  a  group  of  silicates  in  which  the  silicon
and  oxygen  combine  with  iron  (Fe)  and  magne-
sium  (Mg).  These  are  the  dark  (black,  brown,  or
green) minerals in most rocks. Black mica, biotite,

of  the  silicon–oxygen  tetrahedra  (Figure  3.7d).

Clay

The term clay is an important term 
in environmental geology and can be
deﬁned in several ways. We use the
term clay-sized particles to describe
particles that are less than 0.004 mm
in diameter—very small indeed. We
also refer to clay as very ﬁne mineral
fragments deﬁned in terms of chemi-
cal composition and internal crystal
structure. The numerous clay miner-
als may be classiﬁed into several
groups, based on chemical charac-
teristics and atomic structure. Some
clays take in a lot of water and 

expand upon wetting, a topic dis-
cussed in Chapter 17.

People have been using clays for

thousands of years because they may
be molded to form anything from
crude pots to ﬁne china to building
blocks, including brick or sun-dried
adobe. Because some clay minerals
have a high capacity for absorbing
liquids, they have a variety of uses for
medicine and industry. For example,
some “kitty litter” is composed pri-
marily of clays. Clay minerals are used
as a ﬁller for paper, and clay is also

used to coat paper, particularly when
a glossy ﬁnish is desired.

Clays are so often used in industrial

processes that most of them have
been synthesized from basic ingredi-
ents. When found in nature, clays are
generally a warning to the environ-
mental geologist. For example, clays
may ﬁll in fractures of rocks, thereby
weakening the rocks. They may also
be present in particular soil layers,
where they may present problems in
stabilizing a slope or preparing for
the foundation of a building.

Because they are not very resistant to weathering
and  erosional  processes,  ferromagnesian  minerals
tend  to  be  altered  or  removed  from  their  location
relatively quickly. They weather readily and combine
with oxygen during the chemical process known as
oxidation.  Oxides  are  mineral  compounds  that  link
oxygen  with  metallic  elements,  as,  for  example,
hematite and limonite (hydrous iron oxide, common
rust).  Ferromagnesian  minerals  combine  readily
with other elements to form clays and soluble salts.
Ferromagnesian  minerals,  when  abundant,  may
produce weak rocks, and builders must be cautious
when  evaluating  a  construction  site  that  contains
rocks  high  in  ferromagnesian  minerals.  Caution  is
especially important for highway, tunnel, and reser-
voir planning.

Other Important Rock-Forming
Minerals
Oxides. Earth  materials  containing  useful  miner-
als,  especially  metals,  that  can  be  extracted  at  a
proﬁt  are  called  ores (discussed  further  in  Chapter
15). Iron and aluminum, probably the most impor-
tant  metals  in  our  industrial  society,  are  extracted
from  ores  containing  iron  and  aluminum  oxides.
The  most  important  iron  ore  is  hematite  (an  iron
oxide, 
),  and  the  most  important  aluminum
ore is bauxite (a mixture of several aluminum oxides).
Magnetite (
also an iron oxide, but economi-
cally  less  important  than  hematite)  is  common  in
many rocks. Magnetite, also known as lodestone, is
a natural magnet that attracts and holds iron parti-
cles.  Where  particles  of  magnetite  or  other  dark
minerals are abundant, they may produce layers of
black sand in streams or beach deposits.

Carbonate  Minerals. Environmentally,  the  most
important  carbonate  mineral is  calcite  (calcium  car-
bonate, 
), shown in Figure 3.7e. This mineral
is the major constituent of limestone and marble, two
very important rock types. Many marine organisms,

The  exposed  sulﬁdes  oxidize,  or  combine
with  oxygen,  in  the  presence  of  water  to
form  compounds,  such  as  sulfuric  acid,
that  may  enter  and  pollute  streams  and
other environments (Figure 3.12). This is a
major  problem  in  the  coal  regions  of
Appalachia and many other regions of the
world  where  sulfur-rich  coal  and  sulﬁde
minerals are mined (see Chapter 16).

National Park, New Mexico. Spelunker (person exploring cave) Neeld Messler is
working his way down into the cave. (Michael Nichols/National Geographic
Image Collection)

Native  Elements. Minerals  formed  of  a
single  element  are  called  native  elements;
gold,  silver,  copper  (Figure  3.7g),  and  dia-
monds  are  examples  of  native  elements.
They  have  long  been  sought  as  valuable
minerals.  They  occur  in  rather  small  accu-
mulations but are occasionally found in suf-
ﬁcient  quantities  to  justify  mining.  As  we
mine these minerals in ever lower-grade de-
posits,  the  environmental  impact  will  in-
crease  because  the  larger  the  mine,  the  greater  the
environmental  impact.  (The  environmental  effects
of mining are discussed in Chapter 15.)

3.3 Rock Cycle
What Is a Rock? A rock is an aggregate of one or
more minerals. That is, some rocks are formed from
a single mineral, and others are composed of several
minerals. Although rocks vary greatly in their com-
position  and  properties,  they  can  be  classiﬁed  into
three  general  types,  or  families,  according  to  their
mineralogy—or mineral composition, chemical com-
position, and texture (size, shape, and arrangement of
grains) (see Appendix B)—and how they were formed
during the rock cycle (Figure 3.13). We can consider
this cycle a worldwide rock-recycling system linking
subsurface processes driven by Earth’s internal heat,
which melts or changes rocks in the tectonic cycle, to
surface  processes  driven  by  solar  energy.  The  rock
cycle produces three general families of rock: igneous
rocks,  sedimentary  rocks,  and  metamorphic  rocks.
Crystallization of molten rock produces igneous rocks
both beneath and on Earth’s surface. Rocks at or near
the surface break down chemically and physically by
weathering, forming sediments that are transported
by wind, water, and ice to depositional basins, such
as the ocean (see A Closer Look: Weathering). The ac-
cumulated  layers  of  sediment  eventually  undergo

earlier, with oxygen isotopes), have shells composed
of carbonate minerals. Chemical weathering of such
rocks by water dissolves the calcite, often producing
caverns, sinkholes, or surface pits (Figure 3.11).

Sulfide  Minerals. Pyrite  (iron  sulﬁde, 
FeS2
),
also known as fool’s gold, is a sulﬁde mineral and is
shown in Figure 3.7f. Sulﬁdes can also be associated
with  environmental  degradation,  which  typically
occurs  when  roads,  tunnels,  or  mines  cut  through
coal-bearing  rocks  that  contain  sulﬁde  minerals.

chemical  and  physical  changes,  forming  sedimentary
rocks. Deeply buried sedimentary rocks may be meta-
morphosed,  or  altered  in  form  by  heat,  pressure,  or
chemically active ﬂuids, to produce metamorphic rocks.
Metamorphic  rocks  may  be  buried  still  more  deeply
and melt, beginning the cycle again. Some variations
of  this  idealized  sequence  are  shown  in  Figure  3.13.
For example, an igneous or metamorphic rock may be
altered into a new metamorphic rock without under-
going weathering or erosion. To summarize, the type
of rock formed in the rock cycle depends on the rock’s
environment.

Rock Cycle and Plate Tectonics
Plate  tectonics  provides  several  environments  for
rock formation, with speciﬁc rock-forming processes
occurring  at  each  type  of  plate  boundary  (Figure
3.14). When we consider the rock cycle alone, we are
concerned  mainly  with  the  recycling  of  rock  and
mineral  materials.  However,  the  tectonic  processes
that drive and maintain the rock cycle are essential
in determining the properties of the resulting rocks.
Therefore,  our  interest  in  plate  tectonics  is  more

than academic; we build our homes, industries, and
roads and grow our crops on these Earth materials.

3.4 Three Rock Laws
Understanding Earth history through geologic time
requires knowing some fundamental laws. Three of
the most important are:

1. The law of crosscutting relationships, which
states  that  a  rock  is  younger  than  any  other
rock that it cuts.

2. The law of original horizontality, which states
that  when  originally  deposited,  sedimentary
layers are nearly horizontal.

3. The  law  of  superposition,  which  states  that 
if a series of layered sediments have not been
overturned, the oldest layers are on the bottom
and the youngest are on top.

We will return to these laws in our discussion of rocks,
their geologic history, and their environmental signiﬁ-
cance. We will begin our discussion with igneous rocks
and then will consider sedimentary rocks and meta-
morphic rocks.

3.5 Igneous Rocks
Igneous rocks have crystallized from magma, a mobile
mass of hot, quasi-liquid Earth material consisting of
a  mixture  of  melted  and  solid  materials.  Magma  is
often  generated  in  the  upper  asthenosphere  or  the

lithosphere (Figure 3.14). You can visualize magma as
hot, slushy, cherry pie ﬁlling consisting of the ﬁlling
liquid mixed with solid cherries.

Intrusive Igneous Rocks
If magma cools slowly and crystallizes well below the
surface of Earth, the result is intrusive igneous rock.
Individual mineral grains can be seen with the naked
eye. Crystals in intrusive igneous rocks that are larger
than the surrounding crystals, well formed, and sur-
rounded by relatively ﬁner-grained crystals are known
as  phenocrysts.  When  intrusive  igneous  rocks  are
exposed on Earth’s surface, we can assume that erosion
has removed the surface material originally covering
them. As the molten magma rises toward the surface,
it  displaces  the  rock  it  intrudes,  often  breaking  off
portions  of  the  intruded  rock  and  incorporating
them as it crystallizes. These foreign blocks, known as
inclusions, are evidence of forcible intrusion.

Common types of intrusive igneous rocks, such as
granite, granodiorite, diorite, and gabbro, and their
general  mineralogy,  are  shown  in  Figure  3.15.  For
example, granite is composed mostly of potassium-
rich alkali feldspar and quartz, with minor amounts
of  sodium-rich  feldspar,  the  micas  muscovite  and
biotite, and amphibole (Figure 3.16a).

Batholiths and Plutons
Magma  that  forms  a  body  of  intrusive  igneous
rock  emplaced  in  the  crust  in  a  particular  region

of cubic kilometers. The largest intrusions are called
batholiths, which are composed of a series of smaller
intrusions known as plutons. Plutons are variable in
size but may be as small as a few kilometers in width.
Some intrusions, such as dikes and sills, are tabular
in  form,  relatively  long  and  narrow  (Figure  3.17).
Dikes intrude through and cut across existing rocks,
whereas sills intrude parallel to the rock layers. Most
dikes we observe in the ﬁeld are relatively small, less
than 1 m to a few meters in width. Dikes can form
complex patterns that either cut across one another
or are in a radial pattern; these patterns are known
as  dike  swarms.  Most  batholiths  are  formed  of
granitic  rocks,  but  dikes  and  sills  may  be  basaltic.
Sometimes it is possible to distinguish younger from
older plutons by examining them in the ﬁeld where
they are exposed by erosion. For example, the light
gray  pluton  in  Figure  3.17 contains  inclusions,  or
pieces of the dark gray pluton, within it. Inclusions
allow geologists to determine the relative ages of the
plutons. A pluton that contains inclusions of another
pluton  within  it  must  be  the  younger  of  the  two.

FIGURE 3.17 Igneous intrusions Idealized block diagram
showing several types of igneous intrusions. The older pluton is
known to be older; it is cut by the younger pluton, and inclusions
of the older pluton are found in the younger. The youngest
intrusions in the diagram are the dike and sill. Notice that the
younger pluton is exposed at the surface in a canyon similar to
the exposure of granitic rocks in Yosemite shown in Figure 3.16b.
Assuming that the pluton was emplaced at a depth of more 
than 10 km (about 6.2 mi), one ﬁnds an appreciation for the
tremendous amount of erosion necessary to expose granitic
rocks in canyons such as Yosemite Valley.

Therefore, the light gray pluton is younger than the
dark gray pluton. The youngest intrusion in Figure
3.17 is the dike and sill that cuts across the younger
pluton. This analysis demonstrates the law of cross-
cutting  relationships,  which  states  that  a  rock  is
younger than any other rock that it cuts.

Why Magma Rises and Intrudes
Other Rocks
One commonly asked question is, “Why do masses
of  partially  melted  rock  or  magma  rise  or  intrude
the surrounding rocks?” A probable explanation is
that once the internal heat of Earth has formed a
mass of magma, it is hotter and less dense than the
surrounding  rocks  and,  therefore,  rises  much  as  a
helium-ﬁlled balloon rises in the atmosphere or as a
scuba  diver’s  air  bubbles  rise  through  the  water.
Presumably, once the density differences are equal-
ized, the mass of magma or intrusion ceases its up-
ward journey toward the surface of Earth, and the
magma completes the crystallization of minerals to
form intrusive igneous rocks. Often, before crystal-
lization  to  form  intrusive  igneous  rocks  occurs,
however, some magma reaches the surface of Earth
to  cause  volcanic  eruptions  and  form  extrusive
igneous rocks.

Extrusive Igneous Rocks
Igneous rocks that crystallize at the surface of Earth
are  called  extrusive.  Extrusive  igneous  rocks  often
form from lava, or molten magma ﬂowing from vol-
canoes. They can also form from pyroclastic debris,
composed  of  fragmented  magma  that  has  rapidly
solidiﬁed as it was blown out of a volcano.

Extrusive  igneous  rocks  are  ﬁne-grained  due  to
rapid  cooling  and  crystallization,  and  individual
crystals  or  grains  usually  cannot  be  seen  with  the
naked  eye.  However,  extrusive  igneous  rocks  may
have  previously  formed  phenocrysts  of  minerals
that  crystallized  when  the  magma  was  deeper
within  Earth,  and  crystallization  was  slower.  The
texture  of  such  a  rock,  which  has  relatively  few,
often  well-formed,  phenocrysts  surrounded  by  a
mass  of  ﬁne-grained  crystals,  is  called  porphyritic.
There are different types of extrusive igneous rock,
such as rhyolite, dacite, andesite, and basalt, just as
there  are  different  types  of  intrusive  igneous  rock
(Figure 3.15). The speciﬁc type is based on differences

in the rocks’ chemical composition. Notice in Figure
3.15 that the minerals in rhyolite are the same as in
granite, as is the case with dacite and granodiorite,
andesite and diorite, and basalt and gabbro. It is the
size of the crystals formed by the process of crystal-
lization,  either  at  the  surface  or  deep  beneath  the
surface of Earth, that differentiates extrusive from
intrusive igneous rocks. We often identify intrusive
igneous  rocks  from  hand  specimens  by  examining
the phenocrysts present. For example, andesite may
have phenocrysts of feldspar (Figure 3.18), whereas
basalt is more likely to have phenocrysts of pyrox-
ene  or  olivine.  We  will  discuss  extrusive  rocks  and
their differences in more detail in Chapter 8 when
we discuss volcanoes.

Extrusive  rocks  form  from  lava  or  magma  that
crystallizes  at  the  surface.  A  lava  ﬂow  may  be
mixed with cemented fragments of broken lava and
ash, called volcanic breccia, or with thick vesicular,
or cavity-ﬁlled, zones produced as gas escapes from
cooling lava.

Pyroclastic debris, also known as tephra, ejected
from  a  volcano  produces  a  variety  of  extrusive 
rocks  (Figure  3.19).  Debris  consisting  of  rock  and
glass fragments less than 4 mm (about 0.16 in.) in
diameter  are  called  volcanic  ash;  when  this  ash  is
compacted,  cemented,  or  welded  together,  it  is
called  tuff.  Pyroclastic  activity  also  produces  larger

fragments that, when mixed with ash and cemented
together, form the rock called volcanic breccia.

Extrusive igneous rocks may develop into piles of
layered  volcanic  rocks  surrounding  volcanoes  that
form entire islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands in
the  Paciﬁc.  They  may  also  form  basaltic  plateaus
that  cover  many  thousands  of  square  kilometers
with a series of basaltic ﬂows of great thickness (see
Figure  3.16c,  part  of  the  Snake  River  Basaltic
Plateau in Washington).

clay  known  as  bentonite,  an  ex-
tremely  unstable  material.  When
bentonite  is  wet,  it  expands  to
many  times  its  original  volume
and is unstable.

It is difﬁcult to make generaliza-
tions about the suitability of extru-
sive igneous rocks for speciﬁc uses.
Careful field examination is always
necessary  before  large  structures
are built on such rocks.6 Planning,
designing,  and  constructing  engi-
neering projects on extrusive rocks,
especially  pyroclastic  debris,  can
be  complicated  and  risky.7 This
fact  was  tragically  emphasized  on
June 5, 1976, when the Teton Dam 
in Idaho failed, killing 14 people and
inﬂicting  approximately  $1  billion
in property damage. Just before the
failure,  a  whirlpool  several  meters
across was seen in the reservoir, strongly suggesting
that a tunnel of free-ﬂowing water had developed be-
neath the dam. In fact, the dam was built upon highly
fractured volcanic rocks. Water began moving under
the foundation as the reservoir ﬁlled. When the sub-
surface  moving  water  came  into  contact  with  the
dam, it quickly eroded a tunnel through the base of
the  dam,  causing  the  whirlpool.  The  dam  collapsed
just  minutes  later,  and  a  wall  of  water  up  to  20  m 
(66 ft) high rushed downstream, destroying homes,
farms,  equipment,  animals,  and  crops  for  160  km
(100 mi) downstream from the dam failure.

3.6 Sedimentary Rocks
Sedimentary rocks constitute about 75 percent of
all  rocks  exposed  at  the  surface  of  Earth  (Figure
3.21).  Their  common  environments  are  shown  in
Figure  3.14.  There  are  two  types  of  sedimentary
rock:  detrital,  or  clastic,  sedimentary  rocks,  which
form from broken parts of previously existing rocks;
and  chemical,  or  nonclastic,  sedimentary  rocks,
which  are  deposited  when  chemical  or  biochemical
processes  cause  minerals  to  form  from  substances
dissolved in water.

Sedimentary  rocks  form  when  sediments  are
transported,  deposited,  and  then  transformed  into
rock, by natural cementation or compaction or both.

National Monument, Sierra Nevada, California. (A. G. Sylvester)

Igneous Rocks 
and the Environment
Intrusive  and  extrusive  igneous  rocks  have  a  wide
variety  of  properties,  and  generalizations  are  difﬁ-
cult.  We  can,  however,  make  three  environmental
points associated with these rocks:

• Intrusive igneous rocks, especially granite, are
generally strong rocks that make a good foun-
dation for many structures, such as dams and
large buildings. Blocks of these rocks are often
resistant to weathering and are used for a vari-
ety of construction purposes.6,7

• Lava  ﬂows  that  have  cooled  and  solidiﬁed
often  exhibit  extensive  columnar 
jointing
(Figure  3.20).  Columnar  jointing  is  a  type  of
fracturing that occurs during cooling that may
lower the strength of the rock. Solidiﬁed lava
ﬂows may also have subterranean voids known
as lava tubes. Lava tubes can collapse from the
weight  of  the  overlying  material  or  can  carry
large  amounts  of  groundwater.  Both  features
can  cause  problems  during  the  planning,  de-
sign, and construction phases of a project.

• Tuff  is  generally  a  soft,  weak  rock  that  may
have very low strength.6 The strength of a tuff
rock depends upon the degree to which it has
become  cemented  or  welded.  Some  tuff  may
be altered through weathering into a type of

FIGURE 3.21 Sequence of sedimentary rock The Grand
Canyon of the Colorado River exposes a spectacular section of sedimen-
tary rocks. The top sedimentary unit is the Kaibab limestone, below 
which is a series of sandstones, shales, and the famous Red Wall limestone.
(Hal Gage/Photolibrary)

After  deposition,  both  physical  and
chemical changes in sediments occur in
response  to  increased  pressure  and
temperature.  The  increase  in  pressure
and  temperature  is  not  sufﬁcient  to
produce  metamorphic  rocks.  These
changes in the sediments are a result of
their being buried and of ﬂuids migrat-
ing through them. These processes are
collectively  referred  to  as  diagenesis.
Some  of  these  processes  are  shown  in
idealized form in Figure 3.22:

river  ﬂoodplains, 

• Sediment from a river is delivered
to  a  sedimentary  basin—in  this
case,  an  ocean.  The  basin  is  only
one  of  many  types  of  sedimentary
environments on Earth. Other sed-
include
imentary  environments 
lakes, 
sand
dunes,  and  glacial  environments.
• As  the  river  enters  the  ocean  at
point  A,  the  coarser  sediment
(sand) is deposited ﬁrst at point B,
and  ﬁner  silt  and  clay  are  de-
posited farther from the shoreline
where the transport processes are
weakest, at point C. The sediment
is  deposited  in  beds,  or  layers. 

Grains of sediment (especially silt
and clay) have abundant space
or porosity (~50% of volume for silt and clay)

CHAPTER 3

Minerals and Rocks

space  between  the  grains,
known  as  porosity,  is  ﬁlled
with  water;  therefore,  for
each cubic meter (about 35 ft3)
of  the  sediment,  half  of  the
space is occupied by water be-
tween  the  grains.  The  oldest
sedimentary beds are located
at  the  bottom  of  the  sedi-
mentary  basin.  As  stated  in
the  law  of  superposition,  if  a
series  of  sedimentary  beds
have  not  been  overturned,
the youngest beds are on the
top  and  the  oldest  on  the
bottom. The sedimentary de-
posits  near  the  bottom  are
subjected to both an increase
in pressure due to the weight
of  the  overlying  sediments
and  an  increase  in  tempera-
ture  resulting  from  natural
heat ﬂow from the interior of
Earth.  The  increase  in  pressure  causes  the
grains to be squeezed tightly together, forcing
out some of the water. The rate at which water
is forced out is dependent, in part, on the ease
with which the water passes through the pore
spaces  between  the  particles.  Increased  pres-
sure and temperature may facilitate the dissolv-
ing  of  some  minerals,  forming  mineral-rich
ﬂuids that migrate through the sediments and
begin  to  cement  them.  Common  cementing
materials might be carbonate (
) or sili-
con oxide (
). As these diagenetic processes
continue,  the  sediments  are  transformed  into
sedimentary  rock.  If  they  are  buried  deeply
enough,  diagenesis  may  proceed  to  metamor-
phism,  which  is  discussed  in  the  following 
section.

Detrital Sedimentary Rocks
Detrital sedimentary rocks are classiﬁed according to
their grain size as either shale, siltstone, sandstone,
or  conglomerate  (Table  3.3A).  Shale  and  siltstone,
along with poorly bedded mudstone and claystone,
are  by  far  the  most  abundant  detrital  rocks,  ac-
counting  for  about  50  percent  of  all  sedimentary
rocks.  Composed  of  clay-  and  silt-sized  particles,
they are the ﬁnest grained of the four detrital rock
types. Remember that we deﬁned clay in terms of its

FIGURE 3.23 Tilted sedimentary rocks Lines generally running from lower left to upper
right are bedding planes of these sedimentary rocks. The layers are inclined about 30 degrees. The
law of original horizontality states that these bedding planes were close to horizontal when the
sediment grains forming the rocks were deposited. We assume that they are at 30 degrees today
because they have been uplifted and tilted by tectonic processes. (Edward A. Keller)

Individual beds are nearly horizontal when de-
posited, as stated in the law of original horizon-
tality.  The  sequences  of  beds  are  known  as
strata. The top bed, and others, may have been
produced by a single large ﬂood event from the
river.  The  different  layers  are  separated  by
bedding  planes (Figure  3.23)  that  denote  the
top  and  bottom  of  a  particular  sedimentary
bed. The layering of sedimentary rocks, there-
fore, results from changes in deposition associ-
ated with grain size, difference in composition
of the sediments, or a series of events, such as
large  ﬂoods  that  periodically  bring  a  greater
amount  of  sediment  into  the  sedimentary
basin.  A  particular  sedimentary  bed  may
change or grade laterally from one type of sedi-
ment  to  another—for  example,  the  sand,  silt,
and clay illustrated in Figure 3.22. The lateral
change  in  sediment  is  referred  to  as  a  facies
change; in this case, a sandy facies has changed
into a silt and clay facies in the same sedimen-
tary unit.

• As  the  sedimentary  basin  sinks  or  sea  level
rises, sediments (strata) up to several kilome-
ters in thickness may be deposited. Recall the
spectacular section of sedimentary rocks in the
Grand Canyon shown in Figure 3.21.

• When  the  sediment  was  originally  deposited,
there was open space between the grains. This

Shale: compacted or cemented silt and/or clay with ﬁne
laminations along which rock easily splits (ﬁssility). Rocks
composed of clay that lack ﬁssility are called claystone.
Mudstone is an unlaminated mixture of silt and clay.

stated that geologists also use the term in a textural
sense to mean very ﬁne-grained sediment (less than
1/256 mm in diameter).

When layers of clay or silt (slightly coarser-grained
sediment, 1/256 to 1/16 millimeters in diameter) are

compacted or cemented, they form shale or siltstone.
Siltstone is more massive, generally lacking bedding
planes,  whereas  shale  characteristically  has  closely
spaced bedding planes.

Sandstone and conglomerate are coarser grained
than  shale  and  siltstone  and  make  up  about  25

Sand-sized particles of sandstone are 1/16 to 2 mm
in  diameter.  Conglomerate  contains  gravel-sized
particles greater than 2 mm in diameter, cemented
together with material such as silica, calcium car-
bonate, iron oxide, or clay.

Chemical Sedimentary Rocks
Chemical sedimentary rocks are classiﬁed according
to  their  mineral  composition;  they  include  halite
(rock  salt, 
);  gypsum  (hydrated  calcium  sul-
NaCl
fate,  which  is  calcium  sulfate  containing  water,
# 2H2O
); and limestone, which is composed
CaSO4
mostly  of  the  mineral  calcite  (calcium  carbonate,
CaCO3
)  (Table  3.3B)  (Figure  3.16f).  Limestones
make up about 25 percent of all sedimentary rocks
and are by far the most abundant of the chemical
sedimentary rocks.

Sedimentary Rocks 
and the Environment
Three  primary  environmental  concerns  associated
with sedimentary rocks are as follows:

• Shale, mudstone, and siltstone are often very
weak  rocks.  They  may  cause  many  environ-
mental problems, and their presence is a red
ﬂag  to  the  applied  Earth  scientist.  However,
some shale can be a very stable, strong rock,
suitable for many construction purposes, de-
pending  on  the  degree  of  cementation  and
type  of  cementing  material.  In  general,  the
presence of any shale, mudstone, or siltstone
at  a  building  site  requires  a  detailed  evalua-
tion  to  determine  the  physical  properties  of
the rock.

• Limestone  is  not  always  well  suited  for  human
use  and  activity.  Although  this  rock  may  be
strong enough to support construction, it easily
weathers to form subsurface cavern systems and
solution pits on the surface caused by chemical
weathering. Solution pits are also known as sink-
holes (see Chapter 13). Constructing highways,
reservoirs, and other structures is problematic in
areas  where  caverns  or  sinkholes  are  encoun-
tered.  Another  problem  common  in  limestone
areas is that subsurface water in cavern systems
may  quickly  become  polluted  by  urban  runoff,
with little or no chance of natural puriﬁcation of
the polluted water.

• Cementing  materials  in  detrital  sedimentary
rocks  may  be  troublesome.  Silica  cement  is
the strongest; calcium carbonate tends to dis-
solve in weak acid; and clay may be unstable
and wash away. It is always advisable to care-
fully evaluate the strength and stability of ce-
menting  materials  in  detrital  sedimentary
rocks.

3.7 Metamorphic Rocks
Igneous  and  metamorphic  rocks  together  account
for  more  than  90  percent  of  all  rocks  in  Earth’s
crust. Metamorphic  rocks are  changed  rocks;  that
is,  heat,  pressure,  and  chemically  active  ﬂuids  pro-
duced  by  the  tectonic  cycle  or  resulting  from  the
presence of an intrusion may change the mineralogy
and texture of preexisting rocks, in effect producing
new rocks. Generalized geologic environments along
with pressure–temperature conditions that result in
metamorphism  are  idealized  in  Figure  3.24.  The
three major types of metamorphism are:

1. High-pressure, low-temperature metamorphism;

characteristic of subduction zones.

2. High-temperature,  high-pressure  metamor-
phism; characteristic  of  regional  metamorphism
that might be produced during continental colli-
sion.  Notice  that  in  this  environment,  rock
metamorphism changes low-grade sedimentary
rocks to high-grade metamorphic rocks with in-
creasing  temperature  and  pressure.  The  rocks
progressively change from sedimentary rock to
low-grade  metamorphic  rock  known  as  slate, 
to  an  intermediate-grade  metamorphic  rock
known  as  schist,  and  ﬁnally  to  a  high-grade
metamorphic rock known as gneiss. The original
shale,  a  sedimentary  rock,  is  thus  transformed
to  slate,  and  then  schist,  and  then  gneiss,
through progressive regional metamorphism as
a result of increasing temperature and pressure.
low-pressure  metamor-
phism, or contact metamorphism. When magma
intrudes  the  upper  crust,  it  heats  nearby
surrounding rocks, but, because it is close to the
surface,  the  pressure  is  relatively  low.  This  in-
creased  temperature  causes  the  formation  of
particular  types  of  metamorphic  minerals  and
rocks in the contact zone.

with high temperatures and pressures resulting from continental collisions. Rocks surrounding a body of cooling magma (3) experience
high-temperature contact metamorphism at relatively low pressure. (Modiﬁed after Davidson, J. P., Reed, W. E., and Davis, P. M. 1997.

CHAPTER 3

Minerals and Rocks

Foliated Metamorphic Rocks
Slate  is  a  relatively  low-grade  metamorphic  rock  re-
sulting  from  the  metamorphism  of  the  sedimentary
rock shale, as shown in Figure 3.25 and outlined in
Table 3.4. As illustrated in Figure 3.25, tectonic stress
applied to shale under relatively low temperatures and
pressures produces a new rock. Slate is referred to as a
foliated metamorphic  rock,  in  which  the  mineral
grains, such as mica, are aligned either in parallel, lay-
ering, or banding structure, producing a rock cleavage,
or foliation. If the slate is subjected to higher tempera-
tures and pressures, it may change to a higher-grade
metamorphic  rock  known  as  schist.  Processes  of  re-
crystallization  intensify  the  parallel  alignment  of
mineral grains and crystal size increases, often render-
ing  the  crystals  relatively  easy  to  identify  (Figure
3.16g). If the original shale is subjected to even higher
temperatures and pressures, then  gneiss, with a foli-
ated  texture  characterized  by  banding  of  light  and
dark minerals, may form (Figure 3.16h).

Nonfoliated Metamorphic Rocks
Not all metamorphic rocks are foliated. Marble, con-
sisting mostly of the mineral calcite (CaCO3), is an
example  of  a  nonfoliated  metamorphic  rock.  It  re-
sults  from  the  metamorphism  of  limestone,  usually
due to regional metamorphism or, in some instances,
contact metamorphism (Figure 3.26). The metamor-
phic  processes  cause  the  calcite  to  recrystallize  into

FIGURE 3.25 Transformation of shale to slate
Idealized diagram showing the transformation from the
sedimentary rock shale to the metamorphic rock slate. The
foliation planes in the slate develop as a result of tectonic
stress, with recrystallization of the minerals as a result of rela-
tively low-grade metamorphism. Note that the foliation 
planes form at right angles to the orientation of the tectonic
stress (bedding planes are not usually at right angles to the
tectonic stress as shown here, but foliation is). In a gross sense,
the initial grains in the rock look something like a house of
cards. When you place your palm on the house of cards and
apply pressure, it collapses and the cards lie flat and stacked
on the table, much like the foliation planes in the slate.

to the foliation, or rock cleavage, with planes
dipping  away  from  the  road  cut.  Foliation
planes inclined toward the road result in un-
stable  blocks  that  might  fall  or  slide  toward
the road (Figure 3.28). And, since groundwa-
ter  tends  to  ﬂow  down  foliation,  foliation
planes inclined toward the road would cause a
drainage problem. In the construction of dams,
the  preferred  orientation  is  nearly  vertical

larger  crystals.  If  the  parent  rock  is  relatively  pure
limestone,  then  a  beautiful  white  marble  that
Michelangelo might have chosen for his work is pro-
duced.  Quartzite is  another  important  nonfoliated
metamorphic  rock.  Quartzite  forms  from  the  re-
gional metamorphism of quartz-rich sandstone.

Metamorphic Rocks 
and the Environment
There  are  several  points  to  be  made  concerning
metamorphic rocks and the environment:

• Slate is generally an excellent foundation ma-
terial. It has also been used for constructing
chalkboards,  beds  for  pool  tables,  roofing
material,  and  decorative  stone  counters
(Figure 3.27). Schist, a coarse-grained meta-
morphic rock, is composed of soft minerals,
making  it  a  poor  foundation  material  for
large  structures  (Figure  3.16g).  Gneiss,  a
coarse-grained, banded metamorphic rock, is
usually a hard, tough rock similar in most re-
spects to granite and suitable for most engi-
neering purposes (Figure 3.16h).

• Foliation planes of metamorphic rocks are po-
tential  planes  of  weakness.  The  strength  of
the rock, its potential to slide, and the move-
ment of water through the rock all vary with
the orientation of the foliation. Consider, for
example,  the  construction  of  road  cuts  and
dams  in  terrain  where  foliated  metamorphic
rocks are common. For road cuts in metamor-
phic rocks, the preferred orientation is parallel

favorable orientation is for the 
foliation to be parallel to the axis

the axis of the dam. This results
because water may ﬂow along
the foliation, causing water to
leak from the reservoir.

minimizes  the  chance  of  leaks  and  unstable

foliation  planes  are  parallel  to  the  reservoir
walls (see Case History: St. Francis Dam).

3.8 Rock Strength 

and Deformation

The strength of Earth materials, which is generally
deﬁned as resistance to failure, such as fracturing,
sliding,  or  ﬂowing,  varies  with  composition,  tex-
ture, and location. Weak rocks, such as those con-
taining  many  altered  ferromagnesian  minerals,
may  slowly  ﬂow  under  certain  conditions  and  be

very difﬁcult to tunnel through. In contrast, some
rocks are very strong and need little or no support.
However,  even  strong  rocks,  when  buried  deep
within Earth, may also ﬂow and be deformed (e.g.,
rupture,  rotation,  or  change  in  shape  such  as
shortening,  thickening,  or  thinning).  Thus,  the
strength of a rock may be quite different in differ-
ent environments.

Deformation  of  Earth  materials  may  be  elastic,
plastic,  ductile,  or  brittle.  Elastic deformation  oc-
curs  when  the  deformed  material  returns  to  its
original shape after the stress is removed. Examples
include compressing a rubber ball, stretching a rub-
ber  band,  and  drawing  and  releasing  an  archer’s
bow.  Plastic deformation,  on  the  other  hand,  is
characterized  by  permanent  change.  That  is,  the
material does not return to its original shape after

Case History
St. Francis Dam

Rock Strength and Deformation

101

On the night of March 12, 1928, more
than 500 lives were lost and $10 mil-
lion in property damage was sus-
tained as ravaging ﬂoodwaters raced
down the San Francisquito Canyon
near Saugus, California. The 63 m
(207 ft)-high St. Francis Dam, with a
main section 214 m (702 ft) long and
holding 47 million cubic meters (al-
most 1.7 billion cubic feet) of water,
had failed (Figure 3.B).

Why Did the Dam Fail? The
causes of the failure were clearly
geologic. The east canyon wall was
metamorphic rock with foliation

planes parallel to the wall. Before 
the failure, both recent and ancient
landslides indicated the instability 
of the rock. The west wall was sedi-
mentary rock with prominent high
topographic ridges that suggested 
the rock was strong and resistant.
Unfortunately, the rocks disinte-
grated when they became wet. This
characteristic was not discovered and
tested until after the dam had failed.
The contact between the two rock
types is a fault with an approximately
1.5 m-thick zone (about 5 ft) of
crushed and altered rock. The fault
was shown on California’s 1922 fault

map but either was not recognized or
was ignored. Three processes com-
bined to cause the tragedy: slipping
of the metamorphic rock, the pri-
mary cause of failure; disintegration
and sliding of the sedimentary rock;
and leakage of water along the fault
zone, which washed out the crushed
rock. Together, these processes de-
stroyed the bond between the con-
crete and the rock and precipitated
the failure.7,8 This disaster did serve
to focus public attention on the need
for geologic investigation as part of
siting reservoirs. Such investigations
are now standard procedure.

the  stress  has  been  removed.  Examples  of  plastic
deformation  include  compressing  snow  into  a
snowball and stretching chewing gum. If a material
ruptures  before  plastic  deformation,  it  is  called
brittle;  materials  that  rupture  after  considerable
plastic deformation are known as ductile. The type
of deformation that occurs and the rate of deforma-
tion  depend  upon  a  variety  of  circumstances,  in-
cluding  the  type  of  rock,  the  magnitude  of  the
stress it is experiencing, how quickly or slowly the
stresses  are  applied,  and  the  temperature  of  the
material. For example, glass at room temperature is
hard and behaves like a brittle substance, but glass
heated  to  a  high  enough  temperature  is  soft  and
ductile,  deforming  plastically  before  rupturing.
That  is  why  glassblowers  can  make  such  beautiful
objects.

The  strength  of  rocks  is  often  recorded  as  the
compressive  strength,  tensile  strength,  or  shear
strength, referring to the magnitude of a particu-
lar stress necessary to cause deformation (Figure
3.30). Before an earthquake, rocks undergo stress,

followed  by  strain  (deformation).  Rupture  of  the
rocks can produce an earthquake. Explaining this
phenomenon  further  is  beyond  the  scope  of  our
discussion  here,  but  you  will  encounter  it  if  you
take structural geology or a course in earthquake
geology.

3.9 Rock Structures
There are many types of rock structures. Common
structures include fractures, folds, and unconformi-
ties. We will discuss each in turn.

Fractures
Two  common  types  of  rock  fracture  are  joints,
along  which  no  displacement  occurs,  and  faults,
along  which  displacement  has  occurred  (see
Chapter  6).  Several  rock  fractures,  in  this  case
joints,  are  shown  in  Figure  3.31.  A  fault  that
displaces  rock  on  Santa  Cruz  Island  in  Southern

its  suitability  as  a  foundation  for  everything
from buildings to bridges, dams, and runways
for aircraft.

• Once a fracture has developed, it is subject to
weathering, which widens it and may produce
unstable  clay  minerals  that  may  easily  wash
out  or  facilitate  landslides.  When  large  dis-
placements of 1 m (3.3 ft) or so occur on frac-
tures,  large  earthquakes  are  produced  (see
Chapter 6).

Folds
When rocks are shortened by lateral compression, a
series  of  folds  may  develop.  As  a  demonstration,
push  horizontally  on  a  tablecloth  and  observe  the
series  of  arch-shaped  convex  folds,  called  anti-
clines, and bowl-shaped concave folds, called synclines,
that  form.  These  folds  are  shown  on  Figure  3.33a
and  will  be  discussed  in  greater  detail  with  earth-
quakes in Chapter 6. If active folding is presently oc-
curring in an area, a series of linear anticlinal ridges
separated  by  synclinal  valleys  may  be  present,  as
shown in Figure 3.33a. At the surface folds are eroded
by running water (geologist say the fold is breached).
Differential  erosion  can  produce  interesting  topo-
graphic expression of a fold as shown in Figure 3.33b.
A series of folds is a fold belt, and the basic structure
that produces linear valleys and ridges can remain as
part  of  the  landscape  for  several  hundred  million
years.  The  long-lasting  nature  of  a  fold  belt  is  illus-
trated  by  the  eroded  fold  belt  that  part  of  the  Ap-
palachian  Mountains  formed  in  the  southeastern
United States (Figure 3.33c; also see Chapter 2). The
Appalachian  Mountains  formed  when  Europe  col-
lided  with  America  over  200  million  years  ago.  The
harder  rocks  formed  linear  ridges,  and  the  softer
rocks  formed  the  linear  valleys  of  the  Appalachian
landscape we observe today. These linear ridges and
valleys  played  an  important  part  in  our  Civil  War;
armies  might  have  been  only  a  ridge  apart  without
necessarily knowing each other’s position.

Unconformities
An unconformity is a signiﬁcant break or gap in the
geologic  record.  It  is  a  time  when  erosion  rather
than deposition occurred. Unconformities are im-
portant in understanding the geologic history of a

California  is  shown  in  Figure  3.32.  Fractures  in
rocks,  which  vary  from  small  hairline  breaks  to
large fault zones up to a kilometer or so wide and
hundreds of kilometers long, have environmental
significance because:

• They are conduits for ﬂuids, most often water,

possibly including pollutants.

• They are zones of weakness in rocks. Fractures
generally lower the strength of a rock and, thus,

region;  they  are  also  important  because  they  are
often a natural boundary between two rock types
with  different  characteristics.  Springs  and  oil  de-
posits are sometimes associated with unconformi-
ties  where  downward-migrating  water  or  upward-
migrating oil is pushed to the surface.

Unconformities represent a time period when ero-
sion was occurring, and an erosion surface may have
developed if the land was above sea level. Today, all
land on Earth that is above sea level is part of an ero-
sion surface. For example, the Piedmont province in
the southeastern United States is a developing ero-
sion surface. If sea level were to rise and cover the
land near Charlotte, North Carolina, the igneous and
metamorphic  rocks  that  are  millions  of  years  old
would  be  buried  by  young  marine  sediments.  The

then-buried erosion surface would be recognized as
an unconformity in the rock record. There are three
types of unconformity:

• Nonconformity: A  nonconformity  forms  be-
tween older igneous or metamorphic rocks and
younger sedimentary rocks (Figure 3.34).

• Angular  unconformity: Younger  sedimentary
rocks  are  located  upon  an  erosion  surface,
below which older sedimentary rocks are tilted
or folded (Figures 3.34 and 3.35).

• Disconformity: A  disconformity  is  formed  as 
an  erosion  surface  between  parallel  layers  of
sedimentary rock. They may be difﬁcult to rec-
ognize as there may be little visible discontinu-
ity compared with nonconformity and angular
unconformity.

science and values to the
asbestos controversy?

Summary

Minerals and rocks are the basic
building blocks of the solid Earth 
and form some of our most basic 
resources on which we rely heavily 
for our modern civilization. Minerals
and rocks also play an important role
in many Earth surface processes,
such as landslides, earthquakes, and
volcanic activity. Finally, the study of
minerals and rocks provides impor-
tant information concerning the his-
tory of Earth.

A mineral is a naturally occurring,

normally crystalline element or
compound formed by geologic
processes. Although there are more
than 4,000 minerals, we need to know
only a few of them to identify most
rocks and help evaluate environmen-
tal problems. The major groups of
minerals of interest to environmental
geology are silicates, oxides, carbon-
ates, sulﬁdes, and native elements.

Rocks are aggregates of one or

more minerals that are classiﬁed into
three general types or families, ac-
cording to how they were formed in
the rock cycle. These are igneous, sed-
imentary, and metamorphic. These

three rock types are constantly being
created and destroyed as part of the
rock cycle. The rock cycle is intimately
related to plate tectonics.

Three important rock laws

fundamental to understanding Earth
history are (1) the law of crosscutting
relationships, (2) the law of original
horizontality, and (3) the law of
superposition.

Igneous rocks are rocks that

crystallized from magma. They can be
either extrusive, meaning that they
cooled at the surface of Earth, or
intrusive, meaning that they cooled
beneath Earth’s surface.

Sedimentary rocks form from parts

of other rocks or by chemical pro-
cesses. They can be either detrital,
formed from the lithiﬁcation of rock
fragments, or chemical, produced
when chemical or biochemical pro-
cesses cause solid materials to form
from substances dissolved in water.

Metamorphic rocks are rocks

changed by heat, pressure, chemically
active ﬂuids, or some combination of
those factors. They can be foliated,
having layered or banded alignment

of mineral grains, or nonfoliated, with
mineral grains lacking layering or
banding.

Minerals and rocks have physical

and chemical properties that may
have environmental importance.
Examples include the relationship 
between pyrite and acid mine
drainage, calcite/limestone and cav-
ern formation, basalt and lava tubes,
and schist/foliation and landslides.
The strength of a rock depends

upon several factors, including
composition, texture, structure, and
where it is in or on Earth.

Common rock structures include

fractures, faults, folds, and unconfor-
mities. These structures may have im-
portant environmental consequences.

Weathering is the physical break-
ing apart or chemical decomposition
of minerals and rocks at or near the
surface of Earth by physical, biologi-
cal, and chemical processes. Weather-
ing is most important in the
formation of soils, preparation of
Earth materials for transport by surﬁ-
cial processes, and transformation of
feldspar minerals to clay minerals.

1. Consider the case history con-
cerning the use of asbestos and 
the need to remove white asbestos,
which is not thought to cause
environmental health problems.
Suppose you are the superinten-
dent of schools in a school system
with many old buildings that con-
tain asbestos: pipes wrapped in as-
bestos, asbestos ceiling and ﬂoor
tiles, and ﬁre-retardant asbestos

used in the auditorium. What
steps would you take to determine
whether there is a hazard, and how
would you communicate with par-
ents who are worried that their
children are being exposed to
harmful materials? Outline a 
plan of action.

Case History
Endangered Steelhead Trout in Southern California: It’s All About Geology

Coastal streams that emerge
from southern California
mountains and ﬂow into
the ocean are not com-
monly thought of as trout
habitat. Steelhead trout
are born in mountain
streams and travel to
the ocean, where they
remain for several
years before return-
ing to spawn. These

ﬁsh are more

commonly as-
sociated with
streams of the
Paciﬁc North-

west. Neverthe-

less, populations of

steelhead trout exist from

San Diego in furthermost

southern California north to south
of San Francisco, where they merge
with their more northern rela-
tives.

Southern California has a
semiarid climate, and stream
ﬂow is extremely variable. Lower
parts of streams often dry up in the
summer, and much of an entire

stream may dry up during drought
years that occur periodically. In wet
years, especially following wildﬁres,
ﬂoods with large amounts of sedi-
ment are common. Headwater
streams, following wildﬁre or land-
slides, may become choked with
gravel that in subsequent years
spreads through the system, provid-
ing important habitat for ﬁsh and
other aquatic species.

Summer low ﬂow is particularly
important to southern steelhead,
which are an endangered species.
Adults enter the streams from the
ocean during winter months to spawn
and may return to the ocean to spawn
again in future years. The eggs hatch
in the gravel of the stream, and young
ﬁsh reside in the stream for a period
of months to a year or so before the
urge to go to the ocean moves them
to migrate. As part of a study to eval-
uate the steelhead habitat in the
Santa Monica Mountains near Los
Angeles, several stream systems were
observed during the summer low-ﬂow
months. One of the goals as part of a
plan to recover endangered southern
steelhead was to identify which

streams in the Santa Monica Moun-
tains were most capable of supporting
steelhead trout. Several of them, in-
cluding Malibu Creek and Topanga
Creek, were known to have steelhead.
The geology of the Santa Monica
Mountains was found to be an impor-
tant factor in enhancing the summer
low ﬂow that is the major limiting fac-
tor for steelhead survival in southern
California. Where aquifers are present
and groundwater is forced to the sur-
face due to rock fractures or faults,
seeps and springs are more common.
It was found that on the scale of the
Santa Monica Mountains, the eastern
portion of the range offers higher 
potential for summer low ﬂow due to
favorable geology. As a series of off-
shore faults come on land and cross
the streams, more abundant summer
low ﬂow occurs. The faults form a
barrier to groundwater, forcing the
water toward the surface, where it
emerges as seeps and springs. During
the late fall of 2005, a number of
pools were observed in Topanga
Canyon (Figure 4.1), and no ﬁsh 
were observed in most of the pools. 
In two or three pools where ﬁsh were

4.1 Ecology for Geologists: 

Basic Terms

Ecology is  the  study  of  controls  over  the  distribu-
tion and abundance of living things. More generally,
ecology is the study of living things (i.e., organisms)
and  their  interactions  and  linkages  to  each  other
and  to  the  nonliving  environment.  The  nonliving
environment  is  largely  controlled  by  physical  and
chemical processes related to the geologic cycle (see
Figure 3.13). The complex interactions between life
and the broader environment are responsible for the
creation and maintenance of our living world. Geo-
logic processes from the global to the regional down

to the smallest scales, such as a rock under which a
lizard lives, greatly affect life processes.

Discussion of relationships between ecology and ge-
ology starts by deﬁning a few terms and principles—
including  species,  population,  ecological  community,
habitat,  and  niche.  Following  these  deﬁnitions,  we
will  turn  our  discussion  to  ecosystems  where  geol-
ogy plays a full role in partnership with life. A species
is  a  group  of  individuals  capable  of  interbreeding.
Population may be deﬁned as a group of individuals
of  the  same  species  living  in  the  same  area.  The
ecological community is a group of populations of dif-
ferent species living in the same area with varying
degrees of interaction with each other. We use the

observed, seeps and springs from
fractures and faults in the sedimen-
tary rocks were clearly providing a
source of cold water. The pools oc-
curred at places where rock banks and
large boulders were in the channel.

The rocks and boulders constrict the
channel, producing a zone of fast
water at high ﬂow that scours a pool,
providing a low-ﬂow habitat for ﬁsh.

The study of the Santa Monica

Mountains suggests that it is impor-

tant to consider geologic factors in
streams when assessing fish habitat.
In southern California, it is clear
that the geology and groundwater
are important in understanding 
fish habitat.

FIGURE 4.1 Fish habitat: It is about geology This pool in Topanga Canyon is at a site where
fractures and faults cause springs that introduce cold water into the stream system. Without this cold
water, there would be much less habitat for the endangered southern steelhead. (Edward A. Keller)

term  habitat to  denote  where  a  particular  species
lives; how it makes a living is known as its niche. For
example, think about a mountain lion in the moun-
tains of Montana. We say the habitat is the moun-
tains, and the niche of the mountain lion is eating
deer and other large mammals.1

Before leaving our discussion of some of the basic
terms  of  ecology,  we  will  brieﬂy  consider  types  of
species. Some species are considered to be indigenous,
in that they are found in the area where they evolved.
Others are exotic species brought into an area or a
region by humans for a variety of purposes or as ac-
cidentals. For example, acacia trees were brought to
the  United  States  and  planted  as  wind  breaks  in

arid  regions.  Two  varieties  of  eucalyptus  trees  from
Australia have been imported and widely planted, as
have been numerous other plants and animals from
around  the  Earth.  Most  exotic  species  when  intro-
duced  do  not  cause  problems,  but  some  do.  Some-
times, we refer to problem exotic species as invasive
species.  These  species  will  compete  with  indigenous
species and may displace them. Some invasive species
are brought in accidentally due to transporting mater-
ial around the world, whereas others are brought in in-
tentionally. In either case, negative aspects of invasive
species are often not anticipated. Introduction of in-
vasive species is one of the major reasons for the ex-
tinction of plants and animals around the globe.

114

CHAPTER 4

Ecology and Geology

Two  other  terms  that  are  useful  are  biosphere
and biota. The biosphere is the part of Earth where
life exists, and biota refers to all organisms living in
an  area  or  region  up  to  and  including  the  entire
Earth.  With  these  basic  deﬁnitions  behind  us,  we
will consider what an ecosystem is, types of ecosys-
tems,  relationships  between  geology  and  biodiver-
sity, and human domination of ecosystems.

What Is an Ecosystem, 
and How Does It Work?
An  ecosystem is  an  ecological  community  and  its
nonliving  environment  in  which  energy  ﬂows  and
chemicals  (e.g.,  nutrients,  water)  cycle.  Thus,  an
ecosystem  involves  geology,  chemistry,  and  hydrol-
ogy, and its functional linkages with life are many and
complex. The basics of this are shown in Figure 4.2.
It  is  important  to  remember  that  energy  ﬂows
through ecosystems where chemicals are recycled and
used numerous times. Sometimes we refer to “ecosys-
tem function,” which is rates of ﬂow of energy and

cycling  of  nutrients  or  other  chemicals  through  an
ecosystem. In addition to ecosystem function, other
characteristics  are  structure,  process,  and  change.
Ecosystem structure includes two parts: the commu-
nity of organisms and the nonliving (geologic) envi-
ronment. The two main processes of ecosystems are
energy ﬂow and chemical cycling. Finally, succession
is an orderly and sometimes not-so-orderly change of
species  as  an  ecosystem  evolves,  following  a  distur-
bance such as volcanic eruption, ﬂood, or wildﬁre.
If  the  disturbance  results  in  a  new  land  surface,
such  as  new  land  added  to  an  island  by  volcanic
eruption,  the  succession  is  called  primary.  More
commonly,  disturbance  involves  reestablishment
of existing ecosystems following disturbance and is
called  secondary succession.  Secondary  succession
often  involves  plants  that  are  called  pioneers be-
cause they can do well with a lot of light and grow
quickly.  With  time,  as  more  nutrients  are  cycled
and the system develops, the middle stage of suc-
cession occurs; this is characterized by the greatest
number  of  species  and  their  ability  to  use  energy

FIGURE 4.2 Ecosystem basics Idealized diagram showing the basics of an ecosystem in terms of
energy ﬂowing and chemicals cycling. (Edward A. Keller)

and  cycle  material.  The  later  stages  of  succession
are dominated by fewer species, and in a forest we
say these are the old growth. The popular idea of a
“balance of nature” with orderly succession to a cli-
max condition where little changes and the system
is  in  equilibrium  is  an  imaginary  condition  and  a
concept largely rejected by ecologists. Disturbance
and change on a variety of scales of time and space
are the norm.1

There are several types of ecosystems, including
indigenous,  natural,  human  modiﬁed,  and  human
made  or  constructed.  Completely  natural  indige-
nous  ecosystems  on  land  are  hard  to  ﬁnd  because
human  activity  has  been  so  pervasive  or  invasive
that  almost  all  ecosystems  have  been  modiﬁed  by
human use and interest. For example, some of the
waste of our society, such as lead that is emitted into
the  atmosphere,  is  transported  around  the  planet,
affecting all ecosystems it comes into contact with,
often far from human populations.

Some ecosystems, over a wide range of sites and
purposes, are constructed by humans. For example,
we may construct shallow ponds or a series of canals
known  as  bioswales  that  collect  runoff  of  surface
water. Marsh plants, such as cattails, when planted
in  ponds  or  canals,  use  and  remove  nutrients  in
water  that’s  delivered  to  them  as  a  waste  or  pollu-
tant,  helping  clean  the  water.  Specially  designed
wetland  ecosystems  have  been  constructed  where
bacteria and plants process mine wastewater and help
remove toxins from water. Other large-scale ecosys-
tems are constructed to partially treat urban waste-
water.  Human-constructed  ecosystems  are  part  of
what is known as biological engineering.

Natural Service Functions 
of Ecosystems
Earth is a suitable place to live because the environ-
ment  produces  the  necessary  resources  that  living
things need to survive. As one of the many species
on Earth, we extract resources and receive the bene-
ﬁts  of  natural  service  functions  from  ecosystems
(also  called  ecosystem  services).  By  natural  service
functions,  we  mean  those  processes  of  ecosystems
that are responsible for producing clean water and
air,  as  well  as  the  mixtures  of  plants  and  animals
that  are  necessary  for  our  survival.  For  example,
ecosystem services help cycle elements through the
environment,  provide  nutrients  to  plants,  remove

Geology and Biodiversity

115

pollutants  from  water,  and,  through  soil  fertility,
allow for increased crop production.

Natural  service  functions  may  include  buffering
functions, such as protection from natural hazards
such  as  landsliding  and  ﬂooding.  For  example,
plants  on  steep  slopes  contribute  to  soil  stability
through the interaction of growing roots in the soil
that  increases  the  strength  of  slope  materials  and
provides  protection  from  failure  by  landslide.  The
roots,  especially  those  with  a  diameter  about  the
size  of  a  pencil’s,  bind  the  soil  together  much  like
steel bars in concrete. Similarly, plants on the banks
of a stream provide a root mass that stabilizes the
soil and helps retard stream-bank erosion. Freshwa-
ter  or  saltwater  marshes  provide  a  buffer  that  ab-
sorbs wave energy and energy from winds. Coastal
marshes  protect  against  coastal  ﬂooding  and  also
help reduce coastal erosion.

We  have  grown  accustomed  to  the  natural  ser-
vice functions  that  the  ecosystems  of  Earth  pro-
vide.  On  the  other  hand,  we  sometimes  change 
the land  and  reduce  or  eliminate  these  service 
functions.  For  example,  when  we  remove  coastal
marshes, we are more vulnerable to coastal erosion
and ﬂooding from storms, such as hurricanes, that
occasionally  strike  the  coastline.  When  we  drain
marshes and wetlands along rivers, we reduce their
ability to store water and, as a result, increase the
ﬂood hazard.

4.2 Geology and Biodiversity
Biodiversity is  an  important  concept  in  environ-
mental  science.  Most  commonly,  when  we  think
about biodiversity, we are discussing the number or
abundance of species in an ecosystem or ecological
community. The number of species is often referred
to  as  species  richness,  whereas  the  relative  propor-
tion of species in an ecosystem is referred to as its
species  evenness.  Another  term  sometimes  encoun-
tered  is  dominant  species,  which  is  the  species  or
multiple species that would be most commonly ob-
served  in  an  ecosystem.  Plant  ecologists  use  the
concept of importance value of a species or multiple
species  to  an  ecosystem.  The  important  principle
with  respect  to  biodiversity  is  that  geology  inﬂu-
ences biodiversity from the smallest scale on a hill
slope to continental-scale features, such as a moun-
tain range.

116

CHAPTER 4

Ecology and Geology

Biodiversity of Trees in North
America and Europe
A  fascinating  and  interesting  relationship  between
geology and biodiversity at the continental scale is
the distribution and number of native tree species
in North America versus Europe. North America has
many more native species of trees than are found in
Europe,  and  the  hypothesized  reason  is  related  to
linkages  between  the  ice  ages,  glaciers,  and  plate
tectonics that determine the orientation of moun-
tain  ranges.  In  North  America,  the  major  young
mountain ranges run generally north–south and in-
clude  the  Rocky  Mountains  and  the  mountains  of
the  West  Coast.  In  Europe,  the  dominant  young
mountain  ranges  resulted  from  the  collision  be-
tween  the  African  and  European  plates  that  pro-
duced  the  Alpine  range  in  Spain  east  through  the
Himalayas  (Figure  4.3).  So  how  might  this  be  re-
lated  to  the  number  of  species  of  trees  in  North
America and Europe?

The Last Glacial Maxima about 20,000 years ago,
when glacial ice covered about 30 percent of the con-
tinental area, was a harsh environment for trees. As
the continental glaciers grew in North America and

Europe, the trees had to migrate in front of the ad-
vancing ice. In North America, they found corridors
to  migrate  to  the  south,  but  in  Europe  they  were
blocked by the east–west Alps that were glaciated. In
Europe, the trees became trapped between the glaci-
ers, and many more species became extinct than in
North America. Thus, we see that the biodiversity of
native trees in North America and Europe was signif-
icantly affected by continental-scale mountain build-
ing related to plate tectonics.2

Community Effects and Keystone
Species: How Are These Concepts
Related to Geology?
Two  or  more  organisms  may  interact  in  complex
ways  to  affect  other  organisms  in  an  ecosystem.
These organisms are further linked to the nonliving
environment  and  combined  ecosystem  functions
(e.g., rates of ﬂow of energy, cycling of nutrients) in
ways that help maintain the system. Some individ-
ual species have a strong community effect with an
inﬂuence  disproportionate  to  their  abundance.  We
call  these  species  keystone  species,  and  there  are
many  examples  of  relationships  between  geology

vegetation  were  greatly  denuded  by  browsing  elk.
Then,  in  the  mid-1990s,  wolves  were  reintroduced
to the Yellowstone National Park ecosystem. Obser-
vations  by  wildlife  scientists  reported  that  wolves
were more successful in hunting elk in areas where
the  elk  had  to  negotiate  more  complex,  changing
topography, common along the streams where the
elk  were  feeding.  The  elk  soon  responded  and
avoided  the  stream  environments  except  when  ab-
solutely necessary. Over a 4-year period, from 1998
to  2002,  the  percentage  of  willows  eaten  by  elk
dropped from about 90 percent to nearly zero. It is
expected  that,  as  the  streamside  vegetation  con-
tributes to recovery, the stream channel and banks
will also recover to become more as they were prior
to  the  1920s,  when  the  last  wolves  in  Yellowstone
were  killed  (Figure  4.4).  Although  the  reintroduc-
tion of large predators, such as wolves, is controver-
sial,  the  wolves  play  a  role  in  the  ecosystems  in
which they are present. Wolves, by hunting elk and
scaring  them  away  from  the  streams,  exert  a  posi-
tive force that improves the stream banks and water
quality  (Figure  4.5).  Thus,  wolves  are  a  keystone
species and affect the broader community of organ-
isms.  Wolves  are  not  interested  in  protecting  the
streamside  environment,  but  through  hunting  elk

Stream Processes and Ecology: 
Story of Mountain Streams, Elk, and
Wolves in Yellowstone National Park
A mountain stream is a robust system consisting of
the  stream  channel,  bed,  and  banks  composed  of
silt, sand, gravel, and bedrock. Cool, clean water is
supplied  by  the  geologic  environment  through
snowmelt and rain that inﬁltrate the rocks and soil
to  emerge  in  the  stream  as  a  series  of  seeps  or
springs. This water provides the summer low ﬂow.
The water itself supports life in the stream, includ-
ing ﬁsh and other organisms, as well as streamside
vegetation  in  the  riparian  environment,  which
refers to the environment adjacent to stream chan-
nels  that  is  different  from  the  adjacent  uplands.
Stream bank vegetation also helps retard erosion of
the  banks  and  the  introduction  of  an  adverse
amount of sediment into the stream system. Some
of  the riparian  vegetation,  such  as  cottonwood
and  willow  trees,  is  prime  food  for  animals,  such
as  deer  and  elk,  that  browse  on  the
plants.  If  there  is  too  much  browsing,
the abundance of trees will be dramati-
cally reduced; this damages the stream
environment  by  reducing  the  shade  to
the stream and also increases bank ero-
sion  and  introduces  harmful  fine  sedi-
ment  into  the  water.  Fine  sediment
(e.g.,  silt)  is  a  type  of  water  pollution
because it reduces soil resources (i.e., it
is  a  product  of  soil  erosion),  degrades
water quality, and can directly clog gills
of  aquatic  animals.  In  the  stream  bed,
ﬁne  sediment  may  ﬁll  the  spaces  be-
tween  gravel  particles  or  seal  the  bed
with mud, damaging ﬁsh and aquatic in-
sect habitat.

The above scenario was played out in
Yellowstone  National  Park  between  the
1960s and 1990s, during a period when
wolves were not present and elk were not
culled. The willows and other streamside

FIGURE 4.4 Wolves and streams (a) Willows along Blacktale Creek in the
spring of 1996 are nearly absent because of heavy browsing by elk. (William J.
Ripple) (b) Following reintroduction of wolves only 6 years earlier, thicker stands
of willows are clearly evident. (William J. Ripple)

Coastal Geology, Kelp, Urchins, 
and Sea Otters
The kelp forests in southern California (Figure 4.7)
are a remarkable ecosystem based in part on the local
geology.  Kelp  are  a  type  of  large  marine  alga  that
grows  incredibly  fast.  The  giant  kelp  of  southern
California can grow up to more than 25 cm per day,
reaching  a  height  of  over  10  m  above  the  seaﬂoor.
The three parts of the kelp plant include the root-like

holdfast,  stem  (i.e.,  stipe),  and  system  of  blades
(i.e.,  leaves).  Kelp  also  have  a  number  of  ﬂotation
devices near the blades so they will remain in an up-
right position in the water column. At the surface,
particularly at low tide, the sea surface looks like a
nearly solid mat of kelp. Below the surface, the for-
est consists of stipes, which are attached to the bot-
tom by the holdfasts. Holdfasts attach to boulders
or  the  rocky  bottom.  Some  of  the  rocky  environ-
ments  to  which  they  may  become  attached  are
wave-cut platforms found offshore in fairly shallow
water and rock reefs, which may have water depths
of up to several tens of meters. The wave-cut platform

has variable relief depending upon the local resistance
of  the  particular  rock  shelf.  Rock  reefs  often  result
from geologic uplift from faulting or the presence of
more  resistant  (hard)  rock.  From  Santa  Barbara
south to Los Angeles, these structures are parallel to
shore and roughly east–west. Nearly all the offshore
reefs  that  support  kelp  forests  owe  their  existence
to an active geologic environment.

Holdfasts  are  attached  to  the  rocks  with  what
looks like a root system, but they do not take up nu-
trients. Rather, the function of holdfasts is to hold
the plant in place. If the holdfasts break loose or are
destroyed by some process, the kelp will ﬂoat free
and  drift  to  the  shore.  During  storms,  the  kelp
moving  near  the  surface  will  apply  stress  to  the
lower plant, causing the holdfast to come loose. The
holdfast,  with  bits  of  rock,  may  be  transported  to
the beach to become part of the sediment carried in
the near-shore environment. This process can move
rock particles from offshore to the beach, while dis-
tributing  organic  material  from  offshore  to  the
beach.

The  kelp  forest  ﬂourishes  in  areas  of  upwelling
nutrients and relatively cold water. Growth rates are
greatly  reduced  in  years  when  the  marine  water
warms  up,  such  as  during  El  Niño  years,  when
warmer water is present. A variety of organisms live
near the bottom of the kelp forest, including urchins,
which are spiny animals that feed on the holdfasts of
kelp. When urchins feed and break the holdfasts, the

kelp will ﬂoat free and die. There are several preda-
tors  of  sea  urchins,  including  humans,  who  collect
them for their roe (i.e., eggs), which is valuable, and
sea otters, who eat the urchins (Figure 4.8).

Studies  conducted  in  Alaska  suggest  that  areas
which no longer have many otters are impoverished.
In some areas, the sea urchins are so plentiful that
kelp scarcely exists. Where sea otters have been re-
stored to their former range after they were nearly
exterminated for their valuable fur, the kelp returns
and ﬂourishes.1 Linkages between the geologic envi-
ronment, kelp forest, urchins, and sea otters are ide-
alized in Figure 4.9. Notice that when sea otters are

when sea otters are absent, there is a large reduction in the kelp.

present,  there  are  fewer  urchins  and  there  is  more
abundant kelp.

Sea  otters  are  a  keystone  species  with  a  strong
community  effect  because  when  they  eat  sea
urchins, they make a healthy kelp forest more likely.
The kelp forest and exposed rock provides the struc-
ture and food resources for other animals, including
ﬁsh. Sea otters have no interest in protecting kelp,
and they don’t hang around at the base of the kelp,
keeping  the  urchins  off.  However,  through  their
feeding on urchins, sea otters help ensure a healthy,
productive kelp forest.1

There  is  currently  a  controversy  about  whether
sea otters should continue to expand into their pre-
vious  habitat  in  southern  California  south  of  Pont
Conception,  northwest  of  Santa  Barbara.  People
harvest urchins, and ﬁshermen are afraid that, if sea
otters become abundant, the number of urchins will
be reduced to the point that it will not be proﬁtable
to harvest them. The sea otters, of course, are un-
aware  of  this  controversy  and  are  simply  moving
back into their historic habitat. If the sea otters are
allowed to migrate south, their reestablishment will
be a slow process and, in fact, may not occur for a
variety  of  reasons.  First  and  foremost,  the  coastal
waters in some areas of southern California are pol-
luted,  and  pollutants  may  sicken  the  sea  otters.
Also, the climate is changing, and ocean waters are
warming, which may make the southern regions of

Geology and Biodiversity

121

the  habitat  less  viable  for  kelp  forests  and  the
urchins that feed on kelp holdfasts. In addition, sea
otters are sensitive to water temperature. They have
high  fat  density  that  provides  good  insulation  in
cold  water  but  can  result  in  overheating  in  warm
water.

Our discussion of wolves in Yellowstone and sea
otters in the kelp forest and their relations to the
hydrologic  and  geologic  environment 
is  fairly
straightforward.  There  are  numerous  other  exam-
ples of how keystone species affect ecosystems. For
example,  American  bison,  through  their  grazing
practices,  helped  maintain  biodiversity  of  the 
tall  grass  prairie  and  the  soil  where  they  roamed
(Figure 4.10).

Some  species  that  are  not  large  individuals  or
highly  visible  in  their  ecosystems  have  large  im-
portance  from  an  ecological  perspective.  For  ex-
ample,  reef-building  coral  and  algae  are  species
that create physical habitat in the coral reef envi-
ronments  of  the  world.  The  coral  and  algae  pro-
vide the framework upon which other reef life ex-
ists (Figure 4.11). Due to warming of the oceans,
pollution, and overfishing, coral reefs around the
globe  are  in  decline  in  many  places.  Finally,  an-
cient coral reefs are present as limestone rock that
forms the foundation of many areas where people
live,  including  much  of  Florida  and  the  Great
Lakes area.

may have specialized species that increase di-
versity at the regional scale.

• Relatively  constant  environmental  fac-
tors,  such  as  temperature,  precipitation,
and elevation. This is one of the reasons
there  are  so  many  species  near  the
equator.  There  is  a  relatively  con-
stant supply of energy from the sun
near  the  equator,  and  conditions
such as temperature and humidity
are relatively constant, leading to
greater diversity of organisms.
• The evolution, or generation of
biodiversity,  which  generally
refers to slow changes over ge-
ologic time in organisms. How-
ever, sometimes evolution can
occur rapidly with species.

• An  environment  that  is  highly
modiﬁed by life, such as rich or-
ganic  soil.  At  regional  scales,
more  biologically  productive
areas  tend  to  be  more  diverse.
• Geology,  which  affects  ecosystem  function
and  process  from  small-  to  continental-scale
environments.  See,  for  example,  the  earlier
discussion  of  biodiversity  and  orientation  of
mountain ranges.

What Factors Reduce Biological
Diversity?
Biological diversity may be reduced1 by:

• The presence of extreme environments, such
as hot springs or tar seeps that locally provide
a  much  more  limited  set  of  habitats  and
niches for life. From above, we see that extreme
environments  may  increase  biodiversity  at
the  regional  scale.  Thus,  the  effect  changes
with scale.

• Extreme  disturbance  or  very  frequent  distur-
bance,  such  as  regional-scale  ﬁres,  storms,  or
volcanic  activity,  that  catastrophically  disrupt
ecosystems.

• Transformation of the land, which fragments
ecosystems.  Examples  of  fragmented  ecosys-
tems  include;  above  and  below  a  dam  on  a
river  that  blocks  migration  of  ﬁsh,  construc-
tion of a large reservoir that leaves a series of
small islands isolated from the mainland, and

FIGURE 4.11 Coral reefs Coral reefs are composed of a number of organisms, 
including algae and corals, which build up the basic reef structure that greatly affects 
biodiversity of the marine environment. (John A. Anderson/iStockphoto)

Factors That Increase or Decrease
Biodiversity
Following our discussion of ecological communities,
ecosystems, and keystone species, we can more di-
rectly  address  what  sorts  of  processes  are  likely  to
either increase or decrease biodiversity. We are pri-
marily concerned with species richness—that is, the
number of species—but biodiversity also relates to
genetic  diversity,  which  is  the  number  of  genes
found in the population that may not always be ex-
pressed by the morphology or function of the par-
ticular organism.

What Factors Increase Biodiversity?
Biodiversity  may  be  increased  by  several  factors1, 
including:

• The  presence  of  diverse  habitat  with  many
potential  niches.  For  example,  a  river  with
variable depth, turbulence, velocity, and amount
of large woody debris (stems and root wads of
trees) will support more species.

• Moderate  amounts  of  disturbance—such  as
wildﬁres, violent storms, or volcanic activity—
that provides new or renewed habitat.

• The  presence  of  harsh  environments,  such  as
hot  springs  or  nutrient-poor  rocks  and  soil,

urbanization  of  a  region  that  results  in  few
corridors between rural lands for migration of
plants and animals.

• The  presence  of  environmental  stresses,  such

as pollution.

• Habitat simpliﬁcation, such as agriculture that
reduces habitat and construction of engineer-
ing  structures  to  control  ﬂooding  or  erosion
(see A Closer Look: Seawalls and Biodiversity).
• Introduction of intrusive species that compete
with indigenous species or cause predation or
disease in indigenous species.

• The presence of mountain ranges that block or

restrict migration of plants and animals.

Human Domination of Ecosystems
It  is  apparent  that  we  humans  dominate  almost  all
ecosystems  on  Earth.  Study  of  this  domination  has
led to the general conclusion that the domination has
not yet produced a global disaster. However, in some
areas, disastrous conditions have occurred. It is ap-
parent that many factors are linked in complex ways
to human population increase as well as transforma-
tion of the land for human use and global change in
climate  and  the  biogeochemical  cycles.  These
processes are resulting in the reduction of biological
diversity, including the loss of entire ecosystems and
the extinction of many species. We are apparently in
a large extinction event that in the past 2,000 years
has  resulted  in  a  reduction  of  biodiversity,  particu-
larly for birds, mammals, and ﬁsh, as well as many in-
sects and other species. The rates of extinction dur-
ing the past 2 millennia are much larger than would
be expected based on geologic background rates.

The  most  significant  factor  that  has  led  to
human  domination  of  Earth’s  ecosystems  is  land
transformations.  These  transformations  occur  as
we  develop  our  agriculture,  industry,  recreation,
and urban centers.

The Golden Rule of the
Environment: A Geologic
Perspective All About Timing
Stephen  Jay  Gould,  a  famous  geologist  and  ecolo-
gist,  stated  that  a  proper  scientiﬁc  analysis  of  the
environmental  crisis  facing  people  today  requires
the  use  of  an  appropriate  scale  of  time  and  space.

Geology and Biodiversity

123

Gould argued that there is “Earth time” (deep time),
which is basically geologic, and then there is “human
time,” which is very much shorter and of interest to
people  on  Earth  today.  He  stated  that  modern
human  beings  are  only  one  of  millions  of  species
that  have  been  on  Earth  and  that  each  species  is
unique  and  has  its  own  value.  Gould  argued  that
there  is  an  appropriate  environmental  ethic  based
upon the issue of the human time scale versus the
“majesty but irrelevance” of geologic time.

Gould’s basic conclusion is that we need to make
a “pact” with Earth (our home) because She holds all
the  important  playing  cards  and,  as  such,  has  a
power over us. We are in great need of developing a
more  compatible  relationship  with  our  planet  on
our  time.  Earth  does  not  need  an  agreement  with
us. Such an agreement would be a gift from Mother
Earth to us and is a variation of the golden rule: Do
unto  others  as  you  would  have  them  do  unto  you.
Gould argued that we should cut a deal while Earth
is still able to enter into such an agreement on our
time  scale.  He  stated,  “If  we  scratch  her,  she  will
bleed,  kick  us  out,  bandage  up,  and  go  about  her
own  business  at  her  own  time  scale.”5 In  other
words, if we continue to treat our planet with disre-
spect,  we  will  eventually  degrade  the  environment
for humans and many other living things. As a re-
sult,  we  might  become  extinct  sooner,  along  with
many other species. If we sustain ecosystems and re-
sources,  we  might  avoid  extinction  a  bit  longer.
From a deep time perspective, over hundreds of mil-
lions to billions of years, our species will have little
effect on Earth’s history. However, on a time scale of
interest to us, we would like to hang around as long
as possible. We are not talking about saving Earth.
Earth  will  go  on  at  least  a  few  billion  more  years
with or without us! We are talking about sustaining
Earth systems that we depend upon for our health
and well-being.

What Can We Do to Reduce 
the Human Footprint 
on the Environment?
The human footprint on the environment is the im-
pact we have on our planet, including its resources
and  ecosystems.  Just  recognizing  that  the  human
footprint is growing is a step (poor pun) in the right
direction.  We  recognize  that  our  total  footprint  is

A 

Closer
Look

Seawalls and Biodiversity

A seawall is a structure made of con-
crete, large boulders, or, sometimes,
wood constructed parallel to the
shore, with the objective of stop-
ping coastal erosion (Figure 4.A).
Waves break on the wall (not the 
exposed beach), reducing coastal
erosion. Seawalls cause an initial
narrowing of the beach because
they physically intrude on the
beach. A seawall causes waves and
their energy to be reﬂected. The re-
ﬂected waves erode sand near the
wall, which further narrows the
beach. Unless there is a lot of sand
available to replace the eroded

sand, the beach over a period of
years to decades will become nar-
rower and narrower. In some cases,
the beach may disappear, except at
the lowest tides.

A variety of species use a beach

ecosystem. Clams and other shellﬁsh,
worms, and sand crabs live below the
surface. Animals, including birds and
ﬁsh, hunt and eat what is in the sand
or washed out by wave action. Kelp,
driftwood, and other plant debris can
be found on the surface, along with
sand ﬂeas and insects that feed on the
beach debris. When a beach is nar-
rowed by a seawall, all the life is

squeezed into a narrower zone. There
are fewer animals in the sand and
fewer birds to feed and rest on the
beach. In addition, the beach has less
driftwood and stranded kelp to pro-
vide habitat for insects. As a result,
biodiversity of the beach decreases.4
An idealized diagram of the changes
is shown in Figure 4.B. The big idea is
that, as we reduce habitat of species
in an ecosystem, their diversity
changes. Some species are reduced in
number, and others may disappear.
This is especially likely if a beach
nearly disappears following construc-
tion of a seawall.

the  footprint  per  person  multiplied  by  the  total
number of persons. In order to reduce this impact,
we need to either reduce the number of people or re-
duce  the  impact  per  person.  The  ways  most  often
mentioned are to reduce human population, use re-
sources  more  efﬁciently,  and  learn  to  manage  our
waste better. It is also important to gain a better sci-
entiﬁc  understanding  of  ecosystems.  We  need  to
know  more  about  how  ecosystems  are  linked  to
human-induced  change  and  how  our  sociocultural
environment  is  linked  to  those  changes.  When  we
do  this,  we  recognize  the  importance  of  human-
dominated  ecosystems  and  their  linkages  to  the
broader  world.  Finally,  recognizing  that  we  have  a
signiﬁcant footprint, we have a moral responsibility
to manage ecosystems better. If we wish to maintain
biological diversity of “wild ecosystems” with their
“wild species,” then we will have to make conscious
decisions  about  how  we  manage  the  environment.
Particularly important will be more active manage-
ment because we recognize that the human popula-
tion  increase  is  unprecedented  in  Earth’s  history.
Never  before  has  one  species  so  clearly  dominated
the world. In some cases, changes are increasing and
accelerating,  and  the  more  we  know  about  these
changes,  the  better  prepared  we  will  be  for  active
management of our planet.6

4.3 Ecological Restoration
Restoration  ecology  is  the  science  behind  the
process of ecological restoration. Our discussion fo-
cuses on the application of science (i.e., restoration
ecology) to restoration projects. A simple deﬁnition
of ecological restoration is that it is the process of
altering  a  site  or  an  area  with  the  objective  of
reestablishing  indigenous,  historical  ecosystems.
There  are  many  potential  restoration  projects,  in-
cluding river restoration for ﬁsh and other wildlife
habitat;  dam  removal  to  reunite  fragmented  river
ecosystems  (see  A  Closer  Look:  Restoration  of  the
Kissimmee River); ﬂoodplain restoration to improve
ecological function; wetland restoration of freshwa-
ter or saltwater marshes for a variety of purposes,
from ﬂood control to improving wildlife habitat to
providing  a  buffer  to  coastal  erosion  (see  A  Closer
Look: Restoration of the Florida Everglades); beach
and  coastal  sand  dune  restoration  to  help  manage
beach  erosion  and  provide  wildlife  habitat  (see  A

Closer Look: Coastal Sand Dune Restoration at Pocket
Beaches:  University  of  California,  Santa  Barbara);
restoration  of  habitat  for  endangered  species;  re-
shaping the land, drainage, and vegetation following
surface  mining;  and  restoring  habitat  for  native
species and wildlife impacted by clear-cut logging or
for improved ﬁre management.

A common objective of the restoration process is
to change a degraded ecosystem so that it resembles
a less human-disturbed ecosystem and contains the
structure,  function,  diversity,  and  processes  of  the
desired  ecosystem.  In  an  attempt  to  add  a  human
and  social  component  to  ecological  restoration,  it
might also be deﬁned as the process of deliberately
modifying a site or an area to compensate for envi-
ronmental degradation caused by humans. The pur-
pose  of  restoration  is  to  reestablish  sustainable
ecosystems and develop a new relationship between
the  natural  environment  and  the  human-modiﬁed
environment.7,8 When  we  try  to  apply  these  ideas
and principles, we come to the realization that many
human-altered  environments  are  nothing  like  nat-
ural systems. Furthermore, it is nearly impossible to
restore many sites to their initial conditions because
they  have  been  irreversibly  changed.  For  example,
many coastal wetlands and river wetlands have been
drained, ﬁlled in, and developed for human use. Re-
turning  them  to  their  original  condition  would  be
impossible. Therefore, a more practical approach is
to attempt to transform the present ecosystems and
landscapes  into  ones  that  more  closely  resemble
ecosystems less disturbed by human processes. For
example,  planning  to  restore  a  river  that  ﬂows
through  a  city  might  include  removing  nonnative
species,  replanting  native  plants,  and  allowing  the
river  to  behave  in  a  more  natural  state  within  its
ﬂoodplain. In doing so, the restoration would produce
a  greenbelt  along  a  river  that  is  well  vegetated  and
contains  portions  of  ecosystems  that  were  present
prior to urbanization. The result would be a compro-
mise between ecological restoration to establish what
was there prior to urbanization and the production of
a more natural river system that functions more like
rivers found in a nonurban environment.7,8

It  is  possible  to  restore  a  variety  of  landscapes,
but, regardless of what is being restored, considera-
tion must be given to several major factors that we
sometimes  call  the  “Big  Three”  in  restoration:  hy-
drologic  process,  soils  and  rocks,  and  vegetation.
Hydrologic  process  includes  the  entire  hydrologic

Restoration of the Kissimmee River

Restoration of the Kissimmee River in
central and southern Florida is the
most ambitious river restoration pro-
ject in the United States. Prior to
channelization, the river was approxi-
mately 160 km (100 mi) long, mean-
dering through a ﬂoodplain that was
several kilometers wide (Figure 4.C).
The river had an unusual hydrology
because it inundated its ﬂoodplain
for prolonged periods of time. As a
result, the ﬂoodplain and river sup-
ported a biologically diverse ecosys-
tem consisting of wetland plants,
wading birds, waterfowl, ﬁsh, and
other wildlife.

Prior to about 1940, few people

lived in the Kissimmee basin, and the
land use was primarily farming and
cattle ranching. However, rapid de-
velopment and growth occurred fol-
lowing World War II, and, in 1947,
widespread ﬂooding occurred as a
hurricane moved through the basin.
As a result, the state of Florida re-
quested the federal government to
design a ﬂood-control plan for cen-
tral and southern Florida. The chan-
nelization of the Kissimmee River was
planned from about 1954 to 1960,
and between 1962 and 1971, the
river was channelized. Approximately
two-thirds of the ﬂoodplain was
drained, and a canal was excavated,
turning the meandering river into a
straight canal. As a result of the chan-
nelization, ecosystem function was
degraded. Wetlands with populations
of birds and ﬁsh were drastically re-
duced. Outrage over the loss of the
river went on for years before restora-
tion efforts were discussed and
planned. The purpose of the restora-
tion is to return a portion of the river
to its historic meandering riverbed

and wide ﬂoodplain. Speciﬁc ob-
jectives9 are to:
• Restore historic biological 
diversity and ecosystem 
function.

• Re-create the historic 

pattern of wetland plant 
communities.

• Reestablish the historic 

hydrologic conditions with
prolonged ﬂooding of the
ﬂoodplain.

• Re-create the historic river

ﬂoodplain environment 
and its connection to the 
main river.
The restoration project was

authorized by the U.S. Congress
in 1992, in partnership with the
South Florida Water Manage-
ment District and the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers. The general
plan for the restoration is shown
in Figure 4.D.

The restoration of the Kissim-
mee River is an ongoing project
that began several years ago. By
2001, approximately 12 km of the
nearly straight channel had been
restored to a meandering channel
with ﬂoodplain wetlands about
24 km long. This returned the
ecosystems to a more natural
state as water again ﬂowed
through a meandering channel
and onto the ﬂoodplain. As a re-
sult, wetland vegetation was
reestablished, and birds and other
wildlife are returning. The potential
ﬂood hazard is being addressed as
the restoration plans allow the river
to meander through its ﬂoodplain
while maintaining ﬂood protection.
Retaining ﬂood protection is the rea-

Restoration of the Florida Everglades

The Florida Everglades is considered
to be one of the nation’s most valu-
able ecological treasures. The ecosys-
tems of the Everglades stretch from 
a series of small lakes near Orlando,
Florida, southward to Florida Bay for a
length of several hundred kilometers
(Figure 4.E). The area north of Lake
Okeechobee comprises the drainage
area feeding into the lake, while the
area south of the lake is a long system
of wetlands that may be hydrologi-
cally described as a shallow, wide
body of slowly moving water. Tourists

from around the world have visited
the Everglades for generations. They
come to see the unique landscape, as
well as the wildlife. The Everglades is
home to more than 11,000 species of
plants, as well as several hundred bird
species and numerous species of ﬁsh
and marine mammals, including the
endangered Florida manatee. The
wetlands and surrounding areas are
the last remaining habitat for nearly
70 threatened or endangered species,
including the Florida panther and the
American crocodile. Since about

1900, much of the Everglades has
been drained for agriculture and
urban developments, and only 50
percent of the original wetlands re-
main. A complex system of canals and
levees controls much of the ﬂow of
water for a variety of purposes, 
including ﬂood control, water supply,
and land drainage.

Over many decades, the draining of

the wetlands and the encroachment
of urban areas have degraded the
ecosystem of the Everglades to the
point where the resource was likely to

Ecology and Geology

need to carefully consider restoration
that delivers the water in the proper
amount, quantity, and place to sup-
port ecosystems in the Everglades.
This will be a challenge because mil-
lions of people in south Florida are
also competing for the water.

The overriding goal of the restora-

tion is to ensure the long-term sus-
tainability of water resources in the
ecosystem of the Everglades.10 Doing
this includes:
• Controlling the human population
in south Florida, controlling human
access to the Everglades, and con-
trolling human development that
encroaches on the Everglades

• Applying the principle of environ-

mental unity (everything affects
everything else; see Chapter 1) to
better understand and anticipate
possible consequences resulting
from changes to the geologic, hy-
drologic, and ecological parts of
the system

• Applying the precautionary princi-

ple (see Chapter 1)

• Analyzing rates and changes of

systems related to the water, land,
and wildlife, as linked to people

It is clear that the people of south

Florida and the nation value the
ecosystem of the Everglades and are
applying science with values to im-
plement a far-reaching ecological
restoration program. Hopefully, it will
be successful, and future generations
will look back to this point in time as
a “watershed” (poor pun) that started
the ball rolling to protect one of the
most valuable ecological resources in
North America.

be lost unless a restoration program
was implemented. That restoration is
now underway, and it is the largest en-
vironmental project in a wetland in the
world. The program is a 30-year en-
deavor that will cost upwards of $10
billion. Restoration goals10 include:
• Restoration of more natural hydro-

logic processes.

• Enhancement and recovery of na-
tive and, particularly, endangered
species.

• Improvement of water quality, es-
pecially control of nutrients from
agricultural and urban areas.
• Restoration of habitat for all

wildlife that use the Everglades.

The restoration plan is an aggres-
sive one that involves federal, state,
and tribal partners, as well as numer-
ous other groups interested in the
Everglades. The progress to date is

notable, as pollution of water ﬂowing
into the Everglades from agricultural
activities has been reduced by about
one-half. As a result, the water enter-
ing the system is cleaner than it has
been for years. In addition, thou-
sands of hectares have been treated
to remove invasive, exotic species,
such as Brazilian pepper trees and
tilapia (a ﬁsh from Africa), with the
objective of improving and conserv-
ing habitat for a variety of endan-
gered and other species.

The plan to restore the Everglades
is a long-term one and involves many
years of scientiﬁc research yet to be
completed. The program is compli-
cated by the fact that more than 5
million people live in south Florida.
The area has a rapidly growing econ-
omy, and many urban issues related
to water quality and land use need to
be addressed. Perhaps the biggest
issue is the water, and the plan will

cycle, referring to surface waters and groundwater.
Soils and rocks include the microorganisms that re-
side in the soil. Vegetation is the cover material on
land and in wetland ecosystems. When we apply the
Big  Three  in  a  restoration  project,  we  soon  realize

that ecological restoration, as it is applied today, is
part art and part applied science. This is because we
do not often know enough about particular ecosys-
tems  to  deﬁne  their  function,  structure,  and
process accurately. Ecological restoration also has a

Closer

Coastal Sand Dune Restoration at Pocket Beaches:
University of California, Santa Barbara

The University of California, Santa
Barbara, has several kilometers of
beach on its campus. Two small
pocket beaches exist at locations
where the sea cliff is interrupted or
cut through by prehistoric channels.
At these locations, some sand blows
from the beaches inland for several
tens of meters, and a series of low
coastal sand dunes have developed.
Over the years, the dunes were colo-
nized by a South African species of
ice plant. The ice plant came to cover
the entire dune, inhibiting normal
dune function by allowing no other
plants to grow and inhibiting natural
sand movement. As a result, the bio-
diversity of the dune ecosystem was
greatly reduced. Restoration of the
dunes has involved solarizing the ice
plant. This is done by covering the
plants with black plastic for several
months, until they die and turn into
mulch. The dune is then planted with
native dune species (Figure 4.F). As
native vegetation returns to the
dunes, the ecosystem is restored. The
restoration of the dunes was simple
and straightforward, with limited ob-
jectives of removing exotic, invasive
species and replacing them with na-
tive species. When this was done, the
function of the ecosystem recovered,
and biological diversity increased. In

this case, the restoration of composi-
tion (i.e., plants) promotes the
restoration of process (i.e., allows the
sand in the dunes to move). However,

in the Everglades and Kissimmee
River examples, hydrologic processes
need to be restored prior to restoring
composition.

FIGURE 4.F Sand dune restoration Sand dunes at the University of California,
Santa Barbara, following restoration. The invasive species (ice plant) has been removed
and native dunes species have been planted. Before restoration the dunes look like large
mounds of ice plants. (Edward A. Keller)

component of societal contribution that goes along
with  the  scientiﬁc  contribution.  In  this  respect,
restoration  is  a  social  activity.  The  contribution
from  people  in  communities  where  restoration
will  take  place, or as they are sometimes called, the
stakeholders,  is  important  in  establishing  goals  for
restoration. A series of public meetings for comment
and  recommendations  are  held  prior  to  starting

restoration projects. There is feedback between the
goals  and  scientiﬁc  endpoints,  which  are  a  conse-
quence of the goals. For example, if we are restoring
a salt marsh and want the plants in the marsh to re-
duce the nutrient loading to a particular level, then
that level is a scientiﬁc endpoint. If it turns out that
the endpoint may not be reached, then further con-
sideration  of  goals  may  be  in  order.  The  scientiﬁc

132

CHAPTER 4

Ecology and Geology

measures refer to the measurements and monitoring
that  happen  along  the  way  toward  achievement  of
scientiﬁc endpoints and the goals of the restoration.
The contribution of science is important in develop-
ing  the  endpoints  and  measures.  Good  restoration
applies the principle of adaptive management, which
is  the  ﬂexible  process  of  improving  management
policy and plans through learning from past experi-
ence  with  a  project.  With  adaptive  management,
science  is  used  as  an  integral  part  of  restoration
projects from initial project evaluation through im-
plementation and post-project monitoring.

Ecological  restoration  efforts  may  vary—from
very  simple  procedures,  such  as  removing  exotic
species of plants and planting desired species, with a
focus on the restoration of composition and struc-
ture, to reconstruction of the entire landscape, with
a  focus  on  process.  Reconstruction  of  a  landscape
and  its  ecosystems  requires  intimate  knowledge  of
geologic  and  hydrologic  processes.  Table  4.1 lists
details of the processes of restoration.

Regardless  of  the  nature  and  extent  of  the
restoration  being  done,  it  is  a  negotiated  process
between  people  interested  in  the  project,  those
doing the restoration, and scientists making recom-
mendations, gathering data, and analyzing results.
It is also important to recognize that evaluation of

a  restoration  project  starts  long  before  construc-
tion.  This  evaluation  involves  identifying  environ-
mentally  sensitive  aspects  of  the  project  and  how
they might interact with important historic or cul-
tural values. Prior to construction, a careful evalua-
tion  of  the  geologic,  hydrologic,  and  vegetation
conditions at the site is necessary to match the en-
vironment  to  the  restoration  procedures.  In  other
words, we evaluate the hydrology, geology, and veg-
etation in terms of the overall goals of the project
and  what  is  being  restored.  During  restoration,
monitoring  is  often  necessary  to  help  evaluate
whether  the  objectives  are  being  achieved.  Also,
during  the  entire  project,  including  the  develop-
ment  of  goals,  those  doing  the  restoration  should
work closely with the community people involved,
including environmentalists, property owners, and
other interest groups, to maximize opportunities to
cooperate in the restoration project. Finally, it’s im-
portant  to  recognize  that  ecological  restoration,
while often successful, is likely to have mixed suc-
cess. This is particularly likely in the ﬁrst years of a
restoration  project,  when  unexpected  difﬁculties
often occur, making changes in the restoration plan
necessary.  There  may  also  be  natural  events,  such
as  droughts  or  severe  storms,  that  will  interfere
with the restoration activities.

TABLE 4.1 Steps and Procedures in Planning and Initiating an Ecological 

Restoration Project

1. Develop an ecological description of the area to be restored.

2. Provide a clear understanding of the need for the restoration.

3. Deﬁne the objectives and goals of the project.

4. Speciﬁcally state the procedures that will be used to achieve the restoration.

5. Clearly know the reference ecosystem that the restoration is attempting to reach.

6. Determine how the restored ecosystem will be self-sustaining; that is, provide for ﬂow of energy and cycling of chemicals

to ensure long-term self-maintenance of the restored ecosystem and stable linkages to other ecosystems.

7. State the standards of performance during restoration and monitoring following completion.

8. Work with all people interested in the project (stakeholders) from initiation through completion and postproject

monitoring.

9. Examine what the potential consequences of the project are likely to be; that is, apply the principle of environmental

unity, that everything affects everything else and anticipate what primary, secondary, and tertiary effects may be.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts

133

Another concept related to ecological restoration
is biological engineering, which is the use of vegeta-
tion in engineering projects to achieve speciﬁc goals

such as protecting stream banks from erosion.7,8 On
a broader scale, ecological engineering includes de-
signing and constructing ecosystems.

Making The   Connection 
Linking the Opening Case History About Endangered Southern Steelhead Trout 
to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. Why do you think that southern
steelhead trout in California are
endangered? How might their
populations be stabilized or re-
cover (i.e., increase)?

2. What might be the role of in-

creasing human population and
science/values in the recovery of

an endangered species, such as
southern steelhead trout?

3. What does knowledge of geo-
logic and hydrologic systems
contribute to understanding how
ecosystems function in general
and, speciﬁcally, ecosystems that
include southern steelhead?

Summary

Ecology is the study of living things
and their interactions and linkages to
each other and their nonliving envi-
ronment. It can also be viewed as the
study of factors inﬂuencing the distri-
bution and abundance of species. An
ecosystem is a community of organ-
isms and their interactions with the
nonliving environment in which en-
ergy ﬂows and chemicals cycle. There-
fore, understanding ecosystems in-
volves understanding the geologic,
biogeochemical, and hydrologic envi-
ronment.

Geology has many linkages to bio-
diversity through its inﬂuence on the
abundance and distribution of plants
and animals. Examples include trout
habitat in southern California, the
forests of North America and Europe,

wolves and elk in Yellowstone Na-
tional Park and their relationship to
stream processes, and the kelp forest
in California related to the interaction
of sea otters and the urchins they eat.
Human activity and interest domi-
nate almost all ecosystems on Earth.
Our processes (inﬂuences) are reduc-
ing biodiversity, including the loss of
entire ecosystems and the extinction
of many species. The processes of
most concern are land transforma-
tion, such as transformation of the
land from a natural environment to
agriculture or urban uses, introduc-
tion of invasive species, processes that
cause global change, and change to
biogeochemical cycles. Reducing the
human footprint on the ecosystems
of Earth is an important objective and

will include, among other activities,
controlling human population, 
managing Earth’s resources for sus-
tainability, and managing our waste
more efﬁciently.

We are in need of an appropriate
environmental ethic based on a time
scale of interest to people. If we
choose to sustain resources and
ecosystems, we will have a more com-
patible relationship with our home
(Earth), and our species will be able to
remain on the planet a bit longer.

Ecological restoration is emerging
as an important process with a vari-
ety of goals and objectives. In gen-
eral, ecological restoration has the
purpose of reestablishing sustain-
able ecosystem structure, process,
and function.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
Controlling human population
growth is an important objective in

sustaining our environment and
reducing the human footprint on the
environment. If we are unable to

control human growth, we will have
little success in achieving sustainable
management of our resources.

134

CHAPTER 4

Ecology and Geology

Sustainability Sustainability is the
environmental objective. Sustaining
Earth’s ecosystems is necessary if we
hope to sustain our human system.
We share our planet with a vast
number of other living things, and
many of these are necessary for our
own well-being. Therefore, when we
consider geology and ecosystems, we
need to consider those linkages that
will lead to sustainable development
in its broadest context.

Geologic and hydrologic systems have
simple to complex relationships with
communities of organisms. These
organisms have important linkages 
to the diversity of living organisms 
in ecosystems. Maintaining living
systems in a desired and sustainable
state must involve understanding the
role of geologic and hydrologic
processes and maintaining these
processes in a way that supports the
desired biological conditions.

Earth as a System Ecosystems are
an important component of Earth
systems that link living organisms
with their nonliving environment.

Hazardous Earth Processes, Risk
Assessment, and Perception
Ecosystems have natural service
functions that are linked to hazards,

such as landslides and ﬂooding. Bank
vegetation on stream banks increases
the stability of stream banks and
their resistance to erosion. Wetlands
moderate ﬂoodwater by storing and
releasing it slowly, thus reducing
ﬂood hazards. Wetlands provide a
buffer to storm waves from the ocean
and, thus, help protect coastal areas
from erosion and ﬂooding.

Scientific Knowledge and
Values The science of ecology has
provided a lot of information about
ecosystems. How we use that
knowledge to restore and maintain
ecosystems will reﬂect our values.

Critical Thinking Questions

1. An ecosystem consists of an eco-
logical community and its nonliv-
ing environment. Which of the
two do you think is more impor-
tant and why? In other words, do
you think the physical environ-
ment comes before what lives
there, or does what lives there af-
fect the physical environment to a
greater extent than the role of ge-
ology? Or are both things equally
important?

2. Visit a local stream. Carefully ex-
amine the stream and surround-
ing environment and try to de-
termine the amount of human
domination. Is the stream you 
are looking at a candidate for
restoration? If so, what could be
done? If it’s not a candidate for
restoration, why not?

3. Why may some geologists and hy-

drologists not be particularly

aware of ecosystem function in
terms of the biological environ-
ment? Why are some biologists 
unaware of the details of the 
physical and hydrologic condi-
tions of the ecosystems they work
with? What can be done to nar-
row the gap between those work-
ing on living systems and those
working on geologic or hydrologic
systems?

Earth Processes 
and Natural Hazards

ur focus in Part 2 turns to the major natural hazards:
an introduction to hazardous processes (Chapter 5); earth-
quakes (Chapter 6); tsunami (Chapter 7); volcanic activity
(Chapter 8); ﬂooding (Chapter 9); landslides (Chapter 10);
coastal processes, including hurricanes (Chapter 11); and
impacts of asteroids and comets (Chapter 12). The pur-
pose is not to provide extensive amounts of detailed infor-
mation concerning these natural processes that we deﬁne
as hazards but to focus on the basics involved and the en-
vironmental concerns resulting from interactions between
people and natural processes and hazards.

The major principles presented are these: (1) Earth is a
dynamic environment, and change resulting from natural
processes is the norm rather than an exception; (2) we must

strive to learn all we can about natural processes and haz-
ards so that effects on human society may be minimized;
and (3) human population increase and changing land use
are greatly increasing the threat of loss of life and property
to natural hazards. Of particular importance is the recogni-
tion of locations where hazardous processes are going to
occur and their natural or human-induced return period 
(i.e., time between events). We will learn that the environ-
mentally preferred adjustment to natural hazards is environ-
mental planning to avoid those locations where the hazards
are most likely to occur and to zone the land appropriately.
Environmental planning involves detailed study of natural
processes and mapping of those processes to produce 
environmental maps that are useful in the planning process.

Introduction 
to Natural Hazards

Learning Objectives
Natural hazards are naturally occurring processes that may be dangerous to human life and structures.
Volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, ﬂoods, and hurricanes are all examples of natural hazards. Human
population continues to increase, and there is a need to develop environmentally sound strategies
to minimize the loss of life and property damage from hazards, especially in urban areas. The

study of hazardous processes, therefore, constitutes one of the main activities of environmental

geology. The learning objectives for this chapter are:

• Understand the various
natural processes that
constitute hazards to
people and property

• Know why history,
linkages between
processes, prediction,
and risk assessment are
important in
determining the threat
from natural hazards

• Know how people

perceive and adjust to
potential natural
hazards

• Know the stages of
recovery following
natural disasters and
catastrophes

• Understand why

increasing population
and changing land use
increase the threat of
loss of life and property
from a natural disaster
to the level of a
catastrophe

• Know the conditions that
make some natural Earth
processes hazardous to
people

• Understand how a

natural process that
gives rise to disasters
may also be beneﬁcial to
people

Introduction to Natural Hazards

Case History
Hurricane Katrina, the Most Serious Natural
Catastrophe in U.S. History

Hurricane Katrina
made landfall in the
early evening of Au-
gust 29, 2005,
about 45 km (30
mi) east of New
Orleans. Katrina
was a huge storm
that caused seri-
ous damage up to
160 km (100 mi)
from its center.

The storm
produced 
a storm
surge (i.e., 
a mound 
of water
pushed on-
shore by the
storm) of 3 to 
6 m (9 to 20 ft).
Much of the coast
line of Louisiana and

Mississippi was
devastated as
coastal barrier
islands and
beaches were
eroded and

homes destroyed.

Entire coastal communities disap-
peared, along with their ﬁshing 
industries.

At ﬁrst it was thought that the city

of New Orleans had been spared, as
the hurricane did not make a direct
hit. The situation turned into a cata-
strophe when water from Lake
Pontchartrain, north of the city and
connected to the Gulf of Mexico,
ﬂooded the city. Levees capped with
walls, constructed to keep the water
in the lake and protect low-lying parts
of the city, collapsed in two locations,
and water poured in. Another levee
failed on the Gulf side of the city and
contributed to the ﬂooding. Approxi-
mately 80 percent of New Orleans was
under water from knee deep to rooftop
depths or greater (Figure 5.1). People
who could have evacuated but didn’t
and those who couldn’t because they
lacked transportation took the brunt
of the storm. A part of the city that
wasn’t ﬂooded was the French Quar-
ter (Old Town), which is the area of
New Orleans famous for music and
Mardi Gras.

The people who built New Orleans
over 200 years ago realized that much
of the area was low in elevation and

built on the natural levees of the Mis-
sissippi River. The natural levees were
formed by periodic overbank deposi-
tion of sediment from the river 
over thousands of years. They are 
parallel to the river channel and are
higher than the adjacent land, provid-
ing natural ﬂood protection. As
marshes and swamps were drained 
in lower areas, the city expanded into
low areas with much greater ﬂood
hazard. Much of the city is in a natural
bowl, and parts are 1 to 3 m (3 to 9 ft)
below sea level (Figure 5.2).

It has been known for a long time
that if a large hurricane were to make
a direct or near-direct hit on the city,
extensive ﬂooding and losses would
result. The warnings were not com-
pletely ignored, but sufﬁcient funds
were not forthcoming to maintain the
levees and system of ﬂoodwalls to
protect low-lying areas of the city
from a large hurricane.

The fact that the region is subsid-
ing at highly variable rates from 1 to 
4 m (3 to 12 ft) per 100 years con-
tributed to the ﬂood hazard. Over
short periods, 50 percent to 75 percent
of the subsidence in some areas is nat-
ural, resulting from geologic processes

Property damage

from Hurricane Kat-
rina and costs to reha-
bilitate or rebuild the area
may exceed $100 billion, mak-

ing it the most costly hurricane in
the history of the United States. The
number of human deaths will never
be known for sure, as many bodies
may have been washed out to sea or
buried too deep to be found. The of-
ficial number of deaths is 1,836. The
hurricane and subsequent flooding
set into motion a series of events
that caused significant environmen-
tal consequences. Initial loss of 
life and property from wind damage
and storm surge was immense.

(i.e., movement along faults) that
formed the Gulf of Mexico and the
Mississippi River delta.1 As much as
several meters (more than 10 ft) of
subsidence has occurred in the past
100 years, and, during that period,
sea level has risen about 20 cm (8 in.).
The rise is due in part to global warm-
ing. As the Gulf water and ocean
water warm, they expand, raising 
sea level. The subsidence results in
part from a number of human
processes, including extraction of
groundwater, oil, and gas, as well as
loss of freshwater wetlands that com-
pact and sink when denied sediment
from the Mississippi River. Because
the Mississippi River has artiﬁcial lev-
ees (i.e., embankments constructed
by humans), it no longer delivers sedi-
ment to the wetlands. Therefore, wet-
lands have stopped building up from
sediment accumulation. Before the
levees were constructed in the Missis-
sippi River delta, ﬂoodwater with its
sediment spread across the delta,
helping maintain wetland soils and
plants. The freshwater wetlands near
New Orleans were largely removed
during past decades. As wetlands are
removed, they are replaced by saltwa-
ter ecosystems as sea level rises and
the land continues to subside. The
freshwater wetlands are a better
buffer to winds and storm waves 
than are saltwater wetlands. Tall
trees, such as cypress and other

FIGURE 5.3 Cypress tree Freshwater wetlands along the coast of Louisiana have 
signiﬁcant ecological importance and help protect the coast from wind and large waves
from storms. (Kristine Carrier/iStockphoto)

plants of freshwater wetlands 
(Figure 5.3), provide roughness that
slows down water from high waves 
or storm surge moving inland. It’s
well known that one of the natural
service functions of both saltwater
and freshwater coastal wetlands is to
provide protection to inland areas
from storms.

New Orleans Will Be Rebuilt.
The people of New Orleans are re-
silient and are moving (in some cases

slowly) back into this famous historic
city. We have learned from this event,
and better measures are being taken
to ensure that this kind of catastrophe
is less likely to occur in the future. For
example, in some areas where ﬂood-
waters, even with future levee failure,
will be less than one story high, re-
construction includes ﬂood-proof
buildings with living areas on the sec-
ond ﬂoor.

5.1 Hazards, Disasters, 

and Natural Processes

On a world scale, the occurrences of natural disas-
ters such as ﬂoods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
and  landslides  are  increasing.  Several  criteria  used
to deﬁne a natural disaster are: 10 or more people
are killed, 100 or more people are affected, a declara-
tion of emergency is issued, and a request is made
for international assistance. If any one of these cri-
teria applies, a particular event is considered to be a
natural  disaster.3 The  increase  in  the  number  of

disasters  is,  in  part,  due  to  better  reporting,  but
there are other factors as well:4

• Increases in human population and urbaniza-
tion  are  putting  more  people  in  places  where
natural  processes  may  produce  disasters  for
people. These include regions along the coast
where erosion or tsunami may occur and along
active faults, near volcanoes, or in ﬂood-prone
areas. Poverty in urban regions further increas-
es the chances of disaster, as poor people are
often pushed into the most hazardous areas on
ﬂoodplains or steep slopes.

ﬂood protection of New Orleans, pro-
duced a draft report in June 2006
concerning the hurricane- and
flood-protection system. It acknowl-
edged that the system had evolved
piecemeal over a number of decades
and that it was a system in name only.
Nevertheless, the ﬂood-protection
structures were constructed to pro-
tect the city, and their failure was re-
sponsible for a majority of the ﬂood-
ing that resulted from Hurricane
Katrina in 2005.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

reached the following conclusions:2
• There  were  no  fallback  redundan-
cies  (i.e.,  there  was  no  second-tier
protection) to the ﬂood protection
if  the  primary  ﬂood-control  struc-
tures  failed.  Pumping  stations  de-
signed to remove ﬂoodwaters were
the  only  example  of  a  redundant
system, and they were not designed
to  function  in  a  major  hurricane
with extensive ﬂooding.

• Hurricane Katrina exceeded the de-
sign criteria of the ﬂood-protection
structures. Some levee and ﬂood-
wall failures resulted from being
overtopped by ﬂoodwaters. Others
failed, without being overtopped,
due to erosion from their front side.

• Regional subsidence has been

faster than was appreciated. The
heights of the ﬂood-protection
structures were not adjusted for

Hazards, Disasters, and Natural Processes

143

subsidence, and some of the
ﬂoodwalls and levees were as
much as 1 m (3 ft) below the eleva-
tion at which they were designed.

• Although scientiﬁc knowledge

about hurricanes and storm surges
has increased, this did not lead to
updating the ﬂood-control plan.
What adjustment did occur was
fragmented rather than consistent
and uniform.

• Consequences of ﬂooding were
also concentrated. More than 
75 percent of the people who died
were over 60 years old and were 
located in areas with the greatest
depth of ﬂooding. The larger num-
ber of deaths among the elderly oc-
curred because poor, elderly people
and disabled people were the least
able to evacuate without assistance.
• Parts of the ﬂood- and hurricane-
protection system have been re-
paired at a cost of about $800 mil-
lion since Katrina, and these are
the strongest parts of the ﬂood
protection. At present, however,
the protection level remains the
same as before Katrina.
In fairness to the Army Corps of
Engineers, ﬂood-control structures
are often underfunded, and, as with
New Orleans, construction is spread
over many years. Hopefully, we have
learned from Katrina and will build a
stronger, more effective hurricane-

protection system for the city of New
Orleans, as well as other U.S. cities
where hurricanes are likely to occur.
Can ﬂooding occur again in New

Orleans, even if higher, stronger ﬂood
defenses are constructed? Of course it
can; when a bigger storm strikes, fu-
ture damage is inevitable. If freshwa-
ter marshes are restored and the river
waters of the Mississippi are allowed
to ﬂow through them again, they will
help provide a buffer from winds and
waves. As previously mentioned,
freshwater marshes have trees that
provide a roughness to the land that
slows wind and retards the advance of
waves from the Gulf. Every 1.5 km 
(1 mi) of marsh land can reduce waves
by about 25 cm (1 ft).

Tremendous amounts of money
will need to be spent to make New
Orleans more resistant to storms in
the future. In light of the many bil-
lions of dollars in damages from cata-
strophes, it seems prudent to spend
the money in a proactive way to pro-
tect important resources, particularly
in our major cities.

In the remainder of this chapter,

we will discuss some of the principles
of natural processes we know as haz-
ards and how they produce disasters
and catastrophes. You will learn how
poor land uses and changing land
uses, coupled with population in-
crease, greatly increase the risk of
some hazards.

• Environmental  damage  to  the  land,  such  as
deforestation,  linked  to  poor  land  use  choices
increases  the  frequency  and  potential  sites  of
natural hazards, such as ﬂooding and landslid-
ing. Removal of coastal wetlands and other veg-
etation  renders  the  coast  more  vulnerable  to
wave erosion from tsunami and other storms.
• Climate change linked to rising sea level increas-
es coastal erosion. As the planet warms, deserts
expand, increasing the occurrence of hazardous
dust storms. Warming oceans allow more ener-
gy  to  be  transferred  to  the  atmosphere,  inﬂu-
encing the intensity of damaging storms.

Natural Disasters: Loss of Life 
and Property Damages
Natural disasters are events that cause great loss of
life or property damage—or both—such as earth-
quakes, ﬂoods, and cyclones (hurricanes). Natural
disasters have in the past few decades killed several
million people, with an average worldwide annual loss
of life of about 150,000 people. The ﬁnancial losses re-
sulting from natural disasters now exceed $50 billion
per  year  and  do  not  include  social  impacts,  such  as
loss  of  employment,  mental  anguish,  and  reduced
productivity.  Four  individual  disasters—a  cyclone

Introduction to Natural Hazards

accompanied by ﬂooding in Bangladesh in 1970, an
earthquake in China in 1976, a tsunami in the Indian
Ocean in 2004 and an earthquake in Haiti in 2010—
each  claimed  about  250,000  lives.  These  terrible
disasters (catastrophes) were caused by natural haz-
ards that have always existed—atmospheric distur-
bance  and  tectonic  movement—but  their  extent
was affected by human population density and land
use patterns.

Why Natural Processes Are
Sometimes Hazards
Natural  hazards  are  basically  natural  processes.
These  processes  become  hazardous  when  people
live  or  work  in  areas  where  they  occur.  Natural
processes  can  also  become  hazardous  when  land-
use changes, such as urbanization or deforestation,
affect natural processes, causing ﬂooding or lands-
liding.  It  is  the  environmental  geologist’s  role  to
identify potentially hazardous processes and make
this information available to planners and decision
makers, so that they can formulate various alterna-
tives to avoid or minimize the threat to human life
or property. However, the naturalness of hazards is
a  philosophical  barrier  that  we  encounter  when-
ever we try to minimize their adverse effects. For
example, we try to educate people that a river and
ﬂoodplain,  the  ﬂat  land  adjacent  to  the  river,  are
part of the same natural system and that we should
expect ﬂoods on ﬂoodplains, as the name suggests.

Minimizing  the  ﬂood  hazard  may  be  as  simple  as
not  building  on  ﬂoodplains!  However,  this  seem-
ingly  logical  solution  is  difﬁcult  to  get  across  to
people who see ﬂoodplains as ﬂat land on which to
build houses.

Magnitude and Frequency
The impact of a disastrous event is in part a function
of its magnitude, or the amount of energy released,
and frequency, or recurrence interval; however, it is
inﬂuenced by many other factors, including climate,
geology,  vegetation,  population,  and  land  use.  In
general,  the  frequency  of  a  disastrous  event  is  in-
versely  related  to  the  magnitude.  Small  earth-
quakes, for example, occur more often than do large
ones (see A Closer Look: The Magnitude–Frequency
Concept).

Beneﬁts of Natural Hazards
It  is  ironic  that  the  same  natural  events  that  take
human life and destroy property also provide impor-
tant  beneﬁts,  or  natural  service  functions.  For  ex-
ample,  periodic  ﬂooding  of  the  Mississippi  River
supplies  nutrients  to  the  ﬂoodplain,  forming  the
fertile  soils  used  for  farming.  Flooding,  which
causes  erosion  on  mountain  slopes,  also  delivers
river sediment to beaches (Figure 5.4) and ﬂushes
pollutants  from  estuaries  in  the  coastal  environ-
ment. Landslides may bring beneﬁts to people when
landslide  debris  forms  dams,  creating  lakes  in

A 

Closer 
Look

The Magnitude–Frequency Concept

The magnitude–frequency concept
states that there is generally an in-
verse relationship between the magni-
tude of an event and its frequency. For
example, the larger a ﬂood, the less
frequently such a ﬂood occurs. The
concept also includes the idea that
much of the work of forming Earth’s
surface occurs through events of
moderate magnitude and frequency
rather than through common natural
processes of low magnitude and high
frequency or through extreme events
of high magnitude and low frequency.
As an analogy to the magnitude–
frequency concept, consider the work
of reducing the extent of a forest by
resident termites, human loggers, and
elephants (Figure 5.A). The termites
are numerous and work quite steadily,
but they are so small that they can
never do enough work to destroy all
the trees. The people are fewer and
work less often, but, being stronger
than termites, they can accomplish
more work in a given time. Unlike the
termites, the people can eventually
fell most of the trees. The elephants

are stronger still and can knock down
many trees in a short time, but there
are only a few of them, and they rarely
visit the forest. In the long run, the ele-
phants do less work than the people
and bring about less change.

In our analogy, it is humans who,
with a moderate expenditure of en-
ergy and time, do the most work and
change the forest most drastically.
Similarly, natural events with moder-
ate energy expenditure and moder-
ate frequency are often the most im-
portant shapers of the landscape.
For example, most of the sediment

carried by rivers in regions within a
subhumid climate (most of the east-
ern United States) is transported by
ﬂows of moderate magnitude and fre-
quency. However, there are many ex-
ceptions. In arid regions, for example,
much of the sediment in normally dry
channels may be transported by rare
high-magnitude ﬂows produced by
intense but infrequent rainstorms.
Along the barrier-island coasts of 
the eastern United States, high-
magnitude storms often cut inlets that
cause major changes in the pattern
and ﬂow of sediment (Figure 5.B).

landslide-created  dams  collapse  and  cause  haz-
ardous downstream ﬂooding, dams that remain sta-
ble  can  provide  valuable  water  storage  and  are  an
important aesthetic resource.

Volcanic  eruptions  have  the  potential  to  pro-
duce catastrophes; however, they also provide nu-
merous benefits. They often create new land, as in
the case of the Hawaiian Islands, which are com-

pletely  volcanic  in  origin  (Figure  5.6).  Nutrient-
rich volcanic ash may settle on existing soils and
may  quickly  become  incorporated,  creating  soil
suitable  for  wild  plants  and  crops.  Earthquakes
can  also  provide  us  with  valuable  services.  When
rocks  are  pulverized  during  an  earthquake,  they
may form an impervious clay zone known as fault
gouge along the fault. In many places, fault gouge
has  formed  groundwater  barriers  upslope  from  a
fault,  producing  natural  subsurface  dams  and
water resources. Along some parts of the San An-
dreas fault in the arid Coachella Valley near Indio,
California,  this  process  has  produced  oases,  in
which  pools  of  water  are  surrounded  by  native
palm  trees  in  an  otherwise  desert  environment
(Figure 5.7). In addition, earthquakes are also im-
portant  in  mountain  building  and,  thus,  are  di-
rectly responsible for many of the scenic resources
of the western United States.

Death and Damage Caused 
by Natural Hazards
When we compare the effects of various natural haz-
ards, we ﬁnd that those that cause the greatest loss of
human  life  are  not  necessarily  the  same  ones  that
cause the most extensive property damage. Table 5.1

number of deaths each year is associated with torna-

lightning  (Figure  5.9),  ﬂoods,  and  hurricanes  also
take a heavy toll. Loss of life due to earthquakes can

vary considerably from one year to the next, as a sin-
gle great quake can cause tremendous human loss. It

Angeles area killed approximately 60 people and caused
more  than  $30  billion  in  property  damage.  In  fact,
property damage from individual hazards is consider-
able. Floods, landslides, frost, and expansive soils each
cause mean annual damages in the United States in

excess  of  $1.5  billion.  Surprisingly,  expansive  soils,
clay-rich soils that expand and contract with wetting
and drying, are some of the most costly hazards, caus-
ing  over  $3  billion  in  damages  annually  to  building
foundations, sidewalks (Figure 5.10), driveways, and
swimming pools.

Evaluating Hazards: History, Linkages, Disaster Prediction, and Risk Assessment

149

An  important  aspect  of  all  natural
hazards  is  their  potential  to  produce
catastrophes. A catastrophe is any sit-
uation  in  which  the  damages  to  peo-
ple, property, or society in general are
sufﬁcient to make recovery or rehabil-
itation a long, involved process.6 Table
5.1 shows  the  catastrophe  potential
for the hazards considered. The events
most  likely  to  produce  catastrophes
are  ﬂoods,  hurricanes,  tornadoes,
earthquakes,  volcanic  eruptions,  and
large  wildﬁres  (not  included  in  Table
5.1). Landslides, which generally cover
a smaller area, have a moderate cata-
strophe potential. The catastrophe po-
tential of drought is also moderate: Al-
though  a  drought  may  cover  a  wide
area  and  cause  high  ﬁnancial  losses,
there  is  usually  plenty  of  warning  time  before  its
worst effects are experienced. Hazards with low cata-
strophe  potential  include  coastal  erosion,  frost,
lightning, and expansive soils.

The effects of natural hazards change with time.
Changes in land use patterns that inﬂuence people
to  develop  on  marginal  lands,  urbanization  that
changes the physical properties of Earth materials,
and increasing population all alter the effects of nat-
ural hazards. Although damage from most hazards
in  the  United  States  is  increasing,  the  number  of
deaths from many hazards is decreasing because of
better hazard forecasting and warning to the public.

5.2 Evaluating Hazards: 

History, Linkages, Disaster
Prediction, and Risk
Assessment

Fundamental Principles Concerning
Natural Hazards
The understanding of natural hazards and how we
might minimize their impact on people and the en-
vironment is facilitated through the recognition of
ﬁve principles:

1. Hazards are known from scientiﬁc evaluation.
Natural hazards, such as earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions,  landslides,  and  ﬂoods,  are  natural

FIGURE 5.10 Soil hazard Organic-rich expansive soils are cracking the walls of
this building in Spain. (Edward A. Keller)

processes  that  can  be  identiﬁed  and  studied
using  the  scientiﬁc  method.  Most  hazardous
events  and  processes  can  be  monitored  and
mapped, and their future activity can be evalu-
ated based on the frequency of past events, pat-
terns, and types of precursor events.

2. Risk  analysis  is  an  important  component  in
understanding  impacts  resulting  from  haz-
ardous  processes. Hazardous  processes  are
amenable to risk analysis based on the probabil-
ity of an event occurring and the consequences
resulting from that event; for example, say that
we were to estimate that in any given year in Los
Angeles or Seattle, there is a 5 percent chance of
a moderate earthquake occurring. If we know the
consequence of that earthquake in terms of loss
of life and damage, then we can calculate the risk
to society of that earthquake actually happening.
3. Hazards  are  linked. Hazardous  processes  are
linked in many ways, from simple to complex.
For  example,  earthquakes  can  produce  land-
slides and giant sea waves called tsunamis, and
hurricanes often cause ﬂooding and erosion.

4. Hazardous  events  that  previously  produced
disasters  are  often  now  producing  cata-
strophes. The  size  of  a  natural  hazardous
event, as well as its frequency, is inﬂuenced by
human activity. As a result of increasing human
population  and  poor  land  use  practices,  what
used to be disasters are often now catastrophes.

150

CHAPTER 5

Introduction to Natural Hazards

5. Consequences  of  hazards  can  be  minimized.
Minimizing  the  potential  adverse  conse-
quences and effects of natural hazards requires
an integrated approach that includes scientiﬁc
understanding,  land  use  planning  (regulation
and  engineering),  and  proactive  disaster  pre-
paredness.

Role of History in Understanding
Hazards
A  fundamental  principle  of  understanding  natural
hazards  is  that  they  are  repetitive  events,  and,
therefore,  studying  their  history  provides  much-
needed  information  in  any  hazard-reduction  plan.
Whether  we  are  studying  ﬂood  events,  landslides,
volcanic  eruptions,  or  earthquakes,  the  historical
and recent geologic history of an area is a primary
data  set.  For  example,  if  we  wish  to  evaluate  the
ﬂooding history of a particular river, one of the ﬁrst
tasks  is  to  study  the  previous  ﬂoods  of  that  river
system.  This  study  should  include  detailed  evalua-
tion of aerial photographs and maps, reaching as far
back as the record allows. For prehistoric events, we

can study the geologic environment for evidence of
past ﬂoods, such as the sequence of ﬂood deposits
on a ﬂoodplain. Often, these contain organic mater-
ial that may be dated to provide a history of prehis-
toric ﬂood events. This history is then linked with
the documented historical record of high ﬂows, pro-
viding a perspective on ﬂooding of the river system
being  evaluated.  Similarly,  if  we  are  investigating
landslides  in  a  particular  river  valley,  studying  the
documented  historical  occurrence  of  these  events
and  linking  that  information  to  prehistoric  land-
slides will provide basic data necessary to better pre-
dict landslides.

A hydrologist’s role in ﬂood analysis is to evaluate
streamﬂow  records  taken  from  sites,  known  as
gauging  stations,  where  streamﬂow  recorders  have
been  established  (Figure  5.11).  Unfortunately,  ex-
cept with larger rivers, the records are usually rela-
tively short, covering only a few years. Most small
streams  have  no  gauging  stations.  Geologists  have
the  observation  skills,  tools,  and  training  to  “read
the  landscape.”  They  can  evaluate  prehistoric  evi-
dence for natural hazards and link that information
with the modern record to provide the perspective

FIGURE 5.11 Monitoring streamflow This stream gauging station on the Merced River in
Yosemite National Park continuously monitors the ﬂow of water in the river. Solar cells provide power.
This is not a “run of the mill” station. It is designed to educate park visitors on how streamﬂow is
recorded. (Edward A. Keller)

of time on a particular process. Environmental geolo-
gists also have the ability to recognize landforms as-
sociated with hazardous processes. In addition, they
recognize  that  the  nature  and  extent  of  a  hazard
varies as the assemblage of landforms varies. For ex-
ample, ﬂooding that occurs in a river valley with a ﬂat
adjacent ﬂoodplain is very different from ﬂooding on

a  delta.  The  river  and  ﬂoodplain  constitute  a  rela-
tively  simple  system,  consisting  of  a  single  channel
bordered  by  the  ﬂoodplain  (Figure  5.12).  Deltas,
however,  are  more  complex  landforms,  produced
when a river enters a lake or an ocean (Figure 5.13).
Deltas  often  have  multiple  channels  that  receive
ﬂoodwaters at various times and places, varying the

Introduction to Natural Hazards

position  of  the  channel  and,  thus,  the  energy  of  a
ﬂood. Processes on deltas are discussed in detail in
Chapter 9, but the general principle of the instabil-
ity  of  channels  associated  with  different  types  of
landforms is the idea we wish to emphasize here.

In summary, before we can truly understand the
nature and extent of a natural hazard, such as ﬂood-
ing at a particular site, we must study in detail the
history  of  the  site,  especially  the  occurrence,  loca-
tion, and effects of past ﬂoods. Understanding this
history provides a perspective on the hazard that al-
lows  for  the  “big  picture”  to  be  better  understood
and appreciated. Integrating historical information
with both present conditions and land use change of
the recent past, such as deforestation and urbaniza-
tion,  allows  for  better  understanding  of  the  hazard.
This results because land use changes can increase
the impact of hazards, such as landslides and ﬂoods.
Studying the record also enables more reliable pre-
diction of future events.

Linkages Between Hazardous Events
Linkages  between  natural  processes  that  are  haz-
ardous to people generally fall into two categories.
First,  many  of  the  hazards  themselves  are  linked.
For  example,  hurricanes  are  often  associated  with
ﬂooding,  and  intense  precipitation  associated  with
hurricanes causes coastal erosion and landslides on
inland slopes. Natural hazards and the characteris-
tics of Earth materials provide a second type of link-
age.  For  example,  the  sedimentary  rock  known  as
shale is composed of loosely cemented or compacted
tiny sediments that are prone to landsliding. Gran-
ite provides another example of the linkage between
natural  hazards  and  Earth  material  characteristics.
Although  generally  strong  and  durable,  granite  is
prone to sliding along fractures within the rock.

Disaster Forecast, Prediction, 
and Warning
A prediction of a hazardous event, such as an earth-
quake, involves specifying the date, time, and size of
the event. This is different from predicting where or
how  often  a  particular  event,  such  as  a  ﬂood,  will
occur. A forecast, on the other hand, has ranges of
certainty.  The  weather  forecast  for  tomorrow  may
state that there is a 40 percent chance of showers.
Learning  how  to  predict  or  forecast  disasters  in
order to minimize loss of life and property damage

is  an  important  endeavor.  For  each  particular  haz-
ard,  we  have  a  certain  amount  of  information;  in
some cases, this information allows us to predict or
forecast events accurately. When insufﬁcient infor-
mation is available, the best we can do is to locate
areas  where  disastrous  events  have  occurred  and
infer  where  and  when  similar  future  events  might
take place. If we know both the probability and the
possible  consequences  of  an  event’s  occurring  at  a
particular location, we can assess the risk the event
poses to people and property, even if we cannot ac-
curately predict when it will occur.

The effects of a speciﬁc disaster can be reduced if
we  can  forecast  or  predict  the  event  and  issue  a
warning. In a given situation, most or all of the fol-
lowing elements are involved:

• Identifying  the  location  where  a  hazardous

event will likely occur

• Determining the probability that an event of a

given magnitude will occur
• Observing precursor events
• Forecasting or predicting the event
• Warning the public

Location. For the most part, we know where a par-
ticular kind of event is likely to occur. On a global
scale, the major zones for earthquakes and volcanic
eruptions  have  been  delineated  by  mapping  earth-
quake foci and the locations of recent volcanic rocks
and  volcanoes.  On  a  regional  scale,  we  can  predict
from  past  eruptions  which  areas  in  the  vicinity  of
certain volcanoes are most likely to be threatened by
large mudﬂows or ash in the event of future erup-
tions. This risk has been delineated for most large
volcanoes, including the Paciﬁc Northwest’s Cascade
Range and volcanoes in Alaska, Japan, Italy, Mexico,
Central and South America, Hawaii, and numerous
other volcanic islands in the oceans of the world. On
a local scale, detailed work with soils, rocks, and hy-
drology may identify slopes that are likely to fail and
cause a landslide or where expansive soils exist. Cer-
tainly,  we  can  predict  where  ﬂooding  is  likely  to
occur  from  the  location  of  the  ﬂoodplain  and  evi-
dence  from  recent  ﬂoods,  such  as  the  location  of
ﬂood debris and high-water lines.

Probability  of Occurrence. Determining  the
probability  that  a  particular  event  will  occur  in  a
particular location within a particular time span is

Evaluating Hazards: History, Linkages, Disaster Prediction, and Risk Assessment

153

an  essential  goal  of  hazard  evaluation.  For  many
large rivers, we have sufﬁcient records of ﬂow to de-
velop probability models that can reasonably predict
the average number of ﬂoods of a given magnitude
that  will  occur  in  a  given  time  period.  Likewise,
droughts may be assigned probability on the basis of
past  occurrence  of  rainfall  in  the  region.  However,
these  probabilities  are  similar  to  the  chances  of
throwing a particular number on a die or drawing an
inside straight in poker: The element of chance is al-
ways  present.  For  example,  a  10  year  ﬂood  may
occur on the average of every 10 years, but it is pos-
sible for several ﬂoods of this magnitude to occur in
any  one  year,  just  as  it  is  possible  to  throw  two
straight sixes with a die.

Precursor  Events. Many  hazardous  events  are
preceded  by  precursor  events.  For  example,  the
surface  of  the  ground  may  creep,  or  move  slowly
down  a  slope,  for  a  period  of  time  (e.g.,  days  to
months) before a landslide. Often, the rate of creep
increases  up  to  when  the  landslide  occurs.  Volca-
noes sometimes swell or bulge before an eruption,
and,  often,  emissions  of  volcanic  gases  accompa-
nied  by  seismic  activity  signiﬁcantly  increase  in
local  areas  surrounding  the  volcano.  Foreshocks
and  anomalous,  or  unusual,  uplift  may  precede
earthquakes.  Precursor  events  help  predict  when
and where an event is likely to happen. For exam-
ple, landslide creep or swelling of a volcano may re-
sult in the issuance of a warning, allowing people to
evacuate a hazardous area.

Forecast. When  a  forecast  of  an  event  is  issued,
the certainty of the event is given usually as the per-
centage chance of something happening. When we
hear  a  forecast  of  a  hazardous  event,  it  means  we
should be prepared for the event.

Prediction. It is sometimes possible to accurately
predict when  certain  natural  events  will  occur.
Flooding  of  the  Mississippi  River,  which  occurs  in
the spring in response to snowmelt or very large re-
gional storm systems, is fairly common, and we can
often predict when the river will reach a particular
ﬂood  stage,  or  water  level.  When  hurricanes  are
spotted far out to sea and tracked toward shore, we
can  predict  when  and  where  they  will  likely  strike
land. Tsunami, or seismic sea waves, generated by
disturbance of ocean waters by earthquakes or sub-
marine  volcanoes,  may  also  be  predicted.  The
tsunami warning system has been fairly successful
in  the  Pacific  Basin  and  can  predict  the  arrival  of
the waves. A short time prediction of a hazardous
event,  such  as  a  hurricane,  motivates  us  to  act
quickly to reduce potential consequences before the
event happens.

Warning. After  a  hazardous  event  has  been  pre-
dicted or a forecast has been made, the public must
be warned. Information leading to a warning about
a  possible  disaster,  such  as  a  large  earthquake  or
ﬂood,  should  move  along  a  path  similar  to  that
shown  in  Figure  5.14.  The  public  does  not  always
welcome  such  warnings,  however,  especially  when

CHAPTER 5

Introduction to Natural Hazards

the predicted event does not come to pass. In 1982,
when  geologists  advised  that  a  volcanic  eruption
near  Mammoth  Lakes,  California,  was  quite  likely,
the  advisory  caused  a  loss  of  tourist  business  and
apprehension  on  the  part  of  the  residents.  The
eruption did not occur, and the advisory was even-
tually  lifted.  In  July  1986,  a  series  of  earthquakes
occurred  over  a  4  day  period  in  the  vicinity  of
Bishop,  California,  in  the  eastern  Sierra  Nevada.
The initial earthquake was relatively small and was
felt only locally; but a later, larger earthquake caus-
ing  some  damage  also  occurred.  Investigators  con-
cluded that there was a high probability that an even
larger  quake  would  occur  in  the  same  area  in  the
near  future  and  issued  a  warning.  Local  business
owners, who feared the loss of summer tourism, felt
that the warning was irresponsible; in fact, the pre-
dicted quake never materialized.

Incidents  of  this  kind  have  led  some  people  to
conclude  that  scientiﬁc  predictions  are  worthless
and  that  advisory  warnings  should  not  be  issued.
Part of the problem is poor communication between
the  investigating  scientists  and  reporters  for  the
media (see A Closer Look: Scientists, Hazards, and
the  Media).  Newspaper,  television,  and  radio  re-
ports may fail to explain the evidence or the proba-
bilistic  nature  of  disaster  prediction.  This  failure
leads the public to expect completely accurate state-
ments  about  what  will  happen.  Although  scientiﬁc
predictions  of  volcanic  eruptions  and  earthquakes
are not always accurate, scientists have a responsi-
bility to publicize their informed judgments. An in-
formed public is better able to act responsibly than
an  uninformed  public,  even  if  the  subject  makes
people  uncomfortable.  Ship  captains,  who  depend
on  weather  advisories  and  warnings  of  changing
conditions, do not suggest that they would be better
off  not  knowing  about  an  impending  storm,  even
though the storm might veer and miss the ship. Just
as  weather  warnings  have  proved  very  useful  for
planning ships’ routes, ofﬁcial warnings of hazards,
such as earthquakes, landslides, and ﬂoods, are also
useful to people making decisions about where they
live, work, and travel.

Consider once more the prediction of a volcanic
eruption in the Mammoth Lakes area of California.
The seismic data suggested to scientists that molten
rock was moving toward the surface. In view of the
high  probability  that  the  volcano  would  erupt  and
the possible loss of life if it did, it would have been

irresponsible for scientists not to issue an advisory.
Although the eruption did not occur, the warning led
to the development of evacuation routes and consid-
eration  of  disaster  preparedness.  This  planning  may
prove useful in the future; it is likely that a volcanic
eruption will occur in the Mammoth Lakes area in the
future. The most recent event occurred only 600 years
ago! In the end, the result of the prediction is a better-
informed community that will be better able to deal
with an eruption when it does occur.

Risk Assessment
Before  discussing  and  considering  adjustments  to
hazards,  people  must  have  a  good  idea  of  the  risk
they face under various scenarios. Risk assessment
is a rapidly growing ﬁeld in the analysis of hazards,
and its use should probably be expanded.

Risk  Determination. The  risk of  a  particular
event is deﬁned as the probability of that event’s oc-
curring multiplied by the consequences should it ac-
tually  occur.8 Consequences,  such  as  damages  to
people, property, economic activity, and public ser-
vice, may be expressed in a variety of scales. If, for
example,  we  are  considering  the  risk  from  earth-
quake damage to a nuclear reactor, we may evaluate
the  consequences  in  terms  of  radiation  released,
which can further be translated into damage to peo-
ple and other living things. In any such assessment,
it is important to calculate the risks of various pos-
sible events—in this example, earthquakes of vari-
ous  magnitudes.  A  large  earthquake  has  a  lower
probability of occurring than does a small one, but
its consequences are likely to be greater.

Acceptable  Risk. Determining  acceptable  risk is
complicated. The risk that an individual is willing to
endure is dependent upon the situation. Driving an
automobile is fairly risky, but most of us accept that
risk as part of living in the modern world. However,
acceptable risk from a nuclear power plant is very
low  because  we  consider  almost  any  risk  of  radia-
tion poisoning unacceptable. Nuclear power plants
are  controversial  because  many  people  perceive
them as high-risk facilities. Even though the proba-
bility of a nuclear accident due to a geologic hazard,
such as an earthquake, may be quite low, the associ-
ated consequences could be high, resulting in a rela-
tively high risk.

A 

Closer 
Look

Scientists, Hazards, and the Media

People today learn what is happen-
ing in the world by watching televi-
sion, listening to the radio, surﬁng
the Internet, and reading newspa-
pers and magazines. Reporters for
the media are generally more inter-
ested in the impact of a particular
event on people than in its scientiﬁc
aspects. Even major volcanic erup-
tions or earthquakes in unpopulated
areas may receive little media atten-
tion, whereas moderate or even
small events in populated areas are
reported in great detail. The news
media want to sell stories, and spec-
tacular events that affect people and
property “sell.”7

Establishing good relationships

between scientists and the news
media is a goal that may be difﬁcult
to always achieve. In general, scien-
tists tend to be conservative, critical
people who are afraid of being mis-
quoted. They may perceive reporters

as pushy and aggressive or as willing
to present half-truths while empha-
sizing differences in scientiﬁc opinion
to embellish a story. Reporters, on
the other hand, may perceive scien-
tists as an uncooperative and aloof
group who speak in impenetrable
jargon and are unappreciative of the
deadlines that reporters face.7 These
statements about scientists and
media reporters are obviously stereo-
typical. In fact, both groups have
high ethical and professional stan-
dards; nevertheless, communication
problems and conﬂicts of interest
often occur, affecting the objectivity
of both groups.

Because scientists have an obliga-
tion to provide the public with infor-
mation about natural hazards, it is
good policy for a research team to
pick one spokesperson to interact
with the media to ensure that infor-
mation is presented as consistently

as possible. Suppose, for example,
that scientists are studying a swarm
of earthquakes near Los Angeles, and
speculation exists among them re-
garding the signiﬁcance of the
swarm. Standard operating proce-
dure for Earth scientists working on a
problem is to develop several work-
ing hypotheses and future scenarios.
However, when scientists are work-
ing with the news media on a topic
that concerns people’s lives and
property, their reports should be
conservative evaluations of the evi-
dence at hand, presented with as lit-
tle jargon as possible. Reporters, for
their part, should strive to provide
their readers, viewers, or listeners
with accurate information that the
scientists have veriﬁed. Embarrassing
scientists by misquoting them will
only lead to mistrust and poor com-
munication between scientists and
journalists.

Institutions such as the government and banks ap-
proach the topic of acceptable risk from an economic
point of view rather than a personal perception of the
risk. For example, a bank will consider how much risk
it  can  tolerate  with  respect  to  ﬂooding.  The  federal
government  may  require  that  any  property  that  re-
ceives a loan from that bank not have a ﬂood hazard
that exceeds 1 percent per year—that is, protection
up to and including a 100 year ﬂood.

Problems and Opportunities for Risk Assess-
ment. A  frequent  problem  of  risk  analysis,  with
the  exception  of  ﬂooding  on  a  river  with  a  long
record of past ﬂoods, is lack of reliable data available
for analyzing the probability of an event. It can be
difﬁcult  to  assign  probabilities  to  geologic  events,

such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, because
the known chronology of past events is often inade-
quate.8 Similarly,  it  may  be  difﬁcult  to  determine
the consequences of an event or a series of events.
For  example,  if  we  are  concerned  about  the  conse-
quences of releasing radiation into the environment,
local  biological,  geologic,  hydrologic,  and  meteoro-
logical information must be gathered to evaluate the
radiation’s effects. This information may be complex
and  difﬁcult  to  analyze.  Despite  these  limitations,
methods  of  determining  the  probability  of  earth-
quakes  and  volcanic  eruptions  are  improving,  as  is
our  ability  to  estimate  consequences  of  hazardous
events.  Certainly,  risk  assessment  is  a  step  in  the
right  direction  and  should  be  expanded.  As  more
is  learned  about  determining  the  probability  and

156

CHAPTER 5

Introduction to Natural Hazards

consequences of a hazardous event, we will be able to
provide more reliable forecasts and predictions nec-
essary for decision making, such as when to issue a
warning or evacuate people from harm’s way.

5.3 The Human Response 

to Hazards

Often, the manner in which we deal with hazards is
primarily  reactive.  After  a  disaster,  we  engage  in
searching  for  and  rescuing  survivors,  ﬁreﬁghting,
and  providing  emergency  food,  water,  and  shelter.
There is no denying that these activities reduce loss
of life and property and need to be continued. How-
ever, the move to a higher level of hazard reduction
will require increased efforts to anticipate disasters
and  their  impact.  Land  use  planning  to  avoid  haz-
ardous locations, hazard-resistant construction, and
hazard modiﬁcation or control, such as ﬂood control

channels,  are  some  of  the  adjustments  that  antici-
pate  future  disastrous  events  and  may  reduce  our
vulnerability to them.6

Reactive Response: Impact of 
and Recovery from Disasters
The impact of a disaster upon a population may be
either direct or indirect. Direct effects include people
killed, injured, displaced, or otherwise damaged by a
particular event. Indirect effects generally include re-
sponses to the disaster, such as emotional distress,
donation of money or goods, and payment of taxes
to  ﬁnance  the  recovery.  Direct  effects  are  felt  only
by  those  individuals  immediately  affected  by  the
disaster, whereas indirect effects are felt by the pop-
ulace in general.9,10

The  stages  of  recovery  following  a  disaster  are
emergency work, restoration of services and commu-
nication lines, and reconstruction. Figure 5.15 shows

FIGURE 5.15 Recovery from disaster Generalized model of recovery following a disaster. The ﬁrst
2 weeks after a disaster are spent in a state of emergency, in which normal activities are ceased or
changed. During the following 19 weeks, in the restoration phase, normal activities return and function,
although perhaps not at predisaster level. During the reconstruction I phase, for almost 4 years after a dis-
aster, the area is being rebuilt, and normal activities return to predisaster levels. Finally, during reconstruc-
tion II, major construction and development are being done, and normal activities are improved and devel-
oped. (From Kates, R. W., and Pijawka, D. 1977. Reconstruction following disaster. In From Rubble to Monument:

an idealized model of recovery. This model can be ap-
plied  to  actual  recovery  activities  following  events,
such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake in the Los
Angeles area. Restoration began almost immediately
after  the  earthquake.  For  example,  in  the  ﬁrst  few
weeks and months after the earthquake, roads were
repaired and utilities were restored with the help of
an inﬂux of dollars from federal programs, insurance
companies, and other sources. The damaged areas in
Northridge moved quickly from the restoration phase
to  the  reconstruction  I  stage.  We  are  now  well  into
the reconstruction II period following the Northridge
earthquake, and it is important to remember lessons
from  two  previous  disasters:  the  1964  earthquake
that  struck  Anchorage,  Alaska,  and  the  ﬂash  ﬂood
that  devastated  Rapid  City,  South  Dakota,  in  1972.
Anchorage began restoration approximately 1 month
after  the  earthquake,  as  money  from  federal  pro-
grams,  insurance  companies,  and  other  sources
poured  in.  As  a  result,  reconstruction  was  a  hectic
process, with different groups and individuals trying
to obtain as much of the available funds as possible.
In Rapid City, on the other hand, the restoration did
not  peak  until  approximately  10  weeks  after  the
ﬂood.  The  community  took  time  to  carefully  think

The Human Response to Hazards

157

through the best alternatives to avoid future ﬂooding
problems.  As  a  result,  Rapid  City  today  has  an  en-
tirely different land use on the ﬂoodplain. The ﬂood-
plain is now a greenbelt, with golf courses and other
such  activities,  which  has  greatly  reduced  the  ﬂood
hazard  in  the  area  (Figure  5.16).  Conversely,  the
rapid  restoration  and  reconstruction  in  Anchorage
were accompanied by little land-use planning. Apart-
ments and other buildings were hurriedly constructed
across  areas  that  had  suffered  ground  rupture  and
had  simply  been  ﬁlled  in  and  regraded.  By  ignoring
the  potential  beneﬁts  of  careful  land-use  planning,
Anchorage  is  vulnerable  to  the  same  type  of  earth-
quake damage that it suffered in 1964.6,9,10

In  Northridge,  the  effects  of  the  earthquake  on
highway  overpasses  and  bridges,  buildings,  and
other structures have been carefully evaluated to de-
termine  how  improved  engineering  standards  for
construction of new structures or strengthening of
older  structures  might  be  implemented  during  the
reconstruction II period (Figure 5.15). Future earth-
quakes of moderate to large intensity are certain to
occur again in the Los Angeles area. Therefore, we
must continue efforts in the area of earthquake haz-
ard reduction.

Floodplain

CHAPTER 5

Introduction to Natural Hazards

Anticipatory Response: Perceiving,
Avoiding, and Adjusting to Hazards
The options we choose, individually or as a society,
for avoiding or minimizing the impacts of disasters
depend, in part, on our hazard perception. A good
deal of work has been done in recent years to try to
understand  how  people  perceive  various  natural
hazards. This work is important because the success
of hazard-reduction programs depends on the atti-
tudes  of  the  people  likely  to  be  affected  by  the
hazard. Although there is informed perception and
understanding  of  a  hazard  at  the  institutional 
level among government agencies, such as the U.S.
Geological  Survey  and  state  or  local  ﬂood  control
agencies,  this  may  not  ﬁlter  down  to  the  general
population.  This  lack  of  understanding  is  particu-
larly true with events that occur infrequently; peo-
ple are more aware of situations, such as large ﬂoods
and brush or forest ﬁres, that may occur every few
years or decades (Figure 5.17). There are often local
ordinances  to  help  avoid  or  minimize  damages  re-
sulting  from  these  events.  For  example,  in  some
areas of southern California, local regulations stipu-
late that homes must be roofed with shingles that do
not burn readily. Other regulations include manda-

tory  installation  of  sprinkler  systems  and  require
that lots be cleared of brush. Such safety measures
are often noticeable during the rebuilding phase fol-
lowing a ﬁre.

One  of  the  most  environmentally  sound  adjust-
ments  to  hazards  involves  land-use  planning.  For
example,  people  can  avoid  building  on  ﬂoodplains,
in  areas  where  there  are  active  landslides,  or  in
places  where  coastal  erosion  is  likely  to  occur.  In
many  cities,  ﬂoodplains  have  been  delineated  and
zoned  for  a  particular  land  use.  With  respect  to
landslides,  legal  requirements  for  soil  engineering
and  engineering  geology  studies  at  building  sites
may  greatly  reduce  potential  damages.  Damages
from coastal erosion can be minimized by requiring
adequate setback of buildings from the shore line or
sea  cliff.  Although  it  may  be  possible  to  control
physical  processes  in  speciﬁc  instances,  land-use
planning to accommodate natural processes is often
preferable  to  technology-based  solutions  that  may
or may not work.
Insurance. Insurance is another option that peo-
ple  may  exercise  in  dealing  with  natural  hazards.
Flood insurance and earthquake insurance are com-
mon in many areas. However, because of large losses

FIGURE 5.17 Killer wildfire Wildﬁre in October 1991 devastated this Oakland, 
California, neighborhood. This ﬁre killed 25 people and destroyed more than 3,000 homes,
with damages of about $1.7 billion. (Karl Mondon/Contra Costa Times/Newscom)

following  the  1994  Northridge  earthquake,  several
insurance companies announced that they would no
longer  offer  earthquake  insurance  to  residents  of
the area. Florida homeowners have difﬁculty obtain-
ing  insurance  after  costly  hurricanes  in  the  past
decade.  Some  large  private  insurance  companies
have dropped coverage to hundreds of thousands of
home owners. Hurricanes typically cause a few bil-
lions of dollars in damage, and a direct hit to Miami
could inﬂict damages as high as $50 billion. As a re-
sult,  Florida  has  a  state  sponsored  insurance  pro-
gram that may cause a tremendous ﬁnancial liability
to the people of the state should a high magnitude
hurricane strike a populated part of the state.

Evacuation. In the states along the Gulf of Mexico
and  along  the  eastern  coast  of  the  United  States,
evacuation is an important option or adjustment to
the hurricane hazard. Often, there is sufﬁcient time
for people to evacuate, provided that they heed the
predictions and warnings. However, if people do not
react quickly and if the affected area is a large urban
region,  evacuation  routes  may  be  blocked  by  resi-
dents  leaving  in  a  last-minute  panic.  Successful
evacuation from areas of volcanic eruptions is men-
tioned in Chapter 8.

Disaster  Preparedness. Individuals,  families,
cities,  states,  and  even  entire  nations  can  practice
disaster preparedness. Training individuals and in-
stitutions to handle large numbers of injured people
or  people  attempting  to  evacuate  an  area  after  a
warning is issued is particularly important in disas-
ter preparedness.

The Human Response to Hazards

159

Artiﬁcial Control of Natural
Processes
Attempts at artiﬁcial control of natural processes such
as landslides, ﬂoods, and lava ﬂows have had mixed
success. Seawalls constructed to control coastal ero-
sion may protect property to some extent but tend
to  narrow  or  even  eliminate  the  beach.  Even  the
best-designed  artiﬁcial  structures  cannot  be  ex-
pected  to  adequately  defend  against  an  extreme
event, although retaining walls and other structures
that  defend  slopes  from  landslides  have  generally
been  successful  when  well  designed  (Figure  5.18).
Even the casual observer has probably noticed the
variety  of  such  structures  along  highways  and
urban land in hilly areas. These have limited impact
on  the  environment  but  are  necessary  where  con-
struction demands that artiﬁcial cuts be excavated
or where unstable slopes impinge on human struc-
tures. Common methods of ﬂood control are chan-
nelization  and  construction  of  dams  and  levees.
Unfortunately,  ﬂood  control  projects  tend  to  pro-
vide  ﬂoodplain  residents  with  a  false  sense  of 
security; no method can be expected to absolutely
protect  people  and  their  property  from  high-
magnitude ﬂoods. We will return to this discussion
in Chapter 9.

All  too  often,  people  choose  to  simply  bear  the
loss  caused  by  a  natural  disaster.  Many  people  are
optimistic about their chances of making it through
any  sort  of  disaster  and  take  little  action  in  their
own  defense,  particularly  in  the  cases  of  hazards
such  as  volcanic  eruptions  and  earthquakes  that
occur only rarely in a particular area. Regardless of

Worldwide,  the 
impact  on  people  from
weather-related  disasters  in  the  past  two
decades was catastrophic, killing several tens
of thousands of people and displacing several
hundred  million  people  from  their  homes
while  inﬂicting  over  $100  billion  in  dam-
ages.11 The trend is clear: The number of se-
vere  weather  events  (e.g.,  storms,  ﬂoods,
drought, heat waves, cold) are increasing.

Land Use Change, 
and Natural Hazards

the  strategy  we  choose  either  to  minimize  or  to
avoid  hazards,  it  is  imperative  that  we  understand
and anticipate hazards and their physical, biological,
economic, and social impacts.

5.4 Global Climate and Hazards
Global  and  regional  climatic  change  may  signiﬁ-
cantly  affect  the  incidence  of  hazardous  natural
events,  such  as  storms  (i.e.,  ﬂoods,  erosion),  land-
slides,  drought,  and  ﬁres.  Global  warming  associ-
ated  with  climate  change  may  also  have  an  impact
on natural hazards. (We will discuss global warming
in detail in Chapter 18.)

How  might  a  climatic  change  affect  the  magni-
tude and frequency of disastrous natural events? As
a  result  of  global  warming,  sea  level  will  rise  as
glacial ice melts and warming ocean waters expand.
This  rise  in  sea  level  will  lead  to  an  increase  in
coastal erosion. With a change in climatic patterns,
food production areas will shift as some regions re-
ceive  more  precipitation  and  others  less  than  they
do now. Deserts and semiarid areas would likely ex-
pand,  and  more  northern  latitudes  could  become
more productive. Such changes could lead to global
population  shifts,  which  could  precipitate  wars  or
major social and political upheavals.

Global  warming,  with  warming  of  the  oceans  of
the  world,  will  channel  more  energy  from  warmer

Population Increase and 
Hazardous Events
Population growth throughout the world is a major
environmental problem. And, as our population in-
creases,  the  need  for  planning  to  minimize  losses
from  natural  disasters  also  increases.  Speciﬁcally,
an increase in population puts a greater number of
people  at  risk  from  a  natural  event;  it  also  forces
more people to settle in hazardous areas, creating
additional risks. The risks of both high population
density  and  living  in  a  danger  zone  are  dramati-
cally illustrated by the loss of thousands of lives in
Colombia in 1985. (See A Closer Look: Nevado del
Ruiz:  A  Story  of  People,  Land  Use,  and  Volcanic
Eruption.)

Mexico  City  provides  another  example  of  the
risks  associated  with  high  population  density  cou-
pled with living in a dangerous zone. Mexico City is
the center of the world’s most populous urban area.
Approximately  23  million  people  are  concentrated
in an area of about 2,300 km2 (890 mi2), and about
one-third of the families live in a single room. The
city  is  built  on  ancient  lake  beds  that  accentuate
earthquake shaking, and parts of the city have been
sinking at the rate of a few centimeters per year, due
in part to groundwater withdrawal. The subsidence
has not been uniform, so the buildings tilt and are
even  more  vulnerable  to  the  shaking  of  earth-
quakes.12 In  September  1985,  Mexico  endured  a

Population Increase, Land Use Change, and Natural Hazards

161

large damaging earthquake that killed about 10,000
people  in  Mexico  City  alone.  Haiti,  with  rapid
human population growth, experienced a catastrophic
earthquake in 2010 that damaged or destroyed about
200,000  homes  and  buildings.  About  one third  of 
the  population  of  Haiti  were  directly  affected  by
the earthquake, and more than 250,000 people were
killed  (see  Chapter  1 opening  case  history).  With
fewer people crammed into the capital city, and fewer
people living in substandard buildings that could not
withstand earthquake shaking there would have been
far fewer deaths in Haiti.

Land Use Change and Hazardous
Events
During the past 20 years a large number of great ca-
tastrophes occurred worldwide. Although there are
several  hundred  disasters  from  natural  hazardous
events each year, only a few are classiﬁed as great ca-
tastrophes  that  result  in  deaths  or  losses  so  great
that  outside  assistance  is  required.13 During  the
past  half-century,  there  has  been  a  dramatic  in-
crease in great catastrophes, as illustrated in Figure
5.20. For these events, ﬂooding is the major killer of
people, followed by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,

and windstorms. The vast majority of deaths (over
95 percent in recent years) has been in developing
countries. Asia has suffered the greatest losses with
the  majority  of  total  deaths  and  economic  losses.
Losses  on  a  global  scale  (all  countries  included)
would be even worse if it were not for improvements
in  warning,  disaster  preparedness,  and  sanitation
following disasters.3,13 Nevertheless, economic losses
have increased at a faster rate than have the number
of deaths.

Four  of  the  deadly  catastrophes  resulting  from
natural hazards linked to changes in land use were
Hurricane Mitch in 1998, which devastated Central
America; the 1998 ﬂooding of the Yangtze River in
China;  Hurricane  Katrina  in  2005;  and  the  2010
ﬂooding  of  the  Indus  River  in  Pakistan.  Hurricane
Mitch caused approximately 11,000 deaths, and the
ﬂoods in the Yangtze River resulted in nearly 4,000
deaths.  It  has  been  speculated  that  damages  from
these events in Central America and China were par-
ticularly severe because of land use changes that had
occurred.  For  example,  Honduras  has  already  lost
nearly  half  of  its  forests  due  to  timber  harvesting,
and a ﬁre in an area of about 11,000 km2 (4,250 mi2)
occurred in the region before the hurricane. As a re-
sult  of  the  previous  deforestation  and  the  ﬁre,

CHAPTER 5

Introduction to Natural Hazards

A 

Closer 
Look

Nevado del Ruiz: A Story of People, Land Use, 
and Volcanic Eruption

The volcanic eruption of Novem-

ber 13, 1985, followed a year of 
precursor activity, including earth-
quakes and hot-spring activity. 
Volcano monitoring began in July
1985, and in October a hazards map
was completed that correctly identi-
ﬁed the events that occurred on
November 13. The report and ac-
companying map gave a 100 percent
probability that potentially damag-
ing mudﬂows would be produced by

an eruption, as had been the case
with previous eruptions.

The November 13 event, as ex-
pected, started with an explosive
eruption that produced pyroclastic
ﬂows of hot volcanic ash that scoured
and melted glacial ice on the moun-
tain. The ash and melting glacial ice
produced water that generated mud-
ﬂows that raced down river valleys.
Figure 5.C shows the areas affected
by magma that came into contact

A fundamental principle of this chap-
ter is that population increase, cou-
pled with poor land use choices as
well as land use changes (for exam-
ple, forested land with steep slopes
transformed for urban uses), has in-
tensiﬁed impacts of natural hazards.
In some cases, disasters from natural
hazards have become catastrophes.
For example, when the Colombian
volcano Nevado del Ruiz erupted in
1845, a mudﬂow roared down the
eastern slope of the mountain, killing
approximately 1,000 people.
Deposits from that event 
produced rich soils in the 
Lagunillas River valley, and an
agricultural center developed
there. The town that the area
supported was known as
Armero, and by 1985 it was a
prosperous community with
a growing population of
about 23,000 people. On
November 13, 1985, another
mudﬂow associated with a
volcanic eruption buried
Armero, leaving about 21,000
people dead or missing and
inﬂicting more than $200 
million in property damage. It
was population increase dur-
ing the 140 years between
the mudﬂows that multiplied
the death toll by more than
20 times. The ﬂat lands and
rich soil produced by the pre-
vious volcanic eruption lured
people into a hazardous area.
Ironically, the area was 
decimated by the same type
of event that had earlier 
produced productive soils,
stimulating development
and population growth.14

base surges, and pyroclastic ﬂows.
It also shows the location of glacial
ice that contributed the water nec-
essary to produce the mudﬂows.
Of particular signiﬁcance was the
mudﬂow that raced down the
River Lagunillas and destroyed
part of the town of Armero, where
most of the deaths occurred.
Figure 5.D shows the volcano and
the town of Armero. Mudﬂows
buried the southern half of the
town, sweeping buildings com-
pletely off their foundations.15

The real tragedy of the catastro-

phe was that the outcome was
predicted; in fact, there were
several attempts to warn the town
and evacuate it. Hazard maps were
circulated in October, but they
were largely ignored. Figure 5.E
shows the hazard map of events
expected before the eruption and the
events that occurred. This graphically
illustrates the usefulness of volcanic
risk maps.16 Despite these warnings,
there was little response, and, as a
result, approximately 21,000 people
died. Early in 1986, a permanent

Had there been better communica-

quarters to local towns and a better

appreciation of potential volcanic
hazards even 40 km (about 25 mi)
from the volcano, evacuation would
have been possible for Armero. It is
hoped that the lessons learned from
this event will help minimize future
loss of life associated with volcanic
eruptions and other natural disasters.

hillsides  were  stripped  of  vegetation  and  washed
away;  along  with  them  went  farms,  homes,  roads,
and  bridges  (Figure  5.21).  The  story  is  similar  in
central China; recently, the Yangtze River basin lost
about 85 percent of its forest as a result of timber
harvesting and conversion of land to agriculture. As
a result of the land use changes in China, ﬂooding of
the Yangtze River is probably much more common
than it was previously.11 Hurricane Katrina (see the
case  history  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter)  em-
phasized  several  poor  land  use  choices,  including
the  removal  of  coastal  wetlands  that  provide  a
buffer to wind and storm waves. The population of
Pakistan  has  increased  by  more  than  130  million
people in the past 60 years, and many more people
are living along the river with a high ﬂood risk. The
2010 ﬂoods killed over 1,500 people while displac-
ing about 20 million people.

The  hazardous  events  that  caused  catastrophes
since  the  late  1990s  in  Central  America,  the

Caribbean, Asia, China, the United States, and other
parts  of  the  world  may  be  early  warning  signs  of
things  to  come.  It  is  apparent  that  human  activities
are likely increasing the impacts of natural disasters.
In  recognition  of  the  inﬂuence  of  human  activities,
China  has  banned  timber  harvesting  in  the  upper
Yangtze River basin, has prohibited imprudent ﬂood-
plain land uses, and has allocated several billion dol-
lars for reforestation. The lesson being learned is that,
if we wish to minimize damages from natural hazards
in the future, we need to consider human population
growth and land rehabilitation. The goal must be to
achieve  sustainable  development  based  on  both
restoration and maintenance of healthy ecosystems.11
This goal will be difﬁcult to reach, given the pressures
of  human  population  growth  in  many  parts  of  the
world.  The  effects  of  population  increase  emphasize
the  need  to  control  human  population  growth  if  we
are  to  solve  pressing  environmental  problems  and
reach our goal of sustaining our environment.

Summary

Our discussion of natural processes
suggests a view of nature as dynamic
and changing. This understanding
tells us that we cannot view our envi-
ronment as ﬁxed in time. A landscape
without natural hazards would also
have less variety; it would be safer but
less interesting and probably less aes-
thetically pleasing. The jury is still out
on how much we should try to control
natural hazards and how much we
should allow them to occur. However,
we should remember that disturbance
is natural and that management of
natural resources must include man-
agement for and with disturbances
such as ﬁres, storms, and ﬂoods.

A fundamental principle of envi-

ronmental geology is that there
have always been Earth processes that
are dangerous to people. These become
hazards when people live close to the
source of danger or when they modify
a natural process or landscape in a
way that makes it more dangerous.
Natural events that will continue to
cause deaths and property damage 
include ﬂooding, landslides, earth-
quakes, volcanic activity, wind, expan-
sive soils, drought, ﬁre, and coastal
erosion. The frequency of a hazardous
event is generally inversely related to
its magnitude; its impact on people
depends on its frequency and magni-
tude, as well as on such diverse fac-
tors as climate, geology, vegetation,
and human use of the land. The same
natural events that create disasters
may also bring about beneﬁts, as
when river ﬂooding or a volcanic
eruption supplies nutrients to soils.
The events causing the greatest

lightning, ﬂoods, and hurricanes, al-
though a single great earthquake can
take a very large toll. Floods, land-
slides, frost, and expansive soils cause
the greatest property damage. Events
most likely to produce a catastrophe
are ﬂoods, hurricanes, tornadoes,
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and
ﬁres. Although in the United States
land use changes, urbanization, and
population increase are causing dam-
ages from most hazards to increase,
better predictions and warning sys-
tems are reducing the number of
deaths from these hazardous
processes.

Some disastrous events can be

forecast or predicted fairly accurately,
including some river ﬂoods and the
arrival of coastal hurricanes and
tsunamis. Precursor events can warn
experts about impending earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions. Once an event
has been forecast or predicted, this
information must be made available
to planners and decision makers in
order to minimize the threat to
human life and property. The manner
in which a warning is issued and how
scientists communicate with the
media and public are particularly sig-
niﬁcant. For many hazards, we cannot
determine when a speciﬁc event will
occur but only note the probability of
occurrence, based on the record of
past occurrences. The risk associated
with an event is the product of the
event’s probability of occurrence and
the likely consequences, should it ac-
tually occur.

The impact of a disaster upon a
population includes direct effects,
such as people killed, dislocated, or
otherwise damaged, and indirect

number of deaths in the United States
are tornadoes and windstorms,
Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
Increase in human population is forc-
ing many people to live in areas where
natural hazards are more likely, such

as on ﬂoodplains, steep slopes, and
ﬂanks of volcanoes. Population pres-
sure has accelerated land use changes
as more land is urbanized, farmed,

effects, such as emotional distress,
donation of money or goods, and pay-
ment of taxes to ﬁnance recovery.
Recovery often has several stages, in-
cluding emergency work, restoration
of services and communication, and
reconstruction.

The options that individuals or so-
cieties choose for avoiding or adjust-
ing to natural hazards depend in part
on how hazards are perceived. People
tend to be more aware of hazards that
are likely to occur often, such as the
several hurricanes in the Atlantic that
could strike the East and Gulf Coasts
of North America each year. Options
to adjust to hazards range from land
use planning, insurance, and evacua-
tion to disaster preparedness and ar-
tiﬁcial control of natural processes.
For hazards that occur rarely in par-
ticular areas, people often choose to
just bear the loss incurred from the
hazard. Attempts to artiﬁcially con-
trol natural processes have had mixed
success and usually cannot be ex-
pected to defend against extreme
events. Regardless of the approach we
choose, we must increase our under-
standing of hazards and do a better
job of anticipating them.

As the world’s population increases

and we continue to modify our envi-
ronment through changes such as ur-
banization and deforestation, more
people will live on marginal lands and
in hazardous locations. As a result of
population pressure and land use
changes, what were formerly localized
hazards and disasters are now becom-
ing catastrophes. Therefore, as popu-
lation increases, better planning at all
levels will be necessary if we are to
minimize losses from natural hazards.

mined, and harvested for timber. As a
result, hazardous events that were
formerly disasters are becoming cata-
strophes.

166

CHAPTER 5

Introduction to Natural Hazards

Sustainability Living in haz-
ardous areas such as on ﬂoodplains is
not a sustainable practice, as commu-
nities will continue to suffer property
damage and loss of life. Ensuring that
future generations inherit a quality
environment requires that we mini-
mize losses from natural hazards. We
cannot sustain soil resources if we
continue to log forests on steep
slopes, thereby increasing the occur-
rence of landslides and ﬂooding that
erode soil.
Earth as a System Dynamic
Earth systems, such as the atmos-
phere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere,
are responsible for producing

processes that are hazardous to peo-
ple. Change in one part of a system
affects other parts, often in a complex
way. For example, the burning of fossil
fuels is releasing carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere, causing global warm-
ing. One result is that some places will
receive more rain and experience more
violent storms. These increases will
cause changes in the intensity of
ﬂoods and landslide activity.
Scientific Knowledge and Val-
ues Intensive study of hazardous
Earth processes has greatly increased
our knowledge of where these
processes occur, how they work, the
damages they do, and how best to

minimize damages. People’s values,
coupled with scientiﬁc knowledge,
will determine, in part, the choices
we make to reduce the impact of haz-
ardous events. For example, study of
hospitals and schools in an earth-
quake-prone region may reveal that
many are old and likely to fail during
a large earthquake. Fixing the hospi-
tals and schools to withstand shaking
is a logical answer, but it may cost bil-
lions of dollars. Our value of human
life compared with other values will
determine whether we spend the
money to do the necessary work to
strengthen the hospitals and schools.

quake will occur on a given date
is quite low, say 10 percent,
should the general public be in-
formed of the forecast? Should
we wait until a 50 percent confi-
dence or even a 90 percent confi-
dence is assured? Does the length
of time between the forecast and
the event have any bearing on
your answers?

3. Find a friend, and one of you take
the role of a scientist and the other
a news reporter. Assume that the
news reporter is interviewing the
scientist about the nature and ex-
tent of hazardous processes in
your town. After the interview, jot
down some of your thoughts con-
cerning ways in which scientists
communicate with newspeople.
Are there any conﬂicts?

4. Develop a plan for your community

to evaluate the risk of ﬂooding.
How would you go about deter-
mining an acceptable risk?

5. Do you agree or disagree that land

use change and population in-
crease are increasing the risk from
natural processes? Develop a hy-
pothesis and discuss how it might
be tested.

Case History
Italian Earthquake of 2009 and Haiti Earthquake of 2010

Catastrophic earthquakes
are devastating events
that can destroy large
cities and take thou-
sands of lives in a
matter of seconds.
Many millions of
people live in haz-
ardous areas with
substandard pro-
tection against
earthquakes.
As human
population
continues
to increase
in vulnera-
ble areas,
the risk will
continue to
increase.

A strong
earthquake
(magnitude
6.3) struck the
midlevel town
of L’Aqila in 2009,
and many of the buildings

collapsed, killing about 300 people. A

similar earthquake in California
probably would have caused no or
very few deaths. The Italian event
was a catastrophe because the 
buildings were not constructed to
sustain moderate seismic shaking.1
It is a classic case of people not
heeding warnings about future
earthquakes and continuing to build
substandard structures. The Italian
earthquake was a human-caused
catastrophe that could have and
should have been avoided. California
and other places that design and
construct buildings resistant to col-
lapse during earthquake shaking 
may suffer damage from an earth-
quake, but human loss of life is mini-
mized. Until older buildings are
retroﬁtted to withstand seismic
shaking and new buildings are held
to a higher engineering standard,
earthquakes will continue to take
many more lives in places that face
earthquake hazard.

On January 12, 2010, a major

earthquake (magnitude 7.0) struck
Haiti and killed about 240,000 peo-
ple (an appalling loss of life).2 Earth-

quakes in recent years that have
taken thousands of lives have a com-
mon dominator: They usually cause
tremendous loss of life because the
buildings people were in collapsed. In
Haiti, homes, schools, hospitals, and
industrial buildings were subject to
collapse during strong shaking be-
cause they were not constructed with
earthquakes in mind or because the
required construction codes were ig-
nored—presumably to save money.
In short, most deaths were human-
caused.3 We have experience with
strong shaking in California (North-
ridge in 1994) and, more recently, in
Chile (February 27, 2010), where a
magnitude 8.8 earthquake, about
500 times as strong as the Haiti
earthquake a month earlier, killed
about 800 people—an astronomi-
cally lower number than in Haiti.4
Where buildings are designed to
withstand shaking and are built
properly, as are many in Chile and
California, deaths from collapsed
buildings are many times lower 
than in areas where construction 
is substandard.

6.1 Introduction to

Earthquakes

There  are  approximately  1  million  earthquakes  a
year  that  can  be  felt  by  people  somewhere  on
Earth.  However,  only  a  small  percentage  of  these
can be felt very far from their source. Earthquakes
can  be  compared  with  one  another  by  the  energy
they release, known as their magnitude, or by their
intensity of shaking, referred to as ground motion,
and  the  resulting  impact  on  people  and  society.
Table  6.1 lists  selected  major  earthquakes  that
have struck the United States since the early nine-
teenth century.

6.2 Earthquake Magnitude
When a news release is issued about an earthquake, it
generally  gives  information  about  where  the  earth-
quake started, known as the epicenter. The epicenter
is the location on the surface of Earth above the focus,
which is the point at depth where the rocks ruptured
to produce the earthquake (Figure 6.1, page 172). The
news  also  reports  moment  magnitude,  which  is  a
measure  of  the  energy  released  by  the  earthquake.
The moment magnitude is based, in part, upon im-
portant physical characteristics, including the seismic
moment, the area that ruptured along a fault plane
during  an  earthquake,  the  amount  of  movement  or

fault slip during an earthquake, and the rigidity (i.e.,
shear modulus) of the rocks. The seismic moment is
estimated  by  examining  the  records  from  seismo-
graphs (i.e., instruments that record earthquake mo-
tion), determining the amount and length of rupture,
and  estimating  the  shear  modulus  (from  laboratory
testing  of  rocks).  The  moment  magnitude  (Mw)  is
then determined by Mw ⫽ 2/3 log M0 ⫺ 10.7, where
M0 is the seismic moment.

Before  the  use  of  moment  magnitude,  Richter
magnitude,  named  after  the  famous  seismologist
Charles Richter, was used to describe the energy re-
leased by an earthquake. Richter magnitude is based
upon the amplitude, or size, of the largest seismic wave
produced during an earthquake. A seismograph is an
instrument  that  records  earthquake  displacements;

seismographs  produce  seismographic  records,  or
seismograms. The amplitude recorded is converted to
a magnitude on a logarithmic scale; that is, each inte-
ger increase in Richter magnitude represents a ten-
fold  increase  in  amplitude.  For  example,  a  Richter
magnitude 7 earthquake produces a displacement on
the seismogram 10 times larger than does a magni-
tude 6. Although the Richter magnitude remains the
best-known earthquake scale to many people, earth-
quake scientists, known as seismologists, do not com-
monly use it. For large, damaging earthquakes, the
Richter  magnitude  is  approximately  equal  to  the
moment magnitude, which is more commonly used
today. In this book, we will simply refer to the size of
an  earthquake  as  its  magnitude,  M,  without  desig-
nating a Richter or moment magnitude.

FIGURE 6.1 Basic earthquake features Block diagram showing fault plane, amount of dis-
placement, rupture area, focus, and epicenter. Rupture starts at the focus and propagates up, down,
and laterally. During a major to giant earthquake, slip may be 2 to 20 m along a fault length of 100 km
or more. Rupture area may be 1,000 km2 or more.

The  magnitude  and  frequency  of  earthquakes
worldwide are shown in Table 6.2. An event of mag-
nitude 8 (M 8) or above is considered a great earth-
quake,  capable  of  causing  widespread  catastrophic
damage.  In  any  given  year,  there  is  a  good  chance
that  one  M  8  event  will  occur  somewhere  in  the
world. A M 7 event is a major earthquake, capable of
causing widespread and serious damage. Magnitude
6 signiﬁes a strong earthquake that can cause consid-
erable damage, depending upon factors such as loca-
tion, surface materials, and quality of construction.
Ground motion can be recorded as the displacement
or actual separation of rocks produced by an earth-
quake. Relationships between change in magnitude
and change in displacement and energy are shown in
Table  6.3.  This  table  illustrates  that  the  difference
between a M 6 and a M 7 earthquake is considerable.
A  M  7  earthquake  releases  about  32  times  more

energy  than  a  M  6  earthquake,  and  the  amount  of
displacement, or ground motion, is 10 times greater.
If we compare a M 5 with a M 7 earthquake, the dif-
ferences  are  much  greater.  The  energy  released  is
about 1,000 times greater. The topic of earthquake
magnitude  is  introduced  here  to  help  compare  the
severity of earthquakes. We will return to a more de-
tailed  discussion  of  this  topic  later  in  this  chapter
when earthquake processes are discussed.

Earthquake Catastrophes
Catastrophic,  or  great,  earthquakes  are  devastating
events that can destroy large cities and take thousands
of lives in a matter of seconds. A sixteenth-century
earthquake in China reportedly claimed 850,000 lives.
More  recently,  a  1923  earthquake  near  Tokyo  killed
143,000 people, and a 1976 earthquake in China killed

several  hundred  thousand.  In  1985,  an  earthquake
originating  beneath  the  Paciﬁc  Ocean  off  Mexico
(M 8.1) caused 10,000 deaths in Mexico City, several
hundred  kilometers  from  the  source.  Exactly  1  year
after  the  Northridge  earthquake,  the  January  17,
1995,  Kobe,  Japan,  earthquake  (M  7.2)  killed  more
than 5,000 and injured 27,000 people, while destroy-
ing 100,000 buildings and causing over $100 billion in
property  damages  (Figure  6.2a).  The  January 26,
2001,  Gujarat,  India,  earthquake  (M  7.7)  killed  as

many as 30,000 people, injured 166,000, damaged or
destroyed  about  1  million  homes,  and  left  600,000
people homeless. An earthquake on October 8, 2005,
of  M  7.6,  struck  northern  Pakistan.  Although  the
epicenter was in Pakistan, extensive damage also oc-
curred  in  Kashmir  and  India  (Figure  6.2b).  More
than  80,000  people  were  killed  and  more  than
30,000  buildings  collapsed.  Entire  villages  were
destroyed,  some  buried  by  landslides  triggered  by
the  violent  shaking.  One  of  the  largest  continental
earthquakes (M 7.9) to strike a highly populated
region in the past 100 years occurred in the Sichuan
province of China in 2008, killing about 87,500 peo-
ple.  Some  villages  were  completely  buried  by  land-
slides,  and  more  than  5  million  buildings  collapsed
(Figure 6.2c).5–7 Finally the 2010 earthquake in Haiti
killed about 240,000 people (see case history opening
this chapter).

6.3 Earthquake Intensity
A qualitative way of comparing earthquakes is to use
the Modiﬁed Mercalli Scale, which describes 12 divi-
sions of intensity, based on observations concerning
the severity of shaking during an earthquake (Table
6.4,  page  175).  Intensity  reﬂects  how  people  per-
ceived the shaking and how structures responded to
the  shaking.  Whereas  a  particular  earthquake  has
only one magnitude, different levels of intensity may
be assigned to the same earthquake at different loca-
tions,  depending  on  proximity  to  the  epicenter  and
local geologic conditions. Figure 6.3 (page 175) is a
map  showing  the  spatial  variability  of  intensity  for
the  1971  San  Fernando  earthquake  (M  6.6).  Such
maps,  produced  from  questionnaires  sent  to  resi-
dents in the epicentral region after an earthquake, are
a valuable, although crude, index of ground shaking.
One  of  the  major  challenges  during  a  damaging
earthquake is to quickly determine where the damage
is most severe. An approach now being used is known
as  a  shake  map that  shows  the  extent  of  potential
damaging shaking following an earthquake. Data for
a  shake  map  are  recorded  from  a  dense  network  of
high-quality  seismograph  stations.  When  seismic
data are received at seismographic stations, the areas
with the severest shaking are known within a minute
or so after the shaking has ceased. This information
is  critical  for  directing  an  effective  emergency

Felt by very few people.

Felt by only a few persons at rest, especially on upper ﬂoors of buildings. Delicately suspended objects may swing.

Felt quite noticeably indoors, especially on upper ﬂoors of buildings, but many people do not recognize it as an
earthquake. Standing motor cars may rock slightly. Vibration feels like the passing of a truck.

During the day, felt indoors by many, outdoors by few. At night, some awakened. Dishes, windows, doors disturbed;
walls make cracking sound; sensation like heavy truck striking building; standing motor cars rock noticeably.

Felt by nearly everyone; many awakened. Some dishes, windows, and so on broken; a few instances of cracked
plaster; unstable objects overturned; disturbances of trees, poles, and other tall objects sometimes noticed.
Pendulum clocks may stop.

Felt by all; many frightened and run outdoors. Some heavy furniture moved; a few instances of fallen plaster or
damaged chimneys. Damage is slight.

Everybody runs outdoors. Damage negligible in buildings of good design and construction; slight to moderate in
well-built ordinary structures; considerable in poorly built or badly designed structures; some chimneys broken.
Noticed by persons driving cars.

Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable in ordinary substantial buildings, with partial collapse;
great in poorly built structures; panel walls thrown out of frame structures; fall of chimneys, factory stacks, columns,
monuments, walls; heavy furniture overturned; sand and mud ejected in small amounts; changes in well water;
disturbs persons driving cars.

Damage considerable in specially designed structures; well-designed frame structures thrown out of plumb; great
in substantial buildings, with partial collapse. Buildings are shifted off foundations. Ground cracked conspicuously.
Underground pipes are broken.

Some well-built wooden structures destroyed; most masonry and frame structures with foundations destroyed;
ground badly cracked. Rails bent. Landslides considerable from riverbanks and steep slopes. Shifted sand and
mud. Water is splashed over banks.

Few if any (masonry) structures remain standing. Bridges are destroyed. Broad ﬁssures are formed in ground.
Underground pipelines are taken out of service. Earth slumps and land slips on soft ground occurs. Train rails are bent.

Damage is total. Waves are seen on ground surfaces. Lines of sight and level distorted. Objects are thrown upward
into the air.

earthquake  shaking,  and  the  arrival  of  emergency
personnel is critical in the ﬁrst minutes and hours fol-
lowing an earthquake, if people in collapsed buildings
are to be rescued. The shake map is also very useful in
helping locate areas where gas lines and other utilities
are likely to be damaged. Clearly, the use of this tech-
nology, especially in urban areas vulnerable to earth-
quakes,  is  a  very  desirable  component  of  our  pre-
paredness for earthquakes.

6.4 Plate Boundary Earthquakes
California,  which  straddles  two  lithospheric  plates
that  are  moving  past  one  another,  experiences  fre-
quent damaging earthquakes. The 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake (M 7.1) on the San Andreas fault system
south of San Francisco killed 62 people and caused
$5 billion in property damage. Neither the Loma Pri-
eta  earthquake  nor  the  Northridge  earthquake  (M
6.7) was considered a great earthquake. It has been
estimated  that  a  great  earthquake,  occurring  today

Plate Boundary Earthquakes

177

in  a  densely  populated  part  of  southern  California,
could inﬂict $100 billion in damage and kill several
thousand people. Thus, the Northridge quake, as ter-
rible  as  it  was,  was  not  the  anticipated  “big  one.”
Given  that  earthquakes  have  the  proven  potential
for producing a catastrophe, earthquake research is
primarily  dedicated  to  understanding  earthquake
processes. The more we know about the probable lo-
cation, magnitude, and effects of an earthquake, the
better we can estimate the damage that is likely to
occur and make the necessary plans for minimizing
loss of life and property.

Interplate earthquakes are those between two plates,
initiated near plate boundaries and producing nearly
continuous linear or curvilinear zones in which most
seismic  activity  takes  place  (Figure  6.5).  Most  large
U.S.  earthquakes  are  interplate  earthquakes  in  the
West,  particularly  near  the  North  American  and  Pa-
ciﬁc plate boundaries (Table 6.1). However, large dam-
aging  intraplate  earthquakes,  located  within  a  single
plate, can occur far from plate boundaries.

6.5 Intraplate

Earthquakes

Intraplate earthquakes with M 7.5+ that
occurred in the winter of 1811–1812 in
the  central  Mississippi  Valley  nearly 
destroyed  the  town  of  New  Madrid, 
Missouri,  and  they  killed  an  unknown
number  of  people.  These  earthquakes
rang church bells in Boston! Seismic shak-
ing produced intense surface deformation
over  a  wide  area  from  Memphis,  Ten-
nessee,  north  to  the  conﬂuence  of  the
Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. During the
earthquakes, forests were ﬂattened; frac-
tures in the ground opened so wide that
people  had  to  cut  down  trees  to  cross
them;  and  land  sank  several  meters  in
some  areas,  causing  ﬂooding.  It  was  reported  that
the Mississippi River actually reversed its ﬂow dur-
ing shaking. The earthquakes occurred along a seis-
mically active structure known as the New Madrid
seismic zone, which underlies the geologic structure
known as the Mississippi River Embayment (Figure
6.6).  The  embayment  is  a  downwarped  area  of
Earth’s  crust,  where  the  lithosphere  is  relatively
weak.  The  recurrence  interval,  or  time  between
events, for major earthquakes in the embayment is
estimated  to  be  about  500  years.9,10 Even  in  this
“stable”  interior  of  the  North  American  plate,  the
possibility  of  future  damage  demands  that  the
earthquake hazard in the area be considered when
facilities, such as power plants and dams, are being
designed  and  built.  It  is  believed  that  the  New
Madrid seismic zone is a young—perhaps less than
10,000 years old—zone of deformation. The rate of
uplift  is  sufﬁcient  to  produce  signiﬁcant  topo-
graphic relief over a period of several hundred thou-
sand years. The fact that the topography of the up-
lifted region in the Mississippi River ﬂoodplain area
is very minor supports the hypothesis that this is a
very  young  fault  system  or  one  that  has  been  re-
cently reactivated. The New Madrid seismic zone is
capable  of  producing  great  earthquakes  and  is  the
object of intensive research.

Another  large  damaging  intraplate  earthquake 
(M 7.5) occurred on August 31, 1886, near Charleston,
South Carolina. The earthquake killed about 60 people
and  damaged  or  destroyed  most  buildings  in

at distances exceeding 1,000 km (620 mi).

Intraplate  earthquakes  in  the  eastern  United
States are generally more damaging and felt over a

much larger area than are similar-magnitude earth-
quakes in California. The reason is that the rocks in
the eastern United States are generally stronger and
less  fractured  and  can  more  efﬁciently  transmit
earthquake waves than can rocks in the west.

6.6 Earthquake Processes
Our discussion of global tectonics established that
Earth is a dynamic, evolving system. Earthquakes
are a natural consequence of the processes that form
the ocean basins, continents, and mountain ranges
of  the  world.  Most  earthquakes  occur  along  the
boundaries of lithospheric plates (Figure 6.5).

Faulting
The  process  of  fault  rupture,  or  faulting,  can  be
compared to sliding two rough boards past one an-
other.  Friction  along  the  boundary  between  the
boards, analogous to a fault plane, may temporarily
slow their motion, but rough edges break off, and
motion occurs at various places along the plane. For
example,  lithospheric  plates  that  are  moving  past
one  another  are  slowed  by  friction  along  their
boundaries.  As  a  result,  rocks  along  the  boundary
undergo  strain,  or  deformation,  resulting  from
stress produced by the movement. When stress on
the rocks exceeds their strength, the rocks rupture,
forming  a  fault  and  producing  an  earthquake.  A
fault is  a  fracture  or  fracture  system  along  which
rocks  have  been  displaced;  that  is,  one  side  of  the
fracture  or  fracture  system  has  moved  relative  to
the other side. The long-term rate of movement is
known as the slip rate and is often recorded as mil-
limeters  per  year  (mm/yr)  or  meters  per  1,000
years (m/ky). During a major to great earthquake,
displacements  of  several  meters  may  suddenly
occur along a fault. When a rupture begins, it starts
at  the  focus  and  then  grows  or  propagates  up,
down, and laterally along the fault plane during an
earthquake (see Figure 6.1). The sudden rupture of
the  rocks  produces  shock  waves  called  earthquake
waves,  or  seismic waves,  that  shake  the  ground.  In
other  words,  the  pent-up  energy  of  the  strained
rocks  is  released  in  the  form  of  an  earthquake.
Faults  are,  therefore,  seismic  sources,  and  identify-
ing them is the ﬁrst step in evaluating the risk of an
earthquake, or seismic risk, in a given area.

Fault Types
The major types of faults, based on the direction, or
sense  of  the  relative  displacement,  are  shown  on
Figure 6.7. A strike-slip fault is a fault in which the
sides of the fault are displaced horizontally; a strike-
slip fault is called right-lateral if the right-hand side
moves  toward  you  as  you  sight,  or  look  along,  the
fault line, and left-lateral if the left-hand side moves
toward you. A fault with vertical displacement is re-
ferred to as a dip-slip fault. A dip-slip fault may be a
reverse  fault or  a  normal  fault,  depending  on  the
geometry of the displacement. Geologists use inter-
esting  terminology  to  distinguish  reverse  and  nor-
mal  faults.  Notice  in  Figure  6.7 that  there  are  two
blocks separated by the fault plane. One way to re-
member  the  terminology  for  the  two  blocks  is  to
imagine  you  are  walking  up  the  fault  plane,  like
walking up a hill. The block you would be standing
on  is  called  the  foot-wall,  and  the  other  block  is
called the hanging-wall. If the fault displacement is
such that the hanging-wall moves up relative to the
foot-wall, the fault is called a reverse fault. When the
fault  plane  of  a  reverse  fault  has  an  angle  of  less
than  45  degrees,  it  is  called  a  thrust  fault.  If  the
hanging-wall moves down relative to the foot-wall,
the fault is called a normal fault. Reverse and thrust
fault displacement are associated with crustal short-
ening, whereas normal fault displacement is associ-
ated with crustal extension.

The faults shown in Figure 6.7 generally produce
surface  displacement  or  rupture.  However,  there
are also buried faults, usually associated with folded
rocks.  Displacement  and  rupture  of  buried  faults
do  not  propagate  to  the  surface,  even  in  large
earthquakes, as was the case with the Northridge
earthquake.

The  relationship  of  a  buried  reverse  fault  to
rock  folding  is  shown  in  Figure  6.8  (page  181).
Shortening  of  a  sequence  of  sedimentary  rocks
has produced folds, called anticlines and synclines.
Anticlines are  arch-shaped  folds;  synclines are
bowl-shaped  folds.  In  this  illustration,  anticlines
form  ridges,  and  synclines  form  basins  at  the  sur-
face of the ground. Notice that, in the cores of two
of the anticlines on the right, buried faulting has oc-
curred.  Faulting  during  earthquakes  causes  anticli-
nal  mountains  to  be  uplifted,  whereas  subsidence,
or sinking of the ground surface, may occur in syn-
clinal valleys.

Buried faults

Until  recently,  it  was  thought  that  most  active
faults  could  be  mapped  because  their  most  recent
earthquake would cause surface rupture. Discovering
that  some  faults  are  buried  and  that  rupture  does
not always reach the surface has made it more difﬁ-
cult  to  evaluate  the  earthquake  hazard  in  some
areas. (See Case History: Northridge, 1994.)

both  historic  seismic  activity  and  paleoseismicity
(prehistoric seismic activity). Paleoseismology is the
study of prehistoric earthquakes from the geologic
environment.  The  geologic  processes  that  govern
fault segmentation and generation of earthquakes
on  individual  segments  are  the  subject  of  active
research.

Fault Zones and Fault Segments
Faults  almost  never  occur  as  a  single  rupture.
Rather, they form fault zones, which are a group of
related faults roughly parallel to each other in map
view.  They  often  partially  overlap  or  form  braided
patterns. Fault zones vary in width, ranging from a
meter or so to several kilometers.

Most  long  faults  or  fault  zones,  such  as  the  San
Andreas  fault  zone,  are  segmented,  with  each  seg-
ment having an individual history and style of move-
ment.  An  earthquake  segment is  deﬁned  as  those
parts of a fault zone that have ruptured as a unit dur-
ing  historic  and  prehistoric  earthquakes.  Rupture
during an earthquake generally stops at the bound-
aries between two segments; however, major to great
earthquakes  may  involve  several  segments  of  the
fault. Rupture length from large earthquakes is mea-
sured in tens of kilometers. It is the earthquake segment
that is often useful in estimating the magnitude of a
future earthquake.

When  the  earthquake  history  of  a  fault  zone  is
unknown, the zone may be divided into segments,
based  on  differences  in  morphology  or  geometry.
However,  from  the  point  of  view  of  earthquake-
hazard  evaluation,  it  is  preferable  to  deﬁne  fault
segments according to their history, which includes

Active Faults
Most geologists consider a particular fault to be an
active fault if it can be demonstrated to have moved
during the past 10,000 years, the Holocene epoch.
The  Quaternary  period,  spanning  approximately
the past 2.6 million years, is the most recent period
of  geologic  time,  and  most  of  our  landscape  has
been  produced  during  that  time  (see  Table  1.1).
Fault  displacement  that  has  occurred  during  the
Pleistocene  epoch  of  the  Quaternary  period,  ap-
proximately  2.6  million  to  10,000  years  ago,  but
not in the Holocene, is classiﬁed as potentially active
(Table 6.5).

Faults  that  have  not  moved  during  the  past  2.6
million  years  are  generally  classiﬁed  as  inactive.
However, we emphasize that it is often difﬁcult to
prove the activity of a fault in the absence of easily
measured  phenomena,  such  as  historical  earth-
quakes.  Demonstrating  that  a  fault  is  active  may
require determining the past earthquake history, or
paleoseismicity,  on  the  basis  of  the  geologic  record.
This  determination  involves  identifying  faulted
Earth  materials  and  determining  when  the  most
recent displacement occurred.

For  seismic  zoning,  the  state  of  California  de-
ﬁnes an active fault as a fault that has moved in the

last  10,000  years.  However,  other  agencies  have
more conservative deﬁnitions for fault activity. For
example, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
when considering seismic safety for nuclear power
plants, deﬁnes a fault as capable if it has moved at
least  once  in  the  past  50,000  years  or  more  than
once in the last 500,000 years. These criteria pro-
vide  a  greater  safety  factor,  reﬂecting  increased
concern about the risk inherent in the siting of nu-
clear power plants.

Fault activity involves two important and interre-
lated  concepts:  slip-rates  on  faults  and  recurrence
intervals (repeat times) of earthquakes. Slip rate on
a fault is deﬁned as the ratio of slip (displacement)
to  the  time  interval  over  which  that  slip  occurred.
For example, if a fault has displacement of 1 m dur-
ing  a  time  interval  of  1,000  years,  the  slip  rate  is 
1 mm per year.

The average recurrence interval of earthquakes
on  a  particular  fault  may  be  determined  by  three
methods:

1. Paleoseismic  data: This  method  involves  aver-
aging the time intervals between earthquakes
recorded in the geologic record.

2. Slip  rate: This  method  involves  assuming  a
given  displacement  per  event  and  dividing
that  number  by  the  slip  rate.  For  example, 
if  the  average  displacement  per  event  were 
1  m  and  the  slip  rate  2  mm  per  year,  then 
the  average  recurrence  interval  would  be 
500 years.

3. Seismicity: This method involves using histori-
cal earthquakes and averaging the time inter-
vals between events.

Deﬁning slip rate and recurrence interval is easy,
and  the  calculations  seem  straightforward.  How-
ever, the concepts of slip rate and recurrence interval
are far from simple. Fault slip rates and recurrence
intervals  tend  to  change  over  time,  casting  suspi-
cion on average rates. For example, it is not uncom-
mon  for  earthquake  events  to  cluster  in  time  and
then  be  separated  by  long  periods  of  low  activity.
Thus,  both  slip  rate  and  recurrence  interval  will
vary according to the time interval for which data
is available.

Methods of Estimating Fault Activity. Various
methods  are  used  to  estimate  fault  activity,  which
includes both historic and prehistoric earthquakes.
Paleoseismicity  can  be  estimated  by  investigating
landforms  produced  or  displaced  by  faulting.  Fea-
tures  such  as  offset  streams,  sag  ponds,  linear
ridges,  and  fault  scarps  (i.e.,  steep  slopes  or  cliffs
produced  by  fault  movement)  may  indicate  recent
faulting. However, care must be exercised in inter-
preting these landforms because some of them may
have a complex origin.

The study of soils can also be useful in estimating
the activity of a fault. For example, soils on opposite
sides of a fault may be of similar age or quite dissim-
ilar age, thus establishing a relative age for the dis-
placement.

Case History
Northridge, 1994

Earthquake Processes

183

The 1994 Northridge earthquake
that struck the Los Angeles area on
January 17 was a painful wake-up call
to southern Californians. The earth-
quake killed 57 people and caused
about $40 billion in property dam-
age. Several sections of freeways were
heavily damaged, as were parking
structures and more than 3,000
buildings (Figure 6.A). The North-
ridge earthquake is one in a series of
moderate-sized earthquakes that
have recently occurred in southern
California.

The rupture of rocks that pro-
duced the Northridge earthquake
was initiated on a steep buried fault,
at a depth of approximately 18 km
(11 mi). The rupture quickly propa-
gated upward (northward and west-
ward) but did not reach the surface,
stopping at a depth of several kilo-
meters. At the same time, the rup-
ture progressed laterally, in a mostly
westward direction, 20 km (12.5
mi). The geometry of the fault
movement is shown in Figure 6.B.
The movement produced uplift and

folding of part of the Santa Susana
Mountains, a few kilometers north
of Northridge.11

The Northridge earthquake terriﬁed

people, especially children. The shak-
ing, which lasted about 15 seconds,
was intense; people were thrown out
of bed, objects ﬂew across rooms,
chimneys tumbled, walls cracked, and
Earth groaned and roared with each
passing earthquake wave. When the
shaking stopped, people had little
time to recover before strong after-
shocks started.

CHAPTER 6

Earthquakes

Prehistoric earthquake activity sometimes can be
dated radiometrically, providing a numerical date if
suitable materials can be found. For example, radio-
carbon dates from faulted sediments have been used
to calculate slip rates and estimate recurrence inter-
vals of large earthquakes.

Tectonic Creep
Some  active  faults  exhibit  tectonic  creep,  that  is,
gradual  displacement  that  is  not  accompanied  by
felt  earthquakes.  The  process  can  slowly  damage
roads,  sidewalks,  building  foundations,  and  other
structures.  Tectonic  creep  has  damaged  culverts
under the football stadium of the University of Cali-
fornia  at  Berkeley,  and  periodic  repairs  have  been
necessary as the cracks have developed. Movement
of approximately 3.2 cm (1.3 in.) was measured in a
period  of  11  years.  More  rapid  rates  of  tectonic
creep  have  been  recorded  on  the  Calaveras  fault
zone, a segment of the San Andreas fault, near Hol-
lister, California. At one location, a winery situated
on the fault is slowly being pulled apart at about
1 cm (0.4 in.) per year (Figure 6.9). Damages result-
ing  from  tectonic  creep  generally  occur  along  nar-
row fault zones that are subject to slow, continuous
displacement.

Slow Earthquakes
Slow  earthquakes are  similar  to  other  earth-
quakes, in that they are produced by fault rupture.
However,  with  a  slow  earthquake,  the  rupture,
rather  than  being  nearly  instantaneous,  can  last
from days to months. The moment magnitude of
slow earthquakes can be in the range of 6 to 7 be-
cause a large area of rupture is often involved, al-
though the amount of slip is generally small (e.g.,
a centimeter or so). Slow earthquakes are a newly
recognized  fundamental  Earth  process.  They  are
recognized  through  analysis  of  continuous  geo-
detic measurement or GPS, similar to the devices
that are used in automobiles to identify location.
These  instruments  can  differentiate  horizontal
movement in the millimeter range and have been
used  to  observe  surface  displacements  from 
slow  earthquakes.  When  slow  earthquakes  occur
frequently, such as every year, their total contribu-
tion  to  changing  the  surface  of  the  Earth  to

produce  mountains  over  geologic  time  may  be
significant.12

6.7 Earthquake Shaking
Three important factors determine the shaking you
will experience during an earthquake: (1) earthquake
magnitude, (2) your distance from the epicenter, and
(3) local soil and rock conditions. If an earthquake is
of moderate magnitude (M 5 to 5.9) or larger, then
strong motion or shaking may be expected. It is the
strong  motion  from  earthquakes  that  cracks  the
ground  and  makes  Earth  “rock  and  roll,”  causing
damage to buildings and other structures.

Types of Seismic Waves
Some of the seismic waves generated by fault rup-
ture travel within Earth, and others travel along the
surface. The two types of seismic waves that travel
with  a  velocity  of  several  kilometers  per  second
through  rocks  are  primary  (P)  and  secondary  (S)
waves (see Figure 6.10a,b, page 186).

P waves, also called compressional waves, are faster
than  S  waves  and  can  travel  through  solid,  liquid,
and gaseous materials (see Figure 6.10a). The veloc-
ity of P waves through liquids is much slower. Inter-
estingly,  when  P  waves  are  propagated  into  the
atmosphere, they are detectable to the human ear.
This fact explains the observation that people some-
times hear an earthquake before they feel the shak-
ing  caused  by  the  arrival  of  the  slower  surface
waves.13

S waves, also called shear waves, can travel only
through  solid  materials.  Their  speed  through
rocks,  such  as  granite,  is  approximately  one-half
that of P waves. S waves produce an up-and-down
or side-to-side motion at right angles to the direc-
tion  of  wave  propagation,  similar  to  the  motion
produced  in  a  clothesline  by  pulling  it  down  and
letting go (see Figure 6.10b). Because liquids can-
not spring back when subjected to this type of mo-
tion,  called  sideways  shear,  S  waves  cannot  move
through liquids.13

When  seismic  waves  reach  the  surface,  complex
surface waves (R waves) are produced. Surface waves,
which move along Earth’s surface, travel more slowly
than  either  P  or  S  waves  and  cause  much  of  the

earthquake damage to buildings and other structures.
Damage  occurs  because  surface  waves  have  a  com-
plex  horizontal  and  vertical  ground  movement  or
rolling motion that may crack walls and foundations
of buildings, bridges, and roads. An important surface

wave  is  the  R  wave,  shown  in  Figure  6.10c.  The
rolling  motion  moves  in  the  direction  opposite  to
that of the wave propagation (direction wave is mov-
ing) and the vertical motion, or amplitude, is at right
angles to the direction of propagation.

izontally on a ﬂat surface and then push from the left end, the zone of compression (i.e., contraction) will propagate to the right, as
shown. The rate of propagation of P waves through rocks such as granite is about 6 km/sec (3.7 mi/sec). Through liquids, P waves move
much slower, about 1.5 km/sec (0.9 mi/sec) through water. (b) To visualize S waves, stretch a rope about 7 m (about 23 ft) between two
chairs, or use a clothesline if you have one. Pull up the left end and then release it; the wave will propagate to the right, in this case, up
and down. Displacement for S waves is at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, just the opposite of P wave displacements
that push and pull in the same direction as the wave propagates. Points A, B, and C are the positions of a speciﬁc part of the wave at dif-
ferent times. S waves travel through rocks, such as granite, approximately 3 km/sec (1.9 mi/sec). They cannot travel through liquids. 
(c) Surface, or R, waves. Notice that the vertical motion is at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, and that the elliptical 
motion is opposite to the direction of propagation. Surface waves are often the most damaging of the seismic waves.

Seismograph
A  seismogram is  a  written  or  digital  record  of  an
earthquake. In written form, it is a continuous line
that shows vertical or horizontal Earth motions re-
ceived at a seismic recording station and recorded by

a seismograph. The components of a simple seismo-
graph are shown in Figure 6.11a, and a photograph
of  an  older  seismograph  is  shown  in  Figure  6.11b.
An  idealized  written  record,  or  seismogram,  is

the  P  waves  arrive  50  seconds  before  the  S  waves
and about 1 minute 40 seconds before the R waves.
R waves have the largest amplitude and often cause
the most damage to buildings.

The  effect  of  distance  on  the  seismogram  is
shown  in  Figure  6.11d for  the  1994  M  6.7  North-
ridge,  California,  earthquake.  Three  seismographs,
from  close  to  the  epicenter  at  Pasadena  (38  km
[24 mi]) to far away at Needles (356 km [221 mi]),
are shown. The shaking starts with the arrival of the
P wave. Notice that the shaking arrives sooner and
is more intense at Pasadena than at Needles.

The  difference  in  the  arrival  times  shown  by
seismograms (S – P) can be used to locate the epi-
center  of  an  earthquake.  Locating  an  epicenter
requires at least three seismograms from three lo-
cations. For example, the S – P value of 50 seconds
on Figure 6.11c suggests that the distance between
the  epicenter  and  the  seismograph  was  about
420  km  (261  mi).  This  is  calculated  algebraically,
using the S – P value and the velocity for P and
S  waves  mentioned  earlier;  however,  this  calcula-
tion  is  beyond  the  scope  of  our  discussion.  Al-
though we now know that the epicenter was about
420  km  (261  mi)  from  the  seismograph,  this  dis-
tance could be in any direction. When the records
from  seismographs  from  numerous  seismic  sta-
tions are analyzed using computer models, the epi-
center for an earthquake can be located. The model
is  used  to  calculate  the  travel  times  of  seismic
waves to each seismograph from various depths of
focus  (Figure  6.12).  Distances  and  depths  to  the
focus  are  adjusted  to  provide  the  best  ﬁt  of  the
data  from  all  the  seismographs.  By  a  process  of

approximation,  the  location  of  the  epicenter  and
depth to the focus are determined.

Frequency of Seismic Waves
An  important  characteristic  of  earthquakes  and
their seismic waves is their frequency, measured in
cycles  per  second,  or  hertz  (Hz).  To  understand
wave  frequency,  visualize  water  waves  traveling
across the surface of the ocean, analogous to seismic
waves. If you are at the end of a pier and record the
time  when  each  wave  peak  moves  by  you  toward
shore, the average time period between wave peaks
is  the  wave  period and  is  usually  measured  in  sec-
onds. Consider the passing of each wave by you to be
one cycle. If one wave passes the end of the pier on
its way toward the shore every 10 seconds, the wave
period  is  10  seconds,  and  there  are  6  waves  per
minute.  The  frequency  of  the  waves  in  cycles  per
second is 1 cycle divided by 10 seconds, or 0.1 Hz.
Returning to earthquake waves, most P and S waves
have frequencies of 0.5 to 20 Hz, or 0.5 to 20 cycles
per  second.  Surface  waves  have  lower  frequencies
than P and S waves, often less than 1 Hz.

Why is the wave frequency important? During an
earthquake, seismic waves with a wide range of fre-
quencies are produced, and intense ground motion
near the epicenter of a large earthquake is observed.
High-frequency  shaking  causes  low  buildings  to
vibrate, and low-frequency shaking causes tall build-
ings  to  vibrate.  It  is  the  vibrating  or  shaking  that
damages  buildings.  Two  points  are  important  in
understanding  the  shaking  hazard:  (1)  Near  the
epicenter, both shorter buildings and taller buildings

may be damaged by high- and low-frequency seismic
waves. (2) With increasing distance from the epicen-
ter,  the  high-frequency  waves  are  weakened  or  re-
moved by a process called attenuation. Rapid shak-
ing dies off quickly with distance. As a result, nearby
earthquakes are often described as “jolting” and far-
away earthquakes as “rolling.” Low-frequency seismic
waves  of  about  0.5  to  1.0  Hz  can  travel  long  dis-
tances  without  much  attenuation.  Therefore,  they
can  damage  tall  buildings  far  from  the  epicenter.
This  fact  has  importance  in  planning  to  reduce
earthquake damages and loss of life. Tall buildings
need  to  be  designed  to  withstand  seismic  shaking,
even if they are located hundreds of kilometers from
large faults that are capable of producing strong to
great earthquakes.

Material Ampliﬁcation
Different Earth materials, such as bedrock, alluvium
(sand and gravel), and silt and mud, respond differ-
ently to seismic shaking. For example, the intensity
of  shaking  or  strong  ground  motion  of  unconsoli-
dated  sediments  may  be  much  more  severe  than
that of bedrock. Figure 6.13 shows how the amplitude
of  shaking,  or  the  vertical  movement,  is  greatly
increased  in  unconsolidated  sediments,  such  as
silt and clay deposits. This effect is called material
ampliﬁcation.

The  Mexico  City  earthquake  (M  8.1)  demon-
strated  that  buildings  constructed  on  materials
likely  to  accentuate  and  increase  seismic  shaking
are extremely vulnerable to earthquakes, even if the
event is centered several hundred kilometers away.

Although  seismic  waves  originating  offshore  ini-
tially contained many frequencies, those arriving at
the city were low-frequency waves of about 0.5 to
1.0  Hz.  It  is  speculated  that,  when  seismic  waves
struck the lake beds beneath Mexico City, the am-
plitude  of  shaking  may  have  increased  at  the  sur-
face  by  a  factor  of  4  or  5. Figure  6.14 shows  the
geology  of  the  city  and  the  location  of  the  worst
damage. The intense regular shaking caused build-
ings to sway back and forth, and, eventually, many
of  them  pancaked  as  upper  stories  collapsed  onto
lower ones.14

The potential for ampliﬁcation of surface waves to
cause  damage  was  again  demonstrated  with  tragic
results  during  the  1989  Loma  Prieta  earthquake 
(M  7.1),  which  originated  south  of  San  Francisco.
Figure 6.15 (page 191) shows the epicenter and the
areas that greatly magniﬁed shaking. The collapse of
a tiered freeway, which killed 41 people, occurred on
a section of roadway constructed on bay ﬁll and mud
(Figure  6.16,  page  192).  Less  shaking  occurred
where  the  freeway  was  constructed  on  older,
stronger alluvium; in these areas, the structure sur-
vived.  Extensive  damage  was  also  recorded  in  the
Marina district of San Francisco (Figure 6.17, page
192). This area was primarily constructed on bay ﬁll
and mud, as well as debris dumped into the bay dur-
ing the cleanup following the 1906 earthquake.15

to  the  west,  resulting  in  stronger  ground  motions

from seismic shaking to the northwest (Figure 6.18,

Ground Acceleration During
Earthquakes
Strong  ground  motion  from  earthquakes  may  be
described in terms of the speed or velocity at which
primary,  secondary,  and  surface  waves  travel
through  rocks  or  across  the  surface  of  Earth.  In
general, these waves move a few kilometers per sec-

Earthquake Shaking

191

ond. This velocity is analogous to the units used to
describe the speed at which you drive a car, for ex-
ample, 100 km (62 mi) per hour. Earthquake waves,
however, travel much faster than cars, at a velocity
of about 20,000 km (12,428 mi) per hour, similar to
that of the U.S. Space Shuttle when it orbits Earth.
Damage to structures from strong ground motion is
related  to  both  the  amplitude  of  seismic  surface
waves and the rate of velocity change of the seismic
waves with time. The rate of change of velocity with
time  is  referred  to  as  acceleration.  You  may  have
learned in physical science that the acceleration due
to gravity on Earth is 9.8 meters per second per sec-
ond (written as 9.8 m/sec2, or 32 ft/sec2). This ac-
celeration is known as 1 g. If you parachute from an
airplane and free fall for several seconds, you will
experience the acceleration of gravity (1 g), and, by
the end of the ﬁrst second of free fall, your velocity
will be 9.8 m/sec. At the end of 2 seconds of free fall,
your velocity will be about 20 m/sec, and it will be
about 30 m/sec at the end of 3 seconds. This increase,
or rate of change, in velocity with time is the accelera-
tion. Earthquake waves cause the ground to acceler-
ate both vertically and horizontally, just as your car
accelerates  horizontally  when  you  step  on  the  gas
pedal.  Specially  designed  instruments,  called  ac-
celerometers, measure and record the acceleration of
the ground during earthquakes. The units of acceler-
ation in earthquake studies are in terms of the accel-
eration  of  gravity.  If  the  ground  accelerates  at 
1  g,  the  value  is  9.8  m/sec2.  If  the  acceleration  of 
the ground is 0.5 g, the value is roughly 5 m/sec2.
One reason we are interested in acceleration of the
ground  from  earthquakes  is  that,  when  engineers
design buildings to withstand seismic shaking, the
building  design  criteria  are  often  expressed  in
terms  of  a  maximum  acceleration  of  the  ground,
since it is the horizontal acceleration of the ground
that causes most damage to buildings. For example,
earthquakes with M 6.0 to 6.9, typical magnitudes
for strong southern California earthquakes, will pro-
duce horizontal accelerations of about 0.3 to 0.7 g,
with  localized  values  near  the  epicenter  exceeding
1.0  g. Horizontal  accelerations  in  excess  of  about
0.3 g cause damage to some buildings, and, at 0.7 g,
damage is widespread, unless buildings are designed
and  constructed  to  withstand  strong  ground
motion. Therefore, if we wish to design buildings to
withstand  M  6  to  6.9  earthquakes,  we  need  to
conservatively  design  them  to  withstand  ground

perspective,  consider  that  homes  constructed  of
adobe, which are common in rural Mexico, South
America, and the Middle East, can collapse under
a horizontal acceleration of 0.1 g.13 Unreinforced,

vulnerable, at 0.2 to 0.3 g, as was tragically illus-
trated  in  the  1995  Sakhalin,  Russia,  earthquake
(M 7.5). Two thousand of the 3,000 people in the

cated  apartment  buildings  collapsed  into  rubble

Supershear
Supershear occurs when the propagation of rupture is
faster  than  the  velocity  of  shear  waves  or  surface
waves produced by the rupture. The effect is analo-
gous to supersonic aircraft breaking the sound bar-
rier, producing a sonic boom. Supershear can produce
shock  waves  that  produce  strong  ground  motion
along the fault. The increased shear and shock may
signiﬁcantly increase the damage from a large earth-
quake.  Supershear  has  been  observed  or  suspected
during several past earthquakes, including the 1906
San  Francisco  earthquake  and  the  2002  Denali
earthquake in Alaska. Apparently, supershear is most
likely to occur with strike-slip earthquakes that rup-
ture a long straight fault segment of several tens to a
hundred or more kilometers in length.

Depth of Focus
Recall that the point or area within Earth where an
earthquake  rupture  starts  is  called  the  focus (see
Figure  6.1).  The  depth  of  focus of  an  earthquake
varies  from  just  a  few  kilometers  deep  to  almost
700  km  (435  mi)  below  the  surface.  The  deepest

earthquakes  occur  along  subduction  zones,  where
slabs  of  oceanic  lithosphere  sink  to  great  depths.
The 2001 Seattle, Washington, earthquake (M 6.8)
is  an  example  of  a  relatively  deep  earthquake.  Al-
though  the  Seattle  event  was  a  large  quake,  about
the  same  size  as  the  1994  Northridge  earthquake,
the  focus  was  deeper,  at  about  52  km  (32  mi)
beneath  Earth’s  surface.  The  focus  was  within  the
subducting Juan de Fuca plate (see Figures 2.6 and
2.10). Seismic waves had to move up 52 km (32 mi)
before reaching the surface, and they lost much of
their energy in the journey. As a result, the earthquake
caused relatively little damage, considering its mag-
nitude.  In  contrast,  most  earthquakes  in  southern
California have focal depths of about 10 to 15 km
(6  to  9  mi),  although  deeper  earthquakes  have  oc-
curred.  These  relatively  shallow  earthquakes  are
more destructive than deeper earthquakes of compa-
rable  magnitude  because  they  are  deep  enough  to
generate  strong  seismic  shaking,  yet  sufﬁciently
close to the surface to cause strong surface shaking.
A M 7.5 earthquake on strike-slip faults in the Mo-
jave Desert near Landers, California, in 1992 had a
focal  depth  of  less  than  10  km  (6  mi).  This  event

caused  extensive  ground  rupture  for  about  85  km
(53 mi).16 Local vertical displacement exceeded 2 m
(6.5 ft), and extensive lateral displacements of about
5 m (16 ft) were measured (Figure 6.20). If the Lan-
ders event had occurred in the Los Angeles Basin, ex-
tensive damage and loss of life would have occurred.

6.8 Earthquake Cycle
Observations of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake
(M 7.7) led to a hypothesis known as the earthquake
cycle.  The  earthquake  cycle  hypothesis  proposes
that there is a drop in elastic strain after an earth-
quake and there is a reaccumulation of strain before
the next event.

Strain is  deformation  resulting  from  stress.
Elastic strain may be thought of as deformation that
is  not  permanent,  provided  that  the  stress  is  re-
leased.  When  the  stress  is  released,  the  deformed
material returns to its original shape. If the stress
continues to increase, the deformed material even-
tually  ruptures,  making  the  deformation  perma-
nent.  For  example,  consider  a  stretched  rubber
band  or  a  bent  archery  bow;  continued  stress  will
snap  the  rubber  band  or  break  the  bow.  When  a
stretched rubber band or bow breaks, it experiences
a  rebound,  in  which  the  broken  ends  snap  back,

releasing their pent-up energy. A similar effect, re-
ferred  to  as  elastic  rebound,  occurs  after  an  earth-
quake (Figure 6.21). At time 1, rocks on either side
of a fault segment have no strain built up and show
no deformation. At time 2, elastic strain begins to
build,  caused  by  the  tectonic  forces  that  pull  the
rocks  in  opposite  directions,  referred  to  as  shear
stress.  The  rocks  begin  to  bend.  At  time  3,  elastic
strain  is  accumulating,  and  the  rocks  have  bent;
however,  they  are  still  held  together  by  friction.
When the deformed rocks ﬁnally rupture, at time 4,
the  stress  is  released,  and  the  elastic  strain  sud-
denly decreases as the sides of the fault “snap” into
their  new,  or  permanently  deformed,  position.
After  the  earthquake,  it  takes  time  for  sufﬁcient
elastic  strain  to  accumulate  again  in  order  to  pro-
duce another rupture.17

Stages of the Earthquake Cycle
It is speculated that a typical earthquake cycle has
three  or  four  stages.  The  ﬁrst  is  a  long  period  of
seismic inactivity following a major earthquake and
associated  aftershocks,  earthquakes  that  occur  any-
where from a few minutes to a year or so after the
main event. This is followed by a second stage, char-
acterized  by  increased  seismicity,  as  accumulated
elastic  strain  approaches  and  locally  exceeds  the

The third stage of the cycle, which may occur only
hours or days before the next large earthquake, con-
sists of foreshocks. Foreshocks are small to moderate
earthquakes that occur before the main event. For
example, a M 6 earthquake may have foreshocks of

about M 4. In some cases, this third stage may not
occur. After the major earthquake, considered to be
the  fourth  stage,  the  cycle  starts  over  again.17 Al-
though  the  cycle  is  hypothetical  and  periods  be-
tween  major  earthquakes  are  variable,  the  stages
have been identiﬁed in the occurrence and reoccur-
rence of large earthquakes.

The Dilatancy-Diffusion Model
Although  we  have  many  empirical  observations
concerning  physical  changes  in  Earth  materials
before,  during,  and  after  earthquakes,  no  general
agreement  exists  in  terms  of  a  physical  model  to
explain the observations. One model, known as the
dilatancy-diffusion  model,13,18 assumes  that  the
ﬁrst  stage  in  earthquake  development  is  an  in-
crease of elastic strain in rocks that causes them to
dilate (undergo  an  inelastic  increase  in  volume)
after  the  stress  on  the  rock  reaches  one-half  the
rock’s  breaking  strength.  During  dilation,  open
fractures develop in the rocks, and it is at this stage
that the ﬁrst physical changes that might indicate
a future earthquake take place.

Brieﬂy, the model assumes that the dilatancy and
fracturing of the rocks are ﬁrst associated with a rela-
tively low water pressure in the dilated rocks, which
helps  to  produce  lower  seismic  velocity  (velocity  of
seismic waves through the rocks near a fault), more
Earth movement, and fewer minor seismic events. An
inﬂux of water then enters the open fractures, caus-
ing the pore pressure to increase, which increases the
seismic  velocity  and  weakens  the  rocks.  Radon  gas
dissolved in the water may also increase. The weaken-
ing facilitates movement along the fractures, which is
recorded as an earthquake. After the movement and
release of stress, the rocks resume many of their orig-
inal characteristics.18

Considerable  controversy  surrounds  the  validity
of the dilatancy-diffusion model. One aspect of the
model gaining considerable favor is the role of ﬂuid
pressure (force  per  unit  area  exerted  by  a  ﬂuid)  in
earthquakes. As we learn more about rocks at seis-
mogenic (earthquake generating) depths, it is appar-
ent that much water is present. Deformation of the
rocks and a variety of other processes are thought to
increase the ﬂuid pressure at depth, and this results
in a lowering of the strength of the rocks. If the ﬂuid
pressure becomes sufﬁciently high, this can facilitate
the occurrence of earthquakes. Empirical data from
several  environments,  including  subduction  zones
and active fold belts, suggest that high ﬂuid pressures
are present in many areas where earthquakes occur.
Thus, there is increasing interest in the role of ﬂuid
ﬂow in fault displacement and the earthquake cycle.
The  fault-valve  mechanism19 hypothesizes  that
ﬂuid  (usually  water)  pressure  rises  until  failure  oc-
curs, thus triggering an earthquake, along with up-

ward ﬂuid discharge. This may explain why, follow-
ing some earthquakes, springs discharge more water
and dry streams may start ﬂowing (i.e., groundwater
seeps into channels). Increased ﬂow (i.e., discharge)
of  groundwater  may  occur  for  months  following  a
large earthquake.

6.9 Earthquakes Caused 

by Human Activity

Several  human  activities  are  known  to  increase  or
cause  earthquake  activity.  Damage  from  human-
caused  earthquakes  is  regrettable,  but  the  lessons
learned  may  help  to  control  or  stop  large  cata-
strophic earthquakes in the future. Three ways that
the actions of people have caused earthquakes are:
• Loading the Earth’s crust, as in building a dam

and reservoir

• Disposing  of  waste  deep  into  the  ground

through disposal wells

• Setting off underground nuclear explosions

Reservoir-Induced Seismicity
During  the  10  years  following  the  completion  of
Hoover Dam on the Colorado River in Arizona and
Nevada,  several  hundred  local  tremors  occurred.
Most of them were very small, but one was M 5 and
two were about M 4.17 An earthquake in India, ap-
proximately M 6, killed about 200 people after the
construction  and  ﬁlling  of  a  reservoir.  Evidently,
fracture zones may be activated both by the increased
load of water on the land and by the increased water
pressure in the rocks below the reservoir, resulting
in faulting.

Deep Waste Disposal
From  April  1962  to  November  1965,  several  hun-
dred earthquakes occurred in the Denver, Colorado,
area. The largest earthquake was M 4.3 and caused
sufﬁcient  shaking  to  knock  bottles  off  shelves  in
stores. The source of the earthquakes was eventually
traced  to  the  Rocky  Mountain  Arsenal,  which  was
manufacturing materials for chemical warfare. Liq-
uid  waste  from  the  manufacturing  process  was
being pumped down a deep disposal well to a depth
of about 3,600 m (11,800 ft). The rock receiving the

198

Earthquakes

waste was highly fractured metamorphic rock, and
injection of the new liquid facilitated slippage along
fractures. Study of the earthquake activity revealed
a high correlation between the rate of waste injec-
tion and the occurrence of earthquakes. When the
injection of waste stopped, so did the earthquakes
(Figure  6.22).20 Fluid  injection  of  waste  as  an
earthquake  trigger  was  an  important  occurrence
because it directed attention to the fact that earth-
quakes and ﬂuid pressure are related.

Nuclear Explosions
Numerous  earthquakes  with  magnitudes  as  large
as 5.0 to 6.3 have been triggered by underground

nuclear explosions at the Nevada Test Site. Analy-
sis of the aftershocks suggests that the explosions
caused some release of natural tectonic strain. This
led to discussions by scientists about whether nu-
clear  explosions  might  be  used  to  prevent  large
earthquakes by releasing strain before it reaches a
critical point.

6.10 Effects of Earthquakes
Shaking is not the only cause of death and damage in
earthquakes:  Catastrophic  earthquakes  have  a  wide
variety  of  destructive  effects.  Primary  effects—
those  caused  directly  by  fault  movement—include

ground shaking and its effects on people and struc-
tures and surface rupture. Secondary effects induced
by  the  faulting  and  shaking  include  liquefaction  of
the  ground,  landslides,  ﬁres,  disease,  tsunami,  and
regional changes in ground and surface water, as well
as land elevation.

Shaking and Ground Rupture
The immediate effects of a catastrophic earthquake
can include violent ground shaking, accompanied by
widespread surface rupture and displacements. Sur-
face rupture with a vertical component produces a
fault scarp. A fault scarp is a linear, steep slope that
looks something like a curb on a street. Fault scarps
are  often  approximately  1  m  (3.3  ft)  or  more  high
and extend for a variable distance, from a few tens
of meters to a few kilometers along a fault (Figure
6.23). The 1906 San Francisco earthquake (M 7.7)
produced 6.5 m (21.3 ft) of horizontal displacement,
or  fault-slip,  along  the  San  Andreas  fault  north  of
San  Francisco  and  reached  a  maximum  Modiﬁed
Mercalli Intensity of XI.13 At this intensity, surface
accelerations  can  snap  and  uproot  large  trees  and
knock  people  to  the  ground.  The  shaking  may
damage  or  collapse  large  buildings,  bridges,  dams,
tunnels,  pipelines,  and  other  rigid  structures.
The great 1964 Alaskan earthquake (M 8.3) caused
extensive  damage  to  transportation  systems,  rail-
roads, airports, and buildings. The 1989 Loma Pri-
eta earthquake (M 7.1) was much smaller than the
Alaska event, yet it caused about $5 billion of dam-

age.  The  1994  Northridge  earthquake  (M  6.7)
caused 57 deaths and inﬂicted about $40 billion in
damage, making it one of the most expensive haz-
ardous events ever in the United States. The North-
ridge earthquake caused so much damage because there
was  so  much  there  to  be  damaged.  The  Los  Angeles
region  is  highly  urbanized,  with  a  high  population
density, and the seismic shaking was intense.

Liquefaction
Liquefaction is the transformation of water-saturated
granular material, or sediments, from a solid to a liq-
uid state. During earthquakes, liquefaction may result
from  compaction  of  sediments  during  intense  shak-
ing. Liquefaction of near-surface water-saturated silts
and sand causes the materials to lose their strength
and to ﬂow. As a result, buildings may tilt or sink into
the  liqueﬁed  sediments,  while  tanks  or  pipelines
buried in the ground may rise buoyantly.21

Landslides
Earthquake shaking often triggers landslides, a com-
prehensive term for several types of hill slope failure,
in  hilly  and  mountainous  areas.  Landslides  can  be
extremely destructive and can cause great loss of life,
as  demonstrated  by  the  1970  Peru  earthquake.  In
that  event,  more  than  70,000  people  died,  and,  of
those,  20,000  were  killed  by  a  giant  landslide  that
buried the cities of Yungan and Ranrahirca. Both the
1964 Alaskan earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta

side of a mountain was triggered by the 2002 Alaska
earthquake (Figure 6.24). Thousands of other land-
slides were also triggered by the earthquake, most of
which were on the steep slopes of the Alaska Range.
A large landslide associated with the January 13,
2001,  El  Salvador  earthquake  (M  7.6)  buried  the
community of Las Colinas, killing hundreds of peo-
ple  (Figure  6.25).  Tragically,  the  landslide  could
probably have been avoided if the slope that failed
had  not  previously  been  cleared  of  vegetation  for
the construction of luxury homes.

The 2008 M 7.9 earthquake in China caused many
landslides. Very large landslides (Figure 6.26) buried
villages  and  blocked  rivers,  forming  “earthquake
lakes” that produced a serious ﬂood hazard, should
the  landslide  dam  fail  by  overtopping  or  erosion.
Channels  were  excavated  to  slowly  drain  lakes  and
reduce the ﬂood hazard.22

Fires
Fire  is  a  major  hazard  associated  with  earthquakes.
Shaking of the ground and surface displacements can
break  electrical  power  and  gas  lines,  thus  starting
ﬁres. In individual homes and other buildings, appli-
ances such as gas heaters may be knocked over, caus-
ing gas leaks that could be ignited. The threat from
ﬁre is intensiﬁed because ﬁreﬁghting equipment may

become damaged, and essential water mains may be
broken  during  an  earthquake.  Earthquakes  in  both
Japan and the United States have been accompanied
by devastating ﬁres (Figure 6.27). The San Francisco
earthquake of 1906 has been repeatedly referred to

as the “San Francisco Fire,” and, in fact, 80 percent of
the damage from that event was caused by ﬁrestorms
that ravaged the city for several days. The 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake also caused large ﬁres in the Ma-
rina district of San Francisco.

CHAPTER 6

Earthquakes

Disease
Landslides  from  the  1994  Northridge  earthquake
raised  large  volumes  of  dust,  some  of  which  con-
tained  fungi  spores  that  cause  valley  fever.  Winds
carried the dust and spores to urban areas, including
Simi  Valley,  where  an  outbreak  of  valley  fever  oc-
curred  during  an  8-week  period  after  the  earth-
quake. Two hundred cases were diagnosed, which is
16 times the normal infection rate; of these, 50 peo-
ple were hospitalized and 3 died.11 Earthquakes can
rupture sewer and water lines, causing water to be-
come  polluted  by  disease-causing  organisms.  The
death  of  animals  and  people  buried  in  earthquake
debris  also  produces  potential  sanitation  problems
that may result in an outbreak of disease.

Regional Changes in Groundwater
and Land Elevation
Earthquakes  can  alter  groundwater 
levels  and
stream ﬂow. Earth materials, such as ﬁne sediment
(i.e., sand, silt) when shaken can consolidate, forc-
ing water out (i.e., initiating spring or stream ﬂow).
Earthquakes can also fracture rock, increasing pore
spaces or cleaning out fractures to increase ground-
water ﬂow. Changes in water level and stream ﬂow
tend  to 
increase  with  earthquake  magnitude.
Groundwater  change  from  a  large  earthquake  can
occur hundreds to thousands of kilometers from the
epicenter, while changes in stream ﬂow (usually in-
creases)  can  occur  tens  to  hundreds  of  kilometers
from the epicenter.23,24

Vertical  deformation,  including  both  uplift  and
subsidence,  is  another  effect  of  some  large  earth-
quakes. Such deformation can cause regional changes
in  groundwater  levels.  The  great  1964  Alaskan
earthquake (M 8.3) caused regional uplift and subsi-
dence.25 The  uplift,  which  was  as  much  as  10  m
(33  ft), and the subsidence, which was as much as
2.4 m (7.8 ft), caused effects ranging from severely
disturbing or killing coastal marine life to changes in
groundwater levels. In areas of uplift, canneries and
ﬁshermen’s  homes  were  displaced  above  the  high-
tide line, rendering docks and other facilities inop-
erable. The subsidence resulted in ﬂooding of some
communities. In 1992, a major earthquake (M 7.1)
near  Cape  Mendocino  in  northwestern  California
produced approximately 1 m (3.3 ft) of uplift at the
shoreline,  resulting  in  the  death  of  marine  organ-
isms exposed by the uplift.26

Tsunami
Tsunami (from the Japanese word for “large harbor
waves”)  are  produced  by  the  sudden  vertical  dis-
placement  of  ocean  water.  Tsunami  (the  subject  of
Chapter  7)  are  a  serious  natural  hazard  that  can
cause  catastrophes  thousands  of  kilometers  from
where they originate.

6.11 Earthquake Risk and

Earthquake Prediction

The  great  damage  and  loss  of  life  associated  with
earthquakes  are  due,  in  part,  to  the  fact  that  they
often  strike  without  warning.  A  great  deal  of  re-
search is being devoted to anticipating earthquakes.
The best we can do at present is to use probabilistic
methods  to  determine  the  risk  associated  with  a
particular  area  or  with  a  particular  segment  of  a
fault.  Such  determinations  of  risk  are  a  form  of
long-term  prediction:  We  can  say  that  an  earth-
quake of a given magnitude or intensity has a high
probability of occurring in a given area or fault seg-
ment within a speciﬁed number of years. These pre-
dictions assist planners who are considering seismic
safety measures or people who are deciding where
to  live.  However,  long-term  prediction  does  not
help residents of a seismically active area to antici-
pate  and  prepare  for  a  specific  earthquake  over  a
period of days or weeks before an event. Short-term
prediction,  specifying  the  time  and  place  of  the
earthquake,  would  be  much  more  useful,  but  the
ability to make such predictions has eluded us. Pre-
dicting  imminent  earthquakes  depends  to  a  large
extent on observation of precursory phenomena, or
changes preceding the event.

Estimation of Seismic Risk
The earthquake risk associated with a particular area
is shown on seismic hazard maps, which are prepared
by scientists. Some of these maps show relative haz-
ard—that is, where earthquakes of a speciﬁed magni-
tude have occurred. However, a preferable method of
assessing seismic risk is to calculate the probability of
either  a  particular  event  or  the  amount  of  shaking
likely  to  occur.  Figure  6.28a shows  an  earthquake
hazard map for the United States. It was prepared on
the  basis  of  the  probability  of  horizontal  ground
motion. The darkest areas on the map represent the
regions of greatest seismic hazard because those areas

have  the  highest  probability  of  experiencing  the
greatest seismic shaking. Regional earthquake hazard
maps are valuable; however, considerably more data
are necessary to evaluate hazardous areas in order to
assist in the development of building codes and the
determination  of  insurance  rates.  Figure  6.28b
shows that the probability of one or more M 6.7 or
larger earthquakes occurring over a 30 year period in
California is a near certainty. The probability for a M
7.5 is also high; for M 8, the probability is about 1 in
25.27,28 Four  sources  of  data  were  used  to  estimate
the probability of earthquakes:27

• Geology: the  mapped  location  of  faults  with

documented offsets

• Paleoseismology: the  study  of  past  earthquake
history  from  trenches  excavated  across  faults
to  determine  dates  and  amount  of  displace-
ment from past events

• Geodesy: the  determination,  most  often  from
global positioning systems (GPSs), of how fast
Earth’s tectonic plates are moving

• Seismology: the occurrence of past earthquakes
detected by seismographs located at many lo-
cations that monitor when earthquakes occur
and how strong they are

Short-Term Prediction
The short-term prediction, or forecast, of earthquakes
is  an  active  area  of  research.  Similarly  to  a  weather

forecast, an earthquake forecast speciﬁes a relatively
short time period in which the event is likely to occur
and  assigns  it  a  probability  of  occurring.  The  basic
procedure  for  predicting  earthquakes  was  once
thought to be as easy as “one-two-three.”29 First, de-
ploy instruments to detect potential precursors of a
future earthquake; second, detect and recognize the
precursors in terms of when an earthquake will occur
and how big it will be; and, third, after review of your
data, publicly predict the earthquake. Unfortunately,
earthquake  prediction  is  much  more  complex  than
ﬁrst thought.29

The Japanese made the ﬁrst attempts at earthquake
prediction with some success, based on the frequency
of  microearthquakes  (M  less  than  2),  repetitive  sur-
veys of land levels, and a change in the local magnetic
ﬁeld  of  Earth.  They  found  that  earthquakes  in  the
areas they studied were nearly always accompanied by
swarms  of  microearthquakes  that  occurred  several
months before the major shocks. Furthermore, ground
tilt was correlated strongly with earthquake activity.

Chinese  scientists  made  the  ﬁrst  successful  pre-
diction of a major earthquake in 1975. The February
4, 1975, Haicheng earthquake (M 7.3) destroyed or
damaged about 90 percent of buildings in the city,
which  had  a  population  of  9,000.  The  short-term
prediction was based primarily on a series of fore-
shocks  that  began  4  days  before  the  main  event.
On February 1 and 2, several shocks with a magni-
tude  of  less  than  1  occurred.  On  February  3,  less

than 24 hours before the main shock, a foreshock of
M  2.4  occurred,  and,  in  the  next  17  hours,  eight
shocks  with  a  magnitude  greater  than  3  occurred.
Then, as suddenly as it began, the foreshock activity
became relatively quiet for 6 hours, until the main
earthquake  occurred.30 Haicheng’s  population  of
9,000 was saved by a massive evacuation from po-
tentially unsafe housing just before the earthquake.
Unfortunately,  foreshocks  do  not  always  precede
large earthquakes. In 1976, one of the deadliest earth-
quakes in recorded history struck near the mining town
of  Tanshan,  China,  killing  several  hundred  thousand

people. There were no foreshocks. Earthquake predic-
tion is still a complex problem, and it will probably be
many years before dependable short-range prediction is
possible.  Such  predictions  most  likely  will  be  based
upon precursory phenomena such as:

• Patterns and frequency of earthquakes, such as
the foreshocks used in the Haicheng prediction
• Preseismic deformation of the ground surface
• Emission of radon gas
• Seismic gaps along faults
• Anomalous animal behavior (?)

Preseismic Deformation 
of the Ground Surface
Rates of uplift and subsidence, especially when they
are  rapid  or  anomalous,  may  be  signiﬁcant  in  pre-
dicting earthquakes. For more than 10 years before
the  1964  earthquake  near  Niigata,  Japan  (M  7.5),
there was a broad uplift of Earth’s crust of several
centimeters near the Sea of Japan coast. Similarly,
broad  slow  uplift  of  several  centimeters  occurred
over a 5 year period before the 1983 Sea of Japan
earthquake (M 7.7).18

Preinstrument uplifts of 1 to 2 m (3.3 to 6.6 ft)
preceded  large  Japanese  earthquakes  in  1793,
1802, 1872, and 1927. Although these uplifts are
not well understood, they could have been indica-
tors  of  the  impending  earthquakes.  These  uplifts
were recognized by sudden withdrawals of the sea
from  the  land,  often  as  much  as  several  hundred
meters in harbors. For example, on the morning of
the  1802  earthquake,  the  sea  suddenly  withdrew
about 300 m (984 ft) from a harbor in response to
a  preseismic  uplift  of  about  1  m  (3.3  ft).  Four
hours  later,  the  earthquake  struck,  destroying
many  houses  and  uplifting  the  land  another
meter, causing the sea to withdraw an even greater
distance.31

Emission of Radon Gas
The levels of radon, a radioactive gas, have been ob-
served  to  increase  signiﬁcantly  before  some  earth-
quakes.  It  is  believed  that,  before  an  earthquake,
rocks expand, fracture, and experience an inﬂux of
water.  Radon  gas,  which  is  naturally  present  in
rocks, moves with the water. There was a signiﬁcant
increase  in  radon  gas  measured  in  water  wells  a
month  or  so  before  the  1995  Kobe,  Japan,  earth-
quake (M 7.2).32

Seismic Gaps
Seismic  gaps are  deﬁned  as  areas  along  active  fault
zones  or  within  regions  that  are  likely  to  produce
large earthquakes but have not caused one recently.
The lack of earthquakes is interpreted to be tempo-
rary; furthermore, these areas are thought to store
tectonic  strain  and  are,  thus,  candidates  for  future
large  earthquakes.33 Seismic  gaps  have  been  useful
in medium-range earthquake prediction. At least
10  large  plate  boundary  earthquakes  have  been

Earthquake Risk and Earthquake Prediction

205

successfully  forecast  from  seismic  gaps  since  1965,
including  one  in  Alaska,  three  in  Mexico,  one  in
South America, three in Japan, and one in Indonesia.
In the United States, seismic gaps along the San An-
dreas  fault  include  one  near  Fort  Tejon,  California,
that  last  ruptured  in  1857  and  one  along  the
Coachella Valley, a segment that has not produced a
great  earthquake  for  several  hundred  years.  Both
gaps are likely candidates to produce a great earth-
quake in the next few decades.17,33

As Earth scientists examine patterns of seismicity,
two ideas are emerging. First, there are sometimes re-
ductions in small or moderate earthquakes prior to a
larger event. For example, prior to the 1978 (M 7.8)
Oaxaca, Mexico, earthquake, there was a 10-year pe-
riod  (1963  to  1973)  of  relatively  high  seismicity  of
earthquakes (mostly M 3 to 6.5), followed by a quies-
cence period of 5 years. Renewed activity beginning
10 months before the M 7.8 event was the basis of a
successful  prediction.31 Second,  small  earthquakes
may tend to ring an area where a larger event might
eventually occur. Such a ring (or donut) was noticed
in the 16 months prior to the 1983 M 6.2 event in
Coalinga,  California.  Unfortunately,  hindsight  is
clearer than foresight, and this ring was not noticed
or identiﬁed until after the event.

Anomalous Animal Behavior (?)
Anomalous  animal  behavior  has  often  been  re-
ported  before  large  earthquakes.  Reports  have  in-
cluded dogs barking unusually, chickens refusing to
lay  eggs,  horses  or  cattle  running  in  circles,  rats
perching on power lines, and snakes crawling out in
the winter and freezing. Anomalous behavior of an-
imals  was  evidently  common  before  the  Haicheng
earthquake.30 Years  ago,  it  was  suggested  that,
sometime  in  the  future,  we  might  have  animals,
such  as  ground  squirrels  or  snakes  in  cages,  along
faults, and that somehow they would tell us when
an earthquake is likely to occur in the near future.
Undoubtedly,  some  animals  are  much  more  sensi-
tive  to  Earth  movements  and  possible  changes  in
Earth  before  an  earthquake  or  landslide  than  are
people. However, the signiﬁcance and reliability of
animal behavior are very difﬁcult to evaluate. There
is little research going on to further explore anom-
alous  animal  behavior  in  the  United  States,  but  it
remains one of the interesting mysteries surround-
ing earthquakes.

6.12 Toward Earthquake

Prediction

We  are  still  a  long  way  from  a  working,  practical
methodology  with  which  to  reliably  predict  earth-
quakes. However, a good deal of information is cur-
rently being gathered concerning possible precursor
phenomena  associated  with  earthquakes.  To  date,
the  most  useful  precursor  phenomena  have  been
patterns  of  earthquakes,  particularly  foreshocks,
and  seismic  gaps.  Optimistic  scientists  around  the
world today believe that we will eventually be able to
make consistent long-range forecasts (tens to a few
thousand  years),  medium-range  predictions  (a  few
years to a few months), and short-range predictions
(a few days or hours) for the general locations and
magnitudes of large, damaging earthquakes.

Although  progress  on  short-range  (days  to
months) earthquake prediction has not matched ex-
pectations, medium- to long-range forecast (years to
decades), based on the probability of an earthquake
occurring on a particular fault, has progressed faster
than  expected.  The  October  28,  1983,  Borah  Peak
earthquake in central Idaho (M 7.3) has been lauded
as  a  success  story  for  medium-range  earthquake
hazard  evaluation.  Previous  evaluation  of  the  Lost
River fault suggested that the fault was active.34 The
earthquake  killed  two  people  and  caused  approxi-
mately  $15  million  in  damages.  Fault  scarps  up  to
several meters high and numerous ground fractures
along the 36 km (22 mi) rupture zone of the fault
were produced as a result of the earthquake. The im-
portant fact was that the scarp and faults produced
during the earthquake were superimposed on previ-
ously existing fault scarps, validating the usefulness
of careful mapping of scarps produced from prehis-
toric  earthquakes.  Remember:  Where  the  ground
has broken before, it is likely to break again!

6.13 Sequence of Earthquakes 

in Turkey: Can One
Earthquake Set up Another?
There is considerable controversy regarding patterns
of repetitive earthquakes. Do earthquakes on a given
fault have return periods that are relatively constant
with  relatively  constant-magnitude  earthquakes,  or
do  they  tend  to  occur  in  clusters  over  a  period  of

several  hundred  to  several  thousand  years?  Un-
doubtedly,  one  of  the  most  remarkable  sites  in  the
world  for  paleoseismic  studies  is  Pallett  Creek,  lo-
cated approximately 55 km northeast of Los Angeles
on the Mojave segment of the San Andreas fault. The
site contains evidence of 10 large earthquakes, 2 of
which occurred in historical time (1812 and 1857),
and  prehistoric  events  extending  back  to  approxi-
mately A.D. 671.35 High-precision radiocarbon dating
methods  provide  accurate  dating  of  most  of  the  8
prehistoric events. When the dates and their accom-
panying error bars are plotted, it is apparent that the
earthquakes are not evenly distributed through time
but tend to cluster. Most of the earthquakes within
clusters are separated by a few decades, but the time
between  clusters  varies  from  approximately  160  to
360 years. The earthquakes were identiﬁed through
careful  evaluation  of  natural  exposures  and  fault
trenches at Pallett Creek.35 Figure 6.29 shows part
of the trench wall and the offset of organic-rich sedi-
mentary  layers  that  correspond  to  an  earthquake
that occurred in approximately A.D. 1100. Naturally,
the question we wish to ask is, when will the next big
earthquake occur on the Mojave segment of the San
Andreas fault? Studies using conditional probability
suggest that probability is approximately 60 percent
for  the  next  30-year  period  (see  Figure  6.28b).  As-
suming that the two historic events are a cluster and,
if clusters can be separated by approximately 160 to
360 years, then the next large earthquake might be
expected between the years 2017 and 2207. On the
other  hand,  the  data  set  at  Pallett  Creek,  although
the most complete record for any fault in the world,
is still a study of small numbers.

A study of the San Andreas fault, about 200 km
(125 mi) northwest of Pallett Creek, discovered evi-
dence for six earthquakes since A.D. 1360, with aver-
age return period of about a century (88⫾41 years).
The size distribution of these events is not well con-
strained. Some could be strong earthquakes (M 6.5
to 7), while others could be major earthquakes (M
7.5 to 7.9).36 The more we learn about the San An-
dreas  fault,  the  more  variable  past  earthquakes
seem  to  be  in  terms  of  both  time  and  magnitude.
However, major events appear to occur about every
150 years on average, which is about the time since
the last big one in 1857.

Some faults, evidently, do produce earthquakes of
similar magnitude over relatively constant return pe-
riods.  However,  as  we  learn  more  about  individual

faults, we learn that there is a great deal of variability
concerning magnitudes of earthquakes and their re-
turn periods for a given fault system. For example, in
the twentieth century, a remarkable series of earth-
quakes  with  magnitude  greater  than  6.7  generally
occurred from east to west on the North Anatolian

fault in Turkey, resulting in surface ruptures along a
1,000 km (621 mi) section of the fault (Figure 6.30).

causing  billions  of  dollars  in  property  damage  and
thousands  of  deaths.  The  sequence  of  earthquakes

208

CHAPTER 6

Earthquakes

has been described as a “falling-domino scenario,” in
which  one  earthquake  sets  up  the  next,  eventually
rupturing nearly the entire length of the fault, in a
cluster  of  events.37,38 Clusters  of  earthquakes  that
form a progressive sequence of events in a relatively
short  period  of  time  are  apparently  separated  by  a
period of no earthquakes for several hundred years.
A  similar  sequence  or  clustering  may  be  occurring
along the fault bordering the Sumatra Plate bound-
ary  in  Indonesia.  Three  earlier  large  earthquakes
from  1600  to  1833,  discovered  from  the  geologic
record, preceded the 2004 event, and a M 8.7 event
occurred in 2005. That earthquake did not produce a
tsunami,  but  it  collapsed  buildings  and  took  about
1,000 lives.7 Understanding processes related to clus-
tering of earthquakes along a particular fault is very
important if we are to plan for future seismic events in
a given region. The fact that there may not have been
a  large  damaging  earthquake  for  several  hundred
years may not be as reassuring as we once thought.

6.14 The Response to

Earthquake Hazards

Responses  to  seismic  hazards  in  earthquake-prone
areas include development of hazard-reduction pro-
grams, careful siting of critical facilities, engineering
and  land-use  adjustments  to  earthquake  activity,
and  development  of  a  warning  system.  The  extent
to which these responses occur depends, in part, on
people’s perception of the hazard.

Earthquake Hazard-Reduction
Programs
In  the  United  States,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey
(USGS),  as  well  as  university  and  other  scientists,
are developing the National Earthquake Hazard Re-
duction  Program.  The  major  goals  of  the  program
are to:

• Develop  an  understanding  of  the  earthquake
source: This  requires  an  understanding  of  the
physical properties and mechanical behavior of
faults,  as  well  as  development  of  quantitative
models of the physics of the earthquake process.
• Determine  earthquake  potential: This  deter-
mination involves characterizing seismically ac-
tive regions, including determining the rates of
crustal  deformation;  identifying  active  faults;

determining characteristics of paleoseismicity;
estimating strong ground motion, slip rate, and
earthquake  recurrence 
interval;  calculating
long-term probabilistic forecasts; and develop-
ing  methods  of  intermediate-  and  short-term
prediction of earthquakes. (See A Closer Look:
Earthquake  Hazard  Evaluation:  Ground  Mo-
tion and Slip Rate.)

• Predict  effects  of  earthquakes: Predicting  ef-
fects includes gathering the data necessary for
predicting ground rupture and shaking and for
predicting  the  response  of  structures  that  we
build  in  earthquake-prone  areas  and  evaluat-
ing the losses associated with the earthquake
hazard. (See A Closer Look: The Alaska Earth-
quake of 2002 and the Value of Estimating Po-
tential Ground Rupture.)

• Apply research results: The program is inter-
ested  in  transferring  knowledge  about  earth-
quake hazards to people, communities, states,
and the nation. This knowledge concerns what
can be done to better plan for earthquakes and
to reduce potential losses of life and property.

Adjustments to Earthquake Activity
The mechanism of earthquakes is still poorly under-
stood; therefore, such adjustments as warning sys-
tems and earthquake prevention are not yet reliable
alternatives. There are, however, reliable protective
measures we can take:

• Structural protection, including the construction
of large buildings and other structures, such as
dams,  power  plants,  and  pipelines  able  to  ac-
commodate  moderate  shaking  or  surface  rup-
ture.  This  measure  has  been 
relatively
successful  in  the  United  States.  (See  A  Closer
Look: The Alaska Earthquake of 2002 and the
Value of Estimating Potential Ground Rupture.)
The  1988  Armenia  earthquake  (M  6.8)  was
somewhat  larger  than  the  1994  Northridge
event (M 6.7), but the loss of life and destruc-
tion  in  Armenia  were  staggering.  At  least
45,000 people were killed, compared with 57 in
California, and near-total destruction occurred
in some towns near the epicenter. Most build-
ings  in  Armenia  were  constructed  of  unrein-
forced  concrete  and  instantly  crumbled  into
rubble,  crushing  or  trapping  their  occupants.
The  2005  Pakistan  M  7.6  earthquake  killed
more than 80,000 people. Many of the deaths
occurred  as  apartment  buildings  with  little  or
no steel reinforcement collapsed to resemble a

The primary purpose of earthquake
hazard assessment is to provide a
safeguard against loss of life and
major structural failures rather than to
limit damage or to maintain func-
tional aspects of society, including
roads and utilities.39 The
basic philosophy behind
the evaluation of seismic
hazard is to have what is
known as a design basis
ground motion, deﬁned as
the ground motion that has
a 10 percent chance of
being exceeded in a 50-year
period (equivalent to 1
chance in 475 of being
exceeded each year). This is
determined in California by
a series of maps that show
strong-motion peak ground
acceleration (PGA) for
earthquake waves of a 
0.3-second period for one-
and two-story buildings
and a 1.0-second period for
buildings taller than two
stories.40 The U.S. Geological
Survey has programs to
predict peak acceleration
and velocity of shaking
through generation of an
earthquake-planning sce-
nario for a particular fault.
For example, Figure 6.C
shows a scenario for a 
M 7.2 event on the San 
Andreas fault at San 
Francisco, California.41

(i.e., faults) in the area. The tectonic
framework shown consists of a
north-dipping reverse fault and an
associated fold (an anticline) located
to the north of the dam, as well as a
right-lateral strike-slip fault located
to the south of the dam. Figure 6.Eb
shows a cross section through the
dam, illustrating the geologic envi-
ronment, including several different

Earth materials, folds, and faults.
Assuming that earthquakes would
occur at depths of approximately
10 km, the distances from the dam to
the two seismic sources (the reverse
fault and the strike-slip fault) are
42 km and 32 km, respectively. Thus,
for this area, two focal mechanisms
are possible: reverse faulting and
strike-slip faulting.

Another step in the process is to

estimate the largest earthquakes
likely to occur on these faults. Assume
that ﬁeldwork in the area revealed
ground rupture and other evidence
of faulting in the past, suggesting
that, on the strike-slip fault, approxi-
mately 50 km of fault length might
rupture in a single event, with right-
lateral strike-slip motion of 2 m. The

212

CHAPTER 6

Earthquakes

ﬁeldwork also revealed that the
largest rupture likely on the reverse
fault would be 30 km of fault length,
with vertical displacement of about
1.5 m. Given this information, the
magnitudes of possible earthquake
events can be estimated from graphs
such as those shown in Figure 6.F.42
Fifty kilometers of surface rupture are
associated with an earthquake of
approximately Mw 7. Similarly, for the

reverse fault with surface rupture
length of 30 km, the magnitude of a
possible earthquake is estimated to
be Mw 6.5. Notice that, in Figure 6.F,
the regression line that predicts the
moment magnitude is for strike-slip,
normal, and reverse faults. Statistical
analyses have suggested that the re-
lation between moment magnitude
and length of surface rupture is not
sensitive to the style of faulting.42

Slip rate (the vertical component)

and average return period may be
estimated from geologic data col-
lected in a trench excavated across a
fault. Figure 6.G shows the stratigra-
phy (trench log) for the site shown
in Figure 6.Ea. The slip rate is about
1 mm/yr (1 m/1,000 years), and 
the average return period is about
1,300 years.

stack  of  pancakes7 (also  see  the  case  history
opening this chapter). This is not to say that the
Northridge earthquake was not a catastrophe. It
certainly  was;  the  Northridge  earthquake  left
25,000 people homeless, caused the collapse of
several  freeway  overpasses,  injured  approxi-
mately 8,000 people, and inﬂicted many billions
of  dollars  in  damages  to  structures  and  build-
ings (Figure 6.A). However, since most buildings
in  the  Los  Angeles  Basin  are  constructed  with
wood frames or reinforced concrete, thousands
of deaths were avoided in Northridge.

• Land  use  planning,  including  the  siting  of  im-
portant  structures  such  as  schools,  hospitals,
and  police  stations  in  areas  away  from  active
faults  or  sensitive  Earth  materials  that  are
likely  to  increase  seismic  shaking.  This  plan-
ning involves zoning the ground’s response to
seismic shaking on a block-by-block basis. Zon-
ing  for  earthquakes  in  land-use  planning  is
necessary  because  ground  conditions  can
change  quickly  in  response  to  shaking.  In
urban areas, where property values may be as
high as millions to billions of dollars per block,
we  need  to  produce  detailed  maps  of  ground
response to accomplish zonation. These maps
will assist engineers when designing buildings
and other structures that can better withstand
seismic  shaking.  Clearly,  zonation  requires  a
signiﬁcant  investment  of  time  and  money;
however,  the  ﬁrst  step  is  to  develop  methods
that  adequately  predict  the  ground  motion
from an earthquake at a speciﬁc site.

• Increased  insurance  and  relief  measures to  help
adjustments after earthquakes. After the 1994
Northridge earthquake, total insurance claims

were  very  large,  and  some  insurance  compa-
nies terminated earthquake insurance.

We hope to be able to predict earthquakes eventu-
ally. The federal plan for issuing prediction and warn-
ing is shown in Figure 6.31. Notice how it is related
to the general ﬂow path for issuance of a disaster pre-
diction shown in Figure 5.14. The general ﬂow of in-
formation  moves  from  scientists  to  a  prediction
council  for  veriﬁcation.  Once  veriﬁed,  a  prediction

The Alaska Earthquake of 2002 and the Value of
Estimating Potential Ground Rupture

On November 3, 2002, a magnitude
7.9 earthquake occurred in early
afternoon on the Denali fault in
south-central Alaska. That event pro-
duced approximately 340 km of
surface rupture, with maximum right-
slip displacement of just over 8 m
(Figure 6.H). The earthquake struck a
remote part of Alaska where few
people live, and, although it caused
thousands of landslides and numerous
examples of liquefaction and intense
shaking, little structural damage and
no deaths were recorded.43

The Denali fault earthquake

demonstrated the value of seismic
hazard and earthquake hazard evalu-
ation. The fault was studied in the

early 1970s, as part of an evaluation
of the Trans-Alaskan pipeline that
today supplies approximately 17 per-
cent of the domestic oil supply for
the United States. Where the pipeline
crosses the Denali fault, geologists
determined that the fault zone was
several hundred meters wide and
might experience a 6 m horizontal
displacement from a magnitude 8
earthquake. These estimates were
used in the design of the pipeline,
which included long, horizontal steel
beams with Teﬂon shoes that allowed
the pipeline to slide horizontally ap-
proximately 6 m. This was accompa-
nied by the utilization of a zigzag
pattern of the pipeline that allowed,

along with the steel beams, the hori-
zontal movement (Figure 6.H). The
2002 earthquake occurred within the
mapped zone of the fault and sus-
tained about 4.3 m (14 ft) of right-lat-
eral strike-slip. As a result, the
pipeline suffered little damage, and
there was no oil spill. The cost in 1970
of the engineering and construction
was about $3 million. Today, that
looks very cost-effective, considering
that approximately $25 million worth
of oil per day is transported via the
pipeline. If the pipeline had been
ruptured, the cost of repair and
cleanup of the environment might
have been several hundred million
dollars.44

the value of estimating potential ground rupture and taking action to remove the potential threat and damage. (Alyeska Pipeline Service

would occur at a particular location during a speciﬁed
time would be issued to state and local ofﬁcials. These
ofﬁcials are responsible for issuing a warning to the
public to take defensive action that, one hopes, has
been planned in advance. Potential response to a pre-
diction depends upon lead time, but even a few days
would  be  sufﬁcient  to  mobilize  emergency  service,
shut  down  important  machinery,  and  evacuate  par-
ticularly hazardous areas.

Earthquake Warning Systems
Technically,  it  is  feasible  to  develop  an  earthquake
warning  system  that  would  provide  10  seconds  or
more warning to California cities before the arrival of
damaging  earthquake  waves  from  an  event  several
hundred kilometers away. This type of system is based
on the principle that the warning sent by a radio sig-
nal via satellite relay travels much faster than seismic
waves.  The  Japanese  have  had  a  system  (with  more
than  1,000  seismometers)  for  nearly  20  years  that
provides  earthquake  warnings  for  high-speed  trains;
train derailment by an earthquake could result in the

loss  of  hundreds  of  lives.  A  proposed  system  for
California involves a network of seismometers (there
are  currently  about  300)  and  transmitters  along  the
San Andreas and other faults. This system would ﬁrst
sense motion associated with a large earthquake and
then send a warning to Los Angeles, which would then
relay the warning to critical facilities, schools, and the
general  population  (Figure  6.32).  The  warning  time
would vary from as little as 10 seconds to as long as
about 1 minute, depending on the location of the epi-
center of the earthquake. This could be enough time
for  people  to  shut  down  machinery  and  computers
and take cover.45,46 Note that this earthquake warn-
ing system is not a prediction tool; it only warns that
an earthquake has already occurred.

A potential problem with a warning system is the
chance of false alarms. For the Japanese system, the
number of false alarms is less than 5 percent. How-
ever,  because  the  warning  time  is  so  short,  some
people have expressed concern about whether much
evasive action could be taken. There is also concern
about  liability  issues  resulting  from  false  alarms,
warning system failures, and damage and suffering

and facilities. The warning time depends on how far away an earthquake occurs. It could be long
enough to shut down critical facilities and for people to take cover. (After Holden, R., Lee, R., and

resulting  from  actions  taken  as  the  result  of  false
early warning. The next step for California is to deter-
mine how big the seismic network will need to be, in-
stall  the  necessary  seismometers,  and  upgrade  the
communication system so warnings can be sent out
reliably.46

Perception of Earthquake Hazard
The fact that terra ﬁrma is not so ﬁrm in places is
disconcerting to people who have experienced even
a moderate earthquake. The large number of people,
especially  children,  who  suffered  mental  distress
after the San Fernando and Northridge earthquakes
attests to the emotional and psychological effects of
earthquakes. These events were sufﬁcient to inﬂu-
ence the decision of a number of families to move
away from Los Angeles.

The Japanese were caught off guard by the 1995
Kobe  earthquake,  and  the  government  was  criti-
cized  for  not  mounting  a  quick  and  effective  re-
sponse. Emergency relief did not arrive until about
10  hours  after  the  earthquake!  They  evidently  be-
lieved that their buildings and highways were rela-
tively safe, compared with those that had failed in
Northridge, California, a year earlier.

As  mentioned  earlier,  a  remarkable  sequence  of
earthquakes in Turkey terminated in 1999 with two
large damaging earthquakes (Figure 6.30). The ﬁrst
occurred  on  August  17  and  leveled  thousands  of
concrete  buildings.  As  a  result  of  the  earthquake,
600,000  people  were  left  homeless,  and  approxi-
mately  38,000  people  died.  Some  of  the  extensive
damage to the town of Golcuk in western Turkey is
shown  in  Figure  6.33.  Note  that  the  very  old
mosque on the left is still standing, whereas many
modern buildings collapsed, suggesting that earlier
construction was more resistant to earthquakes. Al-
though  Turkey  has  a  relatively  high  standard  for
new construction to withstand earthquakes, there is
fear that poor construction was a factor in the col-
lapse of the newer buildings, due to the intense seis-
mic  shaking.  It  has  been  alleged  that  some  of  the
Turkish contractors bulldozed the rubble from col-
lapsed buildings soon after the earthquake, perhaps
in an effort to remove evidence of shoddy construc-
tion. If that allegation is true, these contractors also
tied up bulldozers that could have been used to help
rescue people trapped in collapsed buildings.

The lessons learned from Northridge, Kobe, Turkey,
Pakistan,  and  Haiti  were  bitter  ones  that  illuminate
our modern society’s vulnerability to catastrophic loss

CHAPTER 6

Earthquakes

from large earthquakes. Older, unreinforced concrete
buildings or buildings not designed to withstand strong
ground  motion  are  most  susceptible  to  damage.  In
Kobe, reinforced concrete buildings constructed post-
1990  with  improved  seismic  building  codes  experi-
enced little damage, compared with those constructed
in  the  mid-1960s  or  earlier.  Minimizing  the  hazard
requires new thinking about the hazard. In addition,
microzonation  is  instrumental  in  the  engineering
response to design structures that are less vulnerable
to ground motion from earthquakes.

Personal and Community
Adjustments: Before, During, 
and After an Earthquake
A group of individuals living in an area deﬁne a com-
munity, whether it is a village, town, or city. In areas
with an earthquake hazard, it is important for peo-
ple to prepare for the hazard in terms of what can be
done before, during, and after an earthquake.

At  the  community  level,  one  important  aspect  of
earthquake preparedness is enforcing building codes,
such as the Uniform Building Code of California. The
objective of the earthquake section of the code is to
provide safeguards against loss of life and major struc-
tural  failures  through  better  design  of  buildings  to
allow them to better withstand earthquake shaking.
Another  important  task  is  the  inspection of older
buildings to determine if a “retroﬁt” is necessary to in-
crease the strength of the building in order to better
withstand earthquakes. In fact, the state of California
has  regulated  building  retroﬁts.  A  recent  study  con-
cluded that many of the hospitals in southern Califor-
nia are in need of extensive and costly retroﬁtting.

Education  is  also  an  important  component  of
earthquake  preparedness  at  the  community  level.
Government, state, and local agencies prepare pam-
phlets and videos concerning the earthquake hazard
and help ensure that this information is distributed
to the public. Workshops and training meetings con-
cerning the most up-to-date information on how to
minimize  earthquake  hazards  are  available  to  pro-
fessionals in engineering, geology, and planning. A
great deal of information at the community level is
also available on the World Wide Web from a variety
of sources, including the U.S. Geological Survey and
scientiﬁc organizations, such as the Southern Cali-
fornia Earthquake Center, as well as other agencies
interested in earthquake hazard reduction.47

In  schools,  it  is  important  to  practice  what  is
sometimes  called  the  “earthquake  drill”:  Everyone
pretends that an earthquake is happening, and stu-
dents “duck, cover, and hold.” After about 15 or 20
seconds, students emerge from their duck-and-cover
location, take ﬁve slow, deep breaths, practice calm-
ing down, and then walk to a designated safe area.

A massive earthquake drill was held on November
13,  2008,  for  the  Los  Angeles  region.  Known  as  the
Great Southern California Shake Out, the drill involved
millions of people. The scenario (potential) earthquake
was a M 7.8 event on the southern San Andreas fault
that  resulted  in  2,000  deaths,  50,000  injuries,  and
$200 billion in losses, with extensive and long-lasting
disruption. The drill helped evaluate emergency prepa-
ration  for  a  large  earthquake  and  made  people  more
aware of what we know is coming. We will know how
successful the drill was after the real event occurs.

At the personal level in homes and apartments, it
is estimated that billions of dollars of damages from
earthquakes  could  be  avoided  if  our  buildings  and
contents were better secured to withstand shaking
from  earthquakes.  Before  an  earthquake  occurs,
homeowners  and  apartment  dwellers  should  com-
plete  a  thorough  check  of  the  building,  including
rooms, foundations, garages, and attics. The follow-
ing are some items of a home safety check:47

• Be  sure  your  chimney  has  been  reinforced  to
withstand shaking from earthquakes. After the
1994 Northridge earthquake, one of the most
commonly observed types of damage was col-
lapsed chimneys.

• Be sure your home is securely fastened to the
foundation  and  that  there  are  panels  of  ply-
wood between the wooden studs in walls. Make
sure that large openings, such as garage doors
with a ﬂoor above, are adequately braced.

• Within the house, be sure that anything that is
heavy enough to hurt you if it falls on you, or is
fragile  and  expensive,  is  secured.  There  are
ways to secure tabletop objects, television sets,
tall furniture, and cabinet doors.

• Large windows and sliding doors may be covered
with  strong  polyester  (Mylar)  ﬁlms  to  make
them safer and reduce the hazard from broken
glass that is shattered during earthquakes.

• Ensure that your gas water heater is strapped to
the building so that it will not fall over and start
a ﬁre. If necessary, change to ﬂexible gas con-
nections that can withstand some movement.

Probably the most important and rational thing
you can do before an earthquake is to prepare a plan
of exactly what you will do if a large earthquake oc-
curs. This might include the following points:47

• Teach everyone in your family to “duck, cover,
and hold.” For each room in your home, identi-
fy  safe  spots,  such  as  under  a  sturdy  desk  or
table or near strong interior walls.

• Instruct everyone who might be home how to
turn  off  the  gas.  However,  the  gas  should  be
turned off only if a leak is detected through ei-
ther hearing or smelling the leaking gas.

• After  an  earthquake,  out-of-area  phone  calls
are often much easier to place and receive than
local  calls.  Therefore,  establish  an  out-of-area
person who can be contacted.

• Be  sure  you  have  necessary  supplies,  such  as
food, water, ﬁrst-aid kit, ﬂashlights, and some
cash  to  tide  you  over  during  the  emergency
period when it may be difﬁcult to obtain some
items.

• Canvass your neighborhood and identify elder-
ly  or  disabled  neighbors  who  may  need  your
help in the event of an earthquake and help ed-
ucate others in the neighborhood about how to
prepare their own plans.

During  an  earthquake,  the  strong  ground  motion
will greatly restrict your motion, and, as a result, your
strategy  should  be  to  “duck,  cover,  and  hold.”  Given
your  knowledge  of  earthquakes,  you  may  also  try  to
recognize  how  strong  the  earthquake  is  likely  to  be
and to predict what may happen during the event. For
example, you know there will be several types of waves,
including  P,  S,  and  R  waves.  The  P  waves  will  arrive
ﬁrst, and you may even hear them coming. However,
the S and R waves, which soon follow, have bigger dis-
placement and cause most of the damage. The length
of  shaking  during  an  earthquake  will  vary  with  the
magnitude. For example, during the 1994 Northridge
earthquake, the shaking lasted approximately 15 sec-
onds,  but  the  time  of  shaking  in  a  great  earthquake
may be much longer. For example, during the 1906 San
Francisco earthquake, shaking lasted nearly 2 minutes.
In addition to the “duck, cover, and hold” strategy, you
need to remain calm during an earthquake and try to
protect yourself from appliances, books, and other ma-
terials  possibly  sliding  or  ﬂying  across  the  room.  A
good strategy would be to crouch under a desk or table,
roll under a bed, or position yourself in a strong doorway.

The Response to Earthquake Hazards

217

During the earthquake, there may be explosive ﬂashes
from transformers and power poles, and you must ob-
viously avoid downed power lines. At all costs, resist
the natural urge to panic.47

After  the  shaking  stops,  take  your  deep  breaths
and organize your thinking in accordance with the
plan you developed. Check on your family members
and  neighbors,  and  check  for  gas  leaks  and  ﬁres.
Your telephones should be used only for emergency
calls. Examine your chimney, as chimneys are partic-
ularly prone to failure from earthquakes. The chim-
ney  may  separate  from  the  roof  or  the  walls  along
the side of the chimney. If you are caught in a the-
ater or stadium during a large earthquake, it is im-
portant  to  remain  in  your  seat  and  protect  your
head  and  neck  with  your  arms;  do  not  attempt  to
leave  until  the  shaking  has  stopped.  Remain  calm
and  walk  out  slowly,  keeping  a  careful  eye  out  for
objects that have fallen or may fall. If you are in a
shopping mall, it is important to “duck, cover, and
hold” away from glass doors and display shelves of
books or other objects that could fall on you. If you
are  outdoors  and  an  earthquake  occurs,  it  is  pru-
dent  to  move  to  a  clear  area  where  you  can  avoid
falling  trees,  buildings,  power  lines,  or  other  haz-
ards. If you are in a mountainous area, be aware of
landslide hazards, since an earthquake may gener-
ate slides that occur during and for some time after
the  earthquake.  If  you  are  in  a  high-rise  building,
you need to “duck, cover, and hold,” as in any other
indoor  location,  avoiding  any  large  windows.  It  is
likely that the shaking may activate ﬁre alarms and
water  sprinkler  systems.  Streets  lined  with  tall
buildings  are  very  dangerous  locations  during  an
earthquake; glass from these buildings often shat-
ters  and  falls  to  the  street  below,  and  the  razor-
sharp  shards  can  cause  serious  damage  and  death
to people below.47

Finally,  after  an  earthquake,  be  prepared  for  af-
tershocks.  There  is  a  known  relationship  between
the  magnitude  of  the  primary  earthquake  and  the
distribution of aftershocks in hours, days, months,
or even years following the earthquake. If the earth-
quake  has  a  magnitude  of  about  7,  then  several
magnitude  6  aftershocks  can  be  expected.  Many
magnitude 5 and 4 events are likely to occur. In gen-
eral,  the  number  and  size  of  aftershocks  decrease
with time from the main earthquake event, and the
most hazardous period is in the minutes, hours, and
days following the main shock.

218

CHAPTER 6

Earthquakes

The  good  news  concerning  living  in  earthquake
country  in  the  United  States  is  that  large  earth-
quakes  are  survivable.  Our  buildings  are  generally
constructed  to  withstand  earthquake  shaking,
and our woodframe houses seldom collapse. It is,

however,  important  to  be  well  informed  and  pre-
pared  for  earthquakes.  For  that  reason,  it  is  ex-
tremely important to develop and become familiar
with your personal plan of what to do before, dur-
ing, and after an earthquake.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About Recent Earthquakes in Italy and  Haiti 
to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. What is the main lesson from
the recent earthquakes in Italy
and Haiti?

2. How are science and values

linked to the two earthquakes
discussed?

3. Italy is a wealthy country com-
pared to Haiti. How important is
the wealth of a country to reduc-
ing the earthquake hazard?

Summary

Large earthquakes rank among na-
ture’s most catastrophic and devastat-
ing events. Most earthquakes occur in
tectonically active areas where lithos-
pheric plates interact along their
boundaries, but some large damaging
intraplate earthquakes also occur.

A fault is a fracture or fracture sys-
tem along which rocks have been dis-
placed. Strain builds up in the rocks
on either side of a fault as the sides
pull in different directions. When the
stress exceeds the strength of the
rocks, they rupture, giving rise to
seismic, or earthquake, waves that
shake the ground.

Strike-slip faults exhibit horizontal

displacement and are either right or
left lateral. Dip-slip faults exhibit ver-
tical displacement and are either nor-
mal or reverse. Some faults are buried
and do not rupture the surface, even
when their movement causes large
earthquakes. Recently, a new funda-
mental Earth process known as slow
earthquakes has been discovered.
Slow earthquakes may last from days

to months, with large areas of fault
rupture but small displacements.

A fault is usually considered active
if it has moved during the past 10,000
years and potentially active if it has
moved during the past 1.65 million
years. Some faults exhibit tectonic
creep, a slow displacement not accom-
panied by felt earthquakes.

The area within Earth where fault
rupture begins is called the focus of
the earthquake and can be from a few
kilometers to almost 700 km (435 mi)
deep. The area of the surface directly
above the focus is called the epicenter.
Seismic waves of different kinds
travel away from the focus at differ-
ent rates; much of the damage from
earthquakes is caused by surface
waves. The severity of shaking of the
ground and buildings is affected by
the frequency of the seismic waves
and by the type of Earth material pre-
sent. Buildings on unconsolidated
sediments or landﬁll, which tend to
amplify the shaking, are highly sub-
ject to earthquake damage.

The magnitude of an earthquake is
a measure of the amount of energy re-
leased. The measure of the intensity
of an earthquake, the Modiﬁed Mer-
calli Scale, is based on the severity of
shaking as reported by observers and
varies with proximity to the epicenter
and local geologic and engineering
features. Following an earthquake,
shake maps, based on a dense net-
work of seismographs, can quickly
show areas where potentially damag-
ing shaking occurred. This information
is needed quickly to assist emergency
efforts. Ground acceleration during
an earthquake is important informa-
tion necessary to design structures
that can withstand shaking.

The hypothesized earthquake cycle
for large earthquakes has four stages.
A period of seismic inactivity, during
which elastic strain builds up in the
rocks along a fault, is followed by a
period of increased seismicity as the
strain locally exceeds the strength of
the rocks, initiating local faulting and
small earthquakes. The third stage,

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts

219

which does not always occur, consists
of foreshocks. The fourth stage is the
major earthquake, which occurs when
the fault segment ruptures, producing
the elastic rebound that generates
seismic waves.

Human activity has caused increas-

ing earthquake activity by loading
Earth’s crust through construction of
large reservoirs; by disposal of liquid
waste in deep disposal wells, which
raises ﬂuid pressures in rocks and fa-
cilitates movement along fractures;
and by setting off underground nu-
clear explosions. The accidental dam-
age caused by the ﬁrst two activities
is regrettable, but what we learn from
all the ways we have caused earth-
quakes may eventually help us to
control or stop large earthquakes.

Effects of earthquakes include vio-
lent ground motion, accompanied by
fracturing, which may shear or collapse
large buildings, bridges, dams, tunnels,
and other rigid structures. Other ef-
fects include liquefaction, landslides,
fires, and regional subsidence and

uplift of landmasses, as well as re-
gional changes in groundwater levels
and surface water ﬂow. Large to
great submarine earthquakes can
generate a damaging catastrophic
tsunami (see Chapter 7).

Prediction of earthquakes is a sub-
ject of serious research. To date, long-
term and medium-term earthquake
prediction, based on probabilistic
analysis, has been much more suc-
cessful than short-term prediction.
Long-term prediction provides impor-
tant information for land-use plan-
ning, developing building codes, and
engineering design of critical facili-
ties. Some scientists believe that we
will eventually be able to make long-,
medium-, and short-range predic-
tions, based on previous patterns and
frequency of earthquakes, as well as
by monitoring the deformation of
land, the release of radon gas, and
existing seismic gaps. Although not
currently being pursued, reports sug-
gest that anomalous animal behavior
before an earthquake may offer 

potential aid in earthquake predic-
tion. A potential problem of predict-
ing earthquakes is that their pattern
of occurrence is often variable, with
clustering or sequencing of events
being separated by longer periods of
time with reduced earthquake activity.

Reduction of earthquake hazards

will be a multifaceted program, in-
cluding recognition of active faults
and Earth materials sensitive to
shaking and development of im-
proved ways to predict, control, warn
of and adjust to earthquakes, includ-
ing designing structures to better
withstand shaking. Many communi-
ties in the U.S. and other countries
are developing emergency plans to
respond to a predicted or unexpected
catastrophic earthquake. Seismic
zoning, including microzonation and
other methods of hazard reduction,
are active areas of research. At a per-
sonal level, there are steps an individ-
ual can take before, during, and after
an earthquake to reduce the hazard
and ease recovery.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
Human population growth, espe-
cially in large cities in seismically
active regions, is placing more and
more people and property at risk
from earthquakes.
Sustainability Minimizing the
damages from earthquakes to public
and private property is a component
of sustainable development. The goal
is to produce stable communities that
are less likely to experience cata-
strophic losses as a result of poor
earthquake preparation.
Earth as a System Earthquakes
are produced by Earth’s internal tec-
tonic systems. Landforms, including
ocean basins and mountains, are the
products of continental movement
and resultant earthquakes. Moun-
tains cause changes to atmospheric

processes that create deserts and 
regional patterns of rainfall and,
thus, affect vegetation and erosion.
This is an example of the principle
of environmental unity: One
change, in this case the develop-
ment of mountains, causes a chain
of other events.
Hazardous Earth Processes,
Risk Assessment, and Percep-
tion We cannot control processes that
produce earthquakes, but how we per-
ceive the earthquake hazard greatly in-
ﬂuences the actions we take to mini-
mize the risk of loss of life. If we
perceive earthquakes as a real risk to
our lives and those of our family and
friends, we will take the necessary steps
to prepare for future earthquakes.
Scientific Knowledge and
Values Scientiﬁc knowledge about

earthquakes in terms of how they are
produced, where and why they occur,
and how to design buildings to better
withstand earthquake shaking has
grown dramatically in recent years.
Important lessons were learned from
the 1999 earthquakes in Turkey that
killed about 38,000 people. Turkey
has relatively high building standards,
and more buildings should have sur-
vived the quakes. Some people believe
that improper construction con-
tributed signiﬁcantly to the loss of
buildings. Contractors may have de-
stroyed evidence of inadequate con-
struction after the earthquake oc-
curred. Community values result in
building regulations that help reduce
earthquake losses. If buildings are
properly constructed to withstand
earthquakes, then loss of life may be
greatly reduced in the future.

Critical Thinking Questions
1. Assume that you are working for

the Peace Corps and are in a devel-
oping country where most of the
homes are built out of unrein-
forced blocks or bricks. There has
not been a large damaging earth-
quake in the area for several hun-
dred years, but earlier there were
several earthquakes that killed
thousands of people. How would
you present the earthquake hazard

to the people living where you are
working? What steps might be
taken to reduce the hazard?

2. You live in an area that has a sig-
niﬁcant earthquake hazard. There
is ongoing debate as to whether an
earthquake warning system should
be developed. Some people are
worried that false alarms will cause
a lot of problems, and others point
out that the response time may

not be very long. What are your
views? Do you think it is a respon-
sibility of public ofﬁcials to ﬁnance
an earthquake warning system, as-
suming such a system is feasible?
What are potential implications if
a warning system is not developed,
and a large earthquake results in
damage that could have partially
been avoided with a warning sys-
tem in place?

Tsunami

Learning Objectives
Tsunami,  deﬁned as great sea waves produced by submarine earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or
landslides, have long been known to cause disasters and catastrophes, but, until recently, the hazard
posed by tsunami has been underestimated. For years, scientists attempted to get public ofﬁcials to
expand tsunami warning systems to ocean basins outside of the Paciﬁc Ocean. It took the catastrophic
deaths and devastation of the Indonesian tsunami of 2004 for many governments and communities
to take the tsunami hazard seriously. However, as often occurs after disasters and catastrophes,
translating the increased hazard awareness into improved warning, preparedness, and mitigation is

proceeding at a relatively slow pace. This chapter will examine the natural tsunami process and

assess the hazard that these waves pose to people. Your goals in reading the chapter will be:

• Understand the process

of tsunami formation
and development

• Know what geographic

regions are at risk for
tsunami

• Understand the effects

of tsunami and the
hazards they pose to
coastal regions

• Recognize the linkages
between tsunami and
other natural hazards

• Know what nations,

communities, and
individuals can do to
minimize the tsunami
hazard

Case History
Indonesian Tsunami

Prior to Sunday, 
December 26, 2004,
few people knew
what the Japanese
word tsunami
means. That
changed in the
span of only 
a few hours, 
as close to
250,000 peo-
ple were
killed, many
hundreds of
thousands in-
jured, and mil-
lions were dis-
placed in over
a dozen coun-
tries surround-
ing the 
Indian Ocean.
With no warning
system in place,
residents of
coastal area after
coastal area around
the Indian Ocean
were struck by a 
series of tsunami
waves without 
notice.

The source of this

tsunami was the largest
earthquake on Earth in
the past 4 decades that
struck on the morning 
of December 26, just off the
west coast of the Indonesian is-
land of Sumatra (Figure 7.1). At
a magnitude of about 9.1, this
earthquake caused the most dam-
aging tsunami in recorded history.1
Great earthquakes of this magnitude
occur along tectonic plate boundaries
where one plate is subducted below
another. In this case, the Indian and
Australian plates are being subducted
to the northeast beneath the Burma

microplate. In this earthquake, the
Burma microplate moved about 20 m
(65 ft) to the west–southwest, along a
gently inclined subduction zone
(Figure 7.2).1 Because this was a large
amount of displacement along the
thrust faults in the subduction zone,
geologists classify this earthquake as
a “megathrust event.” Seismic waves
generated by the rupture caused sev-
eral minutes of shaking on nearby is-
lands. The total length of the rupture
along the subduction zone was over
1,500 km (930 mi), about the length
of the state of California.1 Not only
did the seaﬂoor shift about 20 m (65
ft) horizontally, it also rose several
meters vertically.1 Displacement of
the sea bottom disturbed and dis-
placed the overlying waters of the In-

dian Ocean, and a series of tsunami
waves were generated. The effect is
like throwing a large boulder in your
bathtub and watching the rings or
waves of water spread out. In this
case, though, the boulder came up
from the bottom, but the result was
the same and waves radiated outward,
moving at high speed across the Indian
Ocean (Figure 7.3, page 226).

Unlike in the Paciﬁc Ocean, there
was no tsunami warning system for
the Indian Ocean, and people were
mostly caught by surprise. Scientists
on duty at the Paciﬁc Tsunami Warn-
ing Center in Hawaii recognized that
the earthquake could potentially pro-
duce a tsunami, but the geophysical
techniques to calculate the size of
earthquakes of such magnitude were

not immediately available to them.2
Once they determined that a tsunami
was likely, the scientists managed to
contact other scientists in Indonesia
and have the U.S. State Department
relay their concerns to some nations
surrounding the Indian Ocean. Unfor-
tunately, the warnings did not reach
authorities in time to take action, and,
even if they had, there was no system
in place for directly notifying coastal
residents. Had it been possible for
warnings to be received, tens of thou-
sands of lives could have been saved.
This is because the tsunami waves
took several hours to reach some of
the coastlines where people died
(Figure 7.3). Even a warning of a half
hour or so would have been sufﬁcient
to move many people from low-lying
coastal areas.3 The ﬁrst sensor on the
seaﬂoor to detect a tsunami in the In-
dian Ocean was installed in 2006, and
others have followed. Sirens are now
in place in some coastal areas around

the Indian Ocean to warn people when
a tsunami is coming.

quake. Coastal subsidence of a tectonic
plate is common in megathrust events.

Over three-quarters of the deaths
were in Indonesia, which experienced
both the intense shaking from the
earthquake and the inundation by
tsunami waves within less than an
hour. In contrast, the ﬁrst tsunami
wave took about 2 hours to reach Sri
Lanka and India, where many thou-
sands died, and about 7 hours to
reach Somalia on the west coast of
Africa (Figure 7.3). The ﬁrst of many
tsunami waves reached other loca-
tions earlier or later, depending on
their distance from the rupture in the
subduction zone.

At the northern tip of the island of

Sumatra, the Indonesian provincial
capital of Banda Aceh was nearly de-
stroyed (Figure 7.4, page 227). De-
struction was caused by shaking from
the earthquake, the force of the
tsunami waves, and ﬂooding as the
land subsided following the earth-

Tourist areas in the region were

hard hit, especially in Thailand, where
several thousand tourists from Europe,
the United States, and elsewhere were
killed. Most visitors, and many ﬁrst-
generation residents, were unfamiliar
with tsunamis. They did not know how
to recognize that a tsunami was about
to take place or what to do if one oc-
curred. This was true for many people
in Phuket, Thailand (Figure 7.5, page
228). Some people seemed to be mes-
merized by the approaching waves,
while others ran in panic.

On some coastlines, everything
wasn’t quite as bleak. In Thailand, a
10-year-old British girl sounded the
warning in time for 100 people to
evacuate a resort beach. Only a few
weeks before going to Thailand, she
had received a lesson in school about
plate tectonics, earthquakes, and
tsunami. As part of that lesson, she

cation of the lead tsunami wave each hour after the earthquake. Note that the tsunami waves took approximately 7 hours to reach 
Somalia on Africa’s east coast. Most deaths were in Indonesia, where the ﬁrst local tsunami wave arrived an hour or less after the earth-
quake. The number of deaths shown in each country is the total number of people dead or still missing. (Casualties summarized in Telford,
J., and Cosgrave, J. 2006. Joint Evaluation of the International Response to the Indian Ocean Tsunami: Synthesis report. London: Tsunami

learned that, sometimes, the sea re-
cedes prior to the arrival of a tsunami
wave. That is precisely what she ob-
served, and her screaming to get off
the beach eventually convinced her
mother and others to take action.
Thanks to her persistence, the beach
was successfully evacuated. Her
mother later stated that she did not
even know what a tsunami was, but
that her daughter’s school lesson had
saved the day, for them at least.

On another beach in Sri Lanka, a

scientist on vacation witnessed a
small wave rise up and inundate the
hotel swimming pool. In the next 

20 minutes, the sea level dropped by
around 7 m (23 ft). The scientist rec-
ognized these events as a sign that a
big wave was coming and sounded
the alarm. A hotel employee then
used a megaphone to warn people to
get off the beach. Many people had
gone down to the beach out of curios-
ity to see the exposed seaﬂoor.
Shortly thereafter, the sea rose 7 m
(23 ft) above its normal level. Fortu-
nately, most people were either near
hotel stairs or had escaped to higher
ﬂoors. None of the staff or guests
drowned, but several people on the
ground ﬂoor were swept out and sur-

vived only by clinging to palm trees
in the hotel garden.4

In the Andaman and Nicobar Is-

lands in the northeastern Indian
Ocean, as well as in parts of Indonesia,
some native people have a collective
memory of tsunamis. When the
earthquake occurred, they applied
that knowledge and moved to high
ground, saving entire small tribes on
some islands.

In Khao Lak, Thailand, it was ele-
phants, not people, who sounded the
warning and saved lives in the 2004
tsunami.5 The elephants, which nor-
mally give tourists rides, started

earthquake occurred in the subduc-
tion zone over 600 km (370 mi) to the
west. The elephants became agitated
again about 1 hour later. Those ele-
phants that were not taking tourists
for rides broke loose from their strong
chains and headed inland. Other ele-
phants carrying tourists on their
backs ignored their handlers and

climbed a hill behind the resort beach
where about 4,000 people were killed
by the tsunami. When handlers recog-
nized the advancing tsunami, they got
other elephants to lift tourists onto
their backs with their trunks and pro-
ceed inland. The elephants did so,
even though they were only accus-
tomed to people mounting them from
a wooden platform. Tsunami waves

then surged about 1 km (0.5 mi) in-
land. The elephants stopped just 
beyond where the waves ended their
destructive path.

The question is: Did the elephants
know something that people did not?
Animals have sensory ability that dif-
fers from humans. It’s possible the
elephants heard the earthquake be-
cause earthquakes produce sound

Many people living there, as well as the
tourists, did not initially think the wave

thought they would be able to outrun

waves with low tones referred to as
infrasonic sound. Some people can
sense infrasonic sound, but they
don’t generally perceive it as a haz-
ard. The elephants may also have
sensed the motion as the land vi-

brated from the earthquake. In either
case, the elephants ﬂed inland away
from the advancing tsunami. 
Although the link between the 
elephants’ sensory ability and their
behavior is still speculative, the ac-

tions of the elephants nevertheless
saved at least a dozen lives.5

Numerous reports received after

the 2004 Indonesian tsunami indicate
the vital role of education in tsunami
preparedness. Thousands of lives

7.1 Introduction
Tsunami (the  Japanese  word  for  “large  harbor
waves”) are produced by the sudden vertical displace-
ment of ocean water.3 These waves are a serious nat-
ural hazard that can cause a catastrophe thousands
of kilometers from where they originate. They may
be  triggered  by  several  types  of  events,  including  a
large earthquake that causes a rapid uplift or subsi-
dence of the seaﬂoor; an underwater landslide that
may  be  triggered  by  an  earthquake;  the  collapse  of

part of a volcano that slides into the sea; a subma-
rine volcanic explosion; and an impact in the ocean
of  an  extraterrestrial  object,  such  as  an  asteroid  or
impact  can  produce  a  mega-
comet.  Asteroid 
tsunami, a wave that is about 100 times higher than
the largest tsunami produced by an earthquake, and
one that could put hundreds of millions of people at
risk.3 Fortunately, the frequency of very large aster-
oid  impacts  is  very  low.  Of  the  above  potential
causes, tsunami produced by earthquakes are by far
the most common.

would have been saved had more peo-
ple recognized from Earth’s behavior
that a tsunami was likely. People who
felt the large earthquake would have
known that a tsunami might be com-
ing and could have evacuated to higher
ground. Even thousands of miles away,
where the seismic waves are not felt,
there are still signals of what is about
to happen. As the British schoolgirl
knew, if the water suddenly recedes
from the shore and exposes the sea
bottom, you can expect it to come back
as a tsunami wave. This is a signal to
move to higher ground. People should
also be informed that tsunamis are sel-
dom one wave but are, in fact, a series

of waves, with later ones many times
larger and more damaging than earlier
ones. The education of people close 
to where a tsunami may originate is
particularly important, as waves may
arrive 10 to 15 minutes following an
earthquake. Geologists have warned
that it is likely that another large
tsunami will be generated by earth-
quakes offshore of Indonesia in the
next few decades.6,7

Since 2006, an ocean-bottom

tsunami warning system consisting
of sensors that recognize tsunami
waves has been in place in the Indian
Ocean. In addition, much more has
been done to educate people about

the tsunami hazard. A tsunami in
2009, generated by a M 8.1 earth-
quake, struck American Samoa and
other islands in the region (Figure
7.6). The number of lives lost was
about 200, and this was fewer than
might have occurred without the pro-
gram of tsunami awareness and edu-
cation, along with oral history of in-
digenous people. People got the word
out about the tsunami hazard and
what to look for, and that resulted in
evacuations that saved lives. How-
ever, with even more education and
improved warning linked to evacua-
tion processes, more lives could have
been saved.8

Damaging tsunami in historic time have been rel-
atively frequent and mostly in the Paciﬁc Basin. Re-
cent examples include the following:9,10

• The 1755 (~M 9) Lisbon, Portugal earthquake
produced a tsunami that, along with the earth-
quake  and  resulting  ﬁre,  killed  an  estimated
20,000 people. Tsunami waves crossed the At-
lantic  Ocean  and  ampliﬁed  to  heights  of  7  m
(23 ft) or more in the West Indies.9

• The  1883  violent  explosion  of  the  Krakatoa
volcano in the Sundra Strait between Java and

Sumatra caused the top of the volcano to col-
lapse into the ocean. This sudden collapse pro-
duced a giant tsunami over 35 m (116 ft) high
that  destroyed  165  villages  and  killed  more
than 36,000 people.10

• The  1946  (M  8.1)  Aleutians  (Alaska)  earth-
quake produced a tsunami in the Hawaiian Is-
lands that killed about 160 people.

• The 1960 (M 9.5) Chile earthquake triggered
a  tsunami  that  killed  61  people  in  Hawaii
after traveling for 15 hours across the Paciﬁc
Ocean.

230

CHAPTER 7

Tsunami

• The  1964  (M  9.2)  Alaskan  earthquake  gener-
ated  a  deadly  tsunami  that  killed  about  130
people in Alaska and California.

• The  1993  (M  7.8)  earthquake  in  the  Sea  of
Japan caused a tsunami that killed 120 people
on Okushiri Island, Japan.

• The 1998 (M 7.1) Papua New Guinea earthquake
triggered a submarine landslide, which produced
a tsunami that killed more than 2,100 people.

• The 2004 (M 9.1) Sumatran earthquake gener-
ated a tsunami that killed about 230,000 people.
• The  2009  (M  8.1)  Samoan  earthquake  gener-

ated a tsunami that killed about 200 people.

• The 2010 (M 8.8) Chile earthquake that killed
about  600  people  generated  a  tsunami  that
killed about 20 people in coastal towns.

How Can an Earthquake 
Cause a Tsunami?
An earthquake can cause a tsunami by movement of
the seaﬂoor and by triggering a landslide. Seaﬂoor

movement  is  probably  the  more  common  of  these
two mechanisms. This movement occurs when the
seaﬂoor  sits  on  a  block  of  the  Earth’s  crust  that
shifts up or down during a quake. In general, it takes
a M 7.5 or greater earthquake to create enough dis-
placement  of  the  seaﬂoor  to  generate  a  damaging
tsunami.  The  upward  or  downward  movement  of
the seaﬂoor displaces the entire mass of water, from
the  sea  bottom  to  the  ocean  surface.  This  starts  a
four-stage  process  that  eventually  leads  to  landfall
of tsunami waves on the shore (Figure 7.7):

• If  an  earthquake  rupture  uplifts  the  seaﬂoor,
the  water  surface  above  the  uplift  initially
forms an elongate dome parallel to the geologic
fault.  That  dome  collapses  and  generates  a
tsunami wave. Oscillations of the water surface
and, in some cases, aftershocks along the fault
produce additional waves. These waves radiate
outward  like  the  pattern  made  by  a  pebble
thrown into a pond of water.

• In  the  deep  ocean,  the  tsunami  waves  move
very  rapidly  and  are  spaced  long  distances

apart. Their velocity is equal to the square root
of the product of the acceleration of gravity and
the water depth. The acceleration of gravity is
approximately  10  m/sec2,  and  the  average
water  depth  in  the  deep  ocean  is  4,000  m
(13,000 ft). Thus, when we do the math, we see
that, if we take the product of 10 m/sec2 and
4,000 m and then take the square root of that
number,  we  arrive  at  a  velocity  of  200  m/sec.
Converting 200 m/sec to km/hour, we ﬁnd that
tsunamis travel at 720 km (450 mi) per hour,
about the average airspeed for a Boeing 737 jet
airliner!  In  the  deep  ocean,  the  spacing  be-
tween  the  crests  of  tsunami  waves  may  be
more than 100 km (60 mi), and the height of
the  waves  are  generally  less  than  1  m  (3  ft).
Sailors  rarely  notice  a  passing  tsunami  in  the
deep ocean.

• As a tsunami nears land, the water depth de-
creases, so the velocity of the tsunami also de-
creases.  Near  land,  the  forward  speed  of  a
tsunami  may  be  about  45  km  (28  mi)  per
hour—too  fast  to  outrun,  but  not  nearly  as
fast as tsunami waves in the open ocean. This
decrease in velocity also decreases the spacing
between  wave  crests,  that  is,  the  wavelength.
As  the  water  slows  down  and  piles  up,  the
height of the waves increases.

• When the ﬁrst tsunami wave reaches the shore
and moves inland, it may be several meters to
several tens of meters high and destroy nearly
everything in its path. Sometimes, the trough
of the wave may arrive ﬁrst, and this exposes
the seaﬂoor. When tsunamis strike the coast,
they  generally  do  not  come  in  as  a  giant
breaking wave, as you might see on the surf-
ing beaches of the north shore of Oahu or the
California coast. Instead, when the wave arrives,
it is more like a very strong and fast-rising rise
in  sea  level.  On  the  rare  occasions  when
tsunamis do break, they may appear as a vertical
wall  of  turbulent  water.  The  movement  of  a
tsunami inland is called the runup of the wave.
Runup  refers  to  the  furthest  horizontal  and
vertical  distance  that  the  largest  wave  of  a
tsunami moves inland. Once a wave has moved
to its furthest extent inland, most of the water
then returns back to the open ocean in a strong
and  often  turbulent  ﬂow.  A  tsunami  can  also
generate other types of waves, known as edge
waves, that travel back and forth, parallel to the
shore. The interaction between edge waves and

Introduction

231

additional  incoming  tsunami  waves  can  be
complex.  As  result  of  this  interaction,  wave
ampliﬁcation may occur, causing the second or
third tsunami wave to be even larger than the
ﬁrst. Most commonly, a series of tsunami waves
will strike a particular coast over a period of sev-
eral hours.11

When  an  earthquake  uplifts  the  seafloor  close
to  land,  both  distant  and  local  tsunamis  may  be
produced  (Figure  7.8).  The  initial  fault  displace-
ment and uplift lift the water above mean sea level.
This  uplift  creates  potential  energy  that  drives  the
horizontal  movement  of  the  waves.  The  uplifted
dome of water commonly splits into two. One wave,

displacement lifts the water above mean sea level, which
creates potential energy that drives the horizontal propa-
gation of the waves. In these diagrams, wave height is
greatly exaggerated compared to the depth of the water.
Actual height of the waves is at most a meter or so, but it
is spread out to tens or several hundreds of kilometers in
length. (b) The initial wave is split into a tsunami that trav-
els out across the deep ocean (distant tsunami) and an-
other tsunami that travels toward nearby land (local
tsunami). The wave heights are also split, and each (dis-
tant and local) tsunami has a height about one-half the
original wave in (a). (Modiﬁed after U.S. Geological Survey;

CHAPTER 7

Tsunami

known as a distant tsunami, travels out across the
deep ocean at high speed. Distant tsunamis can travel
thousands of kilometers across the ocean to strike re-
mote  shorelines  with  very  little  loss  of  energy.  The
second wave, known as the local tsunami, heads in
the opposite direction toward the nearby land. A local
tsunami can arrive quickly following an earthquake,
giving  coastal  residents  and  visitors  little  warning
time.  When  the  initial  tsunami  wave  is  split,  each
(distant and local) tsunami has a wave height about
one-half of that of the original dome of water.11

An example of a local tsunami comes from the is-
land of Okushiri in western Japan (Figure 7.9). On
July  12,  1993,  a  M  7.8  earthquake  in  the  Sea  of
Japan  produced  a  local  tsunami  that  extensively
damaged Anoae, a small town on the southern tip of
the island. The town was struck several times by 15
to  30  m  (50  to  100  ft)  waves  coming  around  both
sides of the island. There was virtually no warning
because the earthquake epicenter was very close to
the island (Figure 7.9). The huge waves arrived only

2 to 5 minutes after the earthquake, killing 120 peo-
ple and causing $600 million in property damage.12

How Can a Landslide 
Cause a Tsunami?
Although most large tsunami are produced by fault
rupture  along  subduction  zones  at  tectonic  plate
boundaries, landslides have also generated very large
tsunami. These landslides can take place underwater,
where they are referred to as submarine landslides, or
they  can  be  large  rock  avalanches  that  fall  from
mountains into the sea. In most cases, the landslides
are  triggered  by  an  earthquake.  For  example,  in
1998,  a  M  7.1  earthquake  occurred  off  the  north
shore of the island of New Guinea. The earthquake
was felt at Sissano Lagoon, and shortly thereafter a
tsunami arrived with little warning. In less than an
hour,  coastal  villages  were  swept  away,  leaving
12,000  people  homeless  and  more  than  2,000
dead. The tsunami waves, which reached heights of

Trees removed by wave

15  m  (50  ft),  appear  to  have  resulted  primarily
from a submarine landslide triggered by the earth-
quake.13 The epicenter of the earthquake was only
about 50 km (30 mi) offshore, so there was little, if
any, warning time for coastal residents. This event
emphasized  the  potentially  devastating  damage
that can occur from a large tsunami produced by a
nearby  earthquake  and  submarine  landslide.10,13
The  earthquake  itself  would  probably  not  have
generated  a  large  tsunami,  but  it  was  combined
with a landslide that displaced water at the bottom
of the sea.

Perhaps the most famous landslide-induced giant
wave  occurred  at  Lituya  Bay,  Alaska,  in  1958.  The
landslide was set in motion by a M 7.7 earthquake on
a  nearby  fault.  Approximately  30.5  million  m3 of
rock fell from a cliff into the bay, instantly displacing
a  huge  volume  of  seawater.9 That  volume  of  Earth
material would ﬁll the National Mall in Washington,
DC, to a height of about 25 m (80 ft) (the height of
the Hirshhorn Museum on the Mall). The huge mass
of broken rock caused waters in the bay to surge up-
ward to an elevation of about 524 m (1,720 ft) above
the  normal  water  level.9 This  splash  of  water 
was so tall that it would have washed over the Sears
Tower  in  Chicago  with  82  m  (270  ft)  to  spare!  Al-
though the wave that swept out of the bay into the
ocean wasn’t nearly as large, it did pick up a ﬁshing
boat  with  two  people  onboard.  The  boat’s  captain
estimated that the tsunami wave was 30 m (100 ft)
high when it lifted the boat over the sand spit at the
mouth of the bay. Two other ﬁshing boats in the bay

disappeared  after  being  caught  in  the  wave.14 A
panoramic view of the bay taken a few days after the
tsunami  shows  that  the  erosive  force  of  the  wave
stripped the shoreline bare of trees (Figure 7.10). In
the area beyond the direct splash effect of the fallen
rock, the high water line above the barren shoreline
indicates that the local tsunami had a runup height
of 20 to 70 m (65 to 230 ft).9

7.2 Regions at Risk
Although all ocean and some lake shorelines are at
risk for tsunamis, some coasts are more at risk than
others.  The  heightened  risk  comes  from  the  geo-
graphic  location  of  a  coast  in  relation  to  potential
tsunami  sources,  such  as  earthquakes,  landslides,
and volcanoes. Coasts in proximity to a major sub-
duction  zone,  or  directly  across  the  ocean  basin
from a major subduction zone, are at greatest risk. A
major subduction zone is considered one that is ca-
pable of periodically generating a great earthquake
of M 9 or greater. Ruptures produced by these great
earthquakes  may  extend  for  1000  km  (625  mi)  or
more along the subduction zone and produce signif-
icant  uplift  of  the  seaﬂoor.  The  greatest  tsunami
hazard,  with  return  periods  of  several  hundred
years, is adjacent to those major subduction zones
with  a  convergence  of  a  few  centimeters  per  year.
These include the Cascadia subduction zone in the
Paciﬁc  Northwest,  the  Chilean  trench  along  south-
western South America, and the subduction zones off
the coast of Japan.15

CHAPTER 7

Tsunami

Tsunami can range in height from a few centime-
ters  to  30  m  (100  ft)  or  more.  Those  that  have  a
runup height of at least 5 m (16 ft) are considered
signiﬁcant tsunamis and are commonly produced by
high-magnitude earthquakes and associated subma-
rine  slides.  A  recent  assessment  of  global  tsunami
hazard ranks the hazard from relatively low to great-
est  based  upon  the  return  period  of  a  signiﬁcant
tsunami (at least 5 m runup) (Figure 7.11). Keep in
mind  that  this  map  is  highly  generalized  because
runup  from  tsunami  varies  considerably  with  the
shape of the seaﬂoor immediately offshore and with
the type of topography and vegetation landward of
the beach. Both the offshore and shoreline topogra-
phy  can  greatly  accentuate  tsunami  wave  height.
Also,  not  enough  is  known  about  global  seismicity
to accurately predict return periods of earthquakes
with  M  9  or  above—those  quakes  that  are  most
likely to produce a signiﬁcant tsunami. Examination
of the map reveals that most zones of greatest haz-
ard surround the Paciﬁc Ocean. This is no surprise,
given that most of the major subduction zones are
found on the margins of the Paciﬁc. Other regions
judged to have the greatest hazard are parts of the
Mediterranean, as well as the northeastern side of

the  Indian  Ocean.  The  good  news  about  the  risk
from signiﬁcant tsunami is that almost all of them
will cause only substantial damage within a couple
hundred kilometers from their source. However, the
very largest subduction zone earthquakes may cause
substantial damage several thousands of kilometers
from  the  source.  That  certainly  was  the  case  with
the 2004 Indonesian tsunami that raced across the
Indian Ocean, causing death and destruction as far
away as the east coast of Africa. However, most of
the death and destruction were much closer to the
earthquake epicenter (Figure 7.3).

An interesting example of damage from a distant
earthquake comes from 3 centuries ago. In the year
1700,  a  tsunami  generated  by  an  estimated  M  9
earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone reached
the  shores  of  Japan  approximately  12  hours  later
(Figure 7.12). You might wonder how we are able to
determine the magnitude of the earthquake and de-
termine that it created a tsunami in Japan. This dis-
covery started with geologic investigations in North
America  that  found  logs  and  soil  that  were  buried
below a tsunami deposit sometime after 1660. The
logs and other plant material in the soil were radio-
carbon dated to determine the time that they were

time of arrival of the tsunami in Japan, sci-
entists have inferred that the tsunami origi-
nated at the Cascadia subduction zone about
9:00 P.M. PST on January 26, 1700.16

7.3 Effects of Tsunamis 

and Linkages to Other
Natural Hazards

The  effects  of  tsunami  are  both  primary
and  secondary.  Primary  effects  are  related
to the inundation of the water and resulting
ﬂooding  and  erosion.  Virtually  nothing 
can stand in the path of a truly high-magni-
tude tsunami. The wave energy is sufﬁcient
to tear up beaches and most coastal vegeta-
tion,  as  well  as  homes  and  buildings  in  its
path.  These  effects  diminish  with  distance
from the coast. Much of the damage to both
the  landscape  and  human  structures  re-
sults  from  the  tremendous  amount  of  de-
bris carried by the water as it moves inland
and  then  back  again  to  the  ocean.  What  is
left behind is often bare, eroded ground and
areas  covered  with  all  sorts  of  human  and
natural debris (Figure 7.13).

Secondary effects of tsunami occur in the
minutes,  hours,  days,  and  weeks  following
the event. Immediately following a tsunami,
ﬁres may start in urban areas from ruptured
natural  gas  lines  or  from  the  ignition  of
ﬂammable  chemicals  that  were  released
from  damaged  tanks.  Water  supplies  may
become polluted from ﬂoodwaters, damaged
wastewater  treatment  systems,  and  rotting
animal  carcasses  and  plants.  Disease  out-
breaks  may  occur,  as  people  surviving  the
tsunami come in contact with polluted water
and  soil.  In  the  2004  Indonesian  tsunami,
public  health  ofﬁcials  were  initially  con-
cerned that there would be outbreaks of waterborne
illnesses, such as malaria and cholera. Fortunately,
this  did  not  become  a  serious  problem  because  of
the quick action of relief agencies and the destruc-
tion  of  mosquito  breeding  grounds  by  saltwater

FIGURE 7.12 Tsunami of 1700 This output from a computer model

Japan. The maps show wave height and location 1 hour, 6 hours, and

zone. Such an earthquake would produce a fault displacement of around

flooding. What did occur is a pneumonia-like dis-
ease known as “tsunami lung,” a condition that de-
veloped in people who inhaled bacteria in muddy
saltwater.  Because  the  disease  was  not  initially
recognized and there were few antibiotics or med-
ical personnel available for treatment, many of the
patients  developed  advanced  lung  infections  that
resulted in paralysis. Fortunately, treatment with
antibiotics eventually brought the infections under
control.19

There are several linkages between tsunami and
other natural hazards. Tsunami are obviously closely

linked to submarine and coastal earthquakes and
landslides,  as  well  as  island  volcanic  explosions
and oceanic impacts of asteroids and comets. For
earthquake-generated  tsunamis,  coastal  commu-
nities near the epicenter experience casualties and
property damage from both the ground shaking of
the  earthquake  and  inundation  by  the  tsunami.
Powerful  tsunami  waves  interact  with  coastal
processes to change the coastline through erosion
and  deposition  of  sediment.  There  was  dramatic
evidence  of  this  interaction  following  the  2004
tsunami  in  the  area  near  Banda  Aceh,  Indonesia
(Figure  7.4).  A  combination  of  erosion  caused 
by  the  tsunami  and  subsidence  caused  by  the
earthquake  has  altered  the  coastal  area  to  the
point that it scarcely resembles what it was prior
to the event.

7.4 Minimizing the 
Tsunami Hazard

The magnitude and frequency of tsunami are not in
any way tied to human activity. As with hurricanes,
people  who  move  to  coasts  that  have  an  elevated
risk for tsunami are increasing the likelihood that
they  will  be  affected  by  this  natural  process.  The
rapid  development  of  coastal  areas  in  recent
decades  for  a  variety  of  land  uses,  along  with  in-
crease  in  human  population  of  coastal  cities  in
many  regions,  has  increased  the  hazard.  Seattle,
Washington, with a signiﬁcant tsunami hazard, had
a  population  of  about  43,000  in  1890.  Today,  the
metropolitan  area  has  a  population  of  nearly  100
times that (over 4 million).

There are some lessons to be learned from past
tsunami that can be applied to reduce the damage
from  future  events.  For  example,  we  can  plant
buffer zones of trees along a coast that will absorb
some of the impact of incoming tsunami waves. We
might also consider the strength of our buildings to
withstand the onslaught of moderate tsunamis and
move  other  structures  inland  where  they  are  less
likely  to  be  damaged.  Loss  of  life  is  reduced  by
warning and evacuation.

A number of strategies are available for minimiz-

ing the tsunami hazard, including the following:

• Detection and warning
• Structural control

• Construction of tsunami runup maps
• Land-use planning
• Probability analysis
• Education
• Tsunami-ready status

Detection and Warning
Since  nearly  all  large  tsunami  are  associated  with
giant earthquakes, our ﬁrst warning comes from an
earthquake in an offshore area that is large enough
to produce a tsunami. For distant tsunami, we have
the capability to detect them in the open ocean and
accurately  estimate  their  arrival  time  to  within  a
few  minutes.  This  information  has  been  used  to
create a successful tsunami warning system in the
Paciﬁc Ocean.

A  tsunami  warning  system  has  three  compo-
nents: a network of seismographs to accurately lo-
cate  and  determine  the  depth  and  magnitude  of
submarine and coastal earthquakes, automated tidal
gauges  to  measure  unusual  rises  and  falls  of  sea
level, and a network of sensors connected to ﬂoating
buoys  (Figure  7.14).  Surface  buoys  with  a  bottom
sensor, known as a tsunameter, detect small changes
in the pressure exerted by the increased volume of
water as a tsunami passes overhead (Figure 7.14a).
This information is relayed by satellite to a warning
center and is combined with tidal gauge information
to  predict  tsunami  arrival  times.  For  example,  an
underwater  earthquake  in  Hawaii  could  produce  a
tsunami that would radiate outward across the en-
tire  Paciﬁc  Ocean  and  arrive  at  different  times  in
California,  Alaska,  Japan,  and  Papua  New  Guinea
(Figure  7.14b).  Following  the  Indonesian  tsunami,
similar systems are being created in the Indian and
Atlantic  Oceans,  including  warning  sensors  for
Puerto Rico and the east coast of the United States
and Canada.

For a local tsunami that strikes land very close to
the source of the earthquake, there may be very lit-
tle warning time. People close to the source, though,
will  probably  feel  the  earthquake  and  can  immedi-
ately  move  inland  to  higher  ground.  Certainly,  the
water receding is a sign to run inland. Some coastal
communities  in  Hawaii,  Alaska,  the  Paciﬁc  North-
west,  British  Columbia,  Japan,  and  elsewhere  also
have warning sirens to alert people that a tsunami
may soon arrive.

Minimizing the Tsunami Hazard

237

Structural Control
Tsunami that are even 1 or 2 m high have such power
that many houses and small buildings are unable to
withstand their impact.9 However, building designs
for  larger  structures,  such  as  high-rise  hotels  and
critical facilities, can be engineered in such a way as
to greatly reduce or minimize the destructive effects
of  a  tsunami.  For  example,  the  city  of  Honolulu,
Hawaii, has special requirements for construction of
buildings in areas with a tsunami hazard. However,
for  most  hazard  areas,  the  current  building  codes
and guidelines do not adequately address the effect
of a tsunami on buildings and other structures.20

Tsunami Runup Maps
Following a tsunami, it is a fairly straightforward pro-
cedure to produce a tsunami runup map that shows
the  level  to  which  the  water  traveled  inland.  Such  a
map was created for the island of Oahu, Hawaii, fol-
lowing  the  1946  tsunami  that  originated  from  an
earthquake in Alaska’s Aleutian Islands (Figure 7.15,
page 239). That map illustrates the tremendous vari-
ability  of  runup  height  from  a  typical  tsunami.  The
runup  from  the  1946  tsunami  varied  from  about
0.6 m (2 ft) in Honolulu to 11 m (36 ft) at Kena Point
and Makapuu Point on opposite ends of the island.

Before a tsunami strikes, a community can pro-
duce a hazard map that shows the area that is likely
to  be  inundated  by  a  given  height.  Huntington
Beach,  California,  one  of  a  number  of  American
and Canadian communities that have a signiﬁcant
tsunami  hazard,  has  prepared  such  a  map 
(Figure 7.16, page 240). Although the probability of
a  large  tsunami  in  southern  California  is  relatively
low, the consequences of such an event could be cata-
strophic. For example, the entire city of Huntington
Beach  has  an  elevation  of  less  than  33  m  (100  ft),
and three-quarters of the city is less than 8 m (25 ft)
above sea level. Huntington Beach itself faces to the
southwest  and,  as  such,  is  vulnerable  to  a  tsunami
from either the south or west. Such an event, for ex-
ample,  might  originate  in  Alaska,  Japan,  or  the
South Paciﬁc. The beach attracts up to 100,000 peo-
ple or more each day during the summer, and the city
is giving serious consideration to the possibility of a
tsunami. Many other cities and areas have produced
tsunami runup maps, and this trend will undoubt-
edly continue in the future.

Land Use Planning
In  the  aftermath  of  the  2004  Indonesian  tsunami,
scientists  discovered  that  tropical  ecology  played  a
role  in  determining  tsunami  damage.  Where  the
largest waves struck the shore, there was inevitably
massive destruction (Figure 7.17, page 241). In other
areas, the damage was not uniform. Some coastal vil-
lages were destroyed, while others were less damaged.
Those  villages  that  were  spared  destruction  were
partly protected from the energy of the tsunami by
either  a  coastal  mangrove  forest  or  several  rows  of
plantation trees that reduced the velocity of incoming
water.21 Coastal land use and land cover studies have
documented the advantage of locating villages inland
behind a coastal forest (Figure 7.18, page 242). It has

been  suggested  that,  where  the  forest  grows  natu-
rally, there may be places somewhat protected from
wave attack by the near-shore and land topography.
Thus,  development  in  areas  with  a  tsunami  hazard
might look to land use planning that includes identi-
fying where serious tsunami damage has occurred in
the  past  and  avoiding  the  most  hazardous  places.
That is an example of using the principle of unifor-
mitarianism discussed in Chapter 1.

With rapid coastal development for a variety of
purposes,  including  tourism,  coastal  mangroves
are  often  removed  and  replaced  by  homes,  high-
rise  hotels,  and  other  buildings.  These  structures
are often located very close to the beach and, thus,
are vulnerable to tsunami attack. While it may not

be practical to move tourist areas inland, planting
or retaining native vegetation could provide a par-
tial  buffer  from  a  small  to  moderate  tsunami  at-
tack. However, large tsunami waves can erode large
trees from the soil, and their trunks and branches
can then move inland with the water, producing a
serious hazard to people and structures. The best
and safest approach to lessen the tsunami hazard
is quick evacuation.

Probability Analysis
The risk of a particular event may be deﬁned as the
product  of  the  probability  of  that  event  occurring
and the consequences, should it occur. Thus, deter-
mining the likelihood or probability of a tsunami is
an important component in analyzing the potential

hazard.  For  the  most  part,  the  hazard  analysis  for
tsunami has relied upon evidence from past tsunami
to determine the hazard rather than attempt to cal-
culate the probability of a future tsunami. The more
deterministic  approach  is  simply  to  derive  tsunami
inundation maps, such as that shown in Figure 7.16
and use the maps to help develop evacuation routes.
In contrast, analysis of the probability of a tsunami
hazard provides information not only on the likeli-
hood  of  the  event,  but  also  other  aspects  as  well,
such  as  location  of  the  event,  the  extent  of  the
runup, and the possible severity of damage. The ap-
proach taken in developing a probabilistic analysis of
the tsunami hazard is to:

• Identify  and  specify  the  potential  earthquake

sources and their associated uncertainties.

• Specify relationships that will either attenuate
or  reduce  tsunami  waves  as  they  travel  from
the source area.

• Apply  probabilistic  analysis  to  the  tsunami
hazard similar to what is currently being done
for  earthquake  hazard  analysis.  However,
with tsunamis, the analysis must consider the
fact that tsunami can originate from multiple
sources, including ones that are far away from
the location where the hazard is present.

This probabilistic approach to tsunami hazard as-
sessment  is  still  being  developed.  One  difﬁculty  is
that  tsunami  at  a  particular  location  are  generally
rare events. If there was not sufﬁcient activity in the
past to develop the probability of future events, the
analysis depends upon a statistical technique known
as Monte Carlo simulation. This technique has been
used  to  simulate  the  behavior  of  earthquakes  and
tsunami.  The  overall  objective  is  to  determine
tsunami  return  periods  and  probabilities  for  both

distant  and  local  sources.  To  apply  this  technique,
the Monte Carlo simulation selects a random sam-
ple of earthquakes of various magnitudes and deter-
mines the tsunami that would be propagated from
these quakes. Using these tsunami, a mathematical
model is then constructed to estimate the tsunami
amplitude  or  runup  along  a  particular  coast.  This
must  be  done  for  each  of  the  potential  seismic
sources for that particular coastline.22

Education
Education concerning the tsunami hazard is critical
to  minimizing  risk.  This  was  shown  dramatically
during the 2004 Indonesian tsunami, when numer-
ous lives were saved because people recognized that
the receding seawater was a warning sign of an im-
pending  tsunami.  Likewise,  it  is  important  to  edu-
cate coastal residents and visitors as to the difference
between  a  tsunami  watch,  which  is  a  notiﬁcation
that an earthquake that can cause a tsunami has oc-
curred,  and  an  actual  tsunami  warning that  a
tsunami  has  been  detected  and  is  spreading  across
the ocean toward their area. For a distant tsunami,
there will likely be several hours before the waves ar-
rive  after  a  warning  has  been  issued.  In  a  local
tsunami, there may be very little warning time, and,
so, more attention must be given to nature’s warning
systems, such as earthquake shaking or the water re-
ceding from a shoreline. People must also be taught
that tsunami come in a series of waves, and that the
second and third waves may be larger than the ﬁrst
one. Finally, people must be told that the water re-
turning to the ocean once a wave has runup is just as
dangerous as the incoming water.

Tsunami Ready Status
In  order  for  a  community  to  be  prepared,  or
tsunami ready, it must:

• Establish an emergency operation center with

24-hour capability

• Have ways to receive tsunami warnings from the
National  Weather  Service,  Canadian  Meteoro-
logical Centre, Coast Guard, or other agencies

These  guidelines  for  tsunami-readiness  status 
are  being  applied  to  a  number  of  communities  in
California and other areas. For example, the Univer-
sity  of  California,  Santa  Barbara,  and  the  city  of
Huntington Beach, California (Figure 7.16), have been
certiﬁed as tsunami ready.

Perception and Personal Adjustment to Tsunami Hazard

243

The  educational  component  is  of  particular  im-
portance. Most people don’t even know if a tsunami
watch  or  warning  is  issued.  For  example,  in  2005,
there  was  an  earthquake  in  the  Paciﬁc,  far  away
from the city of Santa Barbara. As it turned out, a
tsunami did not occur, but a tsunami watch was is-
sued up and down the California coastline. Nothing
was said about the size of the possible tsunami, and,
so, some people, on hearing the notice, drove to the
top  of  a  nearby  mountain  pass  thousands  of  feet
above  sea  level.  Those  locations  were  great  for
views,  but  people  certainly  did  not  need  to  drive
that far or that high to evacuate the potential dan-
ger zone. There was no plan in place to directly ob-
serve  the  tsunami,  and  the  news  media  reported
that  some  people  perched  on  a  sea  cliff  at  night,
while  others  climbed  palm  trees  to  see  if  the  wave
was coming. This experience in Santa Barbara, and
other West Coast communities, suggests that even
many  “tsunami  ready”  communities  are  not  ade-
quately  prepared  for  the  tsunami  that  will  eventu-
ally strike their coasts.

7.5 Perception and Personal
Adjustment to Tsunami
Hazard

The above discussion suggests that many people do
not  know  the  signs  of  an  approaching  tsunami  or
what to do if a watch or warning is issued. From a

personal perspective, if a warning is issued, people
can take the following actions:

• While all earthquakes do not cause a tsunami,
they might. If you feel a strong earthquake and
are at the beach, leave the beach and low-lying
coastal area immediately.

• If  the  trough  of  a  tsunami  wave  arrives  ﬁrst,
the  ocean  will  recede.  This  is  one  of  nature’s
warning  signs  that  a  wave  is  on  the  way  and
that you should run from the beach.

• Although a tsunami may be relatively small at

one location, it may be much larger nearby.

• Tsunami generally consist of a series of waves,
and there can be up to an hour between waves.
Therefore, stay out of dangerous areas until a
notice  that  all  is  clear  is  given  by  the  proper 
authorities.

• Coastal  communities,  as  they  gain  tsunami-
readiness  status,  will  have  warning  sirens;  if
you hear a siren, move away from the beach to
higher ground (at least 20 m [60 ft] above sea
level) and listen for emergency information.

• If you are aware that a tsunami watch or warn-
ing  has  been  issued,  do  not  go  down  to  the
beach to watch the tsunami. If you can actually
see the wave, you are probably too close to es-
cape.  These  waves  look  very  small  out  at  sea
because of the vast distance to the horizon. Re-
member that these waves move fast and can be
deadly.  A  2  m  (6  ft)  tall  person  is  very  small
compared  to  a  15  m  (50  ft)  tsunami  wave
(Figure 7.19).

Making The   Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About the 2004 Indonesian Tsunami 
to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. What is the role of human popu-
lation increase in impacting the
Indonesian tsunami of 2004?
2. Why do you think that prior to
the 2004 Indonesian tsunami,
there was no warning system in
the Indian Ocean? Was this a
function of science or values?
3. Considering the very many is-
lands in the Paciﬁc and Indian
Oceans, what do you think is nec-
essary to reduce the potential
tsunami hazard? In fact, is such

reduction in many areas practical
and cost-effective?

4. Sustainability is all about trying
to ensure that future generations
have fair access to the resources
that Earth has to offer. Do you
think that there is any strong link
between sustainability and a
tsunami? In other words, are
coastlines sustainable with or
without reducing the hazard of
tsunami to coastal cities, tourist
areas, and other areas of interest?

Summary

The 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean
that claimed about 250,000 lives was
an international wake-up call that we
are not yet prepared for the tsunami
hazard. Of primary importance is to
ensure that we have a tsunami warn-
ing system available in the world’s
major ocean basins. This warning sys-
tem must be designed to reach both
coastal residents and visitors. The sys-
tem must be coupled with an effective
education program, so that people are
more aware of the hazard.

A tsunami is produced by the sud-

den vertical displacement of ocean
water. Several possible processes can
produce tsunami, including underwater
landslides, submarine volcanic explo-
sions, and impact of extraterrestrial
objects. However, the major source of
large damaging tsunami over the past
few millennia has been giant earth-
quakes associated with the major sub-
duction zones on Earth. These tsunami
have formed where geologic faulting
ruptures the seaﬂoor and displaces the
overlying water. When this happens,

both a distant and local tsunami may
be produced. Distant tsunami can
travel thousands of kilometers across
the ocean to strike a remote shoreline.
On the other hand, a local tsunami
heads toward a nearby coast and can
strike with little advance warning.

Effects of a tsunami are both pri-
mary and secondary. The primary ef-
fects are related to the powerful water
from the tsunami runup that results
in ﬂooding and erosion. Virtually
nothing can stand in the path of a
high-magnitude tsunami. In 2004 in
Indonesia, huge concrete barriers
were moved by the force of the waves.
Secondary effects of a tsunami in-
clude a potential for water pollution,
ﬁres in urban areas, and disease to
people surviving the event.

Tsunami are linked to other natural

hazards. For example, they are obvi-
ously tightly linked to the earthquakes
that cause them, and, thus, their ef-
fects are often combined with the
ground shaking, ﬁres, and subsidence
associated with the quakes. Tsunami

waves also interact with coastal
processes to change the coast line
through erosion and deposition of sed-
iment. Following an earthquake and
tsunami, a coastal area may scarcely re-
semble what it was prior to the event.
A number of strategies are avail-
able to minimize the tsunami haz-
ard. These include detection and
warning, structural control, con-
struction of tsunami runup maps,
land use practices, probability analy-
sis, education, and achieving
tsunami-ready status. Of these, the
detection and warning system is of
paramount importance. For distant
tsunami, we have the capability to
detect them in open ocean and accu-
rately estimate their arrival time to
within a few minutes. For local
tsunami, it is more difficult to pro-
vide adequate warning, as tsunami
wave formation quickly follows an
earthquake or earthquake-produced
landslide. In this case, warning
sirens can alert people that a
tsunami may soon arrive.

Key Terms

245

Without adequate education,

watches and warnings are often inef-
fective because many people do not
know how to recognize a tsunami or
take appropriate action to save
themselves and others. Through edu-
cation, people can learn the natural
warning signs of an approaching
tsunami. This may include the earth-
quake shaking itself and withdrawal of

seawater prior to arrival of the large
wave. People must understand that
tsunami come in a series of waves, and
that the second or third wave may be
the largest. In addition, the water re-
turning to the ocean following tsunami
inundation can cause as much damage
as the runup of the incoming waves.
Along coasts with great or signiﬁ-
cant tsunami hazard, most commu-

nities have not adequately prepared
for this underestimated natural haz-
ard. Adequate preparation includes
improved perception of the hazard,
development of ways to alert the
public, preparation and implementa-
tion of a tsunami preparedness plan,
and promotion of community aware-
ness and education concerning the
hazard.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
Some of the fastest-growing cities and
tourist areas on Earth are in the
coastal zone. Often, these areas face a
tsunami hazard. As human popula-
tion continues to grow and more peo-
ple move to coastal areas, it seems in-
evitable that the amount of damage
done by a tsunami will increase.

occurred often involve the study of
sediment that has been deposited by
a tsunami and linking this sediment
to a chronology to understand how
often these events have happened in
the past. Thus, the tsunami record is
part of Earth System Science, which
has the objective of understanding
Earth processes on a time scale of
importance to people.

Scientific Knowledge 
and Values Scientiﬁc studies of
tsunami have advanced to the point
that we understand what cause
tsunami, at least those generated by
earthquakes and landslides. Values
enter into the tsunami story in terms
of how we spend limited resources to
provide better warning of tsunami
and how warnings are provided to
people living in coastal areas. It is not
uncommon on the western coast of
the United States in Oregon and the
Hawaiian islands to have a system of
sirens that warn people in the
coastal zone if a tsunami warning is
issued. The purpose is to advise peo-
ple to evacuate low-lying areas. Ex-
pansion of tsunami warning sirens
and other methods of alerting peo-
ple to the tsunami hazard are depen-
dent upon expenditure of sufficient
funds to meet those objectives. Our
willingness to spend this money in
more areas will be a function of our
value system, particularly in areas 
of the world where local funds may
not be sufficient to provide a warn-
ing system.

Hazardous Earth Processes,
Risk Assessment, and 
Perception Tsunami have the po-
tential to produce catastrophes and
cause extensive damage to property
and loss of life. Risk assessment is
fairly straightforward and involves the
identiﬁcation of the probability of a
tsunami occurring in a particular area
times the consequences when such an
event actually occurs. Minimization of
the risk of a tsunami is based primar-
ily on warning systems that a tsunami
is likely to strike a particular coast at a
speciﬁc time and evacuation. A variety
of land use choices are available that
can help minimize damages to human
systems, such as buildings.

Sustainability Tsunami are nat-
ural processes that have affected
coastlines throughout geologic his-
tory. Sustaining coastlines in natural
areas is fairly straightforward, but
provisions in areas with a tsunami
hazard should include warning sys-
tems so that people living in the
coastal zone may evacuate prior to ar-
rival of tsunami waves.

Earth as a System Tsunami are
related to Earth systems in a variety
of complex ways. First, tsunami in-
undate the land with seawater, sedi-
ment, and debris, and, so, tsunami
deposits may be incorporated within
the rock record. Investigations of
areas where periodic tsunami have

Volcanic Activity

Learning Objectives
There are about 1,500 active volcanoes on Earth, almost 400 of which have erupted in the twentieth
century. Volcanoes occur on all seven continents, as well as in the middle of the ocean. When

human beings live in the path of an active volcano, the results can be devastating. In this chapter,

we focus on the following learning objectives:

• Know the major types of

volcanoes, the rocks
they produce, and their
plate tectonic setting
• Understand the main

types and effects of
volcanic activity,

including lava ﬂows,
pyroclastic activity,
debris ﬂows, and
mudﬂows

• Understand the methods

of studying volcanic
activity, including

seismic activity,
topographic change,
emission of gases, and
geologic history, in order
to better predict volcanic
eruptions and minimize
the hazards

Case History
Mt. Unzen, 1991

Japan has 19 active
volcanoes distrib-
uted throughout
most of the coun-
try’s landmass.
Nearly 200 years
ago, Mt. Unzen 
in southwestern
Japan erupted 
and killed
approximately
15,000 people.

After this eruption,

the volcano lay dor-

mant for 200 years.

Then, on June 3, 1991, 
Mt. Unzen erupted 
violently. Authorities 
ordered the evacuation 
of thousands 
of people. By
the end of
1993, lava had
erupted, and
several thou-
sand ﬂows of
hot ash had 
occurred (Figure
8.1). In fact, Mt.
Unzen has the dubi-

ous honor of

being one of
the ash ﬂow
centers of the
world. This vol-
cano has provided

8.1 Introduction to Volcanic

Hazards

Worldwide, 50 to 60 volcanoes erupt each year. The
United  States  experiences  eruptions  two  or  three
times  a  year,  with  most  of  them  occurring  in
Alaska.1 Eruptions  often  occur  in  sparsely  popu-
lated areas of the world, causing little or no loss of
life or economic damage. However, when a volcano

erupts near a densely populated area, the effects can
be catastrophic.3 Several hundred million people on
Earth  live  close  to  volcanoes,  and,  as  the  human
population grows, more and more people are living
on the ﬂanks, or sides, of active or potentially active
volcanoes. In the past century, almost 100,000 peo-
ple  have  been  killed  by  volcanic  eruptions;  nearly
23,000  lives  were  lost  in  the  last  two  decades  of
the  twentieth  century  alone.1,3 Densely  populated

scientists with a natural laboratory
for studying such ﬂows.1,2 The 1991
eruption also produced damaging
mudﬂows. A specially designed channel
was constructed to contain the mud-
ﬂows, but, as seen in Figure 8.2, the
ﬂows overran the channel, burying
many homes in mud.

Harry Glicken was one of the 
44 people killed when Mt. Unzen
erupted. Harry was a brave and dedi-
cated young scientist who, through
good fortune, had escaped death in
the May 18, 1980, eruption of
Mount St. Helens. Harry’s death re-
minds us that being a volcanologist

is a hazardous career path. They
often risk their lives to better under-
stand volcanoes and save the lives of
people living nearby. This chapter on
volcanic processes is dedicated to
Harry, who loved volcanoes and who
was my friend.

Look: How Magma Forms). Magma that has emerged
from a volcano onto Earth’s surface is called lava. Ap-
proximately  two-thirds  of  all  active  volcanoes  on
Earth  are  located  in  the  “ring  of  ﬁre”  that  circum-
scribes the Paciﬁc Ocean, an area corresponding to
subduction zones on the border of the Paciﬁc plate
(Figure 8.4, page 256).

8.3 Volcano Types
Each type of volcano has a characteristic style of ac-
tivity  that  is  partly  a  result  of  the  viscosity  of  the
magma.  Viscosity describes  a  liquid’s  resistance  to
ﬂow,  with  a  high  viscosity  indicating  a  high  resis-
tance  to  ﬂow.  For  example,  honey  is  more  viscous

How Magma Forms

With the exception of the outer core
deep within Earth’s interior, the plan-
et is almost completely composed of
solid rock (see Sections 2.1 and 2.2).
So where does the magma that
forms volcanoes at the surface come
from?

Most magmas come from the as-
thenosphere, the weak layer that un-
derlies the lithospheric plates (see
Section 2.1). The asthenosphere is
weak and able to ﬂow, allowing rigid
plates of lithosphere to move around
the globe; although the astheno-
sphere is not actually molten, it is
close to the temperature at which it
would melt. As a result, the astheno-
sphere is more prone to melting than
are the overlying lithosphere and the
lower mantle.5 Two important ways
in which silicate rocks of the as-
thenosphere melt include decom-
pression and the addition of volatiles
(especially water). These processes
are closely tied to plate tectonic
processes:
1. Decompression melting occurs
when the overlying pressure ex-
erted on hot rock within the as-

thenosphere is decreased. The
melting temperature for mantle
silicate rocks at Earth’s surface is
approximately 1,200° C (2,200° F).4
Within the mantle, this tempera-
ture is exceeded within the upper
100 km (62 mi) of Earth.5 As with
temperature, pressure increases
with depth, and the great pressure
generated by the weight of overly-
ing rock keeps Earth’s mantle in a
solid state far above the surface
melting temperature of the rock.
However, if the pressure is re-
leased without a change in tem-
perature, the rocks will melt. De-
compression melting happens at
divergent plate boundaries, conti-
nental rifts, and hot spots. At di-
vergent plate boundaries and con-
tinental rifts, the lithosphere is
stretched and thinned. This thin-
ning causes the mantle to upwell
toward the surface and lowers the
pressure (because there is less
overlying rock). With lower pres-
sure and high temperature, de-
compression melting occurs
(Figure 8.Aa).

2. Addition of volatiles lowers the
melting temperature of rocks by
helping to break chemical bonds
within silicate minerals. Conse-
quently, rocks that are close to
their melting temperature will
melt in the presence of added
volatiles. Volatiles are chemical
compounds, such as water (H2O)
and carbon dioxide (CO2), that
evaporate easily and exist in a
gaseous state at Earth’s surface.
Such volatiles are often incorpo-
rated into minerals formed on the
seaﬂoor or within the oceanic
lithosphere and are released when
oceanic plates are subducted. The
released volatiles rise upward
from the subducting slab and in-
teract with the formerly dry as-
thenosphere and induce melting
and volcanism at Earth’s surface
(Figure 8.Ab).5 Subduction zone
volcanism results in most of the
on-land volcanoes around the
world and is exempliﬁed by the
“ring of ﬁre” that surrounds the Pa-
ciﬁc plate (see Figure 8.4).

than water. Magma viscosity is determined by both
its silica (SiO2) content, which can vary from about
50  to  70  percent,  and  its  temperature.  The  higher
the silica content of a magma, the more viscous it is.
Also, the hotter the magma is, the less viscous it is.
The effect of temperature may make sense to you if
you think about honey again. If you keep honey in
the refrigerator, it becomes very difﬁcult to pour or
squeeze out of its container. However, if it is stored
in a cabinet or heated slightly before serving, it ﬂows
much  more  readily.  Highly  viscous  magmas  often
erupt explosively, whereas less viscous magmas tend

to ﬂow. Table 8.2 (page 256) lists the types of volca-
noes and their characteristics.

Shield Volcanoes
Shield  volcanoes are  by  far  the  largest  volcanoes.
They are common in the Hawaiian Islands and are
also found in Iceland and some islands in the Indian
Ocean (Figure 8.5, page 257). Shield volcanoes are
shaped like a gentle arch, or shield. They are among
the tallest mountains on Earth when measured from
their  base,  often  located  on  the  ocean  ﬂoor.  Shield

compression melting occurs when the

rocks is decreased by thinning of the

welling of superheated rocks. (b) Melting

volcanoes are characterized by generally nonexplosive
eruptions, which result from the relatively low silica
content  (about  50  percent)  of  the  magma.  When  a
shield  volcano  erupts,  lava  tends  to  ﬂow  down  the
sides of the volcano rather than explode violently into
the  atmosphere.  The  common  rock  type  formed  by
the  magma  of  shield  volcanoes  is  basalt,  composed
mostly of feldspar and ferromagnesian minerals. (See
Chapter 3 for a review of mineral and rock types.)

Shield volcanoes are built up almost entirely from
numerous lava ﬂows, but they can also produce a lot
of tephra. Tephra, also referred to as pyroclastic debris,

includes all types of volcanic debris that are explo-
sively ejected from a volcano. Debris particles range
from ash, less than 2 mm (0.08 in.) in diameter, to
cinders, 4 to 32 mm (0.16 to 1.26 in.) in diameter, to
blocks and  bombs greater  than  64  mm  (2.52  in.)  in
diameter. Accumulation of tephra forms pyroclastic
deposits (Greek  pyro,  “ﬁre,”  and  klastos,  “broken”).
Pyroclastic  deposits  may  be  consolidated  to  form
pyroclastic rocks.

The slope of a shield volcano is very gentle near
the top, but it increases on the ﬂanks. This change is
due  to  the  viscosity  of  the  ﬂowing  lava.  When

magma comes out of vents, or openings, at the top
of the volcano, it is quite hot and ﬂows easily. As it
ﬂows down the sides of the volcano, it cools and be-
comes more viscous, so a steeper slope is needed for
it to travel farther downslope.

In addition to ﬂowing down the sides of a volcano,
lava can move away from a vent in a number of ways.
Magma  often  moves  for  many  kilometers  under-
ground in lava tubes. These tubes are often very close
to the surface, and they insulate the magma, keeping
it hot and ﬂuid. After the lava cools and crystallizes
to  rock,  the  lava  tubes  may  be  left  behind  as  long,
sinuous cavern systems (Figure 8.6). They form nat-
ural conduits for movement of groundwater and may

cause engineering problems when they are encoun-
tered during construction projects.

A  shield  volcano  may  have  a  summit  caldera,
which is a steep, walled basin often 10 km (6.2 mi)
or more in diameter. A summit caldera is formed by
collapse  of  the  summit  of  the  volcano,  in  which  a
lava  lake  may  form  and  from  which  lava  may  ﬂow
during  an  eruption.  Eruptions  of  lava  from  shield
volcanoes  also  commonly  occur  along  linear  frac-
tures known as rift zones on the ﬂank of a volcano.
For  example,  rift  eruptions  at  the  Hawaiian  shield
volcano Kilauea, on the big island of Hawaii, during
the past several decades continue to add new land to
the island.4

both in Washington State. Compos-
ite  volcanoes  are  characterized  by
magma  with  an  intermediate  silica
content  (about  60  percent),  which
is more viscous than the lower-silica
magma  of  shield  volcanoes.  The
common  rock  type  formed  by  the
magma  of  composite  volcanoes  is
andesite,  composed  mostly  of  soda
and  lime-rich  feldspar  and  ferro-
magnesian  minerals,  with  small
amounts of quartz. Composite vol-
canoes are distinguished by a mix-
ture  of  explosive  activity  and  lava
ﬂows. As a result, these volcanoes,
also called stratovolcanoes, are com-
posed of alternating layers of pyro-
clastic  deposits  and 
lava  ﬂows.
Their  steep  ﬂanks  are  due  to  the
angle  of  repose,  or  the  maximum
slope  angle  for  loose  material,  which  for  many 
pyroclastic deposits is approximately 30 percent to
35 percent.

Don’t  let  the  beauty  of  these  mountains  fool
you.  Because  of  their  explosive  activity  and  rela-
tively  common  occurrence,  composite  volcanoes
are  responsible  for  most  of  the  volcanic  hazards
that  have  caused  death  and  destruction  through-
out  history.  As  the  1980  eruption  of  Mount  St.
Helens  demonstrated,  they  can  produce  gigantic
horizontal blasts, similar in form to the blast of a
shotgun.  We  should  consider  such  volcanoes
armed and dangerous.

Composite Volcanoes
Composite volcanoes are known for their beautiful
cone  shape  (Figure  8.7).  Examples  in  the  United
States  include  Mount  St.  Helens  and  Mt.  Rainier,

Volcanic Domes
Volcanic domes are characterized by viscous magma
with  a  relatively  high  silica  content  (about  70  per-
cent).  The  common  rock  type  produced  by  this
magma  is  rhyolite,  composed  mostly  of  potassium-
and  sodium-rich 
feldspar,  quartz,  and  minor
amounts of ferromagnesian minerals. The activity of
volcanic  domes  is  mostly  explosive,  making  these
volcanoes very dangerous. Mt. Lassen in northeast-
ern California is a good example of a volcanic dome.
Mt.  Lassen’s  last  series  of  eruptions,  from  1914  to
1917,  included  a  tremendous  lateral  blast  that  af-
fected a large area (Figure 8.8).

Volcano Types

Cinder Cones
Cinder cones are relatively small volcanoes formed
from  tephra,  mostly  volcanic  ash  and  larger  parti-
cles,  including  volcanic  bombs.  Bombs  are  formed
from  blobs  of  ejected  lava  that  spin  in  the  air  and
take on a rounded shape with tapered ends. Cinder
cones grow from the accumulation of tephra near a
volcanic vent. They are often found on the ﬂanks of

larger  volcanoes  or  along  normal  faults  and  long
cracks or ﬁssures (Figure 8.9).

The  Paricutín  cinder  cone  (Figure  8.10)  in  the
Itzicuaro  Valley  of  central  Mexico,  west  of  Mexico
City, offered a rare opportunity to observe the birth
and  rapid  growth  of  a  volcano  at  a  location  where
none  had  existed  before.  On  February  20,  1943,

thunder coming from beneath the surface of Earth,
an  astounding  event  occurred.  As  Dionisio  Pulido
was preparing his cornﬁeld for planting, he noticed
that a hole in the ground he had been trying to ﬁll
for  years  had  opened  wider.  As  Señor  Pulido
watched,  the  surrounding  ground  swelled,  rising
over  2  m  (6.5  ft),  and  sulfurous  smoke  and  ash
began  billowing  from  the  hole.  By  that  night,  the
hole was ejecting glowing red rock fragments high
into the air. By the next day, the cinder cone had
grown  as  high  as  a  three-story  building,  as  rocks
and ash continued to be blown into the sky by the
eruption.  After  only  5  days,  the  cinder  cone  had
grown to the height of a 30-story building. In June
1944, a ﬁssure that had opened in the base of the
now  400  m  (1,312  ft)-high  cone  erupted  a  thick
lava  ﬂow  that  overran  the  nearby  village  of  San
Juan Parangaricutiro, leaving little but the church
steeple  exposed  (see  Figure  8.10).  No  one  was
killed by the ash or lava ﬂow, and, within a decade,
Paricutín  cinder  cone  became  a  dormant  volcano.
Nevertheless, the years of eruption from Dionisio’s
cornﬁeld  had  signiﬁcant 
local  impacts.  Crops
failed;  they  were  sometimes  buried  by  ash  faster
than  they  could  grow;  and  livestock  became  sick
and  died.  Some  people  relocated  to  other  areas,
and others moved back to the area. Locating prop-
erty  boundaries  was  difﬁcult  because  boundary

markers were often covered by ash and lava, result-
ing in property disputes.6

8.4 Volcano Origins
We established earlier that the causes of volcanic ac-
tivity are directly related to plate tectonics.4 Under-
standing  the  tectonic  origins  of  different  types  of
volcanoes  helps  explain  the  chemical  differences  in
their rock types. Figure 8.11 is an idealized diagram
showing  the  relationship  of  processes  at  plate
boundaries to the volcano types we have described.
The following features are illustrated in the diagram:

1. Volcanism occurring at mid-oceanic ridges pro-
duces  basaltic  rock  (decompression  melting).
Basaltic rock has a relatively low silica content
and wells up directly from the asthenosphere as
magma.  The  basaltic  magma  mixes  very  little
with other materials except oceanic crust, which
itself  is  basaltic.  Where  these  spreading  ridge
systems occur on land, as, for example, in Ice-
land, shield volcanoes are formed (Figure 8.12).
2. Shield  volcanoes  are  formed  above  hot  spots
located  below  the  lithospheric  plates.  For  ex-
ample, the Hawaiian volcanoes are located well
within the Paciﬁc plate rather than near a plate

boundary. It is currently believed that there is
a hot spot below the Paciﬁc plate where magma
is  generated.  Magma  moves  upward  through
the plate and produces a volcano on the bottom
of  the  sea;  such  a  volcano  may  eventually  be-
come  an  island.  The  plate  containing  the
Hawaiian Islands is moving roughly northwest
over the stationary hot spot; therefore, a chain
of volcanoes running northwest to southeast is
formed (see Chapter 2). The island of Hawaii is
presently near the hot spot and is experiencing
active  volcanism  and  growth.  Islands  to  the
northwest, such as Molokai and Oahu, have ev-
idently moved off the hot spot, since the volca-
noes on these islands are no longer active.

3. Composite  volcanoes  are  associated  with  an-
desitic  volcanic  rocks  and  subduction  zones
(melting due to addition of volatiles). These are
the most common volcanoes found around the
Paciﬁc Rim. For example, volcanoes in the Cas-
cade Range of Washington, Oregon, and Califor-
nia are related to the Cascadia subduction zone
(Figure 8.13). Andesitic volcanic rocks are pro-
duced at subduction zones, where rising magma
mixes with both oceanic and continental crust.
Since continental crust has a higher silica con-
tent than basaltic magma, this process produces
rock with an intermediate silica content.

4. Caldera-forming  eruptions  may  be  extremely
explosive and violent. These eruptions tend to
be  associated  with  rhyolitic  rocks,  which  are

produced  when  magma  moves  upward  and
mixes  with  continental  crust.  Rhyolitic  rocks
contain  more  silica  than  other  volcanic  rocks
because of the high silica content of continen-
tal crust. Volcanic domes, although not always
associated with caldera-forming eruptions, are
usually found inland of subduction zones and
erupt silica-rich rhyolitic magma as well.

Our  brief  discussion  does  not  explain  all  differ-
ences  in  composition  and  occurrence  of  basaltic,
andesitic,  and  rhyolitic  rocks.  However,  it  does  es-
tablish  the  most  basic  relationships  between  plate
tectonics, volcanic activity, and volcanic rocks.

8.5 Volcanic Features
Geologic features that are often associated with vol-
canoes  or  volcanic  areas  include  craters,  calderas,
volcanic vents, geysers, and hot springs.

Craters, Calderas, and Vents
Depressions  commonly  found  at  the  top  of  volca-
noes  are  craters.  Craters  form  by  explosion  or  col-
lapse of the upper portion of the volcanic cone and
may be ﬂat ﬂoored or funnel shaped. They are usually
a  few  kilometers  in  diameter.  Calderas are  gigantic,
often  circular,  depressions  resulting  from  explosive
ejection of magma and subsequent collapse of the
upper portion of the volcanic cone. They may be 20

vents as well as other volcanic features, such as gas

through  which  lava  and  pyroclastic  debris  are

roughly  circular  conduits,  and  eruptions  construct

Hot springs and geysers are hydrologic features found
in some volcanic areas. Groundwater that comes into

contact with hot rock becomes heated, and, in some
cases, the heated water discharges at the surface as a
hot spring, or thermal spring. In rare cases, the subsur-
face  groundwater  system  involves  circulation  and
heating  patterns  that  produce  periodic  release  of
steam  and  hot  water  at  the  surface,  a  phenomenon
called a geyser. World-famous geyser basins or ﬁelds
are found in Iceland, New Zealand, and Yellowstone
National Park in Wyoming (Figure 8.15).

Caldera Eruptions
Calderas are produced by very rare but extremely vio-
lent  eruptions.  Although  none  have  occurred  any-
where  on  Earth  in  the  past  few  hundred  thousand
years, at least 10 caldera eruptions have occurred in
the past million years, 3 of them in North America. A
large  caldera-forming  eruption  may  explosively  ex-
trude up to 1,000 km3 (240 mi3) of pyroclastic debris,
consisting mostly of ash. This is approximately 1,000
times  the  quantity  ejected  by  the  1980  eruption  of
Mount St. Helens! Such an eruption could produce a
caldera  more  than  10  km  (6.2  mi)  in  diameter  and
blanket an area several tens of thousands of square
kilometers with ash. These ash deposits can be 100 m
(328 ft) thick near the crater’s rim and a meter or so
thick  100  km  (62  mi)  away  from  the  source.7 The
most  recent  caldera-forming  eruptions  in  North
America occurred about 600,000 years ago at Yellow-

stone National Park in Wyoming and 700,000 years
ago in Long Valley, California. Volcanic features and
the geology of the Long Valley caldera are shown in
Figure 8.16. Figure 8.17a shows the area covered by
ash in the eruption event, which produced the Long
Valley caldera near the famous Mammoth Mountain
ski  resort.  Figure  8.17b shows  the  potential  hazard
from a future volcanic eruption at Long Valley. The
most  recent  volcanic  eruptions  at  Long  Valley  were
about  400  years  ago.  Measurable  uplift  of  the  land 
accompanied by swarms of earthquakes up to M 6 in
the  early  1980s  suggested  that  magma  was  moving
upward,  prompting  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  to
issue  a  potential  volcanic  hazard  warning  that  was
subsequently  lifted.  However,  the  future  of  Long 
Valley remains uncertain.

The main events in a caldera-producing eruption
can  occur  quickly—in  a  few  days  to  a  few  weeks—

a radius of 120 km (75 mi) and encloses the area that would be subject to at least 1 m (3.3 ft) of downwind ash accumulation if a similar
eruption were to occur again. Also within this circle, hot pyroclastic ﬂows (ash ﬂows) are likely to occur and, in fact, could extend farther
than shown by the circle. (b) The red area and diagonal lines show the hazard from ﬂowage events out to a distance of approximately

of potential hazards assume an explosive eruption of approximately 1 km3 (0.24 mi3) from the vicinity of recently active vents. (From Miller,

Volcanic Activity

but intermittent, lesser-magnitude volcanic activity
can linger for a million years. Thus, the Yellowstone
event has left us hot springs and geysers, including
Old Faithful,  while  the  Long  Valley  event  has  left
us a potential volcanic hazard. In fact, both sites are
still  capable  of  producing  volcanic  activity  because
magma is still present at variable depths beneath the
caldera ﬂoors. Both are considered resurgent calderas
because  their  floors  have  slowly  domed  upward
since  the  explosive  eruptions  that  formed  them. 
The most likely future eruptions for Long Valley or
Yellowstone  would  be  much  smaller  than  the  giant
caldera  eruptions  that  occurred  hundreds  of  thou-
sands of years ago.

8.6 Volcanic Hazards
Volcanic  hazards  include  the  primary effects of  vol-
canic activity that are the direct results of the erup-
tion and secondary effects, which may be caused by
the primary effects. Primary effects are lava ﬂows;
pyroclastic activity, including ash fall, ash ﬂows, and
lateral blasts; and the release of gases. Most of the
gases released are steam, but corrosive or poisonous
gases  may  also  be  released.  Secondary  effects  in-
clude  debris  ﬂows,  mudﬂows,  landslides,  or  debris
avalanches, ﬂoods, and ﬁres. At the planetary level,
large  eruptions  can  cause  global  cooling  of  the  at-
mosphere for a year or so.7,8

Lava Flows
Lava ﬂows are one of the most familiar products of
volcanic  activity.  They  result  when  magma  reaches
the  surface  and  overﬂows  the  crater  or  a  volcanic
vent  along  the  ﬂanks  of  the  volcano.  The  three
major groups of lava take their names from the vol-
canic  rocks  they  form:  basaltic  (by  far  the  most
abundant of the three), andesitic, and rhyolitic.

Lava ﬂows can be quite ﬂuid and move rapidly, or
they  can  be  relatively  viscous  and  move  slowly.
Basaltic lavas, composed of approximately 50 percent
silica, exhibit a range of velocities. Basaltic lavas with
lower viscosity and higher eruptive temperatures are
the fastest moving, with a usual velocity of a meter or
so per hour (around 3.2 ft per hour) but may be much
faster  on  a  steep  slope.  These  lavas,  called  pahoehoe
lavas (pronounced pa-hoy-hoy), have a  smooth,  ropy
surface  texture  when  they  harden  (Figure  8.18a).
Cooler, more viscous basaltic lava ﬂows move at rates

of a few meters per day and have a blocky texture after
hardening (Figure 8.18b). This type of basaltic lava is
called aa (pronounced ah-ah). With the exception of
some ﬂows on steep slopes, most lava ﬂows are slow
enough that people can easily move out of the way as
they approach.9

Lava ﬂows from rift eruptions on Kilauea, Hawaii,
began  in  1983  and  have  become  the  longest  and
largest eruptions of Kilauea in history4 (Figure 8.19).
By  2005,  more  than  100  structures  in  the  village  of
Kalapana had been destroyed by lava ﬂows, including
the National Park Visitor Center. Lava ﬂowed across
part of the famous Kaimu Black Sand Beach and into
the ocean. The village of Kalapana has virtually disap-
peared,  and  it  will  be  many  decades  before  much  of
the land is productive again. The eruptions, in concert
with beach processes, have produced new black sand
beaches. The sand is produced when the molten lava
enters  the  relatively  cold  ocean  waters  and  shatters
into sand-sized particles.

Methods to Control Lava Flows
Several  methods,  such  as  hydraulic  chilling  and  wall
construction, have been employed to deﬂect lava ﬂows
away  from  populated  or  otherwise  valuable  areas.
These methods have had mixed success. They cannot

texture, surrounding and destroying a home at Kalapana, Hawaii,

the National Park Service Visitor Center. These types of ﬂows are
often called ropy lava because of the surface texture, which looks
a bit like pieces of rope lying side by side as if coiled. (Paul
Richards/UPI/Corbis)

be expected to modify large ﬂows, and their effective-
ness with smaller ﬂows requires further evaluation.

Hydraulic chilling of lava ﬂows, or cooling the ﬂow
with water, has sometimes been successful in reduc-
ing  damage  from  volcanic  eruptions.  The  world’s
most ambitious hydraulic chilling program was initi-
ated  in  January  1973  on  the  Icelandic  island  of
Heimaey, when basaltic lava ﬂows from Mt. Helgafell
nearly closed the harbor of the island’s main town,
Vestmannaeyjar,  threatening  the  continued  use  of
the island as Iceland’s main ﬁshing port. The situa-
tion prompted immediate action.

Three favorable conditions existed: (1) Flows were
slow moving, allowing the necessary time to initiate a
control program; (2) transport by sea and local roads

(a)

(c)

allowed for the transport of pipes, pumps, and heavy
equipment;  and  (3)  water  was  readily  available.  Ini-
tially, the edges and surface of the ﬂow were cooled
with water from numerous ﬁre hoses fed from a pipe
(Figure 8.20). Then bulldozers were moved up on the
slowly  advancing  ﬂow,  making  a  track  or  road  on
which  the  plastic  pipe  was  placed.  The  pipe  did  not
melt as long as water was ﬂowing in it, and small holes
in  the  pipe  also  helped  cool  particularly  hot  spots
along  various  parts  of  the  ﬂow.  Watering  near  the
front of the ﬂow had little effect the ﬁrst day, but then
ﬂow began to slow down and in some cases stopped.
The  action  taken  in  Iceland  undoubtedly  had  an
important effect on the lava ﬂows from Mt. Helgafell.
It tended to restrict lava movement and, thus, reduced

the  outpouring  of  lava  stopped  in  June  1973,  the 
harbor  was  still  usable.10 In  fact,  by  fortuitous  cir-
cumstances,  the  shape  of  the  harbor  was  actually 
improved,  with  the  new  rock  providing  additional
protection from the sea.

Pyroclastic Activity
Pyroclastic activity describes explosive volcanism, in
which tephra is physically blown from a volcanic vent
into the atmosphere. Several types of pyroclastic ac-
tivity can occur. In volcanic ash eruptions, or ash fall, a
tremendous quantity of rock fragments, natural glass
fragments, and gas is blown high into the air by ex-
plosions from the volcano. Lateral blasts are explo-
sions of gas and ash from the side of a volcano that
destroy  part  of  the  mountain.  The  ejected  material
travels away from the volcano at tremendous speeds.
Lateral blasts can be very destructive, and sometimes
the velocity of the ejected material is nearly the speed
of sound. (See the discussion of Mount St. Helens in
Section 8.7 of this chapter.) Pyroclastic ﬂows, or ash
ﬂows, are some of the most lethal aspects of volcanic
eruptions. They are avalanches of very hot pyroclastic
materials—ash,  rock,  volcanic  glass  fragments,  and
gas—that  are  blown  out  of  a  vent  and  move  very
rapidly  down  the  sides  of  the  volcano.  Pyroclastic
ﬂows  are  also  known  as  hot  avalanches,  or  nueé ar-
dentes, which is French for “glowing cloud.”

Volcanic Hazards

269

Ash  Fall. Volcanic  ash  eruptions  can  cover  hun-
dreds or even thousands of square kilometers with a
carpet of volcanic ash. Ash eruptions create several
hazards:

• Vegetation, including crops and trees, may be

destroyed.

• Surface  water  may  be  contaminated  by  sedi-
ment,  resulting  in  a  temporary  increase  in
acidity  of  the  water.  The  increase  in  acidity
generally lasts only a few hours after the erup-
tion ceases.

• Structural  damage  to  buildings  may  occur,
caused by the increased load on roofs (Figure
8.21).  A  depth  of  only  1  cm  (0.4  in.)  of  ash
places an extra 2.5 tons of weight on the roof of
an average house.

• Health hazards, such as irritation of the respi-
ratory system and eyes, are caused by contact
with the ash and associated caustic fumes.9

• Engines of jetliners may “ﬂame out” as melted
silica-rich ash forms a thin coating of volcanic
glass  in  the  engines.  For  example,  the  1989
eruption  of  Redoubt  Volcano  in  Alaska  pro-
duced an ash eruption cloud that an airliner on
the  way  to  Japan  encountered.  Power  to  all
four engines of the jetliner was lost. Fortunate-
ly,  the  engines  restarted  within  about  5  min-
utes.  The  plane  fell  about  10,000  feet  during
the time it took to restart, but it managed to
land  safely  in  Anchorage,  Alaska.  Damage  to

the aircraft was about $80 million.6 Since the
Alaska  incident,  Federal  Aviation  Administra-
tion (FAA) guidelines limit air trafﬁc near vol-
canic ash clouds. In April 2010, an ash plume
rising 9.5 km (6 mi) into the atmosphere above
the  erupting  Icelandic  volcano  Eyjafjallajokull
forced  the  shutdown  of  the  airspace  above  a
large  region,  including  the  United  Kingdom,
Ireland,  Sweden,  Norway,  and  other  parts  of
northern  Europe.  The  shutdown  was  the
largest aerial closure in Europe in the past 70
years.  About  95,000  ﬂights  were  canceled  be-
cause it was feared that the ash could damage
aircraft and perhaps cause engine failure. As a
result,  several  hundred  thousand  passengers
were stranded in airports, at a cost to the air-
line industry of more than $1 billion during a
single 1-week period11,12

Ash Flows. Ash flows, or nueé ardentes, may be
as  hot as 800 degrees Celsius and move as fast as
200 km per hour (125 mi per hour) down the sides
of a volcano, incinerating everything in their path.
They  can  be  catastrophic  if  a  populated  area  is  in
the path of the ﬂow; fortunately, they seldom occur
in  populated  areas.  A  tragic  example  occurred  in
1902 on the West Indian island of Martinique. On
the morning of May 8, a ﬂow of hot, glowing ash,
steam, and other gases roared down Mt. Pelée and
through the town of St. Pierre, killing 30,000 people.
A jailed prisoner was one of only two survivors, and
he was severely burned and horribly scarred. Report-
edly,  he  spent  the  rest  of  his  life  touring  circus
sideshows as the “Prisoner of St. Pierre.” Flows like
these  have  occurred  on  volcanoes  of  the  Paciﬁc
Northwest and Japan in the past and can be expected
in the future.

Poisonous Gases
A number of gases, including water vapor (H2O), car-
bon  dioxide  (CO2),  carbon  monoxide  (CO),  sulfur
dioxide (SO2), and hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S), are emit-
ted during volcanic activity. Water and carbon diox-
ide  make  up  more  than  90  percent  of  all  emitted
gases.  Toxic  concentrations  of  hazardous  volcanic
gases rarely reach populated areas. A notable tragic
exception occurred in 1986 in Lake Nyos, Cameroon,
West Africa. Lake Nyos is located in a 200 m (656 ft)-
deep crater on a dormant volcano; without any warn-
ing  other  than  an  audible  rumbling,  the  seemingly

dormant volcano released a dense cloud of gas, con-
sisting primarily of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is
a colorless, odorless gas that is heavier than air. The
gas  cloud  ﬂowed  10  km  (6.2  mi)  down  the  volcano
along  a  valley,  hugging  the  ground  and  suffocating
1,700 people and 3,000 cattle (Figure 8.22a,b).4

Since 1986, carbon dioxide gas has continued to
accumulate in the bottom of the lake, and another
release  could  occur  at  any  time.  Although  the  lake
area was to remain closed to all people but scientists
studying  the  hazard,  thousands  of  people  are  re-
turning  to  farm  the  land.  Scientists  have  installed
an alarm system at the lake that will sound if carbon
dioxide levels become high. They have also installed
a pipe from the lake bottom to a degassing fountain
on the surface of the lake (Figure 8.22c) that allows
the carbon dioxide gas to escape slowly into the at-
mosphere. The hazard is being slowly reduced as the
single  degassing  fountain  is  now  releasing  a  little
more  carbon  dioxide  gas  than  is  naturally  seeping
into the lake. At least ﬁve additional pipes with de-
gassing fountains will be necessary to adequately re-
duce the hazard.

Sulfur dioxide can react in the atmosphere to pro-
duce acid rain downwind of an eruption. Toxic con-
centrations of some chemicals emitted as gases may
be absorbed by volcanic ash that falls onto the land.
Eventually, the acid rain and toxic ash are incorpo-
rated into the soil and into plants eaten by people
and  livestock.  For  example,  ﬂuorine  is  erupted  as
hydroﬂuoric acid; it can be absorbed by volcanic ash
and can be leached into water supplies.3

In Japan, volcanoes are monitored to detect the
release of poisonous gases, such as hydrogen sulﬁde.
When  releases  are  detected,  sirens  are  sounded  to
advise people to evacuate to high ground to escape
the gas.

Volcanoes can also produce a type of smog known
as vog (volcanic material, v, and fog, og). For exam-
ple,  emissions  of  sulfur  dioxide  and  other  volcanic
gases from Kilauea in Hawaii have continuously oc-
curred since 1986. At times, these gases have traveled
downwind  and  chemically  interacted  with  oxygen
and  moisture  in  the  atmosphere  to  produce  vog
conditions  mixed  with  acid  rain.  At  times,  south-
eastern areas of Hawaii were blanketed with thick
acidic  haze,  and  health  warnings  were  issued.  The
vog  is  potentially  hazardous  to  both  people  and
other  living  things,  and  adverse  health  effects  are
being evaluated in Hawaii.13,14 Small acidic aerosol

particulates  and  sulfur  dioxide  concentrations  like
those  in  vog  can  penetrate  deep  within  human
lungs and are known to induce asthma attacks and
cause other respiratory problems. Atmospheric con-
centrations of sulfur dioxide emitted from Kilauea,
at  times,  far  exceed  air  quality  standards  (see
Chapter 19). Residents and visitors have reported a
variety of symptoms when exposed to vog, includ-
ing  breathing  difﬁculties,  headaches,  sore  throats,
watery  eyes,  and  ﬂulike  symptoms.  In  1988,  acid
rain in the Kona district captured from rooftop rain-
water-catchment  systems  produced  lead-contami-
nated  water  in  40  percent  of  homes.  The  lead  is
leached by acid rain from rooﬁng and plumbing ma-
terials. Some residents, when tested, were found to
have  an  elevated  concentration  of  lead  in  their
blood, presumably from drinking the water.14

Debris Flows and Mudﬂows
The  most  serious  secondary  effects  of  volcanic
activity are debris ﬂows and mudﬂows, known col-
lectively  by  their  Indonesian  name  lahars.  Lahars
are produced when a large volume of loose volcanic
ash and other ejecta becomes saturated with water
and becomes unstable, allowing it to suddenly move
downslope (see Figure 8.2). The distinction between
a debris ﬂow and a mudﬂow depends upon the dom-
inant  size  of  the  particles.  In  debris  ﬂows,  more
than  50  percent  of  the  particles  are  coarser  than
sand, 2 mm (0.08 in.) in diameter. We will discuss
landslides in detail in Chapter 10.

Debris Flows. Research completed at several vol-
canoes  suggests  that  even  relatively  small  erup-
tions  of  hot  volcanic  material  may  quickly  melt

Deposits of the Osceola mudﬂow are 5,000 years old.
This mudﬂow moved more than 80 km (50 mi) from
the volcano and involved more than 1.9 km3 (0.45 mi3)
of debris, equivalent to 13 km2 (5 mi2) piled to a depth
of more than 150 m (492 ft). Deposits of the younger,
500-year-old Electron mudﬂow reached about 56 km
(35 mi) from the volcano.

Hundreds of thousands of people now live on the
area  covered  by  these  old  ﬂows,  and  there  is  no
guarantee  that  similar  ﬂows  will  not  occur  again.
Figure 8.24 shows the potential risk of mudﬂows,
lava ﬂows, and pyroclastic debris accumulation for
Mt.  Rainier.  Someone  in  the  valley  facing  the  ad-
vancing front of such a ﬂow would describe it as a
wall of mud a few meters high, moving at about 30
to 50 km per hour (20 to 30 mi per hour). This ob-
server would ﬁrst see the ﬂow at a distance of about
1.6 km (around 1 mi) and would need a car headed
in the right direction toward high ground to escape
being buried alive.9

CHAPTER 8

Volcanic Activity

large  volumes  of  snow  and  ice.  The  copious
amounts  of  melted  water  produce  ﬂoods;  a  ﬂood
may erode the slope of the volcano and incorporate
sediment, such as volcanic ash and other material,
forming  debris  ﬂows.  Volcanic  debris  ﬂows  are
fast-moving  mixtures  of  sediment, 
including
blocks of rock and water, with the general consis-
tency of wet concrete. Debris ﬂows can travel many
kilometers down valleys from the ﬂanks of the vol-
cano  where  they  were  produced.9 For  example,  a
pyroclastic  ﬂow  that  erupted  from  Alaska’s  Mt. 
Redoubt volcano early in 1990 rapidly melted snow
and ice while moving across Drift Glacier. Volumi-
nous  amounts  of  water  and  sediment  produced  a
debris  ﬂow  that  quickly  moved  down  the  valley,
with a discharge comparable to that of the Missis-
sippi  River  at  ﬂood  stage.  Fortunately,  the  event
was in an isolated area, so no lives were lost.3

Mudflows. Gigantic  mudﬂows  have  originated  on
the  ﬂanks  of  volcanoes  in  the  Paciﬁc  Northwest.8 A
mudﬂow  that  is  composed  mostly  of  volcanic  ash  is
often called a lahar. The paths of two ancient mudﬂows
originating on Mt. Rainier are shown in Figure 8.23.

Volcanic Hazards

273

The U.S. Geological Survey has developed an auto-
mated, solar-powered lahar-detection system for sev-
eral volcanoes in the United States (e.g., Mt. Rainier),
Indonesia, the Philippines, Mexico, and Japan. Detec-
tors (i.e., acoustic-ﬂow monitors) that sense ground
vibrations from a moving lahar can warn that a ﬂow
is moving down the valley. The system replaces visual
sightings  or  cameras  that  are  not  reliable  in  bad
weather  or  at  night  and  require  continued  personal
attention.  Dangerous  lahars  can  occur  quickly,  with
little warning. The important thing is to know when
to evacuate. If the lahar-detection system sounds an
alarm that a lahar is approaching, the warning is is-
sued with sufﬁcient time to evacuate to safe (higher)
ground.15

What  may  be  the  largest  active  landslides  on
Earth  are  located  in  Hawaii.  Presently,  these  land-
slides are slow moving (approximately 10 cm [4 in.]
per year). They can be up to 100 km (62 mi) wide,
10 km (6.2 mi) thick, and 20 km (12.4 mi) long and
extend from a volcanic rift zone on land to an end-
point  beneath  the  sea.  These  slow-moving  land-
slides contain blocks of rock the size of Manhattan

Island. The fear is that they might, as they have in
the  past,  become  giant,  fast-moving  submarine
debris  avalanches,  generating  huge  tsunamis  that
deposit marine debris hundreds of meters above sea
level at nearby islands and cause catastrophic dam-
age around the Paciﬁc Basin. Fortunately, such high-
magnitude  events  apparently  happen  only  every
100,000 years or so.4

Other  huge  volcano-related  landslides  and  de-
bris avalanches have been documented in the Canary
Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean off the western
coast  of  Africa.  On  Tenerife,  the  largest  island,  six
huge landslides have occurred during the past several
million  years  (Figure  8.25).  The  most  recent  event
occurred  less  than  150,000  years  ago.  Mt.  Teide,
with an elevation of 3.7 km (2.3 mi), is within the
now-collapsed  Cañada  Caldera.16,17 The  landslides
have  produced  large  linear  valleys,  the  largest  of
which is Orotova Valley, the site of the city of Puerto
de la Cruz, which is a major coastal tourist destina-
tion  and  retirement  center  for  Europeans.  The
youngest  valley  is  Icod  (Figure  8.25).  The  total 
volume  of  the  slide  deposits  exceeds  1,000  km3

(240 mi3). The offshore seaﬂoor north of Tenerife
is  covered  by  5,500  km2 (2,150  mi2)  of  landslide
deposits, an area of more than twice the land sur-
face of the island.18

There  is  concern  that  a  future  landslide  from
Tenerife or La Palma, another of the Canary Islands,
would cause a huge tsunami known as a megatsunami.
Waves with heights exceeding 100 m are possible.
They would cause catastrophic damage to the east-
ern  coast  of  the  United  States,  including  the  city
of New York. The possibility of future huge land-
slides is unknown, but their occurrence cannot be
ruled out.

8.7 Two Case Histories
Mt. Pinatubo
On  June  15  and  16,  1991,  the  second  largest  vol-
canic eruption of the twentieth century occurred at
Mt.  Pinatubo  on  Luzon  Island  in  the  Philippines
(Figure 8.26). The combined effects of ash fall, debris

ﬂows,  mudﬂows,  and  a  typhoon  resulted  in  the
deaths of about 300 people. Most deaths were due
to  the  collapse  of  buildings  as  heavy,  wet  volcanic
ash—resulting  from  the  simultaneous  arrival  of
Typhoon  Yunya—accumulated  on  roofs  to  thick-
nesses of 30 cm (12 in.) as far as 40 km (25 mi) from
the  volcano.2 Evacuation  of  250,000  people  from 
villages and a U.S. military base within a radius of
30 km (19 mi) from the summit saved thousands of
lives.4 Teams of scientists educated local people and
authorities  by  talking  to  them  and  showing  them
videos of volcanic eruptions and their potential haz-
ards. Their efforts convinced local ofﬁcials to order
the  evacuations  and  the  people  who  were  at  risk
to comply.19

The  tremendous  explosions  at  Pinatubo  sent  a
cloud of ash 400 km (250 mi) wide to elevations of
34 km (21 mi).4 As with similar past events of this
magnitude, the aerosol cloud of ash, including sul-
fur dioxide, remained in the atmosphere for more
than  a  year.  The  ash  particles  and  sulfur  dioxide
scattered  incoming  sunlight  and  slightly  cooled
the  global  climate  during  the  year  following  the
eruptions.2,19

The 1991 success of saving lives during the Mt.
Pinatubo eruptions stands in stark contrast to the
1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz (see Chapter 5).
In Armero, a volcanic hazard became a catastrophe
that  resulted  in  part  from  a  series  of  human  er-
rors.  It  was  not  a  huge  eruption  or  a  case  of  bad
luck. Rather, it resulted because the science of the
hazard  was  not  effectively  communicated  to  peo-
ple and officials in the area. Nevado del Ruiz was 
a  tragedy  that  could  have  and  should  have  been
avoided.

Mount St. Helens
The  May  18,  1980,  eruption  of  Mount  St.  Helens 
in the southwestern corner of Washington (Figure
8.27)  exempliﬁes  the  many  types  of  volcanic
events expected from a Cascade volcano. The erup-
tion,  like  many  other  natural  events,  was  unique
and  complex,  making  generalizations  somewhat
difﬁcult.  Nevertheless,  we  have  learned  a  great 
deal  from  Mount  St.  Helens,  and  the  story  is  not 
yet complete.

Mount  St.  Helens  awoke  in  March  1980,  after
120  years  of  dormancy,  with  seismic  activity  and
small explosions as groundwater came into contact

FIGURE 8.26 Evacuation Thousands of people were evac-
uated, including more than 1,000 from U.S. Clark Air Base, during
this large ash eruption and explosion of Mt. Pinatubo in the

with hot rock. By May 1, a prominent bulge on the
northern ﬂank of the mountain could be clearly ob-
served  and  grew  at  a  rate  of  about  1.5  m  per  day 
(5 ft per day) (Figure 8.28a). At 8:32  A.M. on May
18, 1980, a M 5.1 earthquake that was registered
on  the  volcano  triggered  a  large  landslide/debris
avalanche  (approximately  2.3  km3 [0.6  mi3])  that
involved  the  entire  bulge  area  (Figure  8.28b).  The
avalanche shot down the north ﬂank of the moun-
tain, displacing water in nearby Spirit Lake; struck
and overrode a ridge 8 km (5 mi) to the north; and
then made an abrupt turn, moving 18 km (11 mi)
down the Toutle River.

Seconds  after  the  failure  of  the  bulge,  Mount
St. Helens erupted with a lateral blast directly from
the area that the bulge had occupied (Figure 8.28c).

The blast moved at speeds up to 1,000 km per hour
(621  mi  per  hour)  to  distances  of  nearly  30  km
(19  mi)  from  its  source.  The  blast  devastated  an
area of about 600 km2 (232 mi2).20,21 The areas of
the debris avalanche, blasted-down timber, scorched
timber, pyroclastic ﬂows, and mudﬂows are shown
in Figure 8.29a (page 277).

About an hour after the lateral blast, a large verti-
cal cloud had risen quickly to an altitude of approxi-
mately  19  km  (12  mi)  (Figure  8.28d).  Eruption  of
the vertical column continued for more than 9 hours,
and large volumes of volcanic ash fell on a wide area
of  Washington,  northern  Idaho,  and  western  and
central  Montana.  During  the  9  hours  of  eruption,
several ash ﬂows swept down the northern slope of
the volcano. The total amount of volcanic ash ejected

was about 1 km3 (0.24 mi3), and a large cloud of ash
moved over the United States, reaching as far east as
New  England  (Figure  8.29b).  The  entire  northern
slope of the volcano, which is the upper part of the
north fork of the Toutle River basin, was devastated.
Forested slopes were transformed into a gray, hum-
mocky, or hilly, landscape consisting of volcanic ash,
rocks,  blocks  of  melting  glacial  ice,  narrow  gullies,
and hot steaming pits (Figure 8.30).21

The ﬁrst of several mudﬂows consisted of a mix-
ture of water, volcanic ash, rock, and organic debris,
such as logs, and occurred minutes after the start of

the  eruption.  The  ﬂows  and  accompanying  ﬂoods
raced down the valleys of the north and south forks
of the Toutle River at estimated speeds of 29 to 55 km
per  hour  (18  to  35  mi  per  hour),  threatening  the
lives of people camped along the river.21

On the morning of May 18, 1980, two young peo-
ple on a ﬁshing trip on the Toutle River were sleep-
ing  about  36  km  (22  mi)  downstream  from  Spirit
Lake. They were awakened by a loud rumbling noise
from  the  river,  which  was  covered  by  felled  trees.
They attempted to run to their car, but water from
the  rising  river  poured  over  the  road,  preventing
their escape. A mass of mud then crashed through
the  forest  toward  the  car,  and  the  couple  climbed
onto the car roof to escape the mud. They were safe
only momentarily, however, as the mud pushed the

vehicle over the bank and into the river. Leaping off
the roof, they fell into the river, which was by now a
rolling  mass  of  mud,  logs,  collapsed  train  trestles,
and  other  debris.  The  water  also  was  increasing  in
temperature. One of the young people got trapped
between logs and disappeared several times beneath
the ﬂow but was lucky enough to emerge again. The
two  were  carried  downstream  for  approximately
1.5  km (0.9  mi)  before  another  family  of  campers
spotted and rescued them.

When the volcano could be viewed again after the
eruption, its maximum altitude had been reduced by
about  450  m  (1,476  ft):  The  original  symmetrical
mountain was now a huge, steep-walled amphithe-
ater facing northward, and Spirit Lake (lower Figure
8.27b) was ﬁlled by deposits (Figure 8.27c). The de-
bris  avalanche,  lateral  blast,  pyroclastic  ﬂows,  and
mudﬂows  devastated  an  area  of  nearly  400  km2
(154 mi2), killing 54 people. More than 100 homes
were destroyed by the ﬂooding, and approximately
800 million board-feet of timber were ﬂattened by
the blast (Figure 8.29a). A board-foot is a board of 1
ft2 that  is  1  in.  thick.  The  total  damage  was  esti-
mated to exceed $1 billion.

After  the  catastrophic  eruption  of  Mount  St. 
Helens,  an  extensive  program  was  established  to
monitor  volcanic  activity.  The  construction  by  lava
ﬂows  of  a  dome  within  the  crater  produced  by  the
May 18, 1980, eruption is carefully monitored. Dur-
ing the ﬁrst 3 years following the eruption, at least 11
smaller  eruptions  occurred.  These  smaller  eruptions
contributed  to  the  building  of  the  lava  dome  to  a

height  of  approximately  250  m  (820  ft).  In  each  of
these eruptions, lava was extruded near the top of the
dome and slowly ﬂowed toward the base. Monitoring
the growth of the dome and the deformation of the
crater  ﬂoor,  along  with  such  other  techniques  as
monitoring the gases emitted, was useful in predict-
ing eruptions. Each event added a few million cubic
meters to the size of the dome.22 By 2000, 20 years
after  the  main  eruption,  life  had  returned  to  the
mountain,  and  its  surrounding  area  was  in  many
places  green  once  more  (Figure  8.31).20 However,
the hummocky landscape from the landslide deposits
is  still  prominent,  a  reminder  of  the  catastrophic
event of 1980. Mount St. Helens has a visitors’ cen-
ter and is now a tourist attraction that has attracted
more than 1 million visitors.23

8.8 Forecasting Volcanic

Activity

A “forecast” for a volcanic eruption is a probabilistic
statement concerning the time, place, and character
of  an  eruption  before  it  occurs.  It  is  analogous 
to  forecasting  the  weather  and  is  not  as  precise  a
statement  as  a  prediction.4 Forecasting  volcanic
eruptions is a major component of the goal of reduc-
ing volcanic hazards.

It is unlikely that we will be able to forecast the
majority of volcanic activity accurately in the near
future, but valuable information is being gathered
about  phenomena  that  occur  before  eruptions.

One  problem  is  that  most  forecasting  techniques
require  experience  with  actual  eruptions  before
the mechanism is understood. Thus, we are better
able to predict eruptions in the Hawaiian Islands
than elsewhere because we have had so much ex-
perience there.

The  methods  of  forecasting  volcanic  eruptions

include:

• Monitoring seismic activity
• Monitoring thermal, magnetic, and hydrologic

• Topographically monitoring tilting or swelling

conditions

of the volcano

• Monitoring volcanic gas emissions
• Studying  the  geologic  history  of  a  particular

volcano or volcanic center3,19,24

Seismic Activity
Our  experience  with  volcanoes,  such  as  Mount  St.
Helens and those on the big island of Hawaii, sug-
gests  that  earthquakes  often  provide  the  earliest
warning of an impending volcanic eruption. In the
case  of  Mount  St.  Helens,  earthquake  activity
started  in  mid-March,  before  the  eruption  in  May.
Activity began suddenly, with near-continuous shal-
low seismicity. Unfortunately, there was no increase
in  earthquakes  immediately  before  the  May  18
event.  In  Hawaii,  earthquakes  have  been  used  to
monitor the movement of magma as it approaches
the surface.

Several  months  before  the  1991  Mt.  Pinatubo
eruptions, small steam explosions and earthquakes
began.3 Mt.  Pinatubo  (present  elevation  1,700  m
[5,578 ft]) was an eroded ridge, and, as a result, did
not  have  the  classic  shape  of  a  volcano.  Further-
more, it had not erupted in 500 years; most of the
people living near it did not even know it was a vol-
cano! Scientists began monitoring earthquake activ-
ity  and  studying  past  volcanic  activity,  which  was
determined to be explosive. Earthquakes increased
in  number  and  magnitude  before  the  catastrophic
eruption, migrating from deep beneath the volcano
to shallow depths beneath the summit.4

Geophysicists have proposed a generalized model
for seismic activity that may help in predicting erup-
tions.25 This model is for explosive composite volca-
noes, such as those in the Cascade Mountains, which
may  awaken  after  an  extended  period  of  inactivity

Forecasting Volcanic Activity

279

(Figure 8.32). In a reawakening volcano, the magma
must fracture and break previously solidiﬁed igneous
rock above the magma chamber in order to work its
way to the surface. Several weeks before reawaken-
ing, increasing pressure creates numerous fractures
in the plugged volcanic conduit above the chamber.
At  ﬁrst,  the  increase  in  seismic  events  will  be  very
gradual, and a seismologist may need 10 days or so
to  conﬁdently  recognize  an  accelerating  trend  to-
ward  an  eruption  (Figure  8.32).  However,  once  the
trend has been recognized, there will be several days
before the eruption occurs. Unfortunately, this short
warning  time  may  be  insufﬁcient  for  a  large-scale
evacuation.  Thus,  to  forecast  eruptions,  it  may  be
best  to  use  seismic  activity  in  concert  with  other
eruption precursors discussed below. It is fortunate
that, in contrast to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions
always provide warning signs.26

Thermal, Magnetic, and 
Hydrologic Monitoring
Monitoring  of  volcanoes  is  based  on  the  fact  that,
before an eruption, a large volume of magma moves
up into some sort of holding reservoir beneath the
volcano.  The  hot  material  changes  the  local  mag-
netic,  thermal,  hydrologic,  and  geochemical  condi-
tions.  As  the  surrounding  rocks  heat,  the  rise  in
temperature of the surﬁcial rock may be detected by
remote  sensing  or  infrared  aerial  photography.  In-
creased heat may melt snowﬁelds or glaciers; thus,
periodic remote sensing of a volcanic chain may de-
tect  new  hot  points  that  could  indicate  potential
volcanic activity. This method was used with some
success at Mount St. Helens before the main erup-
tion on May 18, 1980.

When  older  volcanic  rocks  are  heated  by  new
magma,  magnetic  properties,  originally  imprinted
when the rocks cooled and crystallized, may change.
These  changes  can  be  detailed  by  ground  or  aerial
monitoring of the magnetic properties of the rocks
that the volcano is composed of.3,24

Topographic Monitoring
Monitoring topographic changes and seismic behavior
of volcanoes has been useful in forecasting some vol-
canic  eruptions.  The  Hawaiian  volcanoes,  especially
Kilauea, have supplied most of the data. The summit
of  Kilauea  tilts  and  swells  before  an  eruption  and

FIGURE 8.32 A volcano reawakens Increased seismic activity is a good indicator of a forthcoming vol-
canic eruption. As a dormant volcano reawakens, rising magma fractures rock above. At ﬁrst, the fracturing slowly
increases the rate of seismic activity; then both the fracturing and seismic activity accelerate a few days prior to an
eruption. (Modiﬁed after Kilburn, C. R. J., and Sammonds, P. R. 2005. Maximum warning times for imminent volcanic

subsides  during  the  actual  outbreak  (Figure  8.33).
Kilauea  also  undergoes  earthquake  swarms  that
reﬂect  moving  subsurface  magma  and  an  imminent
eruption.  The  tilting  of  the  summit  in  conjunction
with the earthquake swarms was used to predict a vol-
canic eruption in the vicinity of the farming commu-
nity of Kapoho on the ﬂank of the volcano, 45 km
(28 mi) from the summit. As a result, the inhabitants
were evacuated before the event, in which lava over-
ran  and  eventually  destroyed  most  of  the  village.27
Because  of  the  characteristic  swelling  and  earth-
quake activity before eruptions, scientists expect the
Hawaiian  volcanoes  to  continue  to  be  more  pre-
dictable  than  others.  Monitoring  of  ground  move-
ments, such as tilting, swelling, opening of cracks, or
changes in the water level of lakes on or near a vol-
cano, has become a useful tool for recognizing change

that might indicate a coming eruption.3 Today, satel-
lite-based  radar  and  a  network  of  global  positioning
system (GPS) receivers can be used to monitor change
in volcanoes, including surface deformation, without
sending people into a hazardous area.20

Monitoring Volcanic Gas Emissions
The  primary  objective  of  monitoring  volcanic  gas
emissions is to recognize changes in the chemical
composition  of  the  gases.  Changes  in  both  gas
composition—that  is,  the  relative  amounts  of
gases,  such  as  steam,  carbon  dioxide,  and  sulfur
dioxide—and gas emission rates are thought to be
correlated  with  changes  in  subsurface  volcanic
processes. These factors may indicate movement of
magma  toward  the  surface.  This  technique  was

Geologic History
Understanding  the  geologic  history  of  a  volcano  or
volcanic  system  is  useful  in  predicting  the  types  of
eruptions  likely  to  occur  in  the  future.  The  primary
tool used to establish the geologic history of a volcano
is  geologic  mapping  of  volcanic  rocks  and  deposits.
Lava ﬂows, volcanic mud ﬂow deposits, pyroclastic de-

posits, and ash deposits are dated (for example dating
wood  buried  in  deposits  using  carbon-14)  to  deter-
mine when eruptions occurred in the past. These are
the primary data necessary to produce maps depicting
volcanic  hazards  at  a  particular  site.  Geologic  map-
ping,  in  conjunction  with  the  dating  of  volcanic  de-
posits  at  Kilauea,  Hawaii,  led  to  the  discovery  that
more than 90 percent of the land surface of the vol-
cano has been covered by lava in only the past 1,500
years. The town of Kalapana, destroyed by lava ﬂows
in  1990,  might  never  have  been  built  if  this
information  had  been  known  before  development
because the risk might have been thought too great.

The real value of geologic mapping and dating of vol-
canic events is that they allow development of hazard
maps to assist in land-use planning and preparation
for future eruptions.3 Such maps are now available for
a number of volcanoes around the world.

Volcanic Alert or Warning
At  what  point  should  the  public  be  alerted  or
warned that a volcanic eruption may occur? This is
an important question being addressed by volcanol-
ogists.  At  present,  there  is  no  standard  code,  but
one being used with various modiﬁcations has been
developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. The system
is color coded by condition; each color—green, yel-
low,  orange,  and  red—denotes  increasing  concern.
(Table 8.3). The color-coded system is a good start;
however, the hard questions remain: When should
evacuation begin? When is it safe for people to re-
turn?  Evacuation  is  deﬁnitely  necessary  before
condition red, but when, during conditions yellow
or orange, should it begin?

8.9 Adjustment to 

and Perception of 
the Volcanic Hazard

Apart  from  the  psychological  adjustment  to  losses,
the primary human adjustment to volcanic activity is
evacuation. A notable exception is the previously dis-

cussed  decision  of  the  people  on  the  island  of
Heimaey  to  successfully  ﬁght  an  eruption  by
hydraulically  chilling  the  lava.  Information  concern-
ing how people perceive the volcanic hazard is limited.
People live near volcanoes for a variety of reasons, in-
cluding: (1) They were born there, and, in the case of
some islands such as the Canary Islands, all land on
the island is volcanic; (2) the land is fertile and good
for farming; (3) people are optimistic and believe an
eruption  is  unlikely;  and  (4)  they  do  not  have  any
choice as to where they live—for example, they may
be  limited  by  economics.  One  study  of  perception
evaluated volcanic activity in Hawaii and found that a
person’s age and length of residence near a volcanic
hazard are signiﬁcant factors in a person’s knowledge
of volcanic activity and possible adjustments.28 One
reason  the  evacuation  of  60,000  people  before  the
1991  eruption  of  Mt.  Pinatubo  was  successful  was
that the government had provided a program to edu-
cate people concerning the dangers from violent ash
eruptions with debris ﬂows. A video depicting these
events was widely shown in the area before the erup-
tion,  and  it  helped  convince  local  ofﬁcials  and  resi-
dents that they faced a real and immediate threat.4

The science of volcanoes is becoming well known.
However,  good  science  is  not  sufﬁcient.  Probably
the  greatest  payoff  in  terms  of  reducing  volcanic
hazards  in  the  future  will  come  from  an  increased
understanding  of  human  and  societal  issues  that
come  up  during  an  emerging  potential  volcanic
crisis—that  is,  a  situation  in  which  the  science

Summary

283

suggests that a volcanic eruption is likely in the near
future. The development of improved communication
between  scientists,  emergency  managers,  educators,

media, and private citizens is particularly important.
The goal is to prevent a volcanic crisis from becoming
a volcanic disaster or catastrophe.20

Making The   Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About Mt. Unzen, Mt. Pinatubo, 
and Mount St. Helens to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. Compare the role of human pop-

ulation increase for the three
eruptions with projected popula-
tion increase in the next 50 years.

2. Compare the role of scientiﬁc
information in understanding
the three eruptions.

3. How is the study of volcanoes as

part of Earth systems science
helping us understand the risk
from future eruptions?

4. How was each eruption perceived

by people in the vicinity of the
eruption?

Summary

Volcanic eruptions often occur in
sparsely populated areas, but they
have a high potential to produce
catastrophes when they occur near
populated areas. Volcanic activity is
directly related to plate tectonics.
Most volcanoes are located at plate
boundaries, where magma is
produced as spreading or sinking
lithospheric plates interact with
other Earth material. The “ring of
ﬁre” is a region surrounding most of
the Paciﬁc Ocean (Paciﬁc plate) that
contains about two-thirds of the
world’s volcanoes.

Lava is magma that has been ex-

truded from a volcano; the activity of
different types of volcanoes is partly
determined by the differing silica
content and viscosity of their lavas.
Shield volcanoes occur at mid-ocean
ridges, such as Iceland, and over mid-
plate hot spots, such as the Hawaiian
Islands. Their common rock type is
basalt, and they are characterized by
nonexplosive lava ﬂows. Composite
volcanoes occur at subduction zones,
particularly around the Paciﬁc Rim,
for example, in the Paciﬁc Northwest
of the United States. They are com-

posed largely of andesite rock and
are characterized by explosive
eruptions and lava ﬂows. Volcanic
domes occur inland of subduction
zones; an example of a volcanic dome
is Mt. Lassen, California. They are
composed largely of rhyolite rock
and are highly explosive.

Features of volcanoes include

vents, craters, and calderas. Other
features of volcanic areas are hot
springs and geysers. Giant caldera-
forming eruptions are violent, but
rare, geologic events. After their ex-
plosive beginning, they often resurge
and may present a volcanic hazard for
a million years or longer. Recent uplift
and earthquakes at the Long Valley
caldera in California are reminders of
the potential hazard.

Primary effects of volcanic activity

include lava ﬂows, pyroclastic haz-
ards, and, occasionally, the emission
of poisonous gases. Hydraulic chilling
and the construction of walls have
been used in attempts to control lava
ﬂows. These methods have had mixed
success and require further evalua-
tion. Pyroclastic hazards include vol-
canic ash falls, which may cover large

areas with carpets of ash; ash ﬂows,
or hot avalanches, which move as fast
as 100 km per hour down the side of a
volcano; and lateral blasts, which can
be very destructive. Secondary effects
of volcanic activity include debris
ﬂows and mudﬂows, generated when
melting snow and ice or precipitation
mixes with volcanic ash. These ﬂows
can devastate an area many kilome-
ters from the volcano. All of these ef-
fects have occurred in the recent his-
tory of the Cascade Range of the
Paciﬁc Northwest, and there is no rea-
son to believe that they will not occur
there in the future.

Sufﬁcient monitoring of seismic
activity; thermal, magnetic, and hy-
drologic properties; and topographic
changes, combined with knowledge of
the recent geologic history of volca-
noes, may eventually result in reliable
forecasting of volcanic activity. Fore-
casts of eruptions have been success-
ful, particularly for Hawaiian volca-
noes and Mt. Pinatubo in the
Philippines. On a worldwide scale,
however, it is unlikely that we will be
able to accurately forecast most vol-
canic activity in the near future.

284

CHAPTER 8

Volcanic Activity

Apart from psychological adjust-
ment to losses, the primary human
adjustment to volcanic activity is evac-
uation. Perception of the volcanic haz-
ard is apparently a function of age and
length of residency near the hazard.

Some people have little choice but to
live near a volcano. Education plays an
important role in informing people
about the hazards of volcanoes.

The goal of reducing the volcanic
hazard is focusing on human and so-

cietal issues through communication,
with the objective of preventing a vol-
canic crisis from becoming a volcanic
disaster or catastrophe.

Magma is generated at plate bound-
aries and hot spots that change posi-
tion and progress only slowly over
time periods of interest to people.
However, when a volcano becomes
active, there are important changes
in the earthquakes it produces and
the gases it releases as magma
moves toward the surface. These
changes alert us and help predict
eruptions.

Hazardous Earth Processes,
Risk Assessment, and Per-
ceptions Volcanoes are one of our
most violent natural hazards. Yet
people living in the shadow of a vol-
cano that has been dormant for a
few hundred years may scarcely
know it is there, and the potential
threat of future eruptions may be
unknown or not perceived as a
threat. In areas with more frequent
eruptions, such as Hawaii, people

generally are aware of the risk, hav-
ing lived with daily news reports of
ongoing eruptions that may last for
decades. In other words, if eruptions
are frequent, people’s perception of
the hazard increases.

Scientific Knowledge and 
Values We have learned a great deal
about how volcanoes function, the
rocks they produce, and the hazards
they present. However, values some-
times clash. For example, some peo-
ple in the Hawaiian Islands view the
volcanoes in a spiritual and religious
light. Volcanic gases, magma, and
lands are the breath and life of the
volcanic goddess Pele, not to be used
to produce geothermal energy or
cover over with urban development.
Removing bits of Pele’s volcanic rocks
from the island is believed to bring
bad luck to the thief.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
When humans live close to active vol-
canoes, the consequences can be cata-
strophic. Volcanic soil is generally
rich, and population centers often de-
velop in broad agricultural-based val-
leys downslope from volcanoes. In
addition, large urban centers, includ-
ing Seattle, Washington, and Mexico
City, are uncomfortably close to ac-
tive volcanoes. In some cases, such as
island cities like Puerto de la Cruz on
Tenerife, Canary Islands, the entire
island is part of a large volcanic cen-
ter. There is no alternative for the is-
land people other than to live in a po-
tentially hazardous area. As
population centers and cities near
volcanoes grow and attract more peo-
ple in the next 100 years, the volcanic
hazard will become more serious to
millions of additional people.

part of the internal system of Earth.

that it is a sample of andesite.
What might you tell your grand-
parents about the type of volcano

geologic environment, and the

type of volcanic activity that likely
produced it?

2. In our discussion of adjustment to
and perception of volcanic hazards,
we established that people’s percep-
tions and what they will do in case of
an eruption are associated with both
their proximity to the hazard and
their knowledge of volcanic
processes and necessary adjust-
ments. With this association in

mind, develop a public relations pro-
gram that could alert people to a po-
tential volcanic hazard. Keep in
mind that the tragedy associated
with the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz
(see Chapter 5) was, in part, due to
political and economic factors that
inﬂuenced the apathetic attitude to-
ward the hazard map prepared for
that area. Some people were afraid
that the hazard map would result in
lower property values in some areas.

Rivers and 
Flooding

Learning Objectives
Water covers about 70 percent of Earth’s surface and is critical to supporting life on the planet.
However, water can also cause a signiﬁcant hazard to human life and property in certain situations,
such as a ﬂood. Flooding is the most universally experienced natural hazard. Flooding in the United
States is the most common and costly natural hazard we face. Floodwaters have killed more than
10,000 people in the United States since 1900, and property damage from ﬂooding exceeds $5 billion
a year. Flooding is a natural process that will remain a major hazard as long as people choose to live
and work in ﬂood-prone areas. In this chapter we focus on the following learning objectives:

• Know the major

adjustments to ﬂooding
and which are
environmentally
preferable

• Know the potential

effects of channelization
and the beneﬁts of

• Understand basic river

Case History
Pakistan Floods of 2010 with Implications for the United States

Water covers about 
70 percent of Earth’s
surface and is critical
to supporting life
on the planet.
However, water
can also cause a
signiﬁcant hazard
to human life and
property in certain
situations, such

as a ﬂood. The
global im-

pact of

ﬂooding 

is shown in Figure 9.1. Notice that
Asia suffers the greatest number of
people killed or affected, along with
the greatest economic loss, due to
ﬂooding. This reﬂects the high human
population along rivers in Asia, and
land use changes linked to a climate
with intense precipitation.1

A monsoon refers to a seasonal shift
in wind pattern and precipitation pat-
terns (i.e., dry winter to wet summer).
For example, in Arizona, summer
monsoonal conditions often bring
spectacular thunderstorms and ﬂash
ﬂoods to the Tucson area. The Asian
monsoon brings several months of
summer rain to India, Pakistan, and
China. Some locations in India on the
slopes of the Himalayas have annual
rainfall as great as 25 m (83 ft),
mostly in the 4-month summer pe-
riod. In July and August 2010, the
greatest monsoon rains in decades
caused catastrophic ﬂooding in 
Pakistan. During summer months,
low-pressure, moisture-laden air
moves north from the Indian
Ocean and Arabian Sea. In the

summer months of July and August

2010, strong monsoon storms moved
through Pakistan. Annual rainfall in
Pakistan is 25–50 cm (10–20 in)
(mostly in July and August). On July
29, more than 30 cm (12 in) of rain fell
on the headwaters of the Indus River
that ﬂows south through Pakistan to
the sea. The result was catastrophic
ﬂooding.

The 2010 Pakistan ﬂoods killed
about 1,600 people, and 20 million
people were affected. Entire villages
were washed away, and thousands of
homes were ﬂooded. Floodwaters cov-
ered about 557,000 ha (1.4 million
acres) of agriculture land, and about
10,000 cows were killed.2 The intense
monsoon rains were a natural event,
but some people have speculated that
human processes played a role in the
devastation. The population of Pak-
istan has grown greatly; in 1951, it was
about 34 million, and in 2010, it was
170 million. Pakistan is the sixth 
most populous country on Earth. 
As Pakistan’s population grew, more of
the country’s ﬂood plains with forest
and wetlands were converted to agri-
cultural productivity. Urban areas grew,

and natural drainage was modiﬁed
and clogged with sediment. A map
of Pakistan with some of the areas
that ﬂooded in 2010 is shown on
Figure 9.2a. Notice that the country
is drained from the mountains to the
north to the Arabian Sea by the Indus
River. Most people in Pakistan live

close to the river, and the huge increase
in population in recent decades has
placed millions of people at risk.
The most damaging ﬂoods in

terms of lives lost in 2010 occurred
in the northern part of the river
basin, close to the high mountains.
However, ﬂood waters moved down-

river, ﬂooding the length of the
country (Figure 9.2b). The damage
to Pakistan from the ﬂoods was un-
precedented, as about 6 million peo-
ple were forced from their homes,
sanitation conditions deteriorated,
and people suffered greatly.

What does the Pakistan ﬂooding of
2010 have to do with the ﬂood hazard
in the United States? We are a larger,
much more wealthy country than Pak-
istan, with lower population growth,
but we also have a signiﬁcant ﬂood
hazard. For example, in early spring
2009, the Red River in North Dakota
and Minnesota ﬂooded once again,
with record high ﬂow. People worked
around the clock to reinforce ﬂood de-
fenses, which included high walls con-
sisting of millions of sandbags. Thou-
sands of ﬂoodplain residences were
evacuated from Fargo, North Dakota,
and across the river at Moorhead,
Minnesota. Several hundred large
sandbags holding a ton of sand were
dropped from helicopters in places
where dikes were failing. All this reac-
tive work helped during the ﬂood, but,
clearly, we need to rethink our philos-
ophy of how we adjust to the ﬂood
hazard in the United States. As popu-
lation continues to grow, we need to
reduce the ﬂood hazard in ways that
do not require massive response but
are proactive. We need plans for fu-
ture ﬂood hazard reduction that do
not require massive evacuation from
ﬂood-prone areas but that avoid the
hazard through land use. That is a
proactive solution for future ﬂooding
in Pakistan as well.

Although ﬂooding may be caused

by several processes, including coastal
ﬂooding from a hurricane, in this
chapter we will focus on river ﬂood-
ing. We will discuss ﬂooding from
several perspectives, including river
processes, effects of land-use changes
on ﬂooding, effects of ﬂooding, and
how ﬂooding may be minimized.

CHAPTER 9

Rivers and Flooding

9.1 Rivers: Historical Use
For more than 200 years, Americans have lived and
worked on ﬂoodplains, enticed to do so by the rich
alluvial (i.e., stream-deposited) soil, abundant water
supply, ease of waste disposal, and proximity to the
commerce  that  has  developed  along  the  rivers.  Of
course,  building  houses,  industry,  public  buildings,
and  farms  on  a  ﬂoodplain  invites  disaster,  but  too
many ﬂoodplain residents have refused to recognize
the natural ﬂoodway of the river for what it is: part
of the natural river system. The ﬂoodplain, the ﬂat
surface adjacent to the river channel that is periodi-
cally inundated by ﬂoodwater, is, in fact, produced by
the process of ﬂooding (Figures 9.3a and 9.4). If the
ﬂoodplain  and  its  relationship  to  the  river  are  not
recognized, ﬂood control and drainage of wetlands,
including  ﬂoodplains,  become  prime  concerns.  It  is
not an oversimpliﬁcation to say that as the pioneers
moved  west,  they  had  a  rather  set  procedure  for
modifying  the  land:  First,  clear  the  land  by  cutting
and burning the trees and then modify the natural
drainage.  Two  parallel  trends  developed  from  that
historical precedent: an accelerating program to con-
trol  ﬂoods,  matched  by  an  even  greater  growth  of

ﬂood  damages.  In  this  chapter,  we  will  consider
ﬂooding as a natural aspect of river processes and ex-
amine the successes and failures of traditional meth-
ods  of  ﬂood  control.  We  will  also  discuss  river
restoration attempts that work with the natural river
processes rather than against them.

9.2 Streams and Rivers
Streams  and  rivers  are  part  of  the  water,  or  hydro-
logic, cycle, and hydrology is the study of this cycle.
The hydrologic cycle involves the transport of water
by evaporation from Earth’s surface, primarily from
the oceans, to the atmosphere and, via surface and
subsurface runoff from the land, back again to the
oceans. Some of the water that falls on the land as
rain or snow infiltrates soils and rocks; some evap-
orates; and the rest drains, or runs off, following a
course  determined  by  the  local  topography.  This
runoff ﬁnds its way to streams, which may merge to
form  a  larger  stream  or  a  river. Streams  and  rivers
differ  only  in  size;  that  is,  streams  are  small  rivers.
However,  geologists  commonly  use  the  term  stream
for any body of water that ﬂows in a channel. 

Based on the geology, there are two basic types of
rivers:  the more common alluvial rivers where bed
and banks of the river are sediment such as gravel
and sand, or the less common bedrock rivers where
bedrock is commonly exposed in the bed and banks.
Bedrock streams and rivers are usually, but not al-
ways by any means, found in steep mountain areas.
For example, sections of bedrock rivers (such as the
Great Falls of the Potomac River) are located in the
eastern United States at the boundary between the
Piedmont (hard rocks) and Coastal Plane (soft rocks
and  sediment)  known  as  the  Fall  Line,  because
rivers  have  a  steeper  gradient  there,  and  there  are
bedrock rapids and water falls. Cities such as Troy,
New  York,  Trenton,  New  Jersey,  Washington  D.C.,
Richmond  Virginia,  Raleigh,  North  Carolina,  Co-
lumbia,  South  Carolina,  and  Augusta  Georgia  were
sited on the Fall Line. It was difﬁcult to move goods
further  upriver  by  boat  past  falls  and  rapids,  but
cities are not always sited at a barrier. More impor-
tantly,  the  steep  gradients  of  the  larger  Fall  Line
rivers provided water power in the nineteenth cen-
tury (prior to coal use) for emerging manufacturing
industries.  The  region  drained  by  a  single  river  or
river system is called a drainage basin, or watershed
(Figure 9.5a).

CHAPTER 9

Rivers and Flooding

A river’s slope, or gradient, is the vertical drop of
the  channel  over  some  horizontal  distance.  In  gen-
eral, the slope is steepest at higher elevations in the
drainage  basin  and  levels  off  as  the  stream  ap-
proaches its base level. The base level of a stream is
the  theoretical  lowest  level  to  which  a  river  may
erode. Most often, the base level is at sea level, al-
though  a  river  may  have  a  temporary  base  level
such  as  a  lake.  Rivers  ﬂow  downhill  to  their  base
level, and a graph of elevation of a river against dis-
tance downstream is called the longitudinal proﬁle
(Figure  9.5b).  A  river  usually  has  a  steeper-sided
and deeper valley at high elevations near its head-
waters  than  closer  to  its  base  level,  where  a  wide
ﬂoodplain may be present (Figure 9.5c, d). At higher
elevations,  the  steeper  slope  of  the  river  causes
deeper  erosion  of  the  valley.  Increased  erosion  is
due to the higher flow velocity of the river water
produced by the steeper channel slopes.

undesirable locations, produce the sediment pollution
discussed in Chapter 14.
9.4 River Velocity, Discharge,

Erosion, and Sediment
Deposition

Rivers  are  the  basic  transportation  system  of  the
part  of  the  rock  cycle  that  involves  erosion  and 
deposition of sediments. They are a primary erosion
agent in the sculpting of our landscape. The velocity,
or speed, of the water in a river varies along its course,
affecting both erosion and deposition of sediment.

Discharge (Q) is the volume of water moving by a
particular location in a river per unit time. It is re-
ported  in  cubic  meters  per  second  (cms)  or  cubic
feet per second (cfs). Discharge is calculated as

Q = W  * D  * V

9.3 Sediment in Rivers
The total quantity of sediment carried in a river, called
its  total  load,  includes  the  bed  load,  the  suspended
load, and the dissolved load. The bed load moves by the
bouncing,  rolling,  or  skipping  of  particles  along  the
bottom of the channel. The bed load of most rivers,
usually  composed  of  sand  and  gravel,  is  a  relatively
small  component,  generally  accounting  for  less  than
10 percent of the total load. The suspended load, com-
posed  mainly  of  silt  and  clay,  is  carried  above  the
streambed by the ﬂowing water. The suspended load
accounts  for  nearly  90  percent  of  the  total  load  and
makes rivers look muddy. The dissolved load is carried
in  chemical  solution  and  is  derived  from  chemical
weathering of minerals in rock, sediment and soil in
the  drainage  basin.  The  dissolved  load  may  make
stream water taste salty if it contains large amounts of
sodium  and  chloride.  It  may  also  make  the  stream
water “hard” if the dissolved load contains high con-
centrations  of  calcium  and  magnesium.  The  most
common constituents of the dissolved load are bicar-
bonate  ions 
,  calcium
(Ca2 +)
, and magnesium ions
ions
(Mg +)
. As discussed in Chapter 3, an ion is an atom
or a molecule with a positive or negative charge result-
ing from a gain or loss of electrons. Typically, the ﬁve
previously  mentioned  ions  constitute  more  than  90
percent of a river’s dissolved load. It is the suspended
and  bed  loads  of  streams  that,  when  deposited  in

Q = W  * D  * V

where Q is discharge (cubic meters per second), W is
the width of ﬂow in meters, D is depth of ﬂow in me-
ters, and V is mean velocity of ﬂow (meters per sec-
ond).  The  equation 
is  known  as
the continuity equation and is one of the most im-
portant  relationships  in  understanding  the  ﬂow  of
water in rivers. We assume that if there are no addi-
tions  or  deletions  of  ﬂow  along  a  given  length  of
river, then discharge is constant. It follows that if the
cross-sectional  area  of  ﬂow 
decreases,  the
velocity of the water must increase. You can observe
this change with a garden  hose. Turn on the water
and observe the velocity of the water as it exits the
hose.  Then  put  your  thumb  partly  over  the  end  of
the  hose,  reducing  the  area  where  the  water  ﬂows
out of the hose, and observe the increase in the ve-
locity.  This  concept  explains  why  a  narrow  river
channel in a canyon has a higher velocity of ﬂow. It is
also  the  reason  that  rapids  are  common  in  narrow
canyons.  In  general,  a  faster-ﬂowing  river  has  the
ability to erode its banks more than a slower-moving
one. Streams that ﬂow from mountains onto plains
may form fan-shaped deposits known as alluvial fans
(Figure 9.6). Rivers ﬂowing into the ocean or some
other body of still water may deposit sediments that
form  a  delta,  a  triangular  or  irregular-shaped  land-
mass extending into the sea or a lake (Figure 9.7).
The  ﬂood  hazard  associated  with  alluvial  fans  and
deltas  is  different  from  hazards  in  a  river  valley
and ﬂoodplain environment because rivers entering

FIGURE 9.7 Delta The delta of the Mississippi River. In this false-color image, vegetation appears red,
and sediment-laden waters are white or light blue; deeper water with less suspended sediment is a
darker blue. The system of distributary channels of the river in the delta in the far right of the photograph
looks something like a bird’s foot, and, in fact, the Mississippi River delta is an example of a bird’s-foot
delta. The distributary channels carry sediment out into the Gulf of Mexico, and, because wave action is
not strong in the gulf, the river dominates the delta system. Distance across the image is about 180 km
(112 mi). Other rivers ﬂow into a more active coastal environment. Such deltas have a relatively straight
coastline, rather than bird’s-foot shape, and are considered to be wave dominated. Other deltas are be-
tween the end points of river domination and wave domination, as, for example, the Nile delta with its
beautiful triangular shape and its convex shoreline protruding into the Mediterranean Sea. (University of
Washington Libraries)

CHAPTER 9

Rivers and Flooding

alluvial fan or delta environments often split into a
system of distributary channels. That is, the river no
longer  has  only  one  main  channel  but  has  several
channels that carry ﬂoodwaters to different parts of
the fan or delta. Furthermore, these channels char-
acteristically  may  change  position  rapidly  during
ﬂoods,  producing  a  ﬂood  hazard  that  is  difﬁcult  to
predict.3 For  example,  a  large  recreational  vehicle
(RV) park on the delta of the Ventura River in south-
ern California ﬂooded four times in the 1990s. The
RV park was constructed across a historically active
distributary channel of the Ventura River. However,
before  the  construction  of  the  park,  the  engineers
mapping the potential ﬂood hazards on the site did
not recognize that the park was located on a delta.
This story emphasizes the importance of studying a
river’s ﬂooding history as part of ﬂood hazard evalu-
ation (see A Closer Look: History of a River).

The reasons erosion or deposition occurs in a spe-
ciﬁc area of river channel or on alluvial fans or deltas
are complex, but they can be correlated to the physi-
cal properties of the river:

• Change in channel width, depth, or slope
• Composition of channel bed and banks (rock,

gravel, sand, silt, or clay)

• Type and amount of vegetation
• Land use, such as clearing a forest for agricul-

ture (discussed in Section 9.5)

For example, deposition on alluvial fans occurs in
part  because  of  changes  in  the  shape  and  slope  of
distributary channels. They often become wider and
shallower  with  a  decreasing  slope,  and  this  change
decreases the velocity of ﬂow, favoring deposition. In
general,  as  the  velocity  of  ﬂow  in  a  river  increases,
the size of the bed load it can transport increases, as
does the volume of suspended load consisting of silt
and  clay-sized  particles.  Speciﬁc  relationships  be-
tween ﬂow velocity, discharge, and sediment trans-
port are beyond the scope of our discussion here.

The  largest  particle  (diameter  in  millimeters  or
centimeters)  a  river  may  transport  is  called  its
competency.  The  total  load,  by  mass  or  weight,  of
sediment  that  a  river  carries  in  a  given  period  of
time is called its capacity.
9.5 Effects of Land Use Changes
Streams and rivers are open systems that generally
maintain  a  rough  dynamic  equilibrium,  or  steady
state  between  the  work  done  (i.e.,  the  sediment

transported  by  the  stream)  and  the  load  imposed
(i.e., the sediment delivered to the stream from trib-
utaries  and  hill  slopes).  A  stream  tends  to  have  a
slope and cross-sectional shape that provides the ve-
locity  of  ﬂow  necessary  to  do  the  work  of  moving
the sediment load.6 An increase or a decrease in the
amount of water or sediment received by the stream
usually brings about changes in the channel’s slope
or  cross-sectional  shape,  effectively  changing  the
velocity of the water. The change of velocity may, in
turn, increase or decrease the amount of sediment
carried  in  the  system.  Therefore,  land-use  changes
that affect the stream’s volume of sediment or water
volume may set into motion a series of events that
results in a new dynamic equilibrium.

Consider,  for  example,  a  land  use  change  from
forest  to  agricultural  row  crops.  This  change  will
cause increased soil erosion and an increase in the
sediment load supplied to the stream because agri-
cultural  lands  have  higher  soil  erosion  rates  than
forested lands. At ﬁrst, the stream will be unable to
transport the entire load and will deposit more sed-
iment,  increasing  the  slope  of  the  channel.  The
steeper slope of the channel will increase the velocity
of water and allow the stream to move more sedi-
ment. If the base level is ﬁxed, the slope will con-
tinue to increase by deposition in the channel until
the  increase  in  velocity  is  sufﬁcient  to  carry  the
new load. If the notion that deposition of sediment
increases channel slope is counterintuitive to you,
see Figure 9.8 for an illustration of this principle.
A  new  dynamic  equilibrium  may  be  reached,  pro-
vided that the rate of sediment increase levels out

History of a River

In 1905, philosopher George San-
tayana said, “Those who cannot re-
member the past are condemned to
repeat it.” Scholars may debate the
age-old question of whether cycles
in human history repeat themselves,
but the repetitive nature of natural
hazards, such as ﬂoods, is undisput-
ed.4 Better understanding of the his-
torical behavior of a river is,
therefore, valuable in estimating its
present and future ﬂood hazards.
Consider the February 1992 Ventura
River ﬂood in southern California.
The ﬂood severely damaged the Ven-
tura Beach Recreational Vehicle (RV)
Resort, which had been constructed
a few years earlier on an active dis-
tributary channel of the Ventura
River delta. Although the recurrence
interval is approximately 22 years
(Figure 9.A), earlier engineering
studies suggested that the RV park

would not be inundated by a ﬂood
with a recurrence interval of 100
years. What went wrong?
• Planners did not recognize that

the RV park was constructed on a
historically active distributary
channel of the Ventura River delta.
In fact, early reports did not even
mention a delta.

• Engineering models that predict
ﬂood inundation are inaccurate
when evaluating distributary
channels on river deltas where ex-
tensive channel ﬁll and scour as
well as lateral movement of the
channel are likely to occur.

• Historical documents, such as
maps dating back to 1855 and
more-recent aerial photographs
that showed the channels, were
not evaluated. Figure 9.B shows
that maps rendered from these

documents suggest that the dis-
tributary channel was in fact pre-
sent in 1855.5

Clearly, the historical behavior of

the river was not evaluated as part of
the ﬂood-hazard evaluation. If it had
been, the site would have been de-
clared unacceptable for develop-
ment, given that a historically active
channel was present. Nevertheless,
necessary permits were issued for de-
velopment of the park, and, in fact,
the park was rebuilt after the ﬂood.
Before 1992, the distributary channel
carried discharges during 1969, 1978,
and 1982. After the 1992 ﬂood event,
the channel carried ﬂoodwaters in
the winters of 1993, 1995, and 1998,
again ﬂooding the RV park. During
the 1992 ﬂoods, the discharge in-
creased from less than 25 m3 per sec-
ond (883 ft3 per second) to a peak of

FIGURE 9.A Flooding of
California’s Ventura
Beach RV Resort in Feb-
ruary 1992 The RV park
was built directly across a his-
torically active distributary
channel of the Ventura River
delta. The recurrence interval of
this ﬂood is approximately 22
years. A similar ﬂood occurred
again in 1995. Notice that U.S.
Highway 101 along the Paciﬁc
Coast is completely closed by
the ﬂood event. (Mark J.

1,322 m3 per second (46,683 ft3 per
second) in only about 4 hours! This is
approximately twice as much as the
daily high discharge of the Colorado
River through the Grand Canyon in
the summer, when it is navigated by
river rafters. This is an incredible dis-
charge for a relatively small river with
a drainage area of only about 585
km2 (226 mi2). The ﬂood occurred
during daylight, and one person was

killed. If the ﬂood had occurred at
night, many more deaths would
have been recorded. A warning sys-
tem that has been developed for the
park has, so far, been effective in pro-
viding early warning of an impend-
ing ﬂood. The park, with or without
the RVs and people, is a “sitting
duck.” Its vulnerability was dramati-
cally illustrated in 1995 and 1998,
when winter ﬂoods again swept

through the park. Although the
warning system worked and the park
was successfully evacuated, the facil-
ity was again severely damaged. Fol-
lowing the 1992 ﬂood, there was a
movement to purchase the park and
restore the land to a more natural
delta environment; a good move
that by 2011 has not materialized
and the RV park remains a sitting
duck for the next big ﬂood.

dam.  Upstream,  at  the  head  of  the  reservoir,  the
water in the stream will slow down, causing deposi-
tion  of  sediment.  Downstream,  the  water  coming
out  below  the  dam  will  have  little  sediment,  since
most of it has been trapped in the reservoir. As a
result,  the  stream  may  have  the  capacity  to  trans-
port  additional  sediment;  if  this  happens,  channel
erosion  will  predominate  over  deposition  down-
stream of the dam. The slope of the stream will then
decrease until new equilibrium conditions are reached
(Figure 9.10). (We will return to the topic of dams
on rivers in Chapter 13.)

and the channel slope and shape can adjust before
another  land-use  change  occurs.  Suppose  the  re-
verse  situation  now  occurs—that  is,  farmland  is
converted  to  forest.  The  sediment  load  to  the
stream from the land will decrease, and less sedi-
ment  will  be  deposited  in  the  stream  channel.
Erosion  of  the  channel  will  eventually  lower  the
slope; the lowering of the slope will, in turn, lower
the velocity of the water. The predominance of ero-
sion  over  deposition  will  continue  until  equilib-
rium  between  the  total  load  imposed  and  work
done is achieved again.

The sequence of change just described occurred in
parts  of  the  southeastern  United  States.  On  the
Piedmont,  between  the  Appalachian  Mountains
and  the  coastal  plain,  forestland
had been cleared for farming by the
1800s. The land use change from for-
est  to  farming  accelerated  soil  ero-
sion  and  subsequent  deposition  of
sediment in the stream (Figure 9.9).
This acceleration caused the preagri-
culture  channel  to  ﬁll  with  sedi-
ment, as shown in  Figure  9.9.  After
1930,  the  land  reverted  to  pine
forests,  and  this  reforestation,  in
conjunction  with  soil  conservation
measures,  reduced  the  sediment
load delivered to streams. Thus, for-
merly  muddy  streams  choked  with
sediment  had  cleared  and  eroded
their channels by 1969.

9.6 Channel Patterns

and Floodplain
Formation

The conﬁguration of the channel as
seen  in  an  aerial  view  is  called  the
channel  pattern.  Channel  patterns
can  be  braided  or  meandering,  or
both characteristics may be found in
the  same  river.  Braided channels
(Figure  9.11)  are  characterized  by
numerous  gravel  bars  and  islands
that divide and reunite the channel.
A  steep  slope  and  coarse  sediment
favor transport of bed load material
important  in  the  development  of
gravel  bars  that  form  the  “islands”
that  divide  and  subdivide  the  ﬂow.
The formation of the braided chan-
nel pattern, as with many other river
forms,  results  from  the  interaction

of ﬂowing water and moving sediment. If the river’s
longitudinal  proﬁle  is  steep  and  there  is  an  abun-
dance of coarse bed load sediment, the channel pat-
tern is likely to be braided. Braided channels tend to
be  wide  and  shallow  compared  with  meandering
rivers.  They  are  often  associated  with  steep  rivers
ﬂowing through areas that are being rapidly uplifted
by  tectonic  processes.  They  are  also  common  in
rivers  receiving  water  from  melting  glaciers  that
provide a lot of coarse sediment.

Some channels contain meanders, which are bends
that  migrate  back  and  forth  across  the  ﬂoodplain
(Figure  9.12a).  Although  we  know  what  meander
bends look like and what the water and sediment do
in  the  bends,  we  do  not  know  for  sure  why  rivers
meander. On the outside of a bend, sometimes re-
ferred to as the cut bank, the water moves faster dur-
ing high ﬂow events, causing more bank erosion; on
the inside of a curve, water moves more slowly, and
sediment  is  deposited,  forming  point  bars.  As  this
differential erosion and sediment deposition contin-
ues,  meanders  migrate  laterally  by  erosion  on  the
cut banks and by deposition on point bars, a process
that is prominent in constructing and maintaining
some ﬂoodplains (Figure 9.12b). Overbank deposi-
tion, or deposition beyond the banks of a river, dur-
ing ﬂoods causes layers of relatively ﬁne sediments,
such as sand and silt, to build upward; this accumu-
lation is also important in the development of ﬂood-
plains. Much of the sediment transported in rivers
is  periodically  stored  by  deposition  in  the  channel

and on the adjacent ﬂoodplain. These areas, collec-
tively called the riverine environment, are the natural
domain of the river.

Meandering  channels  often  contain  a  series  of
regularly  spaced  pools  and  rifﬂes  (Figure  9.13,
page 302). Pools are deep areas produced by scour,
or  erosion  at  high  ﬂow,  and  characterized  at  low
ﬂow  by  relatively  deep,  slow  movement  of  water.
Pools are places in which you might want to take a
summer swim. Rifﬂes are shallow areas produced by
depositional  processes  at  high  ﬂow  and  character-
ized by relatively shallow, fast-moving water at low
flow.  Pools  and  riffles  have  important  environ-
mental signiﬁcance: The alternation of deep, slow-
moving  water  with  shallow,  fast-moving  water  in
pools  and  rifﬂes  produces  a  variable  physical  and
hydrologic  environment  and  increased  biological
diversity.7 For example, ﬁsh may feed in rifﬂes and
seek shelter in pools, and pools have different types
of insects than are found in rifﬂes.

Having  presented  some  of  the  characteristics
and  processes  of  ﬂow  of  water  and  sediment  in
rivers, we will now discuss the process of ﬂooding
in greater detail.

9.7 River Flooding
The  natural  process  of  overbank  flow is  termed
flooding (see Figure 9.4). Most river flooding is
a  function  of  the  total  amount  and  distribution
of precipitation in the drainage basin, the rate at

The  channel  discharge  at  the  point  where  water
overﬂows the channel is called the ﬂood discharge and
is used as an indication of the magnitude of the ﬂood
(see  A  Closer  Look:  Magnitude  and  Frequency  of
Floods). The height of the water in a river at any given
time is called the stage. The term ﬂood stage frequently
connotes that the water surface has reached a high-
water  condition  likely  to  cause  damage  to  personal
property. This deﬁnition is based on human percep-
tion of the event, so the elevation that is considered
ﬂood stage depends on human use of the ﬂoodplain.8
Therefore, the magnitude of a ﬂood may or may not
coincide with the extent of property damage.

which precipitation infiltrates the rock or soil, and
the topography. Some floods, however, result from
rapid melting of ice and snow in the spring or, on
rare occasions, from the failure of a dam. Finally,
land  use  can  greatly  affect  flooding  in  small
drainage basins.

Flash Floods and 
Downstream Floods
It is useful to distinguish between ﬂash and down-
stream ﬂoods (Figure 9.14, page 302). Flash ﬂoods
occur in the upper parts of drainage basins and are

Look

Magnitude and Frequency of Floods

Flooding is intimately related to the
amount and intensity of precipita-
tion and runoff. Catastrophic ﬂoods
reported on television and in news-
papers are often produced by infre-
quent, large, intense storms. Smaller
ﬂoods or ﬂows may be produced by
less intense storms that occur more
frequently. All ﬂow events that can
be measured or estimated from a
stream-gauging station (Figure 9.C)
can be arranged in order of their
magnitude of discharge, generally
measured in cubic meters per second
(Figure 9.D). The list of annual peak
ﬂows—that is, the largest ﬂow each
year or the annual series so arranged
(see data for the Patrick River in the
table adjacent to Figure 9.E)—can be
plotted on a discharge-frequency

curve by deriving the recurrence 
interval (R) for each ﬂow from the 
relationship

R = (N + 1)/M

where R is a recurrence interval in
years, N is the number of years of
record, and M is the rank of the indi-
vidual ﬂow within the recorded years
(Figure 9.E).9 For example, in Figure
9.E, the highest ﬂow for 9 years of
data for the stream is approximately
280 m3 per second (9,888 ft3 per 
second) and has a rank M equal 
to 1.10 The recurrence interval of 
this ﬂood is

R = N + 1

which means that a ﬂood with a
magnitude equal to or exceeding
280 m3 per second can be expected
about every 10 years; we call this a
10-year ﬂood. The probability that
the 10-year ﬂood will happen in any
one year is 1/10, or 0.1 (10 percent).
The probability that the 100-year
ﬂood will occur in any one year is
1/100, or 0.01 (1 percent). The curve
in Figure 9.E is extended by extra-
polation to estimate the discharge
of the 20-year ﬂood at 450 cms.
Extrapolation is risky and shouldn’t
extend much beyond two times the
length of recorded values of dis-
charge. Studies of many streams and
rivers show that channels are
formed and maintained by bankfull
discharge, deﬁned as a ﬂow with a
recurrence interval of about 1.5 years
(27 m3 per second in Figure 9.E).
Bankfull is the ﬂow that just ﬁlls the
channel. Therefore, we can expect a
stream to emerge from its banks
and cover part of the ﬂoodplain
with water and sediment once every
year or so.

As ﬂow records are collected, we
can more accurately predict ﬂoods.
However, designing structures for a
10-year, 25-year, 50-year, or even
100-year ﬂood, or, in fact, any ﬂow, is
a calculated risk since predicting such
ﬂoods is based on a statistical proba-
bility. In the long term, a 25-year ﬂood
happens on the average of once every
25 years, but two 25-year ﬂoods could
occur in any given year, as could two
100-year ﬂoods!11 As long as we con-
tinue to build dams, highways, bridges,
homes, and other structures without
considering the effects on ﬂood-prone
areas, we can expect continued loss of
lives and property.

cause  ﬂooding  in  the  larger

although they can be quite se-

ﬂash ﬂood in June of 2010, fu-
eled  by  intense  rain,  roared
through a remote campground
along  the  banks  of  the  Little
Missouri  River 
in  western
Arkansas.  The  ﬂood  started
about  2  A.M. when  campers  in
tents and RVs were asleep. The
small river rose rapidly and in a
short  time  was  several  meters
deep and moving fast (roaring)

through  the  campground,  washing  tents,  cars,  RVs,
and  people  down  stream  valley  in the  dark.  The
power of the ﬂow tore up roads, peeling asphalt and
debarking  trees.  The  ﬂood  claimed  16  lives,  hospi-
talizing 20 others, and 60 people were rescued.

A  high-magnitude  ﬂash  ﬂood  that  occurred  in
July  1976  in  the  Front  Range  of  Colorado  was
caused by violent ﬂash ﬂoods, which are character-
ized  by  a  rapid  rise  in  ﬂoodwaters  in  response  to
precipitation. In addition, the ﬂash ﬂoods were nour-
ished  by  a  complex  system  of  thunderstorms  that
swept  through  several  canyons  west  of  Loveland,
delivering  up  to  25  cm  (9.8  in.)  of  rain.  This  brief
local ﬂood killed 139 people and caused more than
$35 million in damages to highways, roads, bridges,
homes,  and  small  businesses.  Most  of  the  damage
and  loss  of  life  occurred  in  the  Big  Thompson
Canyon, where hundreds of residents, campers, and
tourists  were  caught  with  little  or  no  warning.  Al-
though the storm and ﬂood were rare events in the
Front  Range  canyons,  comparable  ﬂoods  have  oc-
curred in the past and others can be expected in the
future.12–14 Interestingly, the U.S. Geological Survey
reports that about half of all the U.S. deaths during
ﬂash ﬂoods are related to automobiles. When people
attempt  to  drive  through  shallow,  fast-moving
ﬂoodwater, the strong lateral force of the water may
sweep  automobiles  off  the  road  into  deeper  water,

trapping  people  in  sinking  or  overturned  vehicles
(Figure 9.15).

It  is  the  large  downstream  ﬂoods,  such  as  the
1993  Mississippi  River  ﬂood  and  the  1997  Red
River, North Dakota, ﬂood, that usually make televi-
sion  and  newspaper  headlines.  Floodwaters  of  the
Red River, which ﬂows north to Canada, inundated
the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota, initiating the
evacuation  of  50,000  people,  causing  a  ﬁre  that
burned part of the city center and more than $1 billion
in damage (Figure 9.16). The Red River often ﬂoods
in  the  spring,  and  it  did  so  again  in  the  spring  of
2001,  when  heavy  rains  melted  snow  and  ice  on
frozen ground that did not allow inﬁltration of the
rain into the forest.

Downstream ﬂoods cover a wide area and are usu-
ally  produced  by  storms  of  long  duration  that  satu-
rate the soil and produce increased runoff. Flooding
on small tributary basins is limited, but the contribu-
tion of increased runoff from thousands of tributary
basins may cause a large ﬂood downstream. A ﬂood of
this kind is characterized by the downstream move-
ment of the ﬂoodwaters with a large rise and fall of
discharge  at  a  particular  location.15 Figure  9.17a
(page  305) shows  an  area  map  and  Figure  9.17b
shows the 257 km (160 mi) downstream migration of
a ﬂood crest on the Chattooga–Savannah River sys-
tem. It illustrates that a progressively longer time is

necessary for the rise and fall of water as the ﬂood
wave proceeds downstream. In addition, it dramati-
cally  shows  the  tremendous  increase  in  discharge
from low-ﬂow conditions to more than 1,700 m3 per
second  (60,000  ft3 per  second)  in  5  days.16 Figure
9.17c illustrates  the  same  ﬂood  in  terms  of  dis-
charge per unit area, eliminating the effect of down-
stream increase in discharge. This better illustrates
the  shape  and  form  of  the  ﬂood  peak  as  it  moves
downstream.16

9.8 Urbanization and Flooding
Human use of land in urban environments has in-
creased  both  the  magnitude  and  frequency  of
floods  in  small  drainage  basins  of  a  few  square
kilometers. The rate of increase is a function of the
percentage of the land that is covered with roofs,
pavement,  and  cement,  referred  to  as  impervious
cover (Figure  9.18),  and  the  percentage  of  area
served by storm sewers. Storm sewers are impor-
tant because they allow urban runoff from imper-
vious  surfaces  to  reach  stream  channels  much
more  quickly  than  in  natural  settings.  Therefore,
impervious cover and storm sewers are collectively
a  measure  of  the  degree  of  urbanization.  The
graph  in  Figure  9.19 (page  306)  shows  that  an
urban area with 40 percent impervious surface and
40 percent of its area served by storm sewers can
expect to have about three times as many floods as
before urbanization. This ratio applies to floods of
small  and  intermediate  frequency.  As  the  size  of
the  drainage  basin  increases,  however,  high-mag-
nitude  floods  with  frequencies  of  approximately

50 years are not significantly affected by urbaniza-
tion (Figure 9.20, page 306).

Floods  are  a  function  of  rainfall–runoff  relation-
ships, and urbanization causes a tremendous number
of changes in these relationships. One study showed
that  urban  runoff  from  large  storms  is  nearly  ﬁve
times  that  of  preurban  runoff.17 Estimates  of  dis-
charge  for  different  recurrence  intervals  at  different
degrees  of  urbanization  are  shown  in  Figure  9.21
(page 306). The estimates clearly indicate the tremen-
dous  increase  of  runoff  with  increasing  impervious
areas  and  storm  sewer  coverage.  However,  it  is  not
only  the  peak  discharge  that  causes  urban  ﬂooding.
Long-duration storms resulting from moderate precip-
itation can also cause ﬂooding if storm drains become
blocked with sediment and storm debris. In this case,
water begins to pond, causing ﬂooding in low areas. It
is analogous to water rising in a bathtub shower when
the drain becomes partly blocked by soap.

Urbanization causes increased runoff because less
water inﬁltrates the ground. Figure 9.22a (page 307)
shows a generalized hydrograph before urbanization.
Of particular importance is the lag time, deﬁned as the
time between when most of the rainfall occurs and a
ﬂood  is  produced.  Figure  9.22b shows  two  hydro-
graphs, before and after urbanization. Note the signif-
icant reduction in lag time after urbanization. Short
lag times, referred to as ﬂashy discharge, are character-
ized  by  rapid  rise  and  fall  of  ﬂoodwater.  Since  little
water inﬁltrates the soil, the low water or dry-season
ﬂow in urban streams, normally sustained by ground-
water  seepage  into  the  channel,  is  greatly  reduced.
This  reduction  in  ﬂow  effectively  concentrates  any
pollutants present and generally lowers the aesthetic
amenities of the stream.10

Relationship between the ratio of overbank ﬂows (i.e., after urban-
ization to before urbanization) and measure of urbanization. This
concept also refers to suburban and rural areas where in impervious
cover has increased from land use such as parking lots and build-
ings in shopping malls. For example, a ratio of 3 to 1, or simply 3,
means that, after urbanization, there are three ﬂoods for every one
there was before urbanization; that is, ﬂooding is three times as
common after urbanization. This ﬁgure shows that as the degree of
urbanization increases, the number of overbank ﬂows per year also
increases. (After Leopold, L. B. 1968. U.S. Geological Survey Circular 559)

shows the increase in mean annual ﬂood with increasing

Circular 559)

Increase in impervious area is not the only type
of  development  that  can  increase  ﬂooding.  Some
ﬂash  ﬂoods  have  occurred  because  bridges  built
across  small  streams  block  the  passage  of  ﬂoating
woody  debris,  causing  a  wave  of  water  to  move
downstream  when  the  debris  breaks  loose.  For  ex-
ample, on Friday, June 15, 1990, over 14 cm (5.5 in.)
of precipitation fell within approximately 4 hours in
some areas of eastern Ohio. Two tributaries of the
Ohio River, Wegee and Pipe Creeks, generated ﬂash
floods  near  the  small  town  of  Shadyside,  killing
21  people  and  leaving  13  people  missing  and  pre-
sumed  dead.  The  floods  were  described  as  5  m
(16 ft)-high walls of water that rushed through the
valley.  In  all,  approximately  70  houses  were  de-
stroyed and another 40 were damaged. Trailers and
houses were seen washing down the creeks, bobbing
like corks in the torrent. The wall of water was ap-
parently due to the failure of debris dams that had
developed  across  the  creeks  upstream  of  bridges.
Runoff  from  rainfall  had  washed  debris  into  the
creeks  from  side  slopes;  this  debris,  including  tree

about  10,000  in  the  twentieth  century)  lost
because  of  river  ﬂooding.  Tragically,  this  ﬁgure  is
low  compared  with  losses  suffered  by  developing
countries  that  lack  monitoring  facilities,  warning
systems,  and  effective  disaster  relief.8,18 Table  9.1
lists  some  severe  river  ﬂoods  that  occurred  in  the
United States from 1937 to 2010.

Factors That Cause Flood Damage
Factors  that  affect  the  damage  caused  by  floods
include:

• Land use on the ﬂoodplain
• Magnitude,  or  the  depth  and  velocity  of  the

water and frequency of ﬂooding

• Rate of rise and duration of ﬂooding
• Season (e.g., growing season on the ﬂoodplain)
• Sediment load deposited
• Effectiveness  of  forecasting,  warning,  and

emergency systems

trunks  and  other  material,  became  lodged  against
bridges,  creating  the  debris  dams.  When  the
bridges  could  no  longer  contain  the  weight  of  the
debris,  the  dams  broke  loose,  sending  surges  of
water  downstream.  This  scenario  has  been  played
and replayed in many ﬂash ﬂoods around the world.
All too often, the supports for bridges are too close
together to allow large debris to pass through; in-
stead, the debris accumulates on the upstream side
of the bridge, damming the stream and eventually
causing a ﬂood.

9.9 The Nature and Extent 

of Flood Hazards

Flooding is one of the most frequently experienced
natural  hazards.  In  the  United  States,  ﬂoods  were
the number-one type of disaster during the twentieth

Effects of Flooding
The  effects  of  ﬂooding  may  be  primary  (i.e.,  di-
rectly  caused  by  the  ﬂood)  or  secondary  (i.e.,
caused  by  disruption  and  malfunction  of  services
and systems due to the ﬂood).18 Primary effects in-
clude  injury,  loss  of  life,  and  damage  caused  by
swift  currents,  debris,  and  sediment  to  farms,
homes,  buildings,  railroads,  bridges,  roads,  and
communication  systems.  Erosion  and  deposition
of sediment in the rural and urban landscape may
also involve a loss of considerable soil and vegeta-
tion.  Secondary  effects  may  include  short-term
pollution  of  rivers,  hunger  and  disease,  and  dis-
placement  of  persons  who  have  lost  their  homes.
In addition, ﬁres may be caused by shorts in elec-
trical circuits or gas mains broken by ﬂooding and
associated erosion.18

9.10 Adjustments to 
Flood Hazards

Historically,  particularly  in  the  nineteenth  cen-
tury,  humans  responded  to  flooding  by  attempt-
ing to prevent the problem; that is, they modified
the  stream  by  creating  physical  barriers,  such  as

dams  or  levees,  or  by  straightening,  widening,
and  deepening  an  entire  stream  so  that  it  would
drain  the  land  more  efficiently.  Every  new  flood
control project has the effect of luring more peo-
ple  to  the  floodplain  in  the  false  hope  that  the
flood hazard is no longer significant. We have yet
to  build  a  dam  or  channel  capable  of  controlling
the  heaviest  runoff,  and  when  the  water  finally
exceeds the capacity of the structure, ﬂooding may
be extensive.18,19

In recent years, we have begun to recognize the
advantages of alternative adjustments to trying to
physically  prevent  flooding.  These  include  flood
insurance  and  controlling  the  land  use  on  ﬂood-
plains.  We  will  discuss  each  of  the  main  adjust-
ments with the realization that no one adjustment
is best in all cases. Rather, an integrated approach
to  minimizing  the  ﬂood  hazard  that  incorporates
the appropriate adjustments for a particular situa-
tion is preferable.

The Structural Approach
Physical Barriers. Measures to prevent ﬂooding
include  construction  of  physical  barriers,  such  as
levees (Figure 9.23) and ﬂoodwalls, which are usu-
ally constructed of concrete as opposed to earthen
levees; reservoirs to store water for later release at
safe rates; and on-site stormwater retention basins
(Figure 9.24). Unfortunately, the potential beneﬁts

Adjustments to Flood Hazards

309

of  physical  barriers  are  often  lost  because  of  in-
creased  development  on  ﬂoodplains  that  are  sup-
posedly protected by these structures. For example,
the winters of 1986 and 1997 brought tremendous
storms and ﬂooding to the western states, particu-
larly California, Nevada, and Utah. In all, damages
exceeded  several  hundred  million  dollars,  and  sev-
eral  people  died.  During  one  of  the  storms  and
ﬂoods in 1986, a levee broke on the Yuba River in
California, causing more than 20,000 people to ﬂee
their  homes.  An  important  lesson  learned  during
this  ﬂood  is  that  levees  constructed  along  rivers
many years ago are often in poor condition and sub-
ject to failure during ﬂoods.

The  1997  ﬂoods  damaged  campsites  and  other
development in Yosemite National Park. As a result,
the park revised its ﬂoodplain management policy;
some camping and other facilities were abandoned,
and  the  river  is  now  allowed  to  “run  free”  along
more of its course through the valley.

Some engineering structures designed to prevent
ﬂooding have actually increased the ﬂood hazard in
the  long  term.  For  example,  ﬂoodwalls  produced  a
bottleneck  at  St.  Louis  that  increased  upstream
ﬂooding  during  the  1993  ﬂoods  of  the  Mississippi
River. (See A Closer Look: Mississippi River Flood-
ing, 1973 and 1993.)

Recurring ﬂooding, particularly on the Mississippi,
has led to controversial speculation that human activ-
ities have contributed to an increase in ﬂooding. Over

time, equal ﬂood discharge is producing higher ﬂood
stages. The systems of levees, ﬂoodwalls, and struc-
tures  to  improve  river  navigation  for  barges  trans-
porting goods downriver control the smaller ﬂoods.
For the largest ﬂoods, these same systems may con-
strain or retard ﬂow (i.e., slow it down), and this re-
sults in higher levels of ﬂood ﬂow (stage).20

After  observing  causes  and  effects  of  many
ﬂoods,  we  have  learned  that  structural  controls
must go hand in hand with ﬂoodplain regulations if
the hazard is to be minimized.19,21,22

Channelization. Straightening, deepening, widen-
ing, clearing, or lining existing stream channels are
all methods of channelization. Basically, it is an en-
gineering technique with the objectives of control-
ling  ﬂoods,  draining  wetlands,  controlling  erosion,
and improving navigation.29 Of the four objectives,
ﬂood control and drainage improvement are the two
most  often  cited  in  channelization  projects.  Thou-
sands of kilometers of streams in the United States
have been modiﬁed, and thousands of kilometers of
channelization  are  now  being  planned  or  con-
structed.  Federal  agencies  alone  have  carried  out

several  thousand  kilometers  of  channel  modiﬁca-
tion. In the past, however, inadequate consideration
has been given to the adverse environmental effects
of channelization.

Opponents of channelizing natural streams em-
phasize  that  the  practice  is  antithetical  to  the 
production  of  ﬁsh  and  wetland  wildlife,  and,  fur-
thermore,  channelizing  causes  a  stream  to  suffer
from  extensive  aesthetic  degradation.  The  argu-
ment is as follows:

• Drainage  of  wetlands  adversely  affects  plants
and animals by eliminating habitats necessary
for the survival of certain species.

• Cutting  trees  along  the  stream  eliminates
shading  and  cover  for  ﬁsh  and  exposes  the
stream to the sun; the exposure results in dam-
age to plant life and heat-sensitive aquatic or-
ganisms.

• Cutting hardwood trees on the ﬂoodplain elim-
inates the habitats of many animals and birds,
while  facilitating  erosion  and  siltation  of  the
stream.

• Straightening  and  modifying  the  streambed
destroys  both  the  diversity  of  ﬂow  patterns

A 

Closer 
Look

Mississippi River Flooding, 1973 and 1993

In 1973, spring ﬂooding of the Missis-
sippi River caused the evacuation of
tens of thousands of people as thou-
sands of square kilometers of farm-
land were inundated throughout the
Mississippi River Valley. Fortunately,
there were few deaths, but the ﬂood-
ing resulted in approximately $1.2 bil-
lion in property damage.23 The 1973
ﬂoods occurred despite a tremendous
investment in upstream ﬂood-control
dams on the Missouri River. Reservoirs
behind these dams inundated some
of the most valuable farmland in the
Dakotas, and, despite these struc-
tures, the ﬂood near St. Louis was
record breaking.24 Impressive as this
ﬂood was at the time, it did not com-
pare either in magnitude or in the suf-
fering it caused with the ﬂooding that
occurred 20 years later.

During the summer of 1993, the
Mississippi River and its tributaries
experienced one of the largest ﬂoods
of the century. There was more water
than during the 1973 ﬂood, and the
recurrence interval exceeded 100
years. The ﬂoods lasted from late
June to early August and caused 50
deaths and more than $10 billion in
property damages. In all, about
55,000 km2 (21,236 mi2), including
numerous towns and farmlands,
were inundated with water.25,26

The 1993 ﬂoods resulted from a

major climatic anomaly that covered
the upper Midwest and north-central
Great Plains, precisely the area that
drains into the Mississippi and lower
Missouri River systems.27 The trouble
began with a wet autumn and a heavy
spring snowmelt that saturated the
ground in the upper Mississippi River
basin. Then, early in June, a high-pres-
sure center became stationary on the

East Coast, drawing moist, unstable air
into the upper Mississippi River
drainage basin. This condition kept
storm systems in the Midwest from
moving east. At the same time, air
moving in over the Rocky Mountains
initiated unusually heavy rainstorms.27
The summer of 1993 was the wettest
on record for Illinois, Iowa, and Min-
nesota. For example, Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, received about 90 cm (35 in.) of
rain from April through July—the
equivalent of a normal year’s rainfall in
just 4 months!26 Intense precipitation
falling on saturated ground led to a
tremendous amount of runoff and un-
usually large ﬂoods during the sum-
mer. The ﬂoodwaters were high for a
prolonged time, putting pressure on
the ﬂood defenses of the Mississippi
River, particularly levees, which are
earth embankments constructed par-
allel to the river to contain ﬂoodwaters
and reduce ﬂooding (Figure 9.F).
Levees are constructed on the ﬂat land
adjacent to the river known as the
ﬂoodplain.

Before construction of the levees,
the Mississippi’s ﬂoodplain, ﬂat land
adjacent to the river that periodically
ﬂoods, was much wider and con-
tained extensive wetlands. Since the
ﬁrst levees were built in 1718, approx-
imately 60 percent of the wetland in
Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and
Minnesota—all hard hit by the ﬂood-
ing in 1993—have been lost. In some
locations, such as St. Louis, Missouri,
levees give way to ﬂoodwalls de-
signed to protect the city against
high-magnitude ﬂoods. Examination
of Figure 9.G, a satellite image from
mid-July 1993, shows that the river is
narrow at St. Louis, where it is con-
tained by the ﬂoodwalls, and broad

upstream near Alton, where extensive
ﬂooding occurred. The ﬂoodwalls
produce a bottleneck because water
must pass through a narrow channel
between the walls; the ﬂoodwaters
get backed up waiting to get
through. These ﬂoodwaters con-
tributed to the 1993 ﬂooding up-
stream of St. Louis (Figure 9.G).
Despite the high walls con-

structed to prevent ﬂooding, the ris-
ing ﬂood peak came to within about
0.6 m (2 ft) of overtopping the ﬂood-
walls at St. Louis. Failure of levees
downstream from St. Louis partially
relieved the pressure, possibly saving
the city from ﬂooding. Levee failures
(Figure 9.H) were very common dur-
ing the ﬂood event.26,27 In fact, al-
most 80 percent of the private
levees—that is, levees built by farmers
and homeowners—along the Missis-
sippi River and its tributaries failed.26
However, most of the levees built by
the federal government survived the
ﬂooding and undoubtedly saved lives
and property. Unfortunately, there is
no uniform building code for the lev-
ees, so some areas have levees that
are higher or lower than others. Fail-
ures occurred as a result of overtop-
ping and breaching, or rupturing, re-
sulting in massive ﬂooding of
farmlands and towns (Figure 9.I).26
One of the lessons learned from
the 1993 ﬂoods is that construction
of levees provides a false sense of
security. It is difﬁcult to design lev-
ees to withstand extremely high-
magnitude ﬂoods for a long period
of time. Furthermore, the loss of
wetlands allows for less ﬂoodplain
space to “soak up” the ﬂoodwaters.28
The 1993 ﬂoods caused extensive
damage and loss of property; in

communities along the river are 
rethinking strategies concerning

exactly the adjustment that is 
appropriate.

• Conversion  of  wetlands  from  a  meandering
stream  to  a  straight,  open  ditch  seriously  de-
grades the aesthetic value of a natural area.29
Figure  9.25 summarizes  some  of  the  differ-
ences between natural streams and those mod-
iﬁed by channelization.

Not  all  channelization  causes  serious  environ-
mental  degradation;  in  many  cases,  drainage  pro-
jects  are  beneﬁcial.  Beneﬁts  are  probably  best  ob-
served  in  urban  areas  subject  to  ﬂooding  and  in
rural  areas  where  previous  land  use  has  caused
drainage problems. In addition, there are other ex-
amples in which channel modiﬁcation has improved
navigation or reduced ﬂooding and has not caused
environmental disruption.

Channel Restoration: Alternative 
to Channelization
Many  streams  in  urban  areas  scarcely  resemble
natural  channels.  The  process  of  constructing
roads,  utilities,  and  buildings  with  the  associated
sediment  production  is  sufﬁcient  to  disrupt  most
small streams. Channel restoration30 uses various
techniques:  Cleaning  urban  waste  from  the  chan-
nel,  allowing  the  stream  to  ﬂow  freely,  protecting
the existing channel banks by not removing exist-
ing  trees  or,  where  necessary,  planting  additional
native  trees  and  other  vegetation.  Trees  provide
shade  for  a  stream,  and  the  root  systems  protect

the  banks  from  erosion  (Figure  9.26).  The  objec-
tive is to create a more natural channel by allowing
the stream to meander and, when possible, provide
for  variable,  low-water  ﬂow  conditions:  fast  and
shallow  ﬂow  on  rifﬂes  alternating  with  slow  and
deep  ﬂow  in  pools.  Where  lateral  bank  erosion
must  be  absolutely  controlled,  the  outsides  of
bends may be defended with large stones known as
riprap.  Design  criteria  for  channel  restoration  are
shown in Figure 9.27.

River  restoration  of  the  Kissimmee  River  in
Florida  may  be  the  most  ambitious  restoration
project  ever  attempted  in  the  United  States  (see
Chapter 4).31 In Los Angeles, California, a group
called Friends of the River has suggested that the
Los Angeles River be restored. This will be a diffi-
cult  task,  since  most  of  the  riverbed  and  banks
are  lined  with  concrete  (Figure  9.28,  page  317).
However, a river park is planned for one section of
the  river  where  a  more  natural-looking  channel
has reappeared since channelization (Figure 9.29,
page 317).

Flood Insurance
In 1968, when private companies became reluctant
to  continue  to  offer  ﬂood  insurance,  the  federal
government took over. The U.S. National Flood In-
surance  Program  makes,  with  restrictions  includ-
ing a 30-day waiting period, ﬂood insurance avail-
able  at  subsidized  rates.  Special  Flood  Hazard
Areas, those inundated by the 100-year ﬂood, are

designated, and new property owners must buy in-
surance  at  rates  determined  on  the  basis  of  the
risk. The insurance program is intended to provide
short-term ﬁnancial aid to victims of ﬂoods as well
as  to  establish  long-term  land-use  regulations  for
the nation’s ﬂoodplains. The basic risk evaluation
centers  on  identifying  the  ﬂoodplain  area  inun-
dated  by  the  100-year  ﬂood.  Only  ﬂood-proofed
buildings  are  allowed  in  this  area  (Figure  9.30,
page  318),  and  no  construction  is  allowed  on  the
portion of the ﬂoodplain inundated by the 20-year
ﬂood. For a community to join the National Flood
Insurance Program, it must adopt minimum stan-
dards  of  land-use  regulation  within  the  100-year
ﬂoodplain,  mapped  by  the  Federal  Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA). Nearly all commu-
nities with a flood risk in the United States have
basic flood hazard maps and have initiated some
form  of  floodplain  regulations.  Several  million
insurance policies are presently held by property
owners.32

By the early 1990s, it was recognized that the in-
surance program was in need of reform, resulting in
the  National  Flood  Insurance  Reform  Act  of  1994.
The  act  was  passed  to  encourage  opportunities  to
mitigate ﬂood hazards, including ﬂood-prooﬁng, re-
locations, and buy-outs of properties likely to be fre-
quently ﬂooded.32
Flood-Prooﬁng
There  are  several  methods  of  ﬂood-prooﬁng.  The
most common include:

• Raising the foundation of a building above the
ﬂood hazard level by using piles or columns or
by extending foundation walls or earth ﬁll32

• Constructing ﬂoodwalls or earth berms around

buildings to seal them from ﬂoodwaters

• Using waterprooﬁng construction, such as wa-
terproofed  doors  and  waterproofed  basement
walls and windows

• Installing improved drains with pumps to keep

ﬂood waters out

There are also modiﬁcations to buildings that are
designed to minimize ﬂood damages while allowing
ﬂoodwaters to enter a building. For example, ground
ﬂoors along expansive riverfront properties in some
communities in Germany are designed so that they
are  not  seriously  damaged  by  floodwaters  and
may be easily cleaned and made ready for reuse after
a ﬂood.32

Floodplain Regulation
Previously, we have deﬁned the ﬂoodplain as a land-
form produced by a river. When we try to regulate
development on a ﬂood-hazard area, we often deﬁne
the  ﬂoodplain  from  a  hydrologic  point  of  view.
Thus, the 100-year ﬂoodplain is that part of a river
valley that is inundated by the 100-year ﬂood. For a
particular river at a particular site, that ﬂood has a
discharge (i.e., volume of ﬂow per unit time such as
cubic meters or cubic feet per second). We often de-
termine  that  discharge  by  analyzing  past  ﬂow
records  (see  A  Closer  Look:  Magnitude  and  Fre-
quency of Floods).

From  an  environmental  point  of  view,  the  best
approach  to  minimizing  ﬂood  damage  in  urban
areas is ﬂoodplain regulation. The big problem is
that  several  million  people  in  nearly  4,000  U.S.
towns and cities live on ﬂoodplains facing a recog-
nized ﬂood hazard. The objective of ﬂoodplain reg-
ulation  is  to  obtain  the  most  beneﬁcial  use  of
ﬂoodplains while minimizing ﬂood damage and the

cost of ﬂood protection.33 Floodplain regulation is
a compromise between indiscriminate use of ﬂood-
plains,  resulting  in  loss  of  life  and  tremendous
property  damage,  and  complete  abandonment  of
floodplains,  which  gives  up  a  valuable  natural
resource.

This  is  not  to  say  that  physical  barriers,  reser-
voirs,  and  channelization  are  not  desirable.  In
areas developed on ﬂoodplains, they will be neces-
sary to protect lives and property. We need to rec-
ognize, however, that the ﬂoodplain belongs to the
river  system,  and  any  encroachment  that  reduces
the cross-sectional area of the ﬂoodplain increases
ﬂooding (Figure 9.31). An ideal solution would be
discontinuing  ﬂoodplain  development  that  neces-
sitates  new  physical  barriers.  In  other  words,  the
ideal  is  to  “design  with  nature.”  Realistically, the
most effective and practical solution in most cases
will be using a combination of physical barriers and
ﬂoodplain regulations that results in fewer physi-
cal modiﬁcations of the river system. For example,
reasonable ﬂoodplain zoning in conjunction with a
diversion  channel  project  or  upstream  reservoir
may result in a smaller diversion channel or reser-
voir  than  would  be  necessary  without  ﬂoodplain
regulations.

Flood-Hazard Mapping
A preliminary step to ﬂoodplain regulation is ﬂood-
hazard  mapping,  which  is  a  means  of  providing

Adjustments to Flood Hazards

information  about  a  ﬂoodplain  for  land-use  plan-
ning.34 Flood-hazard  maps  may  delineate  past
ﬂoods or floods of a particular frequency, such as
the  100-year  ﬂood  (Figure  9.30).  They  are  useful
in regulating private development, purchasing land
for  public  use  as  parks  and  recreational  facilities,
and  creating  guidelines  for  future  land  use  on
ﬂoodplains.

Flood-hazard evaluation may be accomplished in
a  general  way  by  direct  observation  and  measure-
ment of physical parameters. For example, extensive
ﬂooding of the Mississippi River Valley during the
summer  of  1993  is  clearly  shown  on  images  pro-
duced from satellite-collected data (see Figure 9.G).
Floods can also be mapped from aerial photographs
taken  during  ﬂood  events;  they  can  be  estimated

from  high-water  lines,  ﬂood  deposits,  scour  marks
(Figure 9.32), and trapped debris on the ﬂoodplain,
measured in the ﬁeld after the water has receded.35
The  most  common  way  we  produce  ﬂood-hazard
maps  today  is  to  use  mathematical  models  that
show  the  land  ﬂooded  by  a  particular  ﬂow—often
the 100-year ﬂood.

Floodplain  Zoning. Flood-hazard  informa-
tion  is  used  to  designate  a  flood-hazard  area.
Once the hazard area has been established, plan-
ners can establish zoning regulations and accept-
able land use. Figure 9.33 shows a typical zoning
map before and after establishment of floodplain
regulations.

CHAPTER 9

Rivers and Flooding

Relocating People from
Floodplains: Examples
from North Carolina and
North Dakota
For several years, state and federal
governments have been selectively
purchasing  homes  damaged  by
ﬂoodwaters.  The  purpose  is  to  re-
move homes from hazardous areas
and  thereby  reduce  future  losses.
In  September  1999,  Hurricane
Floyd brought nearly 50 cm (20 in.)
of  rain  to  the  North  Carolina  re-
gion,  ﬂooding  many  areas.  State
and  federal  governments  decided
to  spend  nearly  $50  million  to  re-
move  about  430  homes  in  Rocky
Mount, North Carolina.

At Churchs Ferry, North Dakota,
there  has  been  a  wet  cycle  since
1992, causing nearby Devils Lake to
rise approximately 8 m (26 ft). The lake has no out-
let, and this part of the Northern Plains is very ﬂat.
As a result, the lake has more than doubled in area
and is inundating the land in the vicinity of Churchs
Ferry. By late June 2000, the town was all but de-
serted; the population of the town shrank from ap-
proximately 100 to 7 people. Most of the people in
the town have taken advantage of a voluntary fed-
eral buyout plan and have moved to higher ground,
many  to  the  town  of  Leeds,  approximately  24  km
(15 mi) away. The empty houses left behind will be
demolished or moved to safer ground.

The  lucrative  buyout  of  $3.5  million  seemed  to
be assured, a “slam dunk.” The people who partici-
pated  in  the  buyout  program  were  given  the  ap-
praised  value  of  their  homes  plus  an  incentive;
most considered the offer too good to turn down.
There  was  also  recognition  that  the  town  would
eventually have come to an end as a result of ﬂood-
ing.  Nevertheless,  there  was  some  bitterness
among  the  town’s  population,  and  not  everyone
participated.  The  mayor  and  the  ﬁre  chief  of  the
town  are  among  the  seven  people  who  decided  to
stay.  The  buyout  program  for  Churchs  Ferry
demonstrated that the process is an emotional one;
it is difﬁcult for some people to make the decision
to  leave  their  home,  even  though  they  know  it  is
likely to be damaged by ﬂoodwaters in the relatively
near future.

Personal Adjustment:
What to Do and What 
Not to Do
Flooding is the most commonly ex-
perienced natural hazard. Although
we cannot prevent ﬂoods from hap-
pening,  individuals  can  be  better
prepared.  Table  9.2 summarizes
what individuals can do to prepare
for a ﬂood as well as what not to do.

Areas, vol. 1)

At  the  institutional  level—that  is,
at  the  government  and  ﬂood-con-
trol  agency  level—perception  and
understanding  of  ﬂooding  are  ade-
quate for planning purposes. On the
individual  level,  however,  the  situation  is  not  as
clear.  People  are  tremendously  variable  in  their
knowledge  of  ﬂooding,  anticipation  of  future
flooding,  and  willingness  to  accept  adjustments
caused by the hazard.

Progress  at  the  institutional  level  includes  map-
ping  of  ﬂood-prone  areas  (thousands  of  maps  have
been prepared), of areas with a ﬂash-ﬂood potential
downstream  from  dams,  and  areas  where  urbaniza-
tion is likely to cause problems in the near future. In
addition,  the  federal  government  has  encouraged
states  and  local  communities  to  adopt  ﬂoodplain
management plans.4 Still, planning to avoid the ﬂood
hazard by not developing on ﬂoodplains or by relocat-
ing  present  development  to  locations  off  the  ﬂood-
plain needs further consideration and education if it
is to be accepted by the general population. This was
tragically  shown  by  the  2006  floods  in  the  Mid-
Atlantic  United  States,  when  severe  river  ﬂooding
impacted  the  region  from  Virginia  to  New  York
(Figure  9.34,  page  322).  More  than  200,000  ﬂood-
plain residents were evacuated in Pennsylvania alone,
and damages exceeding $100 million were incurred.
About  16  people  lost  their  lives  as  cars  were  swept
away by floodwaters and people drowned in ﬂood-
swollen creeks and rivers. About 70 people were res-
cued from rooftops. As a people, we need to just “say
no” to future development on ﬂoodplains. That is the
most cost-effective way to reduce chronic ﬂooding.

Preparing for a Flood
• Check with your local ﬂood control agency to see if your property is at risk from ﬂooding.
• If your property is at risk, purchase ﬂood insurance if you can and be sure that you know how to ﬁle a claim.
• Buy sandbags or ﬂood boards to block doors.
• Make up a ﬂood kit, including a ﬂashlight, blankets, raingear, battery-powered radio, ﬁrst-aid kit, rubber gloves, and

key personal documents. Keep it upstairs, if possible.

• Find out where to turn off your gas and electricity. If you are not sure, ask the person who checks your meter when

he or she next visits.

• Talk about possible ﬂooding with your family or housemates. Consider writing a ﬂood plan and store these notes

with your ﬂood kit.

• Observe water levels and stay tuned to radio and television news and weather reports.
• Move people, pets, and valuables upstairs or to higher ground.
• Move your car to higher ground. It takes only 0.6 m (2 ft) of fast-ﬂowing water to wash away your car.
• Check on your neighbors. Do they need help? They may not be able to escape upstairs or may need help moving

furniture.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About the Pakistan Floods of 2010 
to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. What was the role of human pop-

ulation and land use in the Pak-
istan ﬂooding?

2. How are science and values

linked to reducing the ﬂood haz-
ard in Pakistan?

3. How might sustainability of Pak-
istan be linked to the ﬂood haz-
ard in the country?

4. What can be learned from the

ﬂooding in Pakistan that is applic-
able to other countries in Asia?

Summary

Streams and rivers form a basic
transport system of the rock cycle
and are a primary erosion agent
shaping the landscape. The region
drained by a stream system is called a
drainage basin.

Sediments deposited by lateral mi-

gration of meanders in a stream and by
periodic overﬂow of the stream banks
form a ﬂoodplain. The magnitude and
frequency of ﬂooding are inversely re-
lated and are functions of the intensity
and distribution of precipitation, the
rate of inﬁltration of water into the
soil and rock, and topography. Flash
ﬂoods are produced by intense, brief
rainfall over a small area. Downstream
ﬂoods in major rivers are produced by
storms of long duration over a large
area that saturate the soil, causing in-
creased runoff from thousands of trib-
utary basins. Urbanization has in-
creased ﬂooding in small drainage
basins by covering much of the ground
with impermeable surfaces, such as
buildings and roads that increase the
runoff of stormwater.

River ﬂooding is the most univer-
sally experienced natural hazard. Loss
of life is relatively low in developed

countries that have adequate monitor-
ing and warning systems, but prop-
erty damage is much greater than in
preindustrial societies because ﬂood-
plains are often extensively developed.
Factors that control damage caused by
ﬂooding include land use on the ﬂood-
plain; the magnitude and frequency of
ﬂooding; the rate of rise and duration
of the ﬂooding; the season; the
amount of sediment deposited; and
the effectiveness of forecasting, warn-
ing, and emergency systems.

Environmentally, the best solution
to minimizing ﬂood damage is ﬂood-
plain regulation, but it will remain
necessary to use engineering struc-
tures to protect existing development
in highly urbanized areas. These in-
clude physical barriers such as levees
and ﬂoodwalls and structures that
regulate the release of water, such as
reservoirs. The realistic solution to
minimizing ﬂood damage involves a
combination of ﬂoodplain regulation
and engineering techniques. The in-
clusion of ﬂoodplain regulation is
critical because engineered structures
tend to encourage further develop-
ment of ﬂoodplains by producing a

false sense of security. The ﬁrst step
in ﬂoodplain regulation is mapping
the ﬂood hazards, which can be difﬁ-
cult and expensive. Planners can then
use the maps to zone a ﬂood-prone
area for appropriate uses. In some
cases, homes in ﬂood-prone areas
have been purchased and demolished
by the government, and people have
relocated to safe ground.

Channelization is the straighten-

ing, deepening, widening, cleaning, or
lining of existing streams. The most
commonly cited objectives of chan-
nelization are ﬂood control and
drainage improvement. Channeliza-
tion has often caused environmental
degradation, so new projects are
closely evaluated. New approaches to
channel modiﬁcation using natural
processes are being practiced, and, in
some cases, channelized streams are
being restored.

An adequate perception of ﬂood
hazards exists at the institutional
level. On the individual level, how-
ever, more public-awareness programs
are needed to help people clearly per-
ceive the hazard of living in ﬂood-
prone areas.

CHAPTER 9

Rivers and Flooding

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
More and more people are living on
ﬂoodplains. These ﬂat lands adjacent
to rivers, which have a high ﬂood risk,
are seen by too many people as a place
to develop. To end this folly, we must
be ﬁrm in establishing ﬂoodplain reg-
ulation and just say no to most ﬂood-
plain development.

Sustainability Rivers are the
lifeblood of the land. They provide
water resources and routes for the
transport of people and goods, and
they maintain important ecosystems,
from wetlands to ﬂoodplains. Build-
ing a sustainable future is not possi-
ble without planning for sustainable
rivers.

Earth as a System Rivers are one
of the land’s major systems. They
transport water and sediment while

eroding the land to form most of our
landscape. Over time, rivers change
as a result of land use, such as con-
version of forest lands for urban and
agricultural purposes. These changes
have increased the ﬂood hazard by
(1) ﬁlling channels in agricultural re-
gions with sediment eroded from the
land, which also depletes soils, and
(2) increasing runoff in urban areas,
producing more and larger ﬂoods,
while decreasing inﬁltration of water
into the soil.

Hazardous Earth Processes,
Risk Assessment, and 
Perception Flooding is the most
universally experienced hazard. It is
also a hazard for which the risks are
well known. A major problem is con-
vincing people and communities that
unwise land use on ﬂoodplains will
lead to ﬂood losses. The key is to edu-

cate people so that they gain a better
understanding of the ﬂood hazard
and of where and why ﬂoods occur: in
other words, heighten the public per-
ception of ﬂooding.

Scientific Knowledge 
and Values The science of rivers,
including their ecology and hydrol-
ogy, is well advanced. However, our
values often conﬂict with science
when it comes to reducing the ﬂood
hazard. Often, we choose a “technol-
ogy ﬁx” to build more ﬂood-control
dams, higher levees, more ﬂoodwalls,
or to channelize rivers. These prac-
tices have damaged river ecosystems
and have lured people to encroach on
ﬂoodplains, leading to even greater
ﬂood losses. Floodplain management
and river restoration reﬂect the value
we place on rivers as a resource to be
revered, not degraded.

Slope Processes,
Landslides, 
and Subsidence

Learning Objectives
Landslides, the movement of materials down slopes, constitute a serious natural hazard in many
parts of the United States and the rest of the world. Landslides are often linked to other hazards,
such as earthquakes and volcanoes. Most landslides are small and slow, but a few are large and

fast. Both types may cause signiﬁcant loss of life and damage to human property, particularly in

urban areas. In this chapter, we focus on the following learning objectives:

• Understand basic slope

processes and the causes
of slope failure

• Understand the role of

driving and resisting
forces on slopes and how
they are related to slope
stability

• Understand how slope
angle and topography,
vegetation, water, and
time affect both slope
processes and the
incidence of landslides
• Understand how human

use of the land has
resulted in landslides

• Know methods of

identiﬁcation,
prevention, warning,
and correction of
landslides

• Understand processes

related to land

Case History
La Conchita Landslide of 2005

The small beach-
side community
of La Conchita,
located about
80 km (50 mi)
northwest of
Los Angeles,
California,
was the site
of a disas-
ter on Jan-
uary 10,
2005. On
that day,
a fast-
moving
landslide
damaged
or de-
stroyed
36 homes
and killed
10 people
(Figure
10.1). The
2005 land-
slide was a
reactivation
of a 1995
landslide that
destroyed sev-
eral homes but
caused no
deaths. Both the

1995 and 2005

events were, in turn,
part of an older prehis-
toric landslide, less than
about 6,000 years old, on

the steep slope directly above

La Conchita. As we shall see,

this 6,000-year-old slide is part of
an even older, larger prehistoric slide
on the mountain above.

The winter of 2004–2005 was par-
ticularly wet, with high-intensity rain-
fall occurring at times. Neither resi-
dents nor local ofﬁcials recognized that
another landslide was imminent. The

2005 debris ﬂow was different from
that of 1995 in that the ﬂow was faster,
at 45 km/hr (30 mph), and moved fur-
ther into the community. A number of
people were trapped in their homes,
while others ran for their lives.

Directly behind the community is a

200 m (600 ft) high slope that pro-
duces continuing landslide hazards
for humans living below it. La Con-
chita should never have been con-
structed at the foot of that slope. It
has been known that landslides have
occurred in the area for about 100
years. More telling, the community is
built on about 15 m (50 ft) of old
landslide deposits. Landslides above
La Conchita and to the east and west
have been occurring for thousands of
years, long before people made the
decision to build beach homes at the
base of the steep slope.

A study of La Conchita and the sur-
rounding area suggests that the debris

ﬂows and slides of 1995, 2005, and
older events are a part of a much larger
prehistoric landslide less than about
40,000 years old that had not been rec-
ognized at the time of the more recent
events (Figure 10.2). There is no evi-
dence that the much larger, older pre-
historic slide is moving as a mass, but
parts are active, especially at the west-
ern margin of the slide.1

It is not a matter of if, but when,
future landslides will occur on the
slopes above La Conchita. No part of
the La Conchita community is exempt
from a future landslide.2

A potential solution to reduce the

hazard to people and houses is to
transform the land use of La Conchita
from an area where people live into a
coastal park. Not all people living
there would be happy to hear such a
suggestion, but society could help re-
locate people with fair compensation

result would be a transformation of a
hazardous site into a resource for
future generations. At the least, we
need to be diligent in the future con-
cerning land use planning and avoid
unwise development on the large pre-
historic slide above La Conchita. A
similar, but smaller, prehistoric slide
was reactivated in Malibu, California,
in the mid-1980s, causing claimed
damages of about $200 million.

A report with recommendations

was commissioned by the state of Cal-
ifornia concerning the landslide haz-
ard on the slope directly behind La
Conchita (i.e., the slides that occurred
in 1995 and 2005).3 The report dis-
cusses several options from the per-
spective of risk assessment and cost.

Total risk exposure over the next 50
years is about $190 million, with cer-
tain loss of life if nothing is done. A
complete grading of the slope above
La Conchita (i.e., removal/remolding
of slope materials and slope reduction
to a lower angle) would cost about
$200 million, and (according to the
report) would reduce the risk to a tol-
erable level. A more focused grading
project to include the slides of 1995
and 2005 would cost about $50 mil-
lion and would also (according to the
report) lower the risk to a tolerable
level. With both of the grading op-
tions, there is still the risk of damages
and loss of life in the future. The op-
tion of risk avoidance (i.e., moving
homes out of harm’s way) was also

discussed in the report. Risk avoid-
ance would cost about $50 million (to
purchase homes) and is the most
likely option to prevent future loss of
life. However, the option that appears
to be the one most seriously consid-
ered is the more focused grading of
the slide masses of 1995 and
2005.This option is not without risk,
but it does allow for the La Conchita
community to continue its somewhat
uncertain history.

What has been learned so far at 
La Conchita is that both prehistoric
and active landslides can be recog-
nized and their future activity evalu-
ated. We now need to be proactive
and take steps to reduce risk from fu-
ture landslides.

10.1 Introduction 
to Landslides

Landslides  and  related  phenomena  cause  substan-
tial  damage  (Figure  10.3)  and  loss  of  life.  In  the
United States, between 25 and 50 people are killed
each  year  by  landslides.  This  number  increases  to
between  100  and  150  if  collapses  of  trenches  and
other  excavations  are  included.  The  total  annual
cost of damages is about $3.5 billion.4

Landslides and other types of ground failure are
natural phenomena that would occur with or with-
out  human  activity.  However,  human  land  use  has
led to an increase in these events in some situations
and  a  decrease  in  others.  For  example,  landslides
may  occur  on  previously  stable  hillsides  that  have
been  modiﬁed  for  housing  development;  on  the
other hand, landslides on naturally sensitive slopes
are sometimes averted through the use of stabiliz-
ing structures or techniques.

Slope Processes and Types of Landslides

Mass  wasting is  a  comprehensive  term  for  any
type of downslope movement of Earth materials. In
its  more  restricted  sense,  mass  wasting  refers  to  a
downslope movement of rock or soil as a more or less
coherent mass. In this chapter, we consider landslides
in  the  restricted  sense.  We  will  also  discuss  the  re-
lated phenomena of earthﬂows and mudﬂows, rock-
falls, and snow or debris avalanches. For the sake of
convenience,  we  sometimes  refer  to  all  of  these  as
landslides. We will also discuss subsidence, a type of
ground failure characterized by nearly vertical defor-
mation, or the downward sinking of Earth materials.
Subsidence  often  produces  circular  surface  pits  but
may produce linear or irregular patterns of failure.

10.2 Slope Processes and Types

of Landslides

Slope Processes
Slopes  are  the  most  common  landforms  on  Earth,
and  although  most  slopes  appear  stable  and  static,
they  are  dynamic,  evolving  systems.  Slopes  are  not
generally uniform in their shape but are composed of
segments that are straight or curved. Two different-
looking  slopes  are  shown  in  Figure  10.4.  The  ﬁrst
(Figure 10.4a) has a high cliff, or free-face, a straight,
nearly vertical slope segment. This is a slope formed
on hard granite rock in Yosemite National Park. Rock

CHAPTER 10

Slope Processes, Landslides, and Subsidence

fragments that fall from the free-face may accumu-
late at the base of the slope to form a talus slope. The
free-face and talus slopes are segments of the slope.
Notice the surface cover of soil, missing on the free-
face and talus slopes of Figure 10.4a. The hill slopes
in  Figure  10.4b are  formed  on  rocks  that  are  not
nearly  as  strong  as  the  granite  in  Yosemite.  The
slopes are gentler and lack a free-face. In this photo,
there are three segments: an upper convex slope, a
lower  concave  slope,  and,  separating  the  two,  a
straight  slope.  Thus,  we  see  that  slopes  are  usually
composed of different slope segments. The ﬁve seg-
ment  types  above  are  sufﬁcient  to  describe  most
slopes you will encounter in nature. Which slope seg-
ments are present on a particular slope depends on
the rock type and the climate. Free-face development
is more common on strong hard rocks or in arid envi-
ronments  where  there  is  little  vegetation.  Convex
and concave slopes are more common on softer rocks
or with a more humid wet climate, where thick soil
and  vegetation  are  present.  But  there  are  many

exceptions  to  these  general  rules,  depending  upon
local  conditions.  For  example,  the  gentle,  convex,
red-colored slopes in the lower part of Figure 10.4b
have  formed  on  weak,  easily  eroded  metamorphic
rock  (schist)  in  a  semiarid  climate  on  Santa  Cruz 
Island, California.

Material  on  most  slopes  is  constantly  moving
down the slope at rates that vary from an impercepti-
ble  creep  of  soil  and  rock  to  thundering  avalanches
and  rockfalls  that  move  at  tremendous  velocities.
These slope processes are one signiﬁcant reason that
valleys are much wider than the streams they contain.

Types of Landslides
Earth  materials  may  fail  and  move  or  deform  in
several  ways  (Figure  10.5).  Rotational  slumps  in-
volve  sliding  along  a  curved  slip  plain,  producing
slump blocks (Figure 10.5a, b). Translational sliding
is downslope movement of Earth materials along a
planar  slip  plane,  such  as  a  bedding  plane  or  frac-

ture  (Figure  10.5c,  d).  Rock  fall  is  the  free  fall  of
Earth  materials  from  a  free-face  of  a  cliff  (Figure
10.5e). Flows are the downslope movement of un-
consolidated (usually saturated) materials in which
particles move about and mix within the mass. Very
slow  ﬂowage  of  rock  or  soil  is  called  creep (Figure
10.5f);  rapid  ﬂowage  may  be  an  earthﬂow,  a
mudﬂow,  or  a  debris  ﬂow.  An  earthﬂow  (Figures
10.5g and 10.6) often originates on a slope where
soil partially liqueﬁes and runs out. The source area
becomes  a  bowl-shaped  depression,  and  a  deposi-
tional area spreads out at the toe of the slope, giv-
ing the event an hourglass shape. A debris ﬂow or
mudﬂow  (Figure  10.5h)  is  a  mixture  of  rock,  soil,
and organic matter that mixes with air and water to
ﬂow rapidly down slope. The upper part of the ﬂow
is  often  conﬁned  to  a  channel  or  valley  but  may
spread out when it is no longer conﬁned. A debris
ﬂow has less than 50 percent ﬁnes (sand, silt, and
clay), whereas a mudﬂow has more than 50 percent
ﬁnes by volume. A debris avalanche (Figure 10.5i) is
a  very  rapid  to  extremely  rapid  debris  ﬂow.  Large
debris  avalanches  can  cause  catastrophic  damage
and loss of life. Lateral spreads (Figure 10.5j) are a
type  of  landslide  that  often  occurs  on  nearly  ﬂat
slopes or very gentle slopes. The movement starts
with liquefaction of silts, clays, or ﬁne sands during
earthquake  shaking  or  other  disturbance.  The  ac-
tual movement is lateral extension. If stronger co-
herent rock or soil is at the surface and is over a soil
layer that liqueﬁes, the stronger material may frac-
ture, translate, rotate, or disintegrate and ﬂow. Lat-
eral spreads often start suddenly and then become

larger in a slower, progressive manner.4 Subsidence
may occur on slopes or on ﬂat ground and involves
the sinking of a mass of Earth material below the
level of the surrounding surface (Figure 10.5k).

Landslides are commonly complex combinations
of  sliding  and  ﬂowage.  As  an  example,  Figures
10.5l and 10.7 show failures consisting of an upper
slump that  is  transformed  to  a  ﬂow  in  the  lower
part  of  the  slide.  Such  complex  landslides  may
form  when  water-saturated  Earth  materials  ﬂow
from the lower part of the slope, undermining the
upper part and causing slumping of blocks of Earth
materials.

Important  variables  in  classifying  downslope
movements  are  the  type  of  movement  (i.e.,  slide,
fall, ﬂow, slump, complex movement), slope mater-
ial  type,  amount  of  water  present,  and  rate  of
movement. In general, the movement is considered
rapid if it can be discerned with the naked eye; oth-
erwise, it is classiﬁed as slow (Figure 10.5). Actual
rates vary from a slow creep of a few millimeters or
centimeters per year to very rapid, at 1.5 m (5 ft)
per day, to extremely rapid, at 30 m (98 ft) or more
per second.5

10.3 Slope Stability
Forces on Slopes
To determine the causes of landslides, we must ex-
amine  slope  stability,  which  can  be  expressed  in
terms of the forces that act on slopes. The stability
of a slope expresses the relationship between driving

forces,  which  move  Earth  materials  down  a  slope,
and  resisting  forces,  which  oppose  such  movement.
The  most  common  driving  force  is  the  downslope
component of the weight of the slope material, in-
cluding  anything  superimposed  on  the  slope,  such
as  vegetation,  ﬁll  material,  or  buildings.  The  most
common resisting force is the strength, or the resis-
tance  to  failure  by  sliding  or  ﬂowing,  of  the  slope
material acting along potential slip planes. Potential
slip planes are geologic surfaces exhibiting weakness
in the slope material; for example, foliation planes
in a slope composed of schist, bedding planes in sed-
imentary  rocks,  and  fractures  in  all  rock  types  are
potential slip planes.

Slope stability is evaluated by computing a factor
of safety (FS), deﬁned as the ratio of the resisting
forces to the driving forces (see A Closer Look: Cal-
culating a Factor of Safety for a Simple Landslide). If
the  factor  of  safety  is  greater  than  1,  the  resisting
forces  exceed  the  driving  forces,  and  the  slope  is
considered stable. If the factory of safety is less than
1, the driving forces exceed the resisting forces, and
a slope failure can be expected. Driving and resisting
forces  are  not  static:  As  local  conditions  change,
these  forces  may  change,  increasing  or  decreasing
the factor of safety.

Driving and resisting forces on slopes are deter-
mined  by  the  interrelationships  of  the  following
variables:

• Type of Earth materials
• Slope angle and topography
• Climate
• Vegetation
• Water
• Time

The Role of Earth Material Type
The material composing a slope affects both the type
and  the  frequency  of  downslope  movement.  Slides
have two basic patterns of movement, rotational and
translational.  In  rotational  slides,  or  slumps,  the
sliding  occurs  along  a  curved  slip  surface  (Figure
10.5a,  b).  Because  the  movement  follows  a  curve,
slump blocks (i.e., the blocks of Earth material that
are undergoing slump) tend to produce topographic
benches that can be rotated and tilted in the upslope
direction like those in Figure 10.5b. Slumps are most
common on soil slopes, but they also occur on some
rock slopes, most often in weak rock, such as shale.
Translational  slides are  planar;  that  is,  they  occur
along  inclined  slip  planes  within  a  slope  (Figure
10.5c, d) (see A Closer Look: Translation Slides Along
Bedding Planes). Common translation slip planes in
rock  slopes  include  fractures  in  all  rock  types,  bed-
ding planes, weak clay layers, and foliation planes in
metamorphic rocks. Soil slips, another type of trans-

Calculating a Factor of Safety for a Simple Landslide

Analysis of a slope for landslide risk in-
volves determination of resisting and
driving forces and the ratio of the two,
which is the factor of safety (FS). This
may be done for a simple translational
slide, similar to a block of rock on an
inclined plane (a slip plane). For exam-
ple, consider the cross section shown
in Figure 10.A, which shows a lime-
stone bluff with a potential slip plane
composed of clay that is found be-
tween bedding planes of the lime-
stone and is inclined at an angle of 30°
to a horizontal plane. The potential slip
plane is said to “daylight”in the bluff
(i.e., the ends of bedding planes are
exposed on the slope [bluff], and,
thus, the rocks above the slip plane are
not well supported), presenting a po-
tential landslide hazard. To determine
the FS, we need to calculate the

driving and resisting forces. A force (F)
is a push or pull, deﬁned quantitatively
as the product of a mass (m) multi-
plied by an acceleration (a), written as
F ⴝ ma. Using the equation, which is
Newton’s second law of motion, a
force can be considered as a quantita-
tive relationship between two objects,
such as two masses of rock on a slope
separated by a slip plane. With respect
to slope processes, a force (e.g., the
force of gravity) may be considered as
a factor that causes an object at rest
(i.e., rocks on a slope) to move downs-
lope. The unit for force in the metric or
SI system is the Newton, and, for the
English system, the unit of force is the
pound. For our problem, assume that
the area above the slip plane in the
cross section is 500 m2. The unit

Laboratory tests suggest that the
shear strength of the clay (a force per
unit area) along the slip plane is
9 * 104 N/m2

section, the measured length of the
slip plane is 50 m. With this informa-
tion, we can calculate the FS as the
ratio of resisting to driving forces by
the equation:

FS =

We use what is known as the “unit

thickness method” to analyze the 
resisting and driving forces for a slice
(cross section in Figure 10.A) of the
bluff, oriented perpendicular to the
bluff, which is 1 m thick. The resisting
forces are the product of SLT, where S
is the shear strength of the clay, L is
the length of the slip plane, and T is
the unit thickness. The driving force
is the downslope component of the
weight of the slope material above
the potential slip plane. This is W sine
™
, where W is equal to the product of
the area above the slip plane (A), the
unit weight of the slope material, 
and T is the unit thickness. Then
W = (500 m2)(1 m)(1.6 * 104 N/m3)=

and the product (W sine 
downslope component of the weight
of the slope materials above the po-
tential slip plane (Figure 10.A). The
sine of 30 degrees is 0.5. If the angle
of the slip plane were 45 degrees, 
the sine would be 0.71. If the angle
were 20 degrees, the sine would be
0.34. Thus, assuming that W is con-
stant, with a steeper angle of the slip
plane (at 45 degrees), the driving
force increases, and, conversely, if

CHAPTER 10

Slope Processes, Landslides, and Subsidence

The conclusion from our analysis,
which resulted in a FS of 1.13, is not
all that encouraging; generally, a FS
less than 1.25 is considered condi-
tionally stable. What could be done
to increase the FS to at least 1.25?
One possibility would be to remove
some of the weight of the limestone
above the potential slip plane. That

is, reducing the driving force would
increase the FS.

This example is a simple one 

for an inclined straight slip plane.
Most slope stability problems are
much more complex, involving vari-
able rock strength along real and
potential slip planes that may be
curved.6

the angle is less (at 20 degrees), the
driving forces are reduced.

lational slide, can also occur in some areas.
Soil slips are very shallow slides in soil over
rock that occur parallel to the slope (Figure
10.8). For soil slips, the slip plane is usually
above the bedrock but below the soil within
a slope material known as colluvium, a mix-
ture  of  weathered  rock  and  other  material
(Figure 10.9, page 338).

Material type is a factor in falls, as well as
in slides. If a resistant rock forms a very steep
slope, weathering or erosion along fractures
may cause a rockfall. Such failures on nearly
vertical high slopes in hard granite present
a  continuous,  chronic  hazard  in  Yosemite
National Park (Figure 10.10, page 339).

The type of materials composing a slope
may greatly inﬂuence the type of slope fail-
ure  that  occurs.  For  example,  on  shale
slopes or slopes on weak volcanic pyroclas-
tic  materials,  failure  commonly  occurs  as
creep, the very slow downslope movement
of soil or rock; earthﬂows or mudﬂows, the
downslope ﬂow of saturated Earth materi-
als; slumps; or soil slips. Slopes formed in
resistant rock, such as well-cemented sand-
stone, limestone, or granite, do not experi-
ence the same problems. Therefore, before
developing  on  shale  or  other  weak  rock
slopes, people must give careful considera-
tion to the potential landslide hazard.

The Role of Slope 
and Topography
The  hill  slope  angle,  which  is  a  measure 
of  how  steep  a  hill  slope  is,  is  usually
called  the  slope.  Slope  greatly  affects  the

Translation Slides Along Bedding Planes

Bedding planes are potential slip
planes for landslides when they are
inclined downslope and when they
daylight (i.e., when they are exposed
on the surface of a slope). A slope of
a sea cliff with daylighting bedding

planes in shale is diagrammatically
shown in Figure 10.B. Several
months later, in 2003, the slope
failed, perhaps as a result of water
being added to the top of the slope
where grass was planted and

watered. The landslide deposits cover
part of the sandy beach (Figure
10.C), and a catastrophe was nar-
rowly avoided as a beach party was
happening a short distance away.

relative  magnitude  of  driving  forces  on  slopes. 
As  the  slope  of  a  hillside  or  potential  slip  plane
within  a  slope  increases,  say  from  15  degrees  to 
45  degrees  or  steeper,  the  driving  force  also  in-
creases; therefore, landslides are more frequent on
steep  slopes.  A  study  of  landslides  that  occurred
during two rainy seasons in California’s San Fran-
cisco Bay area established that 75 to 85 percent of
landslide activity is closely associated with urban
areas on steep slopes.7 Within the United States,
the  coastal  mountains  of  California  and  Oregon,
the  Rocky  Mountains,  and  the  Appalachian
Mountains  have  the  greatest  frequency  of  land-
slides.  All  of  the  types  of  downslope  movement

shown  in  Figure  10.5 occur  on  steep  slopes  in
those locations.

Steep  slopes  are  often  associated  with  rockfalls
and  debris  avalanches,  which  are  the  very  rapid
downslope  movement  of  soil,  rock,  and  organic
debris. In southern California, shallow soil slips are
common on steep saturated slopes. Once they move
downslope, these soil slips are often transformed into
earthﬂows  or  debris  ﬂows,  which  can  be  extremely
hazardous (Figure 10.11, page 340). Earthﬂows can
occur on moderate slopes, and creep can be observed
on very gentle slopes.

Debris  ﬂows are  the  downslope  ﬂow  of  relatively
coarse material; more than 50 percent of particles in

move  very  slowly  or  rapidly,  depending  on  condi-
tions. Debris ﬂows, debris avalanches, and mudﬂows
vary in size: They can be relatively small to moderate
events, conﬁned to a single valley of slope with a few

hundred cubic meters of debris to hundreds of thou-
sands of cubic meters. However, they can also be huge
events involving an entire ﬂank of a mountain, mea-
sured in cubic kilometers of material. (Volcanic mud-
ﬂows and debris ﬂows are discussed in Chapter 8.)

The Role of Climate
Climate can be defined as characteristic weather at
a particular place or region over seasons, years, or
decades. Climate is more than the average air tem-
perature  and  amount  of  precipitation.  Climate
includes  seasonal  patterns  of  weather,  such  as

winter  rains  along  the  West  Coast  of  the  United
States,  summer  thunderstorm  activity  in  the
southwestern  United  States,  and  hurricane  activ-
ity in the southeastern United States. The subject
of climate and how it changes is discussed in detail
in Chapter 18.

Building and Safety)

The role of climate is important in our discussion
of landslides because climate inﬂuences the amount
and timing of water, in the form of rain and snow,
that may inﬁltrate or erode a hill slope, as well as the
type and abundance of vegetation that grows on a
hill slope. Hill slopes in arid and semiarid climates
tend to have sparse vegetation and soils with a lot of
bare rock exposed. Slope segments, such as the free-
face  and  talus  slopes,  tend  to  be  more  common
because  small  differences  in  resistance  of  rock  to
weathering  and  erosion  are  emphasized.  Common
landslide  activity  in  arid  and  semiarid  regions  in-
cludes rockfall, debris flows, and shallow soil slips.

The Role of Vegetation
In  the  more  subhumid  to  humid  regions  of  the
world,  vegetation  is  abundant,  thick  soil  cover
develops,  and  the  slopes  have  many  more  convex
and concave slope segments. Landslide activity in-
cludes  deep  complex  landslides,  earthﬂows,  and
soil creep. The role of vegetation in landslides and
related  phenomena  is  complex.  Vegetation  in  an
area is a function of several factors, including cli-
mate, soil type, topography, and ﬁre history, each
of  which  also  inﬂuences  what  happens  on  slopes.

(b)

Vegetation is a signiﬁcant factor in slope stability
for three reasons:

• Vegetation provides a cover that cushions the
impact of rain falling on slopes, facilitating in-
ﬁltration of water into the slope while retard-
ing grain-by-grain erosion on the surface.

• Vegetation  has  root  systems  that  tend  to  pro-
vide an apparent cohesion (like iron bars in con-
crete)  to  the  slope  materials,  which  increases
resistance to landsliding.

• Vegetation adds weight to the slope.
In some cases, the presence of vegetation increases
the  probability  of  a  landslide,  especially  for  shallow
soil  slips  on  steep  slopes.  In  southern  California
coastal areas, one type of soil slip occurs on steep-cut
slopes  covered  with  low  vegetation  called  ice  plant
(Figure 10.12). During especially wet winter months,
the  shallow-rooted  ice  plants  take  up  water,  adding
considerable weight to steep slopes—each leaf stores
water  and  looks  like  a  small  canteen—thereby  in-
creasing the driving forces. The plants also cause an
increase  in  the  inﬁltration  of  water  into  the  slope,
which decreases the resisting forces. When failure oc-
curs, the plants and several centimeters of roots and
soil slide to the base of the slope.

rainwater. (Edward A. Keller)

Soil  slips  on  natural  steep  slopes  are  a  serious
problem in southern California. Chaparral, the dense
shrubs or brush shown in Figure 10.8, facilitates an
increase in water inﬁltrating into the slope, lowering
the factor of safety.8

The Role of Water
Water  is  almost  always  directly  or  indirectly  in-
volved  with  landslides,  so  its  role  is  particularly
important.9 When studying a landslide, we ﬁrst exam-
ine what the water on or in the slope is doing. There
are three basic ways in which water on or in a slope
can affect stability: (1) Landslides, such as shallow
soil  slips,  can  develop  during  rainstorms  when
slopes  become  saturated;  (2)  landslides,  such  as
slumps or translational slides, can develop months
or even years after inﬁltration of water deep into the
slope; and (3) water can erode the base or toe of a
slope, thereby decreasing slope stability.

Water’s  ability  to  erode  affects  the  stability  of
slopes.  Stream  or  wave  erosion  on  a  slope  may  re-
move material and create a steeper slope, thus reduc-
ing the factor of safety (Figure 10.13). This problem
is  particularly  critical  if  the  base  of  the  slope  is  an
old, inactive landslide that is likely to move again if
stability  is  reduced  (Figure  10.14).  Therefore,  it  is
important to recognize old landslides along potential
road cuts and other excavations before construction
in order to isolate and correct potential problems.

Another way that water can cause landslides is by
contributing to spontaneous liquefaction of clay-rich
sediment, or quick clay. When disturbed, some clays
temporarily  lose  their  shear  strength,  behave  as  a
liquid, and ﬂow. The shaking of clay below Anchor-
age,  Alaska,  during  the  1964  earthquake  produced
this  effect  and  was  extremely  destructive.  In  Que-
bec, Canada, several large slides associated with quick
clays  have  destroyed  numerous  homes  and  killed
about 70 people. The slides occurred on river valley
slopes  when  initially  solid  material  was  converted
into a liquid mud as the sliding movement began.10
These  slides  are  especially  interesting  because  the
liquefaction  of  clays  occurs  without  earthquake
shaking. The slides are often initiated by river ero-
sion at the toe of the slope and, although they start
in a small area, they may develop into large events.
Since they often involve the reactivation of an older
slide, future problems may be avoided by restricting
development in these areas.

The Role of Time
The  forces  on  slopes  often  change  with  time.  For
example,  both  driving  and  resisting  forces  may
change seasonally as the moisture content or water
table position alters. Much of the chemical weath-
ering of rocks, which slowly reduces their strength,
is caused by the chemical action of water in contact
with  soil  and  rock  near  Earth’s  surface.  Water

(H2O) is often acidic because it reacts with carbon
dioxide  (CO2)  in  the  atmosphere  and  soil  to  pro-
duce  weak  carbonic  acid  (H2CO3).  This  chemical
weathering  is  especially  signiﬁcant  in  areas  with
limestone,  which  is  susceptible  to  weathering  and
decomposition  by  carbonic  acid.  Changes  due  to
weathering are greater in especially wet years, as re-
ﬂected  by  the  increased  frequency  of  landslides
during or after wet years. In other slopes, there may

be  a  continuous  reduction  in  resisting  forces  over
time,  perhaps  due  either  to  weathering,  which  re-
duces the cohesion in slope materials, or to a regu-
lar increase in pore water pressure in the slope from
natural  or  artiﬁcial  conditions.  A  slope  that  is  be-
coming less stable with time may have an increas-
ing rate of creep until failure occurs. The case his-
tory of the Vaiont Dam illustrates this concept (see
Case History: Vaiont Dam).

The world’s worst dam disaster
occurred on October 9, 1963,
when approximately 2,600 lives
were lost at the Vaiont Dam in
Italy (Figure 10.D). The disas-
ter involved the world’s highest
thin-arch dam, yet, strangely,
no damage was sustained by
the main shell of the dam or
the abutments.11 The tragedy
was caused by a huge landslide
in which more than 238 million
m3 (0.06 mi3) of rock and other
debris moved at speeds of
about 95 km per hour (59 mi
per hour) down the north face
of the mountain above the
reservoir. Slide material com-
pletely ﬁlled the reservoir for
1.8 km (1.1 mi) along the axis
of the valley to heights of
nearly 152 m (500 ft) above the
reservoir level. The rapid move-
ment created a tremendous up-
draft of air and propelled rocks
and water up the north side of
the valley, higher than 250 m

(820 ft) above the reservoir level. The
slide and its accompanying blasts of air,
water, and rock produced strong earth-
quakes recorded many kilometers away.
It blew the roof off one man’s house
well over 250 m (820 ft) above the
reservoir and pelted the man with rocks
and debris. The ﬁlling of the reservoir
produced waves of water more than 
90 m (295 ft) high that swept over the
abutments of the dam. The waves were
still more than 70 m (230 ft) high more
than 1.5 km (0.9 mi) downstream; in
fact, everything for many kilometers
downstream was completely destroyed.
The entire event—slide and ﬂood—was
over in less than 7 minutes.

The landslide followed a 3-year pe-

riod of monitoring the rate of creep
on the slope, which varied from less

than 1 cm to as many as 30 cm (12 in.)
per week, until September 1963,
when it increased to 25 cm (10 in.)
per day. Finally, on the day before the
slide, it was about 100 cm (39 in.) per
day. Although engineers expected a
landslide, they did not realize until
the day before the slide that a large
area was moving as a uniform, unsta-
ble mass. Interestingly, animals graz-
ing on the slope had sensed danger
and moved away on October 1, over a
week before the landslide.

The slide was caused by a combina-
tion of factors. First, adverse geologic
conditions—including weak rocks and
limestone with open fractures, sink-
holes, and weak clay layers that were in-
clined toward the reservoir—produced
unstable blocks (Figure 10.E). Second,

very steep topography created a strong
driving force. Third, water pressure was
increased in the valley rocks because of
the water in the reservoir. The rate of
creep before the slide increased as the
groundwater level rose in response to
higher reservoir levels. Fourth, heavy
rains from late September until the day
of the disaster further increased the
weight of the slope materials, raised the
water pressure in the rocks, and pro-
duced runoff that continued to ﬁll the
reservoir even after engineers tried to
lower the reservoir level.

Ofﬁcials concluded that the disaster

was caused by an increase in the dri-
ving forces, accompanied by a great de-
crease in the resisting forces, as rising
groundwater in the slope increased
along zones of weakness in the rock.11

10.4 Human Use and Landslides
The effect of human use on the magnitude and fre-
quency of landslides varies from nearly insigniﬁcant
to  very  signiﬁcant.  In  cases  in  which  our  activities
have little to do with the magnitude and frequency
of  landslides,  we  need  to  learn  all  we  can  about
where, when, and why they occur to avoid develop-
ing in hazardous areas and to minimize damage. In
cases in which human use has increased the number
and severity of landslides, we need to learn how to
recognize,  control,  and  minimize  their  occurrence
wherever possible.

Many landslides have been caused by interactions
of adverse geologic conditions, excess moisture, and
artiﬁcial changes in the landscape and slope mater-
ial. The Vaiont Dam and Reservoir slide of 1963 in
Italy is a classic example (see Case History: Vaiont
Dam). Other examples include landslides associated
with timber harvesting, as well as numerous slides
in urban areas.

Timber Harvesting
The possible cause-and-effect relationship between
timber harvesting and erosion in northern Califor-
nia,  Oregon,  and  Washington  is  a  controversial
topic.  There  is  evidence  to  support  the  hypothesis
that  landslides,  especially  shallow  soil  slips,  debris
avalanches, and more deeply seated earthﬂows, are
responsible for much of the erosion in these areas.
In fact, one study in the western Cascade Range of
Oregon concluded that shallow slides are the domi-
nant erosion process in the area. Timber-harvesting
activities,  such  as  clear-cutting  and  road  building
over approximately a 20-year observation period on
geologically  stable  land,  did  not  greatly  increase
landslide-related erosion. During that same time pe-
riod, however, logging on weak, unstable slopes did
increase  landslide  erosion  by  several  times  com-
pared with landslide erosion on forested land.12

The construction of roads in areas to be logged is
an especially serious problem because roads may in-
terrupt surface drainage, alter subsurface movement
of  water,  and  adversely  change  the  distribution  of
mass  on  a  slope  by  cut-and-ﬁll,  or  grading,  opera-
tions.12 As we learn more about erosional processes
in forested areas, we are developing improved man-
agement procedures to minimize the adverse effects
of  timber  harvesting.  Nevertheless,  we  are  not  yet

out  of  the  woods  with  respect  to  landslide  erosion
problems associated with timber harvesting.

Urbanization
Human activities are most likely to cause landslides
in urban areas where there are high densities of peo-
ple and supporting structures, such as roads, homes,
and industries. Examples from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
and Los Angeles, California, illustrate the situation.
Rio de Janeiro, with a population of more than 6
million people, may have more slope-stability prob-
lems than any other city its size.13 The city is noted
for  the  beautiful  granite  peaks  that  spectacularly
frame the urban area (Figure 10.15). Combinations
of steep slopes and fractured rock covered with thin
soil  contribute  to  the  problem.  In  the  past,  many
such slopes were logged for lumber and fuel and to
clear  space  for  agriculture.  Landslides  associated
with  heavy  rainfall  followed  the  logging  activity.
More recently, lack of room on ﬂat ground has led to
increased urban development on slopes. Vegetation
cover has been removed, and roads leading to devel-
opment sites at progressively higher areas are being
built. Excavations have cut the base of many slopes
and severed the soil mantle at critical points. In addi-
tion,  placing  slope  ﬁll  material  below  excavation
areas has increased the load on slopes already unsta-
ble before the fill. Because this area periodically ex-
periences tremendous rainstorms, it is apparent that
Rio de Janeiro has a serious problem.

In February 1988, an intense rainstorm dumped
more than 12 cm (4.7 in.) of rain on Rio de Janeiro
in  4  hours.  The  storm  caused  ﬂooding  and  mud-
slides  that  killed  about  90  people,  leaving  about
3,000 people homeless. Restoration costs exceeded
$100 million. Many of the landslides were initiated
on  steep  slopes  where  housing  was  precarious
and control of stormwater runoff nonexistent. It was
in these hill-hugging shantytown areas that most of
the  deaths  from  mudslides  occurred.  Intense  rain-
fall, as much as 15 cm (6 in) over 24 hours, in Janu-
ary 2011 caused wide spread ﬂash ﬂooding, debris
ﬂows,  debris  avalanches,  and  shallow  landslides
about 60 km northeast of Rio de Janeiro. Over 600
people were killed and thousands become homeless.
The  2011  event  is  the  worst  extreme  rainfall  with
ﬂoods/landslides in Brazil history.

Los Angeles in particular and southern California
in general have experienced a remarkable frequency

of landslides associated with hillside development.
Landslides in southern California result from com-
plex  physical  conditions,  in  part  because  of  the
great  local  variation  in  topography,  rock  and  soil
types,  climate,  and  vegetation.  Interactions  be-
tween the natural environment and human activity
are complex and notoriously unpredictable. For this
reason, the area has the sometimes dubious honor
of showing the ever-increasing value of the study of
urban geology. 14 Los Angeles has led the nation in
developing  building  codes  concerning  grading  for
development.

In  southern  California,  the  grading  process,  in
which benches (referred to as pads) are cut into slopes
for home sites, has been responsible for many land-
slides.  It  took  natural  processes  many  thousands,  if
not millions, of years to produce valleys, ridges, and
hills. In this century, we have developed the machines
to  grade  them.  F.  B.  Leighton  writes:  “With  modern
engineering  and  grading  practices  and  appropriate
ﬁnancial incentive, no hillside appears too rugged for
future development.”14 No Earth material can with-
stand  the  serious  assault  of  modern  technology.
Thus,  human  activity  is  a  geologic  agent  capable  of
carving the landscape as do glaciers and rivers, but at
a tremendously faster pace. Almost overnight, we can
convert steep hills into a series of ﬂat lots and roads,
and  such  conversions  have  led  to  numerous  artiﬁ-
cially induced landslides. As shown in Figure 10.16,

Slide areas

oversteepened slopes in conjunction with increased
water from sprinkled lawns or septic systems, as well
as the additional weight of ﬁll material and a house,
make formerly stable slopes unstable. As a rule, any
project  that  steepens  or  saturates  a  slope  increases
its height or places an extra load on it that may cause
a landslide.14

Landslides  on  both  private  and  public  land  in
Hamilton  County,  Ohio,  have  been  a  serious  prob-
lem. The slides occur in glacial deposits, composed
mostly of clay, lake-bed sediments, and unstratiﬁed
material  called  till,  as  well  as  colluvium  and  soil
formed  on  shale.  The  average  cost  of  damage  ex-
ceeds  $5  million  per  year.  Major  landslides  in
Cincinnati, Ohio, have damaged highways and sev-
eral private structures.19

Modification  of  sensitive  slopes  associated
with  urbanization  in  Allegheny  County,  Pennsyl-
vania,  is  estimated  to  be  responsible  for  90  per-
cent  of  the  landslides  in  the  area.  An  average  of
$2  million  in  damages  results  each  year  from
these  landslides.  Most  of  the  landslides  are  slow
moving,  but  one  rockfall  in  an  adjacent  county
crushed  a  bus  and  killed  22  passengers.  Most  of
the landslides in Allegheny County are caused by
construction activity that loads the top of a slope,
cuts into a sensitive location, such as the toe of a
slope,  or  alters  water  conditions  on  or  beneath
the surface of a slope.15

10.5 Minimizing the Landslide

Hazard

Minimizing  the  landslide  hazard  requires  identify-
ing areas in which landslides are likely to occur, de-
signing slopes or engineering structures to prevent
landslides,  warning  people  in  danger  areas  of  im-
pending slides, and controlling slides after they have
started  moving.  The  most  preferable  and  least  ex-
pensive option to minimize the landslide hazard is
to avoid development on sites where landslides are
occurring or are likely to occur.

Identifying Potential Landslides
Identifying areas with a high potential for landslides
is the ﬁrst step in developing a plan to avoid land-
slide  hazards.  Slide  tendency  can  be  recognized  by
examining both geologic conditions in the ﬁeld and
aerial photographs to identify previous slides. This
information  can  then  be  used  to  evaluate  the  risk
and produce slope stability maps.

Once a landslide hazard is identiﬁed, it must be
evaluated. A landslide inventory, which may be a re-
connaissance  map  showing  areas  that  have  appar-
ently experienced slope failure, should be prepared.
This inventory may be done by aerial photographic
interpretation,  followed  by  an  onsite  check.  At  a
more detailed level, the landslide inventory may be a
map that shows deﬁnite landslide deposits in terms
of their relative activity. Figure 10.17a shows an ex-

ample of such a map for part of Santa Clara County,
California.  Information  concerning  past  landslide
activity  may  then  be  combined  with  land-use  con-
siderations to develop a slope stability or landslide
hazard map with recommended land uses, as shown
in Figure 10.17b. The latter map is of most use to
planners, whereas the former supplies useful infor-
mation  for  engineering  geologists.  These  maps  do
not take the place of detailed ﬁeldwork to evaluate a
speciﬁc site but serve only as a general guideline for
land-use planning and more detailed geologic evalu-
ation.  Determining  the  landslide  risk  and  making
landslide risk maps is more complicated, since it in-
volves the probability of occurrence and assessment
of potential losses.16

Grading  codes  to  minimize  the  landslide  hazard
have  been  in  effect  in  the  Los  Angeles  area  since
1963. These codes were instituted in the aftermath
of the landsliding in the 1950s and 1960s that re-
sulted in great losses of life and property. Since the
grading  codes  have  been  in  effect  and  detailed
engineering geology studies have been required, the
percentage of hillside homes damaged by landslides
and ﬂoods has been greatly reduced. Although ini-
tial  building  costs  are  greater  because  of  the  strict
codes, they are more than balanced by the reduction
of losses in subsequent wet years. Landslide disas-
ters  during  extremely  wet  years  will  continue  to
plague us; however, the application of geologic and
engineering  information  before  hillside  develop-
ment can help minimize the hazard.

Preventing Landslides
Preventing large, natural landslides is difﬁcult, but
common sense and good engineering practices can
help to minimize the hazard. For example, loading
the top of slopes, cutting into sensitive slopes, plac-
ing ﬁlls on slopes, or changing water conditions on
slopes  should  be  avoided  or  done  with  caution.15
Common engineering techniques for landslide pre-
vention  include  provisions  for  surface  and  subsur-
face drainage, removal of unstable slope materials,
construction of retaining walls or other supporting
structures, or some combination of these.5

Drainage Control. Surface and subsurface drainage
control  are  usually  effective  in  stabilizing  a  slope.
The objective is to divert water to keep it from run-
ning  across  or  inﬁltrating  into  the  slope.  Surface
water may be diverted around the slope by a series
of surface drains. This practice is common for road
cuts (Figure 10.18a). The amount of water inﬁltrat-
ing  a  slope  may  also  be  controlled  by  covering  the
slope  with  an  impermeable  layer,  such  as  soil-ce-
ment,  asphalt,  or  even  plastic  (Figure  10.18b).
Groundwater  may  be  inhibited  from  entering  a
slope by constructing subsurface drains. A drainpipe

into the ground) are designed to provide support at
the base of a slope (Figure 10.20). They should be
anchored well below the base of the slope, backﬁlled
with permeable gravel or crushed rock (Figure 10.21)
and provided with drain holes to reduce the chances
of  water  pressure  building  up  in  the  slope  (Figure
10.21). The evolution of a retaining wall is shown in
Figure 10.22 (page 351). A shallow landslide along a
road  causes  a  problem  (Figure  10.22a).  The  wall  is
shown during construction in 1999 in Figure 10.22b.

Benches

with holes along its length is surrounded with per-
meable gravel or crushed rock and is positioned un-
derground so as to intercept and divert groundwater
away from a potentially unstable slope.5

Grading. Although  grading  of  slopes  for  develop-
ment  has  increased  the  landslide  hazard  in  many
areas,  carefully  planned  grading  can  be  used  to
increase slope stability. In a single cut-and-ﬁll opera-
tion,  material  from  the  upper  part  of  a  slope  is
removed and placed near the base. The
overall  gradient  is  thus  reduced,  and
material is removed from an area where
it contributes to the driving forces and
is placed at the toe of the slope, where
it  increases  the  resisting  forces.  How-
ever,  this  method  is  not  practical  on
very steep, high slopes. As an alterna-
tive, the slope may be cut into a series
of  benches  or  steps.  The  benches  are
designed  with  surface  drains  to  divert
runoff. The benches reduce the overall
slope  of  the  land  and  are  good  collec-
tion  sites  for  falling  rock  and  small
slides (Figure 10.19).5

savings will vary from $10 to
$2,000.17 The  cost  of  not
preventing  a  slide  is  illus-
trated  by  the  massive  land-
slide  in  Utah  known  as  the
Thistle  slide.  In  April  1983,
this  slide  moved  across  a
canyon,  creating  a  natural
dam  about  60  m  (197  ft)
high  and  ﬂooding  the  com-
munity  of  Thistle,  the  Den-
ver–Rio Grande Railroad and
its  switchyard,  and  a  major
U.S. highway (Figure 10.23,

sponse  to  high  precipita-
tion.  Therefore, 
it  could
have  been  recognized  that
the extremely high amounts
of  precipitation 
in  1983
would  cause  a  problem.  In
fact,  a  review  of  the  land-
slide  history  suggests  that
the  Thistle  landslide  was
recognizable, 
predictable,
and preventable! Analysis of
the pertinent data suggests
that  emplacement  of  sub-
surface  drains  and  control
of  surface  runoff  would
have 
lowered  the  water
table 
in  the  slide  mass
enough  to  have  prevented
failure. The cost of prevent-
ing  the  landslide  was  esti-
mated  to  be  between  $300,000  and  $500,000,  a
small  amount  compared  with  the  damages  caused
by  the  slide.17 Because  the  beneﬁt-to-cost  ratio  in
landslide  prevention  is  so  favorable,  it  seems  pru-
dent to evaluate active and potentially active land-
slides  in  areas  where  considerable  damage  may  be
expected and possibly prevented.

Preventing landslides can be expensive, but the re-
wards can be well worth the effort. It has been esti-
mated that the beneﬁt-to-cost ratio for landslide pre-
vention ranges from approximately 10 to 2,000. That

Warning of Impending Landslides
Landslide  warning  systems  do  not  prevent  land-
slides, but they can provide time to evacuate peo-
ple  and  their  possessions  and  to  stop  trains  or
reroute  trafﬁc.  Surveillance  provides  the  simplest
type  of  warning.  Hazardous  areas  can  be  visually
inspected for apparent changes, and small rockfalls
on roads and other areas can be noted for quick re-
moval.  Human  monitoring  of  the  hazard  has  the
advantages  of  reliability  and  ﬂexibility  but  be-
comes  disadvantageous  during  adverse  weather
locations.18 Other  warning
and 
methods  include  electrical  systems,  tilt  meters,
and geophones that pick up vibrations from mov-
ing rocks. Shallow wells can be monitored to signal
when slopes contain a dangerous amount of water.
These  methods  are  part  of  real-time  monitoring
(Figure 10.24, page 353).19 In some regions, moni-
toring  rainfall  is  useful  for  detecting  when  a
threshold  precipitation  has  been  exceeded  and
shallow soil slips become more probable.

Correcting Landslides
After a slide has begun, the best way to stop it is to
attack  the  process  that  started  the  slide.  In  most
cases, the cause of the slide is an increase in water
pressure,  and,  in  such  cases,  an  effective  drainage
program  must  be  initiated.  This  may  include  in-

stalling  surface  drains  at  the  head  of  the  slide  to
keep additional surface water from inﬁltrating and
subsurface drainpipes or wells to remove water and
lower the water pressure. Draining tends to increase
the resisting force of the slope material, thereby sta-
bilizing the slope.9

10.6 Snow Avalanches
A snow avalanche is a rapid downslope movement
of  snow  and  ice,  sometimes  with  the  addition  of
rock, soil, and trees. Thousands of avalanches occur
every  year  in  the  western  United  States.  As  more
people  venture  into  avalanche-prone  areas  and
more development occurs in these areas, the loss of
life  and  property  due  to  avalanches  increases.  The
most damaging avalanches occur when a large slab
of snow and ice, weighing millions of tons, fails due

placed explosives, constructing buildings
and  structures  to  divert  or  retard  ava-
lanches, or planting trees in avalanche-
prone  areas  to  better  anchor  the  snow
on slopes.

10.7 Subsidence
Interactions  between  geologic  condi-
tions and human activity have been fac-
tors  in  numerous  incidents  of  sub-
sidence, the very slow to rapid sinking
or  settling  of  Earth  materials  (Figure
10.5k). Most subsidence is caused either
by the withdrawal of ﬂuids from subsur-
face reservoirs or by the collapse of sur-
face and near-surface soil and rocks over
subterranean voids.

Slide
blocks

FIGURE 10.23 Landslide blocks a canyon Thistle landslide, Utah. This
landslide, which occurred in 1983, involved the reactivation of an older slide. The
landslide blocked the canyon, creating a natural dam, ﬂooding the community of
Thistle, the Denver–Rio Grande Railroad, and a major U.S. highway. (Michael Collier)

Withdrawal of Fluids
The  withdrawal  of  ﬂuids—such  as  oil
with  associated  gas  and  water,  ground-
water, and mixtures of steam and water
for geothermal power—can cause subsi-
dence.20 In all cases, the general princi-
ples are the same: Fluids in Earth mate-
rials  below  Earth’s  surface  have  a  high
ﬂuid pressure that tends to support the
material above. This is why a large rock
at  the  bottom  of  a  swimming  pool
seems  lighter:  Buoyancy  produced  by
the liquid tends to lift the rock. If sup-
port or buoyancy is removed from Earth
materials  through  pumping  out  of  the
ﬂuid,  the  support  is  reduced,  and  sur-

to the overloading of a slope with fresh snow or to
development  of  zones  of  weakness  within  the
snowpack.  These  slabs  move  rapidly  downslope  at
velocities  of  up  to  100  km  per  hour  (62  mi  per
hour). Avalanches tend to move down tracks, called
chutes,  that  have  previously  produced  avalanches
(Figure 10.25, page 354). As a result, maps delin-
eating  the  hazard  may  be  developed.  Avoiding 
hazardous areas is obviously the preferred and least
expensive adjustment to avalanches. Other adjust-
ments  include  clearing  excess  snow  with  carefully

face subsidence may result.

Thousands  of  square  kilometers  of  the  central
valley of California have subsided as a result of over-
pumping  groundwater  in  the  area  (Figure  10.26a,
page 355). More than 5,000 km2 (1,930 mi2) in the
Los Banos–Kettleman City area alone have subsided
more than 0.3 m (1 ft). Within this area, one stretch
of valley 113 km (70 mi) long has subsided an aver-
age  of  more  than  3  m  (10  ft),  with  a  maximum  of
about 9 m (30 ft) (Figure 10.26b). As the water was
mined, the pore pressure was reduced and the grains
were  compacted;21,22 the  effect  at  the  surface  was

subsidence (Figure 10.27, page 356). Similar exam-
ples of subsidence caused by overpumping are docu-
mented  near  Phoenix,  Arizona;  Las  Vegas,  Nevada;
Houston–Galveston, Texas; and Mexico City, Mexico.
The subsidence can cause extremely long, deep sur-
face fissures (open cracks) to form in sediments.22

Sinkholes
Subsidence  is  also  caused  by  removal  of  subter-
ranean  Earth  materials  by  natural  processes.
Voids—large open spaces such as caves—often form

by chemical weathering within soluble rocks, such as
limestone,  dolomite,  and  evaporite  rocks  such  as
gypsum and salt. The resulting lack of support for
overlying rock may cause it to collapse. The result is
the formation of a sinkhole, a circular area of subsi-
dence caused by the collapse of a near-surface sub-
terranean void or room in a cavern.

The popular news media (newspapers, TV, and In-
ternet) often report about sinkholes. However these
sources,  in  addition  to  referring  to  sinkholes  as  de-
ﬁned above, often refer to sinkholes as a more general
process of subsidence of a road, building parking lot,
etc. due to a break in a water line or subsurface drain
line (example sewer line) that washes out subsurface
sediment leaving a subsurface hole or void. Collapse
over  the  void  results  in  collapse  at  the  surface,  re-
ported as a sinkhole.

Sinkholes  have  caused  considerable  damage  to
highways, homes, sewage facilities, and other struc-
tures. Natural or artiﬁcial ﬂuctuations in the water
table  are  probably  the  trigger  mechanism.  High
water table conditions enlarge the cavern closer to
the surface of Earth by dissolving material, and the
buoyancy  of  the  water  helps  support  the  overbur-
den. Lowering of the water table eliminates some of
the  buoyant  support  and  facilitates  collapse.  On

of only a few minutes, the collapse left a pit approxi-

deep.  Fortunately,  the  damage  was  conﬁned  to  a
street,  parking  lots,  sidewalks,  sewer  lines,  water
lines, and utilities. Seventeen residences adjacent to
the sinkhole narrowly escaped damage or loss; sub-
sequent  stabilization  and  repair  costs  were  nearly
$500,000. Figure 10.29 (page 357) shows the gen-
eralized geology of Lehigh Valley. The northern part
of  the  valley  is  underlain  by  shale,  whereas  the
southern portion is underlain by limestone. The val-
ley is bounded by resistant sandstone rocks to the
north  and  resistant  Precambrian  igneous  rocks  to
the south (Figure 10.29).24

Photographs from the 1940s to 1969 provide evi-
dence  of  the  sinkhole’s  history.  In  the  1940s,  the
sinkhole was delineated by a pond approximately 65
m (213 ft) in diameter. By 1958, the pond had dried
up, the sinkhole was covered by vegetation, and the
surrounding area was planted in crops. Ground pho-
tographs in 1960 suggest that people were using the
sinkhole as a site to dump tree stumps, blocks of as-
phalt, and other trash. By 1969, there was no sur-
face  expression  of  the  sinkhole;  it  was  completely
ﬁlled, and corn was planted over it.

Even  though  the  sinkhole  was  completely  ﬁlled
with trash and other debris, it continued to receive

(a)

May  8,  1981,  this  process  was  dramatically  illus-
trated in Winter Park, Florida, when a large sinkhole
began developing. The sink grew rapidly for 3 days,
swallowing  part  of  a  community  swimming  pool,
parts of two businesses, several automobiles, and a
house (Figure 10.28, page 357). Damage caused by
the  sinkhole  exceeded  $2  million.  Sinkholes  form
nearly  every  year  in  central  Florida  when  the
groundwater level is lowest. The Winter Park sink-
hole  formed  during  a  drought,  when  groundwater
levels were at a record low. Although the exact posi-
tions of sinkholes cannot be predicted, their occur-
rence  is  greater  during  droughts;  in  fact,  several
smaller sinkholes developed at about the same time
as  the  Winter  Park  event.23 On  June  23,  1986,  a
large subsidence pit developed at the site of an un-
recognized, ﬁlled sinkhole in Lehigh Valley near Al-
lentown,  in  eastern  Pennsylvania.  Within  a  period

runoff water that was later increased in volume by
urbanization.  Sources  of  water  included  storm
runoff  from  adjacent  apartments  and  townhouses,
streets, and parking lots. It is also suspected that an
old, leaking water line contributed to runoff into the
sinkhole  area.  In  addition,  urbanization  placed  in-
creased demand on local groundwater resources, re-
sulting in the lowering of the water table. Geologists
believe  that  hydrologic  conditions  contributed  to
the sudden failure. The increased urban runoff facil-
itated the loosening or removal of the plug—that is,
the  soil,  clay,  and  trash  that  ﬁlled  the  sinkhole—
while the lowering of the groundwater reduced the
overlying support, as was the case with the Winter
Park  sinkhole.  Sinkholes  are  discussed  further  in
Chapter 13, with groundwater processes.

methods:  Water  is  injected  through  wells  into  salt
deposits,  the  salt  dissolves,  and  water  supersatu-
rated with salt is pumped out. Because the removal
of salt leaves a cavity in the rock and weakens sup-
port for the overlying rock, it may lead to large-scale
subsidence.

On November 21, 1980, a bizarre example of subsi-
dence associated with a salt mine occurred in south-
ern Louisiana. Lake Peigneur, a shallow lake with an
average  depth  of  1  m  (3.3  ft),  drained  after  the  col-
lapse of the salt mine below it. The collapse occurred
after  an  oil-drilling  operation  apparently  punched  a
hole into an abandoned mine shaft of the Jefferson
Island Salt Dome, a still-active multimillion-dollar salt
mine located about 430 m (1,410 ft) below the surface.
As water entering the mine enlarged the hole, pillars
of salt were scoured and dissolved, causing the roof of
the mine to collapse and producing a large subsidence
pit (Figure 10.30, page 358).

The lake drained so fast that 10 barges, a tugboat,
and an oil-drilling barge disappeared in a whirlpool

356

of water into the mine. Fortunately, the 50 miners
and 7 people on the oil rig escaped. The subsidence
also claimed more than 0.25 km2 (0.1 mi2) of Jefferson
Island, including historic botanical gardens, green-

houses,  and  a  $500,000  private  home.  The  re-
maining gardens were disrupted by large fractures
that dropped the land down to the new edge of the
lake.  These  fractures  are  formed  as  the  land  sinks
and are commonly found on the margins
of large subsidence pits.

Lake Peigneur immediately began reﬁll-

to  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and  nine  of  the
barges popped to the surface 2 days later.
There  was  fear  at  ﬁrst  that  even  greater
subsidence  would  take  place  as  pillars  of
salt holding up the roof of the salt dome
dissolved.  However,  the  hole  was  appar-
ently sealed by debris in the form of soil
and lake sediment that was pulled into the
mine.  Approximately  15  million  m3 (530
million  ft3)  of  water  entered  the  salt
dome, and the mine was a total loss. The
previously  shallow  lake  now  has  a  large,
deep hole in the bottom, which undoubt-
edly  will  change  its  aquatic  ecology.  In  a

Coal Mining
Subsurface  mining  of  coal  in
the  western  and  eastern
United  States  has  produced
serious  subsidence  problems.
The  subsidence  is  most  com-
mon where underground min-
ing  is  close  to  the  surface  of
the  land  or  where  the  rocks
left as pillars after mining are
weak  or  intensely  fractured.
Usually,  only  50  percent  of
the  coal  is  removed,  leaving
the  remainder  as  pillars  that
support 
formed
from  the  rocks  overlying  the
mine.  Over  time,  the  pillars
weather,  weaken,  and  col-
lapse,  producing  the  surface
subsidence.25 In  the  United
States,  more  than  8,000  km2
(3,090  mi2)  of  land  has  sub-
sided due to underground coal
mining,  and  subsidence  con-
tinues  today,  long  after  min-
ing has terminated. In 1995, a
coal  mine  that  was  last  oper-
ated  in  the  1930s  collapsed
beneath  a  600  m  (1,970  ft)
length  of  Interstate  Highway  70  in  Ohio;  repairs
took  3  months.25 Subsidence  most  often  affects
farmland  and  rangelands  but  has  also  damaged

including  Scranton,  Wilkes-Barre,  and  Pittsburgh,

10.8 Perception of the Landslide

Hazard

A  common  reaction  of  homeowners  concerning
landslides is, “It could happen on other hillsides, but
never  this  one.”14 Just  as  ﬂood  hazard  mapping
does not prevent development in ﬂood-prone areas,
landslide hazard maps will probably not prevent all
people from moving into hazardous areas. Prospec-
tive hillside occupants who are initially unaware of
the hazards may not all be swayed by technical in-
formation. The infrequency of large slides tends to
reduce  awareness  of  the  hazard  where  evidence  of
past  events  is  not  readily  visible.  Unfortunately,  it
often  takes  catastrophic  events  that  claim  numer-
ous expensive homes to bring the problem to peo-
ple’s  attention.  In  the  meantime,  people  in  many
parts of the Rocky Mountains, Appalachian Moun-
tains, California, and other areas continue to build
homes in areas subject to future landslides.

What You Can Do to Minimize Your
Landslide Hazard
Consider the following advice if purchasing property
on a slope:

• Landslides often involve complex geology, and
a geologic evaluation by a professional geologist
of any property on a slope is recommended.

• Avoid homes at the mouth of a canyon, even a
small one, where debris ﬂows or mudﬂows may
originate  from  upstream  slopes  and  travel
down the canyon.

• Consult  local  agencies,  such  as  city  or  county
engineering  departments,  that  may  be  aware
of landslides in your area.

• Watch out for “little landslides” in the corner
of  the  property—they  usually  get  larger  with
time.

Summary

359

• If purchasing a home, look for cracks in house
walls  and  for  retaining  walls  that  lean  or  are
cracked.  Be  wary  of  doors  or  windows  that
stick or ﬂoors that are uneven. Check founda-
tions for cracks or tilting. If cracks in the walls
or the foundation can be followed to the land
outside the house, be especially concerned that
a landslide may be present.

• Be  wary  of  leaks  in  a  swimming  pool,  trees
tilted downslope, and utility wires that are taut
or sagging.

• Be wary if small springs are present, as landslides
tend  to  leak  water.  Look  for  especially  “green
areas,” where more subsurface water is present.
• Walk  the  property  and  surrounding  property,
if possible, looking for linear or curved cracks

(even small ones) that might indicate incipient
instability of the land.

• Active  landslides  often  have  hummocks  or

steplike ground features.

• Fixing a potential landslide problem is often
cost-effective,  but  it  can  still  be  expensive,
and  much  of  the  ﬁx  is  below  ground,  where
you will never see the improvement. It is bet-
ter to not purchase land with a potential land-
slide hazard!

The presence of one or more of these features is
not proof of the presence of a landslide. For example,
cracks  in  walls  and  foundations  can  be  caused  by
soils that shrink and swell. However, further investi-
gation is warranted if the above features are present.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About La Conchita to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. What will be the likely role of

human population and land use
in La Conchita over the next 50
years if nothing is done?

2. How are science and values

linked to reducing the landslide
hazard at La Conchita?

3. Can La Conchita be a sustainable

community over the next 100
years? How?

4. What can be learned from the
landslide hazard at La Conchita
that is applicable to other locations
with a potential landslide hazard?

Summary

Landslides and related phenomena
cause substantial damages and loss of
life. Although they are natural events,
their occurrence can be increased or
decreased by human activity.

The most common landforms are

slopes—dynamic, evolving systems in
which surface material is constantly
moving downslope, or mass wasting,
at rates varying from imperceptible
creep to thundering avalanches. Slope
failure may involve ﬂowage, slumping,
sliding, or falling of Earth materials;
landslides are often complex combina-
tions of sliding and ﬂowage.

The forces that produce landslides
are determined by the interactions of
several variables: the type of Earth

material on the slope, topography and
slope angle, climate, vegetation, water,
and time. The cause of most landslides
can be determined by examining the
relations between forces that tend to
make Earth materials slide, the dri-
ving forces, and forces that tend to op-
pose movement, the resisting forces.
The most common driving force is the
weight of the slope materials, and the
most common resisting force is the
strength of the slope materials. The
factor of safety (FS) of a slope is the
ratio of resisting forces to driving
forces; a ratio A FS greater than about
1.25 means that the slope is likely sta-
ble. If the FS is between 1 and 1.25,
the slope is conditionally stable. A FS

less than 1 indicates potential slope
failure. The type of rock or soil on a
slope inﬂuences both the type and the
frequency of landslides.

Water has an especially signiﬁcant
role in producing landslides. Water in
streams, lakes, or oceans erodes the
base of slopes, increasing the driving
forces. Excess water increases the
weight of the slope materials while
raising the water pressure. Increased
water pressure, in turn, decreases the
resisting forces in the slope materials.
The effects of human use on the mag-
nitude and frequency of landslides
vary from insigniﬁcant to very signiﬁ-
cant. When landslides occur indepen-
dently of human activity, we need to

360

CHAPTER 10

Slope Processes, Landslides, and Subsidence

learn enough about them to avoid de-
velopment in hazardous areas or to
provide protective measures. In other
cases, when human use has increased
the number and severity of landslides,
we need to learn how to minimize
these occurrences. In some cases,
dams and reservoirs have increased
migration of groundwater into slopes,
resulting in slope failure. Logging op-
erations on weak, unstable slopes have
increased landslide erosion. Grading
of slopes for development has created
or increased erosion problems in
many urbanized areas of the world.
Minimizing landslide hazards re-
quires identiﬁcation, prevention, and
correction procedures. Monitoring
and mapping techniques facilitate
identiﬁcation of hazardous sites.
Identiﬁcation of potential landslides
has been used to establish grading

codes, and landslide damage in these
areas has been decreased. Prevention
of large natural slides is very difﬁcult,
but careful engineering practices can
do much to minimize the hazard when
it cannot be avoided. Engineering tech-
niques for landslide prevention include
drainage control, proper grading, and
construction of supports, such as re-
taining walls. Correction of landslides
must attack the processes that started
the slide; this usually means initiating
a drainage program that lowers water
pressure in the slope.

Snow avalanches present a serious
hazard on snow-covered, steep slopes.
Loss of human life due to avalanches is
increasing as more people venture into
mountain areas for winter recreation.

Withdrawal of ﬂuids, such as oil

and water, and subsurface mining of
salt, coal, and other minerals have

caused widespread subsidence. In the
case of ﬂuid withdrawal, the cause of
subsidence is a reduction of water
pressures that tend to support over-
lying Earth materials. In the case of
solid-material removal, subsidence
may result from loss of support for
the overlying material. The latter sit-
uation may occur naturally when
voids are formed in soluble rock, such
as limestone, and the collapse of
overlying Earth material produces
sinkholes.

Most people perceive the landslide
hazard as minimal, unless they have
prior experience with landslides. Fur-
thermore, hillside residents, like
ﬂoodplain occupants, are not easily
swayed by technical information.
Nevertheless, the wise person will
have a geologist inspect property on a
slope before purchasing.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
By 2050, the world’s population will
have increased by about 50 percent.
Having 3 billion more people to feed
and house will place increased stress
on the environment. More people will
be living on steep slopes where land-
slides are likely to occur. Therefore,
we must learn more about how to
minimize the landslide hazard in
order to reduce potential losses of
human life and property.

Sustainability If we want future
generations to inherit a quality envi-
ronment, we must work to minimize
the magnitude and frequency of
human-induced landslides. When we
remove trees from hill slopes or inten-
sively urbanize hill slopes, landslides
increase in both size and number.
Landsliding is an erosion process, re-
moving vegetation and soils, along
with valuable land resources that fu-
ture generations will need.

Earth as a System Hill slopes
are complex systems with physical,
chemical, hydrologic, biological,

and human components. When we
change one part of the system
through land use change, we cause
other changes that may affect the
stability of the slope. This is an ex-
ample of the principle of environ-
mental unity. Slopes are very sensi-
tive to changes in hydrology, and
when trees are removed, the
amount of water that infiltrates the
soil or runs off the land changes.
Trees use a lot of soil water through
the process of transpiration, which
is loss of water through leaves and
other plant tissue. When trees or
other vegetation are removed, this
process stops, and the amount of
water in the soil may increase. Wet
slopes are more prone to landslid-
ing than are dry slopes. If trees are
logged, the roots may die and decay.
When they do, the soil loses some
strength because root systems bind
the soil together. The combined 
effects of wetter soils and reduced
soil strength as tree roots decay 
result in more shallow landslides.
This concept explains the signifi-
cant increase in shallow landslides

that occurs several years after 
logging.

Hazardous Earth Processes,
Risk Assessment, and 
Perception People are basically
optimistic about where they wish to
live, and their perception of landslide
risk reﬂects this optimism. Educa-
tion about potential risks and con-
struction of hazard maps are neces-
sary to help inform people about 
the potential hazards of hillside
development.

Scientific Knowledge and
Values Physical, chemical, and bio-
logical processes operating on hill
slopes are fairly well understood. We
also know the risks associated with
hillside development and the meth-
ods to reduce the landslide hazard. As
more people in the future are forced
by economics or lured by the view to
live in hazardous areas on steep hill
slopes, we need to examine our val-
ues. How can we provide safe housing
for growing urban areas, especially in
developing countries? Too often

“shantytowns” develop on undesir-
able steep lands that have been
cleared of forest. These areas, when
hit by intense rainstorms or shaken

by earthquakes, commonly produce
slides that may kill hundreds to thou-
sands of people. This scenario does
not have to be replayed again and

again if we place value on human life
and apply principles of sound land
use planning for people moving to
urban centers.

Coastal Processes

Learning Objectives
In this chapter, we focus on one of the most dynamic environments on Earth—the coast, where the
sea meets the land. The beauty of the coastal zone, with its salty smells and the sight and sound of
wind and waves striking the land, has inspired poets and artists for thousands of years. Beaches
composed of sand or pebbles and rocky coastlines continue to attract tourists like few other areas.
Yet most of us have little understanding of how ocean waves form and change the coastlines of the
world. A major purpose of this chapter is to remove the mystery of how coastal areas are formed
and maintained, while retaining the wonder. We seek to understand the hazards resulting from

wind, waves, and storms, and how we can learn to live in the ever-changing coastal environment

while sustaining its beauty. We will focus on the following learning objectives:

• Know the basic

terminology of waves
and the processes of
waves

• Be able to deﬁne the

basic components of a
beach

• Know what rip currents
are and why they are a
serious hazard to
swimmers

• Know the major

processes related to
coastal erosion

• Understand how human
activities affect coastal
erosion

• Understand why we are

at a crossroads with
respect to adjustments
to coastal erosion

• Understand the process

of littoral transport of
sediment

• Understand the various
engineering approaches
to shoreline protection

• Understand what tropi-
cal cyclones are and the
hazards they produce

Case History
The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Controversy

In North Carolina, a dramatic
collision of opinions con-
cerning beach erosion was
played out in recent years.
Historically, North Car-
olina had adhered to
the philosophy that
beach erosion is a
natural process with
which its residents
can live. When ero-
sion began to
threaten the his-
toric Cape Hat-
teras Lighthouse
(Figure 11.1a),
this philosophy
was tested. The
lighthouse is
located near Bux-
ton, on North 
Carolina’s barrier
islands known as
the Outer Banks.
When the lighthouse
was originally con-

structed in the late nine-

teenth century, it was ap-
proximately 500 m (1,640 ft)
from the sea. By the early 1990s,
it was only 100 m (328 ft) away from
the sea and in danger of being de-
stroyed by a major storm. Ofﬁcials in
the area had to weigh the following
options:

• Artiﬁcially  control  coastal  erosion
at the site and reverse state policy
of  yielding  to  erosion.  The  U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers originally
proposed to protect the lighthouse
by constructing a $5.6 million sea-
wall around the base.1

• Do nothing and eventually lose the
lighthouse and, thus, an important
bit of American history.

• Move the lighthouse inland. Many

local people opposed this plan,
fearing that the lighthouse would
collapse if moved.1
Following much discussion, argu-
ment, and controversy over what to
do, the National Park Service made
the decision to move the lighthouse
inland approximately 500 m (1,640
ft) from the eastern shore of Hatteras
Island at a cost of about $12 million.
The decision to move the lighthouse
was based on several factors. It was
consistent with the philosophy of
ﬂexible coastal zone planning to
avoid hazardous zones rather than
attempting to control natural
processes. It was also consistent with
North Carolina’s policy to preserve
historic objects, such as the light-
house, for the enjoyment of future
generations. The lighthouse was suc-
cessfully moved during the summer
of 1999 (Figure 11.1b). Given the

present rate of coastal erosion, the
lighthouse should be safe in its new
location until the middle or end of
the twenty-ﬁrst century. Hurricane
Dennis struck the island in 1999,
after the lighthouse was moved, and
the historic structure was not signiﬁ-
cantly damaged.2

Another lighthouse battle is

looming on the East Coast. Hun-
dreds of homes and other buildings
along the coast on Long Island, New
York, are now close to the actively
eroding shore line. Included is the
famous Montauk Lighthouse (Figure
11.2), which was constructed in
1796 on a bluff 100 m (328 ft) from
the ocean and is now about 25 m 
(82 ft) from the ocean. One group
argues for an improved hard struc-
ture, consisting of a multimillion-
dollar, 280 m (920 ft)-long rock
revetment (i.e., rock seawall) to
protect the base of the bluff from
erosion. Another group is arguing to
move the lighthouse inland. Moving
the lighthouse would be a challenge,
and the rock revetment might
change the coastline, causing prob-
lems in adjacent areas. The rock
solution might also set a precedent
for hard structural control of beach
erosion on Long Island and other
East Coast areas.

11.1 Introduction 

to Coastal Hazards

Coastal areas are dynamic environments that vary in
their topography, climate, and vegetation. Continen-
tal  and  oceanic  processes  converge  along  coasts  to
produce  landscapes  that  are  characteristically  capa-
ble  of  rapid  change.  The  East  Coast  of  the  United
States is a passive margin coastline far from a con-

vergent plate boundary (see Chapter 2). The coast-
line is  characterized  by  a  wide  continental  shelf
with  barrier  islands  with  wide,  sandy  beaches.
Rocky  coastlines  are  mostly  restricted  to  the  New
England  coast,  where  the  Appalachian  Mountains
merge with the Atlantic Ocean. The West Coast is
close  to  the  convergent  boundary  between  the
North American and Paciﬁc plates (i.e., it is an ac-
tive margin coast). Mountain building has produced

a coastline with sea cliffs and rocky coastlines. Long,
sandy  beaches  are  present  but  not  as  abundant  as
along the East Coast.

The impact of hazardous coastal processes is con-
siderable because many populated areas are located
near the coast. In the United States, it is expected
that most of the population will eventually be con-
centrated along the nation’s 150,000 km (93,000 mi)
of  shoreline,  including  the  Great  Lakes.  Today,  the

nation’s largest cities lie in the coastal zone, and ap-
proximately  75  percent  of  the  population  lives  in
coastal states.3 Coastal problems will, thus, increase
because  so  many  more  people  will  live  in  coastal
areas where the hazards occur. Once again, our ac-
tivities continue to conﬂict with natural processes!
Hazards along the coasts may become compounded
by the fact that global warming and the accompany-
ing global rise in sea level are increasing the coastal

erosion problem. (Climate change and sea level rise
are discussed in Chapter 18.)

The most serious coastal hazards are the following:

• Rip currents generated in the surf zone
• Coastal  erosion,  which  continues  to  produce
considerable  property  damage  that  requires
human adjustment

• Tsunami,  or  seismic  sea  waves  (discussed  in
Chapter 7), which are particularly hazardous to
coastal areas of the Paciﬁc Ocean

• Tropical  cyclones,  called  hurricanes in  the  At-
lantic and typhoons in the Paciﬁc, which claim
many  lives  and  cause  enormous  amounts  of
property damage every year

11.2 Coastal Processes
Waves
Waves  that  batter  the  coast  are  generated  by  off-
shore  storms,  sometimes  thousands  of  kilometers
from the shoreline where they will expend their en-
ergy. Wind blowing over the water produces friction
along the air–water boundary. Since the air is mov-
ing  much  faster  than  the  water,  the  moving  air
transfers some of its energy to the water, resulting
in  waves.  The  waves,  in  turn,  eventually  expend
their energy at the shoreline. The size of the waves
produced depends on the following:

• The velocity, or speed, of the wind. The greater

the wind velocity, the larger the waves.

• The duration of the wind. Storms of longer du-
ration have more time to impart energy to the
water, producing larger waves.

• The  distance  that  the  wind  blows  across  the
surface, or fetch. The longer the fetch, the larg-
er the waves.

Within the area of the storm, the ocean waves have
a variety of sizes and shapes, but, as they move away
from  their  place  of  origin,  they  become  sorted  out
into groups of similar waves. These groups of waves
may travel for long distances across the ocean and ar-
rive at distant shores with very little energy loss.

The basic shape, or wave form, of waves moving
across deep water is shown in Figure 11.3a. The im-
portant parameters are wave height, which is the dif-
ference in height between the wave’s trough and its

peak, and wave length, the distance between succes-
sive peaks. The wave period (P) is the time in seconds
for successive waves to pass a reference point. If you
were ﬂoating with a life preserver in deep water and
could record your motion as waves moved through
your  area,  you  would  ﬁnd  that  you  bob  up,  down,
forward,  and  back  in  a  circular  orbit,  returning  to
about the same place. If you were below the surface
with a breathing apparatus, you would still move in
circles, but the circle would be smaller. That is, you
would move up, down, forward, and back in a circu-
lar orbit that would remain in the same place while
the waves traveled through. This concept is shown
in Figure 11.3b. When waves enter shallow water at a
depth of less than about one-half their wavelength (L),
they  “feel  bottom.”  The  circular  orbits  change  to
become ellipses; the motion at the bottom may be a
very narrow ellipse, or essentially horizontal—that
is,  forward  and  back  (Figure  11.3c).  You  may  have
experienced this phenomenon if you have stood or
have  swum  in  relatively  shallow  water  on  a  beach
and  felt  the  water  repeatedly  push  you  toward  the
shore and then back out toward the sea.

The wave groups generated by storms far out at
sea  are  called  swell. As  the  swell  enters  shallower
and  shallower  water,  transformations  take  place
that  eventually  lead  to  the  waves  breaking  on  the
shore.  For  deep-water  conditions,  there  are  equa-
tions  to  predict  wave  height,  period,  and  velocity
based on the fetch, wind velocity, and length of time
that  the  wind  blows  over  the  water.  This  informa-
tion has important environmental consequences: By
predicting the velocity and height of the waves, we
can  estimate  when  waves  with  a  particular  erosive
capability  generated  by  a  distant  storm  will  strike
the shoreline.

We  have  said  that  waves  expend  their  energy
when  they  reach  the  coastline.  But  just  how  much
energy are we talking about? The amount is surpris-
ingly large. For example, the energy expended on a
400 km (250 mi) length of open coastline by waves
with a height of about 1 m (3.3 ft) over a given pe-
riod of time is approximately equivalent to the en-
ergy  produced  by  one  average-sized  nuclear  power
plant  over  the  same  time  period.4 Wave  energy  is
approximately  proportional  to  the  square  of  the
wave height. Thus, if wave height increases to 2 m
(6.6 ft), the wave energy increases by a factor of 22,
or 4. If wave height increases to 5 m (16 ft), which is
typical for large storms, then the energy expended,

form (water depth is greater than 0.5 L, where L is wave length).
The ratio of wave height to wave length is deﬁned as wave steep-
ness. If wave height exceeds about 10 percent (0.1) of the wave
length, the wave becomes unstable and will break. Our drawing
exaggerates wave height for illustrative purposes. The steepness of
the waves in the drawing is about 1/3, or 0.33, which would be
very unstable and would not exist long in nature. (b) Motion of

When  waves  enter  the  coastal  zone  and  shallow

wave length. As waves move into shallow water, the
wave period remains constant, but wave length and
velocity  decrease  and  wave  height  increases.  The

368

CHAPTER 11

Coastal Processes

waves  change  shape  from  rounded  crests  and
troughs  in  deep  water  to  peaked  crests  with  rela-
tively  ﬂat  troughs  in  shallow  water  close  to  shore.
Perhaps the most dramatic feature of waves enter-
ing  shallow  water  is  their  rapid  increase  in  height.
The  height  of  waves  in  shallow  water,  where  they
break,  may  be  as  much  as  twice  their  deep-water
height (Figure 11.3c). Waves near the shoreline, just
outside the surf zone, reach a wave steepness that is
unstable. The instability causes the waves to break
and expend their energy on the shoreline.5

Although wave heights offshore are relatively con-
stant, the local wave height may increase or decrease
when the wave front (see Figure 11.4a) reaches the

near-shore environment. This change can be attrib-
uted to irregularities in the offshore topography and
the shape of the coastline. Figure 11.4a is an idealized
diagram showing a rocky point, or headland, between
two relatively straight reaches of coastline. The off-
shore topography is similar to that of the coastline.
As a wave front approaches the coastline, the shape
of  the  front  changes  and  becomes  more  parallel  to
the  coastline.  This  change  occurs  because,  as  the
waves  enter  shallow  water,  they  slow  down ﬁrst
where the water is shallowest, that is, off the rocky
point.  The  result  is  a  bending,  or  refraction,  of  the
wave front. In Figure 11.4a, the lines drawn perpen-
dicular  to  the  wave  fronts,  with  arrows  pointing

toward  the  shoreline,  are  known  as  wave  normals.
Notice that, due to the bending of the wave fronts by
refraction, there is a convergence of the wave normals
at the headland, or rocky point, and a divergence of the
wave normals at the beaches, or embayments. Where
wave  normals  converge,  wave  height  increases;  as  a
result, wave energy expenditure at the shoreline also
increases.  Figure  11.4b shows  a  photograph  of  large
waves striking a rocky headland.

The  long-term  effect  of  greater  energy  expendi-
ture on protruding areas is that wave erosion tends
to  straighten  the  shoreline.  The  total  energy  from
waves reaching a coastline during a particular time
interval  may  be  fairly  constant,  but  there  may  be
considerable local variability of energy expenditure
when the waves break on the shoreline. In addition,
breaking waves may peak up quickly and plunge or
surge,  or  they  may  gently  spill,  depending  on  local

conditions,  such  as  the  steepness  of  the  shoreline
(Figure 11.5) and the height and length of waves ar-
riving at the shoreline from a distant storm. Plunging
breakers tend  to  be  highly  erosive  at  the  shoreline,
whereas spilling breakers are more gentle and may fa-
cilitate the deposition of sand on beaches. The large
plunging  breakers  that  occur  during  storms  cause
much of the coastal erosion we observe.

Beach Form and Beach Processes
A  beach is  a  landform  consisting  of  loose  material,
such as sand or gravel, that has accumulated by wave
action at the shoreline. Beaches may be composed of
a variety of loose material in the shore zone, the com-
position of which depends on the environment. For
example, many Paciﬁc island beaches include broken
bits of shell and coral; Hawaii’s black sand beaches are

composed of volcanic rock; and grains of quartz and
feldspar are found on the beaches of southern Cali-
fornia. Figure 11.6 shows the basic terminology of an
idealized near-shore environment. The landward ex-
tension  of  the  beach  terminates  at  a  natural  topo-
graphic and morphologic change such as a sea cliff or
a  line  of  sand  dunes.  The  berms are  ﬂat  backshore
areas on beaches formed by deposition of sediment
as waves rush up and expend the last of their energy.
Berms are where you will ﬁnd people sunbathing. The
beach face is the sloping portion of the beach below
the berm, and the part of the beach face that is ex-
posed by the uprush and backwash of waves is called
the  swash zone. The  surf zone is  that  portion  of  the
seashore environment where turbulent translational
waves  move  toward  the  shore  after  the  incoming
waves break; the breaker zone is the area where the in-
coming waves become unstable, peak, and break. The
longshore  trough and  longshore  bar are  an  elongated
depression  and  adjacent  ridge  of  sand  produced  by
wave action. A particular beach, especially if it is wide
and  gently  sloping,  may  have  a  series  of  longshore
bars, longshore troughs, and breaker zones.5

Transport of Sand
The sand on beaches is not static; wave action keeps
the  sand  moving  along  the  beach  in  the  surf  and
swash zones. A longshore current is produced by in-
coming waves striking the coast at an angle (Figure
11.7). Because the waves strike the coast at an angle,
a  component  of  wave  energy  is  directed  along  the
shore. If waves arrive at a beach perfectly parallel to
the  beach,  then  no  longshore  current  is  generated.

The longshore current is a stream of water ﬂowing
parallel  to  the  shore  in  the  surf  zone.  This  current
can be surprisingly strong. If you are swimming on a
beach and wading in and out of the surf zone, you
may notice that the longer you go in and out through
the surf zone, the further away you are from where
you started and left your beach towel and umbrella.
As you move in and out through the surf and swash
zone, the current will move you along the coast, and
the sand is doing exactly the same thing.

The process that transports sand along the beach,
called longshore sediment transport, has two com-
ponents: (1) Sand is transported along the coast with
the longshore current in the surf zone; and (2) the
up-and-back movement of beach sand in the swash
zone causes the sand to move along the beach in a
zigzag path (Figure 11.7). Most of the sand is trans-
ported in the surf zone by the longshore current.

The direction of transport of sand along beaches
in the United States is generally from the north to
the  south  for  beaches  on  both  the  East  and  West
Coasts of the country. Although most of the trans-
port is to the south, it can be variable and depends
upon  the  wave  action  and  in  which  direction  the
waves strike the shore. The amount of sand trans-
ported along a beach, whether we are talking about
Long Island, New York, or Los Angeles, California, is
surprisingly  large,  at  several  hundred  thousand
cubic  meters  of  sediment  per  year.  However,  the
amount  of  sand  transported  on  a  given  day  or  pe-
riod of days is extremely variable. On many days lit-
tle sand is transported, and on others the amount is
much  larger.  Most  of  the  sediment  is  transported
during storms by larger waves.

Rip Currents
When a series of large waves arrives at a coastline
and breaks on the beach, the water tends to pile up
on the shore. The water does not return as it came
in, along the entire shoreline, but is concentrated
in  narrow  zones  known  as  rip  currents (Figure
11.8). Beachgoers and lifeguards call them riptides

or undertow. They certainly are not tides, and they
do  not  pull  people  under  the  water,  but  they  can
pull  people  offshore.  In  the  United  States,  up  to
200 people are killed and 20,000 people are rescued
from  rip  currents  each  year.  In  late  August  2010,
more  than  100  people  were  rescued  from  the  surf
from  North  Carolina  to  New  Jersey  over  a  2-day

372

CHAPTER 11

Coastal Processes

period  when  waves  from  offshore  Hurricane
Danielle sent high waves and rough surf to the coast
(see opening photograph). Therefore, it is clear that
rip  currents  constitute  a  serious  coastal  hazard  to
swimmers, killing more people in the United States
on  an  annual  basis  than  do  hurricanes  or  earth-
quakes; the number of deaths caused by rip currents
is equivalent to the number caused by river ﬂooding.
People  drown  in  rip  currents  because  they  do  not
know how to swim or because they panic and ﬁght
the current by trying to swim directly back to shore.
Winning a ﬁght with a rip current is nearly impossi-
ble because the current can exceed 6 km per hour
(4 mi per hour), a speed that even strong swimmers
cannot maintain for long. A swimmer trying to ﬁght
a rip current soon becomes exhausted and may not
have the energy to keep swimming. Fortunately, rip
currents are usually relatively narrow, a few meters
to  a  few  tens  of  meters  wide,  and  they  dissipate
outside the surf zone, within tens to hundreds of
meters  offshore.  To  safely  escape  a  rip  current,  a
swimmer must ﬁrst recognize the current and then
swim parallel to the shore until he or she is outside
the current. Only then should the swimmer attempt
to swim back to shore. The key to survival is not to
panic.  When  you  swim  in  the  ocean,  watch  the
waves for a few minutes before entering the water
and note the “surf beat,” the regularly arriving sets
of  small  and  larger  waves.  Rip  currents  can  form
quickly after the arrival of a set of large waves. They
can  be  recognized  as  a  relatively  quiet  area  in  the
surf  zone  where  fewer  incoming  waves  break.  You
may see the current as a mass of water moving out
through the surf zone. The water in the current may
also  be  darker,  carrying  suspended  sediment.  Re-
member,  if  you  get  caught  in  a  rip  current,  don’t
panic; swim parallel to the shore until you are out-
side the current and then head back to the beach. If
there are lifeguards in the area, yell for assistance!

continues,  coastal  erosion  will  certainly  become  a
more serious problem.

Beach Budget
An easy way to visualize beach erosion at a particu-
lar  beach  is  to  take  a  beach-budget approach.5 An
analogy to the budget is your bank account. You de-
posit  money  at  regular  or  not-so-regular  times.
Some money is in storage, and that’s your account
balance;  you  periodically  withdraw  funds,  which  is
output. Similarly, we can analyze a beach in terms of
input,  storage,  and  output  of  sand  or  larger  sedi-
ment that may be found on the beach. Input of sedi-
ment  to  a  beach  occurs  by  coastal  processes  that
move  the  sediment  along  the  shore  line  (Figure
11.7) or produce sand from erosion of a sea cliff or
sand dunes on the upper part of a beach. The sedi-
ment that is in storage on a beach is what you see
when you visit the site. Output of sediment is the
material  that  moves  away  from  the  site  by  coastal
processes  similar  to  those  that  brought  the  sedi-
ment  to  the  beach.  If  input  exceeds  output,  the
beach will grow as more sediment is stored and the
beach  widens.  If  input  and  output  are  relatively
equal  to  one  another,  the  beach  will  remain  in  a
rough equilibrium at about the same width. If out-
put of sediment exceeds input, the beach will erode,
and  there  will  be  fewer  grains  of  sediment  on  the
beach.  Thus,  we  see  that  the  budget  represents  a
balance of sand on the beach over a period of years.
Short-term changes in sediment supply due to the
attack of storm waves will cause seasonal or storm-
related  changes  to  the  supply  of  sediment  on  a
beach.  Long-term  changes  in  the  beach  budget
caused  by  climate  change  or  human  impact  cause
long-term  growth  or  erosion  of  a  beach.  A  simple
beach budget is presented in A Closer Look: Beach
Budget.

11.3 Coastal Erosion
As a result of the global rise in sea level and inappro-
priate development in the coastal zone, coastal ero-
sion  is  becoming  recognized  as  a  serious  national
and worldwide problem. Coastal erosion is generally
a  more  continuous,  predictable  process  than  other
natural  hazards,  such  as  earthquakes,  tropical  cy-
clones, or ﬂoods, and large sums of money are spent
in attempts to control it. If extensive development

Erosion Factors
The sand on many beaches is supplied to the coastal
areas  by  rivers  that  transport  it  from  areas  up-
stream, where it has been produced by weathering
of  quartz-  and  feldspar-rich  rocks.  We  have  inter-
fered  with  this  material  ﬂow  of  sand  from  inland
areas  to  the  beach  by  building  dams  that  trap  the
sand.  As  a  result,  some  beaches  have  become  de-
prived of sediment and have eroded.

Coastal Erosion

373

A 

Closer 
Look

Beach Budget

For a given shoreline segment, the
total volume of sand added (gained)
to the beach can be balanced (com-
pared) to losses. This produces the
“beach budget”:5
• If losses are greater than gains,

erosion results.

• If losses are less than gains, the

beach grows by accretion of sand.
• We can evaluate a budget over a
set period of time, such as 1 year
or 10 years.
As an example, imagine a simple
coast with rivers supplying sand, a
sea cliff, a beach, and a submarine
canyon (Figure 11.A). This coast de-
ﬁnes a littoral cell, which is a segment
of coast (i.e., a system) that includes
sources and transport of sand to and
along the beach. (In this simple case,
rivers deliver sand, as does sea cliff
erosion.) Sand is transported along

the coast, and some is transported
from the near-shore environment
down a submarine canyon (i.e., an off-
shore canyon that may head into the
surf zone and remove sand from the
beach transport system). Here, we
determine the budget before and
after a dam was constructed, con-
ﬁrming the erosion observed on
beaches south of the submarine
canyon where homes are threatened.

To estimate the sediment deliv-
ered to the coast from the river, we
can use equations (numerical mod-
els) or regional graphs.5 The basin
before the dam has an area contribut-
ing sediment of 800 km2. From our
analysis of sediment production, we
estimate that the sediment delivered
to the beach from the river is about
300 m3/km2/yr. Following dam con-
struction, the sediment-contributing
area is reduced to 500 km2, with a

yield of 400 m3/km2/yr. The increase
per unit area results because smaller
tributaries below the dam have a
higher sediment yield.

Assume that 30 percent of sedi-

ment delivered from the river will re-
main on the beach and that it is sand
sized and larger:

Before dam:
 Sr ( +) = (300 m3/km2/yr)(800 km2)(0.3)

  = 72,000 m3/yr

After dam:
 Sr ( +) = (400 m3/km2/yr)(500 km2)(0.3)

  = 60,000 m3/yr

Assume that there are several

beach homes near point X. What

would be your response if there were

Damming is not the only reason for erosion. For
example, beach erosion along the East Coast can be
the result of tropical cyclones (hurricanes) and severe
storms, known as Northeasters or Nor’easters;4 or a
rise in sea level; or human interference with natural
shore  processes.6 Sea  level  is  rising  around  the
world at the rate of about 2 to 3 mm (0.08 to 0.12 in.)
per  year,  independent  of  any  tectonic  movement.
Evidence  suggests  that  the  rate  of  rise  has  in-
creased in recent decades. The increase is due to the
melting of the polar ice caps and thermal expansion
of the upper ocean waters, triggered by global warm-
ing that is in part related to increased atmospheric
carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels. Sea
levels could rise by 20 cm to 2 m (8 to 80 in) over the
next century, ensuring that coastal erosion will be-
come an even greater problem than it is today.

Sea Cliff Erosion
When a sea cliff (i.e., a steep bluff or cliff) is pre-
sent along a coastline, additional erosion problems
may occur because the sea cliff is exposed to both

wave  action  and  land  erosion  processes,  such  as
running water and landslides. These processes may
work  together  to  erode  the  cliff  at  a  greater  rate
than  either  process  could  alone.  The  problem  is
further  compounded  when  people  interfere  with
the  sea  cliff  environment  through  inappropriate
development.

Figure  11.9 shows  a  typical  southern  California
sea cliff environment at low tide. The rocks of the
cliff are steeply inclined and folded shale. A thin ve-
neer of sand and coarser material, such as pebbles
and  boulders,  near  the  base  of  the  cliff  covers  the
wave-cut platform, which is a nearly ﬂat bench cut
into the bedrock by wave action. A mantle of sand
approximately  1  m  (3.3  ft)  thick  covers  the  beach
during  the  summer,  when  long,  gentle,  spilling
breakers construct a wide berm while protecting the
sea  cliff  from  wave  erosion.  During  the  winter,
plunging  breakers,  which  have  a  high  potential  to
erode  beaches,  remove  the  mantle  of  sand  and  ex-
pose the base of the sea cliff. Thus, it is not surpris-
ing  that  most  erosion  of  the  sea  cliffs  in  southern
California takes place during the winter.

Landslide deposits

A variety of human activities can induce sea cliff
erosion.  Urbanization,  for  example,  results  in
increased  runoff.  If  the  runoff  is  not  controlled,
carefully collected, and diverted away from the sea
cliff,  serious  erosion  can  result.  Drainpipes  that
dump urban runoff from streets and homes directly
onto the sea cliff increase erosion. Drainpipes that
route runoff to the base of the sea cliff on the face of
the  beach  result  in  less  erosion  (Figure  11.10a).

Watering lawns and gardens on top of a sea cliff may
add  a  good  deal  of  water  to  the  slope.  This  water
tends to migrate downward through the sea cliff to-
ward the base. When water emerges as small seeps
or springs from a sea cliff, it effectively reduces the
stability of the sea cliff, facilitating erosion, includ-
ing landslides (Figure 11.10b).7

Structures,  such  as  walls,  buildings,  swimming
pools, and patios, near the edge of a sea cliff may

larly safe because it is overhanging the cliff by at least 1 m (3.3 ft). Notice the ex-
posed cement pillars in the sea cliff, which were intended to help support the
houses. These decks and apartment buildings are in imminent danger of collaps-
ing into the sea. (Edward A. Keller)

are  moderate  compared  with  those  in
other parts of the world. Along the Nor-
folk coast of England, for example, ero-
sion rates in some areas are about 2 m
(6.6 ft) per year. The rate of erosion is
dependent  on  the  resistance  of  the
rocks  and  the  height  of  the  sea  cliff.6
The rate of coastal erosion can be deter-
mined  by  a  new  remote  sensing  tech-
nique called LiDAR (see A Closer Look:
Measuring Coastal Change).

Sea  cliff  erosion  is  a  natural  process
that  cannot  be  completely  controlled
unless 
large  amounts  of  time  and
money  are  invested,  and,  even  then,
there  is  no  guarantee  that  erosion  will
cease. Therefore, it seems we must learn
to live with some erosion. It can be min-
imized by applying sound conservation
practices, such as controlling the water
on  and  in  the  cliff  and  not  placing
homes, walls, large trees, or other struc-
tures  that  contribute  to  driving  forces
close to the top edge of a cliff.

11.4 Coastal Hazards
and Engineering
Structures

Efforts to stabilize a beach can be gener-
alized into three approaches:
• Hard stabilization: Engineering struc-
tures to protect a shoreline from waves
• Soft stabilization: Adding sand to a

beach (beach nourishment)

• Managed retreat: Living with beach
erosion  with,  perhaps,  a  mixture  of
hard and soft stabilization

also  decrease  stability  by  adding  weight  to  the
slope,  increasing  both  small  and  large  landslides
(Figure 11.11). Strict regulation of development in
many  areas  of  the  coastal  zone  now  forbids  most
risky  construction,  but  we  continue  to  live  with
some of our past mistakes.

The rate of sea cliff erosion is variable, and few
measurements  are  available.  Near  Santa  Barbara,
California, the rate of sea cliff erosion averages 15
to 30 cm (6 to 12 in.) per year. These erosion rates

Hard Stabilization
Engineering structures in the coastal environment,
including sea walls, groins, breakwaters, and jetties,
are  primarily  designed  to  improve  navigation  or  re-
tard erosion. However, because they tend to interfere
with  the  littoral  transport  of  sediment  along  the
beach, these structures all too often cause undesir-
able deposition and erosion in their vicinity.

Measuring Coastal Change

Technology has recently provided a
remote sensing method of measur-
ing and monitoring changes in the
coastal environment. Light Detec-
tion and Ranging (LiDAR) is an air-
craft-mounted laser system that can
record several tens of thousand ele-
vation measurements per second,
with vertical resolution of better
than 15 cm (6 in.). Once a baseline
set of elevations is recorded, subse-
quent ﬂights can detect changes in
the coastal zone, such as change in

shape of the beach coastal dunes or
sea cliff. Figure 11.B shows a digital
elevation model determined by
LiDAR for the Hilton Head, South
Carolina, coastal area in the vicinity
of a hotel that is very close to the ac-
tive beach. Figure 11.C shows the
sea cliff environment near Paciﬁca,
California, where 12 homes were
condemned as unsafe following win-
ter storms in early 1998. The amount
of sea cliff erosion from LiDAR from
October 1997 to April 1998 is shown

in Figure 11.D. Total erosion
was about 10 m (30 ft) land-
ward and 1 to 2 m on the
beach. A method to determine
a longer-term rate (say a
decade or more) of sea cliff re-
treat (erosion of the top land-
ward) is now possible. Aerial
photographs (from different
times) do not generally work
well for measurement of the
amount of coastal erosion. This

results because even on large scale
photographs it is difﬁcult (if not im-
possible) to measure a few meters of
erosion over a decade or so. What
does work, assuming the rate is at
close to 0.33 m (1 ft) per year or
more, is to use two sets of LiDAR
data taken a decade or more apart
or using available LiDAR (say 10
years old) with a very accurate land
survey (⫹/⫺ 0.5 m) of the position
of the top of the sea cliff today (such
surveys are very possible using mod-
ern survey techniques). Superposing
the two data sets (2 LiDAR or LiDAR
and survey) can result in being able
to conﬁdently measure the amount
and rate of sea cliff retreat ⫹/⫺ 0.5
m. It is possible because over a
decade the amount of retreat is
about 3 m, which is about 6 times
the resolution. At this level, individ-
ual small landslides and other
changes in the position of the top of
the sea cliff become apparent.

Sea  walls. Sea  walls are  structures  constructed
parallel to the coastline to help retard erosion. They
may be constructed of concrete, large stones, wood,
or other materials. Sea walls constructed at the base
of a sea cliff may not be particularly effective; con-
siderable erosion of the sea cliff results from mass-
wasting  processes  on  the  cliff  itself  (see  Figure
11.10b), as well as wave erosion at the base. Sea wall
use  has  been  criticized  because  sea  walls  are  often
vertical  structures  that  reﬂect  incoming  waves,  or
bounce them back from the shore. The reﬂection of
waves  enhances  beach  erosion  and,  over  several
decades, produces a narrower beach with less sand.
Unless  carefully  designed  to  complement  existing
land  uses,  sea  walls  generally  cause  environmental
and aesthetic degradation. In addition to causing a
narrowing of a beach, sea walls may reduce biodiver-
sity of the beach ecosystem (see Chapter 4). The de-
sign and construction of sea walls must be carefully
tailored  to  speciﬁc  sites.  Some  geologists  believe
that sea walls cause more problems than they solve
and should be used rarely, if ever.8

Groins. Groins are  linear  structures  placed  per-
pendicular  to  the  shore,  usually  in  groups  called

groin ﬁelds (Figure 11.12). Each groin is designed to
trap a portion of the sand that moves in the littoral
transport system. A small accumulation of sand will
develop updrift of each groin, thus building an irreg-
ular but wider beach. The wider beach protects the
shoreline from erosion.

However,  there  is  an  inherent  problem  with
groins:  Although  deposition  occurs  updrift  of  a
groin, erosion tends to occur in the downdrift direc-
tion. Thus, a groin or a groin ﬁeld results in a wider,
more  protected  beach  in  a  desired  area  but  may
cause  a  zone  of  erosion  to  develop  in  the  adjacent
downcoast  shoreline.  The  erosion  results  because,
as  a  groin  traps  sediment  on  its  updrift  side,  the
downdrift  area  is  deprived  of  sediment.  Once  a
groin has trapped all the sediment it can hold, sand
in the groin is transported around its offshore end
to continue its journey along the beach. Therefore,
erosion may be minimized by artiﬁcially ﬁlling each
groin. This process, known as beach nourishment,
requires  extracting  sand  from  the  ocean  or  other
sources  and  placing  it  onto  the  beach.  When  nour-
ished, the groins will draw less sand from the natural
littoral  transport  system,  and  the  downdrift  ero-
sion  will  be  reduced.5 Despite  beach  nourishment

amount of sediment for transport can cause erosion. (Edward A. Keller)

and other precautions, groins may still cause unde-
sirable erosion; therefore, their use should be care-
fully evaluated.

Breakwaters. Breakwaters and jetties protect lim-
ited  stretches  of  the  shoreline  from  waves.  Break-
waters are designed to intercept waves and provide a
protected  area,  or  harbor,  for  boat  moorings;  they
may  be  attached  to,  or  separated  from,  the  beach
(Figure 11.13a, b). In either case, a breakwater blocks
the natural littoral transport of beach sediment, caus-
ing the conﬁguration of the coast to change locally as
new areas of deposition and erosion develop. In addi-
tion to possibly causing serious erosion problems in

the  downdrift  direction,  breakwaters  act  as  sand
traps that accumulate sand in the updrift direction.
Eventually the trapped sand may ﬁll or block the en-
trance to the harbor as a deposit called a sand spit or
bar develops. As a result, a dredging program, with an
artiﬁcial bypass, is often necessary to keep the harbor
open and clear of sediment. The sand that is removed
by dredging, unless it is polluted, is transported in a
pipe with water and released on the beach downdrift
of the breakwater to rejoin the natural littoral trans-
port system, thus reducing the erosion problem. It is
the  transport  of  the  sand  from  the  site  where  it  is
dredged to the downdrift location that is referred to
as an artiﬁcial bypass.

Diagrams illustrating the effects of breakwaters and jetties on local patterns of deposition and erosion.

Jetties. Jetties are often constructed in pairs at
the mouth of a river or inlet to a lagoon, estuary,
or bay (Figure 11.13c). They are designed to stabilize
the  channel,  prevent  or  minimize  deposition  of
sediment in the channel, and generally protect it
from  large  waves.5 Jetties  tend  to  block  the  lit-
toral  transport  of  beach  sediment,  thus  causing
the  updrift  beach  adjacent  to  the  jetty  to  widen
while downdrift beaches erode. The deposition at
jetties may eventually fill the channel, making it
useless, while downcoast erosion damages coastal
development.  Dredging  the  sediment  minimizes
but does not eliminate all undesirable deposition
and erosion.

Unfortunately,  it  is  impossible  to  build  a  break-
water or jetty that will not interfere with longshore

movement  of  beach  sediment.  These  structures
must,  therefore,  be  carefully  planned  and  must
incorporate protective measures that eliminate or at
least  minimize  adverse  effects.  These  protective
measures may include installation of a dredging and
artiﬁcial sediment-bypass system, a beach nourish-
ment program, sea walls, riprap (i.e., large rocks), or
some combination of these.5

Sometimes  a  hard  solution  is  decided  upon  to
stabilize  a  stretch  of  coast  of  particular  value  to
people. Cities and other areas of land on a coast are
an  example  where  sea  walls  and  other  structures
protect development and agriculture land. The clas-
sic  example  is  the  sea  dikes  that  hold  back  the
North  Sea  from  the  Netherlands.  Dike  building
began  in  the  Netherlands  over  2,000  years  ago.

Nearly  30  percent  of  the  land  area  of  the  Nether-
lands (where about 16 million people live) is below
sea  level.  Along  the  Normandy  Coast  of  France,
there is a coastal erosion project to protect Pointe du
Hoc,  which  has  particular  historical  signiﬁcance.
The work to minimize coastal erosion at the Pointe
du Hoc is of interest because it involves careful eval-
uation of the local geology, linked to a hard solution.
(See  A  Closer  Look:  Coastal  Erosion  at  Pointe  du
Hoc, France.)

Soft Stabilization
Beach  Nourishment:  An  Alternative  to  Engi-
neering Structures. In the discussion above, we
introduced the topic of beach nourishment as an ad-
junct to engineering structures in the coastal zone.
Beach nourishment can also be an alternative to en-
gineering structures. In its purest form, beach nour-
ishment  consists  of  artiﬁcially  placing  sand  on
beaches in the hope of constructing a positive beach
budget. When you budget your money, you hope for
a  positive  budget,  allowing  you  some  extra  cash.
Similarly, a positive beach budget means that when
all the sand that enters and leaves the beach is ac-
counted  for,  there  is  enough  sand  left  to  maintain
the  beach  itself.  Beach  nourishment  is  sometimes
referred  to  as  “soft”  stabilization  to  control  beach
erosion,  as  contrasted  with  “hard”  stabilization,
such as constructing groins or seawalls. Ideally, the
presence  of  the  nourished  beach  protects  coastal
property from the attack of waves.5 The procedure
has distinct advantages: It is aesthetically preferable
to  many  engineering  structures,  and  it  provides  a
recreation  beach,  as  well  as  some  protection  from
shoreline erosion.

In  the  mid-1970s,  the  city  of  Miami  Beach,
Florida,  and  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers
began  an  ambitious  beach  nourishment  program
to  reverse  a  serious  beach  erosion  problem  that
had plagued the area since the 1950s. The program
was  also  intended  to  provide  protection  from
storms. The natural beach had nearly disappeared
by the 1950s, and only small pockets of sand could
be found associated with various shoreline protec-
tion structures, including sea walls and groins. As
the beach disappeared, coastal resort areas, includ-
ing  high-rise  hotels,  became  vulnerable  to  storm
erosion.8 The nourishment program was designed

Coastal Hazards and Engineering Structures

381

to  produce  a  positive  beach  budget  that  would
widen the beach and provide additional protection
from  storm  damage.  The  project  cost  approxi-
mately  $62  million  over  10  years  and  involved
nourishment  of  about  160,000  m3 (209,300  yd3)
of  sand  per  year  to  replenish  erosion  losses.  By
1980,  about  18  million  m3 (23.5  million  yd3)  of
sand  had  been  dredged  and  pumped  from  an  off-
shore site onto the beach, producing a 200 m (656
ft)-wide beach.10 Figure 11.14 shows Miami Beach
before  and  after  the  nourishment.  The  change  is
dramatic.

A cross-sectional design of the project shows the
wide berm and frontal dune system, which is a line
of  sand  dunes  just  above  the  high-tide  line  that
functions  as  a  buffer  to  wave  erosion  and  storm
surge  (Figure  11.15).  The  Miami  project  was  ex-
panded  in  the  mid-  to  late  1980s  to  include  dune
restoration, which involved establishing native veg-
etation  on  the  dune.  Special  wooden  walkways
allow public access through the dunes, while other
areas  of  the  dunes  are  protected.  The  successful
Miami  Beach  nourishment  project  has  functioned
for more than 20 years, surviving major hurricanes
in 1979 and 1992,5,8 and is certainly preferable to
the fragmented erosion-control methods that pre-
ceded it.

More  than  600  km  (373  mi)  of  coastline  in  the
United  States  have  received  some  sort  of  beach
nourishment.  Not  all  of  this  nourishment  has  had
the  positive  effects  reported  for  Miami  Beach.  For
example, in 1982, Ocean City, New Jersey, nourished
a stretch of beach at a cost of just over $5 million.
After  a  series  of  storms  that  struck  the  beach,  the
sand  was  eroded  in  just  2.5  months.  The  beach
sands  at  Miami  may  be  eroded  at  a  much  greater
cost. Beach nourishment remains controversial, and
some  consider  beach  nourishment  nothing  more
than “sacriﬁcial sand” that will eventually be washed
away by coastal erosion.8 Miami Beach is an excep-
tion  with  respect  to  its  apparent  success,  and  our
discussion  oversimpliﬁes  positive  aspects  of  nour-
ishment. The annual cost to nourish Miami Beach is
about $3 million. More than 20 million tourists visit
the beach each year. Foreign tourism alone brings in
about $2 billion per year, over 650 times the cost of
the nourishment.

the site, how the nourishment will be paid for, and

recreational  beaches  and  protecting  the  shoreline
from  coastal  erosion  around  the  world.  Additional
case histories are needed to document the success or
failure  of  the  projects.  Also  needed  is  more  public
education to inform people of what can be expected
from beach nourishment.5

11.5 Human Activity and Coastal

Erosion: Some Examples

Human interference with natural shore processes has
caused  considerable  coastal  erosion.  Most  problems
arise  in  areas  that  are  highly  populated  and  devel-
oped. As we have discussed, artiﬁcially constructed
barriers often retard the movement of sand, causing
beaches to grow in some areas and erode in others, re-
sulting in damage to valuable beachfront property.

Coastal Erosion at Pointe du Hoc, France

Pointe du Hoc is located on the Nor-
mandy coast of France. It is located
on a promontory point several hun-
dred kilometers northwest of Paris,
on the shore of the English Channel
(Figure 11.Ea). The point is a histori-

cal site located on a coastal plain of
low relief. The ocean side is a sea cliff,
approximately 30 m high (Figure
11.Eb). Thousands of people visit the
site annually to view the location
where the invasion to free Europe in

near the base of the sea cliff. (Moirenc Camille/age fotostock)

World War II began on June 6, 1944.
Many consider the site to be so im-
portant that expending a large
amount of money to preserve the
most vulnerable parts of the point
is worthwhile. Of course, this is a
value judgment. The main problem
is that the point has experienced as
much as 10 m of erosion in the past
60 years. As a result, it was feared
that the observation post might
actually fall into the sea. Predictions
were that it probably could not last
more than a few decades, at most.
Those who want to preserve the

last bit of rock on the point rather
than, say, move some of the struc-
tures, obtained funding to evaluate
whether the point might be pre-
served for another few decades if it
were reinforced. This is an interesting
approach to coastal erosion because
it is a site-speciﬁc solution to a partic-
ular problem that involves coastal
stabilization rather than, say, adjust-
ment such as managed retreat. The
case is also very interesting because
it involves detailed geologic evalua-
tion and study of processes of sea
cliff retreat, linked to a speciﬁc strat-
egy to reduce the rate of coastal ero-
sion which has been estimated at 0.1
to 0.2 m per year.9 Scientists and en-
gineers studying the sea cliff realize
that any attempt to absolutely stop
sea cliff erosion is futile. Rather, their
objective is a temporary solution to
buy as much as 50 years. Total ero-
sion in the past 60 years has been
approximately 10 m (33 ft), and, in
future decades, that rate might be
signiﬁcantly reduced.

The sea cliff was carefully evalu-

ated and the geology studied in

sea cliff and the geology is shown in
Figure 11.F. Three geologic layers are
present:9
• The top layer, which is up to

about 9 m thick, is a silty, grav-
elly, sandy, clay soil. This layer has
relatively low strength and is
prone to small landslides and
grain-by-grain erosion resulting
from precipitation.

• The middle layer is a fractured
limestone that, with depth, be-
comes sandy and enriched with
calcium carbonate muds. The
layer is about 15 m thick. The
limestone beds are nearly flat
lying but have numerous nearly
vertical fractures that are filled,
to a lesser or greater extent, 
with weathered products of 
the limestone that are clay rich.
Precipitation from the surface
can remove some of the clay, 
resulting in the fractures being
more open. The fractured lime-
stone is vulnerable to larger
slope failures, particularly if the
rock is underlain by areas of
coastal erosion that have pro-
duced wave-cut notches and 

sea caves. In fact, investigators
studying the site have observed
that this is the dominant failure
mechanism that results in the
most rock being lost from the
sea cliff. When wave erosion 
undermines the rocks at the
base, the rocks may fail along
the fractures, falling onto the
beach or into the sea.

• The lowest layer present is a 
black marl, which is a calcium 
carbonate–rich mudstone. Both
the fractured limestone and the
black marl have relatively high
rock strength compared to the
overlying soil.

A study of the sea cliff suggests
that the attack of waves at the rock
face near the beach dislodges blocks
of rock and creates caverns, or sea
caves. These are clearly visible along
the base of the sea cliff and can be
quite large, as illustrated in Figures
11.Ea, and 11.F. The caves grow larger
and deeper with time and, eventu-
ally, leave the overlying rock unsup-
ported; a failure may occur along
fractures. It was concluded that the
primary reason for collapse of the sea

cliff is the presence of the caverns at
the base of the cliff. As a result, the
primary recommendation for reduc-
ing the rate of erosion is to ﬁll the
caverns and stabilize the base of the
sea cliff. Work on this project began
in 2010, and the objective is to ﬁll the
caverns with several hundred cubic
meters of concrete. Rock bolts are
also used to secure the concrete and
stabilize the rocks. Following ﬁlling of
the caverns, the outermost layer of
cement is made to look like native
rock. This is obviously a temporary
solution because new sea caves can
form, and the cement itself may be
undermined and eroded. As a result,
the study recommended a mainte-
nance program based upon inspec-
tions and recognized that future
work will undoubtedly be necessary.
It is also important to recognize
that the development of sea caves
and large landslides is not the only
process affecting the sea cliff. The
top unit of the sea cliff is the weak
soil, and numerous, small landslides
are occurring on a regular basis. In
fact, the top of the sea cliff has a
wavy form, due to the many small
landslides. Therefore, stabilizing the
base of the sea cliff will not elimi-
nate sea cliff retreat. It will probably
reduce it by about one-half. There-
fore, the work on the lower part of
the sea cliff, which was completed
in September 2010, will be a tempo-
rary solution at best. In the long run,
the environmentally preferable solu-
tion will, by necessity, mean moving
structures of historical importance
back from the edge of the cliff. This
is essentially the same solution
reached in the case history at the
beginning of the chapter, about the
Cape Hatteras Lighthouse being
moved inland.

In summary, the decision to use a

“hard solution” to the sea cliff at
Pointe du Hoc is an interesting one
and is based on the value judgment

Human Activity and Coastal Erosion: Some Examples

385

that the historical signiﬁcance of the
site is so great that measures need to
be taken to preserve it. The cost of
the work is modest to date, at about
$6 million; however, future mainte-
nance costs will be incurred, and,
often, structures that are built in the
sea cliff environment are fortiﬁed

even more in subsequent years, so
the total cost in the future is un-
known. The solution to coastal ero-
sion and the decision to minimize it
at Pointe du Hoc is obviously a spe-
cial circumstance, where a small
length of sea cliff is stabilized. Should
such an approach be applied to a

long section of sea cliff, the cost
would be far too great to maintain.
For now, the point is better pro-
tected, and the erosion rate will
probably decrease, but, in the future,
if the site is to be maintained, impor-
tant structures will need to be moved
inland.

The Atlantic Coast
The  Atlantic  Coast  from  northern
Florida to New York is characterized
by  barrier  islands—long,  narrow  is-
lands  separated  from  the  mainland
by  a  body  of  water  (Figure  11.16).
Many  barrier  islands  have  been  al-
tered  to  some  extent  by  human  use
and interest.

The  barrier  island  coast  of  Mary-
land 
illustrates  some  effects  of
human activity on coastal processes.
Demand for the 50 km (30 mi) of At-
lantic oceanfront beach in Maryland
is very high, and the limited resource
is  used  seasonally  by  residents  of
Washington,  DC,  and  Baltimore,
Maryland  (Figure  11.17).  Since  the
early  1970s,  Ocean  City  on  Fenwick
Island has promoted high-rise condo-
minium and hotel development on its
waterfront. The natural frontal dune
system of this narrow island has been
removed in many locations, resulting
in  a  serious  beach  erosion  problem.
Even more ominous is the almost cer-
tain  possibility  that  a  future  hurri-
cane  will  cause  serious  damage  to
Fenwick Island. The Ocean City inlet
to  the  south  of  Ocean  City  formed
during a hurricane in 1933. There is no guarantee, de-
spite  attempts  to  stabilize  the  inlet  through  coastal
engineering, that a new inlet will not form, destroy-
ing, by erosion, part of Ocean City in the future.11

Assateague Island is located to the south, across
the Ocean City inlet. It encompasses two-thirds of
the  Maryland  coastline.  In  contrast  to  the  highly

share  the  same  sand  supply.  At  least,  that  was  the
case  until  1935,  when  the  jetties  were  constructed

to  stabilize  the  Ocean  City  inlet.  Since  construc-
tion of the jetties, coastal erosion in the northern
few kilometers of Assateague Island has averaged
about  11  m  (36  ft)  per  year,  which  is  nearly 
20  times  the  long-term  rate  of  shoreline  retreat
for the Maryland coastline. During the same time,
beaches  immediately  north  of  the  inlet  became
considerably wider, requiring the lengthening of a
recreational pier.12

Observed  changes  on  Maryland’s  Atlantic  coast
are clearly related to the pattern of longshore drift
of sand and human interference. Longshore drift is
to the south at an average annual volume of about
150,000  m3 (196,500  yd3).  Construction  of  the
Ocean City inlet jetties interfered with the natural
southward  ﬂow  of  sand  and  diverted  it  offshore
rather  than  allowing  it  to  continue  southward  to
nourish the beaches on Assateague Island. Starved
of  sand,  the  northern  portions  of  the  island  have

experienced  serious  shoreline  erosion  during  the
past 50 years. This example of beach erosion associ-
ated  with  engineering  structures  that  block  long-
shore  transport  of  sediment  has  been  cited  as  the
most severe that can be found in the United States.12
Thus, the fundamental principle involving environ-
mental unity holds: Earth is a system, a set of com-
ponents that function together as a whole; a change
in one part of the system affects all other parts.

The Gulf Coast
Coastal erosion is a serious problem along the Gulf
of  Mexico.  One  study  in  the  Texas  coastal  zone
suggests that, in the past 100 years, human modi-
fication of the coastal zone has accelerated coastal
erosion  by  30  to  40  percent  over  prehistoric
rates.13 The  human  modifications  that  appear  to
be most responsible for the accelerated erosion are

coastal engineering structures, subsidence as a re-
sult  of  groundwater  and  petroleum  withdrawal,
and  damming  of  rivers  that  supply  sand  to  the
beaches.

The Great Lakes
Erosion  is  a  periodic  problem  along  the  coasts  of
the Great Lakes and has been particularly trouble-
some along the Lake Michigan shoreline. Damage
is  most  severe  during  prolonged  periods  of  high
lake levels that follow extended periods of above-
normal  precipitation.  The  relationship  between
precipitation  and  lake  level  has  been  documented
since  1860  by  the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers.
The  data  show  that  the  lake  level  has  ﬂuctuated
about 2 m (6.6 ft) during this time. During a high-
water  stage,  there  is  considerable  coastal  erosion,
and  many  buildings,  roads,  retaining  walls,  and
other  structures  are  destroyed  by  wave  erosion
(Figure 11.18).14 For example, in 1985, high lake
levels due to fall storms caused an estimated $15
million to $20 million in damage.

During periods of below-average lake level, wide
beaches  develop  that  dissipate  energy  from  storm
waves  and  protect  the  shore.  However,  with  rising
lake-level  conditions,  the  beaches  become  narrow,
and storm waves exert considerable energy against
coastal areas. Even a small lake-level rise on a gently

sloping shore will inundate a surprisingly wide sec-
tion of beach.14

Cliffs along the shores of lakes are referred to as
coastal  bluffs and  are  analogous  to  the  sea  cliffs  of
the ocean shoreline. Long-term rates of coastal bluff
erosion at many Lake Michigan sites average about
0.4 m (1.3 ft) per year.15 The severity of erosion at a
particular  site  depends  on  many  factors,  including
the following:

• Presence or absence of a frontal dune system.
Dune-protected  bluffs  erode  at  a  slower  rate
than unprotected bluffs.

• Orientation of the coastline. Sites exposed to
high-energy  storm  winds  and  waves  erode  at
an increased rate.

• Groundwater seepage. Seepage along the base
of  a  coastal  bluff  causes  slope  instability,  in-
creasing the erosion rate.

• Existence  of  protective  structures.  Structures
may  be  locally  beneﬁcial  but  often  accelerate
coastal erosion in adjacent areas.14,15

In recent years, beach nourishment has been at-
tempted  for  some  Great  Lakes  beaches.  In  some
cases,  sands  that  are  coarser  than  the  natural
sands that had eroded have been added in the hope
that the coarser, heavier sand will reduce the ero-
sion potential.

CHAPTER 11

Coastal Processes

11.6 Tropical Cyclones
Tropical cyclones are known as typhoons in most
of the Paciﬁc Ocean and hurricanes in the Atlantic.
Tropical  cyclones  have  taken  hundreds  of  thou-
sands of lives in a single storm. In November 1970,
a tropical cyclone struck the northern Bay of Bengal
in Bangladesh, producing a 6 m (20 ft) rise in the
sea. Flooding caused by this sea-level rise killed ap-
proximately 300,000 people, caused $63 million in
crop  losses,  and  destroyed  65  percent  of  the  total
ﬁshing  capacity  of  the  coastal  region.16 Another
devastating cyclone hit Bangladesh in the spring of
1991,  killing  more  than  100,000  people  and  caus-
ing  more  than  $1  billion  in  damage.  Hurricane
Mitch,  known  as  the  deadliest  Atlantic  hurricane
since 1780, was responsible for more than 11,000
deaths  in  Honduras  and  Nicaragua  in  1998,  and
Hurricane  Katrina  in  2005  caused  nearly  2,000
deaths, with damages of about $100 billion to New
Orleans  and  other  parts  of  the  Gulf  Coast  (see
Chapter 5).

Hurricane Form and Process
The  origin  for  the  word  hurricane possibly  comes
from a Caribbean Indian word for “big wind” or “evil
spirit.” This certainly ﬁts the bill! To be called a hur-
ricane,  a  storm  must  have  sustained  winds  of  at
least  119  km/hr  (74  mph).  Hurricanes  are  a  varia-
tion  of  the  tropical  cyclone,  which  is  the  general
term  for  a  huge,  complex  series  of  thunderstorms
that rotate around an area of low pressure, forming
over warm, tropical ocean water.

Hurricanes begin as tropical disturbances, which
are large areas of unsettled weather with a diameter
as large as 600 km (370 mi). Within this area, there
exists  an  organized  mass  of  thunderstorms  with  a
general  low  pressure  in  which  there  is  initial  rota-
tion caused by the movement of the storm and rota-
tion of Earth. A tropical depression may grow in size
and  strength  as  warm,  moist  air  is  drawn  into  the
depression and begins to rotate counterclockwise in
the  Northern  Hemisphere  and  clockwise  in  the
Southern  Hemisphere.  The  process  that  increases
the intensity of the storm is caused by warm water
that evaporates from the sea and is drawn into the
storm.  As  this  process  occurs,  the  energy  of  the
storm increases. As warm seawater evaporates, it is

transformed  from  liquid  water  in  the  sea  to  water
vapor (gas) in the air mass of the storm. When this
happens, potential energy in the form of latent heat
enters the storm. Latent heat of water is the amount
of  heat  required  to  change  liquid  water  to  water
vapor.  Latent  heat  is  one  of  the  major  sources  of
the  power  (time  rate  of  energy  expenditure)  of  a
hurricane.  As  the  moist  air  rises,  condensation
(rain) occurs as the latent heat is released, warming
the air and making it lighter. As the lighter air rises,
more energy from warm water is drawn in, and the
storm may increase in size, strength, and intensity.
If  wind  speeds  in  the  storm  reach  63  km  (39  mi),
the depression is called a tropical storm and receives
a name.

Hurricanes  are  classiﬁed  based  upon  their  size
and  intensity.  Table  11.1 (page  390)  is  the  Safﬁr-
Simpson Hurricane Scale. It is used to estimate po-
tential  wind  damage  and  ﬂooding.  There  are  ﬁve
categories,  with  Category  One  being  the  smallest
and Category Five the largest. Category Five hurri-
canes  are  capable  of  producing  catastrophic  dam-
age, but even a Category One storm is a very seri-
ous and dangerous event.

We  know  when  a  hurricane  is  coming.  Images
from satellites and high-altitude aerial photographs
show the locations of tropical depressions and trop-
ical storms that we may monitor to see if they will

Hurricanes  are  very  high-energy  storms.  Their
size can be huge by human standards. It is not un-
usual  to  observe  on  satellite  images  a  hurricane
moving  toward  the  United  States  that  has  an  area
nearly  the  size  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  stretching
from Florida to Texas and beyond.

A  generalized  diagram  of  a  hurricane  and  the
processes that occur within it are shown in Figure
11.19. The hurricane has bands of spinning storms
and thunder cells with an eye where air is subsiding
in the center around what is called the eye wall. As
the moist air rotates within the storm, intense rain
bands  are  produced.  When  a  hurricane  moves
across the land (mainland or island), it is deprived
of  some  of  its  energy  and  often  weakens.  When  a
hurricane makes landfall on a continent and moves
inland,  it  weakens  and  eventually  dies,  but  the
storm and rainfall can cause serious river ﬂooding
well inland. The intense rainfall on slopes may gen-
erate numerous landslides, producing an additional
hazard.

become hurricanes. In order to verify satellite data,
special  airplanes  are  ﬂown  through  storms  to
record  wind  speed,  air  temperature,  and  air  pres-
sure.  Once  a  hurricane  has  formed,  its  continual
movement (called its path) is monitored. The paths
of  four  hurricanes  in  2005  are  shown  in  Figure
11.20 (page 391).

As  hurricanes  get  close  to  landfall,  moving  over
shallower  water,  they  generally  slow  down.  How-
ever, if they encounter warmer water, they may ac-
tually increase in intensity.

The  most  dangerous  aspect  of  hurricanes  is  not
the wind itself, although violent winds can be lethal.
Often, what causes the most ﬂooding and loss of life
is  the  storm  surge,  which  arrives  with  the  storm
(Figure 11.21, page 391). The storm surge is a local
rise  in  sea  level  that  results  when  hurricane  winds
push water toward the coast. Storm surges may arrive
as a quick rise in sea level or a series of waves that
may increase water depths near the coast by several
meters  to  more  than  10  m  (30  ft).  Storm  surge  is
generally highest on the part of the rotating storm
that pushes landward. For example, along the Gulf

Coast, the storm surge and wind speed are higher to
the east than west (i.e., the right front quadrant of
the  storm)  as  the  hurricane  rotates  in  a  counter-
clockwise direction. During Hurricane Katrina (see
the opening case in Chapter 5), the storm surge east
of New Orleans was signiﬁcantly higher than in the
central and western parts of the storm. If a storm
arrives coincidentally with a high tide, a storm surge
of  even  greater  height  occurs.  Most  of  the  deaths
from hurricanes are caused by storm surges as peo-
ple are drowned or struck by solid objects within the
surge. When the surge moves ashore, it is not a tall
advancing line of water but is more like a continual
increase  in  rise  of  sea  level  as  the  hurricane  ap-
proaches  and  makes  landfall.  Having  said  this,  the
actual storm surge in places may well appear as a se-
ries of wavelike forms that inundate the land.

Most hurricanes and typhoons form in a belt be-
tween 8 degrees north and 15 degrees south of the
equator,  where  warm  surface-water  temperatures
exceed  about  27°C  (80°F).  During  an  average
year,  approximately  five  hurricanes  will  develop
that might threaten the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.

TABLE 11.1 The Safﬁr-Simpson Hurricane Scale

The Safﬁr-Simpson Hurricane Scale assigns a 1 to 5 rating based on the hurricane’s present intensity. This rating gives an estimate of the
potential property damage and ﬂooding expected along the coast from a hurricane landfall. Wind speed is the determining factor in
the scale, as storm surge values are highly dependent on the slope of the continental shelf in the landfall region, where the hurricane is
expected to come on land.

Winds 154 to 177 km/hr (96 to 110 mph). Storm surge generally 1.8 to 2.4 m (6 to 8 ft) above normal. Some rooﬁng
material, door, and window damage of buildings. Considerable damage to shrubbery and trees, with some trees
blown down. Considerable damage to mobile homes, poorly constructed signs, and piers. Coastal and low-lying
escape routes ﬂood 2 to 4 hours before arrival of the hurricane center. Small craft in unprotected anchorages break
moorings. Hurricane Bonnie of 1998 was a Category Two Hurricane when it hit the North Carolina coast; Hurricane
George of 1998 was a Category Two hurricane when it hit the Florida Keys and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

Winds 178 to 209 km/hr (111 to 130 mph). Storm surge generally 2.7 to 3.7 m (9 to 12 ft) above normal. Some
structural damage to small residences and utility buildings, with a minor amount of wall failures. Damage to
shrubbery and trees, with foliage blown off trees and large trees blown down. Mobile homes and poorly constructed
signs are destroyed. Low-lying escape routes are cut off by rising water 3 to 5 hours before arrival of the hurricane
center. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures, and larger structures are damaged by battering by ﬂoating
debris. Terrain continuously lower than 1.5 m (5 ft) above mean sea level may be ﬂooded inland 13 km (8 mi) or more.
Evacuation of low-lying residences within several blocks of the shoreline may be required. Hurricane Roxanne of 1995
was a Category Three hurricane at landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico; Hurricane Fran of 1996 was a Category
Three hurricane at landfall in North Carolina.

Winds 210 to 249 km/hr (131 to 155 mph). Storm surge generally 4 to 5.5 m (13 to 18 ft) above normal. More extensive
wall failures, with some complete roof structure failures on small residences. Shrubs, trees, and all signs are blown
down. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Extensive damage to doors and windows. Low-lying escape routes
may be cut off by rising water 3 to 5 hours before arrival of the hurricane center. Major damage to lower ﬂoors of
structures near the shore. Terrain lower than 3.1 m (10 ft) above sea level may be ﬂooded, requiring massive
evacuation of residential areas as far inland as 10 km (6 mi). Hurricane Luis of 1995 was a Category Four hurricane
while moving over the Leeward Islands; Hurricanes Felix and Opal of 1995 also reached Category Four at peak
intensity. Hurricane Katrina (2005) was Category Four at landfall.

Winds greater than 249 km/hr (155 mph). Storm surge generally greater than 5.5 m (18 ft) above normal. Complete
roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings. Some complete building failures, with small utility buildings
blown over or away. All shrubs, trees, and signs blown down. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Severe and
extensive window and door damage. Low-lying escape routes are cut off by rising water 3 to 5 hours before arrival of
the hurricane center. Major damage to lower ﬂoors of all structures located less than 4.6 m (15 ft) above sea level and
within 458 m (500 yd) of the shoreline. Massive evacuation of residential areas on low ground within 8 to 16 km (5 to
10 mi) of the shore line may be required. Hurricane Mitch of 1998 was a Category Five hurricane at peak intensity over
the western Caribbean. Hurricane Gilbert of 1988 was a Category Five hurricane at peak intensity and was one of the
strongest Atlantic tropical cyclones of record.

One  of  three  likely  storm  tracks  may  develop
(Figure 11.22, page 392):

1. A storm heads toward the east coast of Flori-
da,  sometimes  passing  over  islands  such  as
Puerto  Rico,  and  then,  before  striking  the
land,  it  moves  out  into  the  Atlantic  to  the
northeast.

2. A storm travels over Cuba and into the Gulf of

Mexico to strike the Gulf Coast.

3. A storm skirts along the East Coast and may
strike land from central Florida to New York.
Storms that may develop into hurricanes are
closely monitored from both satellites and
specially designed aircraft that ﬂy through 
the storms.

Coastal Processes

Hazards  presented  by  hurricanes  include  high
winds that may rip shingles and rafters from roofs,
blow over large trees and utility lines, and generally
wreak  havoc  on  structures  built  by  people.  The
processes that kill most people and often cause the
most damage, however, are ﬂooding resulting from
intense  precipitation  and  landward  transport  of

wind-driven  waves  of  ocean  waters  and,  as  previ-
ously mentioned, storm surges.17

The probability that a hurricane will strike a par-
ticular  80  km  (50  mi)  coastal  segment  of  the  At-
lantic  or  Gulf  Coast  in  a  given  year  is  shown  in
Figure 11.23. Notice that the probabilities are par-
ticularly  high  in  southern  Florida  and  on  the
Louisiana coastline.

Property  damage  from  hurricanes  can  be  stag-
gering, as in the case of Hurricane Katrina. As an-
other example, consider Hurricane Andrew, which
struck Florida in August 1992. The storm was one
of  the  costliest  storms  in  U.S.  history,  with  esti-
mated  damages  in  excess  of  $25  billion.  Despite
evacuation, 23 lives were lost as a direct result of
the  storm,  and  250,000  people  were  temporarily
rendered homeless. Damages to homes and other
buildings  were  extensive:  About  25,000  homes
were destroyed as entire neighborhoods in Florida
were  flattened  (Figure  11.24).18 More  than
100,000  buildings  were  damaged,  including  the
National  Hurricane  Center  in  Florida,  where  a
radar  antenna  housed  in  a  protective  dome  was
torn from the roof.18 Two hurricanes in the sum-
mer of 1996 struck the North Carolina coast. The
second storm in August caused about $3 billion in
property damage and killed more than 20 people.

Although  the  population  has  increased  along  the
Atlantic  and  Gulf  Coasts,  the  loss  of  lives  from
hurricanes  has  decreased  significantly  because  of
more  effective  detection  and  warning.  The
amount of property damage, however, has greatly
increased.

There  is  concern  for  large  cities  such  as  Miami
and New Orleans (especially after experiencing Kat-
rina  in  2005).  Unsatisfactory  evacuation  routes,
building codes, and disaster preparedness may con-
tribute to another catastrophic hurricane along the
Atlantic or Gulf Coast.

CHAPTER 11

Coastal Processes

11.7 Perception of 

and Adjustment to 
Coastal Hazards

Perception of Coastal Erosion
An  individual’s  past  experience,  proximity  to  the
coastline,  and  probability  of  suffering  property
damage  all  play  primary  roles  in  the  perception  of
coastal  erosion  as  a  natural  hazard.  One  study  of
coastal erosion of sea cliffs near Bolinas, California,
24  km  (15  mi)  north  of  the  entrance  to  the  San
Francisco Bay, established that people living close to
the coast in an area likely to experience damage in
the near future are generally very well informed and
see  the  erosion  as  a  direct  and  serious  threat.16,19
People living a few hundred meters from a possible
hazard,  although  aware  of  the  hazard,  know  little
about its frequency of occurrence, severity, and pre-
dictability. Still farther inland, people are aware that
coastal erosion exists but have little perception of it
as a hazard.

Adjustment to Coastal Hazards
Tropical Cyclones. People adjust to the tropical
cyclone hazard either by doing nothing and bear-
ing  the  loss  or  by  taking  some  kind  of  action  to
modify potential loss. For example, homes in hur-
ricane-prone  areas  may  be  constructed  to  allow
the  storm  surge  to  pass  under  the  house  (Figure
11.25). Community adjustments include attempts
to  modify  potential  loss  by  strengthening  the

structed with strong blocks to withstand
hurricane-force wind and space below to
allow the ﬂow of a storm surge beneath
the building. (Edward A. Keller)

environment  with  protective  structures  and  land
stabilization and by adapting better land use zon-
ing,  evacuation  procedures,  and  warning  proce-
dures.  20 Some  general  guidelines  of  what  to  do
before, during, and after a hurricane are listed in
Table 11.2.

Coastal Erosion. Adjustments  to  coastal  erosion
generally fall into one of three categories:

• Beach nourishment that tends to imitate nat-

ural processes, the “soft solution”

• Shoreline stabilization through structures such

as groins and sea walls, the “hard” solution

• Land  use  change  that  attempts  to  avoid  the
problem by not building in hazardous areas or
by relocating threatened buildings

A preliminary process in any approach to manag-
ing coastal erosion is estimating the rates of erosion.
Estimates of future erosion rates are based on his-
torical shoreline change or statistical analysis of the
oceanographic  environment,  such  as  the  waves,
wind,  and  sediment  supply  that  affect  coastal  ero-

TABLE 11.2 What to Do Before, During, and After a Hurricane 

• Probably the most important thing you can do before a hurricane is to plan your evacuation route. The plan should

include information concerning the safest evacuation route as well as locations of nearby shelters. Be prepared to drive
inland to a safe place 13 to 31 km (20 to 50 mi).

• Prepare a disaster kit, including a ﬂashlight with extra batteries, a portable battery-operated radio, a ﬁrst-aid kit,

emergency food and water, a can opener, necessary medicines, cash and credit cards, and a change of clothes, including
sturdy shoes.

• Make arrangements to care for your pets. Pets may not be allowed in emergency shelters.
• Have a family plan on how to respond after a hurricane and be sure that members of the family know how to turn off

household gas, electricity, and water.

• Teach young children when and how to call for emergency assistance from police or ﬁre departments and which radio

stations to listen to for emergency information.

• Protect your windows with permanent shutters or be prepared to use plywood panels cut to ﬁt each window. It is

important to put up window protection long before the storm arrives.

• Homeowner insurance policies do not cover damage from ﬂooding that accompanies a hurricane, so obtain ﬂood

insurance.

• Develop a family emergency communication plan. Family members may be separated during a disaster. Your plan

should include how you are going to get back together.

• Ask an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as your family contact. After a hurricane, it is often easier to call long

distance than within your area. Be sure everyone in your family knows the name, address, and phone number of the
family contact.

• Hurricanes are generally spotted far out at sea days before they strike land. A hurricane watch is issued when there is a

threat that hurricane conditions will occur within 24 to 36 hours. A hurricane warning is issued when hurricane
conditions are expected in 24 hours or less.

• Listen to your television or radio for hurricane progress reports.
• Check emergency supplies.
• Be sure there is fuel in your car.
• Bring inside outdoor objects such as lawn furniture, toys, and garden tools. Objects that cannot be brought inside should

be anchored.

• Secure your home and other buildings by closing and boarding up windows.
• Remove outside antennas or satellite dishes.
• Because power outages are likely during a storm, turn your refrigerator and freezer to the coldest possible settings and

open them only when absolutely necessary.

• Store drinking water in clean bathtubs, bottles, and cooking utensils.
• Review with your family your evacuation plan.
• If you have a boat, be sure it is secure or moved to a designated safe place.

• Listen constantly to television or radio for ofﬁcial instructions.
• If you live in a mobile home, check your tiedowns and evacuate immediately.
• Store your valuables and personal papers in waterproof containers in the highest level of your home.
• Avoid elevators.
• Stay inside and away from windows, skylights, and glass doors.
• Keep a supply of ﬂashlights and extra batteries on hand. Avoid using open ﬂames such as candles or kerosene lamps.
• If electrical power is lost, turn off major appliances to reduce power surges when electricity is restored.
• If ofﬁcials indicate that evacuation is necessary, leave as soon as possible, avoiding ﬂooded roads and washed-out

bridges. Secure your home by unplugging appliances and turning off electricity and the main water valve. Let someone
outside the storm area know where you are going. If time permits, move furniture to protect it from ﬂooding; if possible,
move it to a higher ﬂoor. Load preassembled emergency supplies and warm protective clothing, including sleeping bags
and blankets. Finally, lock up your home and leave!

• Stay tuned to local radio and television for information.
• Assist injured or trapped persons. Do not move seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger. Call 

for help.

• Return to your home only after authorities have advised you that it is safe to do so.
• When you return home, be aware of the possibility of dangling power lines and enter your home with caution. Be aware

of snakes, insects, and animals that may have been driven to higher ground by ﬂoodwaters. Open your windows and
doors to ventilate and dry your home. Check your refrigerator for foods that may have spoiled. Finally, take pictures of
the damage to both the house and its contents for insurance purposes.

agement and is at the heart of land use planning to
minimize damage from coastal erosion.

We are at a crossroads today with respect to adjust-
ment  to  coastal  erosion.  One  road  leads  to  ever-
increasing coastal defenses in an attempt to control
the  processes  of  erosion.  The  second  road  involves
learning to live with coastal erosion through ﬂexible
environmental  planning  and  wise  land  use  in  the
coastal zone.22,23 The ﬁrst road follows history in our
attempt to control coastal erosion through the con-
struction of engineering structures, such as seawalls.
In  the  second  road,  structures  in  the  coastal  zone,
with  such  exceptions  as  critical  facilities  in  certain
areas, are considered temporary and expendable. De-
velopment in the coastal zone must be in the best in-
terests of the general public rather than for a few who
proﬁt from developing the oceanfront. This philoso-
phy is at odds with the viewpoint of developers, who
consider the coastal zone too valuable not to develop.
In  fact,  development  in  the  coastal  zone  is  not  the

problem; rather, the problem lies in the inappropriate
development  of  hazardous  areas  and  areas  better
suited for uses other than building. In other words,
beaches  belong  to  all  people  to  enjoy,  not  only  to
those fortunate enough to purchase beachfront prop-
erty. The state of Hawaii has taken this idea to heart:
There, all beaches are public property, and local prop-
erty owners cannot deny access to others.

Accepting the philosophy that, with minor excep-
tions,  coastal  zone  development  is  temporary  and
expendable and that consideration should ﬁrst be to
the  general  public  requires  an  appreciation  of  the
following ﬁve principles:22

1. Coastal erosion is a natural process rather

than a natural hazard; erosion problems occur
when people build structures in the coastal
zone. The coastal zone is an area where natur-
al processes associated with waves and moving
sediment occur. Because such an environment

A 

Closer 
Look

E-Lines and E-Zones

Recently, a special committee of the
National Research Council (NRC), at
the request of the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency (FEMA),
developed coastal zone manage-
ment recommendations, some of
which follow:21
• Future erosion rates should be es-
timated on the basis of historical
shore line change or statistical
analysis of the oceanographic en-
vironment (i.e., the waves, wind,
and sediment supply that affect
coastal erosion).

• E-lines and E-zones based on ero-

sion rates should be mapped
(Figure 11.G). The E stands for
erosion; for example, the E-10 line
is the location of expected erosion
in 10 years. The E-10 zone is con-
sidered to be an imminent hazard
where no new habitable struc-
tures should be allowed. The 
setback distance depends on 
the erosion rate. For example, if
the rate is 1 m (3.3 ft) per year, the
E-10 setback is 10 m (33 ft).

• Movable structures are allowed in

the intermediate and long-term
hazard zones (E-10 to E-60) (see
Figure 11.G).

• Permanent large structures are al-
lowed at setbacks greater than the
E-60 line.

• New structures built seaward of
the E-60 line, with the exception
of those on high bluffs or sea
cliffs, should be constructed on
pilings to withstand erosion asso-
ciated with a high-magnitude

FIGURE 11.G Erosion hazard zones Idealized diagram illustrating the con-
cept of the E-lines and E-zones based on the rate of coastal erosion from a refer-
ence point such as the sea cliff or dune line. The width of the zone depends on the
rate of erosion and deﬁnes a setback distance. Of course, even with setbacks based
on 60 years of expected erosion (E-60 line), eventually, 60 years down the road,
structures will be much closer to the shoreline and will become vulnerable to ero-
sion. It is a form of planned obsolescence. (From National Research Council. 1990.

storm with a recurrence interval
of 100 years.
NRC recommendations concern-

ing setbacks are considered to be
minimum standards for state or local
coastal erosion management pro-
grams. A small number of states (in-
cluding Florida, New Jersey, New

York, and North Carolina) use a set-
back based on the rate of erosion;
however, most states do not require
this type of setback. Nevertheless, the
concept of E-lines and E-zones based
on erosion-designated setbacks and
allowable construction has real merit
in coastal zone management.

Coastal Processes

will have a certain amount of natural erosion,
the best land uses are those compatible with
change. These include recreational activities
such as swimming and ﬁshing.

2. Any shoreline construction causes change. The

beach environment is dynamic. Any interfer-
ence with natural processes produces a variety
of secondary and tertiary changes, many of
which may have adverse consequences. Ad-
verse consequences are particularly likely
when engineering structures, such as groins
and sea walls that affect the storage and ﬂow
of sediment along a coastal area, are used.

3. Stabilization of the coastal zone through engi-

neering structures protects the property of
relatively few people at a large expense to the
general public. Engineering structures along
the shoreline are often meant to protect devel-
oped property, not the beach itself. It has been
argued that the interests of people who own
shoreline property are not compatible with the
public interest and that it is unwise to expend
large amounts of public funds to protect the
property of a few.

4. Engineering structures designed to protect a
beach may eventually destroy it. Engineering
structures often modify the coastal environ-
ment to such an extent that it may scarcely re-
semble a beach. For example, construction of

large sea walls causes reﬂection of waves and
turbulence that eventually narrow the beach.
5. Once constructed, shoreline engineering struc-

tures produce a trend in coastal development
that is difﬁcult, if not impossible, to reverse.
Engineering structures often lead to additional
repairs and larger structures, with spiraling
costs. In some areas, the cost of the structures
eventually exceeds the value of the beach prop-
erty itself. For these and other reasons, several
states have recently imposed severe limitations
on future engineering construction intended
to stabilize the coastline. As sea levels continue
to rise and coastal erosion becomes more wide-
spread, the nonstructural alternatives to the
problem should continue to receive favorable
attention because of both ﬁnancial necessity
and the recognition that the amenities of the
coastal zone should be kept intact for future
generations to enjoy.

If  you  consider  purchasing  land  in  the  coastal
zone, remember these guidelines:23 (1) Allow for a
good setback from the beach or sea cliff; (2) be high
enough above sea level to avoid ﬂooding; (3) construct
buildings  to  withstand  adverse  weather,  especially
high  winds;  and  (4)  if  hurricanes  are  a  possibility,
be  sure  there  are  adequate  evacuation  routes.
Remember, it is always risky to buy property where
land meets water.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About Moving the Lighthouses 
to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. What are potential links between
human population, land use, and
coastal planning that go into the
process of deciding whether to
move a structure from the
coastal erosion hazard zone or to
defend it where it is?

2. How does moving a lighthouse
relate to sustainable coastlines?
Start by deﬁning what a sustain-
able coastline might be.

3. What are the scientiﬁc questions
concerning possibly moving the
Montauk Lighthouse on Long Is-
land? What are the values that
might be considered?

4. How do value judgments enter
into the decision of moving or
not moving structures vulnerable
to erosion back from harms way?

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts

399

Summary

The coastal environment is one of the
most dynamic areas on Earth, and
rapid change is a regular occurrence.
Migration of people to coastal areas is
a continuing trend, and approxi-
mately 75 percent of the population
in the United States now live in
coastal states.

Ocean waves are generated by

storms at sea and expend their energy
on the shoreline. Irregularities in the
shoreline account for local differences
in wave erosion; these irregularities
are largely responsible for determin-
ing the shape of the coast. Beaches
are most commonly formed by accu-
mulations of sand or gravel that are
deposited at the coast by rivers and
shaped by wave action. Actually,
beaches can form from any loose ma-
terial, such as broken shells or coral or
volcanic rock, located in the shore
zone. Waves striking a beach at an
angle result in longshore transport of
the beach sediments.

Rip currents are a serious hazard

to swimmers, killing up to 200 people
a year in the United States. They can
be recognized and avoided, and it is
possible to escape from them if you
do not panic.

Although coastal erosion causes a
relatively small amount of property
damage compared with other natural

hazards, such as river flooding,
earthquakes, and tropical cyclones,
it is a serious problem along all the
coasts of the United States, includ-
ing the shorelines of the Great Lakes.
Factors contributing to coastal
erosion include river damming,
high-magnitude storms, and the
worldwide rise in sea level.

Human interference with natural

coastal processes, such as the building
of sea walls, groins, breakwaters, and
jetties, is occasionally successful, but in
many cases, it has caused considerable
coastal erosion. Sand tends to accumu-
late on the updrift side of the structure
and erode on the downdrift side. Most
problems occur in areas with high pop-
ulation density, but sparsely populated
areas along the Outer Banks in North
Carolina are also experiencing trouble
with coastal erosion. Beach nourish-
ment has had limited success in restor-
ing or widening beaches, but it re-
mains to be seen whether it will be
effective in the long term.

The most catastrophic coastal haz-
ard is the tropical cyclone. Also called
typhoons and hurricanes, tropical cy-
clones are violent storms that bring
high winds, storm surges, and river
ﬂooding. They continue to take thou-
sands of lives and to cause billions of
dollars in property damage.

Perception of the coastal erosion
hazard depends mainly on the indi-
vidual’s experience with and proxim-
ity to the hazard. Community and
individual adjustments to tropical
cyclones generally attempt to modify
the environment by building protec-
tive structures designed to lessen
potential damage or to encourage
change in people’s behavior by better
land use zoning, evacuation, and
warning.

Adjustment to coastal erosion in
developed areas is often the “techno-
logical ﬁx”: building sea walls, groins,
and other structures or (more re-
cently) using beach nourishment.
These approaches to stabilizing
beaches have had mixed success and
may cause additional problems in ad-
jacent areas. Engineering structures
are very expensive, require mainte-
nance, and, once in place, are difﬁcult
to remove. The cost of engineering
structures may eventually exceed the
value of the properties they protect;
such structures may even destroy the
beaches they were intended to save.
Managing coastal erosion will beneﬁt
from careful land use planning that
emphasizes establishment of desig-
nated setbacks and allowable con-
struction determined by predicted
rates of coastal erosion.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
Many populated areas are located
near the coast, and human population
in the coastal zone is expected to con-

generations. Sustaining the coast will
involve learning to live with and ad-

use planning that  maintains the in-
tegrity of the coastal environment.

valuable property on Earth. In order
to maintain a quality environment in

Earth as a System Coastal envi-
ronments are complex systems
where rapid change is often the

in the coastal environment is a

Hazardous Earth Processes,
Risk Assessment, and 
Perception The most hazardous
processes in the coastal environ-
ment are coastal erosion and flood-
ing associated with tropical cy-
clones. The impacts of these hazards
are increasing as a result of in-
creased development in the coastal
zone and global climate change,
which is causing a rise in sea level.
In general, people living in the
coastal zone are aware of potential

hazards, and there have been many
studies in coastal areas to evaluate
risk and to recommend appropriate
adjustments so that loss of life and
property may be minimized.

Scientific Knowledge  and
Values It is clear that people value
the coastal environment. Scientiﬁc

knowledge concerning coastal
processes is a mature ﬁeld of study,
and, in general, we know where haz-
ards are most likely to occur and what
their potential impacts are. Solutions
to reducing coastal hazards vary from
building hard engineering structures
to reduce damage to softer approaches
that allow us to live in the coastal zone

and adjust to hazards. The solution we
choose for a particular site depends in
part upon how we value the coastal
zone. For example, if a row of beach
homes is being threatened by erosion,
the choices may be building a sea wall,
which would eventually cause the loss
of the beach, or moving the homes in-
land, out of harm’s way.

Case History
The Tunguska Event

On June 30, 1908, shortly
after 7 A.M., witnesses in
Siberia reported observ-
ing a blue-white ﬁreball
with a glowing tail de-
scending from the sky.
The ﬁreball exploded
above the Tunguska
River Valley in a heav-
ily forested, sparsely
populated area. Later,
calculations would
show that the explo-
sion had the force of 
10 megatons of TNT,
equivalent to 10 hydrogen
bombs. Though there were

few witnesses close to the
event, the sounds from the 

explosion were heard hundreds 

of kilometers away, and the blast

wave was recorded at meteorological
recording sites throughout Europe.
The tremendous air blast caused 
more than 2,000 km2 (770 mi2) of
forest to be ﬂattened and burned
(Figure 12.1).

A herdsman in the vicinity of the
blast was one of the few people who
witnessed the devastation on the
ground. His hut was completely ﬂat-
tened by the blast, and its roof was
blown away. Other witnesses a few
tens of kilometers from the explosion
reported that they were physically
blown into the air and knocked un-
conscious; they awoke to ﬁnd a trans-
formed landscape of smoke and
burning trees that had been blasted
to the ground.

At the time of the explosion, Russia
was in the midst of political upheaval.

As a result, there was no quick 
response to or investigation of the
Tunguska event. Finally, in 1924, 
geologists who were working in the 
region interviewed surviving witnesses
and determined that the blast from
the explosion was probably heard
over an area of at least 1 million km2
(386,000 mi2) and that the ﬁreball had
been witnessed by hundreds of people.
Russian scientists went into the area in
1927, expecting to ﬁnd an impact
crater produced by the asteroid that
had apparently struck the area. 
Surprisingly, they found no crater,
leading them to conclude that the dev-
astation had been caused by an aerial
explosion, probably at an elevation of
about 7 km (4.3 mi). Later calculations
estimated the size of the asteroid re-
sponsible for the explosion to be about

12.1 Earth’s Place in Space
We introduced a quick history of the origin of the
universe and Earth in Chapter 1, and you may wish
to  review  that  discussion.  The  story  is  a  magniﬁ-
cent one, with much of the mystery now removed
but  the  wonder  remaining.  It  is  a  story  of  how
Earth, our home, evolved from a barren, nonliving
planet  into  one  ﬁlled  with  and  modiﬁed  by  life
(Figure 12.2). It is a story of change, with periodic
drama caused by continued impact of material from
outer space.4,5

Asteroids, Meteoroids, and Comets
There  are  literally  trillions  of  particles  in  our  solar
system, ranging in size from dust that is a fraction of
a  millimeter  in  diameter  to  larger  bodies  such  as
asteroids that  range  in  diameter  from  about  10  m
(32 ft) to 1,000 km (621 mi). For the most part, aster-
oids are found in the asteroid belt, which is a region

between Mars and Jupiter (Figure 12.3, page 406).
The  asteroids,  which  are  composed  of  either  rock
material, metallic material, or rocky-metal mixtures,
would  pose  no  threat  to  Earth  if  they  remained  in
the asteroid belt. Unfortunately, they move around
and collide with one another, and a number of them
are now in orbits that intersect Earth’s orbit. When
asteroids break into smaller particles they are known
as meteoroids (Table 12.1, page 406), which range
in size from dust particles to objects a few meters in
diameter.  When  a  meteoroid  enters  Earth’s  atmos-
phere,  it  is  known  as  a  meteor.  As  they  streak
through the atmosphere, meteors—sometimes called
shooting stars—produce light that results from fric-
tional  heating.  Sometimes  meteors  occur  in  large
numbers, producing meteor showers.

The orbits of comets, which range in size from a
few meters to a few hundred kilometers in diameter,
also sometimes intersect Earth’s orbit. Comets are
thought  to  be  composed  of  a  rocky  core  sur-
rounded  by  ice  and  covered  in  carbon-rich  dust.

25 to 50 m (82 to 164 ft) in diameter. 
It was most likely composed of rela-
tively friable (i.e., easy to crumble)
stony material.1,2

The people of Earth were lucky

that the Tunguska event occurred in
a sparsely populated, forested region.
If the blast had occurred over a city
such as London, Paris, or Tokyo, the
lives of millions of people would have
been lost. Tunguska-type events are
thought to occur on the order of
every 1,000 years.3 A widely reported

asteroid occurred in March 2004. The

ter and passed between Earth and
the moon at a distance of about
43,000 km (25,000 mi).*

and others are composed of native metals such as iron
and nickel. Others are stony, consisting of silicate
minerals  such  as  olivine  and  pyroxene—com-
mon minerals in igneous rocks. Stony mete-
oroids  and  asteroids  are  said  to  be
differentiated,  meaning  that  they  have
undergone 
igneous  and  sometimes
metamorphic  processes  as  part  of
their geologic histories. As previously
mentioned,  meteoroids  and  aster-
oids  come  from  the  asteroid  belt,
which is between the orbits of Mars
and  Jupiter,  whereas  comets  come
from the Kuiper belt or Oort Cloud.
Regardless of where they come from,
when they intersect Earth’s orbit and
enter  our  atmosphere,  meteoroids,
asteroids,  and  comets  undergo  re-
markable changes as they heat up due to
friction during descent, producing bright
light.  If  the  object  actually  strikes  Earth,
then  we  speak  of  it  as  a  meteorite.  Many
meteorites have been collected from around
the  world,  particularly  from  Antarctica.  Figure  12.5
shows a hypothetical diagram of a meteoroid entering
the  atmosphere  about  85  km  (53  mi)  above  Earth’s
surface. The meteoroid becomes a meteor and emits
light. It will either result in an airburst in the atmos-
phere at an altitude between 12 and 50 km (7.5 and
31  mi)  or  collide  with  Earth  to  become  a  meteorite.
The Tunguska event that opened this chapter was a
giant airburst, but the surface of Earth has a signiﬁ-
cant number of meteorite craters, and more than 100
have been identiﬁed.1

Impact Craters
The  most  direct  and  obvious  evidence  for  impacts
on  the  surface  of  Earth  comes  from  studying  the
craters they produce. The 50,000-year-old Barringer
Crater in Arizona is perhaps the most famous mete-
orite crater in the United States. Known as “Meteor
Crater,”  it  is  an  extremely  well-preserved,  bowl-
shaped depression with a pronounced, upraised rim
(Figure  12.6a,  page  409).  The  rim  of  the  crater  is
overlain  by  an  ejecta  blanket  (i.e.,  layer  of  debris
blown out of the crater upon impact) that today can
be identiﬁed as hummocky terrain surrounding the
crater. Figure 12.6b shows that the present crater is

FIGURE 12.4 Comet Hale-Bopp 1997. (Aaron Horowitz/Corbis)

They are believed to have originated far out in the
solar  system,  beyond  Neptune  in  the  Kuiper  belt
and Oort Cloud (Figure 12.3), which extends as far
as 50,000 times the distance from the Earth to the
Sun.2 Figure  12.4 shows  the  comet  Hale-Bopp,
visible from Earth in 1997. The characteristic tail
of the comet is composed of dust and gas that es-
cape as the comet is warmed by the Sun and moves
through space.

Early  in  the  history  of  the  evolution  of  Earth,
bombardment by asteroids and comets contributed
the  building  blocks  of  our  planet,  which  was  built
from the collision of innumerable bodies. Asteroids
and comets contain water, and impacts through geo-
logic time delivered the water that later formed our
oceans by volcanic degassing.

12.2 Aerial Bursts and Impacts
When entering Earth’s atmosphere, asteroids, comets,
and  meteoroids  travel  at  velocities  that  range  from
about 12 to 72 km per second (26,000 to 156,000 mi
per  hour).1 A  speeding  bullet  from  a  high-powered
riﬂe would initially be as much as 1.5 km per second.
Asteroids and meteoroids are variable in composition
(Table  12.1).  Some  contain  carbonaceous  material,

not nearly as deep as the initial impact crater. This is
because material has fallen back into the crater and
because the crater has partially collapsed. The rocks
that  the  asteroid  impacted  were  shattered  and  de-
formed, forming what is known as brecciated rock,
composed  of  angular  broken  pieces  of  rocks  pro-
duced during the impact. Barringer Crater is approx-
imately 1.2 km (0.75 mi) in diameter, with a depth
of about 180 m (590 ft). The rim of the crater rises
about 260 m (850 ft) above the surrounding topog-
raphy.  When  Americans  ﬁrst  discovered  Barringer
Crater in the late nineteenth century, there was a lot
of  debate  concerning  its  origin.  Ironically,  G.  K.
Gilbert,  the  famous  geologist  who  postulated  that
the majority of the moon’s craters were formed by

impacts,  did  not  believe  that  Barringer  Crater  was
formed by impact. Only through careful study and
evaluation  was  it  ﬁnally  concluded  that  Barringer
Crater in fact resulted from the impact of a small as-
teroid, probably about 25 to 100 m (80 to 330 ft) in
diameter.6

The  process  of  impact  differentiates  impact

processes, such as volcanic activity. This is because
the  processes  related  to  impacts  involve  extremely
high  velocity,  energy,  pressure,  and  temperature,
which normally are not experienced or produced by
other geologic processes. Most of the energy of the
impact is in the form of kinetic energy, or energy of
movement. This energy is transferred to Earth’s sur-

face  through  a  shock  wave  that  propagates  into
Earth.  The  shock  wave  compresses,  heats,  melts,
and excavates Earth materials. It is this transfer of
kinetic energy that produces the crater.6 The shock
can metamorphose some of the rocks in the impact
area while others are melted or vaporized and mixed
with  the  materials  of  the  impacting  object  itself.
Most of the metamorphism consists of high-pressure
modiﬁcations of minerals such as quartz. Such mod-
iﬁcations are characteristic of meteorite impact and
are extremely helpful in conﬁrming the origin of a
meteorite  crater.  A  typical  small  crater,  a  few  kilo-
meters in diameter, is idealized in Figure 12.7a. The
same  process  of  vaporization,  melting,  ejection  of
material,  formation  of  ejecta  rims,  and  inﬁlling  of
the  crater  also  occurs  for  large,  more  complex

craters, but the shape of a larger crater may be quite
different (Figure 12.7b, page 411). Complex craters
over a period of seconds to several minutes follow-
ing impact may grow to sizes of tens of kilometers
to over 100 km (62 mi) in diameter. A pattern of
more complete rim collapse and central crater up-
lift occurs following the impact. In general, impact
craters  on  Earth  that  are  larger  than  about  6  km
(3.7 mi) are complex, whereas smaller craters tend
to be more simple.

Geologically,  ancient  impact  craters  are  difﬁcult
to  identify  because  they  have  often  been  either
eroded  or  ﬁlled  with  sedimentary  rocks  that  are
younger  than  the  impact.  For  example,  subsurface
imaging and drilling below the present Chesapeake
Bay have identiﬁed a crater about 85 km (53 mi) in

diameter,  now  buried  by  about  1  km  (0.62  mi)  of
sediment (Figure 12.8). The crater was produced by
impact  of  a  comet  or  an  asteroid  about  3  to  5  km
(1.9  to  3  mi)  in  diameter  about  35  million  years
ago.7 Compaction  and  faulting  above  the  buried
crater may be in part responsible for the location of
the bay.

A  good  example  of  an  eroded  impact  crater  is
found  near  Quebec,  Canada.  A  ring-shaped  lake
about 70 km (45 mi) across is eroded along impact-
brecciated  (broken)  rocks,  marking  most  of  the

crater, which is about 100 km (62 mi) in diameter
(Figure 12.9).8

Most  detailed  remote-sensing  studies  of  craters
come from evaluation of these features on the moon
and  Mars.  Impact  craters  are  much  more  common
on the moon than on Earth because as smaller ob-
jects enter Earth’s atmosphere, they tend to burn up
and disintegrate before actually striking the surface.
Studying impact features on the moon and Mars has
greatly increased our understanding of the process
of impact and the associated surface features.

Early in 1994, a comet known as Shoemaker-Levy
9  (discovered  in  1993)  provided  visual  evidence  of
the  most  tremendous  impacts  ever  witnessed.  The
comet was unusual in that it was composed of sev-
eral  discrete  comet  fragments  with  several  bright
tails. It was reported as a misshapen comet. It was
determined  that  the  comet  was  a  member  of  the
Jupiter family of comets (comets that circle between
Jupiter and the Sun), about 50 of which are known.
The orbit of the comet was tied to that of Jupiter,
and  after  years  of  orbiting  the  planet,  it  separated
into 21 fragments known as a “string of pearls.” As
the fragments of the comet entered Jupiter’s atmos-
phere  at  speeds  of  about  60  km/sec  (37  mi/sec),
they  exploded,  releasing  energy  on  the  order  of
10,000 megatons for the smaller fragments and as
much as 100,000 megatons for the larger fragments
(Figure 12.10). The total amount of energy released
was estimated to be more than would be released by
Earth’s entire store of nuclear weapons if detonated

at one time. Hot, compressed gaseous emissions ex-
panded  violently  upward  from  the  lower  part  of
Jupiter’s atmosphere at speeds as high as 10 km/sec
(6.2  mi/sec).  These  plumes  of  gas  from  the  larger
impacts reached elevations of more than 3,000 km
(1,864 mi), as tremendously large rings that exceed
the diameter of Earth developed around the sites of
the  impact.  It  was  truly  a  remarkable  show  for  as-
tronomers and a sobering event for those who con-
sider that impacts such as this might one day occur
on Earth.2

Now that we have viewed the impact of the frag-
mented  comet  on  Jupiter  and  studied  Barringer
Crater in Arizona as well as several others on Earth,
the idea of the possibility of catastrophic impacts on
Earth is ﬁnally being accepted. When the Tunguska
event  that  opened  this  chapter  occurred,  several
bizarre ideas were suggested to explain it, including
nuclear  explosions  and  even  the  explosion  of  an
alien spaceship! The idea that impacts by asteroids

and comets might cause catastrophes on Earth, and
even mass extinction of life, was greatly resisted by
scientists until very recently.

12.3 Mass Extinctions
A  mass  extinction  is  characterized  by  the  sudden
loss of large numbers of plants and animals relative
to the number of new species being added.9 Because
the geologic time scale was originally based on fos-
sils and the appearance and disappearance of differ-
ent species, mass extinctions correlate to boundaries
in the geologic time scale, as shown in Table 2.1 and
Figure 1A. Many hypotheses have been suggested for
mass extinction events, including (1) relatively rapid
climate change; (2) plate tectonics, a relatively slow
process  that  moves  the  position  of  continents  and
thus  environments  to  different  locations;  (3)  ex-
tremely  large  volcanic  events  that  erupted  huge
volumes  of  volcanic  ash  into  the  atmosphere  and
changed  the  climate;  and  (4)  impact  of  a  large  ex-
traterrestrial object.

During the past 550 million years of Earth his-
tory,  there  have  been  six  major  mass  extinction
events.  The  four  earliest  extinction  events  are
being  studied  intensively  to  test  the  hypothesis

that impacts of large asteroids or comets were in-
volved.  As  dating  of  extinction  events  improves,
we  may  to  be  able  to  determine  how  fast  the  ex-
tinction  occurred.  A  fast  mass  extinction  favors
impact  by  an  extraterrestrial  object  as  a  cause  of
extinction.

The  earliest  mass  extinction  occurred  approxi-
mately  443  million  years  ago,  near  the  end  of  the
Ordovician  period.  Although  not  much  is  known
about the cause of this extinction, it may have been
related  to  global  cooling.  Approximately  100  fami-
lies and their associated species became extinct dur-
ing this period. The next mass extinction occurred
about  90  million  years  later,  near  the  end  of  the
Devonian.  That  extinction  was  responsible  for  the
death  of  about  70  percent  of  all  (marine)  inverte-
brate species and was also probably related to climate
change and global cooling. The third mass extinction
occurred  near  the  end  of  the  Permian—about 
245 million years ago—when 95 percent of all ma-
rine  species  died.  Although  there  is  now  an  argu-
ment for impact at the Permian–Triassic boundary,
it is also believed that this mass extinction possibly
spanned  a  period  of  about  7  million  years.  It  is
thought that global cooling, followed by rapid global
warming with large variations in climate, may have
been responsible. There was also signiﬁcant volcanic

activity  during  this  time,  and  the  tremendous
amount of volcanic ash and gases in the atmosphere
probably  contributed  to  the  cooling.  At  the  end  of
the Cretaceous period (i.e., the K-T boundary), an-
other  tremendous  mass  extinction  event  occurred.
This event was sudden, and there is abundant evi-
dence to suggest that it was caused by the impact of
a giant asteroid. Another mass extinction occurred
near the end of the Eocene, about 35 million years
ago. There is limited evidence that impact from an
asteroid or a comet may have occurred at that time,
but  many  scientists  link  the  extinction  to  cooling
and glaciation, which occurred approximately 40 to
30  million  years  ago.  Finally,  near  the  end  of  the
Pleistocene and into the present, there was an on-
going  mass  extinction  of  mammals,  reptiles,  am-
phibians,  birds,  ﬁsh,  and  plants.  It  is  possible  that
overhunting by Stone Age man may have been a par-
tial cause of this event. However, the loss of so many
large  mammals  in  North  America,  including  some
that  were  not  hunted,  may  point  to  other  causes
more  catastrophic  in  nature.  (See  A  Closer  Look:
Possible Extraterrestrial Impact 12,900 Years Ago.)
More recently, in the past 200 years, loss of habitat
as  a  result  of  land  use  changes,  widespread  defor-
estation,  and  application  of  chemicals  has  con-
tributed to ongoing extinction.9

While  some  of  these  extinction  events  are  be-
lieved to have been related to climate changes, the
case  for  impact-related  mass  extinction  65  million
years ago at the end of K-T boundary is well docu-
mented. The K-T extinction brought an end to the
dinosaurs,  which  had  been  at  the  top  of  the  food
chain for 100 million years or more. Their demise al-
lowed  small  mammals  to  expand  and  evolve  into
many  species,  including  humans,  that  are  present
on  nearly  all  land  areas  of  Earth  today.  A  similar
evolution also occurred in the oceans of the world.
We will now address the K-T extinction and the im-
pact hypothesis in more detail.

Late Cretaceous: K-T Boundary 
Mass Extinction
One  of  the  great  geologic  detective  stories  of  the
past 50 years is the investigation of the K-T mass ex-
tinction. We now believe that 65 million years ago, a
comet or an asteroid with a diameter of about 10 km
(6.2  mi)  impacted  Earth  in  the  vicinity  of  what  is
now  the  Yucatan  Peninsula.  That  event  changed

Mass Extinctions

415

Earth  history  forever.  Although  after  the  event
much  of  the  physical  landscape  of  Earth  remained
unchanged,  the  planet’s  inhabitants  were  changed
forever.  The  dinosaurs  disappeared,  as  did  many
species of plants and animals in both the oceans and
on land. Approximately 70 percent of all genera on
the  planet  and  their  associated  species  died  off.
Somehow,  animals  such  as  turtles,  alligators,  and
crocodiles  survived,  as  well  as  some  birds,  plants,
and smaller mammals. It is not known why some life
forms survived the mass extinction and others did
not. What we do know is that the demise of the di-
nosaurs  on  land  and  reptiles  and  dinosaurs  in  the
oceans  set  the  stage  for  mammals  that  eventually
produced  primates  and  humans.  What  would  the
world look like today if the K-T extinction had never
happened?  There’s  a  good  chance  that  humans
never would have evolved!

Now let’s back up and look at the history and de-
velopment of the hypothesis that the K-T mass ex-
tinction event was indeed caused by the impact of a
large comet or asteroid. The story is full of intrigue,
suspense,  rivalries,  and  cooperation—typical  of
many of the great scientiﬁc discoveries.10 A number
of  scientists  with  backgrounds  in  geology,  physics,
chemistry,  biology,  geophysics,  and  astronomy
worked together to develop and test the hypothesis
that  the  K-T  mass  extinction  was  triggered  by  an
impact.  Walter  Alvarez  asked  the  question  that
started it all: “What is the nature of the boundary
between rocks of the Cretaceous and Tertiary peri-
ods (65 million years ago)?”*

Alvarez was interested in Earth history and was
particularly  interested  in  reading  that  history  as
recorded  by  rocks.  Early  in  his  studies  of  the  K-T
boundary, Alvarez teamed up with his physicist fa-
ther,  Luis,  and  nuclear  chemists  Frank  Asaro  and
Helen Michel. They decided to measure the concen-
tration  of  a  platinum  metal  called  iridium  in  the
thin clay layer that represented the K-T boundary in
Italy. Walter Alvarez and colleagues initially went to
the  site  in  Italy  to  study  the  magnetic  history  of
Earth. What they found at the K-T boundary was a
very thin layer of clay. It looked as if the extinction

*Walter Alvarez wrote a book titled T. Rex and the Crater of Doom,
which was published in 1997 (Alvarez, 1997). While our discus-
sion will present some of the highlights of this story, interested
readers are invited to see Alvarez’s book for the complete story.

CHAPTER 12

Impact of Extraterrestrial Objects

A 

Closer
Look

Possible Extraterrestrial Impact 12,900 Years Ago

North America is ecologically differ-
ent today than it was 13,000 years
ago, when it was populated by 
Pleistocene megafauna that included
mammoths (a type of elephant;
Figure 12.A), dire wolves, American
lions, short-faced bears (which were
larger than modern grizzly bears),
giant ground sloths, camels, and
horses. Also present were Paleo
Americans, especially the Clovis cul-
ture. Suddenly and, perhaps, cata-
strophically, most of the megafauna
disappeared, and the Clovis culture
was no longer recognizable. The cli-
mate abruptly cooled, forming the
cold period known as the Younger
Dryas (named after tundra fossil
pollen of the dryas plant).15 The 

possible causes of the extinction of
the megafauna and the termination
of the Clovis culture has been a long-
standing and controversial subject.
The two major competing hypothe-
ses to explain the extinction of the
magafauna are overkill by humans
and abrupt cooling (i.e., rapid climate
change). Both of these hypotheses
have shortcomings. Human overkill
seems unlikely in light of the very
large numbers of animals that went
extinct, including many that the
Paleo Americans evidently did not
regularly hunt. The magnitude of the
abrupt cooling at the onset of the
Younger Dryas was little different
than what had often occurred over
the previous 80,000 years, and none

trated here, suddenly went extinct 12,900 years ago. (Jonathan Blair/Corbis)

of the earlier events were associated
with major extinctions. The conclu-
sion is that the extinction of Pleis-
tocene megafauna is unique during
the latest Pleistocene period and was
too abrupt and widely distributed to
have resulted from human overkill or
climatic cooling.15

At many Clovis sites, archeologists

have identiﬁed what is known as a
black mat that is a thin layer of car-
bonaceous, dark, organic-rich clays
(Figure 12.B). The base of the black
mat coincides with the beginning of
Younger Dryas cooling, after which
there is no evidence for “in place”re-
mains of the megafauna or artifacts
from the Clovis culture. Murray
Springs, Arizona, is a well-known and
well-studied Clovis site, where the
youngest mammoth bones and Clovis
tools are directly in contact with the
base of the black layer. At that site, it is
apparent that termination of Pleis-
tocene megafauna and Clovis culture
was very sudden, coinciding with the
deposition of the black mat.15,16

New evidence that has emerged

in the past several years suggests
that there may have been an 
extraterrestrial (cosmic) impact
12,900 years ago that contributed to
the Pleistocene megafauna extinc-
tions, as well as to the disappearance
of the Clovis culture.11 Evaluation of
10 Clovis sites, selected because they
were well documented and dated,
support the hypotheses that there
may have been a major extraterres-
trial collision over North America
12,900 years ago, at the beginning of
the Younger Dryas event. Hypotheti-
cally, the event consisted of one or
more (perhaps many) low-density 
extraterrestrial objects (probably

comets) that exploded in the atmos-
phere over much of North America.
At that time, much of Canada was
covered by the Laurentide Ice Sheet,
which was partially destabilized by
the proposed event. It is speculated
that many objects exploded over the
continent, including the ice sheet,
setting off heat ﬂashes and shock
waves and generating intense winds
(hundreds of kilometers per hour)
over North America. The event also
would have spawned ﬁreballs that
destroyed forests, grasslands, and an-
imals, while producing an abundance
of charcoal, ash, soot, and toxic
fumes.16 Evidence of this is found as

far west as Santa Rosa Island in the
Santa Barbara Channel.17

Physical evidence for the Younger
Dryas event includes the discovery of
a variety of possible extraterrestrial
markers, including magnetic grains
with iridium, magnetic micro
spherules, carbon spherules, charcoal
and soot, and evidence for intense
wildﬁres. An abundance of diamonds,
including nano diamonds (including
forms normally interpreted to be
formed only by cosmic impact), micro
diamonds, and shock diamonds (also
thought to form from cosmic impact),
have been discovered within the black
mat, but much less frequently above

and below the mat.13,14 As the hypoth-
esis of the Younger Dryas event con-
tinues to be tested, more data will be
forthcoming, and we will learn more
about the catastrophic event that
brought about the demise of the 
Pleistocene megafauna, the end of the
Clovis culture, and the climatic change
from warm to colder glacial conditions
that lasted for about 1,000 years.16,18
Although no craters of Younger Dryas
age have yet been found in North
America near the suspected impact re-
gion, as the hypothesis is thoroughly
tested over the next decade, it is likely
that more direct physical evidence of
the cosmic impact will be discovered.

of  many  species  was  very  abrupt  at  the  clay  layer.
Fossils  found  in  rocks  below  the  clay  were  not  in
rocks above the clay. They then asked the question:
“How much time was involved in the deposition of
the  clay  layer?  Was  it  a  few  years,  a  few  thousand
years, or millions of years?”

They  decided  to  try  to  determine  the  timing  of
the  clay  deposition  by  measuring  the  amount  of
iridium  in  the  clay.  Iridium  is  found  in  very  small
concentrations  in  meteorites;  assuming  that  the

rate  of  accumulation  of  small  meteoritic  dust  on
Earth is constant, it would be possible to determine
the  age  of  the  clay  from  its  oldest  to  its  youngest
part by looking at the amount of iridium. What they
found  was  entirely  unexpected.  The  team  antici-
pated measuring approximately 0.1 parts per billion
of  iridium  in  the  clay  layer,  which  they  thought
would represent slow accumulation through time. If
the clay layer was deposited rapidly, the amount of
iridium  would  be  even  less.  What  they  actually

418

CHAPTER 12

Impact of Extraterrestrial Objects

found was about 3 parts per billion—30 times more
than  expected.  Even  3  parts  per  billion  is  a  very
small amount, but it was much more than could be
explained by their previous hypothesis of slow depo-
sition  over  time.  They  reevaluated  the  data.  This
time, they included samples that were removed for
treatment before measurement and got a ﬁnal value
of about 9 parts per billion, which is nearly 100 times
greater than expected. This discovery led them to a
new hypothesis: that the iridium might be the result
of an asteroid impact.

The team’s iridium discovery, along with the hy-
pothesis  that  there  might  be  an  extraterrestrial
cause  for  the  extinction  at  the  K-T  boundary,  was
published  in  1980.11 In  that  paper,  the  team  also
reported elevated concentrations of iridium in deep-
sea sediments in Denmark and New Zealand, all of
which are at the K-T boundary. With the discovery
that the iridium anomaly occurred at several places
around the world, the team became more conﬁdent
of its impact hypothesis; however, it had no crater.
This ushered in a period of research from other sci-
entists,  directed  at  ﬁnding  potential  craters  that

formed 65 million years ago. There was some con-
cern that a crater might have been completely ﬁlled
with sediment and no longer recognizable, or that a
crater was at the bottom of the ocean and may have
been destroyed by plate tectonics. Fortunately, the
site of the crater was identiﬁed in 1991.12

Geologists in Mexico studying the structural geol-
ogy  of  the  Yucatan  Peninsula  discovered  what  they
determined to be a buried impact crater with a diame-
ter of approximately 180 km (110 mi). The crater is
nearly circular, and there is a clear boundary between
unfractured  rocks  within  the  crater  and  fractured
rocks outside the crater. About half of the crater lies
in the Gulf of Mexico and half on the northern end
of  the  Yucatan  Peninsula  (Figure  12.11).  On  land,
the  researchers  found  a  semicircular  pattern  of
sinkholes,  known  to  the  Maya  people  as  cenotes,
that  correspond  directly  to  the  edge  of  the  pro-
posed impact crater. The cenotes range from about
50 to 500 m (164 to 1,640 ft) in diameter and were
presumably formed by chemical weathering of the
limestone  by  water  ﬂowing  through  the  fractured
rock on the outside of the crater boundary. It was

reasoned that the fracturing that created the ring of
cenotes must be related to the circular structure since
there is no other known structure that could explain
the curved pattern of the features. The crater, which
is  now  ﬁlled  with  other  rocks,  is  believed  to  have
been as deep as 30 to 40 km (18 to 25 mi) at the time
of impact. However, subsequent slumping and slid-
ing of materials from the sides soon ﬁlled in much of
the crater, and sedimentation over the past 65 mil-
lion years completely buried the structure.

Drill cores were taken and samples of glassy melt
rock were retrieved from below another massive layer
that was interpreted to be impact breccia within the
proposed  crater.  The  force  of  the  impact  excavated
the crater, fractured the rock on the outside, and pro-
duced the breccia, which is a rock composed of angu-
lar pieces of rocks that have been cemented together.
The glassy melt rock suggests that sufﬁcient heat was
present to actually melt rocks as a result of the im-
pact.13 Another study of the crater found glass mixed
with and overlain by the breccia, as well as evidence
of  shock  metamorphism  commonly  associated  with
impact features.14 The results of these studies of the
Yucatan  Peninsula  crater  (known  as  the  Chicxulub
Crater) are accepted, and it is hypothesized that the
impact from the asteroid that struck the area 65 mil-
lion years ago did in fact cause or signiﬁcantly con-
tribute to the K-T mass extinction.

After identifying the site of the crater and the ev-
idence to support its existence, questions naturally
arose  regarding  how  such  an  event  could  cause  a
global  mass  extinction.15 The  asteroid  that  struck
the  Yucatan  Peninsula  65  million  years  ago  was
huge;  it  is  estimated  to  have  had  a  diameter  of
about 10 km (6 mi). As a comparison, jet airplanes
travel  at  cruising  altitudes  of  about  30,000  ft,
which  is  about  10  km  above  Earth’s  surface.  The
summit of Mt. Everest is not as high as 10 km, but
it’s close. Consider, too, that the asteroid struck the
atmosphere of Earth at a speed of about 30 km/sec
(19 mi/sec), which is about 150 times faster than a
jet airliner travels. The amount of energy released
is estimated to have been about 100 million mega-
tons—roughly 10,000 times as great as the entire
nuclear  arsenal  of  the  world.  The  likely  sequence
of events of the impact and aftermath is shown in
Figure  12.12.  The  hole  blasted  in  Earth’s  crust
was  nearly  200  km  (125  mi)  across  and  40  km 
(25 mi) deep. At an altitude of 10 km (6 mi) in the
upper atmosphere and moving at about 30 km/sec

Mass Extinctions

419

(19 mi/sec), it would have taken less than half a sec-
ond for the collision on Earth to take place, produc-
ing the large crater almost instantaneously. Moving
at  such  high  speed,  the  asteroid  would  have  pene-
trated  the  entire  atmosphere  in  only  a  second  or
two.  When  contact  occurred,  shock  waves  quickly
crushed the rocks beneath, ﬁlling in all the cracks,
partially  melting  the  rocks,  producing  the  breccia,
and  blasting  bits  and  pieces  high  into  the  atmos-
phere. All this probably took about 2 seconds, as the
shock  wave  and  heat  vaporized  rocks  on  the  outer
fringes of the impact. A tremendous amount of de-
bris built up in a huge blanket around the crater. A
gigantic  cloud  of  vaporized  rocks  and  gases  would
have  produced  an  equally  huge  ﬁreball  that  rose,
producing  a  huge  mushroom  cloud.  The  explosion
itself and the rising materials would probably have
been  sufﬁcient  to  accelerate  and  eject  material  far
beyond the surface of Earth. Particles of rock were
blasted  into  ballistic  trajectories  before  they  fell
back  to  the  ground.  The  ﬁreball  would  have  pro-
duced sufﬁcient heat to set ﬁres around the globe.
Vaporization of the limestone bedrock, which con-
tained some sulfur, produced sulfuric acid in the at-
mosphere. Additional acids were added as a result of
burning  nitrogen  in  the  atmosphere.  Thus,  follow-
ing  the  impact,  a  long  period  of  acid  rainfall  likely
occurred. The dust in the atmosphere circled Earth,
and  for  months  there  was  essentially  no  sunlight
reaching the lower atmosphere. The lack of sunlight
stopped  photosynthesis  on  land  and  in  the  ocean,
and  the  acid  rain  was  toxic  to  many  living  things,
particularly  terrestrial  and  shallow  marine  plants
and  animals.  As  a  result,  the  food  chain  virtually
stopped  functioning  because  the  base  of  the  chain
was greatly damaged. The impact occurred partly in
the marine environment and signiﬁcantly disturbed
the  seaﬂoor,  generating  mega  tsunami  that  could
have  reached  heights  of  1  km  (3,000  ft).  These
waves  would  have  raced  across  the  Gulf  of  Mexico
and inundated parts of North America.10

In summary, the impact of the asteroid caused a
global  catastrophic  killing,  which  we  refer  to  as  a
mass  extinction.  While  there  is  some  evidence  that
some species of dinosaurs were dying off before the
impact, this event certainly seems to have been re-
sponsible  for  wiping  out  the  remaining  dinosaurs.
Also,  so  many  other  species  of  animals  and  plants
on  land  and  in  the  oceans  died  that  there  is  little
doubt that a massive impact was the likely cause of

of 10 such events would likely occur in the oceans,
results would be felt worldwide because of the enor-
mous  size  of  the  object.  Certainly  there  would  be
signiﬁcant differences, depending on the site of im-
pact, but the overall consequences would constitute
a  global  catastrophe  with  high  potential  for  mass
extinction.  Such  events  probably  occur  on  Earth
with return periods of tens to hundreds of millions
of years (Figure 12.13). Whether smaller objects on
the order of a few tens of meters produce an aerial
blast or cause an impact crater, they would produce a
regional  catastrophe  if  the  event  occurred  on  land
near  a  populated  area.  The  size  of  the  area  devas-
tated  would  be  on  the  order  of  several  thousand
square kilometers and could cause millions of deaths
if the event occurred over or in an urbanized region.
We  term  these  smaller  but  regionally  signiﬁcant
events “Tunguska-type” events.

A  recent  study  that  evaluated  aerial  blasts  from
asteroids with diameters of about 50 to 100 m sug-
gests that asteroids that are capable of causing cata-
strophic damages to a region occur on average about
every 1,000 years (Figure 12.13). Using the Tunguska
event as a characteristic event with a hit every thou-
sand  years  somewhere  on  Earth,  an  urban  area  is

the extinction. If such an event occurred again, the
loss  of  life  would  be  as  signiﬁcant.  It  might  well
mean  the  extinction  of  humans  and  many  of  the
larger mammals and birds on the planet, leading the
way to yet another pattern of evolution.

What we have learned from the K-T extinction
is sobering. On the other hand, we know that im-
pacts from objects as large as 10 km (6 mi) in di-
ameter  are  very  rare,  occurring  perhaps  every  40
to 100 million years or so. However, large impacts
are not the only hazard from comets, asteroids, and
meteoroids. Smaller impacts are much more proba-
ble, and they can wreak havoc on a region, causing
great loss of life and damage.

Impact of Extraterrestrial Objects

likely to be destroyed every few tens of thousands of
years.  The  dataset  for  this  analysis  comes  from  the
distribution of 300 small asteroids that exploded in
the atmosphere. Extrapolation of the data allows esti-
mates to be made for larger, more damaging events.3
There is tremendous statistical variability in try-
ing to predict the likelihood and type of future im-
pacts, and when such estimates are made, the death
tolls over a typical century may range from zero to
as high as several hundred thousand. Computer-run
simulations suggest that over a given century, there
may  be  approximately  450  deaths  per  year  due  to
impacts.  A  truly  catastrophic  event  could  kill  mil-
lions  of  people.  When  this  is  averaged  over  thou-
sands of years, it results in a relatively high average
annual death toll. For example, if a large urban area
with  10  million  people  is  devastated,  and  such
events  are  thought  to  occur  every  30,000  years,
then the average annual death toll for such an event
is  over  300  people  per  year.  Put  this  way,  the  risk
from  impacts  is  relatively  high.  For  example,  the
probability  that  you  will  be  killed  by  an  impact-
driven  catastrophe  at  the  global  level  is  approxi-
mately 0.01 percent to 0.1 percent. By comparison,
the probability that you will be killed in a car acci-
dent is approximately 0.008 percent and by drown-
ing is 0.001 percent. According to the probabilities,
it appears that the risk of dying from a large impact
or aerial blast from a comet or asteroid is consider-
ably greater than other risks we normally face in life.
However, we emphasize again that the risks related
to impacts are spread out over thousands of years.
Although the average death toll in any one year may
appear high, it is just that—an average. Remember
that such events (and related deaths) actually occur
very infrequently. Certainly there is a risk, but the
time  period  between  events  is  so  long  that  we
shouldn’t  lose  any  sleep  worrying  about  being  in-
volved  in  a  global  catastrophic  event  caused  by  an
extraterrestrial object.

Minimizing the Impact Hazard
Now that we have some inkling of the probability of
an impact of an asteroid or comet, what can we do to
minimize the hazard? First and foremost is to iden-
tify  near-Earth  objects  that  might  threaten  Earth
(see A Closer Look: Near-Earth Objects). Identiﬁca-
tion and categorization of comets and asteroids that
cross Earth’s orbit are already in progress and could

be  scaled  up  to  include  objects  of  different  size
classes,  including  those  with  diameters  less  than
50 m (164 ft), those 50 m to several hundred meters,
and those with a diameter of several kilometers. A
program known as Spacewatch, which has been op-
erating since 1981, is attempting to take inventory
of  the  region  surrounding  Earth  with  expansion
to  the entire solar system. Based on the inventory
to  date,  scientists  believe  that  there  are  around
135,000 objects with a diameter of 100 m (328 ft) or
less that are Earth-crossing asteroids. Another pro-
gram,  known  as  the  NEAT  (Near-Earth  Asteroid
Tracking)  system,  began  in  1996.  The  objective  of
this  program,  which  is  supported  by  the  National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is to
study  the  size  distribution  and  dynamic  processes
associated  with  near-Earth  objects  and  speciﬁcally
to identify those objects with a diameter of about
1 km (3,280 ft). Both observation programs utilize
cameras  and  telescopes.  Images  are  analyzed  to
identify  fast-moving  objects.8 The  programs  and
systems to identify near-Earth objects are expected
to intensify in the future, and more objects will be
cataloged. This is a ﬁrst step toward evaluating the
potential hazard from near-Earth objects. However,
evaluation will take a long time because many of the
objects have orbits that may not bring them close to
Earth for decades, and the average amount of time
between potentially catastrophic impacts is at least
thousands  of  years  for  the  smallest  objects.  The
good news is that most of the objects identiﬁed as
being potentially hazardous to Earth will likely not
collide with our planet until several thousand years
after they have been discovered. Therefore, we will
have  an  extended  period  of  time  to  learn  about  a
particular extraterrestrial object and to attempt to
develop  appropriate  technology  to  minimize  the
hazard.1

By  one  estimate,  there  are  about  20  million  ex-
traterrestrial  bodies  in  near-Earth  orbits  that  have
the potential for a signiﬁcant impact.1 Only about
4 percent  of  these  bodies  are  likely  to  penetrate
Earth’s  atmosphere  and  excavate  a  crater.  Over 
50 percent are structurally weak and are prone to
explode  at  altitudes  of  about  30  km  (18.6  mi)
above  Earth’s surface.  While  these  are  spectacular
explosions, they are not a signiﬁcant hazard at the
surface of Earth. The remaining objects, which con-
stitute about 40 percent of the total population of
objects,  are  moderately  strong  chondritic  asteroids

A 

Closer
Look

Near-Earth Objects

Near-Earth objects (NEOs) are aster-
oids that either reside and orbit be-
tween Earth and the Sun or have
orbits that intersect with Earth’s
orbit. There are literally millions of
meteoroids, but it is the larger ob-
jects such as asteroids and comets
that vary in size from a few tens of
meters to a few kilometers in diame-
ter that are of most signiﬁcance to
our discussion. If a near-Earth object
with a diameter of a few tens of me-
ters were to impact the atmosphere
or surface of Earth, we would experi-
ence a Tunguska-type event. A near-
Earth object of several kilometers in
diameter would cause a global cata-
strophe. As mentioned earlier and
shown in Figure 12.3, the origin of
most asteroids is the asteroid belt, 
located between Mars and Jupiter. If
the asteroids remained there, they
would not become NEOs; however,
their orbits may become disturbed
because of collisions or near misses
with other objects. This may cause
the orbit of one or more bodies to
become more elliptical and cross
into the space between Earth and the
Sun, or even cross the orbit of Earth.
It is estimated that the number of
Earth-crossing asteroids with diame-
ters larger than 100 m (328 ft) is
about 135,000. Larger Earth-crossing
asteroids are more scarce, and it is
estimated that there are about 1,500
with a diameter greater than 1 km
(3,280 ft) and about 20 with a diame-
ter greater than 5 km (3.1 mi).8

Comets are generally a few kilome-
ters in diameter and can be described
as giant snowballs in that they consist
of mixtures of rock and ice (with more
ice than rock by volume). Rock parti-
cles and dust cover the outside. Most

comets are thought to originate far
out in the solar system at a distance
of about 50,000 AU (1 AU is the dis-
tance from the Earth to the Sun, or
about 150 million km [93 million mi])
in a spherical cloud known as the
Oort Cloud. Comets are best known
for the beautiful light they create in
the night sky, which results because
of ice evaporating from the surface,
releasing particles and vapor. The ex-
panding gas and dust produces a
spherical cloud around the comet
that trails behind it, sometimes for
great distances. This release of parti-
cles and gas produces streams of me-
teors that also light up the sky as
showers if they enter Earth’s atmos-
phere. One of the most famous
comets is Halley’s Comet, which is
perhaps the best studied of all
comets because of a 1986 spacecraft
mission to observe it. That expedition

found that the comet is a ﬂuffy,
porous body with very little strength.
In fact, the entire nucleus of Halley’s
Comet is comprised of only about 
20 percent water, and it must there-
fore consist of 80 percent empty
space, which is a network of cracks
and voids and loosely cemented ma-

above Earth approximately once

Near-Earth objects, both asteroids

and comets, apparently have a rela-
tively short lifetime. As a result, there
is a continuous production of these
objects because asteroids are contin-
uously kicked out of the asteroid belt,
some becoming NEOs. Likewise,
comets from the outer solar system
have their orbits perturbed by plan-
ets or other objects to eventually be-
come NEOs as well.

CHAPTER 12

Impact of Extraterrestrial Objects

(Table  12.1).  These  are  relatively  slow-moving  and
can penetrate the atmosphere and produce a serious
threat at the surface of Earth. Such bodies produce
the  Tunguska-type  events.  Identifying  all  of  these
objects will be extremely difﬁcult; there are believed
to be about 10 million of them. With a diameter of
only 25 m (82 ft), they are relatively small objects,
making  them  difﬁcult  to  identify  and  track.1 It  is
impossible for us to identify and catalog 10 million
small asteroids or comets. We are much better pre-
pared to identify and track objects of a few hundred
meters to a kilometer or so in diameter.

Once  it  has  been  determined  that  a  large  near-
Earth object is on a collision path with our planet,
options  available  to  avoid  or  minimize  the  hazard
from  an  aerial  burst  or  crater-forming  event  are
somewhat limited. In the event of a large comet or
asteroid colliding with Earth, there will be no place
in which to escape on the planet. Living things, in-
cluding  people,  within  the  blast  area  will  be  killed
immediately, while those further away are likely to
be killed in the ensuing months from the cold and
the destruction of the food chain. Even if we could
identify  and  intercept  the  object,  blowing  it  apart
into smaller pieces would likely cause more damage
than would one impact from the larger body because
each  of  the  smaller  pieces  would  rain  on  Earth.  A
more thoughtful approach would be to try to gently
divert  the  object  so  that  it  misses  Earth.  Let’s  as-
sume  that  we  identify  a  400  m  (1,300  ft)  asteroid
that  we  believe  will  strike  Earth  approximately

100  years in the future. In all likelihood, the body
has been crossing Earth’s orbit for millions of years
without  an  impact.  If  it  were  possible  to  nudge  it
and change its orbit, it would miss rather than strike
Earth. This is not an unlikely scenario. There is a
99  percent  probability  that  we  would  identify  the
object at least 100 years before impact. We have the
potential technology to change the orbit of a threat-
ening  asteroid  with  small  nuclear  explosions  that
are close enough to the asteroid to nudge it but far
enough away to avoid breaking it up. Accomplishing
this  mission  would  require  cooperation  among  the
world’s  militaries  and  space  agencies.  The  cost  of
such  an  expedition  would  likely  exceed  $1  billion.
However, this seems a small price to pay, consider-
ing  the  potential  damages  from  a  Tunguska-type
event if it were to occur in an urban area.

Another option for smaller events might be evac-
uation. If we could predict precisely where the event
would  occur  months  in  advance,  evacuation  is
theoretically possible.  However,  evacuating  an  area
of  several  thousand  square  kilometers  would  be  a
tremendous, if not impossible, undertaking.1

In  summary,  we  continue  to  catalog  extraterres-
trial objects that intersect Earth’s orbit. We are begin-
ning to think about options to minimize the hazard.
Given the potential long-term warning before an ob-
ject would actually strike the surface of Earth, it is
very possible that we will be able to devise methods
to intercept and minimize the hazard by nudging the
object into a different orbit so that it misses Earth.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About The Tunguska Event 
to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. As the human population of

Earth increases, how will the risk
of a Tunguska event change?
Why?

2. Why is the risk of a future impact

of a kilometer-scale object so
large if such events are very rare?
3. How does the emerging story of
past impacts affect how we think
about the future over a time 

period of tens of thousands 
of years?

4. If the hypothesis that an impact

12,900 years ago signiﬁcantly dis-
rupted Earth ecosystems and
contributed to the mass extinc-
tion of large mammals is true,
does this require us to think 
differently about the future 
of humans?

Summary

Asteroids, meteoroids, and comets are
extraterrestrial objects that may in-
tercept Earth’s orbit. Small objects
may burn up in the atmosphere and
be visible as meteors at night. De-
pending on their size, velocity, and
composition, large objects from a few
meters to 1,000 km may disintegrate
in the upper or lower atmosphere in
an aerial burst or may impact the sur-
face of Earth. Large objects can cause
local to global catastrophic damage,
including mass extinction of life. The
best documented impact occurred 
65 million years ago (K-T boundary),
likely producing the mass extinction

of species, including the dinosaurs,
recorded in the rock record for 
that time.

The risk from extraterrestrial aer-
ial burst or direct impact is a function
of the probability of an event happen-
ing and the consequences if it does
occur. Relatively small events such as
the 1908 Tunguska explosion will
occur somewhere on Earth about
every 1,000 years. Seventy percent
will occur in or over the oceans. A sig-
niﬁcantly larger event would be capa-
ble of causing catastrophic damage to
an urban area. Such events can be 
expected to occur every few tens of

thousands of years. Programs such as
Spacewatch and NEAT (Near-Earth
Asteroid Tracking) will, with high cer-
tainty, identify near-Earth objects of
diameters greater than a few hundred
meters at least 100 years prior to pos-
sible impact. This should allow sufﬁ-
cient time to intercept and divert the
object, using nuclear explosions.
There are about 10 million smaller
objects (potential Tunguska-type ob-
jects) that could produce catastrophic
damage to urban areas. Identifying all
these objects is extremely difﬁcult.
Thus we are particularly vulnerable to
these smaller objects.

millions of years.

3Part 
Resources and Pollution

eople on Earth are absolutely dependent on natural

resources associated with the geologic environment,
including water (Chapters 13 and 14), minerals (Chapter 15),
energy (Chapter 16), and soils (Chapter 17). Our main ob-
jective in Part 3 is to present basic information concerning
our natural resources and to identify potential environ-
mental problems and solutions associated with the use of
resources. Two fundamental certainties come to mind: 
(1) Earth is the only suitable habitat that we have and (2)
our resources are limited. The fact that our resources are
limited is true not only for our mineral resources and fossil
fuels, which are recognized as nonrenewable, but also for
water, trees, and some forms of energy, which are consid-
ered renewable. What is renewable or nonrenewable
depends on the time frame as well as on our pattern of
resource allocation and utilization. Resources we commonly
think of as completely renewable, such as water, are really

not renewable if the resource is spoiled, used unwisely, or
not available when it is needed at a particular location. The
nonrenewable/renewable aspect of water resources is par-
ticularly true for groundwater, which may take tens to hun-
dreds of years to be replaced by natural processes.

It is important to develop mineral resource utilization

and management strategies that will sustain our resources
so that future generations will have their fair share. Thus,
sustainability is the environmental solution, and it is not a
one-size-ﬁts-all situation. That is, the requirement for sus-
tainable water resources is quite different from the require-
ment for sustaining energy resources, minerals, or our soils.
Sustaining nonrenewable resources, such as metals and
oil, is not possible because supplies are ﬁnite. The best we
can do is to conserve and recycle the nonrenewable
resources so they can be used as long as possible and so
future generations will also have these resources.

The western end of
Long Island, part of
New York City, is
the location of
the boroughs of
Brooklyn and
Queens; it is
home to about
4 million peo-
ple (see image
of Long Island
opening this
chapter). An-
other 3 million
people live in
central and
eastern Long 
Island (Nassau
and Suffolk
Counties).
Human popula-
tion of the island
has increased dra-
matically in the
past century. The
population of 
Nassau and Suffolk
Counties in 1920 was
about 0.25 million;
today it is about 3 mil-
lion, a 12-fold increase.
The coastal eastern end

AT L A N T I C
O C E A N

of Long Island in Suffolk
County includes the famous

Hamptons (Figure 13.1), home of

afﬂuent coastal communities, state
parks, and the Montauk Lighthouse
(see the opening case history in
Chapter 11). It is a major tourist area.
Tourism attracts people and requires
seasonal resources. Two important as-
pects of tourism are water supply and
waste management—both topics of
concern to any coastal resort.

The topography, geography, and
groundwater hydrology of Long Is-
land is the result of late Pleistocene

land, New York. (Jupiter Images)

glaciations that were at a maximum
about 20,000 years ago. Materials de-
posited directly by the glaciers or as
the glaciers retreated include abun-
dant, thick sand and gravel that soak
up the rain and store the water be-
neath the surface. The highest hill on
the island, with an elevation of about
122 m (400 ft), is Jayne’s Hill in Suf-
folk County. The hill is part of a low,
linear west-to-east ridge composed of
glacial deposits. The largest lake on
the island is a kettle lake about 1 km
(0.6 mi) wide, known as Ronkonkoma
Lake. The lake (also in Suffolk
County) formed as the glaciers re-
treated, leaving blocks of glacial ice
that formed depressions that eventu-
ally ﬁlled with water.

Water supply and pollution have

been serious problems on the western
end of Long Island since at least the
beginning of the twentieth century,
and people living there depend on
water imported from upstate New
York. Nassau and Suffolk counties in

the central and eastern end of Long 
Island (referred to as Long Island
proper) do not import water; they de-
pend entirely on groundwater. Those
counties carefully monitor their water
resources, yet they are experiencing
water supply and pollution problems.1
Water supply for Nassau and Suf-
folk Counties is a potential problem
because there are several demands for
the resource. Groundwater is needed
for the activities of the 3 million
people who depend on the resource as
their only water supply. Water is also
needed to maintain ecosystems, such
as wetlands, creeks, and ponds.

Groundwater (Figure 13.2) in

Nassau County is a tremendous re-
source, with about 500 public water
systems and 1,500 wells. Despite a
huge quantity of groundwater, inten-
sive pumping in recent years has
caused water levels to decline as
much as 15 m (50 ft) in some areas.
In other words, the groundwater is
being mined. Streams that used to

ter seeping into their channels now
experience less ﬂow or have dried up
and ﬂow only in response to precipi-
tation.2 The decline in water level
has allowed the inﬁltration of salty
groundwater in some locations, a
problem known as salt-water intru-
sion. However, the most serious
water pollution problem in Nassau
County is associated with urbaniza-
tion. There are many sources of pol-
lution, including urban runoff,
household sewage from septic tanks,
salt used to de-ice highways, and in-
dustrial and other solid waste. These
pollutants have a tendency to be

released into surface waters and then
migrate downward to groundwater
resources. It has been noted that the
greatest concentrations of pollutants
are located beneath densely popu-
lated urban areas. Water levels in
these areas have dramatically de-
clined, and nitrates from sources
such as septic tanks and fertilizers
are routinely introduced into the
subsurface environment.1,2 Finally,
landﬁlls containing urban waste have
been of particular concern because
the waste often contains many pollu-
tants that may seep into groundwa-
ter resources. Due to past groundwa-
ter pollution and potential for future

pollution, most landﬁlls on Long Is-
land have been closed.

The ongoing lesson learned from
Long Island’s groundwater problems
is that the need for water resources
goes hand in hand with the threat of
water pollution. Urban areas are often
in need of groundwater resources; at
the same time, urban processes are
likely to pollute these resources. As
human population continues to in-
crease, and more land is developed for
agriculture and urban uses on Long
Island, the linked problems of water
supply and water quality undoubtedly
will increase. Water pollution is dis-
cussed in detail in Chapter 14.

CHAPTER 13

Water Resources

13.1 Water: A Brief Global

Perspective

The global water cycle, or hydrologic cycle, involves
the  movement  or  transfer  of  water  from  one  of
Earth’s  storage  compartments,  such  as  the  ocean,
lakes,  and  the  atmosphere,  to  another.  In  its  sim-
plest form, the water cycle can be viewed as water
moving from the oceans to the atmosphere, falling
from the atmosphere as rain and snow, and then re-
turning to the oceans as surface runoff and subsur-
face flow or to the atmosphere by evaporation. The
cyclic nature of this global movement of water is il-
lustrated  in  Figure  13.3.  The  major  processes  are
evaporation,  precipitation,  transpiration  (loss  of
water by plants to the atmosphere), surface runoff,
and subsurface groundwater ﬂow. These are quanti-
tatively shown in Figure 13.4. The annual volume of
water transferred from the ocean to the land is bal-
anced  by  the  same  volume  returning  by  river  and
groundwater ﬂow to the ocean, and there is a balance

between  total  evaporation  and  precipitation.2 The
water that returns to the ocean is changed because
it carries with it gravel, sand, silt, and clay that has
eroded  from  the  land.  The  return  ﬂow  also  carries
many chemicals. Most of the chemicals are natural;
however,  many  human-made  and  human-induced
compounds are trapped in the return ﬂow, such as
organic waste and nutrients, as well as thousands of
chemicals used in agricultural, industrial, and urban
processes.

Water  is  a  heterogeneous  resource  that  can  be
found in liquid, solid, and gaseous forms on or near
Earth’s  surface.  Water’s  residence  time  may  vary
from  a  few  days  to  many  thousands  of  years,  de-
pending  on  its  speciﬁc  location  (Table  13.1).  Fur-
thermore, more than 99 percent of Earth’s water is
unavailable or unsuitable for beneﬁcial human use,
either because of its salinity, as with seawater, or its
form and location, as is the case with water stored in
ice  caps  and  glaciers.  Thus,  all  people  compete  for
less than 1 percent of Earth’s water supply!

13.2 Surface Water
Surface Runoff and Sediment Yield
Surface  runoff  has  important  effects  on  both  the
transport  of  materials  and  erosion.  Surface  water
can  dislodge  soil  and  rock  particles  on  impact
(Figure  13.5).  Water  can  move  these  materials  ei-
ther in a dissolved state or as suspended particles.
The  number  and  size  of  the  suspended  particles

moved by surface waters depend on the volume and
depth  of  the  water,  as  well  as  the  velocity  of  ﬂow.
The faster a stream or river ﬂows, the larger the par-
ticles it can move, resulting in more material being
transported.  Therefore,  the  factors  that  affect
runoff also affect sediment erosion, transport, and
deposition.

The ﬂow of water on land is divided into water-
sheds. A drainage basin, or watershed, is an area of

FIGURE 13.5 Soil erosion (a) A raindrop falling on soil
causes soil particles to be lifted into the air, initiating the ero-
sion process. Raindrops vary in diameter from about 0.5 mm
to 5 mm (average about 2 mm). They form from condensation
around a particle of dust, smoke or salt. The diameter of the
splash may be several times that of the raindrop. The velocity
of an average raindrop at impact is about 6 m/sec, on  impact
soil particles may be ejected by a large raindrop to a height of
about 1 m and 1.5 m to the side. (Superstock) (b) Surface runoff

land that contributes water to a particular stream or
river.  A  drainage  basin  is  a  basic  unit  of  the  land-
scape. Figure 13.6 shows two side-by-side drainage
basins (A and B) with similar geology. The boundary
between them is called a drainage divide.

Large  drainage  basins  can  be  subdivided  into
smaller  ones.  For  example,  the  Mississippi  River
drainage  basin  drains  about  40  percent  of  the
United States but contains many subbasins, such as
the  Ohio  and  Missouri  basins.  Drainage  basins,
such  as  the  Ohio,  may  be  further  divided  into
smaller basins. Two drops of rain separated by only

scale drainage divide from each side of which river
systems  ﬂow  in  opposite  directions,  may  end  up  a
few  weeks  later  in  different  oceans,  thousands  of
kilometers  apart.  We  may  also  think  of  a  drainage
basin as the land area that contributes its runoff to
a speciﬁc drainage net, which is the set of channels
that makes up a drainage basin. The drainage net in
basin A in Figure 13.6 includes all the channels from
the  small  headwater  streams  at  the  top  of  the
drainage basin to the single large channel at the bot-
tom of the drainage basin. Thus, the term drainage
basin refers  to  an  area  of  land,  whereas  the  term
drainage  net refers  to  the  actual  river  and  stream
channels in the drainage basin.

Factors Affecting Runoff 
and Sediment Yield
The  amount  of  surface-water  runoff  and  sediment
carried  by  the  runoff  varies  signiﬁcantly  among
drainage  basins  and  rivers.  The  variation  results
from  geologic,  topographic,  climatic,  vegetation,
and land-use characteristics of a particular drainage
basin, as well as changes in these factors over time.
Even the most casual observer can see the difference
in the amount of sediment carried by the same river
in ﬂood state and at low ﬂow, since ﬂoodwaters are
usually muddier.

Geologic Factors. The  major  geologic  factors  af-
fecting surface-water runoff and sedimentation in-
clude  rock  and  soil  type,  mineralogy,  degree  of
weathering, and structural characteristics of the soil
and rock. Fine-grained, dense clay soils on shale and
exposed  rock  types  with  few  fractures  generally
allow  little  water  to  move  downward  and  become
part of the subsurface ﬂow. The runoff from precipi-
tation  falling  on  such  materials  is  comparatively
rapid,  and  there  are  usually  many  streams.  Con-
versely, sandy soils on sandstone and well-fractured
rocks  absorb  a  larger  amount  of  precipitation  and
have  less  surface  runoff  and  fewer  streams.  These
principles are illustrated in Figure 13.6. The upper
parts of basins A and B are underlain by shale, and
the lower parts are underlain by sandstone. Because
the shale has a greater potential to produce runoff
than  the  more  porous  sandstone,  the  drainage

density—that  is,  the  length  of  stream  channel  per
unit area—is much greater in the shale areas than in
the  sandstone  areas.  The  drainage  density  for  any
area  of  land  is  determined  by  measuring  the  total
length  of  stream  channel  from  all  streams  in  the
area and dividing this length by the area.

Topographic Factors. Relief refers  to  the  differ-
ence  in  elevation  between  the  highest  and  lowest
points of any landform of interest. The greater the
relief  of  a  drainage  basin,  the  more  likely  the
streams in the basin are to have a steep gradient and
a high percentage of steep, sloping land adjacent to
the channel. Relief and slope are important because
they affect the velocity of water in a stream, the rate
at  which  water  inﬁltrates  the  soil  or  rock,  and  the
rate of overland ﬂow. These characteristics then af-
fect the rate at which surface and subsurface runoff
enters a stream.

Climatic Factors. Climatic factors affecting runoff
and sediment transport include seasonal and annual
to longer patterns of precipitation. In general, pro-
duction  of  large  volumes  of  water  and  sediment  is
associated  with  infrequent  high-magnitude  storms
that occur on steep, unstable topography underlain
by soil and rocks with a high erosion potential.

Vegetation  Factors. Vegetation  can 
inﬂuence
runoff and sediment yield. Vegetation is capable of
affecting streamﬂow in several ways:

• Vegetation may decrease runoff by increasing
the  amount  of  rainfall  intercepted  and  re-
moved by evaporation.

• Decrease or loss of vegetation due to climatic
change, wildﬁre, or land use, such as grazing by
sheep,  will  increase  runoff  or  production  of
sediment or both (Figure 13.7).

• Streamside  vegetation  reduces  stream-bank
erosion  because  its  roots  bind  and  hold  soil
particles in place.

• In  forested  watersheds,  large  woody  debris,
such  as  stems  and  pieces  of  wood,  may  pro-
foundly  affect  the  stream-channel  form  and
processes.  In  steep  mountain  watersheds,
many of the pool environments that are impor-
tant for fish habitats may be produced by large
woody debris (Figure 13.8).

Prairie Creek, California, is responsible for the development of a scour pool important in
providing ﬁsh habitat for the stream ecosystem. Such large woody debris may reside in the
stream channel for centuries. (Charles A. Lauzy)

Land-Use Factors. Agriculture and urban devel-
opment  are  land  uses  that  have  an  effect  on
runoff  and  sediment  yield.  Agriculture  generally
increases  runoff  and  sediment  yield  as  land  is
plowed  for  crops  (see  Chapter  17).  Urbanization,

with  construction  of  streets,  parking  lots,  and
buildings for homes and industry, may also greatly
increase  runoff  because  of  the  large  amount  of
impervious  pavement  covering  the 
land  (see
Chapters 9 and 17).

13.3 Groundwater
The major source of groundwater is pre-
cipitation  that  inﬁltrates  the  surface  of
the land and goes into soil and rock. The
two major zones of groundwater are the
vadose  zone and  the  zone  of  saturation
(Figure 13.9). The vadose zone includes
the Earth material above the water table
which is the boundary between the two
zones, including soil, alluvium, and rock.
The  vadose  zone  is  seldom  saturated.
The  vadose  zone  was  previously  called
the  unsaturated zone,  but  we  now  know
that  some  saturated  areas  may  exist
there at times, as water moves through
after  precipitation  events.  The  vadose
zone has special signiﬁcance because po-
tential pollutants inﬁltrating at the sur-
face  must  percolate  through  the  vadose
zone  before  they  enter  the  saturated
zone below the water table. Thus, during
environmental  subsurface  monitoring,
the vadose zone is an early warning area
for  potential  pollution  to  groundwater
resources.

Water that reaches the zone of satu-
ration begins with inﬁltration from the
surface. Factors that inﬂuence the rate
of inﬁltration include:

main zones of groundwater: vadose zone and zone of saturation. Also shown are
the water table and directions of groundwater movement.

• Topography: With  steeper  topography,  more

water runs off, which reduces inﬁltration.

• Soil and rock type: Soils and rocks with lots of
open space due to fractures or pore spaces be-
tween grains have higher inﬁltration rates.

• Amount and intensity of precipitation: Low-
intensity  precipitation  or  snowmelt  favors
inﬁltration.  High-intensity  precipitation  favors
runoff.

• Vegetation: Leaves  and  stems  intercept  pre-
cipitation. The water then falls more gently to
the ground and inﬁltration increases.

• Land use: Urban lands with pavement or roofs
reduce  inﬁltration.  Agricultural  practices  gen-
erally increase surface runoff and soil erosion,
decreasing  inﬁltration.  Harvesting  of  timber,
particularly  clear-cut  logging,  reduces  vegeta-
tion  cover,  increasing  soil  erosion  and  runoff
while decreasing inﬁltration.

Water that percolates through the vadose zone
will  enter  the  zone  of  saturation,  where  true
groundwater flow occurs. As the name implies, the
Earth material in the zone of saturation has all of
the  spaces  between  grains  in  soil  and  rock  filled
with  water—this  is  the  definition  of  saturated.
The upper surface of the zone of saturation is the
water table.

Aquifers
Earth material capable of supplying groundwater at
a useful rate from a well is called an aquifer (Figure
13.10). Gravel, sand, soils, and fractured sandstone,
as well as granite and metamorphic rocks with high
porosity  from  open  fractures,  are  good  aquifers  if
groundwater is present. A conﬁning layer (such as a
clay or shale layer) restricts or blocks the movement
of groundwater.

water table, in natural systems declines away from the source because of friction in the ﬂow system, but water may still rise above the
surface of the ground if impervious particles, such as clay, create a conﬁning layer and cap the groundwater.

An aquifer is called an unconﬁned aquifer if there
is no conﬁning layer restricting the upper surface of
the  zone  of  saturation  at  the  water  table  (Figure
13.10). If a conﬁning layer is present, the aquifer is
called  a  conﬁned  aquifer;  both  conﬁned  and  uncon-
ﬁned aquifers can be found within the same area. A
perched aquifer is a local zone of saturation above a
regional water table.

The  water  beneath  a  conﬁned  aquifer  may  be
under pressure, forming artesian conditions. Artesian
conditions  are  analogous  in  their  effect  to  a  water
tower  that  produces  water  pressure  for  homes
(Figure 13.11a). Groundwater in an artesian system
(Figure 13.11b) moves downward and laterally. It is
conﬁned and under pressure. The water may rise up-
ward  through  rock  fractures  to  form  an  artesian

spring. The resultant rise may also cre-
ate an artesian well (Figure 13.11b).

inﬁltration,  as, 

In  a  general  sense,  groundwater
recharge is any process that adds water
to  the  aquifer.  Groundwater  recharge
can result from natural processes, most
commonly  precipitation  (Figure  13.10)
inﬁltrating  the  ground.  There  is  also
human-induced 
for
example,  groundwater  recharge  from
leakage and inﬁltration of water from a
broken water line, leakage from a canal,
or  irrigation  of  crops.  Finally,  recharge
may  be  deliberate  through  the  process
of  artiﬁcial  recharge where  surface
water  from  a  river  or  other  source  is
spread on recharge basins to inﬁltrate
into  the  subsurface  to  augment  the
groundwater  resource.  Groundwater
discharge is  any  process  that  removes
groundwater  from  an  aquifer.  Natural
discharge from a spring is an example
of  groundwater  discharge.  A  spring
forms when water ﬂowing in an aquifer
intersects  Earth’s  surface.  Spring  dis-
charge  can  form  the  beginning  of  a
stream or river (Figure 13.12). Ground-
water discharge also occurs when water
is pumped from a well.

When  water  is  pumped  from  a
well, a cone of depression forms in the
water  table  or  artesian  pressure  sur-
face  (Figure  13.13).  A  large  cone  of
depression  can  alter  the  direction  of
groundwater  movement  within  an
area.  Overpumping  an  aquifer  causes  the  water
table  to  drop  deeper  within  Earth.  This  drop  ne-
cessitates  lowering  the  pump  settings  or  drilling
deeper  wells.  These  adjustments  are  often  costly,
and they may not work, depending on the hydro-
logic conditions. For instance, continued deepen-
ing  to  correct  for  overpumping  of  wells  that 
tap  igneous  and  metamorphic  rocks  is  limited.
Water from these wells is pumped from open frac-
ture  systems  that  tend  to  close  or  diminish  in
number and size with increasing depth. Also, the
quality  of  groundwater  may  be  degraded  if  it  is 
extracted from deeper water containing more dis-
solved minerals.

ern end of Yosemite Valley, California. This spring emerges at the base of a hill slope,
as do many other springs. The small stream emerging from the spring pool in a
short cascade or falls is about 2 m (6.6 ft) wide. (Edward A. Keller)

CHAPTER 13

Water Resources

Groundwater Movement
The rate and direction of groundwater movement in
an aquifer in part depend on both the gradient of the
water table, or hydraulic gradient, and the type of ma-
terial  found  in  the  aquifer.  In  general,  the  hydraulic
gradient  for  an  unconﬁned  aquifer  is  approximately
the slope of the water table. The ability of a particular
material to allow water to move through it is called its
hydraulic  conductivity,  which  is  expressed  in  units  of
cubic  meters  (m3)  of  water  per  day  through  a  cross
section of 1 m2—that is, (m3/day/m2), which reduces
to meters per day. Hydraulic conductivity is, in part,
dependent upon the size of the open spaces between
grains in an aquifer and how well they are connected.
The  percentage  of  empty  space,  called  void  space,  in
sediment or rock is called porosity. It varies from 1 per-
cent for granite with few fractures to 50 percent for
clay. Values of porosity and hydraulic conductivity for
selected Earth materials are listed in Table 13.2. No-
tice that some of the most porous materials, such as
clay, have low hydraulic conductivity. Its conductivity
is  low  because  the  spaces  between  clay  particles  are
very small and hold water tenaciously. Sand and gravel
have high porosity, with relatively large openings be-
tween grains and a high hydraulic conductivity. These
relations explain why sand and gravel form aquifers,
and clay forms aquitards. Groundwater moves rapidly
in sands and very slowly in clays. The rate of ﬂow of
groundwater is directly proportional to the product of
the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic conductivity
in  a  famous  equation  known  as  Darcy’s  law.  Using

Darcy’s law to express the quantitative relationship of
hydraulic  gradient  and  hydraulic  conductivity  to
groundwater ﬂow allows us to solve many problems,
such  as  the  rate  of  groundwater  ﬂow  and  how  fast
groundwater is being used or replenished. Darcy’s law
is discussed further in Appendix E, where an example
of groundwater movement is presented.

Groundwater Supply
Nearly half the population of the United States uses
groundwater as a primary source of drinking water.
Therefore,  protecting  groundwater  resources  is  an
environmental problem of particular public concern.
Fortunately, the total amount of groundwater avail-
able  in  the  United  States  is  enormous.  Within  the
contiguous United States, the amount of groundwa-
ter within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of the land surface is esti-
mated  to  be  125,000  to  224,000  km3 (30,000  to
54,000 mi3). Put in perspective, the lower estimate
is  about  equal  to  the  total  ﬂow  of  the  Mississippi
River during the past 200 years. Unfortunately, the
cost of water pumping and exploration reduces the
total quantity of groundwater that is available.3

In  many  parts  of  the  country,  groundwater  with-
drawal from wells exceeds natural inﬂow or recharge. In
such cases, water is being “mined” and can be consid-
ered a nonrenewable resource. Groundwater overdraft
is  a  serious  problem  in  the  Texas–Oklahoma–High
Plains areas, California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico,
and isolated areas of Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas,
and the South Atlantic–Gulf region (Figure 13.14a). In

the  Texas–Oklahoma–High  Plains  area  alone,  the
overdraft is approximately equal to the natural ﬂow of
the Colorado River.4 The Ogallala aquifer, composed
of  water-bearing  sands  and  gravel,  underlies  this  re-
gion from South Dakota  into Texas (Figure 13.14b).
Although the aquifer holds a tremendous amount of
groundwater, it is being used in some areas at a rate
that is up to 20 times that of natural recharge by pre-
cipitation inﬁltration. The water level in many parts of
the aquifer has declined in recent years, and, eventu-
ally, a signiﬁcant portion of land now being irrigated
may return to dry farming if the resource is depleted.
Some towns and cities in the High Plains also have
water  supply  problems.  Along  the  Platt  River  in
northern  Kansas,  groundwater  levels  are  still  high,
and  there  is  enough  water  for  now  (Figure  13.14).
Further south, in southwest Kansas and the panhan-
dle in western Texas where water levels have declined
the  most,  supplies  may  last  only  another  decade  or
so. The situation for urban water in Ulysses, Kansas
(population 6,000), and Lubbock, Texas (population
200,000),  is  becoming  a  problem.  South  of  Ulysses,
Lower Cimerron Springs, which was a famous water
hole along a dry part of the Santa Fe Trail, dried up

decades  ago  due  to  pumping  groundwater,  a  symp-
tom of what was to come. Both Ulysses and Lubbock
are  now  facing  water  shortages  and  will  need  to
spend millions of dollars to ﬁnd alternative sources.
To  date,  only  a  few  percent  of  the  total  U.S.
groundwater  resource  has  been  depleted,  but  water
levels  are  declining  in  parts  of  Kansas,  Oklahoma,
New Mexico, and Texas. As the water table becomes
lower, yields from wells decrease, and energy costs to
pump the water increase. More than half a century of
irrigation in the High Plains area and Ogallala aquifer
has created the water problems seen in these areas.

the limestone is dense, thin bedded, and well jointed
and has an abundance of fractures. A particular type
of topography can result from this type of limestone
that is the result of the diversion of surface waters to
subterranean  routes.  Known  as  karst  topography,
these regions are very common in the United States,
where  approximately  25  percent  of  the  surface  land
area  is  underlain  by  limestone.  The  land  surface  in
karst areas is often dotted with pits formed by chemi-
cal weathering, known as sinkholes, that vary in size
from one to several hundred meters in diameter. Sink-
holes can result from one of two processes: (1) solu-
tional weathering at the surface of the limestone, with
water  diverted  to  subterranean  routes  below  the
sinkhole,  or  (2)  pits  produced  by  collapse  of  surface
material into part of an underground cavern system,
(Figure
forming  spectacular  collapse  sinkholes 
13.16).  The  dissolution  of  limestone  is  a  chemical
weathering process, and limestone is particularly sus-
ceptible to chemical weathering from acids commonly
found in the natural environment (see A Closer Look:
Weathering  in Chapter 3). As solutional pits enlarge
and water moves downward through limestone, a se-
ries  of  caverns  may  be  produced.  The  pockmarked
surface of a karst area resulting from sinkhole devel-
opment often forms a karst plain. The Mitchell Plain
in southern Indiana, shown in Figure 13.17, is an ex-
ample of a karst plain. Because limestone is so abun-
dant, all states in the contiguous United States have
some karst features; Carlsbad Caverns in southeastern
New Mexico is a spectacular example. Major belts of
karst topography in the United States are (1) a region

water inﬁltrates from the lake to groundwater, river
ﬂow receives groundwater seepage, and groundwa-
ter at the coast comes to the surface in wetlands and
seeps into the oceans.

Nearly  all  natural  surface-water  environments,
such  as  rivers,  lakes,  and  wetlands,  as  well  as
human-constructed  water  environments,  such  as
reservoirs,  have  strong  linkages  with  groundwater.
Withdrawal of groundwater by pumping from wells
can reduce streamﬂow, lower lake level, and reduce
water in wetlands. Conversely, withdrawal of surface
water  can  deplete  groundwater  resources.  As  a  re-
sult,  groundwater  management  requires  that  the
linkages between surface water and groundwater be
known and understood.5

Figure 13.10 shows some of the interactions be-
tween surface water and groundwater. In particular,
two  types  of  streams  may  be  deﬁned.  Efﬂuent
streams tend  to  be  perennial—that  is,  to  ﬂow  all
year. During the dry season, groundwater seeps into
the channel, maintaining streamﬂow (Figure 13.10,
right).  Inﬂuent  streams are  often  above  the  water
table everywhere along their channel and ﬂow only
in  direct  response  to  precipitation.  Water  from  in-
ﬂuent  streams  moves  down  through  the  vadose
zone to the water table, forming a recharge mound
(Figure 13.10, left). Inﬂuent streams may be inter-
mittent or ephemeral, in that they ﬂow only part of
the year.

From  an  environmental  standpoint, 

inﬂuent
streams are particularly important because water pol-
lution  in  the  stream  may  move  downward  through
the streambed and eventually pollute the
groundwater  below.  Dry  river  beds  are
particularly  likely  to  experience  this  type
of problem. For example, the Mojave River
in the desert of southern California is dry
most of the time in the vicinity of Barstow.
The river bottom was the site of a railroad
yard  where  trains  and  other  equipment
were cleaned with solvents. These solvents
inﬁltrated down through the vadose zone
and  contaminated  groundwater  used  by
several  communities  for  drinking  and
other municipal purposes.

Karst. Some  of  the  most  interesting  in-
terrelationships  between  surface  water
and groundwater occur in areas underlain
by soluble rocks, such as limestone. Often

Virginia,  Maryland,  and  Pennsylvania;  (2)
south-central Indiana and west-central Ken-
tucky; (3) the Salem–Springﬁeld plateaus of
Missouri;  (4)  central  Texas;  and  (5)  central
Florida.  One  of  the  most  famous  cave  sys-
tems in the United States is Mammoth Cave
in  Kentucky.  Substantial  research  has  been
dedicated to explaining the origin of caverns
and  their  development  through  time.  It  is
clear  that  groundwater  moving  through
rocks is the primary mechanism that forms
caves.  Cavern  systems  tend  to  form  at  or
near the present water table where there is a
continuous  replenishment  of  water  that  is
not saturated with the weathering products
of  the  limestone.  However,  because  many
cavern systems contain a number of levels, it
is  believed  that  each  level  may  represent  a
different  time  of  cave  formation  and,  thus,
may be related to a ﬂuctuating water table.
Fundamentally,  caves  are  enlarged  as
groundwater moves through limestone along
bedding plains or fractures, eventually form-
ing a cavern. Later, if the water table moves
to a lower level, water seeping into the cav-
ern starts to deposit calcium carbonate on the sides,
ﬂoor,  and  ceiling,  forming  the  beautiful  cave  forma-
tions  such  as  ﬂowstone,  stalagmites,  and  stalactites
(Figure 13.18).

From  an  environmental  perspective,  karst
topography  causes  many  problems,  including  the
following:

Column

FIGURE 13.18 Cave formations in Carlsbad Caverns, New
Mexico These formations include stalactites, which hang from the ceiling;
stalagmites, which grow up from the ground; and ﬂowstone, which forms as
water slowly ﬂows down the walls or across an incline. The term stalagmite
has a letter g in it to remind us it forms from the ground up. (Bruce
Roberts/Photo Researchers, Inc.)

• Water  pollution  occurs  where  sinkholes  have
been  used  for  waste  disposal.  The  bottom  of
many  sinkholes  is  near  the  water  table;  this
proximity directly injects water pollutants into
the groundwater system.

• Cavern systems are prone to collapse, produc-
ing  sinkholes  that  may  form  and  damage

buildings  on  the  ground  surface,  roads,  and
other facilities (see Chapter 10).

• In many areas underlain by limestone, such as
the Edwards Plateau in Texas, groundwater is
being mined. As a result of the mining, impor-
tant  karst  springs  where  water  emerges  from
caverns are being changed; the springs are ex-
periencing less discharge or may dry up com-
pletely.  These 
important
ecological consequences because many of these
springs  harbor  forms  of  life  unique  to  the
spring environment. Their loss causes a reduc-
tion in biodiversity and contributes to the in-
creasing  number  of  endangered  species  (see

13.5 Desalination
Desalination of  seawater  occurs  at  about  15,000
plants around the world. The salt content must be
signiﬁcantly reduced for the water to be drinkable,
or potable. Large desalination plants produce water
that  costs  several  times  that  paid  for  traditional
water  supplies.  Because  the  various  processes  that
actually remove the salt require energy, the cost of
the  water  is  tied  to  increasing  energy  costs.  New
technology has greatly reduced the energy require-
ments to desalinate water. As a result, the use
of  desalinated  water  will  certainly  increase,
especially as more traditional sources of water
are stressed.

use of river water for navigation of vessels, hydro-
electric power generation, ﬁsh and wildlife habitats,
and recreation.

Multiple  instream  uses  of  rivers  and  streams
usually  create  controversy  because  each  use  re-
quires  different  conditions  to  prevent  damage  or
detrimental  effects.  Fish  and  wildlife  require  sea-
sonal ﬂuctuations in water levels and ﬂow rates for
maximum  biological  productivity,  and  these  levels
and  rates  differ  from  the  requirements  for  hydro-
electric  power  generation,  which  requires  large
daily  ﬂuctuations  in  discharges  to  match  power
needs. Similarly, both of these may conﬂict with re-
quirements for shipping and boating. The discharge
necessary to move the sediment load in a river may
require  yet  another  pattern  of  ﬂow.  Figure  13.19
illustrates  the  seasonal  patterns  of  discharge  for
some of these uses.

Movement of Water to People
In  our  modern  civilization,  water  is  often  moved
vast distances from areas with abundant rainfall to
areas  of  high  usage.  In  California,  demands  are
made  on  northern  rivers  for  reservoir  systems  to
supply the cities in the southern part of the state.
Two-thirds  of  California’s  runoff  occurs  north  of
San  Francisco,  where  there  is  a  surplus  of  water,

13.6 Water Use
To discuss water use, we must distinguish be-
tween  offstream  uses  and  instream  uses.
Offstream  use is  water  that  is  removed  or
diverted  from  its  source.  Examples  include
water  for  irrigation,  thermoelectric  power
generation,  industrial  processes,  and  public
supply.  Consumptive  use is  a  type  of  off-
stream use in which water does not return to
the stream or groundwater resource immedi-
ately after use. This is the water that evapo-
rates, is incorporated into crops or products,
or is consumed by animals and humans.4,8 In
instream  use,  the  water  that  is  used  is  not
withdrawn from its source. Examples include

discharges for each use. Discharge is the amount of water passing by a
particular location and is measured in cubic meters per second (cms).
The zigzag pattern for hydroelectric use results from rapid (often daily)
change in water released from a dam to produce electric power. Larger
seasonal changes reﬂect winter and summer power demands for heating
and air conditioning. The “ﬂat line” hydrograph is preferred for boat or
barge trafﬁc.

Case History
The Edwards Aquifer, Texas—Water Resource in Conflict

Mark Twain wrote, “Whisky is for
drinking and water is for ﬁghting
over.” In central Texas, the Edwards
aquifer, a karst ﬂow system developed
in limestone, has created an intense
conﬂict over water. The conﬂict has
escalated into nearly open warfare
from a legal, political, and economic
viewpoint.6

The geology of the Edwards aquifer

is interesting. Water that recharges
the aquifer is primarily from stream-
ﬂow over the aquifer, except where it
is conﬁned by layers of clay beds and
shales. The combination of geologic
structures, including folds and a zone
of normal faulting, along with the
karst ﬂow system, results in a com-
plex aquifer with points of natural

discharge at major karst springs
(Figure 13.A). These springs exem-
plify the conﬂicting interest in water
resources. For example, the Barton
Springs Swimming Pool in Austin,
Texas, is supplied by water that dis-
charges from submerged openings in
fractured limestone, visible on the
right bank in Figure 13.B. In addition
to providing important areas for
recreation, Barton Springs is the only
environment for the endangered Bar-
ton Springs salamander. The city of
Austin dramatically illustrates con-
ﬂicts between increasing urbanization
and water resources. How can Texans
continue to maintain a quality envi-
ronment in the face of increasing
water demands from cities such as

Austin and San Antonio? It is clear
that future decisions concerning the
use of the Edwards aquifer and its
abundant water resources will have
signiﬁcant social, economic, and envi-
ronmental ramiﬁcations. In order to
make these decisions, decision mak-
ers will have to conduct an accurate
hydrogeologic evaluation of the entire
aquifer system in order to determine
how its waters may be allocated to the
various users without degrading envi-
ronmental systems.

The Edwards aquifer is one of the

most proliﬁc in North America. It
provides water for more than 2 mil-
lion people, including almost all the
water used by the city of San Antonio
and many smaller municipalities,

surface-water resources remain im-
portant to cities such as Corpus
Christi. However, ﬂows are required
to maintain the ecological integrity
and health of Gulf Coast estuaries in
Texas. This ﬂow is absolutely neces-
sary to maintain habitat in a healthy
estuarine ecosystem.7

Water shortages are not the only

problems threatening the aquifer. For
example, in the Austin area, studies of
Barton Springs suggest that both
groundwater and surface waters in
some places contain a higher-than-
normal concentration of several pol-
lutants, including sediment, hydro-
carbons, pesticides, nitrates, heavy
metals, and bacteria. Examination of
the distribution and levels of these
pollutants relative to local land use
suggest that there is a correspon-
dence between contamination and
those parts of the aquifer where
urban growth and development have
been the greatest.7

Potential solutions to future water
shortages in the Edwards aquifer re-
gion include increasing water sup-
plies, decreasing water demands, and
managing existing water resources
more efﬁciently through measures
such as water conservation. The last
solution seems to be the most likely
approach. Presently, over one-half of
the water use of the aquifer is for
urban supply, and agricultural and
rural supply uses the rest.7 This use
distribution is atypical; agricultural
water demands generally far exceed
urban demands. Water conservation
efforts, including water reuse and
augmentation of spring ﬂow during
droughts, could help alleviate 
water shortages in the Edwards
aquifer region.

The Edwards aquifer is an impor-
tant case history for water resources
management. At the center of the case
is an important natural water resource
in which geologic, hydrologic, biologi-
cal, political, legal, social, and eco-
nomic factors are all playing a role.

industries, and agriculture. Water
yields from a single well in the aquifer
can be incredibly high. A well drilled
in 1991 was one of the world’s largest.
It ﬂowed without pumping with a
natural yield of 25,000 gallons per
minute—enough to ﬁll a good-sized
backyard swimming pool.7

The Edwards aquifer is recharged
primarily through inﬂuent streams
that ﬂow over the recharge zone
where water sinks into the limestone
(Figure 13.A). The recharge is depen-
dent on the duration and volume of
streamﬂows. The rate of pumping
from the aquifer has increased
steadily over the years. Natural
recharge for the most part has ex-
ceeded pumpage and spring ﬂow, two
of the major sources of discharge.
However, due to increased water de-
mand for growing urban areas and for
irrigation, the water needs of the re-
gion now exceed the historical avail-
ability of water. For example, during a
long drought from 1947 to 1956, two
of the largest springs experienced se-
rious reduction in discharge. Comal
Springs ceased to ﬂow for 4 months
in 1956, and the discharge from San
Marcos Springs dropped to a level
that threatened important ecosys-
tems dependent upon water in the

springs.6 Since the drought, several
species have been listed under the En-
dangered Species Act of 1973. The
San Marcos salamander of San Mar-
cos Springs, the fountain darter ﬁsh,
and Texas wild rice have all been cate-
gorized as endangered. As a result of
concern for these endangered species,
a 1991 lawsuit was initiated by the
Sierra Club against the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and other agencies to
ensure adequate ﬂow of the springs in
order to maintain the ecosystems.
The litigation established minimum
streamﬂows required for preservation
of the spring environment. Unfortu-
nately, historical data clearly demon-
strate that spring ﬂows cannot be
maintained during serious droughts,
so the conﬂict will continue. In addi-
tion, increasing population growth
has intensiﬁed water demands, and
there are no potential alternative
water resources that can provide
abundant, high-quality, inexpensive
water when compared with the Ed-
wards aquifer. Potential resolutions to
the water conﬂicts of the Edwards
aquifer are likely to be expensive, not
readily available, and certainly not
agreeable to all parties.

Further complicating matters,

CHAPTER 13

Water Resources

Clearly, the aquifer will continue to be
a source of conﬂict as the various in-
terests sort out the future of the pre-
cious water resources in this part of
Texas. Water managers have predicted
that by the year 2050, the total water
demand in the region may increase by
about 50 percent. However, water

withdrawals necessary to maintain the
ecosystem and health of the environ-
ment are thought to be about 10 per-
cent less than is currently being with-
drawn. Of course, there are natural
ebbs and ﬂows as a result of variable
streamﬂow; discharge from wells may
be greater in some years than others.

However, during droughts, all users of
the water will be stressed. Therefore,
groundwater management plans for
the Edwards aquifer, including how to
quantify water needs for ecosystems,
are being developed with the assump-
tion that deﬁcits in the water supply
will steadily grow over time.

while  two-thirds  of  the  water  use  occurs  south  of
San  Francisco  (mostly  in  the  Los  Angeles  region),
where there is a deﬁcit. In recent years, canals con-
structed  by  both  the  California  Water  Project  and
the Central Valley Project have moved tremendous
amounts of water from the northern to the south-
ern part of the state (Figure 13.20). The diversion
of  waters  has  adversely  affected  ecosystems,  espe-
cially ﬁsheries in some northern California rivers.

Los Angeles is not unique; many other large cities
in  the  world  must  seek  water  from  areas  increas-
ingly farther away. For example, New York City has
imported  water  from  nearby  areas  for  more  than
100 years. Water use and supply in New York City

represent  a  repeating  pattern.  Originally,  local
groundwater,  streams,  and  the  Hudson  River  were
used.  However,  water  needs  exceeded  local  supply;
in  1842,  the  first  large  dam  was  built  more  than
48 km (30 mi) north of the city. As the city expanded
rapidly from Manhattan to Long Island, water needs
again  increased.  The  sandy  aquifers  of  Long  Island
were  at  ﬁrst  a  source  of  drinking  water,  but  this
water  was  removed  faster  than  rainfall  replenished
it.  Local  cesspools  contaminated  the  groundwater,
and  salty  ocean  water  intruded  (see  the  chapter-
opening  case  history).  A  larger  dam  was  built  at
Croton in 1900, but further expansion of the popula-
tion brought repetition of the same pattern: initial

use of groundwater, pollution and exhaustion of the
resource,  followed  by  building  new,  larger  dams  in
forested areas farther upstate. The trend of cities to
import  water  continues.  For  example,  San  Diego,
California, is bargaining with agricultural water dis-
tricts to the east in the Coachella Valley to purchase
water.  Additional  water  sources  are  needed  to  fuel
the city’s development and establish a water supply
independent  of  Los  Angeles,  its  large  neighbor  to
the  north,  from  which  it  currently  receives  water.
Development in urban centers lacking an adequate
local water supply now or in the future is becoming
a  problem  for  many  cities,  including  Atlanta,  New
York, Miami, Chicago, Austin, Denver, Los Angeles,
and  San  Diego.  Perhaps  development  and  popula-
tions of people in such areas should be limited, and
more people should move closer to the water supply.
This  solution  may  be  preferable  from  an  environ-
mental perspective because less water would need to
be transported long distances. More water could be
used locally near its site of origin. Developing areas
near  water  sources  would  allow  more  ﬂexibility  in
water  use,  and  less  water  would  be  lost  through
evaporation  and  seepage  from  aqueducts,  leaving
more water for ecosystems.

Trends in Water Use
Water use on a global basis is about 70 percent for
agriculture, 20 percent for industry, and 10 percent
for  urban  and  rural  homes.  Trends  in  water  with-
drawals  in  the  United  States  (Table  13.3)  provide
insight  that  is  both  interesting  and  necessary  for
managing our water resources. Figure 13.21a (page
451) shows trends in freshwater withdrawals from
1950  through  2005  (the  most  recent  government
data). These data suggest:

• Surface-water withdrawals far exceed ground-

water withdrawals.

• Water  withdrawals  increased  until  1980  and
have since decreased and leveled off. The popula-
tion of the United States was about 151 million
in 1950 and continued to increase, reaching 301
million in 2005. Thus, during the period when
water  withdrawals  decreased  and  leveled  off
(1980–2005),  population  was  increasing.  This
trend  suggests  better  water  management  and
conservation during the 25-year period.8

Water Use

449

Figure  13.21b shows  trends  in  freshwater  and
saline water withdrawals by water-use category from
1960 through 2005. These data show that:

• Irrigation needs and the thermoelectric indus-

try are the primary consumers of water.

• Use of water by the public in both urban and
rural sectors has increased through the period,
a  trend  presumably  related  to  the  increase  in
population of the country.

• The  use  of  water  by  agriculture  for  irrigation
leveled off in 1980 and has slightly decreased
since then. This change presumably is related
to efforts in water conservation.

• Water  used  for  thermoelectric  power  increased
dramatically  from  1960  to  1980,  as  numerous
power  plants  began  operating;  usage  has  since
decreased because of more efﬁcient use of water.
• Since 1980, industry has used signiﬁcantly less
freshwater.  This  decrease  is  due,  in  part,  to
new  technologies  that  require  less  water,  as
well  as  to  improved  plant  efﬁciencies  and  in-
creased water recycling.

There are encouraging indications that the public
is generally more aware of our water resources and
the  need  to  conserve  them.  As  a  result,  water  de-
mands  have  been  reduced  in  many  states.  Another
encouraging sign is that use of reclaimed wastewater
is now much more common, about 1 billion gallons
per  day,  which  is  about  five  times  what  it  was 
50 years ago.8 More signiﬁcantly, the trend is contin-
uing  as  more  innovative  ways  are  found  to  reuse
water,  particularly  reclaimed  wastewater.  Data  for
Figures 13.21a and b are shown in Table 13.3. Notice
that, while water use for irrigation has decreased by
8 percent since 2000, water for thermoelectric power
(although  leveling  off  and  decreasing  slightly  since
about  1980)  still  increased  3  percent.  Since  1950,
water  for  thermoelectric  power  has  increased  by 
5 times, while that for irrigation has increased much
less,  at  about  50  percent.  This  demonstrates  the
tremendous increase in use of thermoelectric power
in the past 60 years.

Water Conservation
What can be done to use water more efﬁciently and
reduce  withdrawal  and  consumption?  Irrigation  is
one  of  the  largest  consumptive  uses,  and  improved

agricultural irrigation could reduce water withdrawals
by between 20 percent and 30 percent. Poor irriga-
tion practices waste a tremendous amount of water.
In some cases, only a small percentage of the irriga-
tion  water  used  actually  goes  to  the  target  plant.

Techniques  to  improve  water  conservation  for
agricultural irrigation include using lined and cov-
ered  canals  that  reduce  seepage  and  evaporation;
computer  monitoring  and  scheduling  of  water
releases  from  canals;  a  more  integrated  use  of

surface waters and groundwaters; night irrigation,
which  reduces  the  amount  of  evaporation;  im-
proved irrigation systems, such as sprinklers and
drip  irrigation;  and  better  land  preparation  for
water application.

Domestic use of water (urban and rural) accounts
for  only  10  percent  of  the  total  national  with-
drawals.  However,  domestic  use  is  concentrated,
and  it  poses  major  local  problems.  Withdrawal  of
water  for  domestic  use  may  be  substantially  re-
duced at a relatively small cost with more efﬁcient
bathroom and sink ﬁxtures, nighttime watering of
lawns and gardens, and drip irrigation systems for
domestic plants.

Water removal for thermoelectricity could be re-
duced as much as 25 to 30 percent by using cooling
towers designed to use less or no water. Manufac-
turing and industry could curb water withdrawals
by  increasing  in-plant  treatment  and  recycling  of
water  or  by  developing  new  equipment  and
processes that require less water. The ﬁeld of water
conservation  is  changing  so  rapidly  that  it  is  ex-
pected  that  a  number  of  innovations  will  reduce
the  total  withdrawals  of  water  despite  increased
consumption.4

Virtual Water: Conservation 
of Water at the Global Scale
Water  resources  of  an  area  or  a  region  are  usually
stated in terms of a drainage basin or groundwater
reservoir that can produce a volume of water over a
speciﬁc  time,  such  as  cubic  meters  or  acre-feet  of
water per year. We can also discuss water resources
on  a  global  scale,  in  terms  of  what  is  known  as
virtual water, deﬁned as the amount of water nec-
essary to produce a product, such as a home appli-
ance or a crop such as wheat.9–11 The virtual water
content is measured at the place where the product
is  produced  or  the  crop  grown,  and  it  is  known  as
“virtual”  because  the  water  content  in  the  product
or crop is very small relative to the amount of water
used to produce the commodity.9

The  amount  of  virtual  water  to  produce  crops
and animals is surprisingly large and variable. For
example, how much water is required to produce a
cup of coffee? The answer to the question is sim-
ple: Coffee is an important crop for many countries
and  the  major  social  drink  in  much  of  the  world.
Many  a  romance  has  started  with  the  question:

Would  you  like  a  cup  of  coffee?  Answering  the
question  as  to  the  volume  of  water  used  to  pro-
duce  a  cup  of  coffee  requires  knowing  how  much
water  is  required  to  produce  the  coffee  berries
(that  contain  the  bean)  and  the  roasted  coffee.
The question is complicated by the fact that water
use to raise coffee varies from location to location,
as  does  the  yield  of  coffee  berries.  Much  of  the
water  in  coffee-growing  areas  is  free,  in  that  it
comes  from  rain.  However,  that  does  not  mean  it
does not have value. It takes about 140 L (40 gal) to
produce one cup of coffee. The amount of water to
produce a ton of a particular crop is variable, from a
low of about 175 m3 for sugarcane to 1,300 m3 for
wheat, 3,400 m3 for white rice, and 21,000 m3 for
roasted  coffee.  For  the  meat  we  eat,  the  amount
per ton is 3,900 m3 for chicken, 4,800 m3 for pork,
and 15,500 m3 for beef.9

The  concept  of  virtual  water  demonstrates  that
people consuming crops in Europe or China directly
inﬂuence  and  impact  the  water  resources  of  the
United States through the products they import. The
United  States  produces  food  products  that  are  ex-
ported around the world with consequences to U.S.
regional  water  supply  and  environmental  concerns,
including depletion of groundwater resources.

The concept of virtual water is useful in water re-
source planning. A country with an arid climate with
restricted  water  resources  can  choose  between  de-
velopment  of  those  resources  for  agriculture  or
other water uses, such as to support wetland ecosys-
tems or a growing human population. For example,
the  average  global  amount  of  water  necessary  to
produce a ton of white rice is about 3,400 m3 (nearly
900,000 gal). Growing rice in countries with abun-
dant  water  resources  makes  sense.  For  countries
with an arid environment, it might be wise to im-
port  rice  and  save  their  water  resources  for  other
purposes.  For  example,  Jordan  imports  about 
7 billion m3 of virtual water per year by importing
those food items requiring a lot of water to produce.
As  a  result,  Jordan  withdraws  only  about  1  billion
m3 of water per year from its limited domestic water
resources.  Egypt,  on  the  other  hand,  has  the  Nile
River and is much less dependent on imported vir-
tual water than is Jordan.9

Water  conservation  at  the  global  level  is  impor-
tant in sustaining our total global water supply. At
present,  the  international  trade  markets  in  virtual
water  reduce  total  global  agricultural  water  use  by

water budgets (balances) for major trades. The bal-
ance is determined by import minus export in cubic
kilometers of virtual water, where 1 km3 is 109 m3
(i.e., 1 billion m3). For example, when Canada (which
has  abundant  water  resources)  exports  wheat  and
other  food  products  to  countries  where  water  re-
sources  are  not  as  abundant,  virtual  water  is  ex-
ported. As  a  result,  countries  that  import  food
products that demand a lot of water to grow them lo-
cally have more water available for domestic drinking
supply,  water  to  produce  manufactured  goods  they
require, and water to support ecosystems.

Using the concept of virtual water has several ad-

vantages:11

efﬁciently,  water  is  conserved,  and  real  water
savings are realized.

• Assisting countries and regions to obtain water
security. Virtual water can be thought of as an
alternative, additional water supply that helps
solve geopolitical problems between nations.

• Knowing the virtual water content of the prod-
ucts we produce and where and how they are
produced  creates  an  increased  awareness  of
what the water demand is and how water sav-
ings might be realized.

13.7 Water Management 

in the Future

• Promoting  efﬁcient  use  of  water  from  a  local
scale to a global scale. Trading of virtual water
can conserve global water resources by produc-
ing products that require a lot of water in places
where water is abundant and can be efﬁciently
used.  When  those  products  are  exported  to
places where water is scarce or difﬁcult to use

Managing  water  resources  is  a  complex  issue  that
will become more difﬁcult as the demand for water
increases  (see  A  Closer  Look:  Management  of  the
Colorado  River).  Although  water  supply  problems
are most serious in the southwestern United States
and other arid and semiarid parts of the world, large

Management of the Colorado River

The Colorado River is the primary
river in the southwestern United
States, and its water is an important
resource. Managing the Colorado
River has two aspects: (1) managing
the water resources for people and
(2) managing the river in the Grand
Canyon to maintain the river envi-
ronment. We will discuss each of
these in turn.

125°

Managing the Water
No discussion of water resources and
water management would be com-
plete without a mention of the
Colorado River basin and the contro-
versy that surrounds the use of its
water. People have been using the
water of the Colorado River
for about 800 years. Early
Native Americans in the
basin had a highly civilized
culture with a sophisticated
water-distribution system.
Many of their early canals
were later cleared of debris
and used by settlers in the
1860s.13 Given this early his-
tory, it is somewhat surpris-
ing to learn that the
Colorado was not complete-
ly explored until 1869, when
John Wesley Powell, who
later became director of the
U.S. Geological Survey, navi-
gated wooden boats
through the Grand Canyon.

35°

Although the waters of

the Colorado River basin are
distributed by canals and
aqueducts to many millions
of urban residents and to
agricultural areas, such as
the Imperial Valley in 
California, the basin itself,
with an area of approximately

632,000 km2 (244,017 mi2), is only
sparsely populated. Yuma, Arizona,
with approximately 42,000 people, is
the largest city on the river, and
within the basin only the cities of Las
Vegas, Phoenix, and Tucson have
more than 50,000 inhabitants. Never-
theless, only about 20 percent of the
total population of the basin is rural.
Vast areas of the basin have ex-
tremely low densities of people, and
in some areas measuring several
thousand square kilometers there are
no permanent residents.13,14 The
headwaters of the Colorado River are
in the Wind River Mountains of 
Wyoming, and in its 2,300 km (1,430
mi) journey to the sea, the river ﬂows

through or abuts seven states—
Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New 
Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and 
California—and Mexico (Figure 13.C).
Although the drainage basin is very
large, encompassing much of the
southwestern United States, the an-
nual ﬂow is only about 3 percent of
that of the Mississippi River and less
than one-tenth that of the Columbia.
Therefore, for its size, the Colorado
River has only a modest ﬂow; how-
ever, it has become one of the most
regulated, controversial, and disputed
bodies of water in the world. Conﬂicts
that have gone on for decades extend
far beyond the Colorado River basin,
involving large urban centers and

developing agricultural areas of 
California, Colorado, New Mexico, and 
Arizona. The need for water in these
semiarid areas has resulted in
overuse of limited supplies and dete-
rioration of water quality. Interstate
agreements, court settlements, and
international pacts have periodically
eased or intensiﬁed tensions among
people who use the waters along the
river. The legacy of laws and court
decisions, along with changing
water-use patterns, continues to in-
ﬂuence the lives and livelihood of
millions of people in both Mexico
and the United States.15

The waters of the Colorado River
have been appropriated among the
various users, including the seven
states and the Republic of Mexico.
This appropriation has occurred
through many years of negotiation,
international treaty, interstate
agreements, contracts, federal legis-
lation, and court decisions. As a
whole, this body of regulation is
known as the Law of the River. Two
of the more important early docu-
ments in this law were the Colorado
River Compact of 1922, which di-
vided water rights in terms of an
upper and a lower basin, and the
treaty with Mexico in 1944, which
promised an annual delivery of 1.85
km3 (1.5 million acre-feet [1 acre-
foot is the volume of water covering
1 acre to a depth of 1 ft], or 325,829
gal) of Colorado River water to Mex-
ico. More recent was a 1963 U.S.
Supreme Court decision involving
Arizona and California. Arizona re-
fused to sign the 1922 compact and
had a long conﬂict with California
concerning the appropriation of
water. The court decided that south-
ern California must relinquish ap-
proximately 0.74 km3 (600,000 acre-
feet) of Colorado River water. Finally,
in 1974, the Colorado River Basin
Salinity Control Act was approved
by Congress. The act authorized pro-
cedures to control adverse salinity of

the Colorado River water, including
construction of desalinization plants
to improve water quality.

Issues of water management in
the Colorado River remain complex
because all the water is spoken for as
demand for more water increases.
The history of water management in
the Colorado illustrates major ques-
tions likely to be faced in other parts
of the Southwest in coming years:
How can we appropriate limited
water resources? and How can we
maintain water quality?

As an example of a complex water

management issue, consider the All
American Canal. The canal is located
along the U.S. side of the border with
Mexico (see Figure 13.20a). The canal
is lined with earth, and, as a result,
water from the Colorado River that
ﬂows through the canal seeps into
the ground. That water is a source of
argument and is developing into a
political water war. A 36 km (23 mi)
section of the canal that delivers
water to San Diego may be lined
with concrete. The objective is to
stop the loss of water that seeps into
the ground from the canal. However,
this will adversely affect Mexican
farmers. Billions of gallons of water
seep into the ground and replenish
groundwater resources that Mexican
farmers have used to irrigate their
ﬁelds for over 60 years. The treaty of
1944 with Mexico doesn’t prohibit
lining the canal, but Mexicans argue
that it is unethical to take water they
have used for decades. The Mexican
farmers say that if they lose the
water, farms will fail, leading to in-
creased illegal immigration into the
United States. Anything that reduces
the opportunities in Mexico may
lead to increased immigration, but
the ethical argument is stronger.
Water used for decades in Mexico,
even though the water was not an-
ticipated when the canal was con-
structed, sets a precedent we need
to honor.

Managing the Colorado River
in the Grand Canyon
The Grand Canyon of the Colorado
River (Figure 13.D) provides a good
example of a river’s adjustment to
the impact of a large dam. In 1963,
the Glen Canyon Dam was built up-
stream from the Grand Canyon
(Figure 13.C). Construction of the
dam drastically altered the pattern of
ﬂow and channel process down-
stream; from a hydrologic viewpoint,
the Colorado River had been tamed.
Before the Glen Canyon Dam was
built, the river reached a maximum
ﬂow in May or June during the
spring snowmelt; then ﬂow receded
during the remainder of the year, ex-
cept for occasional ﬂash ﬂoods
caused by upstream rainstorms.
During periods of high discharge, the
river had a tremendous capacity to
transport sediment (mostly sand and
silt) and vigorously scoured the
channel. The high ﬂoods also moved
large boulders off the rapids, which
formed because of shallowing of the
river where it ﬂows over alluvial fan
or debris ﬂow deposits delivered
from tributary canyons to the main
channel. As the summer low ﬂow ap-
proached, the stream was able to
carry less sediment, so deposition
along the channel formed large bars
and terraces, known as beaches to
people who rafted the river.

After the dam was built, the mean

annual ﬂood (the average of the
highest ﬂow each year) was reduced
by about 66 percent, and the 10 year
ﬂood was reduced by about 75 per-
cent. On the other hand, the dam did
control the ﬂow of water to such an
extent that the median discharge ac-
tually increased about 66 percent.
The ﬂow is highly unstable, however,
because of ﬂuctuating needs to gen-
erate power, and the level of the river
may vary by as much as 5 m (16 ft) per
day. The dam and reservoir trap sedi-
ment from moving downstream,
greatly reducing sediment load of

456

was a belt of widely spaced brittle
brush and barrel cactus.17 Closing
the dam in 1963 tamed the spring
ﬂoods for 20 years, and plants not
formerly found in the canyon, includ-
ing tamarisk (i.e., salt cedar) and in-
digenous willow, became established
in a new belt along the riverbanks.
In June 1983, a record snowmelt

in the Rocky Mountains forced the re-
lease of about three times the
amount of water normally released
and about the same amount as an
average spring ﬂood before the dam.
The resulting ﬂood scoured the
riverbed and riverbanks, releasing
stored sediment that replenished the
sediment on sandbars and scoured
out or broke off some of the tamarisk
and willow stands. The effect of the
large release of water was beneﬁcial
to the river environment and empha-
sizes the importance of the larger
ﬂoods in maintaining the system in a
more natural state. Later, as an exper-
iment, between March 26 and April 2,
1996, a “test ﬂood” was released from
the dam in order to redistribute the
sand supply. The ﬂoods resulted in
the formation of 55 new beaches and
added sand to 75 percent of the ex-
isting beaches. It also helped rejuve-
nate marshes and backwaters, which
are important habitats to native ﬁsh
and some endangered species. Water
released from the dam is cold, and a
trophy trout ﬁshery has been estab-
lished. Native ﬁsh that prefer warmer
water, including large (up to 6 ft
long) squaw ﬁsh, are threatened with
extinction due to habitat transforma-
tion and introduction of the trout.
The experimental ﬂood was hailed a
success,18 although a signiﬁcant part
of the new sand deposits was subse-
quently eroded away.19

The 1996 test ﬂood remobilized
sand, scouring it from the channel
bottom and banks of the Colorado
River below Glen Canyon Dam and
depositing it on sandbars. However,

FIGURE 13.D The Colorado River in the Grand
Canyon The sandbar “beach” is being used by river rafters
whose numbers have increased and affect the canyon. The 
number of people allowed to raft through the canyon is now 
restricted. (Craig Lovell/Eagle Visions Photography/Alamy)

the river immediately downstream
from the dam. As a result, some of
the large sandbars, which are valu-
able habitat, are starved of sand and
are eroding. A lesser reduction in
sediment load occurred farther
downstream because tributary chan-
nels continued to add sediment to
the channel.16

The change in hydrology of the

Colorado River in the Grand Canyon
has greatly changed the river’s mor-
phology. The rapids may be becom-
ing more dangerous because large
ﬂoods that had previously moved

some of the large boulders farther
downstream no longer occur.

Changes in the river ﬂow, mainly
deleting the high ﬂows, have also re-
sulted in vegetational shifts. Before
the dam was built, three nearly paral-
lel belts of vegetation were present
on the slopes above the river. Adja-
cent to the river and on sandbars
grew ephemeral plants, which were
scoured out by yearly spring ﬂoods.
Above the high-water line were
clumps of thorned trees (e.g.,
mesquite, catclaw acacia) mixed with
cactus and Apache plume. Higher yet

Water Management in the Future

457

Evaluation of the hydrology of the 
Little Colorado River suggests that the
opportunity to replenish sand on the
beaches occurs, on average, once in 
8 years. The proposed plan would
help restore or re-create river ﬂow and
sediment transport conditions that
formed and maintained the natural
ecosystems of the canyon to be more
as they were before the construction
of Glen Canyon Dam.19

Another impact of the Glen

Canyon Dam is the increase in the
number of people rafting through
the Grand Canyon. Although rafting
is now limited to 15,000 people an-
nually, the long-range impact on
canyon resources is bound to be ap-
preciable. Before 1950, fewer than

100 explorers and river runners had
made the trip through the canyon.

We must concede that the

Colorado River of the 1970s and
1980s is a changed river. Despite the
1983 and 1996 ﬂoods that pushed
back some of the changes, river
restoration efforts cannot be ex-
pected to return it to what it was be-
fore construction of the dam.16,17,19
On the other hand, better manage-
ment of the ﬂows and sediment
transport will improve and better
maintain river ecosystems.

Finally, as a result of upstream

water use, the delta of the Colorado
River, once a major wetland, has
been degraded. Some years, no ﬂow
reaches the sea.

FIGURE 13.E The Little Colorado River The Little Colorado
River channel has abundant sand to help maintain sandbar
“beaches” in the Colorado River. (Edward A. Keller)

little new sand was added to the river
system from tributaries to the
Colorado River because they were
not in ﬂood ﬂow during the test
ﬂood. The sand was mined from the
river below the dam; as such, it is a
limited, nonrenewable source that
cannot supply sand to sandbars on a
sustainable basis. A new, creative
idea has recently been suggested.19
The plan is to use the sand delivered
to the Grand Canyon by the Little
Colorado River, a relatively large river
with a drainage area of 67,340 km2
(26,000 mi2) (Figure 13.C), which joins
the Colorado River in the canyon
downstream from Lee’s Ferry. In 1993,
a ﬂood on the Little Colorado River
delivered a large volume of sand to
the Colorado River in the Grand
Canyon, and prominent beaches were
produced. Unfortunately, a year later,
the beaches had been almost entirely
eroded away by the ﬂow of the
Colorado River. The problem was that
the beaches were not deposited high
enough above the bed of the
Colorado and so were vulnerable to
erosion from normal postdam ﬂows.
The idea suggested in the new study
is to time the releases of ﬂood ﬂows
from Glen Canyon Dam with sand-rich
spring ﬂoods of the Little Colorado
River. The resulting combined ﬂood of
the two rivers would be larger, and
the new sand from the Little Colorado
(Figure 13.E) would be deposited
higher above the channel bed and
would be less likely to be removed 
by lower ﬂows of the Colorado. 

Atlanta,  also  face  problems.  However,  there  are  op-
tions available, including locating alternative supplies,
better  protecting  and  managing  existing  supplies,
and controlling population growth.

Cities  in  need  of  water  are  beginning  to  treat
water as a commodity, similar to oil or gas, that can
be bought and sold on the open market. If cities are
willing  to  pay  for  water  and  are  allowed  to  avoid

current  water  regulation,  then  allocation  and  pric-
ing, as they are now known, will change. If the cost
rises enough, “new water” from a variety of sources
may  become  available.  For  example,  irrigation  dis-
tricts in agricultural areas may contract with cities
to  supply  water  to  urban  areas.  This  arrangement
could be done without negatively affecting crops by
using  conservation  measures  to  minimize  present

458

CHAPTER 13

Water Resources

water  loss  through  evaporation  and  seepage  from
unlined  canals.  Currently,  most  irrigation  districts
do not have the capital to ﬁnance expensive conser-
vation methods, but cities in need of water could ﬁ-
nance  such  projects.  Clearly,  water  will  become
much more expensive in the future, and, if the price
is right, many innovative programs are possible.

Luna Leopold, a leader in the study of rivers and
water resources, has suggested a new philosophy of
water management. This new philosophy is based
on geologic, geographic, and climatic factors, as well
as on the traditional economic, social, and political
factors. The management of water resources cannot
be  successful  as  long  as  it  is  naively  perceived  pri-
marily  from  an  economic  and  political  standpoint.
The term water use is more appropriate because we
seldom  really  manage  water.12 The  essence  of
Leopold’s water management philosophy is that sur-
face water and groundwater are both subject to nat-
ural ﬂux. In wet years, surface water is plentiful, and
the near-surface groundwater resources are replen-
ished. During these years, we hope that our ﬂood-
control  structures,  bridges,  and  storm  drains  will
withstand the excess water. These structures are de-
signed to withstand a particular ﬂow; exceeding that
ﬂow  may  cause  damage  or  ﬂooding.  Leopold  con-
cludes that we are much better prepared to handle
ﬂoods than water deﬁciencies. Speciﬁc strategies to
minimize  hardships  must  be  in  place  to  combat
water  deﬁciencies  during  the  dry  years.  For  exam-
ple,  subsurface  waters  in  various  locations  in  the
western United States are either too deep to be eco-
nomically extracted or have marginal water quality.
Furthermore, these waters may be isolated from the
present hydrologic cycle and, therefore, may not be
subject  to  natural  recharge.  However,  water  from
these  sources  could  be  available  if  plans  were  in
place for drilling wells and connecting them to exist-
ing water lines. Treatment of wastewater for reuse
could also be an option in an emergency. Reuse of
water on a regular basis might be too expensive or
objectionable  for  other  reasons,  but  advance  plan-
ning  to  reuse  more  treated  water  during  emergen-
cies might be wise.12

In  wet  years,  groundwater  is  naturally  replen-
ished. Surface water should be used when it is avail-
able,  and  groundwater  should  be  reserved  for  dry
years.  In  other  words,  groundwater  could  be
pumped out at a rate exceeding the replenishment
rate in dry years and would be replenished by nat-

ural  discharge  and  artiﬁcial  recharge  during  wet
years. This water management plan recognizes that
excesses  and  deﬁciencies  in  water  are  natural  and
can be planned for.

13.8 Water and Ecosystems
The major ecosystems of the world have evolved in
response to physical conditions that include climate,
nutrient  input,  soils,  and  hydrology.  Changes  in
these  factors  affect  ecosystems; 
in  particular,
human-induced  changes  may  have  far-reaching  ef-
fects.  Throughout  the  world,  with  few  exceptions,
people are degrading natural ecosystems. Hydrologic
conditions, particularly surface-water processes and
quality,  are  becoming  factors  that  limit  the  contin-
ued existence of some ecosystems, particularly wet-
lands 20 (see A Closer Look: Wetlands).

Water  resources  development,  such  as  construc-
tion of dams, reservoirs, canals, or aqueducts, have
a  variety  of  environmental  impacts  at  a  variety  of
scales. Dams and accompanying reservoirs are often
designed to be multifunctional, providing water for
agriculture, a mechanism for ﬂood control, and sites
for recreational activities. Reconciling these various
uses  at  a  given  reservoir  site  is  often  difﬁcult.  For
example,  water  demands  for  agriculture  are  gener-
ally high during the summer, resulting in lowering
of the water level in the reservoir and production of
extensive  mudﬂats.  People  interested  in  recreation
ﬁnd the low water level and mudﬂats to be aestheti-
cally  displeasing;  moreover,  the  effects  of  the  high
water demand and drawdown of the reservoir water
may interfere with wildlife by damaging or limiting
a ﬁsh’s spawning opportunities. (See the discussion
of dams and reservoirs with water power in Chapter
16.) Dams and reservoirs also tend to instill a false
sense  of  security  in  persons  living  downstream  of
the  facilities,  who  believe  they  are  protected  from
ﬂoods.  However,  four  major  environmental  effects
of dams are:

• Land, with its cultural and biological resources,

is lost in the area ﬂooded by the reservoir.

• Ecosystems  are  fragmented,  as  migrating  ﬁsh
are blocked from moving upstream of the dam.
In the reservoir, hilltop areas with adjacent val-
leys  are  transformed  to  more  isolated  islands.
• The  reservoir  traps  sediment  that  is  trans-
ported  from  upstream  by  the  rivers  and

A 

Closer 
Look

Wetlands

The term wetlands21 refers to a vari-
ety of landscape features, such as:
• Swamps: Wetland that is frequently
or continuously inundated by water
• Marshes: Wetland that is frequently
or continuously inundated by water
• Bogs: Wetland that accumulates

peat deposits

• Prairie potholes: Small marshlike

ponds

• Vernal pools: Shallow depressions

that occasionally (often season-
ally) hold water

Some of these features are shown
in Figure 13.F. The common feature
and operational deﬁnition of wet-

lands is that they are either inundated
by water or the land is saturated to a
depth of a few centimeters for at least
a few days most years. Hydrology, or
wetness, and the types of vegetation
and soil determine the presence or
absence of wetlands. Of these three
factors, hydrology is often the most
difﬁcult to deﬁne because some wet-

lands are wet for only a very short pe-
riod each year. However, the presence
of water, even for short periods on a
regular basis, does give rise to charac-
teristic wetland soils and specially
adapted vegetation. Recognition of
wetland soils and vegetation greatly
assists in identifying the wetland itself
in many cases.22,23

Wetlands and their associated

ecosystems have many important en-
vironmental features:
• Coastal wetlands such as salt

marshes provide a buffer for in-
land areas from coastal erosion
and ﬂooding associated with
storms or tsunami.

• Wetlands are one of nature’s nat-
ural ﬁlters. Plants in wetlands may
effectively trap sediment, nutri-
ents, and pollutants.

• Freshwater wetlands are a natural
sponge. During ﬂoods, they store

water, helping to reduce down-
stream ﬂooding. The stored 
water is slowly released after the
ﬂood, nourishing low ﬂows of
river systems.

• Wetlands are often highly 

productive lands where many 
nutrients and chemicals are natu-
rally cycled while providing habi-
tat for a wide variety of plants 
and animals.

• Freshwater wetlands are often

areas of groundwater recharge to
aquifers. Some of them, a spring-
fed marsh, for example, are points
of groundwater discharge.

Although most coastal marshes

are now protected in the United
States, freshwater wetlands are still
threatened in many areas. It is esti-
mated that 1 percent of the nation’s
total wetlands is lost every 2 years.

Freshwater wetlands account for
nearly all of this loss. In just the past
200 years, about half of the total wet-
lands in the United States, including
about 90 percent of the freshwater
wetlands, have disappeared as a re-
sult of being drained for agricultural
purposes or urban development.

The damage and degradation of

wetlands have led to a growing 
effort to restore them. Unfortunately,
restoration is not usually an easy 
task, since wetlands are a result of
complex hydrologic conditions 
that may be difﬁcult to restore if the
water has been depleted or is being
used for other purposes. Researchers
are carefully documenting the hy-
drology of wetlands as well as the
movement of sediment and nutri-
ents. As more information is 
gathered concerning how wetlands
work, restoration is likely to be 
more successful.

streams that enter the reservoir. The trapped
sediment reduces the water-storage capacity of
the reservoir. More signiﬁcantly, the reservoir
holds sediment that would normally be trans-
ported  downstream,  nourishing  the  river  and
coastal  environment.  When  rivers  and  coasts
are deprived of sediment, river erosion occurs
downstream  of  dams,  and  coastal  erosion  oc-
curs on beaches.

• The  downstream  hydrology  and  sediment
transport system change the entire river envi-
ronment,  affecting  the  organisms  that  live
there (see A Closer Look: Management of the
Colorado River).

13.9 Emerging Global 
Water Shortages

Only recently have we realized that isolated short-
ages of water are an indication of a global pattern of
a resource being depleted.24 Around Earth, ground-

water is being depleted, mined from aquifers mostly
used for agriculture; large lakes are drying up, such as
the Aral Sea mentioned in Chapter 1; and some large
rivers,  including  the  Colorado  in  the  United  States
and the Yellow in China, run dry in some years and
don’t reach the sea, while others, such as the Nile in
Africa, have seen their discharge to the sea reduced
by over 90 percent. Water demand in the past 50 years
has tripled as grain (wheat) production to feed people
has tripled. During the same 50 years, human popu-
lation  more  than  doubled.  In  the  next  50  years,
human population is expected to increase another
2  to  3  billion,  and  there  is  concern  that,  without
very careful management of water resources, there
won’t be enough water to grow the food for the ex-
pected  8  to  9  billion  people  in  2050.  Thus,  we  see
that the emerging water shortage is linked to a po-
tential  food  shortage.  The  problem  is  that  the
tremendous  increase  in  grain  production  has  been
dependent on irrigation water, mostly from ground-
water  resources.  These  same  resources  are  being

depleted nearly everywhere grain is grown—for ex-
ample, the United States, China, India, Pakistan, and
Mexico.24 As  water  shortages  occur,  food  shortages
will follow. The solution is clear: Control human pop-
ulation growth and conserve water. This chapter has

outlined a number of ways to conserve our water re-
sources through using less and reclaiming more. To
avoid a food crisis, more needs to be done. The good
news is that a solution is possible, but it will take a
lot of proactive work.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About Long Island to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. What are the impacts of popula-

tion increase and tourism in
Long Island on water supply 
and quality?

2. Is sustainable water manage-

ment possible on Long island? If

you think it is, what should be
done? If you think it is not sus-
tainable, what needs to be done?
3. How do science and values link to
future planning to manage water
resources on Long Island?

Summary

The global water cycle involves the
movement, storage, and transfer of
water from one part of the cycle to
another. The movement of water on
land—that is, surface runoff and sub-
surface ﬂow—is the part of the cycle
of most direct concern to people.

Drainage basins, or watersheds,

are a basic unit of the landscape. 
Surface-water runoff varies greatly
from one drainage basin to another
and is inﬂuenced by geographic, cli-
matic, and biological factors.

The major source of groundwater

is precipitation that inﬁltrates the
recharge zone on the land surface and
moves down through the vadose
zone, which is seldom saturated, to
the zone of saturation. An aquifer is a
zone of Earth material capable of sup-
plying water at a useful rate from a
well. Interactions and linkages be-
tween surface water and groundwater
are important environmentally be-
cause pollution in surface water may

eventually contaminate the ground-
water. Karst areas are particularly vul-
nerable to pollution.

Water supply is limited, even in

areas of high precipitation and
runoff, by our inability to store all
runoff and by the large annual varia-
tion in streamflows. In many areas,
groundwater is being mined, result-
ing in withdrawals that exceed nat-
ural replenishment. In some areas,
mining of groundwater has perma-
nently changed the character of 
the land.

Water uses are categorized as off-
stream, including consumptive, and
instream. Multiple instream uses for
hydroelectric power, recreation, and
ﬁsh and wildlife habitat often have
conﬂicting requirements; partition-
ing water resources to meet the 
various uses is a controversial 
subject.

Water conservation is an impor-

tant objective if Earth’s water re-

sources are to be sustained.The con-
cept of virtual water can help pro-
mote efﬁcient water use from the
local to the global scale.

Water resource management needs
a new philosophy that considers geo-
logic, geographic, and climatic factors
and utilizes creative alternatives.

Water is an integral part of ecosys-
tems, and its increasing use by people
is a major contributor to the degrada-
tion of ecosystems. Loss of or damage
to wetlands is an area of particular
environmental concern in the United
States because a signiﬁcant portion of
these ecosystems has already been
lost, including 90 percent of the
freshwater wetlands.

We are facing a global water
shortage linked to food supply.
Proactive water management is
needed to produce an adequate food
supply in the next 50 years as
human population grows by 2 to 
3 billion new people.

CHAPTER 13

Water Resources

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
There is plenty of water on Earth for
our present population. However, it is
not uncommon to have water short-
ages because people tend to reside in
areas where water resources are lim-
ited. Population centers do not coin-
cide with places where the most fresh-
water is available. As a result, as
human population continues to grow,
water shortages will become more ap-
parent, particularly in the more arid
parts of the world. It is expected that,
during the twenty-ﬁrst century, very
serious water shortages will result in
some regions, and these are likely to
lead to conﬂicts between nations.
Sustainability One way to avoid
water shortages in the future is to en-
sure that we sustain our present
sources. Sustainability means that we
will leave to future generations water
resources that have not been de-
graded by human processes. We also
wish to ensure that the ecosystems of
the world have enough water to re-
main healthy in the future. Therefore,
development of sustainable water
management is of prime concern to
persons responsible for managing our
water resources. Aspects of the sus-
tainable water management program

will include more efﬁcient use of pre-
sent water resources, water conserva-
tion, and protection of drainage
basins so that they will continue to
yield high-quality surface water and
groundwater.
Earth as a System Our water re-
sources at the global, regional, and
local levels are maintained by complex
hydrologic systems that involve inter-
actions between surface water and
groundwater, both of which are sub-
ject to change over a variety of time
scales, from several years to several
hundred years or longer. As a result,
in order to effectively manage water
resources, we must understand vari-
ous parts of the hydrologic system,
including climate, geology, and land
use. Human change that causes diver-
sion of water from rivers and streams
will likely degrade the ecosystems
that the water nourished. As a result,
to effectively use our water resources,
we must pay close attention to how
biological systems interact with the
hydrologic system.

Hazardous Earth Processes,
Risk Assessment, and Percep-
tion There are signiﬁcant risks and
hazards associated with water short-

ages. For example, much of the food
we consume is produced by irrigated
lands, and our water resources are
generally managed to provide sufﬁ-
cient water over a period of years. Use
of water resources affects several nat-
ural hazards, the foremost of which is
ﬂooding, which is the most univer-
sally experienced natural hazard.

Scientific Knowledge 
and Values The science of the
water cycle and how it interacts with
biological systems is a mature sci-
ence. We have painstakingly learned
how to utilize water for the benefit
of people. However, we also recog-
nize that other living things need
water, too. To support ecosystems
that require water resources, such as
wetlands, we need to examine how
we value the world around us. When
we build a dam or overuse an
aquifer, we change the hydrologic
conditions and the life that depends
upon water resources. Thus, we face
a value judgment as to whether we
wish to develop more water re-
sources or to better protect ecosys-
tems that are dependent upon the
water, such as the unique organisms
in the large springs that discharge
from the Edwards aquifer.

Water Pollution

Learning Objectives
In Chapter 13, we learned that the utilization of our water resources often goes hand in hand with
the threat of water pollution. For example, we learned that the urban land use of Long Island,
New York, has resulted in groundwater pollution. However, by far the most serious water

resource problem is the lack of a pollution-free water supply for billions of people in many

regions of the world. In this chapter, we will focus on the following learning objectives:

• Know the basic

principles of water
pollution

• Be familiar with the

common water
pollutants

• Understand why lack of

clean, disease free
drinking water is the
most serious water
quality problem facing
the world today

• Understand the methods

for treating water
pollution

• Understand the

important processes
related to wastewater
treatment and

CHAPTER 14

Case History
North Carolina’s Bay of Pigs

Hurricane Floyd drove through
the heart of North Carolina’s pig
country in September 1999. The
hurricane killed nearly 50 people,
flooded thousands of homes,
forced 48,000 people into shel-
ters, and destroyed 5.7 million
hectares (2.3 million acres) of
crops. The storm produced up

to 50 cm (20 in.) of rain in

the eastern part of the

state, flooding an area

barely beginning to re-
cover from Hurricane
Dennis, which had

struck just 
2 weeks earlier.1
A water pol-

lution cata-
strophe oc-
curred as a
result of
the flood-
waters
from
Hurri-
cane
Floyd.
How-
ever,
it was
a pre-
ventable
catastrophe
that environmentalists had antici-
pated. Although North Carolina has
a long history of hog production,
the population of pigs swelled from
about 2 million in 1990 to about 
10 million by 2010, making North
Carolina the second-largest pig-
farming region in the nation
(Figure 14.1). In the early 1990s,
the state allowed large commercial
pig farms to expand. Large auto-
mated confining farms were built to
house hundreds or thousands of
pigs. North Carolina did not impose

restrictions on their locations, and
many of these “factory farms” were
constructed on ﬂoodplains or re-
claimed wetlands. Each pig produces
approximately 2 tons of waste a year,
so the North Carolina pigs were
putting out approximately 20 million
tons of waste a year. Waste consisting
of manure and urine was ﬂushed out
of the farms into 4 m (13 ft) deep,
unlined lagoons the size of football
ﬁelds. The only waste treatment in
these lagoons was natural bacterial
decay. The farmers argued that, after
the waste was degraded in the la-
goons, the liquid could be sprayed
onto crops as fertilizer. In reality,
however, few crops were grown in the
area; in addition, heavy rains some-
times caused the ponds to overﬂow
and run into rivers. No precautions
were taken for the ﬂood hazard, and,
as a result, large parts of eastern
North Carolina became cesspools
with lagoons. An early warning came
in June 1995; the citizens of Onslow
County, on North Carolina’s coastal
plain, were rudely awakened by a very
unpleasant sight. A pig-waste holding
lagoon had collapsed, sending ap-
proximately 95 million L (25 million
gal) of concentrated pig feces and
urine across a road and over ﬁelds
into the New River. During the next

24 hours or so, the noxious mass of
waste traveled approximately 35 km
(22 mi) down the river, slowing up
near the city of Jacksonville. Some of
the waste found its way into the New
River estuary, where its adverse effects
on marine life lasted approximately 3
months. Researchers investigating
this spill in the New River found
numerous carcasses of ﬁsh littering
the bank and hanging in stream-side
brush. The water had turned murky
brown and produced a nauseating
stench.2

The favorable regulatory climate

and availability of inexpensive waste-
disposal systems were responsible
for the phenomenal growth in the
North Carolina pig population in the
1990s. Most of the factory-style ani-
mal operations are located in the
lower Cape Fear and New River wa-
tersheds (Figure 14.1). The concen-
tration of pig farms in this area has
transformed the region into a
natural laboratory for examining the
impact of industrial-scale animal
production and its waste products on
river and estuarian systems. When
Hurricane Floyd struck in 1999, more
than 38 pig lagoons washed out, and
perhaps as much as 95,000 m3
(250 million gal) of pig waste was
dumped into creeks, rivers, and

wetlands (Figure 14.2). After the
hurricane, approximately 250 pig op-
erations were ﬂooded out or had over-
ﬂowing lagoons. Many of the ﬂooded
lagoons were upriver from towns that
ﬂooded, and the waste moved with
the ﬂoodwater through schools,
churches, homes, and businesses.
People along the rivers reported that
the stench was overwhelming. The
state Department of Agriculture 
estimated that approximately

30,000 hogs, 2 million chickens, and
735,000 turkeys had died. Most of the
poultry carcasses were piled up and left
to rot. Mobile incinerators that were
moved to the area to burn ﬂoating hog
carcasses were overwhelmed, leaving
the farmers to bury the animals in
shallow pits (Figure 14.3). The pits
were supposed to be dry and at least
1 m (3.3 ft) deep; unfortunately, there
was not always time to ﬁnd dry
ground, and, for the most part, the

pits were dug and ﬁlled with no over-
sight. Many of the burials took place
on ﬂoodplains, and it can be expected
that, as the pig carcasses rot, bacteria
will leak into groundwater and surface
waters for some appreciable time.1

After the 1995 spills, environmen-
talists raised warnings concerning the
location of the pig farms. They pointed
out that hurricanes and ﬂooding were
common on North Carolina’s coastal
plain. However, the pig farm corpora-
tions are very rich and politically pow-
erful; they fight long and hard
to resist any change in their op-
erations. Incredibly, they asked
for approximately $1 billion in
grants to repair or replace the
agricultural facilities lost in
1995. They also asked for ex-
emption from the Clean Water
Act for a period of 6 months so
that waste from lagoons might
be discharged directly into
streams. Fortunately, these re-
quests were not granted.1

FIGURE 14.2 Ruptured hog waste lagoon This lagoon, in Pitt County, North Carolina,
ruptured as a result of Hurricane Floyd. (USGS/U.S. Department of the Interior)

Even before the catastrophe
caused by Hurricane Floyd, the
pig farm situation in North
Carolina had grown into a scan-
dal reported by newspapers,
local television shows, and the
national news show 60 Minutes.

Finally, in 1997, a state law was en-
acted that prohibited building new
waste lagoons and sewage plants on
ﬂoodplains. In the spring of 1999, the
governor of North Carolina proposed
a 10-year plan to introduce new
waste-treatment technology and
phase out the state’s 4,000 animal
waste lagoons. Unfortunately, Hurri-
cane Floyd occurred before these
changes could be enacted. Pig farms
used the hurricane as a scapegoat,
blaming it for the environmental cata-
strophe. However, it was clearly a
human-induced catastrophe. Other
states, such as Iowa, have large pig
farms but have much more stringent
environmental controls. Given
North Carolina’s frequent hurricanes,

cane Floyd inundated many pig farms, and pig carcasses were buried in

468

CHAPTER 14

Water Pollution

restricting factory farms from ﬂood-
plains would seem to be a “no brainer.”
However, this is only the ﬁrst step in
controlling the waste problem posed
by the pig farms in North Carolina. In
order to prevent a similar catastrophe
in the future, pig farmers will have to
replace the use of waste lagoons with
alternative waste-management prac-
tices.1,2 Several years ago, citizens
formed the “Hog Roundtable,” a
coalition of health, civic, and environ-
mental groups, to control hog farm-
ing. Results included a mandate to
phase out hog lagoons, expanded
requirements for a buffer zone between
hog farms and wells supplying water
for people, requirements for larger
buffers between ﬁelds being sprayed
with pig waste and surface waters, and
halting of construction of a proposed
slaughterhouse that would allow even
more hog farms to be constructed.

Hurricane Floyd proved that large-
scale agriculture is vulnerable to envi-
ronmental catastrophes. Economic
growth and livestock production must
be carefully planned to anticipate prob-
lems; waste-management facilities
must be designed that will not harm
the environment. Of course, North
Carolina is not the only place where
environmental damage from pig
production has occurred. Fish kills have
occurred in Missouri and Iowa as well.
Clearly, these examples demonstrate
the need for the design of environmen-
tally safe industrial agricultural prac-
tices. To this end, research with the
objective to treat waste produced by pig
farms has been ongoing since about

1997. The overall objective is to elimi-
nate the discharge of waste to the land
surface water and groundwater while
also eliminating odors and pathogens.
Three related processes are3:
1. Recovery  of  organic  matter  from
pig waste by separating solids from
liquid waste

2. Removal of ammonia and phos-

phorus from the wastewater

3. Disposal of the treated wastewater

An on-site treatment facility (see

Figure 14.4) at a pig farm in Duplin
County, North Carolina, replaced a
swine lagoon. The plant successfully
removed more than 97 percent of the
solids, 99 percent of the ammonia,
95 percent of the phosphorus, and
97 percent of the odor-causing

components.3 Following treatment,
the disinfected (cleaned) wastewater
was discharged into the old swine la-
goon, which changed color from pol-
luted brown water to much cleaner,
clear water. As a byproduct, the treat-
ment produced a liquid fertilizer as
well as solid calcium phosphate (also
a fertilizer) that can be used to nour-
ish feed crops for the pigs or be sold.
In North Carolina, waste treatment
facilities for pig farms are necessary
because, in 2007, the state passed
legislation to ban construction or
expansion of new lagoons and spray
ﬁelds. The legislation also encourages
pig farms to extract methane from
the pig waste (using bacteria in
anaerobic digesters) to be used as an
energy source.

14.1 An Overview 

of Water Pollution

Water  pollution refers  to  degradation  of  water
quality  as  measured  by  biological,  chemical,  or
physical criteria. This degradation is judged accord-
ing to the intended use of the water, its departure
from the norm, and public health or ecological im-
pacts.  From  a  public  health  or  ecological  point  of

view, a pollutant is any substance that, in excess, is
known to be harmful to desirable living organisms.
In fact, the primary water pollution problem facing bil-
lions of people today, especially in the developing world,
is  the  lack  of  clean  drinking  water  that  is  free  of  dis-
ease-causing organisms or substances. The concentra-
tion at which a material becomes harmful to living
things  is  the  subject  of  toxicology,  discussed  in
Chapter 19.

The  greatest  water  pollution  problem  in  the
world today is lack of disease-free drinking water for
about 20 percent of the world’s population. Another
20  percent  have  poor  sanitation  conditions  that
favor waterborne diseases that kill about 2 million
people  a  year.  Most  of  the  deaths  are  of  children
under age 5. Chemical pollution is also an emerging
problem on a global scale that occurs almost every
place where people live. Agricultural, industrial, and
municipal  processes  release  chemical  pollutants
whose  long-term  effects  on  the  environment  and
human health are largely unknown.4 Table 14.1 lists
annual  releases  (ﬂux)  of  common  chemicals  that
cause  water  pollution.  Some  of  the  pathways  for
water  pollutants  in  the  environment  are  shown
in Figure 14.5.

14.2 Selected Water Pollutants
Many materials can pollute surface water or ground-
water. Our discussion will focus on oxygen-demand-
ing waste; pathogenic, or disease-causing, microor-
ganisms; nutrients; oil; synthetic organic chemicals;
heavy  metals;  radioactive  materials;  and  sediment.
We will also discuss a nonmaterial form of pollution:
thermal pollution.

Oxygen-Demanding Waste
Dead plant and animal matter, called organic matter,
in streams decays over time; that is, it is consumed

by bacteria, which require oxygen. These are called
aerobic bacteria,  meaning  they  require  oxygen  to
live.  If  there  is  enough  bacterial  activity,  the  oxy-
gen  in  the  water  can  be  reduced  to  levels  so  low
that ﬁsh and other organisms die. The amount of
oxygen  used  for  bacterial  decomposition  is  the
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), a commonly
used measure in water-quality management. A high
BOD indicates a high level of decaying organic mat-
ter in the water.

Dead organic matter in streams and rivers comes
from natural sources, such as fallen leaves, as well as
from  agriculture  and  urban  sewage.  Approximately
33 percent of all BOD results from agricultural activi-
ties,  but  urban  areas,  particularly  those  with  sewer
systems that combine sewage and stormwater runoff,
may add considerable BOD to streams during ﬂoods.
Sewers entering treatment plants can be overloaded
and overﬂow into streams, producing pollution.

Pathogenic Organisms
Pathogenic microbes or microorganisms, which are
those that can be seen only with a microscope, are
important  biological  pollutants.  Cholera,  typhoid
infections,  hepatitis,  and  dysentery  are  all  water-
borne  diseases  caused  by  pathogenic  microorgan-
isms. It is often difﬁcult to monitor the pathogens
directly;  instead,  the  level  of  human  fecal  coliform
bacteria is used as a common measure of biological
pollution  and  as  a  standard  measure  of  microbial

pollution. Fecal coliform bacteria are usually harm-
less, are part of the normal constituents of human
intestines, and are found in all human waste.

However, not all forms of fecal coliform bacteria
are  harmless.  Escherichia  coli (also  known  as  E.  coli

0157), a strain of E. coli bacteria, has been responsi-
ble  for  human  illnesses  and  deaths.  E.  coli 0157,
which  causes  over  70,000  illnesses  and  60  deaths
in  the  United  States  each  year,  produces  strong
toxins in humans that may lead to bloody diarrhea,

dehydration, kidney failure, and death. In 1993, out-
breaks of disease, apparently caused by E. coli 0157,
occurred as a result of people’s consumption of con-
taminated meat at a popular fast-food restaurant. In
1998, E. coli apparently contaminated the water in a
Georgia  water  park  and  a  Wyoming  town’s  water
supply, causing illness and one death.

One of the worst outbreaks of E. coli bacterial in-
fection in Canadian history unfolded in May 2000 in
Walkerton,  Ontario.  It  is  believed  that  the  likely
cause of the contamination in Walkerton was E. coli
bacteria  in  cow  manure  washing  into  the  public
water  supply  during  heavy  rains  and  ﬂooding  that
occurred on May 12, 2000. The local Public Utility
Commission  was  aware  as  early  as  May  18  that
water  from  wells  serving  the  town  was  contami-
nated, but it did not report this contamination im-
mediately to health authorities. As a result, people
were not advised to boil water until it was too late to
avoid the outbreak of disease. By May 26, 5 people
had  died,  more  than  20  were  in  the  intensive  care
unit  of  the  local  hospital,  and  approximately  700
were  ill  with  severe  symptoms,  including  cramps,
vomiting, and diarrhea. The old and very young are
most vulnerable to the ravages of the disease, which
can damage the kidneys, and 2 of the ﬁrst victims of
this outbreak were a 2-year-old baby and an 82-year-
old  woman.  Government  ofﬁcials  ﬁnally  took  over
management of the water supply, and bottled water
was distributed. Tragically, before the outbreak was
over, at least 7 people had died and more than 1,000
had been infected. Study of people from the Walker-
ton breakout followed for several years after illness
suggest they have an increased risk of hypertension
(high  blood  pressure)  and  cardiovascular  disease
(hardening of the arteries).

Authorities  launched  an  investigation,  focusing
on why there was such a long delay between identify-
ing the potential problem and warning people. Had
there not been such a long delay, illnesses might have
been avoided. The real lesson learned from Walker-
ton is that we remain vulnerable to contamination of
our water supply. We must remain vigilant in testing
our waters and immediately report problems to pub-
lic health authorities if any problems arise.

In  the  fall  of  2006,  E.  coli 0157  was  traced  to
farms in northern California. Contaminated spinach
was shipped to 23 states. About 150 people became
sick, and 1 person died. More recently, peanut butter

contaminated with E. coli 0157 caused several hun-
dred  illnesses  and  killed  several  people  across  the
United States in 2009.

Epidemics  of  waterborne  diseases  have  killed
thousands  of  people  in  U.S.  cities.  Such  epidemics
have  been  largely  eliminated  by  separating  sewage
water  and  drinking  water  and  treating  drinking
water  before  consumption.  Unfortunately,  this  is
not the case worldwide, and every year, several bil-
lion  people,  particularly  in  poor  countries,  are  ex-
posed to waterborne diseases. For example, an epi-
demic  of  cholera  (explosive  diarrhea  and  vomiting
with  serious  dehydration,  caused  by  the  bacteria
known as Vibrio cholerae) broke out in October of
2010  in  Haiti.  After  the  earthquake  in  January  of
2010  over  1.3  million  were  forced  into  tent  cities
(especially  near  the  capital  city  of  Port-au-Prince).
The  crowded  tent  cities  have  very  poor  sanitation,
and water pollution is a serious problem. A cholera
epidemic  claimed  more  than  3,000  lives  (50,000
hospitalized)  by  early  January  2011.  Although
developing  nations  are  most  vulnerable,  the  risk 
of  waterborne  diseases  is  a  potential  threat  in  all
countries.

The threat of an outbreak of a waterborne disease
is  exacerbated  by  disasters  such  as  earthquakes,
ﬂoods,  and  hurricanes;  these  events  can  damage
sewer lines or cause them to overﬂow, resulting in
contamination of water supplies. For example, after
the 1994 Northridge earthquake, people in the San
Fernando Valley of the Los Angeles Basin were ad-
vised to purify municipal water by boiling because of
the threat of bacterial contamination.

Nutrients
Nutrients  released  by  human  activity  may  lead  to
water  pollution.  Two  important  nutrients  that  can
cause problems are phosphorus and nitrogen, both of
which are released from a variety of materials, includ-
ing fertilizers, detergents, and the products of sewage-
treatment  plants.  The  concentration  of  phosphorus
and  nitrogen  in  streams  is  related  to  land  use.
Forested land has the lowest concentrations of phos-
phorus  and  nitrogen,  while  the  highest  concentra-
tions are found in agricultural areas, such as fertilized
farm  fields  and  feedlots.  Urban  areas  can  also  add
phosphorus and nitrogen to local waters, particularly
where wastewater-treatment plants discharge treated

472

CHAPTER 14

Water Pollution

waters into rivers, lakes, or the ocean. These plants
are  effective  in  reducing  organic  pollutants  and
pathogens,  but  without  advanced  treatment,  nutri-
ents pass through the system.

High  human-caused  concentrations  of  nitrogen
and phosphorus in water often result in the process
known  as  cultural  eutrophication.  Eutrophication
(from the Greek for “well fed”), a natural process, is
characterized by a rapid increase in the abundance
of plant life, particularly algae. Blooms of algae form
thick mats that sometimes nearly cover the surface
of  the  water  in  freshwater  ponds  and  lakes.  The
algae block sunlight to plants below, and those plants
eventually die. In addition, the algae consume oxy-
gen as they decompose, thereby lowering the oxygen
content of the water, and ﬁsh and aquatic animals
may die as well.

In  the  marine  environment,  nutrients  in  near-
shore waters may cause blooms of seaweed, referred

(a)

(b)

to  as  marine  algae,  to  ﬂourish.  The  marine  algae
become a nuisance when they are torn loose and ac-
cumulate on beaches. Algae may also damage or kill
coral  in  tropical  areas.  For  example,  the  island  of
Maui in the Hawaiian Islands has a cultural eutroph-
ication  problem  resulting  from  nutrients  entering
the  near-shore  environment  from  waste-disposal
practices  and  agricultural  runoff.  Beaches  in  some
areas become foul with algae that washes up on the
shore, where it rots and creates a stench, providing a
home  for  irritating  insects  that  eventually  drive
away tourists (Figure 14.6).

A  serious  and  ongoing  cultural  eutrophication
problem is occurring in the Gulf of Mexico, offshore
of  Louisiana.  A  so-called  dead  zone  (Figure  14.7)
develops in the summer, over a large area about the
size of New Jersey. Water in the zone has low con-
centrations  of  oxygen,  killing  shellﬁsh  and  crabs,
and blooms of algae occur. The cause of the cultural

Hawaii (a) Ocean-front condominium on the island Maui,
Hawaii. The brown line along the edge of the beach is an
accumulation of marine algae (locally called seaweed). (b) On the
beach itself, the algae pile up, sometimes to a depth of about 
0.5 m (1.7 ft), and people using the beach avoid the areas of
algae piles. (c) Condominium complexes often have small
wastewater-treatment plants, such as the one shown here, inside
the plant-covered fence, that provide primary and secondary
treatment. After this treatment, the water is injected under-
ground at a relatively shallow depth. The treatment does not
remove nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, that
apparently encourage the accelerated growth of marine algae 
in the near-shore environment. (Edward A. Keller)

eutrophication  is  believed  to  be  the  Mississippi
River.  The  Mississippi  drains  about  40  percent  of
the lower 48 states, and much of the land use in the
drainage basin is agricultural. The nutrient believed
to  cause  the  problem  is  nitrogen,  which  is  used  in
great  amounts  to  fertilize  fields.  The  problem  will
not be easy to solve as long as agriculture continues
to use tremendous amounts of fertilizer. Part of the
solution  will  be  modiﬁcation  of  agricultural  prac-
tices to use less nitrogen by using it more efﬁciently
so that less of the nutrient runs off the land into the
river.5 Numerous  other  areas  around  the  world,
often just offshore of large urban or agriculture re-
gions,  with  signiﬁcant  discharge  of  nutrients  into
the  ocean  have  cultural  eutrophication  similar  to
that in the Gulf of Mexico.

Oil
Oil discharged into surface water (i.e., rivers, lakes,
and  the  ocean)  has  caused  major  pollution  prob-
lems.  The  largest  oil  discharges  have  usually  in-
volved oil-tanker accidents at sea. For example, just
after  midnight  on  March  24,  1989,  the  oil  tanker
Exxon  Valdez ran  aground  on  Bligh  Reef,  40  km
(25  mi) south of Valdez, Alaska, in Prince William
Sound. Crude oil poured out of the ruptured tanks
of the vessel at a rate of approximately 20,000 bar-
rels  per  hour  (Figure  14.8).  The  Exxon  Valdez was
loaded with 1.2 million barrels of crude oil, and, of

this,  more  than  250,000  barrels  (11  million  gal)
gushed from the hold of the 300 m (984 ft) tanker.
The  oil  remaining  in  the  Exxon  Valdez was  loaded
into another tanker.6

The  oil  spilled  into  what  was considered  one  of
the most pristine and ecologically rich marine envi-
ronments  of  the  world,  and  the  accident  is  now
known as one of the worst oil spills in the history of
the  United  States.  Short-term  impacts  were  very
signiﬁcant.  Commercial  ﬁsheries,  sport  ﬁsheries,
and  tourism  were  disrupted.  In  addition,  many
seabirds  and  mammals  were  lost.  Lessons  learned
from  the  Exxon Valdez spill  have  resulted  in  better
management  strategies  for  both  the  shipment  of
crude oil and emergency plans to minimize environ-
mental degradation.

A large oil spill in 2006 was caused by the war in
Lebanon,  when  a  coastal  power  plant  was  bombed
and  over  100,000  barrels  of  fuel  oil  entered  the
Mediterranean  Sea.  Over  half  of  Lebanon’s  tourist
beaches  were  polluted,  including  a  popular  public
beach visited by people from the capital city Beirut.
Most  previous  spills  were  relatively  small  com-
pared to the Gulf spill in the summer of 2010. On
April  20,  2010,  an  exploratory  oil  well  was  being
completed  prior  to  production  on  the  Deepwater
Horizon  platform  off  the  shore  of  the  Mississippi
River delta in about 1,500 m (5,000 ft) of water. The
well was drilled another 3,000 m (15,000 ft) into the
rocks of the Gulf. The ﬂoating oil platform was very

large and extremely complex, kept in place by navi-
gation using Global Position Satellite systems. The
well was in the process of being ﬁtted with a cement
plug  when  a  large  volume  of  methane  gas  evi-
dently escaped the systems designed to suppress a
blowout (i.e., uncontrolled release of gas and oil that
occurs after systems to control pressure fail) and en-
veloped  the  platform.  The  time  between  when  the
gas moved up from the bottom of the sea to the plat-

form and when the platform burst into ﬂames was
probably only a few minutes (Figure 14.9). The ex-
plosion and ﬁres killed 11 workers and injured many
others, who escaped to lifeboats. The result was an
oil spill,  deﬁned  as  an  accidental  release  of  oil  into
the environment as a result of human activities on
an oil rig, from failure of a tanker ship transporting
oil,  or  the  failure  of  an  oil  pipeline.  The  platform
burned and sank to the bottom of the sea. As part of

the completion process, a decision was made to re-
move the drilling mud (i.e., very heavy ﬂuids) used
to counteract the natural pressure from the subsur-
face.  In  other  words,  the  heavy  drilling  mud  helps
keep  formation  ﬂuids  (i.e.,  water,  oil,  and  natural
gas) in the well in place and from rising to the sur-
face. If the oil and gas pressure is not contained by a
functioning blowout preventer, it will rush out and
up  through  the  water  to  the  surface.  It  is  believed
that  that  decision  to  withdraw  the  heavy  drilling
mud shortly before the blowout was the major mis-
take that resulted in the blowout; without the mud
and with the blowout preventer malfunction, there
was only water pressure to keep the oil and gas from
escaping,  and  that  was  a  recipe  for  disaster.  Even
prior to the blowout, there were reported problems
with  the  well,  and  workers  and  others  expressed
concerns  about  being  able  to  control  the  well  (i.e.,
prevent an incident in which oil would escape into
the environment). The natural subsurface pressure
is several times the pressure of the overlying water,
and, so, when the blowout occurred, water, oil, and
natural gas moved quickly through 1,500 m (5,000 ft)
of  ocean  water  to  the  surface.  Another  technical
problem arose because, when the ﬁre on the platform
occurred, equipment designed to possibly control what
was going on at depth was destroyed. An automatic
shutoff  was  a  safety  feature  that  was  supposed  to
stop the ﬂow of oil if something happened to the rig.
However, because the rig was on ﬁre, the sophisti-
cated  navigation  equipment  that  kept  the  ﬂoating
platform in place and supported the safety feature
was destroyed by the ﬁre. The navigation equipment

is critical in keeping the pipe, which contains the oil,
directly  over  the  well  itself  in  the  bottom  of  the
seabed. Movement of the platform severed that pipe,
and oil was released as a spill.

The  amount  of  oil  actually  released  remains
controversial,  most  likely  varying  from  about
20,000 to 60,000 barrels per day (1 barrel ⫽ 42 gal).
The  amount  of  oil  released  into  the  Gulf  before
the  leak  was  finally  stopped  was  about  5  million
barrels  (20  times  that  of  the  Exxon  Valdez  dis-
cussed  earlier).  That’s  a  lot  of  oil  to  be  released
into  the  marine  environment.  Released  with  the
oil was a large amount of natural gas, and this nat-
ural gas was mostly responsible for the explosion
and fire that destroyed the platform. Much of the
methane in the water column is acted upon by bac-
teria and degraded.

The response to the oil spill was immediate and
consisted of practices used in past spills. Time was
of  the  essence  because  oil  spills  can  be  toxic  and
harmful to marine life, including birds, reptiles, and
mammals. The oil can also harm ﬁsh and shellﬁsh.
The location of the Deepwater Horizon platform
is shown in Figure 14.10, along with nearly 4,000
other platforms in the Gulf region in the coast off
the United States. By mid-June 2010, oil from the
spill had reached a number of beaches and wetlands
along  the  coasts  of  Louisiana  and  Alabama.  The
amount of oil released and reactions with wind, cur-
rent, and tides in the Gulf will determine the spread
of the oil in the future.7

A  variety  of  methods  have  been  used  to  try  to
control the spread of oil and clean it up after it has

Most  of  these  methods  have  been  around  for
decades, and the technology has not improved much
during this period. The methods include deploying
booms, skimmers, and chemical dispersants; burn-
ing  the  oil  in  water  in  situ;  washing  the  oil  off
beaches; and vacuuming or picking up the oil. Some-
times,  equipment  as  simple  as  shovels  and  road
equipment is used to pick up oil from sandy beaches.
The particular methods used depend upon the site,
how much oil is present, and the accessibility of the
site  to  necessary  equipment.7 Wildlife  both  in  the
Gulf and on shore was impacted by the Deepwater
Horizon oil spill. Sea birds and turtles were taken to
refuge locations where they were cleaned and cared
for in hopes that they might be released into the en-
vironment in the future.8,9

The  oil  spill  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  is  the  worst
such disaster in the history of the United States. It
is  feared  that  the  consequences  of  the  spill  will  be
chronic,  lasting  several  years.  Fishermen  were  put
out of work as the Gulf waters were partially closed
to  ﬁshing.  People  in  tourist  areas  lost  money  be-
cause  travelers  began  picking  other  locations,  not
wanting to contend with oil on beaches. Supporting
businesses  related  to  ﬁshing  and  tourism  also  suf-
fered ﬁnancially. As a result, the company responsi-
ble for the cleanup has agreed to post a $20 billion
escrow fund to be dispersed by the U.S. government
to those who need assistance and were affected ﬁ-
nancially by the spill.

What we have learned from the Deepwater Horizon
oil spill is, ﬁrst, that it should never have happened. It
was a human-caused spill and should have been pre-
ventable.  You  can  argue  that  there  are  thousands  of
platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, and, so, the probabil-
ity of one experiencing a blowout is very low. However,
the risk from an environmental event is the product of
that event multiplied by the consequences. The proba-
bility of the blowout may have been small, but the con-
sequences are very large. We must recognize, though,
that no matter how careful we are and how good our
technology is, accidents can happen.

The response to the oil spill was reactive. A great
number of boats (about 6,000) were deployed, with
about 25,000 workers, to try to minimize the spread
of  the  spill  and  collect  oil  in  the  sea  and  on  land.
Some oil was burned, and chemical dispersants were
applied from aircraft, as well as at the bottom of the
sea, where the leak was occurring. These dispersants
are  chemicals  and  themselves  have  environmental
impacts. It is known that these chemicals can damage
marine ecosystems, but some scientists, at the time
of the spill, looked at using or not using dispersants
as a case of which was the lesser of two evils. Disper-
sants were used, but the long-term impact of them,
particularly on the sea bed, is largely unknown. This
brings  up  an  important  point:  The  science  of  the
deep-ocean basin has not progressed signiﬁcantly to
be able to adequately predict the processes there and
how they will interact with the oil and dispersants. At
the surface, we know that the oil moves with the cur-
rents and the winds and ends up on some shore lines,
where  it  does  ecological  damage.  We  then  use  anti-
quated systems of collection.9

What could have been done better in the Deep-
water  Horizon  spill?  First  of  all,  we  need  adequate

regulation of the oil industry to ensure that all safety
practices  are  followed  carefully,  and  research  needs
to be done to make the blowout prevention devices
more fail-safe. First, to be proactive about future oil
spills,  we  need  to  do  everything  possible  to  ensure
that they do not happen. Second, we need to be more
proactive in planning what to do after a spill. Big oil
spills happen rather infrequently, and, as a result, be-
tween spills, technology may not go forward in antic-
ipation of the next spill. The bottom line is that we
need  to  be  much  more  proactive  about  oil  spills
rather  than  reactive.  Following  a  spill,  we  have  no
choice but to be reactive, but the real work should be
done  before  a  spill  ever  occurs  in  order  to  prevent
spills and deal with them in a timely way.

Will the Gulf recover from the 2010 oil spill? Cer-
tainly, it will. Oil is a nutrient, in both the water and
the near-shore environment. The recovery so far has
been more rapid than expected. However, the Exxon
Valdez spill has shown us that some oil remains even
decades following spills. The Gulf may therefore be a
changed  environment  for  a  number  of  years.  The
spill will continue to have adverse effects on ecosys-
tems  and  on  people’s  livelihoods.  To  some  extent,
this is a natural experiment, as we have no previous
experience  in  dealing  with  such  large  spills  that
places oil and dispersants at the bottom of the deep
sea,  as  well  as  oil  on  beaches  and  in  salt  marshes.
Hopefully, we will learn from this experience and re-
duce  the  chances  of  future  spills.  Given  the  best
technology and the best engineering, human error
will  surely  be  responsible  for  spills  on  land  and  in
the  ocean  in  the  future.  However,  we  can  be  more
proactive in minimizing their effects.

Toxic Substances
Many substances that enter surface water and ground-
water are toxic to organisms. We will discuss three gen-
eral categories of toxic substances—synthetic organic
chemicals, heavy metals, and radioactive waste.

Synthetic  Organic  Chemicals. Organic  com-
pounds are compounds of carbon that are produced
naturally by living organisms or synthetically by in-
dustrial  processes.  Up  to  100,000  new  chemicals
are now being used or have been used in the past. It
is  difﬁcult  to  generalize  concerning  the  environ-
mental and health effects of synthetic organic com-
pounds  because  there  are  so  many  of  them,  and

Selected Water Pollutants

477

they have so many uses and produce so many differ-
ent effects.

Synthetic organic compounds have many uses in
industrial  processes,  including  pest  control,  phar-
maceuticals, and food additives. Some of these com-
pounds  are  called  persistent  organic  pollutants,  also
known as POPs. Many of these chemicals were pro-
duced  decades  ago,  before  their  harm  to  the  envi-
ronment was known, and a number have now been
banned  or  restricted.  Table  14.2 lists  some  of  the
common  persistent  organic  pollutants  and  their
uses. Several general properties are useful in deﬁn-
ing POPs.10 First, POPs have a carbon-based struc-
ture  and  often  contain  reactive  chlorine.  Second,
most  are  produced  by  human  processes  and,  thus,
are  synthetic  chemicals.  Third,  they  persist  in  the
environment, do not break down easily, are pollut-
ing and toxic, and tend to accumulate in living tis-
sue.  Fourth,  they  occur  in  a  number  of  forms  that
allow  them  to  be  easily  transported  by  water  and
wind with sediment for long distances.

A  signiﬁcant  example  of  a  water  polluter  is  the
chemical MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether). The Clean
Air Act Amendments that were passed in 1990 re-
quired cities with air pollution problems to use what
are known as “oxygen additives” in gasoline. MTBE
is added to gasoline with the objective of increasing
the  oxygen  level  of  the  gasoline  and  decreasing

emissions of carbon monoxide from gasoline-burn-
ing cars. It is used because MTBE is more economi-
cal than other additives, including alcohol. MTBE is
very  soluble  in  water  and  is  a  commonly  detected
volatile organic compound (VOC) in urban ground-
water. It is hypothesized that the MTBE detected in
shallow groundwater originates from three sources:
urban  stormwater  runoff,  leaking  underground
gasoline tanks, and leakage occurring at service sta-
tions when car tanks are being ﬁlled.

It is ironic that a gasoline additive intended to im-
prove air quality is now contaminating the ground-
water that is used as a source of drinking water for
approximately  15  million  people  in  California. In
1997,  MTBE-polluted  groundwater  in  Santa  Mon-
ica,  California,  forced  the  city  to  stop  pumping
groundwater, eliminating approximately 50 percent
of the total drinking water supply for the city. Con-
centrations of MTBE in Santa Monica’s groundwater
ranged  from  about  8  to  600  micrograms  (μg)  per
liter.  The  Environmental  Protection  Agency  has
stated that concentrations of 20 to 40 μg of MTBE
per  liter  of  water  are  sufﬁcient  to  cause  objection-
able  taste  and  odor.  MTBE  in  that  concentration
smells like turpentine or fresh paint and is nauseat-
ing to some people. Studies are under way concern-
ing the toxicity of MTBE, and some researchers fear
that  it  is  a  carcinogenic  chemical  (i.e.,  capable  of
causing or promoting cancer). As a result of the con-
tamination,  some  states,  such  as  California,  have
terminated  the  use  of  MTBE.  See  Figure  14.5 for
some  of  the  pathways  of  MTBE,  as  well  as  other
volatile organic compounds, in the hydrologic cycle
of an urban area.11

Heavy  Metals. Heavy  metals,  such  as  lead,  mer-
cury, zinc, cadmium, silver, and arsenic, are danger-
ous pollutants that are often deposited with natural
sediment  in  the  bottoms  of  stream  channels.  If
these metals are deposited on ﬂoodplains, they may
become  incorporated  into  plants,  including  food
crops, and animals. Once the metal has dissolved in
water used for agricultural or domestic use, heavy-
metal poisoning can result.

As  an  example,  consider  mercury  contamination
of aquatic ecosystems. It has been known for decades
that  mercury  is  a  signiﬁcant  pollutant  of  aquatic
ecosystems,  including  ponds,  lakes,  rivers,  and  the
ocean.12

Perhaps the best-known case history of mercury
toxicity comes from Minamata, Japan. Minamata is
a coastal town on the island of Kyushu and was the
site of a serious illness that was ﬁrst recognized in
the  middle  of  the  twentieth  century.  It  was  ﬁrst
called the disease of the dancing cats because the ill-
ness was ﬁrst observed in cats that seemingly went
mad and ran in circles, foaming at the mouth. It was
also noticed that birds ﬂew into buildings or fell to
the ground. People were subsequently affected, and
most were families of ﬁshermen. Some of the ﬁrst
symptoms  were  fatigue,  irritability,  numbness  in
arms  and  legs,  and  headaches,  as  well  as  difﬁculty
swallowing. Some of the more severe symptoms in-
cluded  blurred  vision,  loss  of  hearing,  and  loss  of
muscular coordination. Some people complained of
a metallic taste in their mouths and suffered from
diarrhea.  By  the  time  the  disease  ran  its  course,
more than 40 people died and more than 100 were
severely disabled. The people affected by the disease
lived in a relatively small area, and their diet mostly
consisted of ﬁsh harvested from Minamata Bay.

The disease was eventually traced to a vinyl chlo-
ride factory on Minamata Bay that used mercury in
its  production  processes.  Inorganic  mercury  was
released as waste into the bay, and it was believed
that the mercury would not get into the food chain.
However, the inorganic mercury was converted by
bacterial  activity  in  Minamata  Bay  to  methylmer-
cury (discussed in more detail later in the chapter).
Methylmercury  readily  passes  through  cell  mem-
branes  and  is  transported  throughout  the  body
by  red  blood  cells.  It  can  enter  and  damage  brain
cells.  The  harmful  effects  of  methylmercury  de-
pend on a number of factors, including the amount
of exposure and intake, the duration of the expo-
sure,  and  the  species  affected.  The  effects  of  the
mercury  are  often  delayed  from  several  weeks  to
months in people from the time of ingestion. Fur-
thermore, if the intake of mercury ceases, some of
the symptoms may disappear, but others are difﬁcult
to reverse.12

The disease of the dancing cats eventually became
known  as  Minamata  disease,  and  nearly  800  people
were ofﬁcially recognized as having the disease, but as
many  as  several  thousand  may  have  been  involved.
The mercury pollution in the bay ceased in 1968. As
recently as the 1990s, some of the people afﬂicted by
the disease were still being compensated for damages.

There are several natural sources of mercury, in-
cluding input from volcanoes and erosion of natural
mercury  deposits.  In  most  cases,  however,  we  are
most concerned with the input of mercury into the
environment  through  processes  such  as  burning
coal,  incinerating  waste,  and  processing  metals.  Al-
though the rates of mercury input into the environ-
ment by humans are poorly understood, it is believed
that  human  activities  have  doubled  or  tripled  the
amount of mercury in the atmosphere, and it is in-
creasing at about 1.5 percent per year.13 Deposition
from the atmosphere through rainfall is the primary
source of mercury in most aquatic ecosystems. Once
ionic  mercury  (Hg2+)  is  in  surface  water,  it  enters
into complex cycles, during which a process known
as methylation may occur. Bacterial activity changes
the inorganic mercury to methylmercury (CH3Hg+).
This  process  is  important  from  an  environmental
viewpoint  because  methylmercury  is  much  more
toxic  than  ionic  mercury.  Furthermore,  living
things require longer periods of time to eliminate
methylmercury from their systems than they do to
eliminate inorganic mercury. As the methylmercury
works its way through food chains, a process known
as biomagniﬁcation occurs in which concentrations of
methylmercury increase in higher levels of the food

chain. Thus, big ﬁsh in a pond contain higher con-
centrations of mercury than do the smaller ﬁsh and
aquatic  insects  that  the  large  ﬁsh  feed  upon.  Some
aspects  of  the  mercury  cycle  in  aquatic  ecosystems
are illustrated in Figure 14.12. The input side of the
mercury  cycle  shows  the  deposition  of  inorganic
mercury  through  the  formation  of  methylmercury.
On  the  output  side  of  the  cycle,  mercury  entering
ﬁsh may be taken up by the organism that eats the
ﬁsh (Figure 14.13). Sediment may also release mer-
cury  by  a  variety  of  processes,  including  resuspen-
sion  in  the  water;  this  can  eventually  result  in  the
mercury’s entering the food chain or being released
back into the atmosphere through volatilization, the
process of converting a liquid or solid to a vapor.

Arsenic  is  an  example  of  a  highly  toxic  natural
metal that is found in soil, rock, and water. There are
many industrial and commercial uses of arsenic com-
pounds, including the processing of glass, pesticides,
and wood preservatives. Arsenic may enter our water
supplies  through  a  number  of  processes,  including
natural rain, snowmelt, or groundwater ﬂow. It may
also be released with industrial wastewater and agri-
cultural processes. Finally, it may be released through
the  production  of  pesticides,  the  burning  of  fossil
fuels, and as a by-product of mining.

Water Pollution

FIGURE 14.13 Fish may contain toxic metals People
cooking and eating ﬁsh, here in the Fiji Islands, take in chemicals,
including metals that the ﬁsh have in their tissue. Mercury is a
potential problem with ﬁsh such as tuna and swordﬁsh. (Peter
Arnold Inc.)

Arsenic has been known as a deadly poison since
ancient times, and, more recently, it has been rec-
ognized that elevated levels  of  arsenic in drinking
water may cause a variety of health problems that
affect organs, such as the bladder, lung, and kidney.
It may also cause disease to the central nervous sys-
tem. Finally, arsenic is known to be a carcinogen.

The  occurrence  of  arsenic  in  drinking  water  is
now  recognized  as  a  global  problem.  Arsenic  cer-
tainly  is  not  found  in  all  water  supplies,  but  it  is
found in many around the world. For example, ar-
senic  in  groundwater  in  Bangladesh  has  affected
many  millions  of  some  of  the  poorest  people  on
Earth. Ongoing research has aimed to identify those
locations where arsenic pollution occurs and to de-
velop  appropriate  technology  or  methods  to  avoid
or reduce the hazard of exposure to arsenic.14

Radioactive  Waste. Radioactive  waste  in  water
may  be  a  dangerous  pollutant.  Environmentalists
are  concerned  about  the  possible  effects  of  long-
term exposure to low doses of radioactivity to peo-
ple, other animals, and plants (see Chapter 16).

Sediment
Sediment consists of unconsolidated rock and min-
eral fragments, the smallest of which range in size
from sand particles to very small silt- and clay-sized

particles. These small particles cause most sediment
pollution problems. Sediment is our greatest water
pollutant by volume; it is clearly a resource out of
place.  It  depletes  soil,  a  land  resource;  can  reduce
the quality of the water resource it enters; and may
deposit  undesired  materials  on  productive  crop-
lands or on other useful land. Sediment pollution is
discussed in detail in Chapter 17.

Thermal Pollution
Thermal pollution is the artiﬁcial heating of waters,
primarily  by  hot-water  emission  from  industrial
operations  and  power  plants.  Heated  water  causes
several  problems.  First,  heated  water  contains  less
oxygen  than  cooler  water;  even  water  only  several
degrees  warmer  than  the  surrounding  water  holds
less oxygen. Second, warmer water favors different
species than does cooler water and may increase the
growth  rates  of  undesirable  organisms,  including
certain  water  plants  and  ﬁsh.  In  some  cases,  how-
ever,  the  warm  water  may  attract  and  allow  better
survival of certain desirable ﬁsh species, particularly
during the winter.

14.3 Surface-Water Pollution

and Treatment

Pollution of surface waters occurs when an excess
of an undesirable or harmful substance flows into
a body of water and exceeds the natural ability of
that  ecosystem  to  utilize,  remove,  or  convert  the
pollutant to a harmless form. Water pollutants are
emitted  from  localized  sources,  known  as  point
sources, or by diffuse sources, known as nonpoint
sources.

Point Sources of Surface-Water
Pollution
Point  sources are  discrete  and  conﬁned,  such  as
pipes that empty into streams or rivers from indus-
trial  or  municipal  sites  (Figure  14.14).  In  general,
point-source  pollutants  from  industries  are  con-
trolled  through  on-site  treatment  or  disposal  and
are regulated by permit. Municipal point sources are
also regulated by permit.

Surface-Water Pollution and Treatment

481

FIGURE 14.14 Point source Pipe discharging partially treated waste from the Climax Molybde-
num Mine in Colorado. Point sources are restricted and controlled by law in the United States.
(Jim Richardson/Richardson Images Ltd.)

Nonpoint Sources of Surface-
Water Pollution
Nonpoint  sources are  diffuse  and  intermittent;
they are inﬂuenced by such factors as land use, cli-
mate, hydrology, topography, native vegetation, and
geology.  Common  urban  nonpoint  sources  include
runoff from streets or ﬁelds. Rural sources of non-
point  pollution  are  generally  associated  with  agri-
culture, forestry, or mining (see A Closer Look: Acid
Mine Drainage).

Pollution  from  nonpoint  sources,  or  polluted
runoff, is difﬁcult to control and contains all sorts of
pollutants, from heavy metals to chemicals and sed-
iment (Figure 14.15). Even when you wash your car
in  your  driveway  and  the  detergent  and  oil  on  the
surface  run  down  a  storm  drain  that  enters  a
stream, you are contributing to polluted runoff. Pol-
luted  runoff  is  also  produced  when  rainwater
washes insecticides from the plants in your garden,
then runs off into a stream or inﬁltrates the surface
to  contaminate  groundwater.  Similarly,  rain  and
runoff from factories and storage yards are a source
of nonpoint pollution.15

Reduction of Surface-Water
Pollution: The Cuyahoga River
Success Story
In the United States, a concerted effort is underway
to  reduce  water  pollution  and  thereby  improve
water quality. The assumption is that people have a
basic  right  to  safe  water  for  drinking,  swimming,
and  use  in  agriculture  and  industry.  At  one  time,
water quality near major urban centers was consid-
erably worse than it is today. Consider the story of
the  Cuyahoga  River.  The  continental  glacial  ice
sheets  that  formed  the  Great  Lakes  last  receded
from  the  United  States  over  10,000  years  ago.  In
what is now northern Ohio, a river formed, ﬂowing
into what was later named Lake Erie. Native Ameri-
cans who arrived over 2,000 years ago in the Ohio
Valley  named  the  river  Cuyahoga,  which,  in  their
language,  meant  a  meandering  river  (i.e.,  having  a
sinuous  form  with  many  bends).  The  river  was  of
great  use  to  the  early  Native  Americans  who  lived
along the river and depended on it as a natural route
for  transporting  goods  that  they  consumed  and
traded  with  other  people.  In  the  seventeenth  and

eighteenth  centuries,  fur  traders  arrived  from  Eu-
rope  to  trade  with  the  Native  Americans,  and  the
War  of  1812  displaced  Native  Americans  from  the
Cuyahoga Valley. A few decades later, industrializa-
tion  arrived  in  the  river  valley,  and  canals  that
linked  the  river  to  Lake  Erie  were  constructed;  in
their  time,  they  carried  a  tremendous  volume  of

freight. With the growth of industrializa-
tion of the river valley and, in particular,
the  city  of  Cleveland,  Ohio,  pollution  of
the  river  became  more  and  more  com-
mon.  At  that  time,  laws  to  prohibit  the
dumping of waste into the river did not
exist, and, with the arrival of the petro-
leum industry in Cleveland, the river be-
came  even  more  polluted.  As  a  result  of
the pollution, ﬁsh and other living things
in  the  river  died,  and  the  river  became
one  of  the  most  polluted  in  the  United
States. In 1969, the Cuyahoga River made
environmental history when sparks from
a train ignited oil ﬂoating on the water in
the river, setting the surface of the river
on ﬁre! The burning of an American river
became a rallying point for growing envi-
ronmental consciousness.

The  Cuyahoga  River  today  is  cleaner
and  is  no  longer  ﬂammable.16 Parts  of
the  river  have  been  transformed  into  a
greenbelt  that  has  changed  the  river
from an open sewer to a valuable public
resource, as well as a focal point for eco-
nomic and environmental renewal. How-
ever, in downtown Cleveland and Akron,
the  river  remains  an  industrial  stream,
and parts are still polluted. Large portions
of  the  upper  part  of  the  river  have  been
designated as a State of Ohio Scenic River,
and the Cuyahoga Valley National Recre-
ation  Area  is  sited  in  the  valley  between
the cities of Cleveland and Akron. Finally,
portions  of  the  middle  and  lower  river
valley  were  designated  as  National  Her-
itage Sites. What will be the ﬁnal outcome
for the Cuyahoga River and its scenic val-
leys  and  urban  areas?  It  seems  that  the
river system is much revered by the peo-
ple of Ohio, and the river, hopefully, will
continue  to  be  a  showcase  of  positive
river  restoration,  demonstrating  how

even very polluted rivers may be restored.

Look

Acid Mine Drainage

Acid mine drainage refers to acidic
water with elevated concentrations
of dissolved metals that drains from
coal or metal mines. Speciﬁcally, acid
mine drainage is water with a high
concentration of sulfuric acid (H2SO4)
that drains from some mining areas
to pollute surface-water resources.
Acid mine drainage is produced by
complex geochemical and microbial
reactions when sulﬁde minerals asso-
ciated with coal or a metal, such as
zinc, lead, or copper, come into con-
tact with oxygen-rich water near the
surface. For example, pyrite (FeS2) is
a common sulﬁde often associated
with coal; when pyrite oxidizes in the
presence of water and microbes, sul-
furic acid is formed. The sources for
the water may be surface water that
inﬁltrates into mines or shallow
groundwater that moves through
mines. Similarly, surface and shallow
groundwaters that come into con-
tact with mining waste, called tail-
ings, may also react with sulﬁde
minerals found there to form acid-
rich waters.

Once waters with a high concen-
tration of sulfuric acid and dissolved
metals migrate away from a mining
area, they can pollute surface and
groundwater resources. If the acid-
rich water runs into a natural stream
or lake, signiﬁcant ecological damage
may result. The acid water is ex-
tremely toxic to plants and animals in
aquatic ecosystems; acidic waters
may also mobilize other potentially
harmful chemicals. Acid mine
drainage is a signiﬁcant water pollu-
tion problem in many parts of the
United States, including parts of
Wyoming, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky,

Tennessee, Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, West Virginia, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Colorado.
The total impact of acid mine
drainage is signiﬁcant; thousands 
of kilometers of streams have been
polluted (Figure 14.A).

The Tar Creek area of Oklahoma

was at one time designated by the En-
vironmental Protection Agency as the
nation’s worst example of acid mine
drainage. The creeks in the area were
severely polluted by acid-rich water
from abandoned mines in the Tri-
State Mining District of Kansas, Okla-
homa, and Missouri. Sulﬁde deposits
containing both lead and zinc were
ﬁrst mined there in the late nine-
teenth century, and mining ended in
some areas in the 1960s. During oper-
ation of the mines, subsurface areas

were kept dry by pumping out
groundwater that was constantly
seeping in. After mining stopped, the
groundwater tables naturally rose
again. Subsequently, some of the
mines ﬂooded and overﬂowed, pollut-
ing nearby streams. The Tri-State Min-
ing District remains an area of con-
cern, and a lot of work has been done
to reduce the impact of mines. The
likely solution to reducing acid mine
drainage in Tar Creek and other areas
in the region is to use passive meth-
ods of treatment that utilize naturally
occurring chemical and/or biological
reactions in controlled environments
to treat acid mine drainage. The sim-
plest controlled environment is an
open limestone channel. The acid-rich
water reacts with crushed limestone,
and the acid is neutralized.

FIGURE 14.A Acid mine drainage Water seeping from 
this Colorado mine is an example of acid mine drainage. The 
water is also contaminated by heavy metals, including iron 
compounds that produce the orange color. (Tim Haske/Profiles

plants may be overwhelmed by the runoff of ﬂood-
ing and fail, sending raw waste into streams (Figure
14.16).  As  a  result,  areas  downstream  receive  pol-
luted  water.  Towns  and  cities  along  the  stream  or
river  that  use  the  water  may  have  water  quality
problems.

14.4 Groundwater Pollution

and Treatment

Approximately one-half of all people in the United
States  depend  on  groundwater  as  their  source  of
drinking water. We are, therefore, concerned about
the introduction into aquifers of chemical elements,
compounds,  and  microorganisms  that  do  not  occur
naturally within the water. The hazard presented by a
particular groundwater pollutant depends on several
factors, including the volume of pollutant discharged,
the concentration or toxicity of the pollutant in the

environment, and the degree of exposure of people
or other organisms.

Most of us have long believed that our groundwa-
ter is pure and safe to drink, and many of us ﬁnd it
alarming to learn that it may be easily polluted by
any one of several sources (Table 14.3). In addition,
even  the  very  toxic  pollutants  may  be  difﬁcult  to
recognize.

Currently, the problem of groundwater pollution
in the United States is becoming more apparent as
water testing becomes more common. For example,
Atlantic  City,  New  Jersey,  and  Miami,  Florida,  are
two  eastern  cities  threatened  by  polluted  ground-
water that is slowly migrating toward their wells. It
is estimated that 75 percent of the 175,000 known
waste-disposal sites in the country may be produc-
ing  plumes  (elongated  bodies  of  contaminated
groundwater). Many of the chemicals found in our
groundwater  are  toxic  or  suspected  carcinogens.  It
therefore  appears  that  we  have  been  conducting  a
national 
large-scale  experiment  concerning  the
effects  of  chronic  low-level  exposure  of  people  to

potentially  harmful  chemicals!  Unfortunately,  the
ﬁnal results of the experiment will not be known for
many  years.17 Preliminary  results  suggest  that  we
should act now, before a hidden time bomb of health
problems explodes.

National Water-Quality 
Assessment Program
The past quarter century has seen signiﬁcant ﬁnan-
cial investments and great improvements in manu-
facturing,  processing,  and  wastewater-treatment
facilities, with the objective of reducing the amount
of  contaminants  emitted  into  our  water  resources.
These  programs  have  signiﬁcantly  improved  water
quality across the United States; however, consider-
able apprehension remains concerning the effects of
water  pollutants,  such  as  nutrients,  toxins,  and
pathogens,  on  human  health  and  the  health  of
aquatic  ecosystems.  In  response  to  this  need,  the
U.S. Geological Survey has a program to assess water
quality throughout the country. The program inte-
grates both surface-water and groundwater systems
that  monitor  and  study  aquatic  ecosystems.  The
goals  of  the  program  are  (1)  to  carefully  describe

Groundwater Pollution and Treatment

485

current  water-quality  conditions  for  many  of  the
freshwater  streams  and  aquifers  in  the  United
States,  (2)  to  monitor  and  describe  water-quality
changes over time, and (3) to increase understand-
ing concerning the human and natural factors that
affect the nation’s water quality.

One of the largest water systems under study is
the  Delaware  River  basin,  which  includes  parts  of
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Delaware
(Figure 14.17). The drainage basin contains parts of
several  distinct  physiographic  provinces,  which  are
regions  that  share  similar  topography,  rock  types,
and geologic history. Provinces vary from the rela-
tively ﬂat Coastal Plain and broader uplands of the
Piedmont, where 80 percent of the people living in
the basin reside, to the more rugged topography of
the Valley and Ridge province and the Appalachian
Plateaus  in  the  northern  portions  of  the  drainage
basin.  The  Delaware  River  basin  includes  forested
lands  (60  percent),  agricultural  lands  (24  percent),
urban  and  residential  areas  (9  percent),  and  land
taken up by surface water bodies and other miscella-
neous land types (7 percent).18

Some of the major water-quality issues being ad-
dressed in the Delaware River basin study18 include:
• Effects of the natural river system on the dis-
tribution, fate, and effects of contaminants in
water, sediment, and living things

• Relationships between the ﬂow of water in the
river and concentrations of nutrients, contam-
inants, and pathogens

• Presence of contaminants, including pathogens
and pesticides, in drinking water supplies and
in water used for recreational activities

• Development of water-management plans and
strategies  for  the  protection  of  areas  of  the
river basin that have high water quality

• Effects of septic systems, used to treat sewage
from  individual  homes,  on  water  quality  and
river ecology

• Effects  of  groundwater  withdrawals  on  water

quality

• Effects of discharge from coal mines on water

quality and river ecosystems

In  addition,  the  Delaware  River  basin  is  being
studied with the objective of determining what data
are  useful  for  predicting  the  impacts  of  climate
change.19 The  plan  is  to  monitor  the  river  for
changes  in  response  to  global  warming  related  to

Water Quality and Stream
Ecosystems in the United States
Improving  the  quality  of  stream  ecosystem  condi-
tions  in  the  United  States  is  an  important  goal.
Small  streams  that  can  be  waded  are  of  particular
concern because there are so many of them. Nearly
every  community  has  several  small  streams  in  the
immediate area, and local streams are often highly
valued by people. Recent studies have aimed to as-
sess  small  streams  in  the  United  States.20 A  stan-
dardized  ﬁeld  collection  of  data  is  an  important
step. Measurements at a particular stream include:
• Measurement  of  stream  channel  morphology

and the habitat for living things

• Measurement  of  the  streamside  and  near-

stream vegetation (i.e., riparian vegetation)

• Measurement of water chemistry
• Measurement of the near stream biological di-

versity of plants and animals

Evaluation of collected data includes two key bio-
logical indicators: (1) an index of biotic microinver-
tebrates  (insects)  living  in  the  stream  relative  to
streams  that  represent  a  least-disturbed  state  and
(2)  an  index  that  represents  a  loss  of  biodiversity.
Results of the study are shown in Figure 14.18. The
top  graph  is  for  the  entire  United  States,  and  the
three lower graphs are major regions of the country.
The  ratings  range  from  poor  conditions—that  is,
those that are most disturbed with respect to envi-
ronmental stress—to conditions that mostly corre-
spond to undisturbed stream systems. Compared to
the  western  states,  streams  with  poor  quality  are
most  numerous  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the
United  States,  as  well  as  in  the  midsection  of  the
country.  Also,  the  percentage  of  stream  length  in
good  condition  is  considerably  higher  in  the  west
than in other parts of the country. This is because
the  extent  of  stream  channel  modiﬁcations  and
changes in land use in the eastern half of the coun-
try  is  large  compared  to  that  in  the  western  half.
Western  states  tend  to  have  more  mountains  and
more areas of natural landscape that have not been

west have a higher risk for future degradation than
in  other  areas  because  there  are  more  pristine
streams against which to measure changes and be-
cause there are more high-quality stream ecosystem
conditions  to  potentially  be  degraded,  relative  to
other parts of the country.20

Saltwater Intrusion
Aquifer  pollution  does  not  result  solely  from  the
disposal  of  wastes  on  the  land  surface  or  in  the
ground.  Overpumping  or  mining  groundwater

allows inferior waters to migrate from both adja-
cent  aquifers  and  the  sea,  also  causing  contami-
nation  problems.  Hence,  human  use  of  public  or
private  water  supplies  can  accidentally  result  in
aquifer  pollution.  Intrusion  of  saltwater  into
freshwater supplies has caused problems in coastal
areas of New York, Florida, and California, among
other areas.

Figure  14.19 illustrates  the  general  principle  of
saltwater intrusion. The groundwater table is gener-
ally  inclined  toward  the  ocean,  and  a  wedge  of
saltwater is inclined toward the land. Thus, with no
conﬁning  layers,  salty  groundwater  near  the  coast
may be encountered below the land surface. Because

488

CHAPTER 14

Water Pollution

freshwater  is  slightly  less  dense  than  saltwater,
freshwater will ﬂoat on top of saltwater; the density
difference  explains  why  a  layer  of  freshwater  can
sometimes  be  found  in  the  ocean  offshore  from  a
river’s delta. When wells are drilled, a cone of depres-
sion develops 
in  the  freshwater  table  (Figure
14.19b), which may allow intrusion of saltwater as
the interface between freshwater and saltwater rises
and forms a cone of ascension in response to the loss
of freshwater.

Groundwater Treatment
The  difﬁculty  of  detecting  groundwater  pollution,
the long-term residency of groundwater, the degra-
dation of the polluted aquifer, and the difﬁculty and
expense of aquifer recovery establish a strong argu-
ment: No wastes or possible pollutants should be al-
lowed to enter any part of the groundwater system.
However,  preventing  the  entry  of  pollutants  re-
quires  careful  protection  and  management  of
recharge areas and may, in fact, be impossible. Acci-
dents such as broken pipelines will happen. In order
to  reduce  groundwater  pollution,  we  should  learn
more about the natural processes that treat wastes,
so that when soil and rocks cannot naturally treat,
store, or recycle wastes, we can develop processes to
make  the  pollutants  treatable,  storable,  or  recy-
clable. Table 14.4 brieﬂy outlines some of the meth-
ods for treating groundwater. The speciﬁc treatment
selected depends on variables, such as type of conta-
minant, method of transport, and characteristics of
the  local  environment,  such  as  depth  to  the  water
table and geologic characteristics.

14.5 Water-Quality Standards
A question people commonly ask is, “How safe is our
water  supply?”  Americans  believe  that  they  have
high-quality drinking water, some of the best in the
world.  For  the  most  part,  we  do  have  high-quality
drinking water, but, in recent years, we have gained
an  ability  to  detect  speciﬁc  contaminants  in  parts
per  billion  (ppb)  or,  in  some  cases,  even  parts  per
trillion (ppt) of water. The question that then arises
is, “How dangerous might some of these chemicals
be?” You may think that very small amounts of con-
taminants cannot possibly be dangerous, but, as the

minds us, a small number of viruses (non-living mi-
croscopic  particles  that  attack  healthy  cells)  can
cause  a  disease.  Physicians  are  able  to  delineate
what diseases are caused by particular viruses, but
we are less sure about the effects of long-term expo-
sure to very small amounts of chemicals.

In  response  to  this  concern,  the  U.S.  Congress
has mandated that the EPA establish minimum na-
tional  drinking  water  standards  for  a  variety  of
chemicals  and  other  materials.  In  1986,  Congress
expanded  the  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act  of  1974  to
include 83 contaminants. Among other regulations,
the  new  legislation  banned  the  use  of  lead  in  the
installation  or  repair  of  water  systems  used  for
drinking water. Health effects associated with lead
toxicity  are  very  well  known.  At  high  concentra-
tions,  lead  causes  damage  to  the  nervous  system
and the kidneys and is particularly toxic to infants
and pregnant women.21

The EPA has set standards for a number of con-
taminants  that  might  be  found  in  our  drinking
water.  However,  only  two  substances  for  which
these standards have been set are thought to pose
an  immediate  health  threat  when  standards  are
exceeded:21

• Coliform bacteria, possibly indicating that the
water  is  contaminated  by  harmful  disease-
causing organisms

• Nitrate,  because  contamination  above  the
standard is an immediate threat to young chil-
dren. In some children younger than 1 year old,
high  levels  of  nitrate  may  react  with  their
blood to produce an anemic condition known
as “blue baby.”

Table  14.5 is  an  abbreviated  list  illustrating
some  of  the  contaminants  included  in  the  EPA’s
list of National Primary Drinking Water Standards
and related health problems. The purposes of the
standards  and  regulations  concerning  drinking
water are:21

• To  ensure  that  our  water  supply  is  treated  to

remove harmful contaminants

• To  regularly  test  and  monitor  the  quality  of

our water supply

• To provide information to citizens so that they
are better informed concerning the quality and
testing of their water supply

Wastewater Treatment

489

14.6 Wastewater Treatment
Water that is used for municipal and industrial pur-
poses is often degraded by a variety of contaminants,
including oxygen-demanding materials, bacteria, nu-
trients,  salts,  suspended  solids,  and  other  chemi-
cals.  In  the  United  States,  laws  dictate  that  these
contaminated  waters  must  be  treated  before  they
are released back into the environment. Wastewater
treatment in the United States is big business, cost-
ing  several  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  per  year.  In
rural  areas,  the  conventional  method  of  treatment
uses septic-tank disposal systems. In larger commu-
nities, wastewater is generally collected and central-
ized  in  water-treatment  plants  that  collect  the
wastewater from a sewer system.

In  many  parts  of  the  country,  water  resources
are being stressed. As a result, innovative systems
are being developed to reclaim wastewater so that
it  can  be  used  for  such  purposes  as  irrigating
fields, parks, or golf courses rather than being dis-
charged into the nearest body of water. New tech-
nologies  are  also  being  developed  to  convert
wastewater into a resource that can be used. Those
developing the new technologies say that sewage-
treatment sites should not have to be hidden from
people’s  eyes  and  noses.  Rather,  we  should  come
to  expect  sewage  to  be  reclaimed  at  a  small  cost
while producing flowers and shrubs in a more gar-
denlike setting.22

Septic-Tank Sewage Disposal
In  the  United  States,  the  population  continues  to
move from rural to urban, or urbanizing, areas. Al-
though  using  municipal  sewers  and  using  sewage-
treatment  facilities  are  the  most  effective  method 
of  sewage  disposal,  construction  of  an  adequate
sewage  system  has  often  not  kept  pace  with
growth. As a result, the individual septic-tank dis-
posal system continues to be an important method
of sewage disposal. There are more than 26 million
septic-tank systems in operation, and about half a
million  new  systems  are  added  each  year.  As  a  re-
sult, septic systems are used by about 20 percent of
homes in the United States. Not all land, however,
is suitable for installation of a septic-tank disposal
system,  so  evaluation  of  individual  sites  is  neces-
sary and often required by law before a permit can
be issued.

The  basic  parts  of  a  septic  tank are  shown  in
Figure  14.20.  The  sewer  line  from  the  house  or
small business leads to an underground septic tank
in the yard. Solid organic matter settles to the bot-
tom of the tank, where it is digested and liqueﬁed by
bacterial  action.  This  is  part  of  the  treatment  that
reduces solid organic material to a more liquid state.
The liquid wastewater discharges into either a drain
ﬁeld, also called an absorption ﬁeld, which is a sys-
tem  of  shallowly  buried  perforated  piping,  or  a
large-diameter, deep, gravel-ﬁlled “dry well” through
which  the  wastewater  seeps  into  the  surrounding
soil. As the wastewater moves through the soil, it is

further treated and puriﬁed by natural processes of
ﬁltering and oxidation.

Geologic  factors  that  affect  the  suitability  of  a
septic-tank disposal system in a particular location
include type of soil, depth to water table, depth to
bedrock, and topography. These variables are gener-
ally  included  in  the  soil  descriptions  found  in  the
soil survey of an area. Soil surveys are published by
the  Soil  Conservation  Service  and  are  extremely
valuable when  evaluating  potential  land  use,  such
as suitability for a septic system. However, the reli-
ability of a soils map for predicting the limitations
of  soils  is  conﬁned  to  an  area  smaller  than  a  few

thousand square meters, and soil types can change
within a few meters, so it is often necessary to have
an onsite evaluation by a soil scientist or soils engi-
neer. To calculate the size of the drain ﬁeld needed,
one  must  know  the  rate  at  which  water  inﬁltrates
into  the  soil,  which  is  best  determined  by  testing
the soil.

Sewage  drain  ﬁelds  may  fail  for  several  reasons.
The  most  common  cause  is  poor  soil  drainage,
which allows the wastewater to rise to the surface in
wet  weather.  Poor  drainage  can  be  expected  to  be
present in areas with clay-rich soils or rock, such as
shale, with low hydraulic conductivity (Chapter 13),
in areas with a water table that is near the surface,
or in areas of frequent ﬂooding.

When septic systems fail, waste materials often
surface above the drain ﬁeld, producing a potential
health hazard. This sort of failure is easy to see. Un-
fortunately, what is happening beneath the ground
is  not  so  easy  to  see,  and  if  extensive  leaching  of
waste  occurs  at  the  water  table,  groundwater
resources  may  be  polluted.  Septic  systems  that

serve small commercial and industrial activities are
of  particular  concern.  They  tend  to  cause  severe
problems  of  groundwater  pollution  because  of  the
potentially  hazardous  nature  of  the  waste  being
disposed. Possible contaminants include nutrients,
such as nitrates; heavy metals, such as zinc, copper,
and lead; and synthetic organic chemicals, such as
benzine, carbon tetrachloride, and vinyl chloride. In
recent  years,  the  EPA  has  identiﬁed  a  number  of
commercial  and  industrial  septic  systems  that
caused  substantial  water  pollution  that  necessi-
tated cleanup.23

Wastewater-Treatment Plants
The main purposes of wastewater treatment for mu-
nicipal  sewage  from  homes  and  industry  are  to
break down and reduce the amount of organic solids
and BOD and to kill bacteria in the wastewater. In
addition,  new  techniques  are  being  developed  to
remove  nutrients  and  harmful  dissolved  inorganic
materials that may be present.

Existing wastewater treatment generally has two

or three stages (Figure 14.21):

• Primary  treatment. The  primary  treatment
stage  includes  screening,  which  removes  the
grit composed of sand, stones, and other large
particles; and sedimentation, in which much of
the  remaining  particulate  matter  (mostly  or-
ganic) settles out to form a mud-like sediment
called sludge. The sludge is piped to the digester,
and the partially clariﬁed wastewater goes on to
the  secondary  stage  of  treatment.  Primary
treatment removes 30 to 40 percent of the pol-
lutants from the wastewater.24

• Secondary  treatment. Although there are sev-
eral  methods,  the  most  common  secondary
treatment is known as activated sludge. Waste-
water from primary treatment enters the aera-
tion tank, where air is pumped in and aerobic,
or  oxygen-requiring,  bacteria  break  down
much  of  the  organic  matter  remaining  in  the
waste. The wastewater is then pumped to the
ﬁnal sedimentation tank, where sludge settles
out and is pumped to the digester. Some of the
sludge, rich in bacteria, is recycled back to the

aeration tank as “activated sludge” to act as a
starter.  Thus,  the  bacteria  are  used  over  and
over  again.  The  digester  provides  an  oxygen-
poor environment in which anaerobic bacteria,
those  that  do  not  require  oxygen,  can  break
down organic matter in the sludge from both
the  primary  and  secondary  sedimentation
tanks.  This  anaerobic  digestion  produces
methane gas, a by-product that can be used as
a fuel to help heat or cool the plant or to run
equipment. After secondary treatment, about
90  percent  of  the  organic  material  (BOD)  in
the  waste  has  been  removed.  However,  this
treatment  does  not  remove  nitrogen,  phos-
phorus,  heavy  metals,  or  some  human-made
chemicals,  such  as  solvents  and  pesticides.24
The ﬁnal part of secondary treatment is disin-
fection of the wastewater. This is usually done
with  chlorine,  but  sometimes  ozone  is  used.
The  treated  wastewater  is  usually  discharged
to  surface  waters  (rivers,  lakes,  or  the  ocean,
where  water  quality  problems  can  still  occur;
see  A  Closer  Look:  Boston  Harbor:  Cleaning
Up a National Treasure), but in some places it
is discharged to disposal wells, as for example,
in Maui, Hawaii.

Although there is vigorous tidal ac-
tion between the harbor and the bay,
the ﬂushing time is about 1 week.
The input of wastewater from the
sewage outfalls was sufﬁcient to
cause water pollution. Study of Mass-
achusetts Bay suggested that the
outfalls, if placed further offshore
where water is deeper and currents
are stronger, would lower the pollu-
tion levels in Boston Harbor.25

Moving the wastewater outfall off-

shore was deﬁnitely a step in the

right direction, but the long-term so-
lution to pollutants entering the ma-
rine ecosystem will require additional
measures. Pollutants in the water,
even when placed further offshore
with greater circulation and greater
water depth, will eventually accumu-
late and cause environmental
damage. As a result, any long-term
solution must include source reduc-
tion of pollutants. To this end, the
Boston Regional Sewage Treatment
Plan called for a new treatment plant

The city of Boston is steeped in early
American history. The names Samuel
Adams and Paul Revere immediately
come to mind in relation to this peri-
od in the late 1700s when the
colonies were struggling to obtain
freedom from Britain. In 1773, 
Samuel Adams led a group of patri-
ots aboard three British ships, dump-
ing their cargo of tea into Boston
Harbor. The issue that the patriots
were emphasizing was what they be-
lieved to be an unfair tax on tea, and
the event became known as the
“Boston Tea Party.”The tea
dumped into the harbor
by patriots in the Boston
Tea Party did not pollute
the harbor, but the grow-
ing city and dumping of
all sorts of waste eventual-
ly did. For about 300 years,
Boston harbor has been a
disposal site for dumping
of sewage, treated waste-
water, and water contami-
nated from sewer
overﬂows during storms.
Late in the twentieth cen-
tury, court orders de-
manded that measures be
taken to clean up the bay.
After studying Boston

Boston

Harbor and further off-
shore in Massachusetts
Bay, it was decided to relo-
cate the areas of discharge
of waste (called outfalls)
further offshore from Bos-
ton Harbor (Figure 14.B).
Pollution of the harbor re-
sulted because the waste
that was being placed there
moved into a small, shallow
part of Massachusetts Bay.

designed to signiﬁcantly reduce the
levels of pollutants that are dis-
charged into the bay. This acknowl-
edges that dilution by itself cannot
solve the urban waste management

problem. Today the $3.8 billion Deer
Island Sewage Treatment Plant col-
lects and treats sewage from 43
greater Boston communities. Moving
the sewage outfall offshore when

combined with source reduction of
pollutants is a positive example of
what can be done to better manage
our waste and reduce environmental
problems.25

• Advanced  treatment. Used  to  remove  nutri-
ents,  heavy  metals,  or  speciﬁc  chemicals,  the
advanced  treatment stage  may  be  required  if
higher-quality  treated  wastewater  is  needed
for particular uses, such as for wildlife habitat
or  irrigation  of  golf  courses,  parks,  or  crops.
The treated wastewater for such uses is often
referred to as reclaimed water. Methods of ad-
vanced  treatment  include  use  of  chemicals,
sand  ﬁlters,  or  carbon  ﬁlters.  After  advanced
treatment, up to 95 percent of the pollutants
in the wastewater have been removed.

A troublesome aspect of wastewater treatment is
the  handling  and  disposal  of  sludge.  Sludge  gener-
ated from industrial wastewater may contain heavy
metals, as well as other toxic materials, and is a haz-
ardous waste. Many communities now require indus-
try to pretreat their sewage to remove heavy metals
before it is sent to a municipal treatment plant.

The amount of sludge produced in the treatment
process  is  conservatively  estimated  at  about  54  to
112  g  per  person  per  day,  and  sludge  disposal  ac-
counts for 25 to 50 percent of the capital and oper-
ating cost of a treatment plant.

Sludge handling and disposal have four main ob-

jectives:26

• To  convert  the  organic  matter  to  a  relatively

stable form

liquid

• To  reduce  the  volume  of  sludge  by  removing

• To destroy or control harmful organisms
• To  produce  by-products,  the  use  or  sale  of
which reduces the cost of processing and dis-
posal of the sludge

Final  disposal  of  sludge  is  accomplished  by  in-
cineration, burial in a landﬁll, use for soil reclama-
tion,  or  ocean  dumping.  From  an  environmental
standpoint,  the  best  use  of  sludge  is  to  improve

soil  texture  and  fertility  in  areas  disturbed  by
activity, such as strip mining and poor soil conser-
vation. Although it is unlikely that all the tremen-
dous quantities of sludge generated by large metro-
politan  areas  can  ever  be  used  for  beneﬁcial
purposes, many industries, institutions, and agri-
cultural activities can take advantage of municipal
and  animal  wastes  by  converting  them 
into
resources.

Wetlands as Wastewater-
Treatment Sites
Natural and human-constructed wetlands are poten-
tially  good  places  to  treat  or  partially  treat  waste-
water or other poor-quality water. Wetland treatment
is attractive to communities that have difﬁculty pur-
chasing expensive traditional wastewater-treatment
plants  or  desire  an  alternative  to  the  traditional
plants. The states of Louisiana and Arizona, which
have  very  different  climates—warm-humid  and
hot-dry, respectively—have both had success using
wetlands to treat wastewater.

Advanced treatment of wastewater in Louisiana,
by  applying  nitrogen-  and  phosphorus-rich  waste-
water to coastal wetlands, is improving water qual-
ity as the wetland plants use these nutrients in their
life cycle. In Louisiana, use of coastal wetlands to re-
move  nutrients  has  resulted  in  considerable  eco-
nomic  savings  over  use  of  conventional  advanced
wastewater treatment.27

Near Phoenix, Arizona, human-constructed wet-
lands  are  used  to  treat  poor-quality  agricultural
wastewater  with  high  nitrogen  concentration.  The
artiﬁcial wetland is within a residential community
and consists of ponds with wetland plants and bacte-
ria that reduce the nitrogen to acceptable levels be-
fore discharging the water to a nearby river channel,
where it seeps into the ground to become a ground-
water resource.

Wastewater  renovation  from  cattle  feedlots  dif-
fers considerably from renovation of water from in-
dustrial  or  municipal  sites.  However,  the  general
principle  of  renovation  is  valid,  and  the  processes
are similar in theory.

The  return  and  renovation  processes  are  crucial
to  wastewater  recycling,  and  soil  and  rock  type,
topography, climate, and vegetation play signiﬁcant
roles.  In  the  planning  of  return  and  renovation
processes,  it  is  particularly  important  that  the  soil
be able to safely assimilate treated wastewater, that
the selected vegetation can use the nutrients in the
wastewater, and that the volume of wastewater that
can safely be applied to the area is known.29

Wastewater Renovation
The process of recycling treated liquid waste is called
the wastewater renovation and conservation cycle.
The primary processes in the cycle are the return
of  treated  wastewater  by  artiﬁcial  groundwater
recharge  at  specially  designed  basins  (i.e.,  ponds),
dry river beds, or other land, such as a forest; renova-
tion by natural puriﬁcation of wastewater as it slowly
seeps through soil, sediment, and rock to eventually
recharge the groundwater resource with clean water;
and reuse, or conservation, of the water by pumping it
out of the ground for municipal, industrial, institu-
tional, or agricultural purposes.28 Of course, not all
aspects of the cycle are equally applicable to a partic-
ular wastewater problem.

In Clayton County, Georgia, just south of Atlanta,
a large 1,460 ha (3,600 acre) land application water
renovation and conservation cycle project was initi-
ated in 1982. The project applies treated wastewater
to a pine forest by irrigation. The trees remove ni-
trogen  from  the  wastewater  as  part  of  their  life
cycle. Trees are harvested on a 20-year rotation. The
forest is part of the watershed that supplies water to
the  area;  therefore,  wastewater  is  recycled  to  be-
come part of the drinking-water supply.30

Atlantis, South Africa, has for several decades de-
veloped a plan that augments their water supply by
about  30  percent  through  artiﬁcial  recharge.  The
population of Atlantis is about 60,000 people, and
the  community  is  almost  entirely  dependent  upon
groundwater resources. This results because the cli-
mate is semiarid, and the surﬁcial deposits soak up
much  of  the  precipitation,  which  limits  natural
runoff.  Faced  with  eventual  water  shortages,  the

Wastewater Treatment

community  developed  an  innovative  groundwater
recharge  scheme.  As  the  community  was  being
developed,  it  separated  the  water  supply  into  two
components:  One  component  is  for  the  municipal
supply  for  domestic  water  use  of  homes,  and  the
second is the water supply for the industrial activi-
ties. Because these two water sources are separated,
they  go  to  different  water  treatment  plants.  From
these plants, the water is taken to recharge basins,
where it inﬁltrates into the subsurface. The inﬁltra-
tion of the industrial wastewater near the coast pro-
duces  a  recharge  mound  in  the  water  table  that
helps protect the water supply from saltwater intru-
sion. Artiﬁcial recharge basins further inland accept
stormwater  runoff  and  treated  wastewater.  The
water inﬁltrates to become part of the groundwater
system, where it is renovated (i.e., puriﬁed) by nat-
ural processes. The water is then pumped from wells
and used by the community as part of the water sup-
ply. The basics of this system are shown in Figure
14.22. The innovative part of the water renovation
scheme  for  Atlantis  is  the  separation  of  the  two
water  sources  and  subsequent  separate  treatment
and artiﬁcial recharge for different purposes.31

Southern  California,  with  its  semiarid  climate,
needs to import much of its water supply. As a re-
sult, water shortages are always a potential threat.
Development  in  Orange  County,  California,  in  re-
cent  decades,  has  been  rapid  and  extensive.  Artiﬁ-
cial recharge to augment groundwater resources in
northern Orange County has been an ongoing pro-
ject for a number of years. About 200,000 acre-feet
(2.5 × 108 m3) of water is recharged annually. Some
of  this  water,  in  recent  years,  has  included  waste-
water.  The  purpose  of  the  artiﬁcial  recharge  is  to
increase  the  water  supply  as  a  result  of  annual  in-
crease in water demands and also to improve water
quality  by  utilizing 
the  natural  puriﬁcation
processes of water as it moves through the subsur-
face environment. This combination reduces public
health  risk  from  potential  exposure  to  contami-
nated  water  or  pathogens.  In  Orange  County,  the
water district applies advanced treatment technolo-
gies to wastewater prior to injecting it into the sub-
surface through artiﬁcial recharge. The district has
built a 70-million gallons per day advanced water re-
cycling  plant  where  the  water  from  the  plant  is
recharged  through  a  spreading  facility.  The  water
can then be pumped out and reused.32

FIGURE 14.22 The wastewater renovation and conservation cycle Idealized diagram of the wastewater renovation and
conservation cycle used in Atlantis, South Africa. Wastewater from industrial sources and homes is separated and sent to different basins,
where it seeps into the ground to replenish the groundwater in a process called artiﬁcial recharge. The water is renovated (i.e., cleaned) as
it moves through the soil and rock. Some of the water is used as a barrier to inhibit saltwater intrusion, and inland wells draw the reno-
vated water to be reused.

14.7 Federal Legislation
In the United States, the mid-1990s saw much de-
bate and controversy regarding water pollution. Re-
publicans, then in control of the House of Represen-
tatives and the Senate, attempted to rewrite major
environmental laws, including the Clean Water Act
of  1972  (amended  in  1977).  Their  purpose  was  to
give industry greater ﬂexibility in choosing how to
comply with environmental regulations concerning
water  pollution.  Industry  is  in  favor  of  proposed
new  regulations  that,  in  their  estimation,  would
be  more cost-effective without causing an increase
in  environmental  degradation.  Environmentalists
viewed the attempts to rewrite the Clean Water Act
as a step backward in the nation’s decades-long ﬁght
to clean up its water resources. Apparently, the Re-
publican majority misinterpreted  the  public’s posi-
tion  on  this  issue.  Survey  after  survey  established
that there is strong support for a clean environment

in the United States today. People are willing to pay to
have clean air and clean water for this and future gen-
erations. There was a strong backlash and criticism of
steps taken to weaken environmental laws, particu-
larly as they pertain to important resources, such as
water. Thus, the debate went on. The Water Quality
Act  of  1987  established  national  policy  to  control
nonpoint sources of water pollution, but it did not go
far enough in protecting water resources.33

In July 2000, President Clinton, in defiance of
Congress,  imposed  new  water  pollution  controls
to  protect  thousands  of  streams  and  lakes  from
nonpoint  sources  of  agricultural,  industrial,  and
urban pollution. The rules are administered by the
Environmental  Protection  Agency,  which  works
with  states  and  local  communities  to  develop  de-
tailed programs with the objective of reducing pollu-
tion  to  those  streams,  rivers,  lakes,  and  estuaries
that  do  not  now  meet  the  minimum  standards  of
water quality. The rules imposed demonstrate that

nonpoint sources of water pollution are recognized
as a serious problem that is difﬁcult to regulate. The
plan will take at least 15 years to implement com-
pletely. It has been opposed for years by Congress,
as well as by some agricultural groups, the utility in-
dustry, and even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In
2001, the newly elected President Bush temporarily
suspended  some  regulations,  including  control  of
arsenic  in  water,  over  the  objections  of  many  who
were  concerned  that  some  people  were  drinking
contaminated  water.  The  primary  objections  of
those who oppose controls are that (1) the require-
ments  would  be  costly  (billions  of  dollars)  and  (2)
local and state governments are better suited to im-
plement  water  pollution  rules.  Nevertheless,  the
regulations are now in place and are another step in
water  pollution  control  measures  started  many
years ago in the United States.

14.8 What Can Be Done 
to Reduce Effects 
of Water Pollution?

This  chapter  has  documented  a  long  list  of  water
pollutants, ranging from disease-causing organisms
to  chemical  pollutants.  We  now  turn  to  what  is
needed to better address water pollution problems.
Several suggestions follow:4

• Develop  and  reﬁne  better  ways  to  evaluate
water pollution problems and their impact on
aquatic life and the health of people.

• Implement  cost-effective  new  and  innovative

water treatment technologies.

• Develop products and processes that minimize
production  of  water  pollutants  and  their  re-
lease into the environment.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About Pig Farms in North Carolina 
to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. What are the impacts of popula-
tion increase on the pig-farming
industry, and does that have 
any bearing on the pig-waste
problem? What other factors 
are important?

2. Is sustainable water manage-

ment possible on the Piedmont

of North Carolina if pig farms
continue conducting business 
as usual? If you think it is not
sustainable, what needs to 
be done?

3. How do science and values link to

future planning to manage in-
dustrial-level raising of pigs?

Summary

Water pollution is the degradation of
water quality, as measured by physi-
cal, chemical, or biological criteria.
These criteria take into considera-
tion the intended use for the water,
departure from the norm, effects on
public health, and ecological impacts.
The most serious water pollution
problem today is the lack of noncont-

aminated drinking water for billions
of people.

Surface-water pollutants have point
or nonpoint sources. The major water
pollutants are oxygen-demanding
waste, measured by biochemical oxy-
gen demand (BOD); pathogens, mea-
sured by the fecal coliform bacteria
count; nutrients that lead to eutrophi-

cation, in which overgrowth of algae
deprives water of oxygen and sunlight;
oil; toxic substances, including syn-
thetic organic and inorganic com-
pounds, heavy metals, and radioactive
materials; heat; and sediment. Acid
mine drainage refers to water with a
high concentration of sulfuric acid that
drains from some coal or metal mining

498

CHAPTER 14

Water Pollution

areas, causing surface water and
groundwater pollution.

Development of water-quality

standards in the United States has
been mandated by federal legislation
and involves setting of maximum
contaminant levels for contaminants
that might be found in our drinking
water. The major purposes of the
standards are to ensure that our

water supply is treated to remove
harmful contaminants and that
water quality is regularly tested 
and monitored.

Wastewater-treatment facilities in-
clude septic-tank sewage disposal sys-
tems and wastewater-treatment
plants. Septic-tank systems, used by
homes and small commercial and in-
dustrial activities, are very common

in the United States today. Failure of
these systems may cause signiﬁcant
pollution to groundwater resources.
Wastewater treatment plants collect
and process water from municipal
sewage systems. The use of reclaimed
water is growing fast in the United
States today, particularly in areas
where water shortages are most likely
to occur.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
As human population has grown,
particularly in large urban regions,
groundwater and surface water are
often polluted. Pollution reduces the
water resources available and makes
it necessary in some urban areas to
import water, sometimes from far
away. As human population contin-
ues to increase during the next
decades, we will need to find cre-
ative ways to avoid continual pollu-
tion of water resources that we de-
pend on. Groundwater is particularly
vulnerable and difficult to treat 
once polluted.

Earth as a System Our water re-
sources are part of complex hydro-
logic, physical, chemical, and biologi-
cal systems that are prone to change
and disturbance. When we introduce
pollutants into our surface-water or
groundwater resources, we cause fur-
ther changes to ecosystems that sup-
port people and other living things.
We have learned that we cannot do
just one thing. For example, when we
introduce toxic materials, such as
MTBE, into the groundwater, we
cause far-reaching changes to the en-
vironment. These changes often cause
further changes.

Sustainability At the very heart
of sustainability is the desire to pass
on a quality environment to future
generations. Certainly, a quality en-
vironment includes the water we
drink and use to grow our crops. It is
apparent that our present manage-
ment practices to maintain high
water quality are not sustainable.
That is, if we continue present prac-
tices, more and more of our water
resources will become contaminated
and polluted, becoming unfit for
human use. Therefore, it is of the ut-
most importance to find ways to use
water resources responsibly, in a
sustainable way. Recent regulations
and laws to restrict water pollutants
are steps in the right direction.

Hazardous Earth Processes,
Risk Assessment, and Percep-
tion The largest and most signiﬁ-
cant water pollution hazard is the lack
of noncontaminated water for billions
of people on Earth. Epidemics caused
by poor water quality and pathogenic
organisms have been nearly elimi-
nated in developed countries, but
they are still serious problems in
parts of the world where people do
not have the ﬁnancial ability to treat
water before it is consumed. We have
the perception in the United States
that our water supply is clean and free
of disease-causing agents. From time
to time, though, we learn differently,
and, although outbreaks of disease
have been isolated, there is concern

for our future supply of clean drink-
ing water.

Scientific Knowledge and Val-
ues The role of particular toxins and
pollutants in our water resources is a
science still in its infancy. In particu-
lar, we have trouble making decisions
concerning what the toxic level of a
particular chemical is and what the
effects are likely to be in the future.
How we decide to deal with living with
this uncertainty is in part a function
of our value system. We may choose to
be conservative and restrict the use of
potentially toxic chemicals, or we may
assume that our present practices will
not cause problems for future genera-
tions. We have learned in the past that
making the assumption that problems
will not result from a particular prac-
tice has been costly. For example, a
decision was recently made not to
control arsenic in groundwater used
by people in parts of California and
other areas. This decision was made
despite the fact that arsenic is known
to be very toxic. Part of the reason for
choosing not to restrict the level of
arsenic in drinking water was that
treatment of the water to remove the
arsenic would be overly costly to soci-
ety. The decision not to remove the
arsenic constitutes an experiment on
how the arsenic in the environment
will affect people and ecosystems.

Case History
Mine Near Golden, Colorado, Is Transformed into a Golf Course

An award-winning golf
course is now located on
land that was, for about 
100 years, an open-
pit mine (quarry) in
limestone rock near 
the city of Golden, 
Colorado. The mine
produced clay from lay-
ers between the lime-
stone beds to make
bricks. The bricks were
used as a building mater-
ial for buildings in the 

Denver area, including the
Colorado governor’s mansion.

The mining site included unsightly
pits with vertical limestone walls, as
well as a landﬁll for waste disposal.
The area has spectacular views of the
foothills and the Rocky Mountains.
Today, the limestone cliffs left by the
mining, with their exposed plant and
dinosaur fossils, have been trans-
formed into golf greens and fairways.
The name of the golf course is Fossil
Trace, reﬂecting its geologic heritage.
Trails lead to the best locations to see
fossils—an added incentive to visit
the area. Constructed wetlands and
three lakes store runoff of ﬂoodwa-
ter, helping protect Golden from

ﬂash ﬂoods. The reclamation project
started with the desire for a public
golf course. The mine reclamation
demonstrates that previous mines
can be reclaimed and transformed
into valuable property.

Fossil Trace Golf Club is a unique
instance of mine reclamation. How-
ever, each potential site for restora-
tion offers opportunities based on
local physical, hydrological, and bio-
logical conditions. This chapter dis-
cusses the origin of mineral deposits,
environmental consequences of min-
eral development, and sustainable
mineral use.

15.1 Minerals and Human Use
Our society depends on the availability of mineral re-
sources.1 Speciﬁcally,  consider  your  breakfast  this
morning. You probably drank from a glass made pri-
marily  of  quartz-sand;  ate  food  from  dishes  made
from clay; ﬂavored your food with salt mined from
Earth; ate fruit grown with the aid of fertilizers, such
as  potassium  carbonate  (potash)  and  phosphorus;
and  used  utensils  made  from  stainless  steel,  which
comes from processing iron ore and other minerals.
If  you  read  a  magazine  or  newspaper  while  eating,
the paper was probably made using clay ﬁllers. If the
phone rang and you answered, you were using more
than 40 minerals in the telephone. You may have lis-
tened  to  music  on  your  iPod  while  eating  or  made
your  day’s  appointments  with  your  BlackBerry.
These electronic items are made of metals and petro-
leum  products.  When  you  went  to  school  or  work,
you may have turned on a computer or other equip-
ment made largely of minerals (Figure 15.1).1–3

Minerals  are  extremely  important  to  people;  all
other things being equal, one’s standard of living in-
creases with the increased availability of minerals in
useful forms. Furthermore, the availability of mineral
resources is one measure of the wealth of a society.

Societies that have been successful in the location,
extraction, or importation and use of minerals have
grown  and  prospered.  Without  mineral  resources,
modern  technological  civilization  as  we  know  it
would not be possible.

Minerals are an important part of the U.S. econ-
omy. Selected aspects of the role of nonfuel minerals
in the 2009 U.S. economy are:4

• The value of domestic minerals produced from

mining was about $57.1 billion.

• Domestic  processed  materials  from  minerals
had  a  value  of  $454  billion,  which  is  about 
3  percent  of  the  U.S.  gross  domestic  product
(GDP) ($14,200 billion in 2009).

• The  value  of  domestic  reclaimed  metals  and
mineral  products  at  $9.3  billion  was  about 
16 percent of the value of domestic minerals
produced from mining—a significant contri-
bution.

• The  value  added  by  major  industries  such  as
construction  and  manufacturing  of  durable
goods (those goods not consumed immediately
but that wear out over time) that use processed
mineral materials was $1,900 billion, which is
about 13 percent of the GDP.

FIGURE 15.1 Minerals found in a typical office (Modiﬁed after U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1289–2006)

Minerals  can  be  considered  our  nonrenewable
heritage from the geologic past. Although new de-
posits  are  forming  from  present  Earth  processes,
these  processes  are  too  slow  to  be  of  use  to  us
today. Mineral deposits tend to be hidden in small
areas. Deposits must, therefore, be discovered; un-
fortunately,  most  of  the  easy-to-find  deposits
have  already  been  exploited.  If  our  civilization,
with  its  science  and  technology,  were  to  vanish,

future  civilizations  would  have  a  much  harder
time discovering minerals than our ancestors did.
Unlike  biological  resources,  which  are  renewable,
minerals  are  consumed  and  cannot  be  managed
with  the  assumption  that  Earth  processes  will
replace the source in a useful period of time. Recy-
cling  and  conservation  will  help  extend  our  min-
eral  resources,  but  eventually  the  supply  will  be
exhausted.

CHAPTER 15

Mineral Resources and the Environment

Resources and Reserves
Mineral resources can be deﬁned broadly as elements,
compounds,  minerals,  or  rocks  concentrated  in  a
form that can be extracted to obtain a usable com-
modity. From a practical viewpoint, this deﬁnition is
unsatisfactory because a resource will not normally
be extracted unless extraction can be accomplished
at  a  proﬁt.  A  more  pragmatic  deﬁnition  is  that  a
mineral  resource is  a  concentration  of  a  naturally
occurring material (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas) in or on
the  crust  of  Earth  in  a  form  that  can  now  or
potentially be extracted at a proﬁt. A reserve is the
portion  of  a  resource  that  is  identiﬁed  and  is
currently available to be legally extracted at a proﬁt.
The  distinction  between  resources  and  reserves,
therefore,  is  based  on  current  geologic,  economic,
and legal factors (Figure 15.2).5

Not  all  resource  categories  are  reserves  (Figure
15.2). As an analogy to help clarify this point, think
about your personal ﬁnances. Your reserves are your
liquid assets, such as money in your pocket or in the
bank,  whereas  your  resources  include  the  total  in-
come  you  can  expect  to  earn  during  your  lifetime.
This distinction is often critical to you because re-
sources are “frozen” assets or next year’s income and
cannot be used to pay this month’s bills.5

Silver’s value as a reserve can illustrate some im-
portant points about resources and reserves. Earth’s
crust contains almost 2 trillion metric tons of silver.
This is Earth’s crustal resource of silver—an amount
much larger than the annual world use, which is ap-
proximately 10,000 metric tons. If this silver existed
as  pure  metal  concentrated  into  one  large  mine,  it
would represent a supply sufﬁcient for several hun-
dred million years, at current levels of use. Most of

this silver, however, exists in extremely low concen-
trations—too low to be extracted economically with
current technology. The known reserve of silver, re-
ﬂecting  the  amount  we  could  obtain  immediately
with  known  techniques,  is  about  200,000  metric
tons, or a 20-year supply at current use levels.

Availability and Use 
of Mineral Resources
The availability of a mineral in a certain form, in a
certain concentration, and in a certain total amount
at  that  concentration  is  determined  by  Earth’s 
history—and is therefore a geologic topic. Types of
mineral resources and the limits of their availability
are  technological  and  social  questions  that  we  will
consider here.

Types  of Mineral  Resources. Some  mineral  re-
sources are necessary for life. One example is salt, or
halite  (NaCl).  Primitive  peoples  traveled  long  dis-
tances  to  obtain  salt  when  it  was  not  available  lo-
cally. Salt today is as important as ever, and it has
important medical uses as a vehicle to deliver chem-
icals, such as iodine to help prevent goiter (a thyroid
disease). The iodine is added to the salt, which most
people use on their food. Fluoride may be added to
salt to help prevent dental cavities, and medication
can be added to salt to ﬁght malaria and lymphatic
ﬁlariasis (a disﬁguring disease caused by worms that
has infected more than 120 million people, mostly
in Asia, Africa, and South America).6 Other mineral
resources,  such  as  diamonds,  are  desired  for  their
beauty, and many more are necessary for producing
and maintaining a certain level of technology.

Earth’s mineral resources can be divided into sev-

eral broad categories, based on how we use them:

• Elements  for  metal  production  and  technolo-
gy,  which  can  be  classiﬁed  according  to  their
abundance. The abundant metals include iron,
aluminum,  chromium,  manganese,  titanium,
and  magnesium.  Iron  and  aluminum  account
for about 3% (by weight) of all minerals mined
in the U.S. Scarce metals include copper, lead,
zinc, tin, gold, silver, platinum, uranium, mer-
cury, and molybdenum.

• Building  materials  such  as  aggregate sand,
gravel, and crushed stone for concrete; clay for
tile; and volcanic ash for cinder blocks to con-
struct  walls  of  buildings.  These  account  for
about  94  percent  (by  weight)  of  all  minerals
mined in the United States.

• Minerals for the chemical industry, such as the
many  minerals  used  in  the  production  of
petrochemicals, which are materials produced
from natural gas or crude oil, such as plastics.
• Minerals  for  agriculture,  such  as  fertilizers.
Phosphate  rock  accounts  for  about  1  percent
(by weight) of all minerals mined in the United
States.

When  we  think  of  mineral  resources,  we  usually
think of the metals used in structural materials, but,
in fact, with the exception of iron, the predominant
mineral resources are not metals. Consider the annual
world  consumption  of  a  few  selected  elements.
Sodium and iron are used at a rate of approximately
100 million to 1,000 million tons per year. Nitrogen,
sulfur, potassium, and calcium are used at a rate of ap-
proximately 10 million to 100 million tons per year.
These four elements are used primarily as soil condi-
tioners  or  fertilizers.  Zinc,  copper,  aluminum,  and
lead have annual world consumption rates of about
3 million to 10 million tons, whereas gold and silver
have  annual  consumption  rates  of  10,000  tons  or
less. Of the metallic minerals, iron makes up 95 per-
cent  of  all  the  metal  consumed;  nickel,  chromium,
cobalt, and manganese are used mainly in alloys of
iron,  such  as  stainless  steel,  which  are  mixtures  of
iron and other elements. Therefore, we can conclude
that  nonmetallic  mineral  resources,  with  the  excep-
tion of iron, are consumed at much greater rates than
elements used for their metallic properties.

Responses  to  Limited  Availability. The  funda-
mental  problem  associated  with  the  availability  of

Minerals and Human Use

505

mineral resources is not actual exhaustion or extinc-
tion;  rather,  it  is  the  cost  of  maintaining  an  ade-
quate reserve, or stock, within an economy, through
mining  and  recycling.  At  some  point,  the  costs  of
mining exceed the worth of the material. When the
availability of a particular mineral becomes a limita-
tion, several solutions are possible:

• Find more sources.
• Find a substitute.
• Recycle what has already been obtained.
• Use less and make more efﬁcient use of what

we have.

• Do without.

We can use a particular mineral resource in sev-
eral  ways:  rapid  consumption,  consumption  with
conservation,  or  consumption  and  conservation
with recycling. The option selected depends, in part,
on economic, political, and social criteria. However,
as more resources become limited, increased conser-
vation and recycling are occurring, and the trend to-
ward recycling is well established for metals such as
copper, lead, and aluminum.

As  the  world  population  and  the  desire  for  a
higher standard of living increase, the demand for
mineral  resources  expands  at  a  faster  and  faster
rate.  The  United  States  has  only  5  percent  of
Earth’s  population,  yet  we  consume  a  dispropor-
tionate  share  of  mineral  resources,  including  the
majority  of  the  aluminum,  copper,  and  nickel.  If 
the  world  per  capita  consumption  rate  of  these
metals  were  to  rise  to  the  U.S.  level,  production
would have to increase to several times the present
rate. Because such an increase in production is very
unlikely, afﬂuent countries will have to ﬁnd substi-
tutes for some minerals or use a smaller proportion
of the world annual production. Fortunately, these
alternatives  are  being  implemented.  For  example,
in  the  United  States,  per  capita  nonfuel  mineral
consumption  decreased 
signiﬁcantly  between
about 1980 and 2010.

Domestic supplies of many mineral resources in
the  United  States  and  other  affluent  nations  are
insufficient  for  current  use  and  must  be  supple-
mented by imports from other nations. For exam-
ple, the United States imports nearly all the graphite,
manganese, strontium, tin, platinum, and chromium
that  we  use  in  industrial  and  other  processes.  In-
dustrial countries are particularly concerned about

506

CHAPTER 15

Mineral Resources and the Environment

the possibility that the supply of a much-desired or
needed  mineral  may  become  interrupted  by  politi-
cal, economic, or military instability of the supply-
ing  nation.  The  United  States  and  many  other
countries  and  regions,  including  Western  Europe,
Japan, and, more recently, China and India, are cur-
rently dependent on a steady supply of imports to
meet  the  mineral  demand  of  industry.  Of  course,
the  fact  that  a  mineral  is  imported  into  a  country
does  not  mean  that  it  does  not  exist  within  the
country in quantities that could be mined. Rather, it
suggests that there are economic, political, or envi-
ronmental reasons that make it easier, more practi-
cal, or more desirable to import the material.

15.2 Geology of Mineral

Resources

The  geology  of  mineral  resources  is  intimately  re-
lated  to  how  Earth  works  through  plate  tectonics
and the rock cycle (see Chapters 2 and 3), and nearly
all  aspects  of  geologic  processes  are  involved  to
some  extent  in  producing  local  concentrations  of
useful materials.

Local Concentrations of Metals
The term ore is sometimes applied to natural occur-
ring minerals that can be extracted for a proﬁt. Loca-
tions  where  ore  is  found  have  anomalously  high
concentrations of these minerals. The concentration

of metal necessary for a particular mineral to be clas-
siﬁed  as  an  ore  varies  with  technology,  economics,
and politics. Before smelting (i.e., extraction of metal
by heating) was invented, the only metal ores were
those  in  which  the  metals  appeared  in  their  pure
form; gold, for example, was originally obtained as a
pure, or native, metal. Now gold mines extend deep
beneath  the  surface,  and  the  recovery  process  in-
volves  reducing  tons  of  rock  to  ounces  of  gold.  Al-
though the rock contains only a minute amount of
gold, we consider it a gold ore because we can extract
the gold proﬁtably.

The concentration factor of a metal is the ratio
of its necessary concentration for proﬁtable mining
(i.e., of its concentration in ore) to its average con-
centration  in  Earth’s  crust.  Table  15.1 lists  some
metallic elements and their average concentrations,
concentrations  in  ore,  and  concentration  factors.
Aluminum, for example, has an average concentra-
tion of about 8 percent in Earth’s crust, and needs
to be found at concentrations of about 35 percent to
be mined economically, giving it a concentration fac-
tor of about 4. Mercury, on the other hand, has an
average  concentration  of  only  a  tiny  fraction  of  1
percent  and  must  have  a  concentration  factor  of
about 10,000 to be mined economically. Neverthe-
less,  mercury  ores  are  common  in  certain  regions,
where  they  and  other  metallic  ores  are  deposited
(see  A  Closer  Look:  Plate  Tectonics  and  Minerals).
The percentage of a metal in ore (and thus the con-
centration  factor)  is  subject  to  change  as  the  de-
mand for the metal changes.

A 

Closer
Look

Plate Tectonics and Minerals

In a broadbrush approach to the ge-
ology of mineral resources, tectonic
plate boundaries are related to the
origin of such ore deposits as iron,
gold, copper, and mercury Figure
15.A. Basically, ore deposits result
from processes operating at the di-
verging and converging plate
boundaries (see Chapter 2).

The origin of metallic ore de-

posits at divergent plate boundaries
is related to the migration (i.e.,
movement) of ocean water. Cold,
dense ocean water moves down
through numerous fractures in the
basaltic rocks at oceanic ridges and
is heated by contact with or heat
from nearby molten rock (i.e.,
magma). The warm water is lighter
and more chemically active and rises
up (i.e., convects) through the frac-
tured rocks, leaching out metals. The
metals are carried in solution and
are deposited (i.e., precipitated as
metallic sulﬁdes), forming black

smokers, which are chimney-shaped
structures that emit black, mineral-
charged hot water.8 Numerous sul-
ﬁde deposits have been discovered
along oceanic ridges, and, undoubt-
edly, numerous others will be lo-
cated. These are discussed further,
along with minerals from the sea, 
in Section 15.2.

The origin of metallic ore deposits
at convergent plate boundaries is hy-
pothesized to be the result of the
partial melting of seawater-saturated
rocks of the oceanic lithosphere in a
subduction zone. The high heat and
pressure that cause the melting also
facilitate the release and movement
of metals from the partially molten
rock. These metals, which originated
in the rock, become concentrated
and ascend as more ﬂuid compo-
nents of the magma. The metal-rich
ﬂuids are eventually released (or es-
cape) from the magma, and the met-
als are deposited in a host rock.7,9

An example of metallic deposits

at subduction zones is the global
occurrence of known mercury de-
posits (Figures 15.B). All the belts of
productive deposits of mercury are
associated with volcanic systems
and are located near convergent
plate boundaries. It has been sug-
gested that the mercury, originally
found in oceanic sediments of the
crust, is distilled out of the down-
ward-plunging plate and emplaced
at a higher level above the subduc-
tion zone.8,9 The significant point,
from an economic viewpoint, is that
convergent plate junctions charac-
terized by volcanism and tectonic
activities are likely places to find
mercury. A similar argument can be
made for other ore deposits, but
there is danger in oversimplifica-
tion, insofar as many deposits are
not directly associated with plate
boundaries.

Mineral  resources  with  commercial  value  can  be
classiﬁed into several categories, based on geologic
processes of formation:

• Igneous  processes,  including  crystal  settling,
late  magmatic  process,  and  hydrothermal  re-
placement

• Metamorphic processes associated with contact

or regional metamorphism

• Sedimentary  processes,  including  accumulation
in oceanic, lake, stream, wind, and glacial envi-
ronments

• Biological processes
• Weathering  processes,  such  as  soil  formations
and in situ (i.e., in-place) concentrations of in-
soluble minerals in weathered rock debris

Table  15.2 lists  examples  of  ore  deposits  from

each of these categories.

Igneous Processes
Most ore deposits, caused by igneous processes, re-
sult from an enrichment process that concentrates
an  economically  desirable  ore  of  metals,  such  as
copper, nickel, or gold. In some cases, however, an
entire  igneous  rock  mass  contains  disseminated
crystals that can be recovered economically. Perhaps
the  best-known  example  is  the  occurrence  of  dia-
mond  crystals,  found  in  a  coarse-grained  igneous
rock called kimberlite, which characteristically occurs
as  a  pipe-shaped  body  of  rock  that  decreases  in
diameter  with  depth  (Figure  15.3,  page  510).

Almost  the  entire  kimberlite  pipe  is  the  ore  de-
posit, and the diamond crystals are disseminated
throughout the rock.7

Diamonds, which are composed of carbon, form
at very high temperatures and pressures, perhaps at
depths as great as 190 km—well below the crust of
Earth  and  into  the  mantle.  Some  kimberlite  pipes
in South Africa are believed to be as old as 2 billion
years.  Near  the  surface,  diamonds  are  not  stable
over  geologic  time  and  will  eventually  change  to
graphite (the mineral in “lead” pencils). Do not sell
your diamonds yet! The transformation won’t hap-
pen at surface temperature and pressure, and, as a
result, diamonds are metastable, remaining beauti-
ful and mysterious for periods of time of interest to
humans.  The  fact  that  the  kimberlite  pipes  are  so

old  suggests  that  they  must  be  intruded  (i.e.,
moved upward) from deep diamond-forming depth
to  near  the  surface  relatively  quickly.  If  this  were
not the case, the diamonds would have been trans-
formed to graphite.

Crystal  Settling. Concentrated  ore  deposits  can
result from igneous processes called crystal settling
that  segregate  crystals  formed  earlier  from  those
formed  later.  For  example,  as  magma  cools,  heavy
minerals  that  crystallize  early  may  slowly  sink  or
settle toward the lower part of the magma chamber,
where  they  form  concentrated  layers.  Deposits  of
chromite (i.e., ore of chromium) have formed by this
process (Figure 15.4).

Late  Magmatic  Processes  and  Hydrothermal
Replacement. Late  magmatic  processes  occur
after  most  of  the  magma  has  crystallized  and  rare
and heavy metalliferous materials in water- and gas-
rich solutions remain. This late-stage metallic solu-
tion  may  be  squeezed  into  fractures  or  settle  into
interstices (i.e., empty spaces) between earlier-formed
crystals.  Other  late-stage  solutions  form  coarse-
grained igneous rock known as  pegmatite, which is
rich in feldspar, mica, and quartz, as well as certain
rare  minerals.  Pegmatites  have  been  extensively
mined  for  feldspar,  mica,  spodumene  (i.e.,  lithium
mineral), pure quartz for silicon chips and clay that
forms from weathered feldspar.

Hydrothermal (i.e.,  hot-water)  mineral  deposits
are  a  common  type  of  ore  deposit.  They  originate
from late-stage magmatic processes and give rise to
a  variety  of  mineralization,  including  gold,  silver,
copper, mercury, lead, zinc, and other metals, as well
as  many  nonmetallic  minerals.  The  hydrothermal
solutions that form ore deposits are mineralizing
fluids that migrate through a host rock, crystalliz-
ing as veins or small dikes (Figure 15.5). The min-
eral  material  is  either  produced  directly  from  the 
igneous  parent  rock  or  altered  by  metamorphic
processes,  as  magmatic  solutions  intrude  into  the
surrounding  rock.  (Alteration  by  metamorphic
processes, called contact metamorphism, is discussed
with metamorphic processes, later in this chapter.)
Many hydrothermal deposits cannot be traced to a
parent igneous rock mass, however, and their origin

Geology of Mineral Resources

511

remains  unknown.  It  is  speculated  that  circulating
groundwater,  heated  and  enriched  with  minerals
after  contact  with  deeply  buried  magma,  might  be
responsible for some of these deposits.7,8

Hydrothermal deposits are of two types: cavity-
ﬁlling  and  replacement.  Cavity-ﬁlling  deposits are
formed when hydrothermal solutions migrate along
openings  in  rocks  (e.g.,  fracture  systems,  pore
spaces,  bedding  planes)  and  precipitate  (i.e.,  crys-
tallize)  ore  minerals.  Replacement  deposits form  as
hydrothermal  solutions  react  with  the  host  rock,
forming  a  zone  in  which  ore  minerals  precipitate
from the mineralizing ﬂuids and replace part of the
host  rock.  Although  replacement  deposits  are  be-
lieved  to  dominate  at  higher  temperatures  and
pressures than cavity-ﬁlling deposits, both may be
found  in  close  association  as  one  grades  into  the
other; that is, the ﬁlling of an open fracture by pre-
cipitation  from  hydrothermal  solutions  may  occur
simultaneously  with  replacement  of  the  rock  that
lines the fracture.8

Hydrothermal replacement processes are signiﬁ-
cant because, excluding some iron and nonmetallic
deposits,  they  have  produced  some  of  the  world’s
largest and most important mineral deposits. Some
of these deposits result from a massive, nearly com-
plete  replacement  of  host  rock  with  ore  minerals
that  terminate  abruptly;  others  form  thin  replace-
ment zones along ﬁssures; and still others form dis-
seminated  replacement  deposits  that  may  involve
huge amounts of relatively low-grade ore.7,8

CHAPTER 15

Mineral Resources and the Environment

The actual sequence of geologic events leading to
the  development  of  a  hydrothermal  ore  deposit  is
usually complex. Consider, for example, the tremen-
dous,  disseminated  copper  deposits  of  northern
Chile. The actual mineralization is thought to be re-
lated to igneous activity, faulting, and folding that
occurred 60 million to 70 million years ago. The ore
deposit is an elongated, tabular mass along a highly
sheared (i.e., fractured) zone separating two types of
granitic  rock.  The  concentration  of  copper  results
from a number of factors:

• A source igneous rock supplied the copper.
• The  ﬁssure  zone  tapped  the  copper  supply
and facilitated movement of the mineralizing
ﬂuids.

• The  host  rock  was  altered  and  fractured,
preparing  it  for  deposition  and  replacement
processes that produced the ore.

• The copper was leached and redeposited again
by meteoric water, which further concentrated
the ore.7,8

Metamorphic Processes
Contact Metamorphism. Ore deposits are often
found along the contact between igneous rocks and
the  surrounding  rocks  they  intrude.  This  area  is
characterized by contact metamorphism, caused by
the  heat,  pressure,  and  chemically  active  ﬂuids  of
the cooling magma interacting with the surrounding
rock, called country rock, or host rock. The width of
the contact metamorphic zone varies with the type
of country rock, as shown in Figure 15.5. The zone
is usually thickest in limestone because limestone is
more reactive: The release of carbon dioxide (CO2)
increases the mobility of reactants. The zone is gen-
erally  thinnest  for  shale  because  the  ﬁne-grained
texture  retards  the  movement  of  hot,  chemically
active  solutions,  and  the  zone  is  intermediate  for
sandstone. As we have already mentioned, some of
the mineral deposits that form in contact areas orig-
inate from the magmatic ﬂuids and some from reac-
tions of these ﬂuids with the country rock.

Regional  Metamorphism. Metamorphism  can
also result from regional increase of temperature and
pressure associated with deep burial of rocks or tec-
tonic  activity.  This  regional  metamorphism can

change the mineralogy and texture of the preexisting
rocks,  producing  ore  deposits  of  asbestos,  talc,
graphite, and other valuable nonmetallic deposits.7–9
Metamorphism has been suggested as a possible
origin of some hydrothermal ﬂuids. It is a particu-
larly likely cause in high-temperature, high-pressure
zones,  where  ﬂuids  might  be  produced  and  forced
out into the surrounding rocks to form replacement
or  cavity-ﬁlling  deposits.  For  example,  the  native
copper found along the top of ancient basalt ﬂows in
the  Michigan  copper  district  was  apparently  pro-
duced  by  metamorphism  and  alteration  of  the
basalt, which released the copper and other materi-
als that produced the deposits.7–9

Our  discussion  of  igneous  and  metamorphic
processes  has  focused  primarily  on  ore  deposits.
However,  igneous  and  metamorphic  processes  are
also responsible for producing a good deal of stone
used  in  the  construction  industry.  Granite,  basalt,
marble (i.e., metamorphosed limestone), slate (i.e.,
metamorphosed  shale),  and  quartzite  (i.e.,  meta-
morphosed sandstone), along with other rocks, are
quarried  to  produce  crushed  rock  and  dimension
stone in the United States. Stone is used in many as-
pects  of  construction  work,  and  many  people  are
surprised to learn that, in total value, with the ex-
ception of iron and steel, the stone industry is one
of  the  largest  nonfuel  mineral  industries  in  the
United States (Table 15.2).4

Sedimentary Processes
Sedimentary processes are often signiﬁcant in con-
centrating economically valuable materials in sufﬁ-
cient  amounts  for  extraction.  As  sediments  are
transported, wind and running water help segregate
the sediment by size, shape, and density. Thus, the
best sand or sand and gravel deposits for construc-
tion purposes are those in which the ﬁner materials
have been removed by water or wind. Sand dunes,
beach deposits, and deposits in stream channels are
good examples.

Sand  and  Gravel. The  U.S.  sand  and  gravel  in-
dustry in 2010 amounted to about $7 billion, and,
by  volume  mined  (about  800  million  tons).  It  is
one of the largest nonfuel mineral industries in the
United States. Currently, most sand and gravel are
obtained  from  river  channels  and  water-worked

glacial  deposits.  The  United  States  now  produces
more sand and gravel than it needs.

Environmental  restrictions  on  extraction  are
causing  sand  and  gravel  operations  to  move  away
from areas with high population density, and short-
ages of sand and gravel are expected to increase as
zoning  and  land  development  restrict  locations
where they may be extracted. Extraction from river
channels  and  active  ﬂoodplains  can  cause  degrada-
tion to the river environment, and objections to river
extraction  operations  are  becoming  more  common.

Placer Deposits. Stream processes transport and
sort all types of materials according to size and den-
sity. Therefore, if the bedrock in a river basin con-
tains  heavy  metals  such  as  gold,  streams  draining
the  basin  may  concentrate  heavy  metals  to  form
placer deposits (i.e., ore formed by deposit of sedi-
ments) in areas where there is reduced turbulence or
velocity of ﬂow, such as between particles on rifﬂes,
in open crevices or fractures at the bottoms of pools,
or at the inside curves of bends (Figure 15.6). Placer

mining  of  gold—known  as  a  “poor  man’s  method”
because a miner needed only a shovel, a pan, and a
strong  back  to  work  the  streamside  claim—helped
to  stimulate  settlement  of  California,  Alaska,  and
other areas of the United States. Furthermore, the
gold in California attracted miners who acquired the
expertise necessary to locate and develop other re-
sources in the western conterminous United States
and  Alaska.  Placer  deposits  of  gold  and  diamonds
have  also  been  concentrated  by  coastal  processes,
primarily wave action. Beach sands and near-shore
deposits are mined in Africa and other places.

Evaporite  Deposits. Rivers  and  streams  that
empty  into  the  oceans  and  lakes  carry  tremendous
quantities  of  dissolved  material  derived  from  the
weathering of rocks. From time to time, geologically
speaking, a shallow marine basin may be isolated by
tectonic activity (i.e., uplift) that restricts circulation
and  facilitates  evaporation.  In  other  cases,  climatic
variations during the ice ages produced large inland
lakes with no outlets, which eventually dried up. In
either case, as evaporation progresses, the dissolved
materials precipitate, forming a wide variety of com-
pounds,  minerals,  and  rocks  called  evaporite de-
posits that have important commercial value.

Most evaporite deposits can be grouped into one
of three types: marine evaporites (solids)—potassium
and  sodium  salts,  calcium  carbonate,  gypsum,  and
anhydrite;  nonmarine  evaporites (solids)—sodium
and calcium carbonate, sulfate, borate, nitrate, and
limited iodine and strontium compounds; and brines
(liquids derived from wells, thermal springs, inland
salt  lakes,  and  seawaters)—bromine,  iodine,  calcium
chloride, and magnesium. Heavy metals (e.g., copper,
lead, zinc) associated with brines and sediments in the
Red  Sea,  Salton  Sea,  and  other  areas  are  important
resources that may be exploited in the future. Exten-
sive  marine  evaporite  deposits  exist  in  the  United
States  (Figure  15.7).  The  major  deposits  are  halite
(i.e.,  common  salt,  NaCl),  gypsum  (CaSO4 • 2H2O),
anhydrite  (CaSO4),  and 
limestone
(CaCO3).  Limestone,  gypsum,  and  anhydrite  are
present  in  nearly  all  marine  evaporite  basins,  and
halite  and  potassium  minerals  are  found  in  a  few.
Evaporite materials are widely used in industry and
agriculture.11

thickness of several thousand meters. The evaporites
represent the product of evaporation of seawater in
isolated  shallow  basins  with  restricted  circulation.
Within many marine evaporite basins, the different
deposits  are  arranged  in  broad  zones  that  reﬂect
changes in salinity and other factors controlling the
precipitation of evaporites; that is, different materi-
als may be precipitated at the same time in different
parts of the evaporite basin. Halite, for example, is
precipitated in areas where the brine is more saline,
and  gypsum  is  precipitated  where  it  is  less  saline.
Economic deposits of potassium evaporite minerals
are relatively rare but may form from highly concen-
trated brines.

Nonmarine evaporite deposits form by evapora-
tion  of  lakes  in  a  closed  basin.  Tectonic  activity,
such as faulting, can produce an isolated basin with
internal drainage and no outlet. However, to main-
tain a favorable environment for evaporite mineral
precipitation,  the  tectonic  activity  must  continue

to  uplift  barriers  across  possible  outlets  or  lower
the  basin  ﬂoor  faster  than  sediment  can  raise  it.
Even under these conditions, economic deposits of
evaporites will not form unless sufﬁcient dissolved
salts have washed into the basin by surface runoff
from surrounding highlands (Figure 15.8). Finally,
even if all favorable environmental criteria are pre-
sent,  including  an  isolated  basin  with  sufﬁcient
runoff  and  dissolved  salts,  valuable  nonmarine
evaporates,  such  as  sodium  carbonate  or  borate,
will not form unless the geology of the highlands
surrounding the basin is also favorable and yields
runoff with sufﬁcient quantities of the desired ma-
terial in solution.11

Some evaporite beds are compressed by overly-
ing  rocks  and  mobilized,  and  then  they  pierce  or
intrude  the  overlying  rocks.  Intrusions  of  salt,
called  salt  domes,  are  quite  common  in  the  Gulf
Coast  of  the  United  States  and  are  also  found  in
northwestern Germany, Iran, and other areas. Salt

domes  in  the  Gulf  Coast  are  economically  impor-
tant for two reasons:

• They  are  a  good  source  for  nearly  pure  salt.
Some have extensive deposits of elemental sul-
fur (Figure 15.9).

• Some have oil reserves on their ﬂanks.

Salt domes are also environmentally important as
possible  permanent  disposal  sites  for  radioactive
waste, although, because salt domes tend to be mo-
bile, their suitability as disposal sites for hazardous
wastes must be seriously questioned.

Evaporites  from  brine  resources  of  the  United
States are substantial (Table 15.3), assuring that no
shortage is likely for a considerable period of time.
But  many  evaporites  will  continue  to  have  a  place
value because transportation of these mineral com-
modities increases their price, so continued discov-
eries of high-grade deposits closer to where they will
be consumed remains an important goal.11

Biological Processes
Organisms are able to form many kinds of minerals,
such as the various calcium and magnesium carbon-
ate  minerals  in  shells  and  calcium  phosphate  in
bones. Some of these minerals cannot be formed in-
organically in the biosphere. Thirty-one different bi-
ologically  produced  minerals  have  been  identiﬁed.
Minerals of biological origin contribute signiﬁcantly
to sedimentary deposits.12

An  interesting  example  of  mineral  deposits  pro-
duced by biological processes is phosphates associated
with  sedimentary  marine  deposition.  Phosphorus-
rich sedimentary rocks are fairly common in some of
the  western  states,  as  well  as  in  Tennessee,  North
Carolina,  and  Florida.  The  common  phosphorus-
bearing mineral  in  these  rocks  is  apatite,  a  calcium
phosphate associated with bones and teeth. Fish and
other marine organisms extract the phosphate from
seawater  to  form  apatite,  and  the  mineral  deposit
results  from  sedimentary  accumulations  of  the

phosphate-rich  ﬁsh  bones  and  teeth.  The  richest
phosphate mine in the world, known as “Bone Valley,”
is  located  about  40  km  east  of  Tampa,  Florida
(Figure 15.10). The deposit is marine sedimentary
rocks composed in part of fossils of marine animals
that  lived  10  to  15  million  years  ago,  when  Bone
Valley was the bottom of a shallow sea. That deposit
has  supplied  as  much  as  one-third  of  the  world’s
phosphate production.

Another important source of phosphorus is guano
(i.e., bird feces), which accumulates where there are
large colonies of nesting sea birds and a climate arid
enough  for  the  guano  to  dry  to  a  rocklike  mass.
Thus,  the  formation  of  one  of  the  major  sources 
of phosphorus depends upon unique biological and
geographical conditions.

Weathering Processes
Weathering  is  responsible  for  concentrating  some
materials  to  the  point  at  which  they  can  be  ex-
tracted  at  a  proﬁt.  Weathering  processes  can  pro-
duce residual ore deposits in the weathered material
and provide secondary enrichment of low-grade ore.

Residual Ore Deposits. Intensive weathering of
rocks and soils can produce residual deposits of the
less  soluble  materials,  which  may  have  economic
value.  For  example,  intensive  weathering  of  some
rocks forms a type of soil known as laterite (a resid-
ual  soil  derived  from  aluminum-  and  iron-rich  ig-
neous rocks). The weathering processes concentrate
relatively  insoluble  hydrated  oxides  of  aluminum
and iron, while more soluble elements, such as sil-
ica,  calcium,  and  sodium,  are  selectively  removed
by  soil  and  biological  processes.  If  sufﬁciently 
concentrated, residual aluminum oxide forms an alu-
minum  ore  known  as  bauxite (Figure  15.11).  Im-
portant nickel and cobalt deposits are also found in
laterite  soils,  developed  from  ferromagnesian-rich
igneous rocks.13

Insoluble  ore  deposits,  such  as  native  gold,  are
generally residual, meaning that unless they are re-
moved  by  erosion,  they  accumulate  in  weathered
rock  and  soil.  Accumulation  of  the  insoluble  ore
minerals is favored where the parent rock is a rela-
tively  soluble  material,  such  as  limestone  (Figure
15.12). Care must be taken in evaluating a residual
weathered  rock  or  soil  deposit  because  the  near-
surface concentration may be a much higher grade
than ore in the parent, unweathered rocks.

Secondary  Enrichment. Weathering  is  also  in-
volved in secondary enrichment processes to produce
sulﬁde  ore  deposits  from  low-grade  primary  ore.

Hydrothermal

FIGURE 15.12 Residual ore deposit How an ore deposit
of insoluble minerals might form by weathering and formation of
a residual soil. As the limestone that contained the deposit
weathered, the ore minerals became concentrated in the residual
soil. (From Foster, R. J.  1983. General Geology, 4th ed. Columbus,
OH: Charles E. Merrill)

Near  the  surface,  primary  ore  containing  such
minerals  as  iron,  copper,  and  silver  sulfides  is  in
contact with slightly acid soil water in an oxygen-
rich  environment.  As  the  sulfides  are  oxidized,
they are dissolved, forming solutions rich in sulfu-
ric acid and in silver and copper sulfate; these so-
lutions  migrate  downward,  producing  a  leached
zone devoid of ore minerals. Figure 15.13 shows a
primary ore that has already undergone oxidation
and  leaching.  Below  the  leached  zone,  oxidation
continues,  as  the  sulfate  solutions  continue  to
move  toward  the  groundwater  table.  Below  the
water table, if oxygen is no longer available, the so-
lutions  are  deposited  as  sulfides,  increasing  the
metal content of the primary ore as much as ten-
fold.  In  this  way,  low-grade  primary  ore  is  ren-
dered  more  valuable,  and  high-grade  primary  ore
is made even more attractive.7,8

FIGURE 15.13 Secondary enrichment Typical zones that
form during secondary enrichment processes. Sulﬁde ore minerals in
the primary ore vein are oxidized and altered and then are leached
from the oxidized zone and redeposited in the enriched zone. The
iron oxide cap is generally a reddish color and may be helpful in lo-
cating ore deposits that have been enriched. (From Foster, R. J. 1983.
General geology, 4th ed. Columbus, OH: Charles E. Merrill)

The  presence  of  a  residual  iron  oxide  cap  at  the
surface indicates the possibility of an enriched ore
below, but it is not always conclusive. Of particular
importance to the formation of a zone of secondary
enrichment  is  the  presence  in  the  primary  ore  of
iron sulﬁde (e.g., pyrite). Without it, secondary en-
richment seldom takes place because iron sulﬁde in
the  presence  of  oxygen  and  water  forms  sulfuric
acid, which is a necessary solvent. Another factor fa-
voring development of a secondary-enrichment ore
deposit is the primary ore being sufﬁciently perme-
able to allow water and solutions to migrate freely
downward.  Given  a  primary  ore  that  meets  these
criteria, the reddish iron oxide cap probably does in-
dicate that secondary enrichment has taken place.7,8
Several  disseminated  copper  deposits  have  be-
come economically successful because of secondary
enrichment,  which  concentrates  dispersed  metals.
For  example,  secondary  enrichment  of  a  dissemi-
nated  copper  deposit  at  Miami,  Arizona,  increased
the grade of the ore from less than 1 percent copper
in the primary ore to as much as 5 percent in some
localized zones of enrichment.7,8

Other Minerals from the Sea
Mineral  resources  in  seawater  or  on  the  bottom  of
the ocean are vast and, in some cases, such as mag-
nesium, nearly unlimited. In the United States, mag-
nesium was ﬁrst extracted from seawater in 1940. By
1972, one company in Texas produced 80 percent of
our domestic magnesium, using seawater as its raw
material  source.  Today,  one  company  in  Utah  ex-
tracts magnesium from Great Salt Lake brines.

The deep-ocean ﬂoor may eventually be the site of
a  mineral  rush.  Identiﬁed  deposits  include  massive
sulﬁde deposits associated with hydrothermal vents,
manganese oxide nodules, and cobalt-enriched man-
ganese crusts.

Sulfide Deposits. Massive sulﬁde deposits contain-
ing zinc, copper, iron, and trace amounts of silver are
produced  at  divergent  plate  boundaries  (i.e.,  oceanic
ridges)  by  the  forces  of  plate  tectonics.  Pressure  cre-
ated  by  several  thousand  meters  of  water  at  ridges
forces  cold  seawater  deep  into  numerous  rock  frac-
tures, where it is heated by upwelling magma to tem-
peratures as high as 350°C. The pressure of the heated
water  produces  vents  known  as  black  smokers,  from
which  the  hot,  dark-colored,  mineral-rich  water
emerges as hot springs (Figure 15.14). Circulating sea-
water leaches the surrounding rocks, removing metals
that  are  deposited  when  the  mineral-rich  water  is
ejected into the cold sea. Sulﬁde minerals precipitate
near the vents, forming massive towerlike formations
that are rich in metals. The hot vents are of particular
biological signiﬁcance because they support a unique
assemblage  of  animals,  including  giant  clams,  tube-
worms,  and  white  crabs.  Ecosystems  including  these
animals base their existence on sulﬁde compounds ex-
truded from black smokers, existing through a process
called  chemosynthesis,  as  opposed  to  photosynthesis,
which supports all other known ecosystems on Earth.
The  extent  of  sulﬁde  mineral  deposits  along
oceanic ridges is poorly known, and, although leases
to  some  possible  deposits  are  being  considered,  it
seems unlikely that such deposits will be extracted
at a proﬁt in the near future. Certainly, potential en-
vironmental  degradation,  such  as  decreased  water
quality and sediment pollution, will have to be care-
fully evaluated prior to any mining activity.

Study of the formation of massive sulﬁde deposits
at  oceanic  ridges  is  helping  geologists  understand
some of the mineral deposits on land. For example,

massive sulﬁde deposits being mined in Cyprus are
believed to have formed at an oceanic ridge and to
have been later uplifted to the surface.

Manganese  Oxide  Nodules. Manganese  oxide
nodules (Figure  15.15)  cover  vast  areas  of  the
deep-ocean ﬂoor. They contain manganese (24 per-
cent) and iron (14 percent), with secondary copper
(1 percent), nickel (1 percent), and cobalt (0.25 per-
cent). Nodules are found in the Atlantic Ocean off
Florida,  but  the  richest  and  most  extensive  accu-
mulations occur in large areas of the northeastern,
central, and southern Paciﬁc, where they cover 20
to 50 percent of the ocean ﬂoor.14

Manganese oxide nodules are usually discrete but
are  welded  together  locally  to  form  a  continuous
pavement.  Although  they  are  occasionally  found
buried in sediment, nodules are usually surﬁcial de-
posits  on  the  seabed.  Their  size  varies  from  a  few

FIGURE 15.15 Manganese oxide nodule from the

metallic deposits and ring structure. The diameter of the nodule is

520

CHAPTER 15

millimeters to a few tens of centimeters in diameter;
many are marble to baseball sized. Composed primar-
ily of concentric layers of manganese and iron oxides,
mixed with a variety of other materials, each nodule
formed around a nucleus of a broken nodule, a frag-
ment of volcanic rock, or, sometimes, a fossil. The esti-
mated rate of nodular growth is 1 to 4 mm per million
years. The nodules are most abundant in those parts of
the ocean where sediment accumulation is at a mini-
mum, generally at depths of 5 to 7 km.8,14

The origin of the nodules is not well understood;
presumably, nodules might form in several ways. The
most probable theory is that they form from material
weathered  from  the  continents  and  transported  by
rivers to the oceans, where ocean currents carry the
material  to  the  deposition  site  in  the  deep-ocean
basins.  The  minerals  from  which  the  nodules  form
may also derive from submarine volcanism or may be
released  during  physical  and  biochemical  processes
and reactions that occur near the water–sediment in-
terface during and after deposition of the sediments.14
Mining of manganese oxide nodules involves lift-
ing the nodules off the bottom and up to the mining
ship; this may be done by using suction or scraper
equipment. Although mining of the nodules appears
to be technologically feasible, production would be
expensive compared to mining manganese on land.
In addition, there are uncertainties concerning own-
ership  of  the  nodules,  and  nodule  mining  would
cause  signiﬁcant  damage  to  the  seaﬂoor  and  local
water quality, raising environmental concerns.7

Cobalt-Enriched  Manganese  Crusts. Oceanic
crusts rich in cobalt and manganese are present in
the  mid-  and  southwest  Paciﬁc,  on  ﬂanks  of
seamounts, volcanic ridges, and islands. Cobalt con-
tent varies with water depth; the maximum concen-
tration of about 2.5 percent is found at water depths
of  1  to  2.5  km.  Thickness  of  the  crust  averages
about 2 cm. The processes of formation are not well
understood. Both the nature and the extent of the
crusts, which also contain nickel, platinum, copper,
and molybdenum, are being studied by U.S. Geologi-
cal Survey scientists.15

Commercial  mining  of  the  seabed  has  not  been
seriously considered for several decades as other de-
posits of metals (e.g., nickel) on land at several locali-
ties has proved to be both easier to extract and thus
less expensive to obtain. However, as metals become
more scarce, we will probably again look to the seabed.

15.3 Environmental Impact 

of Mineral Development

Many  scientists  and  other  observers  fear  that,  as
population  increases  place  more  demands  on  min-
eral  resources,  the  world  will  face  a  resource  crisis.
Furthermore,  this  crisis  will  come  at  a  time  when
Earth may be close to the limit of its ability to absorb
mineral-related pollution of air, water, land, and bio-
logical resources.7 With this possibility in mind, we
will discuss environmental impacts related to nonen-
ergy mineral development. Development of minerals
as energy sources is discussed in Chapter 16.

The environmental impact of mineral exploitation
depends on factors such as mining procedures, local
hydrologic conditions, climate, rock types, size of op-
eration, topography, and many more interrelated fac-
tors. Furthermore, the impact varies with the stage of
development  of  the  resource.  The  exploration  and
testing stage involves considerably less environmental
impact than the extraction and processing stages. In
the United States, the time period from discovery to
mine production may be several years or longer, due,
in part, to environmental concerns. In countries that
have  less  environmental  control,  the  time  from  dis-
covery to production may be much shorter. However,
forgoing environmental control can lead to signiﬁcant
damage to the air, water, land, and ecosystems.

Impact of Mineral Exploration 
and Testing
Exploration  and  testing  activities  for  mineral  de-
posits  vary  from  collecting  and  analyzing  data 
gathered  by  remote  sensing  to  ﬁeldwork  involving
surface  mapping,  drilling,  and  gathering  of  geo-
chemical  and  geophysical  data.  In  general,  explo-
ration  has  a  minimal  impact  on  the  environment,
provided that care is taken in sensitive areas, such
as  some  arid  lands,  marshlands,  and  permafrost
areas  (i.e.,  areas  underlain  by  permanently  frozen
ground). Some arid lands are covered by a thin layer
of pebbles over several centimeters of ﬁne silt. The
layer of pebbles, called desert pavement, protects the
ﬁner  material  from  wind  erosion.  When  the  pave-
ment is disturbed by road building or other activity,
the  ﬁne  silts  may  be  eroded,  impairing  physical,
chemical, and biological properties of the soil in the
immediate  environment  and  scarring  the  land  for
many years. In other areas, such as marshlands and

Impact of Mineral Extraction 
and Processing
Mining and processing mineral resources are likely to
have  a  considerable  adverse  impact  on  land,  water,
air,  and  biological  resources.  In  addition  to  their 
direct environmental effects, these activities can ini-
tiate adverse social impacts on the environment by
increasing  the  demand  for  housing  and  services  in
mining areas. These effects are part of the price we
pay for the beneﬁts of mineral consumption. It is un-
realistic  to  expect  that  we  can  mine  our  resources
without affecting some aspect of the local environ-
ment, but we must keep environmental degradation
to a minimum. Minimizing environmental degrada-
tion can be very difﬁcult because, while the demand
for minerals continues to increase, deposits of highly
concentrated minerals are decreasing. Therefore, to
provide more minerals, we are developing larger op-
erations  to  mine  ever-poorer  deposits.  In  the  year
2000, the cumulative land use for mining on Earth
was  approximately  0.2  percent  of  the  land  area,  or
about 300,000 km2 (115,830 mi2).

Currently, in the United States, less than 0.3 per-
cent,  or  29,000  square  km2 (11,200  mi2),  of  the
total  land  area  is  dedicated  to  surface  mines  and
quarries.  In  comparison,  wilderness,  wildlife,  and
national park lands cover approximately 500,000 km2
(193,050  mi2)  of  land.  However,  environmental

degradation tends to extend beyond the excavation
and surface plant areas of both surface and subsur-
face  mines.  Large  mining  operations  change  the
topography by removing material in some areas and
dumping waste in others. At best, these actions pro-
duce  severe  aesthetic  degradation;  often  they  pro-
duce signiﬁcant environmental degradation as well.
The  impact  of  a  single  mining  operation  is  a  local
phenomenon, but numerous local occurrences even-
tually constitute a larger problem.

Waste from Mines. In the United States, approxi-
mately 60 percent of the land dedicated to mining is
used for mineral extraction. The remaining 40 percent
is used for waste disposal. Most of the waste is over-
burden, the rock removed to get to the ore. This is an
enormous  waste-disposal  problem,  representing
40  percent of all of the solid waste generated in the
country.7 During  the  past  100  years  or  so,  an  esti-
mated 50 billion tons of mining waste has accumu-
lated in the United States, and the annual production
of mining waste is 1 billion to 2 billion tons.16

Types  of Mining  and  Their  Impact. A  major
practical  issue  in  mining  is  determining  whether
surface or subsurface mines should be developed in
a particular area. Surface mining is more economical
but  has  more  direct  environmental  effects.  The
trend, in recent years, has moved away from subsur-
face  mining  and  toward  large,  open-pit  surface
mines, such as the Bingham Canyon copper mine in
Utah (Figure 15.16). This mine is one of the world’s

largest human-made excavations, cov-
ering nearly 8 km2 (3 mi2) to a maxi-
mum depth of nearly 800 m (2,625 ft).
Sometimes,  leaching  is  used  as  a
mining  technique.  Leaching  is  the
process of dissolving materials by per-
colating  liquid  through  a  deposit.  For
example,  some  gold  deposits  contain
such ﬁnely disseminated gold that ex-
traction  by  conventional  methods  is
not  proﬁtable.  For  some  of  these  de-
posits, a process known as heap leaching
is used. A dilute cyanide solution, which
is applied by sprinklers over a heap of
crushed gold ore, dissolves the gold as it
seeps through the ore. The gold-bearing
solutions are collected in a plastic-lined
pond  and  treated  to  recover  the  gold.
Because cyanide is extremely toxic, the
mining  process  must  be  carefully  con-
trolled  and  monitored.  If  an  accident
occurs, the process has the potential to
create a serious groundwater pollution
problem.  Research  is  ongoing  to  de-
velop in-place cyanide leaching to elimi-
nate  the  need  for  removing  ore  from
the  ground.  However,  controlling  and
monitoring  the  leaching  solution  will
still present a difﬁcult problem.17

Water Pollution. Water resources are
vulnerable to degradation from mining.
Surface drainage is often altered at mine
sites, and runoff from precipitation may
inﬁltrate  waste  material,  leaching  out
trace elements and minerals. Trace ele-
ments leached from mining wastes and
concentrated  in  water,  soil,  or  plants
may be toxic, causing diseases in people
and other animals that drink the water,
eat the plants, or use the soil. These potentially harm-
ful  trace  elements  include  cadmium,  cobalt,  copper,
lead,  molybdenum,  and  zinc.  The  white  streaks  in
Figure 15.17 are mineral deposits apparently leached
from the tailings of a zinc mine in Colorado. Similar-
looking  deposits  can  cover  rocks  in  rivers  for  many
kilometers downstream from some mining areas. Spe-
cially  constructed  ponds  to  collect  polluted  runoff
from mines can help, but they cannot be expected to
eliminate all problems.

FIGURE 15.17 Runoff from mine tailings A zinc mine in Colorado. The
white streaks (from the Eagle Mine) are mineral deposits apparently leached from
tailings. Many sites such as this one have resulted from past mining practices in
the United States that are not allowed today. Mining stopped in 1979 and the site
has been remediated. The Eagle River near the bottom of the photograph has 
improved water quality. Plans are  underway to develop a high-end ski resort.
(Edward A. Keller)

Groundwater may also be polluted by mining op-
erations when waste comes into contact with slow-
moving subsurface waters. Surface-water inﬁltration
or  groundwater  movement  through  mining  waste
piles  causes  leaching  of  sulﬁde  minerals  that  may
pollute groundwater. The polluted groundwater may
eventually  seep  into  streams  and  pollute  surface
water. Groundwater problems are particularly trou-
blesome because reclamation of polluted groundwa-
ter is very difﬁcult and expensive.

Environmental Impact of Mineral Development

523

Abandoned mines can cause serious problems. For
example, subsurface mining for lead and zinc in the
Tri-State  area  of  Kansas,  Missouri,  and  Oklahoma
started  in  the  late  nineteenth  century.  Although  it
ceased in some areas in the 1960s, it has caused seri-
ous water pollution problems since then. The mines,
extending  to  depths  of  100  m  (330  ft)  below  the
water table, were pumped dry when the mines were
in production. Since mining stopped, however, some
mines  have  ﬂooded  and  overﬂowed  into  nearby
creeks. The water is very acidic; the sulﬁde minerals
in  the  mine  react  with  oxygen  and  groundwater  to
form  sulfuric  acid,  a  problem  known  as  acid  mine
drainage (see A Closer Look: Acid Mine Drainage, in
Chapter  14).  The  problem  was  so  severe  in  the  Tar
Creek area of Oklahoma that, in 1982, the Environ-
mental  Protection  Agency  designated  it  as  the
nation’s foremost hazardous waste site. Another ex-
ample  of  acid  mine  drainage  is  in  Butte,  Montana,
where  the  Berkeley  Pit,  a  copper  strip  mine  more
than 200 m (656 ft) deep, is ﬁlling with acidic, toxic
water and forming a lake (Figure 15.18). Pumps that
kept the pit dry were turned off when the mine was
closed in 1982. Some people think the lake is sure to
be a tourist attraction, but to others, it is a growing
threat to the environment. Wildfowl in the area have
to be scared away; birds that land in the lake drink

water The Berkeley Pit near Butte, Montana, a polluted
lake in a closed copper mine. (Calvin Larsen/Photo

the  water  and  die.  There  is  increasing  concern  that
the lake may someday leak and pollute groundwater
in  the  Butte  area.18 Plans  were  developed  in  the
1990s to clean up the site, and they included a facility
to treat contaminated water that started up in 2003.
Acid  mine  drainage,  in  some  instances,  may  be
linked with tourism and skiing. The link results be-
cause ski resorts, such as those in mining districts of
Colorado, use artiﬁcial snow makers, both early and
late  in  the  season,  when  natural  snowfall  is  less
likely. Making snow requires water, and, when water
is withdrawn from rivers contaminated by acid mine
drainage, the pollution may spread to the land when
the snow melts. Ski resorts may face a no-win situa-
tion. If they withdraw acid-rich waters from streams
to  make  snow  in  order  to  keep  the  ski  runs  open,
there is a risk of contamination of the land. Choos-
ing not to produce artiﬁcial snow may limit the use
of  resorts  and  result  in  ﬁnancial  loss.  Ski  resorts
that  make  snow  artiﬁcially  from  unpolluted  water
withdrawn from streams may also cause problems.
Withdrawing the clean water from streams to make
snow  at  resorts  may  reduce  potential  downstream
dilution of pollutants by clean water.

As a ﬁnal example of the effects of water pollu-
tion from mining areas, consider an event in Spain
in the spring of 1998. The event started close to the
Aznalcóllar  village  and  mines  near  Seville.
Acidic mining wastewater containing a toxic
mixture  of  cadmium,  zinc,  lead,  arsenic,
cyanide,  and  other  heavy  metals,  was  sud-
denly  released  when  a  50  m  (165  ft)-wide
section  of  an  Earth  dam  containing  the
waste  failed.  About  7  million  m3 of  toxic
wastewater  and  mud  was  released  down-
stream  into  the  Guadiamar  River,  which
ﬂows into one of the most ecologically rich
wetlands  in  Europe.  Fortunately,  the  spill
occurred  where  groundwater  is  naturally
discharging to the surface of the river from
the Donana aquifer rather than recharging
into it. As a result, groundwater pollution
may  not  be  as  extensive  as  it  could  have
been  if  the  toxic  wastewater  had  moved
into  the  aquifer.  The  potential  affected
area  included  the  Donana  National  Park,
Europe’s largest nature reserve and a major
tourist attraction spanning 75,000 hectares
(209 mi2) of land. The park is home to rare
birds, the Iberian lynx (a wild cat), turtles,

524

CHAPTER 15

and other species. Engineers moved quickly to con-
struct barriers to contain the toxic spill and to col-
lect  and  treat  toxic  mud  at  a  site  near  the  dam  to
prevent it from entering the national park. The bar-
riers successfully kept the toxic mud from entering
the park.

The toxic spill reportedly damaged fruit trees and
other crops as toxic ﬂoodwaters and mud inundated
the  land  (E.  P.  Martinez,  personal  communication,
1998). The release of the toxic chemicals produced a
chain  of  toxicity.  Dead  and  dying  crabs,  ﬁsh,  and
other animals, including several horses that probably
drank toxic river water or were in contact with toxic
mud,  attracted  birds  and  other  scavengers,  further
spreading  the  toxicity  through  the  ecosystem.  To
minimize the spread of toxicity by scavengers, work-
ers  used  explosives  and  gun  blasts  to  scare  birds
away from toxic areas, and hundreds of workers and
volunteers  collected  a  great  number  of  dead  eels,
ﬁsh, crabs, and frogs in the days following the event.
The event occurred suddenly, and it was not en-
tirely unexpected; for a number of years, there were
early  warning  signs,  including  questions  about  the
handling of toxic materials so close to the national
park. It was also reported that the foreign company
running the mine had experienced similar environ-
mental problems in South America (J. Chacon, per-
sonal communication, 1998). The mining company,
facing ﬁnes of $45 million, declared bankruptcy in
2000. By 2010, studies of the toxic pollution event
concluded that while Donana National Park was ap-
parently  not  signiﬁcantly  damaged,  adjacent,  up-
stream  agricultural  lands  were  seriously  polluted
and  crops  were  lost.  Recovery  of  the  polluted  soil
may take several decades or more. This event raised
the environmental consciousness of Spain and other
parts of the world, including the mining regions of
the western United States, regarding the potentially
serious environmental dangers related to the man-
agement of toxic mining waste.

Air  Pollution. Both  extraction  and  processing
operations  have  adverse  effects  on  air  quality.
Smelting has released enormous quantities of pol-
lutants into the atmosphere, including sulfur diox-
ide, a major constituent of acid rain and snow. Dust
from  mineral  mines  may  affect  air  resources,  de-
spite the fact that care is often taken to reduce dust
by  sprinkling  water  on  roads  and  other  dust-
producing areas.

As with water pollution, mines can contribute to
air pollution problems after production has stopped.
For example, toxic gases from abandoned mines in a
coal-mining area in Russia have inﬁltrated homes by
seeping  into  basements.  There  are  many  places  in
the world where mines will eventually close as they
become  unproﬁtable.  Thus,  planning  to  avoid  fu-
ture air and water pollution as a result of past min-
ing activities is an important goal for people living
in  regions  where  mining  has  been,  or  is  still,  a
widespread land use.

Impact  on  the  Biological  Environment.
Physical changes in the land, soil, water, and air as-
sociated  with  mining  directly  and  indirectly  affect
the  biological  environment.  Direct  impacts  include
the  death  of  plants,  animals,  or  people,  caused  by
mining  activity  or  contact  with  toxic  soil  or  water
from  mines  (see  A  Closer  Look:  Mining  and
Toxicity). Indirect impacts include changes in nutri-
ent  cycling;  in  the  total  mass  of  all  living  matter,
called biomass; in species diversity; and in ecosystem
stability.  These  indirect  impacts  are  due  to  alter-
ations  in  groundwater  or  surface-water  availability
or  quality.  The  periodic  or  accidental  discharge  of
pollutants through the failure of barriers, ponds, or
water  diversions,  or  through  a  breach  of  barriers
during  ﬂoods,  earthquakes,  or  volcanic  eruptions,
also damages local ecological systems.

Social  Impact. The  social  impact  of  large-scale
mining  results  from  a  rapid  inﬂux  of  workers  into
areas  unprepared  for  growth.  Stress  is  placed  on
local services, including water supplies, sewage and
solid-waste  disposal  systems,  schools,  and  rental
housing.  Land  use  quickly  shifts  from  open  range,
forest, or agriculture to urban patterns. More people
also  increase  the  stress  on  nearby  recreation  and
wilderness areas, some of which may be in a fragile
ecological balance. Construction activity and urban-
ization affect local streams through sediment pollu-
tion,  reduced  water  quality,  and  increased  runoff.
Air  quality  is  reduced  as  a  result  of  more  vehicles,
dust from construction, and generation of power to
run machinery and equipment.

Adverse  social  effects  may  result  when  miners
are displaced by mine closures or automation, be-
cause towns surrounding large mines come to de-
pend  on  the  income  of  employed  miners.  In  the
old  American  West,  mine  closures  produced  the

Itai-Itai Disease A serious
chronic disease known as Itai-Itai
has claimed many lives in Japan’s
Zintsu River basin. This extremely
painful disease (itai-itai means “ouch,
ouch”) attacks bones, causing them
to become so thin and brittle that
they break easily. The 
disease broke out near the end of
World War II, when the Japanese in-
dustrial complex was damaged and
good industrial-waste disposal prac-
tices were largely ignored. Mining
operations for zinc, lead, and cadmi-
um dumped mining waste into the
rivers, and farmers used the contam-
inated water downstream for do-
mestic and agricultural purposes.
The cause of the disease was un-
known for years, but, in 1960, bones
and tissues of victims were exam-
ined and found to contain large con-
centrations of zinc, lead, and
cadmium.19

Measurement of heavy-metal con-

centrations in the Zintsu River basin
showed that the water samples gen-
erally contained less than 1 part per
million (ppm) cadmium and 50 ppm
zinc. These metals were selectively
concentrated in the river sediment
and concentrated even more highly
in plants. This increase in concentra-
tion from water to sediment to plants
is an example of biomagniﬁcation.
One set of data for ﬁve samples
shows an average of 6 ppm cadmium
in polluted soils. In plant roots, the
average was 1,250 ppm, and, in the
harvested rice, it was 125 ppm. Sub-
sequent experiments showed that
rats fed a diet containing 100 parts
per million cadmium lost about 
3 percent of their total bone tissue,
and rats fed a diet containing 30 ppm

cadmium, 300 ppm zinc, 150 ppm
lead, and 150 ppm copper lost an
equivalent of about 33 percent of
their total bone tissue.20

Although measurements of

heavy-metal concentrations in the
water, soil, and plants of the Zintsu
River basin produce somewhat vari-
able results, the general tendency is
clear: Scientists are fairly certain that
heavy metals, especially cadmium, in
concentrations of a few parts per mil-
lion in the soil and rice, produce Itai-
Itai disease.20

Mercury and Gold Mining
Mercury has been used in gold min-
ing since Roman times, several thou-
sand years ago. A native metal in its
liquid state, mercury is useful in gold
mining because the gold particles
cling to the liquid metal, making re-
covery of the gold easier. In the Unit-
ed States during the gold rush in
California, approximately 1.14 billion
m3 (1.5 billion yd3) of gold-bearing
gravels were processed by hydraulic
mining from the 1850s to the 1880s.
During that period, mercury was
used to help recover the gold, and it
is estimated that about 4,500 metric
tons of mercury was lost into the en-
vironment. Much of that mercury is
still working its way through the
rivers and ﬂoodplains from the min-
ing areas in the Sierra Nevada to the
San Francisco Bay area. There is con-
cern about this mercury because it is
a toxic metal that, upon exposure,
may damage brain cells, resulting in
neurological and nervous system dis-
ease that includes fatigue and numb-
ness of arms and legs.21

The major environmental issues
associated with mercury toxicity in

California and other mining areas 
include:
• Hot spots of mercury contamina-

tion at mining sites

• Contamination of the sediment
with mercury and its transport
down streams and rivers

• Bioaccumulation of mercury from
water to sediment to plants, ani-
mals, and people

• Health issues resulting from expo-

sure of mercury to people and
other animals

Pathways of mercury-contaminated
sediment from a gold mining region
are shown in Figure 15.Ca. Notice
that, initially, inorganic mercury is
used to recover gold, but, as the 
mercury works through the environ-
ment, it is transformed by biologic
processes to methyl mercury, which
is the most toxic form of mercury.
Mercury toxicity and potential 
for contamination in sediments is
highest in the mining region, but
problems may persist at many kilo-
meters downstream as a result of
transport of the sediment with 
attached mercury.

The price of gold has tripled since
2001 and, as a result, gold mines are
being developed in many parts of
the world, including Indonesia,
South America, and Africa, where
millions of poor miners are eking out
a living by extracting gold from the
near-surface environment, generally
by panning (Figure 15.Cb). About
500 tons per year of mercury is be-
lieved to be used in the mining, and
millions of miners and their families
are being exposed to the toxic ef-
fects of mercury. In one region

alone, on the island of Borneo in In-
donesia, large areas of tropical forest
have been stripped bare and mined,
leaving behind a wasteland with
contaminated ponds containing

mercury. The United States and the
European Union have exported large
amounts of mercury in recent years
to countries with gold mining. Re-
cently, legislation in the United

States has been introduced to banish
or reduce such exports, particularly
to countries where people may use
mercury for mining without proper
safety standards.

well-known  ghost  towns.  Today,  the  price  of  coal
and  other  minerals  directly  affects  the  lives  of
many  small  towns,  especially  in  the  Appalachian
Mountains region of the United States, where coal
mine closures have taken a heavy toll. These mine
closings result, in part, from both lower prices for
coal and rising mining costs.

One of the reasons for the rising costs of mining
is increased environmental regulation of the mining
industry. The abuse of both the miners and the land
mined led to the establishment of unions and min-
ing  policies.  Regulations  have  helped  make  mining
safer  and  have  facilitated  land  reclamation.  Some
mining companies, however, believe the regulations
are not ﬂexible enough, and there is some truth to
their  arguments.  For  example,  if  the  original  hills
have been leveled, some areas could be reclaimed for
use as farmland after mining. Environmental regu-
lation,  however,  may  require  that  the  land  be  re-
stored  to  its  original  hilly  state,  even  though  hills
make inferior farmland.

Minimizing  the  Impact  of Mineral  Develop-
ment. Minimizing  potential  environmental  im-
pacts of mineral development requires examination
of the entire cycle of mineral use, from exploration
to extraction, reﬁning, product production, and waste

management.  Technologically  developed  countries
are making a good deal of progress in reversing the
environmental  damage  done  by  mineral  mining  in
the  past  and  in  minimizing  the  effects  of  new  ex-
traction and processing operations. It is the respon-
sibility  of  developed  countries  to  transfer  this
knowledge to the developing countries where much
of  the  mining  is  taking  place.  Environmental  laws
regulate emissions and waste disposal and mandate
restoration  measures  following  mining  operations.
In  addition,  innovative  technologies,  particularly
biotechnology, are providing more environmentally
friendly ways of mining.

Environmental Regulation. Most of the serious
environmental degradation associated with mining in
more developed countries is a relic of past practices
that are now forbidden or restricted by environmen-
tal  laws.  Another  example  of  severe  environmental
degradation occurred in the Sudbury, Ontario, area. A
century of smelting nickel ore in the area produced an
area  of  barren  land  of  approximately  100  km2
(40 mi2). Another 350 km2 (135 mi2) of land was ex-
tensively damaged by air pollutants from the smelters
(Figure  15.19).  The  deposition  of  mercury,  arsenic,
and cadmium, among other metals, caused devastat-
ing effects on the land, water, and biological resources

A 

Closer
Look

Homestake Mine, South Dakota

The Homestake Gold Mine in South
Dakota, which closed in 2001, after
125 years of mining, provides an im-
portant example of the recent use of
biotechnology to clean up an envi-
ronment degraded by mining activi-
ty. The objective of the Homestake
study is to test the use of bacterial
biooxidation to convert contami-
nants in water to substances that are
environmentally safe.23

The mining operation at Homes-
take discharges water from the gold
mine to a nearby trout stream, and
the untreated wastewater contains

cyanide in concentrations harmful to
the trout. The treatment process de-
veloped at the Homestake mine uses
bacteria that have a natural capacity
to oxidize the cyanide into harmless
nitrates.22 The bacteria are collected
from mine-tailing ponds and cul-
tured to allow biological activity at
higher cyanide concentrations. They
are then colonized on special rotat-
ing surfaces, through which the cont-
aminated water ﬂows before being
discharged to the stream. The bacte-
ria also extract precious metals from
the wastewater that can be recov-

ered by further processing.22 The sys-
tem at Homestake has reduced the
level of cyanide in the wastewater
from about 10 parts per million to
less than 0.2 parts per million, which
is below the level required by water-
quality standards for discharge into
trout streams. Because the process of
reducing the cyanide produces ex-
cess ammonia in the water, a sec-
ondary bacteria treatment was de-
signed that converts the ammonia to
nitrate compounds, so that the dis-
charged water now meets stream-
water quality criteria.23

in the vicinity. Emissions from the smelters also con-
tained tremendous quantities of sulfur dioxide, pro-
viding a major source of acid precipitation.7

Today, in the United States, smelters must adhere
to air-quality emissions standards of the Clean Air
Act.  As  a  result,  smelters  in  the  United  States  re-
cover  almost  all  of  the  sulfur  dioxide  from  their
emissions. Canada has enacted similar clean-air leg-
islation. Smelters in the Sudbury area have reduced
their  emissions  of  sulfur  dioxide  by  about  50  per-
cent, and additional reductions are slated for the fu-
ture.  As  a  result  of  the  decrease  in  the  pollutants
from the smelters, there has been some natural re-
covery of the vegetation. This has been augmented
by planting trees and adding lime to lakes, to help
neutralize acids. These restoration measures, along
with natural recovery, have resulted in revegetation
of  approximately  40  percent  of  the  barren  ground
that surrounded the smelters.7

After mining activities have ceased, land reclama-
tion, consisting of preparing the land for future uses,
is  necessary  if  the  mining  has  had  detrimental  ef-
fects and if the land is to be used for other purposes.
Reclamation of land used for mining is required by
law today, and approximately 50 percent of the land

utilized by the mining industry in the United States
has  been  reclaimed.  Methods  of  mine  reclamation
will  be  discussed  in  Chapter  16,  when  we  consider
the impact of coal mining on the environment.

Biotechnology. Several  biological  processes  used
for  metal  extraction  and  processing  are  likely  to
have important economic and environmental conse-
quences.  Biotechnology,  using  processes  such  as
biooxidation,  bioleaching,  biosorption,  and  genetic
engineering  of  microbes,  has  enormous  potential
for both extracting metals and minimizing environ-
mental degradation (see A Closer Look: Homestake
Mine, South Dakota). Biotechnology is still in its in-
fancy, and its potential uses are just beginning to be
realized by the mining and metals industries.22,23

One  promising  biotechnology 

is  bioassisted
leaching, or bioleaching, which uses microorganisms
to recover metals. In this technique, bacteria oxidize
crushed gold ore in a tank, releasing ﬁnely dissemi-
nated  gold  that  can  then  be  treated  by  cyanide
leaching.  Although  the  cyanide  is  recycled  during
mining, it is very toxic and can contaminate ground-
water resources if it is accidentally released into the
environment.  A  commercial  plant  in  Nevada  was

constructed to produce 50,000 troy ounces (a tradi-
tional  unit  of  measurement  for  gold)  of  gold  per
year  by  bioassisted  leaching.  From  both  economic
and environmental viewpoints, this method is an at-
tractive alternative to the cyanide-leaching process
for gold extraction.22

Biotechnology developed and tested by the U.S.
Bureau  of  Mines  is  being  used  to  treat  acid  mine

drainage.  Constructed  or  engineered  wetlands  at
several  hundred  sites  have  utilized  acid-tolerant
plants to remove metals and neutralize acid by bi-
ological  activity  (Figure  15.20).  Both  oxidizing
and  sulfate-reducing  bacteria  play  an  important
role  in  the  wetlands.  Research  is  ongoing  to  de-
velop  an  improved  wetland  design  that  requires
little maintenance.22

CHAPTER 15

Mineral Resources and the Environment

In summary, minimization of environmental ef-
fects associated with mineral development may take
several paths:

• Environmental regulations that address prob-
lems  such  as  sediment,  air,  and  water  pollu-
tion resulting from all aspects of the mineral
cycle. Additional  regulations  may  address
reclamation of land used for mining. (See the
opening Case History about a mine near Gold-
en, Colorado, that was transformed into a golf
course.)

• Onsite  and  offsite 

treatment  of  waste.
Minimizing  onsite  and  offsite  mining  prob-
lems  by  controlling  sediment,  water,  and  air
pollution  through  good  engineering  and  con-
servation practices is a signiﬁcant goal.

• Practicing the three Rs of waste management.
That  is,  reduce  the  amount  of  waste  pro-
duced; reuse materials in the waste stream as
much as possible; and maximize recycling op-
portunities.

15.4 Recycling Mineral

Resources

A diagram of the mineral resources cycle reveals that
many  components  of  the  cycle  are  connected  to
waste disposal (Figure 15.21). In fact, the primary
environmental impacts of mineral resource utiliza-
tion are related to its waste products. Wastes produce

pollutants that may be toxic to humans, are danger-
ous to natural ecosystems and the biosphere, are aes-
thetically  undesirable,  and  may  degrade  air,  water,
and soil. Waste and other minerals that are not recy-
cled  also  deplete  nonrenewable  mineral  resources,
with no offsetting beneﬁts for human society. Recy-
cling of resources is one way to reduce these wastes.
Waste from some parts of the mineral cycle may
be  referred  to  as  ore because  it  contains  materials
that might be recycled and used again to provide en-
ergy or useful products.24,25 The notion of reusing
waste materials is not new, and such metals as iron,
aluminum, copper, and lead have been recycled for
many years. For example, in 2006, the total value of
recycled  steel  in  the  United  States  was  about
$18.5 billion. The value of recycled steel in 2009 was
about  $13.5  billion  (a  decline  of  over  25  percent
from 2006), reﬂecting economic decline due to reces-
sion.  Recycling  of  iron  and  steel  amounted  to  ap-
proximately 50 percent. Iron and steel are recycled in
large volumes for three reasons26: (1) The market for
iron and steel is huge, and, as a result, there is a large
scrap collection and processing industry; (2) an enor-
mous economic burden would result if recycling was
not done; and (3) signiﬁcant environmental impacts
related to disposal of over 50 million tons of iron and
steel would result if we did not recycle.

Other  metals  that  are  recycled  in  large  quanti-
ties,  in  terms  of  the  total  metal  used  and  their
value, are lead (73 percent), aluminum (43 percent),
copper  (32  percent),  nickel  (43  percent),  and  tita-
nium (47 percent). Recycling aluminum reduces our
need to import raw aluminum ore and saves approxi-
mately 95 percent of the energy required to produce
new  aluminum  from  bauxite.  It  is  estimated  that
each ton of recycled steel saves 1,136 kg (2,500 lb)
of iron ore, 455 kg (1,000 lb) of coal, and 18 kg (40 lb)
of  limestone.  In  addition,  only  one-third  as  much
energy  is  required  to  produce  steel  from  recycled
scrap as from native ore. The metal from almost all
of the millions of automobiles that are discarded an-
nually in the United States is recycled.27

15.5 Minerals 

and Sustainability

FIGURE 15.21 Waste is generated in many parts 
of a mineral cycle Simpliﬁed ﬂowchart of the mineral re-
sources cycle.

Sustainable development and mineral use do not ap-
pear to be compatible. Sustainability is a long-term
concept that includes ﬁnding ways to provide future

generations  a  fair  share  of  Earth’s  resources,  and
over time, nonrenewable mineral resources are con-
sumed. However, it may be possible to ﬁnd solutions
to nonrenewable mineral resource use that meet the
spirit, if not the letter, of sustainability. This is pos-
sible because, often, it is not a mineral we need so
much but the uses for that mineral. For example, we
mine copper to use it in wires to transmit electricity
or electronic pulses, and it’s the properties of cop-
per,  not  the  metal  itself,  that  we  desire.  For  tele-
phone wires, we can use glass ﬁber cables, eliminat-
ing  the  need  for  copper.  Similarly,  digital  cameras
have eliminated the need for ﬁlm development that
uses silver. The photography industry is not inter-
ested  in  silver  but,  rather,  the  speciﬁc  function  of
silver  in  photography.  Therefore,  it  is  possible  to
compensate for a nonrenewable mineral by ﬁnding
new,  innovative  ways  to  do  things.  We  are  also
learning  that  we  may  use  raw  mineral  materials
more efﬁciently. For example, the Eiffel Tower could
be constructed today with one-fourth of the amount
of steel used when it was built in the late 1800s.28

Finding substitutes or ways to use nonrenewable
resources  more  efﬁciently  usually  takes  several
decades  of  research  and  development.  The  time

Summary

531

available for ﬁnding a solution to the depletion of a
nonrenewable mineral is determined using the R to
C ratio (R ⫼ C), where R is the known reserve and C
is the rate of consumption. However, the size of a re-
serve  is  not  a  constant  quantity  through  time  be-
cause  it  changes  with  technology  and  economics.
Therefore, the R to C ratio is not the time a reserve
will last at the present rate of consumption. For ex-
ample,  during  the  past  50  years,  R  to  C  ratios  for
metals  such  as  zinc  and  copper  have  ﬂuctuated  at
about 30 years, and during that time, consumption
of the metals increased by about three times. This
was possible because we discovered new deposits of
the  metals.  The  ratio  does  provide  a  view  of  how
scarce a particular mineral resource may be. Metals
with  relatively  small  ratios  are  viewed  as  being  in
short supply, and it is those resources for which we
need to ﬁnd substitutes.28

In summary, to reconcile sustainable development
with the use of nonrenewable mineral resources, we
need to ﬁnd ways to more wisely use resources. This
includes developing more efﬁcient ways of exploring
for and mining resources, using available resources,
recycling, and applying human ingenuity to ﬁnd sub-
stitutes for minerals in short supply.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About Mine Reclamation in Colorado 
to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. How is future population in-

crease in the Denver area linked
to mining of resources such as
clay and gravel? Can the case his-
tory provide guidance for future
sequential land use where one
use (e.g., mining) leads to an-
other (e.g., golf course)?

2. How is the concept of sustain-

ability linked to the history of the
clay mine?

3. How do science and values link to

how the mine in the opening
case was developed, how clay
was extracted, and how the land
was reclaimed?

4. How is the reclamation linked to
geologic hazards and their mini-
mization?

Summary

Availability of mineral resources is one
measure of the wealth of a society.
Modern technological civilization, as

we know it, would not be possible
without exploitation of these re-
sources. However, we cannot maintain

exponential population growth on a 
ﬁnite resource base. Because of slow-
moving geologic processes, mineral

532

CHAPTER 15

Mineral Resources and the Environment

deposits must be considered nonre-
newable resources.

A mineral resource is a concentra-

tion of a naturally occurring Earth
material in a form that makes extrac-
tion currently or potentially feasible.
A mineral reserve is that portion of a
mineral resource that is currently
available, legally and economically, for
extraction. It is important to remem-
ber that not all resources are reserves.
Unless discovered and captured, re-
sources cannot be used to solve pre-
sent shortages.

Mineral resources may be classiﬁed

according to their use as metals,
building materials, minerals for the
chemical industry, and minerals for
agriculture. Nonmetallic minerals are
consumed at much greater rates than
any metal except iron. When a min-
eral becomes scarce, the choices are to
ﬁnd more sources, recycle what has
already been obtained, ﬁnd a substi-
tute, use less, or do without. The
United States and other afﬂuent na-
tions have insufﬁcient domestic sup-
plies of many mineral resources for
current use and must supplement
them by imports from other coun-
tries. As these countries industrialize
and develop, the imports may be
more difﬁcult to obtain, and afﬂuent
countries may have to ﬁnd substi-
tutes for some minerals or use a
smaller portion of the world’s annual
production. These adjustments are al-
ready occurring in the United States,

where there has been a reduction in
per capita nonfuel mineral consump-
tion since the 1980s.

The geology of mineral resources is
complex and intimately related to vari-
ous aspects of the rock, tectonic, and
hydrologic cycles. Mineral resources
are generally extracted from ores, the
name given to naturally occurring
anomalously high concentrations of
Earth materials that can be proﬁtably
extracted. To be classiﬁed as an ore, a
mineral-bearing deposit must have a
speciﬁc concentration factor, which is
the ratio of the mineral’s concentration
in ore to its average concentration in
Earth’s crust. The concentration factor
of a given mineral reﬂects both geo-
logic and economic circumstances.
The environmental impact of

mineral exploitation depends upon
many factors, including mining pro-
cedures, local hydrologic conditions,
climate, rock types, size of opera-
tion, topography, and many more in-
terrelated factors. In addition, the
impact varies with the stage of de-
velopment of the resource. In gen-
eral, mineral exploration and testing
do little damage, except in particu-
larly fragile areas. On the other
hand, mineral mining may have
major adverse effects on the land,
water, air, and biological resources
and may initiate social impacts on
the environment, due to increasing
demand for housing and services in
mining areas.

Because the demand for mineral

resources is increasing, we must
strive to implement good engineering
and conservation practices that will
minimize both onsite and offsite
problems caused by mineral develop-
ment. The recent application of
biotechnology to metal extraction
and pollution reduction has real
promise. Environmental degradation
associated with mining and mineral
processing in more developed coun-
tries has been signiﬁcantly reduced in
recent years, due to development of
pollution abatement strategies and
legislation to mandate improved pol-
lution control measures and land
reclamation. Such technologies and
regulations often are not present in
less developed countries that are
striving to develop their mineral re-
sources. It is the responsibility of the
more developed countries to transfer
technology, so that environmental
degradation related to mining activi-
ties is minimized at the local, re-
gional, and global levels.

Recycling of mineral resources is
one way to delay or partly alleviate a
crisis caused by the convergence of a
rapidly rising population and a lim-
ited resource base.

Sustainable development and use of
nonrenewable mineral resources need
not be as incompatible as might be ex-
pected. We need to ﬁnd ways to use
our resources more wisely by ﬁnding
substitutes, recycling, and conserving.

Critical Thinking Questions

1. Today, technological changes are

coming from all directions. The in-
creasing use of electronic mail (e-
mail, Twitter, and Facebook) is
leading us to a paperless society.
We now have e-money, a technol-
ogy that allows us to pay our bills
via personal computers. Journals
and newspapers we subscribe to
come over the Internet, and we can
print out only what we really want
to keep. What is the impact of this
technology on resource utilization?
To answer this question, start by
constructing a list of the resources
from mineral sources necessary to
support a paper-driven society.
Then develop a plan to reduce the
impact on natural resources of the

Companion Website

transformation to a more paper-
less society.

2. Since we know that mineral re-
sources are finite, there are two
ways to look at our present and
future use of these resources. One
view is that we are headed toward
a mineral crisis as the number of
people on Earth increases. The
other is that, as the number of
people increases, the possibility
for innovations increases, and we
will, therefore, find ways to ad-
just our use of minerals to the in-
creasing population. How could
these two hypotheses be tested?

3. Biotechnology and genetic engineer-

ing are potential tools for cleaning

up the environment. We discussed
some examples of biotechnology in
this chapter: Bacteria can be cul-
tured to neutralize acids in efﬂuent
from mines, and artiﬁcial wetlands
can be constructed in which biologi-
cal processes purify water polluted
by mineral processing and mining.
What do you think of biotechnology
and genetic engineering? How
might the technology be transferred
to the mineral industry in the
United States and other countries?

4. Compare how principles of sus-
tainability might be applied to
mining copper, which is a ﬁnite re-
source, with water, which is a re-
newable resource.

Learning Objectives
The highly technical society in the United States consumes a disproportionate share of the total

consumes approximately 20 percent of the world’s total energy. How can we break our
dependency on energy sources that harm the environment (e.g., coal, oil) without sacriﬁcing our
standard of living? In this chapter, we explore possible answers to this important question. The

focus will be on the following learning objectives:

• Know the important

issues related to energy
policy, particularly the
concept of sustainable
energy development

• Understand the concept

of peak oil and how it
might impact our
economic and social

Case History
Energy Transitions from Approximately 1800 to Present

The amount of fossil fuels,
especially petroleum, in
Earth is ﬁnite. As a re-
sult, a transition from
oil will be necessary in
the future. An interest-
ing comparison to 
examine is an earlier
energy transforma-
tion in the United
States from wood in
the mid-1800s to
fossil fuels in the
mid-1900s. The
consumption of en-
ergy from 1800 to
2009 in the United
States is shown in
Figure 16.1. Notice
that the peak in use
of wood was ap-
proximately 1870,
when coal started to
be burned in a more
serious way. In the
mid-1800s and for a
period of about 
100 years, something
like 95 percent of the

total energy in the United
States, as well as the rest of
the world, came from wood as
the primary source of energy. The
transition to coal and, eventually, to
oil and gas began in a small way, and

burning coal, and
the ﬁrst oil well was
completed in 1858.
Up to that time, the
primary source of
oil was whale oil.
Following the use
of petroleum that
produced kerosene,
the United States
left the whale-
hunting industry
behind. The fossil
fuels were very at-
tractive because of
their high heat
value for the vol-
ume of fuel and be-
cause they were,
initially, plentiful,
easy to extract, and
not very expensive.
In other words, the
transition from
wood to fossil fuels

the transition was not a smooth one.
It took something like 100 years for
the full transition to take place. This
resulted because there were lots of
things to consider, including what
people were accustomed to and the
driving forces behind economic and
social change.1,2

Shortages of wood in 1812 in

Philadelphia led to experiments with

was one from a rather low grade
source of energy (i.e., wood) to a
much higher one (i.e., coal and oil) at
a lower price. Flash forward to the
late twentieth and into the twenty-ﬁrst
centuries, and we now understand
that the burning of oil will, naturally,
need to be transitioned to other
energy sources, such as coal, natural
gas, nuclear energy, solar, and wind,

16.1 Worry Over Energy

Sources Is Nothing New:
Energy Shocks Past 
and Present

Two  thousand  years  ago,  the  homes  of  afﬂuent
Roman citizens had central heating that consumed
vast amounts of wood—perhaps as much as 125 kg
(275 lb) every hour. Wood was the fuel of the day,

much like oil and gas in the United States today. The
exhaustion of local supplies of wood produced short-
ages and a shock to the Roman society. To combat
the  shortages,  the  Romans  had  to  import  wood
from distances as far away as 1,600 km (995 mi).
As  distant  supplies  of  wood  became  scarce,  the 
Romans faced a second energy shock. They turned
to  solar  energy  as  an  alternative,  with  consider-
able success. Ancient Romans became so efficient
in  the  use  of  solar  energy  that  they  established

Worry Over Energy Sources Is Nothing New: Energy Shocks Past and Present

among others. The transition from
fossil fuels to alternative sources will
involve two steps: transition from oil
followed by transition from coal and
natural gas. The transition from oil
will happen because oil will eventually
(some say soon) come into short
supply and be much more expensive.
Sometimes, people claim that the
transition can happen quickly, and
you may hear statements about it
being done over 20 to 30 years if we
apply our best thinking, as with the
project to land a person on the Moon.
Using natural gas and coal for basic
modes of transportation (i.e., cars,
trucks, trains, and airplanes) will be
difﬁcult and will be associated with
known environmental problems, such
as air pollution. Using vast amounts
of alternative energy sources, such as
wind and solar, that are growing
rapidly is technically possible (as is
the use of massive amounts of coal
and natural gas), but the time
necessary for the transition from oil
is likely to be closer to 100 years than
to 30 years.

The ﬁrst energy transition from
wood to fossil fuels took over a cen-
tury, and, during the transition, en-
ergy use in the world increased by a
factor of about 20. Therefore, replac-
ing even half of the oil consumed
today by other energy sources in a few
decades would require a tremendous
effort; it is not impossible but not
likely. The transition to alternative
energy sources, such as solar and

wind, to produce half of our energy
consumption today would require the
alternative energy sources to grow by
approximately 12 times. Another po-
tential problem with the transition is
that, with this transitioning, a fuel
that is often less reliable (e.g., wind
doesn’t blow all the time and the Sun
shines only half the time) may be
used to replace a more reliable source
(e.g., fossil fuels). Alternative fuels
also have a lower energy density with
respect to amount of energy per vol-
ume or weight. The transition from
oil to alternative energy (with the ex-
ception of nuclear energy) requires
moving from a higher source of en-
ergy to a lower one. With respect to
speciﬁc alternative energy sources
(other than nuclear), it is clear that
wind could make a signiﬁcant contri-
bution in the future. However, the
real hope is for development of solar
energy because, by itself, it could
meet all of our future demands for
electricity. However, the goal of turn-
ing solar energy into useful energy at
a low cost has still not been achieved,
and we will have to learn to deal with
infrastructure problems for delivery
of that energy. Today, direct produc-
tion of electricity from solar sources
is only about 0.1 percent of the
world’s energy production of electric-
ity, which means a scaling up factor
would have to be something like
1,000 times if solar were to account
for all the electric energy we use on
Earth. Solar energy is an attractive

source, but no matter how attractive
it is, it will take time to create the in-
frastructure, produce the energy, and
transport it where it is used. Another
challenge with the transition to alter-
native energy to supply most of the
energy now produced by oil is that
many of the alternatives, at this
point, are not all that attractive. They
do not provide new energy services
(they mainly produce electricity), and
they cost more than oil.1,2 Therefore,
the transition from oil will require
continuing to burn other fossil fuels
(i.e., coal and natural gas) until alter-
native sources can be ramped up. Nat-
ural gas is environmentally preferred
over coal as it is much less polluting.
The transition from oil will occur
(it is deﬁnitely coming). The problem
is not the technology to make the
transition so much as the willpower
to make the transition (i.e., science
and value issues). Eventually, cost will
drive the transition as oil becomes
more expensive, but, if we are proac-
tive, we will begin more serious work
on that transition—sooner rather
than later. The fact that the use of
solar and wind energy are doubling
every year or two is a good sign, but
the scaling up of alternative energy to
provide a signiﬁcant portion of what
is now provided by fossil fuels will be
a daunting task. However, we need to
continue the research, development,
and incentives and pursue alternative
energies very vigorously in the com-
ing years.1,2

laws to protect a person’s right to his or her share of
the solar energy. In some cases, it was illegal to con-
struct  a  building  that  shaded  a  building  next  door
because the shade would rob the neighbors of their
share of the solar resource.3

During  the  summer  of  2008,  U.S.  citizens  were
shocked by the rapid price increase of gasoline. The
sharp  price  increase  followed  years  of  lower  prices
(particularly in the 1990s), due to an oil and gasoline
glut. The reasons for the price increase are complex

and based upon several factors: Oil-producing coun-
tries  reduced  production  rates,  there  was  political
unrest and war in the Middle East, and the U.S. gov-
ernment  instituted  regulations  that  required  oil
producers  to  reduce  air  pollution  by  reformulating
gasoline with additives that produce cleaner-burning
fuel. These factors, as well as suspected price goug-
ing by oil companies, resulted in shortages, and, by
August  2008,  crude  oil  cost  over  $100  per  barrel 
(1 barrel is 42 gallons). By late 2008, the price had

538

CHAPTER 16

Energy Resources

dropped signiﬁcantly from the high in the summer,
and,  by  April  2009,  the  price  was  about  $40  per
barrel  (the  price  in  2004),  and  by  late  2010,  was
back up to about $80 per barrel. As dramatic as the
price increases were, they were not the ﬁrst; there
had been several such oil shocks in a space of less
than 30 years.

The price increase in gasoline was preceded by the
“California  energy  crisis,”  with  its  rolling  black-
outs, in 2001. This crisis was a wake-up call to the
entire country. The crisis resulted, in part, because,
as  California  prospered  and  grew  in population,  de-
mand for energy increased. California imports a large
percentage of its electrical energy and failed to bring
sufﬁcient new sources of energy online. Utility compa-
nies that had been deregulated a few years before were
forced  to  purchase  emergency  power  from  suppliers
that charged as much as 900 percent more than nor-
mal. One of the state’s largest power companies went
bankrupt, and the governor of California initiated an
investigation of illegal market control and price goug-
ing by energy suppliers. More power plants are being
constructed, but the short-range future is uncertain.
August 14, 2003, brought an energy shock to New
York  City  and  the  surrounding  region  as  a  massive
eight-state blackout occurred. More than 50 million
people  were  affected.  Some  were  trapped  in  eleva-
tors and electric trains underground. Power was re-
stored  to  most  places  within  24  hours.  The  power
failure started at a U.S. power plant and quickly cas-
caded to become a widespread failure. The blackout
emphasized our dependence on an aging centralized
power  distribution  system  and
the  need  for  improved  energy
management.

issue, and an environmental question.4 How we re-
spond to energy issues will largely deﬁne who and
what we are and will become in the twenty-ﬁrst cen-
tury. In this chapter, we will explore present energy
use,  environmental  effects  of  energy  consumption,
and what the future might hold in terms of establish-
ing sustainable energy development.

16.2 Peak Oil: When Will It Occur
and What Is Its Importance?
Peak oil is the term for the concept that a time will
come  when  one-half  of  Earth’s  oil  has  been  ex-
tracted and used. Peak oil is likely to occur sometime
between 2020 and 2050.5,6

The United States is prosperous, and people are
living  longer,  as  a  result  of  abundant  low-cost  en-
ergy in the form of crude oil. While the beneﬁts of
oil  are  undeniable,  so  also  are  the  environmental
problems  associated  with  it,  ranging  from  air  and
water pollution to global warming. We are about to
learn what life is like with less, more expensive oil.
The question is not if the peak in production of oil
will come, but when, and what the economic and po-
litical consequences to society will be.5

The reality of peak oil in the United States is shown
in Figure 16.2. U.S. oil production peaked (as pre-
dicted years earlier) in 1970, at 11.3 million barrels
per  day.  In  that  year,  the  United  States  imported
3.2  million  barrels  per  day.  Imports  just  equaled
exports  by  1996.  In  2009,  production  was  about 

The Romans’ use of solar energy
illustrates  that  energy  problems
are not new. As one source of en-
ergy  becomes  scarce,  and  energy
shocks  occur,  we  search  for  alter-
natives.  Today,  as  mentioned  in
the opening case history about en-
ergy transformations, we fear that
production of crude oil will peak in
the next decade or so. Like the Ro-
mans,  we  will  need  alternatives;
perhaps  it  will  be  solar  energy
again. Energy from local to global
scale has emerged as a central eco-
nomic  concern,  a  foreign  policy

8 million barrels per day, and imports
were about 10 million barrels per day.
The global history of oil, in terms
of  rate  of  discovery  and  consump-
tion  (Figure  16.3),  is  an  important
factor  in  peak  oil.  Nearly  ﬁve  times
more  oil  was  discovered  in  1960
than  was  consumed.  However,  by
1980,  the  amount  discovered  was
equivalent to the amount consumed;
and, in 2000, the consumption of oil
was three times the amount discov-
ered.  This  trend  is  not  sustainable.
The  unfortunate  truth  is  that  oil  is
being  consumed  rapidly,  relative  to
new resources being found. In 2006,
oil  companies  reported  the  largest
discovery  of  oil  ever  in  the  United
States.  At  15  billion  barrels,  when
extracted and consumed by users of
the  world  market,  it  will  provide
about a 6-month supply of oil. If all
15  billion  barrels  is  saved  for  the  United  States,  it
will be only about a 2-year supply.

The  concept  of  peak  oil  production  is  shown  in
Figure  16.4a.  We  aren’t  conﬁdent  about  when  the
peak production will be because it depends, in part,
on technology, conservation, and use of alternative
fuels, such as ethanol (biofuel). For this discussion,
let’s assume it to be about 35 billion barrels per year
(95  million  barrels  per  day),  and  that  the  peak  ar-
rives  sometime  between  2015  and  2030.  The
growth rate for oil in the past year or so has been
nearly  ﬂat,  so  increasing  from  the  present  produc-
tion rate of about 31 billion barrels per year to 35 in
a few decades seems reasonable. When peak produc-
tion  occurs  and  demand  increases,  a  gap  between
production and demand will become evident. Figure
16.4b shows  two  possible  scenarios.  The  ﬁrst  is  a
ﬂat peak from 2004 to about 2025; production has
been  relatively  stable,  at  about  82  million  barrels
per day. If demand is approximately 115 million bar-
rels per day, the gap will be about 34 million barrels
per day. If production increases to match demand in
2015 (scenario 2), then a gap will occur after 2015.
Cost will increase as peak oil becomes a reality, and,
if  we  haven’t  prepared  for  the  peak,  economic  and
political disruption to society are inevitable. We still
have time to prepare for the eventual peak and use
remaining  fossil  fuels  to  help  transition  to  other

energy sources. In the most optimistic scenario, the
transition from oil to alternative fuels will not occur
until we have cost-competitive choices in place.6

When  the  peak  in  oil  production  occurs,  we  will
not run out of oil, but oil will become much more ex-
pensive. When that happens, the peak will be differ-
ent  from  any  problem  we  have  faced  in  the  past.
Human  population  will  increase  by  several  billion
more  in  coming  decades,  as  countries  with  growing
economies, including China and India, increase their
oil consumption. China may double its import of oil in
the next 5 years! As supplies tighten, the economic,
social,  and  political  ramiﬁcations  of  competition  for
oil  will  be  enormous.  Planning  to  conserve  oil  and
transition to alternative energy sources will be critical
in the coming decades. We cannot afford to leave the
age of oil behind until alternatives are in place.

16.3 Energy Supply 

and Energy Demand

Nearly  90  percent  of  the  energy  consumed  in  the
United States today is produced from coal, natural
gas,  and  petroleum  or  oil.  These  energy  resources
are sometimes called fossil fuels because of their or-
ganic origin. These fuels are nonrenewable resources.

originates  mostly  from  hydropower  and  nuclear
power. We still have huge reserves of coal, but major
new  sources  of  natural  gas  and  petroleum  are  be-
coming scarce. In fact, we import approximately the
same amount of oil that we produce, which makes
us vulnerable to changing world conditions that af-
fect the available supply of crude oil. Few new large

hydropower plants can be expected, and the plan-
ning and construction of new nuclear power plants
have  become  uncertain  for  a  variety  of  reasons.
More  recently,  alternative  energy  sources,  such  as
solar  power  for  homes,  farms,  and  ofﬁces,  are  be-
coming economically more feasible and, thus, more
common.

Changes  in  energy  consump-
tion  in  the  United  States  are
shown in Figure 16.5. From 1950
through  2009,  there  was  a  sharp
increase  in  energy  consumption;
the rate of increase declined after
the shortages in the mid-1970s to
mid-1980s. The rate of energy con-
sumption  increased  again  during
the  last  decade  of  the  twentieth
century,  due  to  abundant  cheap
oil. Total U.S. energy consumption
has  increased  by  about  30  exa-
joules  (EJ)  since  1985  (see  A
Closer  Look:  Energy  Units for  an
explanation  of  exajoules).  Energy
conservation  policies,  such  as  re-
quiring  new  automobiles  to  be
more  fuel  efﬁcient  and  buildings
to  be  better  insulated,  have  been
at least partially successful. Never-
theless,  at  the  beginning  of  the
twenty-ﬁrst century, we remained
hooked on fossil fuels. U.S. energy
policy  will  be  an  important  topic
in the coming decades. Some top-
ics  being  discussed  are  listed  in

Projections  of  energy  supply
and demand are difﬁcult, at best,
because  the  technical,  economic,
political,  and  social  assumptions
that  underlie  these  projections
are  constantly  changing.  It  is
clear, however, that we must con-
tinue  to  research,  develop,  and
evaluate potential energy sources
and conservation practices to en-
sure  sufﬁcient  energy  to  main-
tain our industrial society, along
with  a  quality  environment.  In
the  United  States,  space  heating
is  the  main  use  of  energy  for  applications  below
300°C (572°F). With these ideas in mind, we will ex-
plore some selected geologic and environmental as-
pects  of  well-known  energy  resources,  including
coal, oil, and nuclear sources, as well as potentially
important sources, such as oil shale, tar sands, and
geothermal  resources.  We  will  also  discuss  renew-
able energy sources, such as hydropower, wind, and
solar power.

16.4 Fossil Fuels
The origin of fossil fuels—coal, oil, and gas—is inti-
mately related to the geologic cycle. These fuels are,
essentially, solar energy stored in the form of organic
material that has been transformed by physical and
biochemical processes after burial. The United States
is dependent on fossil fuels for nearly all the energy
we consume. This situation is changing—slowly.

CHAPTER 16

A 

Closer
Look

Energy Units

The basic unit for energy expendi-
ture is the joule (J). One joule is de-
fined as a force of 1 newton applied
over a distance of 1 m (3.3 ft). A
newton (N) is defined as the force
necessary to produce an accelera-
tion of 1 m per second per second
(m/sec2) to a mass of 1 kg. From

1950 through 2007, total U.S. ener-
gy consumption increased from 30
to approximately 100 exajoules (EJ);
1 EJ is equal to 1018 J and approxi-
mately equal to 1 quad, or 1015 Btu.
The units for power are time rates
of energy or joules per second
(J/sec); 1 J/sec is 1 watt (W). A large

power plant produces about 1,000
megawatts (MW), which is 
1 billion watts (1 gigawatt [GW]).
Electrical energy is commonly 
sold by kilowatt-hours (kWh). 
This unit is 1,000 W applied over 
1 hour (3,600 sec). Thus, 1 kWh is 
3,600,000 J, or 3.6 MJ.

TABLE 16.1 Energy Policy: What Is Being Discussed

1. Promote conventional energy sources: Use much more natural gas, with the objective of reducing our reliance on energy

from foreign countries, and use natural gas as a transition from oil.

2. Encourage alternative energy: Provide support or subsidies for wind energy and other alternative energy sources, such as

solar, geothermal, hydrogen, and biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel). Increase the amount of biofuel (ethanol) mixed with
gasoline sold in the United States.

3. Provide for energy infrastructure: Ensure that electricity is received over dependable, modern infrastructure.

4. Promote conservation measures: Set higher efﬁciency standards for federal buildings and for household products. Require

that what is now waste heat from power generation and industrial processes be used to produce electricity or other products.
Recommend fuel-efﬁciency standards for cars, trucks, and SUVs. Give new tax credits for installing energy-efﬁcient windows
and appliances in homes. Provide a tax credit for purchasing a fuel-efﬁcient hybrid or clean-diesel vehicle. Develop smart
electric grids in homes, communities, and regions to optimally manage energy use with the object of conserving energy.

5. Seriously consider nuclear power: Recognize that nuclear power plants can generate large amounts of electricity without

emitting air pollution or greenhouse gases.

6. Promote research: Develop alternative energy sources; ﬁnd innovative ways to improve coal plants and to help construct

cleaner coal plants; determine how to safely tap into the vast amounts of oil trapped in oil shale and tar sands; and develop
pollution-free automobiles.

The environmental disruption associated with the
exploration and development of fossil fuels must be
weighed against the beneﬁts gained from the energy,
but it is not an either–or proposition. Good conser-
vation  practices,  combined  with  pollution  control
and  reclamation,  can  help  minimize  the  environ-
mental disruption associated with fossil fuels.

Coal
Coal is  one  of  the  major  fossil  fuels.  Burning  coal
accounts  for  about  20  percent  of  the  total  energy

consumption in the United States. As we shall dis-
cuss, the environmental costs of coal consumption
are signiﬁcant.

Geology of Coal. Like the other fossil fuels, coal is
composed  of  organic  materials  that  have  escaped
oxidation in the carbon cycle. Essentially, coal is the
altered residue of plants that ﬂourished in ancient
freshwater  or  brackish  swamps,  typically  found  in
estuaries,  coastal  lagoons,  and  low-lying  coastal
plains or deltas.

Coal-forming  processes  begin  in  swamps  rich  in
plant life, where water-saturated soils exclude much
of the oxygen normally present in soil (Figure 16.6).
The  plants  partially  decompose  in  this  oxygen-
deficient  environment  and  slowly  accumulate  to
form a thick layer of material called peat. The swamps
and accumulations of peat may then be inundated by
a prolonged, slow rise in sea level, caused either by an
actual rise of sea level or by sinking of the land; sedi-
ments, such as sand, silt, clay, and carbonate-rich ma-
terial, are then deposited on the peat. As more and
more sediment is deposited, water and organic gases,
or volatiles, are squeezed out, and the percentage of
carbon  increases  in  the  compressed  peat.  As  this
process continues, the peat is eventually transformed

to coal. Because there are often several layers of coal
in the same area, scientists believe that the sea level
may  have  alternately  risen  and  fallen,  allowing  de-
velopment and then drowning of peat swamps.7

Classification and Distribution of Coal. Coal
is commonly classiﬁed according to type and sulfur
content.  The  type  is  generally  based  on  both  the
percentage of carbon in the coal and its heat value
on  combustion.  The  percentage  of  carbon  in  coal
increases  among  the  four  types  found  in  Earth,
from  lignite  to  subbituminous  to  bituminous  to
anthracite  (Figure  16.7).  Figure  16.7 also  shows
that heat content is maximum in bituminous coal,
which has relatively few volatiles, such as oxygen,
hydrogen, and nitrogen, and low moisture content.
Heat  content  is  minimum  in  lignite,  which  has  a
high  moisture  content.  The  distribution  of  the
common  types  of  coals  in  the  contiguous  United
States is shown in Figure 16.8a. The distribution of
world coal reserves, which amount to about 1,000
billion  metric  tons,  is  shown  in  Figure  16.8b.  The

United  States  has  about  25  percent  of  these  re-
serves.  The  annual  world  consumption  of  about  5
billion tons suggests that, at the present rate of con-
sumption,  known  reserves  are  sufﬁcient  for  over
200  years.8 It  is  likely,  however,  that  in  countries
undergoing 
industrialization,  such  as
China, reserves may be depleted sooner.

intensive 

The sulfur content of coal may generally be classi-
ﬁed as low (0 to 0.60 percent), medium (0.61–1.67
percent),  or  high  (greater  than  1.67  percent).  All
other factors being equal, the use of low-sulfur coal
as a fuel for power plants releases less sulfur dioxide
(SO2) and causes the least air pollution. Most coal in
the United States is the low-sulfur variety; however,
by  far  the  most  common  low-sulfur  coal  is  a  rela-
tively low-grade, subbituminous variety found west
of the Mississippi River (Table 16.2).9 To avoid air
pollution,  thermal  electric  power  plants  on  the
highly populated East Coast must continue to either
treat  local  coal  to  lower  its  sulfur  content  before
burning or capture the sulfur after burning. Treat-
ment  increases  the  cost  of  thermal  electric  power,
but  it  may  be  more  economical  than  transporting
low-sulfur  coal  from  west  of  the  Mississippi  River.

Impact of Coal Mining. Most of the coal mining
in the United States is done by open-pit mining, or
strip mining. Strip mining began in the late nineteenth
century and has steadily increased, whereas produc-
tion  from  underground  mines  has  stabilized.  As  a
result,  most  coal  today  is  obtained  from  surface
mines west of the Mississippi River. In recent years,
strip mining in the Appalachians, using a technique

Fossil Fuels

545

known  as  mountain-top  removal,  has  become  more
common.  Coal  is  mined  from  tops  of  mountains,
and the waste rock from mining is placed in valleys,
where coal sludge produced from processing the coal
is stored behind coal-waste sludge dams. Strip min-
ing is, in many cases, technologically and economi-
cally more advantageous than underground mining.
The increased demand for coal will lead to more and
larger strip mines to extract the estimated 40 billion
metric tons of coal reserves that are now accessible
to surface mining techniques. In addition, approxi-
mately another 90 billion metric tons of coal within
50 m (165 ft) of the surface is potentially available
for stripping, if needs demand it. To put this in per-
spective, consider that the annual U.S. production is
about 1 billion metric tons, and the world produc-
tion is about 5 billion metric tons per year.8

The impact of large strip mines varies by region,
depending on topography, climate, and, most impor-
tantly,  reclamation  practices.  In  humid  areas  with
abundant  rainfall,  mine  drainage  of  acid  water  is  a
serious  problem  (Figure  16.9).  Surface  water  inﬁl-
trates the spoil banks (i.e., the material left after the
coal  or  other  minerals  have  been  removed),  reacts
with sulﬁde minerals such as pyrite (FeS2), and pro-
duces sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid then runs into
and pollutes streams and groundwater resources. Al-
though  acid  water  also  drains  from  underground
mines, road cuts, and areas where coal and pyrite are
abundant,  the  problem  is  magniﬁed  when  large
areas of disturbed material remain exposed to sur-
face  waters.  Acid  drainage  can  be  minimized
through proper use of water diversion practices that

collect surface runoff and groundwater before
they  enter  the  mined  area  and  divert  them
around  the  potentially  polluting  materials.
This  practice  reduces  erosion,  pollution,  and
water-treatment cost.10

In  arid  and  semiarid  regions,  water  prob-
lems  associated  with  mining  are  not  as  pro-
nounced  as  in  wetter  regions.  However,  arid
land  may  be  more  sensitive  to  mining  activi-
ties, such as exploration and road building. In
some  arid  areas,  the  land  is  so  sensitive  that
even  tire  tracks  across  the  land  survive  for
years. Soils are often thin, water is scarce, and
reclamation work is difﬁcult.

All methods of strip mining have the poten-
tial  to  pollute,  but  reclamation  practices  can
minimize  the  environmental  damage  of  strip
mining  (Figure  16.10).  Reclamation  begins
with  segregation  of  the  soil  and  overburden,
the rock above the coal. After mining, the top-
soil  that  was  removed 
is  replaced.  This
method  is  widely  used,  and  it  is  a  successful
way  to  minimize  water  pollution  when  com-
bined with regrading and revegetation.10

FIGURE 16.10 Mining coal Large backhoe at the Trapper Mine, Col-
orado, removing the coal and loading it into large trucks for delivery to a

Federal guidelines govern strip mining of coal in
the United States. They require that mined land be
restored  to  support  its  premining  use.  Restoration
includes  disposing  of  wastes,  contouring  the  land,
and replanting vegetation (Figure 16.11). The hope

is  that,  after  reclamation,  the  mined  land  will  ap-
pear and function as it did before extraction of the
coal. However, this is a difﬁcult task and, in general,
is  not  completely  successful.  The  regulations  also
prohibit strip mining on prime agricultural land and

• Unlike oil and gas, burned coal leaves
ash  (5  percent  to  20  percent  of  the
original  amount  of  the  coal)  that
must be collected and disposed of in
landﬁlls. Some ash can be used as ﬁll
in land development or for other pur-
poses,  but  about  85  percent 
is
presently useless.

• Handling  of  tremendous  quantities
of  coal  through  all  stages—mining,
processing, disposal of mining waste,
shipping,  burning,  and  disposing of
ash—has  potentially  adverse  envi-
ronmental  effects,  including  water
pollution  (see  A  Closer  Look:  Coal
Sludge  in  the  Appalachian  Moun-
tains); air pollution; release of trace
elements 
likely  to  cause  serious
health problems into the water, soil,
and  air;  and  aesthetic  degradation
at  mines,  power  plants,  and  other
facilities  associated  with  the  coal
industry.

• Fly ash, produced from burning ﬁnely
ground  coal  in  a  power  plant,  col-
lected  in  ash  retention  ponds  adjacent  to  the
power plant, is a potential hazard. The ash is
toxic and must be disposed of. Ponds may hold
several  million  cubic  meters  of  wet  ash.  On
December 22, 2008, the retaining structure of
an  ash  pond  at  the  Kingston  Fossil  power
plant  in  Tennessee  failed,  sending  a  ﬂood  of
ash  and  water  downslope,  destroying  several
homes,  rupturing  a  gas  line,  and  polluting  a
river.13

• Several  billion  metric  tons  of  coal  are  burned
worldwide,  releasing  huge  amounts  of  carbon
dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. China, the
United States, and Russia account for the ma-
jority  of  the  carbon  dioxide  released.  Carbon
dioxide  is  a  “greenhouse  gas,”  thought  to  be
signiﬁcant in producing global warming. (Glob-
al warming is discussed in Chapter 18.)

Environmental  problems  associated  with  coal,
although  signiﬁcant,  are  not  necessarily  insur-
mountable,  and  careful  planning  could  minimize
them.  As  world  trade  increases,  new  mines  with
cleaner coal will become more available. For exam-
ple, coal mines being developed in Borneo are pro-
ducing a low-grade but very low-sulfur coal that for
coal is relatively clean. These clean coal deposits in
Borneo  are  thick  and  have  only  a  few  meters  of

FIGURE 16.11 Reclaimed land at the Trapper Mine, Colorado The

vegetated sites have been entirely reclaimed. (Edward A. Keller)

give  farmers  and  ranchers  the  opportunity  to  re-
strict or veto mining on their land, even if they do
not own the mineral rights.

Underground  mining  of  coal  and  other  resources
has  also  produced  hazards  and  caused  considerable
environmental  degradation.  For  example,  (1)  acid
water draining from mines has polluted streams; (2)
subsidence,  collapse  of  the  surface  of  the  land  into
pits over underground mines, has damaged buildings,
roads,  and  other  structures;  and  (3)  coal  ﬁres  that
start in mines can burn and smoke for years.

Future  Use  and  Environmental  Impacts  of
Coal. Limited resources of oil and natural gas and
concerns about the energy supply in California and
throughout the rest of the nation are increasing the
demand for coal, and the coal industry is planning
for increased mining activity. The crunch on the oil
supply is still years away, but when it occurs, it will
put pressure on the coal industry to open more and
larger  mines  in  both  the  eastern  and  the  western
coal beds of the United States. This solution to oil
shortages could have signiﬁcant environmental im-
pacts for several reasons:7,11,12

• More  and  more  land  will  be  strip  mined  and

will, thus, require careful restoration.

Coal Sludge in the Appalachian Mountains

Mining and processing coal in the
Appalachian Mountains produces a
lot of waste. Waste material, known
as coal sludge or slurry, generated by
processing coal, is a thick sludge
composed of water, with particles of
coal, rock, and clay. Coal sludge is
often stored in impoundments be-
hind a dam. West Virginia, Pennsylva-
nia, and Kentucky have hundreds of
coal sludge impoundments. There
have been nine failures of coal sludge
impoundments in the past 30 years.
A coal-waste dam on Buffalo Creek,
West Virginia, containing coal sludge
failed in 1972. The resulting ﬂood
killed 118 people and destroyed

about 500 homes. The Buffalo Creek
event resulted in suggestions, recom-
mendations, and regulations to mini-
mize the chances of future events.
Nevertheless, other events have oc-
curred, including one on October 11,
2000, when about 1 million m3 (250
million gal) of thick black coal sludge
was released into the Big Sandy River
system in southeastern Kentucky. The
sludge was stored in an impound-
ment located over an abandoned
coal mine. Collapse from the ﬂoor of
the impoundment into the mine al-
lowed the sludge to ﬂow through the
mine and into the environment over
people’s yards and roads and into a

tributary to the Big Sandy River. Over
100 km (65 mi) of river was severely
contaminated by the sludge. Life in
the river, including several hundred
thousand ﬁsh, was destroyed. The
spill was one of the worst environ-
mental disasters ever to occur in the
southern United States. The same im-
poundment had a similar but smaller
sludge spill in 1994 and was inspect-
ed as recently as 3 weeks before the
October 2000 spill. Recommenda-
tions following the 1994 spill may not
have been followed, and there was
not sufﬁcient hard rock above the
abandoned mine to support the
heavy sludge (Figure 16.A).15

overburden.14 Regardless  of  sources  and  quality,
there  may  be  few  alternatives  to  mining  tremen-
dous quantities of coal. In the future, vast amounts
of coal will be needed to feed thermoelectric power
plants  and  to  provide  oil  and  gas  by  gasiﬁcation
and liquefaction of coal. An important objective is
to ﬁnd ways to use coal that minimize environmen-

tal  disruption.  Environmental  costs  in  dollars  of
burning  coal  are  becoming  relatively  high  com-
pared to those of using natural gas due to pollution
abatement (i.e., cleaning coal and treating efﬂuent
from  power  plants).  The  cost  of  coal  exceeds  the
cost of natural gas, so if discoveries and production
of natural gas continue to grow as they did in 2010,

Fossil Fuels

less coal (relative to natural gas) may be mined and
burned in power plants.

Hydrocarbons: Oil and Gas
Oil,  called  crude  oil,  and  natural  gas  are  hydrocar-
bons,  made  up  of  carbon,  hydrogen,  and  oxygen.
Natural gas is mostly methane (CH4). Methane usu-
ally makes up more than 80 percent of the energy
gases  present  at  a  location.  Other  natural-energy
gases  include  ethane,  propane,  butane,  and  hydro-
gen.16 Like coal, the hydrocarbons are, for the most
part, fossil fuels, in that they form from organic ma-
terial  that  escaped  complete  decomposition  after
burial.  Oil  and  gas  are  found  in  concentrated  de-
posits,  which  have  been  heavily  mined  from  wells.
They are also found, in less readily available form, in
oil shale and tar sands.

Geology of Oil and Gas Deposits. Next to water,
oil is the most abundant ﬂuid in Earth’s crust, yet
the  processes  that  form  it  are  only  partly  under-
stood. Most Earth scientists accept that oil and nat-
ural gas are derived from organic materials that were
buried with marine or lake sediments. Favorable en-
vironments where organic debris might escape oxi-
dation  include  near-shore  areas  characterized  by
rapid deposition that quickly buries organic mater-
ial, or deeper-water areas characterized by a defi-
ciency in oxygen at the bottom that limits aerobic
decomposition.  In  addition,  the  locations  of  oil
and gas formation are generally classified as sub-
siding,  depositional  basins  (Figure  16.12)  in
which  older  sediment  is  continuously  buried  by
younger  sediment;  this  sequence  progressively
subjects the older, more deeply buried material to
higher temperatures and pressures.17

Oil  and  natural  gas  originate  primarily  in  ﬁne-
grained, organic-rich sediment, referred to as source
rock. It is buried to depths of 1 to 3 km (0.6 to 2 mi)
and  subjected  to  heat  and  pressure  that  physically

compress it. The elevated temperature and pressure,
along with other processes, start the chemical trans-
formation  of  organic  debris  into  thermogenic  oil
and  natural  gas  (Figure  16.13).  Natural  gas  that

forms  close  to  the  surface  of  Earth  by  biological
processes  is  called  biogenic  gas.  An  example  is  the
methane produced in landﬁlls as waste decays. After
their  formation,  the  thermogenic  hydrocarbons
begin an upward migration to a lower-pressure envi-
ronment with increased porosity. This primary mi-
gration  through  the  source  rock  merges  into  sec-
ondary migration as the hydrocarbons move more
freely into and through coarse-grained, more perme-
able rocks. These porous,  permeable rocks, such as
sandstone  or 
limestone,  are  called
reservoir rocks. If the path is clear to the surface, the
oil and gas migrate and escape there, and this may
explain why most oil and gas are found in geologi-
cally  young  rocks  (i.e.,  less  than  100  million  years
old): Hydrocarbons in older rocks have had a longer
time to reach the surface and leak out.17 The entire
process from initial deposition to deep burial often
takes millions of years.16 When oil and gas are im-
peded in their upward migration by a relatively im-
pervious  barrier,  they  accumulate  in  the  reservoir
rocks.  If  the  barrier,  or  cap  rock,  has  a  favorable
geometry, such as a dome or an anticline, the oil and
gas will be trapped in their upward movement at the
crest  of  the  dome  or  anticline  below  the  cap  rock
(Figure  16.13).17 Figure  16.14 shows  an  anticlinal
trap and two other possible traps caused by faulting
or  by  an  unconformity,  which  is  a  buried  erosion
surface.  These  are  not  the  only  possible  types  of
traps;  any  rock  that  has  a  relatively  high  porosity
and permeability that is connected to a source rock
containing hydrocarbons may become a reservoir. A
reservoir  will  form  if  upward  migration  of  the  oil
and gas is impeded by a cap rock that is positioned
to entrap the hydrocarbons at a central high point.14

Oil  Production. Production  wells  in  an  oil  ﬁeld
recover  oil  through  primary  or  enhanced  recovery
methods.  Primary  recovery uses  natural  reservoir
pressure  to  move  the  oil  to  the  well,  where  it  can
then  be  pumped  to  the  surface.  Normally,  this
pumping  delivers  no  more  than  25  percent  of  the
total petroleum in the reservoir. Increasing the re-
covery  rate  to  50  to  60  percent  or  more  requires
enhanced  recovery methods.  The  enhancement ma-
nipulates reservoir pressure by injection of natural
gas, water, steam, chemicals, or some combination
of  those,  into  the  reservoir,  pushing  petroleum  to
wells where it can be lifted to the surface by means
of  the  familiar  “horse  head”  bobbing  pumps,  sub-
mersible pumps, or other lift methods.

Oil  production  always  brings  to  the  surface  a
variable amount of salty water, or brine, along with
the oil. After the oil and water have been separated,
the brine must be disposed of because it is toxic to the
surface environment. Disposal can be accomplished
either  by  injection  as  part  of  secondary  recovery,
evaporation in lined open pits, or deep-well disposal
outside  the  ﬁeld.  Disposal  sites  in  oil  ﬁelds  were
some of the ﬁrst hazardous-waste disposal facilities,

552

CHAPTER 16

Energy Resources

and some eventually became sites for the disposal of
hazardous industrial wastes.

Distribution  and  Quantity  of Oil  and  Gas.
The distribution of oil and gas in space and geologic
time is rather complex, but, in general, three princi-
ples apply:

1. Commercial oil is produced almost exclusively
from  sedimentary  rocks  deposited  during  the
past 500 million years of Earth’s history.

2. Although  there  are  many  oil  ﬁelds  in  the
world,  most  of  the  total  production,  plus  re-
serves, occurs in a few percent of the produc-
ing ﬁelds.

3. Most of the world’s giant oil ﬁelds are located

near plate junctions that are known to have
been active in the past 70 million years.

It is difﬁcult to assess the petroleum reserves of
the  United  States,  much  less  those  of  the  entire
world. However, Figure 16.15 shows a recent esti-
mate of the world’s reserves of crude oil. Most (62
percent ) of the oil reserves are in the Middle East,
and a high percentage of the natural gas reserves are
in  the  former  Soviet  Union  and  the  Middle  East.
However,  recent  large  discoveries  of  natural  gas  in
the  United  States  suggest  that
reserves are growing, and that is
good  news.  The  numbers  for
crude oil do not suggest that we
are going to run out of oil soon.
However,  there  is  uncertainty
concerning the estimated size of
the oil reserves and potential re-
sources, and the peak in oil pro-
duction,  as  mentioned  earlier,
will  likely  occur  between  2020
and 2050.

is ongoing, and considerable amounts of new gas are
being  found  and  developed.  Two  recent  develop-
ments, coal-bed methane hydrates and tight natural
gas from shale, will be discussed in this chapter as
examples.  These  are  considered  nonconventional
gas sources, but they are quickly becoming conven-
tional in that they are widespread and growing. We
will  also  brieﬂy  discuss  methane  hydrates,  which
may be a future source of natural gas.

Coal-Bed  Methane. An  “energy  rush”  is  taking
place in the coalﬁelds of the western United States.
The coal contains a large amount of methane stored
on  surfaces  of  the  organic  matter  in  the  coal.
Methane reserves in the Wyoming region, including
the Wasatch and Power River basins, are sufﬁcient
to  provide  all  the  natural  gas  used  by  the  United
States for 5 years. More than 10,000 wells to recover
the  methane  have  already  been  drilled,  and  there
may  eventually  be  10  times  this  many.  Coal-bed
methane (i.e.,  natural  gas)  wells  are  shallow  and
much  more  economical  to  drill  than  are  typical  oil
wells.  This  relatively  new  source  of  methane  is
promising and will reduce the amount of energy we
must  import.  However,  there  are  environmental
concerns associated with intensive development of
coal-bed methane:18

Natural  gas  is  a  relatively
clean  fuel,  compared  with  coal
and oil, and it has the potential
to replace coal and oil during the
transition from fossil fuels to al-
ternative  energy  sources.  The
worldwide amount of natural gas
is  very  large,  enough  to  last
about  a  century  at  recent  rates
of consumption. Exploration for
natural gas in the United States

• Disposal  of  salty  water  that  is  produced  with

the methane

• Use of groundwater resources that could oth-

erwise be used for agriculture

• Migration of methane (a ﬂammable, explosive

gas) away from well sites

• Reduction of crop production, if salty water is

used to irrigate crops

• Pollution  of  stream  water  and  loss  of  spring
ﬂow as groundwater is extracted and disposed
mine water enters streams and rivers

• Erosion and runoff of land disturbed for roads,
well  sites,  processing,  and  transportation  of
methane

In  summary,  coal-bed  methane  is  an  important
energy source. However, its extraction, processing,
and  transportation  to  users  must  be  closely  evalu-
ated to determine how best to reduce or eliminate
potential  adverse  environmental  effects.  Then,
steps to protect the environment should be imple-
mented in the form of laws and policy, just as we at-
tempt to do for other types of energy exploitation
and use. Extraction of any fossil fuel is inherently a
process  with  potential  to  harm  the  environment,
and coal-bed methane is not an exception.

Black  Shale  (Tight  Natural  Gas). Devonian
shale  buried  1  km  or  so  beneath  northern  Ap-
palachia contains as much as 500 trillion ft3 of nat-
ural gas, of which 10 percent is a potential resource.
The methane, known as tight gas, is distributed in
very  small  tight  openings  throughout  the  black
shale. Tight gas is an unconventional reservoir com-
pared to conventional natural gas reservoirs where
methane is in pockets related to geologic structure
(see  ﬁgure  16.13).  The  vast  area  dominated  by 
the Marcellus Shale (that contains tight gas) is shown
in  Figure  16.16.19 Recovery  of  the  methane  is
costly, as deep wells that turn at depth to a horizon-
tal position are necessary (Figure 16.17). Water and
other chemicals are then used to fracture the rocks
(i.e.,  hydrofracturing)  to  facilitate  recovery  of  the
gas. Most of the gas is in very small pore spaces in
the ﬁne-grained shale, with some gas also in vertical
fractures (i.e., joints) and some adsorbed on mineral
grains and organic material in the rock.

An energy rush is now occurring to recover tight
natural gas. Thousands of new wells have been per-
mitted  in  Pennsylvania  alone  (see  photograph

Fossil Fuels

553

opening this chapter). Other areas with tight gas in-
clude  the  Barnett  Shale  in  Texas,  the  Haynesville
Shale  in  Louisiana,  and  the  Fayetteville  Shale  in
Arkansas.  Property  owners  in  promising  areas  of
Pennsylvania are receiving signing bonuses of up to
$2,000 per acre, and gas royalties from a single large
well  can  be  ﬁnancially  rewarding.  Many  thousands
of new jobs could come to the region as the gas ﬁelds
are developed.

There  is  concern  that  drilling  and  hydrofractur-
ing could result in contamination of water resources.
The  wells  require  a  lot  of  water,  and  chemicals  are
also  used  as  part  of  the  extraction  process.  About
34,000 m3 (9  million  gal)  of  wastewater  per  day
was produced in 2009 by gas wells in Pennsylvania
alone. Also, the natural water in the shale where gas
is  extracted  may  have  contaminants,  such  as  the
metal cadmium and benzene (a toxic hydrocarbon),
as  well  as  methane.  The  wastewater  also  contains
dissolved  salts  that  can  render  the  water  several

(each  costing  as  much  as  several  tens
of millions of dollars) dedicated to the
wastewater  from  the  gas  drilling  may
be necessary.

A gas well being drilled in Pennsyl-
vania in June 2010 had a blowout fail-
ure  that  released  gas  and  wastewater
at  the  surface.  Fortunately,  an  explo-
sion  did  not  occur,  and  pollution  by
wastewater did not continue for a long
time.  However,  such  blowouts  could
be  catastrophic,  as  we  learned  from
the  oil  spill  in  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  in
2010. The U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion  Agency  has  been  directed  to
study  safety  issues  associated  with
drilling for natural gas, and a report is
due out in 2012. The city of New York
is  very  concerned  that  drilling  could
contaminate  its  water  supply,  which
comes  from  upstate  New  York.  The
city  has  all  but  banned  drilling  gas
wells  in  watersheds  from  which  the
city receives its water supply.

times  as  salty  as  seawater.  As  a  result,  wastewater
from gas wells can be a serious water pollutant. Re-
portedly,  the  Monongahela  River  in  Pennsylvania
has  been  contaminated  by  salty  water,  presumably
from wastewater from gas wells. The salty water cor-
roded  equipment  in  power  plants  that  extracted
water  from  the  river,  and  residents  reported  that
dishwashers were malfunctioning. The quick ﬁx was
to  reduce  the  amount  of  wastewater  from  the
drilling that was discharged to the river and release
water  from  upstream  dams  to  dilute  the  pollu-
tants.  A  long-term  solution  will  require  water
treatment plants for the wastewater. However, the
rate of production of wastewater from gas drilling
in  Pennsylvania  may  double  in  coming  years,  re-
quiring  several  new  treatment  plants;  a  typical
plant can handle about 1,500 m3 (0.4 million gallons)
of wastewater per day. Several present sewage waste-
water  treatment  plants  on  the  Monongahela  River

Methane  Hydrate. It  has  been
known for years that methane hydrate
deposits  exist  at  depths  of  about
1,000 m (3,300 ft) beneath the sea. Methane hydrate
is a white, ice-like material composed of molecules
of  methane  gas  surrounded  by  “cages”  of  frozen
water. The frozen water cages are formed as a result
of microbial digestion of organic matter in the sedi-
ments. Methane hydrate deposits are also found on
land; the ﬁrst land deposits discovered were in per-
mafrost areas of Siberia and North America, where
they are called marsh gas.

Methane hydrate deposits are found throughout
both  the  Paciﬁc  and  Atlantic  Oceans.  Methane  hy-
drates in the marine environment are a potential re-
source, with approximately twice as much carbon as
all  the  other  known  natural  gas,  oil,  and  coal  de-
posits  on  Earth.20 Methane  hydrate  deposits  have
the potential to supply some of the energy needs of
the world in the future, if they can be captured. Fur-
thermore, present gas deposits on land are plentiful,
and extraction is not expensive.

Impact of Exploration and Devel-
opment. The  environmental  impact
of oil and gas exploration and develop-
ment  varies  from  negligible—such  as
remote-sensing techniques used in ex-
ploration—to  signiﬁcant—such  as  the
unavoidable impact of projects like the
Trans-Alaska  Pipeline.  The  impact  of
exploration for oil and gas can include
building roads, conducting exploratory
drilling,  and building  a  supply  line  to
remote  areas.  Except 
in  sensitive
areas, including some semiarid-to-arid
environments  and  some  permafrost
areas,  these  activities  generally  cause
few  adverse  effects  to  the  landscape
and resources.

Development  of  oil  and  gas  ﬁelds
involves  drilling  wells  on  land  or  be-
neath the sea; disposing of wastewater
brought to the surface with the petro-
leum; transporting the oil by tankers,
pipelines,  or  other  methods  to  re-
ﬁneries; and converting the crude oil
into  useful  products.  At  every  step,
there  is  a  well-documented  potential
for environmental disruption, includ-
ing  problems  associated  with  waste-
water  disposal,  accidental  oil  spills,
leaking  pipes  in  oil  ﬁelds,  shipwrecks
of tankers, and air pollution at reﬁner-
ies.  For  instance,  serious  oil  spills
along  the  coastlines  of  Europe  and
North  America  have  spoiled  beaches,
estuaries, and harbors; killed marine life and birds;
polluted groundwater and surface water; and caused
economic problems for coastal areas that depend on
tourist trade.

As a result of current energy shortages, there is
pressure to develop new oil ﬁelds in offshore areas
and  wilderness  areas,  such  as  the  Arctic  National
Wildlife  Refuge  (ANWR)  in  Alaska,  where  several
billion barrels of oil are located (Figure 16.18).

The argument in favor of exploration and devel-
opment  of  oil  in  ANWR  is  threefold.  First,  the
United States needs more oil, and the oil in ANWR
would reduce the amount of oil we import. Second,
new  oil  development  will  bring  jobs  and  economic
growth to Alaska. Third, new techniques for explo-

ration and drilling of oil wells have caused less ad-
verse environmental damage than previous develop-
ment (Figure 16.19a).

These techniques include:
• Using  directional  drilling  from  central  loca-
tions  where  many  wells  form  a  single  site,
spread out underground like the spokes of a bi-
cycle wheel (Figure 16.19a). This technique re-
duces  the  land  area  disturbed  by  drilling  to
sites of about 40 ha (100 acres).

• Elevating pipelines above ground to allow ani-

mal migration (Figure 16.19b).

• Avoiding  construction  of  permanent  roads.
Roads are made of ice in the winter and melt in
the summer (Figure 16.19a).

Opponents  of  the  exploration  and  development

of oil in ANWR contend that:

• Even  the  most  favorable  technology  will  ad-

versely affect ANWR.

• Some  wilderness  areas  should  remain  wilder-
ness,  and  drilling  will  permanently  change
ANWR.

• Development of oil ﬁelds is inherently damag-
ing because it requires an extensive industrial
complex  of  machines,  vehicles,  pipelines,  and
people.

• The oil beneath ANWR will not be a signiﬁcant
contribution to the U.S. oil supply. Although it
would be spread out over decades, providing a
few percent of our total oil consumption dur-
ing  that  time,  in  total,  the  ANWR  oil  itself
would provide only about a 6-month to 2-year
supply of oil.

The  decision  concerning  development  of  oil  at
ANWR reﬂects the relationship between science and
values. Science says we can develop the oil with less
environmental  damage  than  in  the  past.  But  even
“less than in the past” may be too much. Our values
will be determined by balancing our economic need
for  oil  against  our  desire  to  preserve  a  pristine
wilderness area.

Impact of Use. A familiar and serious impact as-
sociated with oil is air pollution produced in urban
areas when fossil fuels are burned to produce energy
for electricity, heat, and automobiles. Also, as does
burning  coal,  burning  oil  and  gas  releases  carbon
dioxide, the major human-produced greenhouse gas
(see Chapter 18).

Oil Shales and Tar Sands. Recovering petroleum
from surface or near-surface oil shale and tar sands
involves  the  use  of  well-established  techniques.  We
need economic methods for developing oil shale re-
sources that will minimize environmental disruption.
Oil shale is a ﬁne-grained sedimentary rock con-
taining  organic  matter  that,  when  heated,  yields
signiﬁcant amounts of oil and gas—oil yield is gen-
erally  100  to  200  L  per  ton  of  oil  shale—that  are
otherwise insoluble in ordinary petroleum solvents.
This process is known as destructive distillation. The
best-known oil shales in the United States are found
in  the  50-million-year-old  Green  River  Formation

Future of Oil

557

that underlies parts of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.
The Green River Formation consists of oil shale in-
terbedded with variable amounts of sandstone, silt-
stone,  claystone,  and  compacted  volcanic  ash.  The
oil shale resource is huge. About 100 billion barrels
of  oil  could  potentially  be  recovered.  Mining  of  oil
shale, using known technology, is expensive. Never-
theless,  as  oil  prices  rise,  oil-shale  mining  is  being
reconsidered.21

Tar sands are rocks that are impregnated with tar
oil,  asphalt,  or  other  petroleum  materials.  The  re-
covery of any of these petroleum materials by tradi-
tional  methods  is  not  commercially  possible.  The
term tar sand is somewhat confusing because it in-
cludes  several  rock  types,  such  as  shale  and  lime-
stone,  as  well  as  unconsolidated  and  consolidated
sandstone. However, these rocks all contain a vari-
ety  of  semiliquid,  semisolid,  and  solid  petroleum
products.  Some  of  these  products  ooze  from  the
rock; others are difﬁcult to remove, even with boil-
ing  water.22 Although  similar  to  oil  pumped  from
wells, the oil from tar sands is much more viscous
and, therefore, more difﬁcult to recover. One possi-
ble conclusion concerning the geology of tar sands is
that  they  form  in  essentially  the  same  way  as  the
more  ﬂuid  oil  but,  because  much  more  of  the
volatiles and accompanying liquids in the reservoir
rocks  have  escaped,  the  more  viscous  components
remain as tar sands.

Large  accumulations  of  tar  sands  have  been
identiﬁed. For example, the Athabasca Tar Sands of
Alberta,  Canada,  cover  an  area  of  approximately
78,000 km2 (30,116 mi2) and contain an estimated
reserve of 300 billion barrels of oil that might be re-
covered. About half of it (173 billion barrels) can be
economically  recovered  today.  These  tar  sands  are
now  yielding  about  1  million  barrels  of  synthetic
crude  oil  per  day  from  large  strip  mines.22 Today,
the  United  States  imports  more  oil  from  Canada
than from any other country (19 percent ), and, of
this, about one-half comes from oil sands.14,22

16.5 Future of Oil
Recent estimates of proven oil reserves in the world
suggest  that,  at  present  production  rates,  oil  and
natural gas will last a few decades.5,23 However, the
important  question  to  ask  is  not  how  long  oil  will
last  at  present  and  future  production  rates,  but  at

558

CHAPTER 16

Energy Resources

what  point  will  we  reach  peak  production?  This
question  is  important  because,  once  we  have
reached peak production, less oil will be available,
and there will be shortages and price shocks. The
world oil production peak is likely to occur within
the  lifetime  of  many  people  living  today,24 much
sooner than generally expected by most people. As
a  result,  there  may  be  little  time  left  to  adjust  to
potential  changes  in  lifestyle  and  economies  in  a
postpetroleum  era.  Walter  Youngquist,  an  energy
expert, argues that we are fortunate to be living in
a prosperous period of human history, made possi-
ble by our inheritance of a 500-million-year period
of  oil-forming  processes.24 We  will  never  entirely
run out of crude oil, but people of the world cur-
rently  depend  upon  oil  for  about  40  percent  of
their  energy,  and  signiﬁcant  shortages  will  cause
major problems.24,25

The  following  factors  provide  evidence  that  we

are heading toward a potential crude oil crisis:

• We  are  approaching  the  time  when  approxi-
mately one-half of the total crude oil from tra-
ditional  oil  ﬁelds  on  Earth  will  have  been
consumed.24 Revisit  peak  oil  (section  16.2)
near the beginning of this chapter. Recent esti-
mates suggest that the world may have about
20  percent  more  oil  awaiting  discovery  than
predicted a few years ago. Furthermore, more
oil  exists  in  known  ﬁelds  than  was  earlier
thought.  However,  the  United  States  has  al-
ready  consumed  approximately  half  of  its  oil
resources, necessitating additional oil imports
in the future.

• Proven world reserves total approximately 1 to
2 trillion barrels.3,25 It is estimated that about
3 trillion barrels of crude oil may ultimately be
recovered from remaining oil resources.

• World  consumption  today  is  about  31  billion
barrels  per  year  (85  million  barrels  per  day),
and, for every 3 barrels of oil consumed, only
1 barrel is discovered.25

• The  predicted  decline  in  oil  production  is
based  on  the  estimated  amount  of  oil  that
may  ultimately  be  recoverable,  as  well  as  on
projections of new discoveries and rates of fu-
ture  consumption.  The  peak  in  world  crude
oil production (35 billion barrels per year) is
predicted to occur from about 2015 to 2030,
depending upon whether you are an optimist
or  a  pessimist.23 Production  of  35  billion 

barrels per year is nearly a 10 percent increase
over  production  today.  Whether  or  not  you
believe  the  increased  production  will  be  a
problem  depends  on  your  view  of  predicted
shortages,  based  on  the  past  history  of  oil
consumption.  We  have  survived  several  pre-
dicted  shortages  in  the  past.  However,  most
oil experts believe that peak oil is only a few
decades away.5,6

• It is predicted that signiﬁcant production of oil
in the United States will not extend beyond the
year 2090. The world production of oil will be
nearly exhausted by 2100.25

What  is  an  appropriate  response  to  these  state-
ments? We need to begin with a major educational
program that informs both people and governments
of the potential oil depletion in the twenty-ﬁrst cen-
tury. We are currently operating in ignorance or de-
nial  in  the  face  of  a  potentially  serious  situation.
Planning  and  education  are  important  in  order  to
avoid  future  military  confrontations  like  the  Gulf
War and food shortages due to the reduced availabil-
ity of oil to produce fertilizers for agriculture. Before
signiﬁcant oil shortages occur, we should transition
from oil to: natural gas with gasiﬁcation and lique-
faction of our tremendous coal reserves; oil and gas
from  oil  shale;  atomic  energy;  and  alternative  en-
ergy  sources,  including  solar  energy,  wind  power,
and  hydrogen.  Following  the  transition,  the  vast
majority  of  our  energy  should  come  from  sources
that  are  environmentally  clean,  safe,  and  sustain-
able.  Changes  during  the  transition  from  oil  will
strongly effect our present petroleum-based society.
However,  there  appears  to  be  no  insurmountable
problem  if  we  implement  meaningful  short-  and
long-range  plans  to  simultaneously  phase  out  oil,
transition  to  natural  gas,  and  phase  in  alternative
energy sources.

Having  obtained  a  better  understanding  of  the
nature  and  abundance  of  the  fossil  fuels,  we  will
now turn to the topic of acid rain, a major environ-
mental consequence of burning fossil fuels.

16.6 Fossil Fuel and Acid Rain
Acid rain is thought to be a regional to global envi-
ronmental problem related to the burning of fossil
fuels. Although acid rain is caused primarily by coal

burning,  gasoline  combustion  also  contributes  to
the  problem.  Acid  rain refers  to  both  wet  and  dry
acid  deposition.  Wet acid  deposition  occurs  when
pollutants,  acid  precursors  such  as  sulfur  dioxide
(SO2)  and  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx),  react  with  water
vapor in the atmosphere, producing acids. Dry acid
deposition occurs when the particles containing acid
precursors fall to Earth and then react with water to
produce acids. Therefore, although the term acid rain
is more commonly used, acid deposition is a more pre-
cise term. Acid rain is deﬁned as precipitation whose
pH is below 5.6. The pH is a numerical value of the
relative concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a so-
lution that is used to describe the solution’s acidity.
A solution with a pH of 7 is a neutral solution, one
that  is  neither  acidic  nor  basic.  Natural  rainfall  is
slightly acidic with a pH of approximately 5.6, caused
by  water  in  the  atmosphere com-
bining  with 
carbon  dioxide
to  produce  a  weak  carbonic  acid
. The pH
scale  is  a  negative  logarithmic
scale; for example, a pH value of 3
is 10 times more acidic than a pH
value  of  4  and  100  times  more
acidic than a pH value of 5 (Figure
16.20). Rainfall in Wheeling, West
Virginia,  was  once  measured  at  a
pH value of 1.5, nearly as acidic as
stomach  acid,  and  pH  values  as
low  as  3  have  been  recorded  in
other locations.

Pollutants

Today,  burning  of  fossil  fuel  in
the United States annually releases
about  17  million  tons  of  nitrogen
oxide and 13 million tons of sulfur
dioxide into the atmosphere. After
emission,  these  oxides  are  trans-
formed to sulfate (SO4) or nitrate
(NO3)  particles  that  can  combine
with  water  vapor  to  eventually
form  sulfuric  (H2SO4)  and  nitric
(HNO3)  acids.  These  acids  may
travel  long  distances  with  prevail-
ing  winds  and  be  deposited  as  acid  rain  (Figure
16.21).  The  acid  rain  problem  we  are  most  familiar
with  results  from  sulfur  dioxide,  which  is  primarily
emitted from burning coal in power plants that pro-
duce electricity in the eastern United States.

Environmental Effects of Acid Rain
Geology,  climate  patterns,  type  of  vegetation,  and
composition of soil all affect potential impacts of acid
rain. Figure 16.22 shows areas in the United States
that  are  sensitive  to  acid  rain,  and  identiﬁcation  of

High sensitivity

Moderate sensitivity

Low sensitivity

these areas is based on some of the above-mentioned
factors.  Particularly  sensitive  areas  are  those  in
which the bedrock, soils, or water cannot buffer the
acid input. For instance, areas dominated by granitic
rocks have little buffering action. Buffering refers to
the  ability  of  a  material  to  neutralize  acids.  These
materials, known as buffers, include calcium carbon-
ate or calcite (CaCO3), found in many types of soils
and rock, such as limestone. The calcium carbonate
reacts  with  and  removes  the  hydrogen  ions  in  the
–)
acidic  water  by  forming  bicarbonate  ions  (HCO3
and neutralizing the acid.

The  major  environmental  effects  of  acid  rain 

include:

animals that feed on these plants have little
to eat. This degradation is passed up the food
chain  to  the  fish  and  other  larger  animals.
Examples  of  adverse  effects  of  acid  rain  on
lake systems have been found in Canada and
Scandinavia.

• Damage to human structures. Acid rain dam-
ages  building  materials,  plastics,  cement,  ma-
sonry,  galvanized  steel,  and  several  types  of
rocks,  especially  limestone,  sandstone,  and
marble  (Figure  16.23).  In  cities  around  the
world, irreplaceable statues and buildings have
been signiﬁcantly damaged, resulting in losses
of billions of dollars per year.

• Damage to vegetation. Acid rain is detrimen-
tal  to  vegetation,  especially  forest  resources,
such  as  evergreen  trees  in  Germany  and  red
spruce  trees  in  Vermont.  The  soil’s  fertility
may  be  reduced,  either  because  nutrients  are
leached out by the acid or because the acid re-
leases toxic substances into the soil. This is the
main effect of acid rain on vegetation.

• Damage  to  lake  ecosystems. Acid  rain  may
damage lake ecosystems by (1) disrupting the
life cycles of fish, frogs, and crayfish and (2)
interfering with the natural cycling of nutri-
ents  and  other  chemical  elements  necessary
for life. The acid rain tends to keep the nutri-
ents  in  solution,  so  that  they  leave  the  lake
rather than being cycled in the system. As a
result,  aquatic  plants  may  not  grow,  and

A Solution to the Acid Rain Problem
Lake acidiﬁcation can be offset by periodic addition
of a buffer material, such as calcium carbonate. Al-
though this remedy has been used in several areas,
including  New  York  State,  Sweden,  and  Canada,
adding buffer material to lakes is a short-term, ex-
pensive solution to lake acidiﬁcation. The only prac-
tical long-term solution to the acid rain problem is
to reduce the emissions of the chemicals that cause
the problem. From an environmental viewpoint, the
best  way  to  reduce  emissions  is  to  practice  strong
energy  conservation,  which  would  result  in  lower
emissions. The second-best way is to treat the coal
before, during, and after burning, in order to inter-
cept the sulfur dioxide before it is released into the

environment.  Reduction  of  nitrogen  oxide  is  more
difﬁcult  because  it  is  primarily  caused  by  gasoline
burning 
in  automobiles.  Nevertheless,  control
strategies exist to reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx.
It  is  encouraging  that  the  reduction  of  pollutants
causing acid rain is a successful national and inter-
national goal. Unfortunately, the acid rain problem
will not go away soon, even with lower emissions of
acid  precursors.  Acid  deposition  has  been  accumu-
lating in soils for decades, and its effects will linger
for decades to come.26,27

16.7 Nuclear Energy
Energy from Fission
Production  of  nuclear  energy relies  mostly  on  ﬁs-
sion. Nuclear ﬁssion is the splitting of atomic nuclei
by neutron bombardment. Fission of the nucleus of
a  uranium-235  atom,  for  example,  releases  three

neutrons,  ﬁssion  fragments  composed  of  the  nu-
clei  of  radioactive  elements  that  are  lighter  than
uranium,  and  energy  in  the  form  of  heat  (see  A
Closer Look: Radioactivity). The released neutrons
strike  other  U-235  atoms,  releasing  more  neu-
trons, ﬁssion products, and heat. The process con-
tinues  in  a  chain  reaction,  and,  as  more  and  more
uranium  is  split,  it  releases  ever  more  neutrons
(Figure  16.24,  page  564).  An  uncontrolled  chain
reaction—the  kind  used  in  nuclear  weapons—
leads quickly to an explosion. However, sustained
or stable nuclear reactions in reactors are used to
provide heat for the generation of electricity.

The  ﬁrst  controlled  nuclear  ﬁssion  was  demon-
strated  in  1942,  leading  the  way  for  the  use  of
uranium  in  explosives  and  as  a  heat  source  that
provides  steam  for  electricity  generation.  Fission
of  1  kg  (2.2  lb)  of  uranium  releases  approximately
the  same  amount  of  energy  as  the  burning  of  16
metric tons of coal.

atomic number of 92, but their atom-
ic mass numbers are 235 and 238, re-
spectively. These isotopes may be
written as uranium-235 and uranium-
238, or U-235 and U-238, respectively.

Some isotopes, called

radioisotopes, are radioactive and
spontaneously undergo nuclear
decay. Nuclear decay occurs when a
radioisotope undergoes a nuclear
change while emitting one or more
forms of radioactive radiation. The
three major kinds of radiation emit-
ted during nuclear decay are called
alpha particles (α), beta particles (β),
and gamma radiation (γ). Each ra-
dioisotope has its own characteristic
emissions; some isotopes emit only
one type of radiation, while others
emit a mixture of radiation types.

Alpha particles consist of two pro-
tons and two neutrons, making them
much more massive than other types
of radioactive emission. Because
alpha decay, emission of an alpha par-
ticle, changes the number of protons
and neutrons in the atom’s nucleus,
the isotope is changed into an isotope
of a different element. For example, a
radon-222 atom, which has 86 pro-
tons, emits an alpha particle and is
thereby transformed into a polonium-

218 atom, which has 84 protons. 
Because of their great mass, alpha par-
ticles are the slowest-moving of the 
radioactive emissions and have the
lowest energy. They travel the shortest
distances—approximately 5 to 8 cm
(2 to 3 in.) in air—and penetrate solid
matter less deeply than do beta or
gamma emissions.29

Beta particles are energetic elec-

trons that have a small mass com-
pared with alpha particles. Beta
decay occurs when one of the neu-
trons in the nucleus of the isotope
spontaneously changes.29 Note that
the electron emitted is a product of
the transformation; remember that
electrons are found surrounding the
nucleus, not in it.

In gamma radiation, gamma rays
are emitted from the isotope, but the
number of protons and the number of
neutrons in the nucleus are un-
changed. Gamma rays are similar to
medical X-rays, but they are usually
more energetic and more penetrating.
Gamma rays have the highest energy
of all radioactive emissions; they travel
faster and farther and penetrate more
deeply than do alpha or beta particles.

An important characteristic of a
radioisotope is its half-life, which is

the time required for one-half of a
given amount of the isotope to
decay to another form. Every ra-
dioisotope has a unique, characteris-
tic half-life. Radon-222, for example,
has a relatively short half-life of 
3.8 days. Carbon-14, a radioactive
isotope of carbon, has a half-life of
5,570 years; U-235 has a half-life of
700 million years; and U-238 has a
half-life of 4.5 billion years.

Some radioisotopes, particularly

those of very heavy elements, un-
dergo a series of radioactive decay
steps, until they ﬁnally become a sta-
ble, or nonradioactive, isotope.
Figure 16.B shows the decay chain
from U-238 through radium-226,
radon-222, and polonium-218 to the
stable isotope of lead-206. The two
most important facts about each
transformation are the type of radia-
tion emitted and the half-life of the
isotope that is transformed (Figure
16.B). The decay from one radioiso-
tope to another is often stated in
terms of parent and daughter atoms.
For example, the parent radon-222, a
gas with a half-life of 3.8 days, decays
by alpha emission to its daughter,
polonium-218, a solid with a half-life
of 187 seconds.29

Three  isotopes  of  uranium  are  found  in  a  natu-
rally  occurring  uranium  sample:  U-238,  which  ac-
counts  for  approximately  99.3  percent  of  natural
uranium; U-235, which makes up just under 0.7 per-
cent; and U-234, which makes up about 0.005 per-
cent.  Uranium-235  is  the  only  naturally  occurring
ﬁssionable  material  and  is,  therefore,  essential  to
the  production  of  nuclear  energy.  Naturally  occur-
ring uranium is processed to increase the amount of
U-235 from 0.7 percent to about 3 percent before it
is  used  in  a  reactor.  The  processed  fuel  is  called
enriched uranium. Uranium-238 is not naturally ﬁs-
sionable,  but  it  is  “fertile  material”  because,  upon
bombardment by neutrons, it is converted to pluto-
nium-239, which is ﬁssionable.28

Geology and Distribution 
of Uranium
The natural concentration of uranium in Earth’s crust
averages  approximately  2  parts  per  million  (ppm).
Uranium originates in magma and is concentrated to
about 4 ppm in granitic rock, where it is found in a
variety  of  minerals.  Some  uranium  is  also  found  in
late-stage igneous rocks, such as pegmatites.

Uranium forms a large number of minerals, many
of which have been found and mined. Three types of
deposits have produced most of the uranium in the
last few years: sandstone impregnated with uranium
minerals, veins of uranium-bearing materials local-
ized in rock fractures, and 2.2-billion-year-old placer
deposits, now coarse-grained sedimentary rock.

ing more neutrons, ﬁssion fragments, and energy. As the process continues, a chain re-
action develops.

Reactor Design and Operation
Most  reactors  today  consume  more  fissionable
material  than  they  produce  and  are  known  as
burner reactors. The reactor itself is part of the nu-
clear  steam  supply  system,  which  produces  the
steam to run the turbine generators that produce
electricity.

The main components of the reactor are the core,
control rods, coolant, and reactor vessel. The core of
the reactor, where the chain reaction takes place, is
contained  in  a  heavy  stainless  steel  reactor  vessel.
For increased safety and security, the entire reactor
is contained in a reinforced concrete building called

a containment structure. Fuel consists of small, ce-
ramic,  enriched  uranium,  packed  together  into
fuel subassemblies  in  the  core.  A  stable  ﬁssion
chain  reaction  is  maintained  by  controlling  fuel
concentration and the number of released neutrons
that are available to cause ﬁssion. A minimum fuel
concentration  is  necessary  to  keep  the  chain  reac-
tion self-sustaining, or critical; control of the num-
ber of neutrons is necessary to regulate the reaction
rate.  The  number  of  neutrons  is  controlled  by  the
control  rods,  which  contain  materials  that  capture
neutrons, preventing them from bombarding other
nuclei. When the rods are pulled out of the core, the

chain  reaction  speeds  up;  when  they  are  inserted
into the core, the reaction slows down.

Pumps circulate a coolant, usually water, through
the reactor, extracting the heat produced by ﬁssion
in the reactor. The rate of generation of heat must
match the rate at which heat is carried away by the
coolant. Matching the rates is usually not difﬁcult,
and reactors usually run smoothly and stably. How-
ever, the major nuclear accidents that have occurred
happened when something went wrong and heat in
the reactor core built up. A meltdown refers to a nu-
clear accident in which the nuclear fuel becomes so
hot that it forms a molten mass. The containment
of the reactor fails, and radioactivity contaminates
the environment.

features.  Other  EPRs,  including  some  in  the
United States, are being planned for, as the global
nuclear  power  industry  continues  to  develop  and
grow.30,31

Risks Associated 
with Fission Reactors
Nuclear  energy  and  the  possible  adverse  effects
associated with it have been subjects of vigorous de-
bate. The debate is healthy because we should con-
tinue to examine the consequences of nuclear power
generation very carefully.

Other parts of the nuclear power
system  are  the  primary  coolant
loops  and  pumps,  which  circulate
the coolant through the reactor, and
heat  exchangers  or  steam  genera-
tors,  which  use  the  ﬁssion-heated
coolant to make steam.

The  reactor  shown  in  Figure
16.25 is a pressurized water reactor
(PWR). PWRs were initially designed
in the United States, and 70 percent
of  U.S.  nuclear  reactors  are  PWRs.
They have been modiﬁed in France
and Germany to the EPR, where the
E stands for European and PR means
it uses pressurized water in the pri-
mary (radioactive) loop to keep the
water from boiling. The EPR design
has  improved  safety  measures  de-
signed to further reduce the proba-
bility  of  a  core  meltdown;  reduce
the possibility of massive release of
radioactivity; and, in the event of a
low  pressure  core  meltdown,  limit
the  time  and  area  of  a  massive  re-
lease of radioactivity.

The ﬁrst EPR reactor (1,600 MW)
began in Finland in 2005. Scheduled
to begin operation in 2009, it is now
delayed to at least 2012. The delay,
accompanied  by  large  cost  over-
runs  related  to  organizational  and
construction  problems  (i.e.,  con-
crete  and  welding),  have  raised
concern.  However,  the  EPR  design

CHAPTER 16

Energy Resources

Nuclear ﬁssion uses and produces radioactive iso-
topes. Various amounts of radiation are released into
the  environment  at  every  step  of  the  nuclear  cycle:
mining and processing of uranium, controlled ﬁssion
in reactors, reprocessing of nuclear fuel, and ﬁnal dis-
posal  of  the  radioactive  wastes.  Serious  hazards  are
associated with transporting and disposing of nuclear
material, as well as with supplying other nations with
reactors. Furthermore, since the plutonium produced
by  nuclear  reactors  can  be  used  to  make  nuclear
weapons, terrorist activity and the possibility of irre-
sponsible actions by governments add a risk that is
present in no other form of energy production.

An  uncontrolled  chain  reaction—a  nuclear 
explosion—cannot  occur  in  a  nuclear  reactor  be-
cause the ﬁssionable material is not used in the con-
centrated form necessary for an explosion. However,
unwanted  chemical  reactions  in  a  reactor  can  pro-
duce explosions that release radioactive substances
into the environment. Although the chance of a dis-
astrous  accident  is  estimated  to  be  very  low,  it  in-
creases with every reactor put into operation. Major
accidents  have  already  occurred,  including  Three
Mile Island near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1979,
and the disastrous accident at Chernobyl in the for-
mer Soviet Union, now Ukraine, in 1986.

Three  Mile  Island. One  of  the  most  serious
events in the history of U.S. nuclear power occurred
on March 28, 1979, at the Three Mile Island nuclear
power  plant  near  Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania.  The
malfunction of a valve and human errors at the nu-
clear plant resulted in a partial core meltdown, with
the  release  of  radioisotopes  into  the  environment.
Although intense radiation was released into the in-
terior of the containment structure, it functioned as
designed, and only a relatively small amount of radi-
ation was released into the environment.

The  Three  Mile  Island  incident  clearly  demon-
strated that there are potential problems with nu-
clear  power.  Historically,  nuclear  power  had  been
relatively  safe,  and  the  state  of  Pennsylvania  was
unprepared for the accident. One of the serious im-
pacts of the incident was fear, but, surprisingly, no
staff  member  from  the  Department  of  Health  was
allowed to sit in on brieﬁng sessions.

Because the long-term chronic effects of exposure
to  low  levels  of  radiation  are  not  well  understood,
the effects of Three Mile Island exposure, although
apparently small, are not easy to estimate. Further-

more, the Three Mile Island accident illustrates that
our  society  needs  to  improve  the  way  in  which  it
handles crises arising from the release of pollutants
created by our modern technologies.32

Chernobyl. Lack  of  preparedness  was  dramati-
cally illustrated by events that started on the morn-
ing of Monday, April 28, 1986. Workers at a nuclear
facility in Sweden, frantically searching for the source
of  elevated  levels  of  radiation  near  their  power
plant,  concluded  that  it  was  not  their  facility  that
was leaking radiation but that the radioactivity was
coming from the Soviet Union, by way of prevailing
winds. Confronted, the Soviets admitted that there
had been an accident at their nuclear power plant at
Chernobyl on April 26. This was the ﬁrst notice that
the world’s worst accident in the history of nuclear
power had occurred.

It is believed that the system that supplies cool-
ing waters for the Chernobyl reactor failed as a re-
sult of human error. This caused the temperature of
the  reactor  core  to  rise  to  over  3,000°C  (about
5,400°F), melting the uranium fuel. Explosions blew
off the top of the building over the reactor, and the
graphite surrounding the fuel rods ignited. The ﬁres
produced  a  cloud  of  radioactive  particles  that  rose
high into the atmosphere. There were 237 conﬁrmed
cases of acute radiation sickness, and 31 people died
of radiation sickness.33 In the days following the ac-
cident,  about  3  billion  people  in  the  Northern
Hemisphere received varying amounts of radiation
from  Chernobyl.  With  the  exception  of  the  30  km
(19  mi)  zone  surrounding  Chernobyl,  the  human
exposure was relatively small. In Europe, where ex-
posure was highest, it was less than the amount of
natural radiation received over the course of 1 year.33
Approximately  115,000  people  in  that  30  km
(19 mi) zone were evacuated, and as many as 24,000
people  were  estimated  to  have  received  an  average
radiation dosage several hundred times higher than
a natural annual exposure. This group of people is
being studied carefully. Studies have found that the
annual  number  of  childhood  thyroid  cancer  cases
has risen steadily in the three countries of Belarus,
Ukraine, and the Russian Federation (those most af-
fected  by  Chernobyl)  since  the  accident.  In  1994,
there were 132 new thyroid cancer cases, and, since
the  accident,  a  total  of  653  thyroid  cancer  cases 
have  been  diagnosed  in  children  and  adolescents.
These  cancer  cases  are  thought  to  be  linked  to  the

accident, although other factors, including environ-
mental pollution, may also play a role. It is predicted
that a few percent of the 1 million children exposed
to  the  radiation  eventually  will  contract  thyroid
cancer.34 Outside  the  30  km  (19  mi)  zone,  the  in-
creased risk of contracting cancer is small. However,
one estimate is that, over the next 50 years, Cher-
nobyl will have been responsible for approximately
16,000 deaths worldwide.

In  the  area  surrounding  Chernobyl,  radioactive
materials continue to contaminate soils, vegetation,
surface water, and groundwater, presenting a hazard
to plants and animals. The evacuation zone may be
uninhabitable  for  a  very  long  time  unless  a  way  is
found  to  remove  the  radioactivity.33 Estimates  of
the total cost of the Chernobyl accident vary widely
but will probably exceed $200 billion.

The area around the accident may not be safe for
hundreds of years. The city of Prypyat, 5 km (3 mi)
from Chernobyl, is a “ghost city.” At the time of the
accident,  the  population  of  Prypyat  was  48,000.
Today, the town is abandoned, with blocks of vacant
apartment buildings and rusting vehicles. The roads
are  cracking,  and  trees  and  other  vegetation  are
transforming  the  once-urban  land  back  to  green
ﬁelds.  Prypyat  was  evacuated  within  2  days  of  the
accident. This was just 3 days before May Day, which
was the celebration of Soviet power. Today, cases of

Although the Soviets were accused of not paying
sufﬁcient  attention  to  reactor  safety  and  of  using
outdated  equipment,  people  are  still  wondering  if
such an accident could happen again elsewhere. Be-
cause there are several hundred reactors producing
power  in  the  world  today,  the  answer  is  yes.  The
Chernobyl accident follows a history of about 10 ac-
cidents  that  released  radioactive  particles  between
1967  and  2001.  Therefore,  although  Chernobyl  is
the  most  serious  nuclear  accident  to  date,  it  cer-
tainly  was  not  the  ﬁrst  and  is  not  likely  to  be  the
last.  As  a  result  of  the  Chernobyl  accident,  risk
analysis  in  nuclear  power  is  now  a  real-life  experi-
ence rather than a computer simulation.

Chernobyl was ﬁnally shut down on December 15,
2000, when reactor no. 3 was switched off, 14 years
after the accident in reactor no. 4. Reactor no. 2 was
closed in 1991 after a ﬁre, and no. 1 was shut down
in 1996. The closure occurred as a result of interna-
tional  pressure,  with  the  West  agreeing  to  pay  for
cleanup  work  and  to  construct  two  new  nuclear
power plants at other sites in the Ukraine.

thyroid cancer are still increasing. The ﬁnal impact
of the world’s most serious nuclear accident has yet
to completely unfold.35 So far, the number of deaths
has been less than expected, but the contamination
is more widespread than expected.

The Future of Energy from Fission
Nuclear  power  produces  about  20  percent  of  the
electricity  in  the  United  States  today.  About  104
reactors  are  now  in  operation,  more  than  80  per-
cent of which are in the eastern United States. The
states  with  the  largest  percentage  of  electricity
produced  from  nuclear  power  plants  are  Vermont
(74  percent),  South  Carolina  (57  percent),  New
Jersey  (51  percent), and Connecticut (49 percent).
Many more reactors are needed to realize uranium’s
potential energy contribution.36

The United States has recently suggested, as na-
tional policy, that nuclear power should be expanded
in the future. Evidently, more Americans agree with
this  suggestion  than  in  previous  years;  however,
there remains signiﬁcant opposition to the idea.36,37
Nuclear  ﬁssion  may,  indeed,  be  one  of  the  an-
swers to our energy problems. Its use is being seri-
ously evaluated for future increase because it is an
alternative to fossil fuels that does not release car-
bon dioxide into the atmosphere (and, thus, it does
not  contribute  to  global  warming)  and  it  does  not
release  pollutants  that  cause  acid  rain.  However,
with the use of nuclear power comes the responsibil-
ity  of  ensuring  that  it  will  be  used  for  people,  not
against  them,  and  that  future  generations  will  in-
herit a quality environment, free from worry about
hazardous nuclear waste.38

Radioactive Waste Management
Radioactive  waste  management,  the  safe  disposal  of
radioactive  waste,  is  a  signiﬁcant  environmental
issue  facing  the  United  States  and  the  rest  of  the
world. Radioactive wastes are by-products that must
be  expected  when  electricity  is  produced  from  nu-
clear reactors or weapons are produced from pluto-
nium. Radioactive waste may be grouped into three
general  categories: 
low-level  waste,  transuranic
waste, and high-level waste.

Low-Level Radioactive Wastes. Low-level radioac-
tive wastes contain only small amounts of radioactive
substances. Low-level wastes include a wide variety of

568

CHAPTER 16

Energy Resources

items,  such  as  residues  or  solutions  from  chemical
processing;  solid  or  liquid  plant  waste,  sludges,  and
acids;  and  slightly  contaminated  equipment,  tools,
plastic, glass, wood, fabric, and other materials.39 Be-
fore  disposal,  liquid  low-level  radioactive  waste  is
solidiﬁed  or  packaged  with  material  capable  of  ab-
sorbing at least twice the volume of liquid present.40
Radioactive  decay  of  low-level  waste  does  not
generate a great deal of heat, and a general rule is
that the material must be isolated from the environ-
ment for about 500 years to ensure that the level of
radioactivity  does  not  produce  a  hazard.  In  the
United  States,  the  philosophy  for  management  of
low-level waste has been “dilute and disperse.” Expe-
rience suggests that low-level radioactive waste can
be buried safely in carefully controlled and monitored
near-surface burial areas in which the hydrologic and
geologic  conditions  severely  limit  the  migration  of
radioactivity.37 Such waste has been buried at several
sites  in  states  including  Washington,  Nevada,  New
Mexico, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky,
South Carolina, and New York.

Despite precautions, several of the burial sites for
low-level radioactive waste, including those in Ten-
nessee and Washington, have not provided adequate
protection of the environment. This failure has been
due, at least in part, to a poor understanding of the
local hydrologic and geologic environment. For ex-
ample,  a  study  of  the  Oak  Ridge  National  Labora-
tory in Tennessee suggests that, in places, the water
table is less than 7 m (23 ft) below the ground sur-
face.  The  investigation  identiﬁed  migration  of  ra-
dioactive materials from one of the burial sites and
concluded  that  containment  of  the  waste  in  that
area is difﬁcult because of the short residence time
of water in the vadose zone. In other words, liquid
radioactive materials released from the disposal sites
do  not  take  long  to  inﬁltrate  the  vadose  zone  and
percolate down to the groundwater.40 However, near
Beatty,  Nevada,  the  depth  to  the  water  table  is  ap-
proximately  100  m  (300  ft).  The  low-level  radioac-
tive waste-disposal facility there has apparently been
successful  in  its  containment  of  radioactive  waste.
Its success is based partly on the long length of time
needed  for  any  pollutants  generated  to  enter  the
groundwater environment.40

Transuranic Waste. Transuranic waste is nuclear
waste  composed  of  human-made  radioactive  ele-
ments  heavier  than  uranium.  Most  transuranic

waste  is  industrial  trash,  such  as  clothing,  rags,
tools, and equipment that has been contaminated.
Although the waste is low level in terms of inten-
sity of radioactivity, plutonium has a long half-life
(i.e., the time required for the radioactivity to be
reduced to one-half its original level) and requires
isolation from the environment for about 250,000
years. Most transuranic waste is from the produc-
tion  of  nuclear  weapons  and  from  cleanup  of
former  nuclear  weapons  facilities.  As  of  1999,
these wastes were being transported to a disposal
site near Carlsbad, New Mexico. The waste is iso-
lated  at  a  depth  of  655  m  (2,150  ft)  in  saltbeds
that  are  several  hundred  meters  thick  (Figure
16.26). Rock salt at the New Mexico site has sev-
eral advantages:41,42

• The salt is about 225 million years old, and the
area  is  geologically  stable,  with  very  little
earthquake activity.

• The  salt  is  easy  to  mine  and  has  no  ﬂowing
groundwater. Rooms excavated in the salt that
are  about  10  m  (33  ft)  wide  and  4  m  (13  ft)
high are used for disposal.

• The  rock  salt  ﬂows  slowly  into  mined  open-
ings.  As  a  result,  the  slow-ﬂowing  salt  will
naturally  close  the  waste-ﬁlled  spaces  in  the
storage  facility  in  100  to  200  years,  sealing
the waste.

The  New  Mexico  disposal  site  is  important  be-
cause it is the ﬁrst geologic disposal site for nuclear
waste in the United States. It is a pilot project that
is being evaluated very carefully. Safety is the main
concern.  Procedures  to  transport  the  waste,  as
safely as possible, to the disposal site and place it
underground in the disposal facility have been es-
tablished.  The  waste  will  be  hazardous  for  many
thousands of years; therefore, there are uncertain-
ties  concerning  future  languages  and  cultures  at
the  site.  Clear  warnings  above  and  below  ground
have been created, and the site is clearly marked to
help ensure that human intrusion will not occur in
the future.40

High-Level  Radioactive  Wastes. High-level  ra-
dioactive wastes are produced as fuel assemblages in
nuclear  reactors  become  contaminated  or  clogged
with large quantities of ﬁssion products. This spent
fuel must periodically be removed and reprocessed
or disposed of. Fuel assemblies will probably not be

The  Scope  of the  High-Level  Disposal  Problem.
Hazardous  radioactive  materials  produced  from
nuclear  reactors  include  ﬁssion  products,  such  as

570

CHAPTER 16

Energy Resources

krypton-85, strontium-90, and cesium-137. Each of
these radioactive elements has a different half-life.
One of the biggest challenges faced in managing ra-
dioactive waste disposal is the various half-lives as-
sociated with ﬁssion products. In general, at least 10
half-lives, and preferably more, are required before a
material  is  no  longer  considered  a  health  hazard.
Therefore,  a  mixture  of  the  ﬁssion  products  men-
tioned  above  would  require  hundreds  of  years  of
conﬁnement from the biosphere. Reactors also pro-
duce a small amount of plutonium-239 (with a half-
life  of  24,000  years),  which  is  a  human-produced
isotope that does not occur naturally. Because plu-
tonium  and  its  ﬁssion  products  must  be  isolated
from the biological environment for a quarter of a
million years or more, their permanent disposal is a
geologic problem.

Disposal of High-Level Waste in the Geologic Envi-
ronment. There  is  fair  agreement  that  the  geologic
environment can provide the most certain safe con-
tainment of high-level radioactive waste. The Nuclear
Waste Policy Act of 1982 initiated a comprehensive
federal  and  state  program  for  the  disposal of  high-
level nuclear waste. The Department of Energy was
responsible  for  investigating  several  potential
sites, and the act originally called for the president
to recommend a site by 1987. In December 1987,
Congress amended the act to specify that only the
Yucca Mountain site in southern Nevada would be
evaluated to determine whether high-level radioac-
tive waste could be disposed of there. Some scien-
tists  and  others  believe  that  the  site  was  chosen
not so much for its geology, although the rock type
at the site does have several favorable qualities for
disposal, but because it is an existing nuclear reser-
vation  and,  therefore,  might  draw  minimal  social
and  political  opposition.43 However,  opposition
has  been  intense  and,  apparently,  successful.  It
now  appears  that,  after  billions  of  dollars  have
been  spent,  Yucca  Mountain  is  not  to  be  the  site
where nuclear waste will be soon, if ever, disposed
of. Nevertheless, the geology of the site is worthy
of discussion.

The rock at the Yucca Mountain site is densely
compacted  tuff,  a  rock  composed  of  compacted
volcanic  ash.  Precipitation  is  about  15  cm  (6  in.)
per year, and most of this runs off or evaporates.
The depth to a potential repository is about 300 m
(984 ft) below the mountain’s surface, and such a

repository  could  be  constructed  well  above  the
water table. The Department of Energy and the U.S.
Geological Survey have completed an extensive sci-
entiﬁc  evaluation  of  the  Yucca  Mountain  site.  The
study  has  helped  determine  how  well  the  geologic
and hydrologic setting can isolate high-level nuclear
waste from the environment.44

Long-Term  Safety. A  major  problem  with  the  dis-
posal of high-level radioactive waste remains: How
credible  are  long-range  geologic  predictions—that
is,  predictions  of  conditions  thousands  to  millions
of years in the future?45 There is no easy answer to
this  question  because  geologic  processes  vary  over
both time and space. Climates change over long pe-
riods of time, as do areas of erosion, deposition, and
groundwater  activity.  For  example,  large  earth-
quakes,  occurring  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of
kilometers  from  a  site,  may  permanently  change
groundwater  levels.  The  known  seismic  record  for
the western United States dates back only 100 years;
estimates of future earthquake activity are tenuous
at best. Ultimately, geologists can evaluate the rela-
tive  stability  of  the  geologic  past,  but  they  cannot
guarantee future stability. Therefore, decision mak-
ers, and not geologists, need to evaluate the uncer-
tainty  of  prediction  in  light  of  pressing  political,
economic, and social concerns.45 These problems do
not mean that the geologic environment is not suit-
able  for  safe  containment  of  high-level  radioactive
waste, but care must be taken to ensure that the best
possible decisions are made on this critical and con-
troversial issue.

Energy from Fusion
In  contrast  to  nuclear  ﬁssion,  nuclear  fusion com-
bines  the  nuclei  of  lighter  elements  to  produce
heavier ones. The process of nuclear fusion releases
energy and is the source of energy in our Sun and
other stars. Harnessing nuclear fusion is a research
objective that has met with some success, but it is
not  yet  certain  whether  commercial  fusion  power
plants  can  be  constructed  that  are  economically
competitive with other energy sources. From an en-
vironmental view, fusion appears attractive because
little radioactive waste is produced and mining and
transportation  impacts  are  small,  compared  with
those for fossil fuels and nuclear ﬁssion. The fuel for
fusion  is  hydrogen,  the  supply  of  which  is  nearly

unlimited and, as a result, fusion has the potential
of being a nearly unlimited source of energy for the
future. However, we do not yet have the technology
to harness the hydrogen for our energy needs.8

16.8 Geothermal Energy
The use of geothermal energy—natural heat from
Earth’s  interior—is  an  exciting  application  of  geo-
logic  knowledge  and  engineering  technology.  The
idea of harnessing Earth’s internal heat is not new:
Geothermal power was developed in Italy, using dry
steam, in 1904 and is now used to generate electric-
ity at numerous sites around the world, including a
few  in  the  western  United  States  and  Hawaii.  At
many other sites, geothermal energy that is not hot
enough to produce electrical power is used to heat
buildings  or  for  industrial  purposes.  Existing  geo-
thermal  facilities  use  only  a  small  portion  of  the
total energy that might eventually be tapped from
Earth’s reservoir of internal heat; the geothermal re-
source  is  vast.  If  only  1  percent  of  the  geothermal
energy in the upper 10 km (6.2 mi) of Earth’s crust
could be captured, it would amount to 500 times the
total global oil and natural gas resource.46

Geology of Geothermal Energy
Natural heat production within Earth is only par-
tially understood. We know that some areas have a
higher  flow  of  heat  from  below  than  others  and
that, for the most part, these locations are associ-
ated  with  tectonic  processes.  Divergent  and  con-
vergent  plate  boundaries  are  areas  where  this
natural heat flow from Earth is anomalously high.
The  coincidence  of  geothermal  power  plant  loca-
tions  and  areas  of  known  active  volcanism  is  no
accident.

Temperature increases with depth below Earth’s
surface; it is measured in degrees per kilometer and
is  referred  to  as  the  geothermal  gradient.  In  the
United States, the geothermal gradient varies from
about  12°C  to  47°C  (53°F  to  116°F)  per  kilometer
(0.6 mi) (Figure 16.27). In general, the steeper the
gradient, the greater the heat ﬂow to the surface. A
steep geothermal gradient indicates that hot rock is
closer to the surface than usual. A moderate gradi-
ent of 30°C to 45°C (86°F to 113°F) per kilometer is
found over vast areas in the western U.S. Basin and
Range,  especially  in  the  Battle  Mountain  region

(Figure 16.27a). This area, with some exceptions,
is  clearly  a  good  prospect  for  geothermal  explo-
ration.  Figure  16.27b shows  heat  flow  for  the
western United States, along with locations of ex-
isting geothermal power plants. Total power pro-
duction is about 3,000 MW, more than 90 percent
of  which  is  in  California.  About  one-third  of  total
production is in the Geysers facility, 145 km (90 mi)
north of San Francisco, California, where electrical
energy  has  been  produced  from  steam  for  many
years  (G  on  Figure  16.27,  and  see  Figure  16.28,
page 573). A typical commercial geothermal well will
produce between 5 and 8 MW of electrical power.46
(Remember: 1 watt ⫽ 1 joule per second. See A Closer
Look: Energy Units.)

Several  geothermal  systems  may  be  deﬁned  on
the basis of geologic criteria. Each system has a dif-
ferent  origin  and  different  potential  as  an  energy
source.

Hydrothermal Convection Systems. Hydrother-
mal convection systems are characterized by a geo-
thermal  basin  in  which  a  variable  amount  of  hot
water circulates. There are two basic types: vapor-
dominated systems and hot-water systems. Vapor-
dominated  hydrothermal  convection  systems  are
geothermal  reservoirs  in  which  both  water  and
steam  are  present  (Figure  16.29,  page  573).  Near
the surface, the pressure is lower than at deeper lev-
els,  and  water  changes  quickly  to  superheated
steam,  which  can  be  tapped  and  piped  directly  into
turbines to produce electricity. These systems charac-
teristically  have  a  slow  recharge  of  groundwater,
meaning that the hot rocks boil off more water than
can be replaced in the same amount of time by natural
recharge  or  by  injection  of  water  from  a  condenser
after  power  generation.  Vapor-dominated  systems
are not very common. Only three have been identi-
ﬁed  in  the  United  States:  the  Geysers,  California;
Mt. Lassen National Park, California; and Yellowstone
National Park, Wyoming.46

In  the  United  States,  hot-water  hydrothermal
convection systems are about 20 times more com-
mon  than  vapor-dominated  systems.  Hot-water
systems,  with  temperatures  greater  than  150°C
(300°F),  have  a  zone  of  circulating  hot  water  that,
when tapped, moves up to a zone of reduced pres-
sure, yielding a mixture of steam and water at the
surface. The water must be removed from the steam
before the steam can be used to drive the turbine.46

Hot water from geothermal sources has a number
of  potential  direct  uses.  For  example,  Iceland  uses
hot water for space heating and industrial processes.
Abundant near-surface, hot geothermal water in the

southern Cascade Ranges occurs near Klamath Falls,
Oregon.  The  water  is  used  to  heat  homes,  govern-
ment and commercial buildings, dairies, ﬁsh farms,
and greenhouses. Geothermal heat from 60° to 80°C
water is used in southwestern France (Paris region)
to heat about 200,000 apartments, as well as to heat
water for domestic uses.46

Groundwater Systems. The idea of using ground-
water at normal shallow underground temperatures
is a relatively new one. At a depth of about 100 m

(328 ft), groundwater typically has a temperature of
about 13°C (55°F). This is cold, if you want to use it
for a bath, but it is warm compared with winter air
temperature in the eastern United States. Compared
with summer temperatures, it is cool. Heat pumps,
devices  that  can  raise  or  lower  the  temperature  of
air or water, can use these temperature differences
to heat buildings in the winter and cool them in the
summer by transferring heat between groundwater
and the air in a building. Although initially expen-
sive  because  of  well  drilling,  geothermal  systems
using constant-temperature groundwater are in ser-
vice in numerous midwestern and eastern U.S. loca-
tions.  The  technology  for  these  systems  is  well
known, and the equipment is easily obtained. As en-
ergy costs increase, such systems are becoming even
more attractive.

Environmental Impact 
of Geothermal Energy Development
The  adverse  environmental  impact  of  intensive
geothermal  energy  development  is  much  less  se-
vere  than  that  of  other  energy  sources,  but  it  is
nonetheless  considerable.  Environmental  prob-
lems  associated  with  geothermal  energy  include
on-site noise, gas emissions, and scars on the land.
Fortunately,  development  of  geothermal  energy
does  not  require  the  extensive  transportation  of

raw materials or reﬁning that is typical of the de-
velopment  of  fossil  fuels.  Geothermal  plants  gen-
erate less than 1 percent of the nitrogen oxides and
only  5  percent  of  the  carbon  dioxide  created  by
coal-burning  power  plants  producing  comparable
amounts  of  power.46 Finally,  geothermal  energy
does not produce the atmospheric particulate pol-
lutants  associated  with  burning  fossil  fuels  or
radioactive waste.

Geothermal energy production does have associ-
ated hazards. With the exception of vapor-dominated
systems, geothermal development produces consid-
erable thermal pollution from hot wastewaters. The
wastewaters  can  be  saline,  mineralized,  or  highly
corrosive  to  pipes,  pumps,  and  other  equipment.
The plan is to dispose of these waters by reinjecting
them  into  the  geothermal  reservoir.  Finally,  geot-
hermal  energy  development  may  adversely  affect
nearby geyser activity by reducing or changing the
heat source driving the geysers. As a result, federal
legislation has been passed to protect the geysers,
including  the  famous  geyser  Old  Faithful  and  hot
springs  of  Yellowstone  National  Park,  by  prohibit-
ing  geothermal  development  in  national  parks.
What  is  not  known  is  what  constitutes  adequate
protection. How large a buffer zone is necessary to
ensure  that  geothermal  development  outside  the
park boundary does not damage Yellowstone’s gey-
sers and hot springs?

Future of Geothermal Energy
Geothermal  energy  is  a  viable  site-speciﬁc  energy
source. The estimated yield from a small portion of
this vast resource could far exceed that of hundreds
of  modern  nuclear  power  plants.  The  cost  to  pro-
duce electricity from many geothermal ﬁelds is com-
parable to the costs of other sources, such as wind
and natural gas.

At  present,  geothermal  energy  supplies  only  a
small  fraction  of  1  percent  of  the  electrical  energy
produced  in  the  United  States.  The  total  output
from geothermal sources is not likely to exceed a few
percent—10  percent  at  most—of  electrical  output
in  the  near  future.  This  outlook  is  true  even  for
California, where geothermal energy has been pro-
duced  and  where  expanding  facilities  are  likely.  At
present,  geothermal  energy  supplies  about  6  per-
cent  of  California’s  electricity.  Nevertheless,  the
growth in power produced from geothermal sources
has increased dramatically in the past few decades,
and this trend will continue.46

16.9 Renewable Energy Sources
Fossil fuels are the main energy sources used today;
they supply approximately 90 percent of the global
energy  consumed  by  people.  All  other  sources  are
designated  alternative  energy and  are  subdivided
into two groups: renewable energy and nonrenewable
energy. Nonrenewable alternative energy sources in-
clude nuclear energy and geothermal energy, which
were  discussed  previously.  The  renewable  sources
are  solar  power,  water  or  hydropower,  hydrogen,
wind power, and energy derived from biomass.

level.  Alternative 

Use of alternative sources, particularly solar and
wind power, is growing at tremendous rates. Alter-
native energy sources have proven to be competitive
with coal burning, but they do not pollute our urban
air, cause acid rain, or warm our climate to an unac-
ceptable 
renewable  energy
sources, such as solar and wind power, do not cause
rapid or other climate change. Solar and wind power
do  not  alter  weather  to  produce  killer  storms  or
droughts;  nor  do  they  raise  sea  levels  around  the
world,  increasing  coastal  erosion  and  threatening
low-lying  areas,  including  islands.  Alternative,  re-
newable  energy  sources  offer  our  best  chance  to
break our addiction to fossil fuels and develop a sus-
tainable energy policy that will not harm Earth.47,48

Renewable Energy Sources

575

A primary directive to ensure the success of alter-
native energy is to match renewable energy sources
to sites where the natural resources for that source
are of the highest quality. For instance, site solar en-
ergy power plants in the southwestern United States,
where sunlight is most intense; site wind farms in
the Great Plains, Texas, the Northeast, and California,
where the strength of wind is strong and steady; and
use biomass at existing coal-burning power plants in
locations where forest and agriculture fuel resources
are abundant.49

Renewable energy sources are usually discussed as
a group because they are derivatives of the Sun’s en-
ergy.  That  is,  solar  energy,  broadly  deﬁned,  com-
prises  many  of  the  renewable  energy  sources,  as
shown in Figure 16.31. They are renewable because
they are regenerated by the Sun within a time period
that  is  useful  to  people.  Renewable  energy  sources
have  the  advantage  of  being  inexhaustible  and  are
often associated with minimal environmental degra-
dation. With the exception of burning biomass or its
derivative, urban waste, solar energy does not entail
fuel burning and, therefore, does not pose a threat of
increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and modify-
ing the climate. Another important aspect of renew-
able sources is that the lead time necessary to imple-
ment  the  technology  is  often  short,  relative  to  the
development of new sources or the construction of
power plants that utilize fossil or nuclear fuels.

The total amount of solar energy reaching Earth’s
surface is huge. On a global scale, 10 weeks of solar
energy is roughly equivalent to the energy stored in
all  known  reserves  of  coal,  oil,  and  natural  gas  on
Earth.  The  average  global  recoverable  solar  power
resource is about 80 times the power now used by
people on Earth.

Solar Energy
Solar  energy  is  used  directly  through  passive  solar
systems or active solar systems. Passive solar energy
systems involve architectural design that enhances
absorption  of  solar  energy  and  takes  advantage  of
the  natural  changes  in  solar  energy  that  occur
throughout  the  year  without  requiring  mechanical
power. A simple technique is to design overhangs on
buildings that block high-angle summer sunlight but
allow  low-angle  winter  sunlight  to  penetrate  and
warm rooms. Another method is to build a wall that
absorbs solar energy and emits it into a room, thus

576

CHAPTER 16

warming  it.  Numerous  homes
and  other  buildings  in  the
southwestern  United  States,
as  well  as  other  parts  of  the
country, now use passive solar
systems for at least part of their
energy needs.49 Active solar en-
ergy systems require mechanical
power, usually pumps and other
apparatuses,  to  circulate  air,
water, or other ﬂuids from solar
collectors  to  a  heat  sink,  where
the heat is stored until used.

Solar Collectors. Solar collec-
tors are usually ﬂat panels, con-
sisting  of  a  glass  plate  over  a
black background where water is
circulated  through  tubes.  Solar
radiation enters the glass and is
absorbed  by  the  black  back-
ground, heating the water in the
circulating tubes to 38° to 93°C
(100°  to  200°F).50 The  number
of systems using these collectors
in  the  United  States  continues
to grow.

FIGURE 16.31 Types of renewable solar energy Selected examples, with growth
and potential.

Photovoltaics. The 
technol-
ogy  that  converts  sunlight  di-
rectly  into  electricity,  using  a
solid semiconductor material, is
known as photovoltaics. Photovoltaics, at a growth rate
of  35  percent  per  year,  is  the  most  rapidly  growing
source of energy in the world today. The systems use
photovoltaic,  or  solar,  cells  made  of  silicon  or  other
materials and solid-state electronic components with
few or no moving parts. The cells are constructed in
standardized modules, which can be combined to pro-
duce systems of various sizes. As a result, power out-
put can be matched to the intended use. Electricity is
produced  when  sunlight  strikes  a  cell,  causing  elec-
trons to ﬂow out of the cell through electrical wires.

Photovoltaics are emerging as a signiﬁcant energy
source  in  developing  countries  that,  with  relatively
poor economies, do not have the ﬁnancial ability to
build large central power plants that burn fossil fuels.
We now recognize that solar technology is simple and
relatively  inexpensive;  it  is  also  capable  of  meeting
energy  uses  for  people  in  most  places  in  the  world.
One solar company in the United States is equipping

villages  in  several  countries  with  photovoltaic  sys-
tems that power lights and televisions at an installed
cost of a few hundred dollars per household.51 Solar
rooﬁng tiles allow the roof of a building to become its
own power plant.52 Panels of solar cells can also be
placed on a building’s roof, walls, or window glass.49
Although  there  are  speciﬁc  instances  in  which
the  cost  of  using  photovoltaics  is  comparable  to
that  of  using  grid-connected  power,  photovoltaics
are still considerably more expensive than conven-
tional  energy  sources.  However,  the  gap  is  slowly
narrowing.47,53,54

Solar Energy and the Environment. The use of
solar energy has a relatively low impact on the en-
vironment.  The  major  disadvantage  is  that  solar
energy  is  relatively  dispersed;  a  large  land  area  is
required to generate a large amount of energy. This
problem  is  negligible  when  solar  collectors  can  be

combined with existing structures, as, for example,
the addition of solar water heaters on roofs of exist-
ing  buildings.  The  impact  of  solar  energy  systems
can be minimized by locating centralized systems in
areas  not  used  for  other  purposes  and  by  making
use of dispersed solar energy collectors on existing
structures wherever possible.

Hydrogen
Hydrogen  is  the  fuel  burned  by  our  Sun.  It  is  the
lightest,  most  abundant  element  in  the  universe.
Hydrogen gas may be the fuel of the future and the
key to clean energy. Hydrogen is a high-quality fuel
that can be easily used in any of the ways in which
we normally use fossil fuels, such as to power auto-
mobile and truck engines or to heat water or build-
ings.  When  used  in  fuel  cells,  similar  to  batteries,
hydrogen  can  produce  electricity.  Hydrogen,  like
natural  gas,  can  be  transported  in  pipelines  and
stored in tanks, and it can be produced by using solar
and  other  renewable  energy  sources  to  split  water
into oxygen and hydrogen. Hydrogen is a clean fuel;
the  combustion  product  of  burning  hydrogen  is
water, so it does not contribute to global warming,
air pollution, or acid rain. It is expected that experi-
mentation with hydrogen will continue and that the
fuel produced may be substantially reduced in price
in the future. Hawaii, which imports oil for 88 per-
cent of its energy needs, has abundant geothermal,
solar, and wind sources that could be used to produce
hydrogen.  Hawaii  eventually  hopes  to  be  a  net  ex-
porter of energy in the form of hydrogen. Iceland, at
the end of the twentieth century, announced that it
intends to be the ﬁrst hydrogen society, planning to
export hydrogen to Europe by 2050.55–57

Water Power
Water  power is  an  ancient  source  of  energy.  Water
has been successfully used as a source of power at least
since  the  time  of  the  Roman  Empire.  Waterwheels
were  turning in Western Europe in the  seventeenth
century, harnessing the energy of moving water and
converting it to mechanical energy. During the eigh-
teenth and nineteenth centuries, large waterwheels
provided the energy to power grain mills, sawmills,
and other machinery in the United States.

Hydroelectric Power. Today, hydroelectric power
plants provide about 10 percent of the total electric-
ity  produced  in  the  United  States.  Although  the

Renewable Energy Sources

577

total  amount  of  electrical  power  produced  by  run-
ning  water  will  increase  somewhat  in  the  coming
years, the percentage may be reduced as the produc-
tion of other energy sources, such as nuclear, wind,
solar, and geothermal, increase more quickly.

Most of the acceptable sites for large dams to pro-
duce  hydropower  are  already  being  utilized.  How-
ever, small-scale hydropower systems may be more
common in the future. These are systems designed
for  individual  homes,  farms,  or  small  industries.
They will typically have power outputs of less than
100  kW  and  are  termed  microhydropower systems
(Figure  16.32).58 Microhydropower  is  one  of  the
world’s  oldest  and  most  common  energy  sources.
Numerous sites in many areas have potential for pro-
ducing  small-scale  electrical  power;  mountainous
areas  are  particularly  promising  because  potential
energy from stream water is readily available. Micro-
hydropower development is, by its nature, very site
speciﬁc,  depending  on  local  regulations,  the  area’s
economic situation, and hydrologic limitations.

Innovative new ways to develop water power are
the  subject  of  ongoing  research  and  development.
For example, the energy of ocean waves striking the
shore  can  be  used  to  compress  air  that  is  forced
through  a  turbine  producing  electricity.  Another
plan is to use the energy of a slow-moving river to
produce electricity. The idea is to place vertical ob-
structions to ﬂow on the river bed that create per-
turbations of ﬂow that vibrate to produce energy.

Hydropower can be used to generate either elec-
trical power or mechanical power to run machinery.
Hydroelectric  plants  may  help  cut  the  high  cost  of
importing energy and help small operations become
more independent of local utility providers.58

Tidal Power. Another form of water power might
be derived from ocean tides in a few places where
there  is  favorable  topography,  such  as  the  Bay  of
Fundy  region  of  the  northeastern  United  States
and Canada. The tides in the Bay of Fundy have a
maximum  rise  of  about  15  m  (50  ft).  A  minimum
rise of about 8 m (26 ft) is necessary to even con-
sider developing tidal power.

Tidal power is harnessed by building a dam across
the entrance to a bay, creating a basin on the land-
ward side of the dam. The dam creates a difference in
water level between the ocean and the basin. Then,
as the water in the basin rises or falls, it can be used
to turn hydraulic turbines that produce electricity. A
tidal  power  station  on  the  River  Rance  near  Saint

Malo,  France,  produces  more  than  200,000  kW  of
electricity from 24 power units across the dam.

Water Power and Environment. Water power is
clean  power.  It  requires  no  fuel  burning,  does  not
pollute the atmosphere, produces no radioactive or
other  waste,  and  is  efﬁcient.  There  is  an  environ-
mental  price  to  pay,  however.  Water  falling  over
high dams may trap nitrogen gas, which is the major
gas in air. The nitrogen then enters the blood of ﬁsh,
expands,  and  kills  them.  This  process  is  analogous
to what happens to scuba divers when they rise to
the  surface  too  fast  and  get  “the  bends.”  Nitrogen
has  killed  many  migrating  game  ﬁsh  in  the  Paciﬁc
Northwest. Furthermore, dams trap sediment that
would  otherwise  reach  the  sea  and  replenish  the
sand on beaches. Building dams to harness water’s
power  can  also  cause  the  displacement  of  people,
loss of land to the reservoir, loss of wildlife, and ad-
verse  changes  to  the  river  ecology  and  hydrology
downstream. In addition, many people do not want
to turn wild rivers into a series of lakes by building
intermittent dams. In fact, in the United States, sev-
eral dams have been removed, and others are being
considered for removal as a result of the adverse en-
vironmental impacts their presence is causing.

Despite  the  inherent  problems  associated  with
dams, the world’s largest dam has been constructed

in China. The Three Gorges Dam (completed in 2006)
on the Yangtze River displaced more than a million
people from their homes, drowning 13 cities, 1300
villages,  farm  ﬁelds,  archeology  sites,  and  highly
scenic  river  gorges  (Figure  16.33).  The  dam  con-
tributed to the extinction of the Yangtze river dol-
phin. The habitat for many other plants and animals
was  fragmented,  as  mountain  tops  became  islands
in the giant reservoir, resulting in loss of species di-
versity.  The  dam  is  about  185  m  (607  ft)  high  and
more  than  1.6  km  (1  mi)  wide,  and,  when  ﬁlled  in
October 2010 (it took several years to ﬁll) produced a
reservoir nearly 600 km (373 mi) long. There is con-
cern that the reservoir will become polluted by raw
sewage and industrial pollutants currently disposed
of in the river, turning the long narrow reservoir into
an  open  sewer.  It  might  also  degrade  or  eliminate
deep-water shipping harbors at the upstream end of
the  reservoir,  where  sediments  will  most  likely  be
deposited. On a more positive note, 26 giant turbines
will  produce  about  18,000  MW  of  electricity,  the
equivalent of 18 large nuclear or coal-burning power
plants.  However,  opponents  of  the  dam  point  out
that  a  series  of  dams  on  tributaries  to  the  Yangtze
could have produced electrical power while not caus-
ing environmental damage to the main river.59

While the future growth of large-scale water power
is limited because of objections to dam building and

the fact that many good sites for dams are already uti-
lized, there seems to be increased interest in microhy-
dropower, or small dams for supplying electricity or
mechanical energy. However, the environmental im-
pact  of  numerous  microhydropower  installations  in
an  area  may  be  considerable.  The  sites  change  the
natural  stream  ﬂow,  affecting  the  stream  biota  and
productivity. Small dams and reservoirs also tend to
ﬁll more quickly with sediment than larger installa-
tions, so their useful life is shorter.

Because  microhydropower  development  can  ad-
versely affect the stream environment, careful con-
sideration must be given to its development over a
wide region. A few such sites may cause little envi-
ronmental degradation, but, if the number becomes
excessive, the impact over a wider region may be ap-
preciable.  This  is  a  consideration  that  must  be  ap-
plied to many forms of technology that involve small
sites. The impact of a single site on a broad region
may be nearly negligible, but as the number of sites
increases, the total impact may become signiﬁcant.

Wind Power
Wind  power,  like  solar  power,  has  evolved  over  a
long  period  of  time,  beginning  with  early  Chinese
and Persian civilizations. Wind has propelled ships
and  has  driven  windmills  to  grind  grain  or  pump
water. More recently, wind has been used to gener-
ate  electricity.  Winds  are  produced  when  differen-
tial  heating  of  Earth’s  surface  creates  air  masses
with differing heat contents and densities. The po-
tential  for  energy  from  the  wind  is  tremendous;
however,  there  are  problems  with  its  use  because
wind tends to be highly variable in time, place, and
intensity.  Nevertheless,  wind  power  is  one  of  the
fastest-growing,  most  promising,  and  technologi-
cally  advanced  sources  of  alternative  energy,  dou-
bling every few years.47

Wind  prospecting  has  become  an  important  en-
deavor. On a national scale, the areas with the greatest
potential  for  wind  energy  are  the  Paciﬁc  Northwest
coastal area, the coastal region of the northeastern
United States, and a belt extending from northern

580

CHAPTER 16

Texas through the Rocky Mountain States, the Dako-
tas, Indiana, and Illinois. There are other good sites,
however,  such  as  mountainous  areas  in  North
Carolina and the northern Coachella Valley in south-
ern California. Chicago is called the “Windy City.” Al-
though Chicago is not signiﬁcantly windier than Los
Angeles, Boston, or New York, the region has breezy
conditions that favors wind power. For example, in
northern  Indiana  about  halfway  from  Indianapolis
to  Chicago  a  successful  wind  farm  is  producing
enough electricity to power 60,000 homes.

At  a  particular  site,  the  direction,  velocity,  and
duration of wind may be quite variable, depending
on the local topography and on the regional to local
magnitude of temperature differences in the atmos-
phere. Even at good sites, wind generally produces
less than 30 percent of what it would if it were avail-
able all day, every day. Furthermore, it is often more
windy at night, when demand for electricity is low.47
For  example,  wind  velocity  often  increases  over
hilltops, or wind may be funneled through a moun-

tain  pass.  The  increase  in  wind  velocity  over  a
mountain  is  due  to  a  vertical  convergence  of  the
wind, whereas, in a pass, the increase is partly due
to a horizontal convergence (Figure 16.34a–c). Be-
cause  the  shape  of  a  mountain  or  a  pass  is  often
related to the local or regional geology, prospecting
for wind energy is a geologic as well as a geographic
and meteorological problem.

Signiﬁcant improvements in the size of wind tur-
bines and the amount of power they produce were
made  in  recent  years,  when  many  European  coun-
tries  and  the  United  States  became  interested  in
large-scale wind turbines. In the United States, thou-
sands  of  wind  turbines  are  located  on  wind  farms
(Figure 16.34d). Large state-of-the-art wind turbines
are much larger, each producing 3 to 5 MW, enough
power  for  several  thousand  homes.  Advantages  of
wind power are that wind is a widespread, abundant,
inexhaustible  resource;  wind  power  has  become  an
inexpensive source of energy (cost-competitive with
coal,  less  expensive  than  nuclear  power,  but  more

expensive than natural gas); and wind power is a clean
source of electricity that doesn’t cause air pollution
or  release  carbon  dioxide  that  changes  climate.  For
these  reasons,  wind  power  is  the  fastest-growing
energy  source  in  the  world.  However,  wind  power
does have some adverse effects:

• Wind  turbines  may  kill  birds,  especially  large
birds of prey, such as hawks and falcons, that ﬂy
into the blades while focused on prey. Newer tur-
bines are much safer for birds than older ones.
• Large  wind  turbines  farms  require  land  for
roads, wind turbines pads, and other equipment.
• Wind turbines may degrade an area’s scenic re-

sources.

• Tall wind turbines may interfere with air trafﬁc.
The growth of wind power in the past decade has
been  astounding—approximately  30  percent  per
year, compared with the 1 percent to 2 percent per
year growth of oil. Wind power in the United States
is doubling about every 2 years. It is believed that in
just three states—Texas, South Dakota, and North
Dakota—sufﬁcient wind energy resources exist to
satisfy the electricity needs of the entire country.
Some of the world’s largest wind farms are located
in  Washington  and  Oregon,  on  ridges  above  the
Columbia  River.  The  wind  farms  produce  up  to
2,700  MW  of  electricity  during  peak  wind  condi-
tions  for  power  generation,  equivalent  to  nearly
three large nuclear power plants. On average about
30 percent of peak energy is produced. Most of the
power is sent south to California.

China  burns  tremendous  amounts  of  coal  at  a
tragic environmental cost, including the exposure of
millions  of  people  in  cities  to  mixtures  of  deadly
gases and particulates. Similarly, rural China’s expo-
sure to the smoke from burning coal in homes has
increased the threat of lung cancer by a factor of 9 or
more. As China endures these environmental costs,
it is investing heavily in wind power52,60

Wind  power  is  being  taken  seriously.  Sufﬁcient
wind power is generated in the United States to sup-
ply  electricity  to  several  million  suburban  homes.
Wind  now  provides  about  2  percent  of  the  world’s
demand for electricity, and its growth rate suggests
that it will be a major power supplier in the relatively
near future. One scenario suggests that wind power
could supply 10 percent of the world’s electricity in
the  next  few  decades.  In  the  long  run,  wind  power
could provide more energy than hydropower.60

Renewable Energy Sources

581

A potential slowdown in the development of wind
energy is the recent drop in the price of natural gas.
If  gas  continues  to  be  abundant  and  cheap  in  the
next few decades, power plants may burn more gas
at the expense of renewable energy sources, such as
wind. Nevertheless, in the long run, wind energy will
remain a viable source of energy.

The United States in 2009 was the world leader in
production  of  wind  energy,  at  nearly  35,000  MW.
This is equivalent to about 35 large fossil fuel or nu-
clear power plants. China at 26,000 MW is second in
the  world  and  Germany  is  a  close  third.  China  is
planning massive expansion in wind power and may
surpass the United States in the near future.

Biofuels
Biofuel is a new name for the oldest fuel used by hu-
mans.  Our  Pleistocene  ancestors  burned  wood  to
keep warm and to cook food. Biofuel energy sources
are organic matter, such as plant material and ani-
mal  waste.  Biofuel  is  organic  matter  that  can  be
burned directly or converted to a more convenient
form  and  then  burned.  For  example,  we  can  burn
wood in a stove or convert it to charcoal and then
burn it. Biomass has provided a major source of en-
ergy for human beings throughout most of the his-
tory  of  civilization.  When  North  American  forests
were  cleared  for  agriculture,  a  technique  known  as
girdling was used. Girdling involved cutting through
the bark all the way around the base of a tree. After
girdling had killed the tree, the settlers would then
burn the forests to clear the land for farming.

Firewood  is  the  best-known  and  most  widely
used  biofuel,  but  there  are  many  types  of  biomass
fuel.  In  India  and  other  countries,  cattle  dung  is
burned  for  cooking.  Peat,  a  form  of  compressed
dead  vegetation,  provides  heating  and  cooking
fuel in northern countries such as Scotland, where
it is abundant.

More than 1 billion people in the world today use
wood as their primary source of energy for heat and
cooking. Energy from biomass can be generated di-
rectly by burning biomass to produce electricity or
by  the  distillation  or  processing  of  biomass  (i.e.,
corn, grasses, and algae) to produce biofuels, such as
ethanol, methanol, biodiesel, or methane.47,61

The primary sources of biofuels in North America
are forest products, agricultural products, and com-
bustible  urban  waste.  Manure  from  livestock  or

582

CHAPTER 16

other organic waste can be digested by microorgan-
isms to form methane and then burned to produce
electricity  or  be  used  in  fuel  cells.  Using  biogenic
methane from manure is highly preferable to allow-
ing  its  release  into  the  atmosphere,  where  it  con-
tributes to global warming.61

of about 67 percent. The use of a “unit of fuel” is arbi-
trary. It could, for example, be a barrel of oil or a ton
of  coal.  Cogeneration,  which  involves  recycling  of
that waste heat, can increase the efﬁciency of a typi-
cal power plant from 33 percent to as high as 75 per-
cent.  Put  another  way,  cogeneration  reduces  energy
loss from 67 percent to as little as 25 percent.

16.10 Conservation, Efﬁciency,

and Cogeneration

Earlier in this chapter, we established that we must
become accustomed to living with uncertainty con-
cerning the availability, cost, and environmental ef-
fects of energy use. Furthermore, we can expect that
serious  social,  economic,  and  political  shocks  will
continue to occur, disrupting the ﬂow of energy to
various parts of the world.

Supply and demand for energy are difﬁcult to pre-
dict  because  the  technical,  economic,  political,  and
social  assumptions  underlying  projections  are  con-
stantly changing. Large annual variations in energy
consumption must also be considered: Energy con-
sumption peaks during the winter, with a secondary
peak  occurring  in  the  summer.  Future  changes  in
population or intensive conservation measures may
change  this  pattern.  Better  building  design  and
more reliance on solar energy can also contribute to
changing the existing energy usage pattern.

There  has  been  a  strong  movement  to  change
patterns  of  energy  consumption  through  mea-
sures  such  as  conservation,  increased  efficiency,
and  cogeneration.  Conservation of  energy  refers
to a moderation of our energy demand. Pragmati-
cally,  this  means  adjusting  our  energy  uses  to 
minimize  the  expenditure  of  energy  necessary  to
accomplish a given task. Efficiency entails design-
ing  and  using  equipment  that  yields  more  power
from a given amount of energy, while wasting less
energy.62 Finally, cogeneration refers to a number
of  processes  that  capture  and  use  some  of  the
waste heat produced by power generation and in-
dustrial operations, rather than simply releasing it
into  the  atmosphere  or  into  water,  where  it  may
cause thermal pollution.63

The  three  concepts  conservation,  increased  efﬁ-
ciency, and cogeneration are interrelated. For example,
when  electricity  is  produced  at  large  coal-burning
power stations, sizable amounts of heat may be emit-
ted into the atmosphere. Typically, three units of fuel
burn to produce one unit of electricity, an energy loss

16.11 Energy Policy 
for the Future

Energy policy today is at a crossroads. One road leads
to  the  development  of  technologies,  which  involves
ﬁnding ever-greater amounts of fossil fuels and build-
ing  larger,  centralized  power  plants.  Following  this
road  means  continuing  “business  as  usual.”  This  is
the  more  comfortable  approach;  it  requires  no  new
thinking or realignment of political, economic, or so-
cial  conditions.  It  also  involves  little  anticipation  of
the inevitable depletion of the fossil fuel resources.

Proponents  of  the  business-as-usual  path  argue
that environmental problems have occurred in some
countries because people have had to utilize local re-
sources, such as wood, for energy, rather than, say,
for land conservation and erosion control. Business-
as-usual  supporters  believe  that  the  way  to  solve
these problems is to provide people with cheap en-
ergy  that  utilizes  more  intensive  industrialization
and technology. Furthermore, the United States and
other countries with sizable resources of coal or pe-
troleum  should  exploit  these  resources  to  prevent
environmental degradation of their own countries.
Proponents of this view maintain that allowing the
energy industry the freedom to develop available re-
sources ensures a steady supply of energy and less
total environmental damage than if the government
regulates  the  energy  industry.  They  point  to  the
present  increase  in  the  burning  of  ﬁrewood  across
the United States as an early indicator of the effects
of strong governmental controls on energy supplies.
The  eventual  depletion  of  forest  resources,  they
maintain, will have a detrimental effect on the envi-
ronment, as it has in so many other countries. The
business-as-usual  path  continues  to  dominate  en-
ergy  planning  in  the  United  States,  but  there  are
signs that energy policy is changing.

One of the champions for change in energy pol-
icy is Amory Lovins, who argues for energy alterna-
tives that are renewable, ﬂexible, decentralized, and
environmentally  benign.64 We  now  appear  to  be

moving slowly from the business-as-usual approach
to energy policy in the United States to strategies
that increase energy efﬁciency, increase alternative
energy  sources,  transition  from  oil  and  coal  to
other energy sources or greatly reduce the environ-
mental  consequences  of  burning  coal,  and  reduce
our  dependency  on  foreign  oil;  the  way  to  do  this
has  not  been  decided,  but  perhaps  it  will  involve
using  more  natural  gas  and  nuclear  power  and
other alternative energy sources.

In the United States today, we annually consume
approximately 100 EJ of energy. Projections suggest
that U.S. energy consumption in the year 2050 will
be about 160 EJ. A big question is, what will be the
sources  for  the  anticipated  growth  in  energy  con-
sumption? Will we follow past policy and business as
usual  (i.e.,  coal,  oil,  and  nuclear  power),  or  will  we
turn to alternative energy sources (e.g., wind, solar,
geothermal)? What seems certain is that our energy
sources  will  be  more  diversiﬁed  in  the  future  than
they are today.65,66

Sustainable Energy Policy
Energy  planning  for  the  future  is  complicated;  we
know  that  burning  fossil  fuels  is  degrading  our
global environment. We are seeking an new energy
path because65–67 (1) the age of cheap oil is coming
to an end, and this is a reality, whether it comes this

year or 20 years from now; (2) technology and eco-
nomic  opportunities  are  favorable  for  the  develop-
ment and use of much more alternative, renewable
energy; and (3) using much less fossil fuel will help
reduce  environmental  degradation  by  reducing
emissions of carbon dioxide and air pollutants and
by  increasing  security.  Although  there  is  sufﬁcient
coal  to  last  hundreds  of  years,  proponents  would
prefer  to  use  sustainable  energy  coal  as  a  short,
transitional  energy  source  rather  than  as  a  long-
term energy source. Others would argue for greatly
reducing the use of coal and using natural gas as the
transitional energy source to renewable sources. In
their  view,  development  of  a  sustainable  energy
policy means ﬁnding useful sources of energy that
can  be  maintained  and  that  do  not  pollute  the  at-
mosphere,  cause  climatic  perturbations,  such  as
global warming, or present unacceptable risk.

The  change  to  new,  sustainable  energy  policy
would, presumably, involve continued utilization of
fossil fuels in some form for transportation. Electri-
cal power will continue to be essential for many pur-
poses,  which  means  using  more  alternative  energy
(including nuclear power) and developing clean ways
to use coal. The energy path we take must be capable
of supplying the energy we require for human activi-
ties  without  endangering  the  planet.  This  is  the
heart of the concept of sustainable energy policy.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About Energy Transition to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. What are the impacts of popula-
tion increase on a potential tran-
sition from oil to other energy
sources?

2. For sustainable energy planning,

what needs to be done during
the transition?

3. How is the transition from oil po-
tentially linked to hazards, such

as conﬂicts between nations and
health hazards?

4. How do science and values link to
future planning during the tran-
sition from oil to other energy
sources? In other words, what do
our values have to do with future
energy choices?

Summary

We are approaching the time of peak
oil, when about one-half of the re-
coverable oil in the world will have

been used. As a result, we will need
to transition from oil to other en-
ergy sources. History tells us this

transition could take many decades
to perhaps a century. Likely energy
sources during the transition are

584

CHAPTER 16

Energy Resources

natural gas, nuclear power, and re-
newable sources, such as wind and
solar energy.

The ever-increasing world popula-
tion’s appetite for energy is stagger-
ing. It is time to seriously question
the need and desirability of an in-
creasing demand for electrical and
other forms of energy in industrial-
ized societies. Quality of life is not
necessarily directly related to greater
consumption of energy.

The fossil fuels—coal, oil, and

natural gas—are essentially stored
solar energy in the form of organic
material that has escaped destruc-
tion by oxidation. Although ongoing
geologic processes formed these
fuels, they are too slow to be of use
to us; fossil fuels are, therefore, con-
sidered to be nonrenewable re-
sources. The environmental disrup-
tion associated with exploration and
development of these resources must
be weighed against the beneﬁts
gained from the energy. This devel-
opment is not an either-or proposi-
tion; good conservation practices,
combined with pollution control and
reclamation, can help minimize the
environmental disruption associated
with fossil fuels.

There are still vast supplies of coal
in the world, 25 percent of which are
located in the United States. The
grade, or carbon content, of coal de-
termines its value as a fuel, while its
sulfur content determines how much
it pollutes the atmosphere with sul-
fur oxides.

Oil is found in large deposits

called ﬁelds; most ﬁelds are located
near modern and ancient plate
boundaries. Oil ﬁelds have been ex-
tensively mined by oil wells that
pump oil and gas to the surface. We
are approaching the time known as
peak oil when we will have used
about half of Earth’s total oil. Follow-
ing the peak, production will decrease
and there may be a gap between de-
mand and production. Barring dis-
covery of many major new ﬁelds,
shortages of oil and gas will occur in
the future. The impending shortages

have resulted in pressure to develop
new oil ﬁelds, some in sensitive
wilderness areas, such as the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge. Oil can be
recovered from Earth materials called
oil shales and tar sands, but mining
techniques that are economically and
environmentally sound have not
been fully developed. The potential
for environmental disruption exists
at every stage of oil development and
use; disruptions include oil spills
from tankers and air pollution from
burning of petroleum products in au-
tomobiles and power plants.

Natural gas reserves have dramati-

cally increased in recent years, espe-
cially with tight gas. As a result, 
natural gas is a likely candidate as an
energy source useful in the transition
from oil to alternative energy sources.

Nuclear ﬁssion produces vast

amounts of heat that can be used to
generate electricity in a nuclear
power plant. It also produces radioac-
tive wastes that must be safely dis-
posed of. Fission will remain an im-
portant source of energy, but the
possibility of environmental and
health hazards, as well as the increas-
ing cost of constructing large nuclear
power plants, remain as factors to be
considered. Finally, we continue to
struggle with the problem of radioac-
tive waste disposal—a scientiﬁc, 
economic, social, and political issue
involving risk management.

Use of geothermal energy will be-
come more widespread in the western
United States, where natural heat
ﬂow from Earth is relatively high. Al-
though the electrical energy produced
from the internal heat of Earth will
probably not exceed 10 percent of the
total electrical power generated, it can
still be signiﬁcant. Geothermal energy
has an environmental price. Surface
subsidence may be caused by the
withdrawal of ﬂuids and heat; in addi-
tion, earthquakes may be caused by
the injection of hot wastewater back
into the ground.

Renewable sources of energy de-
pend on solar energy and can take a
variety of forms, including direct

solar, water, wind, and energy from
biomass, including recycled biomass
from urban waste. These energy
sources are generally used to produce
electrical power. They will not be de-
pleted and are, thus, dependable in
the long term. They have varying at-
tributes but, generally, cause little en-
vironmental disruption, although the
burning of biomass does pollute the
atmosphere. However, most of these
sources are local and intermittent, and
some are still expensive to produce.
Continued growth and development
of solar energy and wind power, as
well as development of new technol-
ogy and innovations such as fuel cells,
will become more important in the fu-
ture. Solar and wind power, because
they are abundant, inexhaustible, and
clean, are the world’s fastest-growing
sources of energy. Hydropower will
undoubtedly continue to be an impor-
tant source of electricity in the future,
but it is not expected to grow much in
the United States because of lack of
potential sites and environmental
considerations.

Energy for the future will continue
to be uncertain. It does seem certain,
however, that we will continue to look
more seriously at conservation, en-
ergy efﬁciency, and cogeneration. The
most likely targets for energy efﬁ-
ciency, conservation, and cogenera-
tion are in the area of space heating
for homes and for various manufac-
turing processes and automobiles.
These areas collectively account for
approximately 60 percent of the 
total energy used in the United 
States today.

We are at a crossroads concerning
energy policy. The choice is between
centralized, high-technology energy
sources, using fossil fuels, and ﬂexi-
ble, renewable energy sources. Per-
haps the best path will be a mixture of
the old and the new, ensuring a ratio-
nal, smooth shift from our depen-
dence on fossil fuels. Our goal is to
develop a sustainable energy plan
that supplies the energy we need but
does not harm the environment or
endanger our national security.

Learning Objectives
Soils are an important part of our environment. Virtually all aspects of the terrestrial environment
interact with soils at some level. For example, we depend upon fertile soil to grow our food, and soil
properties determine, in part, the suitability of land for uses such as construction and waste
disposal. As a result, the protection of soil resources is an important objective. With this in

mind, we will focus on the following learning objectives for this chapter:

• Understand soil

terminology and the
processes responsible for
the development of soils
• Understand soil fertility
and the interactions of
water in soil processes

• Be familiar with soil

classiﬁcation

• Understand the primary
engineering properties
of soils

• Understand

relationships between
land use and soils

• Know what sediment
pollution is and how it
can be minimized

• Understand how soils

affect land use planning
• Understand how we can

sustain soil resources

Case History
Times Beach, Missouri

In 1982, Times
Beach, Missouri,
population 2,400,
was a river town
located on the
banks of the Mer-
amec River just
west of St. Louis.
The town was
founded in 1925
as a resort com-
munity to nearby
St. Louis. Due to
the ﬂood hazard,
some of the early
homes were built on
stilts above normal
ﬂood level. The river

town eventually became a
permanent community. The

town in the 1970s was a poor

one, and it couldn’t afford to pave

the streets. In 1983, the town was

evacuated and purchased for $36 mil-
lion by the government; Times Beach

became a ghost town when it was
discovered that waste oil sprayed on
the town’s road to control dust con-
tained dioxin (Figure 17.1). Dioxin
is a colorless crystal composed of
oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and chlo-
rine. It is known to be extremely
toxic to mammals and is suspected
of being a carcinogen in humans.
Horses at stables in the Times Beach
area began to die.1

There are approximately 75 types
of dioxin, which is produced as a by-
product during the production of or-
ganic chemicals, such as herbicides.2
Dioxin became a household word
during and after the Vietnam War; it
is a component of Agent Orange, the
name given to herbicides that were
used to defoliate large areas in the
war zones. Military personnel as well
as civilians were exposed to Agent
Orange and the dioxin within it. Law-
suit settlements pertaining to
dioxin’s role in causing diseases in

people exposed to it compensated
250,000 Vietnam veterans and their
families.

Soil tests at Times Beach deter-

mined that the entire area had been
contaminated with dioxin that had
seeped into the soil from the oil ap-
plied to the roads. The decision was
made in 1985 to evacuate the town
and bulldoze the buildings. Following
cleanup (many thousands of tons of
contaminated soil were removed and
incinerated) and planting of trees, the
area today is a state park and bird
refuge. The park, called Route 66
State Park, is one of Missouri’s
newest parks. The park has several
kilometers of trails for hiking, biking,
and horseback riding. The park has
picnic areas and a boat-launching fa-
cility that provides access to the
Meramec River.1

The effects of human exposure to
dioxin is a controversial subject. Ap-
parently, there is a cancer risk to

17.1 Introduction to Soils
The  big  question  with  soil  is:  Can  the  agricultural
systems that we depend on to feed a growing human
population maintain and improve soil fertility while
minimizing  soil  erosion?4 Figure  17.2 (page  590)
shows serious soil erosion with the development of
shallow gullies in a wheat ﬁeld in eastern Washing-
ton.  It  appears  that  many  of  our  agriculture  prac-
tices  are  mining  the  soil.  That  is,  soils  are  being
eroded faster than they are being produced by soil-
forming processes. Eventually, agricultural soil loss
could erode the foundation of our civilization. Soil
erosion has multiple effects, including loss of soil re-
sources and degradation of the quality of the water
due  to  sedimentation.  Soil  erosion  is  a  problem  in
urban  environments,  where  vegetation  may  be  re-
moved  prior  to  development.  Although  we  have
many safeguards in effect to minimize soil erosion

resulting from urbanization, the problem persists in
many  parts  of  the  United  States  and  is  severe  in
many parts of the world where protection of soil re-
sources may not be a high priority.4,5 We begin our
discussion of soils by deﬁning  soil and introducing
soil types, classiﬁcation, and processes.

Soil may be deﬁned in several ways. Soil scientists
deﬁne soil as solid Earth material that has been al-
tered by physical, chemical, and biological processes
such that it can support rooted plant life. Engineers
deﬁne  soil as  solid  Earth  material  that  can  be  re-
moved  without  blasting.  Both  of  these  deﬁnitions
are important in environmental geology. Geologists
must be aware of the different deﬁnitions; they must
also  be  aware  of  the  research  concerning  both  soil-
producing processes and the role of soils in environ-
mental problems. Engineers have developed the ﬁeld
of soil mechanics to quantify engineering properties
of soils, such as soil strength and moisture content.

workers who handle chemicals that
contain dioxin, but it is not thought to
be a widespread and signiﬁcant cancer
threat to people who are exposed to
very low levels of the chemical.3 Some
scientists, including the person who
ordered the evacuation, have since
stated that the evacuation at Times
Beach may have been an overreaction

by the government to the perceived
hazard of dioxin. Research concerning
the potential hazard presented from
exposure to dioxin continues, and the
controversy concerning its potential
harmful effects to people and ecosys-
tems is still being debated.

This chapter will discuss several im-

portant aspects of soil formation and

problems related to soil erosion and
pollution. Soils are of particular impor-
tance to environmental geology because
the Earth materials we often encounter
are soils that we build our homes on
and grow our food in. We shall see that,
as soil properties vary from place to
place, we must adjust our land use if we
are to sustain our landscape.

The  study  of  soil  properties,  particularly  with
reference  to  land-use  limitations,  is  becoming  an
important aspect of environmental work in the fol-
lowing ways:

• In land use planning, the suitability of land for
a particular use, or land capability, is often de-
termined,  in  part,  by  the  soils  present.  Soil
properties  are  especially  important  for  uses
such as urbanization, timber management, and
agriculture.

• Soils  are  critical  when  we  consider  waste-dis-
posal  problems.  Interactions  between  waste,
water, soil, and rock often determine the suit-
ability of a particular site for receiving waste.
• The study of soils helps land use planners eval-
uate  natural  hazards,  including  ﬂoods,  land-
slides, and earthquakes. Floodplain soils differ
from  upland  soils,  and  consideration  of  soil
properties helps delineate natural ﬂoodplains.

Evaluating  the  relative  ages  of  soils  on  land-
slide deposits may provide an estimate of the
frequency of slides; this information assists in
planning to minimize their impact. Soil studies
have also been a tool in establishing the age of
Earth materials deformed by faulting; this in-
formation leads to better estimation of earth-
quake recurrence intervals.

• Soils  often  carry  a  climatic  signal,  something
that  indicates  what  the  past  climate  was  like.
For example, calcium carbonate accumulates in
desert soils, and organic matter, such as bits of
plants,  accumulates  in  some  tropical  soils.
These  constituents  of  soils  assist  in  under-
standing  regional  and  global  climate  change.
Soil studies also provide important data used
to  understand  how  biological  and  geologic
processes  were  linked  in  the  development  of
both soils and ecosystems during the past few
million years.6

17.2 Soil Proﬁles
Soil  development  is  a  complex  process.  The  rock
and hydrologic cycles interact to produce weathered
rock  materials  that  are  basic  ingredients  of  soils.
Weathering is the physical and chemical breakdown of
minerals and rocks and the ﬁrst step in soil develop-
ment (see Chapter 3). Weathered rock is further mod-
iﬁed into soil by the activity of soil organisms. This
process forms residual or transported soil. Weathered
material that remains essentially in place is modiﬁed
to form a residual soil on bedrock. The red soils of the
Piedmont in the southeastern United States, formed
on igneous and metamorphic rocks, are an example
of residual soil. Eroded rock particles that are trans-
ported by water, wind, or glaciers and then modiﬁed
in their new deposition location form transported soil.
The fertile soils formed on glacial deposits in the mid-
western United States are transported soils.

A soil can be considered an open system that in-
teracts with other components of the geologic cycle.
The characteristics of a particular soil are a function
of  climate,  topography,  parent  material  (i.e.,  the

rock from which the soil is formed), maturity (i.e.,
age of the soil), and biological processes.

Soil Horizons
Vertical and horizontal movements of the materials
in a soil system create a distinct layering, parallel to
the  surface,  collectively  called  a  soil  proﬁle.  The
layers are called zones, or soil horizons. Our discus-
sion  of  soil  proﬁles  mentions  only  the  horizons
most commonly found in soils. Additional informa-
tion is available from detailed soils texts.7–9

Figure  17.3a shows  the  common  master,  or
prominent, soil horizons. The O horizon and A hori-
zon contain  highly  concentrated  organic  material,
such as decomposing plants. The differences between
these two layers reﬂect the amount of organic mate-
rial present in each. In general, the O horizon con-
sists almost entirely of plant litter and other organic
material, whereas the underlying A horizon contains
a  good  deal  of  both  organic  and  mineral  material.
Below the O or A horizons, some soils have an E hori-
zon, or zone of leaching, a light-colored layer that is

(a)

O. Horizon is composed mostly of organic materials including
     decomposed or decomposing leaves, twigs, etc. The color
     of the horizon is often dark brown or black.

A. Horizon is composed of both mineral and organic materials. The 
    color is often light black to brown. Leaching, defined as the process
    of dissolving, washing, or draining Earth materials by percolation of
    groundwater or other liquids, occurs in the A horizon and moves clay
    and other material such as iron and calcium to the B horizon.

E. Horizon is composed of light-colored materials resulting from leaching
    of clay, calcium, magnesium, and iron to lower horizons. The A and
    E horizons together constitute the zone of leaching.

B. Horizon is enriched in clay, iron oxides, silica, carbonate, or other
    material leached from overlying horizons. Horizon is known as the
    zone of accumulation.

C. Horizon is composed of partially altered (weathered) parent material;
    rock is shown here but the material could also be alluvial in nature,
    such as river gravels in other environments. The horizon may be stained
    red with iron oxides.

leached of iron-bearing components. This horizon is
light in color because it contains less organic material
than the O and A horizons and little inorganic color-
ing material, such as iron oxides.

The B horizon, or zone of accumulation, underlies
the O, A, or E horizons and consists of a variety of
materials  translocated  downward  from  overlying
horizons. Several types of B horizons have been rec-
ognized. Probably the most important type of B hori-
zon is the argillic B horizon (Bt). An argillic B horizon
is  enriched  in  clay  minerals  that  have  been  translo-
cated downward by soil-forming processes. Environ-
mental geologists are also interested in the Bk horizon,
which  is  characterized  by  accumulation  of  calcium
carbonate. The carbonate coats individual soil parti-
cles and may ﬁll some pore spaces within the soil. It
does  not,  however,  dominate  the  structure  of  the
horizon. If a soil horizon is impregnated with calcium
carbonate to the extent that its morphology is domi-
nated  by  the  carbonate,  it  is  designated  a  K horizon
(Figure  17.3b).  Carbonate  completely  ﬁlls  the  pore
spaces in K horizons, often forming layers parallel to
the surface. The term caliche is often used for an ir-
regular accumulation or layers of calcium carbonate
in Earth material near the surface.

The C horizon consists of parent material partially
altered by weathering processes. It lies directly over
the  R  horizon,  which  is  unaltered  parent  material
composed  of  consolidated  bedrock  that  underlies
the soil. Some of the fractures and other pore spaces
in  the  bedrock  may  contain  clay  that  has  been
translocated downward.7

The term hardpan is often used to refer to a hard
compacted soil horizon, usually part of the B horizon.
Hardpan is often composed of compacted clay or ce-
mented with calcium carbonate, iron oxide, or silica.
Hardpan  horizons  may  be  nearly  impermeable  and,
thus, restrict the downward movement of soil water.

17.3 Soil Properties
Color
One  of  the  ﬁrst  things  we  notice  about  a  soil  is  its
color, or the colors of its horizons. The O and A hori-
zons  tend  to  be  dark  because  of  their  abundant
organic  material.  The  E  horizon,  if  present,  may  be
almost  white  because  of  the  leaching  of  iron  and
aluminum oxides. The B horizon shows the most dra-
matic differences in color, varying from yellow-brown
to  light  red-brown  to  dark  red,  depending  on  the

presence of clay minerals and iron oxides. Bk horizons
may be light colored because of their carbonates, but
they are sometimes reddish as a result of iron oxide
accumulation.  If  a  true  K  horizon  has  developed,  it
may be almost white because of the abundance of cal-
cium carbonate. Although soil color can be an impor-
tant  diagnostic  tool  for  analyzing  a  soil  proﬁle,  one
must be cautious about calling a red layer a B horizon.
The original parent material, if rich in iron, may pro-
duce a very red soil, even when there has been rela-
tively little soil proﬁle development.

Soil color may be an important indicator of how
well a soil drains. Well-drained soils are well aerated,
creating oxidizing conditions; for example, in a well-
aerated  soil,  iron  produces  soil  with  a  red  color.
Poorly drained soils are wet, and these soils tend to
have a yellow color. This distinction is important be-
cause poorly drained soils are associated with envi-
ronmental  problems,  such  as  lower  slope  stability
and an inability to be utilized as a disposal medium
for household sewage systems.

Texture
The texture of a soil depends upon the relative propor-
tions  of  sand-,  silt-,  and  clay-sized  particles  (Figure
17.4). Clay particles have a diameter of less than 0.004
mm (0.0002 in.); silt particles have diameters ranging
from  0.004  to  0.063  mm  (0.0002  to  0.003  in.);  and
sand particles are 0.063 to 2.0 mm (0.003 to 0.08 in.)
in diameter. Earth materials with particles larger than
2.0 mm (0.08 in.) in diameter are called gravel, cob-
bles, or boulders, depending on the particle size.

In the ﬁeld, soil texture is commonly identiﬁed by
estimation and then reﬁned in a laboratory by sepa-
rating and determining the proportions of the sand,
silt, and clay. A useful field technique for estimating
the size of sand-sized or smaller soil particles is as fol-
lows: It is sand if you can see individual grains, silt if
you can see the grains with a 10× hand lens, and clay if
you cannot see grains with such a hand lens. Another
method is to feel the soil. Sand is gritty; it crunches
between the teeth. Silt feels like baking ﬂour, and clay
is cohesive. When mixed with water, smeared on the
back of the hand, and allowed to dry, clay cannot eas-
ily be dusted off, whereas silt or sand can.

Structure
Soil particles often cling together in aggregates called
peds that are classiﬁed according to shape into several
types.  Figure  17.5 shows  some  of  the  common

Soil Properties

FIGURE 17.4 Soil texture classes The classes are de-
ﬁned according to the percentage of clay-, silt-, and sand-
sized particles in the soil sample. The area deﬁned by the
point connected by dashed lines represents a soil com-
posed of 40 percent sand, 40 percent silt, and 20 percent
clay, which is classiﬁed as loam. Loam is a soil composed of
sand, silt, and clay sized particles in relatively even (20–40%)
concentration. Variable organic material is also present.
Loam soils are good for agriculture because they retain nu-
trients, and water, while allowing water to ﬂow through.

structures of peds found in soils. The type of struc-

some of these processes are poorly understood.7 For
example,  granular  structure  is  fairly  common  in  A
horizons,  whereas  blocky  and  prismatic  structures
are  most  likely  to  be  found  in  B  horizons.  Soil
structure is an important diagnostic tool for evalu-
ating the development and approximate age of soil
proﬁles.  In  general,  as  the  proﬁle  develops  with

time, structure becomes more complex and may go
from granular to blocky to prismatic as the clay con-
tent in the argillic B horizons increases.

Relative Soil Proﬁle Development
Most  environmental  geologists  will  not  have  occa-
sion to make detailed soil descriptions and analyses
of soil data. However, it is important for geologists

594

CHAPTER 17

Soils and Environment

to  recognize  differences  among  weakly  developed,
moderately developed, and well-developed soils—that
is, to recognize their relative proﬁle development.
These  distinctions  are  useful  in  the  preliminary
evaluation  of  soil  properties  and  help  determine
whether the opinion of a soil scientist is necessary
in a particular project:

• A weakly developed soil proﬁle is generally char-
acterized  by  an  A  horizon  directly  over  a  C
horizon (with no B horizon or one that is very
weakly developed). The C horizon may be oxi-
dized. Such soils tend to be only a few hundred
years old in most areas, but they may be sever-
al thousand years old in others.

• A moderately developed soil proﬁle may consist of
an A horizon overlying an argillic Bt horizon that
overlies  the  C  horizon.  A  carbonate  Bk horizon
may also be present but is not necessary for a soil
to  be  considered  moderately  developed.  These
soils have a B horizon with translocated changes,
a  better-developed  texture,  and  redder  colors
than  those  that  are  weakly  developed.  Moder-
ately developed soils often date from at least the
Pleistocene (i.e., are more than 10,000 years old).
• A  well-developed  soil  proﬁle is  characterized  by
redder colors in the Bt horizon, more transloca-
tion of clay to the Bt horizon, and stronger struc-
ture.  A  K  horizon  may  also  be  present  but  is
not necessary for a soil to be considered strongly

(a)

developed.  Well-developed  soils  vary  widely  in
age, with typical ranges between 40,000 and sev-
eral hundred thousand years and older.

Soil Chronosequences
A  soil  chronosequence is  a  series  of  soils  arranged
from youngest to oldest on the basis of their relative
proﬁle  development.  Such  a  sequence  is  valuable  in
hazards work because it provides information about
the recent history of a landscape, allowing us to eval-
uate site stability when locating critical facilities such
as a waste disposal operation or a large power plant. A
chronosequence  combined  with  numerical  dating
(i.e., applying a variety of dating techniques, such as
radiocarbon 14C, to obtain a date in years before the
present time of the soil) may provide the data neces-
sary to make such inferential statements as, “There is
no evidence of ground rupture due to earthquakes in
the  past  1,000  years”  or  “The  last  mudﬂow  was  at
least 30,000 years ago.” It takes a lot of work to estab-
lish  a  chronosequence  in  soils  in  a  particular  area.
However,  once  such  a  chronosequence  is  developed
and dated, it may be applied to a speciﬁc problem.

Consider,  for  example,  the  landscape  shown  in
Figure  17.6,  an  offset  alluvial  fan  along  the  San
Andreas fault in the Indio Hills of southern California.
The fan is offset about 0.7 km (70,000 cm). Soil pits
excavated in the alluvial fan suggest that it is at least

20,000 years old but younger than 45,000 years. The
age was estimated on the basis of correlation with a
soil  chronosequence  in  the  nearby  Mojave  Desert,
where numerical dates for similar soils are available.
Soil development on the offset alluvial fan allowed the
age  of  the  fan  to  be  estimated.  This  allowed  the  slip
rate (i.e., the amount of offset of the fan divided by the
age of the fan—that is, 70,000 cm ⫼ 20,000 years) for
this part of the San Andreas fault to be estimated at
about  3.5  cm/yr  (35  m/1,000  yr).10,11 More  recent

exposure dating, suggests the age 35,500 ⫾ 2,500 years.
This new and more accurate estimation of age provides
a maximum slip rate of about 2 cm per year. Thus, the
earlier  soil  date  has  been  improved  by  more  recent
technology. As numerical dating has improved, the use
of soil development as a dating tool has decreased.

The slip rate for this segment of the fault was not
previously known. The rate is signiﬁcant because it
is a necessary ingredient in the eventual estimation
of  the  probability  and  the  recurrence  interval  of
large, damaging earthquakes.

17.4 Soil Fertility
A soil may be considered a complex ecosystem. A sin-
gle cubic meter of soil may contain millions of living
things,  including  small  rodents,  insects,  worms,
algae,  fungi,  and  bacteria.  These  organisms  are  im-
portant  for  mixing  and  aerating  the  soil  particles.
They  also  help  release  or  convert  nutrients  in  soils
into forms that are useful for plants.12 Soil fertility
refers to the capacity of soil to supply nutrients, such
as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, needed for
plant growth when other factors are favorable.13

Soils  that  developed  on  some  ﬂoodplains  and
glacial  deposits  contain  sufﬁcient  nutrients  and  or-
ganic  material  to  be  naturally  fertile.  Other  soils,
developed  on  highly  leached  bedrock  or  on  loose
deposits with little organic material, may be nutrient
poor  and  have  low  fertility.  Soils  are  often  manipu-
lated to increase plant yield by applying either fertiliz-
ers to supply nutrients or materials that improve the
soil’s texture and moisture retention. Soil fertility can
be  reduced  by  soil  erosion  or  leaching  that  removes
nutrients,  by  interruption  of  natural  processes  that
supply  nutrients,  such  as  ﬂooding,  or  by  continued
use of pesticides that alter or damage soil organisms.
The development and maintenance of many ter-
restrial  ecosystems  depend  upon  soil  as  a  basic

Water in Soil

component  of  the  system.  Interactions  between
physical  and  biochemical  processes  operate  over
variable  scales  of  time  (hundreds  to  thousands  of
years) and space (from less than 1 km2 to thousands
of square kilometers) to produce soils that help sup-
port complex ecosystems. Soils go through stages of
development, sustaining, and degrading.6 Develop-
ment  is  a  relatively  fast  process  that  starts  with  a
new substrate, or layer, such as sediment from a vol-
canic eruption or ﬂood. Chemical weathering of min-
erals releases chemicals that can be used by a variety
of organisms, including plants, that build soils. Sus-
taining soils involves longer time lines—thousands
to several millions of years, during which additional
minerals  in  the  soils  continue  to  weather,  forming
clays. Soil degradation occurs as minerals necessary
to support an ecosystem are depleted by a variety of
near-surface  physical,  hydrologic,  and  biological
processes.  A  physical  process,  soil  erosion,  can  re-
move  upper  soil  horizons  and  their  nutrients.  In
some  cases,  soil  degradation  processes  may  be  re-
duced.  For  example,  nutrients  contained  in  dust
from the deserts of Africa may reach islands of the
Paciﬁc, helping maintain soil fertility after weather-
ing and water moving through the soil have removed
some of the original mineral nutrients in soils.6

If you analyze a block of soil, you will ﬁnd that it is
composed of bits of solid mineral and organic mat-
ter  with  pore  spaces  between  them  (Figure  17.7).

CHAPTER 17

Soils and Environment

The pore spaces are ﬁlled with gases (mostly air) or
liquids  (mostly  water).  If  all  the  pore  spaces  in  a
block of soil are completely ﬁlled with water, the soil
is said to be in a saturated condition; otherwise, it is
said to be unsaturated. Soils in swampy areas may be
saturated year-round, whereas soils in arid regions
may be only occasionally saturated.14

The amount and movement of water through soils
are  important  research  topics.  Both  are  linked  to
water pollution problems, such as the movement of
gasoline from leaking underground tanks or the mi-
gration of liquid pollutants from waste-disposal sites.

17.6 Soil Classiﬁcation
Terminology and classiﬁcation of soils pose unique
problems in environmental geology. We are often in-
terested  in  both  soil  processes  and  human  use  of

soil.  A  classiﬁcation  system,  or  taxonomy,  that  in-
cludes engineering as well as physical and chemical
properties  would  be  most  appropriate,  but  none
exists.  We  must,  therefore,  be  familiar  with  two
separate  systems  of  soil  classiﬁcation:  soil  taxon-
omy,  used  by  soil  scientists,  and  the  engineering
classiﬁcation, which groups soils by material types
and engineering properties.

Soil Taxonomy
Soil scientists have developed a comprehensive and
systematic classiﬁcation of soils known as soil taxon-
omy,  which  emphasizes  the  physical  and  chemical
properties of the soil profile. This classification is
a  sixfold  hierarchy,  with  soils  grouped  into  orders,
suborders,  great  groups,  subgroups,  families,  and
series.  The  eleven  orders  (Table  17.1)  are  mostly

General Properties

No horizon development; many are recent alluvium; synthetic soils are included; often young soils.

Include swelling clays (greater than 35%) that expand and contract with changing moisture content. Generally
form in regions with pronounced wet and dry seasons.

One or more horizons have developed quickly; horizons are often difﬁcult to differentiate; most often found in
young but not recent land surfaces; have appreciable accumulation of organic material; most common in
humid climates but range from the arctic to the tropics; native vegetation is most often forest.

Desert soils; soils of dry places; low organic accumulation; have subsoil horizon where gypsum, caliche
(calcium carbonate), salt, or other materials may accumulate.

Soils characterized by black, organic-rich A horizon (prairie soils); surface horizons are also rich in bases.
Commonly found in semiarid and subhumid regions.

Soils derived primarily from volcanic materials; relatively rich in chemically active minerals that rapidly take 
up important biologic elements, such as carbon and phosphorus.

Soils characterized by ash-colored sands over subsoil, accumulations of amorphous iron-aluminum
sesquioxides, and humus. They are acid soils that commonly form in sandy parent materials. Are found
principally under forests in humid regions.

Soils characterized by a brown or gray-brown surface horizon and an argillic (clay-rich) subsoil accumulation
with an intermediate to high base saturation (greater than 35%, as measured by the sum of cations, such as
calcium, sodium, magnesium, etc.). Commonly form under forests in humid regions of the midlatitudes.

Soils characterized by an argillic horizon with low base saturation (less than 35%, as measured by the sum of
cations); often have a red-yellow or reddish-brown color; restricted to humid climates and generally form on
older landforms or younger, highly weathered parent materials.

Relatively featureless, often deep soils, leached of bases, hydrated, containing oxides of iron and aluminum
(laterite), as well as kaolinite clay. Primarily restricted to tropical and subtropical regions.

Organic soils (peat, muck, bog).

based  on  gross  soil  morphology  (i.e.,  number  and
types of horizons present), nutrient status, organic
content (plant debris, etc.), color (red, yellow, brown,
white,  etc.),  and  general  climatic  considerations
(amount of precipitation, average temperature, etc.).
With each step down the hierarchy, more informa-
tion about a speciﬁc soil becomes known.

Soil taxonomy is especially useful for agricultural
and related land-use purposes. It has been criticized
for being too complex and for lacking sufﬁcient tex-
tural and engineering information to be of optimal
use  in  site  evaluation  for  engineering  purposes.
Nevertheless,  a  serious  Earth  scientist  must  have
knowledge  of  this  classiﬁcation  because  it  is  com-
monly used by soil scientists and Quaternary geolo-
gists—those  who  study  Earth  materials  and  the
processes of recent (i.e., the past 2.6 million years)
Earth history.

Engineering Classiﬁcation 
of Soils
The  uniﬁed  soil  classiﬁcation  system,  widely  used 
in  engineering  practice,  is  shown  in  Table  17.2. 
Because all natural soils are mixtures of coarse par-
ticles  (including  gravel  and  sand),  fine  particles
(including silt and clay), and organic material, the
major  divisions  of  this  system  are  coarse-grained
soils,  ﬁne-grained  soils,  and  organic  soils.  Each
group is based on the predominant particle size or
the  abundance  of  organic  material  in  the  soil.
Organic  soils  have  a  high  organic  content  and  are
identiﬁed  by  their  black  or  gray  color  and  some-
times by an odor of hydrogen sulﬁde, which smells
like rotten eggs. Linkages between the uniﬁed soil
classiﬁcation and engineering properties are listed
in Table 17.3.

Signiﬁcant Properties

Boulders and cobbles are very stable components
used for ﬁlls, ballast, and riprap. Because of size and
weight, their occurrence in natural deposits tends to
improve the stability of foundations. Angularity of
particles increases stability.

Gravel and sand have essentially the same
engineering properties, differing mainly in degree.
They are easy to compact, little affected by moisture,
and not subject to frost action. Gravels are generally
more pervious and more stable and resistant to
erosion and piping than are sands. The well-graded*
sands and gravels are generally less pervious and
more stable than those that are poorly graded and of
uniform gradation.

Silt is inherently unstable, particularly with increased
moisture, and has a tendency to become quick when
saturated. It is relatively impervious, difﬁcult to
compact, highly susceptible to frost heave, easily
erodible, and subject to piping and boiling. Bulky
grains reduce compressibility, whereas ﬂaky grains
(such as mica) increase compressibility, producing an
elastic silt.

The distinguishing characteristic of clay is cohesion or
cohesive strength, which increases with decreasing
moisture. The permeability of clay is very low; it is
difﬁcult to compact when wet and impossible to drain
by ordinary means; when compacted, is resistant to
erosion and piping; not susceptible to frost heave;
and subject to expansion and shrinkage with changes
in moisture. The properties are inﬂuenced not only by
the size and shape (ﬂat or platelike) but also by their
mineral composition. In general, the montmorillonite
clay mineral has the greatest and kaolinite the least
adverse effect on the properties.

Organic matter present even in moderate amounts
increases the compressibility and reduces the stability
of the ﬁne-grained components. It may decay,
causing voids, or change the properties of a soil by
chemical alteration; hence, organic soils are not
desirable for engineering purposes.

*The term well-graded indicates an even distribution of sizes and is equivalent to poorly sorted.
Note: The uniﬁed soil classiﬁcation system does not recognize cobbles and boulders with symbols. The size range for these, as well as the upper limit for clay, are
classiﬁed according to Wentworth (1922).

17.7 Engineering Properties 

of Soils

The  water  table  acts  as  a  transition  zone  within
Earth. Pores in rocks below the water table are satu-
rated;  those  above  are  not.  Soil  above  the  water
table has three distinct parts, or phases: solid mater-
ial, liquid, and gas, such as air or carbon dioxide. A
soil’s usefulness is greatly affected by the variations
in the proportions and structure of the three phases.
The  types  of  solid  materials,  the  particle  size,  and
the water content are probably the most signiﬁcant
variables  that  determine  engineering  properties  of
soils. Important engineering properties are strength,
sensitivity,  compressibility,  erodibility,  hydraulic
conductivity, corrosion potential, ease of excavation,
and  shrink–swell  potential.  Table  17.3 lists  the
linkages between the uniﬁed soil classiﬁcation sys-
tem and engineering properties of soil.

Soil Strength
Soil strength is the ability of a soil to resist deforma-
tion. It is difﬁcult to generalize about the strength
of soils. Numerical averages of the strength of a soil
can be misleading because soils are often composed
of mixtures, zones, or layers of materials with dif-
ferent physical and chemical properties.

Engineering Properties of Soils

beach (Figure 17.8).15 Friction between grains also
contributes to the strength of a soil. The total fric-
tional  force  is  a  function  of  the  density,  size,  and
shape of the soil particles and of the weight of overly-
ing particles that force the grains together. Frictional
forces are most signiﬁcant in coarse-grained soils rich
in sand and gravel. Because of frictional forces, you
do  not  sink  far  into  the  sand  when  walking  on  dry
sand on beaches. Most soils are a mixture of coarse
and ﬁne particles, so the strength is usually a result of
both cohesion and internal friction. Although it is dif-
ﬁcult to generalize, clay-rich soils with weak clay min-
erals and organic-rich soils, such as peaty soils, tend
to have lower strengths than coarser soils.

Vegetation  may  play  an  important  role  in  soil
strength. For example, tree roots may provide consid-
erable  cohesion  through  the  binding  characteristics
of a continuous root mat or by anchoring individual
roots  to  bedrock  beneath  thin  soils  on  steep  slopes
(Figure 17.9).

Soil Sensitivity
Soil sensitivity measures changes in soil strength re-
sulting from disturbances such as vibrations or ex-
cavations. Sand and gravel soils with no clay are the
least sensitive. As ﬁne material becomes abundant,
soils  become  more  and  more  sensitive.  Some  clay
soils may lose 75 percent or more of their strength
after a disturbance.16

The strength of a particular soil type is a function of
cohesive and frictional forces. Cohesion is a measure of
the ability of very small silt and
clay  soil  particles  to  stick  to-
gether. The cohesion of particles
in  ﬁne-grained  soils  is  primarily
the  result  of  electrostatic  forces
between particles and is a signiﬁ-
cant  factor  in  determining  the
strength of a soil. In partially sat-
urated 
sandy
soils, moisture ﬁlms between the
grains may cause an apparent co-
hesion  due  to  surface  tension
caused by the attraction of water
molecules  to  each  other  at  the
surface  or  between  soil  grains
(Figure  17.7).  The  principle  of
cohesion  explains  the  ability  of
damp  sand,  which  is  cohesion-
less when dry, to stand in verti-
cal  walls  in  sand  castles  on  the

coarse-grained, 

FIGURE 17.8 Apparent cohesion Sand castle. The surface tension of water mole-
cules in the damp sand enables the walls of the castle to stand. (Brasil2/iStockphoto)

Soils and Environment

FIGURE 17.9 Root strength Tree

this riverbank soil together. (Edward A. Keller)

Soil Compressibility
Soil compressibility is a measure of a soil’s tendency
to consolidate, or decrease in volume. Compressibil-
ity is partially a function of the elastic nature of the
soil particles and is directly related to the settling of
structures, such as the world-famous Leaning Tower
of  Pisa  in  Italy  (Figure  17.10).  Excessive  settling
will  crack  foundations  and  walls.  Coarse  materials,
such as gravels and sands, have a low compressibil-
ity,  and  settling  will  be  considerably  less  in  these
materials  than  in  highly  compressible  ﬁne-grained
or organic soils.

Erodibility
Soil erodibility refers to the ease with which soil ma-
terials can be removed by wind or water. Soils with a
high  erosion  factor  include  unprotected  silts  and
sands. Cohesive soils, which are more than 20 per-
cent clay, naturally cemented soils, and coarse gravel-
rich soils are not as easily eroded by wind or water
and, therefore, have a low erosion factor.

Hydraulic Conductivity
Hydraulic  conductivity  (K) is  a  measure  of  the  ease
with  which  water  moves  through  a  material.  Hy-
draulic conductivity is measured in units of velocity,
centimeters  per  second,  or  centimeters  per  hour
(see the discussion of groundwater in Chapter 13).
Saturated clean gravels or sands have the highest K
values (from 5 to greater than 50 cm per hour [2 to

FIGURE 17.10 Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italy The lean is
a result of differential settling of the soil. If correction measures
had not been taken to strengthen the tower, it would have fallen
over. (stevenallan/iStockphoto)

greater than 20 in. per hour]). As ﬁne particles in a
saturated mixture of clean gravel and sand increase,
K  decreases.  Saturated  clays  generally  have  a  very
low K, less than 0.025 cm (0.01 in.) per hour.9 Hy-
draulic conductivity in unsaturated soils is complex;
ﬁne-grained, unsaturated soils actually pull or suck
water and hold it tightly. Hydraulic conductivity is
very  important  in  many  soil  environmental  prob-
lems related to soil drainage, the movement of liq-
uid  pollutants  in  soils,  and  land  use  potential  for
agriculture, waste disposal, and construction.

Corrosion Potential
Corrosion is a slow weathering or chemical decompo-
sition  that  proceeds  from  the  surface  into  the
ground. All objects buried in the ground—pipes, ca-
bles, anchors, and fence posts, for example—are sub-
ject  to  corrosion.  The  corrosiveness  of  a  particular
soil depends on the chemistry of the soil, the buried
material, and the amount of water available.17

Ease of Excavation
Ease  of  excavation pertains  to  the  procedures,  and
hence the equipment, required to remove soils during
construction. There are three general categories of ex-
cavation  techniques.  Common  excavation is  accom-
plished with an earth mover, a backhoe, or a bulldozer.
This equipment essentially removes the soil without
having to scrape it ﬁrst; most soils can be removed by
this process. Rippable excavation requires breaking up
the soil with special ripping teeth before it can be re-
moved. For example, a tightly compacted or cemented
soil would require rippable excavation. Blasting or rock
cutting is the third, and often the most expensive, cat-
egory; a hard, silica cemented soil might need to be cut
with a jackhammer before being removed.

Shrink–Swell Potential
Shrink–swell potential refers to the tendency of a
soil to gain or lose water. Soils that tend to increase
or decrease in volume with water content are called
expansive soils. The swelling is caused by the chem-
ical attraction of water molecules to the submicro-
scopic ﬂat particles, or plates, of certain clay minerals.
The  plates  are  composed  primarily  of  silica,  alu-
minum, and oxygen atoms, and layers of water are
added  between  the  plates  as  the  clay  expands  or
swells  (Figure  17.11a).18 Expansive  soils  tend  to
absorb large quantities of water and expand. Cracks

in the ground form when the soil dries out and con-
tracts  (Figure  17.11c).  Montmorillonite is  the  com-
mon  clay  mineral  associated  with  most  expansive
soils.  With  sufﬁcient  water,  pure  montmorillonite
may expand up to 15 times its original volume; for-
tunately, most soils contain limited amounts of this
clay mineral, so it is unusual for an expansive soil to
swell beyond 25 to 50 percent. However, an increase
in volume of more than 3 percent is considered po-
tentially hazardous.18

Expansive soils in the United States cause signiﬁ-
cant  environmental  problems.  As  one  of  our  most
costly natural hazards, expansive soils are responsi-
ble for several billions of dollars in damages annu-
ally  to  highways,  buildings,  and  other  structures.
Every year, more than 250,000 new houses are con-
structed on expansive soils. Of these, about 60 per-
cent  will  experience  some  minor  damage,  such  as
cracks  in  the  foundation,  walls,  driveway,  or  walk-
way (Figure 17.11b,d); 10 percent will be seriously
damaged, some beyond repair.19,20

Structural damage on expansive soils is caused by
volume changes in the soil in response to changes in
moisture  content.  Factors  that  affect  the  moisture
content of an expansive soil include climate, vegeta-
tion, topography, drainage, and quality of construc-
tion.19 Builders  in  regions  that  have  a  pronounced
wet season followed by a dry season allow for a regu-
lar  shrink–swell  sequence.  These  regions,  such  as
the southwestern United States, are more likely to
experience  an  expansive  soil  problem  than  are  re-
gions where precipitation is more evenly distributed
throughout the year. Vegetation can cause changes
in the moisture content of soils. Because large trees
draw and use a lot of local soil moisture, especially
during  a  dry  season,  they  facilitate  soil  shrinkage.
Therefore, in areas with expansive soil, trees should
not  be  planted  close  to  the  foundations  of  light
structures, such as homes (Figure 17.11b).

Topography and drainage are also signiﬁcant fac-
tors  for  evaluating  expansive  soils.  Adverse  topo-
graphic and drainage conditions cause water to form
ponds  around  or  near  structures,  increasing  the
swelling  of  expansive  clays.  However,  homeowners
and  contractors  can  do  a  great  deal  to  avoid  this
problem.  Proper  design  of  subsurface  drains  and
rain gutters can minimize expansive soil damages by
improving  drainage,  as  may  designing  and  con-
structing 
to  accommodate  some
shrinking and swelling of the soil.19

Clearly, some soils are more desirable than oth-
ers for speciﬁc uses. Although planners concerned
with land use will not conduct soil tests to evaluate
the  engineering  properties  of  soils,  they  will  be
better prepared to take advantage of geologic con-
ditions  if  they  understand  the  basic  terminology
and  principles  of  Earth  materials.  Our  discussion
of  engineering  properties  established  two  general
principles.  First,  because  of  their  low  strength,
high  sensitivity,  high  compressibility,  low  perme-
ability,  and  variable  shrink–swell  potential,  clay
soils should be avoided in projects involving heavy
structures, structures with minimal allowable set-
tling,  or  projects  needing  well-drained  soils.  Sec-
ond,  soils  that  have  a  high  corrosive  potential  or
that require other than common excavation should
be  avoided  if  possible.  If  such  soils  cannot  be
avoided,  extra  care,  special  materials  and  tech-
niques,  and  higher-than-average  initial  costs—

including planning, design, and construction—must
be expected. The secondary costs—that is, the oper-
ation and maintenance costs of these projects—may
also be greater.

17.8 Rates of Soil Erosion
Rates  of  soil  erosion  are  measured  as  a  volume,
mass, or weight of soil that is removed from a lo-
cation  within  a  specified  time  and  area,  such  as
kilograms  per  year  per  hectare.  Soil  erosion  rates
vary  with  the  engineering  properties  of  the  soil,
land use, topography, and climate.

There are several approaches to measuring rates of
soil erosion. The most direct method is to make ac-
tual measurements on slopes over a period of at least
several years and use these values as representative of
what is happening over a wider area and longer time

The Universal Soil Loss Equation

The Universal Soil Loss Equation is

A ⫽ RELSCP

where

A ⫽ long-term average annual
soil loss for the site being
considered

R ⫽ long-term rainfall runoff ero-

sion factor

E ⫽ soil erodibility index

L ⫽ hillslope/length factor

S ⫽ hillslope/gradient, or slope

factor

C ⫽ soil cover factor

P ⫽ erosion-control practice factor

The advantage of using this equation
is that, once the various factors have
been determined and multiplied to-
gether to produce predicted soil loss,
conservation practices may be applied
through factors C and P to reduce the
soil loss to the desired level. For slopes

that are amenable to shaping, factors
E, L, and S may also be manipulated to
achieve desired sediment loss results.
This equation is particularly valuable
for evaluating construction sites and
areas along corridors, such as pipelines
and highways. When planning con-
struction sites, planners can use the
Universal Soil Loss Equation to predict
the impact of sediment loss on local
streams and other resources and to
develop management strategies for
minimizing this impact.21,22

span. This approach is rarely used, however, because
data from individual slopes and drainage basins are
very difﬁcult to obtain. A second approach is to use
data obtained from resurveying reservoirs to calcu-
late the change in the reservoirs’ storage capacity of
water; the depletion of storage capacity is equivalent
to  the  volume  of  sediment  eroded  from  upstream
soils. A third approach is to use an equation to calcu-
late rates of sediment eroded from a particular site.
One  of  the  most  commonly  used  equations  is  the
Universal  Soil  Loss  Equation.21 This  equation  uses
data  on  rainfall,  runoff,  the  size  and  shape  of  the
slope, the soil cover, and erosion-control practices to
predict the amount of soil moved from its original
position22 (see  A  Closer  Look:  The  Universal  Soil
Loss Equation).

17.9 Sediment Pollution
Sediment is one of our greatest pollutants. In many
areas,  it  chokes  streams;  ﬁlls  in  lakes,  reservoirs,
ponds, canals, drainage ditches, and harbors; buries
vegetation;  and  generally  creates  a  nuisance  that  is
difﬁcult  to  remove.  Natural  pollutional  sediment—
eroded  soil—is  truly  a  resource  out  of  place.  It  de-
pletes soil at its site of origin (Figure 17.12), reduces
the  quality  of  the  water  it  enters,  and  may  deposit

unwanted  sediment  on  productive  croplands  or
other useful land (Figure 17.13).23

Sources of the sediment include land disturbed for
agriculture;  land  overgrazed  by  animals,  such  as
sheep or cattle; urban construction sites; land recently

Case History
Reduction of Sediment Pollution, Maryland

A study in Maryland demonstrated
that sediment control measures can
reduce sediment pollution in an ur-
banizing area.24 The suspended sedi-
ment transported by the northwest
branch of the Anacostia River near
Colesville, Maryland, with a drainage
area of 55 km2 (21 mi2), was mea-
sured over a 10-year period. During
that time, construction within the
basin involved about 3 percent of the
area each year. The total urban land
area in the basin was about 20 per-
cent at the end of the 10-year study.

Sediment pollution was a problem

in the area because the soils are

highly susceptible to erosion; more-
over, there is sufficient precipitation
to ensure their erosion when con-
struction has removed the vegeta-
tive cover. Most of the sediment is
transported during spring and sum-
mer rainstorms.24 A sediment-
control program was initiated, and
the sediment yield was reduced by
about 35 percent. The program uti-
lized basic sediment-control princi-
ples, such as tailoring development
to the natural topography, exposing
a minimal amount of land, providing
protection for exposed soil, minimiz-
ing surface runoff from critical areas,

and trapping eroded sediment on
construction sites. Speciﬁc measures
included scheduled grading to mini-
mize the time of soil exposure,
mulch application and temporary
vegetation to protect exposed soils,
sediment diversion berms, stabilized
channels, and sediment basins. The
Maryland study concluded that even
further sediment control can be
achieved by both scheduling major
grading during periods of low ero-
sion potential and designing im-
proved sediment traps to control
runoff during storms.24

designed  to  trap  and  control  sediment;
they  must  be  periodically  cleared  out  to
operate  effectively.  A  generalized  cross

shown in Figure 17.14.

FIGURE 17.13 Unwanted sediment Soil erosion has resulted in unwanted

Human activities affect soils by inﬂuenc-

of  surface-water  runoff,  erosion,  and
sedimentation.  The  most  important  of
these human inﬂuences is the conversion
of natural areas to various land uses.

Sediment  pollution affects  rivers,  streams,  lakes,
and  even  the  ocean.  Unfortunately,  the  problem
promises to be with us indeﬁnitely. One solution to
sediment pollution is to implement sound conserva-
tion practices, particularly in urbanizing areas where
tremendous  quantities  of  sediment  are  produced
during construction (see Case History: Reduction of
Sediment Pollution, Maryland). Another solution is

tion  phase  of  urbanization  in  about  1960.  These
data suggest that the effects of land use change on

and erosion. As a result, streams become muddy and
may not be able to transport all the sediment deliv-
ered to them. The channels will, therefore, partially
ﬁll  with  sediment,  or  aggrade,  possibly  increasing
the magnitude and frequency of ﬂooding.

Agriculture
In the past 50 years, soil erosion and overuse of soils
caused by intensive agriculture have damaged about
10 percent of the world’s best agricultural land. It is
estimated that, in the United States, approximately
one-third of the topsoil, the most fertile soil near the

FIGURE 17.16 Contour plowing Contour plowing can signiﬁcantly reduce soil erosion. This

surface  that  supports  vegetation,  has  been  lost  to
erosion.5,25

Traditional  agriculture,  which  involves  plowing
the soil in straight lines, or furrows, is particularly
damaging.  Removal  of  vegetation  exposes  the  soil
to  erosion  by  wind  and  water.  Even  on  gentle
slopes, furrows may channel the water downslope,
increasing the erosion potential. Although new soil
is constantly forming, soils form very slowly, from a
rate of about 1 mm (0.04 in.) in several decades to 
as  much  as  1  mm  (0.04  in.)  per  year.  The  key  to
sustaining  soil  resources  is  to  reduce  erosion  to  a
rate less than the rate at which soils naturally form.
Some practices to sustain soils include:25

• Contour  plowing. This  involves  plowing  with
the natural topography of the land. Furrows are
plowed perpendicular to the slope of the land
rather than in the downslope direction. This is
one  of  the  most  effective  ways  to  reduce  ero-
sion  by  running  water  and  is  widely  used
(Figure 17.16).

• No-till  agriculture. This  system  eliminates
plowing  altogether,  greatly  reducing  soil  ero-
sion. No-till agriculture is an integrated plan to
plant and harvest crops without plowing while
suppressing weeds and other pests.

• Terracing  slopes. Soil  erosion  on  steep  slopes
can  be  managed  and  minimized  by  terracing
slopes  to  produce  ﬂat  areas  for  farming.  Re-
taining  walls  of  stone  or  other  materials  are
used  to  form  terraces  and  stabilize  the  slope.
Terracing is widely used on farms around the
world (Figure 17.17).

• Planting of more than one crop. This method is
most  effective  on  small  farms  in  the  tropical
rain forest and other areas. The forest trees are
cut in small patches of land, and some smaller
trees and plants are left in place. Several crops
are planted among the remaining natural vege-
tation  (Figure  17.18).  After  several  years,  the
land is allowed to recover. When the forest has
grown back, the process may be repeated. This
approach  works  if  human  population  on  the
land is low. With increased population and pres-
sure  to  farm  more  land  more  frequently,  the
practice is not sustainable.

Urbanization
The  conversion  of  agricultural,  forested,  or  rural
land  to  highly  urbanized  land  causes  dramatic
changes. During the construction phase of a conver-
sion,  there  is  a  tremendous  increase  in  sediment

Land Use and Environmental Problems of Soils

resulting  in  a  much  different
soil than was previously there.
• Draining soils to remove water
may  cause  desiccation,  or  dry-
ing out, and other changes in
soil properties.

• Soils in urban areas are suscep-
tible to soil pollution resulting
from deliberate or inadvertent
addition of chemicals to soils.
This problem is particularly se-
rious  if  hazardous  chemicals
have been applied.

Off-Road Vehicles
Urbanization is not the only land
use  that  causes  increased  soil
erosion  and  hydrologic  changes.
In recent years, the popularity of
off-road  vehicles  (ORVs)  has  in-
creased enormously; demand for
recreational areas to pursue this
interest  has  led  to  serious  envi-
ronmental  problems,  as  well  as
conﬂicts between users of public
lands.

There  are  now  millions  of
ORVs,  many  of  which  are  in-
vading 
the  deserts,  coastal
dunes, and forested mountains
of the United States. Problems
associated with ORVs are com-
mon, from the shores of North
Carolina  and  New  York  to  sand
dunes in Michigan and Indiana to
deserts and beaches in the west-
ern  United  States.  A  single  mo-
torcycle  need  travel  only  8  km 
(5  mi)  to  have  an  impact  on 
an  area  measuring  1,000  m2
(10,765  ft2),  and  a  four-wheel-
drive vehicle has an impact over
the same area by traveling only
2.4 km (1.5 mi). In some desert
areas, the tracks produce scars that may remain part
of the landscape for hundreds of years.26,27

The major areas of environmental problems caused
by ORVs are soil erosion, changes in hydrology, and
damage to plants and animals. Off-road vehicles cause
direct  mechanical  erosion  and  facilitate  wind  and
water erosion of materials loosened by their passing

production, which may be accom-
panied by a moderate increase in
runoff (Figures 17.15 and 17.19).
The  response  of  streams  in  the
area  is  complex  and  may  include
both channel erosion and deposi-
tion,  resulting  in  wide,  shallow
channels. The combination of in-
creased runoff and shallow chan-
nels  increases  the  ﬂood  hazard.
After the construction phase, the
land is mostly covered with build-
ings, parking lots, and streets, so
the sediment yield drops to a low
level.  Streams  respond  to  the
lower  sediment  yield  and  higher
runoff by eroding their channels,
which  become  deeper.  However,
because  of  the  large  impervious
areas and the use of storm sewers,
runoff increases, again increasing
the risk of ﬂooding.

The process of urbanization di-
rectly affects soils in several ways:

• Soil may be scraped off and lost. Once sensitive
soils  are  disturbed,  they  may  have  lower
strengths when they are remolded.

• Materials  may  be  brought  in  from  outside
areas  to  ﬁll  a  depression  before  construction,

(Figure 17.20). Runoff from ORV sites is as much as
eight  times  greater  than  for  adjacent,  unused  areas,
and sediment yields are comparable to those found on
construction  sites  in  urbanizing  areas.27 Hydrologic
changes from ORV activity result primarily from near-

surface soil compaction that reduces the ability of the
soil  to  absorb  water.  Furthermore,  water  already  in
the  soil  becomes  more  tightly  held  and,  thus,  less
available to plants and animals. In the Mojave Desert,

impact on the environment. Bicycles have damaged
mountain  meadows,  and  their  intensive  use  con-
tributes  to  trail  erosion  (Figure  17.21).  Mountain
bike users are lobbying to gain entry into even more
locations in the national forests, parks, and wilder-
ness areas. Their position is that one bicycle causes
less erosion than one horse. Although this is gener-
ally true, mountain bikes are cheaper and easier to
maintain  than  horses;  therefore,  there  are  many
more  people  riding  mountain  bikes  than  there  are
riding horses. Thus, the cumulative effect of bicycles
on  trails  may  be  greater  than  that  of  horses.  Also,
hikers and other visitors may not mind seeing ani-
mals such as horses in wilderness areas but may be
less receptive to bicycles, which are fast and almost
silent  (you  can’t  hear  them  coming).  Wilderness
management plans will have to be developed to en-
sure  that  overenthusiastic  people  do  not  damage
sensitive environments.

the compacted soils have not recovered.27 Compaction
also changes the variability of soil temperature. This
effect  is  especially  apparent  near  the  surface,  where
the soil becomes hotter during the day and colder at
night. Animals are killed or displaced, and vegetation
is  damaged  or  destroyed  by  intensive  ORV  activity.
The  damage  results  from  a  combination  of  soil  ero-
sion, compaction, temperature change, and moisture
content change.27

There is little doubt that as a management strat-
egy,  some  land  must  be  set  aside  for  ORV  use.
However, how much land should be involved, and
how  can  environmental  damage  be  minimized?
Sites should be chosen in closed basins with mini-
mal  soil  and  vegetation  variation.  The  possible
effects of erosion by wind must be evaluated care-
fully,  as  must  the  sacriﬁce  of  nonrenewable  cul-
tural, biological, and geologic resources.26 A major
problem remains: Intensive ORV use is incompati-
ble  with  nearly  all  other  land  use,  and  it  is  very
difﬁcult to restrict damages to a speciﬁc site. Mate-
rial  removed  by  mechanical,  water,  and  wind
erosion will always have an impact on other areas
and activities.26,27

In recent years, the demand for self-propelled ve-
hicles has been increasing. Use of off-road mountain
bikes  has  grown  dramatically  and  is  having  an

17.11 Soil Pollution
Soil  pollution  occurs  when  materials  detrimental  to
people  and  other  living  things  are  inadvertently  or
deliberately applied to soils (see Case History: Times
Beach,  Missouri,  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter).
Many types of materials, including organic chemicals,
such as hydrocarbons or pesticides, or heavy metals,
such as selenium, cadmium, nickel, or lead, may act as
soil contaminants. Soils, particularly those with clay
particles, can also act to selectively attract, absorb, or
bind toxins and other materials that otherwise would
contaminate the environment. Soils may also contain
organisms  that  break  down  certain  contaminants
into less harmful materials. As a result, soils offer op-
portunities to reduce environmental pollution. How-
ever, contaminants in soils and the products of their
breakdown by soil and biochemical processes may be
toxic to ecosystems and humans if they become con-
centrated in plants or are transported into the atmos-
phere or water.8

Problems arise when soils intended for uses other
than  waste  disposal  are  contaminated  or  when
people  discover  that  soils  have  been  contaminated
by  previous  uses.  Houses  and  other  structures,
such  as  schools,  have  been  built  over  sites  where
soils have been contaminated. At many sites, conta-

mination from old waste-disposal facilities or from
dumping  of  chemicals  is  now  being  discovered;
some  of  these  sites  are  being  treated.  However,
treatment of soils to remove contaminants can be a
very costly endeavor. Treatments vary from excava-
tion and disposal to incineration or bioremediation.
Often, bioremediation is done on the pollution site
and  does  not  require  excavating  and  moving  large
quantities of contaminated soil (Figure 17.22).8,28
In  recent  years,  soil  and  water  contaminated  by
leaking  underground  tanks  have  become  a  signiﬁ-
cant  environmental  concern.  Businesses  are  now
adding  systems  to  monitor  storage  tanks  so  that
leaks  can  be  detected  before  signiﬁcant  environ-
mental damage occurs.

17.12 Soil Surveys and Land 

Use Planning

The  best  use  of  land  is  greatly  determined  by  its
soils;  therefore,  a  report  called  a  soil  survey is  an
important part of planning for nearly all engineer-
ing projects. A soil survey should include soil descrip-
tions; soil maps showing the horizontal and vertical
extent  of  soils;  and  results  of  tests  to  determine
grain  size,  moisture  content,  and  strength.  The

trients pumped intermittently into the contaminated area and released from the lower slotted pipe. The
upper pipe (also slotted) sucks contaminated air from the soil. The nutrients stimulate the growth of bacteria.
The supply of methane, a carbon source, is then stopped, and the carbon-hungry bacteria go after the inor-
ganic solvents, degrading them to carbon dioxide and water as part of their life cycle. This type of process
can signiﬁcantly reduce the time and cost involved in treating the contaminated soil. (Modiﬁed after Hazen,

purpose of a soil survey is to provide necessary in-
formation  for  identifying  potential  problem  areas
before construction.9

The information from detailed soil maps can be
extremely helpful in land use planning if it is used in

combination  with  guidelines  for  the  proper  use  of
soils.  Soils  can  be  rated  according  to  their  limita-
tions for a speciﬁc land use, such as housing, light
industry,  septic-tank  systems,  roads,  recreation,
agriculture, and forestry.

CHAPTER 17

Soils and Environment

Summary

Engineers deﬁne soil as Earth material
that may be removed without blast-
ing; to a soil scientist, a soil is solid
Earth material that can support
rooted plant life. A basic understand-
ing of soils and their properties is
becoming crucial in several areas of
environmental geology, including
land-use planning, waste disposal, and
evaluation of natural hazards, such as
ﬂooding, landslides, and earthquakes.
Soils result from interactions of the
rock and hydrologic cycles with biogeo-
chemical processes. As open systems,
they are affected by variables, such as
climate, topography, parent material,
time, and biological activity. Soil-
forming processes tend to produce
distinctive soil layers, or horizons,
deﬁned by the processes that formed
them and the type of materials present.
The processes of leaching, oxidation,
and accumulation of materials in vari-
ous soil horizons are particularly im-
portant. Development of the argillic B
horizon, for example, depends on the
translocation of clay minerals from
upper to lower horizons. Three impor-
tant properties of soils are color, tex-
ture or particle size, and structure (i.e.,
the aggregation of particles).

A soil may be considered a complex
ecosystem in which many types of liv-
ing things convert soil nutrients into
forms that plants can use. Soil fertil-
ity is the capacity of soil to supply nu-
trients needed for plant growth. Soils
may go through natural stages of
building, sustaining, and degrading.
Each stage has important implica-
tions for ecosystems.

Soil has a solid phase consisting of

mineral and organic matter; a gas
phase, including mostly air; and a liq-

uid phase, which consists mostly of
water. Water may ﬂow vertically or
laterally through the pores of a soil.
The ﬂow is either saturated, with all
pore space ﬁlled with water, or, more
commonly, unsaturated, with pore
spaces partially ﬁlled with water. Soil
moisture and how water moves
through soils are becoming important
topics in environmental geology.

Several types of soil classiﬁcation

exist, but none of them integrates both
engineering properties and soil
processes. Environmental geologists
must be aware of both the soil-science
classiﬁcation, or soil taxonomy, and the
engineering classiﬁcation, known as
the uniﬁed soil classiﬁcation system.

A basic understanding of the engi-
neering properties of soils is crucial in
many environmental problems. These
properties include soil strength, sen-
sitivity, compressibility, erodibility,
hydraulic conductivity, corrosion po-
tential, ease of excavation, and
shrink–swell potential. Shrink–swell
potential is particularly important be-
cause expansive soils in the United
States cause signiﬁcant environmen-
tal problems and constitute one of
our most costly natural hazards.

Soil erosion is one of our most seri-
ous environmental problems linked to
food supply. Rates of soil erosion can
be determined by direct observation of
soil loss from slopes, by measurement
of accumulated sediment in reservoirs,
or by calculation using an equation. A
common method is to apply the Uni-
versal Soil Loss Equation, which uses
variables that affect erosion to predict
the amount of soil that will be moved
from its original position. These vari-
ables can often be manipulated as part

of a management strategy to minimize
erosion and sediment pollution from a
particular site. Sediment, both natural
and human-made, may be one of our
greatest pollutants. It reduces water
quality and chokes streams, lakes,
reservoirs, and harbors. With good
conservation practices, sediment pol-
lution can be greatly reduced.

Sustaining soils requires that rates

of soil erosion be less than rates of
soil formation. Land use and surface-
water manipulation affect the pattern,
amount, and intensity of surface-water
runoff, soil erosion, and sediment
pollution. In agricultural areas, soil
erosion may be minimized most
effectively by contour plowing, no-till
agriculture, slope terracing, and
planting of more than one crop.

Urbanization often involves loss of

soil, changes of soil properties, accelera-
tion of soil erosion during construction,
and pollution of soils. Use of motorized
and non-motorized off-road vehicles
causes soil erosion, changes in hydrol-
ogy, and damage to plants and animals.

Soil pollution occurs when haz-

ardous materials are inadvertently or
deliberately added to soils. Pollution
limits the usefulness of soils or even
renders them hazardous to life.
Processes in soils may also be useful
in reducing or eliminating contami-
nants from soil. The deliberate use of
soil processes to eliminate contamina-
tion is known as bioremediation.

Soil surveys are extremely useful in

land use planning. Soils can be rated
according to their limitations for vari-
ous land uses. This information can be
combined with a detailed soils map to
produce a simpliﬁed map that shows a
soil’s limitations for a speciﬁc use.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts

resulted in a need for more soil re-

sources to grow food to support our

sulted in an increase in soil and water
pollution from the use of chemical
fertilizers.

Sustainability Sustaining soil re-
sources is one of the fundamental
goals to ensure long-term food pro-
duction in agricultural regions. Of
particular importance is the develop-
ment of plans to minimize soil ero-
sion that results in loss of soil re-
sources and produces sediment
pollution.

Earth as a System Soils are com-
plex ecosystems involving interac-
tions between the hydrologic and
rock cycles and biogeochemical
processes through time. As climate
changes, so do soil-forming
processes, and soils often reﬂect cli-
matic changes that alter patterns of
precipitation and the amount of
solar energy received at the surface
of Earth.

Hazardous Earth Processes,
Risk Assessment, and 
Perception Loss of soil fertility as
a result of soil erosion and other
processes is a serious hazard with re-
spect to our ability to provide food to

feed the people of the world. In addi-
tion, speciﬁc soil hazards exist, in-
cluding the shrink–swell properties of
soils, that may cause damage to roads,
buildings, and other structures.

Scientific Knowledge and 
Values The study of soils is a ma-
ture science, and we have a good un-
derstanding of how soils form, are
eroded, and may be sustained. Pollu-
tion of soils is a serious problem in
agricultural and urban areas. How we
ultimately deal with soil pollution will
reﬂect our values concerning the
rights of people to live in an environ-
ment where soils do not produce
health hazards as a result of pollution.

Soils and Environment

Critical Thinking Questions

1. Defend the statement that soil ero-
sion is an environmental problem
that could seriously damage, or
even cause the collapse of, our civi-

vehicles lead to loss of soil fertility?

3. One of your environmentalist
friends really likes to ride her
mountain bike on steep terrain.

hill on ski slopes during the sum-
mer. What are some conﬂicts she
may have in reconciling her sport
with potential damage to the envi-
ronment?

4. You own a consulting ﬁrm, and a
client hires you to evaluate several
hundred hectares (acres) to start a
small farm to grow organic vegeta-
bles. The land is generally ﬂat, with
some rolling hills. How could you
evaluate the project from a soils
perspective? Outline a general plan
to advise your client.

4Part
Environmental Management,
Global Perspective, and Society

art 4 focuses on environmental geology and its

relationship to society on local, regional, and global scales.
We begin in Chapter 18 with a discussion of global climate
change and present important topics, including (1) tools
for studying global change, (2) Earth’s atmosphere and
climate change, (3) the potential effects of global climate
change, and (4) the hypothesis that human activity causing
emissions of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) is
resulting in global warming. The global mean annual tem-
perature has increased about 0.8°C during the twentieth
century, and from the 1990s to 2010 we experienced some
of the warmest years on record. We conclude that global
warming is occurring, and there is a human component of
the warming produced by burning fossil fuels.

The “capstone” for this fifth edition of Introduction to 

Environmental Geology is a discussion of relationships be-
tween geology, society, and the future. Most professional
geologists interact with society through their work in areas
such as engineering and environmental geology, petro-
leum geology, economic geology, groundwater geology,
geography, education, or research. Our work also has

signiﬁcant links with ecology. Chapter 19 discusses
examples of how geology interacts with society, including
environmental health, air pollution, waste management,
environmental impact analysis, land use planning, and
environmental law. A main conclusion is that if we are
going to achieve sustainability, we need to carefully
consider important links between geologic processes, the
environment, and society. For example, we are just begin-
ning to understand more fully the relationship between
our geologic environment and human health and the
incidence of chronic and acute diseases, including heart
disease and cancer. The subjects of environmental impact
analysis and land use planning are important because our
approach to these subjects reﬂects our commitment to
the environment at all levels. The important ﬁeld of
environmental law is assisting us in problem solving and
mediation rather than confrontation and adversarial
positions when dealing with environmental matters.
Finally, Chapter 19 discusses three important steps
necessary to avoid a potential environmental crisis and
how we might attain sustainability.

Global Climate
Change

Learning Objectives
It is often said that the only certainties in life are death and taxes, but change could also be added to
this short list. We are all interested in changes that will affect us, our families, our society, and the
world. The sorts of changes we might encounter are many—varying from gradual to accelerating,
abrupt, chaotic, and surprising. Some changes will affect our local, regional, or global environment.

One change that affects all of us is global climate change. In this chapter, we will focus on the

following learning objectives:

• Know the tools used for
studying Earth systems
science and global
change

• Understand the science
of climate change and
global warming

• Know some of the

potential impacts of
global warming and how
they might be minimized

• Know how global

climate change is linked
to ozone depletion

Global Climate Change

Case History
What Does Our Recent History Tell Us About Potential Consequences 
of Global Warming?

The famous philosopher George San-
tayana stated in 1905 that “those
that cannot remember the past are
condemned to repeat it.” It is a
matter of debate whether cycles in

human history actually repeat

themselves, but the repetitive

nature of many natural

processes and hazards,

even if they result from
different reasons, are

indisputable. So,
what can we
learn by examin-
ing the past with

reference to
global climate
change and, in
particular,

global warm-
ing? It turns
out that,
over an
approxi-
mately
300-year
period from

A.D. 1000 to
1300, Earth was
considerably warmer

than normal (normal

meaning the average

surface temperature during the past
century or some shorter interval,
such as between 1961 and 1990).
This period is known as the Medieval
Warm Period (MWP), and we can
possibly learn some lessons from
that event. Although the MWP oc-
curred only a few hundred years ago,
we don’t know much about it except
that it was, in fact, warm and per-
haps nearly as warm as our world
today. Most scientists who study the
indicators of past climate state that
it probably wasn’t quite as warm,
but, certainly, parts of the world and,
in particular, Western Europe and
the North Atlantic, may have been
warmer some of the time during the
MWP than in the last decade of the
twentieth century. During the MWP,
there were winners and losers. In
Western Europe, there was a ﬂour-
ishing of culture and activity, as well
as an expansion of the population, as
harvests were plentiful and people
generally prospered. During that
period, many of Europe’s grand
cathedrals were constructed.1–3
Finally, during the MWP, the ﬁrst
global trade routes opened from
Europe to China, connected by favor-
able climate and camel caravans.

During the MWP, sea temperatures

in the North Atlantic evidently were
warmer, and there was less sea ice.
The famous Viking explorer Erik the
Red embarked on a voyage of
exploration near the end of the tenth
century A.D. When he arrived at
Greenland with his ships and people,
they set up settlements that ﬂour-
ished for several hundred years, and
they were able to grow a variety of
crops, including corn, that had never
before been cultivated in Greenland.
They were also able to raise their ani-
mals and, in general, enjoy a prosper-
ous life. During the same warm pe-
riod, Polynesian people in the Paciﬁc,
taking advantage of winds ﬂowing
throughout the Paciﬁc, were able to
sail to and colonize islands over vast
areas of the Paciﬁc, including Hawaii.2
While some prospered in Western

Europe and the Paciﬁc during the
MWP, other cultures were not so for-
tunate. Associated with the warming
period were long, persistent droughts
(as long as human generations) that
appear to have been partially respon-
sible for the collapse of sophisticated
cultures in North America and Cen-
tral America. The collapses were not
sudden but occurred over periods of

18.1 Global Change and Earth

Systems Science: 
An Overview

Preston  Cloud,  a  famous  Earth  scientist  interested
in the history of life on Earth, human impact on the
environment,  and  the  use  of  resources,  proposed
two central goals for Earth sciences:

1. Understand  how  Earth  works  and  how  it  has
evolved from a landscape of barren rock to the

complex  landscape  dominated  by  the  life  we
see today

2. Apply that understanding to better manage

our environment

Cloud’s goals emphasize that our planet is charac-
terized by a complex evolutionary history. Interac-
tions  between  the  atmosphere,  the  oceans,  solid
Earth,  and  the  biosphere  (Figure  18.1,  page  620)
have resulted in the development of a complex and
abundant diversity of landforms—continents, ocean

many decades, and, in some cases, the
people just moved away. These in-
cluded the people living near Mono
Lake on the eastern side of the Sierra
Nevada in California, the Chacoan
People in what is today Chaco Canyon
in New Mexico in the southwestern
United States, and the Maya civiliza-
tion in the Yucatan of southern Mex-
ico and Central America.

Today, we are worried about pre-

sent warming trends. If they continue
and accelerate or increase, we may
again face a prolonged drought in the
southwestern United States, as well
as in other parts of the world, which
may wreak havoc on the ability to
produce the food that the 7 billion
people upon Earth require.2

When the MWP ended, it was fol-

lowed by the Little Ice Age (LIA), which
lasted several hundred years, from
mid-1400 to 1700 A.D. The cooling of
the LIA made it more difﬁcult for peo-
ple in Southeast Asia and Western
Europe. Angkor Wat, with its palace
and temple in Cambodia, was con-
structed in 1181. The region ﬂourished
for several hundred years, as canals and
reservoirs irrigated vast rice ﬁelds. The
water supply from summer monsoon
rains was reliable, and people pros-
pered. With climate change and the
transition to the LIA, monsoon rains
weakened, and water became scarce.
The Angkorian civilization was in
decline by the ﬁfteenth century and
collapsed by the end of the sixteenth

century. The collapse was gradual, and
people left the city, moving to smaller
communities. Why the collapse
occurred is not fully understood, but it
was in part due to the onset of the LIA
and a more volatile climate, with
reduced monsoon rains and drought.
In short, the food supply diminished
as water resources became scarce.2
During the LIA, storms, wet periods,
extremes of heat and cold, and climate
change caused a number of problems.
Some winters were very cold, and, dur-
ing the very cold winter of 1683–1684,
the River Thames in London was
frozen solid for 2 months, and sea ice
extended for kilometers into the North
Sea, closing harbors and signiﬁcantly
restricting shipping. Crop failures
occurred in Western Europe during the
LIA, and the population was devas-
tated by the Black Plague that reached
out into the Atlantic and Iceland by
about A.D. 1400. With the cooling
times, increasing sea ice, and more
environmental stress, trade with
Greenland was restricted. Eventually,
the colonies in North America and
Greenland were mostly abandoned.
Part of the reason for the abandon-
ment in North America and, particu-
larly, in Newfoundland, was that the
Vikings may not have been able to
adapt to the changing conditions, as
did the Inuit peoples living there. As
times became tough, the two cultures
collided, and the Vikings, despite their
ﬁerce reputation, were not as able to

adapt to the changing, cooler times as
were the Inuit.

We do not know what caused the

MWP, and the details about it are
somewhat obscured by the lack of suf-
ﬁcient climate data during that period
with which to estimate temperatures.
We do know that it was warm in West-
ern Europe and the North Atlantic,
and we can’t blame that on the burn-
ing of fossil fuels. What this may sug-
gest is that more than one factor may
cause warming; the present warming,
for the most part, is clearly the result
of the emissions of carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere from burning
fossil fuels and land use changes. Per-
haps a lesson for us is that changes in
the most recent past warming (MWP)
had winners and losers. Today, the
world population is 7 billion, and
half of us live in cities. The world 
population during the MWP was 
about 500 million, and agriculture 
was blooming. However, persistent
droughts during the MWP apparently
caused pain and suffering over much
of the semiarid areas of the world, from
coastal California to the southwestern
United States, as well as Central and
South America. This is a red ﬂag! The
potential effects of prolonged, persis-
tent drought and loss of food produc-
tion for the world, if present warming
continues, is a serious threat, and we
will explore this, along with other 
aspects of present warming trends,
throughout this chapter.

basins,  mountains,  lakes,  plains,  and  slopes—as
well as the abundant and diverse life-forms that in-
habit a broad spectrum of habitats.

Until recently, it was thought that human activity
caused only local or, at most, regional environmental
change. It is now generally recognized that the effects
of human activity on Earth are so extensive that we
are actually involved in an unplanned planetary exper-
iment. To recognize and perhaps modify the changes
we have initiated, we need to understand how the en-
tire  Earth  works  as  a  system.  The  discipline,  called

Earth  systems  science,  seeks  to  further  this  under-
standing  by  learning  how  the  various  components 
of  the  system—the  atmosphere,  oceans,  land,  and
biosphere—are linked on a global scale and interact to
affect  life  on  Earth.4 In  the  following  sections,  we’ll
look at some tools for studying change.

The Geologic Record
Sediments  deposited  on  ﬂoodplains  or  in  lakes,
bogs, glaciers, or the ocean may be compared to the

pages  of  a  history  book.  Organic  material  that  is
often  deposited  with  sediment  may  be  dated  by
using a variety of methods to provide a chronology.
In addition, the organic material can tell a story con-
cerning the past climate, life-forms in the area, and
environmental  changes  that  have  taken  place.
Ocean sediments are sampled by drilling from a ship
or on an ice shelf and extracting a core several cen-
timeters  in  diameter  that  may  be  a  few  hundred
meters to over 1,000 m long (Figure 18.2). On land,
sediment may be sampled by drilling or trenching or
from a natural exposure.

FIGURE 18.3 Ice core Collecting an ice core in 2005 on the
Greenland Ice Cap for examination of the climate record it
contains. (Alfred Wagner Institute for Polar and Marine Research)

One of the most signiﬁcant uses of the geologic
record  has  been  the  examination  of  glacial  ice.
Glacial ice contains trapped air bubbles that may be
analyzed to provide information concerning atmos-
pheric  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  and  methane  (CH4)
concentrations when the ice formed. These trapped
air bubbles are atmospheric time capsules from the
past and have been used to analyze the carbon diox-
ide  content  of  air  as  old  as  800,000  years.5 The
method of studying the glacial record is to drill the
ice  and  extract  an  ice  core,  which  can  be  sampled
(Figure  18.3).6 Glaciers  also  contain  a  record  of
heavy metals, such as lead, that settle out of the at-
mosphere,  as  well  as  a  variety  of  other  chemicals
that can be used to study recent Earth history.

The geologic record is the primary source of data
and evidence for understanding Earth’s history and
changing  environment.  Without  ice  cores  and  lay-
ered sediment, we would know little about long-term
change or be able to put the change in the context of
what is changing today.

Real-Time Monitoring
Monitoring is the regular collection of data for a spe-
ciﬁc purpose; real-time monitoring refers to collect-
ing these data while a process is actually occurring.
For example, we often monitor the ﬂow of water in
rivers to evaluate water resources or ﬂood hazard. In
a similar way, samples of atmospheric gases can help
establish  trends  or  changes  in  the  composition  of

Global Change and Earth Systems Science: An Overview

the atmosphere; measurements of temperature and
the composition of the ocean are also used to exam-
ine  changes  within  them.  Gathering  of  real-time
data is necessary for testing models and for calibrat-

ing the extended prehistoric record derived from ge-
ologic data.

Methods of monitoring vary with the subject being
measured. For example, the impacts from mining may
be monitored by evaluating remotely sensed data col-
lected  by  using  satellite  or  high-altitude  aerial  pho-
tographs.  However,  the  most  reliable  data  are  often
derived from ground measurements that establish the
validity of the airborne or satellite measurements.

Mathematical Models
Mathematical models use numerical means to rep-
resent real-world phenomena and the linkages and
interactions between the processes involved. Math-
ematical models have been developed to predict the
ﬂow of surface water and groundwater, erosion and
deposition  of  sediment  in  river  systems,  ocean
circulation, and atmospheric circulation.

The  global  change  models that  have  gained  the
most attention are the climate models. These models
predict  changes  in  climate  on  a  global  scale.7 Data
used in the calculations are arranged into large cells
that represent several degrees of latitude and longi-
tude; a cell typically represents an area about the size
of Oregon (Figure 18.4). In addition, there are usually
6 to 20 levels of vertical cells representing the lower

major  atmospheric  processes  are  then  used  to  make
predictions.

There is growing conﬁdence that climate models
provide believable quantitative estimates of known
past and predicted future climate change.7 An ex-
ample  of  observed  versus  predicted  change  is
shown  in  Figure  18.4b.  The  models  are  based  on
physical  principles  (e.g.,  conservation  of  energy

and mass) that are used to produce a mathematical
representation of Earth’s climate system, deﬁned
as  the  system  consisting  of  the  atmosphere,  hy-
drosphere, land surface, biosphere, and cryosphere
(i.e.,  ice,  snow,  and  frozen  ground),  which  are
linked and often interact with each other in com-
plex  ways.  Before  discussing  climate  change  fur-
ther,  we  need  a  basic  understanding  of  Earth’s
climate and atmosphere.

18.2 Earth’s Climate 
and Atmosphere

We deﬁne climate as the characteristic atmospheric
conditions—that  is,  the  weather—at  a  particular
place  or  region  over  time  periods  from  seasons  to
years to decades. The climate at a particular location
may  be  complex  and  consist  of  more  than  average
precipitation and temperature. For example, it may
be  dependent  on  infrequent  or  extreme  seasonal
patterns,  such  as  rain  in  the  monsoon  season  of
parts  of  India.  The  major  climatic  zones  on  Earth
are shown in Figure 18.5a. Selected processes and
changes that produce and maintain the climate sys-
tem are shown in Figure 18.5b.

Global circulation and movement of air masses in
the atmosphere (Figure 18.6) produce the major cli-
matic  zones.  Warm  tropical  air  near  the  equator
rises and moves north and south, descending in the
midlatitudes  (sometimes  producing  deserts).  The
air then rises again at higher latitudes and descends

at  the  poles.  There  are  three  cells  of  circulation
(called  Hadley  cells,  named  after  George  Hadley,
who ﬁrst described them) in each hemisphere. Sim-
pliﬁed, warm air rises at the equator and moves to-
ward  the  poles,  where  it  sinks  after  going  through
cell 2 (see Figure 18.6), and return ﬂow is along the
surface toward the equator.

The lower, active part of the atmosphere, where
weather  occurs,  is  the  troposphere.  The  structure
of  the  atmosphere  is  shown  in  Figure  18.7  (page
625). Air temperature and concentration of oxygen
decrease  with  altitude  in  the  troposphere.  At  the
top  of  the  troposphere,  at  an  altitude  that  varies
from  about  18  km  at  the  tropics  to  7  km  at  the
poles, it is very cold, and the temperature remains
nearly  constant  for  a  few  kilometers  through  the
tropopause.  The  constant  temperature  with  little
air  movement  places  a  lid  on  the  active  lower  at-
mosphere (i.e., troposphere). Temperature then in-
creases  in  the  stratosphere,  only  to  decline  again
in  the  mesosphere.  Nearly  all  (99  percent)  of  the

FIGURE 18.6 Atmospheric circulation Global circulation of the lower atmosphere, showing zones of rising
and descending air masses. Heating of Earth’s surface is uneven, producing differences in air pressure because cool air
is denser than warm air. Warm air rises at the equator, and cool air sinks at the poles. As Earth rotates, three cells of
circulating air (called Hadley cells, after George Hadley, who ﬁrst proposed them) form in each hemisphere.

The Atmosphere
Our  atmosphere  can  be  thought  of  as  a  complex
chemical  factory  with  many  little-understood  reac-
tions taking place within it. Many of the reactions
that  take  place  are  strongly  inﬂuenced  by  both
sunlight  and  the  compounds  produced  by  life.  The
air we breathe is (by volume) a mixture of nitrogen
(N2) (78 percent), oxygen (O2) (21 percent), argon (Ar)
(0.9  percent),  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  (0.03  percent),
and other trace elements (less than 0.07 percent). It
also contains compounds such as methane, ozone,
carbon  monoxide,  oxides  of  nitrogen  and  sulfur,
hydrogen sulﬁde, hydrocarbons, and various partic-
ulates,  many  of  which  are  common  air  pollutants.
The most variable part of the atmosphere’s compo-
sition is water vapor (H2O), which can range from

approximately 0 percent to 4 percent by volume in
the lower atmosphere.

With  this  brief  introduction  to  the  atmosphere
and climate, we will now introduce the greenhouse
effect (which is an atmospheric effect) followed by
discussion of how we study past climate and human-
induced global warming in terms of the history and
process of global temperature change.

18.3 The Greenhouse Effect
For the most part, the temperature of Earth is de-
termined  by  three  factors:  the  amount  of  sunlight
Earth  receives,  the  amount  of  sunlight  Earth  re-
ﬂects (and, therefore, does not absorb), and atmos-
pheric  retention  of  reradiated  heat.7 Figure  18.8
(page  626) shows the basics of Earth’s energy bal-
ance, which represents the equilibrium between in-
coming and outgoing energy.

Earth’s energy balance today is slightly out of equi-
librium,  with  about  1  W/m2 more  energy  coming
from the Sun than is lost to space. The energy we are
talking about, W/m2, is energy per unit time (joules/
sec)  per  unit  area  (m2).  The  units  /m2 represent
power per unit area, but we speak of it as solar en-
ergy. The units/m2 are widely used in global warm-
ing and climate change research.6–8,

Earth receives energy from the Sun in the form
of electromagnetic radiation. The various types of
electromagnetic energy are shown in Figure 18.9
(page  627).  Radiation  from  the  Sun  is  relatively
short  wave  and  mostly  visible,  whereas  Earth

radiates  relatively  long-wave  infrared  radiation
(Figure  18.10,  page  628).  The  hotter  an  object,
whether it is the Sun, Earth, a rock, or a lake, the
more  electromagnetic  energy  it  emits.  The  Sun,
with a surface temperature of 5,526°C (10,472°F),
radiates  much  more  energy  per  unit  area  than
does  Earth,  which  has  an  average  near  surface
temperature of 15°C (59°F).

Absorbed solar energy warms Earth’s atmosphere
and surface, which then reradiate the energy back into
space  as  infrared  radiation.7 Water  vapor  and  sev-
eral other atmospheric gases—including carbon diox-
ide  (CO2),  methane  (CH4),  and  chloroﬂuorocarbons

FIGURE 18.8 Annual energy flow to Earth from the Sun The relatively small component of heat from Earth’s interior to the
near-surface environment is shown. Over the past 50 years, incoming solar energy per unit time per unit area (W/m2) has exceeded
outgoing solar energy by about 1 W/m2. (Modiﬁed after Pruitt, N. L., Underwood, L. S., and Surver, W. 1999. BioInquiry, Learning System 1.0,

(CFCs) (i.e., human-made chemicals used in air con-
ditioners  and  refrigerators)—tend  to  trap  heat.
That  is,  they  absorb  some  of  the  energy  radiating
from Earth’s surface and are thereby warmed. As a
result,  the  lower  atmosphere  of  Earth  is  about
40°C warmer than it would be if all of its radiation
escaped  into  space  without  this  intermediate  ab-
sorption  and  warming.  This  effect  is  somewhat
analogous to the trapping of heat by a greenhouse
and  is  therefore  referred  to  as  the  greenhouse
effect (Figure 18.11, page 628).

It  is  important  to  understand  that  the  green-
house effect is a natural phenomenon that has been
occurring for millions of years on Earth, as well as
on other planets in our solar system. Without heat
trapped  in  the  atmosphere,  Earth  would  be  much

colder than it is now, and all surface water would be
frozen. Most of the natural “greenhouse warming”
is due to water vapor and small particles of water in
the  atmosphere.  However,  potential  global  warm-
ing  due  to  human  activity  is  related  to  carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides, and chloroﬂuo-
rocarbons. In recent years, the atmospheric concen-
trations  of  these  gases  and  others  have  been
increasing because of human activities. These gases
tend to absorb infrared radiation from Earth, and it
has  been  hypothesized  that  Earth  is  warming  be-
cause of the increases in the amounts of these so-
called greenhouse gases. With our understanding of
Earth  system  science,  climate,  and  atmospheric
processes, we are ready to discuss how we study cli-
mate change.

to  the  oceans,  to  hemispheres,  and  to  the  entire
planet. There are three main time periods for which
data are available:9

• The instrumental record. Starting about 1860,
measurements  of  temperatures  have  been
made  at  various  locations  on  land  and  in  the
oceans. This is the data shown in Figure 18.12
(page  629).  The  earliest  records  are  from  the
late  seventeenth  and  early  eighteenth  cen-
turies, and the network of stations has signiﬁ-
cantly 
increased  over  time.  About  1,000
individual, but variable, records exist from the
late nineteenth century. Today, temperature is
measured (monitored at short time intervals)
at about 7,000 stations around the world. The
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmos-
phere  has  been  measured  since  about  1960.
Accurate  measurements  of  the  production  of
solar energy have been taken over the past sev-
eral decades.

• The  historical  record. A  variety  of  historical
records go back several hundred years. Includ-
ed  are  people’s  written  recollections  (e.g.,
books,  newspapers,  journal  articles,  personal
journals) of the Medieval Warm Period and the
Little Ice Age, as well as ships’ logs, travelers’
diaries,  and  farmers’  crop  records.  These  are
not generally quantitative data, but they con-
tain qualitative information about the climate
of the past.

• The  paleo-proxy  record. The 

instrumental
record is short, and most of the historical in-
formation is not quantitative. As a result, there
has been a need for extending the record back
further.  Paleoclimatology  (i.e.,  the  study  of
past climate) is part of Earth science. It is clear
that the paleo record of Earth climate has pro-
vided  some  of  the  strongest  data  to  support
and test theories of recent climate change. The
term  proxy  data refers  to  data  that  are  not
strictly climatic but that can be correlated with
climate, such as temperature of the land or sea.

Energy input (warms Earth’s surface)
Close to a third of the energy that descends
on the Earth from the Sun is reflected (scattered)
back into space. The bulk of the remaining
incoming visible solar radiation is absorbed
by the Earth’s surface, heating it.

Energy output (warms Earth’s atmosphere) 
The atmosphere transmits outgoing infrared radiation
from the surface. Most of the outgoing radiation, after
many scatterings, absorptions, and re-emissions, is
emitted from levels near the top of the atmosphere.
Most of this radiation originates at the Earth's surface,
and the bulk of it is absorbed by greenhouse gases at
heights on the order of 100 m. By various atmospheric
energy exchange mechanisms, this radiation diffuses
to the top of the troposphere where it is finally emitted
to outer space. There is a very small imbalance of the 
Earth’s energy balance today (more solar energy arrives 
at Earth than leaves) of about 1 W/m2 (due to 
greenhouse gases), and this warms the atmosphere and 
oceans and melts glaciers.

the best direct record of change before the his-
torical and instrumental periods.

We  have  previously  discussed  (in  Section  18.2)
sediment cores and ice cores, and we will now con-
sider  other  paleo-proxy  data:  tree  rings,  pollen,
corals, carbon-14, carbon dioxide, and methane.

Tree  Rings. The  growth  of  trees  is  inﬂuenced  by
climatic  conditions,  such  as  the  amount  and  vari-
ability of rainfall. Most trees put on one growth ring
per  year,  and  the  width  and  density  and  isotopic
composition  of  annual  rings  provides  information
about  the  variability  of  the  past  climate.  Tree  ring
chronology, known as dendrochronology, has produced
a  proxy  record  of  climate  that  extends  back  over
10,000 years (Figure 18.13).

Pollen. Pollen  (from  ﬂowers,  trees,  and  other
plants), along with other sediment, accumulates in a
variety  of  environments,  including  oceans,  bogs,
and lakes. Scientists study the abundance and types
of pollen in order to investigate past climate. For ex-
ample, if the climate cools, there will be a change in
the assemblage of pollen in sediments that reﬂects
the change in climate. If pollen is found in sufﬁcient
quantity, it may be dated, and, since the grains are
preserved in sedimentary layers that also might be

dated, a chronology can be developed. Based on the
types of plants found at different times, the climatic
history can be reconstructed.

Corals. Coral reefs consists of corals (and other or-
ganisms) that have hard skeletons composed of cal-
cium  carbonate  (CaCO3)  extracted  by  the  corals
from the seawater. The calcium carbonate contains
isotopes of oxygen, as well as a variety of trace met-
als, that can be used to estimate the temperature of
the water that the coral grew in. Thus, corals are a
source of paleo-proxy data that can help us to inter-
pret  climate  change.  Corals  may  be  dated  by  using
several  dating  techniques,  and  a  chronology  of
change over time may be constructed.

Carbon-14. The  production  of  14C  produced  in
the  upper  atmosphere  is  caused  by  collisions  be-
tween neutrons and nitrogen-14 (14N). The nitro-
gen is part of what are called cosmic rays that come
from outer space and are a product of the energy
from the sun. Solar activity can be observed from
the  frequency  of  sunspots,  which  are  called  spots
because they are observed as dark areas on the sun,
surrounded by lighter areas. As sunspot activity in-
creases,  the  energy  from  the  sun  that  reaches
Earth  also  increases.  The  frequency  of  sunspots
has been observed by people for about 1,000 years
and  accurately  measured  for  decades.  When
sunspot activity is high, there is an associated solar
wind,  which  produces  ionized  particles  consisting
predominately  of  protons  and  electrons,  emanat-
ing  from  the  sun.  The  solar  wind  reﬂects  cosmic
rays  (including  nitrogen-12,  12N).  As  a  result,  the
amount of 14C is reduced. The record of 14C in the
atmosphere  is  correlated  to  tree  ring  chronology
(discussed earlier). Each ring of wood of known age
contains  carbon,  and  the  amount  of  14C  can  be
measured.  If  the  climatic  record  for  a  period  of
time is known, it may be correlated with 14C. Thus,
we  can  examine  solar  energy  output,  extending
back thousands of years, by studying tree rings and
the  carbon-14  they  contain.  Based  upon  the  14C
record and its link to solar energy, it appears that
the production of solar energy was slightly higher
around  A.D. 1000,  during  the  Medieval  Warm
Period, and was slightly lower during the Little Ice
Age  from  about  A.D. 1400  to  1800.  The  effect  of
solar  radiation  on  recent  climate  change  (during
the  instrumental  record)  can  account  for  a  small

variability  of  solar  energy  is  not  sufﬁcient  to  ex-
plain the warming since about 1960.

Carbon  Dioxide. The  concentration  of  global
carbon  dioxide  in  the  atmosphere  is  a  proxy  for
global  temperature  change;  it  is  arguably  the  most
important proxy in the study of past climate. There
are carbon dioxide measurements from the instru-
mental record since about 1960 (Figure 18.14), and
these  have  been  extended  back  through  the  mea-
surements  from  trapped  air  in  glaciers  to  about
800,000 years ago (see Figure 18.15).10

Methane. The concentration of methane in the at-
mosphere is a proxy for global temperature change,
arguably one of the most important proxies in the
study  of  past  climate.  Methane  measurements  ex-
tend back about 800,000 years, with measurements
from trapped air in glaciers (Figure 18.15).10

With  a  better  understanding  of  atmospheric
processes and how we can study past climate, we now
turn  to  global  warming,  which  is  often  considered
one of our most signiﬁcant environmental concerns.

18.5 Global Warming
Global  warming is  defined  as  the  observed  in-
crease  in  the  average  temperature  of  the  near-
surface land and ocean environments of Earth. We
are particularly interested in warming in the past

100  years  because  a  growing  volume  of  evidence
suggests  that  we  are  now  in  a  period  of  global
warming resulting from burning vast amounts of
fossil fuels linked to the greenhouse effect. Does
this  mean  we  are  experiencing  human-induced
global  warming?  Many  scientists  now  believe
that  human  processes  in  the  past  100  years,  as
well as natural ones over geologic time, have con-
tributed  significantly  to  global  warming.6,7 We
will  begin  our  discussion  by  examining  the  link
between  the  greenhouse  effect  and  emissions  of
greenhouse gases.

Recent global warming is believed to be due in
a  large  part  to  human  emissions  of  greenhouse
gases,  such  as  carbon  dioxide,  methane,  nitrogen
oxides,  and  chloroﬂuorocarbons.  Figure  18.16
shows  the  increase  in  greenhouse  gases  over  the
past 2,000 years. Notice the very rapid rise in the
past 100 years.

In recent years, the atmospheric concentrations
of  greenhouse  gases  and  other  gases  that  absorb
infrared radiation from Earth or are transformed to
others  that  do  have  been  increasing.  Since  1990,
U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide have increased by

632

about 14 percent. Over the same period, U.S. emis-
sions  of  methane  decreased  by  about  7.5  percent,
and nitrous oxide emissions decreased by about
4 percent. In 2008, the United States emitted about
7 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases. Of these,
based on equivalent amount of the global warming
potential  (GWP),  carbon  dioxide  accounted  for
85.1  percent,  methane  8.2  percent,  nitrous  oxide
4.6  percent,  and  chloroﬂuorocarbons  2.2  percent.
The  GWP  is  a  weighted  value  where  the  warming
potential of a greenhouse gas is compared as a ratio
to that of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is assigned
a GWP of 1, methane is 21, and nitrous oxide 310.
This means that molecule-by-molecule, methane is
a more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon diox-
ide by a factor of 21 times. About 60 percent of the
total  human-caused  (i.e.,  anthropogenic)  green-
house effect is from carbon dioxide because carbon
dioxide  accounts  for  the  vast  majority  of  total
greenhouse gas emissions. World emissions of car-
bon dioxide in 2008 were about 30.4 billion metric
tons,  of  which  about  19  percent  were  from  the
United States.11

Measurements  of  carbon  dioxide  trapped  in  air
bubbles of the Antarctic ice sheet suggest that, dur-
ing most of the past 800,000 years, the atmospheric
concentration  of  carbon  dioxide  has  varied  from  a
little  less  than  200  ppm  to  about  300  ppm.7 The
highest levels are recorded during major interglacial

periods that occurred approximately 125,000 years
ago  and  at  the  present  (Figures  18.15 and  18.17).
Major  interglacial  periods  have  occurred  about
eight times during the past 800,000 years—about
every 100,000 years. During each of these periods,
the  concentration  of  CO2 in  the  atmosphere  was
similar  to  that  of  the  most  recent  interglacial
event, about 125,000 years ago.12 At the beginning
of the Industrial Revolution, the atmospheric con-
centration  of  carbon  dioxide  was  approximately
280 ppm. Since 1860, fossil fuel burning has con-
tributed to the exponential growth of the concen-
tration  of  carbon  dioxide  in  the  atmosphere.  The
concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
today exceeds 390 ppm, and it is predicted to reach
at least 450 ppm—more than 1.5 times the prein-
dustrial level—by 2050.

Global Temperature Change
The Pleistocene ice ages began approximately 2.6
million years ago, and, since then, there have been
numerous  changes  in  Earth’s  mean  annual  tem-
perature.  Figure  18.18 shows  the  changes  of  ap-
proximately the past million years on several time
scales.  The  first  scale  shows  the  entire  million
years  (Figure  18.18a),  during  which  there  have
been  major  climatic  changes  involving  swings  of
several degrees Celsius in mean temperature. Low

CHAPTER 18

Global Climate Change

temperatures  have  coincided  with  major  glacial
events  that  have  greatly  altered  the  landscape;
high temperatures are associated with interglacial
conditions. Interglacial and glacial events become
increasingly  prominent  in  the  scales,  showing
changes over 150,000 and 18,000 years. The last
major interglacial warm period, even warmer than
today,  was  the  Eemian  (Figure  18.18b).  During
the  Eemian,  sea  level  was  a  few  meters  higher
than  it  is  today.  The  cold  period  that  occurred
about  11,500  years  ago  is  known  as  the  Younger
Dryas, followed by rapid warming to the Holocene
maximum,  which  preceded  the  Little  Ice  Age
(Figure 18.18c).

A  scale  of  1,000  years  shows  several  warming
and  cooling  trends  that  have  affected  people
(Figure  18.18d).  For  example,  a  major  warming
trend  from  approximately  A.D. 1100–1300  allowed
the  Vikings  to  colonize  Iceland,  Greenland,  and
northern  North  America.  When  glaciers  made  a
minor advance around A.D. 1400, during a cold pe-
riod known as the Little Ice Age, the Viking settle-
ments  in  North  America  and  parts  of  Greenland
were abandoned.

In  approximately  1750,  an  apparent  warming
trend  began  that  lasted  until  approximately  the
1940s,  when  temperatures  cooled  slightly.  Over
the past 140 years, more changes are apparent, and
the 1940s event is clearer (Figure 18.18e). It is evi-
dent  from  the  record  that,  in  the  past  100  years,
global mean annual temperature has increased by
approximately  0.8°C  (1.4°F).  Most  of  the  increase
has been since the 1970s, and the 1990s and ﬁrst 
8 years of the twenty-ﬁrst century had the warmest
temperatures since global temperatures have been
monitored.7,13 This period may become known as
the  early  twenty-ﬁrst  century  increase  in  global
temperature.  Table  18.1 lists  evidence  of  the  re-
cent warming.

Why Does Climate Change?
The question that begs to be answered is: Why does
climate  change?  Examination  of  Figure  18.18 sug-
gests that there are cycles of change lasting 100,000
years,  separated  by  shorter  cycles  of  20,000  to
40,000  years.  These  cycles  were  ﬁrst  identiﬁed  by
Milutin Milankovitch in the 1920s as a hypothesis

to  explain  climate  change.  Milankovitch  realized
that the spinning Earth is like a wobbling top, un-
able  to  keep  a  constant  position  in  relationship  to
the  Sun;  this  instability  partially  determines  the
amount  of  sunlight  reaching  and  warming  Earth.
Milankovitch  discovered  that  variability  in  Earth’s
orbit  around  the  Sun  follows  a  100,000-year  cycle
that  is  correlated  with  the  major  glacial  and  inter-
glacial periods shown on Figure 18.18a. Earth’s orbit
varies very slightly from a nearly circular ellipse to a
more elongated ellipse. Over the 100,000-year cycle
of Earth, when the orbit is most elliptical, solar radi-
ation reaching Earth is greater than during a more
circular  orbit.  Cycles  of  approximately  40,000  and
20,000  years  result  from  changes  in  the  tilt  and
wobble  of  Earth’s  axis,  respectively.  Milankovitch
cycles reproduce  most  of  the  long-term  cycles  ob-
served  in  the  climate,  and  they  have  a  signiﬁcant
effect on climate. However, the cycles are not sufﬁ-
cient  to  produce  the  observed  large-scale  global
climatic changes. Therefore, these cycles, along with
other processes, must be invoked to explain global
climatic change. Thus, the Milankovitch cycles that
force  (i.e.,  push)  the  climate  in  one  direction  or
another can be looked at as natural processes (i.e.,
forcing)  that,  when  linked  to  other  processes,  pro-
duce climatic change.14,15 We now will consider this
forcing concept in more detail.

Climate  forcing is  defined  as  an  imposed
change of Earth’s energy balance. The units for the
forcing are W/m2 and can be positive if a particu-
lar  forcing  increases  global  mean  temperature  or
negative if temperature is decreased. For example,
if  the  energy  from  the  Sun  increases,  then  Earth
will warm (this is positive climate forcing). If CO2
decreases, causing Earth to cool, that is an exam-
ple of negative climate forcing.15 Climate sensitiv-
ity refers  to  the  response  of  climate  to  a  specific
climate  forcing  after  a  new  equilibrium  has  been
established,  and  the  time  required  for  the  re-
sponse to a forcing to occur is the climate response
time.16 A significant implication of climate forcing
is that, if small climate forcing is maintained for
a  long  enough  time,  large  climate  change  can
occur.12 Figure  18.19  shows  the  climate  forcing
that produced the last major ice age 22,000 years
ago (i.e., the last glacial maximum).6,16 Notice that
1  W/m2 produces  a  temperature  change  of  about
0.75°C.  Climate  forcing  in  the  industrial  age  is

Global Warming

TABLE 18.1 Evidence Supporting the Early Twenty-First Century Rise in Global Temperature

Warming since the mid-1970s has been about three times as rapid as in the preceding century.

The decade from 2000 to 2009 was the warmest decade on record since measurements have been taken (the instrumental
period) and the past 1,000 years, according to geologic data.

The warmest year on record was 2005, with 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2009 virtually tied for second. The year 2010, when the
data has been analyzed, will likely be the warmest on record.

In 2003, the United States was cooler and wetter than average in much of the eastern part of the country, and it was warmer
and drier in much of the west. Ten western states were much warmer than average; New Mexico had its warmest year. Alaska
was warmer in all four seasons and had one of its 5 warmest years since the state began taking measurements in 1918.

Europe, in 2003, experienced summer heat waves, with the warmest seasonal temperatures ever recorded in Spain, France,
Switzerland, and Germany. Approximately 15,000 people died in heat waves in Paris during the summer.

Warm conditions, along with drought, in 2003 contributed to severe wildﬁres in Australia, southern California, and British
Columbia, Canada.

2008 was the coolest year since 2000, but it was still the tenth-warmest year since 1880. The 11 warmest years on record have
occurred during the 13-year period from 1997 to 2009.

Since 1965, the average temperature of Earth at the surface has increased about 0.2°C per decade.6,7

Note: A few years of high temperatures with drought, heat waves, and wildﬁres are not by themselves an indication of longer-term global warming. The persistent
trend of increasing temperatures over several decades is more compelling evidence that global warming is real and happening.

We  now  believe  that  our  climate  system
may  be  inherently  unstable  and  capable  of
changing quickly from one state to another
in as short a time as a few decades.17 How-
ever, very short or abrupt climate change is
unlikely. Part of what may drive the climate
system  and  its  potential  to  change  is  the
ocean conveyor belt, a global-scale circulation
of  ocean  waters  characterized  by  strong
northward movement of 12° to 13°C (53° to
55°F)  near-surface  waters  in  the  Atlantic
Ocean  that  are  cooled  to  2°  to  4°C  (35°  to
39°F)  when  they  arrive  near  Greenland
(Figure  18.21,  page  637).17 As  the  water
cools,  it  becomes  saltier;  the  increase  in
salinity  and  cooler  water  increases  the
water’s density and causes it to sink to the
bottom.  The  current  then  ﬂows  southward
around  Africa,  adjoining  the  global  pattern
of ocean currents. The ﬂow in this conveyor
belt  current  is  huge,  equal  to  about  100  Amazon
Rivers.  The  amount  of  warm  water  and  heat  re-
leased to the atmosphere, along with the stronger
effect  of  relatively  warm  winter  air  moving  east
and  northeast  across  the  Atlantic  Ocean,  is  sufﬁ-
cient to keep Northern Europe 5° to 10°C (8.5° to

Increases of greenhouse gases (except O3) are known from observations and bubbles of air trapped 
in ice sheets. The increase of CO2 from 285 parts per million (ppm) in 1850 to 368 ppm in 2000 is 
accurate to about 5 ppm. The conversion of this gas change to a climate forcing (1.4 W/m2), from 
calculation of the infrared opacity, adds about 10% to the uncertainty.

Increase of CH4 since 1850, including its effect on stratospheric H2O and tropospheric O3, causes a 
climate forcing about half as large as that by CO2. Main sources of CH4 include landfills, coal 
mining, leaky natural gas lines, increasing ruminant (cow) population, rice cultivation, and waste 
management. Growth rate of CH4 has slowed in recent years.

Tropospheric O3 is increasing. The U.S. and Europe have reduced O3 precursor emissions 
(hydrocarbons) in recent years, but increased emissions are occurring in the developing world.

Black carbon (”soot”), a product of incomplete combustion, is visible in the exhaust of diesel-fueled 
trucks. It is also produced by biofuels and outdoor biomass burning. Black carbon aerosols are not 
well measured, and their climate forcing is estimated from measurements of total aerosol absorption. 
The forcing includes the effect of soot in reducing the reflectance of snow and ice.

Human-made reflective aerosols include sulfates, nitrates, organic carbon, and soil dust. Sources 
include burning fossil fuel and agricultural activities. Uncertainty in the forcing by reflective aerosols is 
at least 35%.

Indirect effects of aerosols on cloud properties are difficult to compute, but satellite measurements of 
the correlation of aerosol and cloud properties are consistent with the estimated net forcing of –1 
W/m2, with uncertainty of at least 50%.

17°F)  warmer  than  it  would  otherwise  be.  If  the
conveyor belt were to shut down, it would have an
effect  on  the  climate  of  Europe.  However,  the  ef-
fect  would  not  be  catastrophic  to  England  and
France in terms of producing extreme cold and ice-
bound conditions.18

Although scientific uncertainties exist, there is
sufficient evidence to state that (1) there is a dis-
cernible  human  influence  on  global  climate;  (2)
warming is now occurring; and (3) the mean sur-
face  temperature  of  Earth  will  likely  increase  by
1.5°  to  4.5°C  (2.6°  to  7.8°F)  during  the  twenty-
first century.6,7 The human-induced component of

global  warming  results  from  increased  emissions
of gases that tend to trap heat in the atmosphere.
There  is  good  reason  to  argue  that  increases  in
carbon  dioxide  and  other  greenhouse  gases  are
related to an increase in the mean global tempera-
ture  of  Earth.  Over  the  past  few  hundred  thou-
sand  years,  there  has  been  a  strong  correlation
between  the  concentration  of  atmospheric  CO2
and global temperature (Figure 18.15). When CO2
has  been  high,  temperature  has  also  been  high,
and,  conversely,  low  concentrations  of  CO2 have
been  correlated  with  a  low  global  temperature.
However,  in  order  to  better  understand  global

FIGURE 18.21 Ocean conveyor belt Idealized diagram of the ocean conveyor belt. The
actual system is more complex, but, in general, warm surface water (red) is transported west-
ward and northward (increasing in salinity owing to evaporation) to near Greenland, where it
cools from contact with cold Canadian air. As the water increases in density, it sinks to the bot-
tom and ﬂows south, then east to the Paciﬁc, where upwelling occurs. The masses of sinking
and upwelling waters balance, and the total ﬂow rate is about 20 million m3 (700 million ft3) per
second. The heat released to the atmosphere from the warm water helps keep Northern Europe
warmer than it would be if the oceanic conveyor belt were not present. (Modiﬁed after Broecker,

Volcanic Forcing
Upon  eruption,  volcanoes  can
hurl  vast  amounts  of  particu-
late matter, known as aerosols,
high  (15  to  25  km)  into  the
atmosphere. The aerosol parti-
cles  are  transported  around
Earth  by  strong  winds.  They
reﬂect a signiﬁcant amount of
sunlight  and  produce  a  net
cooling  that  may  offset  much
of  the  global  warming  ex-
pected from the anthropogenic
greenhouse  effect.7,21 For  ex-
ample,  increased  atmospheric
aerosols over the United States
(from air pollution) are proba-
bly responsible for mean tem-
peratures  roughly  1°C  (1.7°F)  cooler  than  they
would  be  otherwise.  Aerosol  particle  cooling  may,
thus, help explain the disparity between model sim-
ulations  of  global  warming  and  actual  recorded
temperatures  that  are  lower  than  those  predicted
by models.22

Volcanic  eruptions  add  uncertainty  in  predict-
ing  global  temperatures.  For  instance,  what  was
the cooling effect of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo erup-
tion  in  the  Philippines  (Figure  18.22)?  Tremen-
dous explosions sent volcanic ash to elevations of
30 km (19 mi) into the stratosphere, and, as with
similar  past  events,  the  aerosol  cloud  of  ash  and
sulfur  dioxide  remained  in  the  atmosphere,  cir-
cling Earth, for several years. The particles of ash
and sulfur dioxide scattered incoming solar radia-
tion, resulting in climatic forcing of about 3 W/m2,
cooling  Earth  about  2.3°C  in  1991  and  1992.
Calculations suggest that aerosol additions to the
atmosphere from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption coun-
terbalanced the warming effects of greenhouse gas
additions through 1992. However, by 1994, most
aerosols  from  the  eruption  had  fallen  out  of  the
atmosphere,  and  global  temperatures  had  re-
turned  to  previous  higher  levels.23 Volcanic  forc-
ing from pulses of volcanic eruptions is believed to

warming,  we  need  to  consider  major  forcing vari-
ables that inﬂuence global warming, including solar
emission,  volcanic  eruption,  and  anthropogenic
input.

Solar Forcing
Since the Sun is responsible for heating Earth, solar
variation should be evaluated as a possible cause of
climate change. When we examine the history of cli-
mate  during  the  past  1,000  years,  we  see  that  the
variability of solar energy plays a role. Examination
of the solar record reveals that the Medieval Warm
Period (A.D. 1000–1300) corresponds with a time of
increased solar radiation, comparable to that which
we see today. Evaluation of the record also suggests
that  minimum  solar  activity  occurred  during  the
fourteenth  century,  coincident  with  the  beginning
of  the  Little  Ice  Age  (Figure  18.18d).  Therefore,  it
appears that variability of the input of solar energy
to  Earth  can  partially  explain  climatic  variability
during the past 1,000 years. However, the effect is
relatively small, only 0.25 percent; that is, the differ-
ence  between  the  solar  forcing  from  the  Medieval
Warm Period to the Little Ice Age is only a fraction
of 1 percent.19 Brightening of the Sun is unlikely to

(19 mi) into the atmosphere. (T. J. Casadevall/USGS)

have signiﬁcantly contributed to the cooling of the
Little Ice Age (see Figure 18.18d).19

Anthropogenic Forcing
Evidence of anthropogenic climate forcing, resulting
in a warmer world, is based in part on the following:
• Recent warming over the past few decades of
0.2°C per decade cannot be explained by nat-
ural variability of the climate over recent geo-
logic history.

• Industrial-age  forcing  of  1.6  W/m2 (Figure
18.20)  is  mostly  due  to  emissions  of  carbon
dioxide  that,  with  other  greenhouse  gases,
have greatly increased in concentration in the
past few decades (Figure 18.16).

• Climate  models  suggest  that  natural  forcings
in the past 100 years cannot be responsible for
what we know to be a nearly 1°C rise in global
land temperature (Figure 18.4b). When natural
and  anthropogenic  forcing  are  combined,  the
observed changes can be better explained.

Present warming greatly exceeds the natural vari-
ability (i.e., climate forcing) and closely agrees with
the response predicted from models of greenhouse
gas forcing.7

Human  processes  are  also  causing  a  slight  cool-
ing.  Reﬂection  from  air  pollution  particles  (i.e.,
aerosols)  has  reduced  incoming  solar  energy  by  as
much as 10 percent. This is termed global dimming.
Negative forcing from aerosols in the industrial age
is –1.4 W/m2 (Figure 18.20) and may be offsetting
up  to  50  percent  of  the  expected  warming  due  to
greenhouse gases.

18.6 Potential Effects 

of Global Climate Change

Our  discussion  of  global  warming  can  be  summa-
rized  as  follows:  (1)  Human  activity  is  increasing
the  concentration  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  at-
mosphere;  (2)  the  mean  temperature  of  Earth  in-
creased by about 0.8°C (1.4°F) in the past 100 years;
and  (3)  a  signiﬁcant  portion  of  the  observed  in-
crease  in  the  mean  temperature  of  Earth  results
from human activity.

All  climate  models  are  consistent  in  predicting
that warming will continue, due to greenhouse gases
now  in  the  atmosphere,  and  possibly  accelerate  in
the coming decades. That holds true even if green-
house  gas  emissions  by  people  are  nearly  elimi-
nated;  warming  of  about  0.5  to  1.0°C  would  still
occur in coming decades. Therefore, we need to care-
fully examine the potential effects of such warming.
If  the  level  of  carbon  dioxide  in  the  atmosphere
doubles from pre-industrial levels, as expected, it is
estimated  that  the  average  global  temperature  will
rise about 1.5° to 4.5°C (2.6° to 7.8°F), with signiﬁ-
cantly greater warming at the polar regions.7 Speciﬁc
effects  of  this  temperature  rise  in  a  speciﬁc  region
are difﬁcult to predict, but likely possibilities include
increased melting of glacial and sea ice, thawing of
permafrost,  change  in  the  global  climate  pattern,
and rise in sea level.

Glaciers and Global Warming
A glacier is a land-bound mass of moving ice. Glaci-
ers of all sizes are an important agent of erosion and
landscape  development.  We  will  begin  our  discus-
sion here with the form and process of glaciers and

topics  related  to  the  cold  climate:  permafrost  and
windblown silt.

Glaciers and the Cold-Climate Phenomenon.
The cold-climate phenomenon of ice has become an
important environmental topic. As more people live
and  work  in  the  higher  latitudes,  we  will  have  to
learn  more  about  regions  of  glaciation  and  per-
mafrost to ensure the best use of these sometimes
fragile environments.

Glaciation. Glacial ice forms as snow accumulates
over a period of years, is compressed from the weight
of overlying snow, and recrystallizes as a granular ice
known  as ﬁrn.  Loose  snow  is,  by  volume,  about  90
percent air compared to ﬁrn, which is about 25 per-
cent  air.  With  further  recrystallization,  ﬁrn  is
changed to blue glacial ice with less than 20 percent
air by volume. Some of the air in glacial ice is present
as air bubbles. Air trapped in bubbles are samples of
the  atmosphere  from  the  past  when  the  snow  fell.
The process of transformation from snow to glacial
ice may take tens to thousands of years.

Glaciers that cover large tracts of land are called
continental  glaciers,  or  ice  sheets;  those  conﬁned  to
mountain  valleys  at  high  altitudes  or  latitudes  are
called mountain (or alpine) glaciers. Only a few thou-
sand years ago, the most recent continental glaciers
retreated from the Great Lakes region of the United
States.  Several  times  in  the  past  2.6  million  years,
during  the  epoch  known  as  the  Pleistocene  or  Ice
Age (see the geologic time scale in Table 1.1), the ice

has advanced southward. Ice sometimes covered as
much as 30 percent of the land area of Earth, includ-
ing  the  present  sites  of  major  cities  such  as  New
York and Chicago (Figure 18.23).

Today, glacial ice covers only about 10 percent of
the land area of Earth. Most of this ice is located in
the  Antarctic  ice  sheet  (Figure  18.24),  with  lesser
amounts  in  the  Greenland  ice  sheet  and  in  the
mountain glaciers of Alaska, southern Norway, the
Alps, and the Southern Alps in New Zealand (Figure
18.25,  page  641).  Scientists  are  still  speculating
about whether the continental ice sheets will advance
once again. We may, indeed, still be in the Ice Age.

Glaciers typically move less than 1 m per day, and
many move only a few centimeters per day. However,
Alaskan glaciers have quite irregular rates of advance
and retreat. For example, the Black Rapids Glacier ad-
vanced several kilometers down its valley in a period
of  only  5  months  in  1936  and  1937,  and  then  it
started  to  retreat.  Such  a  rapid  advance,  called  a
glacial surge, can radically change a local environment.
Glaciers  move  by  several  processes,  including
basal sliding over water-saturated sediment ice and
rock. An increase in the water at the base of a glacier
can result in a glacier surging. Glaciers also move by
internal ﬂow that results from deformation and re-
crystallization  of  ice.  Glacial  ice  below  a  depth  of
about 60 m can deform plastically like Silly Putty. At
shallow depths, glacial ice behaves as a brittle mate-
rial (like rock). It is in the brittle zone that crevasses
(i.e., open cracks) form. As the glacial ice moves, dif-
ferent types of crevasses form. These can be several

The dark material on the glaciers is sediment being carried on
the top of the ice. The dark material down the glacier from the
conﬂuence is a medial moraine. A moraine is composed of rock
debris deposited by glacial ice along glacier margins (i.e., lateral
moraine), beneath glaciers (i.e., ground moraine), and in front
of glaciers (i.e., recession, or terminal, moraine). The medial
moraine formed when two lateral moraines merged at a con-
ﬂuence. The fractures in the white glacier ice are crevasses.

kilometers long and tens of meters deep, presenting
a hazard to people crossing a glacier.

There  have  been  important  recent  discoveries
about the dynamics of moving ice on the ice sheets
of  Antarctica  and  Greenland.  Subglacial  lakes  in
Antarctica lubricate the base of the ice, causing it to
move faster in ice streams within the larger ice sheet
(Figure 18.24). Most of the ice transported from the
interior of Antarctica to the coast was transported
by ice streams. On Greenland, there is surface water
from  ice  melted  by  warming  air  in  the  summer.
Meltwater ﬂows rapidly down crevasses, melting the
ice  down  to  the  bedrock  below  (Figure  18.26).  At
the base of the ice sheet, the water lubricates the ice,
and it ﬂows faster.24–26 As more people move into
areas  that  are  still  partly  glaciated,  we  will  have
more  situations  in  which  human  use  of  the  land
comes into conﬂict with glacial processes, as, for ex-
ample,  ﬂoods  produced  when  subsurface  water  in
glaciers is suddenly released.

Continental and mountain glaciers have produced
a  variety  of  depositional  and  erosional  landforms
that are easily seen in the landscape. Glacial deposits
of  Earth  materials  are  prominent  characteristics  of
many regions. For example, the ﬂat, nearly feature-
less ground moraine, or till plains, of central Indiana
are composed of till, material carried and deposited
by  the  continental  glaciers  that  completely  buried
preglacial river valleys. It is difﬁcult to believe that
beneath  these  glacial  deposits  is  a  topography
formed by running water, much like the hills and val-
leys of southern Indiana that glaciers never reached.

642

CHAPTER 18

Global Climate Change

Till  is  heterogeneous  material  deposited  directly  by
the ice; it may include, for example, boulders, gravel,
sand, silt, and clay particles. In addition to till, glacial
deposits include outwash, material carried away from
glaciers by meltwater in streams. Outwash consists of
materials such as silt, sand, and gravel.

Finally,  deposition  of  glacial  deposits  favors  the
formation  of  lakes.  Blocks  of  glacial  ice  frequently
are incorporated with glacial deposits. When a large
ice block melts, a depression may form at the surface
that ﬁlls with water, forming a shallow pond or lake.
These lakes may be short-lived and soon ﬁll with sed-
iment and decaying vegetation (i.e., water plants). As
the  plants  are  buried,  they  may  be  transformed  to
high organic soils or peat deposits. Such deposits are
mined for peat from areas glaciated during the Pleis-
tocene in the midwestern United States.

Glaciers are also agents of erosion:

• The Great Lakes in the United States are in part

due to glacial erosion of preglacial lowlands.

• Alpine or valley glaciers can convert V-shaped
valleys  formed  by  river  erosion  to  U-shaped
ones (Figure 18.27).

• Alpine glaciers can form sharp peaks, or “horns”
(e.g., the Matterhorn in France), or sharp ridge
lines (e.g., the Italian Alps, the Dolomites).

• Glacial  erosion  can  carve  grooves  or  shallow
furrows  in  rock,  showing  the  direction  the
glaciers move. Examples of these features can
be viewed in Central Park in New York City.

• Glacial erosion near where continental glaciers
form, as, for example, in Canada, has removed

vast quantities of rock debris and transported
them south, to be deposited as glacial till. This
explains the occasional ﬁnd of gem-quality dia-
monds  in  Indiana  streams  (they  came  from
Canada!).

Because  glaciation  produces  such  a  variety  of
landforms, the environmental geology of a recently
glaciated area may be complex. The wide variety of
Earth materials found in an area recently glaciated
requires  that  detailed  evaluation  of  the  physical
properties  of  surﬁcial  and  subsurface  materials  be
conducted before planning, designing, and building
structures such as dams, highways, and large build-
ings.  For  example,  if  glacial  lake  deposits  and  peat
are  present,  differential  subsidence  of  the  ground
upon  loading  (i.e.,  building  a  heavy  structure)  is  a
real possibility.

Permafrost. Permanently 
frozen  ground,  or
permafrost, is a widespread natural phenomenon in
the higher northern latitudes above about 60°, un-
derlying  about  20  percent  of  the  land  area  in  the
world (Figure 18.28). Two main types of permafrost,
called  discontinuous and  continuous,  are  deﬁned
based  on  the  areal  extent  of  frozen  ground.  In  the
continuous permafrost areas of Greenland and north-
ernmost  Asia  and  North  America,  the  only  ice-free
ground  is  beneath  deep  lakes  or  rivers.  The  water
keeps  the  ground  from  freezing.  Farther  south  is
the  region  of  discontinuous  permafrost,  character-
ized  in  its  higher  latitudes  by  scattered  islands  of
thawed ground in a predominantly frozen area. The

produces  unstable  materials,  re-
sulting  in  settling,  subsidence,
landslides,  and  lateral  or  downs-
lope  ﬂowage  of  saturated  sedi-
ment.  Heaving  (i.e.,  rising)  and
subsidence  of  the  ground  caused
by freezing and thawing of the ac-
tive 
layer  are  responsible  for
many  of  the  engineering  prob-
lems  in  the  arctic  and  subarctic
regions.27

The  presence  of  permafrost
has led to very high maintenance
costs and relocation or abandon-
ment of highways, railroads, and
other  structures  (Figure  18.29).
Gravel  roads  may  experience  se-
vere  differential  subsidence  (i.e.,
sinking at the surface) caused by
thawing  of  permafrost.  On  the
North  Slope  of  Alaska,  tractor
trails  constructed  by  bulldozing  off  the  vegetation
cover over permafrost have caused problems. Small
ponds  on  abandoned  trails  often  form  during  the
ﬁrst  summer  following  the  trail  construction,  and
they continue to grow deeper and wider as the per-
mafrost continues to thaw.27

FIGURE 18.28 Tundra landscape north of the Arctic Circle. Thawing
of tundra and associated permafrost has accelerated in recent decades. (Superstock)

percentage  of  unfrozen  ground  increases  at  lower
latitudes, until ﬁnally, at the southern border of the
permafrost, all the ground is unfrozen.

Permafrost  varies  from  north  to  south  in  thick-
ness  as  well  as  in  continuity.  About  85  percent  of
Alaska is underlain by continuous or discontinuous
permafrost  that  varies  in  thickness  from  about
400 m in the north to less than 0.3 m at the south-
ern margin of the frozen ground.27A cross section of
permafrost shows an upper active layer that thaws
during  the  summer,  as  well  as  unfrozen  layers
within  the  permafrost  below  the  active  layer.  The
thickness of the active layer depends upon such fac-
tors  as  exposure,  surface  slope,  amount  of  water,
and, particularly, the presence or absence of a vege-
tation cover, which greatly affects the thermal con-
ductivity  of  the  soil.  When  vegetation  is  removed,
the  surface  soil  is  no  longer  insulated  from  solar
radiation, and the permafrost may thaw.

Special engineering problems are associated with
the design, construction, and maintenance of roads,
railroads,  airﬁelds,  pipelines,  and  buildings  in  per-
mafrost areas. The vast range of problems occurring
in different Earth materials in these areas is beyond
the  scope  of  our  discussion.  In  general,  the  major
concerns are associated with permafrost in silty (i.e.,
ﬁne-grained),  poorly  drained  materials.  Because
these  materials  hold  a  good  deal  of  frozen  water,
they produce a lot of water upon melting. Thawing

Loess. Windblown  deposits  are  generally  subdi-
vided into two groups: sand deposits (mainly dunes)
and  loess,  which  is  windblown  silt.  Extensive  de-
posits of windblown sand and silt cover thousands
of  square  kilometers  in  the  United  States.  Sand
dunes are discussed with changing climate pattern;
here we consider windblown silt.

In  contrast  to  sand,  which  seldom  moves  more
than  1  m  off  the  ground,  windblown  silt  and  dust
can be carried in huge dust clouds thousands of me-
ters in altitude. A typical dust storm 500 to 600 km
in diameter may carry more than 100 million tons of
silt and dust, sufﬁcient to form a pile 30 m high and
3 km in diameter. Terrible dust storms in the 1930s
probably exceeded even this, perhaps carrying more
than 58,000 tons of dust per square kilometer.

Most of the loess in the United States is located
in and adjacent to the Mississippi Valley, but some is
found in the Paciﬁc Northwest and Idaho. It is de-
rived primarily from glacial outwash—that is, from
material deposited by streams carrying glacial melt-
water during the ice age. The retreat of the glaciers

left  behind  large  unvegetated  areas  adjacent  to
rivers. These areas were highly susceptible to wind
erosion, so silt in the outwash was blown away and
redeposited  as  loess.  We  know  this  because  loess
generally  decreases  rapidly  in  thickness  in  propor-
tion  to  distance  from  major  rivers,  including  the
Mississippi,  Missouri,  Illinois,  and  Ohio.  Loess  de-
posits may be primary loess, which has been essen-
tially  unaltered  since  being  deposited  by  the  wind,
or  secondary  loess,  which  has  been  reworked  and
transported  a  short  distance  by  water  or  intensely
weathered in place.

Although  loess  is  strong  enough  to  form  nearly
vertical slopes, it rapidly consolidates when subjected
to a load (e.g., a building) and wetted. This process,
called  hydroconsolidation,  occurs  when  the  clay  ﬁlms
or  calcium  carbonate  cement  around  the  silt  grains
wash away. Loess may therefore be a dangerous foun-
dation material. Settling and cracking of a house built
on loess reportedly took place overnight when water
from a hose was accidentally left on.

Melting of Glacial Ice and Sea Ice and Thawing
of Permafrost  with  Global  Warming. Today
there is concern that global warming is resulting in ac-
celerated  melting  of  glacial  ice  of  the  Greenland  ice
sheet and mountain glaciers. The latter are of particu-
lar importance in Europe and South America as water
resources for people and ecosystems further down the
mountain.  In  Bolivia,  a  70-year-old  ski  resort  on  a

glacier is all but shut down because a small glacier on
which the ski runs are built has all but disappeared.

Currently, many glaciers in the Paciﬁc Northwest
of the United States, as well as in Europe, China, and
Chile, are retreating or decreasing more, in terms of
thickness  of  ice  (typically  10  to  30  percent  of  ice
thickness since 1977), than are advancing or increas-
ing in thickness.26,28 The increase in the number of
retreating  glaciers  is  accelerating  in  the  Cascades,
Switzerland, and Italy. Evidently, this acceleration is
in response to the mean global temperature averag-
ing 0.4°C (0.68°F) above the long-term mean temper-
ature during the years 1977 to 1994. On Mt. Baker in
the Northern Cascades, for example, all eight glaciers
were advancing in 1976. By 1990, all eight were re-
treating. In addition, 4 of 47 alpine glaciers observed
in  the  Northern  Cascades  have  disappeared  since
1984.  Most  of  the  glaciers  in  Glacier  National  Park
may be gone by 2030 (Figure 18.30) and those of the
European Alps by the end of the century.26,28,29

Melting of the ice of the Greenland ice sheet has
doubled since about 1998. Melting produces surface
water  that  ﬂows  through  openings  and  fractures
(i.e., crevasses) and down to the base of the glacier,
where it lubricates the bottom of the ice, resulting
in an acceleration of glacial movement. Most glaci-
ers in the southern half of the Greenland ice sheet
are  accelerating  and  losing  ice  more  rapidly  than
previously. In 2005 alone, about 200 km3 (50 mi3)
of glacial ice was lost from this sheet.26

Potential Effects of Global Climate Change

645

When glacial ice melts and bare ground is exposed,
there is a positive feedback because white ice reﬂects
sunlight (while absorbing less sunlight), while darker
rock reﬂects less sunlight (while absorbing more sun-
light). The more ice that melts, the faster the warm-
ing  and  increased  melting.  This  is  a  classic  positive
feedback  cycle—warming  leading  to  more  warming.
This  explains,  in  part,  why  warming  at  higher  lati-
tudes and elevations may exceed other areas.7

Sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is declining in area. Since
the 1970s, when satellite remote sensing became pos-
sible, ice coverage in September (when sea ice is at a
minimum) has declined about 11 percent per decade.
2007 was the year with the lowest extent of sea ice was
(Figure 18.31). The rapid decline in 2007 was partly in
response to atmospheric circulation that favored melt-
ing. There is concern that the arctic is in a transitional
phase toward a seasonal ice-free condition by 2030.30
The  Antarctic  Peninsula,  relatively  narrow  land
that  points  toward  South  America,  is  known  to  be
one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth.
New studies suggest that the warming extends well
beyond  the  peninsula  to  include  most  of  West
Antarctica.  Although  the  trend  is  partly  offset  by
cooling of East Antarctica in the autumn, the trend
for  Antarctica  is  positive  climate  forcing,  resulting
in  warming.  The  causes  of  warming  are  complex,
but they require changes in atmospheric circulation
with temperature changes (e.g., warmer sea surface
water  and  sea  ice).  The  most  likely  direct  cause  is

anthropogenic  greenhouse  gas  forcing,  resulting
from increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere.31

As  Earth  warms,  more  snowfall  on  Antarctica  is
predicted. Satellite measurement from 1992 to 2003
suggested that the East Antarctic ice cap on Antarc-
tica increased in mass during the period of measure-
ment by about 50 billion tons per year32. (This is a
very  small  amount,  given  the  enormous  size  of
Antarctica;  it  represents  less  than  0.5  percent  of
Antarctica, covered to a depth of 1 m.) Another study,
using  computer  simulation  and  ice  core  records,  re-
ported that there has been no statistically signiﬁcant
increase in snowfall over Antarctica since the 1950s,
suggesting that there is no reduction of sea-level rise
by  increased  Antarctic  snowfall,  nor  an  increase  in
mass of glacial ice that would store water.33 What is
clear is that Antarctica is a complex place where more
basic  data  research  is  needed  to  better  understand
the consequences of global warming.

is  occurring.  Thawing  permafrost 

Permafrost  is  widespread  in  the  arctic  (Figure
18.28),  and  as  the  arctic  warms,  thawing  of  per-
mafrost 
in
Siberia  and  Canada  is  releasing  carbon  dioxide
(CO2) and methane (CH4) that are trapped in the
permafrost.  The  frozen  ground  becomes  a  swamp
rich in carbon dioxide and methane. Both CO2 and
CH4 are  greenhouse  gases,  and  there  is  positive
feedback occurring. As the arctic warms, more per-
mafrost  thaws,  releasing  more  greenhouse  gases,
which  causes  more  warming.  Permafrost  covered
with snow has a high reﬂectivity (i.e., albedo), but
thawed  permafrost  has  a  lower  reﬂectivity,  and
more  solar  energy  is  absorbed,  which  facilitates
further  thawing  of  the  permafrost  (i.e.,  another
positive feedback loop).34

Climate Patterns
A  global  rise  in  temperature  might  signiﬁcantly
change rainfall patterns, soil moisture relationships,
and  other  climatic  factors  that  are  important  to
agriculture. (See A Closer Look: Desertiﬁcation.) It
has been predicted that some northern areas, such
as  Canada  and  Eastern  Europe,  may  become  more
productive, whereas lands to the south will become
more  arid.  It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  such
predictions are very difﬁcult to make in light of the
uncertainties surrounding global warming. Further-
more, the northward movement of optimal climatic

growing zones does not necessarily mean that prime
agricultural zones will move north, since maximum
grain  production  is  also  dependent  on  fertile  soil
conditions that may not be present in all new areas.
For example, Canadian prairie soils tend to be thin-
ner  and  less  fertile  than  those  of  the  midwestern
United States. To some extent, it is this uncertainty
that  concerns  people.  Stable  or  expanding  global
agricultural activities are crucial to people through-
out the world who depend upon the food grown in
the major grain belts. Hydrologic changes associated
with climatic change resulting from global warming
might  seriously  affect  food  supplies  worldwide.  In
California and the San Joaquin Valley, where much
of the fruits and vegetables for the United States are
raised,  there  may  be  less  available  water.  Much  of
the irrigation water comes from runoff from spring
snowmelt in the Sierra Nevada to the east of the val-
ley. With global warming, winter rainfall will likely
increase, but the snowpack will be less. As a result,
runoff will be more rapid, ﬁlling reservoirs before it
is needed to irrigate crops. Water may have to be re-
leased from ﬁlled reservoirs and lost to the sea.

Global warming might also change the frequency
and  intensity  of  violent  storms,  and  this  change
may  be  more  important  than  the  issue  of  which
areas become wetter, drier, hotter, or cooler. Warming
oceans  will  feed  more  energy  into  high-magnitude
storms,  such  as  hurricanes.  More  or  larger  hurri-
canes  would  increase  the  hazard  of  living  in  low-
lying coastal areas, many of which are experiencing
rapid growth of human population.

That  global  and  regional  climatic  changes  have  a
signiﬁcant  effect  on  the  incidence  of  hazardous  nat-
ural events such as storm damage, landslides, drought,
and  ﬁres  is  sometimes  dramatically  illustrated  by  El
Niño. El Niño is a natural climatic event that occurs an
average  of  once  every  few  years,  most  recently  in
1997–1998. El Niño is both an oceanic and an atmos-
pheric phenomenon, involving unusually high surface
temperatures in the eastern equatorial Paciﬁc Ocean
and droughts and high-intensity rainstorms in various
places on Earth (see A Closer Look: El Niño).

Sea-Level Rise
A rise of sea level is a potentially serious problem re-
lated to global warming. Global ocean temperature
to a depth of at least 3 km has increased since 1961.
In this time, the oceans of the world have absorbed

Desertiﬁcation

Arid Lands
One of the major concerns of global
warming is the change in regional
and global climate patterns, especial-
ly the expansion of arid lands and ac-
companying desert processes.

Arid and semiarid regions of Earth,

also known as the dry lands, occupy
approximately 35 percent of Earth’s
land surface. Approximately 20 per-
cent of the world’s human population
lives there; clearly, dry lands are envi-
ronmentally important to people.35

Arid and semiarid regions of Earth
are areas of relatively low to very low
amounts of annual precipitation. In
some very arid areas, years may pass
before any measurable precipitation
occurs.

Deserts owe their origin, regardless

of their landscape characteristics, to
their scant precipitation. The deserts
of the world are primarily located in
two belts located between 15° and
30° latitude north and south of the
equator. These dry belts are caused by
the global pattern of atmospheric cir-
culation. At the equator, warm air rises
and moves north and south, toward
the cooler poles. There are areas of de-
scending air at approximately 30° lati-
tude (see Figure 18.6). Semiperma-
nent cells of high pressure exist in
these locations, along with reduced
rainfall. The high rainfall at the equa-
tor results from rising warm, moist air
that cools as it rises and condenses to
form rainfall. In the subtropical areas,
at approximately 15° to 30° latitude,
the air is subsiding rather than rising,
so little rain is produced.36,37

Global circulation of air masses ex-
plains the major deserts of the world,
including those in Africa, the Middle
East, parts of India, South America,

Australia, and North America; how-
ever, it is not responsible for all of the
deserts of the world. Some of the
semiarid lands and deserts of North
America, as well as of central Asia, are
dry lands because of their position
far inland in continents. Dry lands
may also occur in the rain shadows of
mountain ranges that intercept the
rainfall and block storms from mov-
ing farther inland.38 Mountains, hills,
plains, normally dry river channels,
and alluvial fans are the dominant
landforms of arid regions; sand
dunes, while locally and even in
some cases regionally abundant, are
not nearly as abundant. However,
sand dunes are interesting and have
been romanticized in many a story
and movie. When we think of a
desert, we may envision Arabian
Nights, with people and goods
marching on camels across the
dunes. In reality, most of the time
they would be crossing dune-free
hills and mountains.

Sand Dunes. Sand dunes and re-
lated deposits are found along the
coasts of the Atlantic and Paciﬁc
Oceans and the Great Lakes. Inland
sand is found in areas of Nebraska,
southern Oregon, southern Califor-
nia, Nevada, and northern Indiana, as
well as along large rivers ﬂowing
through semiarid regions—for exam-
ple, the Columbia and Snake rivers in
Oregon and Washington. Sand dunes
are constructed under the inﬂuence
of wind from sand moving close to
the ground. Simple dunes have a
gentle upwind slope and a steep
(~33°) downwind slope called the
slip face. When the wind blows, sand
moves up the gentle slope and down

the slip face, causing the dune to
move in the direction of the wind.
The process is known as dune migra-
tion. Dunes have a variety of sizes
and shapes and develop under a va-
riety of conditions. Regardless of
where they are located, how they
form, or whether they are active or
relic (i.e., formed in the past but no
longer active) or otherwise stabi-
lized, they tend to cause environ-
mental problems. Migrating sand is
particularly troublesome, and stabi-
lization of sand dunes is a major
problem in construction and mainte-
nance of highways and railroads that
cross sandy areas of deserts. Building
and maintaining reservoirs in sand
dune terrain is even more trouble-
some and often extremely expensive.
These reservoirs should be construct-
ed only if very high water loss can be
tolerated. Canals in sandy areas
should be lined to hold water and
control erosion.

Desertification
At its simplest, desertiﬁcation may
be deﬁned as the conversion of one
type of land, such as grasslands, to
land that resembles a desert. This
conversion does not involve the 
natural processes associated with 
climatic changes during the past 
2.6 million years that are thought to
cause expansion or contraction of
desert areas. Rather, desertiﬁcation is
human-induced degradation that in-
troduces desertlike conditions or
may transform the land from a par-
ticular state to a more desertlike
landscape.35 For example, the Sahara
Desert in Africa is expanding (Figure
18.A), as are several other deserts
in North America and Asia.

648

CHAPTER 18

Global Climate Change

FIGURE 18.A Advancing desert People digging out of a sand dune in the Sahara Desert, Africa,

Two primary characteristics of de-
sertiﬁcation are degradation of soil,
due primarily to soil erosion, and
degradation of vegetation.37 As a re-
sult of these two characteristics, the
process of desertiﬁcation may signiﬁ-
cantly affect the human environment
by damaging food production and
thereby contributing to malnutrition
and famine.37 Damage and loss of
vegetation resulting from desertiﬁca-
tion may be so extensive that the
productivity of the land is essentially
lost and may not be recovered in a
time frame useful to humans. There-
fore, in contrast to drought, which is
normally a relatively short-term prob-
lem that affects land productivity, de-
sertiﬁcation involves impacts that are
long term and chronic.35

For example, consider the U.S. Dust
Bowl. Terrible dust storms (Figure 18.B)
produced the “black blizzards”of the
“Dirty Thirties,”better known as the
Dust Bowl, that struck the high plains
of the United States, particularly Texas,
Colorado, Oklahoma, and Kansas.

More intensive use of tractors and
trucks enabled large-scale farming;
farmers cleared the land of vegetation
for growing grains. Exceptionally hot
and dry drought years also reduced
the natural vegetation cover. The ex-
posed topsoil was eroded by wind
and covered with sand, frequently
generating tremendous dust storms.
Thus, both human activity and tech-
nology and natural climatic variation
played a role in creating the Dust Bowl
that severely degraded the farmlands
and caused great hardships for the
people in the region. Today, northern
China is experiencing its own dust
bowl, and the causes are similar to
those of the United States in the Dirty
Thirties—unwise agriculture and graz-
ing practices.

The causes of desertiﬁcation are

well known and recognized. In a gen-
eral sense, they are related to four
main types of poor land use:36
overcultivation, overgrazing,
deforestation, and poor irrigation prac-
tices. These are exacerbated in some

countries with abundant arid and
semiarid lands when population in-
crease is rapid. Prevention, minimiza-
tion, and reversal of desertiﬁcation in-
volve the following:39,40
• Protection and improvement of

high-quality land rather than dedi-
cation of time and money to poor
land

• Application of simple, sound

range management techniques to
protect the land from overgrazing
by livestock

• Application of sound conservation

measures to agricultural lands to
protect soil resources

• Use of appropriate technology to
increase crop production, allow-
ing poorer lands to be returned to
less-intensive land uses than in-
tensive agriculture (e.g., forestry,
wildlife, grazing)

• Increased land restoration efforts
through vegetation management,
sand dune stabilization, and con-
trol of soil erosion

about four-ﬁfths of the heat that has been added to
Earth’s climate system.7

Warming  of  the  oceans  causes  the  water  to  ex-
pand  (i.e.,  thermal  expansion),  producing  a  rise  in
sea level. The rate of sea-level rise due to thermal ex-
pansion from 1961 to 2003 is estimated to be about
0.42 ⫾ 0.2 mm per year, increasing to about 1.6 ⫾
0.5  mm  per  year  from  1993  to  2003.  Thus,  it  ap-
pears  that  sea-level  rise  due  to  warming  of  ocean
water is accelerating.7

Melting of glacial ice is thought to be contribut-
ing to sea-level rise. Melting of sea ice (i.e., ﬂoating
ice) does not cause a rise in sea level; you can verify
this by placing ice in a glass of water and observing
the water level in the glass while waiting for the ice to
melt. The estimated increase in sea level from melt-
ing glaciers is estimated to be about 1.38 ⫾ 0.4 mm

per  year  from  1961  to  2003,  increasing  to  about 
1.5 ⫾ 0.6 mm per year from 1993 to 2003.7

Several  tentative  conclusions  may  be  put  forth

concerning rise in sea level:

• Both thermal expansion and melting glacial ice
have contributed signiﬁcantly to the observed
sea-level rise since 1961.

• The difference between the observed and esti-
mated rise in sea level is considerable, suggest-
ing that additional research is needed to better
understand sea-level rise.

• The rates of both thermal expansion and melt-

ing glacial ice are accelerating.

• The contribution of the Greenland ice sheet to
sea-level rise has increased about four times in
recent decades, consistent with surface obser-
vations of melting glacial ice.

CHAPTER 18

Global Climate Change

A 

Closer
Look

El Niño

El Niño events probably start from
random, slight reductions in the
trade winds that, in turn, cause warm
water in the western equatorial Paciﬁc
Ocean to ﬂow eastward (Figure 18.C).
This change further reduces the
trade winds, causing more warm
water to move eastward, until an El

Niño event is established.41 El Niños
are thought to bring about an in-
crease in some natural hazards on a
nearly global scale by putting a
greater amount of heat energy into
the atmosphere. The heat energy in
the atmosphere increases as more
water evaporates from the ocean to

the atmosphere. The increase of heat
and water in the atmosphere pro-
duces more violent storms, such as
hurricanes.

Figure 18.D shows the extent of
natural disasters that have been at-
tributed, in part, to the El Niño event
of 1997–1998, when worldwide hurri-

and ﬁres killed people and
caused billions of dollars in dam-
ages to crops, ecosystems, and
human structures. Australia, In-
donesia, the Americas, and Africa
were particularly hard hit. There
is some disagreement about the
amount of damage and loss of
life directly attributable to El
Niño, but few disagree about its
signiﬁcance.42,43

We do not yet completely un-

derstand the causes of El Niño
events, which occur every few
years, to a lesser or greater ex-
tent. Large El Niño events oc-
curred in 1982–1983 and
1997–1998.

El Niño events can cause

havoc by increasing the occur-
rence of hazardous natural
events, and there is concern that
human-induced climatic change
may, through global warming,
produce more and stronger El
Niño events in the future. This 
effect would result, in part, be-
cause as we burn more fossil
fuels and emit more greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere, the
oceans will continue to warm,
and differential warming in 
various parts of the ocean may
increase the frequency and in-
tensity of El Niño events in the
Paciﬁc Ocean.

The opposite of El Niño is La Niña,

in which eastern Paciﬁc waters are
cool. With La Niña events, droughts,

rather than ﬂoods, may result in
southern California. The alternation
from El Niño to La Niña is a natural

Earth cycle that has only recently
been recognized.44

Estimates of the rise expected in the next century
vary widely, from approximately 18 to 59 cm (7 to
23 in.), and precise estimates are not possible at this
time.  However,  a  40  cm  (16  in.)  rise  in  sea  level
would have signiﬁcant environmental impacts. Such
a rise could cause increased coastal erosion on open
beaches of up to 80 m (260 ft), rendering buildings
and other structures more vulnerable to waves gen-
erated  from  high-magnitude  storms.  In  areas  with
coastal  estuaries,  a  40  cm  (16  in.)  sea-level  rise
would cause a landward migration of existing estu-
aries, again putting pressure on human-built struc-
tures in the coastal zone. Communities would have
to choose between making very substantial invest-
ments  in  controlling  coastal  erosion  and  allowing
beaches  and  estuaries  to  migrate  landward  over
wide areas.7,45,46

Rise  in  sea  level  is  already  threatening  some
small  islands  in  the  tropical  Paciﬁc  Ocean.  The  is-
land nation of Tuvalu consists of about nine atolls
(Figure  18.32).  As  rising  sea  level  since  the  last
glacial  maximum  about  20,000  years  ago  over-
topped  a  degraded  carbonate  platform,  the  atolls
formed.  The  highest  place  on  the  island  is  only
about 4.5 m (15 ft) above sea level. People ﬁrst in-
habited  the  island  of  Funafuti  and  other  atolls  of
Tuvalu  about  2,000  years  ago,  when  stable  inlets
formed.47 Recent sea-level rise is now threatening
Funafuti,  especially  during  high  tides,  which  en-
hance  wave  attack  and  ﬂooding.  During  high  tide
ﬂood  events  (Figure  18.33),  people  report  water
bubbling  up  from  the  ground,  contributing  to  the
ﬂooding  of  low-lying  areas.  With  continued  sea-
level  rise,  the  future  ability  of  Funafuti  and  other

people on Funafuti could become the ﬁrst to be dis-
placed by rising sea level.

The  northwestern  and  northern  coastlines  of
Alaska are experiencing rapid erosion due to rise in
sea level, melting permafrost soils, and loss of sum-
mer  sea  ice  that  can  protect  a  coastline  from  ero-
sion.48 Some small islands may disappear, and some
villages have already been moved inland.

Changes in the Biosphere
There  is  a  growing  body  of  evidence  that  global
warming  is  initiating  a  number  of  changes  in  the
biosphere, threatening both ecological systems and
people. These include risk of extinction as land use
changes  and  habitat  becomes  fragmented.  Other

changes  include  shifts  in  the  range  of  plants  and
animals,  with  a  variety  of  consequences:  Mosqui-
toes  carrying  diseases, 
including  malaria  and
dengue  fever  in  Africa,  South  America,  Central
America, and Mexico, are migrating to higher eleva-
tions;  butterﬂy  species  are  moving  northward  in
Europe; some bird species are moving northward in
the United Kingdom; subalpine forests in the Cas-
cade  Mountains  in  Washington  are  migrating  to
higher meadows; alpine plants in Austria are shift-
ing to higher elevations; sea ice melting in the arctic
is  placing  stress  on  seabirds,  walruses,  and  polar
bears; and warming and increasing acidity of shal-
low water in the Florida Keys, Bermuda, Australia’s
Great Barrier Reef, and many other tropical ocean
areas is believed to be contributing to the bleaching
of coral reefs.7,49,50

Global  warming  is  likely  to  affect  many  ecosys-
tems  in  North  America  over  the  next  100  years 
because:49

• Warming  is  expected  to  be  2°  to  4°C  (3.6°  to

7.2°F).

• Precipitation  is  projected  to  be  less  frequent

• The  temperature  of  streams  and  rivers  will

but more intense.

likely increase.

• Wildﬁres will be more frequent.
• Growing seasons will be lengthened, with ear-
lier  spring  and  greater  primary  productivity,
especially at higher latitudes.

• Hurricane rainfall and wind speed are likely to

increase.
As a result:
• Some ecosystems will experience stress.
• Many  species  may  shift  ranges  north  and  to-
ward higher altitudes in attempts to adapt to
warming.

• Increases in disturbances may cause ecosystem

changes to increase in time and space.

Changes  are  expected  to  affect  marine  ecosys-
tems in a variety of ways. Approximately one-third
of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities
enter the oceans of the world. This decreases atmos-
pheric  concentration  of  carbon  dioxide,  reducing
global  warming,  but  at  a  cost  to  the  oceans.  Dis-
solved carbon dioxide and water form carbonic acid

(CO2 ⫹ H2O : H2CO3). The acid dissociates to bi-

FIGURE 18.34 Changes in seawater Idealized diagram showing processes in shallow water less  than about 1 km deep that
changes the acidity of seawater.

H⫹ increases,  the  water  becomes  more  acidic  (i.e.,
the pH of the water is reduced) (Figure 18.34). Over
the past 15 years, ocean acidity has increased about 
30  percent.  The  increased  acidity  of  the  ocean  and
ecosystem  is  fundamentally  changing  ocean  chem-
istry structure and function by stressing marine or-
ganisms from plankton to coral and shellﬁsh, as they
attempt to adapt to increasing acidity. The stress for
some species may be manifested in reduced growth
rates  and  reproductivity.  These  changes  will  result
because  if  organisms  need  to  expend  increased  en-
ergy to maintain internal pH, they may have less en-
ergy  for  growth  and  reproduction.  How  individual
species  and  ecosystems  will  respond  to  future  in-
creased acidiﬁcation is a complex problem and is the
subject  of  increased  research.51,52 Increased  acidity
of seawater may make it more difﬁcult for some ma-
rine  organisms  that  produce  carbonate  shells,  such
as oysters, coral, and some plankton, to draw carbon-
ate from the seawater to make their shells.

In  response  to  the  warming  atmosphere,  ocean
water temperature over the past 100 years has trans-
ferred heat to the upper water of the oceans. As a re-
sult, the average temperature of the upper 700 m of
the  sea  has  increased  by  about  0.6°C  over  the  past
century. Temperature increase has a fundamental ef-
fect  on  biological  processes  of  marine  organisms
through  increased  metabolic  rates,  which  impacts

ecosystem  processes  of  energy  expenditure  and
chemical cycling. Marine organisms have the ability
to  adapt  to  temperature  change  within  a  range  of
temperatures at an optimal value. If the range is ex-
ceeded, the ability to adapt is reduced, and popula-
tions may decline or be driven to local extinction.53
Mobile species such as ﬁsh can swim to other areas
or  deeper,  where  the  temperature  is  closer  to  what
they prefer. Those species tied to the bottom, such as
shellﬁsh, may slowly migrate if change is sufﬁciently
slow. The changes of temperature and acidity of sea-
water appear to be accelerating, and that may make
adaptation more difﬁcult for some species.

Adaptation of Species 
to Global Warming
With global warming, regions of temperature and pre-
cipitation change, and this stresses ecosystems. Dur-
ing the past 25 years or so, plants and animals have
shifted their ranges by about 6 km per decade toward
the polar areas. In addition, spring is arriving earlier,
and  plants,  as  a  consequence,  are  blooming  earlier,
frogs are breeding earlier, and migrating birds are ar-
riving earlier in various places. The rate of change has
been  about  2.3  days  per  decade.  In  addition,  it  has
been reported that tropical pathogens have moved up
in  latitude  and  elevation,  affecting  species  that  may

not be adapted to them. For example, in Costa Rica,
more than 60 species of frogs may have gone extinct
because  of  warmer  temperatures  that  have  affected
their immune system response to a lethal fungus that
has taken advantage of the warmer temperature. Cli-
mate  change  that  warmed  the  air  about  0.8°C  may
have caused the ﬁrst extinction of a mammal, a species
of  white  opossum  that  has  apparently  disappeared
from Queensland, Australia. It was reported that the
opossum lived only above an elevation of about 1,000
m and was very susceptible to being exposed to higher
temperatures, even for a short period of time.54

A problem with past evaluations of a species po-
tentially becoming threatened or even going extinct
was that they were based on simple models that pri-
marily  considered  temperature  and  precipitation,
perhaps along with soil type and hydrology, that de-
termine,  in  part,  where  species  live.  This  informa-
tion could then be put into a standard climate model
to predict where a particular species might migrate
in order to avoid adverse effects of climate change.
We  now  know  that  these  simple  envelope  models
that use a few climate and topographic variables are
not  sufﬁcient,  and  newer  models  that  incorporate
more  biological  elements,  including  competition
among species and genetics, are being used to evalu-
ate evolutionary response to climate change.54,55

A controversial suggestion is that we might assist
migration of some species that are unable to migrate
with climate change. To some, this is a drastic, con-
troversial step that may be unacceptable due to the
unanticipated  risk  of,  essentially,  creating  an  inva-
sive  species.  Assisted  migration  worries  ecologists
and conservation biologists because they have spent
a  lot  of  time  and  effort  working  against  invasive
species,  some  of  which  cause  ecosystem  problems
and the extinction of other species. Before we seri-
ously  consider  assisted  migration,  much  more  re-
search is needed to better understand the habitats
of  threatened  and  endangered  species,  including
where they can do well, what might threaten them,
and what they may threaten.54

Strategies for Reducing 
the Impact of Global Warming
Two big questions concerning the Earth climate sys-
tem and people are (1) What changes have occurred
and (2) What changes could occur in the future? An-
swering  these  questions  requires  geologic  evalua-

tion  of  prehistoric  changes  and  the  prediction,
through modeling and simulation, of future change
(Figure 18.35). Because we now know global warm-
ing is due in part to the increased concentration of
greenhouse gases, reduction of these gases in the at-
mosphere  is  a  primary  management  strategy.  This
was the subject of the 1997 United Nations Frame-
work  Convention  on  Climate  Change  in  Kyoto,
Japan. The objective of the convention was to pro-
duce  an  international  agreement  to  reduce  emis-
sions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide.
The  United  States  originally  agreed  to  reductions,
but  in  2001,  it  refused  to  honor  the  agreement,
much to the disappointment of other nations, espe-
cially European allies. As a result, the leadership in
controlling  global  warming  has  shifted  from  the
United  States  to  the  European  Union.  The  Kyoto
Protocol  was  signed  by  166  nations  and  became  a
formal  international  treaty  in  February  2005.  The
United  States,  as  of  2010,  had  taken  more  active
steps  to  deal  with  climate  change  through  energy
planning to reduce carbon emissions.

We face a dilemma with respect to burning fos-
sil fuels. On one hand, fossil fuels are vital to our
society and are necessary for continued economic

development  and  growth,  as  well  as  human  well-
being. On the other hand, scientiﬁc evidence suggests
that burning fossil fuels is contributing signiﬁcantly
to global warming. Burning fossil fuels is linked to en-
vironmental problems that include a rise in sea level,
increased  surface  temperatures,  and  increased  fre-
quency  and  intensity  of  storms  such  as  hurricanes.
Impacts  associated  with  fossil  fuels  depend  upon
how much the global temperature will actually rise.
Estimates of temperature rise from climate models
range from about 2° to 4°C.7 If the increase is close
to 2°C, we can probably adapt with minimal distur-
bance.  If  the  increase  in  temperature  is  near  the
high end, signiﬁcant impacts are likely. One way to
estimate  potential  increase  in  temperature  that  is
independent of the model predictions is to examine
the geologic record for past change. A study of the
geologic  record  from  ocean  sediments  deposited
during the past several hundred thousand years sug-
gests that warming in the next century will be about
5°C, consistent with models that predict warming as
great  as  4.5°C.56 If  global  temperature  rises  4°C,
than we will need a strategy to reduce emissions of
carbon  (about  50  percent  over  several  decades)  to
avoid serious environmental disruptions that would
result because, at this level of temperature increase,
signiﬁcant  environmental  impacts  are  much  more
likely. Also, it is important to recognize that, follow-
ing the peak of emissions of carbon dioxide, it will
probably take several hundred years or longer before
temperature and sea level stabilize (Figure 18.36).
Therefore,  the  sooner  we  act  to  reduce  emissions,
the lower the impacts will be and the sooner we will
be  on  a  path  to  stabilizing  climate  change.  Even  if
carbon  emissions  were  reduced  to  zero,  warming
will continue this century. There is 0.5° to 1.0°C ad-
ditional warming in the Earth climate system now.
If reducing carbon emissions is necessary to reduce
impacts  of  global  warming,  we  need  to  take  action.
The reduction must occur at a time when human pop-
ulation  and  energy  consumption  are  increasing.
There  are  several  ways  that  we  might  reduce  emis-
sions of carbon dioxide into the environment:

• Reduce emissions through improved engineer-
ing  of  fossil  fuel–burning  power  plants  (e.g.,
develop  and  use  coal-burning  power  plants
that sequester the carbon and place it in safe
storage)

• Use fossil fuels that release less carbon into the
atmosphere,  such  as  natural  gas,  which,  on

burning, releases less carbon dioxide than does
coal or oil (Table 18.2).

• Conserve energy to reduce our dependence on
fossil  fuels;  use  more  alternative  energy
sources;  and  store  carbon  in  Earth’s  systems
such  as  forests,  soils,  and  in  rocks  below  the
surface of Earth.57–60

Storage of carbon in plants, soils, and the ocean
has  received  considerable  study.  The  option  of  se-
questration of carbon in the geological or rock envi-
ronment has received less attention. Sequestration
is attractive because the residence time of carbon in
the geologic environment is generally a long period
of time, potentially thousands to hundreds of thou-
sands of years.

The general principle of geologic sequestration of
carbon is fairly straightforward. The idea is to cap-
ture carbon dioxide from power plants and industry
and inject that carbon into the subsurface geologic
environment.  Two  geologic  environments  have  re-
ceived  considerable  attention  in  this  regard.  The
ﬁrst is sedimentary rocks that contain salty water.
These  rocks,  known  as  saline  aquifers,  are  fairly
widespread  at  numerous  locations  on  Earth  and
have  large  reservoir  capacity  with  the  potential  to
sequester  large  amounts  of  carbon.  Sedimentary
rocks  in  these  reservoirs  have  the  potential  to  se-
quester  many  years  of  human-produced  carbon
dioxide emissions. They could provide the necessary
time to transition to an energy economy not depen-
dent on fossil fuels.57 The second (but related) geo-
logic  environment  for  sequestration  of  carbon  is

depleted  oil  and  gas  ﬁelds.  The  process  of  placing
carbon dioxide in the geologic environment involves
compressing the gas to a mixture of both liquid and
gases  and  then  injecting  it  underground,  using
wells. Injecting carbon dioxide into depleted oil and
gas ﬁelds has an added advantage: The carbon diox-
ide is not only stored but also serves to enhance re-
covery of remaining oil and gas in the reservoir by
helping move the oil toward production wells.

is  ongoing 

A  demonstration  project 

in
Saskatchewan,  Canada.  The  Weyburn  oil  ﬁeld
started production in the 1950s and was considered
to  be  depleted.  However,  with  enhanced  recovery
and storage of carbon dioxide, production is likely to
last several more decades. The source of carbon diox-
ide for the Weyburn ﬁeld comes from a coal-burning
plant in North Dakota, by way of a pipeline that de-
livers several thousand tons of carbon per day.57

Another  carbon  sequestration  project  is  located
beneath  the  North  Sea.  Carbon  dioxide  is  injected
into a saltwater aquifer located below a natural gas
ﬁeld.  The  project,  which  started  in  1996,  injects
about 1 million tons of carbon dioxide into the sub-
surface environment each year. It is estimated that
the  entire  facility  can  hold  about  the  amount  of
carbon dioxide that is projected to be produced from
all of Europe’s fossil fuel plants in the next few hun-
dred  years.59 The  cost  of  sequestering  the  carbon
beneath  the  North  Sea  is  expensive.  However,  it
saves the company from paying carbon dioxide taxes
for  emissions  into  the  atmosphere.  Finally,  pilot
projects  to  demonstrate  the  potential  and  useful-
ness  of  storing  carbon  in  the  United  States  have
been initiated in Texas, beneath depleted oil ﬁelds.
The  good  news  is  that  immense  salt  aquifers  are
common beneath many areas of the United States,
including the Gulf Coast, Texas, and Louisiana, and
the potential to store carbon is immense.59

Recent  studies  suggest  that  global  warming  is
probably not an immediate emergency, and we will
have a decade or so to develop alternatives to contin-
ued  intensive  burning  of  fossil  fuels.  If  we  decide
that  we  must  stabilize  the  concentration  of  atmos-
pheric carbon dioxide in the future, it will be neces-
sary  to  go  through  a  transition  from  fossil  fuel
energy  sources  to  alternative  sources  that  produce
much  less  carbon  dioxide.  However,  speculation
based on studies of glacial ice cores from Greenland
indicates that signiﬁcant climatic change may occur
quickly,  perhaps  in  as  little  as  a  few  years.  A  quick
natural  or  human-induced  warming  or  cooling  is
probably unlikely, but if one does occur, the potential
impacts could be fast and serious (see A Closer Look:
Abrupt  Climate  Change).  Human  civilization  began
and has developed into our present highly industrial-
ized society in only about 7,000 years. That period
has  been  characterized  by  a  relatively  stable,  warm
climate that is probably not characteristic of longer
periods of Earth history. It is difﬁcult to imagine the
human  suffering  that  might  result  late  in  the
twenty-ﬁrst  century  from  a  quick  climate  change
to  harsher  conditions,  when  there  are  as  many  as
10 billion or more people on Earth to feed.17

18.7 Coupling of Global 
Change Processes: 
Ozone Depletion 
and Global Warming

The major global change processes discussed in this
chapter  have  important  linkages.  For  example,  the
chloroﬂuorocarbons  (CFCs)  that  cause  ozone  (O3,
triatomic  oxygen)  depletion  when  they  reach  the
stratosphere also contribute to the greenhouse effect
when  they  are  released  into  the  lower  atmosphere.

Look

Abrupt Climate Change

• Abrupt change in the pattern of

circulation of water in the Atlantic
Ocean that is characterized by
northward ﬂow of warm, salty
water in the upper layers of the
ocean

Abrupt climate change is deﬁned as a
large-scale change in the global cli-
mate system that takes place over a
few decades or less. Such change is
anticipated to persist for at least a
few decades and will cause substan-
tial disruptions to both human and
natural systems.61 Several types of
abrupt climate change could cause
serious risk to humans and the natur-
al environment in terms of our ability
to adapt, including:
• A rapid change of sea level as a re-
sult of changes in the glaciers and
ice sheets

• Droughts and ﬂoods, resulting

from widespread rapid changes to
the hydrologic cycle

• A rapid release of methane (a

strong greenhouse gas) to the at-
mosphere from both thawing per-
mafrost and the ocean’s sediment
These four potential abrupt changes
have been addressed by the U.S. Cli-
mate Change Science Program.61
One of the major questions is

whether there will be abrupt
changes in sea level. We know that
even small changes in sea-level rise
may have signiﬁcant repercussions
for society, with serious economic
impacts, including coastal erosion as
well as an increase in coastal ﬂooding
and a loss of coastal wetlands. The
present climate models do not ade-
quately capture all aspects of sea-
level changes resulting from melting
glacial ice. However, given this, there
is a concern that projections for sea-
level rise in the future, as presented

by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change,7 probably underes-
timate the amount of sea-level rise
during the twenty-ﬁrst century.

A second question involves the po-

tential for abrupt changes of the hy-
drologic cycle. Of particular concern
are changes that affect water supply,
particularly through long, protracted
droughts. Of particular signiﬁcance is
the fact that droughts can develop
faster than people and society are
able to adapt to them. Thus, droughts
that last from several years to a
decade or more have serious conse-
quences to society. It has been
pointed out that long droughts have
occurred in the past and are still likely
to occur in the future, even in the ab-
sence of global warming, as a result of
increased greenhouse-gas forcing.61

A third question concerning

abrupt change has to do with the At-
lantic Ocean circulation system,
which carries warm water to the
North Atlantic, where it becomes
saltier and sinks to become a cold
water bottom current that moves
south. The warm water is partly re-
sponsible for keeping Western Europe
comfortable and hospitable. How-
ever, it is primarily the large expanse
of the ocean itself that accomplishes
this. The strength of this current is ex-
pected to decrease approximately 25
to 30 percent as a result of the global
warming in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
However, it appears very unlikely that
the ocean current system in the At-
lantic will undergo a collapse or an
abrupt transition to a very weakened
state in the next 100 years.61

A ﬁnal question concerning

abrupt change is whether there will
be a rapid change in atmospheric
methane. This is a signiﬁcant ques-
tion because methane is a strong

greenhouse gas that, if greatly in-
creased in concentration in the at-
mosphere, would accelerate global
warming. It is generally concluded
that a very rapid change in the re-
lease of methane during the next 100
years or so is very unlikely. However,
ongoing warming will increase emis-
sions of methane from both ocean
sediments and wetlands. Wetlands in
the northern high latitudes are par-
ticularly more susceptible to releas-
ing additional methane because
there is accelerated warming, along
with enhanced precipitation, in per-
mafrost areas that contain a lot of
stored methane. Thus, it appears
that, in future decades, methane lev-
els will likely increase and cause addi-
tional warming.61

In conclusion, it appears that

abrupt climate change during the next
century is unlikely, and, thus, we will
most likely have time to respond to
potential adverse consequences of
global warming. However, it takes time
to initiate change in policy, and time is
growing short; a serious response to
global warming from all countries is
necessary in the near future.

A better understanding of past

abrupt changes in climate, through
the collection and analysis of geo-
logic data, is necessary to fully under-
stand what may cause future change.
Geologic data provide the most direct
evidence of past change. Geologic
data from sediments and glacial ice,
along with monitoring, are assisting
in understanding the causes of long-
term changes in ocean and glacial
conditions and how these are linked
to atmospheric response. With this,
we may be better able to forecast
both long- and short-term droughts
that have serious consequences to
humans and the natural environment.

658

CHAPTER 18

Global Climate Change

The  processes  responsible  for  stratospheric  ozone
depletion and development of the Antarctic ozone
hole  are  complex  but  related  to  chemical  reactions
between chlorine (Cl) and ozone (O3), linked to the
Antarctic polar vortex (where there is counterclock-
wise rotation of the atmosphere), and polar stratos-
pheric  clouds  where  ozone-depleting  reactions
happen. The air mass in the vortex is isolated, cools,
condenses,  and  descends.62 Chloroﬂuorocarbons,
which  contain  chlorine,  are  stable  in  the  lower  at-
mosphere but wander up to the stratosphere. There,
chlorine is split from CFCs by ultraviolet radiation
from the Sun and reacts with ozone to produce chlo-

rine oxide and oxygen: Cl ⫹ O3 : ClO ⫹ O2. The re-
sult is destruction of the ozone. The chlorine is re-
leased  from  chlorine  oxide  (ClO)  by  a  subsequent
reaction with monoatomic oxygen (O): ClO ⫹ O :
Cl ⫹ O2, releasing Cl to destroy more ozone by the

ﬁrst reaction (Figure 18.37). The reactions are com-
plex  but  follow  the  general  equations  just  men-
tioned. The two important sinks for chlorine in the
clouds are hydrochloric acid (HCl) and chlorine ni-
trate. With denitriﬁcation, chlorine (Cl2) is released
to enter into ozone-depletion reactions (see Figure
18.37). During the Antarctic spring, these chain re-
actions  may  happen  very  quickly,  causing  up  to  2
percent  ozone  depletion  each  day  and,  ultimately,
producing the observed 50 to 70 percent annual de-
pletion.  In  the  lower  atmosphere,  where  they  are
emitted,  CFCs  trap  more  heat  than  carbon  dioxide
because  they  can  absorb  more  infrared  radiation.
One study concluded that, on a per-molecule basis,
chloroﬂuorocarbons  are  several  thousand  times
more efﬁcient at absorbing infrared radiation than is
carbon  dioxide.  Nevertheless,  carbon  dioxide  con-
tributes  much  more  to  the  total  anthropogenic

greenhouse  effect  than  do  CFCs because  so  much
more carbon dioxide is being emitted.63

The coupling of the greenhouse and ozone prob-
lems via release of materials such as CFCs is an im-
portant point to consider. Other couplings, related
to processes such as the burning of fossil fuels, re-
lease precursors to acid rain as well as carbon diox-
ide  and  other  greenhouse  gases  (see  Chapter  16).

Burning  fossil  fuels  and  volcanic  eruptions,  as  dis-
cussed earlier, also produce particulates that result
in atmospheric cooling. Carbon dioxide has the pre-
dominant  effect  on  changing  global  temperature,
but we see the principle of environmental unity in
action.  Many  aspects  of  one  problem,  in  this  case
global  warming,  are  related  to  other  processes  or
problems, such as ozone depletion.

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About the MWP and LIA to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. Why are climate change and 

the MWP important to how we
think about sustainability and
climate change today?

2. What can we learn about the
MWP that could inﬂuence our
thinking about climate change
in the twenty-ﬁrst century?

3. Does the study of past climate
change during the MWP and

the more recent Little Ice Age
have signiﬁcance with respect to
understanding of and response
to natural hazards related to 
climate change? How?

4. How do science and values link
to our energy choices related to
potential global warming in the
twenty-ﬁrst century?

Summary

The main goal of the emerging inte-
grated ﬁeld of study known as Earth
systems science is to obtain a basic
understanding of how our planet
works and how its various compo-
nents, such as the atmosphere,
oceans, and solid Earth, interact. An-
other important goal is to predict
global changes that are likely to occur
within the next several decades. The
global changes involved include tem-
perature, or climate, changes and the
resulting changes in seawater and on
land. Because these are short-term
predictions, Earth systems science is
relevant to people everywhere.

Methods of studying global change

include examination of the geologic
record from lake sediments, glacial ice,
and other Earth materials; gathering

of real-time data from monitoring sta-
tions; and development of mathemati-
cal models to predict change. Sources
of data that are used in the study of
climate change include measurements
from the instrumental record; the his-
toric record; and climate proxy data
such as study of tree rings and mea-
surement of carbon dioxide and
methane from ice bubbles in glaciers.
Climate refers to characteristic at-
mospheric conditions, such as precipi-
tation and temperature over seasons,
years, and decades. The atmosphere is
a dynamic, complex environment
where many important chemical reac-
tions occur.

Human activity is contributing

signiﬁcantly to global warming. The
trapping of heat by the atmosphere is

referred to as the greenhouse effect.
Water vapor and several other gases,
including carbon dioxide, methane,
and chloroﬂuorocarbons, tend to trap
heat and warm Earth because they
absorb some of the heat energy radi-
ating from Earth. The effects of a
global rise in temperature include a
rise in global sea level and changes in
rainfall patterns, high-magnitude
storms, soil moisture, agriculture,
and the biosphere.

Natural climate-forcing mecha-

nisms that may cause climatic
change include Milankovitch cycles,
solar variability, and volcanic activ-
ity. Anthropogenic causes include air
pollution and increases in green-
house gases, especially carbon diox-
ide. We now understand that global

660

CHAPTER 18

Global Climate Change

climate can change rapidly over a
time period of a few decades to a few
hundred years. Two important ques-
tions are: What changes have oc-
curred and What changes could occur
in the future?

The science of global warming is

well understood. Human-induced
global warming is occurring. There is

no reason for gloom and doom, but
we need to take appropriate action
soon to slow or stop global warming
and associated environmental conse-
quences.

Adjustments to global warming

will vary, from adapting to change, to
reducing emissions of carbon dioxide,
to sequestration of carbon. Several

different simultaneous adjustments
are likely.

Some global changes, such as

ozone depletion and the greenhouse
effect, are coupled. For example, the
CFCs released in the lower atmos-
phere add to the greenhouse effect
before diffusing to the stratosphere,
where they cause ozone depletion.

greenhouse gases, we will continue to
perform  an  unplanned  global  experi-
ment  with  untested  but  predictable
adverse consequences.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human  Population  Growth
Increase  in  human  population  is  one
of  the  driving  forces  of  the  human-
induced  component  of  global  warm-
ing.  The  United  States,  with  about 
5  percent  of  the  world’s  population,
emits about 20 percent of the carbon
dioxide,  thought  to  contribute  to
warming  through  the  greenhouse 
effect. As population continues to in-
crease  beyond  the  7  billion  today 
toward 8 to 9 billion by 2050, restruc-
turing energy uses and  sources will be
necessary to minimize global warming.

Earth  as  a  System Earth  is  a
planetary  system—with  linkages  be-
tween air, water, soil, rock, and living
things—that  changes  in  many  ways.
Understanding  the  Earth  system  and
how it changes is important if we are
to solve environmental problems such
as  climate  change  and  associated
global warming.

Sustainability A  relatively  stable
global climate is desired and necessary
for future generations of people and is
also necessary for healthy ecosystems.
Rapid or dramatic warming or cooling
of  the  climate  would  be  difﬁcult  for
society to adjust to. Presently, our en-
ergy policies of burning vast amounts
of  fossil  fuels  are  not  sustainable.  If
we continue to emit huge amounts of

Hazardous  Earth  Processes,
Risk Assessment, and Percep-
tion Global  warming  is  linked  to  a
variety  of  natural  hazards,  including
ﬂooding,  severe  storms,  and  coastal
erosion.  The  changes  in  risks  and  re-
sulting damages from natural hazards
that are likely to occur as the atmos-
phere  warms  are  being  studied.  Our
perception  of  hazards  will  change  as

the frequency and intensity of events
increase or decrease in the future.

Scientific  Knowledge  and  Val-
ues Scientiﬁc understanding of global
change  and  climate  change  has  im-
proved greatly in the past few years. Al-
though  details  are  sketchy,  we  have  a
good idea of the potential adverse con-
sequences of our present energy policy
of  burning  fossil  fuels.  Our  values  are
being tested as never before. Reducing
emissions of carbon dioxide will require
a new energy policy that some fear will
cause ﬁnancial damage to our economy.
Others believe the transition to alterna-
tive energy sources that do not pollute
the  environment  or  cause  climate
change  and  associated  global  warming

Learning Objectives
The study of geology and its relationship to speciﬁc functions of society, such as environmental
health, environmental impact, and land-use planning, relies on integrating what we have learned
throughout this book. In this sense, this chapter is a capstone. At a deeper level, relationships
between people and our environment provide insight into why we study environmental geology.
Hopefully, we will build on past successes and learn from our mistakes. In this chapter, we will

focus on the following learning objectives:

• Understand geologic

aspects of
environmental health,
air pollution, and waste
management

• Understand the

geologist’s role in
evaluating land for
appropriate uses

• Understand

environmental impact
analysis, including the

major components of an
environmental impact
statement and the
processes of scoping and
mitigation

• Know the processes of

law, particularly the use
of mediation and
negotiation to resolve
environmental conﬂicts
• Know the three steps we

can take to avert a

potential environmental
crisis, with potential loss
of food supply, caused
by the convergence of
human population
increase, reduction in
water resources, and
global warming

• Be able to discuss what
steps are necessary to
attain the goal of
sustainability

Case History
Radon Gas: The Stanley Watras Story

In December 1984, sci-
entists discovered that
radon (a radioactive
gas) from natural
sources (i.e., soil
and rock) may
enter the home
and possibly
present a seri-
ous health haz-
ard. The story
of Stanley 
Watras has
been told and
retold many
times, until it
is now part of
radon legend.1
Nevertheless, it
is worth repeat-
ing here. Stanley
Watras lived in Boy-
ertown, Pennsylva-
nia, and, in December
1984, had a job as tech-
nical advisor in the Limer-
ick nuclear power station. At
the entrance to the plant are ra-
diation detectors to ensure that no
radioactive materials leave the facility.
The reactor at the power plant had not
yet been turned on when Watras, on his
way into the plant, set off the alarms!

Testing of his clothing suggested that
the contamination could not have come
from the plant but must have come
from where he lived. Power company
ofﬁcials checking Watras’s home were
astounded to ﬁnd that the radiation
level of the indoor air was 3,200 pCi/L.
Scientists were very surprised because,
until then, they had not believed that
radon that naturally seeped into homes
could be hazardous to anyone. The
level of 3,200 pCi/L is 800 times higher
than the level of 4 pCi/L, considered as
a threshold for hazard by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. The
Watras home held the record for indoor
radon concentration until the latter
part of the 1980s, when a home in
Whispering Hills, New Jersey, was dis-
covered to have a radiation level of
3,500 pCi/L.2

The Watras family moved from the
home, and, through mitigation mea-
sures (e.g., sealing leaks and ventila-
tion), the radon level of the home was
reduced to a safe level. The Watras
family then moved back into the
home. It is reported that Stanley
started a ﬁrm that evaluated and mit-
igated radon in buildings, and that
the new work was a therapeutic expe-
rience linked to his personal experi-
ence with radon.

Since 1985, awareness of the
radon gas problem in the United
States has increased. Nevertheless,
people have a hard time focusing on a
problem that they can’t see, smell,
hear, or touch. The problem is fur-
ther compounded by the fact that
some property owners seem to be
more concerned about potential loss
of property values than the health
hazard. There is a considerable gap
between people’s perception of the
radon problem and the potential size
of the problem itself.

The radon problem is a good exam-

ple of how geology may be linked to
society. The gas is natural, so we can’t
blame people, economics, or politics
for the health hazard it produces. For-
tunately, radon is a hazard with a rela-
tively easy ﬁx. In this chapter, we will
discuss several ways geology interacts
with society:
• Environmental  health  (including

radon gas)

• Air pollution
• Waste management and environ-

mental law

• Site selection
• Environmental impact analysis
• Land use planning

19.1 Introduction
We live on the surface of Earth, which has developed
landforms, such as mountains, plains, river valleys,
hill slopes, and shorelines, through the interactions
of many geologic and biogeologic processes. In most
places, a biogeologic layer of Earth material that we
call soil covers the surface. Ever since people began
gathering  in  villages  that  became  cities,  practicing
agriculture,  and  manufacturing  products  from  a
variety  of  Earth  materials,  geology  has  played  an
important  role  in  society.  In  other  parts  of  this
book,  we  discussed  some  of  the  major  Earth
processes, including natural hazards, and resources,

such as minerals, water, and soil, and their interac-
tions  with  human  behavior  and  processes.  In  this
chapter,  we  will  further  examine  examples  of  rela-
tionships between geology and the needs of society.
We will begin with environmental health.

19.2 Geology and

Environmental Health

As  members  of  the  biological  community,  humans
have carved a niche in the biosphere—a niche that
is  highly  dependent  on  complex  interrelations
among the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and

lithosphere. Yet, we are only beginning to inquire into
and gain a basic understanding of the total range of
environmental factors that affect our health and well-
being. As we continue our exploration of the geologic
cycle—from  minute  quantities  of  elements  in  soil,
rocks, and water to regional patterns of climate, geol-
ogy, and topography—we are making important dis-
coveries about how these factors may inﬂuence death
rates and incidences of certain diseases. In the United
States alone, the death rate varies signiﬁcantly from
one area to another,3,4 and some of the variability re-
sults from the local, physical, biological, and chemical
environment  in  which  we  live  (see  A  Closer  Look:
Lead in the Environment).

At this point, it is useful to introduce a few basic
terms and deﬁnitions. For example, toxicology is the
science  involved  in  the  study  of  poisons,  or  toxins,
and their potential effects on people and ecosystems,
as  well  as  clinical,  economic,  industrial,  and  legal
problems associated with toxic materials in the envi-
ronment. A special type of toxin that causes cancer is
called a carcinogen; carcinogens are some of the most
feared and heavily regulated toxins in society today.
The concentration of a particular toxin or carcinogen
is often reported in units such as parts per million
(ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). These are incredibly
small numbers. For example, perhaps you are mak-
ing  popcorn  and  would  like  to  add  some  salt  to  it.
Using your standard 737 g (1 lb 10 oz) container of
iodized  salt,  you  want  to  season  the  popcorn  at  a
concentration  of  1  ppm.  To  set  that  concentration,
using the whole container of salt, you would have to
pop  approximately  737  metric  tons  of  kernels  of
corn,  more  than  6  million  quarter-pound  bags  of
popcorn! The average person has a hard time under-
standing that such small concentrations as parts per
million  or  parts  per  billion  of  a  chemical  can  cause
cancer  or  be  toxic.  Finally,  toxins  and  other  pollu-
tants in the atmosphere are usually measured as mi-
crograms  per  liter  (μg/L)  or  micrograms  per  cubic
meter (μg/m3) of air. Radioactive radon in air is an
exception;  radon  gas  is  reported  in  picoCuries  per
liter (pCi/L), a reference to the number of radioactive
disintegrations per second in a liter of air.

Disease has been described, from an environmen-
tal  perspective,  as  an  imbalance  resulting  from  a
poor adjustment between an individual and the en-
vironment.9 It seldom has a single cause. The geolo-
gist’s  contribution  to  our  understanding  of  its
causes helps isolate aspects of the geologic environ-
ment  that  may  inﬂuence  the  incidence  of  disease.

Geology and Environmental Health

665

This tremendously complex task requires sound sci-
entiﬁc inquiry, coupled with interdisciplinary research
with  physicians  and  other  scientists.  Although  the
picture is now rather vague, the possible rewards of
the developing ﬁeld of medical geology are exciting
and  are  contributing  in  many  ways  to  the  under-
standing of environmental health.

Some Geologic Factors 
of Environmental Health
The soil in which we cultivate plants for food, the rock
on which we build our homes and industries, the water
we  drink,  and  the  air  we  breathe  all  inﬂuence  our
chances  of  developing  serious  health  problems.  Con-
versely, these factors can also inﬂuence our chances of
living longer, more productive lives. Surprisingly, many
people still believe that soil, water, or air in a “natural,”
“pure,”  or  “virgin”  state  must  be  “good,”  and  that, 
if  human  activities  have  changed  or  modiﬁed  these
resources, they have become “contaminated” or
“polluted”  and,  therefore,  “bad.”  This  simple  di-
chotomy is by no means the entire story.9–11

Chronic Disease and 
the Geologic Environment
Health can be deﬁned as an organism’s state of adjust-
ment to its own internal environment and to its ex-
ternal  environment.  Observation  over  many  years
has suggested that some regional and local variations
in human chronic diseases, such as cancer and heart
disease, are related to the geologic environment. Al-
though  evidence  continues  to  accumulate  and  med-
ical geology is a rapidly growing ﬁeld, the exact nature
of many associations remains to be discovered. There
are three main reasons for the lack of conclusive re-
sults:  (1)  Hypotheses  generated  about  relationships
between the geologic environment and disease have
not  usually  been  speciﬁc  enough  to  be  tested  ade-
quately to make predictions beyond comparison be-
tween geochemical data and incidence of disease; (2)
there are many methodological difﬁculties in obtain-
ing reliable and comparable data for medical–geologi-
cal  studies;  and  (3)  there  are  signiﬁcant  problems
with  geographical  variability  in  disease.4 We  know
much less about geologic (i.e., biogeochemical) inﬂu-
ences on chronic disease than about the contribution
of other environmental factors, such as climate.

Although our evaluation of geologic contributions
to disease in some cases remains an educated guess,

Lead in the Environment

The incidence of lead poisoning is an
example of geologic, cultural, politi-
cal, and economic inﬂuences on pat-
terns of disease. The effects of lead
poisoning can include anemia, men-
tal retardation, and palsy. For
decades, lead was used in gasoline,
resulting in polluted soil near high-
ways. Until recently, lead was also
used in many other products, includ-
ing paints. Some children chewing on
these painted surfaces ingested lead
in toxic amounts. Lead is also found
in some moonshine whiskey and has
resulted in lead poisoning among
adults and even unborn or nursing
infants whose mothers drank it.5

It has been suggested that wide-

spread lead poisoning was one of the
reasons for the fall of the Roman Em-
pire. Some historians estimate that
the Romans produced about 55,000
metric tons of lead each year for sev-
eral hundred years. The Romans used
lead for pots, for wine cups, and in

cosmetics and medicines. The ruling
class also had water running through
lead pipes into their homes. Histori-
ans argue that gradual lead poison-
ing among the upper class resulted
in their eventual demise through
widespread stillbirths, deformities,
and brain damage. The high lead
content found in the bones of an-
cient Romans lends support to this
hypothesis.6 Further support of this
theory comes from a study of ice
cores from Greenland’s glaciers; for
the period 600 B.C. to A.D. 300 (time
of the Roman Empire), lead concen-
trations in the ice are significantly
higher than before the Roman 
Empire. This finding suggests that
lead mining and smelting during
the Roman Empire caused lead
contamination in the atmosphere
over the Northern Hemisphere.7
We have known for a long time
that, at high concentrations, lead is
an extremely toxic metal that causes

serious health problems. More
recently, it has been suggested that
lead in urban areas can also cause
social problems. In one study, chil-
dren with above-average lead con-
centrations in their bones were
found to be more likely to have at-
tention-deﬁcit disorder or delin-
quency problems and to exhibit ag-
gressive behavior than were children
with lower lead concentrations.8 On
the basis of this ﬁnding, some part of
the crime rate and aggressive behav-
ior of children in urban areas may be
attributed to environmental pollu-
tion, as well as to socioeconomic
conditions. If environmental pollu-
tion does contribute to social prob-
lems, then how we manage urban
environments is enormously signiﬁ-
cant. The idea that aggressive behav-
ior is due, in part, to our contami-
nated environment is controversial,
and additional studies are necessary
to verify these conclusions.

the  beneﬁt  of  learning  more  about  these  relation-
ships  is  obvious.  The  geographic  variations  in  the
incidence of heart disease in the United States may
be related to the geologic environment. In addition,
many forms of cancer result, in part, from environ-
mental  causes  (e.g.,  exposure  to  chemicals),  and
genetic factors are also important.

Heart Disease and 
the Geochemical Environment
Our  use  of  the  term  heart  disease here  includes
coronary  heart  disease  (CHD)  and  cardiovascular
disease (CVD). Variations in heart disease mortality
have generally shown interesting relationships with
the  chemistry  of  drinking  water—in  particular,
with the hardness of drinking water. Hardness is a

function  of  the  amount  of  calcium,  magnesium,
and iron that is dissolved in water. Higher concen-
trations  of  these  elements  produce  harder  water.
Water with low concentrations of these elements is
termed  soft. Studies  in  Japan,  England,  Wales,
Sweden,  and  the  United  States  all  conclude  that
communities  with  relatively  soft  water  have  a
higher  rate  of  heart  disease  than  do  communities
with harder water.

Perhaps the ﬁrst report of a relationship between
water  chemistry  and  cardiovascular  disease  came
from  Japan,  where  a  prevalent  cause  of  death  is
stroke,  a  sudden  loss  of  body  functions  caused  by
the  rupture  or  blockage  of  a  blood  vessel  in  the
brain.  The  geographic  variation  of  the  disease  in
Japan is related to the relative softness or hardness
of  river  water.  Figure  19.1 shows  that  areas  in

Geology and Environmental Health

667

Japan with high death rates due to stroke generally
correspond to areas of relatively soft water.12

The relatively soft water of the northeastern part
of Japan evidently stems from the sulfur-rich volcanic
rock  found  in  that  region.  Rivers  in  the  region  have
relatively  soft  water.  Rivers  in  Japan  that  ﬂow
through  sedimentary  rocks  have,  in  contrast,  rela-
tively hard water, as do most other rivers in the world.
A general inverse relationship between hard water
and death rates from heart disease is also present in
the United States.13,14 For example, similarly to the

Japanese report, a study in Ohio suggests that hard
water may inﬂuence the incidence of heart disease.15
The  Ohio  study  found  that  counties  with  relatively
soft drinking water, derived from coal-bearing rocks
in the southeastern part of the state, tend to have a
higher death rate due to heart attack than do coun-
ties with relatively hard drinking water, derived from
young glacial deposits (Figure 19.2). It is important
to realize, however, that this generally negative cor-
relation is not conclusive. A study in Indiana found a
small positive correlation between heart disease and

hardness of water, suggesting that many other vari-
ables  may  exert  considerable  inﬂuence  on  rates  of
heart disease.16

The  correlations  discussed  do  not  necessarily
show  a  cause-and-effect  relationship  between  the
geochemical environment and heart disease. If there
is  a  cause-and-effect  relationship,  we  do  not  know
its nature, but there are several possibilities:

• Soft  water  is  more  acidic  than  hard  water  and
may, through corrosion of pipes, release into the
water  trace  elements  that  cause  heart  disease.
• Some  other  characteristics  of  soft  water  may

contribute directly to heart disease.

• Some substances dissolved in hard water may

help prevent heart disease.

Of course, some combination of these and other
factors is also possible and is consistent with our ob-
servation  that  a  disease  may  have  several  causes.
Additional research is needed to prove the beneﬁt of
hard  water  and  to,  perhaps,  suggest  treatment  of
soft water to reduce heart disease.

Cancer and the Geochemical
Environment
Cancer tends to be strongly related to environmen-
tal  conditions.  However,  as  is  the  case  for  heart
disease, relationships between the geochemical en-
vironment  and  cancer  have  not  been  proved.  The
causes of the various types of cancers are undoubt-
edly  complex  and  involve  many  variables,  some  of
which  may  be  the  presence  or  absence  of  certain
Earth materials.

Cancer-causing, or carcinogenic, substances in the
environment have two origins: Some occur naturally
in Earth materials, such as soil and water; others are
released into the environment by human use. In re-
cent years, attention has been focused on the many
known  and  suspected  carcinogens  released  by
human  industrial  activities.  This  awareness  has
sometimes resulted in alarm concerning substances
whose  relationship  to  cancer  is  not  well  demon-
strated. This does not mean that all concern about
industrial carcinogens is misplaced. Recent informa-
tion suggests that variable concentrations of cancer-
causing  substances  may  be  found  in  much  of  our
drinking water. Carcinogens may or may not be in
our  drinking  water,  but,  certainly,  water  polluted
with  industrial  waste  containing  toxic  chemicals,

some of them possible carcinogens, is being released
into  our  surﬁcial  water  supplies.  The  Mississippi
River,  particularly,  has  pollution  problems.  Ironi-
cally, present methods of water treatment that use
chlorine  may  contribute  to  these  problems:  When
combined  with  chlorine,  some  industrial  waste
turns  into  cancer-producing  material.  In  addition,
antiquated  water-treatment  procedures  in  some
areas  fail  to  remove  certain  carcinogens.  Naturally
occurring airborne carcinogenic substances are also
found  in  some  of  our  homes  and  buildings  (see  A
Closer Look: Radon Gas).

19.3 Air Pollution: Introduction
and Geologic Perspective

As the fastest-moving dynamic medium in the envi-
ronment,  the  atmosphere  has  always  been  one  of
the most convenient places for people to dispose of
unwanted  materials.  Ever  since  humans  ﬁrst  used
ﬁre, the atmosphere has, all too often, been a sink
for waste disposal. With the rapid urbanization and
industrialization  of  the  past  two  centuries,  atmos-
pheric  circulation  has  often  proved  inadequate  to
dissipate human wastes, and urban air, in particular,
has become increasingly polluted.

Chemical  pollutants  can  be  thought  of  as  com-
pounds that are either in the wrong place or in the
wrong concentrations at the wrong time. As long as
a chemical is transported away or degraded rapidly
relative to its rate of production, there is no pollu-
tion problem. Pollutants that enter the atmosphere
through  natural  or  artiﬁcial  emissions  may  be  de-
graded by natural processes within the atmosphere,
as well as by the hydrologic and geochemical cycles.
Conversely,  pollutants  in  the  atmosphere  may  be-
come pollutants in the hydrologic and geochemical
cycles (as, for example, acid rain; see Chapter 16).

Today, air pollution is a well-known, serious health
hazard  in  many  large  cities.  For  example,  in  Los
Angeles, California, millions of people are regularly
exposed to unhealthy air. Although Los Angeles has
the country’s most serious air pollution problem, it
is  only  one  of  many  U.S.  cities  with  unhealthy  air.
Other U.S. cities with serious air pollution problems
include Houston, Texas; Baltimore, Maryland; Char-
lotte, North Carolina; and Atlanta, Georgia. With the
minor  exception  of  the  Paciﬁc  Northwest,  no  U.S.
region  is  free  from  air  pollution.27 Approximately

Air Pollution: Introduction and Geologic Perspective

Radon Gas

Radon gas is a signiﬁcant source of
indoor air pollution with strong links
to geology (see case history opening
this chapter). Radon is a naturally
occurring radioactive gas that is
colorless, odorless, and tasteless. 
Uranium-bearing rocks are the
source of the radon gas that contam-
inates many homes in the United
States.

Exposure to elevated concentra-
tions of radon is associated with in-
creased risk of lung cancer, particu-
larly for smokers. The risk is thought
to increase as the level of radon con-
centration, the length of exposure to
radon, and the amount of smoking
increase.17,18

In recent years, there have been
approximately 140,000 lung cancer
deaths each year in the United States.
Although smoking is the most impor-
tant factor associated with lung can-
cer, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) estimates that, per year,
7,000 to 30,000 of these lung cancer
deaths are related to exposure to
radon gas. One estimate is that expo-
sure to both tobacco and radon is ap-
proximately 10 times as hazardous as
exposure to either one of these pol-
lutants by itself. However, there have
been few direct studies linking radon
gas exposure in houses to increased
incidence of lung cancer. Estimates of
such linkage come from studies of
people who have experienced high
exposure to radiation through such
activities as mining uranium.

In terms of the implied risk, large
concentrations of radon are indeed
hazardous, and it has not been
shown that small concentrations are
harmless. The EPA has set 4.0 pi-
coCuries of radon gas per liter of air

(4.0 pCi/L) as the radioactivity level
beyond which radon gas is consid-
ered hazardous. The radioactivity
level of 4.0 pCi/L is only an estimate
of a concentration target to which in-
door levels should be reduced. The
average outdoor concentration of
radon gas is approximately 0.4 pCi/L,
and the average indoor level is about
1.0 pCi/L. The comparable risk at 
4.0 pCi/L, for a nonsmoker, is about
the same as the risk of drowning. For
a smoker, the comparable risk at this
level is about 100 times the risk of
dying in an airplane crash (Figure
19.A). The risk of radon exposure can
also be estimated according to the
number of people who might con-
tract lung cancer, as shown in Figure
19.A. These estimations have been
difﬁcult to verify. One U.S. study of
nonsmoking women reported that a
signiﬁcant positive relationship be-
tween radon exposure and lung can-
cer was not found.19 Another study in
Sweden reported a statistically signif-
icant positive relationship between
exposure to radon gas in homes and
lung cancer.20 The latter concluded
that residential exposure to radon
gas is an important contributing fac-
tor in the incidence of lung cancer in
the general population of Sweden.

The Geology of Radon Gas
Both rock type and geologic struc-
ture are important in determining
how much radon is likely to reach the
surface of Earth. Uranium-238 con-
centrations in rocks and soil can vary
greatly. Some rock types, such as
sandstone, generally contain less
than 1 ppm U-238. The actual
amount of radon that reaches the
surface of Earth is related to the con-

centration of uranium in the rock and
soil, as well as to the efﬁciency of the
transfer processes from the rock or
soil to soil–water and soil–gas.

Some regions of the United States

contain bedrock with an above-
average natural concentration of ura-
nium. The Reading Prong that covers
parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
and New York is known for elevated
concentrations of radon gas (Figure
19.B). The Reading Prong is a region
of linear, rounded hills and ridges
with relief of 100 to 200 m. The hills
and ridges are underlain by hard ig-
neous and metamorphic rock of Pre-
cambrian age with steep slopes
eroded by short, steep streams.

Two areas in Florida have elevated

concentrations of uranium, in addi-
tion to radioactive potassium from
phosphate-rich rocks. Many other
states, including Illinois, New Mexico,
South Dakota, North Dakota, and
Washington, also have identiﬁed
areas with elevated indoor radon
concentrations. One type of dark
shale found in the Santa Barbara, Cal-
ifornia, area has been identiﬁed as a
signiﬁcant radon gas producer.

Geologic structures such as shear
zones, fracture zones, and faults are
commonly enriched with uranium
and can produce elevated concentra-
tions of radon gas in the overlying
soils.21,22 One study in southern Vir-
ginia found that shear zones in gran-
ite rock are associated with as much
as a tenfold increase in the concen-
tration of radon in overlying soils.
Furthermore, one of the highest in-
door levels of radon in the United
States is identiﬁed over shear zones
in Boyertown, Pennsylvania.22 In

FIGURE 19.A Estimated risk associated with radon These estimates are calculated as
long-term exposure risks for a person living about 70 years and spending about 75 percent of the
time in the home with a designated level of radon. (From U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
1986. A Citizen’s Guide to Radon. OPA-86-004)

highest concentrations of in-
house radon measured to
date occurs at the crest of an
active fold (i.e., anticline) in-
volving superﬁcial sand beds
that overlie organic-rich shale
at shallow depth. It is hypoth-
esized that open tension frac-
tures at the crest of the fold
allow the radon gas to diffuse
upward to the surface.

The amount of radon gas

that escapes from bedrock
and soil particles is greatly 
inﬂuenced by water content.
Relatively high moisture con-
tent favors the trapping of
radon gas in the spaces be-
tween soil and fractures in
rocks. This results because the
presence of water greatly 
reduces the distance that
radon can travel as a result of
radioactive decay from its par-
ent material, such as radium-
226. Movement of radon gas
from fractures in rock and
pore spaces in soil is facilitated
by relatively low moisture con-
tent. That is, the process of dif-
fusion of radon gas is much
greater in unsaturated mater-
ial. Thus, the moisture content
affects the amount of radon
that may reach the surface of
Earth in two opposing ways:
1. High moisture content

increases the chances of
radon entering and resid-
ing in the pore spaces in
rock fractures or between
soil grains.

2. High moisture content

tends to inhibit radon from
moving through the pore
spaces in rocks and soils.

As a result of these two fac-
tors, there is an optimal water
content that will result in the
maximum amount of radon

How Radon Gas Enters Homes
Radon gas enters homes by three
major pathways (Figure 19.C):23
• As a gas, migrating up from soil
and rocks into basements and
other parts of houses

• In groundwater pumped into wells
• In construction materials, such 

as building blocks, made of
substances that emit radon gas
Most of the early interest in radon
gas in homes was initiated because of
the use of building materials poten-
tially containing high concentrations
of radium, a product of the radioactive
decay of uranium (see Chapter 16).

There is concern that granite

countertops, so popular in kitchens
today, are contaminating homes with
dangerous levels of radon gas. Gran-
ite does have uranium in some of the
minerals that make up the rock.
Granite rock, with fracture zones that
allow radon gas to migrate upward,

ing the house. (From Environmental Protection Agency)

CHAPTER 19

has been recognized in southern Vir-
ginia as a localized radon hazard. The
important observation is that, in
order to move up from soil and rock
into our homes, radon gas needs
pathways, such as fractures in the
rock or open spaces between soil
particles. Granite that is used in
countertops is not very porous. If the
rock has open fractures, it will break
easily and can’t be used for counter-
tops. Therefore, even though granite
has some uranium in the rock, it will
generally yield very little radon gas.
Radon entering homes from the soil
beneath homes over weathered ura-
nium-bearing rocks (i.e., granite or
sedimentary rocks, such as some
shale) is a signiﬁcant public health
risk. However, according to the EPA,
the risk from granite countertops or
other building materials is not
thought to be a serious problem.
Radon is commonly found in

homes because it is a gas that can
move through the small openings in
soils and rocks. Radon migrates up
with soil gases and seeps through
concrete ﬂoors and foundations,
ﬂoor drains, or small cracks and pores
in block walls. Radon enters homes
for the same reason that smoke goes
up a chimney, in a process known as
the chimney, or stack, effect: Houses
are generally warmer than the sur-
rounding soil and rock, so, as the
gases and air rise, radon is drawn into
the house. Wind is an additional fac-
tor in radon contamination because
it increases air ﬂow into and out of
buildings. Radon also enters homes
through the water supply, particu-
larly if the home is supplied by a pri-
vate well; however, this contribution
is usually much smaller than the con-
tribution of gas seeping up through

house foundations. Radon is released
into the air when the water is used
for daily functions such as showering,
dishwashing, and clothes washing. In
general, approximately 10,000 pCi/L
of radon in water will produce about
1 pCi/L of radon in indoor air.

Scope and Perception of the
Problem
Since 1985, awareness of radon gas
has increased in the United States.
Nevertheless, people have a difﬁcult
time focusing on a problem that they
cannot see, smell, hear, or touch.
There is no good estimate of the
number of homes in the United
States that may have elevated con-
centrations of radon gas. The tests
that have been done indicate that
approximately 1 in 12 homes sur-
veyed have an indoor radon level
above 4 pCi/L. If this rate is a good
average, then approximately 7 mil-
lion homes in the United States
would have elevated rates, and mil-
lions more will need to be tested.

Reducing Concentrations of
Radon Gas in Homes
A successful program to reduce or
limit a potential hazard from radon
gas in homes focuses on three major
strategies:24,25
• Improving home ventilation by
keeping more windows open or
using fans

• Locating and sealing points of

radon gas entry

• Using construction methods that

provide a venting system
The simplest method of reducing

the radon concentration is to in-
crease the ventilation in the home.

Sometimes this is sufﬁcient to solve
the problem. Sealing cracks in the
foundation can also reduce radon
entry, particularly if it is done in spe-
ciﬁc sites where the radon is actually
entering the house. Detectors are
available to help identify such loca-
tions. Unfortunately, this method
often fails to solve the problem, and
new cracks may form. A variety of
construction options are open to the
homeowner, including installing
venting systems in a basement or
crawl space. If the house is built on a
slab, then subslab ventilation sys-
tems may be installed.

There is good and bad news con-
cerning radon gas. The bad news is
that many parts of the United States
and other parts of the world have rel-
atively high emissions of radon gas
from soil and rocks, and the radiation
is producing a hazard in homes. The
good news is that, in most cases, the
problem can be ﬁxed relatively easily.
Even if a ventilation system is re-
quired, it costs only a few thousand
dollars, generally a small percentage
of the value of the home.

Future research may show that

health risks from radon gas exposure
are not as great as predicted by the
EPA. Some scientists are skeptical and
think that the hazard level of 4 pCi/L
may be set too low.26 Nonetheless, it
is important for people to become in-
formed about this potential problem.
Taking appropriate action to deal
with the possibility of radon gas in
homes is difﬁcult; people seem to be
more concerned with property val-
ues than with health issues. Both rec-
ognizing the whole picture and
knowing that reducing radon gas is a
solvable problem can reduce our
fears about radon.

150 million people in the United States are exposed
to  air  pollution  that  may  cause  lung  disease,  con-
tributing  to  more  than  300,000  deaths  per  year.

Some  estimates  of  the  health  cost  associated  with
air  pollution  in  the  United  States  place  it  at  about
$50 billion per year.

Air Pollution: Introduction and Geologic Perspective

673

Effects  on  Human  Artifacts. The  effects  of  air
pollution on buildings and monuments include dis-
coloration, erosion, and decomposition of construc-
tion  materials,  as  discussed  in  the  section  on  acid
rain in Chapter 16.

Aesthetic Effects. Air pollutants affect visual re-
sources by discoloring the atmosphere and reducing
visual range and atmospheric clarity. We cannot see
as far in polluted air as in clean air, and what we do
see  has  less  color  contrast.  Once  limited  to  cities,
these  effects  now  extend  even  to  the  wide-open
spaces of the United States. For example, near the
junction  of  New  Mexico,  Arizona,  Colorado,  and
Utah,  emissions  from  the  Four  Corners  fossil
fuel–burning power plant are altering air clarity in
an area where, on a clear day, visibility was once 80
km (50 mi) from a mountaintop.28,29

Sources of Air Pollution
The two primary types of air pollution sources are
stationary  and  mobile.  Stationary  sources include
those with a relatively ﬁxed location, such as point
sources,  fugitive  sources, and  area  sources. Point
sources emit air pollutants from one or more discrete
controllable sites, such as the smokestacks of indus-
trial power plants. Fugitive sources generate air pol-
lutants from open areas exposed to wind processes.
Examples  include  dirt  roads,  construction  sites,
farmlands,  storage  piles,  and  surface  mines.  Area
sources are  locations  that  emit  air  pollutants  from
several sources within a well-deﬁned area, as, for ex-
ample, small urban communities or areas of intense
industrialization  within  an  urban  complex.  Mobile
sources move from place to place while yielding emis-
sions. Mobile sources of pollution include automo-
biles, aircraft, ships, and trains.29

Air Pollutants
The  major  air  pollutants  occur  either  in  gaseous
form or as particulate matter (PM). The gaseous pol-
lutants include sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides
(NOx, where x represents a variable number of oxy-
gen  atoms,  usually  1,  2,  or  3),  carbon  monoxide
(CO),  ozone  (O3),  volatile  organic  compounds  (re-
ferred to as VOCs), hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S), and hy-
drogen ﬂuoride (HF). Particulate-matter pollutants

are  particles  of  organic  or  inorganic  solid  or  liquid
substances.  Those  that  are  less  than  10  μm  (i.e.,
10 millionths of a meter) in diameter are designated
PM 10. Those that are less than 2.5 μm in diameter
are designated PM 2.5. We will discuss particulates
in  some  detail,  as  they  often  have  signiﬁcant  geo-
logic components.

Air Toxins
Air pollutants known to cause cancer or other seri-
ous health problems are classiﬁed as air toxins. This
category of air pollutants is classiﬁed by (1) whether
they cause cancer and (2) their tendency to cause res-
piratory, reproductive, neurological, or immune dis-
eases. Toxicity is based on exposure to an air toxin by
breathing the pollutant. The extent to which a spe-
ciﬁc toxin affects the health of an individual depends
on  the  toxicity  of  the  pollutant,  the  frequency  and
duration of exposure, the concentration of the pollu-
tant a person is exposed to, and the general health of
the person. More than 150 chemicals, including am-
monia,  chlorine  gases,  and  hydrogen  sulﬁde,  are
evaluated for toxicity. The four states with the most
serious  exposure  to  air  toxins  are  California,  New
York,  Oregon,  and  New  Jersey.  The  three  cleanest
states  are  Montana,  Wyoming,  and  South  Dakota.
Evaluation  of  air  toxins  as  a  category  of  air  pollu-
tants is a relative new activity but will add increased
understanding  of  toxic  air  pollution  problems  and,
hopefully, lead to improved air quality.30

Primary and Secondary Pollutants
Air  pollutants  may  be  classiﬁed  as  primary  and  sec-
ondary, according to their origin. Primary pollutants
are emitted directly into the air and include particu-
late matter, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, nitrogen
oxides, and hydrocarbons. Secondary pollutants are
produced when primary pollutants react with normal
atmospheric  compounds.  For  example,  ozone  forms
over  urban  areas  through  reactions  among  primary
pollutants,  sunlight,  and  natural  atmospheric  gases.
Thus,  ozone  becomes  a  serious  secondary  pollution
problem on bright, sunny days in areas with abundant
primary  pollution.  Although  particularly  well  docu-
mented  for  southern  California  cities  such  as  Los
Angeles, ozone becomes a secondary pollutant world-
wide under appropriate conditions.

The  primary  pollutants  that  account  for  nearly
all  air  pollution  problems  are  carbon  monoxide,
nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic com-
pounds, and particulates. Each year, about 50 million
metric tons of these materials enter the atmosphere
of  the  United  States  as  a  result  of  human-related
processes. At ﬁrst glance, this amount of pollutants
appears to be very large. However, if uniformly dis-
tributed  in  the  atmosphere,  this  would  amount  to
only  a  few  parts  per  million  by  weight.  Unfortu-
nately, pollutants are not uniformly distributed but
tend to be released, produced, and concentrated lo-
cally or regionally. For example, large cities’ weather
and climatic conditions combine with urbanization
and industrialization to produce local air pollution
problems.

Major air pollutants, in terms of their natural and
human-induced  components,  and  their  effects  on
people,  plants,  and  materials,  are  shown  in  Table
19.1 and Table 19.2.

Particulate Matter: PM 10 
and PM 2.5
Particulate-matter  pollutants are  small  particles  of
solid or liquid substances that are designated PM 10
or  PM  2.5,  depending  on  size.  PM  10  particles  are
less than 10 μm in diameter; they are released into
the  atmosphere  by  many  natural  processes  and
human activities. About 85 percent of emissions of
particulates  are  from  natural  sources  (Table  19.1).
Dust  from  eroding  land,  volcanic  eruptions,  ﬁres,
and modern farming all add large amounts of partic-
ulate  matter  to  the  air.  Burning  of  crop  residue
(from  wheat  ﬁelds  in  North  Dakota,  bluegrass  in
Idaho,  rice  in  California,  and  sugarcane  in  Hawaii)
emits large amounts of PM 2.5 from smoke and soot
into the atmosphere. Nearly all industrial processes
release particulates into the atmosphere, as does the
burning  of  fossil  fuels.  Much  particulate  matter  is
easily  visible  as  smoke,  soot,  or  dust,  but  some

particulate matter is not readily apparent. Particu-
lates  include  airborne  asbestos  particles  and  small
particles  of  heavy  metals,  such  as  arsenic,  copper,
lead,  and  zinc,  which  are  usually  emitted  from  in-
dustrial facilities, such as smelters.

Very  ﬁne  particle  pollutants  with  particles  less
than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM 2.5) cause the great-
est  damage  to  the  lungs.  Sulfates  and  nitrates  are
two of the most signiﬁcant ﬁne-particle pollutants.
Both of these compounds are mostly secondary pol-
lutants  and  are  produced 
in  the  atmosphere
through chemical reactions between sulfur dioxide
or  nitrogen  oxides  and  normal  atmospheric  con-
stituents. Sulfates, in the form of sulfuric acid and
nitric  acid,  are  formed  by  these  reactions  and  are
then  precipitated  as  acid  rain.29 When  measured,
particulate matter is often referred to as total sus-
pended particulates (TSP).

Particulates  affect  human  health,  ecosystems,
and the biosphere (Table 19.2). Particulates enter-
ing  the  lungs  may  lodge  there,  producing  chronic
effects on respiration; asbestos is particularly dan-
gerous in this regard. Dust raised by road building
and plowing is deposited on the surfaces of green
plants,  possibly  interfering  with  both  the  plants’
absorption of carbon dioxide and oxygen and their
release of water; heavy dust may affect the breath-
ing of animals. Particulates in the United States are
believed to contribute to the deaths of 60,000 peo-
ple  per  year.  In  cities,  it  is  estimated  that  up  to 
9  percent  of  all  deaths  are  associated  with  parti-
cles,  and  the  risk  of  mortality  is  15  percent  to 
25 percent higher in cities with the highest levels
of ﬁne-particulate pollution.31

Particulates  associated  with  large  construction
projects may kill organisms and damage large areas,
changing species composition, altering food chains,
and  generally  affecting  ecosystems.  In  addition,
modern industrial processes have greatly increased
the total suspended particulates in the atmosphere.
Particulates block sunlight and, thus, cause changes
in  climate,  which  can  have  lasting  effects  on  the
biosphere.32

result, asbestos ﬁbers are found throughout indus-
trialized  countries,  especially  in  European  and
North  American  urban  environments.  In  one  case,
asbestos products were sold in burlap bags that were
eventually reused in plant nurseries and other sec-
ondary  businesses,  thereby  further  spreading  the
pollutant.  Some  asbestos  particles  are  believed  to
cause  cancer,  so  asbestos  must  be  carefully  con-
trolled (see Chapter 3).

Lead. Lead is  an  important  constituent  of  auto-
mobile  batteries  and  other  industrial  products.
When used as a gasoline additive, lead improves the
performance of automobile engines. Previously, in
the  United  States,  lead  emitted  into  the  environ-
ment via automobile exhaust was widely deposited,
reaching high levels in soils and waters along road-
ways (see A Closer Look: Lead in the Environment).
Once released, lead can be transported through the
air as particulates to be taken up by plants through
the soil or deposited directly on plant leaves. Thus,
it  enters  terrestrial  food  chains  and  may  be  in-
gested by people. When lead is carried by streams
and  rivers,  deposited  in  quiet  waters,  or  trans-
ported  to  the  ocean  or  lakes,  it  is  taken  up  by
aquatic  organisms  and,  thus,  enters  aquatic  food
chains. Although lead is no longer used in gasoline
in the United States, it is still used in other parts of
the world.

Cadmium. Some  of  the  cadmium in  the  environ-
ment comes from coal ash, which is widely dispersed
from smokestacks and chimneys. Cadmium exists as
a trace element in the coal, at a very low concentra-
tion of 0.05 parts per million. When the coal ash falls
on  plants,  the  cadmium  is  incorporated  into  plant
tissue  and  concentrated.  As  cadmium  moves  up
through the food chain, it undergoes biomagniﬁcation
at each higher level. Herbivores have approximately
three  times  the  concentration  of  green  plants,  and
carnivores have approximately three times the con-
centration of herbivores.

Asbestos. Asbestos particles  have  only  recently
been recognized as a signiﬁcant hazard to humans.
In the past, asbestos was treated rather casually, and
people  working  in  asbestos  plants  were  not  pro-
tected from dust. Asbestos was used in building in-
sulation  and  in  brake  pads  for  automobiles.  As  a

Urban Air Pollution
Air  pollution  is  not  distributed  uniformly  around
the world. Much of it is concentrated in and around
urban areas, where automobiles and heavy industry
emit enormous amounts of waste into the environ-
ment.  The  visible  air  pollution  known  as  smog  is

present in nearly all urbanized areas, although it is
much worse in some regions than in others. In this
section, we will consider the factors contributing to
urban air pollution and discuss the composition and
formation of smog.

Inﬂuence of Meteorology 
and Topography
The extent to which air pollution occurs in an urban
area depends largely on emission rates, topography,
and weather conditions; these factors determine the
rate at which pollutants are concentrated and trans-
ported  away  from  their  sources  or  converted  to
harmless  compounds  in  the  air.  When  the  rate  of
pollutant production exceeds the rates of transport
and chemical transformation, dangerous conditions
can develop.

Meteorological conditions can determine whether
air  pollution  is  only  a  nuisance  or  a  major  health
problem. Most pollution periods in the Los Angeles
Basin  and  other  smoggy  areas  do  not  cause  large
numbers  of  deaths.  However,  serious  pollution
events can develop over a period of days and lead to
an increase in deaths and illnesses.

Restricted  circulation  in  the  lower  atmosphere
due to the formation of an inversion layer may lead
to a pollution event. An atmospheric inversion oc-
curs  when  warm  air  overlies  cool  air.  An  inversion
layer is particularly a problem when there is a stag-
nated air mass. Figure 19.3 shows two types of de-
veloping  inversions  that  may  worsen  air  pollution
problems. Figure 19.3a shows descending warm air
from inland warm arid areas forming a semiperma-
nent inversion layer. Because the mountains act as a
barrier  to  the  pollution,  polluted  air  moving  in  re-
sponse to the sea breeze and other processes tends
to move up canyons, where it is trapped. The air pol-
lution  that  develops  occurs  primarily  during  the
summer and fall, when warm inland air comes over
the mountains and overlies cooler coastal air, form-
ing the inversion. This example is representative of
the situation in the Los Angeles area.

Figure  19.3b shows  a  valley  with  relatively  cool
air overlain by warm air, a situation that can occur
in several ways. When cloud cover associated with a
stagnant air mass develops over an urban area, the
incoming  solar  radiation  is  blocked  by  the  clouds,
which absorb some of the energy and, thus, heat up.
On or near the ground, the air cools. If the humidity

is  high,  a  thick  fog  may  form  as  the  air  cools.  Be-
cause the air is cool, people living in the city burn
more fuel to heat their homes and factories, thus de-
livering  more  pollutants  into  the  atmosphere.  As
long as the stagnant conditions exist, the pollutants
continue to accumulate.

Potential for Urban Air Pollution
The potential for air pollution in urban areas, as il-
lustrated  in  Figure  19.4,  is  determined  by  the  fol-
lowing factors:

• Rate of pollutant emissions
• Distance  that  a  mass  of  air  moves  through

urban air pollution sources
• Average speed of the wind
• Height of the mixing layer—that is, the height
to  which  potential  pollutants  may  be  thor-
oughly mixed in the lower atmosphere

If we assume that there is a constant rate of emis-
sion  of  air  pollutants,  the  mass  of  air  will  collect
more and more pollutants as it moves through the
urban area. Thus, the concentration of pollutants in
the air is directly proportional to the ﬁrst two fac-
tors:  As  either  the  emission  rate  or  the  downwind
travel distance increases, so does the concentration
of  pollutants.  Conversely,  city  air  pollution  de-
creases with increased wind velocity and the height
of mixing. The stronger the wind and the higher the
mixing layer, the lower the pollution.

If  an  inversion  layer  is  present  near  a  geologic
barrier such as a mountain, a “chimney effect” may
let  the  pollutants  spill  over  the  top  of  the  barrier

(see Figure 19.4). This effect has been noticed in the
Los Angeles Basin, where pollutants can climb sev-
eral  thousand  meters,  damaging  mountain  pine
trees and other vegetation.

Smog Production
Wherever many sources are producing air pollutants
over  a  wide  area—as,  for  example,  automobiles  in
Los Angeles—there is the potential for the develop-
ment  of  smog.  The  two  major  types  of  smog  are
sulfurous  smog,  sometimes  referred  to  as  London-
type smog or gray air, and photochemical smog, some-
times called L.A.-type smog or brown air. Sulfurous
smog is primarily produced by burning coal or oil at
large  power  plants.  Under  certain  meteorological
conditions,  the  sulfur  oxides  and  particulates  pro-
duced by this burning combine to produce concen-
trated sulfurous smog.

Reactions that produce photochemical smog are
complex, involving nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocar-
bons,  and  solar  radiation.  Development  of  photo-
chemical  smog  is  related  to  automobile  use.  In
southern  California,  for  example,  when  commuter
trafﬁc begins to build up early in the morning, the
concentrations of nitrogen oxide (NO) and hydrocar-
bons  begin  to  increase.  At  the  same  time,  the
amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) may decrease, due
to the sunlight-driven reaction of NO2 that produces
NO  plus  atomic  oxygen  (O).  The  atomic  oxygen  is
then free to combine with molecular oxygen to form
ozone (O3), increasing ozone levels after sunrise. By
midmorning, oxidized hydrocarbons react with NO
to increase the concentration of NO2. This reaction
causes the NO concentration to decrease and allows

Air Pollution: Introduction and Geologic Perspective

679

ozone to build up, producing a midday peak in ozone
and a minimum in NO. As the smog matures, visibil-
ity is reduced by light-scattering from small particles.

Future of Air Pollution 
in Urban Areas
Air  pollution  levels  in  many  cities  in  the  United
States and other developed countries have a mixed
but,  generally,  improving  record.  Data  from  major

U.S.  metropolitan  areas  in  recent  years  show  a  de-
cline  in  the  total  number  of  days  characterized  as
unhealthful  and  very  unhealthful,  suggesting  that
the nation’s air quality is improving (Figure 19.5a).
This  suggested  improvement  has  occurred  despite
the  fact  that  there  are  many  more  motor  vehicles,
population has increased, and energy consumption
has increased (Figure 19.5b). However, most major
urban areas, such as New York and Los Angeles, still
have unhealthy air much of the time. Furthermore,

many U.S. cities have poor air quality at least 30 days
per  year.  According  to  this  criterion,  millions  of
Americans still live in cities that have hazardous air
pollution for a signiﬁcant portion of each year.27

The encouraging news is that emissions of some
major  air  pollutants  in  the  United  States  are  de-
creasing. For example (Figure 19.5a):33

• SO2 emissions  since  1970  have  declined  57
percent as a result of burning less coal, using
low-sulfur  coal,  and  treating  effluent  gases
from  power  plants  before  release  into  the 
environment.

• Emissions  of  volatile  organic  compounds  (in-
cluding  hydrocarbons)  have  decreased  since
1970 to levels not recorded since the 1940s. A
decrease  of  about  47  percent  has  resulted  in
part from the successful control of automobile
emissions  and  substitutions  of  water-based
components  instead  of  VOC  components  in
products such as asphalt.

• Lead  emissions  have  decreased  by  99  percent
since 1980, mostly as a result of removing lead
from gasoline.

• Emissions  of  nitrogen  oxides  have  been  re-
duced by 40 percent since 1980, mostly as a re-
sult  of  emission  controls  in  automobiles  and
power plants.

• Concentrations  of  ozone  (a  secondary  pollu-
tant in the lower atmosphere) since 1990 have
been reduced about 9 percent as a result of re-
ducing emissions of nitrogen oxides from au-
tomobiles.

• Human-caused emissions of particulates (most
of  which  are  natural)  have  been  reduced  by
about 60 percent as a result of improved emis-
sion control measures from a variety of sources.

Indoor Air Pollution
Indoor air pollution is one of the most serious en-
vironmental  health  hazards  that  people  face  in
their  homes  and  workplaces.34,35 In  recent  years,
buildings  have  been  constructed  more  tightly,
often  with  windows  that  cannot  be  opened,  to
save energy. As a result, in many buildings, air is
filtered.  Unless  filters  are  maintained  properly,
indoor  air  can  become  polluted  with  a  variety  of
substances,  including  smoke,  chemicals,  disease-
carrying organisms, and radon, a naturally occur-
ring radioactive gas suspected of causing lung and

other  cancers  (see  A  Closer  Look:  Radon  Gas).  It
was shown that the virus responsible for the respi-
ratory infection known as Legionnaires’ disease is
transported  through  air  filters  and  ventilation
systems of buildings.

A  variety  of  materials  found  in  our  buildings
may  release  minute  amounts  of  chemicals  and
other materials into the nearby air. In some build-
ings, asbestos ﬁbers are slowly released from insu-
lation  and  other  fixtures;  people  exposed  to  a
particular type of asbestos ﬁber may develop a rare
form  of  lung  cancer.  The  poisonous  gases  carbon
monoxide and nitrogen dioxide may be released in
homes from unvented or poorly vented gas stoves,
furnaces, or water heaters. Formaldehyde, present
in  some  insulation  materials  and  wood  products
used in home construction, is known to irritate the
ears,  nose,  and  throat.  Radon  is  present  in  some
building  materials,  such  as  concrete  blocks  and
bricks  manufactured  from  materials  with  a  high
radon  concentration.  Buildings  that  lack  systems
that  recirculate  clean  air  are  likely  to  have  indoor
pollution  problems.  Improvements  in  indoor  air
quality have been developed; most of these stress
improved  clean  air  circulation  and  reduced  pollu-
tant emissions.

Interestingly,  indoor  air  pollution  existed  cen-
turies ago. In 1972, the body of a fourth-century Es-
kimo woman was discovered on St. Lawrence Island
in the Bering Sea. The woman evidently was killed
during  an  earthquake  or  a  landslide,  and  her  body
was  frozen  soon  after  death.  Detailed  autopsies
showed  that  the  woman  suffered  from  black  lung
disease, which afﬂicts some coal miners today. An-
thropologists and medical personnel concluded that
the woman breathed highly polluted air for a num-
ber of years. They speculated that the air pollution
was, in part, due to hazardous fumes given off from
lamps that burned seal and whale blubber.36

19.4 Waste Management 

and Geology

People in the United States and throughout the rest
of  the  world  are  facing  a  tremendous  solid-waste
disposal  problem,  particularly  in  growing  urban
areas.  The  problem  boils  down  to  the  simple  fact
that urban areas are producing too much waste, and
there  is  too  little  acceptable  space  (often  from  a

social perspective more than a physical shortage of
space)  for  disposal.  About  half  the  cities  in  the
United  States  are  estimated  to  be  running  out  of
landﬁll  space.  Cost  is  another  limiting  factor:  Ex-
penditures for landﬁll disposal have skyrocketed in
recent years.37

All types of societies produce waste, but indus-
trialization  and  urbanization  have  caused  an  ever-
increasing  efﬂuence  that  has  greatly  compounded
the problem of waste management. Although tremen-
dous quantities of liquid and solid waste from mu-
nicipal, industrial, and agricultural sources are being
collected and recycled, treated, or disposed of, new
and innovative programs are necessary if we are to
keep  ahead  of  what  might  be  called  a  waste  crisis.
Disposal  or  treatment  of  liquid  and  solid  waste  by
federal, state, and municipal agencies costs billions
of  dollars  every  year.  In  fact,  it  is  one  of  the  most
costly environmental expenditures of governments,
accounting for the majority of total environmental
expenditures.

A  possible  solution  to  the  solid  waste  problem
would be to develop new disposal facilities. Unfortu-
nately,  no  one  wants  to  live  near  a  waste  disposal
site, be it a sanitary landﬁll for municipal waste, an
incinerator  facility  that  can  reduce  the  volume  of
waste by 75 percent, or a disposal operation for haz-
ardous  chemical  materials.  This  obviously  creates
serious siting problems, even if the local geographic,
geologic,  and  hydrologic  environment  is  favorable.
The siting problem also involves issues of social jus-
tice.  Waste-management  facilities  are  all  too  fre-
quently located in areas where the residents are of
low social and economic status or belong to a minor-
ity ethnic group or race.

Integrated Waste Management
There  is  a  growing  awareness  that  many  of  our
waste-management  programs  simply  involve  mov-
ing waste from one site to another and not properly
disposing of it. For example, waste from urban areas
may be placed in landﬁlls, but, eventually, these may
cause further problems because of the production of
methane gas (which is a resource, if managed prop-
erly) or noxious liquids that leak from the site to con-
taminate  the  surrounding  areas.  Disposal  sites  are
also capable of producing signiﬁcant air pollution. It
is safe to assume that waste management is going to
be  a  public  concern  for  a  long  time.  Of  particular

Waste Management and Geology

681

importance  will  be  the  development  of  new  meth-
ods  of  waste  management  that  will  not  endanger
the public health or cause a nuisance.

Integrated waste management (IWM) emerged
in  the  1980s  as  a  set  of  management  alternatives,
including  reducing  resources,  reusing,  recycling,
composting, landﬁlling, and incinerating.37 Reduce,
reuse, and recycle are the three Rs of IWM. Recy-
cling can reduce the weight of urban refuse disposed
in landﬁlls by approximately 50 percent.

The  recycling  component  of  IWM,  which  has
been seriously pursued for several decades, has gen-
erated  entire  systems  of  waste  management  that
have  produced  tens  of  thousands  of  jobs  while  re-
ducing  the  amount  of  urban  waste  from  homes  in
the United States sent to landﬁlls from 90 percent
in  the  1980s  to  about  65  percent  today.  In  fact,
many ﬁrms have combined waste reduction with re-
cycling to reduce the waste they deliver to landﬁlls
by  over  50  percent.  Despite  this  success,  IWM  is
criticized  for  not  effectively  advancing  policies  to
prevent waste production by overemphasizing recy-
cling. In the long term, waste management policies
that  rely  on  recycling  cannot  be  successful.  If  we
continue with today’s management of waste, in ap-
proximately  50  to  70  years,  when  the  U.S.  popula-
tion  has  doubled  again,  we  will  be  producing  the
same  volume  of  waste  sent  to  landﬁlls  that  we  do
today, given a 50 percent rate of recycling. Clearly,
emphasizing recycling is not a sustainable solution
to  our  waste  problem.  With  this  in  mind,  the  con-
cept of IWM needs to be rethought and expanded to
include what is termed materials management.38

Materials Management
Materials management is part of IWM, but it pro-
vides  a  new  goal.  That  goal  is  zero  production  of
waste, so that what is now thought of as waste will
be  a  resource!  This  is  a  visionary  goal,  requiring  a
more  sustainable  use  of  materials,  combined  with
resource conservation. It is believed that materials
management as an extension of IWM can be estab-
lished by:38

• Eliminating  subsidies  for  extraction  of  virgin

materials, such as timber, minerals, and oil.

• Establishing  “green  building”  incentives  that
use  recycled  materials  and  products  in  new
construction.

• Establishing ﬁnancial penalties for production
of products that do not meet the objectives of
material management practices.

• Providing  ﬁnancial  incentives  for  industrial
practices  and  products  that  beneﬁt  the  envi-
ronment  by  enhancing  sustainability,  such  as
encouraging  products  that  reduce  waste  pro-
duction and use recycled materials.

• Providing incentives for the production of new
jobs  in  the  technology  of  materials  manage-
ment, as well as incentives for practicing reduc-
ing,  recycling,  and  reusing  resources.  This  is
the essence of materials management and sus-
tainable resource utilization.

The  concept  of  materials  management  for  “zero
waste” is part of what is known as industrial ecology.
The idea is to produce urban and industrial systems
that  model  natural  ecosystems,  where  waste  from
one part of the system is a resource for another part.
With this introduction to modern trends and in-
tegrated  waste  management,  it  is  advantageous  to
break  the  management  treatment  and  disposal  of
waste into two main categories: solid waste disposal
and hazardous waste management.

Solid Waste Disposal
Disposal of solid waste is primarily an urban problem.
Figure  19.6 summarizes  major  sources  and  types
of  solid  waste,  and  Table  19.3 lists  the  generalized

composition of solid waste (by weight, before recy-
cling) in 1986 and 2008. We emphasize that this is
only an average composition, and considerable vari-
ation can be expected because of differences in such

factors as land use, economic base, industrial activ-
ity, climate, and season of the year. It is no surprise
that paper is by far the most abundant solid waste.
Plastics  have  increased  by  about  70  percent  since
1986, with a tremendous increase in plastic contain-
ers, such as bottles. All this plastic is not going un-
noticed. There is an emerging industry involved in
recycling  waste  plastic.  Plastic  recycling  plants  are
being  constructed  and  operated  to  handle  many
types of plastic. What was waste plastic is being re-
cycled  into  new  plastic,  which  is  as  good  as  that
newly made from oil. Research is also underway to
recycle plastic back into oil.

In  some  areas,  infectious  waste  from  hospitals
and clinics can create problems if it is not properly
sterilized before disposal. Some hospitals have facil-
ities to incinerate such waste. In large urban areas,
huge quantities of toxic materials may also end up
at disposal sites. Urban landﬁlls are now being con-
sidered hazardous waste sites that will require costly
monitoring and cleanup.

Common  methods  of  solid  waste  disposal  in-
clude  onsite  disposal,  composting,  incineration,
open  dumps,  and  sanitary  landﬁlls.39 Our  focus
here  will  be  on  the  sanitary  landﬁlls  because  they
are very common and have signiﬁcant links with ge-
ology and hydrology.

A  sanitary  landﬁll (also  called  a  municipal  solid
waste landﬁll), as deﬁned by the American Society of
Civil Engineering, is a method of solid waste disposal
that functions without creating a nuisance or hazard
to public health or safety. Engineering principles are
used  to  conﬁne  the  waste  to  the  smallest  practical
area, reduce it to the smallest practical volume, and
cover it with a layer of compacted soil or specially de-
signed tarps at the end of each day of operation or
more frequently, if necessary. It is this covering of the
waste  that  makes  a  sanitary  landﬁll  sanitary.  The
cover effectively denies continued access to the waste
by insects, rodents, and other animals, and it also iso-
lates  the  refuse  from  the  air.  The  use  of  the  cover
minimizes the amount of surface water entering into
the waste and the amount of gas escaping from it.40
The sanitary landﬁll, as we know it today, emerged
in the late 1930s. Two types are used: area landﬁlls on
relatively ﬂat sites and depression landﬁlls in natural
or  artiﬁcial  gullies  or  pits.  Normally,  refuse  is  com-
pacted and covered at the end of each day. The ﬁnish-
ing cover (cap) or soil (clay) is designed to minimize
the inﬁltration of surface water.39

Waste Management and Geology

683

Potential  Hazards. One  of  the  most  signiﬁcant
potential hazards from a sanitary landﬁll is ground-
water  or  surface-water  pollution.  When  waste,
buried in a landﬁll, comes in contact with water per-
colating down from the surface or with groundwater
moving  laterally  through  the  refuse,  leachate (ob-
noxious, toxic liquid of variable composition capable
of transporting suspended solids and bacterial pol-
lutants)  is  produced.41 For  example,  two  landﬁlls
dating  from  the  1930s  and  1940s  in  Long  Island,
New York, have produced leachate plumes that are
several hundred meters wide and have migrated sev-
eral kilometers from the disposal site. Both the na-
ture  and  the  strength  of  leachate  produced  at  a
disposal  site  depend  on  the  composition  of  the
waste, the length of time that the inﬁltrated water is
in contact with the refuse, and the amount of water
that  inﬁltrates  or  moves  through  the  waste.39 The
concentration of pollutants in landﬁll leachate may
be  much  higher  than  in  raw  sewage  or  slaughter-
house  waste.  Fortunately,  the  volume  of  leachate
produced  from  urban  waste  disposal  is  much  less
than the volume of raw sewage we generate.

Another possible hazard from landﬁlls is uncon-
trolled  production  and  escape  of  methane  gas,
which  is  generated  as  organic  waste  decomposes.
For  example,  gas  generated  in  an  Ohio  landﬁll  mi-
grated several hundred meters through sandy soil to
a housing area, where one home exploded and sev-
eral others had to be evacuated. Properly managed,
methane gas (if not polluted with toxic materials) is
a resource. At new and expanded landﬁlls, methane
is  often  conﬁned  by  barriers  made  of  plastic  liner
and clay and then collected in specially constructed
wells. The technology for managing methane is well
known and available, and numerous landﬁlls across
the country are now producing methane and burn-
ing it to produce electricity or heat to reduce energy
costs associated with waste management.

Site  Selection. Factors  controlling  the  feasibility
of sanitary landﬁlls include:

• Topographic relief
• Location of the groundwater table
• Amount of precipitation
• Type of soil and rock
• Location  of  the  disposal  zone  in  the  surface-

water and groundwater ﬂow system

684

CHAPTER 19

Geology, Society, and the Future

The  best  sites  are  those  where  natural  condi-
tions ensure reasonable safety in disposal of solid
waste.  This  means  that  there  is  little  (or  accept-
able)  pollution  of  groundwater  or  surface  water
and  that  conditions  are  safe  because  of  climatic,
hydrologic, geologic, or human-induced conditions
or combinations thereof.42

The best sites for landﬁlls are in arid regions. Dis-
posal conditions are relatively safe there because, in
a dry environment, regardless of whether the burial
material  is  permeable  or  impermeable,  little  or  no
leachate  is  produced.  On  the  other  hand,  some
leachate will always be produced in a humid environ-
ment, so an acceptable level of leachate production
must  be  established  to  determine  the  most  favor-
able sites. What is acceptable varies with local water
use, local regulations, and the ability of the natural
hydrologic system to disperse, dilute, and otherwise
degrade the leachate to a harmless state.

The most desirable site in a humid climate is one
in which the waste is buried above the water table in
clay and silt soils of low hydraulic conductivity. Any
leachate produced will remain in the vicinity of the
site,  where  it  will  be  degraded  by  natural  ﬁltering
and by exchange of some ions between the clay and
the leachate. This holds—even if the water table is
fairly high, as it often is in humid areas—as long
as  material  with  low  hydraulic  conductivity  is  pre-
sent.39 For  example,  if  the  refuse  is  buried  over  a
fractured rock aquifer, as shown in Figure 19.7, the
potential  for  serious  pollution  is  low  to  moderate

because  the  leachate  is  partly  degraded  by  natural
ﬁltering  as  it  moves  down  to  the  water  table.  Fur-
thermore,  the  dispersion  of  contaminants  is  con-
ﬁned to the fracture zones.39 However, if the water
table were higher, or if the cover material were thin-
ner, with a moderate to high hydraulic conductivity,
widespread  groundwater  pollution  of  the  fractured
rock aquifer might result.

If  a  landﬁll  site  is  characterized  by  an  inclined
limestone  rock  aquifer  covered  by  sand  and  gravel
with high hydraulic conductivity (Figure 19.8), con-
siderable  contamination  of  the  groundwater  could
result. Leachate moves quickly through the sand and
gravel  soil  and  enters  the  limestone,  where  open
fractures  or  cavities  may  transport  the  pollutants
with little degradation aside from dispersion and di-
lution. Of course, if the inclined rock is all shale with
low hydraulic conductivity, little pollution will result.
The following general considerations43 should be
kept in mind in site selection for sanitary landﬁlls:

• Limestone  or  highly  fractured  rock  quarries
and most sand and gravel pits make poor land-
ﬁll sites because these Earth materials are good
aquifers.

• Swampy  areas,  unless  properly  drained  to
prevent  disposal  into  standing  water,  make
poor sites.

• Floodplains likely to be periodically inundated
by  surface  water  should  not  be  considered  as
acceptable sites for refuse disposal.

• Areas  in  close  proximity  to  the  coast—where
trash (transported by wind or surface water) or
leachate in groundwater or surface water may
pollute  beaches  and  coastal  marine  waters—
are undesirable sites.

• Any material with high hydraulic conductivity
and with a high water table is probably an un-
favorable site.

• In  rough  topography,  the  best  sites  are  near
the heads of gullies, where surface water is at a
minimum.

• Clay pits, if kept dry, provide satisfactory sites.
• Flat areas are favorable sites, provided that an
adequate  layer  of  material  with  low  hydraulic
conductivity,  such  as  clay  and  silt,  is  present
above any aquifer.

We emphasize that, although these guidelines are
useful,  they  do  not  preclude  the  need  for  a  hydro-
geological  investigation  that  includes  drilling  to
obtain  samples,  permeability  testing  to  determine
hydraulic conductivity, and other tests to predict the
movement of leachate from the buried refuse.40

Design  of Sanitary  Landfills. Design  of  mod-
ern  sanitary  landﬁlls  for  municipal  solid  waste
(MSW) is complex and employs the multiple-barrier
approach.  Barriers  include  a  compacted  clay  liner,
leachate  collection  systems,  and  a  compacted  clay

FIGURE 19.10 Rock Creek municipal landfill This

cap.  Figure  19.9 is  an  idealized  diagram  showing
these features, and Figure 19.10 shows such a land-
ﬁll being constructed. Depending upon local site con-
ditions, landﬁlls may also have additional synthetic
liners made of plastics or other materials and a sys-
tem  to  collect  natural  gas  that  might  accumulate.
Finally,  a  sanitary  landﬁll  must  have  a  system  for
monitoring  wells  and  other  devices  to  evaluate  the
potential for groundwater pollution. The subject of

686

monitoring is an important one, and we will now ad-
dress that issue in greater detail.

Monitoring  Sanitary  Landfills. Once  a  site  is
chosen for a sanitary landﬁll, monitoring the move-
ment of groundwater should begin before filling com-
mences. After the operation starts, monitoring of the
movement of leachate and gases should be continued
as long as there is any possibility of pollution. This is
particularly  important  after  the  site  is  completely
ﬁlled and the permanent cover material is in place be-
cause a certain amount of settlement always occurs
after a landﬁll is completed. If small depressions form
as  a  result  of  settlement,  surface  water  can  collect,
inﬁltrate the ﬁll material, and produce leachate. There-
fore, monitoring and proper maintenance of an aban-
doned landﬁll will reduce its pollution potential.40

Hazardous  waste  pollutants  from  a  solid  waste
disposal site can enter the environment by as many
as seven paths (Figure 19.11):44

1. Gases in the soil and ﬁll, such as methane, am-
monia,  hydrogen  sulﬁde,  and  nitrogen,  may
volatilize and enter the atmosphere.

2. Heavy  metals,  such  as  lead,  chromium,  and

iron, are retained in the soil.

3. Soluble  substances,  such  as  chloride,  nitrate,
and sulfate, readily pass through ﬁll and soil to
the groundwater system.

4. Surface runoff can pick up leachate and trans-

port it into the surface water network.

5. Some crops and cover plants growing in the dis-
posal area may selectively take up heavy metals
and other toxic substances to be passed up the
food chain as people and animals ingest them.

6. Plant  residue  left  in  the  ﬁeld  contains  toxic
substances that will return to the environment
through soil-forming and runoff processes.

7. Paper,  plastics,  and  other  undesirable  waste

may be transported offsite by wind.

A  thorough  monitoring  program  considers  these
seven  possible  paths  by  which  pollutants  enter  the
environment. Potential atmospheric pollution by gas
from landﬁlls is a growing concern, and a thorough
monitoring program includes periodic analysis of air
samples to detect toxic gas before it becomes a seri-
ous problem. Many landﬁlls have no surface runoff;
therefore, monitoring onsite surface water is not nec-
essary.  However,  if  surface  runoff  does  occur,  thor-
ough monitoring is required, as well as monitoring of
nearby  down-gradient  streams,  rivers,  and  lakes.
Monitoring of soil and plants should include periodic
chemical analysis at prescribed sampling locations.

If permeable water-bearing zones exist in the soil
or bedrock below a sanitary landﬁll, monitoring wells
(see Figure 19.9) are needed for frequent sampling of
groundwater  quality  and  monitoring  of  the  move-
ment of any leachate that has entered the groundwa-
ter.44 Even if the landﬁll is in relatively impermeable
soil overlying dense permeable rock, minimal moni-
toring  of  groundwater  quality  through  monitoring
wells is still needed. In this case, leachate and ground-
water  movement  may  be  less  than  30  cm  per  year.
Water  in  the  unsaturated  (vadose)  zone  above  the
water table must also be monitored to identify poten-
tial  pollution  problems  before  they  contaminate
groundwater resources, where correction is very ex-
pensive. Waste transported offsite by wind must be
monitored, collected as necessary, and disposed of.

Sanitary  Landfills  and  Federal  Legislation.
Federal  legislation  strictly  regulates  new  landﬁlls.
The  intent  of  the  legislation  is  to  strengthen  and
standardize  the  design,  operation,  and  monitoring
of  sanitary  landﬁlls.  Landﬁlls  that  are  unable  to
comply  with  the  regulations  might  be  shut  down.
Speciﬁc regulations include:

• Landﬁlls  cannot  be  sited  in  certain  areas,  in-
cluding  ﬂoodplains,  wetlands,  unstable  land,
and earthquake fault zones. They must not be
sited  near  airports  because  birds  attracted  to
landﬁll sites present a hazard to aircraft.

• Landﬁll construction must include liners and a

leachate collection system.

• Operators of landﬁlls must meet ﬁnancial as-
surance criteria. They do so by posting bonds
or insurance to ensure that monitoring of the

Hazardous Waste Management
The creation of new chemical compounds has pro-
liferated  tremendously  in  recent  years.  In  the
United  States  alone,  approximately  1,000  new
chemicals are marketed annually, and about 50,000
chemicals  are  currently  on  the  market.  Although
many  of  these  chemicals  are  beneﬁcial  to  people,
several tens of thousands of them are classiﬁed as
deﬁnitely  or  potentially  hazardous  to  people’s
health (Table 19.4).

The United States is currently generating more
than 150 million metric tons of hazardous waste
each  year.  In  the  recent  past,  as  much  as  half  of
the  total  volume  of  waste  was  dumped  indiscrimi-
nately.45 Such dumping is now illegal, and we do not
know  how  much  illegal  dumping  is  going  on;  cer-
tainly there is some, particularly in urban sewer sys-
tems. Past uncontrolled dumping of chemical waste
has polluted soil and groundwater resources in sev-
eral ways (Figure 19.12):

• E-waste, such as computers, TVs, and the like,
is  being  sent  to  foreign  countries,  such  as
China,  where  it  is  exposing  workers  to  toxic
components.

Old  abandoned  hazardous  landﬁlls  and  other
sites for the disposal of chemical waste have caused
serious  problems  that  have  been  very  difﬁcult  to
correct (see A Closer Look: Love Canal).

688

A 

Closer
Look

Love Canal

In 1976, in a residential area near
Niagara Falls, New York, trees and
gardens began to die. Children
found the rubber on their tennis
shoes and on their bicycle tires dis-
integrating. Dogs sniffing in a land-
fill area developed sores that would
not heal. Puddles of toxic, noxious
substances began to ooze to the
soil surface; a swimming pool
popped its foundation
and was found to be
floating on a bath of
chemicals.

in the canal.46 Finally, in 1953, the
company dumping the chemicals do-
nated the land to the city of Niagara
Falls for $1. Eventually, several hun-
dred homes adjacent to an elemen-
tary school were built near the site
(Figure 19.D). Heavy rainfall and
snowfall during the winter of
1976–1977 set off the chain of events

that made Love Canal a household
word.

A study of the site identiﬁed a

number of substances present
there—including benzene, dioxin,
dichloroethylene, and chloroform—
that were suspected of being car-
cinogens. Although ofﬁcials readily
admitted that very little was known

A study revealed that
the residential area had
been built on the site of a
chemical dump. The area
was excavated in 1892 by
William T. Love as part of a
canal between the upper
and lower reaches of the
Niagara River. The idea was
to produce inexpensive
hydroelectric power for a
new urban industrial cen-
ter. When that plan failed
because alternating cur-
rent was discovered and
industry could be located
far from the source of
power, the canal was un-
used (except for recre-
ation, such as swimming
and ice skating) for
decades. It seemed a con-
venient place to dump
wastes. From the 1940s to
the 1950s, more than 80
different substances from a
chemical company were
dumped there. More than
20,000 tons of chemical
waste, along with urban
waste from the city of Nia-
gara Falls, was disposed of

FIGURE 19.D Love Canal This is an infrared aerial photograph of the Love Canal area in New
York. Healthy vegetation is bright red. This portion of Love Canal runs from the upper-left corner to
the lower-right corner. It appears as a scar on the landscape. Buried chemical waste seeped to the
surface and caused numerous environmental problems and concerns. The site became a household
name for toxic waste. (New York State Department of Environmental Conservation)

about the impact of these chemicals
and others at the site, there was
grave concern for the people living in
the area. During the next few years,
there were, allegedly, higher-than-
average rates of miscarriages, blood
and liver abnormalities, birth defects,
and chromosome damage. However,
a study by the New York State health
authorities suggested that no chemi-
cally caused health effects had been
absolutely established.47–49

The cleanup of the Love Canal is

an important demonstration of state-
of-the-art technology in hazardous
waste treatment. The objective is to
contain and stop the migration of
waste through the groundwater ﬂow
system and to remove and treat
dioxin-contaminated soil and sedi-
ment from stream beds and storm
sewers.46 The method being used to
minimize further production of cont-

aminated water is to cover the dump
site and the adjacent contaminated
area with a 1 m-thick layer of com-
pacted clay and a polyethylene plas-
tic cover to reduce inﬁltration of
surface water. Water is inhibited from
laterally entering or escaping the site
by specially designed perforated tile
drain pipes. These procedures will
greatly reduce subsurface seepage of
water through the site, and the water
that does seep out will be collected
and treated.47–49

The homes adjacent to Love Canal
were abandoned and bought by the
government. Approximately 200 of
the homes had to be destroyed.
During the 1980s, approximately
$175 million was spent for cleanup
and relocation at Love Canal. The EPA
now considers some of the area
clean, and some of the remaining
homes (about 200) were sold. They

sold despite the reputation of the
area and the adverse publicity it at-
tracted because the price of the
homes was approximately 20 percent
below the market value of other areas
in Niagara Falls. The neighborhood is
now known as Black Creek Village. In
early 1995, the maintenance and op-
eration of the area was transferred
from New York State to a consulting
company, which will continue long-
term sampling and monitoring.46,50
Also, in 1995, the Occidental Chemi-
cal Company agreed to pay $129 mil-
lion to cover the cost of the incident.
What went wrong in Love Canal?
How can we avoid such disasters in
the future? The real tragedy of Love
Canal is that it is probably not an
isolated incident. There may be
other hidden “Love Canals” across
the country, “time bombs” waiting 
to explode.47,48

Responsible Management of Hazardous Waste.
In  1976,  the  U.S.  government  moved  to  begin  the
management  of  hazardous  waste  with  the  passage
of  the  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act
(RCRA), which is intended to provide for “cradle-to-
grave”  control  of  hazardous  waste.  At  the  heart  of
the act is the identiﬁcation of hazardous wastes and
their life cycles. Regulations call for stringent record
keeping and reporting to verify that waste does not
present  a  public  nuisance  or  a  public  health  prob-
lem.  The  act  also  identiﬁes  hazardous  waste  in
terms of several categories:

• Waste that is highly toxic to people and other

• Waste  that  may  explode  or  ignite  when  ex-

living things

posed to air

• Waste that is extremely corrosive
• Waste that is otherwise unstable

Recognizing  that  a  great  number  of  waste  dis-
posal sites presented hazards, Congress passed the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compen-
sation,  and  Liability  Act  (CERCLA)  in  1980,  which

established  a  revolving  fund  (popularly  called  the
Superfund) to clean up several hundred of the worst
abandoned hazardous chemical waste disposal sites
known to exist around the country. The EPA devel-
oped  a  list  of  Superfund  sites  (i.e.,  the  National
Priorities List). Most of the Superfund sites (about
50 to 75 percent) signiﬁcantly impact groundwater
resources,  drinking  water,  and  surface  water,  in
some  combination.  Fewer  sites  (10  to  25  percent)
directly  and  seriously  impact  air  resources,  vegeta-
tion, animal life, or human health.

Although the Superfund has experienced signiﬁ-
cant  management  problems  and  is  far  behind
schedule, a number of sites have been treated. Un-
fortunately, the funds available are not sufﬁcient to
pay  for  decontamination  of  all  the  targeted  areas.
That would cost many times more, perhaps as much
as $100 billion. Furthermore, because of concern that
the present technology is not sufﬁciently advanced to
treat all the abandoned waste disposal sites, the strat-
egy may be simply to conﬁne the waste to those areas
until better disposal methods are developed. It seems
apparent that the danger of abandoned disposal sites
is likely to persist for some time to come.

690

CHAPTER 19

Geology, Society, and the Future

The federal legislation also changed the way the
real  estate  industry  does  business.  The  act  has
tough  liability  provisions,  and  property  owners
could be liable for costly cleanup of hazardous waste
found on their property (even if they did not cause
the problem). Banks and other lending institutions
could be liable for release of hazardous materials on
their property by their tenants. In 1986, the Super-
fund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA)
provided  a  possible  defense  for  real  estate  pur-
chasers  against  liability,  provided  that  they  com-
pleted an environmental audit prior to purchase. The
audit  is  a  study  of  past  land  use  at  the  site  (deter-
mined  by  analyzing  old  maps  and  aerial  pho-
tographs, possibly involving drilling and sampling of
soil  and  groundwater)  to  determine  whether  pollu-
tants  are  present.  Such  audits  now  are  done  rou-
tinely prior to purchase of property for development.
The  SARA  legislation  required  that  certain  in-
dustries report all releases of hazardous materials
into the environment. The list of companies releas-
ing such substances became public and was known
as the “Toxic 500 list.” Unwanted publicity to com-
panies  on  the  list  is  thought  to  have  resulted  in
better  and  safer  handling  of  hazardous  waste  by
ﬁrms that were formerly identiﬁed as polluters of
the environment. No owner wants his or her com-
pany to be the “number one” (or even the twenty-
ﬁfth  or  hundredth)  most  serious  polluter  among
U.S. ﬁrms.51

Management  of  hazardous  chemical  waste  in-
cludes  several  options:  recycling  (onsite  processing
to recover by-products that have commercial value),
microbial  breakdown,  chemical  stabilization,  high-
temperature  decomposition,  incineration,  and  dis-
posal  by  secure  landﬁll  or  deep-well  injection.  A
number of technological advances have been made
in the ﬁeld of toxic waste management, and, as land
disposal becomes more and more expensive, the re-
cent trend toward onsite treatment is likely to con-
tinue. However, onsite treatment will not eliminate
all  hazardous  chemical  waste;  disposal  will  remain
necessary.  Table  19.5 compares  hazardous  waste-
reduction technology in terms of treatment and dis-
posal.  Notice  that  all  of  the  technologies  available
will  cause  some  environmental  disruption.  No  one
simple solution exists for all waste-management is-
sues. We will discuss the secure landﬁll land applica-
tion  and  deep  well  disposal  that  have  important
linkages  to  geology  and  hydrology.  Other  options

include the reuse of hazardous materials and treat-
ment  of  hazardous  waste  to  reduce  the  hazardous
characteristics.

Secure  Landfill  for  Hazardous  Waste. The
basic idea of a secure landﬁll is to conﬁne waste to a
particular location, control the leachate that drains
from  the  waste,  collect  and  treat  the  leachate,  and
detect  possible  leaks.  Figure  19.13 (page  692)
demonstrates  these  procedures.  A  dike  and  liners
(made of clay and impervious material, such as plas-
tic) conﬁne the waste, and a system of internal drains
concentrates the leachate in a collection basin, from
which it is pumped out and transported to a waste-
water  treatment  plant.  Designs  of  new  facilities
today must include multiple barriers, consisting of
several  impermeable  layers  and  ﬁlters,  as  well  as
impervious covers. The function of impervious liners
is to ensure that the leachate does not contaminate
soil and, in particular, groundwater resources. How-
ever,  this  type  of  waste  disposal  procedure  must
have  several  monitoring  wells  to  alert  personnel  if
leachate migrates out of the system, possibly conta-
minating nearby water resources.

It has been argued that there is no such thing as a
really secure landﬁll, implying that all landﬁlls leak
to  some  extent.  This  is  probably  true;  impervious
plastic  liners,  ﬁlters,  and  clay  layers  can  fail,  even
with  several  backups,  and  drains  can  become
clogged,  causing  overﬂow.  Yet,  landﬁlls  that  are
carefully  sited  and  engineered  can  minimize  prob-
lems.  Preferable  sites  are  those  with  good  natural
barriers, such as thick clay-silt deposits, an arid cli-
mate,  or  a  deep  water  table  that  minimizes  migra-
tion of leachate. Nevertheless, land disposal should
be used only for speciﬁc chemicals suitable for the
method employed.

Land Application
Application  of  waste  materials  to  the  surface-soil
horizon  is  referred  to  as  land  application,  land
spreading,  or  land  farming.  Land  application  may
be  a  desirable  treatment  method  for  certain
biodegradable  industrial  wastes,  including  petro-
leum oily waste and certain organic chemical-plant
waste.  A  good  indicator  of  the  usefulness  of  land
application for disposal of a particular waste is the
waste’s biopersistence (i.e., the measure of how long

a material remains in the biosphere). The greater or
longer  the  biopersistence,  the  less  suitable  the
waste is for land-application procedures. Land appli-
cation  is  not  an  effective  treatment  or  disposal
method for inorganic substances, such as salts and
heavy metals.52

Land  application  of  biodegradable  waste  works
because, when such materials are added to the soil,
they  are  attacked  by  microorganisms  (e.g.,  bacte-
ria, molds, yeast, other organisms) that decompose
the waste material. The soil may, thus, be thought

of as a microbial farm that constantly recycles mat-
ter  by  breaking  it  down  into  more  fundamental
forms useful to other living things in the soil. Be-
cause the upper soil zone contains the largest mi-
crobial  populations,  land  application  is  restricted
to the uppermost 15 to 20 cm of the soil proﬁle.52
As  with  other  types  of  land-disposal  technology,
the  vadose  zone  and  groundwater  near  the  site
must be carefully monitored to ensure that the dis-
posal system is working as planned and not pollut-
ing water resources.

Deep-Well Disposal
Another method of hazardous waste disposal is in-
jection  into  deep  wells.  The  term  deep refers  to
rock  (not  soil)  that  is  below  and  completely  iso-
lated  from  all  freshwater  aquifers,  thereby  ensur-
ing that injection of waste will not contaminate or
pollute  existing  or  potential  water  supplies.  This
generally  means  that  the  waste  is  injected  into  a
permeable  rock  layer  several  hundred  to  several
thousand  meters  below  the  surface,  in  geologic
basins that are conﬁned above by relatively imper-
vious, fracture-resistant rock, such as shale or salt
deposits.53

Deep-well disposal of industrial waste should not
be viewed as a quick-and-easy solution to industrial
waste  problems.54 Even  where  geologic  conditions
are favorable for deep-well disposal, natural restric-
tions  include  the  limited  number  of  suitable  sites
and the limited space within these sites for disposal
of waste. Possible injection zones in porous rock are
usually  already  ﬁlled  with  natural  ﬂuids,  mostly
brackish  or  briny  water.  Therefore,  to  pump  in
waste, some of the natural ﬂuid must be displaced
by  compression  (even  slight  compression  of  the
natural ﬂuids in a large volume of permeable rock
can  provide  considerable  storage  space)  and  by
slight expansion of the reservoir rock as the waste
is being injected.55

Problems  with  Deep-Well  Disposal. Several
problems associated with disposal of liquid waste in

deep  wells  have  been  reported.54,55 Perhaps  the
best  known  are  the  earthquakes  that  were  caused
by injecting waste from the Rocky Mountain Arse-
nal  near  Denver,  Colorado  (see  Chapter  6).  These
earthquakes occurred between 1962 and 1965. The
injection zone was fractured gneiss at a depth of 3.6
km, and the increased ﬂuid pressure evidently initi-
ated  movement  along  the  fractures.  This  is  not  a
unique case. Similar initiations of earthquakes have
been  reported  in  oil  ﬁelds  in  western  Colorado,
Texas, and Utah.55

Feasibility  and  General  Site  Considerations.
The feasibility of deep-well injection as the best so-
lution  to  a  disposal  problem  depends  on  four  fac-
tors: (1) the geologic and engineering suitability of
the  proposed  site,  (2)  the  volume  and  the  physical
and chemical properties of the waste, (3) economics,
and (4) legal considerations. The geologic considera-
tions for disposal wells are twofold:55

• The injection zone must have sufﬁcient porosi-
ty,  thickness,  hydraulic  conductivity,  and  size
to  ensure  safe  injection.  Sandstone  and  frac-
tured limestone are the commonly used reser-
voir rocks.

• The injection zone must be below the level of
freshwater circulation and conﬁned by a rela-
tively  impermeable  rock  with  low  hydraulic
conductivity, such as shale or salt, as shown in
Figure 19.14.

the injection zone.

19.5 Environmental Analysis
Site Selection
Site  selection is  the  process  of  evaluating  an  envi-
ronment  that  will  support  human  activities.  It  is  a
task shared by Earth scientists, engineers, landscape
architects,  geographers,  ecologists,  planners,  social
scientists, and economists and, thus, involves a mul-
tidimensional approach to landscape evaluation.

The  goal  of  site  evaluation  for  a  particular  land
use is to ensure that site development is compatible
with both the possibilities and the limitations of the
natural  environment.  Although  it  is  obviously  ad-
vantageous to know the possibilities and limitations
of a site before development begins, site evaluation
is  often  overlooked.  People  still  purchase  land  for
various  activities  without  considering  whether  the
land use they have in mind is compatible with the
site they have chosen.

An Earth scientist plays a significant role in the
evaluation  process  by  providing  crucial  geologic
information.  This  information  includes  soil  and
rock  types;  rock  structure,  especially  fractures;
drainage characteristics; groundwater characteris-
tics; landform information; and estimates of pos-
sible hazardous Earth events and processes, such
as  floods,  landslides,  earthquakes,  and  volcanic

Environmental Impact Analysis
The probable effects of land use by humans are gen-
erally  referred  to  as  the  environmental impact. This
term  became  popular  in  1969,  when  the  National
Environmental  Policy  Act  (NEPA)  required  that
every major federal action that could possibly affect
the quality of the human environment be preceded
by an evaluation of the project and its impact on the
environment.

Environmental Impact Statements
To carry out both the letter and the spirit of NEPA,
the  Council  on  Environmental  Quality  prepared
guidelines to help in preparing the environmental
impact statement (EIS). The major components of
the  statement,  according  to  the  revised  guidelines
issued in 1979, are the following:56

• A summary of the EIS
• A  statement  concerning  the  proposed  acts,

their purpose, and the need for the project

• A rigorous comparison of reasonable alternatives
• A succinct description of the environment af-

fected by the proposed project

• A discussion of the proposed project, its envi-
ronmental  consequences,  and  alternatives.
This  must  include  direct  and  indirect  effects;
energy requirements and conservation poten-
tial; possible depletion of resources; impact on
urban quality and cultural and/or historical re-
sources;  possible  conﬂicts  with  state  or  local
land-use plans, policies, and controls; and miti-
gation measures.

Scoping. The  environmental  impact  statement
process  was  criticized  during  the  ﬁrst  10  years
under NEPA because it initiated a tremendous vol-
ume of paperwork by requiring detailed reports that
tended  to  obscure  important  issues.  In  response,
the  revised  regulations  introduced  the  idea  of
scoping, the process of identifying important envi-
ronmental  issues  that  require  detailed  evaluation
early in the planning of a proposed project. As part
of this process, federal, state, and local agencies, as

694

CHAPTER 19

Geology, Society, and the Future

well as citizen groups and individuals, are asked to
participate  by  identifying  issues  and  alternatives
that should be addressed as part of the environmen-
tal analysis.

Mitigation. An important concept in an environ-
mental impact analysis is mitigation. Mitigation in-
volves identifying actions that will avoid, lessen, or
compensate  for  anticipated  adverse  environmental
impacts of a particular project. For example, if a pro-
ject  involves  ﬁlling  in  wetlands,  a  possible  mitiga-
tion might be enhancement or creation of wetlands
at another site.

Mitigation  is  becoming  a  common  feature  of
many  environmental  impact  statements  and  state
environmental  impact  reports.  Unfortunately,  it
may be overused. Sometimes mitigation is not pos-
sible for a particular environmental disruption. Fur-
thermore,  we  often  do  not  know  enough  about
restoring  and  creating  habitats  and  environments,
such as wetlands, to do a proper job. Requiring miti-
gation procedures may be useful in many instances,
but it must not be considered an across-the-board,
acceptable way to circumvent adverse environmen-
tal impacts associated with a particular project.

Negative Declarations
Negative declarations are ﬁled when an agency deter-
mines that a particular project does not have a sig-
niﬁcant adverse impact on the environment. A nega-
tive declaration requires a statement that includes a
description  of  the  project  and  detailed  information
that  supports  the  contention  that  the  project  will
not have a signiﬁcant effect on the environment. A
negative declaration does not have to consider a wide
variety of alternatives to the project, but it should be
a  complete  and  comprehensive  statement  concern-
ing  potential  environmental  problems.57 Although
the language and law associated with the concept of
the negative declaration are different at the federal
and state levels, this concept is an important compo-
nent of environmental assessment.

Land Use and Planning
Land  use  in  the  contiguous  United  States  is  domi-
nated by agriculture and forestry, with only a small
portion of the land, approximately 3 percent, used
for  urban  purposes.  Currently,  several  thousand

square kilometers of land per year are converted to
uses  other  than  agriculture.  About  one-half  of  the
conversion is for wilderness areas, parks, recreation
areas,  and  wildlife  refuges.  The  other  half  is  for
urban  development,  transportation  networks,  and
facilities. On a national scale, urbanization of rural
lands may appear to be proceeding slowly. However,
it often occurs in rapidly growing urban areas, where
it may be viewed as destroying agricultural and nat-
ural lands and intensifying existing urban environ-
mental problems. Urbanization in areas with scenic
and  recreation  value  is  often  viewed  as  potentially
damaging to important ecosystems.

Land Use Planning
Land use planning is an important environmental
issue. Good land use planning is essential for sound
economic  development,  for  avoiding  conﬂicts  be-
tween land uses, and for maintaining a high quality
of  life  in  our  communities.  When  a  business  man-
ages its capital and resources in an efﬁcient manner,
we call that good business. When a city or county ef-
ﬁciently manages its land and resources, we call that
good planning.58 From an Earth science perspective,
the basic philosophy of good land-use planning is to
avoid hazards, conserve natural resources, and gen-
erally  protect  the  environment  through  the  use  of
sound ecological principles.

The  land  use  planning  process  shown  in  Figure

19.15 includes several steps:59

• Identify and deﬁne issues, problems, goals, and

objectives

• Collect, analyze, and interpret data (including
an  inventory  of  environmental  resources  and
hazards)

• Develop and test alternatives
• Formulate land-use plans
• Review and adopt plans
• Implement plans
• Revise and amend plans

The  three  most  important  steps,  each  of  which
comprises a complex list of factors, are data collec-
tion,  formulation  of  plans,  and  implementation  of
plans, as illustrated in Figure 19.15 (lower part).

The  role  of  an  Earth  scientist  in  the  planning
process is most signiﬁcant in the data collection and
analysis  stage.  Depending  on  the  speciﬁc  task  or

plan,  an  Earth  scientist  will  use  available  Earth  sci-
ence information; collect necessary new data; prepare
pertinent technical information, such as interpretive
maps and texts; and assist in the preparation of land-
capability  maps.  Ideally,  the  natural  capability  of  a
land unit should match its speciﬁc potential uses.60

Scenic Resources
Scenery in the United States has been recognized as
a  natural  resource  since  1864,  when  the  ﬁrst  state
park, Yosemite Valley in California, which later be-
came Yosemite National Park, was established. The
early  recognition  of  scenic  resources  was  primarily
concerned  with  outdoor  recreation,  focusing  on
preservation and management of discrete parcels of
unique scenic landscapes. Public awareness of and
concern  for  the  scenic  value  of  the  “everyday”
nonurban  landscape  is  relatively  recent.  Society

now  fully recognizes scenery—even when it is not
spectacular—as  a  valuable  resource.  There  is  now
awareness that landscapes have varying degrees of
scenic  value,  just  as  more  tangible  resources  have
varying degrees of economic value. Earth scientists,
as members of a team evaluating the entire environ-
ment,  assist  in  characterization  of  the  landscape
and its resources, including scenery.

Sequential Land Use
The need to use land near urban areas for a variety of
human activities has, in some instances, led to appli-
cation  of  the  concept  of  sequential  land  use  rather
than  permanent,  exclusive  use.  The  concept  of  se-
quential use of the land is consistent with the princi-
ple that the effects of land use are cumulative, and,
therefore, we have a responsibility to future genera-
tions. The basic idea is that, after a particular activity,

such as mining or a landﬁll operation, has been com-
pleted, the land is reclaimed for another purpose.

There are several examples of sequential land use.
Sanitary  landﬁll  sites  have  been  planned  so  that,
when a site is completed, the land will be used for
recreational purposes, such as a golf course. The city
of Denver used abandoned sand and gravel pits once
used for a sanitary landﬁll as sites for a parking lot
and the Denver Coliseum. Bay Harbor, Michigan, is
a modern upscale community and a world-class re-
sort  in  Little  Traverse  Bay,  near  the  north  end  of
Lake Michigan. The harbor and other development
resulted  from  restoration  of  an  abandoned  shale
quarry  and  cement  plant.  The  restoration  trans-
formed a site that was a source of cement dust, an
air pollutant, into a high-value landscape that peo-
ple wish to visit (Figure 19.16).

more  than  one  purpose.  This  is  certainly  true  for
multiple land use. Recreation and timber harvesting
are not compatible, if we wish to maximize both the
number  of  trees  harvested  and  the  number  and
quality  of  ﬁsh  in  a  forest  stream.  Logging,  unless
done very carefully, and with a wide buffer zone to
protect  the  stream,  will  damage  a  stream  environ-
ment  (Figure  19.17).  Damage  may  occur  if  we  re-
move  trees  that  provide  shade  for  the  stream  and
keep the water cool; damage may also occur through
sediment  pollution  from  increased  runoff  and  soil
erosion and through landsliding and the formation
of gullies. Likewise, a reservoir designed to provide
water for summer irrigation of farm land may be full
in  the  spring,  when  flood  protection  is  needed,
and  be  very  low,  exposing  the  shorline  to  erosion,
when  people  arrive  for  late  summer  recreation
(Figure 19.18, page 698).

Multiple Land Use
Multiple land use occurs where land may be used for
more than one purpose. For example, our national
forests are used for a variety of purposes, including
recreation  and  timber  harvesting.  Other  examples
include reservoirs designed for providing irrigation
water,  ﬂood  control,  and  recreation.  It  has  often
been said that it is difﬁcult to maximize beneﬁts for

Environmental Law
Environmental  planning  needs  to  be  implemented
and  enforced,  and  environmental  law is,  therefore,
an important part of our jurisprudence. Environmen-
tal law is a maturing law practice and environmental
law societies, and environmental courses have been
established at law schools.

It  is  beyond  the  scope  of  our  discussion  to  con-
sider in detail the process of law as it relates to the
environment. Sufﬁce it to say that law is a technique
for the ordered accomplishment of economic, social,
and political purposes, and the most desirable legal
technique, generally, is one that most quickly allows
ends to be reached. Laws related to the environment
often primarily serve the major interest that domi-
nates the culture, and, in our sophisticated culture,
the  major  concerns  are  wealth  and  power.  These
concerns stress society’s ability to use the resource

base to produce goods and services and a legal sys-
tem to ensure productivity.61 On the other hand, in
recent  years,  many  laws  have  been  established  to
protect the air, water, land, and living environment
at  local,  regional,  and  global  levels.  This  is  an  en-
couraging sign, if we hope to sustain Earth’s renew-
able resources.

Some  environmental  lawyers  today  believe  that
the process of law, as it has generally been practiced,
is  not  working  satisfactorily  where  environmental
issues  are  concerned.  In  general,  when  two  views

conﬂict,  adversarial  confrontation  occurs.  Emo-
tional levels are often high, and it may be difﬁcult
for  disagreeing  parties  to  see  positions  other  than
their own. An emerging view in environmental law
is one that stresses problem solving. This may take
the form of mediation through negotiation. For ex-
ample, in the 1970s, the Environmental Protection
Agency often announced new environmental regula-
tions that were thrust upon various sectors of soci-
ety without warning. Not surprisingly, many of the
people  and  organizations  affected  by  those  regula-
tions ended up in lawsuits and lengthy litigation. In
the 1980s, the EPA began a practice of consulting in-
terested parties before enacting regulations. Consul-
tation,  negotiation,  and  mediation may  well  prove
much  more  successful  than  earlier  strategies  that
produced unproductive adversarial reactions.

One of the major problems in mediation and ne-
gotiation  is  getting  all  the  important  players  in  a
given case to sit down and talk about the issues in a
meaningful  way.  The  party  with  the  “upper  hand”
may try to make the negotiations particularly difﬁ-
cult for opposing parties. Increasingly, however, all
parties in environmental issues are recognizing that
it is advantageous to work together toward a solu-
tion  that  is  satisfactory  for  everyone.  This  is  basi-
cally  a  collaborative  process  that  seeks  solutions
that favor the environment while allowing activities
and projects to go forward.

It is important to recognize that collaboration is
different from and broader than compromise, which
often requires giving something up to get something

else. Collaboration is more comprehensive in that it
asks—in  fact,  necessitates—that  the  parties  work
together  to  create  opportunities  for  mutual  gain.
Collaboration  creates  a  climate  of  joint  problem
solving. For negotiation and mediation to work, all
parties  must  clearly  and  honestly  state  their  posi-
tions and then work to see where common ground
might  be  found.  Relationships  built  upon  mutual
trust are then developed. It should come as no sur-
prise that almost all issues are negotiable, and alter-
natives  can  often  be  worked  out  that  avoid,  or  at
least minimize, costly litigation and lengthy delays.

The Storm King Mountain Case
The Storm King Mountain dispute is a classic example
of  conﬂict  between  a  utility  company  and  conserva-
tionists. In 1962, the Consolidated Edison Company
of New York announced plans for a hydroelectric pro-
ject approximately 64 km (40 mi) north of New York
City,  on  Storm  King  Mountain,  part  of  the  Hudson
River  Highlands,  an  area  in  the  Appalachian  Moun-
tains  considered  by  many  to  have  unique  aesthetic
value. It is the only place in the eastern United States
where a major river has eroded through mountains at
sea level, giving the effect of a fjord.62

Early  plans  called  for  construction  of  an  above-
ground  powerhouse,  which  would  have  required  a
deep  cut  into  Storm  King  Mountain.  The  project
was redesigned to site the powerhouse entirely un-
derground,  eliminating  the  cut  on  the  mountain
(Figure 19.19). However, conservationists continued

to oppose the project, and the issues broadened to
include possible damage to ﬁsheries. Conservation-
ists argued that the high rate of water intake from
the river would draw many ﬁsh larvae into the plant,
where  they  would  be  destroyed  by  turbulence  and
abrasion. The most valuable sport ﬁsh in the river is
the striped bass, and one study showed that 25 to
75  percent  of  the  annual  bass  hatch  might  be  de-
stroyed if the plant were to operate. The ﬁsh return
from the ocean to tidal water to spawn, and, since
the  Hudson  River  is  the  only  estuary  north  of
Chesapeake Bay where the striped bass spawn, the
concern for the safety of the ﬁsheries was justiﬁed.
The problem was even more severe because the pro-
posed plant was to be located near the striped bass
spawning area.62

The Storm King Mountain controversy is inter-
esting because it emphasizes the difficulty of mak-
ing  decisions  about  multidimensional  issues.  A
utility company was trying to survive in New York
City, where high peak-power demands are accom-
panied  by  high  labor  and  maintenance  costs.  At
the  same  time,  conservationists  were  fighting  to
preserve  a  beautiful  landscape  and  fishery  re-
sources.  Both  had  legitimate  arguments,  but,  in
light  of  their  special  interests,  it  was  difficult  to
resolve the conflicts. Existing laws and procedures
were sufficient to resolve the issues, but trade-offs
were necessary. Ultimately, an economic and envi-
ronmental price must be paid for any decision—a
price  that  reflects  our  desired  lifestyle  and  stan-
dard of living.

CHAPTER 19

Geology, Society, and the Future

The  ﬁrst  lawsuit  in  the  Storm  King  dispute  was
ﬁled in 1965, and, after 16 years of intense court-
room battles, the dispute was settled in 1981. The
total paper trail exceeded 20,000 pages, and, in the
end, the various parties used an outside mediator to
help  settle  their  differences.  This  famous  case  has
been cited as a major victory for environmentalists.
Could the outcome have been decided much earlier
if the various litigants had been able to sit down and
talk openly about the issues? Perhaps, through the
processes of negotiation and mediation, the dispute
might have been settled much sooner at a lesser cost
to  the  individual  parties  and  society  in  general.63
This  case  illustrates  that  environmental  law  issues
may  best  be  approached  from  a  problem-solving
viewpoint rather than an adversarial one.

Geology, the Environment, 
and the Future
This  book  started  with  the  introduction  of  some
philosophy  and  fundamental  concepts  associated
with geology and the environment. A main message
of  this  book  is  that  Earth  is  a  dynamic  place  and
that  people  should  not  build  on  ﬂoodplains;  of
course, this is an oversimpliﬁcation. There are many
important  linkages  between  geologic  processes,  the
environment, and society, and we must pay close at-
tention  to  these  linkages  if  we  are  to  achieve
sustainability.

Avoiding an Environmental Crisis:
Focusing on What Can Be Done
The  concept  of  an  environmental  crisis  was  intro-
duced  in  Chapter  1.  We  now  turn  to  what  can  be
done to eliminate development of a potential crisis
that  could  damage  human  society  as  we  know  it.
First, we will suggest short-term actions to avoid a
potential  food  shortage  in  the  next  few  years  to
decades.  Second,  we  will  discuss  how  we  might
achieve the long-term concept of sustainability over
centuries of human use of Earth.

Lester  Brown,  a  leader  in  understanding  global
environmental problems and solutions, argues that
we should do three things (all are linked to food sup-
ply) to stop a human environmental crisis from de-
veloping that could cause tremendous social unrest
and disturbance not previously seen:64

1. Control human population growth to the Unit-
ed  Nations’s  “low”  scenario  of  7  to  8  billion
people on Earth by 2050; we are presently on a
path to the “middle” scenario of 8 to 9 billion
people. Some keys to achieving this population
growth reduction are the education of women,
improved health care for children, and a gener-
al rise in the standard of living (see Chapter 1).
2. Conserve  and  sustain  water  resources,  espe-
cially groundwater. Use of groundwater has al-
lowed grain production to triple in the past half
century,  while  the  population  has  more  than
doubled.  Water  resources  are  simultaneously
being  depleted  in  all  grain  belts  of  the  world
(the United States, China, India, and Canada).
We  know  how  to  conserve  and  sustain  water
(see Chapter 13) but need policies that include
pricing water at its real value, not a subsidized
lower price. We need to implement water con-
servation technology for agriculture and other
uses sooner rather than later.

3. Control carbon emissions and minimize global
warming.  Each  incremental  increase  in  warm-
ing results in the loss of a small portion of our
grain crops to droughts and other water-related
hazards. Warming above a threshold tempera-
ture  causes  reduction  of  grain  productivity.
Solutions  to  minimize  global  warming  were
discussed in Chapter 18. They include a shift to
a different mix of energy sources (especially re-
newable sources, such as wind and solar power)
that  release  much  less  carbon  dioxide  and
using  many  more  energy  conservation  tech-
nologies, such as efﬁcient appliances, bulbs for
lighting,  and  more  fuel-efﬁcient  automobiles.
We need to transition from fossil fuels, which
are  contributing  to  global  warming,  to  fuels
produced from renewable energy, such as wind
and  solar  power.  We  need  to  do  this  sooner
rather than later.

Attaining Sustainability 
for the Future
Understanding  sustainability  is  a  main  objective
of this book. However, the concept of sustainabil-
ity  is  a  controversial  topic.  To  promote  sustain-
ability, as applied to development or planning, we

must  first  ensure  that  our  renewable  resources,
such as water, air, soil, and living things, are main-
tained for future generations and ecosystems. Sec-
ond, we must ensure that human processes do not
degrade these resources.

Sustainable use of nonrenewable resources, such
as  fossil  fuels  and  minerals  that  are  a  part  of  our
natural heritage from the geologic past, is not possi-
ble. The best we can do is to use the nonrenewable
resources in ways that will allow future generations
to have their fair share. Through conservation and
recycling,  we  can  greatly  extend  the  availability  of
mineral  resources.  With  respect  to  renewable  re-
sources,  the  concept  of  sustainability  is  central  to
future  environmental  planning  and  our  preserva-
tion of a quality environment.

The important question is How can we develop a
sustainable future? In discussing this topic, I make a
number of value judgments about our present devel-
opment  as  a  society.  These  are  my  opinions;  your
opinions may be different. This discussion is not sci-
ence, based upon facts and testing hypotheses, but
follows  from  what  we  learn  from  science.  This  dis-
tinction is important. Our present path of overpopu-
lation, resource consumption, and pollution is clearly
not  a  sustainable  one.  What  is  required  is  develop-
ment of a new path that will transform our present
way of running society, with creation of wealth as a
main goal, into one that integrates social, industrial,
agricultural, and environmental interest into a har-
monious,  sustainable  system.65 This  will  include:66

• An evolution of values and lifestyles that move
toward sustainability. In the United States, we
are already there with respect to values. Survey
after survey has conﬁrmed that the vast major-
ity  of  people  in  the  United  States  state  that
protecting  the  environment  should  be  a  top
priority. About half the people believe that en-
vironmental protection does not need to con-
ﬂict with economic growth.

• Recognition  that  sustainable  development
needs to include all people on Earth, rich and
poor  alike,  and  that  we  need  to  provide  a
higher standard of living for all, without com-
promising  the  environment.  That 
is,  we
should assist the disadvantaged people of the
world,  not  take  advantage  of  them.  Working
people need a living wage with which they can
support  their  families.  Exploitation  of  other

countries’ resources and labor to reduce costs
of  manufacturing  goods  or  growing  food  un-
dermines us all.

• Planning  for  future  population  changes,  re-
source use, and natural hazards in a proactive
way,  rather  than  waiting  for  surprises  or
shocks and then reacting.

The world population is going to continue to in-
crease dramatically for at least the next few decades,
and this increase will be most apparent in the devel-
oping  world,  where  birth  rates  are  the  highest.  As
more land is needed to house our growing popula-
tion,  more  and  more  people  will  be  put  at  risk  in
terms  of  their  proximity  to  hazardous  processes,
such as hurricanes, ﬂooding, landslides, volcanic ac-
tivity,  and  earthquakes.  Past  experience  suggests
that  we  are  not  particularly  well  prepared  to  deal
with many of these hazards when they occur in pop-
ulated areas. Therefore, a major goal of environmen-
tal  geology  is  to  identify  hazardous  processes  and
work  to  minimize  their  potential  effects  through
sound  land-use  planning,  a  better  general  under-
standing of the processes, and a potential range of
strategies  that  might  help  us  learn  to  better  live
with our planet. Achieving this goal is particularly
important for the future because, as population in-
creases,  there  will  be  continued  demand  for  more
and  more  land  on  which  people  can  live.  Urban
areas  will  increase  in  size  to  become  giant  urban
corridors,  particularly  along  some  of  the  coastal
areas, where people tend to be most concentrated.
Therefore,  it  behooves  us  to  learn  from  our  past
mistakes and to ensure that future development is
wise development.

I  hope  I  am  “preaching  to  the  choir”  and  that
many of you who have studied environmental geol-
ogy will have a better awareness of the world around
you and the geologic processes that operate within
it. As a result, you are empowered to become more
in tune with the natural processes of Earth and now
have the knowledge to make wiser choices concern-
ing how we use Earth resources, where we live, and
how we build a society with the objective of sustain-
able planning. These choices are really the heart of
ensuring that our future world will be safer for peo-
ple and that society will live more in harmony with
the  environment  than  in  the  past.  This  is  your
charge as the next generation.

CHAPTER 19

Geology, Society, and the Future

Making The Connection
Linking the Opening Case History About Radon Gas to the Fundamental Concepts

Consider and discuss the
following questions:

1. What are the impacts of popula-

tion increase on the potential
radon hazard in homes?

2. Is management of the radon gas
hazard possible? How is manage-
ment linked to education?

3. What are some science and value

issues related to the radon gas
hazard?

Summary

The death rate and incidence of spe-
ciﬁc diseases vary from one area to
another; some of the variability has
geologic linkages. The causes are
often quite complex, and a particular
disease seldom has a one-cause/one-
effect relationship. Nevertheless, con-
siderable evidence suggests that the
geochemical environment is a signiﬁ-
cant factor in the incidence of some
serious, chronic health problems, in-
cluding heart disease and cancer.

The atmosphere is a fast-ﬂowing

medium, too often used by people for
waste disposal. Every year, several
hundred million metric tons of pollu-
tants enter the atmosphere above the
United States from processes related
to human activity. Considering the
enormous volume of the atmosphere,
this is a relatively small amount of
material. If it were distributed uni-
formly, there would be fewer prob-
lems with air pollution. Unfortu-
nately, in general, pollutants are not
evenly distributed but are concen-
trated in urban areas or in other areas
where the air naturally lingers.

Particulate-matter pollutants are
small particles of solid or liquid sub-
stances that are designated PM 10 or
PM 2.5, depending on size. PM 10
particles are less than 10 μm in diam-
eter; they are released into the atmos-
phere by many natural processes and
human activities. Desertiﬁcation,

volcanic eruptions, ﬁres, and modern
farming all add large amounts of par-
ticulate matter to the air. Nearly all
industrial processes release particu-
lates into the atmosphere, as does the
burning of fossil fuels. Much particu-
late matter is easily visible as smoke,
soot, or dust, but some particulate
matter is not readily apparent. Particu-
lates include airborne asbestos particles
and small particles of heavy metals,
such as arsenic, copper, lead, and zinc,
which are usually emitted from indus-
trial facilities, such as smelters.

Meteorological and topographic

conditions in a particular urban area
greatly affect the potential for air pol-
lution problems. In particular, re-
stricted lower-atmosphere circulation,
associated with temperature inver-
sion layers, may lead to pollution
events, especially in cities lying in a
“bowl” surrounded by mountains. Air
pollution over an urban area is di-
rectly proportional to the emission
rate of pollution and the downwind
travel distance of pollutants over the
city; pollution is inversely propor-
tional to the wind velocity and the
height of the mixing layer of the at-
mosphere over the urban area.

A growing problem in urban areas
is indoor air pollution, caused by tight
insulation of modern buildings, emis-
sion of toxic gases from building ma-
terials, and circulation of toxic gases,

smoke, and disease-causing organ-
isms through ventilation systems.
Radon gas is a serious indoor air pol-
lutant with a natural source.

Industrialization and urbanization
have produced enormous amounts of
waste and greatly compounded the
problem of waste management.
Around many large cities, space for new
landﬁlls is becoming hard to ﬁnd, and
few people wish to live near any waste
disposal operation. We are headed
toward a disposal crisis if the new
methods and ideas of integrated waste
management are not acted on soon.
Since the Industrial Revolution,
waste management practices have
moved from “dilute and disperse,” to
“concentrate and contain,” to inte-
grated waste management (IWM),
which includes alternatives such as
reducing, reusing, recycling, landﬁll-
ing, incinerating, and composting.
The goal of many of these alterna-
tives, which can be summarized as
“reduce, reuse, and recycle,” is to re-
duce the total amount of waste that
needs to be disposed of in landﬁlls or
incinerators.

The most common sites for dis-
posal of urban waste in the United
States today are sanitary landﬁlls, in
which the waste deposited each day is
covered with a layer of compacted
soil. Potential hazards from sanitary
landﬁlls are pollution of groundwater

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts

703

by leachate (i.e., polluted water) from
the site and uncontrolled production
of methane. However, if methane is
contained, it is a useful by-product of
landﬁll operations. Under arid condi-
tions, buried waste produces little
leachate; in humid regions, the most
suitable sites for landﬁlls are where
waste can be buried well above the
water table in clay and silt soil of low
hydraulic conductivity. Modern sani-
tary landﬁlls have multiple barriers to
prevent leachate from inﬁltrating the
vadose zone (above the water table).
Sanitary landﬁlls have systems to
monitor the vadose zone and wells to
monitor groundwater. The siting and
operation of sanitary landﬁlls is regu-
lated by federal laws.

Hazardous waste management is a
serious environmental problem in the
United States. Hundreds or thou-
sands of uncontrolled disposal sites
may be time bombs that could even-
tually cause serious public health
problems. Because we continue to
produce hazardous waste, it is imper-
ative that safe disposal methods be
developed and used. Land-disposal
options for the management of waste

include secure landﬁlls, in which the
waste is conﬁned and the leachate is
controlled; land application, in which
suitable biodegradable materials are
spread on the surface; deep-well injec-
tion; and incineration, with disposal
of the residue by secure landﬁll.

The probable effects of human use

of the land are called the environ-
mental impact. The National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires
preparation of an environmental im-
pact statement (EIS) for every major
federal action that could signiﬁcantly
affect the quality of the human envi-
ronment. Scoping and mitigation are
important processes in environmen-
tal impact work.

Land use is an important environ-

mental issue. Urbanization of rural
areas may destroy agricultural land or
damage ecosystems with high scenic
or recreational value. The limited
land available for urban area expan-
sion has led to the concept of sequen-
tial and multiple land use rather than
permanent consignment of land to a
single use. Land use planning is es-
sential for sound economic develop-
ment and maintaining a high quality

of life. The basic philosophy of sus-
tainable planning, from an Earth sci-
ence perspective, is to plan to avoid
hazards, conserve natural resources,
and, generally, protect the environ-
ment through the use of sound eco-
logical principles.

Environmental law is now an im-
portant part of law. There is a move
toward problem solving and media-
tion rather than confrontation and
adversarial positions in environmen-
tal matters. When negotiation re-
places inﬂexibility, progress in solving
problems is enhanced.

Geology has an important message

for our future and the environment:
We live on a dynamic planet and must
make careful decisions concerning
where we choose to live and how we
plan for sustainability. This is the
essence of the linkages between geol-
ogy, society, and the future. It is be-
coming clear that we cannot continue
“business as usual” with respect to
how we have treated the environment.
To avoid a crisis, we need to control
human population growth, conserve
our water resources, and minimize
human-induced global warming.

Revisiting Fundamental Concepts
Human Population Growth
Human population increase is an im-
portant factor in nearly all relation-
ships between geology and society.
Increasing numbers of people require
the use of more resources and pro-
duce more chemicals and waste. Find-
ing socially acceptable ways of con-
trolling human population is a
fundamental goal of environmental
science and its subdiscipline environ-
mental geology.

achieve sustainability is not entirely
clear. It will require a new way of think-
ing that will transform our society with
industrial, agricultural, and environ-
mental interests to a system more in
harmony with natural and human-
modiﬁed ecosystems.

Earth as a System Understanding
relationships between society and ge-
ology requires an understanding of
how physical, hydrologic, and biologi-
cal systems function and change and
of how they are linked to the cultures
and societies of the world. Linkages
between systems are related to pat-
terns of disease and pollution that kill

Minerals

Characteristic Properties 
of Minerals
Characteristic  properties  of  speciﬁc  minerals  often
have aesthetic or utility value to people. For example,
Stone  Age  people  valued  natural  volcanic  obsidian
glass and ﬁne-grained quartz, called ﬂint, for making
tools.  High-quality  stone  tools  were  collected  and
traded  among  different  tribes  on  a  regional  scale.
Similarly,  native  copper,  when  discovered  in  the
Great Lakes region by Native Americans, was valued
for its metallic properties of luster and malleability
(discussed later) and was used for jewelry and tools.
Many ancient cultures, in addition to our own, have
valued  gemstones  such  as  rubies  and  sapphires  for
their  beauty.  Historically,  one  of  the  most  valued
minerals  has  been  halite  (NaCl),  or  common  table
salt, because all animals, including people, need it to
live. Halite has been mined and obtained from evap-
oration  ponds  for  thousands  of  years.  Some  clay
minerals  have  been  highly  valued  because  they  can
be molded into useful containers, pots, and decora-
tive statues and painted with black, red, and orange
paints made from still other minerals. Today, speciﬁc
physical properties of a wide variety of minerals are
used  for  everything  from  ceramics  to  electronics,
metallurgy,  agriculture,  and  personal  jewelry.  Now
let us take a closer look at properties of minerals.

Identifying Minerals
As discussed in Chapter 3, the identiﬁcation of min-
erals from hand specimens is a combination of pat-
tern recognition and testing for particular properties
or  characteristics  of  minerals.  These  include  color,
speciﬁc gravity, cleavage, crystal form, fracture, hard-
ness, luster, and other diagnostic properties charac-
teristic of a particular mineral or group of minerals.

Color
The  color of  a  mineral  can  be  misleading  because  a
given  mineral  may  have  several  different  colors,  or

A-2

several  different  minerals  may  have  the  same  color.
Depending on the impurities present, quartz may be
clear, pink, purple, yellow, or smoky black. The color a
mineral leaves as a powder when rubbed on a porce-
lain plate, or “streak plate,” is more reliable. The min-
eral  hematite,  Fe2O3,  may  be  dull  black  or  a  shiny,
dark metallic silver color, but its streak is always red.

Speciﬁc Gravity
The  speciﬁc gravity of  a  mineral  is  the  density  of  a
mineral compared with the density of water. Water
has  a  speciﬁc  gravity  of  1.  The  speciﬁc  gravity  of
minerals varies from about 2.2 for halite to 19.3 for
gold. Most minerals have speciﬁc gravities of about
2.5 to 4.5. In practice, we take a sample of a mineral
in hand, heft it, and estimate if it is light, medium,
or heavy.

Cleavage
Cleavage is  the  way  a  mineral  tends  to  part  along
planes of weakness determined by the internal crys-
talline structure and types of chemical bonds in the
mineral.  Several  common  types  of  cleavage  are
shown in Figure A.1.

Crystal Form
Crystal form is also a useful diagnostic property for
mineral identiﬁcation (see Figure 3.5). For example,
the elongated hexagonal pointed crystals of quartz
(SiO2), regardless of the color of the specimen, are
diagnostic, as are the cube-shaped crystals of pyrite
(FeS2).

Fracture
The  way  a  mineral  commonly  breaks,  or  fractures,
may also help identify it. Terms to describe fracture
include  blocky,  splintery,  ﬁbrous,  or  conchoidal.
Conchoidal  means  that  the  material  fractures  like
glass, usually with curved surfaces that look some-
thing like a clamshell.

where 1, the hardness of the mineral talc, is the soft-
est, and 10, the hardness of diamond, is the hardest
(Table A.1). Unit increase in the scale is not equiva-
lent to an equal increase in hardness. The hardness
of a mineral is determined by a series of tests using
the Mohs Hardness scale. Any mineral or substance
will scratch a mineral with a lower hardness on the
Mohs scale. Trying to scratch a mineral sample of un-
known hardness with a knife blade (hardness about
5.5) will tell you if your unknown mineral is harder
or  softer  than  5.5.  Then,  using  other  minerals  or
substances on the Mohs scale, you can determine the
relative hardness of the unknown mineral sample.

(c) Two directions of cleavage
     not at right angles. Mineral
     example: amphibole

(d) Three directions of cleavage
     at right angles. Mineral
     examples: halite, galena

(e) Three directions of cleavage
     not at right angles. Mineral
     example: calcite
FIGURE A.1 Some common types of cleavage with
mineral examples Cleavage, with the exception of mica, is
shown by dashed lines. (a) Mica has one cleavage direction and
breaks into sheets. (b) Feldspar and pyroxene have two cleavage
directions and break at right or nearly right angles. (c) Amphibole
has two directions of cleavage that do not meet at right angles.
(d) Halite and galena have three cleavage directions that meet at
right angles. They break into cube-shaped fragments. (e) Calcite
also has three cleavage directions, but they do not meet at right
angles. Calcite breaks into rhombohedrons.

Hardness
The  relative  hardness of  minerals  is  determined  by
using a scale suggested by the Austrian mineralogist
Friedrich  Mohs.  The  scale  ranges  from  1  to  10,

Luster
Luster refers to the way light is reﬂected from a min-
eral.  Some  minerals  have  metallic  luster  with  high
reﬂectivity. Other minerals are translucent or trans-
parent to light and have a nonmetallic luster. Some
minerals  have  more  than  one  luster.  For  example,
some  samples  of  graphite  have  metallic  luster  and
others are nonmetallic. Terms to describe luster in-
clude pearly, greasy, and earthy.

Table A.2 (page A-5) contains a list of some of
the  common  minerals  and  their  properties.  An
identiﬁcation key (Table A.3, page A-10) may assist
in  the  actual  identiﬁcation.  In  Table  A.3 the  ﬁrst
step is to decide if the mineral has a metallic or a
nonmetallic luster. The second step is to determine
the  relative  hardness.  Third,  decide  whether  the
mineral  has  a  cleavage.  Fourth,  use  characteristic
properties, including streak and fracture, to assist
in the ﬁnal identiﬁcation.

It  is  important  to  note  that  actual  identiﬁca-
tion of minerals in the ﬁeld or in the laboratory from
small  specimens,  using  simple  tests  and  perhaps  a
hand lens to determine cleavage and other proper-
ties, is basically a pattern recognition exercise. After
you have looked at a number of minerals over a peri-
od of time and have learned how particular minerals
vary, you will become more proﬁcient at identifying
a particular sample. When positive identiﬁcation is
necessary, mineralogists will use a variety of sophis-
ticated equipment to determine the chemical com-
position and internal structure to positively identify
minerals.

TABLE A.3 Key to Assist Mineral Identiﬁcation. 

To use this table, (1) make a decision as to whether the luster of the mineral to be identiﬁed is nonmetallic or metallic. If it is nonmetallic,
decide whether it is a light-colored or a dark-colored mineral; (2) use a knife blade to determine if the mineral specimen is harder or
softer than the knife blade; (3) look for evidence of cleavage; and (4) compare your samples with the other properties shown here and
use Table A.2 for ﬁnal identiﬁcation.

Appendix B
Rocks

In Chapter 3 we stated that a rock is an aggregate of
one or more minerals. In traditional geologic inves-
tigations,  this  is  the  most  commonly  used  deﬁni-
tion. The terminology of environmental geology is
somewhat  different;  in  environmental  geology,  we
are primarily concerned with properties that affect
engineering design and environmental problems. In
environmental  and  engineering  geology,  the  term
rock is reserved for Earth materials that cannot be
removed  without  blasting  using  explosives  such  as
dynamite;  Earth  materials  that  can  be  excavated
with normal earth-moving equipment, for example,
a shovel or a bulldozer, are called soil. Thus, a very
friable,  or  loosely  compacted,  poorly  cemented
sandstone may be considered a soil, whereas a well-
compacted clay may be called a rock. This pragmatic
terminology  conveys  more  useful  information  to
planners  and  designers  than  do  the  conventional
terms.  Clay,  for  example,  is  generally  unconsoli-
dated  and  easily  removed.  A  contractor,  assuming
that a material described as clay is a soil, might bid
low for an excavation job, thinking that the material
can  be  removed  without  blasting.  If  the  clay  turns
out to be well compacted, however, it may have to be
blasted,  which  is  a  much  more  expensive  process.
Performing  a  preliminary  investigation  and  fore-
warning  the  contractor  to  consider  the  clay  a  rock
can avoid this kind of error. (Soils and their proper-
ties are considered in detail in Chapter 16.)

Identifying Rocks
Rocks  are  composed  of  minerals.  Whereas  some
rocks  contain  only  one  mineral,  most  contain  sev-
eral. As it is for minerals, the identiﬁcation of rocks
from a hand specimen is primarily a pattern recog-
nition  exercise.  However,  there  are  some  useful
hints that will assist you. The ﬁrst task is to decide if
the  rock  is  igneous,  sedimentary,  or  metamorphic.
Sometimes this decision is not as easy as you might

B-2

think.  It  is  particularly  difﬁcult  to  identify  rocks
that are ﬁne grained. A specimen is considered ﬁne
grained if you cannot see individual mineral grains
with your naked eye. It is advisable to use a magni-
fying glass or hand lens to assist you in your evalua-
tion of the properties of minerals and rocks. Some
general  rules  of  thumb  will  assist  you  in  getting
started:  (1)  If  the  sample  is  composed  of  bits  and
pieces of other rocks, it is most likely sedimentary;
(2) if the rock specimen is foliated (a feature some-
times called rock cleavage, produced by the parallel
alignment  of  mineral  grains),  then  it  is  metamor-
phic; (3) if individual mineral crystals are relatively
coarse grained, meaning you can see them with the
naked eye or easily with a hand lens, and the crys-
tals are interlocking and composed of minerals such
as quartz and feldspar, it is probably a plutonic ig-
neous rock such as granite; (4) if the rock is mostly
ﬁne grained but contains some larger crystals (phe-
nocrysts), it is probably an extrusive igneous rock;
(5) if the rock is relatively soft and effervesces when
diluted hydrochloric acid is applied, it is probably a
carbonate  rock,  most  likely  limestone  or,  if  meta-
morphic,  marble;  (6)  if  it’s  a  really  grungy,  soft,
highly weathered, or altered rock, as many in nature
seem  to  be,  you  are  going  to  have  some  problems
identifying it!

Strength of Common 
Rock Types
The strength of a rock is commonly reported in terms
of  its  compressive  strength,  which  is  the  compres-
sion,  as  mechanically  applied  in  a  viselike  machine,
necessary  to  break  or  fracture  the  specimen.  The
strength of a rock is reported as a force per unit area,
which  in  the  metric  system  is  reported  in  Newtons
per  meter  squared  (N/m2).  Ranges  of  compressive
strength  for  some  of  the  common  rock  types  are
shown in Table B.1.

Physical Properties of Rocks
Physical  properties  of  rocks  include  color,  speciﬁc
gravity,  relative  hardness,  porosity,  permeability,
texture, and strength.

Color. The color of a rock varies depending upon
the minerals present and the amount of weathering
that has occurred. Rocks encountered in their natur-
al  environment  are  various  shades  of  light  gray  to
brown  to  black.  They  have  black  to  orange  linear
stains  frequently,  at  the  surface,  produced  by  iron
oxides.

Specific  Gravity  and  Relative  Hardness.
The same deﬁnition of speciﬁc gravity we gave for
minerals applies to rocks and refers to the weight of
the rock relative to the weight of water. Some rocks
are  lighter  than  water  and  will  ﬂoat.  For  example,
pumice,  a  light-colored,  volcanic  rock  with  many
vesicles, or cavities, is lighter than water. Rocks be-
come heavier as iron- and magnesium-bearing min-
erals become more abundant. There is no scale for
relative rock hardness similar to the Mohs scale for
minerals.  Soft  rocks  can  be  broken  with  your  ﬁn-
gers,  and  hard  rocks  require  a  sledgehammer  to
break apart.

Porosity  and  Permeability. Porosity is  the
percentage of a rock’s volume that contains empty
space  between  grains,  or  open  space  in  fractures.
Permeability is the capacity of a porous rock to trans-
mit a ﬂuid, usually oil or water (see Chapter 11). The
coefﬁcient  of  permeability  is  known  as  hydraulic
conductivity with units of velocity (length per unit
time). Values of porosity and hydraulic conductivity
for several types of rocks and sediments are shown
in Table 3.4. The properties of porosity and perme-
ability  are  very  important  in  understanding  many
environmental  problems  and  geologic  hazards,  in-
cluding waste disposal, water pollution, landsliding,
and even earthquakes.

Texture. The texture of a rock refers to the size,
shape,  and  arrangement  of  the  crystals  or  grains
within it. In general, a rock is ﬁne grained if you can-
not see mineral crystals or grains with your naked
eye; a rock is considered coarse grained if crystals or
grains are visible. The shape of crystals and grains
varies from regular and rounded to interlocking and
angular. Angular grains are irregular with sharp cor-
ners.  A  rock  may  have  lots  of  openings  between
grains or in fractures with a relatively high porosi-
ty. If these openings are partially filled with small-
er  grains  or  cementing  materials,  the  porosity  is

reduced. Porosity decreases from about 30 percent
to 5 percent as pore spaces are filled with smaller
grains  or  cementing  material  such  as  calcite
(CaCO3), quartz (SiO2), or gypsum (CaSO4 · 2H2O).
Coarse grains of sand (1 to 2 mm, or 0.04 to 0.08
in.,  in  diameter)  are  shown  in  Figure  B.1a.  If  the
range of sizes of grains is large, the distribution of
grains  is  poorly  sorted (Figure  B.1b).  Conversely,  if

the  grains  of  sand  are  all  approximately  the  same
size,  the  distribution  of  grains  is  described  as  well
sorted (Figure B.1a, c).

Other rock textures are characterized by vesi-
cles,  or  cavities,  formed  by  gas  expansion  during
their formation. For example, vesicular rocks com-
monly occur near the surface of a lava ﬂow where gas
is escaping.

Maps and Related Topics

Topographic Maps
As  the  name  suggests,  topographic  maps  illustrate
the  topography  at  the  surface  of  Earth.  The  topo-
graphic maps show an area’s natural and human-made
features graphically. Elevations and some other nat-
ural features are shown by contour lines, which are
lines of equal elevation. Individual contour lines on a
topographic  map  are  a  ﬁxed  interval  of  elevation
apart, and this interval is known as the contour inter-
val. Common contour intervals are 5, 10, 20, 40, 80,
or 100 meters or feet. The actual contour interval of
a particular map depends upon the topography being
represented  as  well  as  the  scale  of  the  map.  If  the
topography has a relatively low relief (difference in
elevation  between  the  highest  point  and  lowest
point  of  a  map),  then  the  contour  interval  may  be
relatively small, but if the relief is large, then larger
contour intervals are necessary or the lines will be-
come so bunched up as to be impossible to read. This
brings up an important point: Where contour lines
are close together, the surface of Earth at that point
has a relatively steep slope, compared to other areas
where the contour lines are farther apart.

The scale of a topographic map (or of any map,
for that matter) may be delineated in several ways.
First, a scale may be stated as a ratio, say 1 to 24,000
(1:24,000),  which  means  that  1  inch  on  a  map  is
equal to 24,000 inches or 2,000 feet on the ground.
Second,  a  topographic  map  may  have  a  bar  scale
often found in the lower margin of the map useful
for measuring distances. Finally, scales of some maps
are stated in terms of speciﬁc units of length on the
map; for example, it might be stated on the map that
1 inch equals 200 feet. This means that 1 inch on the
map is equivalent to 200 feet (which is 2,400 inches)
on  the  ground.  In  this  example  we  could  also  state
that the scale is 1 to 2,400. The most common scale
used  by  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  Topographic
Maps is 1:24,000, but scales of 1:125,000 or smaller
are also used. Remember, 1 ⫼ 24,000 is a larger num-
ber than 1 ⫼ 125,000, so 1 ⫼ 125,000 is the smaller

scale. The smaller the scale of maps of similar physi-
cal map size, the more area is shown.

In addition to contour lines, topographic maps
also show a number of cultural features, such as roads,
houses, and other buildings. Features such as streams
and rivers are often shown in blue. In fact, a whole se-
ries  of  symbols  are  commonly  used  on  topographic
maps. These symbols are shown in Figure C.1.

Reading Topographic Maps
Reading  or  interpreting  topographic  maps  is  as
much an art as it is a science. After you have looked
at many topographic maps that represent the vari-
ety of landforms and features found at the surface
of Earth, you begin to recognize these forms by the
shapes of the contours. This is a process that takes a
fair amount of time and experience in looking at a
variety  of  maps.  However,  there  are  some  general
rules that do help in reading topographic maps.

• Valleys containing rivers or even small streams
have  contours  that  form  Vs that  point  in  the
upstream direction. This is sometimes known
as the rule of Vs. Thus, if you are trying to draw
the  drainage  pattern  that  shows  all  the
streams, you should continue the stream in the
upstream  direction  as  long  as  the  contours
are  still forming a V pattern. Near a drainage
divide, the Vs will no longer be noticeable.

• Where contour lines are spaced close together,
the slope is relatively steep, and where contour
lines are spaced relatively far apart, the slope is
relatively  low.  Where  contour  lines  that  are
spaced  relatively  far  apart  change  to  become
closer  together,  we  say  a  “break  in  slope”  has
occurred.  This  is  commonly  observed  at  the
foot of a mountain or where valley side slopes
change to a ﬂoodplain environment.

• Contours near the upper parts of hills or moun-
tains  may  show  a  closure.  These  may  be  rela-
tively oval or round for a conical peak or longer
and narrower for a ridge. Remember, the actual

elevation of a peak is higher than the last con-
tour  shown  and  may  be  estimated  by  taking
half the contour interval. That is, if the highest
contour on a peak were 1,000 m with a contour
interval of 50 m, then you would assume that
the top of the mountain is 1,025 m.

• Topographic depressions that form closed con-
tours have hachure marks on the contours and
are useful in indicating the presence of such a
depression.

• Sometimes the topography on a slope is hum-
mocky and anomalous to the general topogra-
phy of the area. Such hummocky topography is
often suggestive of the existence of mass wast-
ing processes and landslide deposits.
In summary, after observing a variety of topo-
graphic maps and working with them for some time,
you will begin to see the pattern of contours as an
actual landscape consisting of hills and valleys and
other features.

Locating Yourself On A Map
The ﬁrst time you take a topographic map into the
ﬁeld with you, you may have some difﬁculty locating
where you are. Determining where you are is crucial
in  trying  to  prepare  maps  to  show  particular  fea-
tures—for  example,  the  locations  of  ﬂoodplains,
landslides,  or  other  features.  One  way  to  locate
yourself  on  a  map  is  to  recognize  certain  features
such  as  mountain  peaks,  intersections  of  roads,  a
prominent  bend  in  a  road  or  river,  or  some  other
readily  recognized  feature.  Then  work  it  out  from
there  with  a  compass.  That  is,  you  might  take  a
bearing  (compass  direction)  to  several  prominent
features and draw these bearings on the map; your
location is where they intersect. Today, however, we
have more modern technology for locating ourselves
and working with maps. Global Positioning Systems
(GPS)  are  readily  available  at  a  very  modest  price
and  assist  in  locating  a  position  on  the  surface  of
Earth. Hand-held GPS systems are readily available
today and can generally locate your position on the
ground with an accuracy of about 30 m. The GPS
receivers  work  by  receiving  signals  from  three  or
four satellites and measuring the distance from the
satellite to your location. This is done by measuring
the time it takes for the signal from your receiver to
reach the satellite and return. The accuracy of deﬁn-
ing your position can be reduced to approximately

APPENDIX C

Maps and Related Topics

C-3

1 m by utilizing a reference receiver on the ground
that  communicates  with  the  satellites  and  then
working out your position relative to the reference
receiver, as shown in Figure C.2.

Global  Positioning  Systems  are  commonly
linked to computers, so when a position is known, it
may be plotted directly on a map viewed on a com-
puter screen. GPS technology is revolutionizing the
way  we  do  our  mapping,  is  becoming  widely  avail-
able, and is a valuable research tool in the ﬁeld.

A  word  of  information  here  concerning  the
term in the ﬁeld. When geologists use the term in the
ﬁeld, we mean “outside on the surface on Earth” and
are not referring to the “ﬁeld of geology.” For exam-
ple, I am now about to go out and study the coastline
of California after the El Niño storms. I would say to
my colleagues, “I am going into the ﬁeld.”

An Example From A Coastal
Landscape
A coastal landscape is shown in Figure C.3 (page C-6).
As illustrated in (a), which is an oblique view of the
topography,  the  area  is  characterized  by  two  hills
with an intervening valley. A coastal seacliff is shown
on the east (right) part of the diagram, and a sand-
spit  produced  by  longshore  coastal  processes  (see
Chapter 10) with a hook on the end suggests that the
direction  of  sand  transport  in  the  surf  zone  and
beach is from the east (right) to the west (left) along
this coastal area. A topographic map for the area is
shown in (b). Notice that the contour interval (CI) is
20 ft. The elevation at the top of the highest hill on
the east side of the diagram would be approximately
290 ft; because the last contour is 280, and the hill
cannot be higher than 300, we split the difference.
Several streams ﬂow into the main valley; notice that
the  contours  V  in  the  upstream  direction,  particu-
larly toward the peak of elevation of approximately
270 ft. Other information that may be “read” from
the topographic map includes the following.

• The  landform  on  the  western  portion  of  the
map (left side) is a hill with elevation of about
275  ft  and  a  gentle  slope  to  the  west,  and  a
steep slope to the east (right) and toward the
ocean.  The  eastern  slope  is  particularly  steep
near  the  top  of  the  mountain  where  the  con-
tours are very close together.

• The center part of the map shows a river ﬂowing
into a bay protected by a hooked sand bar. The

relatively ﬂat land in the vicinity of the river is a
narrow  ﬂoodplain  with  a  light-duty  road  (see
Figure  C.3)  delineated  by  two  closely  spaced
lines extending along the western side. A second
unimproved road crosses the river and extends
out to the head of the sandspit, providing access
to a church and two other buildings. The ﬂood-
plain is delineated on both sides of the river by
the 20-ft contour, above which the 40-ft contour
is a break in slope at the edge of the valley.

• The eastern and southern slopes of the hill on
the west (left) side of the map with elevation of
about  275  ft  have  a  number  of  small  streams
ﬂowing mostly southward into the ocean. These
streams may be deﬁned as relatively steep gul-
lies that are dissecting (eroding) the hill.

• In contrast to the hill on the western part of the
map, the hill on the eastern part with elevation
of  approximately  290  ft  has  gentler  slopes  on

the eastern ﬂank, with streams spaced relatively
far  apart  ﬂowing  toward  the  river  and  the
ocean.  Thus,  we  could  state  that  the  streams
ﬂowing  to  the  main  river  valley  from  the  east
have dissected (eroded) the landscape more (to
a lower slope) than those streams ﬂowing into
the main valley from the west.

• In particular, note the stream channel just south
of the hill with elevation of about 275 ft on the
west  side  of  the  map.  That  stream  is  actively
eroding headward, forming a narrow, steep gully
denoted by the pattern of closely spaced contours
that  form  a  concave  indentation  into  the  more
gentle topography that forms the surface that is
sloping to the west from the top of the mountain.
To continue a study of this area, we might con-
struct  more  topographic  proﬁles  across  the  area
from east to west and also construct proﬁles of some
of the streams ﬂowing into the main valley. The next

task might be to obtain aerial photographs and geo-
logic maps to draw more conclusions concerning the
topography and geology.

Geologic Maps
Geologists are interested in the types of rocks found
in  a  particular  location  and  in  their  spatial  distribu-
tion. Producing a geologic map is a very basic step in
understanding the geology of an area. Geologic maps
are the fundamental database from which to interpret
the geology of an area. The ﬁrst step in preparing a ge-
ologic map is to obtain good base maps (usually topo-
graphic) or aerial photographs on which the geologic
information  may  be  transferred.  The  geologist  then
goes into the ﬁeld and makes observations at outcrops
where  the  rocks  may  be  observed.  Different  rock
types, units, or formations are mapped and the con-
tacts between varying rock types are mapped as lines
on the map. The attitude of sedimentary rock units is
designated by a T-shaped strike and dip symbol. The
strike is the compass direction of the intersection of

the rock layer with a horizontal plain, and the dip is
the  maximum  angle  the  rock  layer  makes  with  the
horizontal  (Figure  C.4).  Figure  C.5a shows  a  very
simple  geologic  map  with  three  rock  types—sand-
stone, shale, and limestone—over an area of approxi-
mately 1,350 km2. The arrangement of the strike and
dip  symbols  suggests  that  the  major  structure  is  an
anticline. A geologic cross section constructed across
the proﬁle along the line E-E’ is shown in Figure C.5b.

Geologists often make a series of cross sections to try
to better understand the geology of a particular area.
Geologic maps at a variety of scales from 1 to 250,000
down to 1 to 24,000 are generally available from a va-
riety of sources, including the U.S. Geological Survey.

Digital Elevation Models
Topographic data for many areas in the United States
and  other  parts  of  the  world  are  now  available  on
computer disk. The arrays of elevation values, which
may include, for example, the elevation of the ground
on a 30 m ⫻ 30 m ground spacing grid (area, 900 m2),
are  the  basic  topographic  data.  This  is  the  Digital
Elevation  Model  (DEM).  Computer  programs  are
then used to view the data, and color shading may be
provided  to  show  the  topography,  which  is  a  DEM
product. DEMs provide a visual representation of the
surface of Earth and can be “viewed” from a variety of
angles. That is, you may decide you would like to view
the topography obliquely from the south, north, east,
or west. The vertical dimension may also be exagger-
ated  so  that  minor  topographic  differences  may  be-
come more apparent. Figure C.6 shows a relief map
constructed from a digital elevation model for the Los
Angeles Basin. This clearly illustrates that Los Angeles
is nearly surrounded by mountains and hills, which
are  uplifted  by  recent  tectonic  activity.  DEMs  are

becoming important research tools in evaluating the
topography of an area. They may be used to delineate
and  map  such  features  as  fault  scarps,  drainages,
marine terraces, ﬂoodplains, and many other features
of the landscape.

For  detailed  studies  of  a  relatively  small  area
DEMs may be constituted from high resolution data
that has a horizontal spacing of elevation points of
1 m ⫻ 1 m where horizontal and vertical resolution is
about  0.5  m.  High  resolution  data  can  be  obtained
from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) from an
aircraft.  There  are  now  mobile  LiDAR  instruments
that can gather topographic data from the ground in
the  ﬁeld.  Repeated  LiDAR  surveys  over  periods  of
1–10 years can detect changes in landforms such as a
retreating sea cliff or slow moving landslide. 

Summary
Our discussion establishes that there are several types
of maps that are useful in evaluating a particular area
and  its  geology.  Of  particular  importance  are  topo-
graphic  maps  and  geologic  maps.  Digital  elevation
models  may  be  constructed  from  topographic  data,
and a variety of other special purpose maps are also
available. Examples include maps of recent landslides,
maps  of  ﬂoodplains,  and  engineering  geology  maps
that show engineering properties of earth materials.

Appendix D
How Geologists Determine
Geologic Time

In  order  to  understand  the  history  of  Earth,  we
have to determine the actual age of rocks and sedi-
ments. The science of dating rocks and sediments is
known as geochronology. Although it is possible
to establish relative geochronology based upon fos-
sil evidence using the law of faunal assemblages and
geologic relationships such as the laws of superpo-
sition and crosscutting relationships (see Chapters 1
and 3), it is absolute dating (numerical dating), that
provides  the  geochronology  necessary  to  establish
rates  of  geologic  processes  and  ages  of  rocks.  The
science of geochronology is expanding rapidly and
includes  a  number  of  techniques  that  provide  nu-
merical ages from a few years to a few billion years
(the age of Earth).

From  an  environmental  perspective,  it  is  im-
portant  to  be  able  to  establish  rates  of  geologic
processes and when geologic events such as volcanic
eruptions,  earthquakes,  ﬂoods,  and  landslides  oc-
curred in the past. The chronology of natural hazard
events is critical in establishing their return period
as part of better understanding hazards and predict-
ing when they are likely to occur in the future. That
is, we wish to establish rates of geologic processes of
signiﬁcance to society.

Geologic time is much different, in a way, than
our normal time framework. Although geologic time
and “normal” time use the same units of measure—
years—they differ vastly in duration and in the in-
struments we use to measure duration.1 Normal time
is  counted  in  hours,  days,  seasons,  or  decades,  and
the instrument used to measure time is a clock. For
“deep time” (geologic time), measured in millions to
hundreds  of  millions  to  several  billion  years,  geolo-
gists take advantage of naturally occurring isotopes
such  as  uranium-235,  uranium-238,  potassium-40,
or  carbon-14  to  date  the  rocks  in  which  these  iso-
topes occur. Dating is possible because the natural
decay  of  each  type  of  unstable  radioactive  isotope

D-2

occurs at a constant rate that can be used to deter-
mine the age of rocks in which that isotope occurs.
The  process  of  radioactive  decay  is  a  spontaneous
process in which the nucleus of a particular isotope
undergoes  a  change  while  emitting  one  or  more
forms of radiation (see Chapter 16, A Closer Look:
Radioactivity).  The  three  major  kinds  of  radiation
that are emitted during radioactive decay are called
alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma radiation.
Alpha  decay  is  particularly  signiﬁcant  because  the
decay consists of two protons and two neutrons. The
isotope  present  before  alpha  decay  is  known  as
the parent, and the new isotope present after decay is
known as the daughter product, which is an isotope
of a different element. Radioactive isotopes, particu-
larly those of very heavy elements, undergo a series
of radioactive decay steps that ﬁnally ends when a
stable,  nonradioactive  isotope  is  produced.  For  ex-
ample, uranium-238 undergoes 14 nuclear transfor-
mations emitting alpha, beta, and gamma radiation
in different steps to ﬁnally decay to stable lead-206,
which is not radioactive. An important characteris-
tic  of  a  radioisotope  such  as  U-238  is  its  half-life,
which  is  the  time  required  for  one-half  of  a  given
amount  of  the  isotope  to  decay  to  another  form.
Every  radioisotope  has  a  unique  and  characteristic
half-life.  Table  D.1 shows  four  parent  radioactive
isotopes, their daughter stable isotopes, and charac-
teristic half-lives. Figure D.1 shows in diagrammatic
form  the  reduction  of  a  parent  radioactive  isotope
and  concurrent  increase  in  the  daughter  product.
For  example,  after  one  half-life,  50  percent  of  the
original  parent  isotope  remains;  this  is  reduced  to
25 percent after two half-lives, and to 12.5 percent
after three half-lives. By the time six half-lives have
nearly passed, all the parent material has been lost
through  radioactive  decay.  As  the  parent  material
decreases,  the  daughter  product  increases  to  be
nearly  100  percent  by  six  half-lives.  Because  the

process  of  radioactive  decay  is  irreversible  and
occurs  at  a  constant  rate,  it  serves  as  a  clock  that
may be used for absolute (numerical) age dating in
years.  Because  radioisotopes  such  as  uranium-238,
uranium-235, and potassium-40 have relatively long
half-lives (Table D.1), their decay is useful in dating
rocks  on  the  order  of  millions  to  billions  of  years.
For example, radioactive uranium has been used to
date the oldest rocks on Earth at about 4.6 billion
years before present. The actual methods of measur-
ing  amounts  of  parent  and  daughter  isotopes  and
calculating numeric dates are complex and tedious,
although the concept is easy to grasp. These meth-
ods  have  been  used  successfully  to  develop  the
geochronology necessary to place numerical dates in
the geologic time table and to delineate important
Earth history events such as mountain building, ice
ages, and the appearance of life forms.

Number of half-lives

FIGURE D.1 Reduction of a parent radioactive
isotope to a daughter isotope with increasing half-lives.

Archeologists  and  anthropologists  concerned
with  human  history  are  interested  in  developing  a
geochronology with a duration of a few million years
or less, that is the period from which human and an-
cestral human fossils are found. From an environmen-
tal  geology  perspective,  we  are  often  interested  in
establishing the geochronology of the past few hun-
dred to few hundred thousand years of Earth’s history,
and  for  this  we  have  several  potential  methods.  For
example, the radioisotope uranium-234 undergoes ra-
dioactive decay at a known rate to thorium-230, and
the ratio of these two isotopes is useful in numerically
dating a variety of materials, such as coral, back to sev-
eral hundred thousand years. For sediments younger
than about 40,000 years, carbon-14 is used extensive-
ly  for  numerical  dating.  The  most  common  form  of
carbon is stable carbon-12, but carbon-14, which is ra-
dioactive, occurs in small quantities and undergoes ra-
dioactive  decay  to  the  stable  daughter 
isotope
nitrogen-14. The half-life of the decay of carbon-14 to
nitrogen-14  is  5,730  years.  The  carbon-14  method
works because organic material incorporates carbon-
14  into  living  tissue,  and  when  the  organism  dies
radioactive decay begins. Common materials dated by
carbon-14  include  wood,  bone,  charcoal,  and  other
types of buried organic material. Carbon-14 has a rela-
tively  short  half-life,  and,  as  a  result,  after  about
40,000  years  the  amount  of  carbon-14  remaining  is
very small and difﬁcult to measure. Consequently, use
of this technique is limited.

The ﬁeld of geochronology is expanding rapid-
ly, and new techniques are being developed as I write
this. For example, it is now possible to directly date
the  duration  that  a  landform  has  been  exposed  at
Earth’s  surface.  This  is  known  as  exposure  dating.
The basic idea is that certain isotopes—for example,
beryllium-10, aluminum-26, and chlorine-36—that

are produced when cosmic rays interact with Earth’s
atmosphere, accumulate in measurable quantities in
surface materials such as soils, alluvial deposits, and
exposed rock surfaces. Thus, the amount of accumu-
lation of these isotopes is a measure of the minimum
time of exposure to the surface environment.

Other  innovative  methods  of  developing  the
geochronology of an area are also being used. For ex-
ample, lichens, which are mosslike plants that grow
on  rock  surfaces,  are  known  to  have  given  growth
rates for particular species, and they tend to grow in
circular patches. Careful measurements of the size of
lichen  patches,  coupled  with  known  growth  rates,
provide minimum numerical ages for the rocks they
are found on. The method has been successfully used
in California and New Zealand to date regional occur-
rences  of  rockfalls  generated  by  large  earthquakes,
thus dating past seismic activity.2,3 Lichenometry can
provide  dates  to  about  1,000  years  before  present.
Sediments may also be accurately dated through the
use  of  dendrochronology,  which  is  the  analysis  of
annual growth rings to measure the age of woody ma-
terial found in sediments. The method has been used
extensively by archeologists to date prehistoric sites
of human habitation and also by climatologists as a
method  of  reconstructing  past  climates  in  terms  of
wet  and  dry  years.  Growth  rings  record  climate  be-
cause during dry years tree rings are narrow relative
to wet years. Very accurate numerical geochronology
may also be obtained from counting varves. A varve is

a layer of sediment representing one year of deposi-
tion, usually in a lake or an ocean. Careful counting 
of  varves  may  extend  the  chronology  back  several
thousand years.

The most accurate chronology is the historical
record, but in many parts of the world the historical
record is only a few hundred years (as for example, in
the United States). In other areas, such as China, the
historical  record  extends  several  thousand  years.
However,  given  the  brevity  of  human  history  com-
pared  with  the  great  length  of  geologic  history, 
we resort to numerical dating methods to establish
geochronology.  There  are  more  than  20  methods
useful  in  establishing  geochronology  that  yield  nu-
merical dates. This discussion presents only a few of
these  at  a  very  elementary  level.  The  science  of
geochronology  is  complex  but  extremely  crucial  to
understanding rates of geologic processes and plac-
ing geologic events in chronological order.

Darcy’s Law

In  1856  an  engineer  named  Henry  Darcy  was
working  on  the  water  supply  for  Dijon,  France.  He
performed  a  series  of  important  experiments  that
demonstrated that the discharge (Q) of groundwater
may be deﬁned as the product of the cross-sectional
area of ﬂow (A), the hydraulic gradient (I), and the
hydraulic conductivity (K). Thus,
Q = KIA

The unit on each side of the equation is a volumetric
flow rate (such as cubic meters per day), and the
relationship is known as Darcy’s law. The quantity
Q/A = KI

is the Darcy ﬂux (v). We may say that
n = Q/A

Q = nA

or

Although v has the unit of a velocity, the Darcy ﬂux
is only an apparent velocity. To determine the actual
velocity of groundwater in an aquifer (vx) we must
remember  that  the  water  moves  through  pore
spaces, so its velocity is affected by the porosity of
the aquifer material. If we let n represent the poros-
ity, then the actual cross-sectional area of ﬂow is An,
and it follows from 

Q = nA
nx = Q/An = n/n

that
or

nx = KI/n

The actual velocity vx is about three times the Darcy
ﬂux (assuming an average value of 

n = 0.33

).

The driving force for groundwater ﬂow is called
the ﬂuid potential or hydraulic head, which at the
point of measurement is the sum of the elevation of
the water (elevation head) and the ratio of the ﬂuid
pressure to the unit weight of water (pressure head).
The  difference  in  hydraulic  heads  between  two
points (h) divided by the ﬂow length (L) gives us the
hydraulic gradient (I).

Groundwater  always  moves  from  an  area  of
higher hydraulic head to an area of lower hydraulic
head and may therefore move down, laterally, or up-
ward, depending upon local conditions.

Darcy’s  law  has  many  important  applications
to  groundwater problems. For example, consider an
area underlain by sedimentary rocks with a semiarid

climate. The area is dissected by a river system in a
valley approximately 4 km wide. Alluvial deposits in
the valley form an aquifer conﬁned by a clay layer, and
two wells have been drilled approximately 1 km apart
in  the  down-valley  direction  (Figure  E.1a).  A  cross-
valley section between the wells (Figure E.1b) shows
that  the  saturated  zone  is  25  m  thick,  consists  of
sand and gravel, and has a hydraulic conductivity of
100 m/day (
). Porosity (n) of the
aquifer  materials  is  30  percent  (0.3).  A  down-valley
section is shown in Figure E.1, part c. The wells are
separated by 1,000 m and the elevation of the water
in wells 1 and 2 are, respectively, 98 m and 97 m. Two
questions  we  might  ask  concerning  the  conditions
shown in Figure E.1 are

1.2 * 10 -3 m/ sec 

1. What is the discharge Q (m3/sec or gallons per
day)  of  water  moving  through  the  aquifer  in
the down-valley direction?

2. What is the travel time (T) of the groundwater
between wells 1 and 2? This question is particu-
larly interesting from an environmental stand-
point  if  a  water  pollution  event  is  detected  at
well 1 and we want to know when the pollution
will reach well 2.
Answering  these  two  questions  requires  us  to
apply Darcy’s law to the situation outlined above. To
answer the ﬁrst question, which asks how much water
Q = KIA
is moving through the aquifer, recall that 
.
We will solve for Q. The hydraulic gradient is the ratio
of  the  difference  in  elevation  of  the  water  (pressure
head)  between  the  two  wells  to  the  length  of  the
groundwater ﬂow between the wells. The difference in
elevation of the water in wells 1 and 2 is 1 m and the
ﬂow length is 1,000 m. Thus, the hydraulic gradient
). The hydraulic conductivity is
(I) is 0.001 (
1.2 * 10-3 m/sec 
. The cross-sectional area
given as 
*
of the aquifer (A) is 25 m 4,000 m, or 100,000 m2
105 m2).  Multiplying  these  numbers,  we  ﬁnd
(1
that Q is equal to 0.12 m3/sec. This is equivalent to
10,368  m3/day,  which  is  approximately  2.7  million
gallons per day. Of course, all of this water could not

1 * 10 -3

*

be pumped from the aquifer. Pump tests of the wells
would  be  necessary  to  determine  how  much  of  the 
2.7 million gallons per day could be pumped without
depleting the resource.

Turning  now  to  the  second  question,  which
concerns the travel time of the water from one well
to the other, we again apply Darcy’s law. In this case
we calculate the Darcy ﬂux (v), which is

n = Q/A = KI

Remember that the Darcy ﬂux is only an apparent veloci-
ty and does not reﬂect the fact that the actual movement
of  the  groundwater  is  through  the  pore  spaces  between
the grains of sand and gravel in the aquifer. The actual ve-
locity (vx) is the ratio of the product of KI to the porosity.

 nx = KI/n

  = (1.2 * 10 -3 m/sec)(1 * 10 -3)/0.3
  = 4.0 * 10 -6 m/sec

Travel time (T) then is the ratio of the length of ﬂow (L) to
the velocity of the water moving through the pore spaces
(vx).  This  follows  from  the  fact  that  distance  L is  the
product  of  velocity  vx and  time  T,  (
).  Thus,
10-6
T = 1,000
108 sec. This
is approximately 7.9 years.

Comments
Finer-grained granites with few fractures are the

strongest. Granite is generally suitable for most
engineering purposes.

Brecciated zones, open tubes, or fractures reduce

the strength.

Solutional openings and fractures weaken the

rock.

Generally suitable for most engineering

purposes.

Very strong rock.
May be a very weak rock for engineering

purposes; careful evaluation is necessary.

May have clay partings, solution openings, or

fractures that weaken the rock.

Strength varies with degree and type of

cementing material, mineralogy, and nature
and extent of fractures.
