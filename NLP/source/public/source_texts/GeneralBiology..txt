2 Biology - The Life Science

The word biology means, "the science of life", from the Greek bios, life, and logos, word
or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is
sometimes known as Life Science.
The science has been divided into many subdisciplines, such as botany1, bacteriology,
anatomy2, zoology, histology, mycology, embryology, parasitology, genetics3, molecular biol-
ogy4, systematics, immunology, microbiology5, physiology, cell biology6, cytology, ecology7,
and virology. Other branches of science include or are comprised in part of biology studies,
including paleontology8, taxonomy, evolution, phycology, helimentology, protozoology, en-
tomology, biochemistry, biophysics, biomathematics, bio engineering, bio climatology and
anthropology.

2.1 Characteristics of life

Not all scientists agree on the deﬁnition of just what makes up life. Various characteristics
describe most living things. However, with most of the characteristics listed below we can
think of one or more examples that would seem to break the rule, with something nonliving
being classiﬁed as living or something living classiﬁed as nonliving. Therefore we are careful
not to be too dogmatic in our attempt to explain which things are living or nonliving.
• Living things are composed of matter structured in an orderly way where simple

molecules are ordered together into much larger macromolecules.

An easy way to remember this is GRIMNERD C All organisms; - Grow, Respire, Interact,
Move, Need Nutrients, Excrete (Waste), Reproduce,Death, Cells (Made of)
• Living things are sensitive, meaning they are able to respond to stimuli.
• Living things are able to grow, develop, and reproduce.
• Living things are able to adapt over time by the process of natural selection.
• All known living things use the hereditary molecule, DNA9.

Biology - The Life Science

• Internal functions are coordinated and regulated so that the internal environment of a

living thing is relatively constant, referred to as homeostasis10.

Living things are organized in the microscopic level from atoms up to cells11. Atoms are
arranged into molecules, then into macromolecules12, which make up organelles13, which
work together to form cells. Beyond this, cells are organized in higher levels to form entire
multicellular organisms. Cells together form tissues14, which make up organs, which are
part of organ systems, which work together to form an entire organism. Of course, beyond
this, organisms form populations which make up parts of an ecosystem. All of the Earths
ecosystems together form the diverse environment that is the earth.
Example:-
sub atoms, atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms, population,
community, eco systems

2.2 Nature of science

Science is a methodology for learning about the world. It involves the application
of knowledge.
The scientiﬁc method deals with systematic investigation, reproducible results, the
formation and testing of hypotheses, and reasoning.
Reasoning can be broken down into two categories, induction (speciﬁc data is used to
develop a generalized observation or conclusion) and deduction (general information leads
to speciﬁc conclusion). Most reasoning in science is done through induction.
Science as we now know it arose as a discipline in the 17th century.

2.3 Scientiﬁc method

The scientiﬁc method is not a step by step, linear process. It is an intuitive process, a
methodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge. Scientists
must be able to have an "imaginative preconception" of what the truth is. Scientists will
often observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred. They use all
of their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that
might be true. A typical scientiﬁc investigation might go like so:
You observe that a room appears dark, and you ponder why the room is dark. In an attempt
to ﬁnd explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several diﬀerent hypotheses. One
hypothesis might state that the lights are turned oﬀ. Another hunch might be that the
rooms lightbulb has burnt out. Worst yet, you could be going blind. To discover the truth,

Scientiﬁc method

you experiment. You feel your way around the room and ﬁnd a light switch and turn it on.
No light. You repeat the experiment, ﬂicking the switch back and forth. Still nothing. That
means your initial hypothesis, the room is dark because the lights are oﬀ, has been rejected.
You devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a ﬂashlight to prove that
you are indeed not blind. In order to accept your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,
you could predict that changing the light bulb will ﬁx the problem. If all your predictions
succeed, the original hypothesis is valid and is accepted. In some cases, however, your
predictions will not occur, in which youll have to start over. Perhaps the power is oﬀ.

Figure 1 How Science is Done
A diagram that illustrates scientiﬁc investigation

Scientists ﬁrst make observations that raise a particular question. In order to explain the
observed phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses. This
is the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why

Biology - The Life Science

an event occurred. Experiments are then used to eliminate one of more of the possible
hypotheses until one hypothesis remains. Using deduction, scientists use the principles of
their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are
conﬁrmed. After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been conﬁrmed, the
hypothesis then may become a theory.
Quick Deﬁnitions
Observation - Quantitative and qualitative measurements of the world.
Inference - Deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
Hypotheses - A suggested explanation.
Rejected Hypothesis - An explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.
Accepted Hypothesis - An explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive
experimentation and makes veriﬁable predictions that are true.
Experiment - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already
known.
Scientiﬁc Method - The process of scientiﬁc investigation.
Theory - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time. Often tested, and
usually never rejected.
The scientiﬁc method is based primarily on the testing of hypotheses by experimentation.
This involves a control, or subject that does not undergo the process in question. A scientist
will also seek to limit variables to one or another very small number, single or minimum
number of variables. The procedure is to form a hypothesis or prediction about what you
believe or expect to see and then do everything you can to violate that, or falsify the
hypotheses. Although this may seem unintuitive, the process serves to establish more ﬁrmly
what is and what is not true.
A founding principle in science is a lack of absolute truth: the accepted explanation is the
most likely and is the basis for further hypotheses as well as for falsiﬁcation. All knowledge
has its relative uncertainty.
Theories are hypotheses which have withstood repeated attempts at falsiﬁcation. Common
theories include evolution by natural selection and the idea that all organisms consist of
cells. The scientiﬁc community asserts that much more evidence supports these two ideas
than contradicts them.

2.4 Charles Darwin

Charles Darwin

Figure 2

Charles Darwin is most remembered today for his contribution of the theory of evolution
through natural selection.
The seeds of this theory were planted in Darwins mind through observations made on a
ﬁve-year voyage through the New World on a ship called the Beagle. There, he studied
fossils and the geological record, geographic distribution of organisms, the uniqueness and
relatedness of island life forms, and the aﬃnity of island forms to mainland forms.
Upon his return to England, Darwin pondered over his observations and concluded that
evolution must occur through natural selection. He declined, however, to publish his work
because of its controversial nature. However, when another scientist, Wallace, reached similar
conclusions, Darwin was convinced to publish his observations in 1859. His hypothesis
revolutionized biology and has yet to be falsiﬁed by empirical data collected by mainstream
scientists.

2.5 After Darwin

Since Darwins day, scientists have amassed a more complete fossil record, including
microorganisms and chemical fossils. These fossils have supported and added subtleties
to Darwins theories. However, the age of the Earth is now held to be much older than
Darwin thought. Researchers have also uncovered some of the preliminary mysteries of
the mechanism of heredity as carried out through genetics and DNA, areas unknown to
Darwin. Another growing area is comparative anatomy including homology and analogy.
Today we can see a bit of evolutionary history in the development of embryos, as certain
(although not all) aspects of development recapitulate evolutionary history.

9

Biology - The Life Science

The molecular biology15 study of slowly mutating genes reveal considerable evolutionary
history consistent with fossil and anatomical record.

2.6 Challenges to Darwin

Figure 3

Darwin and his theories have been challenged many times in the last 150 years. The
challenges have been primarily religious based on a perceived conﬂict with the preconceived
notion of creationism. Many of those who challenge Darwin have been adherents to the
young earth hypothesis that says that the Earth is only some 6000 years old and that all
species were individually created by a god. Some of the proponents of these theories have
suggested that chemical and physical laws that exist today were diﬀerent or nonexistent in
earlier ages. However, for the most part, these theories are either not scientiﬁcally testable
and fall outside the area of attention of the ﬁeld of biology, or have been disproved by one
or more ﬁelds of science.

• Consequences:
• Membranes
• Protein structure

• Hydrophilic: polar substances associate with water
Ionization of water: H2O -> H+ + OH-
• Forms a Hydrogen ion (H+), hydroxide ion (OH-)
• Due to spontaneous breakage of covalent bond
• At 25°C, 1 liter of water contains 10-7 moles of H+ ions: 10-7 moles/liter
pH
• A convenient way of indicating H+ concentration
• pH13 = -log[H+]
• For water, pH = -log[10-7] = 7
• Since for each H+ in pure water, there is one OH-, pH of 7 indicates neutrality
• Logarithmic scale
Buﬀer
• Reservoir for H+
• Maintains relatively constant pH over buﬀering range

The Chemical Building Blocks of Life

4.6 Hereditary (Genetic) information

• Nucleic acids

• DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid

• Hereditary information of all cells
• Hereditary information for many viruses

• RNA: ribonucleic acid

• Hereditary information of certain viruses (HIV5)
• Intermediate in gene expression
• Composed of nucleotides

• Ribonucleotides
• Deoxyribonucleotides

4.6.1 RNA DNA origin

• Which came ﬁrst?
• Paradox: DNA encodes protein necessary for its own replication
• Discovery of catalytic RNA by Cech and Altman suggested that RNA might have been

ﬁrst self-replicating molecule

• DNA evolved as more stable type of storage molecule

Cleveland State University.
Proteins: Their building block is amino acids. The bond connecting 2 of the amino acids
together are called peptide bonds. One of these bonds makes a monopeptide, two a dipeptide,
and any more than that makes a polypeptide.

5 Life: History and Origin

5.1 Properties of life

1. Organization: Being structurally composed of one or more cells, which are the basic

units of life.
• prokaryote: no nucleus
• eukaryote: membrane bound nucleus.

2. Sensitivity: respond to stimuli.

3. Energy Processing

4. Growth and Development

5. Reproduction

• hereditary mechanisms to make more of self; DNA based.

6. Regulation, including homeostasis.

7. Evolution.

5.2 Origin of life: 3 hypotheses

• Extraterrestrial origin (panspermia): meteor, comet borne from elsewhere in universe

• evidence of amino acids and other organic material in space (but often both D & L

forms)

• questionable bacterial fossils in Martian rock

-However, this would imply that some other origin of life was likely because it would have
had to happen elsewhere before it could be transported here, and the only diﬀerence would
be that life did not originate on Earth.
• Spontaneous origin on earth: primitive self-replicating macromolecules acted upon by

natural selection ((macro)Evolution is one example of this)

-This is often attacked for the seeming impossibility for life to have been produced by a
chemical reaction triggered by lightning and the ability of any produced DNA to actually be
in a sequence that could produce a working model of life if replicated. It is also attacked
for religious reasons, as it bypasses things like the idea of a supreme being directly creating
humans. It also seems unlikely to some that such huge changes are possible in evolution

19

Life: History and Origin

without evidence of an "in-between stage" that is credible. Many of the stages of man are
disputed due to their somewhat shakey grounds. For example, bones from other animals
have been taken accidentally in some cases to be part of a humanoid, and complete skeletons
have been sketched out from a limited number of bones.
• Special creation: religious explanations (Intelligent Design is one popular example of
this.) These explanations contend that life was created by God (or perhaps some other
Intelligent Designer).
• Proponents of Intelligent design suggest that the vast complexity of life could only

have been intentionally designed while other creationists cite biblical support.

-This is often attacked for many of the same reasons that religion is attacked, and is often
regarded as superstitious and/or unscientiﬁc.
• It is debated as to whether schools should teach one hypothesis or the other when talking
about the origin of life. However, since they are all currently known major hypotheses
(and sometimes hypotheses proven wrong are shown for educational purposes), this
wikibook includes what it can without discriminating unfairly against one hypothesis or
the other.

5.3 The early earth

It is believed that the Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
• Heavy bombardment by rubble ceased about 3.8 billion years ago.
• Reducing atmosphere: much free H

• also H2O, NH3, CH4
• little, if any, free O2
• with numerous H electrons, require little energy to form organic compounds with C

• Warm oceans, estimated at 49-88°C
• Lack of O2 and consequent ozone (O3) meant considerable UV energy
Chemical reactions on early earth
• UV and other energy sources would promote chemical reactions and formation of organic

molecules

• Testable hypothesis: Miller-Urey experiment

• simulated early atmospheric conditions
• found amino acids, sugars, etc., building blocks of life
• won Nobel prize for work
• experiment showed prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules was possible

Issues
• Miller later conceded that the conditions in his experiments were not representative of

what is currently thought to be those of early earth

• He also conceded that science has no answer for how amino acids could self-organize into

replicating molecules and cells

• In the 50 years since Miller-Urey, signiﬁcant issues and problems for biogenesis have been

identiﬁed. This is a weak hypothesis at this time.

20

• Conclusion: Life exists, we dont know why.

5.4 Origin of cells

Origin of cells

Cells are very small and decompose quickly after death. As such, fossils of the earliest cells
do not exist. Scientists have had to form a variety of theories on how cells (and hence life)
was created on Earth.
• Bubble hypothesis

• A. Oparin, J.B.S. Haldane, 1930’s

• Primary abiogenesis: life as consequence of geochemical processes
• Protobionts: isolated collections of organic material enclosed in hydrophobic bubbles

• Numerous variants: microspheres, protocells, protobionts, micelles, liposomes, coacer-

vates

• Other surfaces for evolution of life

• deep sea thermal vents
• ice crystals
• clay surfaces
• tidal pools

5.5 The RNA world?

• DNA → RNA → polypeptide (protein)
• Catalytic RNA: ribozyme

• discovered independently by Tom Cech and Sid Altman (Nobel prize)
• catalytic properties: hydrolysis, polymerization, peptide bond formation, etc.

• Self-replicating RNA molecule may have given rise to life

• consistent with numerous roles for RNA in cells as well as roles for ribonucleotides

(ATP)

• relationship to bubble-like structures is uncertain

5.6 The earliest cells

• Microfossils
• ˜3.5 by
• resemble bacteria: prokaryotes
• biochemical residues
• stromatolites

• Archaebacteria (more properly Archaea)

• extremophiles: salt, acid, alkali, heat, methanogens
• may not represent most ancient life

• Eubacteria

• cyanobacteria: photosynthesis

• atmospheric O2; limestone deposits

7 Cell structure

7.1 What is a cell?

The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", meaning "small room", and it was ﬁrst
coined by a microscopist observing the structure of cork. The cell is the basic unit of all
living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells. Cells are so basic and
critical to the study of life, in fact, that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of
life". Organisms - bacteria, amoebae and yeasts, for example - may consist of as few as one
cell, while a typical human body contains about a trillion cells.
According to Cell Theory, ﬁrst proposed by Schleiden and Schwann in 1839, all life consists
of cells. The theory also states that all cells come from previously living cells, all vital
functions (chemical reactions) of organisms are carried out inside of cells, and that cells
contain necessary hereditary information to carry out necessary functions and replicate
themselves.
All cells contain:
• Lipid bilayer boundary (plasma membrane1)
• Cytoplasm2
• DNA3 (hereditary information)
• Ribosomes4 for protein synthesis
Eukaryotic cells also contain:
• At least one nucleus5
• Mitochondria6 for cell respiration and energy
Cells may also contain:
• Lysosomes7
• Peroxisomes8
• Vacuoles9
• Cell walls10

Cell structure

7.1.1 Concepts

Plasma Membrane
Phospholipid bilayer, which contains great amount of proteins, the most important functions
are the following:

1. It selectively isolates the content of the cell of the external atmosphere.
2. It regulates the interchange of substances between the cytoplasm and the environment.
3. Communicates with other cells.

Model of the ﬂuid mosaic
Describes the structure of the plasma membrane, this model was developed in 1972 by
cellular biologists J. Singer and L. Nicholson.
Phospholipid bilayer
Is in the plasma membrane and produces the ﬂuid part of membranes.
Proteins
Long chains of amino acids.
Glucose proteins
Proteins together with carbohydrates in the plasma membrane, mostly in the outer parts
of the cell.
Functions of proteins
Transport oxygen, they are components of hair and nails, and allow the cell interact with
its environment.
Transport Proteins
Regulate the movement of soluble water molecules, through the plasma membrane. Some
transport proteins called channel proteins form pores or channels in the membrane so
that water soluble molecules pass.
Carrying proteins
Have union sites that can hold speciﬁc molecules.
Reception proteins
They activate cellular responses when speciﬁc molecules join.
Proteins of recognition
They work as identiﬁers and as place of union to the cellular surface.
Fluid
It is any substance that can move or change of form.
Concentration
Number of molecules in a determined unit of volume.

26

What is a cell?

Gradient
Physical diﬀerence between two regions of space, in such a way that the molecules tend to
move in response to the gradients.
Diﬀusion
Movement of the molecules in a ﬂuid, from the regions of high concentration to those of
low concentration.
Passive transport
Movement of substances in a membrane that doesn’t need to use energy.
Simple diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of water, gases or molecules across the membrane.
Facilitated diﬀusion
Diﬀusion of molecules across the membranes with the participation of proteins.
Osmosis
Diﬀusion of the water across a membrane with diﬀerential permeability.
Transport that needs energy
Movement of substances across a membrane generally in opposition to a gradient of
concentration with the requirement of energy.
Active transport
Movement of small molecules using energy (ATP).
Endocytosis
Movement of big particles towards the interior of the cell using energy. The cells enclose
particles or liquids.
Pinocytosis
(Literally cell drinking) Form in which the cell introduces liquids.
Phagocytosis
Way of eating of the cells. It feeds in this case of big particles or entire microorganisms.
Pseudopods
False feet (the amoeba).
Exocitosis
Movement of materials out of the cell with the use of energy. It throws waste material.
Isotonic
The cytoplasm ﬂuid of the interior of the cells is the same that the outer.
Hypertonic solution

27

Cell structure

The solutions that have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than the cellular
cytoplasm and that therefore water of the cells goes out with osmosis.
Hypotonic
The solutions with a concentration of dissolved particles lower than the cytoplasm of a cell
and that therefore do that water enters the cell with osmosis.
Swelling
Pressure of the water inside the vacuole.
Endoplasmic Reticulum
It is the place of the synthesis of the cellular membrane.

7.1.2 Structure and function of the cell

Rudolf Virchow
Zoologist, who proposed the postulates of the cellular theory, observes that the living cells
could grow and be in two places at the same time, he proposed that all the cells come from
other equal cells and proposed 3 postulates:

1. Every living organism is formed from one or more cells
2. The smallest organisms are unicellular and these in turn are the functional units of

the multicellular organisms.

3. All the cells come from preexisting cells.

7.1.3 Common characteristics of all the cells

Molecular components
Proteins, amino acids, lipids, sweeten, DNA, RNA.
Structural components
Plasmatic membrane, citoplasm, ribosomes.
Robert Hooke
He postuled for the ﬁrst time the term cell
Prokaryotes
Their genetic material is not enclosed in a membrane ex. Bacterias
Eukaryotes
Their genetic material is contained inside a nucleus closed by a membrane

7.2 History of cell knowledge

History of cell knowledge

The optical microscope was ﬁrst invented in 17th century. Shortly thereafter scientists began
to examine living and dead biological tissues in order to better understand the science of
life. Some of the most relevant discovery milestones of the time period include:
• The invention of the microscope11, which allowed scientists for the ﬁrst time to see

• Robert Hooke12 in 1665 looked at cork under a microscope and described what he called

biological cells

cork "cells"

microscope "animalcules"

cells

• Anton van Leeuwenhoek13 called the single-celled organisms that he saw under the

• Matthias Jakob Schleiden14, a botanist, in 1838 determined that all plants consist of

• Theodor Schwann15, a zoologist, in 1839 determined that all animals consist of cells
• Rudolf Virchow16 proposed the theory that all cells arise from previously existing cells
In 1838, the botanist Matthias Jakob Schleiden and the physiologist Theodor Schwann
discovered that both plant cells and animal cells had nuclei. Based on their observations,
the two scientists conceived of the hypothesis that all living things were composed of cells.
In 1839, Schwann published Microscopic Investigations on the Accordance in the Structure
and Growth of Plants and Animals, which contained the ﬁrst statement of their joint cell
theory.

7.2.1 Cell Theory

Schleiden and Schwann proposed spontaneous generation as the method for cell origination,
but spontaneous generation (also called abiogenesis17) was later disproven. Rudolf Virchow
famously stated "Omnis cellula e cellula"... "All cells only arise from pre-existing cells." The
parts of the theory that did not have to do with the origin of cells, however, held up to
scientiﬁc scrutiny and are widely agreed upon by the scientiﬁc community today.
The generally accepted portions of the modern Cell Theory are as follows: (1) The cell is the
fundamental unit of structure and function in living things. (2) All organisms are made up
of one or more cells. (3) Cells arise from other cells through cellular division. (4) Cells carry
genetic material passed to daughter cells during cellular division. (5) All cells are essentially
the same in chemical composition. (6) Energy ﬂow (metabolism and biochemistry) occurs
within cells.

7.3 Microscopes

• Allow greater resolution, can see ﬁner detail
• Eye: resolution of ˜ 100 μm
• Light microscope18: resolution of ˜ 200 nm
• Limited to cells are larger organelles within cells
• Confocal microscopy19: 2 dimension view
• Electron microscope20: resolution of ˜0.2 nm
• Laser tweezers: move cell contents

7.4 Cell size

One may wonder why all cells are so small. If being able to store nutrients is beneﬁcial
to the cell, how come there are no animals existing in nature with huge cells? Physical
limitations prevent this from occurring. A cell must be able to diﬀuse gases and nutrients in
and out of the cell. A cells surface area does not increase as quickly as its volume, and as a
result a large cell may require more input of a substance or output of a substance than it
is reasonably able to perform. Worse, the distance between two points within the cell can
be large enough that regions of the cell would have trouble communicating, and it takes a
relatively long time for substances to travel across the cell.
That is not to say large cells dont exist. They are, once again, less eﬃcient at exchanging
materials within themselves and with their environment, but they are still functional. These
cells typically have more than one copy of their genetic information, so they can manufacture
proteins locally within diﬀerent parts of the cell.
Key concepts: Cell size:
• Is limited by need for regions of cell to communicate
• Diﬀuse oxygen and other gases
• Transport of mRNA21 and protein22s

• Have extra copies of genetic information
• Have slower communication between parts of cell

• Surface area to volume ratio limited

• Larger cells typically:

8 Structure of Eukaryotic cells

Eukaryotic1 cells feature membrane delimited nucleii containing two or more linear chromo-
some2s; numerous membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles: mitochondria, RER3, SER4,
lysosomes, vacuole5s, chloroplast6s; ribosomes and a cytoskeleton7. Also, plants, fungi, and
some protists have a cell wall.

8.1 Structure of the nucleus

The nucleus is the round object in the cell that holds the genetic information (DNA) of the
cell. It is surrounded by a nuclear envelope and has a nucleolus inside.

8.1.1 Nuclear envelope

The nuclear envelope is a double-layered plasma membrane8 like the cell membrane, although
without membrane proteins. To allow some chemicals to enter the nucleus, the nuclear
envelope has structures called Nuclear pore9s. The nuclear envelope is continuous with the
endoplasmic reticulum.

8.1.2 Nucleolus

The nucleolus appears in a microscope as a small dark area within the nucleus. The nucleolus
is the area where there is a high amount of DNA transcription10 taking place.

8.2 Chromatin

Chromosomes consist of chromatin11. This is made up of strings of DNA, which typically
measure centimeters in length if stretched out. This DNA is wound around a histone12 core
and organized into nucleosome13s.
The chromatin14 must be uncoiled for gene expression15 and replication16. Chromosome
micrograph

8.3 Endoplasmic reticulum

The endoplasmic reticulum17 is a cellular organelle18 made up of a series of extended folded
intracellular membranes. It is continuous with the nuclear membane.
There are two main types of endoplasmic reticulum:
• RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (site of protein synthesis19) associated with ribosomes
• SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum (site of lipid synthesis20)

8.3.1 Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum

Proteins are directed to the RER by a signal sequence of a growing polypeptide21s on
the ribosome. This is recognised by a signal recognition particle which brings the ribo-
some/polypeptide complex to a channel on the RER called a translocon. At the translocon,
the signal sequence and ribosome/polypeptide complex interact with the translocon to open
it. The signal sequence becomes attached to the translocon. The ribosome can continue to
translate the polypeptide into the lumen of the RER. As synthesis continues, 2 processes
can happen.

1. If the protein is destined to become a membrane bound protein then the protein
synthesis will continue until termination. The ribosome can then dissociate, allowing
protein folding within the RER lumen to occur and continuation to the golgi apparatus
for processing of the polypeptide.

2. If the protein is destined for storage for later secretion after stimulation or for continuous
secretion then a protease-enzyme which cuts proteins at the peptide bond-can cut the
signal sequence from the growing polypeptide. Continuation to the golgi etc. can then
occur.

Endoplasmic reticulum

When produced, proteins are then exported to one of several locations. The proteins are
either modiﬁed for extracellular membrane insertion or secretion. Note, this is in contrast
with ribosomes which do not associate with the RER and produce proteins which will become
cytosolic enzymes for example.

8.3.2 Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum

Smooth endoplasmic reticulum produces enzyme22s for lipid and carbohydrate biosynthesis
and detoxiﬁcation RER

8.3.3 Sarcoplasmic Reticulum

This is a specialised form of endoplasmic reticulum found in some muscle cell types-
particularly striated, skeletal muscle. Its main function is diﬀerent from the other 2 types in
that is mainly acts as a storage of calcium. This reticulum has voltage gated channels which
respond to signals from motor neurones to open and release calcium into the cytoplasm.
This can then bring about the next part in muscle contraction.

8.4 The Golgi apparatus

The golgi apparatus24 is made up of multiple stacks of bilipid membranes.
• Proteins made on the RER are modiﬁed and then sorted
• Formation of secretory vesicles
• Formation of lysosomes (intracellular digestion)
Other membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles include:
• Microbodies25 (generic term)
• Glyoxysome (transforms fat into carbohydrate in plants)
• Peroxisome26 (uses oxidative metabolism to form hydrogen peroxide and is destroyed by

catalase27)

8.5 Ribosomes

Ribosomes are the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes themselves are synthesized in the
cell nucleoli28 and are structured as two subunits, the large and the small. These parts are
composed of RNA and protein.
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes are diﬀerent, the eukaryotic ones being larger and
more complicated.

• Microtubule organizing centers

• Animal cells and many protists
• Pair constitutes the centrosome
• Give rise to ﬂagellum during spermatogenesis

• Consist of 9 triplet microtubules
• Mitosis31, meiosis32

8.7 Cytoskeleton

Cytoskeleton is a collective term for diﬀerent ﬁlaments of proteins that can give physical
shape within the cell and are responsible for the roads which organelles can be carried
along.
• Gives the cell shape
• Anchors other organelles
• Vital to intracellular transport of large molecules
The cytoskeleton is composed of 3 main types of ﬁlaments:
• Actin33 ﬁlaments (7 nm)
• Microtubule34s: (25 nm) polymer of tubulin; 13/ring.
• Intermediate Filament35s
Both actin and microtubules can have associated motor proteins.

8.7.1 Intermediate Filaments

These are rope like ﬁlaments, 8-10nm in diameter and tend to give the structural stability to
cells. Examples inculude Vimentin, neuroﬁlaments and keratin. It is keratin which priniciply
makes up hair, nails and horns.

8.7.2 Actin Filaments

Growth
These ﬁlaments are 2-stranded and composed of dimeric subunits called G-Actin. They
contain a GTP molecule in order to bind (polymerise). As GTP is hydrolysed then the
structure becomes unstable and depolymerisation occurs. The growth of actin ﬁlaments is
concentration dependant-that is, the higher the concentration of free G-actin, the greater
the polymerisation. The are also polar, having a + and a - end (not related to charge) and
polymerisation tends to happen faster at the + end.

9 Membranes

9.1 Biological membranes

Figure 5 Plasma membrane bilayer

37

Membranes

Biological membranes surround cells and serve to keep the insides separated from the outsides.
They are formed of phospholipid bilayer1s, which by deﬁnition are a double layer of fatty
acid2 molecules (mostly phospholipid3s, lipids containing lots of phosphorus).
Proteins4 serve very important functions in cellular membranes. They are active transports
in and out of the cell, acting as gatekeepers. They relay signals in and out of the cell.
Proteins are the site of many enzymatic reactions in the cell, and play a role in
regulation of cellular processes.

9.2 Phospholipid

Phospholipid bilayer
• basis of biological membranes and cellular organisms
• contains a charged, hydrophilic (attracted to water) head and two hydrophobic (repelled

by water) hydrocarbon tails

• In presence of water, phospholipids form bilayer

• maximize hydrogen bonds between water
• creates barrier to passage of materials
• ﬂuid mosaic model shows horizontal (common) and "ﬂip-ﬂop" (rare) movement of

phospholipids

9.3 Fluid mosaic model

• Current model of membrane
• Phospholipid bilayer

• Phospholipids

• Move freely in lipid layer, but rarely switch layers
• Diﬀerent phospholipids in each layer in diﬀerent organelles

11.4 Free energy

• Energy required to break and subsequently form other chemical bonds

• Chemical bonds: sharing of electrons, tend to hold atoms of molecule together
• Heat, by increasing atomic motion, makes it easier to break bonds (entropy)

• Energy available to do work in a system
• In cells, G = H - TS

• G = Gibbs’ free energy
• H = H (enthalpy) energy in molecule’s chemical bonds

• Chemical reactions break and make bonds, producing changes in energy
• Under constant conditions of temperature, pressure and volume, ∆G = ∆H - T∆S
• ∆G, change in free energy

• If positive (+), H is higher, S is lower, so there is more free energy; endergonic reaction,

does not proceed spontaneously; require input of energy (e.g., heat)

• If negative (–), H is lower, S is higher. Product has less free energy; exergonic;

spontaneous

and build sugar (glucose).

• Responsible for bulk of glucose production
• Early experiments showed that mass of plant must be derived from substances in the air,

• Experiments with isotopes showed that liberated oxygen comes from water
• Experiments also showed that light is essential but that some reactions (e.g., reduction of

• Plants do two big, important things during photosynthesis: gain energy (absorb light)

• Photosynthesis can be divided into two series of chemical reactions: the light (light-
dependent) reactions and the dark (light-independent) reactions. In light reactions, light
is absorbed; in dark reactions, sugar is built.

• Occurs when plants, algae, and autotrophic bacteria absorb light energy and build glucose.

13.1 Light Reactions

• Part of the electromagnetic spectrum
• Consists of units of energy called photons
• Photons at UV end of spectrum have more energy than those at the red end
• Occur on the surface of thylakoid disks
• Chlorophyll and other plant pigments diﬀerentially absorb photons

• Chlorophyll a: light to chemical energy
• Chlorophyll b: accessory chlorophyll
• Chlorophylls absorb primarily blue and red (green reﬂected back, hence the green

color of plants)

13.1.1 Accessory pigments

• Chlorophyll is a major light gathering pigment

• Absorbs light with considerable eﬃciency (i.e., retaining energy)

• Accessory pigments

• Chlorophyll b
• Carotenoinds

• capture light of wavelengths not captured by chlorophylls

51

Photosynthesis

• Confer other colors to plant leaves (autumn colors too)
Photosynthetic steps
• Primary photoevent: light photon captured by photosystem and energy transferred to

electron donated by water

• Electron transport: excited electron is shuttled along imbedded series of electron carriers

to proton pump and electron is transferred to acceptor

• Chemiosmosis: transport of protons back into chloroplast drives synthesis of ATP

13.1.2 The Even More Detailed Light Reactions

What the Light Reactions Do:
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur in chloroplasts in and on the thylakoid disks.
During the light reactions, light energy charges up ATP molecules. More speciﬁcally, light
turns the chloroplast into an acid battery, and this battery charges up ATP.
How the "Chloroplast-Battery" Charges ATP:
The stroma is the ﬂuid inside of the chloroplasts, and it carries a negative charge. This
means that it contains about a "gazillion" extra electrons. The solvent of stroma is water.
The ﬂuid inside the thylakoid disks is positively charged because it contains a lot of hydrogen
(H+) ions. The pH here is low, making the ﬂuid very acidic. The solvent of thylakoid disk
ﬂuid is water.
A chloroplast acts like a battery, because it has separated a strong positive charge and a
strong negative charge in two diﬀerent compartments. Energy is released when H+ ions
(free protons) ﬂow from the inside of a thylakoid disk to the stroma. This is electrical energy,
since it is a ﬂow of charged particles.
The protons pass through special channels (made of protein) in the thylakoid membrane;
this reaction is exothermic. The energy that is given oﬀ is used to fuel this reaction (Pi is
the phosphate ion):

ADP + Pi --> ATP

The proton can go to the negative stroma, but only if it uses its energy to charge up ATP.
Since one reaction wants to go, and the other one doesnt, and since the ﬁrst reaction releases
energy and the second one absorbs energy, the two reactions are known to be coupled
together so that the ﬁrst fuels the second. Of course, a special enzyme must be involved for
this to happen.
Chlorophyll Molecules on a Thylakoid Disk:
Hundreds of chlorophyll molecules cover the surface of a thylakoid disk, making the disk
green. The nonpolar "tails" of the chlorophyll molecule are embedded in the membrane of
the thylakoid.

52

“Dark” reactions

13.2 “Dark” reactions

• ATP drives endergonic reactions
• NADPH provides hydrogens for reduction of CO2 to carbohydrate (C-H bonds)
• Occur in the stroma
• First step in carbon ﬁxation

13.2.1 The Detailed Dark Reactions

What the Dark Reactions Do:
The dark reactions build sugar from carbon dioxide gas (CO2), water (H2O), and energy
from ATP molecules that were charged up during the light reactions. The dark reactions
occur in the stroma of a chloroplast. Dark reactions usually occur in the light, but they
dont have to. Theyll occur in the dark until the chloroplasts supply of ATP runs out
(usually about 30 seconds).
The Calvin Cycle:
The Calvin Cycle is the fancy name for the metabolic pathway that builds sugar. This
means that it involves a whole lot of chemical reactions, and it uses a lot of diﬀerent enzymes
to catalyze the reactions.
Carbon dioxide gas is stable, therefore the bonds that hold the carbon and oxygen atoms
are strong. Therefore it takes a lot of energy to break the bonds and separate the carbon
atoms from the oxygen atoms. The energy needed to do this comes from ATP molecules.
When inorganic carbon (like from CO2) is being added to an organic molecule (such as
sugar), this is called carbon ﬁxation.
It takes 2 complete turns of the Calvin Cycle to make a glucose molecule.

15 Genetics

63

16 Gregor Mendel and biological

inheritance

Charles Darwin1, for all he contributed to the science of biology, never knew about the
mechanism by which living things inherit traits from previous generations, or how new traits
arise.
As any schoolchild can tell you, this mechanism of interitance has since been found to be
DNA2, or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA allows for stable inheritance of traits: the code in
each strand of DNA is replicated precisely through the pairing of basic units along each
strand. The error rate in this replication is amazingly low; not even one base pair in a
million matches out of sequence.
However, when even one base pair is added to a new strain of DNA in an order diﬀerently
than in the parent chain, it can be the basis of a mutation. These changes in DNA sequences
are the microscopic origin of changes in traits of all studied living things. Even the smallest
diﬀerence in a strand of DNA can result in a change in traits that can cost the life of the
organism. Mutations can produce proteins with a new or altered function. In humans, the
example of Sickle cell anemia3 is commonly given as its origin is a diﬀerence of only one
base pair in a section of DNA that encodes red blood cells.
Individual sequences of DNA that encode for speciﬁc proteins are called genes and are the
units of heredity. Each one has a set nucleotide4, and together all of the genes (and some
sequence of DNA that apparently do not code for any biologically important functions)
together make up the entire chromosome5

16.1 Mendel

• Discovered principle of genetic segregation via numerous experiments utilizing pea plants
• Inferred the existence of genes through segregation of phenotypes
• Used quantitative methods: counted; ratios
• Work is model of scientiﬁc method
• In particular, observed the F2 progeny, which lead to the discovery of dominant and

recessive traits

• Published work in 1866, went unnoticed
• In 1900 his scientiﬁc paper was “rediscovered”

Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance

• Mendel is acknowledged as founder of Genetics
• still used alphabet letters to designate genes
• still refer to dominant and recessive genes
• still refer to segregation of alleles in meiosis
• principle of segregation applies to all sexually reproducing organisms; Mendel’s results

were immediately applied to humans in 1900

16.2 Mendel’s experiments

• 1856, began experiments with the garden pea, Pisum sativum
• 1865, presented results to the Bruno natural history society, which he helped found
• 1866, published his results in proceedings of the society
• Naegeli encouraged Mendel to reproduce results in another species, which failed because

the species did not undergo true fertilization

• discrete traits in Pisum sativum

• pure-breeding lines
• dominant/recessive alleles

• alleles are two alternate versions of a gene

• gametes contain hybridized chromosomes that are formed during meiosis
• homozygous has two of the same allele
• heterozygous has two diﬀerent alleles

• reciprocal F1 crosses (all exhibiting dominant phenotypes); F2; F3
• counted oﬀspring, noted ratios
• inferred genotypes from phenotypes
• tested hypotheses with testcrosses
• attempted to repeat with another species

16.3 Mendel’s seven pairs of traits

1. Seed form (round or wrinkled)
2. Cotyledon color (green or yellow)
3. Seed coat color (white or colored)
4. Pod form (inﬂated or constricted)
5. Pod color (green or yellow)
6. Flower position (axial or terminal)
7. Plant heights (tall or short)

16.4 Locus

• The location of a speciﬁc gene within a chromosome

66

Modern Y chromosome

16.5 Modern Y chromosome

Y-chromosome is the most evolved chromosome. Generally it is thought that if Y- chro-
mosome is present in an individual then he will be male. But if mutation occurs at sex
determining region or zinc factor then it will not code for testis determining factor, and
results in normal female. This type of females frequency is 1/250000.

16.6 Chromosome phenomena

• X-chromosome inactivation

• Nondisjunction: failure of chromosome segregation at meiosis or mitosis

• Barr bodies
• Results in 2N ± 1 chromosome number

• Trisomy 2N + 1

• Usually lethal. Trisomy 21 (Down) exception

• Monosomy 2N ** 1
• Lethal except XO
• Usually maternal origin in humans

16.7 X-chromosome inactivation

In females, one X-chromosone is randomly switched oﬀ forming a Barr body.

16.8 Barr body

Dense region in the nucleus formed by the inactive X-chromosome.

16.9 Human genetic disorders

Downs Syndrome(Mongolism)
Downs Syndrome is usually produced by the nondisjunction of chromosome 21 during
oogenesis and sometimes during spermatogenesis. The individual suﬀering from this type of
syndrome has 47 chromosomes instead of the normal 46. The extra chromosome is not a sex
chromosome but an autosome.
Most cases of mongolism were found to occur in children born by women in their forties.
The aﬀected children, called mongoloids, show mental retardation and have a shorter life
expectancy. Their most prominent feature is the Mongolian folds in their eyes; hence, the
term mongolism.
Klinefelters Syndrome

67

Gregor Mendel and biological inheritance

When an XY-bearing sperm unites with an X-bearing egg, the resulting condition is called
Klinefelters Syndrome, or sexually undeveloped male. Individuals having the syndrome
show the following characteristics:
• testes are small
• sperms are never produced
• breasts are enlarged
• body hair is sparse
• individuals are mentally defective
The same abnormal meiotic division may occur in females. They produce eggs with XX or
no sex chromosomes. Such egg, when fertilized by a Y-bearing sperm, will not develop (YO).
This is because YO is lethal--it wil cause death to the oﬀspring.

17 DNA: The Genetic Material

17.1 DNA

DNA stands for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid. That is, a nucleic acid with two sugars. DNA is
the hereditary material of cells and is considered the blueprint of life. DNA is found in all
kingdoms of life. Even most viruses have DNA. A molecule of DNA is chemically stable (it
does not have a 2-prime alcohol group.)
When someone says DNA, they may be referring to ones genetic material on multiple levels:
They may be speaking about a single deoxyribose nucleic acid molecule, a section of a double
helix, a section of a chromosome, or ones entire hereditary composition.
• antiparallel
• Double helix

• Semiconservative replication
• Sequence of nucleotides encodes functional RNA or polypeptide

17.2 Historical perspective

• Mitosis and meiosis

• Regular distribution of chromosomes suggested that they contain hereditary informa-

• Bridges/Morgan, using Drosophila melanogaster showed that genes are on chromosomes

tion

(1910s)

• Hammerling: nucleus contains hereditary information (1930s)
• Griﬃth: transformation of bacteria (1928)
• Avery, MacLeod, McCarty: transforming substance is DNA (1944)
• Hershey, Chase: DNA is hereditary material of viruses (1952)
• Rosalind Franklin
• Watson and Crick: structure of DNA (1953)

17.3 Hershey-Chase Experiment

The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a
genetic material. Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA
into a bacterium. They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with
a radioactive phophorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur. With the
bacteria that was infected by the phages with radioactive DNA the DNA in the bacteria

69

DNA: The Genetic Material

was radioactive. In the bacteria that was infected with the radioactive protein the bacteria
was radioactive, not the DNA. This proves that DNA is a genetic material and it is passed
on in viruses.

17.4 DNA/RNA components

• Miescher: discovered DNA, 1869

17.4.1 Structure of DNA

DNA is in a double helix structure made up of nucleotides. The "backbone" of the double
helix is composed of phosphates connected to a ﬁve carbon sugar called deoxyribose, . The
"rungs" are composed of nitrogenous bases, Purines and Pyrimidines. Purines contain
Adenine(A) and Guanine(G) and have two rings in their structures. Pyrimidines contain
Cytosine(C) and Thymine (T) and have one ring in their structures.

20 Mutation

A mutation is a permanent change to an organisms genetic material (DNA1 or RNA).
Mutations are a rare but signiﬁcant biological process, since they provide the variation on
which evolution2 acts and are also the source of cancer.
An organisms genetic material is made up of polymers (chains) of four diﬀerent nucleotides3,
like a recipe book written in a language of only four letters. A mutation event is when the
order of the nucleotides in DNA change, usually when the DNA is being copied.
Mutations come in a number of forms:

20.1 Point Mutations

Point mutations are all mutations which involve a single nucleotide. These come in the form
of substitutions, insertions and deletions:

20.2 Substitution

Substitution Mutations: In substitution mutations, a nitrogenous base of a triplet codon of
DNA is replaced by another nitrogen base or some derivative of the nitrogen base, changing
the codon. The altered codon codes for a diﬀerent amino acid substitution.The substitution
mutations are of two types:
1.Transitions: It is the replacement of one purine in a polynucleotide chain by another
purine(A by G or C by A) or one pyrimidine by another pyrimidine(T by C or C by T)
2.Transversions:A base pair substitution involving the substitution of a purine by pyrimidine
or pyrimidine by a purine is called transversion.

20.4.2 Fusion

20.4.3 Fission

20.4.4 Segmental Duplication

20.4.6 Genome Duplication

20.5 Causes of mutations

20.6 Eﬀects of mutations

Mutations can have a variety of diﬀerent eﬀects depending on the type of mutation, the
signiﬁcance of the piece of genetic material aﬀected and whether the cells aﬀected are germ-

Further reading

line cells. Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations
elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Mutations can be classiﬁed by their eﬀects:

20.6.1 Silent Mutation

Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid
sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within
an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the ﬁnal
amino acid chain.

20.6.2 Frameshift

20.6.3 Missense Mutation

Missense mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to
cause substitution of a diﬀerent amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein
nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa.

22 Classiﬁcation of Living Things

22.0.1 Classiﬁcation of Living Things & Naming

With so many ﬂora and fauna on planet Earth, there must be a method to classify each
organism to distinguish it from others so it can be correctly identiﬁed. Classiﬁcation does
not only apply to biology. For example, supermarkets and grocery stores organise their
products by classifying them. Beverages may occupy one aisle, while cleaning supplies may
occupy another. In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called taxonomy (Taxis
means arrangement and nomos means law). The modern taxonomic system was developed
by the Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linneaeus (1707-1788). He used simple physical
characteristics of organisms to identify and diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent species.
Linneaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish diﬀerent levels of
similarity, each classifying group, called taxon (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups.
To remember the order, it is helpful to use a mnemonic device. The taxa in hierarchical
order:
• Domain - Archea, Eubacteria, Eukaryote
• Kingdom - Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, Eubacteria (Monera), Archaebacteria
• Phylum
• Class
• Order
• Family
• Genus
• Species
The domain is the broadest category, while species is the most speciﬁc category available.
The taxon Domain was only introduced in 1990 by Carl Woese, as scientists reorganise
things based on new discoveries and information. For example, the European Hare would
be classiﬁed as follows:
Eukaryote --> Animal --> Chordata --> Mammalia --> Lagomorpha --> Leporidae -->
Lepus --> Lepus europaeus.
Binomial nomenclature is used to name an organism, where the ﬁrst word beginning
with a capital is the genus of the organism and the second word beginning with lower-case
letter is the species of the organism. The name must be in italics and in Latin, which was
the major language of arts and sciences in the 18th century. The scientiﬁc name can be also
abbreviated, where the genus is shortened to only its ﬁrst letter followed by a period. In our
example, Lepus europaeus would become L. europaeus.
Taxonomy and binomial nomenclature are both speciﬁc methods of classifying an organism.
They help to eliminate problems, such as mistaken identity and false assumptions, caused
by common names. An example of the former is the fact that a North American robin is

93

Classiﬁcation of Living Things

quite diﬀerent from the English robin. An example of the latter is the comparison between
crayﬁsh and catﬁsh, where one might believe that they both are ﬁsh when in fact, they are
quite diﬀerent.
Nomenclature is concerned with the assignment of names to taxonomic groups in agreement
with published rules.

22.0.2 Eukaryotes & Prokaryotes

Recall that there are two basic types of cells: eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Eukaryotes are more complex in structure, with nuclei and membrane-bound organelles.
Some characteristics of eukaryotes are:
• Large (100 - 1000 μm)
• DNA in nucleus, bounded by membrane
• Genome consists of several chromosomes.
• Sexual reproduction common, by mitosis and meiosis
• Mitochondria and other organelles present
• Most forms are multicellular
• Aerobic
Prokaryotes refer to the smallest and simplest type of cells, without a true nucleus and no
membrane-bound organelles. Bacteria fall under this category. Some characteristics:
• Small (1-10 μm)
• DNA circular, unbounded
• Genome consists of single chromosome.
• Asexual reproduction common, not by mitosis or meiosis.
• No general organelles
• Most forms are singular
• Anaerobic

22.0.3 The Three Domains

The three domains are organised based on the diﬀerence between eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Todays living prokaryotes are extremely diverse and diﬀerent from eukaryotes. This fact has
been proven by molecular biological studies (e.g. of RNA structure) with modern technology.
The three domains are as follows:
Archea (Archeabacteria) consists of archeabacteria, bacteria which live in extreme
environments. The kingdom Archaea belongs to this domain.
Eubacteria consists of more typical bacteria found in everyday life. The kingdom Eubacteria
belongs to this domain.
Eukaryote encompasses most of the worlds visible living things. The kingdoms Protista,
Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia fall under this category.

94

Stem cells

22.0.4 The Six Kingdoms

Under the three domains are six kingdoms in taxonomy. The ﬁrst two, Plants and Animals,
are commonly understood and will not be expounded here.
Protista, the third kingdom, was introduced by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in
1866 to classify micro-organisms which are neither animals nor plants. Since protists are
quite irregular, this kingdom is the least understood and the genetic similarities between
organisms in this kingdom are largely unknown. For example, some protists can exhibit
properties of both animals and plants.
Fungi are organisms which obtain food by absorbing materials in their bodies. Mushrooms
and moulds belong in this kingdom. Originally, they were part of the plant kingdom but
were recategorised when they were discovered not to photosynthesise.
Eubacteria are bacteria, made up of small cells, which diﬀer in appearance from the
organisms in the above kingdoms. They lack a nucleus and cell organelles. They have cell
walls made of peptidoglycan.
Archae (or Archaebacteria) are bacteria which live in extreme environments, such as
salt lakes or hot, acidic springs. These bacteria are in their own category as detailed studies
have shown that they have unique properties and features (ex. unusual lipids that are not
found in any other organism)which diﬀer them from other bacteria and which allow them to
live where they live. Their cell walls lack peptidoglycan.

22.0.5 Origins of Diversity

The diversity in our planet is attributed to diversity within a species. As the world changed
in climate and in geography as time passed, the characteristics of species diverged so much
that new species were formed. This process, by which new species evolve, was ﬁrst described
by British naturalist Charles Darwin as natural selection.
For an organism to change, genetic mutations must occur. At times, genetic mutations are
accidental, as in the case of prokaryotes when they undergo asexual reproduction. For most
eukaryotes, genetic mutations occur through sexual reproduction, where meiosis produces
haploid gametes from the original parent cells. The fusion of these haploid gametes into
a diploid zygote results in genetic variation in each generation. Over time, with enough
arrangement of genes and traits, new species are produced. Sexual reproduction creates an
immense potential of genetic variety.
One goal of taxonomy is to determine the evolutionary history of organisms. This can be
achieved by comparing species living today with species in the past. The comparison in
anatomy and structure is based on data from development, physical anatomy, biochemistry,
DNA, behaviour, and ecological preferences. The following are examples of how such data is
used:
• Anatomy:
Although a horse and a human may look diﬀerent, there is evidence that their arm structures
are quite similar. Their arms sizes and proportions may be diﬀerent, but the anatomical
structures are quite similar. Such evidence reveals that animals in diﬀerent taxa may not

95

Classiﬁcation of Living Things

be that diﬀerent. Biological features from a common evolutionary origin are known as
homologous.
• Development
• Biochemistry:
Biochemical analysis of animals similar in appearance have yielded surprising results. For
example, although guinea pigs were once considered to be rodents, like mice, biochemistry
led them to be in their taxon of their own.

22.0.6 Phylogeny, Cladistics & Cladogram

Modern taxonomy is based on many hypotheses of the evolutionary history of organisms,
known as phylogeny. As with the Scientiﬁc Method, scientists develop a hypothesis on the
history of an animal and utilise modern science and technology to prove the phylogeny.
Cladistics is a classiﬁcation system which is based on phylogeny. Expanding on phylogeny,
cladistics is based on the assumption that each group of related species has one common
ancestor and would therefore retain some ancestral characteristics. Moreover, as these
related species evolve and diverge from their common ancestor, they would develop unique
characteristics. Such characteristics are known as derived characteristics
The principles of phylogeny and cladistics can be expressed visually as a cladogram,
a branching diagram which acts as a family (phylogenetic) tree for similar species. A
cladogram can also be used to test alternative hypotheses for an animals phylogeny. In
order to determine the most likely cladogram, the derived characteristics of similar species
are matched and analysed.

22.1 Introduction

Viruses are the smallest biological particle (the tiniest are only 20 nm in diameter). However,
they are not biological organisms so they are not classiﬁed in any kingdom of living things.
They do not have any organelles and cannot respire or perform metabolic functions. Viruses
are merely strands of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective protein coat called a capsid.
Viruses only come to life when they have invaded a cell. Outside of a host cell, viruses are
completely inert.
Since ﬁrst being identiﬁed in 1935, viruses have been classiﬁed into more than 160 major
groups. Viruses are classiﬁed based on their shape, replication properties, and the diseases
that they cause. Furthermore, the shape of a virus is determined by the type and arrangement
of proteins in its capsid. Viruses pathogenic to humans are currently classiﬁed into 21 groups.
Viruses can also attack bacteria and infect bacterial cells. Such viruses are called bacterio-
phages.

97

Classiﬁcation of Living Things

22.2 Viral Replication

As previously stated, viruses are not a biological life form so they cannot reproduce by
themselves. They need to take over a functioning eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell to replicate
its DNA or RNA and to make protein coat for new virus particles.
In order to enter a cell, a virus must attach to a speciﬁc receptor site on the plasma membrane
of the host cell. The proteins on the surface of the virus act as keys which ﬁt exactly into a
matching glycoprotein on the host cell membrane. In some viruses, the attachment protein
is not on the surface of the virus but is in the capsid or in the envelope.
There are two forms of viral replication: the lytic cycle and the lysogenic cycle.

22.2.1 Lytic Cycle

1. Attachment: The virus binds to speciﬁc receptors on the host cell.
2. Entry: There are two ways in which a virus can enter cells. Firstly, the virus can inject
its nucleic acid into the host cell. Secondly, if a virus is contained in an envelope, the
host cell can phagocytosise the entire virus particle into a vacuole. When the virus
breaks out of the vacuole, it then releases its nucleic acid into the cell.

3. Replication: The viruss nucleic acid instructs the host cell to replicate the viruss

DNA or RNA.

4. Assembly: New virus particles are assembled.
5. Lysis and Release: The virus directs the production of an enzyme which damages
the host cell wall, causing the host cell to swell and burst. The newly formed virus
particles are now released.

22.2.2 Lysogenic Cycle

1. Attachment: Similar to Lytic Cycle
2. Entry: Similar to Lytic Cycle
3. Incorporation: The viral nucleic acids is not replicated, but instead integrated by
genetic combination (crossing over) into the host cells chromosome. When integrated
in a host cell this way, the viral nucleic acid as part of the host cells chromosome is
known as a prophage.

4. Host Cell Reproduction: The host cell reproduces normally. Subsequent cell divisions,
daughter cells, contain original father cells chromosome embedded with a prophage.
5. Cycle Induction: Certain factors now determine whether the daughter cell undergoes
the lytic or lysogenic cycle. At any time, a cell undergoing the lysogenic cycle can
switch to the lytic cycle.

The reproduction cycle of viruses with RNA and no DNA is slightly diﬀerent. A notable
example of a RNA-based virus is HIV, a retrovirus.

98

Retrovirus reproductive cycle

Viral Genome

1. The retrovirus force RNA into cell, by either one of the two methods of entry (See

above).

2. In the retrovirus are reverse transcriptase enzymes, which catalyses the synthesis of a

DNA strand complementary to the viral RNA.

3. Reverse transcriptase catalyses a second DNA strand complementary to the ﬁrst. With

these two strands, the double-stranded DNA can be created.

4. DNA is then incorporated into the host cells chromosomes. Similar to the concept of
a prophage, this incorporated DNA is called a provirus. However, the provirus never
leaves the host cell, unlike a prophage.

5. The infected host cell undergoes the lytic or lysogenic cycle.

22.3 Viral Genome

The genome of a virus consists of DNA or RNA, whose size and conﬁguration vary. The
entire genome can exist as a single nucleic acid molecule or several nucleic acid segments.
Also, the DNA or RNA may be single-stranded or double-stranded, and either linear or
circular.
Not all viruses can reproduce in a host cell by themselves. Since viruses are so small, the
size of their genome is limiting. For example, some viruses have coded instructions for only
making a few diﬀerent proteins for the viruses capsid. On the other hand, the human
genome codes for over 30,000 diﬀerent proteins. Therefore, the lack of coded instructions
cause some viruses to need the presence of other viruses to help them reproduce themselves.
Such viruses are called replication defective.
Lastly, it is worthy to note that 70% of all viruses are RNA viruses. As the process of RNA
replication (with enzymes and other organelles of the host cell) is more prone to errors, RNA
viruses have much higher mutation rates than do DNA viruses.

22.4 Viruses Practice Questions

1. As the name implies, the Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus targets tomatoes. Would it be

possible for this virus to target other fruits as well? Explain.

2. If a DNA and a RNA virus both infected somatic cells, which virus would be more

diﬃcult to detect?

3. Many people have had cold sores, which are caused by infection with the herpes
simplex virus. One characteristic of cold sores is that after a period of inactivity, they
will reappear many times during the course of a persons life. Which cycle would the
herpes simplex virus undergo?

4. Chicken pox is a common, non-fatal disease usually acquired in adolescence and caused
by the varicella zoster virus. In adulthood, many people suﬀer from shingles, an altered
form of the varicella zoster virus. Which cycle would the varicella zoster virus have
undergone?

5. Would an antibiotic work for a person suﬀering from a cold of ﬂu? Explain.

Domains of life: characteristics

22.7 Domains of life: characteristics

This text is based on notes very generously donated by Paul Doerder, Ph.D., of the Cleveland
State University.

22.8 Introduction

Out of the six kingdoms, Protista is the most diverse. This is the kingdom of organisms
with strange, atypical characteristics. In essence, this kingdom is designated for organisms
which do not belong in any other kingdom. The majority of protists are microscopic.

22.9 Classiﬁcation of Protists

There are three phyla of protists, based on their type of nutrition.
1. Protozoa (animal-like protists) are heterotrophs that ingest or absorb their food.
2. Algae (plant-like protists) are autotrophs they get nutrition from photosythesis.
3. Slime moulds and water moulds (fungus-like protists) are also heterotrophs, like
protozoa.

22.10 Protozoa

As heterotrophs, protozoa scavenge materials from their surroundings. Others are predators
which actively hunt or ambush small organisms such as bacteria and other protozoa for a
source of nutrition. Protozoa can be parasitic as well; they may live inside larger organisms,
like humans. Most protozoa live as single cells, although a few form colonies.
Protozoa are generally diﬃcult to identify due to their varied shape. They may appear as
jelly-like blobs, spherical sunbursts, or a ﬂattened leaf. Tiny blood parasites may be only 2
μm long. On the other hand, shell-covered marine may be 5 cm or more in diameter.
Furthermore, diﬀerent protozoans have their own complex life cycles. The complexity has
led certain organisms to be mistakenly classiﬁed for other species.
Nevertheless, protozoa can move, and so, they are classiﬁed based on their methods of
locomotion.
Characteristics of Protozoa :
• About 30,000 species known
• About 10,000 species are pathogenic, including some of the worst human diseases
• heterotrophic
• highly variable in form and life cycle

101

Classiﬁcation of Living Things

• mostly unicellular
• range in size from 0.005 mm to 50 mm
• lack cell walls
they love environment and each other..............

22.11 Algae

Algae are much simpler than protozoa. They are aquatic and contain chlorophyll. Algae can
exist as a single cell or as giant seaweeds 60 m in length. Formerly, algae were classiﬁed as
plants but this was incorrect as algae lack parts of true plants: leaves, stems, roots, xylem,
and phloem. Since algae belong in the kingdom Protista, algae is a broad term used to
denote all aquatic eukaryotes which photosynthesise; algae can diﬀer in size and shape as
well.
There are six phyla of algae:chlorophytes (green algae), phaeophytes (brown algae),
rhodophytes (red algae), chrysophytes (diatoms), pyrrophytes (dinoﬂagellates),
and euglenophytes (euglenoids).

22.11.1 Chlorophytes

Chlorophytes resemble plants the most. Like plants, their cell walls contain cellulose and
they store food in reserve as starch. Chlorophytes can be unicellular or multicellular. Most
chlorophytes use ﬂagellae for some locomotion.

22.11.2 Phaeophytes

Phaeophytes are nearly all multicellular marine organisms, which are known to us as seaweeds.
They have cell walls composed of cellulose and alginic acid (a substance similar to pectin).
The cellulose and alignic acid help to retain water and prevent seawood from drying out
when exposed to air at low tide.
Since phaeophytes live in a tidal environment, they have large, ﬂat fronds (a large leaf)
which can withstand pounding by waves. Their bases strongly anchor the algae to the rocky
seabed and prevent them from being washed out to sea. Phaeophytes are usually found in
areas of cold water.

22.11.3 Rhodophytes

Rhodophytes are typically found in warmer seawater, and are more delicate and smaller
than brown algae (phaeophytes). Rhodophytes are also able to grow at deeper depths in
the ocean, since red algae absorb green, violet, and blue light, the wavelengths of which
penetrate the deepest below the water surface. They also have mucilaginous material to
resist drying.

102

Slime molds & Water molds

22.11.4 Chryosophytes

Chryosophytes are the most abundant unicellular algae in the oceans. They are also one
of the biggest components of plankton, a free-ﬂoating collection of microorganisms, eggs,
and larvae. As photosynthetic organisms, they produce a signiﬁcant amount of atmospheric
oxygen.
The reproduction cycle of chryosophytes is particularly interesting. Note that diatoms
reproduce both asexually and sexually. Since diatoms have a rigid cell wall with an outer
layer of silica (found in sand and glass), the daughter cells produced by mitosis must ﬁt
inside the original cell wall. Therefore, each generation of diatoms is smaller than the one
before. The reduction in size continues until the diatoms produce sexually, producing a
zygote which eventually grows to the original size as it matures.

22.11.5 Pyrrophytes

Pyrrophytes are unicellular, photosynthetic, and mostly aquatic. They have protective coats
composed of stiﬀ cellulose. They are more easily identiﬁable, due to the presence of two
ﬂagellae. The longer ﬂagellae propels the dinoﬂagellate, while the second shorter, ﬂatter
ﬂagellae functions as a rudder.
Some species of pyrrophytes are zooxanthellae. Since they lack cellulose plates, they make
their home in coral reefs and animals, such as sea anemones, and molluscs. In returning
the favour of sheltering them, dinoﬂagellates provide carbohydrates to their host through
photosynthesis. This is why there are nutrient-rich coral reefs in malnutritions water.
A negative aspect of pyrrophytes is that under certain conditions, species of dinoﬂagellates
reproduce rapidly to form a harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as a red tide if dinoﬂag-
ellates are the cause. Such pyrrophytes can produce toxins which may injure or kill wildlife,
and additionally any consumers of contaminated wildlife.

22.11.6 Euglenophytes

Like pyrrophytes, euglenophytes are small unicellular freshwater organisms with two ﬂagella.
They are mainly autotrophic or heterotrophic, depending if they have a red, light-sensitive
structure called an eyespot.

22.12 Slime molds & Water molds

There are two phyla of slime moulds and one phylum of water moulds.

22.12.1 Oomycotes (Water moulds)

Oomycotes are ﬁlamentous organisms which resemble fungi, in that they live as saprotrophs.
Oomycotes diﬀer from other moulds with the presence of spores and their sexual life cycle.

103

Classiﬁcation of Living Things

22.12.2 Myxomycotes (Plasmodial slime moulds)

Myxomycoties are visible to the naked eye as tiny slug-like organisms which creep over decayed
and dead matter. This streaming blob containing many nuclei is called a plasmodium.

22.12.3 Acrasiomycotes (Cellular slime moulds) and its reproductive

cycle

Acrasiomycotes exist as individual amoeboid cells with one nucleus each. When in un-
favourable conditions, each acrasiomycete cell gathers together to form a pseudoplasmod-
ium.

Reproductive Cycle:

1. One acrasiomycete cell joins with others to form a pseudoplasmodium.
2. The pseudoplasmodium shrinks and forms a smaller plasmodium.
3. The plasmodium migrates to a suitable environment.
4. The plasmodium develops a sporangia, where original parental nuclei has divided by
meiosis into haploid spores to be germinated.
5. When favourable conditions arise, the spores germinate and are carried away by animals
or the wind.
6. Cycle repeats.

23.23 Introduction

Although you may not recognise fungi, they are just as prevalent as plants and animals.
Their spores are in the air which we breathe, fungi allow us to make bread, and mushrooms
(a type of fungi) are eaten by us. A few types of fungi are unicellular. For example, yeasts live
as individual oval or cylindrical cells. However, the majority of fungi live are multicellular.
Their bodies are composed of hyphae, a network of ﬁne ﬁlaments. In a mushroom, the

111

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs

hyphae are densely packed so it is diﬃcult to see the individual structures when a mushroom
is eaten. However, a mushroom is only a specialised reproductive part of the whole fungus.
The main part of the fungi is underground in a whole web of hyphae, called a mycelium.
In the mycelium, each fungal cell is separated from each other by a septum. Each fungal
cell may have one or more nuclei and remains connected to the mycelium because the septa
are porous, allowing cytoplasm to ﬂow through the hyphae and fungal cell walls, made of a
hard material called chitin. Some fungi do not have septa, and they appear to be large,
branching, multinucleate cells.

23.24 Nutrition

Fungi are saprophytes. When they ﬁnd a source of food (e.g. dead wood, orange peel) ,
they decompose it and digest it. The enzymes break down larger organic molecules in the
substrate into smaller molecules. These smaller molecules diﬀuse into the fungus, where
they are used to allow growth and repair.
Fungi which feed on living cells are parasitic. For example, athletes foot grows on the
human foot. These kinds of fungi produce hyphae called haustoria, which can penetrate
host cells without immediately killing them.
However, they are friendlier species of fungi. Many fungi live symbiotically with plants or
animals. For example, most trees have fungi living in close contact with their roots. In this
relationship, known as a mycorrhiza, there are many beneﬁts:
• Growing around the plant roots and often entering plant cells, the hyphae absorb minerals
from the soil and release them in the roots. The fungi gets its source of food (organic
nutrients) while delivering food to the plant.

• The mycelium here would increase the surface area, thus the absorptive surface, of the

plant roots.

• The fungal cells help to maintain air and water ﬂow in the soil around the roots.
• The fungi may prevent other potentially pathogenic fungi to attack the tree.

23.25 Fungal Reproduction

Fungi can reproduce in two ways. Firstly, they make asexually produce through frag-
mentation. This occurs when pieces of hyphae are broken oﬀ, which then grow into new
mycelia.
The second method is by spores. Spores are lightweight structures and windblown designed
to be transported over long distances and by many mediums, such as on the bodies of insects
and birds. They are additionally light enough to be blown away for hundreds of kilometers.
Spores may be asexual and sexual. Their sexual properties can be analysed to classify the
four phylla of fungi.

112

Types of Fungi

23.26 Types of Fungi

23.26.1 Zygospore Fungi (Zygomycetes)

This phyllum includes bread moulds and other saprotrophs. Comparable to bacteria, this
phyllum prefers asexual reproduction over sexual reproduction.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy, the union of the two parent hyphae, occurs and results in the creation
of a heterokaryotic (n + n) zygosporangium or zygospore. Note that the zygospore is
NOT diploid yet; the haploid nuclei are simply clumped together.
3. Immediately, a thick wall develops around the zygospore to protect it from drying and
other hazards. The zygospore becomes dormant.
4. When conditions are favourable, the zygospore absorbs water and undergoes karyogamy
(n + n = 2n), where the haploid nuclei contributed by the two parents fuse to produce
diploid zygosporangia.
5. The now diploid zygosporangium then undergoes meiosis to form haploid sporangia.
6. Through asexual reproduction of fungi (See above for more information), the spores from
the sporangia germinate and grow into new mycelia.
7. Back to step #1.

23.26.2 Club Fungi (Basidiomycetes)

This phyllum increases mushrooms and shelf fungi. In many ways, the reproduction stages
of this phyllum is similar to that of zygomycetes.
1. Two haploid hyphae of opposite types, also known as mating strain + and mating
strain -, combine and fuse together.
2. Plasmogamy takes place, and a dikaryotic mycelium forms. The dikaryotic mycelium
grows faster then the haploid parental mycelia.
3. Environmental factors cause the dikaryotic mycelium to form compact masses which de-
velop into basidiocarps, short-lived reproductive structures. An example is the mushroom.
4. The basidiocarp gills are lined with terminal dikaryotic cells called basidia, which then
undergo karyogamy.
5. The basidia are now diploid. They undergo meiosis to develop haploid basidiospores, a
term referring to a basidiomycetes spores.
6. Still remaining on the basidiocarp, the haploid basidiospores eject, fall from the basidiocarp,
and are dispersed by the wind when mature.
7. In a favourable environment, the basidiospores germinate and grow into short-lived
haploid mycelia.

23.27 Key Terms

synapomorphy

23.28 Introduction

What makes an animal an animal?
If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be deﬁned by synapomor-
phies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT deﬁne this or any taxon using
symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters
(the independent evolution of similarity, or "convergent evolution"). See pages 654 - 656 and
Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed
below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.

23.29 Characteristics of an Animal

• There is no one universally accepted deﬁnition of an animal. The following treatment

follows your text, beginning on page 876.
• Animals:

• Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes . . .
• Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants & fungi
• Share unique characteristics . . .
• Share certain reproductive characteristics . . .
• Other commonly used deﬁnitions . . .

Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes
• Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals:

• Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
• Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic.
• Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
• Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi.

• However, there is a diﬀerence here between animals and fungi. Animals generally
take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are
absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then
absorb the resulting nutrients.
Animals share unique characteristics
• Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
• Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
• Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139,

Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)

114

Characteristics of an Animal

• Tight junctions (sealing function)
• Desmosomes (anchoring function)
• Gap junctions (communication function)

Animals share certain reproductive characteristics
• Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
• In most animals, a small, haploid, ﬂagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid,

nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.

• Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A
synapomorphy? This feature could be another "unique characteristic" shared by animals.
• Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage
(or stages) that are morphologically & ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva
(plural: larvae).

Other commonly used deﬁnitions or characterizations
• It is surprisingly diﬃcult to ﬁnd two texts that agree on a precise deﬁnition of an animal.

Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
• Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest

their food.

• Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced
in multicellular sex organs, and the zygote passes through embryonic stages that include
a blastula.

• Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They
are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed
from two diﬀerent haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a
blastula.

• Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What

would a cladist think of this deﬁnition of the taxon Animalia?)

What kinds of animals are there?
• Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...

• There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the

phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.

• Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic

acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.

• Remember that two animals in diﬀerent phyla generally are considered to be more diﬀerent
from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more diﬀerent
from annelids than humans are from sharks).

23.31 Phylum Porifera

Figure 6

Sponges

Name means "pore-bearing".
This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between
5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.
Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no
nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as
being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a
free swimming larva.
Their bodies are porous. They are ﬁlter feeders; water ﬂows in through many small openings,
and out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable
middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called
spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and ﬁbres made of spongin (a form of collagen).

117

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs

Choanocytes are ﬂagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and
trap and phagocytize food particles.
Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally ﬂexible: they can become any type of
cell at any point in the sponges development. This allows for the great regenerative power
sponges have.
Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and
possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They
somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).
Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor
endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoﬂagellates, a.k.a. "zooxanthellae").

23.32 Phylum Cnidaria

See text pages 886 - 889.
Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning "nettle".
This phylum They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall
has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undiﬀerentiated middle layer
called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered
to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually
extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.

118

Phylum Cnidaria

Figure 7

Jellyﬁsh Development

There are two basic body plans: the polyp14 and the medusa15. The polyp is sessile and
attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa
("jellyﬁsh") is a ﬂoating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some
cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have
both.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa%20%28biology%29

119

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs

The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called "alternation of generations": an
alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.
The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular "harpoons" that
function in defense and prey capture. When ﬁred, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that
in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.
Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas
exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a "nerve net."
Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic
relationship (Dinoﬂagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of
the primary productivity of coral reefs.
There are three main classes in the phylum
• Class Hydrozoa16 (hydras and Portugese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples

of this Class)

• Class Scyphozoa17 (jellyﬁsh)

• The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.

• Class Anthozoa18 (sea anemones, most corals)

• No medusa (jellyﬁsh) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this
group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual "corals" grow.

23.33 Phylum Platyhelminthes

See text pages 890 - 893.
Name means "ﬂat worm"
Most members of this phylum are parasitic (ﬂukes and tapeworms), but some are free living
(e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.
They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., "ﬂat").
Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unseg-
mented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior "brain" and a simple ladder-like nervous
system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange
systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or "ﬂame
cells").
Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex
reproductive (life) cycles.
There are four main classes of platyhelminths:
• Class Turbellaria19 (mostly free living ﬂatworms, e.g., planaria)

Phylum Rotifera

• Class Monogenea20 (parasitic ﬂukes)
• Class Trematoda21 (parasitic ﬂukes, e.g., liver ﬂuke and the human blood ﬂuke, Schisto-

soma)

• Class Cestoda22 (tapeworms)

• Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or

digestive system.

23.34 Phylum Rotifera

See text page 900
The Rotifers. The name means "wheel bearing," a reference to the corona, a feeding structure
(see below).
They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered
pseudocoelomates.
Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.
Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the
corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The
corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animals jaws. The gut is complete (i.e.,
mouth & anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized
circulatory or gas-exchange structures.
Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They
typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.
Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is
common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present,
sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and
are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a
diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily
when living conditions are unfavorable.
Most structures in rotifers are syncytial ("a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into
separate cells," or "a multinucleated cell") and show eutely (here, "constant or near-constant
number of nuclei").

23.35 Phylum Nematoda

See text pages 894 - 895.
Name from the Greek for "thread".

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs

This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the
true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates.
They are vermiform, or wormlike.
In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!).
Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete.
They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange
structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle ﬁbers. The sexes are separate.
Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic
importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much
anywhere.
In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal
mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!
Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other
animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species
Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number
(eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).

23.36 Phylum Annelida

See text pages 906 - 909.
Name means "ringed", from the Greek annulatus.
This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many diﬀerent
names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.
Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates.
Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and
a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal "bristles"
(setae or chaetae).
Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere suﬃcient water is
available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.
Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal
and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory
system (metanephridia).
There are three main classes of Annelids
• Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
• Class Polychaeta (marine worms)
• Class Hirudinea (leeches)

122

23.37 Phylum Arthropoda

Phylum Arthropoda

Figure 8 Arthropods

Name means "jointed feet".
This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the
largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that
the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era.
Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been
named.
These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates.
The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They
have an open circulatory system.
The most notable advancement of this phylum is a rigid exoskeleton. It has major implications
in these organisms locomotion, ﬂexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and
growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.
There are several major groupings of arthropods:
Major subgroups include:
• The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike

feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.

• The Trilobites...they get their own grouping

123

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs

• The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and un-

branched (uniramous) appendages.

• The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of

antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.

Major Classes Include
• Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)
• Class Diplopoda (millipedes)
• Class Chilopoda (centipedes)
• Class Insecta (insects)
• Class Crustacea (crabs, crayﬁsh, lobsters, shrimp)

23.38 Phylum Mollusca

present.

See text pages 900 - 905.
Name means "soft".
This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others.
About 110,000 species
All molluscs have a similar body plan:
• A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
• A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
• A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if

• Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.
Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but
the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Devel-
opment is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization.
Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).
Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of
annelids.
There are several major classes of molluscs:
• Class Polyplacophora (chitons)
• Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs)
• Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)
• Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses)

23.39 Phylum Echinodermata

Name means "spiny skin"
This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.

124

Phylum Chordata

Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.
As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally
symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.
Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system
of ﬂuid-ﬁlled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding,
locomotion, and gas exchange.
There are six major classes of echinoderms:
• Class Asteroidea (sea stars)
• Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)
• Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)
• Class Crinoidea (sea lilies)
• Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers)

23.40 Phylum Chordata

Name means "the chordates", i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their
lifecycle.
This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.
There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.
• A notochord, or a longitudinal, ﬂexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve
cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This
is the structure for which the phylum is named.

• A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube
located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally
located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and
spinal cord.

• Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without
continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates,
these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modiﬁed for
gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.

• A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of
most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal
elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.

Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved
independently from the segmentation of annelids.
Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:
• Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbo-
hydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates
are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are ﬁlter
feeders. The only "chordate" characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits.

125

Multicellular Photosynthetic Autotrophs

Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates & adult vertebrates than adult
urochordates.

• Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their
blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually
live on the bottom, but can swim.

• Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...
Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.

23.40.1 Subphylum Vertebrata

Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.
This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.
The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium & vertebral column in adults.

Neural Crest Cells

Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage
cells, pigment cells, neurons & glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the
cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.
Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.
Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.

126

24 Chordates

The phylum Chordata includes three subphyla. These include vertebrates and invertebrate
chordates.

24.1 Characteristics

Notochord: the rod-shaped supporting axis found in the dorsal part of the embryos of all
chordates, including vertebrates
Flexible, non-collapsible rod dorsal to the gut/coelom and below the nervous system,
hydrostatic, ﬂuid wrapped in tough connective tissue. As bone does not compact, muscles
tensed on one side result in movement instead of shortening the animal. This allows much
better locomotion than do cilia for larger animals in water, a crucial victory for later success.
Pharyngeal slits: Slits in the pharynx originally used to gather food, water enters the mouth,
passes through pharynx and out gill-like slits, passing through a cavity called an antrium
and then outside. In humans, present only in embryo.
Dorsal nerve cord: A neural tube dorsal to the notochord
Postanal tail: Elongation of the body and notochord, nerve cord and muscles past anus into
tail, early locomotive function led to success.
Non-synapomorphic characteristics (not limited to chordates):
• bisymmetrical (bilateral symmetry)
• segmented muscles and bones

24.2 Subphylum Urochordata

The tunicates are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Cephalochordata,
these two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Only the tunicate larvae have
notochords, nerve cords, and postanal tails. Most adult tunicates are sessile, ﬁlter-feeders
which retain their pharyngeal slits. Adult tunicates also develop a sac, called a tunic,
which gives tunicates their name. Cilia beating within the turnicate cause water to enter
the incurrent siphon. The water enters the body, passes through the pharyngeal slits,
and leaves the body through the excurrent siphon. Undigested food is removed through
the anus. Tunicates are hemaphrodites and can reproduce asexually through budding.In
urochordates notochord is conﬁned to larval tail.These lack cranium. These have an open
type of circulatory system.Excretion is by neural gland,nephrocytes.

127

Chordates

24.3 Subphylum Cephalochordata

The lancelets are located in this subphylum. Along with the subphylum Urochordata, these
two subphyla make up the invertebrate chordates. Lancelets receive their name from their
bladelike shape. They resemble ﬁsh but they are actually scaleless chordates only a few
centimeters long. They spend most of their time buried in the sand with their mouths
protruding. Fossils of lancelets have been found to be over 550 million years old.
Dropped out sessile stage, what was the larval stage is now sexually reproductive. Includes
Branchiostoma (“amphioxus”).

24.4 Subphylum Vertebrata

(Vertebra from Latin vertere, to turn). Characterized by separate bones or cartilage blocks
ﬁrmly joined as a backbone. The backbone supports and protects a dorsal nerve cord.
Vertebrates have tissues which are organized into organs which in turn are organized into
organ systems.
All vertebrates share the following characteristics: - segmentation - a true coelom - bilateral
symmetry - cephalization - a backbone - a bony skull - a closed circulatory system - chambered
heart - two pairs of jointed appendages - tissues organized into organs
Vertebrate Organ Systems: - Nervous System - Circulatory System - Digestive System -
Respiratory System - Reproductive System - Excretory System
• Vertebral column: Not present in higher vertebrate adults. (In humans, the gel-like,
spongy core of the vertebral column is the only remainder. Ruptured or herniated disc is
an injury to this.)

• Cranium: Composite structure of bone/cartilage. Two functions: 1. Supports sensory

organs of head and 2. Encloses or partially encloses the brain.

What evolutionary relationship could we imagine between sessile echinoderms and the higher
chordate animals?
Paedomorphic (child-form) hypothesis: basically, evolution of sexual reproduction in what
had previously been a larval life stage, or the retention of at least one juvenile characteristic
into the adult (adult = sexually reproducing) stage. Some scientists believe that this occurred
in a proto-chordate animal lineage. Maybe chordates (and vertebrates) arose from sessile
(attached) ancestors. Selection in these proto-chordates maybe began to favor more time in
the larval stage, as feeding was more successful or mortality lower in this stage. As larvae
got bigger physics shows that the cilia become less eﬃcient for locomotion, favoring the
undulating motion allowed by a notochord.
Is this hypothesis crazy? A similar example of this today is Epemeroptera, the mayﬂy, which
has almost abandoned its adult stage. Its one-year lifespan is mostly larval with just a brief
day of reproduce-and-die as an adult, which doesn’t even have usable mouthparts.
Tunicate (sea squirt) larva has all four chordate characteristics, although adult sessile
(“attached”).

• Ostracoderms: extinct Agnathans which had primitive ﬁns and massive plates of bony

• Cyclostomes: "circle mouth" - a group of Agnathans which is still alive in the form of

tissue on their body.

lampreys and hagﬁsh.

Appeared approximately 500 million years ago and dominated the oceans for about 100
million years. The ﬁrst group of ﬁsh to appear. They had neither jaws, paired ﬁns, nor
scales, but they were the ﬁrst organisms with a backbone.

Class Acanthodia

"spiny ﬁsh" Appeared about 430 million years ago. An extinct class of ﬁsh that developed
jaws with bony edges. They had internal skeletons made of cartilage and some bone.

Class Placodermi

Appeared about 410 million years ago, dominated the sea for about 50 million years. An
extinct class of ﬁsh with massive heads.

24.4.2 Class Chondrichthyes

"cartilaginous ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with bony ﬁsh. Includes sharks,
skates and rays, and chimaeras. Their skeletons are made of cartilage strengthened by the
mineral calcium carbonate.
The main characteristics and distinguishing features of this class: - gills - single-loop blood
circulation - vertebral column - presence of placoid scales on their bodies - internal skeleton
of cartilage - paired, ﬂeshy pectoral and pelvic ﬁns - asymmetrical tail ﬁn prevents sinking -
fatty liver provides neutral buoyancy - visceral clefts present as separate and distinct gills -
no external ear - oviparous - internal fertilization - ectoderms - cold blooded

24.4.3 Class Osteichthyes

"bony ﬁsh" Appeared about 400 million years ago with cartilaginous ﬁsh. Includes about
95% of todays ﬁsh species.

Subclass Sarcopterygii
ﬂeshy-ﬁnned ﬁshes. Fins have bones and muscles, homologous to our limbs.

Order Dipnoi
lung ﬁshes, two groups isolated when continents separated

129

Chordates

Order Crossopterygii
includes coelacanths and rhipodistians, gave rise to amphibians, had lungs which evolved
into a swim bladder in bony ﬁshes, and labyrinthodont teeth, characterized by complex
folding of enamel.
• Skeleton made of bone, jaws, ﬁns, most with scales, two-chambered heart.

24.4.4 Class Amphibia

means “both lives”, aquatic larvae, terrestrial adult Amphibians: - Legs - Lungs - Double-
Loop Circulation - Partially Divided Heart - Cutaneous Respiration (Breathes through
Skin)

Order Salientia
frogs (jumping) (aka Anura)

Order Urodela
salamanders (tailed)
Labyrinthodont amphibians: oldest known amphibians, inherited characteristic teeth from
crossopterygii ancestor, had stocky, aquatic larvae.
Amphibians have limbs instead of ﬁns. Girdles and vertebral column now more substantial
and connected, support body on legs.
Lisamphybia: no scales, “smooth”, eggs with no shell, laid in water (water-reliant).
Amphibians gave rise to cotylosaurs, from which arose dinosaurs, turtles, lizards, and
therapsids.

Class Reptilia

amniotic egg allowed freedom from water, shelled egg. (Amnion: protection). Reptiles have
four extra-embryonic membranes:
• Amnion: supports aquatic environment inside egg in ﬂuid sac.
• Allantois: allows gas exchange and elimination of wastes.
• Chorion: gas exchange
• Yolk sac: only one of the four left over from amphibian ancestor
Reptiles cold-blooded, or ectothermic, meaning that their heat come from their environment.
Sometimes deﬁned as all amniotes that are not birds or mammals.
Reptiles can be classiﬁed by skull structure into four groups:
• Anapsid
• Synapsid
• Diapsid
• Euryasid

130

Refers to number of holes in the skull. Cotylosaurs had Anapsid skull
Dermatocranium: from bony outer skull structure, precursor to human cranium.

Subphylum Vertebrata

Subclass Anapsidia

Subclass Testudinata
turtles1, terrapins

Subclass Diapsida
dinosaurs2, snakes3, most stuﬀ

Subclass Synapsida

Order Therapsids

Subclass Diapsida
includes Ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles convergent on dolphins; Plesiosaurs, ancient sea
monsters; Squamates, including lizards and snakes; and Thecodonts, which gave rise to
• birds
• dinosaurs
• crocodilians
Dinosaurs: broken into two groups, based on hip structure
• Saurischia: lizard hips (gave rise to birds [!]), ancestrally bipedal
• Ornithischian: bird hips, ancestrally quadripedal
Crocodilians: come from archosaurs, the only extant (still living today) archosaur descendant.
Ancestrally bipedal, secondarily quadripedal.
Synapsids: refers to joined (Greek syn-, together with) parts of skull. Led eventually to
mammals. Synapsid pelycosaur >> therapsid >> mammals
Pelycosaur: Sail-backed dinosaur, legs not spread out like lizard but more pillar-like and
under body, allowing greater activity and competence in motion, pendulum like rather than
constant push-up. Teeth diﬀerentiated into diﬀerent types, for pre-processing of food needed
by higher metabolism. Skull changes, bone histology, suggestions of warm-bloodedness.

Chordates

Class Aves

arose late Jurassic, early Cretaceous. Feathers, skeleton modiﬁed for ﬂight. Feathers:
epidermal derivative, made of keratin (like ﬁngernails). Carpometacarpis: bears primary
ﬂight feathers, parallel to hand parts. Keeled sternum: breastbone, powerful one needed
to support ﬂight muscles. Strong, light, occasionally hollow bones. All birds lay eggs (as
contrasted to reptiles, which have developed live birthing over 100 independent times.) Why
are there no live-bearing birds? Early birds had teeth, lost them. With mammals, only
exothermic animals.
Archaeopteryx: “ancient wing”, Jurassic bird-reptile, very dinosaur-like. Good fossils found
in Zolenhoﬀen, German sandstone mine with ﬁne sand, shows feathers clearly, found shortly
after Darwin’s publication and used to support his hypothesis. Thick, heavy bones and no
sternum, bony tail, not a good ﬂyer but did have primary ﬂight feathers.
Archaeornithes: includes archaeopteryx.
Paleognathae: gave rise to Australian ﬂightless birds.
Neognathae: remaining live birds.

Class Mammalia

Two unique characteristics, or synapomorphies:
• Hair
• Mammary glands
(don’t fossilize well)
Three skeletal characteristics (fossilize)
• Lower jaw only one bone, the dentary (several in reptiles)
• Three bones in middle ear: malleus, incus, stapes (reptiles have one or two, never three)
• Joint between upper and lower jaws between dentary and squamosal of skull (in reptiles

this joint is between other bones)

Mammals basically have a synapsid skull design inherited from ancestor
Non diagnostic characteristics (not unique to mammals):
• Warm-blooded
• Skin glands: sweat glands and oil-producing sebaceous glands
• Large nasal cavities (because of high metabolism) Clean, warm and humidify air
• Heterodonty (diﬀerentiated teeth)
• Diphiodonty: two sets of teeth: baby and adult (“deciduous” teeth, drop out) (reptile

teeth are continually replaced)

Subclass Protheria
monotremes (Greek mon-, one; and trema, hole), or egg-laying mammals, have one opening
for excretion and urination.

132

Subphylum Vertebrata

Subclass Theria
Metatheria: Marsupials (opossum, kangaroo. . . ) Eutheria: Placental mammals (all common
mammals)
Marsupium: (from Greek marsypion, purse or pouch). Gestation period much shorter than
in Eutherian mammals, but after leaving the uterus the tiny oﬀspring crawls into a pouch
where it completes development latched onto a teat.
Recent molecular (read: genetic) evidence suggests that two diﬀerent mammal groups
may have developed live-bearing ability separately. Instead of being a “rough draft” for
placental-style live bearing, perhaps the marsupial pouch approach is another solution to
the same problem. Advantage: in tough times the parent can pitch out the oﬀspring and
increase its own chance of survival.

133

25 Tissues and Systems

135

26 Epithelial tissue

Comes from various sources, ectodermal or endodermal material. Cell sheet lines a
surface or body cavity. One side, called freesurface or Apical, is exposed to
• animal interior (forming the lumen) or
• exterior of its body cavity.
The other side rests on the basal layer.
Epithelial tissue is not penetrated by blood vessels.
Two categories:
• sheets
• glands
Classiﬁed on two features:
• simple, (a single layer of cells),
• stratiﬁed, (more than one cell layer.)
Cell shape at free surface:
• squamous (broad and ﬂat)
• cuboidal (spherish)
• columnar (tall and thin)
Simple squamous epithelium
usually lines body cavities and vessels,alveoli, glomeruli of kidney; in blood and lymph
vessels called endothelium; in body cavities called mesothelium (serosae): parietal serous
membranes line body wall, visceral serous membranes cover organ
Simple cuboidal epithelium
in ducts like kidney and salivary glands.
Simple columnar epithelium
nonciliated type lines digestive tract, ciliated type lines some regions of uterine tubes and
lungs
Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium
(important) lines mouth, esophagus,and vagina. Cells sometimes dead, ﬂat and keratinized,
making them resistant to abrasion. Stratiﬁed squamous epithelium changes to columnar
squamous epithelium progressively down esophagus to the stomach.
Epidermis

137

Epithelial tissue

from epithelium. Below this is dermis, thicker and with blood vessels.
Two specialized epithelia:
• pseudostratiﬁed
• transitional
Pseudostratiﬁed epithelia
lines the trachea (where it is ciliated)and the male urethra (where it is non ciliated), looks
stratiﬁed but not.
Transitional epithelia
found only in bladder and urinary system. As it stretches it appears to go from 6 to 3 cell
layers deep.
Glandular epithelia
(gland: group of cells that excretes something.. mostly derived from epithelium. Glands
are classiﬁed into endocrine and exocrine by where they excrete.
Endocrine glands
secrete hormones into the blood without use of ducts.
Exocrine glands
secrete onto the body surface or into a cavity, thru a duct. Exocrine substances include
sweat, mucous, oil, and saliva. An exocrine gland is the liver, which secretes bile.

138

27 Connective tissue

This is a “grab bag” category of diverse tissue types. Functions include binding and
supporting. Types include bone, cartilage, ﬁbrous connective tissue, blood and
adipose (fat) tissue.
If you took away everything in the body except the connective tissue, you’d still be able to
see the basic form of the body.
Form: distinctive cells surrounded by a cell matrix made of extra-cellular ﬁber grounded
in a ground substance (excluding blood)
Types:

1. connectile connective tissues (can be 1. loose or 2. dense)

2. special connective tissue (includes blood, bones and cartilage).
Fibroblasts form connective tissue proper;

chondoroblasts form cartilage;

osteoblasts form bone;

and blood is formed from various sources.
Ground substance: “unstructured” material that ﬁlls space between cells and contains
ﬁbers. Made of

1. interstitial ﬂuid (bathes cells)

2. proteoglycans (protein core with attached polysaccharides, glycoaminoglycans or GAGs
such as chondroitin sulfate, keratin sulfate, and hyalronic acid, whose consistency is syrupy
to gelatin-like)

3. cell-adhesion proteins (connect connective tissue cells to the ﬁbers).
Fibers of connective tissue:

139

Connective tissue

1. Collagen (ﬂexible protein resistant to stretching, tensile strength, most abundant
protein in animals, white)

2. elastin (rubbery, resilient protein, in dermis, lungs, blood vessels, yellow when fresh)

3. andreticulin (like collagen).
Loose connective tissue: found beneath skin, anchors muscles,nerves etc. Include ﬁ-
broblasts, macrophages, mast cells,and adipose cells. Fibers include collagen and
elastic ﬁbers. Ground substance is “syrupy”. Adipose included.
Dense connective tissue: largely densely packed ﬁbers of collagen or elastin regularly
or irregularly arranged. Forms tendons and ligaments, coverings of muscles, capsules
around organs and joints, and dermis of skin.

Cartilage: There are three cartilage types:

1. hyaline cartilage

2. ﬁbrocartilage (ﬁbrous cartilage)

3. elastic cartilage
Hyaline cartilage: most widespread cartilage type, in adults forms articular surfaces of
long bones, rib tips, rings of trachea, and parts of skull. Mostly collagen, name refers to
glassy appearance. In embryo, bones form ﬁrst as hyaline cartilage, later ossiﬁes. Found
in tracheal rings. Few collagen ﬁbers.
Fibrous cartilage: have lots of collagen ﬁbers. Found in intervertebral discs, pubic
symphesis. Grades into dense tendon and ligament tissue.
Elastic cartilage: springy and elastic. Found in internal support of external ear and in
epiglottis, yellow when fresh.
Chondrocites (cartilage cells) rely on diﬀusion for nutrients, as cartilage has no direct
blood supply, and no enervation (nerves). Can be loaded with calcium salts.

140

Subphylum Vertebrata

Bone: Specialized connective tissue, calcium phosphate arranged in highly ordered unit
called osteon, or Hyvercian system. Concentric rings around central canal with blood
vessels and enervation (nerves). Bone varied, not all vertebrate bone is even cellular. Our
concern: simple pattern for mammals.
Lacuna (spaces in which osteocytes found); canaliculi (little canals) bigger diagonal cells,
layers of bone called lamellae.
Three types of bone cells, ending in

-blast, (mend bone)

-cyte (fortify bone)

-clast (tear down bone)
Classiﬁed by

1. appearance (spongy vs. hard)

2. where found (outside or inside)

3. how it is formed (endochondral cartilage model forms ﬁrst and then is ossiﬁed, and
entramembranous, bone forms directly without cartilage precursor)
Example of endochondral bone formation: long bone begins to ossify from center shaft,
calciﬁed region expands and cuts oﬀ diﬀusion of nutrients as bone replaces cartilage. In
young mammals, secondary ossiﬁcation centers then form at bone ends, growth has stopped
by sexual maturity as all primary bone is ossiﬁed. In other animals, bones continue growing
throughout their lifetime.
Three types of intramembrous bone:

1. dermal bone

2. sessamoid bone

3. perichondral bone.
Dermal bone forms skull, shoulder/pectoral girdle, and integument, descended from dermal
armor of ancestor. Comes from mesoderm, in dermis of skin.
Sessamoid bones: form directly in tendons. Example: kneecap, also in wrist. Deals with
stress.
Perichondral bone means “around cartilage,” forms around cartilage or bone. Func-
tions in bone repair and in ossiﬁcation of endochondral bone.

141

Connective tissue

Bone remodeling and repair: bone has mineral structure, and develops tiny fractures,
which, under stress, can lead to larger fractures. To combat this, bone is constantly replaced.
Osteoclasts channel through existing bone, tear down and leave behind osteoblasts
and lacuna, leaving osteocytes. Continually resets mineral structure of bone, and is
preventative maintenance.
When bone broken, callus forms in open ends, periosteum gives rise to new bone with
calcium and new bone matrix, leaves irregular mend. Later, osteoblasts continue ﬁxing over
time and slowly removing imperfection.

142

28 Muscle tissue

Mesodermal in origin, muscle has several functions: supply force for movement, restrain
movement, proper posture, act on viscera (internal organs) for peristalsis (moving food
down digestive tract), give body shape, form sphincters, (such as in esophagus, between
stomach and intestine, large and small intestine, in anus), in sheets of muscles, aﬀect air
ﬂow in and out of lungs, line blood vessels and play vital role in circulation.
Secondary roles: heat production (shivering a specialized heat production to supplement
metabolism).
Muscles co-opted to other non-original functions: sharks detect electrical ﬁeld created by ﬁsh
muscles. Some ﬁsh formed electric organs, create current strong enough to repel predators
or stun prey. Other ﬁsh can use ﬁeld as “radar” to see things and communicate with other
animals. (Evolved independently in diﬀerent groups).
Diﬀerent classiﬁcations: by color, (red or white) location, nature of nervous system
control (voluntary or involuntary), embryonic origin, or by general microscopic ap-
pearance (striated, smooth, and cardiac.)
Striated muscle (or skeletal muscle): under voluntary control. Individual cells called
ﬁbers, grouped into fascicle. Myoﬁbrils founding one cell made of even smaller myoﬁl-
aments. Each striated cell very long and multi-nucleated. Fibers joined end to end to
form longer composite ﬁbers. Sarcomeres: repeating units make up myoﬁbrils. Two
kinds of myoﬁlaments, thick kind made up of myosin and thin of actin. Striations visible
in light microscope, smaller part only with electron microscope.
Cardiac muscle: occurs only in heart. Light banding visible under light microscope.
Each band short, principally mononucleate (occasionally dinucleate) often branched, joined
together with intercollated discs. Involuntary. Waves of contraction spread through intercol-
lated discs. Initiated by nerve stimulation or can originate in the heart itself (useful in heart
transplants.)
Smooth muscle: no striations visible with light microscope. Almost entirely visceral
function: digestion, sphincters, urogenital tracts, piloerectory muscles (make hairs stand up),
lungs. Non-voluntary control. Slow and sustained action. Each cell mononucleate, short,
fusiform (spindly) in shape, cells usually uniform in size.
Striated muscle contraction: Muscle broken into units called fascicles, in units of myoﬁbrils.
Repeating units called sarcomeres, consisting of two kinds of myoﬁlaments:

1. thick, myosin ﬁlament

2. thin, actin ﬁlament.

143

Muscle tissue

Sarcomere: Thick and thin ﬁlaments interspersed in ordered grid.
Sliding ﬁlament theory: thick and thin ﬁlaments move past each other in opposite
direction, shortening length. Longer muscles contract more rapidly than short ones (see cell
bio for details).
Myosin molecule: two polypeptides twisted together with two globular heads at end.
Myosin ﬁlament: many slender myosin molecules together.
Actin ﬁlament: chain of actin single, tropomyosin strands with repeated globular
troponin, and with actin. All play role in muscle contraction. Myocin heads have sites
that bind to actin. Actin ﬁlaments have many regular sites that can bind to myosin.
Troponin has four sites:

1. one to bind myosin

2. one for actin

3. one for tropomyocin

4. one for calcium ions
Nerve signal reaches muscle, triggers release of chemical signal called neurotransmitter,
that diﬀuses across cell membrane (sarcolimic reticulum) and binds to receptors in it.
Receptor is acetylcholine, ACH. When there is enough nerve signal, the message travels
through t-line to sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions.
Lacking calcium, tropomyosin site blocked. In calcium, myosin binding sites exposed and
heads bind to actin molecules, delivering force to move ﬁbers in relation to each other.
Myocin head then interacts with ATP to get “recocked”, if myosin still exposed then it
ﬁres again and results in further muscle contration. If there is no further nerve signal,
sarcoplasmic reticulum sequesters Ca+ ions again and no recocking occurs.
Quirari (or curare): known from movies, used in South America, blocks acetylcholine
receptors in cell and causes skeletal paralysis. Victim dies of asphyxiation because he can’t
breathe.
Duchennes muscular dystrophy: degeneration of sarcolema, plasma membrane of
muscle cell unable to release signal and quickly atrophies.
Fast and slow twitch ﬁbers: vertebrate muscle ﬁber. Terms relative within one group
of animals. Diﬀerences related to diﬀerences in enervation, type of myocin, and actin
activation.
Two parts of force generated by muscle: 1. active component 2. elastic component (energy
stored in muscle when stretched by gravity or another force. Stored in muscle elastic tissue
around tendons. Especially important in limb oscillation, like running, or trunk twisting,
like ﬁsh swimming. Up to 90% of stored elastic energy can be recovered.)

144

Subphylum Vertebrata

How does a muscle match its power to its job? Two ways:

1. rate modulation, derived from frequency of nervous stimulation of muscle, force
increases as frequency of stimulation increases up to point of tetanus.

2. selective involvement of motor units, a given neuron enervates a ﬁxed number of
muscle cells, (a motor unit), and force is increased by recruiting more motor units. Motor
units may be small, such as in eye, or larger, like in leg muscle.
How do muscles grow stronger?

1. add more myoﬁlaments, increases cross sectional area by up to 50%, more little ratchets
working

2. proliferation in blood vessels and connective tissue around muscle
Muscle strength is relative to cross sectional area, not length. Not always feasible to add
more cross sectional area.
Pinnate ﬁbers: oriented obliquely (Y-shaped) to minimize muscle mass, in certain circum-
stances, like calf muscle. Spreads muscle out.
Velocity of shortening greater in long muscle than short. Why? Contraction tied to relation
between ﬁbers, and to total length of muscle. Both long and short muscles reach same
percentage of contraction in same unit time, but distance covered by the longer muscle is
greater.
Synergist muscles: muscles work together to produce motion in same general direction.
Bicep shares work with brachialis.
Antagonist muscles: muscles that oppose each other. Bicep pulls forearm in, triceps pulls
it back out.
Origin vs. insertion: origin is the end of the muscle that more ﬁxed in its attachment to
the body. The more movable end called insertion.
Fixators: muscles that act to stabilize a joint or lever system. Like upper arm when you
clench your ﬁst hard.
Flexors and extensors: applied mainly to limbs. Flexor bends one part relative to another
about limb, extensor straightens it.
Adductor and abductor: adductor draws a limb toward the ventral surface. Abductor
moves limb away from ventral surface. (Adduct: drawn toward; abduct: carry away).

145

29 Vertebrate digestive system

Functions to break down food into molecules small enough to absorb, or pass across digestive
membrane.
Digestive tract: tube extending from lips of mouth to anus or cloacae in bird, reptile or
monotreme.
Lumanal glands: empty into inner body cavity (lumen: inner surface).
Tract divided into three main regions: 1. buccal cavity 2. pharynx 3. alimentary canal
Alimentary canal divided into four regions: 1. esophagus 2. stomach 3. small intestine 4.
large intestine
Accessory digestive glands, outside digestive tract proper, secrete into lumen of tract
through ducts. Includes the salivary glands, liver and pancreas.
Buccal cavity, which includes palate and tongue, develops from infolding of stomadeum,
or second opening of blastula, whereas the rest of the digestive tract develops from the
primitive gut.
Teeth: capture and hold prey. In mammals in particular further process and break down
food into small particles, increasing surface area available for enzymatic action.
Tooth anatomy: 1. crown projects above gum, 2. root below gum, 3. enamel is outer
coating of crown, hardest surface in body, of epideral origin 4. dentin, below enamel,
bone-like and forms bulk of tooth, is harder than bone and contains nerves and blood vessels.
(Remember that mammals are heterodontic, with diﬀerent types of teeth).
Pharynx: air passage for adult, gill slits in embryo. Important in lower vertebrates, site of
gills. Features derived from pharyngeal region: ﬁrst pharyngeal pouch gives rise to parts
of the ear, other pouches give rise to various other structures.
Alimentary canal: epithelium lines lumen, glands secrete into lumen, longitudinal and
circular muscles help digestive movements (peristalsis).
Esophagus: tube carries food from mouth to stomach. Expands to ﬁt large bolus (lump
of chewed food). Secretes mucus for lubrication. Birds have crop for storage, enlargement
of esophagus.
Epiglottis: keeps food out of air tube, an evolutionary “kludge,” or ﬁx.
Stomach. Absorbs water, alcohol, nutrients, uses gastric juice with enzymes, mucous, HCl,
released by chief and parietal cells (release protein enzymes) in gastric pits. Rugae: folds
of stomach, disappear when full. Sphincter at both ends of stomach, control food passage.
Chyme: semi-digested food released to small intestine.

147

Vertebrate digestive system

Small intestine: three regions, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
Duodenum site of most intestinal digestion. Jejunum and ileum do most of intestinal
absorption. Ileum ends with another sphincter, ileocolic valve or ileosecal valve. Structure:
Circular folds covered with villi (singular is villus).
Villi: ﬁnger-like cellular projections, covered with microvilli, tiny projections which increase
surface area. Increases surface area by 900x, speeds digestion (break down) and absorption
(taking in nutrients).
Large intestine: larger diameter, shorter length than small intestine. No villi. In mammals,
forms large gentle loop, colon, empties into straight region, rectum, empties into outside
world through anal sphincter. Colon: absorbs water left over, also absorbs vitamins released
by bacteria which live there (vitamin K).
Food: made up of 1. proteins, 2. fats, 3. carbohydrates 4. ﬁbrous material.
Digestive system breaks foods down. Proteins must be broken to amino acids to be
absorbed. Polysaccharides to monosaccharides, lipids to fatty acids and monoglyc-
erides to absorb.
Salivary glands in mouth, saliva contains mucous, salt and a few enzymes (amalase, begins
starch breakdown). Snake venom from oral gland, mixture of toxins and digestive enzymes.
Breaks down blood vessels and disables nervous system.
Stomach enzymes: released in inactive form, zymogene, converts to active form in lumen
of gut. Transformation is triggered by another enzyme, or the stomach’s low pH. Pepsin
secreted as pepsinogen (-ogen means primitive form). Stomach glands secrete up to two or
three liters a day of gastric juice, which is reabsorbed.
Chyme released to duodenum.
Small intestine has two major accessory glands: 1. pancreas 2. liver
Pancreas has endocrine and exocrine functions, releases large amounts of carbonate to
neutralize acidic chyme, as intestinal enzymes work in neutral pH, and stuﬀ to break down
lipids and starch (zymogens, like tripsin)
Liver releases bile. Bile made from cholesterol, stored in gall bladder, released in
duodenum, emulsiﬁes fats.
Emulsify: keeps fats in tiny drops, which are suspended, increasing surface area and action
of lipases. Protein and carbohydrates absorbed in intestine, taken to liver for processing.
Fatty acids go to lymphatic system
Appendix: vestigial remnant. Much variation in digestive systems within mammals:
herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, non-ruminant herbivore.
Rumen: four-chambered stomach of animals like cows (ruminant herbivores). Cellulose
resistant to digestion, rely on microorganisms to break down cellulose. Some bacteria,
protists and fungi can break down cellulose, almost no animals can. Bacteria break down
cellulose in rumen, to be taken back to the mouth to chew their cud (ruminate). Later cow
swallows to proceed with digestion. (Horses not like this).

148

Coprophagy: rabbits and other animals eat their own feces for the nutritious products of
the cecum.

Circulatory system functions
1. Transportation

a. Respiration: gas exchange (O2 and CO2), overcomes limited rate
of

diﬀusion

b. Nutrition:<br>
c. Excretory: (remove metabolic wastes)<br>

2. Regulation

a. Transport hormones<br>
b. Regulate body temperature<br>
c. Protection<br>

i. Blood clotting<br>
ii. Immune system (carries white blood cells)

Vasodilation: allows heat loss across epidermis, as seen in elephant ears, takes more blood
to surface of body, sweating may accompany
Countercurrent heat exchange: used by dolphins in ﬁns to conserve heat in cold water.
Veins surround an artery, and blood returning to body absorbs heat from blood traveling
out from body to ﬁn, minimizing heat loss. Used by dogs in feet, etc.
Blood made of 1. plasma and 2. formed cellular elements (red and white blood cells,
and platelets).
Plasma makes up 55% of blood volume. Cellular elements make up the other 45%.
Plasma makeup: 90% water, 7-8% soluble proteins (albumin maintains blood osmotic
integrity, others clot, etc.) 1% electrolytes 1% elements in transit
Red blood cell (erythrocyte): contains hemoglobin, functions in oxygen transport. In
mammals, red blood cells lose nuclei on maturation, and take on biconcave, dimpled, shape.
No self repair, live 120 days. About 1000x more red blood cells than white blood cells.
About 7-8 micrometers in diameter.

151

Circulatory system

Hematocrit: proportion of blood volume that is occupied by cells, about 43% in humans
on average. 48% for men and 38% for women.
White blood cells (leukocytes): Nucleated, about 10-14 micrometers in diameter, com-
monly amoeboid, escape circulatory system in capillary beds. Include basophils, eosinophils,
neutrophils, monocytes, B- and T-cell lymphocytes.
Platelets (thrombocytes) Membrane bound cell fragments in mammals, no nucleus. In
non-mammals, platelet role replaced by nucleated cells. Accumulate at site of broken blood
vessels, form clots. Bud oﬀ special cells in bone marrow. 1-2 micrometers in diameter. 7-8
day life span, 1/10 or 1/20 as abundant as white blood cells.
Arteries: carry blood away from heart. Smallest tubes called arterioles, feed blood to
capillaries.
Veins: return blood to heart. Smallest veins called venules.
Structure of arteries and veins, listed from inside (lumen) out: 1. epithelium (endothelium),
2. elastic connective tissue ﬁbers, 3. smooth muscle, 4. connective tissue. Arteries
have thicker elastic layer than do veins.
Capillaries, where exchange of materials occurs, are very thin and narrow, and red blood
cells pass through single ﬁle. Capillaries are tiny but numerous, and their total volume is
greater than that of supplying arteries.
Blood velocity drops in capillaries, picks back up in veins. Pressure highest in arteries, lower
in capillaries and arteries.
Osmotic pressure draws interstitial ﬂuid from blood in arterioles, but replaces it in venules.
One-way valves mean that blood can ﬂow only one way, works with residual blood pressure
and compression by skeletal muscles. Low pressure in thoracic cavity caused by breathing
also helps move blood.
Lymphatic system: part of the immune system, a one-way, or open, system. Takes up
interstitial ﬂuid not taken up by venules.
Lymphatic structures:

1. lymphatic capillaries

2. lymphatic vesicles

3. lymph nodes

4. lymphatic organs (spleen and thymus)
Lymph: movement in mammals through one-way valves, similar to blood movement in
veins. (Some non-mammals have lymphatic hearts of unknown embryonic origin. Frogs and
salamanders have several.) Lymph rejoins cardiovascular system into a large vein near the
heart via single large thoracic duct.

152

Subphylum Vertebrata

As lymph passes through system, passes lymphocytes, second part of immune system.
Heart: pumps blood, design varies between animals. In adult mammal,four chambers form
two separate circulations

1. pulmonary circulation to and from lungs and

2. systemic circulation to and from tissues of body.
Everything in the heart comes in pairs: 2 atria, 2 ventricles (left and right).
Diagrams usually drawn as though animal were on its back.
Pattern of blood ﬂow through heart: blood returning from major veins (vena cava)
enters right atrium, contraction there delivers blood to right ventricle through a tricuspid
valve, one of atrial ventricular valves (AV valve). Contraction of right ventricle drives blood
through semi lunar valve into pulmonary circuit and to lungs.Blood return to heart in
pulmonary veins, is oxygenated. Goes to left atrium, which contracts and delivers blood
to left ventricleby way of aortic semi-lunar valve, then goes to systemic circulation.
Both atria and ventricles contract in unison, left is more powerful than right (to all system
vs. just lungs).
Systole: heart contraction, diastole: heart relaxed
Timing of heart contraction: ventricles rebound to relaxed shape (diastole), and semi-
lunar valves close. Both atria(singular: atrium) ﬁll with blood coming from pulmonary
and systemic circulations.Pressure rises in the atria and blood begins to move into the
ventricles.The atria then contract, forcing more blood into the ventricles. There is a pause,
then ventricles contract. This raises ventricle pressure, atrio-ventricular(AV) valves
shut and semi-lunar valves open, forcing blood from the left ventricle into the major arteries
and from the right ventricle into the aorta.
Control for this action doesn’t rely on nervous stimulation, has intrinsic rhythmicity, called
myogenic. This is the case in mammal as well as in mollusk hearts. Other animals have
neurogenic hearts that rely on nervous stimulation for heart action, originating in the
cardiac ganglion.
The rhythmicity of mammalian heart relies on the sino-atrial (SA)node, or pacemaker.
This is a phylogenic (based on evolutionary history) remnant of an early vertebrate heart
that had one more chamber than modern hearts.
How the heart contracts: waves of depolarization start in SA node and spread
through atria. Connectile tissue pauses the spread of depolarization at the atrial ventricular
node. Signal continued by bundle branches to lower ventricle, begins to stimulate
heart to contract. Contraction starts at bottom of heart at heart apex,then signals spread
through heart.
Medulla (in the brain) controls autonomic nervous system.
(The medulla is part of
the brain, is continuous with the spinal cord, and controls involuntary actions of the
body). Sympathetic cardiac acceleratorconnects to spinal cord, uses norepinephrine
to signal. Parasympathetic cardio-inhibitory center reaches heart through Vagus

153

Circulatory system

nerve, usesacetylcholine to signal. Hyperpolarizes membrane to inhibit heart contraction.
(Autonomic nervous system: two parts working in contra to control from both sides.)
Dominant eﬀect here is inhibitory. If we cut Vagus nerve, heart rate promptly rises about
25 bpm.

154

31 Respiratory system

In humans and other animals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system
include airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles.
Other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features,
and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange.
Plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite
to that in animals. The respiratory system in plants also includes anatomical features such
as holes on the undersides of leaves known as stomata.
In mammals, the diaphragm divides the body cavity into the

abdominal cavity: contains the viscera (e.g., stomach and intestines)

thoracic cavity: contains the heart and lungs.

Respiratory tree: terminates in alveolus, alveoli. Respiratory bronchioles branch into
alveolar ducts and into alveoli. Alveolus: microscopic air sacs, 300 million of these in human
lungs. Total surface area large. Gas diﬀuses micrometer, very tiny distance.
Nervous System
Composed of tissues designed to integrate sensory information and direct a coordinated
response to the environment.
Basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron1, a highly specialized cell that uses both
electrical and chemical processes to communicate. Neurons "listen" to sensory organs or
other neurons, and can simultaneously "hear" from 1 to hundreds of inputs simultaneously.
Likewise, a neuron can "talk" to other neurons or cells that can create an action, like muscle
cells or glands.
Neurons are outnumbered in the nervous system by glia. Glia were once thought to only play
a supportive role in helping neurons survive; today we know that they also are important
participants in the communication process. Glial cells include astrocytes, ependymal cells,
and a cell that has a macrophage like function. There are also oligodendocytes and Schwann
cells that provide a myelin sheath.

31.1 Neuron structure

Figure 9 Neuron

• Dendrite will receive information from other axons
• Stoma is the neuron body and contains typical cell parts including the mitochondria and

nucleus. This is where neurotransmitters are synthesized.

• Axon hillock is where the cell body and the axon meet.
• Axon is surrounded by myelin.
• Contains nodes of Ranvier

Types of axons include unipolar, bipolar, pseudopolar.
Action potentials results from excitatory stimuli received from the dendrites that results
in a signal that travels down the axon. On the cellular level, there is a Na+ inﬂux via
channels causing a depolarization of the cell. Once those channels close, the slower opening
K+ channels will open resulting in hyperpolarization by the cell.
Synapses
Neurotransmitters allow a chemical signal to be sent from one neuron to the other. Neuro-
transmitters must bypass a physical gap called the synapse. Examples of neurotransmitters
include acetylcholine, epinephrine, and glutamate.
Example : Neuromuscular synapses

156

Central nervous system

Circuits / Nuclei / Ganglia

31.2 Central nervous system

Central nervous system includes the brain and the spinal cord.
Brain There are four lobes of the brain.
• Frontal lobe - decision making
• Parietal lobe
• Temporal lobe
• Occipital lobe - vision
The areas of the brain are also dedicated to diﬀerent functions.
• Precentral gyrus
• Postcentral gyrus
Protection The CNS is protected by three layers - the pia mater, the arachnoid mater, and
the dura mater. Protection also comes from the circulation of cerebral spinal ﬂuid (CSF).
CSF helps to ﬂoat the brain and also provide nutrients to both the brain and the spinal
cord. CSF is synthesized from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. In total, there are
four ventricles - 2 lateral ventricles, a 3rd, and 4th ventricle.

31.3 Peripheral nervous system

The peripheral nervous system is broken down into two sub-systems, the somatic nervous
system and the autonomic nervous system.
ANS - Autonomic Nervous System The ANS has two components - parasympathetic and
sympathetic.
The sympathetic nervous system is the "ﬁght or ﬂight" or fright response and results in an
increased heart rate, increased rate of breathing, and an elevated blood glucose level. There
is also decreased digestion. The second neurotransmitter is epinephrine. In this case, the
ﬁrst neuron is short and the second neuron is long.
The parasympathetic nervous system is the rest and digest system.
Drugs must be able to pass the blood brain barrier to have an eﬀect on the CNS. Drugs act
by aﬀecting the neuron and how likely it is to ﬁre an action potential.
Stroke occurs when there is a blood clot that goes to the brain and prevent blood ﬂow.

157

32 Sensory systems

Categorized by

1. nature of stimulus, such as mechanical, chemicalor light stimulus, and

2. where stimulus received, such as outside (exteroceptors,such as the eye and
skin temp receptors) or insidebody (interoceptors, such as blood body tem-
perature receptors).

Transduction of sensory input into signal. Means to “carry across”,signal transduced, or
carried, from environment into nervous signal.
Three sensory processes we cover

1. taste and smell (chemoreception)

2. gravity and movement

3. light

32.1 Taste and smell (chemoreception)

Found in mammal nose and mouth, ﬂy feet, ﬁsh bodies, moth antennae.
Papilla: bumps on tongue, contain taste buds down between. Sweet, sour, salty and bitter.
Some act directly by ion channels, others act indirectly. Other “taste” sensations really
smell.
Smell: received in nasopharynx. Airborne molecules go into solution on moist epithelial
surface of nasal passage. Approximately 1000 genescode for sensory neuron receptors. “Fried
onions” odor not one receptor but a mixture of many odors registered in our mind as one.
Very sensitive, habituates rapidly (don’t notice a smell after a bit). Odor sensation has
relatively unﬁltered root to higher brain centers.
Snakes more chemosensory focused than us.

32.2 Response to gravity and movement

Registered in inner ear. Three semicircular canals loop in three planes at right angles
to each other, responsible for transduction of movement messages. Method: hair cells

159

Sensory systems

deformed by gelatinous membrane. Vestibular apparatus, gives us perception of gravity
and movement. Due to physical response, not chemical binding.
Cochlea: bony, coil shaped part of inner ear, where hearing occurs.
Sound enters through auditory canal, vibrates tympanic membrane,moving three bones
of middle ear (malleus, incus, and stapes)against oval window opening in front of cochlea.
Cochlea has three ﬂuid ﬁlled ducts, one of these the organ of Corti. Sound waves in air
go to vibration in organ of Corti; ﬂuid tickles hair cells, which register the movement
along basilar membrane in cochlea. Diﬀerent sound frequencies move diﬀerent portions
of basilar membrane. Hearing loss due to loss of hair cells.Humans normally smell more
than 300 odors in a day(Facts and Truth).
Transduction of sound accomplished throgh physical deformation,not chemical binding.

32.3 Vision

Light enters pupil, focused by lensonto retina.
Sclera: hardened part behind retina.
Optic nerves and neurons attached to retina. Blind spot where optic nerve attaches, has
no receptors.
Two types of photoreceptors

1. rods - black and white low-light vision, 100 million in each retina in humans.

2. cones - color vision, work best under better illumination. 3 million in each retina.

Fovia: region of most acute vision, has most of the cones, few rods.
Transduction process of light to signal a molecular change, to light absorbing molecule
called photopigment. Located in outer parts of rods and cones in pigment discs. The rod
photopigment is called rhodopsin,cone has three photopigments, called photopsins. This
molecular change initiates pathways to result in action potential in downstream neuron
leading to vision center in brain.Parul Godika
Each of the three photopsins has a diﬀerent peak of sensitivity: blue,green or red, and
changes isometric form (from cisto trans) based on light from a particular wavelength
range. Color blindness:inherited lack of one or more types of these cones. Gene carried on X
chromosome, therefore more common in men than women.

32.4 Homeostasis

Is a very important part of everyones and everythings lives. Deﬁned as dynamic con-
stancy of internal environment, maintenance of a relatively stable environment inside
an organism usually involving feedback regulation.

160

Osmotic environments and regulations

Homeostasis is maintained in face of

1. a varying external environment, or
2. a non-ideal, constant external environment (as with the penguin).

Deals with temperature, pH, chemical concentrations,pressure, oxygen levels.
Occurs through negative feedback loops.
Various forms: simple thermostat in house turns oﬀ heater when above a certain temperature
and on when below a certain temperature Involves stimulus, sensor,integrating center,
eﬀector and response.
More eﬃcient control has two sensors and two eﬀectors. Can be antagonistic to each
other, such as, one cools, the other heats.
Precise control through proportional control, not all-or-none, furnace comes on a little
bit if the house a bit cold. Examples in humans: vasoconstriction, change in metabolic rate,
shivering. Physiological responses for high body temp: blood goes to body surface, sweating,
behavioral changes (get out of sun).
Positive feedback loop: eﬀector increases deviation from set point. Ampliﬁes reaction.
Like blood clotting process, uterine contraction during childbirth. Negative feedback must
exist at some point for control.

32.5 Osmotic environments and regulations

1. Marine invertebrates

a) fully marine invertebrates (not intertidal or estuarine) osmoconformers (set
internal environment same as environment, no net ﬂow of ions) in a stenohaline
(narrow non-changing salt level) environment

b) Coastal, intertidal, estuarine (ion levels ﬂuctuate) invertebrates.Partly osmo-
confomers, partly osmoregulators in a euryhaline (wide salt level variation)
environment (ex: shore crab, regulates sometimes when salt levels in environment
get real low).

2. Freshwater animals. Here, environment has lower solute concentrations than do

living organisms so water tends to ﬂow in and solutes out.

a) Freshwater ﬁsh (bony) dilute urine, and gills actively take up ions (NaCl)
b) Freshwater invertebrates: same situation as freshwater ﬁsh but with diﬀerent

structures

c) Freshwater amphibians: active uptake of salts across their skin

3. Marine ﬁshes: Here the environment has a higher solute concentration than does

the organism so water tends to ﬂow out and ions in.

a) Bony ﬁshes: actively secrete salts (NaCl) across gills, absorb water across gut
wall, their kidney (unlike mammalian kidney) is unable to generate concentrated
urine so glomerulus is reduced, active tubular secretion of MgSO4

b) cartilaginous ﬁshes (and coelacanth): blood retains urea and trimethylamineoxide

to increase its osmolality to that of seawater

161

Sensory systems

4. Terrestrial animals: here problem is loss of water to a drier environment, and

regulation of salt levels.

a) water loss adaptations
b) concentrated exception of salts and nitrogenous wastes

Hypoosmotic: having less osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Hyperosmotic: having more osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Isoosmotic: having equal osmotic potential than nearby ﬂuid
Glomerulus: reduces volume of kidney
Fish started in salt water, spread to fresh water, later reinvaded salt-water environment.
Terrestrial animal water sources:

1. drinking

2. moist foods

3. from breakdown of metabolic molecules like fats. (Desert kangaroo rats get 90% of their
water from metabolism.)
Secretion of nitrogenous wastes: from metabolism of amino acids, amino group has to be
removed in one of three basically interchangeable chemical forms:

1. ammonia (aquatic life)

2. urea (mammals)

3. uric acid (birds)
Ammonia very toxic, soluble, and cheap to produce. Easy to expel for bony ﬁshes.
Urea: low toxicity, good solubility, more costly to lose as it contains other groups on it.
Must be released in solution, water cost.
Uric acid (white part of bird poo) low toxicity, insoluble, secreted with little water loss,
more costly side groups lost than the others.
Mammalian kidney: Structure: ﬁst-sized organ in lower back. About 1/5 of blood from
aorta at any time is passing through kidneys. Blood passes through kidney many times a
day.
Nephron: structural and functional unit of kidney.
Bowmans capsule: funnel-like opening, contains primary ﬁlter, the glomerulus.
Proximal convoluted tubule: receives stuﬀ from Bowmans capsule.
Loop of Henle: descends and ascends.

162

Osmotic environments and regulations

Vasa recta: capillaries that surround the Loop of Henle.
Glomerulus: main ﬁlter of the nephron, located within the Bowmans capsule
Kidney properties and processes important to its function
1. Active transport of solutes from one ﬂuid to another against a concentration gradient,
Na+ actively transported out of ﬁltrate by cells of the thick ascending loop of Henley into
the interstitial ﬂuid

2. Passive movement of solutes and water from one ﬂuid to another(down a concen-
tration gradient), movement of water and NaCl out of descending loop of Henley into
interstitial ﬂuid.

3. Diﬀerential permeability of cells in diﬀerent regions of the nephron to movement
of water and solutes, ascending thick look is impermeable to water, descending portion is
permeable to water

4. Hormonal control of that permeability, antidiuretic hormone(ADH) increases
permeability of collecting due to water, resulting in reduced volume of ﬁltrate and thus
more concentrated urine.

5. Increasing solute concentration in the interstitial ﬂuid of the kidney, from the
cortex to the deepest medulla, maintained by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism

36 Licenses

36.1 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verba-
tim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed. Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft
license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practi-
cal works are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change the works. By contrast, the
GNU General Public License is intended to guaran-
tee your freedom to share and change all versions
of a program–to make sure it remains free software
for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our
software; it applies also to any other work released
this way by its authors. You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring
to freedom, not price. Our General Public Li-
censes are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software
(and charge for them if you wish), that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these
things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others
from denying you these rights or asking you to sur-
render the rights. Therefore, you have certain re-
sponsibilities if you distribute copies of the soft-
ware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect
the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a pro-
gram, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass
on to the recipients the same freedoms that you re-
ceived. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show
them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your
rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the
software, and (2) oﬀer you this License giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
it.

For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the
GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for
this free software. For both users’ and authors’
sake, the GPL requires that modiﬁed versions be
marked as changed, so that their problems will not
be attributed erroneously to authors of previous
versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to
install or run modiﬁed versions of the software in-
side them, although the manufacturer can do so.
This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim
of protecting users’ freedom to change the software.
The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the
area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore,
we have designed this version of the GPL to pro-
hibit the practice for those products. If such prob-
lems arise substantially in other domains, we stand
ready to extend this provision to those domains in
future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect
the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by
software patents. States should not allow patents
to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do,
we wish to avoid the special danger that patents
applied to a free program could make it eﬀectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-
free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, dis-
tribution and modiﬁcation follow. TERMS AND
CONDITIONS 0. Deﬁnitions.

“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Gen-
eral Public License.

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that ap-
ply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor
masks.

“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work
licensed under this License. Each licensee is ad-
dressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may
be individuals or organizations.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt
all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copy-
right permission, other than the making of an exact
copy. The resulting work is called a “modiﬁed ver-
sion” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the
earlier work.

A “covered work” means either the unmodiﬁed Pro-
gram or a work based on the Program.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it
that, without permission, would make you directly
or secondarily liable for infringement under appli-
cable copyright law, except executing it on a com-
puter or modifying a private copy. Propagation in-
cludes copying, distribution (with or without mod-
iﬁcation), making available to the public, and in
some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation
that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
Mere interaction with a user through a computer

network, with no transfer of a copy, is not convey-
ing.

An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate
Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a con-
venient and prominently visible feature that (1) dis-
plays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells
the user that there is no warranty for the work (ex-
cept to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this Li-
cense, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or
options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the
list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code.

The “source code” for a work means the preferred
form of the work for making modiﬁcations to it.
“Object code” means any non-source form of a
work.

A “Standard Interface” means an interface that ei-
ther is an oﬃcial standard deﬁned by a recognized
standards body, or, in the case of interfaces spec-
iﬁed for a particular programming language, one
that is widely used among developers working in
that language.

The “System Libraries” of an executable work in-
clude anything, other than the work as a whole,
that (a) is included in the normal form of packag-
ing a Major Component, but which is not part of
that Major Component, and (b) serves only to en-
able use of the work with that Major Component,
or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source
code form. A “Major Component”, in this context,
means a major essential component (kernel, window
system, and so on) of the speciﬁc operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
compiler used to produce the work, or an object
code interpreter used to run it.

The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object
code form means all the source code needed to gen-
erate,
install, and (for an executable work) run
the object code and to modify the work, including
scripts to control those activities. However, it does
not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-
purpose tools or generally available free programs
which are used unmodiﬁed in performing those ac-
tivities but which are not part of the work. For
example, Corresponding Source includes interface
deﬁnition ﬁles associated with source ﬁles for the
work, and the source code for shared libraries and
dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
speciﬁcally designed to require, such as by intimate
data communication or control ﬂow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include any-
thing that users can regenerate automatically from
other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code
form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted
for the term of copyright on the Program, and are
irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly aﬃrms your unlimited per-
mission to run the unmodiﬁed Program. The out-
put from running a covered work is covered by this
License only if the output, given its content, con-
stitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges
your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as pro-
vided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works
that you do not convey, without conditions so long
as your license otherwise remains in force. You may
convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modiﬁcations exclusively for
you, or provide you with facilities for running those
works, provided that you comply with the terms
of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or
running the covered works for you must do so exclu-
sively on your behalf, under your direction and con-
trol, on terms that prohibit them from making any
copies of your copyrighted material outside their
relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permit-
ted solely under the conditions stated below. Subli-
censing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unneces-
sary. 3. Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-
Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an eﬀec-
tive technological measure under any applicable law
fulﬁlling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumven-
tion of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any
legal power to forbid circumvention of technologi-
cal measures to the extent such circumvention is ef-
fected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any
intention to limit operation or modiﬁcation of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s
users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures. 4. Con-
veying Verbatim Copies.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy
that you convey, and you may oﬀer support or war-
ranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modiﬁed
Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or
the modiﬁcations to produce it from the Program,
in the form of source code under the terms of sec-
tion 4, provided that you also meet all of these con-
ditions:

* a) The work must carry prominent notices stating
that you modiﬁed it, and giving a relevant date. *
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating
that it is released under this License and any con-
ditions added under section 7. This requirement
modiﬁes the requirement in section 4 to “keep in-
tact all notices”. * c) You must license the entire
work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who
comes into possession of a copy. This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This
License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such per-
mission if you have separately received it. * d) If
the work has interactive user interfaces, each must
display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the
Program has interactive interfaces that do not dis-
play Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not
make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other sepa-
rate and independent works, which are not by their
nature extensions of the covered work, and which
are not combined with it such as to form a larger
program, in or on a volume of a storage or distri-
bution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the com-
pilation and its resulting copyright are not used to
limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s
users beyond what the individual works permit. In-
clusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not
cause this License to apply to the other parts of the
aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form
under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that
you also convey the machine-readable Correspond-
ing Source under the terms of this License, in one
of these ways:

* a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in,
a physical product (including a physical distribu-
tion medium), accompanied by the Corresponding
Source ﬁxed on a durable physical medium custom-
arily used for software interchange. * b) Convey the
object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accom-
panied by a written oﬀer, valid for at least three
years and valid for as long as you oﬀer spare parts
or customer support for that product model, to
give anyone who possesses the object code either
(1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
software in the product that is covered by this Li-
cense, on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange, for a price no more
than your reasonable cost of physically performing
this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no
charge. * c) Convey individual copies of the object
code with a copy of the written oﬀer to provide
the Corresponding Source. This alternative is al-
lowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an of-
fer, in accord with subsection 6b. * d) Convey the
object code by oﬀering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and oﬀer equivalent
access to the Corresponding Source in the same way
through the same place at no further charge. You
need not require recipients to copy the Correspond-
ing Source along with the object code. If the place
to copy the object code is a network server, the Cor-
responding Source may be on a diﬀerent server (op-
erated by you or a third party) that supports equiv-
alent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
directions next to the object code saying where to
ﬁnd the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what
server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long
as needed to satisfy these requirements. * e) Con-
vey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
provided you inform other peers where the object
code and Corresponding Source of the work are be-
ing oﬀered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose
source code is excluded from the Corresponding
Source as a System Library, need not be included
in conveying the object code work.

A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer prod-
uct”, which means any tangible personal property
which is normally used for personal,
family, or
household purposes, or (2) anything designed or
sold for incorporation into a dwelling.
In deter-
mining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of cover-
age. For a particular product received by a par-
ticular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or
common use of that class of product, regardless of
the status of the particular user or of the way in
which the particular user actually uses, or expects
or is expected to use, the product. A product is a
consumer product regardless of whether the prod-
uct has substantial commercial, industrial or non-
consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
signiﬁcant mode of use of the product.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s
source code as you receive it, in any medium, pro-
vided that you conspicuously and appropriately
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright no-
tice; keep intact all notices stating that this License
and any non-permissive terms added in accord with
section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices
of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipi-
ents a copy of this License along with the Program.

“Installation Information” for a User Product
means any methods, procedures, authorization
keys, or other information required to install and
execute modiﬁed versions of a covered work in that
User Product from a modiﬁed version of its Corre-
sponding Source. The information must suﬃce to
ensure that the continued functioning of the modi-
ﬁed object code is in no case prevented or interfered
with solely because modiﬁcation has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this sec-
tion in, or with, or speciﬁcally for use in, a User
Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and
use of the User Product is transferred to the re-
cipient in perpetuity or for a ﬁxed term (regard-
less of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section
must be accompanied by the Installation Informa-
tion. But this requirement does not apply if neither
you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modiﬁed object code on the User Product (for ex-
ample, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Informa-
tion does not include a requirement to continue to
provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modiﬁed or installed by the re-
cipient, or for the User Product in which it has been
modiﬁed or installed. Access to a network may be
denied when the modiﬁcation itself materially and
adversely aﬀects the operation of the network or
violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation
Information provided, in accord with this section
must be in a format that is publicly documented
(and with an implementation available to the public
in source code form), and must require no special
password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
7. Additional Terms.

“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement
the terms of this License by making exceptions from
one or more of its conditions. Additional permis-
sions that are applicable to the entire Program
shall be treated as though they were included in
this License, to the extent that they are valid un-
der applicable law. If additional permissions apply
only to part of the Program, that part may be used
separately under those permissions, but the entire
Program remains governed by this License without
regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may
at your option remove any additional permissions
from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own re-
moval in certain cases when you modify the work.)
You may place additional permissions on material,
added by you to a covered work, for which you have
or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Li-
cense, for material you add to a covered work, you
may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that
material) supplement the terms of this License with
terms:

* a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability dif-
ferently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this
License; or * b) Requiring preservation of speciﬁed
reasonable legal notices or author attributions in
that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or * c) Prohibit-
ing misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
or requiring that modiﬁed versions of such material
be marked in reasonable ways as diﬀerent from the
original version; or * d) Limiting the use for pub-
licity purposes of names of licensors or authors of
the material; or * e) Declining to grant rights under
trademark law for use of some trade names, trade-
marks, or service marks; or * f) Requiring indem-
niﬁcation of licensors and authors of that material
by anyone who conveys the material (or modiﬁed
versions of it) with contractual assumptions of lia-
bility to the recipient, for any liability that these
contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are con-
sidered “further restrictions” within the meaning of
section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is gov-
erned by this License along with a term that is a
further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
license document contains a further restriction but
permits relicensing or conveying under this License,
you may add to a covered work material governed
by the terms of that license document, provided
that the further restriction does not survive such
relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with
this section, you must place, in the relevant source
ﬁles, a statement of the additional terms that ap-
ply to those ﬁles, or a notice indicating where to
ﬁnd the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive,
may be stated in the form of a separately written
license, or stated as exceptions; the above require-
ments apply either way. 8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work
except as expressly provided under this License.
Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License (including any patent licenses
granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and ﬁnally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessa-
tion.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
holder notiﬁes you of the violation by some reason-
able means, this is the ﬁrst time you have received
notice of violation of this License (for any work)

from that copyright holder, and you cure the vi-
olation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have re-
ceived copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not perma-
nently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new
licenses for the same material under section 10. 9.
Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in or-
der to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancil-
lary propagation of a covered work occurring solely
as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require accep-
tance. However, nothing other than this License
grants you permission to propagate or modify any
covered work. These actions infringe copyright if
you do not accept this License. Therefore, by mod-
ifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Auto-
matic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
automatically receives a license from the original
licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
License.

An “entity transaction” is a transaction transfer-
ring control of an organization, or substantially all
assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or
merging organizations.
If propagation of a cov-
ered work results from an entity transaction, each
party to that transaction who receives a copy of the
work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
party’s predecessor in interest had or could give un-
der the previous paragraph, plus a right to posses-
sion of the Corresponding Source of the work from
the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it
or can get it with reasonable eﬀorts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the
exercise of the rights granted or aﬃrmed under this
License. For example, you may not impose a license
fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not ini-
tiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counter-
claim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim
is infringed by making, using, selling, oﬀering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
11. Patents.

A “contributor” is a copyright holder who autho-
rizes use under this License of the Program or a
work on which the Program is based. The work
thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contribu-
tor version”.

A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all
patent claims owned or controlled by the contribu-
tor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permit-
ted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
contributor version, but do not include claims that
would be infringed only as a consequence of further
modiﬁcation of the contributor version. For pur-
poses of this deﬁnition, “control” includes the right
to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent
with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, world-
wide, royalty-free patent license under the contrib-
utor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, of-
fer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a “patent li-
cense” is any express agreement or commitment,
however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such
as an express permission to practice a patent or
covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
“grant” such a patent license to a party means to
make such an agreement or commitment not to en-
force a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying
on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source
of the work is not available for anyone to copy,
free of charge and under the terms of this License,
through a publicly available network server or other
readily accessible means, then you must either (1)
cause the Corresponding Source to be so available,
or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the beneﬁt
of the patent license for this particular work, or
(3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the re-
quirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly re-
lying” means you have actual knowledge that, but
for the patent license, your conveying the covered
work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the cov-
ered work in a country, would infringe one or more
identiﬁable patents in that country that you have
reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single trans-
action or arrangement, you convey, or propagate
by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and
grant a patent license to some of the parties re-
ceiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
propagate, modify or convey a speciﬁc copy of the
covered work, then the patent license you grant is
automatically extended to all recipients of the cov-
ered work and works based on it.

A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not in-
clude within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the
exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise
of one or more of the rights that are speciﬁcally
granted under this License. You may not convey a
covered work if you are a party to an arrangement
with a third party that is in the business of dis-
tributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your ac-
tivity of conveying the work, and under which the
third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discrimina-
tory patent license (a) in connection with copies
of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with speciﬁc products or compilations
that contain the covered work, unless you entered
into that arrangement, or that patent license was
granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as ex-
cluding or limiting any implied license or other de-
fenses to infringement that may otherwise be avail-
able to you under applicable patent law. 12. No
Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you
from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultane-
ously your obligations under this License and any
other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
you may not convey it at all. For example, if you
agree to terms that obligate you to collect a roy-
alty for further conveying from those to whom you
convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy
both those terms and this License would be to re-
frain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use
with the GNU Aﬀero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Li-
cense, you have permission to link or combine any
covered work with a work licensed under version
3 of the GNU Aﬀero General Public License into
a single combined work, and to convey the result-
ing work. The terms of this License will continue
to apply to the part which is the covered work, but
the special requirements of the GNU Aﬀero General
Public License, section 13, concerning interaction
through a network will apply to the combination
as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the GNU General Public Li-
cense from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may dif-
fer in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version num-
ber. If the Program speciﬁes that a certain num-
bered version of the GNU General Public License
“or any later version” applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either
of that numbered version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foun-
dation.

If the Program speciﬁes that a proxy can decide
which future versions of the GNU General Public
License can be used, that proxy’s public statement
of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes
you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or
diﬀerent permissions. However, no additional obli-
gations are imposed on any author or copyright
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later
version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PRO-
GRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY AP-
PLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLD-
ERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IM-
PLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFEC-
TIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECES-
SARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLI-
CABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY
OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CON-
VEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE,
BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
IN-
CLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDEN-
TAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIM-
ITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING REN-
DERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE
OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. In-
terpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of lia-
bility provided above cannot be given local legal ef-

fect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
apply local law that most closely approximates an
absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection
with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption
of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in
return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Ap-
ply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to
be of the greatest possible use to the public, the
best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under
these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the pro-
gram.
It is safest to attach them to the start of
each source ﬁle to most eﬀectively state the exclu-
sion of warranty; and each ﬁle should have at least
the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.

<one line to give the program’s name and a brief
idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year>
<name of author>

This program is free software: you can redistribute
it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation, either version 3 of the Li-
cense, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that
it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WAR-
RANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PAR-
TICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public
License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Gen-
eral Public License along with this program. If not,
see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by elec-
tronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it
output a short notice like this when it starts in an
interactive mode:

<program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of au-
thor> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY
NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’. This is
free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details.

The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’
should show the appropriate parts of the General
Public License. Of course, your program’s com-
mands might be diﬀerent; for a GUI interface, you
would use an “about box”.

You should also get your employer (if you work
if any, to sign a
as a programmer) or school,
“copyright disclaimer” for the program,
if nec-
essary.
For more information on this, and
how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit
incorporating your program into proprietary pro-
grams. If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking pro-
prietary applications with the library.
If this is
what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License. But ﬁrst,
please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-
not-lgpl.html>.

36.2 GNU Free Documentation License

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Soft-
ware Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verba-
tim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed. 0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual,
textbook, or other functional and useful document
"free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the eﬀective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially
or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License pre-
serves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered
responsible for modiﬁcations made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means
that derivative works of the document must them-
selves be free in the same sense.
It complements
the GNU General Public License, which is a copy-
left license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it
for manuals for free software, because free software
needs free documentation: a free program should
come with manuals providing the same freedoms
that the software does. But this License is not lim-
ited to software manuals; it can be used for any tex-
tual work, regardless of subject matter or whether
it is published as a printed book. We recommend
this License principally for works whose purpose is
instruction or reference. 1. APPLICABILITY AND
DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work,
in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in dura-
tion, to use that work under the conditions stated
herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such
manual or work. Any member of the public is a li-
censee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the
license if you copy, modify or distribute the work
in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A "Modiﬁed Version" of the Document means any
work containing the Document or a portion of it, ei-
ther copied verbatim, or with modiﬁcations and/or
translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a
front-matter section of the Document that deals ex-
clusively with the relationship of the publishers or

authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains noth-
ing that could fall directly within that overall sub-
ject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook
of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not ex-
plain any mathematics.) The relationship could be
a matter of historical connection with the subject
or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
philosophical, ethical or political position regard-
ing them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sec-
tions whose titles are designated, as being those of
Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License. If a sec-
tion does not ﬁt the above deﬁnition of Secondary
then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text
that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover
Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is
released under this License. A Front-Cover Text
may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text
may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
machine-readable copy, represented in a format
whose speciﬁcation is available to the general pub-
lic, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
or (for drawings) some widely available drawing ed-
itor, and that is suitable for input to text format-
ters or for automatic translation to a variety of for-
mats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy
made in an otherwise Transparent ﬁle format whose
markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged
to thwart or discourage subsequent modiﬁcation by
readers is not Transparent. An image format is not
Transparent if used for any substantial amount of
text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
"Opaque".

suitable formats

Examples of
for Transparent
copies include plain ASCII without markup, Tex-
info input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-
conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF de-
signed for human modiﬁcation. Examples of trans-
parent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
can be read and edited only by proprietary word
processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD
and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or

PDF produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the
title page itself, plus such following pages as are
needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page. For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such,
"Title Page" means the text near the most promi-
nent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the
beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that
distributes copies of the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit
of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ
or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that
translates XYZ in another language.
(Here XYZ
stands for a speciﬁc section name mentioned below,
such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "En-
dorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document
means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" ac-
cording to this deﬁnition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers
next to the notice which states that this License
applies to the Document. These Warranty Dis-
claimers are considered to be included by reference
in this License, but only as regards disclaiming war-
ranties: any other implication that these Warranty
Disclaimers may have is void and has no eﬀect on
the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPY-
ING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any
medium, either commercially or noncommercially,
provided that this License, the copyright notices,
and the license notice saying this License applies to
the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
you add no other conditions whatsoever to those
of this License. You may not use technical mea-
sures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute. How-
ever, you may accept compensation in exchange for
copies. If you distribute a large enough number of
copies you must also follow the conditions in sec-
tion 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same condi-
tions stated above, and you may publicly display
copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media
that commonly have printed covers) of the Doc-
ument, numbering more than 100, and the Doc-
ument’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you

must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly
and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover
Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
copies. The front cover must present the full title
with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible. You may add other material on the covers
in addition. Copying with changes limited to the
covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Doc-
ument and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too volu-
minous to ﬁt legibly, you should put the ﬁrst ones
listed (as many as ﬁt reasonably) on the actual
cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the
Document numbering more than 100, you must ei-
ther include a machine-readable Transparent copy
along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
each Opaque copy a computer-network location
from which the general network-using public has
access to download using public-standard network
protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Doc-
ument, free of added material. If you use the lat-
ter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
remain thus accessible at the stated location until
at least one year after the last time you distribute
an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you con-
tact the authors of the Document well before redis-
tributing any large number of copies, to give them
a chance to provide you with an updated version of
the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modiﬁed Version of
the Document under the conditions of sections 2
and 3 above, provided that you release the Modi-
ﬁed Version under precisely this License, with the
Modiﬁed Version ﬁlling the role of the Document,
thus licensing distribution and modiﬁcation of the
Modiﬁed Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
In addition, you must do these things in the Modi-
ﬁed Version:

* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if
any) a title distinct from that of the Document,
and from those of previous versions (which should,
if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document). You may use the same title as
a previous version if the original publisher of that
version gives permission. * B. List on the Title

Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modiﬁcations in
the Modiﬁed Version, together with at least ﬁve of
the principal authors of the Document (all of its
principal authors, if it has fewer than ﬁve), unless
they release you from this requirement. * C. State
on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modiﬁed Version, as the publisher. * D. Preserve
all the copyright notices of the Document. * E. Add
an appropriate copyright notice for your modiﬁca-
tions adjacent to the other copyright notices. * F.
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a
license notice giving the public permission to use
the Modiﬁed Version under the terms of this Li-
cense, in the form shown in the Addendum below. *
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of In-
variant Sections and required Cover Texts given in
the Document’s license notice. * H. Include an unal-
tered copy of this License. * I. Preserve the section
Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it
an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
and publisher of the Modiﬁed Version as given on
the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "His-
tory" in the Document, create one stating the title,
year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describ-
ing the Modiﬁed Version as stated in the previous
sentence. * J. Preserve the network location, if any,
given in the Document for public access to a Trans-
parent copy of the Document, and likewise the net-
work locations given in the Document for previous
versions it was based on. These may be placed in
the "History" section. You may omit a network lo-
cation for a work that was published at least four
years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
* K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements"
or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section,
and preserve in the section all the substance and
tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein. * L. Preserve all
the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or
the equivalent are not considered part of the section
titles. * M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorse-
ments". Such a section may not be included in the
Modiﬁed Version. * N. Do not retitle any existing
section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conﬂict
in title with any Invariant Section. * O. Preserve
any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modiﬁed Version includes new front-matter
sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary
Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some
or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add
their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
Modiﬁed Version’s license notice. These titles must
be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements",
provided it contains nothing but endorsements of
your Modiﬁed Version by various parties—for ex-
ample, statements of peer review or that the text
has been approved by an organization as the au-
thoritative deﬁnition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to ﬁve words as a
Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words
as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover
Texts in the Modiﬁed Version. Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may
be added by (or through arrangements made by)
any one entity. If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added
by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
you are acting on behalf of, you may not add an-

other; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added
the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do
not by this License give permission to use their
names for publicity for or to assert or imply en-
dorsement of any Modiﬁed Version. 5. COMBIN-
ING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other docu-
ments released under this License, under the terms
deﬁned in section 4 above for modiﬁed versions,
provided that you include in the combination all
of the Invariant Sections of all of the original doc-
uments, unmodiﬁed, and list them all as Invariant
Sections of your combined work in its license no-
tice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Dis-
claimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of
this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sec-
tions may be replaced with a single copy. If there
are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
but diﬀerent contents, make the title of each such
section unique by adding at the end of it, in paren-
theses, the name of the original author or publisher
of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice
of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections
Entitled "History" in the various original docu-
ments, forming one section Entitled "History"; like-
wise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledge-
ments", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".
You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorse-
ments". 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Docu-
ment and other documents released under this Li-
cense, and replace the individual copies of this Li-
cense in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you
follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying
of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a col-
lection, and distribute it individually under this Li-
cense, provided you insert a copy of this License
into the extracted document, and follow this Li-
cense in all other respects regarding verbatim copy-
ing of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH
INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives
with other separate and independent documents or
works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright re-
sulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what
the individual works permit. When the Document
is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are
not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is appli-
cable to these copies of the Document, then if the
Document is less than one half of the entire aggre-
gate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
on covers that bracket the Document within the
aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers
if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
they must appear on printed covers that bracket
the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modiﬁcation, so
you may distribute translations of the Document
under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant
Sections with translations requires special permis-
sion from their copyright holders, but you may in-
clude translations of some or all Invariant Sections
in addition to the original versions of these Invari-
ant Sections. You may include a translation of this
License, and all the license notices in the Document,
and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you
also include the original English version of this Li-
cense and the original versions of those notices and
disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original version of this License
or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowl-
edgements", "Dedications", or "History", the re-
quirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section
1) will typically require changing the actual title.
9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute
the Document except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, mod-
ify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this Li-
cense.

However, if you cease all violation of this License,
then your license from a particular copyright holder
is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and ﬁnally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessa-
tion.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright
holder notiﬁes you of the violation by some reason-
able means, this is the ﬁrst time you have received
notice of violation of this License (for any work)
from that copyright holder, and you cure the vi-
olation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does
not terminate the licenses of parties who have re-
ceived copies or rights from you under this License.
If your rights have been terminated and not perma-
nently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all
of the same material does not give you any rights
to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LI-
CENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, re-
vised versions of the GNU Free Documentation Li-
cense from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may dif-
fer in detail to address new problems or concerns.
See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguish-
ing version number. If the Document speciﬁes that
a particular numbered version of this License "or
any later version" applies to it, you have the op-
tion of following the terms and conditions either of
that speciﬁed version or of any later version that
has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Soft-
ware Foundation. If the Document does not specify
a version number of this License, you may choose
any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Document speci-
ﬁes that a proxy can decide which future versions of

this License can be used, that proxy’s public state-
ment of acceptance of a version permanently autho-
rizes you to choose that version for the Document.
11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site"
(or
"MMC Site") means any World Wide Web server
that publishes copyrightable works and also pro-
vides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is
an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiau-
thor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus pub-
lished on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means
the Creative Commons
Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by
Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-proﬁt
corporation with a principal place of business in
San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft
versions of that license published by that same
organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Doc-
ument, in whole or in part, as part of another Doc-
ument.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed
under this License, and if all works that were ﬁrst
published under this License somewhere other than
this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or
invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated
prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an
MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the
same site at any time before August 1, 2009, pro-
vided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDEN-
DUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written,
include a copy of the License in the document and
put the following copyright and license notices just
after the title page:

Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is
granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this doc-
ument under the terms of the GNU Free Documen-
tation License, Version 1.3 or any later version pub-
lished by the Free Software Foundation; with no
Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included
in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts
and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with . . .
Texts." line with this:

with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TI-
TLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and
with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts,
or some other combination of the three, merge
those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of
program code, we recommend releasing these exam-
ples in parallel under your choice of free software
license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

36.3 GNU Lesser General Public License

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verba-
tim copies of this license document, but changing
it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public Li-
cense incorporates the terms and conditions of ver-
sion 3 of the GNU General Public License, supple-
mented by the additional permissions listed below.
0. Additional Deﬁnitions.

As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3
of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
“GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.

“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by
this License, other than an Application or a Com-
bined Work as deﬁned below.

An “Application” is any work that makes use of an
interface provided by the Library, but which is not
otherwise based on the Library. Deﬁning a subclass
of a class deﬁned by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

A “Combined Work” is a work produced by com-
bining or linking an Application with the Library.
The particular version of the Library with which
the Combined Work was made is also called the
“Linked Version”.

The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Com-
bined Work means the Corresponding Source for
the Combined Work, excluding any source code for
portions of the Combined Work that, considered in
isolation, are based on the Application, and not on
the Linked Version.

The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Com-
bined Work means the object code and/or source
code for the Application, including any data and
utility programs needed for reproducing the Com-
bined Work from the Application, but excluding the
System Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Excep-
tion to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3
and 4 of this License without being bound by sec-
tion 3 of the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modiﬁed
Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
modiﬁcations, a facility refers to a function or data
to be supplied by an Application that uses the fa-
cility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of
the modiﬁed version:

* a) under this License, provided that you make a
good faith eﬀort to ensure that, in the event an Ap-
plication does not supply the function or data, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part
of its purpose remains meaningful, or * b) under
the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permis-
sions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Li-
brary Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incor-
porate material from a header ﬁle that is part of
the Library. You may convey such object code un-
der terms of your choice, provided that, if the in-
corporated material is not limited to numerical pa-
rameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or
small macros, inline functions and templates (ten
or fewer lines in length), you do both of the follow-
ing:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
object code that the Library is used in it and that
the Library and its use are covered by this License.
* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the
GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works.

5. Combined Libraries.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of
your choice that, taken together, eﬀectively do not
restrict modiﬁcation of the portions of the Library
contained in the Combined Work and reverse en-
gineering for debugging such modiﬁcations, if you
also do each of the following:

* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
that the Library and its use are covered by this Li-
cense. * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a
copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. *
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright no-
tices during execution, include the copyright notice
for the Library among these notices, as well as a ref-
erence directing the user to the copies of the GNU
GPL and this license document. * d) Do one of the
following: o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding
Source under the terms of this License, and the Cor-
responding Application Code in a form suitable for,
and under terms that permit, the user to recombine
or relink the Application with a modiﬁed version
of the Linked Version to produce a modiﬁed Com-
bined Work, in the manner speciﬁed by section 6 of
the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
o 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for
linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism
is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Li-
brary already present on the user’s computer sys-
tem, and (b) will operate properly with a modiﬁed
version of the Library that is interface-compatible
with the Linked Version. * e) Provide Installation
Information, but only if you would otherwise be re-
quired to provide such information under section 6
of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such
information is necessary to install and execute a
modiﬁed version of the Combined Work produced
by recombining or relinking the Application with
a modiﬁed version of the Linked Version. (If you
use option 4d0, the Installation Information must
accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
4d1, you must provide the Installation Information
in the manner speciﬁed by section 6 of the GNU
GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

You may place library facilities that are a work
based on the Library side by side in a single library
together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License,
and convey such a combined library under terms of
your choice, if you do both of the following:

* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy
of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
with any other library facilities, conveyed under
the terms of this License. * b) Give prominent no-
tice with the combined library that part of it is a
work based on the Library, and explaining where
to ﬁnd the accompanying uncombined form of the
same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General
Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General
Public License from time to time. Such new ver-
sions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may diﬀer in detail to address new problems or
concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version num-
ber. If the Library as you received it speciﬁes that
a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser Gen-
eral Public License “or any later version” applies to
it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foun-
dation. If the Library as you received it does not
specify a version number of the GNU Lesser Gen-
eral Public License, you may choose any version of
the GNU Lesser General Public License ever pub-
lished by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it speciﬁes that a
proxy can decide whether future versions of the
GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply,
that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of
any version is permanent authorization for you to
choose that version for the Library.
