Preface

The potato is the fourth most important food crop in the world after wheat, maize and rice
with 311 million tonnes produced from 19 million hectares at an average fresh weight
yield of 16.4 t/ha in 2003 (FAO statistics), but with a huge range from 2 to 44 t/ha by
country. As well as being a staple food the potato is grown as a vegetable for table
use, is processed into French fries and chips (crisps) and is used for dried products and
starch production. Processing is the fastest growing sector of the world potato economy,
and today, processors are building factories in countries where the potato is primarily
grown as a staple food. In some countries, the potato is still fed to animals but this
use is decreasing. In many countries in Asia, Africa and Central and South America,
there is a need for increased and stable potato production to meet increasing demands for
food from human population growth during a period of environmental (including climate)
change. Potatoes with improved nutritional and health properties are desirable, but the
overriding need is for increased and stable yields to eradicate human hunger and poverty.
In those countries where food security has been achieved, the potato industries are trying
to increase potato usage in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. The
emphasis is on more yield of saleable product at less cost of production, reduced use
of pesticides and fungicides, better use of water and fertilizers and meeting consumer
demands for healthy convenience foods and novel products. These objectives will be met
only through new cultivars, better crop management and utilization of resources, better
post-harvest storage, better control of pests and diseases and a better understanding of the
social, economic and market factors that influence global production and distribution.

Today there is a tremendous opportunity to harness recent advances in potato biology
and biotechnology in these endeavours. We therefore considered it timely to ask a number
of experts to help us review the current state-of-knowledge in all aspects of the potato
crop, from basic science to production, processing and marketing. Therefore, this book
includes a wide variety of chapters, describing potato markets, genetics and genetic
resources, plant growth and development, response to the environment, tuber quality, pests
and diseases, biotechnology and crop management. We gave authors as much freedom
as possible over the content and style of their chapters, consistent with the subject matter
forming a comprehensive and coherent book without unnecessary duplication. We did
our best to help authors make their contributions as readable and free from errors as is
possible in a human enterprise. The idea to compile such a comprehensive volume was
put forward and initiated by our colleagues Howard Davies and Roberto Viola. We are
indebted to them and to many other colleagues for their support, especially Philip Smith
for his proof reading, and to the publishers for their advice and encouragement.

Preface

We hope that the finished product will be of value not only to potato biologists but also
to all those people throughout the world interested in ensuring that the potato continues
to make a major contribution to the feeding of humankind.

The Fresh Potato Market

Iain McGregor

SAC, Auchincruive, Ayr KA6 5HW, United Kingdom

The potato has arguably revolutionized western society as much as trains, planes and automobiles.
It has been and still is a delicacy, a fast food and a hedge against famine. This chapter will review the
market for fresh potatoes largely within the UK, a market that is generally accepted as one of the most
sophisticated potato markets worldwide.

1.1 INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

The importance of potatoes within the UK’s agricultural industry and how the crop
compares with other crop enterprises are summarized in Table 1.1. The potato sector
contributes £482 million in total to food and agricultural output in the UK (Table 1.2)
and represents the second most important crop economically after wheat.

Potato growing in the UK accounts for an area equivalent to approximately 5% of the
cereals’ area. Yet its contribution per hectare to the agriculture industry’s revenue is more
than seven times that generated by cereals. Potato growing produces a much higher value
crop per hectare than cereal enterprises, but potato growers face much greater fluctuations
in the level of prices and revenue as mentioned in the section 1.7.

According to the calendar-year accounts of the Department of the Environment and
Rural Affairs (DEFRA) between the mid-1990s and 2005, the value of output from
the potato sector fell by 41% albeit with significant fluctuations in output during the
intervening years and the cereal sector’s receipts fell by a similar amount (43%) over the
same period.

1.2 PRODUCTION

Although the registered planted area of potatoes has declined from around 250 000
hectares in the early 1960s to 116 400 hectares in 2005 (Fig. 1.1), gross production over
the same period has remained relatively constant at around 6 million tonnes (Fig. 1.2).
The fresh supply chain accounted for around half of this (49%) at 2 958 000 tonnes in
2004–05.

In 2005, plantings were 4% down, average yields were 2% down and the associated
production figure of 5.65 million tonnes represented the lowest production figure recorded
in the UK since 1984. With significant annual variations in value due, among other

things, to weather patterns, the underlying trend in average yield has been an increase
from around 23 tonnes per hectare in 1960 to around 47 tonnes per hectare currently
(Fig. 1.2). This information, including a breakdown between early and maincrop varieties,
is available in more detail on the web site of the British Potato Council (BPC) at
http://www.potato.org.uk/. The increases in yield have only been possible as a result of
improved agronomy and crop management, skills which have developed in line with
increasing concentration and specialization among growers in the UK.

One may question whether it was as a result of these improved yields that production
has remained relatively stable despite the significant reduction in the area planted or was
it the rising yields that enabled lower prices and led to the reduction in planted area or,
thirdly, was it lower prices that forced the smaller producers from the market.

Fig. 1.2. Total production of potatoes in Great Britain, 1960–2004 [with permission of British Potato Council
(BPC, 2006), Market Information and Statistics]. Since 1960, total production in Great Britain has remained
at about 6 million tonnes. Annual fluctuations are mainly due to weather – see drought of 1975–76. Yield per
hectare has increased steadily compensating for decreasing planted areas.

Grower numbers in Great Britain (GB) have declined dramatically over the last
45 years and continue to decline year on year as the trend in specialization and con-
centration continues. To illustrate the scale and significance of the industry shakeout,
the author points out that in 1960 there were 76 825 registered growers in the country

McGregor

whereas in 2005 only 3064 (4%) remain. The average area planted per grower is now
around 10 times more than it was back in 1960 (Fig. 1.1). In 2005 the average planting
per grower is 38 hectares compared with 3.65 hectares in 1960. The trend in concentration
at production level continues to gain momentum illustrated by the fact that in 1996, 28%
of registered growers were within the 20-hectare-plus size band. Almost 10 years later in
2005, 50% of growers are within the over 20-hectare size band (Table 1.3).

Variety choice for the ware market as summarized in Table 1.4 has changed very little
over the years with the top 10 varieties grown accounting for two-thirds (66%) of the
total national ware crop and with Maris Piper and Estima continuing to dominate the
market in 2005, the former with 20% of the ware area and the latter with 13%. Maris
Peer and the crisping variety Lady Rosetta swapped places in the 2005 rankings at third
and fourth places, respectively. Marfona moved up a couple of places to the number eight

slot probably on the back of continued demand from the domestic buyer and from the
pubs and high-street cafes for good-quality baking potatoes.

Between 2000 and 2005 there has been a continuous change among the less frequently
occurring varieties; for example, Hermes, King Edward (long-standing in the market),
Osprey and Harmony all recently achieved higher proportions of the planted area, whereas
Désirée, Cara and Maris Bard all declined in popularity. The second early Osprey variety
is suited to the pre-pack and general ware market and may end up replacing Cara in
the market. Harmony, with 1268 hectares grown for ware in 2005, is an early maincrop
variety. Whether any of these changes will become progressive and ‘permanent’ remains
to be seen.

Market research carried out by the BPC clearly demonstrated that many consumers
want to know more about potato varieties. They were in agreement that more should be
done to tell customers about the differing qualities of varieties – a King Edward compared
with a Maris Piper for example. This is an area that will be explored in Section 1.6.

1.3 SUPPLY

Total consumption of potatoes in GB is around 6 million tonnes similar to the total GB
supply. However, the figure for supply includes 18% waste and 7% seed supply so that
the net GB supply is around 4.5 million tonnes. Processed products are the main import,
totalling 1.3 million tonnes raw equivalent with some fresh imports for processing. Fresh
ware imports and exports are nearly in balance, with a slight surplus (77 000 tonnes)
on imports. The supply chains for fresh and processed potatoes are currently similar in
volume. The volume of potatoes entering the fresh supply chain in GB is estimated by
the BPC to have been 2.96 million tonnes in 2004–05. This represents almost half (49%)
of the total GB consumption figure of 6076 tonnes. Figure 1.3 provides a schematic
flowchart representing the several market components. Table 1.5 gives further details on
the supply and disposal of potatoes in GB and indicates the annual variation between
components. The proportions of the planted area that are intended for processing, pre-
pack or other fresh variety have been fairly stable between 2000 and 2006, but there is a
trend towards increasing fractions that are planted and grown under contract rather than
without contract (free-buy) (Table 1.6).

1.4 DEMAND

Shoppers in UK spent £819(cid:2)38 million (Table 1.7) on fresh potatoes purchased from
retail outlets in the year ending 18 June 2006. This showed a small reduction (2.2%) in
the previous year’s total consumer outlay, although the quantity of potatoes purchased
was up by 1.7% because the average price of potatoes in the fresh market was £0(cid:2)52 per
kilogram, down by 2 pence over the year. That change could be explained by the multiple
retailers’ continuing quest to drive down prices.

Over 80% of fresh potato sales are now made in supermarkets, 70% in the four biggest
ones, and this gives the multiple retailers massive purchasing power and influence over

the supply chain. Of course, this situation is not confined to the potato sector as in 2006,
the four big grocery leaders (Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Morrison’s) control 75% of the
£120 UK billion grocery market (Table 1.8).

Altogether 1 588 459 tonnes of fresh potatoes were bought and 468 595 tonnes (29.5%)
of these were sold by Tesco. The store’s sales showed a 5.0% increase in quantity over
the previous year and were the largest among the supermarkets by a wide margin [Source:
Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS)].

Fresh potato sales are a large market but a relatively stable one. Some retailers are
still experiencing growth in this sector, but this is largely at the expense of other retailers
rather than overall growth. Increasingly, the supermarkets are turning to their suppliers for
assistance in marketing potatoes, developing category management principles that have
been seen for many years with fast moving consumer goods. Table 1.8 provides details
of the retailer share of the fresh potato market by volume and value in UK.

As the supermarkets have grown their market share, their associated specialist sup-
plier/packers have developed in parallel. Between the years 2000 to 2006 there has been
continued concentration through mergers and acquisitions within both the multiple-retail
sector and the packing industry. In UK now, four major multiples control three-quarters
of the fresh market. As the retail multiples continue to rationalize their supply base, the
number of specialist packers declines. Typically, supermarkets now work with one major
packer/supplier supplemented by one or two ‘secondary’ packers. Table 1.9 summarizes
this point.

During 2004 and 2005, multiples such as Tesco and Sainsbury’s re-evaluated and
streamlined their supplier base, dropping some groups to sign more exclusive contracts
with others. For example, at the beginning of 2005, Sainsbury’s cut its potato suppliers
to just three: Greenvale AP, Boston-based Naturally Best Packing (Formerly Hoche
International) and QV Foods. According to the supermarket chain, such streamlining
means a better position for improving efficiencies.

The suppliers gaining such contracts have the advantage of additional security, although
it does mean that they are reliant on a narrower customer base. The need for critical
mass to effectively supply the multiples has also driven activity. The grouping together
of companies to form strategic alliances has been a feature of the fresh produce sector

since the late 1990s. These deals allow smaller producers to gain greater bargaining
power with their customers or to provide a wider or less-seasonal product range. An
example of such a trading arrangement is the Perthshire-based growers’ group Taygrow,
who dedicate their total potato crop of approximately 80 000 tonnes from 1620 hectares
to Taypack, one of three UK potato suppliers to Asda supermarkets. There is a mutual
commitment between Taygrow members, Taypack and Asda. Taygrow potato producers
have a guaranteed market, whereas Asda has a guaranteed long-term and reliable potato
supply.

Pre-packed fresh potatoes are much preferred, outselling loose fresh potatoes by six
to one in quantity (Table 1.10), but loose potatoes have a higher average selling price of
77 pence per kilogram compared with 48 pence per kilogram for pre-packed so that the
ratio of values of pre-packed potatoes to loose ones is only 4:1. Pre-packed potatoes are
purchased by more households, with only 7 of 10 households buying loose potatoes in
the course of a year.

There are progressive changes in both value and quantities of constituent parts of the
fresh market. ‘Organic’ potatoes continue to show the largest increase in market value at
12.6% year on year, with pre-packed baking potatoes showing 6.2% growth in value and
pre-packed new potatoes 6.1%. That last figure reflects the high convenience factor of
cooking straight from the pack to the pan without the need for scraping or peeling. This
is borne out by the increase in the area grown for the main salad varieties Charlotte and
Maris Peer by 2 and 5%, respectively.

Organic potatoes also continue to show good volume growth at 12.2%, but this is
overtaken by pre-packed baking potatoes at 13.8%. Whereas the growth in quantities of
potatoes grown for pre-packing has shown progressive growth – pre-packed baking at
13.8%, pre-packed new potatoes at 7.9% and over-all 4% – the apparent growth in the
quantity of organic potatoes (12.2%; Table 1.10) has to be seen against the large increase
in planted area between 1998 and 2002 and the subsequent fluctuations (Table 1.11).

The area of land under ‘organic’ horticultural production increased by 4.5% from
7400 hectares in April 2004 to 7700 hectares in January 2005, according to the Organic
Market Report (Soil Association, 2005). Given the fluctuations in area planted to ‘organic’
potatoes and the fact that the area planted to other ‘organic’ root vegetables decreased
by 28%, concerns have been expressed by the Soil Association over increasing levels
of imported organic produce. The contribution of the organic potato crop should be
kept in context, however, as the Soil Association’s estimated production area of 1886

hectares represents only 1.6% of the BPC’s total registered area. There is a further caveat
that much of the organic production will be in units smaller than the BPC’s 3-hectare
registration limit and, therefore, will not be registered. Nevertheless, the organic area
provides potential for further development (Fig. 1.4).

1.5 EXPENDITURE AND CONSUMPTION

There are shifting patterns in potato consumption in the home. Since 2003–04, potato
consumption has fallen by 5%. This could be attributed partially to the popularity of
low-carbohydrate diets such as ‘Atkins’.

The fresh potato market

‘Low-carb’ diets such as Atkins have seen a shift in the type of produce eaten; it is a
strong proponent of the consumption of plenty of green vegetables but shuns the use of
peas and citrus fruit. Unfortunately, one strongly promoted condition is the consumption
of potatoes: the BPC reported that there was some impact on the sale of potatoes, which,
although low in fat and calories, are high in carbohydrates. However, low-carb dieting
appeared to be declining in popularity at the beginning of 2005, with glycaemic index
(GI) dieting taking its place.

Potatoes constituted one-third of all carbohydrates consumed in 2005. Practicality is
thought to be the main consumption driver, accounting for 51.1%, as potatoes naturally
complement many types of food and boiling or steaming is used on 39% of the occasions
when potatoes are prepared at home (Fig. 1.5).

Health is less of a consideration in determining the choice of carbohydrate, with only
12.5% of all potato-eating occasions being cited as ‘healthy’. This is much lower than
for all other carbohydrates.

According to market researchers TNS, the key age group for potato consumption is
the over-45s of both sexes – over-45s account for 43.3% of all potato consumption –
although their use of potatoes is also down by 2.7% year on year, in line with the overall
trend. Although they are the least significant consumer age group, 17- to 25-year-olds
are much more likely to eat potatoes than other carbohydrates. They are most attuned to
dieting but choose to eat potatoes on the few occasions when they actually do consume
carbohydrates.

Consumption peaks on Sundays when 17.2% of potatoes are eaten. Consumption of
the balance is fairly evenly spread through the rest of the week at 12–15% per day. The
evening meal is the key occasion for consumption with almost two-thirds of potatoes
eaten at that time.

1.6 THE CONSUMERS’ VIEWS

The good news is that almost all households in the UK (97%) purchase fresh potatoes at
least every 2 weeks. The product is purchased by all socioeconomic groups in relatively
large amounts. The frequency with which fresh potatoes are purchased is testimony to
their enduring place in the national diet. Research undertaken on behalf of the BPC by The
Oxford Partnership into fresh-potato-purchasing habits shows that although consumption
and marketing of potatoes are both doing well, there remains room for improvement. Con-
sumers made this clear through discussion groups and interviews with the findings falling
into seven key areas – packaging, convenience, usage, marketing, product innovation,
health and product quality.

Table 1.12 summarizes the opportunities (good news) and threats (bad news) for the

fresh potato sector as it stands at time of writing.

Some of the findings from the research included the fact that 60% of shoppers would
look out for ‘British’ if the packs were labelled more clearly and 42% said packaging
could be more attractive. When shown four labelling format options differing only in
which components had the largest lettering, 42% opted for the label highlighting the
variety compared with 40% for highlighting use (e.g. chipping, boiling, mashing and
baking).

Over 80% suggested that more recipes should be available to ensure that potatoes can
be cooked in different ways. Conversely, 61% wanted potatoes that are quick and easy
to cook, and 46% thought there should be more potatoes that can be transferred straight
from the pack to the pan for cooking.

Considering in-store presentation, it tended to be the chilled displays that were rated
more highly than fresh or frozen products as they provided opportunities for finding
‘something special’ and for ‘tempting experimentation’. Furthermore, 56% of shoppers
like to see fresh, chilled and frozen potatoes displayed together. That might be convenient
for the shopper but would not be particularly practical for store layout and logistics.

Two further points to emerge from the BPC’s market research work are that 88% of
people agreed that ‘much more could be done to tell people how healthy fresh potatoes
are’ and 41% admitted they would buy more fresh potatoes if the quality was less variable.
Clear quality differences were apparent between different retailers and regions of the
country. This remains a challenge for all members within the supply chain for fresh
potatoes.

1.6.1 When potatoes are consumed

Much work has been carried out by the BPC on potato-purchasing habits. One outcome
from this research has been the development of the meal-occasion model for potato
purchases. The model identifies seven meal-occasions based on whether the meal is
‘everyday’ or ‘special’ in nature and the extent to which it is ‘pre-planned’. The model is
shown graphically in Fig. 1.6 with ‘entertaining friends’ understandably characterized as
special and requiring pre-planning, whereas a quick and simple kids’ meal is the opposite.
The seven meal-occasions can indicate which potato type and variety are suitable for
each meal situation, what packaging format is required, how the product needs to be
prepared and how the consumer will handle it, which other carbohydrates are perceived
as competitors, and where the current potato offer is strong and where the offer is weak.
The type or variety of potato purchased varies according to the meal occasion, and this
also influences packaging or presentation expected. Price is not a critical factor in any
segment and least of all for a special meal and entertaining friends. Practical examples of
how this approach translates into purchasing habits are that jacket potatoes are a popular
choice for those looking for a healthy meal and roast potatoes are a firm favourite for

family meals, whereas chips (French fries) are rated highly for quick and simple kids’
meals. Planned special meals offer an opportunity for adding value, but potatoes are
not always an inspiring choice, and rice and pasta provide strong competition. This is a
challenge for the industry.

It is the four planned meal occasions – family meal, healthy meal, entertaining friends
and simple adult meal – that offer development opportunities for the fresh market
(Table 1.13). Table 1.13 provides details of market value and growth for the seven

meal-occasions together with snacking occasions. The table also offers an indication of
the importance of these occasions for the fresh potato market.

As consumption figures for fresh potatoes illustrate, the underlying trend is that of
decline. According to DEFRA’s Family Food report, the UK currently consumes less
that half (43%) of the potatoes that it did back in 1974. The worry, therefore, is that the
market will decline even further if nothing is done. There is an opportunity to address
this slow decline in consumption by increasing consumer expenditure on added-value
products. This may however create volume growth in the chilled sector rather than the
fresh market.

Opportunities include addressing the growing demand for products at the premium
end of the market. This may include special packaging, exotic varieties and varieties
with health benefits, etc. During 2005/06 there have been a number of limited examples
of attempts to do exactly this. So, Tesco and their packer supplier Branston introduced
the Dutch salad variety Exquisa, a waxy early maincrop variety with yellow skin and
flesh, to Tesco’s ‘Finest’ range. There has also been renewed interest in heritage varieties
largely driven by Waitrose and their sole packer Solanum. Varieties such as Shetland
Black, Ratte, Pink Fir Apple and Kerr’s Pink have been offered to consumers who are
looking for something exotic or different. In 2006, Greenvale AP has offered the Scottish
Crop Research Institute (SCRI)-bred variety Mayan Gold to the market, selected from the
species Solanum phureja. This is a yellow-fleshed gourmet potato with a unique flavour
and requiring 75% less cooking time.

Adding value to the fresh potato sector is always a challenge, but the Waitrose packer
Solanum managed just that. In May 2005, Waitrose customers were able to purchase
packs of fresh potatoes containing recipes within the bag. Having invested in equipment
to insert objects into potato packs before they are sealed, Solanum now has the facility
to include inserts such as recipe cards, nutritional information, scratch cards, money-off
vouchers or sachets of sauce or herbs. The investment followed market research into
consumers’ priorities, which suggested that shoppers were looking for ‘potato solutions’.
This includes help with choice of variety for specific cooking purposes and advice on
recipe ideas.

Solanum and Waitrose were to combine once again to offer their customers full trace-
ability for their fresh potatoes from November 2005. The scheme, which was developed
in conjunction with Syngenta, is based on customers entering a code number from the
pack label onto the Solanum website. Details of the farm in which the potatoes were
grown are then provided via the web. That seems to be a neat idea and a useful marketing
tool, but it would be interesting to know how many Waitrose customers actually use it.
Another example of brand development is the promotion of the variety Rooster by the
packer Albert Bartlett. The variety gained media coverage through awards for food and
drink excellence; Rooster potatoes won the ‘Retail Fruit and Vegetable’ and ‘Healthy Eat-
ing Marketing Promotion’ categories at the Scottish Food and Drink Excellence Awards.
More headlines were generated when, in summer 2005, the G8 world leaders were to eat
Rooster potatoes while dining at Gleneagles during their stay at the G8 Summit.

Other options for adding value include offering local provenance and building on the
associated trust. Research consistently shows consumer preferences for locally produced
food. This is difficult logistically with supply chains based on centralized packhouses

serving the supermarkets’ centralized regional distribution centres. For example, Asda
supplier Taypack, based at Inchture between Perth and Dundee, serves all Asda stores in
Scotland and all stores in the north of England as far south as North Wales in the west
and the River Humber in the east.

Offering consumers more guarantees is another way of adding value and building trust.
This is particularly true when it comes to health and environmental guarantees. However,
there is a danger of confusing consumers who may be suffering already from information
overload concerning farm assurance schemes together with the range of food marques
and logos of offer.

There is a clear opportunity for greater market segmentation within the fresh market.
While the meal-occasion model is based on meal solutions, fresh potatoes can also be
targeted at market segments based on price sensitivity together with consumers’ needs
and priorities. The method by which Tesco segments its customers is shown graphically
in Fig. 1.7, which illustrates these segmentation variables. Customers are categorized
according to their affluence and then into six groupings depending on their shopping
habits and lifestyle priorities. This allows Tesco to develop a range of food products, we
hope including fresh potatoes, to meet the needs of its customer groups.

1.7 PRICES PAID TO PRODUCERS

The relations between area planted, average yield and potato prices are inextricably linked
within an unprotected environment where the laws of supply and demand operate with
almost textbook accuracy. Prior to 1994, price comparisons were influenced by market
regulation through the former Potato Marketing Board. Previously, growers received
direct and indirect support under the Potato Marketing Scheme (PMS) in the form of area
quota, intervention buying and deficiency payments. There is no support mechanism for
potatoes under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), thus the level of support for the
UK potato sector is determined by the government. The most important element in the

The fresh potato market

19

PMS was the area quota. This was ‘justified’ partly on the grounds that the underlying
trend in yields was upwards and consumption was more or less static. It was also ‘justified’
on the grounds that potato yields tend to fluctuate widely from year to year.

In the 1980s, government policy swung in favour of deregulated markets, and the level
of support provided to the potato sector under the PMS began to decline. In 1985 the
deficiency payments scheme was abolished, and in 1993 the government announced that
the PMS – essentially area quotas – would end in 1997. Given the volatility of yields,
many growers feared that the ending of quotas would result in massive instability not only
for their businesses but also throughout the supply chain. Fortunately, these fears have
not been borne out although years with high production are associated with lower prices
and the reverse also applies. Prices are noticeably weaker in years where production
exceeds 6 million tonnes. While there is a longer-term trend for declining prices in real
terms, there may also be an underlying tendency for price fluctuations to be decreasing.
Both these tendencies may be a result of the increasing area of potatoes grown under
contract (48% of the ware area) and the increasing tonnage grown on a ‘cost plus’ basis –
a payment system where growers know they will get a guaranteed price above the costs
of production. Although there are now fewer speculative growers left in the industry and
forward contracts have created more stability in the market, yet there is a positive relation
between the average potato price and the area planted in the following year (Fig. 1.8).

Potato prices, as with all other farm gate prices, continue to be a sensitive and con-
tentious issue among farmers. The continuing accusation is that supermarkets are ‘putting
a lid on prices’ and preventing farmers from benefiting from improving free-market prices
in times when the market is strong. These are claims that are frequently levelled at the
supermarkets by the farming industry via their representative body, the National Farm-
ers Union (NFU). This unfortunately is the corollary of the contract cost-plus system.
Farmers are grateful for the cost-plus price and guaranteed market when trade is poor but
get agitated when the market is strong, and they are stuck with the lower pre-arranged
contract price. What rubs salt into the wound is the fact that supermarkets – particularly
UK’s largest, Tesco – continue to lodge record profits at a time when farming is being
squeezed. The NFU is hoping that all these issues will be thoroughly investigated in the

Competition Commission enquiry into the way that supermarkets deal with their suppliers
that starts during late summer 2006. A concentrated but highly competitive retail sector
has created new pressures for food and drink manufacturers, and the fresh potato market
is no different.

Years with higher yields and lower prices tend to be balanced by years of lower yields
and higher prices. The degree of price volatility was more commonplace in the past when
less of the national crop was grown under forward contract and there was less use of
cost-plus pricing. The other noticeable market response is for speculative growers to plant
a larger area following a year of relatively high prices.

A case in point is 1999–2000 when the average price collapsed to £67 per tonne
following the 1998 crop year, which gave an average price of £147 per tonne. The main
cause of the fall in price, despite little change in yield from the previous year, was the
8% increase in the area planted.

In most years, there is a strong seasonal cycle of changing prices for ware potatoes,

but the amplitude of the cycle and its baseline differ from year to year (Fig. 1.9).

1.8 POTATOES AND THE HEALTH ISSUE

Evolving consumer trends pose both opportunities and challenges for food and drink
market suppliers. Along with convenience and pleasure, health is one of the key drivers
for consumers when it comes to food shopping (Fig. 1.10). Fortunately, fresh potatoes
have much to offer health conscious consumers. As is demonstrated in Table 1.14, the
potato is nutritious, relatively low in calories, virtually free of fat and cholesterol, and
high in vitamin C and potassium. It is also high in fibre especially when the potatoes are
served with their skins.

The BPC run a number of promotional campaigns to heighten demand for British
potatoes and to increase the competitiveness of the UK potato industry. Current BPC

promotional work is built around three ‘inter-linked platforms’: National Chip Week
(February), Health (May–August) and Convenience (September–November). The BPC’s
2006 health campaign, ‘Fab not Fad’, was aimed at the health-conscious market espe-
cially – women – promoting potatoes as low fat, low salt and rich in vitamin C.

The ‘Help Me To Be Healthy’ campaign of summer 2006 followed research that
showed that consumers are confused about the health benefits of potatoes – 66% of people
surveyed rate pasta and rice as healthier than potatoes and one in seven children think
potatoes make you fat.

There is always jockeying for position among our daily carbohydrate requirements
between potatoes, pasta and rice. A balanced diet should include 50% of total energy
from carbohydrate. This is the equivalent of a minimum of 100 g of carbohydrate per day.

Carbohydrates are needed to prevent fatigue and dangerous fluid imbalance. To make
sure we get enough, we should eat 6–11 servings each day from the carbohydrate group
that includes bread, cereal, rice, pasta and potatoes. One of the health and nutrition
messages promoted by the BPC is that potatoes contain less fat and fewer calories than
other carbohydrates (Table 1.15).

Between 2003 to 2006 there were a number of recent attempts to endorse and promote
potato varieties with health benefits. One example is the variety Adora, which was claimed
to have 75% of the calories carried by other potatoes and 66% of the carbohydrates. The
first early HZPC variety was re-launched in Florida in early 2005 as the ‘Atkins-friendly’
potato. In the UK, Naturally Best also played the health card with its variety Vivaldi
claiming that it has 26% less carbohydrate and 33% fewer calories than the average
variety. These claims represent both imaginative and opportunistic marketing and invite
the cynical response that they simply contain more water. Promoting the healthy eating
attributes of potatoes is not a new marketing strategy, however, as selenium-rich potatoes
have been promoted in Italy for some time.

1.8.1 Glycaemic indices

As a result of fashionable interest in low-carbohydrate diets, there is increasing interest
and debate surrounding the GI of foods. This is a measure of how quickly and by how
much a food raises blood sugar levels. The GI, introduced by Jenkins et al. (1981), is
a tool to rank foods (on an index of 1–100) by whether they raise blood sugar levels
dramatically (a high index rating of 70+), moderately (56–69) or a little (55 or less).
Potatoes generally have one of the highest GI values of any food. However, GI ratings
for foods vary dramatically depending on whether they are eaten alone or in combination
with other foods. For example, (Table 1.16) a potato eaten on its own may have a GI
rating of 88, but when eaten with cheddar cheese, e.g. in a baked potato, the GI rating of
the combination is low at 39.

Furthermore, research work carried out by Oxford Brookes University in 2004 on
behalf of the BPC found that different potato varieties exhibit a wide range of GI responses
from 56 to 94. Potatoes with waxy textures produced medium GI values whereas floury
potatoes had high GI values (Table 1.17).

So what is the worth of the GI? Determining the GI of a meal is not as simple as
reading a number off a chart. For example, the addition of fat and protein slows down

the absorption of carbohydrate. Therefore, chocolate has a medium GI because of its fat
content, and crisps and chips have a lower GI than potatoes cooked without fat.

The GI of food only tells you how quickly or slowly it raises blood glucose when the
food is eaten on its own. In practice, we usually eat foods as meals in combination with
other foods, so cutting out all high GI foods is not the answer. A further complication
with potatoes is that while they score high on the GI scale, they also score high on the
satiety index (SI). The higher the SI of a food, the more satisfied a person is between
meals and therefore is less likely to snack.

So what are the implications of all this for the potato industry? If people were to confine
themselves to low-GI foods, their diet would be unbalanced resulting in an inappropriate
amount of energy coming from fat, which could lead to weight gain and increase their
risk of heart disease. For this reason, it is important not to focus exclusively on GI and
instead to think more in terms of the overall balance of the diet. Describing potatoes
simply in terms of their high GI value does not do justice to their nutritional benefits and
the fact that they are an important part of a healthy and balanced diet. If a low-GI potato
variety can be identified, however, it could be used to lower the overall glycaemic load of
the western diet and thus decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and
obesity. Confusion among health-conscious consumers about GI and potato consumption
is one for organizations like the BPC to address as part of their continuing marketing and
educational remit.

Finally, the UK government’s ‘Five-a-day’ campaign urging consumers to eat at least
five portions of fruit and vegetables a day is continuing, backed by bodies such as the
Food Standards Agency and various supplier groups in the produce sector. Consumers
are being encouraged to eat fruit and vegetables at a wider range of eating occasions in
order to meet the ‘Five-a-day’ requirement. This can only be good news for the sector.

1.9 SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

The potato industry in general can offer a number of lessons to UK agriculture. The
way in which the potato sector operates as an unsupported agricultural sector in a totally
free market is evidence that farming enterprises can survive without support while at the
same time coming to terms with wide fluctuations in producer prices and annual incomes.
The potato sector operates with a short three-link supply chain (grower, packer and
retailer), and there is a positive willingness among growers to form groups and vertical
relationships. For example, there are currently 10 grower groups operating in Scotland
alone. These transactional arrangements help to reduce market uncertainty and maintain
competitiveness. A continuing problem is the industry’s understandable but irrational
response to plant a larger area following a year of higher prices. The replacement of
‘hard’ contracts between growers, packers and retailers with vertical partnerships would
help reduce these irrational responses to price fluctuations and help growers and their
customers to meet the ever more exacting consumer demands.

The BPC believes that building sales of fresh potatoes should be based on promotional
activity that focuses on health, convenience and better value. Research findings from

The fresh potato market

25

Somerfield supermarket shoppers concluded that three broad types of promotional activity
should be developed:

(1) Promote the health benefits of potatoes.
(2) Create convenient meal solutions with fresh potatoes.
(3) Create better value – for both the retailer and its value-conscious customers.

The research concluded that promotional activity should be focused on those of the
multiple’s shoppers now buying a lot less potatoes than previously and those of its regular
shoppers who buy their potatoes elsewhere. It was reckoned that the biggest impact and
best pay-back would be derived from those sections of their customers.

1.9.1 Key points
• The fresh market will continue to decline in value terms relative to the processed
market.
• There will be more market segmentation within the fresh market – look at the other
staple food product, bread, and how that sector now offers greater specialization and
segmentation to its customers.
• The chilled market will grow in line with increasing demand for added-value, conve-
nience food products.
• The processed market will experience increasing pressure from imports.
• Higher transport costs will continue to provide a degree of protection to the fresh
potato sector. But higher fuel costs for field operations and storage will reduce growers’
margins.
• There will be continued rationalization in production.
• There will be continued concentration throughout the supply chain – this includes
growers, packers, processors and retailers.
• Continued yield increases will lead to less land under potatoes.
• Soil sickness and, increasingly, water availability will become more important in deter-
mining production.
• Vertical supply chain partnerships will ensure the future viability of the sector.

Getting away from a commodity product and commodity mentality is key to the future
of the industry. In too many cases, fresh potatoes are still seen within the trade and
by consumers as simply reds or whites with variety, provenance, cookability, taste and
texture given little attention. The one thing we do know about consumers is that while
they are interested in differentiated products up to a point, they consistently demand both
quality and choice. Improvements in both areas are yet another way of pushing up fresh
consumption. There is also a strong argument for better labelling and more attractive
packaging, something which the processing sector recognized some time ago.

The good educational work being carried out by the BPC particularly at school level
must be carried on so that consumers of tomorrow appreciate the value of this valuable
staple food product and make use of its qualities to full potential.

Global Markets for Processed Potato Products

Michael A. Kirkman

3 The Coach House, Main Street, Ravenstone, Leicestershire LE67 2AS, United Kingdom

2.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter is an essay on the global potato-processing industry from the personal
perspective of a former Agro R&D manager in a major snack food company. During my
employment of 25 years in the industry, significant expansion has occurred not only in
the global market for chips (crisps in the UK) but also for French fries (chips in the UK)
and other processed potato products.

In the pages that follow, I have tried to marry my understanding of potato science with
a new understanding about markets, based on research undertaken during the preparation
of this chapter. In this endeavour, considerable help was forthcoming from a number of
sources, which I have acknowledged in the final section.

2.2 PROCESSED POTATO PRODUCTS

In developed nations, up to 60% of potato in everyday diet is consumed in processed
form. Demand for convenience food in the home, fast food in restaurants and snacking
has given rise to a wide variety of products. These include potato chips, French fries and
various other frozen products, dehydrated potato products, chilled-peeled potatoes and
canned potatoes.

Potato chips are deep-fried, thinly sliced potatoes, with a finished moisture concentra-
tion of 1.3–1.5%. They are fried in different types of vegetable oil, with a range of added
flavours, e.g. salt, salt and vinegar, cheese and onion, paprika and cool lemon to name a
few. They are sold in 25–400 g portions, with a shelf life of 12–14 weeks; freshness is
preserved as far as possible in a nitrogen atmosphere within sealed polylaminated bags.
The term ‘potato chip’ also denotes chips formed from a dough made with dehydrated
potato, and either baked or flash-fried. Baked Lays® and Pringles® are examples of this
product type. In later discussion of global production (Section 2.4), the term ‘chip’ will
be used inclusively.

French fries are made from potatoes that have been cut into thin strips, washed briefly
in cold water, partly dried to remove surface moisture and deep fried in vegetable oil
to a light golden colour. Frozen fry manufacturers ship their products raw, par-fried, or
partially cooked and drizzled with oil (for baking), to suit the end user. Cutting style

varies, and the consumer or restaurant selects a product according to the final cooking
method. Restaurants generally employ deep fat frying, and preferences in home use
include baking and microwaving.

Other frozen potato products include waffles, wedges, hashed brown potatoes, rösti,
pre-formed mashed potatoes, patties, potato rounds, diced potatoes, baby roasts and a
variety of shaped potato products with child-appeal. Manufacturing and trade statistics
are difficult to disaggregate according to different product types. Typically, frozen potato
products other than French fries amount to 10% of the total.

Canned potato production constitutes a few percentage of the overall market for pro-
cessed potatoes. In Europe and subsequently in the UK, production of chilled-peeled
potatoes became established during 1995–2005 to supply a growing demand by restau-
rants, takeaways and the catering business.

2.3 HISTORY OF POTATO PROCESSING

Potato chips have a US origin dating back to 1853 in a hotel kitchen at Saratoga
Springs, New York. The first commercial production got underway in 1895 (Gould, 1999).
William Tappenden of Cleveland, Ohio, made chips for his restaurant and neighbouring
stores. Business thrived, and the first potato chip plant was established in a converted barn.
According to Gould, eleven new chip plants started production during 1895–1928,
giving rise to a number of familiar brands that are still in the market in 2005. In the
UK, Smith’s Crisps began production in 1920. Several innovations mark the industry’s
subsequent development.

During the 1920s, Herman Lay developed the mechanical potato peeler, which stimu-
lated production for a mass market. About the same time, Laura Scudder pioneered the
packaging of potato chips in sealed bags, initially made from waxed paper, later from
cellophane. Seasoning technology was developed in the 1950s by the owner of ‘Tayto’
in Ireland. This allowed controlled amounts of salt and a range of natural and artificial
flavours to be added automatically. In recent years, microprocessor-controlled weighing
heads (1985), optical sorting to remove defective product (1990), and nitrogen-fill to
preserve freshness (1995) have contributed to state-of-the-art potato chip manufacture.

Herman Lay peddled potato chips from Atlanta to Tennessee, selling from the trunk
of his car. In due course, Lay’s potato chips became the first national brand. In 1961,
Lay’s company was merged with Frito, a Dallas-based corn chip manufacturer, to become
Frito-Lay. Part of PepsiCo since 1965, Frito-Lay dominates the North American snacks
market, with its nearest competitor having an 8% share. Frito-Lay is the only global
player in the international snacks market.

The industrial production of French fries started in the USA after World War II (WWII),
but the product was already familiar to soldiers returning from the war of 1914–18.
Pommes frites had been a culinary item in France and later in Belgium since 1800. The
invention of the industrial process for French fry production is generally attributed to
Jack Simplot of the J.R. Simplot Company in Idaho (Guenthner, 2001).

During WWII, Simplot and numbers of other companies engaged in the manufacture
of dehydrated potato to supply the US military. French fry manufacture got underway in

Global markets for processed potato products

29

the early 1950s. In 2005, Simplot produced 1.4 million tonnes of frozen product, though
McCain surpasses this figure and operates in more countries. Global players in the frozen
fries market also include Lamb Weston.

This steeply increasing trend is reflected in US production figures, moving from zero
potato usage for French fries in 1939, 3000 tonnes in 1944 and 2.4 million tonnes in 1972
to approximately 7 million tonnes of frozen product in 2004. This increase parallels the
burgeoning popularity of fast food. McDonald’s is reputed to utilize 27% of the world’s
production of frozen fries.

Potatoes have been frozen and dried for 3000 years. The Incas are credited as the
first producers of chuño, which is still made in the 21st century in local South American
communities. A US patent was granted in 1912, and dehydrated potato was manufactured
in the USA and Britain to supply military personnel during WWII. According to the Union
of the European Processing Companies (UEITP, 2004), in 2002 the process accounted for
2 million tonnes of potato utilization in the EU. During the same year, 2.2 million tonnes
of potatoes were channelled into dehydration in the USA (National Potato Council, 2005).

2.4 CURRENT DIMENSIONS

2.4.1 Global production and consumption

On a country-by-country basis, the annually updated database of the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAOSTAT) is the only comprehensive source of
information for potato production, utilization and trade. FAOSTAT data for 2002 showed
that 12.6 million tonnes of potatoes were used in food manufacture, i.e. processing, but
does not disaggregate according to product type. Data are missing for North America, so
the overall figure that can be derived for the proportion of potatoes in the world’s diet
consumed in processed form will be significantly underestimated.

US National Potato Council figures (2005) indicate that 7 million tonnes of potatoes
were utilized in the USA in 2002 for frozen potato products and 2 million tonnes in
Canada. Potato utilization for potato chip manufacture was cited as 2.3 million tonnes
in 2002. Dehydration accounted for 2.2 million tonnes. Global consumption of potatoes
in processed form for that year thus becomes 26.1 million tonnes, 13% of the overall
world consumption of 202 million tonnes of potatoes for food. The estimate is likely to
be conservative.

How much of the total is consumed as potato chips is not easy to resolve. Datamonitor
(2004) has assessed the 2002 world market volume for chips as 2.3 billion kg, with a
value of $14.3 billion. Using a conversion of 3.6 tonnes of potatoes to 1 tonne of finished
product yields a figure of 8.3 million tonnes of potatoes converted to chips, representing
32% of the world total of 26.1 million tonnes of processed potatoes.

A combination of FAOSTAT and UEITP (2004) data for the 2002 UK import and
production of frozen fries and potato chips yields a comparable figure of 27% potatoes
consumed as chips of total processed potatoes in the UK diet. This is confirmed by
independent data from the British Potato Council (2004). For the USA and Canada, the
figure is approximately 20% (National Potato Council, 2005). Despite a significant and

30

Kirkman

growing export of frozen fries to developing countries reported by Guenthner (2001),
it is arguable that potato chips become established sooner than French fries in the diet
of developing nations, for reasons that will be explored later in section 2.5 on potato
processing companies and locations.

2.4.2 Trends

According to data compiled by J. Guenthner (personal communication) from the American
Frozen Food Institute (AFFI), US potato utilization for the manufacture of frozen products
amounted to 3.5 million tonnes in 1980 and 7.1 million tonnes in 2002. This represents a
3.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for 2002. During the period 1994–2003, the
USA changed from being a net exporter of frozen fries to becoming a net importer (USDA,
2004). On the contrary, Canada increased its net export trade over the same period.
The Netherlands continues as the world’s largest exporter, primarily to EU countries.
The UK is its biggest customer. Belgium, Argentina and Australia also have a share
of the international export trade in frozen fries. Japan has a significant share of imports.
Mexico, China and Korea account for relatively small but increasing import shares.

New frozen fry production facilities are being established around the globe by McCains,
Lamb Weston and the J.R. Simplot Company. It is unclear to what extent this expansion
might be supplemented by local manufacture. However, it is reasonable to conclude
that global production of frozen potato products is expanding with a CAGR of not less
than 3.3%.

For the global potato chip industry, CAGR in mass terms (kg of product) was 3.7%
between 1997 and 2003 (Datamonitor, 2004). This figure represents a steady but relatively
moderate growth from 2 million tonnes of finished product in 1999 to 2.35 million tonnes
in 2003. The corresponding figure for potato utilization in chip manufacture is 8.3 million
tonnes. Many potato chip markets around the world have reached maturity. However, in
the UK the market appears to have experienced negative growth in the past few years
(The Grocer, 2005).

Conclusions by Datamonitor indicate an expected upswing in the global potato chip
market from 2.3 to 2.7 million tonnes of product from 2003 to 2008, with a CAGR of
3.2%. In terms of potato utilization, the 2008 figure represents approximately 9.8 million
tonnes.

From a combined CAGR for fries and chips of 3.25%, by 2020 the annual increase in
global potato consumption in processed form compounds from 13% in 2002 to 17.7% by
2020, equivalent to 46.4 million tonnes of raw potatoes. This calculation is based on the
prediction of world potato production in 2020 of 403 million tonnes (Scott et al., 2000)
and on the assumption from historical FAOSTAT data that 65% of production enters the
human food chain.

2.4.3 Drivers

Patterns of food consumption fall into three categories (Guenthner, 2001). At the most
basic level, people eat to survive. Subsistence revolves around a few staples. At the second

Global markets for processed potato products

31

level, people eat to meet energy needs. The diet is likely to incorporate more variety,
including fruit and vegetables, livestock products and some processed foods. At the
third level, which applies in most developed nations, people consume food for pleasure.
Higher levels of disposable income allow more choices, e.g. to pay for ready-prepared
and processed products that appeal on flavour, texture, appearance and convenience.

In developed nations, convenience foods, with their ready availability and ease of
preparation, make a substantial contribution to everyday eating. Societies have evolved to
place larger demands on time spent in the workplace. Both women and men are affected.
Mothers caring for young children are often occupied in full-time jobs. As nations grow
richer, more disposable income becomes available to pay for fast food in restaurants,
home-delivery, ready-meals, snacks and frozen potato products. It is interesting to note
that the trend towards paying higher premiums for the service and pleasure elements
of food has been accompanied by a decline in the proportion of income spent on all
food. According to the UK Office of National Statistics (2005), the typical UK household
spending on food and non-alcoholic beverages has declined from 20% of disposable
income in 1980 to 14% in 2004.

Guenthner (2001) reported a 1995 study of factors affecting the demand for potatoes
and potato products. For snacks, positive demand drivers included consumer income,
meals away from home and advertising. Price and advertising for competing products had
a negative effect. For frozen potato products, positive demand drivers included the price
of fresh potatoes, consumer income, females in the labour force, meals away from home
and advertising. The price of a hamburger and the increasing home use of microwave
ovens had a negative effect.

The 2005 situation in developed nations of the EU and North America may not be so
clear-cut. Issues around nutrition and health have tended to check market growth. The
industry appears to be responding in a positive way, putting its case forward to counteract
some of the myths and misunderstandings, at the same time as introducing a variety of
healthy-eating alternatives.

It is arguable that the McDonald’s Index (MI) provides a snapshot of how the global
industry is progressing. On a country-by-country basis, the MI, as defined by Guenthner
(2001), is the number of thousands of inhabitants in a population per McDonald’s
restaurant. For example in the USA, the MI is 23, meaning that there is a McDonald’s for
every 23 000 people in the population. It has been 23 for quite a few years, indicating
that this is the level achievable in a mature market.

Figure 2.1 compares MI and corresponding GDP for selected nations. In 2004, there
were 31 600 McDonald’s restaurants worldwide for 6.5 billion people, giving an overall
MI of 206. With relatively high GDPs, Scandinavian countries lie above the trend line,
with fewer McDonald’s than might otherwise be anticipated. Italy, Mexico, Russia and
China also fall into this category. Other countries, notably the Philippines, Malaysia, New
Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan have more McDonald’s than expected according to the
level of GDP.

It is tempting to predict that annual changes in the MI reflect the potential expansion
for all potato products, including snacks and frozen potatoes. This assertion relies on
the evidence that CAGR for both fries and chips in world markets are closely similar,

as previously demonstrated. A more refined econometric model to predict expansion in
world markets would probably include the following factors:

(1) Growth in GDP and disposable income.
(2) Predisposition to eat potatoes in the diet.
(3) The availability of suitable potato varieties and growing skills to support a local or

national potato supply.

(4) Population.
(5) Price of potatoes.

In regard to price, evidence cited by Guenthner (2001) indicates that the potato/rice price
ratio declined from 1950 to 1980 in various developing countries, including Thailand (3.9
to 0.8) and Bangladesh (2.4 to 0.7).

2.5 POTATO-PROCESSING COMPANIES AND LOCATIONS

Frito-Lay dominates the world market for potato chips. The company operates approx-
imately 67 plants in 27 countries. Utilization of potatoes specifically for chips formed
from the raw potato exceeds 3.5 million tonnes. When pre-formed potato products are
included, e.g. Baked Lays® and Stax®, Frito-Lay’s estimated potato usage for snacks/chips
increases to 4 million tonnes, representing approximately half of the world total. Frito-Lay
is the only global player in this market.

During the decade 1985–95, Frito-Lay’s policy for expansion could be regarded as
mainly opportunistic, with a major thrust on acquisition of existing snack/chip companies.
During the decade 1995–2005, the plan changed to include building de novo manufactur-
ing facilities in countries where investment in the long term could reap dividends. In the
few years prior to 2005, outlay on new plant and infrastructure was probably highest in

Global markets for processed potato products

33

China, Russia and India. Plans for a start-up in Pakistan are well advanced. Frito-Lay’s
potato chip operations include plants in the USA and Canada (28), Europe, Africa and
Middle East (15), Asia (11), South and Central America (10) and Oceania (3), a total of 65.
The Canadian family-owned company McCain Foods dominates the world market for
frozen potato products, primarily French fries, with a one-third share. According to the
company website, McCain Foods operates 55 plants in 13 countries (not all of which may
be producing French fries). These include Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, France,
India, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa, Spain, the UK and the
USA. McCain Foods markets its products in 110 countries. Coincidentally, this figure
corresponds approximately to the distribution of McDonald’s restaurants in 114 countries.
Other players in the world market include Lamb Weston and the J.R. Simplot Company.
Part of ConAgra Inc., Lamb Weston operates 11 plants worldwide mainly in the USA and
Canada. Lamb Weston has two plants in the Netherlands and one in Turkey. Simplot has
operations in the USA, Canada, Australia and China. It is a major supplier of frozen fries to
McDonald’s worldwide, utilizing approximately 3 million tonnes of potatoes for its products.
Two Dutch companies, Farm Frites and Aviko, process frozen potato products from,
respectively, 1.2 and 1.4 million tonnes of potatoes annually. Both companies have a
manufacturing presence in five countries. One of Aviko’s plants is located in the USA.
Whereas international trade in frozen potato products is significant, trade in snacks
and potato chips is relatively minor. The contrast is accounted for by product specific
gravity (SG). Snacks and chips are characterized by low weight per unit volume resulting
in high transport costs. For French fries, with added value and a somewhat higher weight
per volume than the potato raw material from which they are manufactured, it becomes
more attractive to transport finished goods rather than potatoes. It follows that French
fry factories are almost invariably located close to their raw material sources and that
the finished product may travel long distances to reach the markets. On the contrary, for
potato chip manufacture raw potatoes may be transported long distances, and frequently
cross-national boundaries, whereas finished products have a more limited distribution.

The situation described has an important bearing on future volume expansion in the
international trade for frozen potato products. Guenthner (2001) noted that the trade value
was expanding at the rate of $143 million annually and likely to reach $3 billion in 2007
and $4 billion in 2014. So for the French fry industry, the question of where to build new
plants to meet future demand may be just as crucial as for the chip industry.

2.6 POTATO SUPPLY

2.6.1 Supply chain

A continuing potato supply of acceptable quality for processing into chips and French fries
is critical to success. In the evolving history of the industry, and new-build enterprises
around the globe, a reliable potato supply has always been the first thing to get right.

Increasing involvement by industry technical managers in production chain manage-
ment has become a feature of the global potato-processing industry. This has been
particularly marked during the 1990s, and subsequently. Initially, emphasis was focused

34

Kirkman

on integrating and controlling the sequence of activities and processes in the supply
chain to optimize potato quality for processing. Beyond 2000, the combination of supply,
cost, quality, product safety and environmental care has taken precedence in modern
manufacturing.

Because manufacturers in both sectors require specific varieties to meet demand for
quality, the chain starts with the production of nuclear stock seed potatoes. The processing
companies generally provide guarantees to the producers of nuclear seed to establish a
balanced supply of high-grade seed in the right varieties.

At different stages down the chain,

the companies provide technical support.
Agronomy, bruise control, chemical maturity monitoring (CMM), storage data monitor-
ing and storage management are activities where company technical managers have led
recent innovation. To a greater or lesser extent, expertise is supplemented by technical
managers employed by the individual potato suppliers.

Generally, for the potato chip industry approximately 100% of the potato supply is
contracted. Manufacturers of frozen potato products tend to contract a lower proportion
of their requirement and supplement supplies with free-buy potatoes. The same quality
standards apply in the two situations, but price and potato variety may vary in the latter.
It also follows that there is less direct participation in production chain management by
this sector for some portion of its raw material supplies.

In the UK, potato suppliers to both sectors of the industry must sign up as members of
an approved scheme that assures safe and environmentally friendly production of fruit,
salads and vegetables. The Assured Produce scheme crop protocol for potatoes extends
to 62 pages (Assured Produce Ltd, 2004). Although the main focus is on pesticide usage,
it incorporates recommendations on agronomy and a section on producing potatoes for
processing, which promotes raw material quality for that purpose. The counterpart to the
UK Assured Produce scheme, which is being developed for Europe and the rest of the
world by EU member nations, is EurepGAP (2005).

utilization. However, the majority demand for French fry varieties such as Russet Burbank
and Maris Piper is for table-stock. UK ware production figures of chipping varieties
reflect European usage. Ten per cent of UK seed exports are accounted for by the variety
Hermes, mainly to the Mediterranean and Middle East.

Some processing companies have invested significant effort and resource to breed and
select improved varieties. Frito-Lay has its own potato-breeding programme, based in
Wisconsin. It supplies new varieties for regional evaluation around the globe. McCain’s
strategy is to collaborate with various breeding partners to meet specific regional require-
ments for superior raw material to feed its factories.

In both cases, an underlying objective is proprietary ownership, creating the possibility
for competitive advantage. With about 80% proprietary usage in the USA and Canada,
Frito-Lay has realized its ambition for that region. Frito-Lay varieties are also making
significant inroads in other regions, notably Asia, Oceania and Latin America. But in
Europe, different disease pressures, consumer preference for yellow chips and competition
from established varieties represent significant challenges.

Potato breeding is a hard grind. Usually, it takes 15 years from an initial parental
crossing to commercialization, at which point a few thousand tonnes of a successful
variety will be making its way into commercial processing. Accelerating the process, for
example, by applying progeny selection to identify superior crosses, probably works to
cut down the timescale by a few years. Accelerating the process by massively expanding
the nuclear seed of a promising variety in the early stages of evaluation (e.g. through
state-of-the-art minituber production) is fraught with the risk of serious financial exposure.
Even so, a few examples can be cited where this strategy has been successful.

To reiterate the point, breeding successful potato varieties is a big challenge. Using a
gross average, each sector can reasonably expect one new variety to enter commercializa-
tion every decade. Table 2.1 demonstrates that in a historical context, varieties in current
use for processing originated over an extended timescale.

The list of varieties in current use is incomplete. For example, Bintje and Agria are
used widely in mainland Europe for French fry manufacture. Asterix, Innovator, Markies,

Lady Olympia and Victoria are also used to some extent. New US varieties for French
fry production include Bannock Russet, Gem Russet and Ranger Russet. Russet Burbank
appears to be in decline, most probably reflecting a change in table-stock usage in favour
of newer varieties with improved uniformity and disease resistance. Atlantic also appears
to be in decline, supplanted mainly by Frito-Lay varieties. However, this variety is still
utilized extensively for production of chips in Asia, Latin America and some Middle
Eastern countries.

A substantial breeding effort to develop superior processing varieties continues in addi-
tion to the proprietary programmes previously mentioned. In North America, the USDA,
Ag Canada and several universities and institutions participate. In Europe, privately
owned breeding companies, which have devoted significant effort to breeding for chips
and French fries, include HZPC, Agrico, Meijer, Solana, Norika, Böhm-Nordkartoffel
and Germicopa.

2.7 POTATO COST

2.7.1 Theory and practice

There appear to be two situations that characterize the evolution from small to large
volumes of potatoes utilized by different sectors of the processing industry. The first is
historical and follows the pattern below:

Stage 1. One or a few buyers, few suppliers.
Stage 2. Few buyers, many suppliers.
Stage 3. Many buyers, many suppliers.
Stage 4. One or a few buyers, few suppliers.

This sequence broadly reflects the development of the potato-processing industry in the
USA and the UK. Development of the French fry industry has been concentrated into the
last 50 years to 2005, whereas the chip industry developed over a longer timescale. In the
early years, for both sectors of the processing industry, price paid for potatoes tended to
be higher than in the later stages. Even within the period 1995–2005, price of chipping
potatoes in both the USA and the UK has declined in real terms. The same trend probably
also applies to the price of potatoes for French fries.

The second situation where potato processing has the potential to evolve from small
to large volumes is ‘green-field’ manufacturing, usually new plant in developing nations
where either indigenous production is small and fragmented or non-existent. Again, high
prices are paid for potatoes initially, although the starting position is more typically with
one buyer and many suppliers.

As time progresses, declining price may be attributed to agronomic improvements
leading to enhanced yield and to the consolidation of suppliers to provide economies
of scale. In the UK since 1960, yield has increased from an average for all maincrop
potatoes of 25 to 45 tonnes per hectare in 2005. In the USA, similar yield improve-
ments have occurred. Also, the supplier base to the processing companies has declined.

38

Kirkman

For example, by 2005 in both nations, fewer than 20 suppliers to Frito-Lay supported
80% of the company’s requirements.

Guenthner (2001) has discussed commoditization. The acid test to determine whether
an item of trade is a commodity is whether price in real terms (adjusted by the retail
price index) declines in time. Potatoes supplied to the processing industries in mature and
maturing markets behave as a commodity. Other potatoes (not including seed potatoes)
also behave in this way. Product differentiation is not possible, particularly in the light
of the fact that processing companies drive for uniformity and consistency of supply.

In developed nations, the cost of potato production tends to be higher than for other
arable crops, not least because the contribution of mechanization is typically around 30%
of (fixed + variable) costs. Potato machinery is expensive single-purpose equipment,
which requires significant investment in purchasing, insurance, maintenance and repair.
Asset fixity locks growers into their potato-growing enterprises, and it is not a realistic
option to grow for other markets if the price on offer from the processors does not
appeal. Little if any negotiating power on price resides with the growers. The situation
stimulates cost efficiency and eliminates numbers of growers who cannot compete. But
the beginning and end points in the historical record characterized by one or a few buyers
and a few suppliers occur for very different reasons.

Superficially, the price outlook for potato suppliers to the processing industry does not
appear encouraging. However, other factors compensate. These revolve around balancing
supply and demand through contracts, bonus payments on good performance and an
unwritten rule that purchasing managers in the processing companies should reckon on a
supplier’s profit margin of 15%.

2.7.2 Contracts

The processing industry is vertically integrated through the use of production contracts
between growers and processors. As a generalization, the chip industry contracts approx-
imately 100% of its potato supply, whereas manufacturers of frozen potato products
contract upwards of 70%. Contracts co-ordinate a changing periodic supply of specific
varieties and ensure that quality standards are upheld.

The benefit of contracting to growers is market security and income stability. They
are not exposed to price volatility, which characterizes the free market. In addition,
potato suppliers to the processing industry benefit from technology transfer of new and
sometimes novel scientific and technical applications to different stages of the production
chain relevant to supply, cost, quality, product safety and environmental care.

There is no universal model for contracting across the globe by either sector of the
industry. Indeed, it is likely that one or another global player will contract in different
ways in different locations, depending on market maturity and the implications for supply
and quality. However, in general the chip industry contracts at a base-price, which
increases according to delivery times from fresh harvest through late storage. Different
chip manufacturers differ on whether to pay a quality bonus, and if so on what basis. Most
commonly, bonus payments focus on chip colour defects and dry matter concentration.
Risk of rejection occurs below 20% dry matter concentration or above 15% colour defects
in the finished product.

Global markets for processed potato products

39

One UK manufacturer of chips pays a bonus on freedom from colour defects, with
different levels applicable during different periods of supply. Fresh supply has attracted a
bonus of up to 9% of the base-price below 6% defects. From the middle and late storage
periods, up to 18% of the base-price (adjusted for storage interval) could be paid, the
amounts increasing to the maximum of 18% as defect incidence declines below 10%.

Potato supplies for French fry manufacture are bonused or penalized (with a price
reduction subtracted from the base-price) on the basis of several potato quality charac-
teristics that influence factory yields and quality of the finished product. For example,
for the variety Shepody, one UK manufacturer pays a composite bonus based on the
following:

(1) Tuber dry matter concentration (too high or too low is penalized, bonus points for

the middle range).

(2) Tuber count per 10 kg (an indicator of tuber size distribution).
(3) Percentage of tubers >75 mm in length (low numbers penalized, higher numbers

attract bonus points).

(4) Potato defects.
(5) Fry colours.

The possibility of attracting bonus points or penalties is highest for fry colours and potato
defects. Potato defects are measured at factory intake and include greening, bruising,
growth cracks, secondary growth, pitted scab and damage due to mechanical harvesting,
slugs, grubs or frost. The company reserves its right to reject loads of potatoes that do
not meet specification on the basis of a low cumulative points score or on the basis of
serious deviations in tuber count, fry colour or tuber dry matter concentration. Variety
mix is another reason for rejection.

In the above example, differing prices and schedules apply to different varieties, which
adds a level of complexity missing from the more straightforward approach by the chip
industry. However, it is clear from the examples cited that bonuses, penalties and rejection
risk combine together to enhance uniformity, quality and output of the manufacturing
process. Growers are rewarded for good performance.

2.8 POTATO QUALITY

2.8.1 Introduction

A great deal has been written about potato quality requirements for the potato-processing
industry (e.g. Talburt and Smith, 1987; Gould, 1999). Quality parameters are fixed and
have varied little over time or across manufacturing regions.

2.8.2 Tuber shape, size and dry matter composition

In regard to tuber shape, the industry standard for chips is round to short-oval. A long-
axis to transverse-axis ratio of 1.25:1 is acceptable; 1.33:1 is borderline, whereas 1.5:1

40

Kirkman

is unacceptable. The ratios refer to variety characteristics as a mean value, not to natural
variations in shape which may occur within a variety. Tubers should be uniform and
not excessively disfigured by secondary growth, infolded ends or growth cracks. In the
UK and most of Europe, the size range 40–95 mm is acceptable for chip manufacture.
Indicative tuber counts per 10 kg should fall within the range 72–112. In the USA, the
acceptable size range is 45–105 mm, with no indicative tuber count.

In the UK, premium French fry manufacture is based on long tubers, with incremental
bonus points being paid on long varieties such as Shepody and Russet Burbank for the
proportion of tubers above 75 mm. Other varieties such as Maris Piper and Morene, whose
shape characteristic is round-oval, attract a bonus based on tuber width (transverse axis)
greater than 70 mm. Potatoes are acceptable with the transverse axis as little as 50 mm.
Penalties are incurred for the proportion of a factory delivery that has the transverse axis
less than 50 mm. If this exceeds 12%, outright rejection may ensue. The acceptable tuber
count range is 34–67 per 10 kg.

For both sides of the industry, dry matter concentration is a critical component of
efficiency in manufacturing. For example, a 0.005 increase in SG yields an extra kilogram
of chips per 100 kg finished product (Gould, 1999). Generally, the cut-off below which
factory deliveries are not acceptable is 19.5% dry matter (cid:2)SG = 1(cid:3)077(cid:4) for French fries
and 20% dry matter (cid:2)SG = 1(cid:3)079(cid:4) for chips. Upper limits do not apply, though penalties
may be incurred for >25% dry matter (cid:2)SG = 1(cid:3)103(cid:4) in French fry manufacture.

2.8.3 Blemishing diseases and disorders

Any disease or disorder that leads to undesirable colour, e.g. brown or black spots and
marks in the finished product, or a reduction in process efficiency may lead to penalties or
rejection of the potatoes for processing. Generally, varieties in current use for processing
are resilient, if not wholly resistant to blemishing diseases and disorders. Inevitably, each
variety has it own specific susceptibilities, and no variety is perfect.

For example, a consideration of European chipping varieties reveals that Hermes grown
in Mediterranean countries can be afflicted by high levels of Potato Virus YNTN, causing
internal necrosis. Also causing internal necrosis, Potato Mop Top Virus (PMTV), vec-
tored by Powdery Scab (Spongospora subterranea), has been a feature of Scandinavian
Saturna production. In the worst years, up to a third of the crop can be affected. The
control of Rhizoctonia in seed potatoes of Lady Rosetta is crucial. In the ware crop of
Lady Rosetta, Rhizoctonia leads to deep fissures and infolded ends, which create inefficien-
cies in manufacturing. Atlantic, the world standard for chipping, can suffer extensive damage
from deep-pitted scab and hollow heart. Shape disorders in tubers of Russet Burbank, the
world standard for French fry manufacture, constitute the biggest problem for the variety.

Occasionally, a new disease becomes prevalent. Such is the case with ‘zebra chip’
defect thought to be caused by a phytoplasma, with sporadic outbreaks in Mexico, Texas,
Colorado, Kansas and North Dakota (Potato Review, 2005). It has affected some of the
most popular Frito-Lay varieties, Atlantic and commonly grown table-stock varieties.

Defects arising from mechanical damage and bruising, incurred during harvesting, are
commonplace. The causes are well understood. Advances in technology and management
practices have combined in recent years to minimize the problem.

Global markets for processed potato products

2.8.4 Sugars and fry colours

Arguably, the biggest problem for potato processing revolves around meeting consumer
preference on fry colour. For both sectors of the industry, this is ‘light-golden’. The
industry standard defining colour for chips is based on the measurement of ‘L-value’,
and for French fries, it is based on Agtron measurement of fry colour in strips of fried
potato, referenced to a USDA chart.

Fry colours are defined exactly by the reducing sugar concentration in tubers. A great
deal of understanding has been developed by the industry from 1980 onwards about most,
if not all, of the factors that contribute to fry colour variability.

(1) Variety characteristics.
(2) Agronomic and meteorological conditions prevailing during the growth period.
(3) Maturity at harvest.
(4) Storage temperature regime.
(5) Ethylene in the storage atmosphere.

In practical terms, items (3) and (5) are probably the most interesting, for the reason that
trends in current practice have reaped significant rewards.

In the chip industry, CMM is the term given to measuring sucrose and glucose con-
centration of tubers during a 4-week period in the run-up to harvest (Sowokinos and
Preston, 1988). An estimate of preferred storage treatment can then be defined. Immature
crops can be pre-conditioned at a higher temperature over a longer period; crops with low
and stable sugars can be placed in storage for the long term. It is important to continue
monitoring sugar levels frequently during storage. The trend lines for glucose, sucrose,
fry colour and the incidence of colour defects can then be used to order and re-order
the sequence of store unloading. The aim is to optimize quality, enhance manufacturing
efficiency and reward suppliers for good performance. CMM finds application mainly in
temperate and continental climates.

It came to light during the British Potato Council’s sponsored research on the sprout
suppressant CIPC at Glasgow University (Dowd, 2004) that fry colours are deleteriously
affected by ethylene, which occurs as a by-product of the combustion process in thermal
fogging. The recommendation from this research was to ventilate within a maximum
8-hour interval after fogging. This has become an industry standard and provided signif-
icant benefit to the processing companies.

2.9 CURRENT ISSUES AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

2.9.1 Acrylamide

In 2002 a surprise discovery was made by Swedish researchers that significant levels of
acrylamide occur in a variety of common foodstuffs, including chips and French fries.
This led to a food scare, which temporarily impacted sales of processed potato products
in a number of European countries. At the time, the currently available toxicological data

42

Kirkman

indicated that acrylamide might be directly or indirectly carcinogenic. In the meantime,
numerous studies have failed to confirm the relevance of this claim to the relatively low
dietary exposure level to acrylamide, compared for example with occupational exposure.
Nor in the latter context have case studies revealed enhanced risk.

Acrylamide is encountered in a range of foods and food products, resulting from
the Maillard reaction between asparagine and reducing sugars during frying, baking and
roasting. In potatoes, asparagine and glutamine are the main components of the free amino
acid pool and occur in several-fold molar excess to the typical concentration of reducing
sugars found in processing potato varieties (Duncan and Hardie, 2003). Therefore, the
reducing sugar concentration is limiting. Practical measures to minimize reducing sugars
can help to lower acrylamide concentration in finished products. Other mitigation steps
that can be taken are detailed in ‘The CIAA Acrylamide Toolbox’ (Confederation of the
European Food & Drink Industries, 2005).

2.9.2 Obesity

In the context of obesity, processed potato products continue to suffer bad press due to the
perception that trends towards increased snacking and consumption of fast food, coupled
with competitive advertising, and appeal to the child market are somehow responsible. The
World Health Organisation (2005) cites a figure of 1.2 billion adults overweight (one-sixth
of the world’s population), 30% of whom are clinically obese. The consequences for health
and well-being relate to chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
hypertension, stroke and certain forms of cancer. It cannot be denied that processed potato
products tend to be energy-dense. But it is interesting to compare obesity rates with the
MI to discover whether a correlation exists.

From Fig. 2.6, there appears to be no correlation. Some nations with relatively low
obesity levels in the population, e.g. Japan (3.2%) and Sweden (9.7%) with MIs, respec-
tively, of one restaurant per 28 000 and one per 40 000, have relatively high numbers of
McDonald’s outlets. Conversely, Mexico, the Slovak Republic and Greece have obesity
rates above 20%, with MIs of 521, 540 and 223, respectively. It was previously argued
in this chapter that MI is indicative of the more general predilection in a population for

snacks and fast food. World Health Organisation (2005) identified increased consumption
of energy-dense foods high in saturated fats as a primary factor in the obesity pan-
demic. Clearly, a number of factors must be at work. The situation is complex, and
potato-processing companies are actively engaged in the current dialogue.

At first sight, it may seem paradoxical that the global chip and fast-food industries are
investing to establish new businesses in developing nations, where hunger may prevail
in a significant part of the population. J. Guenthner (personal communication) takes the
view that from an industry perspective the problems with mature markets and concerns
about obesity are somewhat offset by opportunities for market expansion in developing
countries. In addition to making new ‘better-for-you’ products for those concerned about
obesity, the industry can also focus on target markets where current concerns are different.
Scott et al. (2000) predicted a more rapid expansion of potato consumption in developing
countries. A growing predilection for potatoes in the diet is one of the drivers for expansion
in the market for processed potatoes. As economies develop, so will the demand for
processed potatoes, concomitant with growth in GDP and disposable income.

2.9.3 Nutritional value

Whereas, in general, the nutritional profile of processed potatoes has few deficiencies,
future developments are likely to see an increasing diversification of products to provide
healthy-eating alternatives. Global manufacturers are engaged in reformulations and new
product development to meet the challenge. Trans-fats have been mostly eliminated.
A range of low-fat and fat composition changes has recently been launched. For snack
manufacturers, frying in olive oil, high-oleic sunflower oil or zero calorie olestra has led
to new products. Salt levels have been reduced.

The possibilities envisaged by biotechnologists to engineer components of potatoes,
vegetable oils and flavours to provide consumer benefits cannot be disregarded. The com-
position and content of starch in relation to the glycaemic index, vitamins, antioxidants,
proteins, free amino acids, reducing sugars and the reduction of glycoalkaloids could
provide legitimate targets aimed at consumers of processed potato products through the
first few decades of the 21st century.

The seed potato market

Kees D. van Loon

Oostrandpark 103, 8212 AT Lelystad, The Netherlands

For the production of potatoes, generally, seed tubers are used. If these are larger than
about 25 mm in diameter, they are indicated as conventional seed tubers. However in
recent years also mini-tubers, that have been derived from in vitro plantlets, are used in
the first phase of potato seed multiplication programmes. Furthermore, true potato seed
(TPS) is also used, on a limited scale, by direct sowing in the field or by sowing it in
beds to raise seedlings that either can be transplanted into the field or grown in nurseries
for the production of small seedling tubers that are to be used as seed in the next season.

3.1 SEED TUBERS

Seed potatoes are produced everywhere potatoes are grown. However, in many cases part
of the ware crop – often the small tubers – are used for this purpose. Such seed is often
of a poor quality. Good quality seed needs to be grown specifically for this purpose.
This implies use of healthy (certified) initial seed, land free from soil-borne diseases and
special care being taken in the control of diseases and pests during the growing season.
The product should then be inspected by a certification agency.

Difficulties in the production of good quality seed potatoes include:

• Unsuitable climatic conditions
• The presence of many aphids during the growing season
• The presence of soil-borne diseases and pests
• Lack of a well-organized seed certification agency

An outstanding problem in potato seed production is the relatively high degeneration
rate of initially healthy seed. In many regions, it will only take two or three multiplications
to result in poor quality seed. In a seed programme based on clonal selection, 8–10
years of production are required before larger commercial quantities are available. In
many potato-growing countries, phytosanitary conditions are such that it is not possible
to keep the seed potatoes healthy for such a long period. In such countries, quality seed
is produced by making use of rapid multiplication techniques, allowing the production of
commercial quantities in 3–4 years, or quality seed is imported.

In countries without an adequate supply of certified seed, there are often ‘traditional’
seed producing areas, e.g. at higher elevation, where there is slower degeneration because

of fewer aphids transmitting virus diseases. Seed produced in these areas is of better
quality than from other areas (Beukema and van der Zaag, 1990; Dongyu et al., 2004).
Ware potato growers in such countries may buy seed from ‘traditional’ areas to refresh
their own stock and use this for the production of ware potatoes or for multiplication as
seed for a next crop.

In summary, growers of ware and starch potatoes are making use of seed from four

basic seed sources:
• Home-grown certified seed
• Imported certified seed
• Home-grown, but not certified seed
• Self-produced (un)certified seed

In most countries, two or more of these sources are used.

In developing countries, especially sufficient certified seed is often not available. But
also in Western Europe, there are potato-producing countries that import large amounts
of seed potatoes, e.g. Italy, Spain, France and others. The reason, often, is unfavourable
conditions for (basic) seed production. Also the lack of specific cultivars can be a reason
for importing seed. Switzerland only imports basic seed. This is multiplied to produce
certified seed to be used by ware potato growers. The Swiss deem the conditions for
the production of basic seed insufficient in their country. In Greece, until the end of the
1990s only 20–25% of the seed used by ware potato growers was certified (Grigoriadou
and Leventakis, 1999).

3.2 SEED MARKET

3.2.1 ‘Conventional’ seed tubers

The most important characteristic of a seed potato is its quality. The most important
quality characteristics of potato seed are as follows:
• Freedom from diseases and pests: The seed should be free from quarantine diseases
such as wart disease, ring rot and brown rot, and the contamination levels of other,
less detrimental diseases such as virus diseases, bacterial diseases (Erwinia spp.) and
fungal diseases such as Black scurf, common scab, and silver scurf should be low. For
basic seed that will be further multiplied, a higher health standard is required than for
certified seed, that is used for the immediate production of ware or starch potatoes.
• Growth vigour of the seed: Defined as the potential of a tuber to produce sprouts and
plants under conditions favourable for growth (Van der Zaag and van Loon, 1987).
If the seed is planted within a few months after harvest, the vigour of growth is
suboptimal. The same is true for seed that has been stored for a long period, especially
if at high temperatures.
• Seed size: The value of small tubers with a certain health standard is greater than that
of big tubers. The reason is that small tubers will produce more stems per unit of
weight than large tubers, as is shown in Table 3.1.

The price of seed potatoes mainly depends on supply and demand. Other factors are
the seed grade – basic seed (better health status) has a higher price than certified seed;
the appearance of the seed tubers – users generally prefer, and will pay a higher price
for, clean tubers with a smooth skin; the provenance of the seed – there are countries
and regions within countries with a better quality image for seed potatoes than others;
tuber size – in some countries, e.g. The Netherlands, tubers of certain sizes, e.g. size
28–35 mm, are much more expensive per kg than tubers of size 45–50 mm because of a
higher seed value (Table 3.1).

3.2.1.1 Domestic market

In developed countries, most farmers buy certified seed potatoes as seed source for the
production of ware and starch potatoes. Other farmers buy each year an amount of basic
seed on the market and multiply this on their own farm. The harvest is used in the next
season as seed, for e.g., ware production. In The Netherlands, farmers of ware potatoes
are legally obliged to use only certified seed. They are allowed to multiply basic seed on
their own farm but only if this is inspected and certified by the official seed agency.

In the present seed market, cultivars protected by breeder’s rights play a dominant role.
Only the possessor of the rights and his licensees are allowed to sell seed potatoes of
these cultivars. The owner of the breeder’s rights determines the acreage of seed potatoes
to be grown. For very popular cultivars, this can be a tool to keep prices high. Only for
cultivars of which the breeder’s rights have expired, free competition among merchants
is possible.1

Most developing countries do not have a large domestic potato seed market. If there
is a seed potato multiplication programme in the country, often only relatively small
quantities of certified seed are made available. Moreover, the quality of this seed is not
always meeting the requirements of potato farmers, so they prefer, if available, imported

1 Breeder’s rights are acknowledged in countries that have ratified the Convention of the International Union for
the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) (at the end of 2004, 58 countries). States wanting to accede
to the UPOV Convention have laws on plant variety protection in line with the 1991 Act of the Convention.
That means that they recognize breeder’s rights (duration for potatoes at least 20 years) and accept to pay levies
to the breeder when growing his cultivar for seed (Jördens, 2000).

seed. If no better alternatives are available, farmers try to buy seed from ‘healthy’ regions
or from colleagues who are specializing in the production of seed potatoes.

3.2.1.2 International market

Apart from home-grown seed, many developed countries import basic and certified seed
(Table 3.2).

Basic seed is mostly used for further multiplication, certified seed for the production
of ware and starch potatoes. In Western Europe, Italy, Spain, France and Germany are
large importers of potato seed. Countries such as France and Germany both have a
rather extensive seed production themselves. One of the reasons for importation of seed
in these countries is that they want specific cultivars that are protected by breeder’s
rights elsewhere. Other reasons can be, the imported seed is of a better quality and less
favourable conditions for several multiplications of seed in the field. In such cases, basic
seed is imported to be multiplied once or twice.

In developing countries, where potatoes are an important crop, also large amounts of
seed potatoes are imported from mainly European countries. In other parts of the world,
only Canada is exporting considerable quantities of seed (Table 3.3), mainly to Central
and South America.

Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia are the main importing countries of seed potatoes
in this group. Although these countries are trying to become more self-sufficient for
seed potatoes, it appears to be very difficult under their growing conditions to reach a
satisfactory level of quality. During the past 20 years, hardly any extension of potato seed
production has occurred in these countries.

In sub-tropical and tropical regions, it is often possible to grow potatoes twice a year
or even more frequently. Countries in these regions import seed potatoes for ware potato
production in spring and summer. However, seed for the autumn season is produced by
multiplying imported basic seed planted in winter or spring.

The main seed potato exporting countries in the world are Canada, France, The
Netherlands and the UK, of which The Netherlands are by far the largest exporter
(Table 3.3). The Netherlands have relatively favourable climatic and growing conditions
for the production of healthy seed; they have a large number of cultivars and a good
infrastructure for storage, handling and exporting of seed potatoes.

There is a very large number of cultivars exported by the countries mentioned previ-
ously. However, the following cultivars produced in Europe are among the most popular:
Désirée, Spunta, Monalisa, Bintje, Agria, Maris Piper and Cara. In North America, cul-
tivars such as Russet Burbank, Shepody and Yukon Gold are among the most exported
cultivars.

3.2.2 Mini-tubers

New rapid multiplication techniques for the production of mini-tubers are based on tissue
culture, e.g. the use of hydroponics, and allow the relatively cheap mass production of
tuberlets. The hydroponic technique consists of the production of mini-tubers by repeated
harvesting on liquid cultures in a greenhouse.

Mini-tubers often have a diameter of 5–20 mm and weigh 0.5–5 g. Provided that the
initial plant material was free from diseases, including latent ones, these mini-tubers can
be used as pre-basic seed. In many countries, healthy mini-tubers are the basis for seed
multiplication programmes, as this reduces the number of multiplications and hence the
risk of contamination with diseases and pests in the field. More details on the production
of mini-tubers are given in Chapter 32 (Millam and Sharma, this volume).

In recent years, an international market has developed for this type of pre-basic seed.
An Australian/Indian company, with branches in a number of countries, is market leader
at present. This company is mainly producing in and for Asian countries.

3.2.3 True potato seed

Since the beginning of the 1980s, ware potato production based on TPS has been adopted
in a number of developing countries such as India, Bangladesh and Vietnam (Almekinders
et al., 1996). In 1999 in Vietnam, 10% of the total potato area was planted with TPS-
derived seedlings (Fuglie et al., 2001). Use of TPS is cheaper than seed tubers of the same
health status. There are no storage costs, and transportation costs are much lower than
those of seed tubers, particularly where transportation is to distant, inaccessible regions
(Almekinders et al., 1996).

It soon proved that production of seedling tubers on nursery beds gave better results
than direct drilling in the field or transplanting into the field from nursery beds (Wiersema,
1986). Although the technology has been adopted by farmers among a number of potato-
producing countries mainly in Asia, there has not been a major breakthrough until now.
One of the major drawbacks of TPS is its heterogeneity in tuber quality. Moreover, tuber
size is often small. Nowadays, hybrid seed is almost always used at a rate of 120–350 g
per ha (Fuglie et al., 2001). Chilver et al. (1999) concluded that widespread geographic
applicability of TPS is not to be expected, even in India where breeding for TPS families
has been applied since the early 1980s. Potential for TPS is greatest when seed costs
exceed 20% of the production value.

Most TPS is produced in India and Chile. An indicative price for TPS is US$600–800

per kg (Fuglie et al., 2001).

3.3 BARRIERS TO MARKETS IN SEED POTATOES

On the international market for seed potatoes, there are a number of barriers hampering
trade. The most important are the presence of quarantine pests and diseases and also
non-quarantine ones in seed potatoes. Other restrictions include required absence of soil,
etc. and the breeder’s rights.

3.3.1 Quarantine diseases and pests

Many countries do not allow seed potatoes to enter the country if they are contaminated
with a quarantine disease or pest. Quarantine organisms have been internationally defined
as ‘a pest of potential economic importance to the area endangered thereby and not yet
present, or present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled’ (Duringhof,
2000). The European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) of which
all countries in these regions are a member has two lists of quarantine diseases and pests,
A1 with diseases and pests not present in the EPPO region and A2 containing diseases
and pests already introduced into parts of the EPPO region.

Potato diseases and pests figuring on these lists include Potato smut (Thecaphora solani),
False root knot nematode (Nacobbus aberrans) (A1), Tomato spotted wilt virus, Potato
tuber spindle viroid, brown rot (Ralstonia solanacearum), ring rot (Clavibacter michiga-
nensis subsp. sepedonicus), wart disease (Synchitrium endobioticum), White potato cyst

51

nematode (Globodera pallida), Root knot nematode (Meloidogyne chitwoodi/fallax) and
Colorado beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) (A2) (OEPP/EPPO, 2004).

Importing countries normally do not allow consignments of potatoes containing quar-
antine diseases to enter the country. Even the presence of a quarantine disease in just
one region of an exporting country can be a reason for other countries not to accept seed
potatoes from there.

3.3.2 Non-quarantine diseases and pests

Most seed importing countries are setting their own phytosanitary standards for dis-
eases such as common scab (Streptomyces scabies), black scurf (Rhizoctonia solani) and
silver scurf (Helminthosporium solani). Some importing countries have the seed potatoes
inspected by their own inspectors at the port of the exporting country prior to shipping,
to avoid refusal at the port of destination, causing extra costs.

3.3.3 Breeder’s rights

Breeder’s rights may prevent export of protected cultivars to countries that have not
ratified the UPOV convention. In this case, the breeder risks multiplication of seed of
his cultivar without receiving royalties. As a consequence, he will be reluctant to export
seed potatoes to such countries.

4.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter, we look at the results of analyses of molecular data sets that have been
used to answer questions on the taxonomy of the group of tuber-bearing Solanum spp.,
Solanum sect. Petota, the cultivated potato and its wild relatives.

4.2 TAXONOMIC BACKGROUND

4.2.1 Wild and cultivated potatoes

The cultivated potato is an unusual crop in that it has an extremely large secondary
genepool consisting of related wild species that are tuber-bearing, albeit with small unedi-
ble tubers. The taxonomy of the cultivated potato and its wild relatives has been the subject
of study for many years. Most of these studies relied on morphological observations and,
on a limited scale, experimental methods like cytogenetics and hybridization experiments.
More than 200 species have been described and many infraspecific taxa. These taxa have
been classified in series, with different authors recognizing different numbers of series,
often with different circumscriptions. Two authorative treatments (Correll, 1962; Hawkes,
1990) recognized 26 and 21 series, respectively (Table 4.1). Hawkes (1989) suggested a
division of the series into two superseries, Stellata and Rotata, emphasizing the outline
of the corolla as a major distinctive character.

Some of the series contain only one or just a few species, indicating that their rela-
tionship to the other species is not clear. On the contrary, series such as Piurana and,
especially, Tuberosa, are large groups of species that may not be closely related to
each other.

Hijmans and Spooner (2001) and Hijmans et al. (2002) documented the geographic
distribution of wild potato species, with the majority occurring in Argentina, Bolivia,
Mexico and Peru, many with only restricted distribution areas.

There is a polyploid series present with diploids, triploids, tetraploids, pentaploids
and hexaploids. The polyploids are considered to be allopolyploids derived from hyb-
dridization events involving 2n gametes (Chapter 10, Gavrilenko, this volume). The odd-
numbered polyploids, while mostly sterile, are able to maintain themselves vegetatively
through the tubers.

The cultivated potato, Solanum tuberosum L., is accommodated in series Tuberosa,
a rather large and variable group without clear diagnostic characters. The link between
wild and cultivated potatoes, the direct ancestors of the crop, must be looked for in the
so-called brevicaule complex, a group of morphologically variable, diploid species within
series Tuberosa. Within this complex, about 20 species have been distinguished, but
Ugent (1966) suggested that these could be drastically reduced to one species (Solanum
brevicaule) and Van den Berg et al. (1998) by and large confirmed that conclusion.
Morphologically, many of the wild species in the brevicaule complex are similar to
some of the cultivated potatoes, the main differences being found in leaf dissection, in
corolla colour and – obviously – in the tuber. The origin of the cultivated potatoes has
been described as the result of successive hybridizations between diploid members of
the brevicaule complex, accompanied by chromosome doubling leading to the tetraploid
forms. The crop itself has been classified into seven cultivated species (Solanum ajanhuiri,

several ploidy levels. The discussion about the taxonomic status of cultivated plant
material (Hetterscheid and Brandenburg, 1995) suggests that the taxon ‘species’ (with
its connotation of a product resulting from evolutionary processes) is not suitable for
the classification of cultivated plants as the influence of humans seriously disturbs the
patterns of variation used to classify species. Rather, cultivated material should be treated
as artificial entities such as landraces or cultivars and classified into cultivar-groups
as advocated in the International Code of Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants (ICNCP,
2004). This was anticipated by Dodds (1962), who, in an appendix to Correll’s book,
suggested the informal groups Stenotomum, Phureja, Chaucha, Andigena and Tuberosum
within the species S. tuberosum to accommodate the cultivated potatoes. Huaman and
Spooner (2002) suggested a similar solution with eight groups (Ajanhuiri, Juzepczukii,
Curtilobum, Chilotanum, Andigenum, Chaucha, Phureja and Stenotomum).

The crop ‘potato’, making up the total of these groups, can still be assigned to the
‘species’ S. tuberosum, if so desired. This species name should then be considered as
a cultigen (a species consisting of cultivated plants only, and as such without wild
representatives, without a natural geographic distribution area and without a natural
population structure). If the six other species names are used, these too are to be considered
as cultigens (Table 4.2).

4.2.2 The evolutionary framework

The place of origin of the group of tuber-bearing potato species has been suggested to be
the Mexican/Central American area, where those species are found that are considered
to be phylogenetically primitive. These species are diploids, with stellate corollas and an
endosperm balance number (EBN) of 1 (EBN refers to a genetic isolating mechanism that
allows crosses between species with the same EBN and prevents crosses between different
EBN groups; there are five combinations of ploidy level and EBN that determine cross-
ability groups: 2x/EBN1, 2x/EBN2, 4x/EBN2, 4x/EBN4 and 6x/EBN4; Hawkes, 1990).

van den Berg and Jacobs

The further history of the group has been principally determined by two migrations across
the landbridge between North and South America. A first migration southward from the
Mexican/Central American area introduced the diploid tuber-bearing species to the vari-
ety of niches available in the South American continent, especially those in the mountain
range of the Andes. This provoked a rapid speciation, producing the numerous species
now occurring in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. This speciation was accompanied
by an increase in EBN and chromosome doubling. Morphologically, the corolla shape
developed from stellate to rotate. A northward migration led to the establishment of poly-
ploid species of the series Conicibaccata in Central America and, finally, to the derived
polyploids nowadays found in Mexico, which include the well-known hexaploid species
Solanum demissum.

The cultivated forms originated in the area around lake Titicaca, on the border of Peru

and Bolivia, where several members of the brevicaule complex still occur.

4.2.3 Remaining taxonomic problems

Much of what is known about the taxonomy of potato is due to the work of two formidable
taxonomists, Jack Hawkes and Carlos Ochoa. They described numerous species, classified
them in series and provided keys based on morphological characters. However, these
keys are generally difficult to apply because of the extensive variability in characters such
as leaf dissection, pubescence and corolla colour. Many described species are extremely
similar to each other, and the group of tuber-bearing Solanum spp. seems to be somewhat
over-classified, with the application of a rather narrow typological species concept, where
all deviations from the ‘typical’ habit are considered to be due to hybridization. Although
hybridization within EBN groups is certainly taking place, another approach would be the
recognition of a smaller number of broader circumscribed species, applying a polythetic
species concept that allows overlap of character states among species. In certain groups,
there is a lack of distinctive characters and species boundaries are difficult to trace.
Especially the interaction between wild and cultivated forms and the influence of human
selection have obscured species boundaries, and in some cases, described species might
be weedy relatives of cultivated plants or escapes from cultivation.

Also, the series classification is problematic, with some series difficult to distinguish
from each other and others containing subgroups that could be distinguished as separate
series. Consistent with work in other groups within the genus Solanum (Knapp, 1991,
2000), it would be advisable to apply the informal concept of ‘species groups’ instead of
the formal taxon ‘series’.

The advance of molecular methods has offered the hope to arrive at solutions of the
aforementioned problems and improve our understanding of the taxonomy of the potato.

4.3 MOLECULAR DATA

4.3.1 Molecular markers applied to tuber-bearing Solanum spp.

The available morphological data on potato species have been supplemented with
data from cytology, serology, isozymes and several types of DNA data. The cytological

Molecular taxonomy

59

data have helped in acquiring more insight into the origin and distribution of polyploids
in the group (Swaminathan and Howard, 1953), the serological data gave indications
of interrelationships among groups of species but were difficult to interpret (Lester,
1965) and the isozyme data provided valuable information mainly on the diversity of the
cultivated forms (Quiros and McHale, 1985; Douches and Quiros, 1988).

DNA data are basically in one of two types: restriction site and primer-based data
[restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), random amplified polymorphic DNA
(RAPD), amplified fragment
length polymorphism (AFLP), simple sequence repeat
(SSR); Chapter 5, Gebhardt, this volume], giving genome-wide, multilocus information
and sequence data providing detailed, single locus information on only a small part of
the genome. There is a strong relationship between the level of variability of a molecular
marker and its suitability at a given taxonomic level.

4.3.2 Methods of analysis of molecular data sets – phenetic versus cladistic

approaches

The preferred method to visualize taxonomic interrelationship is to construct bifurcating
trees (although scatter plots from ordination techniques have also been found useful).
It is important to distinguish the two fundamentally different approaches to tree building,
i.e. phenetic versus cladistic approaches, which are distance-based versus character-based,
respectively. The distance-based approach calculates the pairwise distances between
all combinations of the investigated entities [often called operational taxonomic units
(OTUs)], resulting in a triangular distance (or similarity) matrix. Starting from this matrix,
different algorithms are used to produce distance-based trees or dendrograms. Consecu-
tive clustering of OTUs with the smallest distances results in an Unweighted Pair Group
Method using arithmic averages (UPGMA) tree, whereas for Neighbour Joining trees
at each clustering step the effect on the total tree length is taken into account. Both
approaches make use of overall similarity based on all the characters simultaneously.
Character-based approaches try to construct a tree topology where the character states of
each character can be placed in a consistent way (e.g. such that a character state changes
into another state just once on the tree). The branches in the tree are considered to be
natural groups, called clades (hence cladistic approach). Usually, an analysis generates
many possible character-based trees (and just one or very few distance-based trees),
making it necessary to adhere to an optimality criterion to choose the ‘best’ tree. In the
character-based approach, this is often the parsimony criterion where the shortest tree
(with the minimum number of steps between character states) is considered best.

A comparison of the results of the distance- and character-based approaches showing

the topologies of the resulting trees is given in Fig. 4.1.

Solanum spp.

4.3.3.1 Delimitation of the group

The genus Solanum has been subdivided into seven subgenera. The group of wild relatives
of the potato is classified within the subgenus Potatoe in section Petota. Hawkes (1989)

subdivided this section into two subsections, Potatoe and Estolonifera, accommodating
two non-tuber-bearing series (Etuberosa and Juglandifolia) in the latter. Using chloroplast
DNA RFLPs, Spooner et al. (1993) showed that these two non-tuber-bearing series were
in fact less closely related to the tuber-bearing series than to the tomato and should
be excluded from section Petota. This article also presented conclusive evidence for the
inclusion of the genus Lycopersicon in the genus Solanum, as a section closely related to,
but separate from, the potatoes. The nomenclatural consequences of this were published
by Child (1990).

species form a dense cluster with only a few species outside this core group. Besides three
tomato species and members of series Etuberosa, also representatives of the Mexican
diploid species, series Circaeifolia and two accessions of Solanum mochiquense were
plotted away from the dense central cluster. This would indicate that the Mexican diploid
species and the South American species Solanum circaeifolium and S. mochiquense are
relatively distantly related to the South American species and the Mexican polyploids.

4.3.3.2 Overall phylogeny of the group based on molecular markers

Many studies have focused on the elucidation of the structure within the group of tuber-
bearing Solanum spp., using several molecular markers. Most of these have used RFLPs
of the chloroplast (Hosaka et al., 1984; Spooner et al., 1991a; Spooner and Sytsma, 1992;
Spooner and Castillo, 1997) or the nuclear genome (Debener et al., 1990). Later, the
so-called AFLPs were applied (Kardolus, 1998; Kardolus et al., 1998), and recently, SSR
(Bryan et al., 1999) and sequence data (Volkov et al., 2001, 2003) became available.

Hosaka et al. (1984) used cpDNA digest patterns to study the interrelationships of
26 species of section Petota, supplemented with four outgroup species of the genus
Lycopersicon and the series Juglandifolia and Etuberosa. They found clear differences
between the outgroup species and the wild potato species, but within section Petota
were only able to distinguish the Mexican diploid species from the rest (comprising the
Mexican polyploids and the South American species).

Debener et al. (1990) used nuclear RFLPs, studying 14 wild and 2 cultivated potato
species, with Solanum etuberosum as an outgroup. They could distinguish clearly

62

van den Berg and Jacobs

separated groups, with all the species of series Tuberosa in two related groups, one
with wild representatives and one with the cultivated potato, S. tuberosum, clustering with
S. stenotomum and Solanum canasense. Solanum acaule and S. demissum together formed
a well-separated branch, and S. etuberosum was most distant.

Spooner and collaborators (Spooner et al., 1991a; Spooner and Sytsma, 1992; Spooner
and Castillo, 1997) used probes rather than directly observed cpDNA digest patterns and
greatly extended the number of species studied. They provided evidence for four clades
(Fig. 4.3):

(1) The Mexican diploids, but excluding Solanum bulbocastanum, Solanum cardiophyl-

lum and Solanum verrucosum.

(2) S. bulbocastanum and S. cardiophyllum.
(3) Members of series Piurana, with a number of species from other series.
(4) Solanum verrucosum, all remaining South American species and the polyploid species

from Mexico and Central America.

Kardolus et al. (1998) and Kardolus (1998) applied AFLPs. In the latter study, 53 species
were investigated (Fig. 4.4). The method proved to be highly efficient in producing 997
markers with three primer combinations. Three tomato species and two species from
series Etuberosa constituted the outgroups. Representatives of the Mexican diploids were
placed as the sistergroup of the rest of the tuber-bearing species. The species of series
Tuberosa were subdivided into geographical groups, with S. tuberosum in the Peruvian
group associated with species such as S. canasense, Solanum bukasovii and Solanum
multidissectum and other members of the brevicaule complex from Bolivia and Argentina
grouping together. Solanum demissum was united with species of series Acaulia, recalling
the results of Debener et al. (1990). Series Circaeifolia was placed as the most primitive
group of the South American species.

Bryan et al. (1999) used polymorphic SSRs from the chloroplast genome (cpSSRs),
studying 24 species and 30 cultivars. This marker system detected high levels of inter-
specific cpDNA variation, and the authors suggest its utility in population genetics,
germplasm management and phylogenetic studies. The resulting UPGMA tree, however,
does not provide much resolution, with cultivated accessions clustering among the wild
species (indicating the introgression from wild species into cultivated material) and a tree
topology that does not enable the recognition of clear subgroups.

Volkov et al. (2001) used nucleotide sequences of 5S ribosomal DNA genes of 26 wild
species, 4 S. tuberosum-breeding lines and a tomato accession, with Solanum dulcamara
as outgroup. This first sequence data set proved difficult to analyse because of the high
abundance of indels in comparison with base substitutions, and the dendrograms resulting
from different clustering algorithms differed essentially from each other. Because the
dendrogram topology was extremely unstable, the authors evaluated the indels ‘manu-
ally’, producing a schematic representation of the molecular evolution. This shows the
Mexican diploids (series Polyadenia, Pinnatisecta and Bulbocastana) as basal and a group
with rather conserved 5S rDNA organization comprising Solanum brevidens, Solanum
commersonii, S. circaeifolium and – surprisingly – S. bukasovii, which is far removed

from the remaining cluster of species belonging to superseries Rotata. Within the latter
group, the species of series Tuberosa are divided into several subgroups, and S. acaule
and S. demissum are grouped together. Although the overall picture conforms with earlier
results, the sequenced region does not seem to be optimal for phylogenetic reconstruction.

(cid:2)

Volkov et al. (2003) turned to the 5

external transcribed spacer (ETS) region of rDNA,
comparing 30 species of Solanum sect. Petota, with S. dulcamara as outgroup. Three
structural variants of ETS (variants A–C) could be recognized (Fig. 4.5). Variant A is
present in the outgroup S. dulcamara, in the non-tuber-bearing species of series Etuberosa
and in the representatives of the Mexican diploid series Bulbocastana, Pinnatisecta and
Polyadenia. Species of the series Commersoniana and Circaeifolia possess variant B, and
variant C is present in all other investigated species. Variant C can be subdivided into two
subgroups, C1 and C2. Group C1 contains species from the series Megistacroloba, Coni-
cibaccata and Acaulia, whereas group C2 consists of all diploids of series Tuberosa. The
dendrograms presented show many polytomies (multiple branching instead of dichoto-
mously branching), indicating that resolution within the groups is mostly lacking. Also,
representatives of a species like S. demissum are widely separated in all trees, indicative
of intraspecific variation. According to the authors, the groups are defined by large rear-
rangements, while base substitutions allow additional discrimination of closely related
species, and this broad range of resolving power is taken to suggest the utility of this
marker system for phylogeny reconstruction. The authors further suggest – in contrast
with the evolutionary scenario in Hawkes (1990) – an origin of primitive Petota spp.
in South America, followed by a migration of primitive Stellata spp. to Mexico, and
a development in South America from other primitive Stellata towards more advanced
Stellata and Rotata spp.

Summarizing the data from the various studies mentioned above, it seems clear that our
insight into the phylogenetic structure of the group of tuber-bearing Solanum spp. has been
improved by molecular studies. The phylogenetic position of certain species, like e.g. the
Mexican diploids, and the series Circaeifolia, and the reality of a S. acaule/S. demissum
assemblage, are supported by several sources. However, the lack of resolution within
section Petota (4 clades instead of 20 series based on chloroplast RFLP data) seems to be
a real phenomenon. Except for the rather distinctive groups in Mexico, the differentiation
among the other South American groups is not large, and it remains difficult to subdivide
the group into natural units.

The studies discussed above have one serious problem in common: most of them
were not able to sample the complete width of the variation of the group of tuber-
bearing Solanum spp., and undersampling can influence the results of (especially cladistic)
analyses. The most complete effort has been the studies by Spooner and collaborators. If
one combines these three studies, 86 species from most of the series are considered, but
this still is only less than half of the total number of species.

The most promising ways forward could be the extension of a molecular data set to
encompass all the relevant taxa of the group (Jacobs et al., 2005) and the search for
suitable nuclear sequences as undertaken by Spooner and collaborators [nitrate reductase
(NIA), Rodriguez and Spooner, 2004; single-copy waxy gene (GBSSI), Spooner et al.,
2004; internal transcribed spacer (ITS), Stephenson et al., 2004].

4.3.3.3 Detailed studies of parts of the group

Molecular data have been utilized to study certain groups of species in detail. For
convenience sake, these studies will be discussed according to the series names applied,

Molecular taxonomy

67

even though not all series received support in the phylogenetic studies mentioned in the
previous paragraph.

Series Acaulia

Series Acaulia has attracted many workers, due to the extreme frost tolerance present
in the species S. acaule. The pentaploid cultivated potato S. curtilobum, which is
used to produce the freeze-dried ‘chuno’, resulted from crosses between Andigenum-
type potatoes and the triploid cultigen S. juzepczukii, itself a cross between S. acaule
and diploid Stenotomum potatoes. The taxa within the series comprise tetraploids and
hexaploids, which have been recognized at different
taxonomic levels by different
authors.

Hosaka and Spooner (1992), using RFLPs of genomic DNA, studied 105 accessions
of S. acaule including all four subspecies (acaule, aemulans, albicans and punae) that
were recognized at that time. The results placed subspecies albicans as most distant (this
hexaploid taxon was later raised to the species level), could not distinguish subspecies
acaule and punae and divided subspecies aemulans into two groups, from the provinces
La Rioja and Jujuy (Argentina), respectively.

Kardolus (1998), studying this group with AFLPs, also could not consistently dis-
tinguish the subspecies acaule and punae, but recognized a new, hexaploid subspecies,
subspecies palmirense. The occurrence of this hexaploid cytotype within the species S.
acaule may indicate the need to re-evaluate the recognition of Solanum albicans on the
species level.

McGregor et al. (2002) investigated 314 accessions of the Centre for Genetic Resources,
The Netherlands (CGN) germplasm collection with AFLPs and concluded that most plants
were grouped in an UPGMA tree according to the species and subspecies designations
in the passport data. The subspecies acaule and punae were distinguishable, although
only separated by a small genetic distance. The classification of the hexaploid palmirense
taxon in S. acaule, separate from S. albicans, was confirmed.

Nakagawa and Hosaka (2002) combined RFLP data from chloroplast and nuclear
DNA to study the relationships between S. acaule, S. albicans and 27 morphologically
closely related species. They found high similarity between S. acaule, S. albicans and
S. demissum, and suggested Solanum megistacrolobum and Solanum sanctae-rosae as the
closest relatives, and possibly involved in the origin of the series Acaulia spp.

Series Circaeifolia

Van den Berg et al. (2001a), using AFLPs and RAPDs, reinvestigated the taxa within
this small series that is endemic to Bolivia. Hawkes and Hjerting (1989) and Ochoa
(1990) had provided different classifications of these taxa, with different numbers of
species, and using either subspecies or varieties to accommodate minor variants. An
earlier morphological study (Van den Berg and Groendijk-Wilders, 1999) doubted the
distinction of the recognized taxa, but especially the AFLPs supported four distinct
groups, which can either be recognized at the species level or as infraspecific taxa within
the species S. circaeifolium. These results indicate that certain taxa that can only be
recognized with difficulty morphologically might be real entities, and polythetic support
for species (where species lack unique diagnostic characters but must be distinguished by

68

van den Berg and Jacobs

combinations of characters that often display overlapping ranges) is frequent in section
Petota.

Series Conicibaccata

Castillo and Spooner (1997) generated cpDNA restriction data of 23 of the possibly 40
species in this group. Their cladistic analysis indicated that a history of hybridization
and polyploidization render a reconstruction of the phylogeny extremely difficult. They
recognized three groups separating the polyploids of Central Mexico to Southern Ecuador
from the diploids of Northern Peru and Bolivia, with a third group suspected to be
more related to series Piurana, and noted discordances between morphological species
as currently defined and the cpDNA clades.

Series Longipedicellata

Van den Berg et al. (2001b) applied AFLPs, RAPDs and cpSSRs to study the species
boundaries of the six tetraploid species assigned to series Longipedicellata. Confirming
earlier morphological work (Spooner et al., 2001), not all species were supported by the
AFLP and RAPD data (cpSSRs failed to distinguish any of the species), and a reduction
of the number of species to be recognized is recommended. The cpDNA microsatellite
results were completely discordant with the AFLP and RAPD results, which may have
been caused by the lower number of markers generated.

Series Bulbocastana, Morelliformia, Pinnatisecta and Polyadenia

Lara-Cabrera and Spooner (2004) used AFLPs to study the species boundaries and tax-
onomic relationships of the diploid species of the United States, Mexico and Central
America. They analysed the data set using both cladistic and phenetic approaches.
The resulting cladograms and dendrograms showed approximately the same set of
species groups, with incongruence occurring mainly within these groups and not
among them.

Also, there were many points of agreement between the AFLP results and earlier
cpDNA (Spooner and Sytsma, 1992) results. For instance, the separation of S. bulbo-
castanum and Solanum clarum, which had been classified in one series Bulbocastana
by Hawkes (1990), and the combination of S. clarum and Solanum morelliforme in one
group, was confirmed. Also, the subspecies of S. cardiophyllum were separated and should
most likely be treated as different species, with subspecies ehrenbergii more related to
the Solanum brachistotrichium/Solanum stenophyllidium assemblage. On the contrary,
cpDNA data had combined S. bulbocastanum with S. cardiophyllum (exclusive of sub-
species ehrenbergii), but these taxa were widely separated in the AFLP results, which
could indicate the phenomenon of chloroplast capture. Most clades were species specific,
and although many sistergroup relationships between pairs of species were recovered, the
traditional series were not apparent.

It is clear that molecular data can be used to solve problems of species or series bound-
aries, but their utility strongly depends on the amount of variation generated and the appli-
cation of appropriate methods of analysis. Chloroplast data are generally more suitable
for higher taxonomic levels (species groups, series and subsections) and can be profitably
complemented by AFLP markers to investigate species boundaries. SSRs do not provide

Molecular taxonomy

69

much phylogenetic signal but seem useful at the population level. Lack of support for
species in AFLP data may be taken to imply the need for a reduction in species numbers.

4.3.3.4 Hybridization hypotheses

Spooner and collaborators investigated many putative hybrid species (Spooner et al.,
1991b: Solanum raphanifolium; Clausen and Spooner, 1998: Solanum rechei; Lara-
Cabrera and Spooner, 2004: Solanum michoacanum and Solanum sambucinum). Solanum
raphanifolium had been hypothesized to be a hybrid species between S. canasense and
S. megistacrolobum. This hypothesis was tested with cpDNA and nuclear rDNA char-
acters, with the expectation that the hybrid would possess a cpDNA pattern identical to
one of the parents and an additive nuclear rDNA pattern from both parents. The results
indicated that the putative parents were more closely related to each other than either was
to S. raphanifolium, and the hybridization hypothesis was refuted, the striking morpho-
logical intermediacy notwithstanding. The hybrid origin of S. rechei from a cross between
Solanum microdontum and Solanum kurtzianum was verified using nuclear RFLP profiles
that showed additivity, although some of the bands present in the putative parents were
also present in other species, and S. rechei also possessed unique RFLP bands. In the
AFLP study by Lara-Cabrera and Spooner (2004) discussed above (Section 4.3.3.3), the
two hybrid species S. michoacanum and S. sambucinum grouped with one of their parents
(Solanum pinnatisectum) and not with the other. Unfortunately, additive species-specific
AFLP markers were not found.

Raimondi et al. (2005) used 4 chloroplast and 11 nuclear SSRs to study the hybrid
origin of Solanum ruiz-lealii from a cross between S. kurtzianum and Solanum chacoense.
In most of the presented phenograms and principal coordinate analysis plots, the three
species are clearly separated from each other, with S. ruiz-lealii closer to S. chacoense.
Supplementing their molecular data with morphological and cytological observations, the
authors conclude that S. ruiz-lealii is not a recent hybrid.

As the literature on the taxonomy of the potato abounds in hybridization hypotheses that
are mainly based on perceived morphological intermediacy, the application of molecular
data sets provides a strong tool to establish the true status of these putative hybrids.

4.3.3.5 The cultivated potato

Although, as mentioned in the first paragraph of this chapter, a more correct way to refer
to cultivated potatoes would be by using cultivar-groups within the cultigen S. tuberosum,
the species names that are used in almost all the cited literature will be used in this
section. Seven cultigenic species S. stenotomum, S. ajanhuiri, S. chaucha, S. phureja,
S. curtilobum, S. juzepczukii and S. tuberosum (with two subspecies: andigena and tubero-
sum) are currently recognized as cultivated species (Hawkes, 1990). All tetraploid South-
American landraces are classified in S. tuberosum ssp. andigena. All modern cultivars
known to us as the common potato can be accommodated in S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum.
The transition from subspecies andigena to subspecies tuberosum apparently resulted from
transporting material from the short-day environment of the Peruvian/Bolivian Andes to
long-day circumstances. This transport accompanied by adaptation is believed by Hawkes
(1990) to have occurred twice: the first event would have taken place in Chile where

70

van den Berg and Jacobs

original subspecies andigena material, brought here by migrating Indian tribes from the
Andes, underwent adaptation to long-day length and cool climatic conditions, and the
second time this development took place was in Europe after the Spaniards introduced
the potato there.

Hawkes (1990) regarded the cultigen S. stenotomum as being the most primi-
tive of the cultivated material and as the progenitor of the other cultivated ‘taxa’.
A wild diploid species like Solanum leptophyes would have been the progenitor of
S. stenotomum. Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigena originated from a hybridization event
between S. stenotomum and the wild species Solanum sparsipilum. Solanum tuberosum
ssp. tuberosum later developed from subsp. andigena. Grun (1990) described a similar
origin of the cultivated potato, with the primitive diploid cultigen S. stenotomum arising
from a wild progenitor from the brevicaule complex.

The most extensive study using molecular data on the origin of S. tuberosum, the relation-
ships among the cultivated species and the relationships between wild and cultivated species,
has been conducted by Hosaka and co-workers. In a series of publications ranging from 1986
to 2004, they focused on restriction data of cpDNA of wild and cultivated potatoes.

Hosaka (1986) distinguished seven different chloroplast haplotypes in a selection of

wild and cultivated species:

(1) type T was restricted to S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum;
(2) type A was characteristic for S. tuberosum ssp. andigena and Solanum maglia;
(3) type S was found in Solanum goniocalyx, S. phureja, S. stenotomum, S. chaucha and

one accession of subspecies andigena;

(4) type C was found in S. acaule, S. bukasovii, S. canasense, S. multidissectum and

S. juzepczukii;

(5) type W was found in wild species and was considered as the most primitive type;
(6) type W
(7) type W

was found in S. chacoense f. gibberulosum;
was found in Solanum tarijense.

The author concluded that, indeed, the cultivated potatoes derived from S. stenotomum,
which itself might have developed from S. canasense, and, furthermore, that the chloro-
plast genome of the European potato derived from Chilean material, which itself was the
result of the combination of the nuclear genome of subspecies andigena with cytoplasm
from an unknown species.

In 1988, a series of three articles on cpDNA data of potato were published by Hosaka
and co-workers. Hosaka et al. (1988) showed that the differences between types T and
W found with five different restriction enzymes in the earlier study (Hosaka, 1986) were
in fact all caused by one physical deletion in the chloroplast genome of the T-type
chloroplast. The authors concluded that the T-type chloroplast could easily have evolved
from the primitive W type, whereas in the former publication this had not seemed probable.
Hosaka and Hanneman (1988a) found a geographical cline from the Andean region to
coastal Chile, supporting the Andean origin of Chilean subspecies tuberosum. Material
considered as a relic of the first European potato (a hybrid of the cultivar ‘Myatt’s
Ashleaf’) showed the A-type chloroplast, confirming Hawkes’ opinion that the first

Molecular taxonomy

71

European potatoes were subspecies andigena, later replaced by subspecies tuberosum
from Chile.

Hosaka and Hanneman (1988b) noted extensive cpDNA variation in cultivated potatoes
as well as in wild potato species. They hypothesized that the Andean cultivated tetraploid
potato, subspecies andigena, could have arisen many times from the cultivated diploids.
Hosaka (1995) determined the chloroplast types of 35 accessions of S. stenotomum and
97 accessions of putative ancestral wild species, including S. brevicaule, S. bukasovii,
Solanum candolleanum, S. canasense, S. leptophyes and S. multidissectum. Except for
S. brevicaule, which had only the W type, the wild species proved polymorphic for
cpDNA types. Sexual polyploidization formed a wide cpDNA diversity among the Andean
tetraploid potatoes and selection caused the limited diversity found in Chilean tetraploid
potatoes.

Hosaka (2002) explored the maternal ancestry of the common potato by determining
the presence/absence of a 241-bp deletion characteristic for the T-type cpDNA. Sixteen
of 80 accessions of S. tarijense, S. berthaultii and S. neorossii showed the same deletion
at the same position. Hosaka (2003) found that all the T-type accessions of cultivated
potatoes shared this haplotype only with some accessions of S. tarijense. The author
concluded that some populations of S. tarijense acted as the maternal ancestor of potato.
Hosaka (2004), investigating 215 accessions of S. stenotomum and 286 accessions of S.
tuberosum subsp. andigena, noted the absence of T-type chloroplast in S. stenotomum
while this type was present in nine accessions of subsp. andigena and concluded that
S. stenotomum did not play a role in the formation of the tetraploid potatoes.

All the data presented above are based on cpDNA and therefore only show maternal
inheritance. Furthermore, the cpDNA types do not seem to be monomorphic within
species, which makes it difficult to discuss ancestor/derivative relationships between
species. There is a need for suitable nuclear markers (such as AFLPs or a suitable nuclear
sequence) to complement the work done on the chloroplast genome. Many studies have
taken this approach.

Debener et al. (1991) showed with nuclear RFLPs that S. andigena, S. stenotomum
and S. canasense were very closely related to each other and could in fact not be dis-
tinguished with the single locus information. Miller and Spooner (1999) used single to
low-copy nuclear RFLPs and RAPDs to investigate the species boundaries and relation-
ships among the members of the brevicaule complex. They confirmed the separation of
populations from Peru and immediately adjacent northwestern Boliva, including most
cultivated accessions, and of populations from northwestern Boliva and Argentina. This
had been found by Van den Berg et al. (1998) using morphological data and Kardolus
et al. (1998) using AFLPs, which also showed S. tuberosum clustering together with the
wild Peruvian species S. canasense and S. multidissectum. Miller and Spooner (1999)
indicated the paraphyletic nature of the brevicaule complex and the need to reduce the
number of species names in this group.

Raker and Spooner (2002) tested the genetic differences between accessions of
S. tuberosum ssp. andigena and S.
tuberosum using nuclear DNA
microsatellites. The two subspecies could be separated from each other although the
separation is not very firm. Other cultivated species (S. stenotomum and S. phureja) and

tuberosum ssp.

72

van den Berg and Jacobs

wild species (S. bukasovii, S. multidissectum and S. canasense) used in this study were
mixed with S. tuberosum ssp. andigena.

Sukhotu et al. (2004) combined data on the cpDNA types of Hosaka with chloroplast
microsatellite markers and nuclear RFLPs. The differences among cpDNA types were
highly correlated with the microsatellite markers. The nuclear RFLPs supported the dif-
ferentiation between the W type versus the C, S and A types, but not the differentiation
among the three latter types, suggesting frequent genetic exchange among them. In a
UPGMA dendrogram of the nuclear DNA restriction data, three clusters could be identi-
fied, with both S. tuberosum ssp. andigena and S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum accessions
placed together with most other cultivated Andean spp. and members of the brevicaule
complex.

In a recent study of the brevicaule complex, Spooner et al. (2005a), using AFLP data,
reconfirmed the distinction of the northern and southern subgroups within the complex
and argued that cultivated potatoes have had a monophyletic origin in the northern part
of the distribution area of the brevicaule complex, as all the landrace populations form a
clade in the parsimony cladogram. The progenitor of the cultivated potato should thus be
sought in the members of the brevicaule complex occurring in southern Peru. The authors
note that these species are poorly defined and may have to be reduced to a single species,
the earliest valid name being S. bukasovii. The brevicaule complex itself is designated to
be polyphyletic.

The origin of our modern cultivated potato varieties and the manner of introduction of
the cultivated potato in Europe have been the subject of controversy. According to many
authors, the first potato material to be introduced in Europe belonged to S. tuberosum
ssp. andigena. Most of the potato stock derived from this original material was believed
to have been wiped out during the late-blight outbreak in Europe in the 1840s. After
this, the breeding stock would have been replaced with introductions from Chile of
S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum material (Grun, 1990). Juzepczuk and Bukasov (1929) had,
however, suggested that the early European introductions already consisted of subspecies
tuberosum germplasm from Chile, because of the similarity in morphology and growing
conditions.

Spooner et al. (2005b) published results from a nuclear microsatellite analysis of mainly
Indian potato cultivars. The analysis included several accessions that were considered
to be derived from S. tuberosum ssp. andigena to test the idea that the first potato
introductions in the old world were actually subspecies andigena. Late blight was not
recorded in India until 1870, so only after the late blight disaster in Europe. The andigena
germplasm in India would therefore not have been eliminated by the epidemic. The
microsatellite results showed, however, that all Indian cultivars, including those that were
thought to be derived from subspecies andigena, clustered together with the subspecies
tuberosum landraces and European cultivars. All 12 tested subspecies andigena landraces
from Central and South America clustered together separately from this group. The
andigena introduction theory was thus not supported. Spooner et al. (2005b) concluded
that no remnant landraces of subspecies andigena were involved in the development of
the Indian germplasm. Considering this evidence and other historical and cytological
information, they suggested that the early introductions of cultivated potatoes of India
(and Europe) came from both the Chile and the Andes. The Chilean landraces became

Molecular taxonomy

73

the predominant breeding germplasm before the outbreak of late blight, likely because of
their pre-adaptation to long-day/cool climate conditions.

Remarkably, five Indian cultivars that, based on the nuclear microsatellite data were
linked to subspecies tuberosum, lacked the typical 241 bp deletion. This could have been
caused by either a subspecies tuberosum progenitor lacking the typical deletion or the
incorporation of other non-tuberosum accessions as maternal material.

Huaman and Spooner (2002) examined morphological support for the classification of
landrace populations of cultivated potatoes. They recognized all landrace populations as
a single species, S. tuberosum, with eight cultivar groups. Following the philosophy of
cultivar-group classification, the remaining cultivated materials, e.g. the modern varieties,
were not automatically classified as a ninth ‘Tuberosum’ group.

Many authors have suggested that molecular markers are appropriate to identify cul-
tivars and reveal infraspecific variation (e.g. Debener et al., 1990; Hosaka et al., 1994;
Bryan et al. 1999; Bornet et al., 2002), but these methods have not been used to produce
an overall classification of cultivars. Most studies are restricted to the assessment of
genetic diversity of cultivars or their discrimination with fingerprinting techniques (Görg
et al., 1992).

Provan et al. (1999) used polymorphic chloroplast and nuclear SSRs to study the
diversity in most modern potato cultivars grown in the UK. In total, 151 of 178 accessions
tested showed the same chloroplast haplotype, named haplotype A, which corresponds
with the T type of Hosaka (1986). A much higher diversity was found in the remaining
accessions outside the T-type group, which were assigned to 25 different haplotypes. The
diversity of the nuclear SSR loci did not show this difference between the T-type group
and the rest. The authors suggested that the dominance of the T-type cytoplasm was
caused by the use of only a limited number of maternal lineages in breeding programmes.
Bryan et al. (1999) using cpSSRs demonstrated that among a set of 30 tetraploid
potato cultivars, a single chloroplast haplotype was prevalent and they attributed this to
the widespread use as a female parent of the imported US cultivar ‘Purple Chili’ in the
latter half of the 19th century. The chloroplast diversity that is present has arisen through
introgression from wild and primitive cultivated material.

The low level of genetic diversity of European cultivated potatoes was confirmed in
an analysis using ISSRs by Bornet et al. (2002). Their results showed that European
potatoes are quite homogenous, and the genetic diversity was very low compared with
Argentinian cultivars.

Molecular data have been used to address three main issues about the cultivated potato:

(1) the mode of origin of the crop and the relationships with its wild relatives;
(2) the relationship between the Andigena and Tuberosum groups and the introduction

of the cultivated potato from South America to Europe and the rest of the world;

(3) the genetic diversity of the crop.

The conclusions about these issues are not unequivocal. Results from the chloroplast
and nuclear genome conflict as to the role taxa like S. tarijense, S. stenotomum and the
brevicaule complex have played in the origin of the crop. Different data sets give rise to
different hypotheses on the multiple or single domestication event(s) that occurred, most

74

van den Berg and Jacobs

probably, in southern Peru. The role that Chilean material played in the introduction of
the cultivated potato in Europe has been clarified. The genetic diversity of the crop has
been shown to have suffered a severe maternal bottleneck during the development of the
modern cultivated potato. Finally, the classification of the modern cultivars of potato in
subgroups has not really been addressed yet with molecular markers.

4.4 CONCLUSION

Molecular data have been used to establish the phylogeny of the group of tuber-bearing
Solanum spp., to evaluate hybridization hypotheses, to evaluate infraspecific classifica-
tions, to establish the ancestry of the cultivated potato, to trace introgression from wild
species and to assess genetic diversity within species and cultivated material. In the con-
text of genebank management, the effect of seed increases on the diversity of genebank
accessions (Del Rio and Bamberg, 2003), and the extent of redundancy (McGregor et al.,
2002) has been studied. Furthermore, molecular data allow checking for misidentifications
and can be utilized in risk-assessment studies.

Although the search for the phylogenetic structure of the group has suffered from a
lack of resolution, at the species level, the utility of AFLPs is evident, as long as closely
related taxa are compared. There remains a need for a suitable nuclear marker to fill the
gap between the high level chloroplast derived data and the fingerprinting data like SSRs,
but this will most probably be forthcoming in the near future.

5.1 INTRODUCTION

Potato genetics was initiated around 100 years ago when R. N. Salaman applied the newly
discovered Mendelian principles of inheritance to characters such as male sterility, haulm
characters, tuber shape, colour and eye depth, and immunity to Phytophthora infestans
(Salaman, 1910–1911). He stated: ‘Although the subject material of this research was
my own choice, at the time it was determined on I was quite ignorant of the very
special advantages as well as disadvantages which the Potato offers for the Mendelian
student’ (Salaman, 1910–1911). At that time, the tetraploidy and tetrasomic inheritance
of the cultivated potato Solanum tuberosum was not recognized, which makes the potato
a rather unfortunate choice for Mendelian genetics of simple traits. Recessive alleles
are difficult to uncover, alleles occur in four dosages (simplex, duplex, triplex and
quadruplex) instead of only two in diploids (homozygous and heterozygous), pure lines
are not obtained due to severe inbreeding depression after repeated selfing and multiple
allelism generates a multitude of genotypes (Fig. 5.1) that are difficult to distinguish
based on comparing expected with observed segregation ratios. Inheritance studies of
Mendelian characters in potato were therefore mostly restricted to dominant traits such
as anthocyanin pigmentation genes (reviewed by Black, 1933; de Jong, 1991) or major
genes for pathogen resistance (Cockerham, 1970). Genetic linkage between genes was
rarely detected (Dodds and Long, 1956; Cockerham, 1970), and a linkage map was never
constructed based on classical morphological markers.

Two technical developments provided the enabling tools for extensive linkage studies
and map construction in potato, the manipulation of the ploidy level and the advent
of DNA-based genetic markers. Ploidy reduction from the tetraploid (cid:2)2n = 4x = 48(cid:3) to
the diploid level (cid:2)2n = 2x = 24(cid:3) became possible either by pollination of tetraploid S.
tuberosum ssp. tuberosum with certain genotypes of Solanum phureja (cid:2)2n = 2x = 24(cid:3)
which induces the parthenogenetic development of diploid female gametes into plants
(Ivanovskaja, 1939; Hougas and Peloquin, 1958; Hougas et al., 1964; Hermsen and
Verdenius, 1973), or by regenerating diploid plants from male gametes of tetraploid plants
through anther or microspore culture (Dunwell and Sunderland, 1973; Powell and Uhrig,
1987). Diploid potatoes are highly self-incompatible (gametophytic incompatibility).

Fig. 5.1. Genotypic classes obtained in the F1 when crossing tetraploid, fully heterozygous potato individuals,
each having four alleles at a locus A. Based on the assumption of tetrasomic inheritance and random formation
of 2n gametes, 36 genotype classes of equal frequency are expected. With reduction of heterozygosity of
the parents (less than eight different alleles), the number and frequency of individual genotype classes vary,
depending of the allelic state of the parents.

At the diploid level, the complexity of genetic analysis in potato is therefore equivalent to
human genetics: partially heterozygous parents generate segregating offspring. Compared
to Homo sapiens, diploid potato has the advantage that experimental F1 families with
hundreds of sibs can be generated by crossing compatible parental genotypes.

DNA-based genetic markers essentially detect point mutations, insertions, deletions
or inversions in allelic DNA fragments, which differentiate the individuals of the same
species. These DNA polymorphisms are usually selectively neutral and hence a transient
phase of molecular evolution, in which they are maintained in a species by mutational
input and random extinction. DNA-based markers show Mendelian inheritance, are avail-
able in unlimited numbers and most of them are phenotypically neutral. Based on DNA
polymorphisms and their detection methods described below, the construction of molec-
ular linkage maps of the 12 chromosomes of one potato genome complement became
feasible since the mid-1980s (Bonierbale et al., 1988; Gebhardt et al., 1989). Molecular
maps are the basis for the tremendous advances made over the last 20 years in structural
and functional characterization of the potato genome.

5.2 DNA MARKER TYPES USEFUL FOR POTATO GENETICS

5.2.1 Restriction fragment length polymorphism

Restriction enzymes cut DNA at specific recognition sites. A point mutation within this
site results in the loss or gain of a recognition site, giving rise to restriction fragments of
different lengths. Insertion, deletion or inversion of DNA stretches can also lead to a length
variation of restriction fragments. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs)
(Botstein et al., 1980) are detected on Southern gel blots (Southern, 1975). In potato, the
genomic DNA of partially heterozygous, diploid genotypes is cleaved with an enzyme
of choice, the fragments are size separated by electrophoresis in a gel matrix, transferred

the example of an RFLP marker with three alleles a(cid:4) b and c of different length, which
are present in the heterozygous state in the diploid potato genotypes P3 (cid:2)b(cid:4) c(cid:3) and P38
(cid:2)a(cid:4) c(cid:3) (Schäfer-Pregl et al., 1998). In F1 progeny of the cross P3× P38, the three alleles
segregate as co-dominant Mendelian markers and combine in four genotype classes: ac,
bc, ab and cc. This type of segregation pattern is most informative for linkage analysis
(Section 5.3) but is observed for only a subset of marker loci.

5.2.2 Amplified fragment length polymorphism

Amplified fragment length polymorphism™ (AFLP™) (Zabeau and Vos, 1993; Vos et al.,
1995) is a marker technology based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Saiki et al.,
1988). Using cleaved genomic DNA as template, multi-locus DNA markers are generated
by PCR without prior sequence information. Briefly, the DNA is cleaved with two dif-
ferent restriction enzymes, one having a four-base pair, the other having a six-base pair
recognition site. The fragments are ligated with recognition site-specific adapter oligonu-
cleotides. A subset of approximately 50–100 restriction fragments is then selectively
amplified in two consecutive PCRs. The amplified restriction fragments are radioactive
or fluorescent labelled and size separated by electrophoresis on high-resolution polyacry-
lamide gels. Selectivity is achieved by designing PCR primers that anneal specifically to
the adaptor and the recognition site and carry one to three arbitrary chosen nucleotides
(cid:2)
end. Only those restriction fragments will be amplified that have on both ends
at the 3
nucleotides complementary to the adapter and the recognition site plus the arbitrary
nucleotide extension. DNA fragment polymorphisms between different genotypes result
from point mutations in the enzyme recognition sites or the nucleotide extensions, which
either allow or prevent PCR amplification of a specific DNA fragment. Insertions or
deletions between recognition sites can also give rise to AFLPs. Figure 5.2B shows a
section of an AFLP pattern of two heterozygous diploid potato genotypes P1 and P2 and
their F1 progeny. Each AFLP fragment segregates as a dominant Mendelian marker, with
presence of the fragment being dominant over its absence. AFLP markers are very well
suited to quickly generate a large number of segregating DNA markers for fingerprinting
and linkage analysis (Menendez et al., 2002). AFLPs are the markers of choice for link-
age map construction in segregating populations derived from crossing tetraploid parents
(Meyer et al., 1998) and when aiming at a high-density map (Isidore et al., 2003) to aid
map-based cloning and physical mapping.

5.2.3 Simple sequence repeat or microsatellite

Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellites are DNA stretches consisting of short,
tandemly repeated di-, tri-, tetra- or penta-nucleotide motifs. Simple sequence repeats have
been found in all eukaryotic species that were scrutinized for them (Tautz and Renz, 1984).
To amplify SSRs by PCR, information on unique flanking DNA sequences is required
for primer design. The amplification products are size separated by electrophoresis and
visualized by silver staining or fluorescent dyes. The amplicons from different genotypes
frequently show length polymorphisms due to allelic variation of the number of repeat
motifs in the microsatellite. Potato genotypes are highly heterozygous for multiple SSR
alleles (Provan et al., 1996; Milbourne et al., 1998), which makes SSR markers highly
informative and useful for fingerprinting and linkage studies in potato. All four possible
genotype classes in diploid F1 progeny may be identified, similar as shown for the RFLP
marker in Fig. 5.1A. Under very good circumstances of amplification, separation and
visualization, the dosage of co-dominant SSR alleles can be assessed in heterozygous
tetraploid potato cultivars by band intensity (Fig. 5.2C).

5.2.4 Cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence, sequence characterized

amplified region and allele-specific amplification

Because DNA sequencing became a universal, high throughput and affordable tool in
molecular genetics, it is now possible to develop PCR-based markers for almost any
sequence of interest, provided DNA polymorphisms between individuals exist in the
amplified region. Sequence-specific primers are used to amplify by PCR allelic fragments
from genomic DNA of different potato genotypes, tetraploids as well as diploids. An
insertion/deletion polymorphism (Indel) in the amplicon is then detected directly by elec-
trophoretic size separation in appropriate gel matrices [sequence characterized amplified
region (SCAR), Marczewski et al., 2001]. Point mutations can be detected by digestion
of the amplicons with appropriate restriction enzymes and subsequent fragment separa-
tion [cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS), Fig. 5.2D]. Comparative allele
sequencing is the basis for developing PCR primers that specifically amplify a single
allele [allele-specific amplification (ASA), Li et al., 2005]. Locus-specific, user-friendly
PCR-based markers such as SSR, SCAR, CAPS or ASA markers are most appropriate
for practical breeding applications.

5.2.5 Single-nucleotide polymorphism

The most direct and also most informative method to identify point mutations is the
sequencing of amplicons obtained with the same primer pair from DNA templates of
different potato genotypes, tetraploids as well as diploids. Automated sequencing detects
each of the four deoxynucleotides G, C, T and A with a different fluorescent dye. The
deoxynucleotide sequence is recorded as an electropherogram (trace file), with G’s repre-
sented by black, C’s by blue, T’s by red and A’s by green peaks. Due to the heterozygosity
of potato, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are detected as alternative coloured
nucleotide peaks at a given position in sequence trace files (Fig. 5.2E). High quality trace
files allow the estimation of the allele dosage in tetraploid genotypes based on the height
ratio of two co-migrating nucleotide peaks (Fig. 5.2E). Insertion/deletion polymorphisms
can also be detected by observing specific positions in trace files, downstream of which
different nucleotide sequences overlap. A first assessment of the frequency of SNPs and
Indels in the potato genome was performed by comparative sequencing of 78 amplicons in
a panel of 17 tetraploid and 11 diploid genotypes (Rickert et al., 2003). This revealed, on
average, one SNP every 21 base pairs and one Indel every 243 base pairs, confirming the
high degree of natural DNA sequence variation present in potato (Gebhardt et al., 1989).
Once identified, SNPs can be scored with a variety of techniques, e.g. pyrosequencing
or single-nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) (Rickert et al., 2002). In the future, array
technologies will be become available, which should allow the parallel scoring of many
SNPs on a chip. Single-nucleotide polmorphisms are the markers of choice for compre-
hensive population genetics and linkage disequilibrium studies. For breeding applications,
SNPs linked to agronomic traits can be converted into easy-to-use allele-specific PCR
assays (Niewöhner et al., 1995; Sattarzadeh et al., 2006).

5.3 PRINCIPLES OF LINKAGE MAP CONSTRUCTION

The basis for constructing molecular linkage maps for the 12 potato chromosomes is an
F1 or backcross (BC) progeny of partially heterozygous parents, which segregates for
a sufficient number of DNA polymorphisms (RFLP, AFLP, SSR, CAPS, SCAR, ASA
and SNP). Figure 5.3 shows the scheme for generating such a mapping population by
crossing diploid parents. The resolution of the genetic map depends on the population
size. For example, a map resolution of 1 cM (on average 1% recombination) requires
the genotyping of at least 100 individuals. Parents and progeny are scored for DNA
polymorphisms, the more the better. The genetic distance between pairs of markers is
estimated by counting recombinant and non-recombinant individuals in the progeny,
and linked markers are arranged in linear linkage groups. Acceptable map coverage is
achieved when most of the markers scored can be arranged in a number of linkage groups
that corresponds to the number of chromosomes per genome complement (12 in potato).
Unlike in F2 or BC populations derived from inbred lines, in a BC or F1 population
descending from partially heterozygous, non-inbred parents, the alleles at different marker
loci can segregate according to several different genetic models, depending on the number
and heterozygosity of the parental alleles at any given marker locus. These models have
been described in detail by Ritter et al. (1990). However, when considering only the
presence or absence of single DNA fragments in the parents and their progeny, with
presence of the fragment being dominant over its absence, all models are reduced to three
observable segregation patterns, which are valid for all DNA marker types. Fragments
that are present in the heterozygous state either in the seed or in the pollen parent are
expected to segregate in F1 with a 1:1 ratio. Fragments that are present in the heterozygous
state in both parents are expected to segregate in F1 with a 3:1 ratio (presence versus
absence, Fig. 5.3). The same segregation patterns apply to tetraploid mapping populations

when the DNA fragment is present as a single-dose (simplex) allele. In addition, double-
dose (duplex) alleles are also required for linkage mapping in tetraploid crosses (Hackett
et al., 1998; Meyer et al., 1998). The frequency of recombination is estimated between
all fragments descending from the seed parent or the pollen parent, taking into account
coupling and repulsion phase linkages (Ritter et al., 1990), and two independent linkage
groups are constructed, based on meiotic recombination either in the seed parent or in
the pollen parent. Linkage subgroups can also be constructed based on DNA fragments
common to both parents, although with lower accuracy. The parental linkage groups are
connected and oriented relative to each other based on highly informative RFLP or SSR
marker loci with three alleles (Fig. 5.2A), one of which is shared among the parents
and therefore forms an ‘allelic bridge’ between the parental linkage groups (Fig. 5.3,
Ritter et al., 1990). Software packages have been developed, which help in constructing
molecular linkage maps, taking into consideration the appropriate genetic models for non-
inbred potato [MAPRF, available from E. Ritter, NEIKER, Granja Modelo de Arkaute
(Alava), Apdo. 46, 01080 Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain; JoinMap, Stam, 1993]. Luo et al. (2001)
have developed the theory for construction of a linkage map in an autotetraploid species
using either co-dominant or dominant markers scored on two parents and their full-sib
progeny. A ‘Windows version’ of the original software (Hackett and Luo, 2003) is now
available and called ‘TetraploidMap for Windows’.

5.4 MOLECULAR MAPS OF POTATO

The first potato genetic map was constructed at Cornell University (Ithaca, USA) based
on 65 diploid F1 individuals derived from an inter-species cross between a S. phureja
seed parent and a S. tuberosum × Solanum chacoense hybrid used as pollen parent. The
markers used included a few isozymes but were mostly RFLPs, which were identified
with tomato markers of known position on the tomato molecular maps (‘TG’, ‘CD’
and ‘CT’ markers, Bonierbale et al., 1988). This was the first comparative mapping
experiment in plants and revealed the high degree of co-linearity between the potato
and tomato genomes (Section 5.5). A second inter-species map between S. tuberosum
and Solanum berthaultii was constructed using tomato RFLP markers in a population
of 155 BC1 individuals (Tanksley et al., 1992; http://www.sgn.cornell.edu). At the Max-
Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (Cologne, Germany), two diploid reference
potato RFLP maps have been constructed primarily in a S. tuberosum background, each
consisting of 24 linkage groups, 12 each for the chromosome complement of the seed
and pollen parent. The first intra-species mapping population (cid:2)BC9162(cid:3) consisted of
67 diploid BC1 individuals. DNA markers were selected de novo from potato cDNA
(‘CP’ markers) and genomic libraries (‘GP’ markers) and mapped as RFLPs (Gebhardt
et al., 1989, 1991, 2001). This map has been anchored to the tomato molecular maps
by mapping a set of chromosome-specific tomato RFLP markers (‘TG’ markers) in
the BC9162 mapping population (Gebhardt et al., 1991) and vice versa, by mapping a
set of chromosome-specific potato RFLP markers in the inter-species tomato reference
mapping population (Tanksley et al., 1992). By means of linkage group-specific DNA
markers and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the genetic map of potato was

84

Gebhardt

linked to the cytogenetic map (Dong et al., 2000). The BC9162 population has also
been instrumental for mapping the first set of potato SSR markers (‘STM’ markers)
developed at the Scottish Crop Research Institute (SCRI) (Invergowrie, Scotland) by
Milbourne et al. (1998). The second RFLP map was constructed in a population of 92
F1 individuals (population F1840), obtained by crossing a S. tuberosum seed parent with
a S. tuberosum × Solanum spegazzinii hybrid as pollen parent (Barone et al., 1990;
Gebhardt et al., 1991; Leister et al., 1996). The population F1840 was instrumental
for comparative mapping with Arabidopsis thaliana (Gebhardt et al., 2003). The F1840
and BC9162 maps are well aligned to each other due to shared RFLP markers, and
together they consist of nearly 1000 DNA marker loci including expressed sequence
tags (ESTs) and cloned potato genes. Both maps are accessible through internet in
the PoMaMo (Potato Maps and More) database at https://gabi.rzpd.de/PoMaMo.html
(Meyer et al., 2005). Tomato ‘TG’, ‘CD’ or ‘CT’ and potato ‘GP’ or ‘CP’ markers with
known position on the reference RFLP maps have been widely used in many different
mapping experiments in Solanaceous species, mainly tomato, potato and pepper, which
aimed at the localization of genetic factors controlling agronomic traits such as pathogen
resistance and tuber quality [Chapter 6 (van Eck) and Chapter 7 (Simko et al.), this
volume]. The anchor markers shared between independent mapping experiments allow to
some extent the integration of positional information obtained in different Solanaceous
species, different genetic materials and different laboratories into ‘function maps’ for
pathogen resistance (Leister et al., 1996; Grube et al., 2000; Gebhardt and Valkonen, 2001;
https://gabi.rzpd.de/PoMaMo.html) or tuber quality traits (Chen et al., 2001; Gebhardt,
2004). The majority of potato and tomato markers originally mapped as RFLPs have been
completely or partially sequenced, and the sequences are now accessible in databases
(http://www.sgn.cornell.edu, https://gabi.rzpd.de/PoMaMo.html). These ‘sequence tagged
sites’ (STS) or ‘ESTs’ in the potato/tomato genome are a valuable resource for developing
locus-specific PCR-based markers and for anchoring the potato genetic maps, including
the mapped factors for agronomic traits, to plant genome sequences of Arabidopsis, rice,
tomato, potato and other plant species, which may become available in the future.

Within a European collaborative project, an ultra-high-density (UHD) genetic map was
constructed at Wageningen University (Wageningen, The Netherlands), based on AFLP
fingerprinting of 130 diploid F1 individuals derived from crossing S. tuberosum parents
(SH× RH, Isidore et al., 2003; van Os, 2005; http://www.dpw.wageningen-ur.nl/uhd/).
New software had to be developed for reliable linkage group assignment and ordering
of approximately 10 000 AFLP fragments (van Os et al., 2005a,b). This UHD map is
the basis for constructing a potato physical map as prerequisite for sequencing the potato
genome. Another reference potato map was constructed at Wageningen University based
on 67 S. tuberosum BC individuals (C× E, Jacobs et al., 1995; Van Eck et al., 1995),
which includes RFLP, AFLP and several classical markers. As this map contains a number
of tomato ‘TG’ markers and some isozyme loci, it can be anchored to other potato and
tomato maps.

The only example for a linkage map of tetraploid potato is the AFLP linkage map
constructed at the SCRI in a tetraploid mapping population of 94 F1 plants derived from
crossing the cultivar Stirling with an advanced breeding line. Three hundred and forty-six

Molecular markers, maps and population genetics

85

AFLP markers were assigned to linkage groups, covering approximately 25% of the
genome (Meyer et al., 1998).

Multi-allelic, co-dominant SSR markers of known map position are increasingly impor-
tant for anchoring anonymous AFLP linkage groups to specific chromosome regions
(Ghislain et al., 2001; Bradshaw et al., 2004) and for genotype identification (Ghislain
et al., 2004). Genomics resources such as potato EST sequence databases can be mined
to find microsatellites, and existing RFLP maps are enriched by mapping new SSRs
(Feingold et al., 2005).

5.5 COMPARING THE POTATO WITH OTHER PLANT GENOMES

The RFLP assay is based on nucleic acid hybridization between a labelled marker probe
and a membrane-bound genomic target sequence. Hence, depending on the experimental
conditions used, cross-hybridization is detected between DNA sequences that are not
identical but similar and RFLP markers originating from one species can be used for the
construction of linkage maps in related species. Most (but not all) sequences of Solana-
ceous species that were tested, readily cross-hybridize to each other due to high sequence
similarity (cid:2)>80%(cid:3). Tomato RFLP markers were used to construct potato molecular maps
(Bonierbale et al., 1988; Tanksley et al., 1992). These experiments revealed extensive
conservation of genetic linkage (synteny) between RFLP loci detected by the same marker
probes in tomato and potato. The marker order was inverted in the potato maps relative to
tomato maps in parts of five linkage groups, indicative of paracentric inversions of arms
of potato chromosomes V, IX, X, XI and XII (Tanksley et al., 1992). Restriction fragment
length polymorphism maps using tomato markers were also constructed in inter-species
mapping populations of pepper (Capsicum ssp., Livingstone et al., 1999), the non-tuber
bearing Solanum species Solanum palustre and Solanum etuberosum (Perez et al., 1999)
and eggplant (Solanum melongena, Doganlar et al., 2002), thereby allowing comparisons
of the tomato/potato genome structure with other Solanaceous species. Clear genome
co-linearity with tomato/potato was found in all cases, but the syntenic genome segments
were more fragmented and rearranged in the other Solanaceous species when compared
with tomato and potato. The comparisons of genome structure as well as evidence from
molecular taxonomy (Spooner et al., 1993; Olmstead and Palmer, 1997) suggest that
the taxonomic placement of tomato and potato in different genera is not justified and
that Lycopersicon esculentum should be renamed as Solanum lycopersicum (Peralta I.E.,
Knapp S. and Spooner D. M., unpublished monograph, http://www.sgn.cornell.edu).

Synteny between plant species that are members of distantly related taxonomic families
is difficult to detect with hybridization-based methods due to increasing sequence diver-
gence. With the genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana completed (The Arabidopsis
Genome Initiative, 2000) and available in public databases, the comparison between the
potato molecular map and the Arabidopsis genome became feasible. The sequences of
293 RFLP markers including 31 EST markers of Arabidopsis that were used to construct
the F1840 potato map (Section 5.4) were compared to the Arabidopsis genome sequence
and mapped in silico to the physical map of Arabidopsis (Gebhardt et al., 2003). Based on
conserved linkage between groups of at least three different markers with high sequence

86

Gebhardt

similarity on the genetic map of potato and the physical map of Arabidopsis, 94 putative
syntenic blocks were identified covering 41% of the potato genetic map and 50% of the
Arabidopsis physical map. The existence and distribution of syntenic blocks suggested a
higher degree of structural conservation in some parts of the potato genome when com-
pared to others. The syntenic blocks were redundant: most potato syntenic blocks were
related to several Arabidopsis genome segments and vice versa. Particularly striking in
this respect were the short arms of potato chromosomes I and VI, which were related to
each other and to 13 and 11 Arabidopsis genome segments, respectively. These conserved
regions of the potato genome may contain the remains of an archaic plant genome. Some
duplicated potato syntenic blocks correlated well with ancient segmental duplications in
Arabidopsis. Syntenic relationships between different genomic segments of potato and
the same segment of the Arabidopsis genome indicated that potato genome evolution
included ancient intra- and inter-chromosomal duplications.

5.6 POPULATION GENETICS

Analysis of genetic linkage is based on measuring the frequency of recombination between
pairs of loci in a single meiotic generation. Alleles that are physically linked in the parents
(parental haplotypes) are transmitted together to the offspring, except when recombination
separates the two alleles. With each subsequent generation, the common transmission of
physically linked alleles (linkage disequilibrium) is reduced in proportion to the fraction
of recombination until linkage equilibrium is reached, that is, recombinant and non-
recombinant haplotypes are equally distributed in a population of individuals related
by descent. The closer the linkage between two loci, the longer linkage disequilibrium
persists over multiple meiotic generations in a population due to low frequency of recom-
bination. When a molecular marker is closely linked to a locus controlling a phenotype
of interest, for example, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for pathogen resistance, linkage
disequilibrium may exist between the marker locus and the QTL, and specific haplotypes
or marker alleles may be associated with resistance values measured in a population
of individuals related by descent. To detect association between a DNA marker and an
unknown factor controlling a quantitative character, the marker must be physically tightly
linked, whereas detection of linkage is possible over large distances (up to around 40 cM)
between pairs of loci (Lander and Schork, 1994). Ideally, the marker is located within
the gene that underlies the character of interest. In this case, linkage disequilibrium is
complete and marker polymorphisms are directly associated with allelic variation of the
phenotypic trait. The advantage of marker-trait associations as compared to marker-trait
linkages is that a marker associated with a phenotypic character is diagnostic in wide
germplasm pools, whereas a linked marker is diagnostic primarily in progeny descending
from a specific carrier of a specific trait allele.

Although the concept had been known for a long time in human population genetics
(Schlosstein et al., 1973), association studies were not feasible on a larger scale due to
the lack of sufficient numbers of genetic markers that could fulfil the criterion of tight
linkage. This situation changed when, on the one hand, DNA-based markers and DNA
sequences became available on a large scale and, on the other hand, genome research

Molecular markers, maps and population genetics

87

started to provide candidate genes for complex characters such as quantitative resistance
to pathogens in potato (Chapter 7, Simko et al., this volume) or tuber quality traits
(Chapter 6, van Eck, this volume). There are two strategies for association studies: the
genome-wide approach and the candidate gene approach. In the genome-wide approach,
a large number of markers covering the whole genome at regular intervals are genotyped
in a population of individuals related by descent. The same individuals are evaluated
for the phenotypes of interest. Appropriate statistical methods are then used to test for
significant associations between genotype and phenotype (Hirschhorn and Daly, 2005).
The candidate gene approach uses physiological, biochemical, genetic and molecular
information available for a trait of interest to make learned hypotheses about the function
or structure of the gene(s) underlying the trait of interest and focuses on genotyping in
genomic regions harbouring such candidate genes.

In potato, collections of varieties, breeding clones, landraces and wild species acces-
sions can be considered as populations of individuals related by descent. As a vegetatively
propagated crop, relatively few meiotic generations separate individual genotypes in
the contemporary pool of potato cultivars and breeding lines (Gebhardt et al., 2004;
Potato Pedigree Database: http://www.dpw.wau.nl/pv/query.asp). The feasibility of detect-
ing marker-trait associations in populations of tetraploid potato varieties and breeding
clones has been recently demonstrated. In three experiments reported so far, the can-
didate gene approach was used. In a first experiment, a collection of 600 tetraploid
potato cultivars bred between 1850 and 1990 in different countries and maintained
by the IPK germplasm bank at Groß-Lüsewitz (Germany) was genotyped with five
ASA, CAPS and SCAR markers linked to previously mapped QTL for resistance to
late blight and plant maturity on potato chromosome V. Polymorphic DNA fragments
were tested for association with these quantitative traits based on available evalua-
tion data for the cultivars. Significant marker-trait associations were detected with an
ASA marker derived from R1, a major gene for resistance to late blight (Ballvora
et al., 2002), and markers flanking the R1 locus at 0.2 cM genetic distance (Geb-
hardt et al., 2004). In the second experiment, an SSR marker closely linked (1.5 cM)
to a locus that is orthologous to the tomato Ve locus for resistance to Verticillium
dahliae on tomato/potato chromosome IX was shown to be associated with quan-
titative resistance to V. dahliae, which was evaluated in 137 tetraploid potato cul-
tivars, mostly from North America (Simko et al., 2004). In the third experiment,
DNA variation at the invGE/GF candidate locus was analysed in 188 tetraploid potato
cultivars, which have been assessed for chip quality and tuber starch content. The
invGE/GF locus on potato chromosome IX encodes two invertase genes invGE and
invGF (Maddison et al., 1999) and co-localizes with cold-sweetening QTL Sug9 (Menen-
dez et al., 2002). Two closely correlated invertase alleles were associated with bet-
ter chip quality, and a third allele was associated with lower tuber starch content
(Li et al., 2005).

The finding of marker-trait associations in tetraploid, advanced potato breeding materi-
als is exciting as it closes the gap between linkage mapping of quantitative and qualitative
traits in experimental, mostly diploid populations and DNA marker applications in breed-
ing programs. It opens the possibility to develop PCR-based markers of general diagnostic
value for parental screening and marker-assisted selection (Simko, 2004).

Genetics of Morphological and Tuber Traits

Herman J. van Eck

Laboratory of Plant Breeding, Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands

6.1 INTRODUCTION

In the genomics era, the scope of geneticists tends to diversify into molecular biology,
bioinformatics, metabolomics and so on. This chapter will describe most tuber traits from
a strict genetics point of view. Genetics in the strict sense simply refers to understanding
the heritable basis of a trait. This can be achieved by using an experimental design
that allows correlating phenotypic variation with variation at the allele or genotype
level. The genotype level is nothing else than the distribution of allelic variation at a
locus, which usually follows the Mendelian segregation rules. This allelic variation is
usually represented by genetic symbol A/a irrespective of the method to obtain genotypic
information. Currently, the genotypic information is obtained with molecular marker
techniques (Chapter 5, Gebhardt, this volume). This implies that the geneticist has the
ability to tag any locus with a marker. In this way, the geneticist can offer conclusive
evidence for the presence of a locus involved in heritable trait variation. The identity
of the locus in terms of genes, candidate genes, DNA polymorphisms or the molecular
function of this locus in biochemical or signalling functions does not have to be known.

6.1.1 The breeder’s perspective

Why is there a demand for genetic information? In most cases, the potato breeder will ask
for the hereditary basis of a phenotype, with the aim to rationalize his/her breeding efforts.
The answer that the breeder might expect is (1) the number of loci involved, (2) the
dominance relationships between alleles within and between loci and (3) the size of the
effects of the alleles and the size of the allele interactions. Often the geneticist or breeder
will not address the issue of gene function, because this is simply not a prerequisite for
breeding work. In this chapter, the issue of gene function is not entirely out of scope, but
it will not have emphasis.

6.1.2 What is heritable variation?

However, before any attempt to answer the question on the hereditary basis of a pheno-
type, it is important to realize that phenotypic variation may not have a heritable basis
at all. In many cases, there may not be any genetic variation despite severe phenotypic

differences. The phenotypic differences could be simply due to environmental influences
on the crop or the pathogen. For example, it is easy to observe remarkable differences
in infection of silver scurf (Helminthosporium solani) across genotypes. However, the
entire cultivated gene pool should be regarded as susceptible, and therefore, the varia-
tion in silver scurf infection is not heritable but entirely due to environmental effects.
Therefore, the first and most obvious aspect that needs to be investigated is the heri-
tability of a trait H 2. More specifically, we refer to broad-sense heritability in potato,
because in non-inbred species, the heritability is always the summation of additive and
dominance genetic variance. Heritability is the ratio of the variation caused by genetic
factors to the total variation caused by genes, environment and genotype–environment
(cid:2)G× E(cid:3) interactions. Heritability is by no means a fixed value for a certain trait. Across
the literature, the heritability estimates for a certain trait can show dramatic variation.
Heritability estimates are positively influenced by minimizing experimental noise or by
maximizing the phenotypic contrasts of parental genotypes.

6.1.3 Morphological and tuber traits discussed in this chapter

The inheritance of many tuber traits was first reviewed by Swaminathan and Howard
(1953) and later by Howard (1970) and Bradshaw and Mackay (1994). In this chapter,
not all classic papers will be discussed once more. Only when more recent publications
have shed new light on a classical tuber trait, the added value of the new papers will
be reviewed. The topics for this chapter can be subdivided into a number of classes of
tuber traits. Some of these classes may overlap, but this overlap is ignored to organize a
common sense order in the presentation of tuber traits. In Table 6.1, the tuber traits are
listed. Although this table is far from complete, it offers a comprehensive list of traits that
could be included when describing the idiotype of potato tubers. A subset of the tuber
traits is only presented in the table and not discussed in the text because of lack of relevant
hereditary information. For poorly understood traits such as ‘internal distribution of dry
matter’ or watery pith and growing defects such as ‘hollow hearts’ or ‘growth cracks’,
and ‘tuber size distribution’ or ‘marketable yield’, the amount of heritable variation is
unclear, or heritable variation is lacking, like the example of silver scurf, which has been
described above.

6.2 CLASSICAL POTATO GENETICS WITH MOLECULAR TECHNIQUES

6.2.1 The characteristics of classical genetic analysis

Molecular tools have fundamentally changed the experimental design of genetic stud-
ies. Conceptually, we currently think in terms of candidate genes and retrieve DNA
sequence, marker and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information from web-based
databases, such as the Solanaceae Genomics Network (http://www.sgn.cornell.edu), the
ultra dense (AFLP) map (Van Os et al., 2006; http://potatodbase.dpw.wau.nl), the potato
expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing effort as presented by, for example, The Insti-
tute for Genomic Research (TIGR) (Ronning et al., 2003), which includes sequences from

the Danish (Crookshanks et al., 2001) and Canadian (Flinn et al., 2005) EST sequencing
effort (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/potato), and the German database Potato Maps and More
(Meyer et al., 2005; http://www.gabi.rzpd.de/PoMaMo.html). These resources have fun-
damentally changed the research strategies, and within some years, the entire genome
sequence will become available (http://www.potatogenome.net). In the genomics era, it
is even harder to imagine how genetic studies were performed until the eighties of the
previous century. Usually, the genetic control of a potato trait was studied using several
F1 populations that were obtained from contrasting parental clones. Some, a few, or all of
the F1 populations would show phenotypic segregation. To fit the observed segregation
ratios of the descendants into Mendelian classes was not always easy. Analysis of F1
populations alone was not acceptable to study the inheritance of a given trait. Also selfings
(if possible) and backcrosses (BC1) with either parent were required to obtain 3:1 ratios
to provide evidence for single-gene models, or 9:7, 13:3 or other classical Mendelian
ratios to prove two-gene models with or without epistatic interactions. The summit of this
classical work is for example the three-gene models for russet skin proposed by De Jong
(1981) and Pavek and Corsini (1981). It should be regarded as a tour de force working
with such complex gene models.
Despite the above-mentioned good examples of potato genetics, there are many exam-
ples where genetic inferences were made solely on the basis of a large number of cultivar ×

94

van Eck

cultivar crosses (Lunden, 1937, 1974). In view of the complicated Mendelian ratios that
can be expected at the tetraploid level and the blurring effect of double reduction and
non-disjunction (Catcheside, 1959), the conclusions obtained from such studies should
be interpreted with care.

With this remark, I do not intend to diminish the relevance of many inheritance studies
on the cultivated potato of the previous century, which often involved workloads we
can hardly afford nowadays. Somehow, it is important to be very critical while reading
old literature, because alternative genetic models are far from being excluded. Occam’s
razor is teaching us that when the segregation data are not in disagreement with the
simplest genetic model, there is no sense in proposing a more complex genetic model.
Consequently, important genetic loci may go unnoticed just because the genetic material
was not polymorphic at that locus or because not all parental combinations were crossed
or backcrossed.

In the early days of genetics, there were quite a few geneticists who chose the potato
as their model organism. But gradually, the model organisms such as Drosophila or crops
that could be selfed, such as tomato and barley, pulled geneticists away from potato. In
species that can be selfed, important genetic stock collections became available to the
research community. One of the few geneticists who understood and contributed to the
development of such stocks was De Jong (1991). Such genetic stocks would be beneficial
for genetic studies, allowing complementation tests. With such crosses, the allelic relations
between phenotypes could be understood. The transition of classical genetics to molecular
genetic studies was marked by the attempt to generate a classical genetic map of potato
comprising morphological and isozyme markers (Jacobs et al., 1995; van Eck, 1995).
Currently, the value of a classical genetic map is no longer recognized, because the
marker numbers and the efficiency of molecular techniques offer a valid substitute for
morphological markers (Chapter 5, Gebhardt, this volume).

6.2.2 The characteristics of molecular genetic analysis

The field of potato genetics has considerably changed with the advent of molecular
genetic markers. Co-localization of a phenotype on a genetic linkage map has replaced
the complementation test for allelism. Hence, the lack of genetic stock collections is not
perceived as a limitation.

Ploidy level is still perceived as a limitation in genetic studies, and this has not been
alleviated by molecular markers. Most molecular marker techniques do not allow full
classification (all alleles can be identified) at the tetraploid level, not even the most multi-
allelic microsatellite loci. On the contrary, most often only two or three alleles per locus are
displayed with co-dominant techniques, whereas AFLP displays only one allele per locus.
This lack of full classification is a severe problem for the detection of linkage between
marker loci, because in tetrasomic inheritance, linkage in repulsion (trans configuration)
between marker alleles will be observed as independent segregation. Only marker alleles
linked in coupling phase (cis configuration) will demonstrate association, where simplex
genotypes are most easy to interpret.

Only one research group can be recognized for its contributions to tetraploid genetics
in potato. The Scottish Crop Research Institute (SCRI) has developed not only a tetraploid

Genetics of morphological and tuber traits

95

map (Meyer et al., 1998) but also a series of analysis tools to calculate linkage maps at
the tetraploid level (Hackett et al., 2001, 2003; Luo et al., 2001). The principle behind
the construction of a tetraploid linkage map is the placement of sufficient single-dose
markers on the 96 linkage groups (2 parents × 4 homologous chromosomes × 12) in
conjunction with duplex markers that can bridge between linkage groups from the same
homologous chromosome.

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis will be feasible for simplex QTL alleles, such
as quantitatively inherited resistance traits (Meyer et al., 1998; Bryan et al., 2002, 2004;
Bradshaw et al., 2004). The genetic model assuming simplex inheritance does not follow
from the study per se but is justified from pedigree information on the introgression of
resistance from wild Solanum species. QTL analysis allowing the modelling of multiple
alleles and multiple allele interactions at QTL loci is probably feasible once potato has
reached a stage of identification of haplotypes that is currently pursued in human genetics.
At the diploid level, not only the genetics is simpler but also phenotypic assessment
and trait selection are less ambiguous. Diploids show their phenotypes much better! A
single diploid offspring shows segregation (usually transgressive) for a large number of
traits, but the spectrum of phenotypes easily exceeds the entire diversity in trait values of
tetraploid cultivars shown in the National List. Some examples of trait loci with a wide
spectrum of phenotypic variation are given by Celis Gamboa (2002) and Celis Gamboa
et al. (2003). The genetic explanation for this phenomenon (that diploids show their
phenotypes better) is the probability of finding two outstanding alleles in one diploid
versus the chance of having four of those alleles in a tetraploid. As an illustration, we
assume two different alleles (+ and −) in diploid heterozygous crossing parents, resulting
in 1/4++(cid:4) 1/2+−(cid:4) 1/4−− offspring, whereas duplex crossing parents will generate
only 1/36++++ and 1/36−−−− offspring at the tetraploid level.

6.2.3 Quantitative and qualitative genetic approaches

Throughout this chapter, listing tuber traits as qualitatively or quantitatively inherited
characters has been avoided. This distinction is obvious in the case of textbooks that
need to explain the difference between Mendelian genetics and quantitative genetics,
but in reality, this distinction is artificial. Many traits can be viewed and studied from
both the qualitative and the quantitative perspective. For example, the breeder’s eye can
classify segregating offspring genotypes. For flesh colour, the classes white or yellow
and, for tuber shape, the classes round or long will allow the unambiguous identification
of a single locus on the genetic map of potato. On the contrary, flesh colour and tuber
shape phenotypes can be recorded in ordinal classes or metric units, respectively. Ordinal
classification of flesh colour ranging from 1 to 9 (cid:2)1 = white(cid:5) (cid:5) (cid:5) 9 = intense yellow(cid:3) can
be applied to show the distribution of phenotypes in a mapping population. The resulting
chart may show a bi-modal distribution, which offers a justification for the breeder’s
eye classification of the offspring in Mendelian classes. The variation observed within
the major classes ‘white’ and ‘yellow’ still needs an explanation. Besides the locus that
explains the presence or absence of flesh colour, there is no data on any different locus
that can explain flesh colour intensity differences within the classes ‘white’ and ‘yellow’.

van Eck

Likewise, tuber shape can be recorded as a metric trait (length/width ratio) for QTL
analysis. The chromosomal position of the trait locus obtained with metric data in a
QTL analysis approach should coincide with the position obtained with the Mendelian
segregation of phenotypic classes (round vs. long) in a normal linkage mapping approach
where a morphological marker is mapped along with molecular markers (van Eck et al.,
1994). The ability to switch from the discrete classifications to continuously distributed
metric observations (from linkage mapping to QTL mapping) is a requirement to achieve
accurate results. An integration of both approaches allows exploiting the information
offered by flanking markers to distinguish between offspring with and without recom-
bination events near the QTL. This can improve the mapping of the trait locus position
considerably (Peleman et al., 2005) both at high and at low offspring numbers.

6.3 THE GENETICS OF MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS

6.3.1 Tuber flesh colour

A large number of tuber flesh phenotypes are shown in Fig. 6.1. From the natural
diversity in pigmentation patterns, a collection of colourful crisps were produced and
sold as ‘Inca crisps’. These pigmentation phenotypes comprise combinations of different
pigments and pigment patterns. The red and blue pigments are caused by anthocyanins, and
their localized expression suggests tissue-specific transcription of the underlying genes
involved in the synthesis of anthocyanins. The tissues in which anthocyanin pigmentation
can be observed are the vascular bundle or one or more of the three distinct parenchyma
tissue types. Parenchyma tissues differ by their ontogeny: the cortex, the peri-medullary
zone and the central pith. The arms of medullary parenchyma often radiate from the pith
into the peri-medullary zone (Fig. 6.2).

The genetic loci

involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins are described in
section 6.3.2 dealing with tuber skin colour. Studies by Lewis et al. (1998a,b) offer a
quantification of the major anthocyanins, flavonoids and phenolic acids in tubers of wild
Solanum species and cultivated potato with coloured skins and/or flesh using analytical
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

The genes involved in tissue-specific regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis belong to
a complex locus, first analysed by Dodds (1955). The complex locus probably represented
a series of multiple alleles or a clustered gene family comprising the B-I-F linkage group
(Dodds and Long, 1956). The B-I-F group represents closely linked genes involved in the
pigmentation of many tissue types. Alleles of the B-locus, Bd > Bc > Bb > Ba > b in order
of dominance, are distinguished. Bd produces in the seed a band of pigment on the node
of the hypocotyl of the embryo and, in the mature plant, a band of pigment at each node,
a coloured floral abscission layer and a coloured eyebrow on the tuber. With Bc, a band
of pigment at each node of the mature plant is absent, but other effects are like those of
Bd. Bb gives a coloured floral abscission layer and a coloured eyebrow on the tuber. With
Ba, only the floral abscission layer is coloured (Dodds and Long, 1956). The remaining
two loci of this cluster are flower colour (F -locus) and tuber skin colour (I-locus), which
have been mapped close to TG63 on potato chromosome X (van Eck et al., 1993a,b).

After this detour, we need to return to anthocyanin pigmentation of tuber flesh. It could
be hypothesized that this trait could also be controlled by the complex B-I-F cluster
on chromosome X. Evidence for this hypothesis was offered by De Jong (1987), who
observed close linkage between a single locus involved in pigmented flesh (Pf-locus) and
the I-locus involved in tuber skin colour. The I-locus, which controls the distribution of
pigment to the tuber skin, was found to be necessary for the expression of Pf.

More general than anthocyanins, tuber flesh can exhibit yellow pigmentation due to
carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin (Lu et al., 2001). The regulation of caroteno-
genesis during the tuber life cycle in potato tubers was recently described by Morris et al.
(2004). Genetic studies on tuber flesh colour started with qualitative analysis of pheno-
typic variation using two classes, yellow and white, disregarding shades of yellowness
within these classes. This resulted in the postulation of the Y -locus, where yellow (Y .) is
dominant over white (yy) (Frühwirth, 1912). The different degrees of yellowness within
these main classes have always been attributed to genetic background or modifiers. Brown
et al. (1993) described another flesh colour phenotype: orange. The trait was found in
Solanum stenotomum and Solanum phureja germplasm. The orange phenotype appeared
to be controlled by the Or-allele, a third allele at the Y -locus, which is dominant over the
effect of the Y or y allele. The orange flesh phenotype appeared to be highly correlated
with the content of zeaxanthin in the flesh (Brown et al., 1993).

The Y -locus has been mapped to chromosome III (Bonierbale et al., 1988; Jacobs
et al., 1995), offering a simple morphological marker locus. The gene(s) underlying the
Y -locus remains to be identified. On the basis of syntenic map positions on tomato and
pepper chromosomes, two candidate genes have been implied for the Y -locus in potato
(Thorup et al., 2000). They proposed a phytoene synthase, the Psy gene, and a (cid:6)-carotene
hydroxylase, the CrtZ-2 gene encoding an enzyme that converts (cid:6)-carotene to zeaxanthin.
Metabolic engineering using a phytoene synthase indeed resulted in high-carotenoid
potato tubers containing enhanced levels of (cid:6)-carotene and lutein (Ducreux et al., 2005).
Another example of metabolic engineering is provided by Diretto et al. (2006), who could
enhance potato tuber carotenoid levels through tuber-specific silencing of the lycopene
epsilon cyclase (CrtL-e) gene. At this moment, there is no further information on how
allelic variation in these genes relates to allelic variation in the Y -locus.

Quantitative genetic analysis of the intensity of yellow pigmentation has not yet
resulted in additional QTL positions involved in yellow flesh colour at other chromoso-
mal locations. This leaves the question unanswered as to whether the Y -locus on potato
chromosome III is only involved in qualitative differences and what is causing the quan-
titative differences in yellowness. Significant differences among environments and G× E
interaction have been observed for yellow flesh intensity, but in view of the high broad-
sense heritability of 0.93 (Haynes et al., 1996), the influence of environmental factors on
the yellow trait should be of limited concern.

Carotenoid content (neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein-5,6-epoxide, lutein, zeaxanthin
and an unknown carotenoid) appeared to be highly correlated with the intensity of yellow
pigmented tuber flesh colour (Lu et al., 2001). This exponential relationship between total
carotenoid content and tuber yellow intensity suggests that selecting for more intense
yellow flesh will result in increasingly higher levels of carotenoids (Wu et al., 2001).

Genetics of morphological and tuber traits

Collectively, these tuber flesh pigments, carotenoids, anthocyanins and their phenolic
and flavonoid precursors, are regarded as beneficial secondary metabolites for human
consumption and pathogen defence. Most secondary metabolites act as potent antioxidants.
Concentrations of these components that underline the high nutritional value of potato
are given by Brown (2005). Further enrichment of potato with these functional food
components seems feasible in view of the superior breeding lines identified by Brown
et al. (2005), but it will never turn potato into a red beet or carrot. Furthermore, consumer
acceptance of intensely coloured potato flesh, having different taste characteristics, should
not be overestimated. Phenolic acids and flavonoids also aid in plant defence (Hahlbrock
and Scheel, 1989), and the observation that much higher concentrations of phenolic acids,
flavonoids and anthocyanins are found in the skin rather than in the flesh supports this
hypothesis, as the skin is the first barrier of defence against pathogens and pests.

6.3.2 Tuber skin and flower colour

The skin of the potato tuber is composed of two layers, the cortex and the epidermis,
often referred to as the phelloderm (outermost cell layers of the cortex) and the periderm
(the epidermal part of the tuber skin that is susceptible to shear in immature condition),
respectively. Pigmentation of the skin can be observed in the cortex (controlled by locus
Ico) and/or epidermis (controlled by locus Iep) on potato chromosome X (van Eck et al.,
1993b). In the previous literature, four different names, R, E, I and PSC, have been used
for the locus on chromosome X involved in tuber skin colour. The symbol PSC (Gebhardt
et al., 1989) was only used because it was unknown whether the segregation for skin
colour was due to segregation of a locus involved in anthocyanin production or a locus
for tissue-specific expression. The symbols R and E are loci proposed in older literature
on tetraploid potato but should no longer be used. The phenotype of R (Lunden, 1937)
differs from R/Rpw (Dodds and Long, 1955), but both suggest pigment production rather
than tissue-specific gene regulation. For the same reason, symbol E (Lunden, 1937) is
rejected as it should result in a weak pink pigmentation of the tuber epidermis, even in the
absence of D or P. The symbol I (Dodds and Long, 1956) is to be preferred to indicate
tissue-specific expression of anthocyanin pigmentation in the tuber skin (van Eck et al.,
1993b). To accommodate for the difference between pigmented cortex and epidermis, it
was proposed to add a suffix to symbol I (cid:2)Ico and Iep; van Eck et al., 1993b). It is not
clear whether Ico and Iep should be regarded as different alleles (like the series of alleles
at the B-locus; Dodds and Long, 1956) or two different loci that comprise the B-I-F
linkage group (Dodds and Long, 1956).

Apart from the two layers of the skin, the pigmentation can be restricted to certain areas
within these skin layers. The phenotypes are named ‘splashed’ or ‘spotted’ (pigmentation in
a zone surrounding the eyes), ‘spectacled’ (a coloured tuber without pigmentation around
the eyes), ‘pigmented eyebrow’, which is nothing else than a nodal band controlled by locus
B, and ‘pigmented eyes’. Because no recent work has been published on these phenotypes,
the earlier reviews by Howard (1970) and Bradshaw and Mackay (1994) are still adequate.
Recent progress in the identification of the genes controlling tuber pigmentation was
made by De Jong et al. (2004), who published a series of papers that described loci
involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins. With primers for all published genes in

100

van Eck

the pathway (pathway mapping), the candidates for the loci R(cid:4) P and I were identified
(De Jong et al., 2004).

The R-locus on chromosome II (van Eck et al., 1993a) is required for the production
of red pelargonidin-based anthocyanin pigments in any tissue of the plant, including tuber
skin and flower petals. The production of pelargonidins in plants requires the activity of
dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) to catalyse the reduction of dihydrokaempferol into leu-
copelargonidin. To test the hypothesis that potato R encodes DFR, portions of both dfr
alleles were sequenced from a diploid potato clone known to be heterozygous Rr. Sequence
comparison revealed a sequence polymorphism, diagnostic for the phenotype of R, both in
three mapping populations and in a wide range of cultivars. The red allele (cid:2)R(cid:3) is predicted
to encode a 382-amino acid protein that differs at 10 amino acid positions from the gene
products of the two alternative alleles (cid:2)r(cid:3). The observation of a single R-allele (haplotype)
is also consistent with a half-century-old hypothesis (Dodds and Long, 1955), suggesting
that R arose just once during the domestication of potato (De Jong et al., 2003a).

Using allele-specific fluorescently labelled primers in a TaqMan assay, the allele dosage
could be analysed. This allowed not only the determination of the zygosity at locus R
in diploids but also the assignment of quadruplex, triplex, duplex, simplex and nulliplex
genotypes for the red dfr allele at the tetraploid level (De Jong et al., 2003b).

The P-locus, mapped to chromosome XI (van Eck et al., 1993a), is required for the
production of blue/purple anthocyanin pigments in any tissue of the potato plant such
as tubers, flowers or stems. Locus P in potato co-localized to a candidate gene coding
(cid:2)
for the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzyme flavonoid 3
h(cid:3), to the
same region on chromosome 11 in tomato (De Jong et al., 2003a). Evidence that locus
P encodes this enzyme was obtained by a complementation test. A potato f3
h cDNA
clone was introduced into the red-skinned cultivar Desiree, and transformants displayed
purple delphinidin-based pigments in tuber and stem tissues that are coloured red in
Desiree (Jung et al., 2005).

Locus I on chromosome X, required for tissue-specific expression in tuber skin,
appeared to correspond to Petunia locus an2, encoding an R2R3 Myb domain transcrip-
tional regulator of the anthocyanin pathway (Borovsky et al., 2004; De Jong et al., 2004).
Locus F was mentioned already, as it belongs to the B-I-F linkage group. The F -locus
(Lunden, 1937) controls pink, blue or purple pigmentation of the flower in the presence
of D.pp, ddP. and D.P., respectively, or white flowers (D.P.ff or ddppF.). The recessive ff
genotypes as described by Dodds and Long (1956) have flecked flowers, which is probably
a leaky allele. Flower colour patterns with only pigmentation in the tips of the corolla or
the reverse – white tips – could be the result of other (leaky) alleles of the F -locus.

6.3.3 Tuber shape

Tuber shape is a syndrome of many characters, which have contributed to a rich spectrum
of cultivar names such as ‘Kidney’, having a strong degree of flatness, ‘Pink Fir Apple’
with a tuberosed form resembling a pinecone (due to extreme bulking of the tuber area
between the eyes), ‘Asparges’, a very long tuber, ‘Banana’, ‘Long Pinkeye’ and ‘muizen’,
an ovate form tapering at the apical end. For pictures, I refer to page 277 in the publication
by Bradshaw and Mackay (1994). More systematically, the tuber shape characters can

Genetics of morphological and tuber traits

101

be subdivided into the following components: (1) length/width ratio (cid:2)I(cid:3) describing the
overall shape, (2) tapering of the heel-end and/or the rose-end, where oblong tuber shapes
could be viewed as the other extreme of highly tapered tuber ends, and (3) straightness
of the length axis. The older literature has been reviewed by De Jong and Burns (1993)
and Bradshaw and Mackay (1994).

Only for the overall tuber shape is the inheritance somewhat understood. The basic
notion described in various older publications indicates that tuber shape is regulated by
a single locus Ro, where round (Ro_) is dominant over long (roro). De Jong and Rowe
(1972) confirmed linkage between loci involved in tuber shape and skin colour. Both loci
indeed map close to TG63 on potato chromosome X (van Eck et al., 1993b, 1994; Jacobs
et al., 1995). Nevertheless, the genetic model described here does not satisfactorily explain
the observation of tuber shapes ranging from round (cid:2)I < 1(cid:7)4(cid:3) to oval (cid:2)1(cid:7)5 < I < 1(cid:7)9(cid:3) to
long (cid:2)I > 2(cid:7)0(cid:3). In the paper of 1993, De Jong and Burns could phenotypically identify
all three possible genotypes (RoRo, Roro and roro) that were segregating in their genetic
material. This suggests incomplete dominance at the Ro-locus. Nevertheless, tuber shape
phenotypes are not confined to these three classes but display a continuous distribution.
Continuously distributed traits are often interpreted as being controlled by polygenes, but
in the case of tuber shape, the single gene hypothesis is maintained. At the Ro-locus, a
series of multiple alleles can explain all intermediate shapes between round (going to flat)
and long (van Eck et al., 1994). At the tetraploid level, multiple alleles can make large
numbers of allele combinations and intralocus allele interactions, which may explain the
continuous range of tuber shape phenotypes. At the molecular level, the function of the
Ro-locus is not understood, and once this gene has been cloned, further analysis of alleles
and allele effects can be investigated.

Tuber shape has been studied in correlation with tissue composition (Tai and Misener,
1994). They concluded a positive association between the length of the tuber and the
narrowness of the pith, suggesting that long potatoes have a narrow pith and were inclined
to have a smaller volume of pith. No clear association with other traits, such as specific
gravity, was observed.

6.3.4 Eye depth

After decades without research on the inheritance of eye depth, Li et al. (2005b) published
a paper that not only offers a good overview of past hypothesis on eye depth but also
identifies a monogenic locus Eyd/eyd on chromosome X at 4-cM distance from tuber
shape locus Ro/ro. The correlation between eye depth and tuber shape was noticed before
(Maris, 1962, 1966), but correlation may imply two different hypotheses – (1) one locus
with a pleiotropic effect on tuber shape and eye depth and (2) two closely linked loci that
independently influence eye depth and tuber shape.

The first hypothesis would imply that one gene involved in the elongation or shortening
of the longitudinal growth acts not only on the heel–apical bud axis but also on the axis
towards the lateral buds. The observation of long tubers with deep eyes and round tubers
with shallow eyes argues against this hypothesis or suggests more than one mechanism
to regulate eye depth. By choosing other parental clones, these hypotheses could be
unravelled. Segregating offspring for eye depth that are not polymorphic for tuber shape

102

van Eck

would be free of pleiotropic effects caused by tuber shape and preferably in both a long
and a round tuber genetic background.

Li et al. (2005b) classified both tuber shape and eye depth in three classes, where the
intermediate classes contained only a few descendants. Li et al. (2005b) did not specify a
genetic model for tuber shape and eye depth that accommodates the intermediate classes.
This is not trivial, because the genetic distance between both traits is largely based on the
intermediate phenotypes. Recombinant analysis using the information of flanking marker
loci would reinforce their conclusions on the issue of genetic distance between the Eyd
and Ro loci. Flanking markers would also allow clarifying the issue of the intermediate
phenotypes for tuber shape and eye depth.

6.3.5 Tuber skin characters

The tuber skin displays many heritable characters such as skin thickness, smoothness
and transparency, appearance of lenticels, skin adhesion strength and susceptibility to
scuffing damage during harvest. Breeders’ preferences for specific skin types are highly
divergent across continents. In North America, Russet skin is regarded as a positive
character, whereas European breeders prefer a thin, smooth, shiny and transparent skin.
In the latter case, the cream to yellow tuber colour is predominantly determined by the
underlying flesh colour. This skin type is not without risk, because light-induced greening
of tuber flesh will show off immediately. Nevertheless, the selling of washed and pre-
packed potatoes, as well as the ability to serve unpeeled potato dishes, is a trend in
Europe that demands the smooth skin. The inheritance of most skin-related characters is
largely unknown, but most of the above-mentioned characters are relatively stable across
environments, suggesting a high value for the heritability.

Bowen et al. (1996) showed clear genotypic differences in skin adhesion strengths
and independence of this character from other skin morphological characteristics such
as skin thickness, cell size and suberin content. The inheritance of resistance to scuffing
damage (skin-set) is not yet clear. Studies by Lulai and Freeman (2001) established a
paradigm whereby the thickening and strengthening of tuber phellogen cell walls upon
periderm maturation are the determinant for resistance to tuber excoriation. These cellular
processes and their interaction with environmental factors will result in a low heritability
for this trait. Nevertheless, it appeared to be feasible to determine genotypic differences
in skin-set (Lulai and Orr, 1993).
Segregation between brown and colourless skin was observed by Kukimura (1972)
in the cross Spartaan × Maris Piper, and they suggested that brown tuber skin could
be dominant. The most studied skin character is russeting, which was studied by De
Jong (1981) and Pavek and Corsini (1981). Both papers describe the requirement of
three complementary dominant genes to develop a russet skin. No correlation between
these three loci was observed, suggesting positions on different linkage groups. For the
dominant alleles, additivity was concluded, because homozygosity results in a stronger
russet phenotype. Early selection for russet skin in seedling generation relies on the
heritability of the phenotype and the lack of G × E interactions. Love et al. (1997)
concluded that positive selection for russet skin is feasible in early generations. Negative
selection should be applied on the incidence and severity of russet patchiness. Early

Genetics of morphological and tuber traits

103

selection for uniformity of skin russeting was not recommended, suggesting a stronger
influence of non-heritable effects.

6.4 GENETICS OF TUBER PHYSIOLOGY

6.4.1 Tuberization

In this book, an entire section is dedicated to plant growth and development, including chap-
ters on tuber induction, tuber growth, dormancy and sprouting. Therefore, this paragraph
will only briefly touch on genetic aspects of tuberization and dormancy. The identification
of QTL involved in tuberization (Van den Berg et al., 1996a) will require a specific set of
conditions in the first place that are permissive to the ability to tuberize. Therefore, analy-
sis of tuberization will be strongly confounded by those environmental conditions, referred
to as G× E interactions. Jackson (1999) lists six key factors that promote tuber formation:
short day length, phytochrome, high light, high sucrose, low temperature and low nitrogen
levels. Reproducible results with high heritabilities can be obtained only if these factors
are controlled well during genetic experiments. These factors influence multiple signalling
pathways for which many candidate genes can be proposed, a list of genes almost too large
to be tested for association with tuber formation QTL. Furthermore, epistatic interactions
(cid:2)G×G(cid:3) should also be expected between these many loci. Recently, Dr. Christiane Gebhardt
(Max-Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Germany) mapped a large
number of candidate genes involved in perception of environmental conditions, hormone
synthesis and perception (unpublished work, personal communication), as well as candidate
genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (Chen et al., 2001).

These candidate genes can be mapped to identify co-localization with QTL (see below),
but also to perform reverse genetic studies, or to deploy these genes in genetically modi-
fied (GM) potato cultivars. Two examples of GM applications of candidate genes are given
here. The enhanced expression of phytochrome B promotes tuber formation and yield.
The PHYB transgenics also showed higher maximum photosynthesis due to increased leaf
stomatal conductance (Boccalandro et al., 2003). Constitutive expression of CONSTANS
impairs tuberization under short-day inductive conditions (Martínez-García et al., 2002).

Besides these reverse genetic approaches, two forward genetic studies have resulted in
the publication of QTL positions involved in tuberization. Van den Berg et al. (1996a)
used short-day-induced nodal cuttings to measure the rate of tuber induction. Eleven loci
on seven chromosomes were associated with variation in tuberization. Most of the loci
had small effects, but a Solanum tuberosum-derived QTL allele explained 27% of the
variance and mapped close to TG441 on chromosome V. The second study by Simko
et al. (1999) showed that similar results could be obtained with greenhouse and in vitro
grown plants. The most significant QTL for earliness of tuberization in vitro was located
on chromosome VIII, coinciding with QTL for sucrose concentration in leaf exudates.
Simko et al. (1999) have also discussed the relation between earliness of tuberization and
early crop maturity. In this connection, the QTL gt5.1 for earliness of tuberization on the
whole plant (interval TG441–CD31, on chromosome V) has been consistently detected as
the most significant QTL (logarithm of odds (LOD) ranging from 3.3 to 10.4) associated

104

van Eck

with tuberization and maturity in eight independent experiments (including Van den Berg
et al., 1996a,b) and regardless of the way tuberization was measured. Furthermore, Simko
et al. (1999) have noted that this QTL maps to the same general location as the one
detected for potato maturity (van Eck, 1995; van Eck and Jacobsen, 1996) and foliage
blight resistance (Simko, 2002).

6.4.2 Dormancy, sprouting

The first two studies on QTL involved in potato tuber dormancy or sprouting (Freyre
et al., 1994; Van den Berg et al., 1996b) are not easily compared because of the different
wild diploid crossing parents. Freyre et al. (1994) detected QTL for tuber dormancy in
a (S. tuberosum × Solanum chacoense) × S. phureja mapping population. S. phureja
has much shorter dormancy than S. tuberosum and contributed dominant genes for
tuber dormancy (Freyre et al., 1994), whereas Solanum berthaultii in the second study
(Van den Berg et al., 1996b) had a much longer dormancy than S. tuberosum and con-
tributed recessive genes for long dormancy (Simko et al., 1997). In second study, eight
QTL involved with tuber dormancy were detected (Van den Berg et al., 1996b), and these
loci were somewhat congruent with those obtained for tuberization (Van den Berg et al.,
1996a). Coinciding QTL for dormancy and tuberization might be expected if genes at
these QTL are involved in similar phytohormone signalling pathways. Therefore, Simko
et al. (1997) analysed variation in abscisic acid (ABA) in this mapping population. At
least three loci (TG234, TG155 and TG499) on three chromosomes (2, 4 and 7, respec-
tively) were associated with variation in ABA content. No correlation was observed
between ABA content and dormancy with conventional correlation testing, but relation-
ships between ABA level and dormancy could be demonstrated through the similarity
between QTL positions and epistatic interactions (Simko et al., 1997). Another follow-up
study resulted in the mapping of more hormone QTL (polyamines, ABA, tuberonic acid,
tuberonic acid glucoside, zeatin riboside and gibberellin A1), some of which coincided
with the QTL for tuberization or dormancy (Ewing et al., 2004).

Parallel to the association of phytohormones, the carbohydrate metabolism also appears
to be involved in dormancy. The expression of transgenes resulted in the observations
that a bacterial phosphoglucomutase (PGM) could considerably delay tuber sprouting
(Lytovchenko et al., 2005) and a bacterial pyrophosphatase could both delay (Hajirezaei
and Sonnewald, 1999) and accelerate sprouting (Farré et al., 2001). A vast majority of
loci involved in carbohydrate metabolism have been mapped on the potato function map
(Chen et al., 2001), but future research is required to investigate candidate genes that
co-localize with QTL associated with tuber formation and dormancy.

6.5 TUBER QUALITY TRAITS

6.5.1 Starch content

Often dry matter content and starch content are used as synonyms. This is only partially
true, as protein – for example – is included in dry matter as well. However, it is obvious

Genetics of morphological and tuber traits

105

that dry matter content is largely determined by starch content. Other names for the same
trait are ‘specific gravity’ and ‘underwater weight’. In view of the strong correlation with
starch content, the genetics of tuber yield or yield is addressed as well.

The trait is most important for the processing industry (starch, crisps and French
fries) and moderately important for table use, although fashionable ‘low-carb diets’ may
increase the demand for cultivars with lower starch content. For the processing industry,
not only dry matter content is important but also the distribution of dry matter in the
tuber. Watery pith results in reduced quality of finished product (fries or crisps). The
pith usually has reduced starch content, but the size and shape of the pith and the level
of starch reduction strongly depend on genotype. So far, nothing has been published on
this trait. As mentioned before, Tai and Misener (1994) could not detect a correlation
between pith characters and specific gravity of the entire tuber.

With a growing season of 80 days, early maturing cultivars will not be able to produce
the same amounts of starch or tuber yield, as compared with late maturing cultivars, which
grow for 120 days. The profound impact of maturity type will overshadow the remaining
genetic variation for starch content and tuber yield. This sharp effect is comparable with
the overruling effect of a dwarfing (short-straw) gene segregating in cereal mapping
studies on grain yield.

QTL analysis of starch content (as many other traits) certainly benefits from the
inclusion of maturity type as co-variable in statistical analysis or the mapping of the
residuals. Such QTL analysis methods were explored in a study on foliage late blight,
also known to be associated with maturity (Visker et al., 2003).

Studies that describe starch content or yield QTL (Freyre and Douches, 1994a,b;
Schäfer-Pregl et al., 1998; Gebhardt et al., 2005) allow the conclusion that tuber starch
content and tuber yield are truly quantitative and polygenic traits. Genes contributing
to the phenotypic effects are located on all chromosomes (Gebhardt et al., 2005). This
also applies to reducing sugars, as described in the next section. Furthermore, extensive
co-localization of QTL for tuber starch, sugar content and yield has been observed (Chen
et al., 2001; Menéndez et al., 2002; Gebhardt et al., 2005).

Besides starch content, starch quality properties (such as the ratio of amylose to
amylopectin, degree of phosphorylation, granule size and gelatinization temperature) are
of great importance for various applications of starch and starch derivatives in food and
non-food industry. Strong genotypic effects have been observed for starch quality traits.
However, the genetics of starch quality properties are considered to be outwith the scope
of this chapter (e.g. the reviews by Ball et al., 1998; Blennow et al., 2002; Davis et al.,
2003; Jobling, 2004). Most candidate genes implied for starch quality properties have
been mapped in the context of the QTL studies (Chen et al., 2001) discussed in this
section.

6.5.2 Discolouration

6.5.2.1 After-cooking darkening

Discolouration of potato tuber products is caused enzymatically, black-spot bruising and
enzymatic oxidative discolouration, or non-enzymatically, after-cooking darkening and

106

van Eck

the Maillard reaction (Kolbe and Haasse, 1997). In the next sections, these traits will be
discussed.

After-cooking darkening is an undesirable tuber trait, which is observed as a bluish-grey
haze after cooking when potatoes are exposed to air. Breeding programmes aiming for
table potatoes or processing industry (blanched, steam peeled, pre-packed or French fries)
have to select cultivars with low susceptibility for this trait. Chemically, the blackening is
due to the formation of a colourless reduced ferrous ion–chlorogenic acid complex in the
potato. The ferrous complex is then non-enzymatically oxidized to a dark ferric complex
following exposure to oxygen in the air (reviewed by Friedman, 1997).

The potential for darkening can be measured in two ways: (1) by a test involving
a waiting period of 1–12 h for full colour development after steaming and (2) by a
chemical test based on reaction of chlorogenic acid with a mixture of urea, tartaric acid
and sodium nitrite (Mann and Lambert, 1989). The latter is a rapid, histological staining
method based on the formation of a cherry-red colour of nitrosylated chlorogenic acid.
The histological method for visualizing chlorogenic acid in potato tissues agreed with
after-cooking darkening in a blanching fry test. The severity of darkening is dependent on
the ratio of chlorogenic acid to citric acid concentrations in the potato tubers. Higher ratio
normally results in darker tubers (Silva et al., 1991). Furthermore, chelating agents inhibit
potato blackening by competing with chlorogenic acid for ferrous ion chelating sites.
The concentration of chlorogenic and citric or ascorbic acids is genetically controlled
and influenced by environmental conditions (Wang-Pruski et al., 2003; Wang-Pruski and
Nowak, 2004). Chlorogenic acid is the major polyphenol in potato and may account for
about 80% of the total phenolic acids (Brown, 2005).

A number of candidate genes could be proposed, from the shikimate and the phenyl-
propanoid pathways, but these will influence many more phenotypes caused by the
intermediates and products of this pathway. The final step resulting in chlorogenic acid
is catalysed by quinate-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HQT), which couples caffeoyl-
d-glucose to d-quinic acid (Friedman, 1997). The potato HQT gene sequence has been
identified in cultivar Kuras via an EST sequencing project (Crookshanks et al., 2001).
Overexpression of HQT in tomato caused plants to accumulate higher levels of chloro-
genic acid, with no side effects on the levels of other soluble phenolics, and to show
improved resistance to infection by a bacterial pathogen (Niggeweg et al., 2004).

Besides HQT, there are candidate genes that are associated with the level of citric acid.
Enhancement of citric acid would not only reduce after-cooking blackening but may also
influence acrylamide formation during the production of baked or fried products (Jung
et al., 2003). Asparagine, a major free amino acid in potato, is the crucial participant in
the production of acrylamide during the Maillard reaction, but lowering the pH limits the
formation of acrylamide (Jung et al., 2003).

6.5.2.2 Enzymatic discolouration and black-spot bruising

Enzymatic discolouration is the process in which phenolic compounds are oxidized by
the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO) to quinones and the quinones transformed to dark
pigments (Friedman, 1997). Prevention of enzymatic browning is currently achieved by
the use of sulfiting agents – an undesirable additive to human food – but clear genotypic

Genetics of morphological and tuber traits

107

differences in the level of enzymatic discolouration could be exploited as well. The
inheritance of susceptibility to discolouration is determined by the inheritance of the
levels of phenolic compounds, including tyrosine (Corsini et al., 1992), and the enzyme
PPO. PPO has been proved to be one of the key factors in enzymatic discolouration.
Antisense inhibition of PPO clearly blocked discolouration (Bachem et al., 1994). PPO
in potato consists of a gene family of at least six genes, namely POTP1 and POTP2
(Hunt et al., 1993) and POT32, POT33, POT41 and POT72 (Thygesen et al., 1995).
The genes are differentially expressed, with POT32 being the major form expressed in
tubers besides POT33 and POT72. POTP1 and POTP2 are mainly expressed in leaves
and flowers (Thygesen et al., 1995). The tissue-specific expression can also be deduced
from the work of Newman et al. (1993), where they found differential expression of the
PPOs in tomato, with these PPOs sharing greater identity with their interspecific homolog
(tomato–potato) than with the other intraspecific PPOs (paralogs). Therefore, POT32 is
now strongly implicated as a candidate gene for enzymatic discolouration.

The phenolic compounds oxidized by PPO are chlorogenic acid and tyrosine, but
no correlation was observed between the level of chlorogenic acid and discolouration
(Friedman, 1997). A high correlation between tyrosine content and the results of the
abrasive peel test, comparable with enzymatic discolouration, was detected by Corsini
et al. (1992). Another determinant was the partitioning of tyrosine between tuber protein
and the free amino acid pool, where high free amino acid levels corresponded with a high
level of discolouration. However, Mondy and Munshi (1993) reported that although a
correlation between free tyrosine and discolouration is observed, tyrosine does not seem
to be the sole determining factor for enzymatic discolouration.

External impact on potato tubers can result in different types of subsurface damage,
such as shatter bruising and black-spot bruising (reviewed by Storey and Davies, 1992;
Bradshaw and Mackay, 1994; McGarry et al., 1996). Young tubers, at harvest, with high
turgor have a lower potential to develop black spot but will develop shatter bruising in
return. Black-spot bruising appears as melanin formation surrounding the starch grains
and adjacent to the cell wall, resulting in blue/grey to black patches of the flesh. Quick
testing for black-spot susceptibility (colour development of blended tuber tissue) allows
measurement of discolouration potential, but this tends to overestimate black-spot sus-
ceptibility. The blending will disrupt different cellular compartments, bringing enzyme
(PPO) and substrate (tyrosine and cysteine) together. More realistic, but time consuming,
tests use a device to reproducibly generate a certain impact level and quantify black-spot
development. Tuber impact sensitivity determines whether a given impact will cause a
bruise and has two components: bruise threshold and bruise resistance. Bruise threshold
is the impact at which a tuber will just begin to bruise. Bruise resistance is the ratio of
bruising energy to the resulting bruise volume (Baritelle and Hyde, 2003). In contrast to
enzymatic discolouration, black-spot bruising is strongly correlated with specific gravity
of the tuber, where higher specific gravity tubers are more sensitive to impact. Tuber
specific gravity depends on cultivar, quality of the growing conditions and dehydration.
Baritelle and Hyde (2003) show that Russet Burbank and Atlantic have lower bruise
resistance and lower bruise thresholds with increasing specific gravity. Snowden, how-
ever, showed higher bruise threshold but lower bruise resistance with increasing specific

108

van Eck

gravity. These results demonstrate that variation in resistance to damage adds to the com-
plexity of black-spot bruising. The interpretation of QTL studies on black-spot bruising
should take all these factors into account for correct interpretation of the inheritance
of this trait. Understanding the inheritance of PPO enzyme activity and substrate level
remains the simplest way to obtain cultivars with reduced susceptibility to black-spot
bruising.

6.5.2.3 Discolouration due to the Maillard reaction

As a result of the reaction between reducing sugars and free amino acids at high temper-
atures, a brown discolouration is formed, also known as the Maillard reaction. Excessive
discolouration and the development of off-flavours severely reduce the quality of French
fries and crisps. The main determinant is the concentration of reducing sugars, resulting
from the level of starch mobilization, which depends on genotype and storage conditions.
A lower storage temperature (cid:2)4
C(cid:3) especially results in an accumulation of reducing
sugars. At more ambient temperatures, tubers can be reconditioned. This is the lowering
of the concentration of reducing sugars via increasing the metabolic activity.

(cid:3)

The trait is often analysed at three moments in time and hence indicated by different
names: (1) processing quality before storage, (2) processing quality after storage at low
temperatures [also called cold-sweetening, sugar stability or (cold) chipping quality] and
(3) processing quality after reconditioning. These three traits are poorly correlated. That
so-called ‘cold chippers’ can be processed immediately from cold storage suggests the
high heritability of sugar stability. However, the ability of cultivars to recover after
reconditioning is highly heritable.

The regulation of reducing sugar concentrations in tuber tissue is described in other
chapters in this book, describing carbohydrate metabolism, and will not be copied here.
From this chapter, a number of enzymes can be proposed as candidate genes for processing
quality. The most important enzymes involved in cold-sweetening and/or reconditioning
are (1) amylases, because sucrose is the first sugar to accumulate (Sowokinos, 1990), (2)
PGM, (3) UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase; Sowokinos, 2001), (4) glucose-6-
P/Pi translocator (GPT), (5) sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), (6) invertases (Li et al.,
2005a), (7) ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) and (8) sucrose synthase (SuSy).
These and many more candidate genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism have been
mapped (Chen et al., 2001) and compared with the position of QTL involved in cold-
sweetening (Menéndez et al., 2002). With a few markers the first six QTL were detected
(Douches and Freyre, 1994), suggesting that many loci are involved in cold-sweetening.
This is confirmed by Menéndez et al. (2002), who mapped QTL for glucose, fructose
and sucrose content on all potato chromosomes. Candidate genes that collocated with
QTL (some explained more than 10% of the phenotypic variance or were consistent
across environments) encoded invertase, SuSy3, SPS, AGPase, sucrose transporter 1 and
a putative sucrose sensor.

Two candidate genes received more attention. First, Sowokinos (2001) confirmed the
correlation between UGPase and cold-sweetening. Possibly, this locus is similar to Sug11a
(Menéndez et al., 2002), but this QTL on chromosome XI is even more closely linked
to Sut1, a sugar transporter (Menéndez et al., 2002). Secondly, the role of the apoplastic

Genetics of morphological and tuber traits

109

invertase locus invGE/GF on chromosome IX has been confirmed by Li et al. (2005a).
This locus consisting of duplicated invertase genes is collocated with cold-sweetening
QTL Sug9.

Linkage disequilibrium studies may further confirm the importance of these two can-

didate genes and their utility in marker-assisted breeding.

6.5.2.4 Chlorophyll discolouration

Exposure of tubers to light initiates another form of discolouration, also named ‘tuber-
greening’. Greening is caused by the development of chlorophyll pigments in chloroplasts.
The conversion of amyloplasts into chloroplasts begins after one-day exposure to illumina-
tion (Muraja-Fras et al., 1994). Tuber-greening has a negative influence on visual quality
but not on food safety. Food safety is only at risk because of light-induced increase of
glycoalkaloids. Several studies examined the supposed correlation between light-induced
chlorophyll and glycoalkaloid accumulation (Dale et al., 1993), but the papers by Edwards
and co-workers (1997, 1999) demonstrate that greening and light-enhanced glycoalkaloid
accumulation are unrelated processes and, hence, separate breeding goals.

Varietal differences have been observed in the time lag before greening appeared and
the amount of light necessary for greening (Brown and Riley, 1976). Greening reactions
of 144 potato varieties (16 russet, 29 red and 99 white) were evaluated by Reeves (1988),
who concluded that discolouration could be subdivided into three independent components
of greening (external colour, internal colour and depth of colour). Significant differences
in greening susceptibility between potato cultivars were also observed by Dale et al.
(1993). At this moment, little is known on the inheritance of this trait, but the observation
of varietal differences with reasonably high heritability suggests that selection for low
greening susceptibility is feasible.

6.5.3 Texture

Texture of cooked potatoes is a character that must have a high heritability, because culti-
var name alone is often sufficient to know cooking type. Cooking type is often indicated
in classes A (solid) to D (mealy), but texture can be described with many more charac-
teristics, such as mealy/non-mealy, firmness/breaking of cooked tissue, crumbly/smooth
and brittle/stickiness, which could be discriminated (Van Marle, 1997). A major issue is
to translate these sensory descriptors in tuber tissue composition and the effect of cooking
on tuber tissue, as a first step, to unravel the genes that are associated with texture.

The composition of the cell wall and middle lamellae, as well as the gelatinization
characteristics of starch, has been studied in relation to texture. A mealy cultivar such
as Irene will release more pectic materials. The pectic polysaccharides contain more
and/or longer side chains for cultivar Irene than for the non-mealy cultivar Nicola, which
had more branched and a higher amount of branched pectic polysaccharides (Van Marle
et al., 1997).

Texture is probably under polygenic control and should be studied via QTL mapping
or association studies. So far, a first genetic locus involved in cooking type was identified
with QTL analysis, where a significant QTL mapped to the distal part of the long

110

van Eck

arm of chromosome IX. This locus co-localized with an eQTL [quantitative variation
in gene expression determined with quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain
reaction (RT–PCR)] of a candidate gene StTLRP. This tyrosine- and lysine-rich protein
was identified on a cDNA microarray of potato, hybridized with mRNA from bulked
segregants that differed in cooking type (Kloosterman, 2006).

6.5.4 Glycoalkaloids

Potato breeders have to select genotypes with low glycoalkaloid contents in view of their
potential toxicity. Glycoalkaloids have two basic constituents – a glycosidic grouping
and a steroid alkaloid skeleton, such as solanidine and solasodine (also referred to as the
aglycone constituent). Total glycoalkaloid content (TGA) in tubers for consumption may
−1 fresh weight (FW). Toxicity, however, is
not exceed food safety values of 200 mg kg
highly variable among individual glycoalkaloids, and furthermore, specific combinations
of glycoalkaloids may have a synergistic effect on toxicity (Rayburn, 1995). Korpan et al.
(2004) recently published a critical review on toxicity issues and the TGA threshold. The
TGA threshold is easily surpassed when tubers are exposed to light, although genotype
specific differences were observed (De Maine et al., 1988; Dale et al., 1993). Percival
(1999) showed that cultivar Maris Piper was light-insensitive, which represents a valuable
observation to stimulate further breeding and research efforts. Another light-induced
character, tuber-greening cannot be used as an indicator of light-induced elevation of
TGA level, because these were shown to be unrelated processes (Edwards and Cobb,
1997; Edwards et al., 1999).

Breeding for pathogen resistance often employs wild Solanum species, which may
−1 FW (Van Gelder et al., 1988). Fur-
accumulate glycoalkaloids exceeding 2200 mg kg
thermore, these wild species often produce glycoalkaloids that are different from those
found in cultivated potato. This has severe implications for potato breeding, where care
should be taken to avoid unacceptably high TGA levels and unintended introgression
of such a character in elite germplasm. Not only in wild species but also in cultivated
potato, the genotype is the most important factor determining glycoalkaloid content, next
to environmental effects such as temperature, light and damage. Further details are found
in reviews by Valkonen et al. (1996) and Friedman and McDonald (1997).

Both forward and reverse genetic approaches have been used to study the genetic con-
trol of glycoalkaloid content. The forward genetic studies resulted in QTL (see below),
which have not been compared with the loci of genes used in reverse genetic studies.
Candidate genes implied to control TGA could be derived from the sterol pathway result-
ing in a reduction of the aglycone content of genes involved in the glucosylation step. An
example of the latter is offered by studies on solanidine–UDP-glucose glucosyltransferase
(GST; Moehs et al., 1997). Using this GST sequence in an antisense construct, it was pos-
sible to reduce the glycoalkaloid contents of potato tubers (McCue et al., 2003). The study
by Arnqvist et al. (2003) is an example that aims to interfere with the formation of sterols.
Transgenic potato plants overexpressing a sterol methyltransferase were used to study
sterol biosynthesis. A decreased glycoalkaloid level could be obtained and cholesterol
was implied as a precursor in glycoalkaloid biosynthesis (Arnqvist et al., 2003).

Genetics of morphological and tuber traits

111

Mutation breeding, which should be included among the reverse genetic approaches,
has been examined for reducing the glycoalkaloid level (Love et al., 1996). Indeed,
mutants with reduced levels of glycoalkaloids were obtained, but screening for a pheno-
type remains the rate-limiting step in mutagenesis experiments. With the recent expansion
of sequence information on candidate genes, alternative screening methods for locus-
to-phenotype reverse genetic strategies have been proposed. Tagging of mutant alleles
with the TILLING approach (McCallum et al., 2000) could be exploited to select low
glycoalkaloid mutants.

The first forward genetic studies using molecular markers resulted in QTL on many
chromosomes, indicating a polygenic inheritance. Yencho et al. (1998) analysed the
segregation of the glycoalkaloids solanine, chaconine, solasodine and solamargine to
identify QTL for the production of the aglycones solanidine and solasodine. Several QTL
for the accumulation of solasodine and solanidine were identified on chromosomes 4,
6 and 12 for the BCB mapping population and on chromosomes 4, 8 and 11 for the
BCT population. Two QTL for solanidine were identified in BCT on chromosomes 1
and 4, where the QTL located on chromosome 1 in the TG70–TG71 interval was most
significant. The locus explained 17–22% of the phenotypic variation and was also detected
in BCB (Yencho et al., 1998). The importance of the short arm of chromosome 1 has been
confirmed by Ronning et al. (1999) and by Hutvagner et al. (2001), who both mapped a
QTL involved in the production of several glycoalkaloids from S. chacoense. The work
by Ronning et al. (1999) focussed on the development of Colorado potato beetle-resistant
potato varieties via enhanced glycoalkaloid content. This is only feasible if leaf and tuber
glycoalkaloid are under independent genetic control.

6.5.5 Growing defects (hollow hearts, growth cracks, second growth, internal

heat necrosis)

No recent work has shed new light on the genetic control of susceptibility for growing
defects such as hollow hearts and growth cracks. A publication by Claassens and Vreug-
denhil (2000) concludes that dormancy breaking and tuber formation are highly related,
although complementary processes. Second growth, resulting in glassy-end tubers, is also
related to these complementary processes, but apart from these physiological consider-
ations, there are no novel insights into the inheritance of second growth susceptibility.
Susceptibility to internal heat necrosis (IHN), resulting in necrotic tissue in the pith of the
tubers, was recently studied by Sterrett et al. (2003, 2006). They analysed interspecific
4x–2x S. tuberosum × S. phureja–S. stenotomum hybrids with significantly different IHN
resistance and suggested that broadening the genetic basis of cultivated potato could offer
some room for breeding for IHN resistance.

6.5.6 Tuber size uniformity

Uniformity of tuber size is of great economic importance, because it directly affects the
marketable yield, as well as costs involved in size grading. Most studies focus on the
processes of stolon initiation, elongation, swelling, tuber growth and resorption within
a given genotype, across a wide range of environmental factors (reviewed by Ewing

112

van Eck

and Struik, 1992). Genetic variation in size distribution across a wide range of diploid
genotypes was studied by Celis Gamboa et al. (2003). Their results suggest that the final
marketable yield and size distribution of potato tubers are defined by the degree of stolon
branching, the duration of the stolon tip swelling period, the ability of the small growing
tubers to reach a marketable size and tuber resorption. Therefore, understanding of the
inheritance of tuber size uniformity might not be feasible without first understanding the
inheritance of all underlying factors, which are known to be highly genotype-dependent.

Potato is a host to many pathogens that affect all parts of the plant and cause reductions in
the quantity and quality of yield. The development of new cultivars that are more resistant
to economically important pests and diseases is therefore one of the top priorities for
potato-breeding programs worldwide. Numerous resistance genes have been discovered
in Solanum species and introgressed into the cultivated potato. Since the 1980s, the
introduction of molecular marker techniques has facilitated gene mapping and shifted
orientation from phenotype-based resistance genetics to genotype-based approaches. A
number of loci conferring quantitative resistance [quantitative resistance loci (QRL)]
and around forty single dominant genes (R-genes) conferring qualitative resistance have
been positioned on the potato molecular map. As of 2006, eight of the mapped R-genes
have been isolated and molecularly characterized. The analysis of mapped and cloned
resistance genes shows that they often occur in clusters and that some of them can respond
to more than one elicitor. Ongoing research on resistance gene evolution will help us in
understanding the dynamic interaction between potato plants and pathogens and opens a
way for the development of more resistant cultivars.

7.1 RESISTANCE SCREENING

To carry out breeding and genetic studies, one must correctly identify genotypes based on
phenotypes. This may sound like a trivial matter. However, especially in disease and pest
assays, the concept of resistance is necessarily linked to the screening method. Screening
data must be used to assign resistance phenotypes, and rankings of clones may vary with
the screening method. There is often no black and white difference between resistant
and susceptible phenotypes, so judgments must be made to assign phenotypes and,
consequently, genotypes. Finally, most host–pathogen interactions are strongly influenced
by the environment, so it is important to ultimately evaluate plants under the range of
field conditions in which the crop will be grown.

7.1.1 Field screening

Field assessments of resistance are especially valuable because they evaluate plants under
the conditions in which they will eventually be grown. However, field screening can be

Simko et al.

expensive in terms of both time and resources, and screening results may be variable
because of environmental heterogeneity.

Disease pressure is an important variable in field trials, but it can be difficult to control
for two reasons. First, the amount of inoculum that is naturally present in the field cannot
be easily manipulated in most cases. Second, disease pressure is typically influenced by
environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, which cannot be controlled. If
disease pressure is too high, then clones with moderate, but possibly acceptable, levels
of resistance will be eliminated. Stewart et al. (1983) found that if young seedlings
were inoculated with Phytophthora infestans (the causal agent of late-blight disease),
then even resistant plants died. Inoculations of older seedlings allowed for the successful
identification of resistant plants. Similarly, Hilton et al. (2000) found that if tubers were
exposed to Helminthosporium solani for too long under ideal conditions for the silver
scurf fungus, then no differences were seen between resistant and susceptible cultivars.
On the contrary, if disease pressure is too low, then selection for resistance will also be
ineffective. For example, Hoyos et al. (1993) assayed vascular colonization by Verticillium
dahliae in seedling transplants and identified putatively resistant clones. However, few
of the putatively resistant clones selected as seedlings were resistant in the first clonal
generation, probably because selection pressure was too low in the seedling generation.
Because breeders typically evaluate large populations of segregating plants, they must
strive toward a balance between quantity and quality of disease-scoring data. On one
hand, it is important to be able to quickly evaluate large numbers of clones in segregating
populations. On the other hand, the data are meaningless if they do not effectively identify
resistant phenotypes. It is important to identify screening methods that will consistently
identify resistant plants in breeding programs with large numbers of genotypes. For
example, a common Verticillium wilt-resistance-scoring technique involves the plating
of stem tissue from infected plants, followed by the counting of Verticillium colonies
that grew from that tissue. Because stem-to-stem variation for pathogen populations is
very high, it is important to evaluate a large number of stems, which is time-consuming.
A compromise offered by Treadwell (1991) substituted a rating scale for colony counts,
allowing a larger number of stems to be evaluated. Similarly, Christ (1991) found that
estimating leaf area covered by early-blight (Alternaria solani) lesions was faster than
counting individual lesions.

Resistance assays can be based on disease symptoms or pathogen levels in the plant.
Disease symptom expression is typically an easy, fast, and inexpensive assay. For example,
Dale and Brown (1989) determined that foliage symptom expression correlated with yield
loss due to potato cyst nematode (Globodera pallida) infection. Consequently, selection for
foliage vigor allows for the identification of tolerant genotypes. Christ (1991) also effectively
identified early-blight-resistant clones based on symptom development in the field.

Although symptom expression is commonly used for disease scoring, there are prob-
lems associated with this technique. It may be difficult to distinguish between symptoms
caused by the pathogen of interest and those caused by other pathogens or by abi-
otic stresses. In addition, the interaction between the pathogen and both its biotic and
abiotic environment may result in a wide range of symptoms, some of which are not
typical. Consequently, methods have been developed to quantify pathogen populations in
plant tissues. These methods are discussed in Section 7.1.3.

Genetics of resistance

119

It is often desirable to partition resistance into components, each of which can be
selected individually and may be controlled by its own genetic system. For example,
resistance to potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) can result from resistance to infection, resistance
to virus accumulation, and reduced translocation from leaves to tubers (Wilson and Jones,
1993). Each of these components appears to be controlled by a different genetic system.
It is possible to select plants for each of these components, and combining the components
may provide even more effective resistance (Solomon-Blackburn et al., 1994). Late-blight
resistance can also be partitioned into components such as infection efficiency, latent
period, lesion size, and sporulation. However, unlike PLRV resistance components, which
are controlled by major genes, these components of late-blight resistance appear to be
quantitatively inherited and they interact with each other to determine the resistance
phenotype (Birhman and Singh, 1995). The heritability estimates for each component vary,
as does the contribution of each to the resistance genotype. Similarly, scab (Streptomyces
scabies) resistance can be partitioned into surface area infected, lesion type, and proportion
of scabby tubers (Goth et al., 1993). Cluster analysis based on lesion type and surface
area infected appears to most effectively identify resistant clones.

Host plant maturity is an important variable in most disease and pest resistance eval-
uations. Typically, plants are more resistant early in their life cycle, becoming more
susceptible with age. Immature plant resistance is commonly observed for late blight
(Dorrance and Inglis, 1997), early blight (Boiteux et al., 1995), and Verticillium wilt
(Busch and Edgington, 1967). Consequently, it is important to evaluate disease resistance
as plants senesce in the field. This can be a problem when scoring wild Solanum species,
which typically do not senesce during the growing season in North temperate regions.
In contrast to immature plant resistance, resistance to PLRV appears to increase in mature
plants (DiFonzo et al., 1994).

7.1.2 Greenhouse screening

Greenhouse-based resistance assays can provide an attractive compromise between costly,
time-consuming field trials and laboratory assays, which do not typically evaluate entire
plants. They can identify putatively resistant plants that can then undergo more extensive
field evaluations in subsequent studies.

A major advantage of greenhouse screening is that the environment can be controlled
to optimize disease pressure while minimizing the effects of confounding biotic and
abiotic factors. Greenhouse assays allow control over the timing, dose, and virulence
of the pathogen. Stewart and Bradshaw (1993) optimized the greenhouse environment
for early-blight resistance screening by controlling humidity, inoculum dose, and plant
age at inoculation. Most plants identified as resistant or susceptible remained so in field
tests. Similarly, Dorrance and Inglis (1997) found that resistance scores from greenhouse
inoculations with P. infestans corresponded to those from field evaluations.

Another advantage of greenhouse screening is that it allows for the evaluation of
resistance to pathogens that cannot feasibly be introduced to the outside environment.
For example, greenhouse assays were used to evaluate resistance to ring rot (Clavibacter
michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus) because field trials would release a serious pathogen to
the environment (Kriel et al., 1995b). Similarly, in regions where breeders cannot risk

120

Simko et al.

spreading P. infestans to growers’ fields, they use greenhouse evaluations to screen for
late-blight resistance.

Greenhouse screening in potato also allows plants to be grown under short day condi-
tions in winter in order to induce tuberization in wild Solanum species. Breeders can then
evaluate tuber traits, which cannot be studied in the field because wild species do not
tuberize under the long days of summer in North temperate regions. Hosaka et al. (2000)
transplanted wild species seedlings into pots containing S. scabies. As the plants tuber-
ized in the greenhouse during the winter, they were evaluated for resistance to common
scab. Because short day conditions stimulate wild species to senesce, winter greenhouse
trials also allow screening for true resistance rather than immature plant resistance, as in
Section 7.1.1.

One limitation of greenhouse screening is that the controlled environment may not
adequately mimic the complexities of a field trial. Consequently, levels of resistance
may not correlate strongly with those in the greenhouse. For example, DiFonzo et al.
(1994) reported that the variety ‘Cascade’ was more resistant to PLRV in the field than
in the greenhouse. Apparently, resistance was more complex than the greenhouse screen
alone could assess. Similarly, ‘Desirée’ was more resistant to early blight in field than
greenhouse assays (Stewart and Bradshaw, 1993).

7.1.3 Laboratory screening

Laboratory-based assays are based on samples ranging from whole plants to individual
cells. A number of biochemical assays have been developed to quantify pathogen levels in
host plant tissue. A main advantage of these assays is that they can confirm the presence
of the pathogen in both symptomatic (susceptible) and asymptomatic (tolerant) plants.
Consequently, they can distinguish between tolerant and resistant plants.

Pathogen populations in inoculated host plant tissues can be quantified in a number of
ways. For example, fungal pathogens can be quantified using culture plating, an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Culture-
plating assays are commonly used for Verticillium wilt resistance screening. Hoyos et al.
(1991) plated sap, whereas Davis et al. (1983) plated dried stem tissue from plants grown
in V. dahliae-infested fields. Both reported a strong correlation between the numbers of
colony-forming units and wilt scores in the field. Davis et al. (2001) suggest that the
plating of roots on V. dahliae on selective medium provides an even more effective
measure of colonization by the pathogen. Culture plating is simple and inexpensive, but
it can be time-consuming and does not provide information until the pathogen grows,
which may take weeks. In addition, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the
pathogen and other organisms that grow on the plate. ELISA provides rapid results and
does not require specialized equipment other than a plate reader. It has been used to assay
for resistance to late blight (Harrison et al., 1991; Beckman et al., 1994), Verticillium wilt
(Plasencia et al., 1996), and potato viruses (Valkonen et al., 1992a; Singh et al., 2000).
PCR is now commonly used to quantify pathogen levels in disease resistance assays. The
limit of detection of this technique is typically lower than that of ELISA tests or culture
plating. Quantitative PCR has been used to distinguish between Verticillium wilt-resistant
and Verticillium wilt-tolerant clones (Dan et al., 2001). In addition, PCR detection can

Genetics of resistance

be species specific. For example, PCR can specifically detect V. dahliae, whereas ELISA
tests detect both pathogenic forms of Verticillium (Verticillium albo-atrum and V. dahliae)
(Plasencia et al., 1996; Dan et al., 2001). However, a limitation of both PCR and ELISA
methods is that they cannot distinguish between living and dead pathogens, whereas
culture plating detects only living material. Moreover, the pathogen population levels do
not always mirror disease symptoms. Jansky and Rouse (2000) noted that Verticillium
wilt symptoms did not correlate with levels of stem colonization. Similarly, Harrison
et al. (1991) noted that levels of P. infestans in leaf tissue based on ELISA assays did
not always relate to visual estimates of disease.

As an alternative to pathogen exposure in the field, plants or plant parts may be inoc-
ulated in the laboratory. Laboratory inoculations have been used effectively in resistance
screening for silver scurf (Rodriguez et al., 1995; Hilton et al., 2000), soft rot (Erwinia
carotovora) (Łojkowska and Kelman, 1994), powdery scab (Spongospora subterranea)
(Merz et al., 2004), early blight (Bussey and Stevenson, 1991), and late blight (Dorrance
and Inglis, 1998). However, the latter study illustrates a limitation of laboratory-based
assays – they cannot simulate a field environment. Tubers of some cultivars that were
susceptible in the laboratory assay were resistant in the field, probably because placement
of tubers in the hill allowed them to escape infection in the field.

In some cases, it may be possible to screen for resistance using toxins produced by
the pathogen rather than the pathogen itself. Christinzio and Testa (1999) screened potato
leaves for late-blight resistance by applying fungal culture filtrates and then measuring
electrolyte leakage. Similarly, Lawrence et al. (1990) were able to induce scab lesions
by inoculating minitubers with thaxtomin, the toxin produced by S. scabies. Lynch
et al. (1991) found that in vitro assays for early-blight resistance using culture filtrates
containing toxic metabolites produced results similar to those using fungal spores.

7.2 RESISTANCE GENETICS IN POTATO

Wild and cultivated relatives of potato are credited with contributing the majority of dis-
ease resistance genes to breeding programs. It is interesting that most emphasis has been
placed on a few species, such as late-blight resistance genes from Solanum demissum
and virus resistance genes from Solanum stoloniferum. Only 13 wild species have con-
tributed germplasm to European cultivars (Hawkes, 1990). Consequently, wild Solanum
germplasm represents a largely untapped reservoir of genetic diversity for disease resis-
tance genes. Ruiz de Galarreta et al. (1998) found that over 70% of the 98 wild Solanum
species accessions they screened expressed resistance to one or more diseases. Much work
remains to be done to identify and characterize the resistance factors in these species.

diseases and pests. Resistance to ring rot, potato cyst nematode, root knot nematode
(Meloidogyne chitwoodi), potato virus X (PVX), and potato virus Y (PVY) has been
reported in Solanum acaule; resistance to Colorado potato beetle (CPB) (Leptinotarsa
decemlineata), green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), potato tuberworm (Phthorimaea
operculella), late blight, and Verticillium wilt has been reported in Solanum berthaultii;
resistance to silver scurf, CPB, four species of root knot nematode, late blight, PLRV,
PVY, thrips (Thrips palmi), and both Verticillium wilt species has been reported in
Solanum chacoense; resistance to root knot nematode, late blight, PVX, tobacco etch
virus, and Verticillium wilt has been reported in Solanum commersonii; resistance to
potato cyst nematode, late blight, PLRV, Verticillium wilt, and potato viruses M, X, and
Y has been reported in Solanum sparsipilum; resistance to soft rot, silver scurf, late blight,
cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), henbane mosaic virus, and PVY has been reported in
S. stoloniferum; and resistance to soft rot, CPB, root knot nematode, and Verticillium
wilt has been reported in Solanum tarijense. The outgroup Solanum palustre seems to be
an especially rich source of virus resistance genes. It is important to note that there is
tremendous diversity within wild species and even within accessions, so fine screening is
necessary to identify individual clones with resistance genes. From a breeding standpoint,
it is encouraging to note that several of the wild species that are rich in disease resistance
genes (e.g. S. berthaultii, S. chacoense, S. sparsipilum, and S. tarijense) are also easily
accessible through the simple ploidy manipulations outlined below.

7.2.1.2 Sexual hybridization

Resistance genes are often derived from wild Solanum relatives, most of which are
diploid. Consequently, the ploidy of selected wild species clones can be doubled somat-
ically or through sexual polyploidization to make them crossable with cultivars. Alter-
natively, diploid species clones can be crossed to parthenogenetically derived haploids
(cid:2)2n = 2x = 24(cid:3) of cultivars, followed by polyploidization. The track record for transfer-
ring disease resistance to tetraploids through sexual polyploidization is impressive. It has
successfully created hybrids with resistance to bacterial wilt (Pseudomonas solanacearum)
(Watanabe et al., 1992), early blight (Herriott et al., 1990), common scab (Murphy et al.,
1995), potato cyst nematode (De Maine et al., 1986; Ortiz et al., 1997), Verticillium wilt
(K.E. Frost and S.H. Jansky, unpublished), and soft rot (Carputo et al., 2000; Capo et al.,
2002). Iwanaga et al. (1989) crossed root knot nematode-resistant diploids to ‘Atzimba’
(4x) and to a haploid (2x) of ‘Atzimba’, both of which are susceptible to the nematode. A
significantly higher proportion of resistant offspring (25%) was obtained in the 4x× 2x
crosses than in the 2x× 2x crosses (11%). Presumably, alleles at loci between the cen-
tromere and the first crossover on each chromosome were transferred to offspring intact
in 2n gametes, whereas those alleles were randomly reassorted in n gametes. This may
explain why 2n gametes transmitted resistance to bacterial wilt, root knot nematodes,
late blight, and glandular trichomes to a high proportion of 4x× 2x offspring (Watanabe
et al., 1999).

Diploid, 1 endosperm balance number (1EBN) species are often good sources of disease
resistance genes. Several strategies have been developed to tap into this germplasm
resource. Carputo et al. (1997) doubled the chromosome number of S. commersonii and

126

Simko et al.

crossed the resulting 4x, 2EBN clone with a 2x, 2EBN Tuberosum Group–Phureja Group
hybrid, which was introgressed into tetraploid clones, some of which exhibited resistance
to bacterial soft rot (Carputo et al., 2002; Iovene et al., 2004). Ramon and Hanneman
(2002) used embryo rescue to incorporate late-blight resistance from the 2x, 1EBN species
Solanum pinnatisectum into Solanum tuberosum.

Extremely wide hybridizations may introduce novel resistance genes into the potato
gene pool. Colon et al. (1993) used embryo rescue to introduce late-blight resistance
genes into the potato from the Solanaceous weed species Solanum nigrum and Solanum
villosum. Valkonen et al. (1995) used embryo rescue to transfer the extreme resistance
to PVY found in the non-tuber-bearing 2x, 1EBN species Solanum brevidens to the
cultivated potato. Chavez et al. (1988) used bridging crosses, ploidy manipulations, and
embryo rescue to transfer PLRV resistance from the non-tuber-bearing 2x, 1EBN species
Solanum etuberosum to tuber-bearing species.

Breeding strategies may be designed to incorporate multiple sources of disease resis-
tance genes. Solomon-Blackburn and Barker (1993) created clones with strong PLRV
resistance by combining genes that limit virus multiplication with those for resistance to
infection. Spitters and Ward (1988) found that resistance to potato cyst nematodes was
more durable in clones with two resistance genes instead of one. Colon et al. (1995a) com-
bined minor genes for late-blight resistance from four wild Solanum species with diploid
Tuberosum Group clones. Murphy et al. (1999) used conventional hybridization between
two tetraploid breeding clones, each with different disease resistance traits, to create a
clone with resistance to several diseases. Hybrids containing a large proportion of wild
germplasm may express multiple resistances because wild Solanum relatives are rich in
disease resistance genes. Jansky and Rouse (2003) identified resistance to several diseases
in populations of diploid interspecific hybrids. Chen et al. (2003) identified wild species
genotypes with multiple resistances to late blight, CPB, and blackleg (E. carotovora).
Similarly, De Maine et al. (1993) argue that Phureja Group is a valuable source of mul-
tiple disease resistance genes. The authors noted that resistance levels decrease as the
exotic germplasm is diluted following recurrent backcrosses to S. tuberosum.

7.2.1.3 Somatic hybridization

High levels of disease resistance are sometimes found in wild Solanum species that are
sexually incompatible (or nearly so) with the cultivated potato. Somatic fusion offers an
effective strategy to access this germplasm. The 2x non-tuber-bearing species (Solanum
fernandezianum, S. brevidens, and S. etuberosum) seem to be especially rich in dis-
ease resistance genes. For example, somatic hybrids between cultivated potatoes and
S. brevidens express resistance to PLRV (Austin et al., 1985), PVX, PVY, and PLRV
(Gibson et al., 1988; Valkonen and Rokka, 1998), and soft rot (Austin et al., 1988;
Zimnoch-Guzowska and Łojkowska, 1993; Allefs et al., 1995; McGrath et al., 2002).
Somatic fusion hybrids containing the 2x, 1EBN species S. commersonii are resistant to
bacterial wilt (Leferriere et al., 1999; Kim-Lee et al., 2005), soft rot (Carputo et al., 1997),
and Verticillium wilt (Bastia et al., 2000), whereas those with Solanum bulbocastanum
are resistant to late blight (Helgeson et al., 1998; Song et al., 2003).

Somatic hybrids involving non-tuber-bearing species generally tuberize poorly, and as
backcrosses are made to Tuberosum Group to improve tuberization, levels of resistance

Genetics of resistance

127

may decrease (Austin et al., 1988; Allefs et al., 1995). Rokka et al. (1995) suggest that
repeated cycles of somatic fusion and anther culture may provide an effective strategy to
improve tuberization while retaining virus resistance. In other cases, though, resistance
genes are retained and expressed following multiple backcrosses to Tuberosum Group
(Novy et al., 2002; Tek et al., 2004).

Another application of somatic fusion is to combine resistance genes from two sexually
compatible parents. Thach et al. (1993) fused diploids carrying major genes for resistance
to PVX (Rx) or PVY (Ry). When Rx-carrying clones were fused with Ry-carrying clones,
most of the hybrids were resistant to both PVX and PVY. Rasmussen et al. (1996) fused
a Tuberosum Group haploid carrying the gene for resistance to potato cyst nematode
pathotype Pa2 with another haploid carrying the Pa3 resistance gene. Some of the
hybrids exhibited a high level of resistance to both pathotypes of the nematode. Valkonen
and Rokka (1998) fused a S. brevidens clone with a Tuberosum Group clone, both of
which are resistant to PVA, PVX, PVY, and CMV, but through different mechanisms.
Surprisingly, the simultaneous expression of two resistance mechanisms in the hybrids
resulted in variable responses to the pathogens but not typically complementation for
resistance. Carrasco et al. (2000) fused Solanum verrucosum with Tuberosum Group
to combine PLRV resistance from S. verrucosum with adaptation and tuber yield from
Tuberosum Group.

It is interesting to note that a dilution effect is sometimes reported for resistance traits
in somatic fusion hybrids. Cooper-Bland et al. (1994) fused a potato cyst nematode-
susceptible Tuberosum Group haploid with a resistant one and produced hybrids that
were more similar to the susceptible parent. Somatic hybrids created by Rasmussen et al.
(1998) had lower levels of quantitative resistance to both tuber and foliar late blight than
the resistant donors. Similarly, soft rot resistance was reduced in backcross generations
compared with S. brevidens + Tuberosum Group fusions (McGrath et al., 2002) and
S. commersonii + Tuberosum Group fusions (Carputo et al., 2002). Gavrilenko et al.
(2003) reported that 6x somatic fusion hybrids with four doses of the resistant parent
(S. etuberosum) genome expressed extreme resistance to PVY, whereas 6x hybrids with
four doses of the susceptible parent (Tuberosum Group) genome were susceptible. On the
contrary, Zimnoch-Guzowska et al. (2003) reported that somatic hybrids produced from
fusions of Tuberosum Group with the wild species S. nigrum were often more resistant
than the resistant wild parent, perhaps due to complementation of resistance genes.

7.2.2 Resistance genetics based on disease phenotype

7.2.2.1 Vertical resistance

Disease resistance genetic studies are often based on tetraploid families. However, even
major genes are difficult to identify at the tetraploid level due to the complexities of tetra-
somic segregation. For example, Brown et al. (1997) intercrossed tetraploid Tuberosum
Group clones and obtained high heritability estimates for PLRV resistance. The authors
suggest that a few major genes are mainly responsible for resistance, but individual genes
and their effects could not be elucidated. Based on crosses among tetraploid Tuberosum
Group clones, Barker et al. (1994) proposed a two-gene model for PLRV resistance.

128

Simko et al.

Barker and Solomon (1990) observed an approximately 1:1 segregation ratio in a cross
between a susceptible tetraploid clone and a clone with resistance to PLRV multiplication.
They suggest that a single dominant gene may confer resistance, but it was not possible
to determine the genotypes of the parents. In contrast, when Brown and Thomas (1994)
carried out inheritance studies at the diploid level, with the wild species S. chacoense,
a single dominant resistance gene was identified and parental genotypes were determined
based on offspring ratios.

Major genes for resistance to other potato viruses have also been identified. Solomon-
Blackburn and Barker (2001) listed 28 major genes/alleles responsible for virus resistance
in potato. Most originate from wild Solanum species, although Tuberosum and Stenoto-
mum Groups have also contributed resistance genes. Some virus resistance genes may
be found in closely linked clusters or they may be single genes that confer broad-
spectrum resistance. For example, Barker (1997) suggested that a single dominant gene
confers resistance to PVA, PVX, and PVY.

Dominant R-genes1 for late-blight resistance have been used by breeders for decades.
Eleven R-gene alleles have been identified in the Mexican wild species S. demissum
(Black et al., 1953). An additional resistance gene, Rpi1, has been identified in the
Mexican wild species S. pinnatisectum (Kuhl et al., 2001). Characterization of this gene
indicates that it might correspond to R9 from S. demissum. These resistance genes are
presumed to have evolved as a result of long-term interactions between the host wild
species and the late-blight pathogen in Mexico. It is interesting that R-genes have been
identified in Argentinian wild species even though these species have not evolved in
the presence of P. infestans (Micheletto et al., 1999). In breeding studies using clones
with major gene resistance, an excess of susceptible progeny is sometimes detected in
segregating populations. A dominant suppressor of R-genes has been proposed to explain
these data (El-Kharbotly et al., 1996b; Ordoñez et al., 1997). A long history of R-gene-
resistant cultivar releases has demonstrated that vertical resistance to late blight is not
durable because the pathogen is capable of evolving quickly to overcome R-genes.

Surprisingly, a single late-blight resistance gene derived from S. bulbocastanum, RB,
appears to differ from other R-genes by conferring durable resistance. Clones containing
the RB gene are even resistant to ‘super-races’ of the fungus that can overcome all 11
R-genes (Song et al., 2003; van der Vossen et al., 2003).

It is interesting that there are several examples of two-gene disease resistance systems
in potato. Vallejo et al. (1995) suggested that PVY resistance in a diploid Phureja–
Stenotomum Group population is controlled by complementary action of two dominant
genes. Both genes must be present to confer resistance. Similarly, Kriel et al. (1995b)

1 Classification of the genes involved in plant resistance can sometimes be confusing with different authors
using somewhat different terminology. In this chapter, the term ‘R-gene’ refers to a phenotypically defined
single gene that specifically recognizes an avirulence gene product of the pathogen. The R-gene-based type of
resistance is often described in literature as monogenic, qualitative, vertical, narrow, specific, or complete. On
the contrary, if the resistance phenotype is not controlled by individually recognizable R-genes and the resistance
is measured quantitatively rather than qualitatively, the loci associated with the resistance are referred to as
‘quantitative resistance loci’ (QRL). The QRL-based type of resistance is frequently described as polygenic,
quantitative, horizontal, broad, general, partial, or field resistance. However, the distinction between the two
types of resistance is often equivocal at the phenotypic level.

Genetics of resistance

129

found that complementary gene action is responsible for resistance to ring rot in S. acaule.
In addition, Singh et al. (2000) determined that resistance to PVA in potato cultivars
due to two independent genes with complementary gene action. Vallejo et al. (1995)
also found that two dominant genes control resistance to PVX in Phureja–Stenotomum
Group hybrids. However, this system exhibits duplicate dominant epistasis, as only one
of the two genes is necessary for resistance. Jansky et al. (2004) also reported that a
similar genetic mechanism exists for resistance to Verticillium wilt in diploid interspecific
hybrids. Conversely, Lynch et al. (1997) identified a single dominant gene resistance is
sufficient for Verticillium wilt resistance in S. chacoense. Perhaps a second resistance
gene could not be detected because it was not segregating in that population.

7.2.2.2 Horizontal resistance

There is considerable interest in the development of potato cultivars with durable late-
blight resistance due to polygenes. The so-called field resistance is complexly inherited
and may involve the production of phytoalexins, phenolics, and glycoalkaloids (Andreu
et al., 2001). Breeding progress has been slow because the genetic basis of resistance is
not yet understood. Horizontal resistance to late blight, presumably due to minor genes,
has been reported in wild Solanum species (Rivera-Peña, 1990; Colon et al., 1995b),
in cultivated relatives of potato (Cañizares and Forbes, 1995; Haynes and Christ, 1999;
Trognitz et al., 2001; Zlesak and Thill, 2004), and in Tuberosum Group cultivars (Colon
et al., 1995b; Grünwald et al., 2002; Porter et al., 2004). Late-blight resistance is present
in some heirloom cultivars and appears to be durable, because the resistance levels are
similar to those when the cultivars were released more than 40 years ago. However,
the most resistant cultivars are also late-maturing, and it is not known whether durable
resistance can be combined with early maturity.

Resistance to early blight (A. solani) appears to be quantitatively inherited. Good
sources of resistance are rare, and the combination of resistance and early maturity is
even more difficult to find (Boiteux et al., 1995). Christ and Haynes (2001) reported
a relatively high heritability estimate (0.61) for early-blight resistance in a Phureja–
Stenotomum Group population, indicating that additive genetic variance is important.
Similarly, Herriott et al. (1990) and Ortiz et al. (1993) found that additive genetic variance
is important for early-blight resistance. According to Brandolini et al. (1992) and Gopal
(1988), non-additive gene action contributes to resistance as well. In most populations
developed for early-blight resistance, the most resistant clones are late to mature. However,
Boiteaux et al. (1995) surveyed a large number of clones (934) and found some with both
early maturity and early-blight resistance.

A genetic study using diploid interspecific hybrids determined that broad- and narrow-
sense heritability values for soft rot resistance are high (0.92 and 0.89, respectively)
(Lebecka and Zimnoch-Guzowska, 2004). Consequently, additive genetic variance is
more important than non-additive variance. Although individual resistance genes were
not identified in this study, the high heritability estimates may indicate that only a few
genes control resistance.

Several studies have identified quantitative resistance for Verticillium wilt. Tsror and
Nachmias (1995) suggest that minor genes are responsible for resistance in some cultivars.

130

Simko et al.

Pavek and Corsini (1994) also favor a horizontal resistance model, with additive genetic
variance contributing significantly to resistance. Recently, Simko et al. (2004b) identified
four quantitative trait loci that contribute to Verticillium wilt resistance in diploid pop-
ulations. It is interesting to note that different types of Verticillium wilt resistance may
be controlled by different genetic systems. Lynch et al. (1997) believe that, in diploid S.
chacoense, tolerance is a polygenic trait, whereas resistance to infection and colonization
is due to a major gene.

7.3 MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF POTATO RESISTANCE

7.3.1 Experimental strategies for gene mapping and cloning

7.3.1.1 Mapping plant resistance genes

The mapping of plant resistance genes is typically carried out on segregating populations
derived from parents with contrasting phenotypes. To localize genes associated with
particular resistance on a molecular linkage map, the resistance phenotype has to be
assessed for the individuals in the mapping population. Then, linkage between marker loci
and the resistance trait is calculated. Unfortunately, the cultivated potato (S. tuberosum
ssp. tuberosum) is a highly heterozygous autotetraploid (cid:2)2n = 4x = 48(cid:3) species with
complex genetic inheritance that complicates gene mapping. To limit the complexity of
potato genetics, diploid (cid:2)2n = 2x = 24(cid:3) individuals are frequently used as parents for
molecular map construction and linkage analysis. Diploids can be derived from tetraploid
genotypes through anther or pollen culture, or through interspecific hybridization with
certain genotypes of Solanum phureja (cid:2)2n = 2x = 24(cid:3). However, the diploid potato
genotypes are self-incompatible (or are having large inbreeding depression), the feature
that precludes development of pure lines. Therefore, a number of common mapping
approaches based on homozygous lines, and often used in plant genetics, cannot be
applied in potato. On the contrary, because alleles of heterozygous parents segregate in
meiosis, already an F1-hybrid population can be used for potato gene mapping.

Typically, the initial screening is performed on a population consisting of 100–200
individuals and a series of markers ideally spaced at even intervals of about 10 cM on
each chromosome. The necessary requirement for gene detection is a phenotype that
segregates within the population and can be clearly scored in each individual. Following
detection of linkage between the resistance phenotype and a molecular marker, saturation
of the genomic region with more markers can be carried out on an expanded population
of several hundred or even thousands of individuals. The large population size allows
detection of flanking markers that are more closely linked to the resistance gene. Closely
linked markers then may be used for either marker-assisted selection (MAS) or the
map-based cloning of the resistance gene.

It should be noted, however, that populations originating from two diploid parental
genotypes sample only a small proportion of all possible alleles. Moreover, if wild
species are used for the development of mapping populations, the observed gene effects
are not often representative of those encountered in elite cultivars. Detecting variation

Genetics of resistance

131

in economically important traits within genetic backgrounds that are relevant to plant
breeders can be improved by complementary mapping techniques, such as association
mapping. The association mapping method is a linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based tech-
nique that exploits biodiversity observed in existing cultivars and breeding lines without
developing new mapping populations. This method has previously been used in diploid
species and was recently successfully applied to map resistance genes in tetraploid potato
(Gebhardt et al., 2004; Simko, 2004; Simko et al., 2004a,b). The association mapping
approach effectively incorporates the effect of many past generations of recombinants
into a single analysis. Because no mapping population needs to be created for the study,
the linkage test can be performed relatively quickly and inexpensively. The association
mapping technique that provides the means for detecting genes underlying the variation
of a trait among existing genotypes is thus complementary to linkage-mapping methods
that effectively locate genes segregating in a population originating from two individuals.
A significant difference between association mapping in a general population and genetic
linkage mapping in a defined segregating population is that association mapping gen-
erally identifies the association of common alleles (rare alleles do not reach statistical
significance), whereas a population originating from a biparental cross enables the iden-
tification of alleles rare in the population at large (Simko, 2004). The resolution of the
association-mapping approach depends on the structure of LD within the test population.
The extent of LD in potato is not yet known; however, preliminary analysis of 66 loci
indicates a relatively fast decay of LD within 1kb, but slow decay afterwards (Simko
et al., 2006b).

7.3.1.2 Map-based cloning of resistance genes

Thus far, eight potato resistance genes have been cloned, and all of them were isolated
using variants of the map-based strategy often combined with the candidate gene approach.
Therefore, we will describe briefly this cloning technique, although other approaches can
also be used for gene isolation.

After detecting molecular markers that are flanking a resistance gene locus, the screen-
ing of a large-insert genomic library (usually a bacterial artificial chromosome – BAC)
with the identified flanking markers is performed. If the flanking markers are separated
by a large distance, then the ‘chromosome walking’ method (Bender et al., 1983) is
used to identify cloned DNA between the two markers through a stepwise analysis of
successive overlapping clones. Alternatively, the ‘chromosome landing’ (Tanksley et al.,
1995) approach may be used to pinpoint a resistance gene location with more accuracy.
The idea behind the chromosome-landing method is that several thousand markers can
be screened on the population to search for markers at a genetic distance corresponding
to the physical size of large-insert clones. Identified markers are then used for screening
genomic libraries. Ideally, the markers will land directly in the clones that contain, among
other genes, the target resistance gene.

Once a large-insert clone(s) that encompasses the resistance gene is detected, the resis-
tance gene identity needs to be established. This is usually done through a combination of
sequencing, bioinformatic analyses (to reveal relevant candidates), and functional testing
of the candidate alleles in transgenic plants.

7.3.2 Resistance factors mapped in potato

Numerous genes conferring resistance to viruses, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, oomycetes,
and insects have been mapped in potato, and their location is summarized in Tables 7.2
and 7.3.

Two common types of single gene resistance to viruses in potato are hypersensitive
resistance and extreme resistance. The genes for hypersensitive resistance are often virus
strain group specific. When plants carrying these genes are inoculated with viruses, they
usually develop either local necrotic lesions in the infected tissue or systemic necrosis.
Several genes coding hypersensitive resistance to potato viruses A, S, X, and Y have been
mapped in potato. On the contrary, very limited (or no) necrosis is observed on plants
having genes for extreme resistance. The extreme resistance genes confer comprehensive
resistance to several virus strains, and only an extremely low level of virus can be
detected in some of the inoculated plants. Genes for extreme resistance to PVX and PVY
originating from at least four different potato species have been placed on the potato
molecular map. QRL for resistance to PLRV have also been reported in some mapping
progenies.

Resistance genes to three economically important species of nematodes have been
mapped in potato. Two of the species (Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida) are
root cyst nematodes, whereas M. chitwoodi is a root knot nematode. The first nematode
resistance gene (H1) was discovered in the 1950s (Toxopeus and Huijsman, 1953), and
since then, it has been introgressed into many commercially available cultivars to control
G. rostochiensis pathotypes. The gene is located on potato chromosome 5. Additional
dominant genes for qualitative resistance to G. rostochiensis and G. pallida have been
mapped, together with several major QRL. However, only a single resistance locus against
M. chitwoodi species has been identified so far in the potato genome. The RMc1 gene
from S. bulbocastanum was introgressed into cultivated potato by somatic hybridization
(Brown et al., 1996). It was demonstrated later that the resistance spectrum of RMc1
includes not only M. chitwoodi and the related species Meloidogyne fallax but also a
genetically distinct population of Meloidogyne hapla (Rouppe van der Voort et al., 1999).
Quantitative resistance loci against bacteria E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica, a causal
agent (together with other Erwinia species) of potato black leg and tuber soft rot, were
detected in a diploid population with complex pedigree that included three Solanum
species: Solanum yungasense, S. tuberosum, and S. chacoense. Genetic factors affecting
resistance to E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica were found on all 12 potato chromosomes
(Zimnoch-Guzowska et al., 2000).

Potato is affected by a number of fungal pathogens; however, only a limited number
generate major loss of a crop. As of 2006, monogenic resistance to Synchytrium endobi-
oticum (potato wart), and QRL for resistance to A. solani (early blight), V. dahliae, and
V. albo-atrum (Verticillium wilt) have been identified.

The most economically important disease of potato is late blight caused by oomycete
P. infestans. Twenty R-genes, conferring potato foliage resistance against late blight,
have been placed on a molecular map so far. Eleven of the genes (R1, R2, R3a, R3b,
R5–R11) come from S. demissum, four genes (RB/Rpi-blb1, Rpi-blb2, Rpi-blb3, Rpi-abpt)
from S. bulbocastanum, and one each from S. berthaultii (cid:2)Rber /RPi−ber (cid:3), S. pinnatisectum

(Rpi1), and Solanum mochiquense (Rpi-moc1). Nine R-genes (R3a, R3b, R5–R11) are
clustered in the late-blight resistance hotspot on the distal part of chromosome 11. In
addition to phenotypically characterized classical R-genes originating from S. demissum
(Black et al., 1953), several of the fully functional allelic versions or duplications of the
resistance genes were detected on chromosomes 4 (R2-like) (Park et al., 2005b) and 11
(SH R3, Ma R3, Sc R3, and FS R3) (Huang et al., 2005).

Polygenic factors affecting foliage resistance to late blight have been identified on all
12 chromosomes. Most of the QRL have a relatively small or moderate effect on the
resistance, although about one-tenth of the mapped QRL explain 30–50% of the trait vari-
ation. Rarely, the detected QRL explains more than half of the total phenotypic variation.
Because QRL are positioned on the molecular map with less precision than single genes
and the confidence interval of the QRL position may exceed 40 cM (Simko, 2002), it is
problematic to compare the location of resistance QRL from different studies. Neverthe-
less, when the likelihood of QRL being detected by different studies in the same general
genomic region was estimated from a binomial distribution, regions on chromosomes 3,
4, and 5 were identified with a high probability as late-blight resistance hotspots (Simko,
2002; Jones and Simko, 2005). The most obvious and consistent resistance hotspot is
located on chromosome 5, near the marker locus GP179. Unfortunately, plants having
alleles at this locus, which increases foliage resistance, usually exhibit later maturity.
Linkage between resistance and maturity at this chromosomal location was confirmed by
association mapping performed on almost 600 cultivars. In this study, the markers tightly
linked to the R1 gene were significantly associated with quantitative resistance to late
blight and late maturity (Gebhardt et al., 2004). There is a possibility that a single gene
near the GP179 marker locus has a pleiotropic effect on both plant resistance and maturity
(Bradshaw et al., 2004b). However, the presence of two tightly linked loci cannot be
ruled out with one locus having a pleiotropic effect on both late-blight resistance and
foliage maturity, and another having merely an effect on resistance (Visker et al., 2003).
While several genes have been mapped for foliage resistance to late blight, there is
relatively little information about the genes affecting resistance in tubers. In many cases,
the relationship between late-blight resistance in foliage and tuber can be ambiguous.
Oberhagemann et al. (1999) hypothesized that a differential expression in leaves and
tubers of multiple alleles and allele combinations results in a differential effect on late-
blight resistance in the two tissues.
Very little information has been published concerning natural insect resistance loci
in potato. In one study, two reciprocal backcross S. tuberosum × S. berthaultii potato
progenies were screened for resistance to CPB consumption, oviposition, and defoliation
(Yencho et al., 1996). Most of the QRL for resistance to CPB were linked to the loci
for glandular trichome traits (Bonierbale et al., 1994). However, a relatively strong and
consistent QRL for trichome-independent insect resistance was observed in both backcross
populations on chromosome 1 (Yencho et al., 1996).

Depicting the location of known R-genes and QRL on the potato linkage map reveals
clustering of resistance genes (Fig. 7.1). These hotspots contain multiple gene families
conferring resistance to a range of different pathogens. The most prominent R-gene clus-
ters are located on chromosomes 4, 5, 9, 11, and 12. Such clustered resistance gene families

likely evolved from common ancestors by means of gene duplication with subsequent
structural and functional diversification. Integrating the position of genes for quantitative
resistance into the functional map shows a positional linkage between clusters of R-genes
and QRL. A major QRL cluster on chromosome 5 comprises loci conferring resistance
to virus, fungi, oomycete, bacteria, and nematodes. As new resistance genes are continu-
ously mapped, the reader is referred to the potato functional map of pathogen resistance
in the PoMaMo (Meyer et al., 2005) database (https://gabi.rzpd.de/PoMaMo.html).

7.3.3 Resistance genes cloned and characterized

Plant R-genes are presumed to enable the detection of avirulence (Avr) gene-specified
pathogen molecules, initiate signal transduction to activate defenses, and have the capacity
to evolve new specificities rapidly (Hammond-Kosack and Jones, 1997). Despite interac-
tions with a wide range of pathogens, plant R-genes encode only five classes of resistance
proteins. The majority of the cloned R-genes encode proteins containing a predicted
nucleotide-binding site (NBS) followed by a series of leucine-rich repeats (LRR) at their
C termini. NBS–LRR resistance proteins generally contain one of two types of N-terminal
domains that have homology with the Toll and interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) proteins or a
predicted coiled-coil domain (CC) (Ellis et al., 2000; Pan et al., 2000b; Dangl and Jones,
2001). The other four classes encode LRR, CC, kinase, and LRR plus kinase-conserved
domains (Dangl and Jones, 2001) (Fig. 7.2). As of 2006, eight different resistance genes
have been cloned from potato, and all of them are members of the NBS–LRR superfam-
ily. The cloned genes are involved in the recognition of avirulence factors of viruses,
nematodes, and oomycetes. It has been estimated that the potato genome contains at least
100–200 genes of this class (Gebhardt and Valkonen, 2001).

7.3.3.1 Virus resistance genes Rx and Rx2

The first resistance gene that was cloned and sequenced from potato was the Rx gene
for extreme resistance against PVX (Bendahmane et al., 1999). The Rx-mediated extreme
resistance in potato does not involve a necrotic hypersensitive response at the site of
initial infection; however, the Rx protein is structurally similar to products of disease
resistance genes conferring the hypersensitive response (Bendahmane et al., 1999). The
highest degree of similarity is between Rx and a subclass of CC–NBS–LRR resistance
proteins. Sequence analysis has revealed that Rx encodes a protein of 937 amino acid
residues with molecular weight of 107.5 kDa (Bendahmane et al., 1999). The Rx locus
has been introgressed into a cultivated S. tuberosum potato from Solanum andigena and
maps to chromosome 12 (Bendahmane et al., 1997). In contrast, Rx2, the second PVX
resistance gene cloned from potato (Bendahmane et al., 2000), was introgressed from
S. acaule and is located on chromosome 5 (Ritter et al., 1991). The two genes share 95%
sequence identity. Based on sequence conservation in Rx and Rx2, it is clear that there is
a direct evolutionary relationship between these proteins, though the proteins are encoded
on different chromosomes of different species (Bendahmane et al., 2000).

Song et al., 2003; Paal et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2005; van der Vossen et al., 2003; van der Vossen et al., 2005). Conserved
domains in the resistance proteins are CC, coiled-coil; Kin, kinase; LRR, leucine-rich repeats; NBS, nucleotide-binding site;
and TIR, Toll and interleukin-1 receptor (Dangl and Jones, 2001). Resistance proteins isolated from potato are boxed.

7.3.3.2 Nematode resistance genes Gpa2 and Gro1

The isolation of the nematode resistance gene Gpa2 (van der Vossen et al., 2000) on
chromosome 12 was achieved when the genomic region containing the Rx resistance
gene was further analyzed. Molecular analysis of this chromosomal region revealed that
the Gpa2 locus is one of four highly homologous genes in a region of approximately
115 kb. At least two of these genes are active. One homolog corresponds to the previously
isolated Rx gene that confers resistance to PVX, whereas the other corresponds to the
Gpa2 gene that confers resistance to potato cyst nematode G. pallida. The deduced open
reading frame of the Gpa2 gene encodes a predicted polypeptide of 912 amino acids
with a molecular weight of 104.5 kDa (van der Vossen et al., 2000). The Gpa2 protein
belongs to the CC–NBS–LRR class of plant resistance genes and shares over 88% amino
acid identity with Rx and Rx2. Sequence conservation points to a direct evolutionary
relationship of these proteins and to the fact that genes for resistance to distinct pathogens
might be structurally similar. Isolation of Gpa2 from the Rx-gene cluster demonstrates
that within a single haplotype, members of the same R-gene cluster can evolve to confer
resistance to distinct pathogen species (van der Vossen et al., 2000).

Gro1-4, a major, dominant locus conferring resistance to G. rostochiensis that is
localized on potato chromosome 7 (Barone et al., 1990; Ballvora et al., 1995), has been
recently cloned (Paal et al., 2004). Gro1-4 is a member of the Gro1 candidate gene
family consisting of 15 closely related candidate resistance genes. The gene encodes a
protein of 1136 amino acids that contains a Toll–interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain
(Paal et al., 2004) and belongs to the TIR–NBS–LRR group of resistance genes (Dangl
and Jones, 2001). Gro1-4 is the first potato resistance gene of this type. At the nucleotide
level, Gro1-4 is more than 90% identical with two NBS–LRR-type R-gene homologs of
tomato, which map to syntenic positions and are tightly linked to the tomato I3 gene for
resistance to Fusarium oxysporum (Pan et al., 2000a). Analysis of the susceptible cultivar
Desirée complemented with Gro1-4 showed that the gene is able to confer resistance to
G. rostochiensis pathotype Ro1. Reverse transcriptase (RT)–PCR products of the gene
family were generated from stem, leaf, flower, tuber, and stolon cDNA, demonstrating
that the members of the Gro1 gene family are expressed in all tested potato tissues.
The possibility exists that other members of the Gro1 gene family are also functional
nematode R-genes conferring resistance to pathotypes other than Ro1 (Paal et al., 2004).

7.3.3.3 Oomycete resistance genes R1, R3a, RB/Rpi-blb1, and Rpi-blb2

Ballvora et al. (2002) used a combination of positional cloning and a candidate gene
approach to clone R1, the race-specific gene for resistance to late blight. The R1 gene
encodes a protein of 1293 amino acids with a molecular mass of 149.4 kDa. Based on the
deduced protein sequence, R1 is a member of the CC–NBS–LRR class of plant resistance
genes (Hammond-Kosack and Jones, 1997). The most closely related plant resistance
gene (36% identity) is the Prf gene for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae of tomato
(Ballvora et al., 2002). Two potato genes for resistance to PVX, Rx2 and Nb, map to
similar positions as R1 (Ritter et al., 1991; De Jong et al., 1997). The Rx2 gene has
been cloned and is, like R1, a member of the CC–NBS–LRR class of resistance genes
(Bendahmane et al., 2000). The two resistance genes share 32% sequence identity and

144

Simko et al.

are therefore different members of the same superfamily of genes. Analysis of the R1
genomic region indicates that further paralogous members may be located in the region.
There is the possibility that the R1 locus hosts more than one R-gene with the same race
specificity, or, in addition to R1, other R-genes with so far unknown specificities. The
interaction between R1 and the late-blight pathogen P. infestans is in accordance with
the gene-for-gene concept (Flor, 1971). Transfer of a single gene to susceptible cultivar
Desirée was sufficient to elicit the hypersensitive resistance response upon infection with
a P. infestans race incompatible with R1 (Ballvora et al., 2002). The R1 gene is located
within a resistance hotspot on chromosome 5 that includes major QRL for resistance to
P. infestans (Gebhardt and Valkonen, 2001; Simko, 2002; Jones and Simko, 2005).

Huang et al. (2005) used the comparative genomics approach to isolate the R3a
resistance gene. Analysis of R3a revealed that the gene encodes a predicted polypeptide
of 1282 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 145.9 kDa. The R3a gene encodes
a putative CC–NBS–LRR protein and shares 88% DNA identity and 83% amino acid
similarity to I2 of tomato that confers resistance to fungus F. oxysporum. The R3a and
I2 proteins are more related to each other than to other known R-proteins. Thus, the I2
and R3a genes belong to the same R-gene family. The R3a protein bears only limited
similarity (15 and 30% amino acid identity) to the other two late-blight R-proteins, R1
and RB/Rpi-blb1 respectively (Huang et al., 2005). The R3a-gene family contains at least
four full-length and many truncated paralogues. Constitutive expression was observed for
the R3a gene, as well as some of its paralogues whose functions remain unknown (Huang
et al., 2005). Comparative analyses of the R3 complex locus with the corresponding I2
complex locus in tomato suggest that this is an ancient locus involved in plant innate
immunity against oomycete and fungal pathogens. However, the R3 complex locus has
evolved after its divergence from tomato. This expansion has resulted in an increase in the
number of R-genes and in functional diversification (Huang et al., 2005). The R3 locus
is composed of two genes with distinct specificity. The two genes – R3a and R3b – have
been mapped 0.4 cM apart and both have been introgressed from S. demissum (Huang
et al., 2004). At least 10 additional I2 gene analogs have been found in the R3b region
(Huang et al., 2005).

Potato germplasm derived from S. bulbocastanum has shown durable and effective
resistance against P. infestans in field tests. Two groups independently isolated the
resistance gene from S. bulbocastanum-derived material. The coding sequence of the
RB gene (Song et al., 2003) is identical to that of the Rpi-blb1 gene (van der Vossen
et al., 2003), which suggests that the two isolated genes are identical. However, when
flanking sequences and the intron of these two genes were compared, single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) were found at a frequency ranging from 0.4 to 0.8%. Van der
Vossen et al. (2003) therefore concluded that RB and Rpi-blb1 are allelic, although
functionally equivalent. Molecular analysis of the resistance locus identified a cluster of
resistance genes belonging to the CC–NBS–LRR class of resistance genes. The RB/Rpi-
blb1 gene family includes one truncated and four complete genes within a 40-kb region.
The four complete genes are similar in length (2895–2979 bp) and have conserved intron–
exon structures (Song et al., 2003; van der Vossen et al., 2003). The RB/Rpi-blb1 gene
encodes a polypeptide of 970 amino acids and is more closely related to the I2 protein
of tomato (30% identity, 47% similarity over 1070 amino acids) than it is to any other

Genetics of resistance

145

known R protein. RB/Rpi-blb1 has limited similarity with the protein of R1 (22% identity,
49% similarity over 902 amino acids), a gene derived from S. demissum that confers
hypersensitive resistance to potato late blight (Song et al., 2003; van der Vossen et al.,
2003). The S. bulbocastanum resistance gene is able to complement the susceptible
phenotype in a S. tuberosum and tomato background, demonstrating the potential of
interspecific transfer of broad-spectrum late-blight resistance to cultivated Solanaceae
from sexually incompatible host species (van der Vossen et al., 2003). Similarly, as
with the original S. bulbocastanum material, the transgenic plants with the RB/Rpi-blb1
gene developed limited lesions on the lower leaves when inoculated with P. infestans
(Song et al., 2003). The resistance gene transcript was detected in unchallenged plants,
indicating the gene is constitutively expressed (Song et al., 2003).

Recently, Van der Vossen et al. (2005) cloned another resistance gene originating from
S. bulbocastanum – Rpi-blb2. Similarly to RB/Rpi-blb1, the Rpi-blb2 gene confers resis-
tance to complex isolates of P. infestans. The Rpi-blb2 locus is located on chromosome
6 and encodes a protein that shares 82% sequence identity with the Mi-1 protein. How-
ever, whereas Rpi-blb2 confers resistance to late blight in potato, the Mi-1 gene confers
resistance to root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.), aphids (Macrosiphum euphorbiae),
and whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) in tomato. Molecular analysis of S. bulbocastanum-
derived BAC clones spanning the Rpi-blb2 locus has identified at least 14 additional Mi-1
homologs (van der Vossen et al., 2005).

7.3.3.4 Resistance genes in potato

Eight resistance genes have been cloned so far from potato. All of these molecularly
characterized genes have been found in clusters of various tightly linked R-genes and/or
R-gene homologs of unknown function. Most of the homologs appear to encode proteins
similar to that of the functional R-genes. Further complementation studies are required to
elucidate the function of these homologs in the plant–pathogen interaction. An intriguing
question concerning resistance genes is whether the rate of their evolution is directly
related to gene specificity; hence, broad-spectrum resistance genes (e.g. Rpi-blb1, Rpi-
blb2, and Rpi-abpt) evolve at a slower rate than race-specific genes (e.g. R1–R11).
The isolation and molecular analysis of additional resistance genes may help with the
identification of molecular motifs that determine resistance protein specificity and the
rate of gene evolution. Given the fast progress in genetics and genomics, and the rapidly
expanding knowledge about functionality of resistance genes, the number of mapped,
isolated, and sequenced R-genes and QRL in potato will increase rapidly in the near
future. Conserved domains from known resistance loci (Leister et al., 1996) and plant
defense gene families (Trognitz et al., 2002) can facilitate more efficient detection and
cloning of resistance genes through the ‘candidate gene’ approach.

7.3.4 Synteny of resistance loci in Solanaceae

In pepper, two major QRL for resistance to Phytophthora capsici (Lefebvre and Palloix,
1996) are located in the genomic regions corresponding to the potato late-blight R-gene
clusters on chromosomes 4 and 11, respectively. Three R-genes (Ph-1, Ph-2, and Ph-3)

146

Simko et al.

confer resistance to P. infestans in tomato. All three loci map to genomic positions
corresponding to potato monogenic resistance. The Ph-1 gene from tomato chromosome 7
(Peirce, 1971) appears to be positioned similarly to the Rpi1 gene from S. pinnatisectum
(Kuhl et al., 2001), whereas Ph-3 (Chunwongse et al., 2002) is located on chromosome 9
in the same genomic region as Rpi-moc1 from S. mochiquense (Smilde et al., 2005).
Ph-2 (Moreau et al., 1998b) from tomato and Rber /RPi−ber from S. berthaultii (Ewing
et al., 2000; Rauscher et al., 2006) are both located on chromosome 10. However, the
Ph-2 and Rber /RPi−ber genes do not appear to be orthologous because they show different
race specificity when tested with the US-7 race of P. infestans (Ewing et al., 2000).
Nonetheless, the similarity in the location of genes for resistance to Phytophthora species
in potato, tomato, and pepper suggests possible evolutionary conservation of resistance
genes. Grube et al. (2000) hypothesized that the general function of resistance alleles
(e.g. initiation of the resistance response) may be conserved at homologous loci in related
plant genera, although the taxonomic specificity of host resistance genes may be evolving
rapidly. In case of potato, tomato, and pepper, it is possible that the resistance gene
specificity across genera remains relatively conserved and those homologous genes are
still conferring resistance to Phytophthora species.

In addition to resistance against Phytophthora, the Solanaceae family shows a con-
served position of genes conferring resistance to some other pathogens. Three potato genes
encoding resistance to PVY (Ryadg and Rysto) and PVA (cid:2)Naadg(cid:3) reside in the resistance-
gene hotspot on the long arm of chromosome 11 (Brigneti et al., 1997; Hämäläinen et al.,
1998; Hämäläinen et al., 2000). The corresponding region in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum)
carries the N gene conferring resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) (Leister et al.,
1996). The Ve locus from tomato confers resistance to Verticillium species. The locus is
located on the short arm of chromosome 9 (Diwan et al., 1999). Positional cloning of the
gene identified not one but two closely linked inverted genes (Ve1 and Ve2) that indepen-
dently confer resistance to the same pathogen. When the tomato Ve1 and Ve2 genes were
expressed functionally in potato, resistance was observed in otherwise susceptible plants
(Kawchuk et al., 2001). This observation indicates that all necessary components of the
resistance response are present and functional in the related host genus. A probe derived
from the tomato Ve1 gene identified homologous sequences on potato chromosome 9 that
are significantly associated with resistance to both V. dahliae (Simko et al., 2004a) and
V. albo-atrum (Simko et al., 2004b). It appears that the Verticillium resistance genes in
potato and tomato retain positional and functional synteny.

However, even within a single species, the positional and structural synteny of loci
does not necessarily imply functional synteny. It is known that tightly linked and highly
similar genes can confer resistance to different pathogens, for example Rx to virus and
Gpa2 to nematodes. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that structurally similar loci
from corresponding chromosomal regions of different Solanaceae species might confer
resistance to distinct pathogens, a fact that can be used for gene isolation. The I2 locus
encodes resistance to the fungi F. oxysporum in tomato (Ori et al., 1997; Simons et al.,
1998). The resistance gene is located at the distal end of the short arm of chromosome
11, in the same genomic region as the R3a gene from potato conferring resistance to the
oomycete P. infestans (Huang et al., 2004). Information from the I2 locus was used to
develop resistance gene analog (RGA)-specific primers to amplify all candidate RGAs at

Genetics of resistance

147

the target region. This elegant approach eventually led to the isolation of the R3a gene with
88% DNA identity to I2 (Huang et al., 2005). Similarly, the Rpi-blb2 resistance gene from
S. bulbocastanum (van der Vossen et al., 2005) is positioned in the same genomic region
of chromosome 6 as the Mi-1 gene from tomato (Milligan et al., 1998). The two genes
share 82% protein identity, although they encode resistance to very different pathogens:
Rpi-blb2 to P. infestans (van der Vossen et al., 2005) whereas Mi-1 to nematodes, aphids,
and whiteflies (Milligan et al., 1998; Nombela et al., 2003).

These examples demonstrate how synteny within Solanaceae can be effectively used
for comparative mapping and gene isolation. The completion of the tomato genome-
sequencing project (http://www.sgn.cornell.edu/help/about/tomato_sequencing.html) will
provide additional extremely valuable information for the efficient cloning of other potato
resistance genes.

7.3.5 Marker-assisted resistance breeding

Selection of individuals with desirable traits from a breeding population can be based
on phenotype, genotype (assessed with molecular markers), or a combination of the two.
Phenotypic selection is more efficient for a trait with high heritability because it uses the
sources of variation of all the loci, while markers can use only those loci to which they
are linked (Charcosset and Gallais, 2003). MAS will be more effective than phenotypic
selection when the proportion of additive variance accounted for by the marker loci is
greater than the heritability of the trait (Dudley, 1993). Computer simulation shows that
MAS can be more efficient than selection based only on a phenotype if the heritability of
the trait is between 0.05 and 0.5 and the markers are close to the loci of interest (Moreau
et al., 1998a).

If the evaluation of a target trait is time-consuming, difficult, or costly, MAS has an
added advantage over phenotypic selection. For example, in breeding for resistance, MAS
allows the breeder to conduct selection without depending on the natural occurrence of
the pathogen or pest, or to perform selection during the off-season. Moreover, molecular
markers in genomic regions of interest enable the selection of individuals with resistance
to several pathogens simultaneously, unlike a phenotype-based selection that requires a
number of individual trials. Obviously, when the percentage of genetic variation explained
by the marker(s) is high, the efficacy of molecular marker(s) for MAS is also high.
Hence, MAS is the simplest and most effective for R-gene-based resistance traits with
markers tightly linked with, or residing within, the resistance gene itself. However, as
the recombination frequency between the marker and the resistance locus increases, the
value of the marker for MAS decreases.

In potato, molecular markers have been developed and successfully tested for a
gene conferring extreme resistance to PVY. Kasai et al. (2000) developed a sequence-
characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker to the PVY resistance gene Ryadg
(Hämäläinen et al., 1998). The marker was generated only in genotypes carrying
Ryadg, when tested on 103 breeding lines and cultivars with diverse genetic backgrounds
(Kasai et al., 2000). Other known R-genes that are tagged with molecular markers can
be conveniently used in MAS as well. For example, markers linked to the Ns gene
conferring resistance to PVS are currently being used for indirect selection in diploid

148

Simko et al.

breeding programs (Marczewski et al., 2002). With allele-specific primers, the presence
of the R-gene can be followed even if other R-genes exist in the same plant material.
Thus, resistance genes from diverse sources can be incorporated into a single genotype.
Whether R-gene polyculture (multilane development) or pyramiding of several resistance
genes or the opposite approach of eliminating the race-specific R-genes is an objective,
MAS is a valuable tool to achieve the goal more efficiently. Recently, Gebhardt et al.
(2006) elegantly demonstrated how MAS could be efficiently used in resistance breeding
programs. The authors applied screening with PCR-based molecular markers to develop
breeding material that carries combination of four resistance genes: Ryadg for extreme
resistance to PVY, Gro1 for resistance to G. rostochiensis, Rx1 for extreme resistance
to PVX, or Sen1 for resistance to potato wart. When tested in the presence of pathogen,
all selected plants showed expected resistant phenotype. However, an important require-
ment for molecular markers used in MAS is their universality in a wide gene pool, not
just in a specific cross. This problem was well documented when markers linked to the
Gro1 and H1 resistance genes in the diploid population were tested on 136 unrelated
tetraploid cultivars. The Gro1-specific marker was not correlated with the resistance phe-
notype, whereas the H1-specific marker was indicative of resistance in only four cultivars
(Niewöhner et al., 1995).

Lately, markers tagging QRL conferring resistance to P. infestans, V. dahliae, and
V. albo-atrum have been developed and effectively tested on sizable tetraploid popula-
tions. A highly significant association was detected between PCR markers specific for
the R1 gene (or markers flanking the R1 locus) and the QRL for resistance to foliar and
tuber blight. The marker–trait association was tested on 600 cultivars originating from
different countries. The marker alleles associated with increased resistance were traced to
an introgression from the wild species S. demissum (Gebhardt et al., 2004). Simko et al.
(2004a) observed a highly significant association between a simple sequence repeat (SSR)
marker and quantitative resistance to V. dahliae in a collection of 137 North American
potato cultivars. When the pedigree of these cultivars was analyzed, the marker traced
the origin of the resistance and susceptibility to two breeding lines widely used in the
North American breeding program (Simko et al., 2004c). Similarly, a highly significant
association was detected between the resistance to V. albo-atrum and an SNP marker
developed from the StVe1 locus. The marker–trait association was confirmed on 150
tetraploid cultivars and breeding lines as well as on a population developed from crosses
between highly susceptible and resistant cultivars (Simko et al., 2004b). However, as each
individual QRL explains only a relatively small portion of the variation in resistance, for
a practical application, additional disease resistance loci need to be identified and tagged
with molecular markers. After detecting and tagging enough resistance loci, the MAS
will facilitate more efficient development of new potato cultivars carrying a desirable
resistance gene combination.

Potato-Breeding Strategy

John E. Bradshaw

Scottish Crop Research Institute, Invergowrie, Dundee DD2 5DA, United Kingdom

8.1 INTRODUCTION

Potato-breeding strategy can be viewed as the key decisions that a breeder makes
concerning the objectives of a breeding programme, what germplasm and breeding meth-
ods to use, whether new cultivars will be propagated vegetatively or through true potato
seed (TPS), whether or not new cultivars will be genetically modified and how to achieve
durable disease and pest resistance. Sound decisions require knowledge of the evolution
of the modern crop, target environments and end uses for new cultivars, the reproductive
biology of cultivated potatoes and their wild relatives, and the population structure of
pathogens and the epidemiology of diseases. Genetic knowledge is also required and has
increased dramatically for the potato since the first molecular marker map appeared in
1988 (Bonierbale et al., 1988, 2003). Advances in potato genetics are covered in Chapter 7
(Simko et al., this volume) and Chapter 9 (Bryan, this volume). This chapter concen-
trates on their application to breeding new cultivars that will be required for sustainable
increases in potato production during a period of environmental change and human pop-
ulation growth. The examples chosen for discussion are those most familiar to the author
and are not intended to be a comprehensive set.

8.2 EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN POTATO CROP

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

N(cid:3)
Wild tuber-bearing Solanum species are distributed from the southwestern USA (cid:2)38
S(cid:3) and hence cover a great ecogeographical
to central Argentina and adjacent Chile (cid:2)41
range (Spooner and Hijmans, 2001). Hawkes (1990) recognized 219 species and grouped
them into 19 series, but their taxonomy is difficult and is being revised (Chapter 4, Van den
Berg and Jacobs, this volume). Simmonds (1995) concluded that just a few closely related
species in series Tuberosa (e.g. Solanum brevicaule, Solanum leptophyes and Solanum
canasense) were domesticated in the Andes of southern Peru and northern Bolivia about
7000 years ago. More recently, Spooner et al. (2005a) have provided evidence for a single
domestication in Peru from the northern group of members of the S. brevicaule complex
of species. The result of domestication was a diploid species Solanum stenotomum, also
referred to as a form of Solanum tuberosum (Group Stenotomum), from which other
cultivated species were derived, including diploid Solanum phureja (or Group Phureja),
tetraploid S. tuberosum subsp. andigena (or Group Andigena) and tetraploid S. tuberosum

subsp. tuberosum (or Group Tuberosum). Phureja potatoes were selected by Andean
farmers from Stenotomum for lack of tuber dormancy and faster tuber development so
that they could grow up to three crops per year in the lower, warmer, eastern valleys of
the Andes. Andigena potatoes became the most widely grown form in South America,
presumably because farmers found them superior to the diploids for yield and other traits.
Tuberosum potatoes were selected from Andigena types for tuber production in long days
in coastal Chile and are referred to as Chilean Tuberosum. The involvement of wild as
well as cultivated species as progenitors of Andigena and Chilean Tuberosum potatoes is
still a matter of debate, but they are genetically distinct groups of potatoes with different
cytoplasms (Raker and Spooner, 2002; Hosaka, 2004).

(cid:2)

Potatoes (tetraploid S. tuberosum) were introduced into Europe in the 1570s, and then
starting in the seventeenth century, they were taken from Europe and cultivated in many
other parts of the world (Hawkes and Francisco-Ortega, 1993; Pandey and Kaushik,
2003). It is likely that the early introductions came from both the Andes and coastal
Chile but were few in number and hence captured only some of the biodiversity present
in the cultivated potatoes of South America (Hawkes, 1990; Spooner et al., 2005b). It is
therefore remarkable that today potatoes are grown in 149 countries from latitudes 65
N
to 50
S and at altitudes from sea level to 4000 m (Hijmans, 2001) and that potatoes
are the fourth most important food crop after wheat, maize and rice (Lang, 2001). Their
distribution reflects the adaptation of S. tuberosum first to the short summer days of
the highland tropics and subtropics, then to the long summer days of lowland temperate
regions and finally to the short winter days of the lowland subtropics and tropics. The
distribution also reflects growing conditions that are neither too hot nor too cold and
where there is adequate water, whether rain or irrigation. Potatoes have also been adapted
to a wide range of end uses. As well as being a staple food, the potato is grown as a
vegetable for table use, is processed into French fries and crisps (chips) and is used for
dried products and starch production. In some countries it is still fed to animals, but this
use is decreasing.

(cid:2)

8.3 POTATO BREEDING AND THE NEED FOR NEW CULTIVARS

8.3.1 Potato breeding

The adaptation of the potato to a wide range of environments and end uses was helped by
its reproductive biology, which is ideal for creating and maintaining variation. Potatoes
flower and set true seed in berries following natural pollination by insects, particularly
bumblebees. Outcrossing is enforced in cultivated (and most wild) diploid species by
a single S-locus, multiallelic, gametophytic self-incompatibility system (Dodds, 1965).
Although this system does not operate in tetraploid S. tuberosum, 40% (range 21–74%)
natural cross-pollination was estimated to occur in subsp. andigena in the Andes (Brown,
1993) and 20% (range 14–30%) in an artificially constructed Andigena population
(Glendinning, 1976). This sexual reproduction creates an abundance of diversity by
recombining the variants of genes that arose by mutation, and as a consequence, pota-
toes are highly heterozygous individuals that display inbreeding depression on selfing.

Potato-breeding strategy

The genetically unique seedlings that grow from true seeds produce tubers that can be
replanted as seed tubers, and hence distinct clones can be established and maintained
by asexual vegetative reproduction. No doubt many Andean cultivars were produced by
farmer selection from naturally occurring variation. Domestication must have involved
selection of less bitter and hence less toxic tubers, and Andean farmers certainly retained
a much wider variety of tuber shapes and skin and flesh colours than seen in wild species
(Simmonds, 1995). Subsequent selection for early maturity, appropriate dormancy and
resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses must have occurred in many environments.

Modern potato breeding began in 1807 in England when Knight made the first recorded
hybridizations between varieties by artificial pollination (Knight, 1807). It flourished
in Britain and elsewhere in Europe and North America during the second half of the
nineteenth century when many new cultivars were produced by farmers, hobby breeders
and seedsmen. At least two Chilean Tuberosum introductions were used in breeding during
the nineteenth century. The cultivar Daber was introduced into Germany in 1830, most
probably from Chile (Plaisted and Hoopes, 1989), and likewise the cultivar Rough Purple
Chili was introduced into the USA in 1851 (Goodrich, 1863). North America’s most
popular potato cultivar, Russet Burbank, was derived from it by three generations of open
pollination with selection and released in 1914 (Ortiz, 2001). The descendents of Rough
Purple Chili were widely employed as female parents in crosses with European Tuberosum
at the end of the nineteenth century, and Chilean Tuberosum cytoplasm predominates
in modern cultivars. This uniformity of cytoplasm has been a cause for concern since
the epidemics of Southern corn leaf blight on maize hybrids with T (Texas) cytoplasm
in 1970–71 (Ullstrup, 1972) and still needs to be addressed by potato breeders. Modern
potato breeding started later in the 1930s in China and India, but these countries are now
two of the leading potato producers in the world (Gaur and Pandey, 2000; Jin et al.,
2004). The extent of progress since 1807 can be judged by the latest World Catalogue
of Potato Varieties (Hils and Pieterse, 2005), which lists over 4000 cultivars from more
than 100 countries, a remarkable achievement for a crop which outside of Latin America
was derived from a narrow genetic base. Although these present-day cultivars are the
foundation for future breeding, breeders should also seek to make full use of the diversity
that exists in native Latin American cultivars and their cross-compatible wild relatives.

8.3.2 Need for new cultivars

There is certainly a need for new cultivars despite the large number currently available.
At least two contrasting scenarios can be seen. In the EU, the potato industry is trying
to increase potato usage in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. New
cultivars must give economic benefits through more yield of saleable product at less cost
of production, whether the potatoes are for processing or table use. They must have inbuilt
resistances to pests and diseases that give environmental benefits through reduced use of
pesticides and fungicides. Increased water and mineral use efficiency are also desirable
for better use of water and fertilizers, both nitrogen and phosphate. Finally, they must
help meet consumer demands for convenience foods, improved nutritional and health
benefits, improved flavour and novel products. By contrast, in Asia and Africa there is
a need for increased and stable potato production to meet increased demand for food.

160

Bradshaw

New cultivars must deliver higher yields under low inputs, disease and pest attacks, and
environmental stresses such as heat, cold, drought and salinity. If possible, they should
also have improved nutritional and health properties.

8.3.3 True potato seed

Today breeders normally raise seedlings from crosses between pairs of parents to find the
best genotype in the best progeny to clonally (vegetatively) propagate as a new cultivar.
However, there are circumstances where cultivars based on TPS propagation are an
attractive proposition despite being genetically variable and inferior to the best genotype
that exists within the progeny. In the torrid zones of the lowland tropics and subtropics,
reduced seed costs (due to much smaller amounts of planting material required), flexibility
of planting time (no physiological age of seed tubers) and freedom from tuber borne
diseases (particularly viruses, but not viroids) can outweigh the difficulty of establishing
the crop, later maturation and less uniformity (Golmirzaie et al., 1994). TPS potatoes are
established in Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Nicaragua, Peru, Philippines,
southern Italy and Vietnam (Almekinders et al., 1996; Ortiz, 1997; Simmonds, 1997).
Although TPS can be propagated by direct drilling and transplanting, preference is now
given to rapid multiplication by cuttings or shoot-tip culture, which gives rise to give
tuberlets (first-generation tubers) or mini-tubers which can be chitted before planting
(Simmonds, 1997). Methods involving multiplication allow some selection to be practised
within a TPS progeny and hence are a compromise between clonal (vegetative) and true
seed multiplication. Whether to breed cultivars for propagation by tubers or true seed is
a key strategic decision.

8.4 ADAPTATION TO ENVIRONMENTS AND END USES

8.4.1 Genotype by environment interactions

Another key strategic decision is the number of new cultivars required for a given range of
target environments and end uses. The answer requires an assessment of genotype × envi-
ronment (including end use) interactions because it is unlikely that one of many potential
new cultivars will be best in all environments and for all uses. Genotype × environment
interactions can be analysed and visualized through a principal component analysis as
done by Forbes et al. (2005) to determine the stability of resistance to Phytophthora
infestans. A related question concerns the environments in which to practise selection. It
is known that selection in one type of environment has consequences for performances
in different types of environment, and Falconer and Mackay (1996) explained how these
can be quantified. The improvement of performance in one environment as a result of
selection in a different environment can be viewed as a correlated response and compared
with the expected response from direct selection in the target environment. The potato’s
vegetative means of reproduction does lend itself to selection experiments in contrasting
environments, but extensive studies have not been done. In practice, the logistics of seed
tuber multiplication mean that potato breeders are likely to select their early generations

Potato-breeding strategy

161

at local seed and ware sites and then test relatively few potential cultivars in a much
wider range of environments. Brown et al. (1996) found a greater correlation for total
marketable yield between the Scottish ware site, where clones were selected, and sites in
England (0.43–0.70) than with sites in the Mediterranean (0.00–0.67). Although the very
best clones from the Scottish ware site performed reasonably well in the Mediterranean,
the results supported the idea that selection would be optimized by selecting in envi-
ronments more similar to those in which the cultivars are to be grown. Potato growing
countries should therefore have their own breeding programmes targeted at adaptation to
their local environments and end uses, notwithstanding commercial companies wanting
to see their new cultivars grown as widely as possible.

8.4.2 Ideotypes

Recently, Haverkort and Grashoff (2004) have developed a decision-support system for
potato breeding based on ideotyping that may lead to the use of physiological selection
criteria for adaptation to target environments in ways that have not proved feasible in
practice in the past.

They define an ideotype as the ideal genotype for a particular environment. The
ideotype has a growth cycle with a length that matches that of the available growing
season, which is characterized by a temperature window (neither too cold nor too hot) and
resources such as solar radiation, water and nutrients. They claim that the optimal set of
‘genes’ can be calculated before starting a breeding programme for any environment. In
practice, it is a question of whether or not physiological selection criteria can be defined,
which prove superior to selecting for saleable yield per se in the target environment, and
this is a matter for determination by experiment.

The kinds of questions that Haverkort and Grashoff (2004) ask are certainly worthy
of consideration and may help breeding to accommodate future environmental changes,
including climate change. The aim is to quantify the benefits of frost tolerance for earlier
planting, greater sprout growth rate for earlier emergence, lower base temperature for
crop growth, higher initial leaf areas at emergence and/or higher leaf area development
rates, thinner leaves in temperate climates with less intense solar radiation than in the
tropics, changes in leaf area index and patterns of senescence, and deeper rooting and
increased water use efficiency. Optimization of nine parameter values in simulation runs
resulted in predicted increases of tuber dry matter production of 78% for unirrigated crops
grown in dry and sunny years and over 40% for crops with irrigation. The possibility
of such optimization should be taken seriously as fresh weight yields of 120 tonnes per
hectare have been achieved experimentally in the absence of pests and pathogens, and
with adequate inputs of water and fertilizers (Mackay, 1996), yet the average world yield
is only 17 tonnes per hectare (Lang, 2001).

8.5.1 Wild species

Recognition of Central and South America as the centres of origin and diversity of
tuber-bearing Solanum species resulted in numerous collecting expeditions, from those
pioneered by the Russians in the 1920s (Hawkes, 1990) to the more recent ones of the
1990s (Spooner and Hijmans, 2001). These in turn led to the establishment of a number
of potato germplasm collections worldwide. The main ones are the world collection at
the International Potato Centre (CIP, Lima, Peru), the Commonwealth Potato Collection

Potato-breeding strategy

163

(CPC, Dundee, Scotland), the Dutch-German Potato Collection (CGN, Wageningen, The
Netherlands), the Gro Lüsewitz Potato Collection (GLKS, IPK, Gro(cid:4) Lüsewitz, Germany),
the Potato Collection of the Vavilov Institute (VIR, St Petersburg, Russia), the US Potato
Genebank (NRSP-6, Sturgeon Bay, USA) and Potato Collections in Argentina, Bolivia
and Peru. Together they comprise the Association for Potato Intergenebank Collaboration
and have established an Inter-genebank Potato Database (IPD), which can be accessed
through the World Wide Web (http://www.potgenebank.org). The IPD contains 7112
different accessions of 188 taxa (species, subspecies, varieties and forms) out of the
247 tuber-bearing wild potato taxa recognized by Hawkes (Huaman et al., 2000a). Data
are available for more than 33 000 evaluations of wild potato accessions covering 55
traits (dry matter, starch, reducing sugar and glycoalkaloid content and resistances to
fungi, bacteria, viruses, viroids, insects and environmental stresses such as frost and
heat/drought). Clearly, these germplasm collections contain a lot of biodiversity, but it
is pertinent to ask to what extent they have been utilized in the past and what are the
prospects for their further use in the future.

The introgression of genes from wild species has been significant but fairly limited in
number. Resistance to late blight was introgressed into cultivated potato from Solanum
demissum and Solanum stoloniferum, resistance to viruses from these species together
with Solanum chacoense and Solanum acaule, and resistance to potato cyst nematodes
from Solanum vernei and Solanum spegazzinii. By the end of the 1980s, these wild species
together with cultivated S. tuberosum subsp. andigena and S. phureja had been used
extensively in the breeding of successful cultivars in Europe (Ross, 1986), and of these,
S. demissum, S. chacoense and S. acaule dominated in North American cultivars (Plaisted
and Hoopes, 1989). Likewise, one of the most successful cultivars to be introduced into
China by CIP, CIP-24, had S. acaule, S. demissum and S. stoloniferum in its pedigree
(Ortiz, 2001). The genetic base of modern Indian potato selections can be traced to only
49 ancestors, of which 10 from the UK account for 41% of the total genomic constitution
(Gopal and Oyama, 2005). The most frequent ancestors were two clones from the UK,
2814a1 and 3069d4, which trace back to a cross between Solanum rybinii (a variant of S.
phureja) and S. demissum, which was made by Dr Black in 1937 to introgress late blight
resistance from S. demissum.

Further improvements in the resistance of cultivated potatoes to abiotic and biotic
stresses should come from the greater use of wild species in potato breeding, given the
wide range of habitats in which they have evolved. Indeed, breeders should seek to make
full use of the diversity that exists in the world’s major potato germplasm collections.
The screening of these collections for desirable traits will continue and so will genetic
studies on their inheritance, followed by introgression of desirable alleles into Tuberosum,
as described by Bradshaw and Ramsay (2005) for the CPC. These approaches will be
supplemented by an increasing amount of molecular marker and DNA sequence data
(Chapter 7, Simko et al., this volume; Chapter 9, Bryan, this volume). McGregor et al.
(2002) analysed the entire CGN collection of 314 accessions of series Acaulia with two
amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) primer pairs and were able to verify
taxonomic classification and to identify redundancies. However, there was no consistent
relationship between the geographic distances of collection sites and genetic distance.
Hence, the challenge is to use the new knowledge being gained to help breeders find

164

desirable novelty amongst the available germplasm. The outcome may depend on whether
or not allele frequencies and distributions can be associated with features of the natural
habitats of the accessions.

8.5.2 Cultivated species

Following its creation in 1971, CIP in Peru assembled a potato collection of more
than 15 000 accessions of native potato cultivars from nine countries in Latin America
(Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela).
CIP identified those which were duplicate accessions of the same cultivar and selected
3527 individual cultivars among them, of which 552 were diploids, 128 triploids,
2836 tetraploids (2644 subsp. andigena, 144 subsp. tuberosum and 48 hybrids) and
11 pentaploids (Huaman et al., 1997). By 1997, researchers at CIP had already conducted
46 124 evaluations on the collection for the reactions of cultivars to biotic and abiotic
stresses and for other desirable traits. Then to aid utilization, Huaman et al. (2000b) used
cluster analysis of morphological data to establish a core set of 306 accessions from the
2379 cultivars of subsp. andigena still held at CIP. The set was chosen to represent the
widest morphological diversity and to maximize geographical representation. Evaluation
data were taken into account in choosing the representative accession of each cluster.
Isozyme analysis of the entire collection confirmed that the core collection had captured
a representative sample of the alleles at nine allozyme loci with only the loss of rare
alleles (frequency less than 0.05%) (Huaman et al., 2000c). However, a simulation study
revealed that a core collection size of 600 would be required to adequately represent allele
frequencies and locus heterozygosity (Chandra et al., 2002). The core collection should
nevertheless be a valuable resource for detailed evaluation and future breeding both in
Latin America and worldwide.

Most of the cultivars from Latin America are adapted to tubering in short days.
However, since the first experiment started by Simmonds in 1959 (Simmonds, 1969),
a number of programmes worldwide have demonstrated that, through simple mass selec-
tion under northern latitude, long-day summer conditions, subsp. andigena will adapt
and produce parents suitable for direct incorporation into European and North American
potato-breeding programmes (Bradshaw and Mackay, 1994). Likewise, during the period
1962–79, Carroll (1982) employed a mass selection method to produce a population
of S. phureja/S. stenotomum adapted to long-day North European conditions. Diploid
cultivars, such as Mayan Gold, have now been produced from this population but are
targeted at niche markets because their yield is only two-thirds that of Tuberosum pota-
toes. Direct hybridization of members of this improved diploid population with tetraploid
potato cultivars through unreduced pollen grains (4x× 2x crosses) resulted in tetraploid
hybrids, some of which were superior to standard tetraploid cultivars in both total and
marketable yield (Carroll and De,Maine, 1989). Similar work has been done in North
America (Plaisted and Hoopes, 1989; Haynes and Christ, 1999; Haynes and Lu, 2005).
However, relatively few clones of Neotuberosum (long-day subsp. andigena) and long-
day S. phureja/S. stenotomum have been used to any extent in the breeding of successful
cultivars, despite displaying yield heterosis in crosses with Tuberosum (Glendinning,

Potato-breeding strategy

165

1969; Cubillos and Plaisted, 1976; Tai and De Jong, 1980; Tarn and Tai, 1983; Maris,
1989; Buso et al., 1999). Part of the reason for this is that whilst adaptation to tubering in
long days was quickly achieved, other problems remained. Neotuberosum clones lacked
the regularity of tuber shape of intensively selected subsp. tuberosum clones, and long-day
adapted S. phureja clones lacked tuber dormancy. Hence, these populations need, and are
receiving, selection for further improvements to achieve the original goal of direct use as
parents in breeding finished cultivars (i.e. contributing 50% of their genes to their off-
spring, or 25% in backcrosses). The improved populations, along with modern cultivars,
should be compared with CIP’s core collections for molecular marker diversity to see
how many common alleles have been captured in the long-day populations and cultivars.
Decisions can then be made on whether or not there is a need to create and select new
populations that capture more biodiversity to further broaden the genetic base in breeding
for long-day temperate climates. Even if future populations of long-day-adapted Andigena
and Phureja/Stenotomum fail to live up to expectation, biodiverse populations that can be
assessed for tuber characteristics in long days should prove to be valuable sources of desir-
able alleles for molecular-marker-assisted incorporation into Tuberosum and thence into
finished cultivars. Using molecular markers and Tuberosum, Neotuberosum and Phureja
germplasm in the Cornell University potato-breeding programme, Bonierbale et al. (1993)
found that specific combinations of individual marker fragments were more important
than maximum heterozygosity for tuber yield heterosis. The big strategic question that
still needs answering is how inferior to modern cultivars do biodiverse populations have
to be for targeted gene transfer to be a better strategy than base broadening.

8.6 INTROGRESSION OF GENES FROM WILD SPECIES

8.6.1 Sexual and somatic hybridization of S. tuberosum with wild species
Wild tuber-bearing Solanum species form a polyploid series from diploid (cid:2)2n = 2x =
24(cid:3) to hexaploid (cid:2)2n = 6x = 72(cid:3), in which nearly all of the diploid species are self-
incompatible outbreeders and the tetraploids and hexaploids are mostly self-compatible
allopolyploids which display disomic inheritance (Hawkes, 1990). Crossability groups
occur, each defined by an endosperm balance number (EBN), although interspecific
pollen–pistil incompatibility and nuclear–cytoplasmic male sterility can occur (Camadro
et al., 2004). Today, by manipulation of ploidy, with due regard to EBN, virtually any
potato species can be utilized for the introgression of desirable genes into S. tuberosum
(Ortiz, 1998, 2001; Jansky, 2006). The schemes used for ploidy level manipulations
exploit the facts that unreduced 2n gametes are common in Solanum species and maternal
haploids (dihaploids) of tetraploid S. tuberosum can be extracted following crosses with
pollinator clones of S. phureja, thus allowing breeding at the diploid level before returning
to the tetraploid level by sexual hybridization for cultivar production (Jansky et al., 1990;
Carputo and Barone, 2005). Schemes have also been devised, in which somatic fusion is
used to return to the tetraploid level and maximum heterozygosity (Wenzel et al., 1979).
Somatic fusion has also allowed the production of hybrids between tetraploid 4EBN
S. tuberosum and diploid 1EBN species, e.g. the non-tuber-bearing species Solanum

166

Bradshaw

brevidens, which has tuber soft rot and early blight resistances (Tek et al., 2004), and
Solanum bulbocastanum, which has a major gene for broad-spectrum resistance to late
blight (Naess et al., 2000).

8.6.2 Molecular-marker-assisted introgression and gene cloning

It took from three to seven backcrosses to transfer a major dominant resistance gene
from a wild species into a successful cultivar, but fewer generations from cultivated pota-
toes (Ross, 1986; Bradshaw and Ramsay, 2005). Molecular-marker-assisted introgression
offers the possibility of faster progress because not only can one select phenotypically
or genotypically for the desired gene(s) from the wild species, but one can also select
genotypically against the wild species genome (Hermsen, 1994; Barone, 2004; Iovene
et al., 2004). In fact, with adequate molecular marker coverage of all 12 potato chromo-
somes, it is possible to estimate the optimal combination of population sizes and number
of backcross generations and to select in a very precise way for the desired products of
meiosis in each backcross generation (Hospital, 2003).

Where introgression is performed at the tetraploid level, the result may not be a
genotype with 48 Tuberosum chromosomes including one or more with the introgressed
gene(s). This need not affect the commercial success of any new cultivar produced and
propagated vegetatively but could affect the fertility and value of such a cultivar as a
parent for further breeding. The result of the introgression from S. brevidens referred to
above was a high-yielding clone, C-75-5+ 297, with resistances to both tuber soft rot
and early blight. Using both molecular and cytogenetic approaches, Tek et al. (2004)
showed that C-75-5+ 297 had 47 chromosomes, including four copies of chromosome
8, three from potato and one from S. brevidens, which was the only part of the wild
species genome present. By contrast, Barone et al. (2001) did obtain 48 chromosomes
and evidence of recombination between Solanum commersonii (an 1EBN diploid) and
S. tuberosum chromosomes in their molecular-marker-assisted introgression of tuber soft
rot resistance.

As potatoes are heterozygous outbreeders, use of the same recurrent parent during
introgression would result in a self of the recurrent parent and hence inbreeding depression.
This can be avoided by using different Tuberosum parents for each backcross but would
result in an entirely new cultivar, which may or may not be the desired outcome. The
only way to introduce a gene into an existing cultivar is by the transgenic route. Hence,
the molecular cloning of natural resistance genes and their transfer into well-adapted
but susceptible cultivars are being pursued in a number of laboratories worldwide, and
examples can be found in Chapter 7 (Simko et al., this volume).

8.6.3 Base broadening versus introgression

Most of the evolutionary, more advanced, tuber-bearing wild species are diploid with an
EBN of 2, the same as haploids (dihaploids) of S. tuberosum, with which they will readily
cross. These wild species are sources of genetic diversity in general, as well as genetic
resistances to diseases, pests and abiotic stresses, but they do not tuber in long days. By
contrast, Jansky et al. (2004) found that in 125 of 154 families of haploid × wild species

Potato-breeding strategy

167

crosses, more than 50% of the plants did tuberize in long days and could therefore be
selected for tuber characteristics. Hence, if they also produce 2n gametes by first division
restitution (FDR), the genetic diversity of the wild species can be efficiently transferred to
the tetraploid cultivated form in 4x×2x crosses and result in about 25% of the wild species
genes in the final product. This led Peloquin and his coworkers to propose such 4x× 2x
crosses as a novel breeding strategy designed to both introgress specific characteristics
and broaden the genetic base (Hermundstad and Peloquin, 1987; Jansky et al., 1990),
in a way similar to that envisaged by Chase (1963) in his analytic breeding scheme.
However, Tai (1994) concluded that haploid × wild species hybrids need to be improved
before they are used in 4x×2x crosses, e.g. through population improvement by recurrent
selection (Rousselle-Bourgeois and Rouselle, 1992). In summary, the strategic question
that still needs to be answered by experiment is whether or not wild species contain
sufficient desirable alleles to warrant base broadening as opposed to the introgression of
just a few desirable genes.

8.7 BREEDING CULTIVARS AT THE TETRAPLOID LEVEL FOR

CLONAL PROPAGATION

8.7.1 Parents

Potato breeding worldwide has traditionally involved making crosses between pairs of
parents with complementary features, and this is still the main route to new cultivars.
Increasingly, parents will have genes introgressed from wild species and they may also
be from complementary groups of germplasm such as Neotuberosum and Andigena to
exploit yield heterosis. The aim is to generate genetical variation on which phenotypic
selection can be practised over a number of vegetative generations for clones with as
many desirable characteristics as possible for release as new cultivars. The choice of
parents is important because breeding can never simply be a number game. If each of the
100 or so countries listed in the World Catalogue of Potato Varieties (Hils and Pieterse,
2005) had 10 breeding programmes each raising 100 000 seedlings annually, the total
global effort would be 100 000 000 seedlings. However, crossing the 4000 cultivars
in the catalogue in all possible combinations would generate 7 998 000 progenies for
evaluation, and 500 seedlings of each would give a staggering total of 3 999 000 000.
By contrast, a phenotypic assessment of 4000 cultivars is feasible, and so is a genotypic
assessment of diversity and content with molecular markers. Hence, breeders can now
think in terms of capturing allelic diversity in a smaller core set of parents and of using
association (linkage disequilibrium) genetics to choose parents genotypically as well as
phenotypically (Simko, 2004). They can also use genetic distance based on molecular
markers (Powell et al., 1991) to complement coancestry/pedigree analysis (Tarn et al.,
1992; Gopal and Oyama, 2005) to avoid closely related parents, and hence inbreeding
depression, and to ensure genetical variation for continued progress. Both analyses are
required as clustering based on molecular markers can be different to that based on
pedigree (Sun et al., 2003).

168

Bradshaw

As genetic knowledge accumulates, it will be possible to choose parents for use in
pair crosses such that one or both parents have desired major genes and quantitative trait
loci (QTLs) alleles of large effect. Major genes have been mapped for flesh, skin and
flower colour, for tuber shape and eye depth, and for resistances to late blight, nematodes,
viruses such as potato virus (PV)X, PVY, PVA, PVM and PVS and wart. QTLs of large
effect have been mapped for maturity and resistances to late blight, Verticillium wilt,
potato cyst nematodes and potato leaf roll virus (PLRV). By contrast, many economically
important traits still appear to be complex polygenic traits and these include dormancy,
dry matter and starch content, fry colour, resistance to Erwinia, tuberization and yield.
For these traits, breeders will still have to rely on phenotypic data and use knowledge of
offspring–midparent regressions to determine crossing strategy. A statistically significant
regression is evidence of heritable variation, and the slope of the regression line is a
measure of heritability. With a highly heritable trait like fry colour, the midparent value
is a good predictor of the mean performance of the offspring and a few carefully chosen
crosses can be made (Bradshaw et al., 2000). By contrast, with only a moderately heritable
trait such as yield, offspring mean is less predictable and more crosses need to be made
to ensure that they include the best possible.

It is not clear how quickly information about expressed genes from microarray exper-
iments and gene sequence data will translate into genes for use in breeding programmes.
But again, it cannot simply be a number game. If the potato turns out to have 30 000
genes, as few as two alleles per locus (one desirable, the other undesirable) would gen-
erate a large enough number of combinations to be infinite for all practical purposes.
Hence, in the genomics age, gene discovery will need to be targeted at those loci likely
to have the biggest social and economic impact, and understanding the genetic con-
trol of key biochemical pathways may result in the fastest progress in the immediate
future.

8.7.2 Early generations

The programme at the Scottish Crop Research Institute (SCRI) before 1982 was typical
in its handling of the early generations (Bradshaw and Mackay, 1994). Visual selection
reduced the number of potential cultivars from 100 000 in the seedling generation (SG) in
the glasshouse to 40 000 spaced plants at a high-grade seed site in the first clonal gener-
ation (FCG), then to 4000 four-plant plots at the seed site in the second clonal generation
(SCG) and finally to 1000 clones in replicated yield trials at a ware site in the third
clonal generation (TCG). Several independent reviews concluded that such intense early-
generation visual selection was very ineffective (Tai and Young, 1984; Caligari, 1992;
Tarn et al., 1992; Bradshaw and Mackay, 1994).

One solution to the problem is the breeding strategy developed at SCRI, which avoids
the ineffective practice of intense early-generation visual selection between seedlings
in a glasshouse and spaced plants at a seed site (Bradshaw et al., 2003). Once pair
crosses have been made, progeny tests are used to discard whole progenies before starting
conventional within-progeny selection at the unreplicated small-plot stage. Clones are
also visually selected from the best progenies for use as parents in the next cycle of
crosses whilst they are multiplied to provide enough tubers for assessment of their yield

Potato-breeding strategy

169

and quality. Midparent values, as well as progeny tests, are then used to select between
the resultant crosses. Material from other breeding programmes can be included in the
parental assessments and progeny tests and used in the next cycle of crosses if superior.
Finally, in seeking new cultivars, the number of clones on which selection is to be
practised can be increased by sowing more true seed of the best progenies, but without
selection until the small-plot stage. Currently, seedling progeny tests are used at SCRI
for resistance to late blight [P. infestans (Mont.) de Bary], resistance to the white potato
cyst nematode [Globodera pallida (Stone)] and tuber yield and appearance, as visually
assessed by breeders. Tuber progeny tests are used for fry colour and a second visual
assessment of tuber yield and appearance. However, breeders wishing to use the scheme
will need to adjust the use of progeny tests according to the economic importance of
traits in their situations. The use of progeny tests for key traits also means that full-sib
family selection can be operated on a 3-year cycle for these traits, an improvement on the
practice of individual clonal selection after a further six vegetative generations (i.e. not
using potential cultivars as new parents until they are entered into official National List
Trials).

8.7.3 Intermediate and later generations

SCRI can again be considered typical in being able to handle 1000 clones in the first year
of replicated yield trials at a ware site. However, the relatively slow rate of natural veg-
etative reproduction (approximately eight-fold per year under SCRI conditions), together
with the complicated logistics of accurately assessing 1000 or more clones for a very large
number of traits, meant that another 6 years elapsed before one or a few potential culti-
vars could be confidently entered into official statutory (National List) trials. During this
period, decreasing numbers of selected clones were grown in increasingly sophisticated
trials over as wide a geographical range as economics permitted and breeding objectives
demanded. During these intermediate and final stages of selection, the production of seed
tubers was separated from the trials that were grown under ware conditions, designed
as far as possible to approximate to those of good commercial practice. In addition to
yield and agronomic performance, clones undergoing selection were assessed for their
cooking and processing characteristics and tested for their resistances to numerous pests
and diseases. Different breeders have no doubt given different priorities to different traits
according to their situation. However, the selection criteria and testing procedures in their
multitrait, multistage schemes will have been largely governed by practical considerations
and experience of the reliability of the various tests used, rather than by genetical knowl-
edge, such as heritabilities or genetical correlations between traits. It might therefore
still be worthwhile trying to develop a more robust decision-making process based on
multitrait, multistage selection theory and estimated genetical parameters (Bradshaw and
Mackay, 1994).

8.7.4 Genetic knowledge and molecular-marker-assisted selection

As knowledge increases about the number and chromosomal locations of genes affecting
economically important traits, breeders should be able to design better breeding pro-
grammes. As well as selecting parents that complement one another genotypically, they

170

Bradshaw

will be able to determine the seedling population size required for certainty of finding the
desired genotype, or more realistically, the number of cycles of crossing and selection
required before this is achievable in practice in the size of population they can handle.
A big impact on the efficiency and rate of progress would be the identification of superior
clones genotypically as seedlings in the glasshouse and the use of modern methods of
rapid multiplication to progress them to commercialization. This will require molecular-
marker-assisted selection or preferably direct recognition of the desired allele at a genetic
locus, as has recently been achieved for the RB gene for late blight resistance from S. bul-
bocastanum (Colton et al., 2006). Progress has been slow but is expected to increase,
and some possibilities can be found in the literature. Kasai et al. (2000) have developed
sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers to the PVY resistance gene Ry
(from Andigena, on chromosome 11), which should allow marker-assisted selection as
they showed high accuracy for detection of the Ry gene, and one marker RYSC3 was gen-
erated only in genotypes carrying Ry, namely 14 of 103 breeding lines and cultivars with
diverse genetic backgrounds. Bakker et al. (2004) have identified an AFLP marker (EM1)
which co-segregates with the H1 gene for resistance to Globodera rostochiensis pathotype
Ro1. EM1 and H1 were present in 19 resistant cultivars and absent from 26 susceptible
ones. However, Bakker et al. (2004) recommended conversion to a cleaved amplified
polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker for use in marker-assisted selection as such mark-
ers are cheaper and easier to handle. A marker linked to the QTL for G. pallida resistance
on chromosome 5 was converted to a single-locus PCR-based marker and shown to detect
the presence of the QTL in diploid and tetraploid potato germplasm (Bryan et al., 2002).
As there was good evidence that it was specific to an introgressed segment of DNA from
S. vernei, it should prove useful in marker-assisted selection for the QTL.

8.8 BREEDING CULTIVARS FOR TPS

Breeding cultivars for TPS was started by CIP in 1972 with the aim of high yields
and acceptable uniformity. None of the current breeding methods can deliver genetic
uniformity, and hence all of them involve selection for acceptable uniformity. Methods
and progress have been reviewed by Golmirzaie et al. (1994) and Ortiz (1997). Breeding
strategy has to take account of the reproductive biology of the potato and certain genetical
considerations. Clearly, flower production and berry and seed set are important, but as
the transport of true seed is relatively cheap, TPS can be produced in a favourable
environment which is distant from where it will be evaluated and grown. Current TPS
breeding aims to produce tetraploid cultivars, from 4x× 4x crosses in which heterosis is
exploited between Tuberosum and Andigena (Simmonds, 1997), or from 4x× 2x crosses
in which the 2x parent produces a high frequency of 2n gametes by FDR so that 83%
of its heterozygosity is transmitted to the offspring (Golmirzaie et al., 1994; Clulow
et al., 1995), or from 2x× 2x crosses in which both parents produce 2n gametes, again
with a very high frequency of 2n pollen produced by FDR (otherwise the offspring will
contain more diploids than tetraploids) (Ortiz and Peloquin, 1991). However, Simmonds
(1997) argued that diploid TPS cultivars should not be ruled out for the future, and
De,Maine (1996) produced TPS families of long-day-adapted Phureja which appeared

Potato-breeding strategy

171

as uniform for tuber size and shape as selected clones. Open-pollination of diploids
will result in almost 100% outcrossing because of self-incompatibility, whereas open-
pollination of tetraploids will normally result in varying amounts of self-pollination
and inbreeding depression. The inbreeding depression of the tetraploids may not be
outweighed by their apparent intrinsic yield advantage over diploids. Furthermore, the
seed fertility (seed yield) of diploids is greater than that of tetraploids. Whether or not
diploid inbred lines and true F1 hybrids could be produced in the future for maximum
heterosis and uniformity is a matter for further research. The inbreeding depression
from selfing also means that hand-pollinated tetraploids are superior to open-pollinated
ones, but their production is more expensive because of the cost of emasculation of
the flowers of the female parent (Simmonds, 1997). The use of male sterility that does
not involve loss of visits by bumblebees is an attractive proposition, e.g. the use of
protoplast fusion to transfer cytoplasmic male sterility into a TPS parental line (Golmirzaie
et al., 1994). Another possibility is the use of a dominant marker in the male parent so
that hybrids can be selected from the seedlings for transplanting and tuber production
(Ortiz, 1997).

The genetical basis of heterosis and inbreeding depression is also an issue, particularly
for tetraploid TPS cultivars. The theory of inbreeding and crossbreeding in tetraploids is
more complicated than in diploids. One generation of random mating does not remove
the effects of inbreeding in tetraploids and double-cross hybrids can be superior to
single-cross hybrids (Bradshaw, 1994). When selfing for a number of generations is
started with an individual with four non-identical alleles A1A2A3A4, individuals with
four and three alleles quickly disappear, whereas those with two different alleles ini-
tially increase in frequency before declining. The issue for TPS breeding is whether or
not interactions between four and three different alleles are important compared with
interactions between two different alleles. The evidence is inconclusive, but Golmirzaie
et al. (1994) concluded that crossing unrelated genetic material as a means of exploiting
heterosis in a TPS programme offers promising perspectives for rapid progress. Hence,
tetraploid crosses between Tuberosum and Andigena do make sense, as does the use of
diploid hybrids between Tuberosum and wild species as the diploid parents in 4x× 2x
crosses.

8.9 GENETICALLY MODIFIED POTATOES

As explained earlier, the molecular cloning of natural resistance genes and their transfer
into well-adapted but susceptible cultivars is an attractive and efficient way of improving
existing cultivars. Furthermore, where the control of biochemical pathways of interest
for improving traits is understood, down-regulation of gene expression using antisense
technology has proved useful. For example, bruise-resistant potatoes can be produced by
down-regulation of polyphenol oxidase (Bachem et al., 1994), high-carotenoid (pigments
with health-promoting attributes) potatoes by down-regulation of zeaxanthin epoxidase
(Romer et al., 2002), high-amylopectin starch by down-regulation of granule bound starch
synthase (Visser et al., 1991) and high-amylose starch by down-regulating two starch-
branching enzymes, A and B (Schwall et al., 2000). The genetic modification of existing

172

Bradshaw

potato cultivars also offers the possibility of introducing genes not present in cultivated
potatoes and their wild relatives and hence of novel biochemistry and desirable traits.
Specific examples can be found in Chapter 30 (Millam, this volume) as well as more
general issues in Section 7 on ‘Biotechnology’, but a number of points are worth making
here in the context of breeding strategies.

Potato transformation using Agrobacterium-mediated systems (e.g. Agrobacterium
tumefaciens Ti plasmid-mediated gene transfer) is relatively straightforward, but regen-
eration can still be a problem with some genotypes (Dale and Hampson, 1995). Briefly,
the gene of interest is incorporated into the bacterial plasmid along with a selectable
marker such as resistance to an antibiotic, the bacterium is co-cultured with freshly-cut
tuber discs or leaf or internode explants of the potato, and regeneration of shoots with
the selectable marker takes place in plant tissue culture in the presence of the selectable
agent. The products of transformation require screening in order to select the best trans-
formants for commercialization, including demonstration of substantial equivalence to
the parent cultivar (Davies, 2002). Commercialization also involves demonstration that it
is safe both to grow and eat the genetically modified potatoes. The gradual elimination
of antibiotic resistant markers will help to deal with one of the safety issues, but the
demonstration of economic, environmental and health benefits will be crucial in convinc-
ing sceptical consumers in some countries of the value of genetically modified potatoes.
The best strategy will be to modify high-yielding and well-adapted cultivars for specific
traits. Without going into the details in this chapter, it is nevertheless worth mentioning
the kinds of improvements that can already be made.

Genes that encode proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis have been shown
to confer resistance to the Colorado potato beetle (CPB, Leptinotarsa decemlineata
Say) and to the potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) (Mohammed et al., 2000;
Duncan et al., 2002; Davidson et al., 2004). Genes that encode cysteine proteinase
inhibitors (cystatins) have shown promise in conferring resistance to potato cyst nema-
todes (G. rostochiensis and G. pallida) (Urwin et al., 2003). Replicase and coat protein
genes from PLRV and PVY, respectively, provide resistance to these viruses (Duncan
et al., 2002). A gene encoding a chicken lysozyme enzyme enhances resistance to black-
leg and soft rot caused by infection with Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Serrano
et al., 2000). Transgenes that confer resistance to more than one disease would be particu-
larly useful. A recent example is expression of a gene for a derivative of the antimicrobial
peptide dermaseptin B1, from the arboreal frog Phyllomedusa bicolor, which has been
shown to increase resistance to diseases such as late blight, dry rot and pink rot and to
markedly extend the shelf life of tubers (Osusky et al., 2005). Protein content has been
increased and amino acid composition improved by expression of a non-allergenic seed
albumin gene (AmA1) from Amaranthus hypochondriacus (Chakraborty et al., 2000), and
carbohydrate composition has been improved by inulin production from the expression
of fructosyltransferases from globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus) (Hellwege et al., 2000).
Inulins enrich food with dietary fibre and replace sugar and fat. The conversion of sucrose
to glucose and fructose, and hence cold sweetening (the cause of dark and bitter tasting
fry products), has been minimized by expressing a putative vacuolar invertase inhibitor
protein from tobacco (Greiner et al., 1999).

8.10 ACHIEVING DURABLE DISEASE AND PEST RESISTANCE

Most potato-breeding programmes will have disease and pest resistance as an objective.
In any particular programme, the breeder must be realistic in deciding priorities for
improving resistance and recognize that the commercial success of new cultivars is usually
determined by their yield and quality. For major disease and pest problems, new and
durable forms of resistance will be actively sought, together with ways of incorporating
them into new cultivars as quickly as possible. For those that are less important, potential
cultivars will simply be screened to avoid extreme susceptibility. This can be done in
tests, or when natural epidemics of minor diseases occur. The prerequisites for successful
breeding are a source of durable resistance, a reliable screen for resistance using the most
appropriate isolate(s) of the pathogen and finally an understanding of the inheritance of
resistance. Breeding for disease resistance in potato has been reviewed by Jansky (2000).
Strategies are required for achieving durability of resistance because this is not a
property of the new cultivar per se. It depends on the population genetics of the pathogen
and the epidemiology of the disease, and whether or not isolates of the pathogen that can
overcome resistance genes are less fit in the absence of those genes than other isolates
so that resistance genes can be appropriately managed in the environment. Durability
is still difficult to predict with certainty and there have been mixed fortunes in the
past. The major gene resistances to PVY have proved durable and so have those to
PVX despite the occurrence of resistance-breaking strains (Jones, 1985). The H1 gene
has remained effective against G. rostochiensis in Britain because Ro1 is still the main
pathotype, but its widespread deployment has encouraged the spread of G. pallida.
Transgenic Bt-protein-producing potatoes provide an example of management practices
recommended to extend the durability of resistance to CPB. Monsanto advised growers to
plant 20% of their field area with a non-Bt-containing potato as a refuge for susceptible
beetles and to rotate crops and fields on which transgenic potatoes were grown (Duncan
et al., 2002). The S. demissum-derived R-genes for resistance to late blight failed to
provide durable resistance either singly or in combination due to the evolution of new
races of P. infestans (Malcolmson, 1969). As a consequence, many breeders started to
select for quantitative field resistance either by using races of P. infestans compatible
with the R-genes present in their material or by creating R-gene-free germplasm so that
screening could be done with any race (Toxopeus, 1964; Black, 1970; Wastie, 1991;
Ortiz, 2001). A good example is the well-known Group B germplasm from CIP, which is
being made available to developing countries through their National Agricultural Research
Systems (Trognitz et al., 2001). Forbes et al. (2005) have been able to demonstrate that
quantitative resistance in cultivars from the Netherlands, Scotland, Peru, Colombia and
Mexico was relatively stable across locations representing a wide range of latitudes and
altitudes. Although this is an encouraging result, it does not guarantee durability over
time. Nevertheless, it does seem worthwhile trying to combine quantitative resistance
with the other traits required for commercial success, such as early maturity, yield and
the demanding quality specifications in developed countries. Currently, there is much
interest and debate over whether or not the R-genes being found in other wild species
will be more durable per se or can be deployed in a more durable way such a multiline
produced by map-based cloning and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of a popular

but susceptible cultivar (Huang, 2005; Smilde et al., 2005). Finally, there is the question
of whether or not transgenic resistance can be durable. The R3a gene in cultivar Pentland
Ace has been cloned (Huang et al., 2005) and the corresponding avirulence gene, Avr3a,
in P. infestans has been shown to encode a 147 amino acid extracellular protein, which
is recognized in the cytoplasm and triggers R3a-dependent cell death (Armstrong et al.,
2005). A transgenic solution to resistance would be to produce a genetically modified
potato containing R3a in which a pathogen-inducible promoter was linked to Avr3a so that
cell death would only occur in those cells infected with P. infestans. Not surprisingly, the
search for pathogen-inducible promoters is currently an active area of research, as is the
expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and peptides or proteins with antimicrobial
activity in plants (Gurr and Rushton, 2005).

8.11 CONCLUSIONS

The evolution of the modern potato since domestication can be seen in Fig. 8.2, which
compares the tubers of wild species and primitive cultivated species with those of a
modern cultivar. Worldwide, new cultivars will continue to come from crosses between
pairs of parents with complementary features but adapted to local growing conditions and
end uses. However, breeders should seek to make full use of the diversity that exists in
the world’s major potato germplasm collections that comprise both potato cultivars native
to Latin America and their cross-compatible wild species. A major strategic question
that needs answering is when to use targeted gene transfer by molecular-marker-assisted
introgression or gene cloning and when to use wider base-broadening approaches. Suc-
cessful cultivars should be genetically modified to achieve further improvements by the
introduction of genes not present in cultivated potatoes and their wild relatives. Other
strategic decisions that need to be made are when to produce cultivars for propagation by
true seed rather than tubers and how to achieve durable resistance to diseases and pests.
Increasing genetic knowledge is expected to impact on both the design and execution of
breeding programmes.

9.1 INTRODUCTION

Cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum) is a key member of the Solanaceae
family and, along with tomato, pepper, eggplant and tobacco, forms a group of important
crop species which have been well studied genetically since the first use of DNA-
based markers in crop plants (Chapter 5, Gebhardt, this volume). Tomato (Solanum
lycopersicum) has a similar genome size to potato (Arumuganathan and Earle, 1991) and is
seen as a genetic and genomic model for the Solanaceae family, doubtless largely because
of it being both diploid and self-fertile. Genetical research in potato is hampered by its high
levels of heterozygosity and autotetraploidy and that it suffers acutely from inbreeding
depression. To counter this problem, most genetic mapping in potato is performed in
diploid populations produced by the crossing of heterozygous diploid parents (Chapter 5,
Gebhardt, this volume). Moreover, significant progress has been made in both linkage
and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping at the tetraploid level although this type of
approach has not been broadly adopted. Tomato and potato genetic maps show extremely
high levels of colinearity and have been shown to differ by only five major inversions
(Tanksley et al., 1992). A great deal of trait genetic analysis has been performed in
potato, for tuber traits (Chapter 6, Van Eck, this volume) and pest/disease resistance
(Chapter 6, Simko et al., this volume). The early history of potato molecular genetics
was characterized by many successful gene cloning efforts that were based on several
different approaches and that did not rely on the existence of detailed molecular genetic
maps. The earliest genes from potato were those thought to be involved in important
tuber biochemical processes and often involved the use of sequence information from
other plants, notably Arabidopsis. More recent map-based cloning efforts have had the
concomitant effects of facilitating the development of genomic resources for potato, such
as large-insert genomic libraries and localized physical maps. More latterly, there has
been the development of considerable quantities of expressed sequence tag (EST) data,
facilitating the availability of potato microarrays for gene expression studies. In summary,
potato genomics has really ‘taken off’ since the start of the new millennium, and potato
is now equal to almost any other crop plant in terms of the genome resources available to
those that work on the world’s fourth most important crop plant. This chapter outlines the
history of potato molecular genetics and the notable recent advances in potato genomics
and development of genomic resources made to date.

9.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE POTATO GENOME

Studies of the organization and evolution of the potato genome are quite few in number.
Cytogenetic studies are hampered by the extremely small size of the chromosomes,
although recent advances using meiotic tissue for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
and the use of extended DNA ‘fibres’ have overcome some of the barriers posed by
chromosome size (Chapter 10, Gavrilenko, this volume). Cultivated potato behaves as an
autotetraploid and has 2n = 4x = 48 chromosomes. It is well established that potato has
a genome size (850–1000 Mb) that is very similar to that of tomato (Arumuganathan and
Earle, 1991) and that their genetic maps show extremely high levels of colinearity, having
been shown to differ by only five major inversions (Tanksley et al., 1992). Consequently,
information on the structure and organization of the tomato genome is likely to be
equally applicable to potato. An early study showed that the tomato genome is essentially
composed of low copy number sequences that diverge rapidly in evolutionary time (Zamir
and Tanksley, 1988). One of the earliest attempts to characterize the potato genome in
terms of the amounts of different classes of repetitive DNA was performed by Schweizer
et al. (1993), who isolated some of the major highly repeated sequences from potato and
determined the distribution and organization of these in the genome of potato cultivars,
diploid breeding lines and wild species. These genomic fractions, in combination with
ribosomal DNA, represented only 4–7% of the potato genome, suggesting that the potato
genome, as a whole, was relatively devoid of highly repetitive DNA sequences. This
observation is supportive of the earlier tomato study and augured well for the future of
potato genomics and activities such as map-based cloning and physical mapping. There
have been surprisingly few attempts to follow up these studies with more detailed studies
of genome organization in potato, although recent gene isolation projects have yielded
‘bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-length’ tracts of DNA sequence that can be used
to glean insights into potato genome structure. Tomato EST and BAC sequence data
have been used to estimate that the tomato genome encodes approximately 35 000 genes,
largely present in euchromatin, which corresponds to only 25% or so of the DNA in the
tomato nucleus (Van der Hoeven et al., 2002). A key observation for tomato and potato
genome projects is that the majority of tomato heterochromatin is found in centromeric
regions with almost all the euchromatic DNA distally in long uninterrupted tracts (Wang
et al., 2005). Stupar et al. (2002) have reported the existence of rDNA-related tandem
repeats within highly condensed pericentric heterochromatin.

9.3 GENE ISOLATION

9.3.1 Early gene cloning and expression studies

Potato molecular genetics really began in the mid-1980s, with the construction of the first
genetic maps (see Chapter 5, Gebhardt, on mapping in potato) and the isolation of the first
potato genes by molecular cloning. This followed the development of the technique of
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for linkage mapping in human genetic
studies (Botstein et al., 1980) and the widespread availability of phage and plasmid vectors

for library construction. Thus, the first genomic libraries of potato were constructed,
and these were used both for probe generation for mapping studies and for screening
for clones containing particular potato genes. The subsequent isolation of many of these
genes depended in many cases on knowledge of tuber biochemistry and targeted genes
for particular known enzymatic pathways, for example carbohydrate metabolism and
important tuber biochemical processes affecting potato quality traits. In many cases,
genes were identified from genomic or cDNA libraries of potato using heterologous
probes/primers from other plants (e.g. Arabidopsis, other crops) or antibodies directed
against particular proteins but did not involve the use of molecular genetic maps that
were not yet available. Many of these studies were accompanied by expression analysis
of the cloned genes. The first potato genes to be isolated included light-inducible genes
(Eckes et al., 1986), the patatin storage protein gene (Rosahl et al., 1986) and the gene
for granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS; Visser et al., 1989) using a maize cDNA
probe. Possibly, the first study of a gene family in potato was performed by Wolter et al.
(1988), who examined five genes from the rbcS family, three of which were found to be
tightly clustered. Nap et al. (1992) found a lambda clone that contained two tandemly
arranged patatin genes, demonstrating close physical linkage between two members of
the patatin gene family. Taylor et al. (1994, 1995) used a potato stolon tip cDNA library
to isolate cDNAs for genes encoding a fructokinase and two beta-tubulins. These genes
were analysed for their expression patterns, and it was also established that there were
several copies of the beta-tubulin genes in the potato genome, with considerable levels of
divergence in their 3
non-coding sequences. Kang and Hannapel (1995, 1996) isolated and
characterized a potato MADS box gene (POTM1) that showed high levels of homology to
flower-specific homeotic genes of tomato and Arabidopsis, indicating that POTM1 gene is
a homologue of the APETALA1 (AP1) gene family. Gene expression data suggested that
this gene may function as a transcription factor regulating plant developmental processes
in a number of tissue types. Many potato genes were isolated using antibody screening,
illustrating how knowledge of potato biochemistry has proved useful for this type of
approach. For example, des Francs-Small et al. (1993) were one of the first groups to
isolate a potato gene using a specific antibody raised against an abundant mitochondrial
protein, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent formate dehydrogenase, to
screen a cDNA expression library. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and derived
methods have been used to screen libraries for the presence of potato genes. Graeve
et al. (1994) screened a cDNA library with primers specific to a glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDH) gene and obtained a full-length cDNA showing high levels of
homology to animal and yeast G6PDH genes. These are but a very few of the gene
isolation projects that were performed, but they give a flavour of the types of gene targeted
and the different methods used to isolate them. A key point here is that potato tubers,
being relatively large and simple organs, permit the isolation of nucleic acids or proteins
involved in physiologically important tuber processes in large quantities, thus making it
fairly straightforward to produce antibodies and ‘expression’ libraries.

Owing to the relative ease of performing stable transformation in potato, considerable
effort has been expended in the isolation of potato promoter sequences. Some of these
efforts were directed towards the goal of finding promoters that would direct tuber-
specific expression of transgenes, thus permitting direct insights into the function of such

182

Bryan

transgenes in tuber biochemical processes. For example, Herbers et al. (1994) isolated a
clone encoding a cathepsin D inhibitor from a potato genomic library. The promoter of
this gene was found to drive tuber-specific (cid:2)-glucuronidase (GUS) gene expression in
transgenic plants, and it was also observed that the promoter shared regions of sequence
homology with promoter regions of tuber-specific class I patatin genes. These promoters
and others with similar properties may eventually find use in transgenic cultivars with
improved tuber traits.

9.3.2 Map-based gene isolation

The development of genetic and molecular maps for potato has been reviewed in
Chapter 5. These mapping efforts have led to the accumulation of knowledge concern-
ing the trait ‘architecture’ of a large number of characters, including pest and disease
resistance, tuber quality traits, dormancy, tuber shape, eye depth and colour. These map-
ping endeavours have led to several successful attempts to isolate potato genes using a
map-based approach, with most of these being aimed at the isolation of major genes for
resistance to the more serious pests and pathogens of potato, the late blight pathogen
Phytophthora infestans (Mont. de Bary), potato cyst nematodes (PCN) and viruses. These
activities have necessitated the development of dense genetic maps around the targeted
resistance loci, as well as concomitant generation of genomic resources, chiefly large-
insert genomic DNA libraries, such as cosmid or BAC libraries and methods for their
screening. A BAC library is a genomic library composed of large (typically ∼100–120 kb
average size) segments of DNA ligated into a low copy number plasmid specially designed
for the accommodation of large inserts. Another consequence of gene cloning efforts has
been the increase in our understanding of the structure of the potato genome, through
the sequencing of a considerable number of BAC and other genomic clones containing
disease resistance loci. A notable example is the sequencing of 19 BAC clones from
the Solanum demissum R1 locus on chromosome V (Kuang et al., 2005). This study,
in conjunction with other studies of the region (Ballvora et al., 2002), has provided
invaluable insights into the structure of an important location in the potato genome, a
hot spot for disease resistance. It is clear that this region harbours many near-identical
resistance gene-like sequences and that the locus is extremely variable with respect to
gene copy number and physical length. This suggests that physical mapping in regions
of the genome harbouring important disease resistances may be somewhat problematic.
In February 2007, there are approximately 50 fully sequenced potato BAC clones in
the sequence databases. This number will doubtlessly increase dramatically in the next
few years through further gene cloning efforts and through potato genome sequencing
projects. These impending resource development efforts will facilitate a comprehensive
analysis of genome organization and structure in potato.

9.3.3 Use of candidate gene approaches for gene isolation

Candidate gene approaches for the isolation of plant trait genes have been reviewed by
Pflieger et al. (2001). The principles of this approach are based on the concept whereby

Genomics

183

a structural gene (such as an EST fragment or other coding DNA sequence) either maps
genetically near a known trait locus or encodes a putative function similar to the target
trait, then the said gene is a ‘candidate’ for the trait locus itself. A gene is a ‘candidate’
based either on its map location or on its known or putative function. In potato, there
have been a few notable successful examples of the use of this approach. The isolation
of the Gro1 nematode resistance gene is a good example (Paal et al., 2004). In this case,
the hypothesis was that the target gene was a particular type of NBS-LRR gene, and
a sequence-linked amplified length amplified polymorphism (AFLP) marker fragment
showed homology to this type of gene. Subsequently, a large number of candidate genes
were identified from the region which were then reduced using a combination of genetic
and functional approaches.

One of the most clear-cut uses of a candidate gene approach in potato has been the
isolation of the P gene in potato, required for the production of blue/purple anthocyanin

Li et al. (2005) have analysed DNA sequence variation at the invGE/GF locus on
potato chromosome IX that co-localizes with a cold-sweetening QTL. This locus consists
of duplicated invertase genes invGE and invGF. The study focused on 188 tetraploid
potato cultivars, which were assessed for chip quality and tuber starch content. Two
closely linked invertase alleles, invGE-f and invGF-d, were associated with better chip
quality in three breeding populations. Moreover, allele invGF-b was associated with lower
tuber starch content. The potato invGE gene is orthologous to the tomato invertase gene
Lin5, causal for a fruit-sugar yield QTL (Fridman et al., 2004). These results suggest that
natural variation of sugar yield in tomato fruits and that sugar content of potato tubers is
controlled by functional variants of orthologous invertase genes.

These few examples clearly demonstrate the potential of using the candidate gene
approach in potato. It is also clear that the extensive knowledge of tuber biochemistry
and the large number of potato gene sequences should enable its further application for
tuber quality traits. Studies whereby large numbers of genes involved in a process or a
trait can be genetically mapped will surely help in this type of activity (Leister et al.,
1996; Chen et al., 2001). In addition, knowledge of the location, structure and sequence
of resistance gene complexes should also enable this approach to be used for the isolation
of more potato resistance genes and QTL.

9.4 STRUCTURAL GENOMIC RESOURCES

9.4.1 Large-insert genomic libraries

Bacterial artificial chromosome libraries have become the predominant method for the
generation of large-insert genomic representations of plant genomes. Such libraries allow
an entire potato ‘genome equivalent’ to be represented by approximately 10 000 clones
(assuming average insert size of 100–120 kb). These libraries, in combination with dense
genetic maps, provide the main genomic resource for performing map-based gene cloning
and for the generation of local or genome-wide physical maps. Several BAC libraries are
now available for potato, constructed from a range of cultivars, breeding lines and wild
species. The BAC libraries known to exist for potato are listed in Table 9.1. These libraries
have, in general, been constructed for the purpose of isolating potato genes coding for
resistance to one of the major potato pathogens using a map-based cloning approach. A
BAC library constructed from the male parent of the potato ultra high density (UHD)
genetic map is being used for the construction of a genome-wide physical map of potato
(see Section 9.8). The UHD map of potato is a highly dense, but low resolution, genetic
map that contains over 10 000 genetic markers, primarily AFLPs (van Os et al., 2006).
The potato BAC libraries constructed prior to february 2007 represent a diverse range
of potato species: cultivated S. tuberosum (tetraploid), S. demissum (hexaploid), Solanum
pinnatisectum (diploid) and Solanum bulbocastanum (diploid) and so should represent
a useful resource for the study of comparative genome organization and evolution in
potato. Other developments arising from the use of these BAC libraries include the use
of BAC clones and FISH to develop chromosome-specific cytogenetic DNA markers
for chromosome identification in potato (Dong et al., 2000). A potato BAC library was
screened with genetically mapped RFLP markers, and BACs thus identified were then
labelled as probes for FISH analysis. A panel of 12 chromosome-specific BAC clones was
established, and FISH signals derived from these BAC clones serve as convenient and
reliable cytological markers for potato chromosome identification. The same group has
also shown that large-insert binary vector binary bacterial artificial chromosome (BIBAC)
and transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) clones containing genomic
fragments larger than 100 kb are not stable in the Agrobacterium strains used for potato
transformation (Song et al., 2003). This effect was directly related to the size of the
insert and was even observed when recA-deficient strains were used. These authors have
developed a potentially useful transposon-based technique for subcloning BAC inserts into
a small number of more stable smaller constructs that overcomes the instability problem.

9.4.2 Expressed sequence tag resources

The generation of large EST collections has become the primary route for large-scale
gene discovery in most organisms. Expressed sequence tag sequencing is generally
either a substitute for or a prelude to full genome sequencing. Basically, RNA is isolated
from a particular tissue (or a mixture of tissues for ‘normalized’ libraries), converted
to cDNA and cloned into a sequencing vector. Random sequencing of many thousands
of cDNA clones generates a large collection of ‘expressed’ sequences that represent

a proportion of the coding fraction of the source genome. Such an approach generates a
great deal of redundant information, but for an outbreeder such as potato, this redundancy
can yield important and useful information [e.g. single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers]. The first significant potato EST project
was reported by Crookshanks et al. (2001), who analysed 6077 ESTs, of which 2254
were full length, from a mature tuber cDNA library made from field-grown potatoes (S.
tuberosum var. Kuras). These ESTs were assembled into 828 clusters (i.e. an assembly
of more than one overlapping fragment from the same gene) and 1533 singletons
(individual fragments with no overlapping fragments from the same gene). Clustering
requires the use of analytical software that can discriminate between orthologous (same
gene) and paralogous (different member of a family of closely related genes) sequences.
More than 94% of these ESTs showed homology to genes from other organisms. Genes
involved in protein synthesis, protein targeting and cell defence predominated in tuber
compared with stolon, shoot and leaf organs, and 1063 clones were unique to tuber.
Transcripts of starch metabolizing enzymes showed similar relative levels in tuber and
stolon. Recently, the number of potato ESTs has increased very dramatically. Ronning
et al. (2003) report the sequencing of 61 940 ESTs from a wide range of diverse potato
tissues, both below and above ground, and including pathogen-challenged material. These
assembled into 19 892 unique sequences that formed 8741 contigs tentative consensus
(TCs) and 11 151 singletons. Putative function was identified for approximately 44%
of these sequences, and a small number of sequences was found to be constitutively
expressed in all the tissues sampled, with 21% being expressed in only a single tissue.
Table 9.2 provides a breakdown of the numbers of library-specific EST sequences
from the various libraries generated by Ronning et al. (2003). This EST collection
has subsequently been greatly expanded, both by The Institute for Genomic Research
(TIGR) and with the addition of more than 85 000 sequences from the Canadian Potato

These EST collections comprise a major genomics resource for potato researchers.
They contain a wealth of data on a large component of the potato gene repertoire and
will be an important source of candidate genes and markers in the foreseeable future.
A drawback of this resource is that the map locations of only a relatively small proportion
of potato genes or ESTs are known (Gebhardt et al., 2003). Given the possibility of full
potato and tomato genome sequences in the near future, the genetic location of most
potato genes should soon be established.

9.5 ANALYSIS OF POTATO GENE EXPRESSION

Isolation of cDNA or genomic clones corresponding to particular potato genes has very
often been accompanied by the analysis of the expression of these genes in different
potato tissues. There are far too many of these studies to discuss in detail here. Global
gene expression studies have been facilitated by the development of methods for per-
forming transcriptional profiling. These methodologies can be categorized according to
whether they are ‘open’ or ‘closed’ systems. Open systems include serial analysis of
gene expression (SAGE), subtractive suppressive hybridization (SSH), and cDNA AFLP,
require no prior knowledge of transcript sequences and can lead to the discovery of pre-
viously unknown transcripts. Closed systems (e.g. most microarrays) require knowledge
of transcript sequences for the design of probe sets. A wide range of these technologies
is now available, and some technologies have been used by potato researchers. Here now
follows a brief summary of the ways in which these types of study have been employed
in potato. Expression analysis is a discipline that is still in transition, and it is likely to
undergo significant development in the future.

Differential screening of cDNA libraries has been used, for example, to identify genes
whose expression is modulated as a result of different types of abiotic stress. Space
considerations preclude a full discussion of these studies, but a few representative studies
will be outlined. Van Berkel et al. (1994) isolated 16 clones corresponding to cold-
inducible transcripts by differential screening of a cDNA library, which were classified
into four non–cross-hybridizing groups. Some of these showed homologies to small heat-
shock proteins from other plant species, dehydrins, and to cold-induced proteins from
Arabidopsis and spinach. Rorat et al. (1997) isolated 12 cold-induced cDNA clones by
differential screening of a cDNA library prepared with mRNA from a cold-resistant potato
species. All the clones clearly respond to cold, and accumulation of the corresponding
transcripts was observed after 1 day of cold hardening; however, they varied with regard to
the timing of mRNA accumulation. The isolated genes corresponded to known genes in the
databases, such as S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylases, chloroplast chaperonins, cell-
division cycle proteins, malate dehydrogenase, elongation factors and proteins known to be

abscisic acid (ABA) inducible in tomato. The authors postulated that the identified genes
may be involved in two different functions referring to cold resistance, one protecting
chloroplasts and other cell functions under cold stress and the other involved in metabolic
adjustment to cold. Kim et al. (2004) analysed changes of expression in cold-regulated
mRNA levels in potato (S. tuberosum L. cultivar Superior) by reverse northern blot
analysis of 12 000 cDNAs. A total of 245 cDNA clones were sequenced from a cDNA
library constructed from the cold treatment. The analysed genes were classified into 12
groups according to their putative functions, where 20.2% of group I was associated with
energy metabolism, 13.1% of group XI with cell rescue and defence and 2.6% of group
VIII with signal transduction. Most of the cold-treated clones showed overexpression
compared with the control, whereas some showed down-regulation. In general, it was
found that cold stress-related genes were overexpressed more than two-fold. Kim et al.
(2003) have also examined the expression patterns of potato genes under cold stress
using small microarrays. Results showed that seven clones of cold stress protein were
up-regulated by cold treatment.

The cDNA–AFLP technique (Bachem et al., 1996) is based on an AFLP-derived
transcript fingerprinting method and has primarily been used to study gene expression
during different aspects of the tuber life cycle (Bachem et al., 2000; Trindade et al.,
2004). These authors have used cDNA–AFLP to analyse gene expression from stolon
formation to sprouting in a range of different tissues. Approximately 18 000 transcript-
derived fragments (TDFs) were observed, and over 200 ‘process-specific’ TDFs were
isolated and sequenced throughout the potato tuber life cycle. The sequence similarities
of these TDFs to known genes give insights into the kinds of processes occurring during
tuberization, dormancy and sprouting. One of the disadvantages of the cDNA method
is that it does not provide gene sequence information and requires laborious excision
or elution of TDFs from polyacrylamide gels for further characterization. However, this
technique is extremely sensitive and can detect differences among gene family members
indistinguishable by northern blotting.

A further development of cDNA display technology has been the realization that
cDNA–AFLP fragments can show genetic polymorphism in segregating populations and
can be mapped as transcriptome genetic polymorphisms (Brugmans et al., 2002). Impor-
tantly, these markers show less clustering than AFLP markers derived directly from
genomic DNA and appear to be targeted specifically to transcriptionally active regions of
the genome. These markers, as they tend to be relatively low copy, may be particularly
suited to use in genetic analysis, marker-assisted breeding and map-based cloning.

Other applications of cDNA–AFLP include its use to isolate a stolon-specific promoter
from potato (Trindade et al., 2003) and identification of genes involved in cell wall
biosynthesis (Oomen et al., 2003). More recently, the method has been used to perform
a large-scale survey of genes differentially expressed during the tuber life cycle and the
isolation of some of their promoter regions (Trindade et al., 2004). Most genes expressed
in the tuber life cycle are involved in defence, stress, storage and signal transduction
pathways. Twelve cis-acting elements were identified and are known to be responsive to
environmental stimuli known to play an important role during the tuber life cycle (light,
sugars, hormones, etc.).

Genomics

189

An example of the use of another useful ‘open’ gene profiling technology has been
reported by Faivre-Rampant et al. (2004a), who have used the SSH approach to make
a cDNA library enriched for 385 different genes that are up-regulated in the potato
tuber apical bud on dormancy release. One of these cDNAs was identified as encoding
a member of the auxin response factor family (ARF6), and the expression pattern of this
gene was determined byISH.

An alternative to microarray technology for gene expression profiling is SAGE, which
generates short cDNA sequence tags (Velculescu et al., 1995; Saha et al., 2002) using a
concatemerization-based method. Nielsen et al. (2005) have used LongSAGE to examine
global gene expression in potato tubers, generating 58 322 sequence tags (of length
19 nucleotides) representing 22 233 different tags. Putative functions were assigned to
almost 700 of those tags occurring at least 10 times. Almost 70% of these tags matched
a known potato EST sequence. This technology, such as SSH, has the advantage over
microarray technology in being an ‘open’ technology, with the possibility of discovering
‘new’ transcripts. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) cloning was used to verify
the reliability of SAGE tag annotation using EST sequences from more than one cultivar.
Seventy-two per cent of tags represented genes that participated in a known biological
process, with the largest group (43%) consisting of transcripts active in physiological
processes, about half of which were involved in metabolism (Fig. 9.1). There were no
transcripts found that were involved in photosynthesis. Of the 50 most abundant transcripts
from the mature tuber, protease inhibitors were the dominant class, which is in good
agreement with previous EST projects (Crookshanks et al., 2001; Ronning et al., 2003).
The methodologies used in this section are in some ways the prelude to microarray
studies and share with all such studies the ‘problem’ that they are only indicative of
the function of particular genes or sets of genes in biological processes. These studies
require functional analyses whereby the function of the candidate genes is compromised
or enhanced in some way. This topic is discussed later in this chapter.

9.6 MICROARRAYS

Existing potato EST resources comprise a large, but as yet unknown, portion of the total
gene complement of potato. The ESTs are from a variety of genotypes, tissues, expo-
sure to different environmental influences and developmental changes, and this allows
researchers to begin to examine differences in global gene expression patterns under
various conditions and to identify key genes active in these conditions. A non-redundant
set of 10 000 of these ESTs has been used by TIGR to develop a spotted cDNA potato
microarray that is available to the research community at minimal cost. Moreover, the
same organization offers a transcription profiling service to allow the evaluation of these
arrays by a wide range of users working on different Solanaceous plant species and differ-
ent biological questions. The performance of these experiments under a common exper-
imental system has allowed the amassment of a large amount of microarray data that are
publicly available (http://www.tigr.org/tdb/potato/profiling_service2.shtml#AProcedure).
However, this platform has the disadvantage of only having approximately 25–30% of
the available gene resource. Furthermore, the fact that these arrays are based on spotted

cDNAs, with which it is inherently difficult to achieve a high level of reproducibility,
makes it impossible to compare experiments without common references. Rensink et al.
(2005) have used this platform to identify genes involved in abiotic stress responses
in potato. Over 3000 genes were found to be significantly up- or down-regulated in
response to at least one of the stress conditions used (cold, heat and salt). The genes
can be partitioned into stress-specific or shared response genes, suggesting that there are
both general and stress-specific response pathways. In a very detailed study, Kloosterman
et al. (2005) have followed the expression of 1315 genes during tuber development. Tran-
sient changes in gene expression were relatively uncommon, and genes previously not

known to be differentially expressed during tuber development were identified (Fig. 9.2).
These studies, although both useful and informative, highlight the perennial dilemma
faced by plant molecular biologists in prioritizing genes for further study from a large
number of candidate genes in the absence of genetic information and mutations in target
trait genes.

The potato research community has, for the longer term, been looking towards the
establishment of an accurate, flexible and reproducible platform for microarray projects
that will permit comparability of experimental results between laboratories. Many of these
features are well represented in the ‘printed’ long oligonucleotide arrays manufactured
by various technology providers. The capacity to produce long oligonucleotides with
great accuracy is a particular advantage with potato, where the high degree of allelic
heterozygosity is more likely to result in misinterpretations when using short oligos. The
potato oligo chip initiative (POCI) has selected the Agilent ‘44K feature platform’ system

192

for this purpose. This will entail the designing of 60-mer oligonucleotides for up to 42 000
genes and was made available for use in 2006.

9.7 FUNCTIONAL GENOMIC RESOURCES

9.7.1 The phenotype gap

There now exists a wealth of information pertaining to the location of genes and QTL
coding for important potato traits, including pest and disease resistance and tuber traits.
The volume of gene sequence information for potato, notably EST data, is now substantial.
However, it is very clear that the recent developments in genetics and structural genomics
have not been matched by concomitant development of functional genomic tools and
resources that are available for model systems and some other crop plants. These tools
and resources comprise mutant populations, gene tagging resources, high-throughput gene
knockout and silencing systems and comprehensive microarrays. This deficiency renders
the identification of gene function problematic for most of the unique genes (more than
38 000) currently held in the TIGR potato gene index. Potato breeders and geneticists
have always been at a disadvantage in having comparatively little knowledge of the
genetics of the morphological and physiological traits with which they work. Exceptions
are the knowledge that has accumulated on the inheritance of tuber traits, such as shape,
flesh and skin colour (Chapter 6, Van Eck, this volume), and the induction of an amylose-
free starch mutant of potato (Jacobsen et al., 1989). As for many other crops (with the
exception of rice), the number of genes genetically mapped in potato is quite small,
making the use of a ‘positional’ candidate gene approach, whereby a mapped gene is
a trait candidate by virtue of mapping to or near the trait locus, infeasible for most
traits. For potato, as with other crop plants, there is a need for relatively high-throughput
methods for testing and assessing gene function. The availability of mutant populations
of potato would be of tremendous value in this regard. However, such populations are
not yet available in potato, largely because of its ploidy and preferred mating system,
and there is a dearth of described mutational variation in potato. Despite the extensive
knowledge of resistance and tuber traits, there is little information regarding the genetics
of plant architecture and biochemical characters. In the longer term, the lack of mutants
may be addressed by recourse to the use of diploid inbreeding lines of potato for the
development of mutant populations. In the shorter term, we are left with the use of
transformation-based techniques or use of viral vector-mediated gene delivery systems
for the establishment of information regarding gene function. There are tantalizing current
developments in the availability of functional genomic tools and resources for potato.
Of course, gene expression profiling or microarray studies have a role to play in the
identification of a pool of candidate genes potentially involved in any given biological
process. These methods, in combination with other functional genomic tools such as
RNA interference (RNAi), virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and activation-tagged
lines, have the potential to facilitate the identification of the role of thousands of potato
genes. Furthermore, combining structural genetic approaches (such as QTL and candidate
gene mapping) with functional genomics information (such as microarray-derived gene

Genomics

193

expression data for candidate genes) has great potential for the dissection of many
complex, polygenic potato traits.

9.7.2 Transgenic approaches for the study of gene function

Transformation of potato is a relatively straightforward matter, and so it is not surprising
that many attempts to demonstrate or establish gene function of cloned genes in potato
have involved the use of transgenic technology. These have included direct comple-
mentation by stable transformation, overexpression and antisense technology. The most
common and direct use of transgenic complementation has been for the establishment of
proof of gene function for several potato resistance genes thus far isolated. This type of
approach is only generally useful for ‘dominant’ phenotypes and points to the lack of
recessive mutations in potato. Overexpression has been used in several cases to investi-
gate gene function in potato, with mixed success. Rosin et al. (2003a) have performed
overexpression of a knotted-like homeobox gene (POTH1). Transcripts of this gene, iso-
lated from an early stage tuber cDNA library, were found in a wide range of tissues,
including meristematic cells, leaf primordia and the vascular procambium of the young
stem using ISH. Overexpression of POTH1 produced dwarf plants with altered leaf mor-
phology. Results of biochemical studies suggested that POTH1 mediates the development
of potato by acting as a negative regulator of giberellin (GA) biosynthesis. Oomen et al.
(2004a) have shown that overexpression of two different potato UDP-Glc 4-epimerases
(UGE) can increase the galactose content of potato tuber cell walls, that the two proteins
have different biochemical properties and that they have a different function in plant
development.

Suppression has been used by Rosin et al. (2003b) to examine the effects of a vegeta-
tive MADS box gene (POTM1) in activating axillary meristem development. The RNA
of POTM1 is most abundant in vegetative meristems of potato. Transgenic lines with
reduced levels of POTM1 mRNA exhibited decreased apical dominance accompanied by
a compact growth habit and a reduction in leaf size. Suppression lines produced truncated
shoot clusters from stem buds and, in a model system, exhibited enhanced axillary bud
growth instead of producing a tuber. Tuber yields were reduced, and rooting of cuttings
was strongly inhibited. Results implied that POTM1 mediates the control of axillary bud
development by regulating cell growth in vegetative meristems.

Oomen et al. (2004b) have modified the cellulose content of tuber cell walls by
antisense expression of four different members of the cellulose synthase (CesA) family.
None of the several transformants showed an overt developmental phenotype, but several
of them showed decreased levels of cellulose. Their results suggested that the cellulose
content in potato tubers can be reduced down to 40% of the wild type (WT) level
without affecting normal plant development and that the constructs used are specific
and sufficient to down-regulate cellulose biosynthesis. Liu et al. (1999) characterized an
anther-expressed protein kinase gene in Solanum berthaultii and examined its antisense
inhibition in transgenic plants. Transformants fell into two classes, one displaying a
typical antisense phenotype and a second type arising from a co-suppression event. Both
types of transformants gave rise to increased proportions of defective pollen, although

194

Bryan

the co-suppression effect was more severe. The results indicate that the anther-expressed
protein kinase is essential for pollen development in potato.

These experiments demonstrate that, although some knowledge about gene function
can be gleaned, the use of transgenesis to modify gene expression does not always give
unequivocal results. Complications can be caused due to unintended silencing effects,
presence of gene orthologues and other related phenomena.

9.7.3 Transposon tagging

The problem of a lack of mutational variation in potato has been addressed by harnessing
heterologous ‘transposon tagging’ systems in potato. Transposon tagging is based on the
use of mobile genetic elements to disrupt gene function through insertion in or near coding
sequences. For the development of an efficient transposon tagging strategy, it is important
to generate populations of plants containing large numbers of unique independent trans-
poson insertions that will mutate genes of interest at detectable frequencies. For example,
the Ac/Ds maize transposon system has been introduced into potato (Knapp et al., 1988)
and, more recently, into a self-compatible diploid potato clone (Pereira et al., 1992).
Significant progress has been made in generating independent insertions of Ds trans-
posons in mapped genomic locations that, in principle, can be used as ‘launching pads’
to mutagenize closely linked genes. Mapping of insertions is achieved by inverse PCR
(IPCR) to generate DNA fragments flanking the transposon-bearing T-DNA insertions,
which are then mapped using RFLP. The strategy envisaged is to recombine a closely
linked transposon ‘cis’ to a target gene and to rely on the known propensity of Ds to
transpose to closely linked sites to mutagenize the target gene. Despite these advances, it
is far from clear that these considerable, not to mention ingenious, efforts have yielded
an effective gene tagging and knockout system for potato. Problems remain with gener-
ating homozygous-tagged lines, and the rate of transposition is not sufficiently high to
allow efficient tagging of all loci. A subsequent study by the same group of authors (van
Enckevort et al., 2001) has followed the behaviour of Ac/Ds in potato. An excision assay
was developed for Ac and was used to monitor excision from GBSS (Waxy) gene in
somatic starch-forming tissues. Excision was found to be somewhat imprecise. Genotypes
useful for tagging strategies were used for crosses, and the frequency of independent
germinal transpositions was assessed. High levels of Ds transposition were found in lines
with Ac in multiple copies, and the authors concluded that the materials developed are
useful in somatic insertional mutagenesis aimed at the isolation of tagged mutations in
diploid potato.

9.7.4 Virus-induced gene silencing

Virus-induced gene silencing has become an extremely powerful tool for plant func-
tional genomics. Virus-induced gene silencing can be defined as the down-regulation
of host plant gene expression because of infection by a viral vector containing host
gene sequences. Virus-induced gene silencing has been used routinely in Nicotiana
benthamiana to assess functions of candidate genes and as a way to discover new genes
required for diverse pathways, especially disease resistance signalling. Virus-induced

Genomics

195

gene silencing is being increasingly used to generate transient loss-of-function assays and
has potential as a powerful reverse-genetics tool in functional genomic programmes as
a more rapid alternative to stable transformation. However, in potato, there have been
problems in establishing the two most commonly used Solanaceous viral vectors, tobacco
rattle virus (TRV) and potato virus X (PVX), because of problems due to innate host
resistance and a lack of infectivity. Despite these setbacks, there have been significant
advances in establishing VIGS in potato. Faivre-Rampant et al. (2004b) have shown
that a PVX-based VIGS vector is effective in triggering VIGS of a phytoene desaturase
(PDS) gene in both diploid and cultivated tetraploid Solanum species. Silencing was
maintained throughout the foliar tissues of potato plants and was also observed in tubers.
They also showed that VIGS can be triggered and sustained on in vitro-micropropagated
tetraploid potato for several cycles and on in vitro-generated microtubers. This approach
may help to facilitate large-scale functional analysis of potato ESTs and to provide a
non-invasive reverse-genetic approach to study mechanisms involved in tuber and micro-
tuber development. Brigneti et al. (2004) have also reported the successful silencing of
genes in a diverse set of potato species, using a TRV viral vector to achieve silencing
of the PDS gene in the diploid wild species S. bulbocastanum and Solanum okadae, in
cultivated potato and in the distant hexaploid relative Solanum nigrum. In doing so, they
assessed the effectiveness of different methods of inoculation (Fig. 9.3A), concluding that
agro-infiltration and sap-inoculation were more effective than simple spray inoculation

of virus, with sap-inoculation being more suitable for high-throughput application and
producing less undesirable necrotic symptoms. Furthermore, they test the hypothesis that
the VIGS system developed may be useful in testing the function of candidate resistance
genes in potato and its wild relatives, by silencing some cloned resistance genes, includ-
ing RB, suggesting that the VIGS system is an effective method of rapidly assessing
gene function in potato (Fig. 9.3B). Ryu et al. (2004) have developed a novel and effec-
tive agro-inoculation method (‘Agrodrench’) for VIGS in roots and diverse Solanaceous
species. This method uses TRV-derived VIGS vectors expressed from binary vectors
within Agrobacterium to induce RNA silencing. The method relies on a novel and simple
method of agro-inoculation, whereby soil around the plant root is ‘drenched’ with an
Agrobacterium suspension carrying the virus-derived VIGS vectors. Using this method,
these authors successfully silenced the expression of several genes in N. benthamiana,
as well as in economically important crops including potato. Agrodrench can be used
for VIGS in very young seedlings, which is not possible with leaf infiltration-based
methods. Another benefit is that VIGS has been shown to silence target genes more
efficiently than other methods in plant roots. This methodology has the potential for
allowing rapid large-scale functional analysis of cDNA libraries and can also be applied
to plants that are not currently amenable to VIGS technology by conventional inoculation
methods.

9.7.5 Activation tagging

Activation tagging is an established method for the generation of dominant gain-of-
function mutants in plants (Weigel et al., 2000). In contrast to T-DNA insertions that are
designed to interrupt or interfere with gene expression, activation tagging is suitable for
heterozygous, polyploidy crops such as potato, as gene activation can result in dominant
phenotypes, thus offering possibilities for mutagenesis in potato. As cultivated potato
is tetraploid and most potato diploids are either self-incompatible or relatively infertile,
recessive mutants have been traditionally difficult to generate. In activation tagging,
strong promoters, such as the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, are transformed into
the plant genome by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Insertion of these strong
promoters activates genes adjacent to the promoter resulting in overexpression of the
genes and phenotypic expression of a gain-of-function mutant for that gene. Based on
the phenotypic identification of an activation-tagged line, the corresponding gene can
be isolated by standard PCR techniques because of the presence of a known sequence
within the activation construct. The CPGP had an original objective of establishing 10 000
activation-tagged lines in potato using the variety cultivar Bintje, and this ambitious goal
required these researchers to establish a highly efficient genetic transformation system
giving stable integration of the gene construct used (Gustafson et al., 2006). It is not
clear whether, at the time of writing, these activities have generated a useful resource that
will be taken up by the potato community. The large number of clones generated require
clonal propagation and may be subject to prohibitive plant health regulations on import
to other countries.

Genomics

9.8 TOWARDS A GENOME-WIDE PHYSICAL MAP AND A POTATO

GENOME SEQUENCE

The UHD genetic map of potato (van Os et al., 2006) forms the framework for the
construction of a genome-wide physical map of the potato genome. Physical map con-
struction is being carried out in two phases. First, a BAC library from the diploid breeding
clone RH89-039-16 (RH), comprising approximately 73 000 clones, has been finger-
printed using a non-selective AFLP-based method. The fingerprint data have been used
to assemble the RH BACs into 7134 BAC contigs, with 7580 ‘singletons’ (i.e. single
BAC clones) remaining. The second phase entails anchoring of the contigs and sin-
gle BACs to the UHD map using a BAC pooling method, which should also reduce
the number of contigs and increase the average contig size. Subsequent contiging will
use a reduced stringency alignment approach that will reduce the number of contigs
still further. At present, it is envisaged that the integrated genetic and physical map
that will result from these activities will be the platform used for obtaining the DNA
sequence of the potato genome, as proposed by the Potato Genome Sequencing Consor-
tium (http://www.genomics.nl/homepage/research/funding_opportunities/pgsc/). In com-
mon with the ongoing tomato sequencing project, this recent development will have huge
implications for all those working in the area of potato genetics and genomics, although
it will make the need for functional genomic tools even more apparent.

9.9 PROTEOMICS AND METABOLOMICS

The sciences known as proteomics and metabolomics are now widely established in
plants. Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins, particularly their structures and
functions. Metabolomics is the systematic study of small-molecule metabolite profiles,
without bias towards a specific metabolite or group of metabolites. These activities have
led to the coining of the terms ‘proteome’ and ‘metabolome’ to define the collections
of all proteins and metabolites in a biological organism, which are the end products of
gene expression. Metabolic profiling can be used to obtain an instantaneous ‘snapshot’ of
the physiology of a particular tissue or cell type. One of the major challenges facing the
emerging science of plant systems biology is to integrate proteomics, transcriptomics and
metabolomics information to obtain a more complete picture of the biology of plants.

Space does not permit a detailed discussion of the different analytical methods used
for these disciplines. Proteomics is heavily dependent on electrophoretic separation of
proteins, in either one or two dimensions. It could be argued that biochemists have been
engaged in metabolomics for the latter part of the 20th century, and the new technologies
are based on pre-existing biochemical techniques. There are two major issues to be
addressed for metabolite analysis: separation of the analytes (usually by chromatography
or electrophoresis) and detection of the analytes [usually by mass spectrometry (MS)].
Gas chromatography (GC) allied to MS is one of the most widely used and powerful
methods.

In plants, these technologies, notably metabolic profiling, have started to make a
significant impact of our understanding of plant cellular processes particularly in the

198

Bryan

model Arabidopsis (Fiehn et al., 2000). These authors were able to detect over 300
metabolites in leaf tissue and showed that the differences among profiles of distinct
ecotypes were greater than those between ecotypes and their derived mutant lines. In
potato, a lot of effort has been focused on the analysis of tuber metabolites, an obvious
target given its economic importance and its well-studied biochemistry.

Roessner et al. (2000) have pioneered the use of GC coupled to MS to quantitatively
and qualitatively detect more than 150 compounds within potato tubers. It is important to
stress that this type of approach is a relatively unbiased ‘open’ technology, which permits
the detection of unpredicted changes in levels of metabolites. The method was found to
be highly reproducible, and biological variability exceeded experimental error by a factor
of up to 10. Moreover, the method is suitable for high-throughput analysis. This method
has been applied to soil- and in vitro-grown tubers. Owing to the simultaneous analysis
of a wide range of metabolites, it was immediately apparent that these systems differ
significantly in their metabolism, and it was possible to draw conclusions about the under-
lying physiological differences between both tuber systems. Transgenic lines modified in
sucrose catabolism or starch synthesis were also analysed, and some unexpected changes
in disaccharides and sugar alcohols were observed. In a similar vein, Lehesranta et al.
(2005) have compared the proteomes of potato cultivars, landraces and transgenic lines.
Over 90% of more than 1100 proteins examined show statistically significant variation
across cultivars and landraces. However, a very small proportion (9 of 730) showed sig-
nificant differences between genetically modified (GM) lines and controls. These authors
accept the limitations of the 2-DE (dimensional electrophoresis) method used and suggest
the need for combined application of transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics to
resolve biological questions and to monitor food safety.

Metabolite profiling is essentially a very detailed phenotypic analysis performed at
the chemical level. A systems biology approach to biological questions is being advo-
cated, whereby studies in which the molecules described by transcriptomic, proteomic
and metabolomic approaches are being analysed in parallel. For example, Urbanczyk-
Wochniak et al. (2003) compared the discriminatory power of metabolic and RNA profil-
ing to distinguish between different potato tuber systems, and they suggest that metabolic
profiling has a higher resolution than expression profiling. Moreover, these authors found
that about 2% of the approximately 27 000 possible transcript–metabolite pairs showed
strong correlations, and most of these involved nutritionally important metabolites. This
exciting observation suggests a route to the rapid identification of candidate genes for
modifying the metabolite content of potato and other biological systems.

In another study, Roessner et al. (2001) examined four distinct potato clones modified
in various aspects of sucrose metabolism for the presence of hydrophilic metabolites.
A combination of clustering and ordination analyses was used to assign clusters to
the individual plant systems and to determine relative distances between these clusters.
Extraction analysis and correlation analysis allowed identification of the most important
metabolic components of the observed clusters and, perhaps more significantly, revealed
close linkages between a broad spectrum of metabolites. These authors also compared their
data with metabolite profiles from environmentally manipulated and transgenic potato
plants, concluding that certain growth conditions can ‘phenocopy’ genetic modifications.
This area has been reviewed extensively (Roessner et al., 2002; Stitt and Fernie, 2003).

Genomics

199

These and other authors compare current methodologies for metabolic profiling in plants,
highlighting the strategies for biochemical phenotyping of plants by determining the
steady-state concentrations of a broad spectrum of metabolites. A primary objective is to
assimilate the huge amount of information gained from metabolite profiling into a useful,
accessible body of knowledge for the research community. Very recently, the main groups
working on the potato metabolome have expressed the need to examine metabolic flux
to augment steady-state metabolite analysis and expression profiling (Fernie et al., 2005)
in the growing field of plant functional genomics.

9.10 GENOMIC DATABASES

During the early to mid-1990s, crop plant genetics and associated bioinformatic activities
really took off. It very quickly became evident that Web-based publicly accessible
databases representing repositories of genetic information would be very useful tools
for the respective research communities. SolGenes along with GrainGenes and Rice-
Genes were some of the first plant genome databases based on the ACeDB software.
SolGenes was Solanaceae-wide in scope, and its core consisted of genetic maps of the
various species, stored and displayed in ways that allowed for ready cross-referencing.
The maps included were mostly RFLP maps of potato,
tomato and pepper. This
database became defunct in 2002 and has largely been replaced by the Solanaceous
Genome Network (SGN), which remains heavily biased towards the interests of the
tomato research community (http://www.sgn.cornell.edu). A database for potato genetic
data (PoMaMo, Potato Maps and More) has recently been established (Meyer et al.,
2005). PoMaMo contains information on molecular maps, DNA sequences and puta-
tive gene functions, results from BLAST analysis, SNP and InDel information from
potato germ plasm and publication references and links to other public databases
such as GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/) or SGN. PoMaMo has several search
and data visualization tools that facilitate easy access to the data via the internet
(https://gabi.rzpd.de/PoMaMo.html). Chromosome maps can be displayed interactively
by clicking on an element of interest. The ‘GreenCards’ interface allows a text-based
data search by marker, sequence or genotype name and by sequence accession number,
gene function, BLAST Hit or publication reference. The PoMaMo database is a com-
prehensive database for different types of potato genome data, and it is hoped that users
will contribute further to this database in the future to allow it to become the key Web
resource for potato geneticists and breeders. However, with the availability of vast EST
resources, and the imminent generation of a full genome sequence, the potato research
community will be required to make joint decisions about future database resources for
the curation of this information.

9.11 SUMMARY

Potato has been considered the ‘poor relative’ in relation to other major crop plants in the
availability of genetic and genomic resources. Early genetic and genomic studies in the

200

Bryan

Solanaceae were heavily biased towards tomato, rightly viewed as a model species for the
Solanaceae, despite a similar genome size to potato. The potato research community has
seen the rapid development of extensive genomic resources and tools. Map-based gene
isolation projects have led to the development of several large-insert genomic libraries
for diploid and tetraploid cultivated potato and a few key wild relatives. The development
of large potato EST collections and microarray platforms has mirrored the generation of
similar resources for tomato, leading to a wealth of gene sequence data for the Solanaceae
research community. A global potato physical mapping strategy has been put into place
and will serve as a template for a potato genome sequence. Given the advanced state
of tuber biology and biochemistry, some newer technologies, notably expression and
metabolic profiling, have started to have a deep impact on our understanding of potato
biology.

10.1 INTRODUCTION

Common potato, Solanum tuberosum, belongs to the section Petota, which is subdivided
into 21 series with 228 wild and 7 cultivated species (Hawkes, 1994). According to
the latest view, the section contains 199 wild and 1 cultivated species (Spooner and
Hijmans, 2001; Huamán and Spooner, 2002; Chapter 4, van den Berg and Jacobs,
this volume). Cytogenetic research helped to create the genome concept of wild and
cultivated potato species (reviewed by Matsubayashi, 1991), to study haploid production
and to use haploids in genetics and breeding (reviewed by Peloquin et al., 1991), to
monitor the chromosome status of hybrid material (reviewed by Hermsen, 1994) and to
investigate chromosome instability (reviewed by Wilkinson, 1994). This chapter surveys
the application of cytogenetic methods for the investigation of genomic, evolutionary
and species relationships, the integration of genetic and cytological maps, the analysis
of genome structure and the detection of introgressions of alien chromatin. Besides
traditional cytogenetic methods, the potential of new molecular techniques is considered.

10.2 BASIC CHROMOSOME NUMBER AND POLYPLOID COMPLEXES

Determination of chromosome number for S. tuberosum was the beginning of cytogenetic
studies of potato. The haploid chromosome number (cid:2)n = 24(cid:3) was established for the first
time by Kihara (1924). Later, the somatic chromosome number (cid:2)2n= 48(cid:3) was provided by
Stow (1926) for varieties of the common potato. Approximately at the same time, the first
indications of the existence of different ploidy levels in the wild potatoes were provided
by investigators studying meiosis in pollen mother cells of Solanum chacoense, Solanum
jamesii, Solanum fendleri, Solanum × edinense and Solanum demissum (Salaman, 1926;
Smith, 1927; Vilmorin and Simonet, 1927). Rybin (1929, 1933) first described the whole
polyploid series in wild potatoes (2x-3x-4x-5x-6x) and established an entire polyploid
series in cultivated species (2x-3x-4x-5x). Rybin (1929) proposed to use differences in
ploidy level for taxonomic classification of cultivated potatoes. All species of the section
Petota have the same basic chromosome number (cid:2)x = 12(cid:3). Of the potato species with
known chromosome number, 73% are classified as diploid (cid:2)2n = 2x = 24(cid:3), 4% triploid
(cid:2)2n = 3x = 36(cid:3), 15% tetraploid (cid:2)2n = 4x = 48(cid:3), 2% pentaploid (cid:2)2n = 5x = 60(cid:3) and 6%
hexaploid (cid:2)2n = 6x = 72(cid:3) (Hawkes, 1990).

Two major mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of polyploidy:
chromosome doubling of somatic cells and formation of unreduced gametes (sexual poly-
ploidization). Harlan and De Wet (1975) argued that almost all polyploids in nature have
originated through sexual polyploidization. This is particularly true for the species of the
section Petota, many of which often form both 2n pollen and 2n eggs (Watanabe and
Peloquin, 1991). 2n gametes provide opportunities for gene flow between species with
different ploidy levels and/or different endosperm balance numbers (EBNs) (Den Nijs
and Peloquin, 1977). Thus, in addition to causing polyploidization, the ability to form
2n gametes also facilitated interspecific hybridization, which has played an important
role in the evolution of wild and cultivated potatoes and in the formation of polyploid
complexes in the section Petota. There are two major types of polyploids: autopolyploids,
which received their homeologous set of chromosomes from one species, and allopoly-
ploids, which received their homeologous set of chromosomes from different species.
Determination of the type of polyploidy for species in the section Petota has been based
mainly on the analysis of chromosome pairing in species and their hybrids. In general,
strict allotetraploid and allohexaploid species show regular meiosis with bivalent chro-
mosome pairing and extremely low frequency of multivalents. Triploid, pentaploid and
autotetraploid species show high frequency of multivalents at metaphase I (MI), irregular
meiosis and sterility or very low level of fertility. These species are maintained mainly
by vegetative propagation. Some of the polyploids are classified as segmental allopoly-
ploids; they are characterized by ‘intermediate’ frequencies of multivalents – lower than
in autopolyploids and higher than in strict allopolyploids of corresponding ploidy levels.

10.3 GENOME AND SPECIES RELATIONSHIPS

The genome concept has been developed for potato species based on the crossability
rate in interspecific combinations, hybrid viability, pollen fertility and the degree of
chromosomal homology (Marks, 1955, 1965; Hawkes, 1958; Irikura, 1976; Ramanna
and Hermsen, 1981; Hawkes, 1990; Lopez and Hawkes, 1991; Matsubayashi, 1991).
Chromosome-pairing relationships in interspecific hybrids and in polyploid species have
been interpreted by genome formulas, although authors gave them different symbols. In
the last most of the authors agree on the genome hypothesis of Matsubayashi (1991).
According to this hypothesis, five genomes (A, B, C, D and P) are recognized in tuber-
bearing species of the section Petota. A genome E (Ramanna and Hermsen, 1981) is
recognized in non-tuber-bearing species of the closely related section Etuberosum.

10.3.1 Genomic designation and relationships of diploid potato species

According to Matsubayashi (1991), all diploid tuber-bearing species growing under
extremely diverse climatic conditions and exhibiting a wide range of morphological differ-
ences comprise one major genomic group A. No diploid species have ever been identified
with B, C, D and P genomes. The basic genome A was proposed for diploid species
of the four series, Tuberosa, Commersoniana, Cuneoalata and Megistacroloba, which
all have identical (or very similar) genome(s). As reviewed by Matsubayashi (1991),

Potato Cytogenetics

hybrids between diploid species with the AA genome show 12 bivalents at MI, regular
meiosis and fertile pollen. Diploid hybrids between species having the A genome and the
other diploid potatoes show more or less reduced pollen fertility, and their amphidiploids
are characterized by preferential pairing (reviewed by Matsubayashi, 1991). It was
hypothesized that genomic variants of diploid potatoes of the Bulbocastana, Ingifolia,
Conicibaccata, Morelliformia, Pinnatisecta, Piurana and Polyadenia series differ from
the basic A genome by cryptic structural differences and that genomic variants of
diploid species of the Olmosiana series and Solanum rachialatum (Ingifolia series) differ
from other variants of the A genome by definite structural differences (Matsubayashi,
1991). The genomic variants of diploid species belonging to the above-mentioned eight
series were designated by Matsubayashi (1991) as genome formula A with superscripts
corresponding to each taxonomical series. Dvoˇrák (1983) gave another explanation of
differential affinity between the genomic variants of diploid potato species. He suggested
that rapid evolution of non-coding sequences caused the differentiation of genomes of
diploid tuber-bearing species.

10.3.2 Genomic nature and relationships in polyploid potato species

Relatively few polyploid members of the section Petota have been identified that appear
to be autopolyploids. Multiple cytotypes (‘cytotype’ – any variety of a species whose
chromosome complement differs quantitatively or qualitatively from the standard com-
plement of the species; Rieger et al., 1991) of diploid species may be of autopolyploid
origin. Triploid and tetraploid cytotypes are known for many typically diploid potato
species (Hawkes, 1990). Triploid cytotypes derive from the union of unreduced (cid:2)2n(cid:3) and
normal (cid:2)n(cid:3) gametes of the same diploid species, and tetraploid cytotypes can be produced
by the fertilization of 2n egg cells with 2n pollen of a diploid species. Autotriploids
should have a high frequency of trivalents at MI. Indeed, Sanuda Palazuelos (1962)
observed up to eight trivalents in a triploid cytotype (cid:2)2n = 36(cid:3) of Solanum cardiophyllum,
which is similar to the 8.4–10.3 trivalents per cell formed at MI in synthetic autotriploids
(Irikura, 1976).
Among even-level polyploid potato species, multivalents occur very rarely. The fre-
quency of multivalents at MI in S. tuberosum (cid:2)2n = 4x = 48(cid:3) ranging from 1.5 to 5.2
(Matsubayashi, 1991) is much higher than in other tetraploid species but lower than
in synthetic autotetraploids. Chromosomes of S. tuberosum pair, recombine and segre-
gate randomly as common potato displays tetrasomic inheritance ratios (Bradshaw and
Mackay, 1994). Thus, S. tuberosum is one of the exceptional examples of a polysomic
polyploid (autotetraploid – AAAA genome) in the section Petota. Both regular bivalent
pairing and univalents at MI were quite frequently observed in dihaploids (‘dihaploid’ –
an individual produced from a tetraploid form, which possesses half the tetraploid number
of chromosomes; Rieger et al., 1991) of common potato. Unpaired segments in biva-
lents of some dihaploids have been reported (Matsubayashi, 1991). Therefore, segmental
allotetraploidy and the genome formula AAAtAt were proposed by Matsubayashi (1991)
for common potato. One possible explanation for the disagreements about the polyploid
nature of S. tuberosum is the introgression of germplasm of wild and cultivated species
into Andigena and Chilean landraces and into varieties of common potato.

Gavrilenko

Hawkes (1990) hypothesized that about 12% of potato species have a hybrid origin.
Allopolyploids can originate from spontaneous interploid crosses between species pos-
sessing the same EBN or spontaneous crosses between species with functional 2n gametes
and different EBNs or crosses between diploid species with the same EBN and mitotic
polyploidization following the hybridization event or fertilization between 2n male and
female gametes of two diploid species. For instance, the triploid species S(cid:4)× vallis-mexici
is a natural hybrid between Solanum stoloniferum (cid:2)2n = 48(cid:5) EBN = 2(cid:3) and Solanum ver-
rucosum (cid:2)2n = 24(cid:5) EBN = 2(cid:3) (Marks, 1958). The pentaploid species Solanum curtilobum
derived from the fusion of an unreduced (3x) gamete of Solanum juzepczukii and a normal
(2x) gamete of Solanum andigenum ssp. andigena (Hawkes, 1962).

Segmental allopolyploidy has been proposed for polyploids of the series Tuberosa,
S. chaucha (cid:2)AAAt(cid:3), S. juzepczukii (cid:2)AAAa(cid:3), S. curtilobum (cid:2)AAAAaAt(cid:3) and S. sucrense
(cid:2)AAAsAs(cid:3), and for the wild species Solanum acaule of the Acaulia series (cid:2)AAAaAa(cid:3)
by comparing the frequency of multivalent formation at MI in the species and their
haploids or hybrids (Matsubayashi, 1991). We also suppose segmental polyploidy for
the tetraploid species Solanum tuguerrense of the Piurana series, although Matsubayashi
(1991) considered it as a strict allotetraploid (cid:2)ApApPP(cid:3). However, the observation of
a high frequency of trivalents at MI (4.5 trivalents +7(cid:4)5 bivalents +7(cid:4)5 univalents per
cell) in triploid hybrids (cid:2)AApP(cid:3) of S. tuguerrense with S. verrucosum (AA) (Marks,
1965) indicates partial homology of the Ap and P genomes. For comparison, in triploid
hybrids (cid:2)AAAa(cid:3) between the segmental allotetraploid S. acaule and several diploid
A-genome species, the frequency of trivalents at MI ranged from 3.0 to 6.5 (Propach,
1937; Swaminathan and Howard, 1953; Irikura, 1976).

Wild polyploid species of the series Longipedicellata, Conicibaccata and Demissa are
considered as strict allopolyploids (disomic polyploids) based on the results of meiotic
studies that showed regular bivalent pairing (Marks, 1955, 1965; Hawkes, 1958; Irikura,
1976; Lopez and Hawkes, 1991; Matsubayashi, 1991). According to Dvoˇrák (1983),
bivalent chromosomal pairing in allopolyploid potato species can be explained by genet-
ically controlled regulatory mechanisms preventing intergenomic pairing. However, no
convincing data confirming this hypothesis have ever been obtained.

All authors agree that strict allopolyploids share one common component genome,
which is highly homologous to the A genome of diploid potato species (Marks, 1965;
Irikura, 1976; Matsubayashi, 1991). Based on the analysis of chromosome pairing in
hybrids, the diploid species S. verrucosum (AA) was suggested as the putative contributor
of the common A genome of natural allopolyploids (Marks, 1965). A common origin
of S. verrucosum and Mexican polyploid species was supported by the similarity of
their cpDNA (Spooner and Sytsma, 1992) and by geographical and morphological data.
Amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) results also support a close relationship
between S. verrucosum and members of the Longipedicellata, Demissa and Acaulia series
(Kardolus, 1998).

All authors also agree that strict allopolyploids differ from one another by their sec-
ond component genome (Marks, 1965; Irikura, 1976; Matsubayashi, 1991). According to
Irikura (1976), allopolyploid species differ from one another by the genomic variants of
a merged B genome. Thus, genome designation AABsBs was proposed for allotetraploid
species of the Longipedicellata series, AABsBsBdBd for allohexaploid species of the

Potato Cytogenetics

207

Demissa series and AABaBa for segmental allotetraploid species S. acaule (Irikura, 1976).
According to the genome hypothesis of Matsubayashi (1991), strict allopolyploid species
differ from one another by their second specific distinct component genomes B, C, P
and D. The B component genome has been recognized in the allopolyploid species of
the Longipedicellata series (AABB). Genome C has been recognized in the allotetraploid
species of the Conicibaccata series (cid:2)AcAcC(cid:2)C(cid:2)(cid:3), genome P in the allotetraploid species
of the Piurana series and D genomes in the allohexaploid species of the Demissa series
(cid:2)AADDD(cid:2)D(cid:2)(cid:3) (Matsubayashi, 1991). A more complex genome composition has been
proposed for allohexaploid species of the Conicibaccata and Acaulia series. It was sug-
gested that Solanum moscopanum (cid:2)2n = 6x(cid:3) contains a genome of Solanum colombianum
(cid:2)AcAcC(cid:2)C(cid:2)(cid:3) and an additional, distinct MM genome of unknown diploid species origin
(Lopez and Hawkes, 1991). Solanum albicans contains a genome of S. acaule and an
additional, distinct XX genome of unknown origin (Hawkes, 1963; Matsubayashi, 1991).
Nuclear restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) data confirm that S. acaule
(cid:2)AAAaAa(cid:3) is an ancestor of S. albicans (Nakagawa and Hosaka, 2002).

Hawkes (1990) hypothesized that the B genome was a ‘primitive’ indigenous genome
from Mexico. Irikura (1976) considered S. cardiophyllum as a possible donor of the sec-
ond merged B genome in natural allopolyploids (Irikura, 1976). However, no experimen-
tal evidence was provided. Most authors agree that the origin of the second component
genomes of natural allopolyploids is still unknown. It is unlikely that all diploid progenitors
of the Aa, B, C and D genomes disappeared. It is possible that the Aa, B and D genomes
were derived from a common ancestor and were then modified during the speciation of
allopolyploids. This assumption is supported by molecular data that cluster the Aa, B and
D genome-containing species (Kardolus, 1998; Nakagawa and Hosaka, 2002). The meiotic
behaviour in hybrids also indicates similarity between the Aa, one of the D genomes and the
B genomes. For instance, the high frequency of bivalents (5.3 univalents + 24(cid:4)4 bivalents
+ 0(cid:4)7 trivalents + 0(cid:4)9 quadrivalents; Bains, 1951) in a pentaploid hybrid (cid:2)AAAaDDd(cid:3)
of S. demissum (cid:2)AADDDdDd(cid:3) with S. acaule (cid:2)AAAaAa(cid:3) indicates that parental species
share two common genomes. Meiotic configurations (15–17 univalents + 20–21 biva-
lents + 1 trivalent) in pentaploid hybrids (cid:2)AABDDd(cid:3) of S. demissum (cid:2)AADDDdDd(cid:3) and S.
stoloniferum (AABB) mean that bivalents are formed between the two A genomes and that
most chromosomes of the B genome and one of the D genomes are paired. To reflect the
close relationships between S. demissum and members of the Acaulia and Longipedicellata
series, Kardolus (1998) proposed the new genome formula AAAaAaBdBd for S. demissum.
During the evolution of natural allopolyploids, the second component genome could be
significantly modified compared with the original ancestral genome donor. The hypothesis
of Zohary and Feldman (1962) suggested different rates of parental genome modifica-
tion in allopolyploid species. According to this hypothesis, one subgenome of natural
allopolyploids remains stable and very close to the ancestral genome, whereas the second
subgenome is modified relative to its progenitor because of introgressive hybridization.
It might be suggested that in potato allopolyploids the A subgenome is stable and the
second component genome was significantly modified. For instance, hybrids (genome
AAAaB) between S. acaule and species of the Longipedicellata series are characterized
by a high multivalent frequency (0.8–1.3 quadrivalents + 2.2–3.4 trivalents + 14.2–15.8

208

Gavrilenko

bivalents + 6.1–4.5 univalents; Matsubayashi, 1991) that probably could reflect structural
chromosomal changes accumulated in the Aa and B subgenomes.

It should be mentioned that some cytogenetic studies lack important information either
due to limitations associated with the use of single genotype crosses, a single hybrid
clone and a single accession of a polyploid species or due to an insufficient number of
meiotic cells analysed. Chromosomal configurations were analysed at MI, whereas a true
reflection of pairing has to be observed at the pachytene or zygotene stages. Meiotic studies
have been performed by conventional methods with limited power to definitely interpret
genome affinity in allopolyploids due to the inability to distinguish intergenomic and
intragenomic pairing. Besides, the type of meiotic configurations (bivalents, trivalents or
quadrivalents) alone is not a sufficient indicator for determining the nature of polyploidy.
Predominantly, bivalent chromosome pairing has been described for several autopolyploid
species with tetrasomic inheritance (Crawford and Smith, 1984; Samuel et al., 1990). In
such cases, natural pressure for high fertility could select mutations in pairing control
genes and result in change from random to preferential pairing in autopolyploids. Studies
of inheritance patterns of molecular markers would provide more information about the
polysomic or disomic inheritance type of polyploids. Obviously, the existing genome
concepts of polyploid species of the section Petota need to be developed by further
studies.

10.3.3 Genomic designation and relationships of potato and non-tuber-bearing

species from closely related sections Etuberosum, Juglandifolium and
Lycopersicum

All species of the section Petota and the closest non-tuber-bearing relatives from sections
Etuberosum, Juglandifolium and Lycopersicum (Spooner et al., 1993) have the same basic
chromosome number (cid:2)x = 12(cid:3) and similar karyotype morphology. Genome symbol E
was given to the species of the section Etuberosum based on the specificity of meiotic
behaviour and sterility of their diploid hybrids with A-genome tuber-bearing potato species
(Ramanna and Hermsen, 1979, 1981). The distinct genome symbol S has been postulated
for Solanum sitiens and Solanum lycopersicoides of the section Juglandifolium based
on the differences detected among genetic maps of these species and tomato (Pertuze
et al., 2002). Symbol L was proposed for tomato (section Lycopersicum) on the basis of
preferential chromosome pairing and clear-cut parental genome discrimination by using
genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) in amphidiploids of the LLEE type between tomato
and Solanum etuberosum (Gavrilenko et al., 2001).

The results of comparative mapping studies revealed a high level of conservation
of most linkage groups of the A, L, S and E genomes as well as genetically detected
inversions, translocations and transpositions (Tanksley et al., 1992; Perez et al., 1999;
Pertuze et al., 2002).

These results indicate that S- and L-genome species are most closely related and
characterized by the lowest genome differentiation. Differentiation between L and A
genomes is more profound, and the E genome is the most divergent within these taxa
indicating distinctiveness of the section Etuberosum.

10.4 KARYOTYPING OF POTATO SPECIES

Potato is not an ideal species for cytogenetic research. Small somatic metaphase chro-
mosomes of S. tuberosum ranging in length from 1.0 to 3(cid:4)5 (cid:6)m (Dong et al., 2000) are
critical for identification. Low level of karyotype divergence among potato species as
well as of those from the closely related sections complicates the application of tradi-
tional cytogenetic approaches to the analysis of introgression. Another disadvantage of
cytogenetic research in potato is the absence of aneuploid stocks such as monosomic
and nullisomic lines and lack of well-characterized structural chromosome mutants with
translocations, inversions or deletions, which are routinely employed in other species for
assigning linkage groups to individual chromosomes or for locating genes on specific
chromosomes.

The first attempts to identify specific somatic chromosomes of potato stained with
DNA-binding dyes such as aceto-carmine were based on the analysis of chromosome
length, centromere position and the presence of secondary constrictions (Shepeleva, 1937;
Lamm, 1945; Swaminathan, 1954). However, the small size and slight differences in
morphology did not allow to distinguish precisely specific metaphase chromosomes. The
distribution of highly repetitive DNA sequence on potato chromosomes was studied using
Giemsa C-banding techniques with the aim to distinguish specific chromosomes (Mok
et al., 1974; Lee and Hanneman, 1976; Pijnacker and Ferwerda, 1984). Even though
significant progress has been made in the identification of Giemsa-stained chromosomes,
difficulties persisted in the discrimination among chromosomes with similar morphology
and similar C-banding patterns.

The pachytene chromosome complement was described for several diploid species
and dihaploid clones of common potato (Haynes, 1964; Yeh and Peloquin, 1965; Marks,
1969; Ramanna and Wagenvoort, 1976; Wagenvoort, 1988). Potato chromosomes at
pachytene show dark staining heterochromatin in pericentromeric regions and light
staining euchromatin in terminal regions. These staining patterns together with other
chromosomal landmarks such as position of centromeres, heterochromatin knobs and the
size of telomeres allow to distinguish each of the 12 potato chromosomes. However,
wide application of pachytene karyotyping was limited in cytogenetic research of potato
because this method is elaborate and time consuming, and it can be applied only to diploid
clones with excellent quality of chromosomal preparations.

10.4.1 Fluorescent in situ hybridization-based cytogenetic mapping

Development of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques for plant species
provided new opportunities for the characterization of the potato genome, including
chromosome identification and analysis of genome structure. The use of FISH with
genomic DNA cloned in large-insert vectors such as bacterial artificial chromosomes
(BACs), called BAC-FISH, has been an effective approach in mapping small probes
containing only a few kilobases of DNA to physical chromosomes (Jiang et al., 1995).
This approach has been used by Jiang and colleagues for correlating specific chromosomes
with molecular linkage groups of potato. BACs with large genomic DNA insertions of
the wild diploid species Solanum bulbocastanum were screened using mapped RFLP

210

Gavrilenko

markers (Song et al., 2000). RFLP marker-specific BAC clones were labelled as FISH
probes that were successfully applied to identify each of the 12 somatic metaphase
chromosomes of potato (Dong et al., 2000; Fig. 10.1A). As a result, a larger set of new,
chromosome-specific cytogenetic DNA markers (CSCDMs) was established for potato
karyotyping to integrate the genetic and cytological maps of potato. This system has
the following methodical advantages: CSCDMs clearly discriminate between different
chromosomes with similar morphology, CSCDMs can be applied to polyploids with larger

chromosome numbers and the quality of chromosome preparations is not so important
(Dong et al., 2000).

Visser et al. (1988) were the first to apply in situ hybridization techniques using
radioactively labelled repetitive DNA sequences to study genome organization of potato.
In further studies, FISH has been used to characterize the distribution of different types
of repetitive sequences. Simultaneous hybridization of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) probes
with CSCDMs, each labelled with a different fluorochrome, has resulted in mapping two
large functionally important families of rDNA sequences of potato (Dong et al., 2000).
5S rDNA genes were located at a single locus near the centromere on the short arm of
chromosome 1 (Dong et al., 2000; Fig. 10.1B). A similar location of a single 5S rDNA
locus has been detected in tomato using FISH and pachytene analysis (Xu and Earle,
1996a). Only one 5S rDNA locus was found in the S-genome species of the section
Juglandifolium (Ji et al., 2004). Therefore, no polymorphisms were detected in the number
of 5S rDNA loci among the A, L and S genomes.

One major 45S rDNA locus containing 18S-5,8S-26S rRNA genes was found in the
nucleolus organizer region (NOR) on the short arm of chromosome 2 in the A, L and
S genomes (Fig. 10.1C). Variation in a genome-specific manner was only detected in
the number and distribution patterns of minor 45S rDNA loci. Pachytene karyotyping of
tomato in combination with FISH revealed four minor 45S rDNA loci that were located
in the heterochromatic regions on four chromosomes of the L genome (2L, 6L, 9S and
11S arms) (Xu and Earle, 1996b). In the chromosome complements of the S-genome
species, only one minor 45S rDNA locus was detected on chromosomes other than the
nucleolar chromosome (Ji et al., 2004). No minor 45S rDNA loci have been reported for
the A genome of potato (Dong et al., 2000).

Using FISH, tandemly repeated DNA elements that are highly homologous to the
intergenic spacer (IGS) of the 18S–25S rDNA sequence of potato were located at distinct
loci in a pericentromeric heterochromatic region on a single (not nucleolar) chromosome
of S. tuberosum (Stupar et al., 2002). In S. bulbocastanum, the same repeated DNA
elements were located close to centromeres and distributed on four different chromosomes
(Stupar et al., 2002). The other classes of tandem repeats – interstitial telomeric repeats
(ITRs) – have been located using FISH in highly condensed centromeric regions of two
to seven different chromosomes in several Solanum species, and the number of the FISH
signals did not correspond to species ploidy level (Tek and Jiang, 2004). The results of
FISH on extended DNA fibres revealed that these ITRs are organized in long tandem
clusters, suggesting extensive amplification of the ITRs during divergence of potato
species (Tek and Jiang, 2004). Both IGS-related repeats and ITRs are highly diverged
among a wide range of Solanum species indicating their dynamic nature (Stupar et al.,
2002; Tek and Jiang, 2004). These results indicate that genome differentiation of the
structurally similar, A-genome diploid potatoes might be due to divergence in nucleotide
sequences and amplification of different classes of highly repetitive DNA.

Fluorescent

in situ hybridization with tandemly repeated, species-specific DNA
sequences can be used for comparative karyotyping and for studying introgression. For
instance, the pSB1 and pSB7 repeats specific to the E-genome species of the Etuberosum
section were located mostly in the telomeric and in some centromeric and interstitial
areas of the Solanum brevidens chromosomes, but not in the S. tuberosum chromosomal

212

Gavrilenko

complement. Whereas the potato clone pST3 showed signals in telomeric regions of a
few chromosomes of S. tuberosum, this signal was not detected in S. brevidens (Rokka
et al., 1998a). Moreover, FISH with S. brevidens-specific sequences helped to clarify the
genomic composition of hybrids between potato and S. brevidens (Rokka et al., 1998b).
Genomic in situ hybridization, based on the use of total genomic DNA as probe, has
been developed by Schwarzacher et al. (1989) to identify chromosomes and chromosomal
segments of different origin. The ability to discriminate chromatin of different genomes
depends on the degree of sequence homology and stringency conditions in the GISH
experiments. The standard GISH protocol allows to distinguish genomes sharing 80–85%
or less sequence homology (Schwarzacher et al., 1989). Using standard GISH protocols,
parental chromosomes were discriminated in wide hybrids between distantly related
Solanum species belonging to different sections, such as Petota (potato) and Lycopersicum
(tomato) (Garriga-Calderé et al., 1997), Petota (potato) and Etuberosum (S. etuberosum
and S. brevidens) (Dong et al., 1999, 2001; Gavrilenko et al., 2002, 2003), Petota (potato)
and Solanum (Solanum nigrum) (Horsman et al., 2001), Etuberosum (S. etuberosum)
and Lycopersicum (tomato) (Gavrilenko et al., 2001), Juglandifolium (S. lycopersicoides
and S. sitiens) and Lycopersicum (tomato) (Ji et al., 2004). Because the A, E, L and S
genomes in wide hybrids can be easily discriminated using standard GISH protocols, these
genomes are supposed to have a high level of divergence in their dispersed repetitive DNA
sequences. Chromosomes of closely related genomes sharing up to 90–95% sequence
homology can be discriminated under higher stringency conditions in combination with an
excess of unlabelled blocking DNA in the hybridization mixture (Parokonny et al., 1997).
Application of such modified GISH protocols allowed to discriminate chromosomes of
closely related parental species belonging to the same section – Lycopersicum (Parokonny
et al., 1997) or Juglandifolium (Ji et al., 2004).

Genomic in situ hybridization was successfully used to establish genome composi-
tion of wide hybrids and their derivatives (Fig. 10.1E and F), to discriminate between
intergenomic and intragenomic pairing in the genomes of wide hybrids (Garriga-Calderé
et al., 1999; Gavrilenko et al., 2001; Ji et al., 2004), to study the specificity of genome
interactions such as preferential elimination of chromosomes of one parental genome
(Garriga-Calderé et al., 1997; Gavrilenko et al., 2001) and to determine intergenomic
translocations (Garriga-Calderé et al., 1997; Dong et al., 2001).

Despite the effectiveness of GISH in detecting chromatin of different origin, GISH
alone cannot determine genetic identity of alien chromosomes. Sequential GISH and
FISH with CSCDMs performed on the same chromosome preparations made it possible
to identify precisely specific homeologous chromosomes of the E and A genomes in
breeding lines derived from potato (cid:2)+(cid:3) S. brevidens hybrids (Dong et al., 2001, 2005; Tek
et al., 2004). Combination of GISH and FISH with CSCDMs also allowed to determine
the specificity of chromosomal re-arrangements (Dong et al., 2001).

10.5 CYTOGENETICS IN POTATO IMPROVEMENT

Wild potato species have been recognized as an important source of useful genes for
resistance to pathogens and abiotic stresses (Hawkes, 1994). These gene pools are useful

Potato Cytogenetics

213

for the improvement of common potato that has a narrow genetic basis as many other crop
species (Ross, 1986). Wild germplasm has been actively utilized in potato breeding for
at least 70 years (Bukasov, 1937). Following interspecific crosses and backcrossing, all
11 known R genes conferring race-specific resistance to late blight have been introduced
into potato varieties from S. demissum (cid:2)AADDDdDd(cid:3) (Umareus and Umareus, 1994).
The virus resistance genes Ry, Ra, Na and Rx2 have been introgressed into potato from
S. stoloniferum (AABB) and S. acaule (cid:2)AAAaAa(cid:3), respectively (Solomon-Blackburn and
Barker, 2001). Methods used for ploidy manipulation (Hougas and Peloquin, 1958) make
most of the potato species with different EBNs cross-compatible with S. tuberosum.
However, some potentially useful species, e.g. A(cid:2)A(cid:2) genome-containing diploid Mexican
species or E(cid:2)E(cid:2) genome-containing species, cannot be hybridized easily because of the
crossing barriers (Hermsen, 1994). The range of hybridization has been broadened using
biotechnological methods that allowed to bring into breeding programmes new species
such as S. bulbocastanum, Solanum tarnii, S. etuberosum, S. brevidens and S. nigrum.
Following protoplast fusion, backcrossing and embryo or ovule rescue, fertile progenies
derived from crosses of wide somatic hybrids with common potato have been produced.
Some of these derivatives showed high levels of resistance to diseases. The list includes
broad-spectrum resistance to late blight from S. bulbocastanum (cid:2)AbAb(cid:3) (Helgeson et al.,
1998; Naess et al., 2000), resistance to tuber soft rot from S. brevidens (cid:2)EbEb(cid:3) (Tek et al.,
2004) and resistance to viruses and aphids from S. etuberosum (cid:2)EeEe(cid:3) (Novy et al., 2002;
Gavrilenko et al., 2003).

The most recent achievements in detecting introgression are discussed here briefly.
Molecular markers and in situ hybridization techniques have been essential for detect-
ing genetic material of wild species at the level of whole chromosomes, chromosomal
segments and individual genes. These methods were useful for the development and
characterization of heteromorphic aneuploid lines derived from crosses between distantly
related taxa. For instance, an entire series of monosomic alien addition lines (MAALs)
and two disomic addition lines for tomato chromosomes 10 and 11 (cid:2)AAAA+ L10 and
AAAA+ L11(cid:3) into potato have been established using RFLP and GISH (Garriga-Calderé
et al., 1998; Haider Ali et al., 2001; Fig. 10.1G). The application of sequential GISH
and FISH with CSCDMs allowed to distinguish addition and substitution lines (Dong
et al., 2005). Seven of 12 possible MAALs (cid:2)AAAA+ Eb(cid:3) and one monosomic substi-
tution for chromosome 6 of the Eb genome of S. brevidens have been extracted from
BC2 to BC3 progenies derived from potato (cid:2)+(cid:3) S. brevidens hybrids (Dong et al., 2005).
Importantly, the experiments provided the first evidence for the ability of chromosomes
of the two distinct genomes (A and E) to substitute for each other. For practical purposes,
these cytogenetic stocks can be useful for assigning unmapped gene(s) to chromosomes.
Intergenomic translocations have been identified by using in situ hybridization methods
in breeding lines originated from fusion hybrids of potato with tomato (Garriga-Calderé
et al., 1997, 1999) and potato with S. brevidens (Dong et al., 2001). It must be pointed
out that alien chromosome(s) or large alien translocated segments may not be stable when
transmitted through backcrossing. Stable introgression can be achieved through crossing
over. Following crossing of MAALs or substitution lines with common potato, it might
be possible to select genotypes carrying chromosomes that originated because of home-
ologous recombination. However, selection of genotypes with recombinant chromosomes

214

Gavrilenko

can be very laborious because of extremely low level of chromosome pairing between
the parental genomes A and L (Garriga-Calderé et al., 1999) and limited level of crossing
over between A and E genomes (McGrath et al., 1996).

Starting from 2000, new approaches based on molecular markers and genomics have
been developed to overcome such limitations. Cloned resistance genes of wild species can
be transferred through genetic engineering in susceptible varieties by passing the crossing
barriers. Already durable and broad-spectrum resistance against all known races of the
late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans has been introgressed from S. bulbocastanum
into potato by somatic hybridization and subsequent backcrossing (Helgeson et al., 1998;
Naess et al., 2001). The major late blight resistance gene RB of S. bulbocastanum was
physically mapped by FISH on potato chromosome VIII (Dong et al., 2000; Fig. 10.1D).
RB was then cloned using a map-based approach and transformed into susceptible potato
varieties (Song et al., 2003).

In conclusion, the introduction of in situ hybridization methods has promoted a
significant progress in potato cytogenetics, which has led to the integration of genetic
and cytological maps, getting new information about genome structure and detecting
introgressions with higher precision. Furthermore, the development and use of molecular
techniques will be of great help in better understanding genome evolution and polyploid
formation, further development of genetic and physical mapping of genes controlling
economically important
their
genetic basis.

11.1 INTRODUCTION

The potato plant (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a perennial herb, but in agriculture it is
used as an annual crop. It is usually propagated using seed tubers. Figure 11.1 illustrates
the traditional way of multiplying the potato. Seed tubers produce sprouts in their eyes,
which develop into shoots, and produce roots from primordia on the sprouts. On these
shoots, the stems, foliage, stolons, roots, inflorescences and the next generation of tubers
are formed. For definitions of the different plant parts see Sections 11.4–11.9.

One may use very different propagules to propagate the potato plant or even the crop.
These may include individual cells, meristems, tissues, sprouts, tuber parts, true (botanical)
seeds and leaf or stem cuttings (Struik and Wiersema, 1999). This type of propagule has
a strong effect on the above-ground and below-ground development. The size of the main
shoot (number of branches, number of nodes per stem part, size of the individual leaves,
abundance of flowering), the number and distribution of stolons along the below-ground
part of the stem and the position, number and size of tubers are all affected by the type
of propagule used to grow the plant. In this chapter, we focus on the development of the
plant grown from a seed tuber.

11.2 GENERAL MORPHOLOGY

Figure 11.2 shows the morphology of a normal S. tuberosum spp. tuberosum plant.
Included in this figure are a full-grown plant (A), a flower (B), a berry (C), a seedling
(D, for comparison only), the below-ground parts (E), a tuber (F) and a single sprout on
a seed tuber (G). Details on the morphology of the stem system, the leaves, the stolon
system and the tubers are given in Sections 11.4, 11.5, 11.6 and 11.7, respectively.

The morphology of both the below- and the above-ground plant parts strongly depends
on the size and the physiological age of the seed tubers planted. This is illustrated
in Fig. 11.3 for the number of stems per seed tuber. However, at the same time,
also the growth pattern of each individual stem is influenced through specific effects
on vigour, number of leaves formed per stem element, time of stolonization, stolon

branching, tuberization and flowering, duration of tuber set and tuber growth, the onset of
plant senescence and the length of the growth cycle. For the description of the morphology
of the plant, we take as a norm a plant grown from a normal-sized seed tuber or seed piece
(40–80 g fresh weight) of a ‘normal’ physiological age, that is an age usually encountered
when seed potato tubers are taken from a normal seed potato crop, desiccated before
tuber bulking has ended naturally, harvested a few weeks after haulm destruction and
stored at 2–4

C for about 8 months until planting in the next year.

11.3 SPROUT DEVELOPMENT

The sprouts that develop on the seed tuber go through different stages when the seed tuber
is ageing. This development of the sprout is partly dependent on the ageing processes
taking place in the seed tuber but can – to some extent – also be moderated independently
from them by chemical treatment or exposure to certain conditions during storage (light,
photoperiod, temperature and relative humidity). Sprout development is crucial for the
performance of the seed tuber. An illustration of the morphological development of
the sprout and its consequences for the crop is provided in Fig. 11.4.

11.4 THE SHOOT SYSTEM

From a seed tuber, usually several main stems are derived, because several buds produce
a viable shoot. As there is more than one bud per eye, the number of stems per eye may
even be more than one. An individual potato plant as it commonly manifests itself in

tuber [Based on: Struik and Wiersema (1999)].

agriculture is therefore in fact a cluster of stems, originating from one seed tuber or
seed piece. During the first part of their growing period, these stems share resources
from the same seed tuber unit, but shortly after planting, these individual stems become
independent units albeit that they are in strong competition with each other for light,
water and nutrients.

Also each stem consists of various elements, which we will call stem segments of
various orders [main (primary) segment, secondary stem segment, tertiary stem segment
etc.]. The entire shoot system is illustrated in Fig. 11.5.

Often two types of potato varieties are distinguished: the determinate type and the
indeterminate type. Determinate types tend to remain short, as they do not produce many
successive orders within one stem. They also tend to have a short life cycle. Indeterminate
types, however, tend to grow tall, may produce many different levels and have a long
cycle. The yield potential of indeterminate types is higher than that of determinate types,
but they need a much longer growing season to realize their potential.

The below-ground parts of the stems are usually round and massive, whereas in the
upper part, the internodes can be hollow. Above-ground stem parts are angular, usually
with the shape of a triangle when cut in a transverse direction and often winged. Depending
on variety, the colour of the stem may be green, red or purple.

11.5 THE LEAVES

The potato plant has one major leaf per node. The early leaves are small, whereas the
later leaves are alternate and pinnate compound with three or four pairs of large, ovate
to ovate elliptical leaflets with smaller ones in between. The rachis ends in a top leaflet
that is often the largest one, with a shape that sometimes deviates from the other large
leaflets. The small leaflets are subsessile, ovate to suborbicular.

Firman et al. (1991) showed that 20–40 leaf primordia are produced during storage
before the start of flower initiation. The number of leaf primordia thus shows considerable
variation. However, the number of nodes of a main stem above ground is usually

Almekinders and Struik (1996) and Struik and Wiersema (1999)]. (A) Different types of stems of a potato plant,
consisting of a cluster of main stems. Figure A illustrates schematically a potato plant with three main stems,
of which one has been illustrated in detail. This detailed main stem has basal, lateral stems from below-ground
nodes which may be difficult to distinguish morphologically from normal main stems when they arise close to the
seed tuber. They can produce their own stolons and tubers. The main stem also shows basal, lateral stems from
above-ground nodes. These usually do not produce stolons or tubers, unless their basic parts are covered by earth-
ening up or when urged to produce aerial tubers because of diseases or physiological malfunctioning of the below-
ground stolon and tuber system. One single main stem will terminate in an inflorescence, but below the apex,
several apical lateral stems of successive orders may appear. a, apical, lateral stems of successive orders; b, basal,
lateral stems from above-ground node; c, basal, lateral stems from below-ground node; d, other main stems and

(cid:2), inflorescence.(B) This illustrates a diagram of a complex single main stem. Each main stem may consist of a
main primary stem segment, some basal lateral stems and different layers of apical lateral stems (higher-order stem
segments). Usually the n− 1 and the n− 2 secondary stems develop, with n being the uppermost leaf of the main
primary stem. In this way, there can be many inflorescences per individual stem. The structure consisting of the stem
segments of increasing order from main primary stem until the sixth level stem segment as illustrated in B is called
a sympodium. (C) Simplified version of (B) to illustrate the different types of secondary and higher-order stem
segments on the main primary stem. Secondary stem segments occur on the nodes immediately below the inflores-
cence of the primary main stem and on the nodes close to the soil level. Tertiary and higher-order stem segments
are usually only formed on the secondary stems just below the inflorescence of the first level, only when geno-
type, climatic conditions (long days and relatively high temperatures), weather conditions (rainfall, temperature
and light) and crop management (irrigation, nitrogen fertilisation, etc.) allow.

rather constant within a cultivar, showing only little variation caused by variation
in environment (Almekinders and Struik, 1996). When the seed tubers are properly
pre-sprouted, the number of leaves that will be produced until the first inflorescence
appears, is – within a cultivar – rather constant over the years. There is also little
variation in time needed to start reproductive development of the first primary main
stem. Flowering induction may even be completed before planting, and then the number
of above-ground nodes preceding the primary inflorescence is completely determined by
processes determining sprout elongation.

For the lateral branches, this is entirely different. There is a strong position effect on
the number of leaves produced before the first inflorescence of the above-ground lateral
branches. The lower the branch is inserted the higher its number of leaves. The maximum
number of leaves in the lower branches can even be higher than that in the main stem.
Both long days and higher temperatures increase the number of leaves on the secondary
stems. At the higher temperature, the photoperiod effect is stronger. These phenomena
are illustrated in Fig. 11.6 (Almekinders and Struik, 1994, 1996).

The development of the number of leaves along the different stem segments of the
central sympodium (from primary main stem until higher order) of a complex main stem
is shown in Fig. 11.7. The number of leaves per stem segment decreases with an increase
in order, although the trend is not always clear cut.

Figure 11.8 gives an indication of the appearance rate of compound leaves at abundant
fertiliser application with plants receiving ample light in a pot experiment in the green-
house. Leaf appearance is linear during the first phase of plant growth. Typically the rate

appearance rates of main stem leaves of potato in experiments with different cultivars and
C. In this data set, the leaf appearance rate ranged
average temperatures of 13(cid:2)0–17(cid:2)4
from 0.33 to 0.53 per day or 0.0242 to 0.0317 leaf per

32–41
Biemond (1992) is in the upper range of leaf appearance rates. The last leaves appear
at a slower rate as at that time there is competition between above-ground growth and
below-ground growth.

Figure 11.9 presents different growth characteristics of individual leaves. The rate of
leaf area increase is determined by the position of the leaf on the plant. The rate of area
increase initially increases with an increase in leaf insertion number until about leaf 13
(depending on cultivar) on the main primary (first order) stem. It then gradually decreases
with a further increase in leaf insertion number. The first leaves on the secondary order
stem segment differ little in rate of expansion, but with a further increase in leaf insertion
number, the expansion rate starts to decline again. The same trends are observed for the
following orders. The effects of leaf insertion number on mature leaf size are very similar
to the effects on rate of leaf area increase as there is a close, curvilinear relationship (not
shown) between rate of area increase and mature area (Vos and Biemond, 1992). The
life span of the individual leaves increases with an increase in leaf insertion number until
leaves 12–13 of the first order main stem and then slowly declines. The life span varies
between 30 and over 100 days. Leaves with the largest area (the middle leaves on the
primary order) also have the longest life span.

stem segment. Data for the highest nitrogen level from Vos and Biemond (1992) [Based on: Vos and Biemond

Specific leaf area of the whole potato plant increases over time until it reaches a peak
at about 100 days after emergence (Vos and Biemond, 1992); for an individual leaf, there
is a similar trend, but the timing of the peak obviously depends on time of appearance
and thus on leaf insertion number.

The proportional distribution of the leaf area over different stem types is relevant
as not all stem segments contribute to tuber bulking to the same extent. Table 11.1

lateral branches and basal lateral branches. The contribution of the apical lateral branches
increases over time. The contribution of the basal laterals strongly depends on the cultivar.

11.6 THE STOLON SYSTEM

The rhizomes of the potato plant are usually called stolons. Stolons are diageotropic
(or plagiotropic) shoots or stems, with strongly elongated internodes and rudimentary
(scale) leaves. They are usually hooked at the tip and usually originate below ground
from the basal stem nodes. Three stolons per node may arise, one main stolon and two
from the axillary buds at the same node.

Stolonization is believed to start at the nodes closest to the seed tuber and to progress
acropetally (Cutter, 1992). The first stolons grow faster and become longer than later-
initiated stolons (Struik and van Voorst, 1986). This is illustrated schematically in
Fig. 11.10. However, this pattern is not always clear cut. Other researchers have found
a lower rate of elongation growth for the first two or three stolons, a very high rate of
growth of stolons four to eight and a lower rate of growth with increasing stolon rank
number (A. van der Maarl and P.C. Struik, unpublished data).

Figure 11.11 illustrates the development over time of the number of stolons and
tubers. It shows that the stolonization starts very soon after emergence. It may even start
before the shoot emerges. Tuberization starts before all stolons have been formed. The
tubers that finally grow out to substantial sizes are initiated within a very short period
of time.

Before tuberization starts, the longitudinal stolon growth must slow down. Many
investigations have tried to link the patterns of longitudinal growth to the onset of
tuberization. For example, Helder et al. (1993) analysed the linkage in very much
detail for the wild species Solanum demissum, but they could not find a clear pattern.

The occurrence of subapical swelling was not linked to the rate of longitudinal growth of
the stolons or stolon branches during the period before stolon swelling.

However, there tends to be more delay between stolon initiation and tuber initiation in
the earlier-formed stolons than in the later-formed stolons (Vreugdenhil and Struik, 1989).
This is consistent with the schematic diagram of the stolon system given in Fig. 11.10.

The first stolons often show extensive branching, thus increasing the number of
potential tuber sites (Helder et al., 1993). However, having more than one tuber per stolon
causes strong competition for resources and has a large effect on the size distribution of
tubers.

11.7 THE TUBERS

Normally, the tubers are the swollen parts of the subterranean rhizomes or stolons and
are globose to ellipsoid in shape. The tuber skin has scars of scale leaves (eye brows)
with axillary buds (eyes). Tubers vary in size, skin and flesh colour and skin texture.
Although tubers are usually formed on stolons, with strong induction to tuberize, they
can also be sessile. Tubers may also be formed above ground on all buds and even in the
inflorescence (Ewing and Struik, 1992). Originating as the swollen part of stolons, tubers
are in fact greatly shortened and thickened stem segments. They contain high levels of
starch and storage proteins and even may bear roots.

Tubers start as stolon swellings and can go through different phases of tuber set, tuber
growth and tuber maturation. When induction to tuberize is interrupted, they can show
secondary growth, especially when the plant is exposed to heat or irregular water supply.
At stolon tip swelling, the plane of cell division changes, and there is an increase in radial
cell expansion (Xu et al., 1998; Vreugdenhil et al., 1999). One of the first signs of tuber
formation is the increase in the dry matter content of the stolon tip and a change in sugar
metabolism. The starch content increases, whereas the glucose and fructose contents drop
(Helder, 1993). Another significant biochemical change upon tuberization is the accumu-
lation of storage proteins called patatins (glycoproteins) (Park, 1990; Hannapel, 1991).
They play a major role during sprouting (Ewing and Struik, 1992).

Figure 11.11 illustrates the development over time of the number of tuber incipients
and the number of tubers set. Figure 11.12 presents a schematic representation of the
change over time of the total number of tuber incipients and the number of tubers that will
grow out to marketable tuber sizes for two cases. Case 1 reflects a situation with abundant
tuber initiation; case 2 shows an example of much less abundant tuberization. In the first
case, many tuber incipients will not grow out to marketable sizes. They are resorbed
during the growing season. In the second case, almost all tubers that are initiated grow out
to marketable sizes. Tuber initiation may come in different waves creating an irregular
tuber size distribution and severe competition between different categories of tubers.

It is commonly believed that the largest tuber at one point in time is also the largest
tuber at the end of the growing season. However, individual tuber growth rate and
growth duration may show different and dynamic hierarchies among tubers. Thus, there
are crossovers in individual tuber growth rate as illustrated by Schnieders et al. (1988).
In general, however, the relative variability in tuber size (the coefficient of variation
of the tuber size) is rather constant once tuber set is completed and depends on tuber
number, although the relation may be complex (Struik et al., 1990, 1991). Based on the
fixed relative variability and the close relation between yield and average tuber size,
tuber size distributions can easily be predicted once tuber numbers do not further change
drastically.

number of tubers that will grow out to marketable sizes for two cases. Case 1 reflects a situation with abundant
tuber initiation; case 2 shows an example of much less abundant tuberization.

The position of the large tubers very much depends not only on the environmental
conditions to which the entire plant is exposed (Struik et al., 1991) but also to the
micro-environment around each individual stolon (Struik and Wiersema, 1999).

11.8 ORGANS OF SEXUAL REPRODUCTION

The inflorescence is a cymose panicle, formed in the axil of the leaves on several stem
segments (Figs 11.2 and 11.5). An individual flower consists of a greenish campanulate
calyx composed of five sepals and five petals (varying in colour, often white, yellow
or violet). It has five stamens. The anthers of the stamens are joined laterally forming a
cone-shaped structure, which conceals the ovary.

The number of inflorescences and the number of flowers per inflorescence strongly
depend on growing conditions and on the order of the stem segment bearing the inflores-
cence (Fig. 11.7). Especially, photoperiod, temperature, plant density and nitrogen supply
are important. Higher-order stem segments usually have fewer flowers per inflorescence
(Fig. 11.7).

Above-ground and below-ground plant development

233

The berries are globular, have two carpels and may contain many seeds. Berry size is
determined to a great extent by berry position within the inflorescence and the position
of the inflorescence. There are specific relations among berry weight, number of seeds
per berry and 100-seed weight (Almekinders et al., 1995).

11.9 ROOT SYSTEM

The potato has a fibrous root system (Fig. 11.2). Root initials can already be present
on the sprouts during pre-sprouting (Fig. 11.2G). The root system is rather weak, and
therefore, water and nutrient use efficiencies in potato are low, and the crop is very
sensitive to drought and poor soil structure. Roots occur not only on the stems but also
on stolons and sometimes even on tubers. Stolon and tuber roots may be essential in
supplying nutrients to the growing tubers, especially because the intensity of root growth
declines after the onset of tuber bulking (Steckel and Gray, 1974).

11.10 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT OF ABOVE-GROUND

AND BELOW-GROUND PLANT PARTS

There is a delicate balance between the above-ground and below-ground development of
the potato plant. Events above ground and below ground are linked because of

1. the initiation of flower primordia on the main stem calling the primary order

development to a halt and triggering the formation of apical lateral branches;

2. the mutually interacting initiation of stolons, stolon branches and tuber incipients, and

the formation and resorption of tubers;

3. the shift of assimilate partitioning to tubers after tuberization and
4. the resulting cessation of shoot growth which limits the growth cycle of the crop.

The life cycle of the potato crop can be described in terms of the period until induction
of flowering, the time to tuber initiation, the time to onset of rapid tuber bulking, the
time to cessation of shoot growth and the time to onset of senescence. These events
are closely associated, in terms of both crop physiology and time, but the time lapse
between the different events depends on the genotype, the environment and the genotype
by environment interaction. Not only the timing of these events but also the intensity of
several of these changes may differ. The shift in assimilate partitioning towards tubers
may be very abrupt and complete but may also take some time and be gradual. The same
is true for cessation of shoot growth.

Initiation of flowering and tuber initiation are interlinked. It is commonly accepted
that the potato plant is a short day or day neutral plant for tuber initiation. Development
scales of the crop often link tuber formation to flowering. Almekinders and Struik (1996)
also argued that the potato is a short day or day neutral plant for flowering. Nevertheless,
flowering is more abundant when tuber formation is delayed, because a delay of tuber

234

Struik

formation will allow more basal and apical lateral branches to be formed, more stem
segments to be formed per sympodium and will enhance the development of individual
inflorescences and flowers.

For yield formation, however, the link between the number of sprouts, number of
stems, number of stolons and number of tubers and the link between onset of tuber
formation and the shift in dry matter partitioning and thus the cessation of shoot growth are
probably more relevant but rather variable. The first link is illustrated in Fig. 11.13. The
second link can be derived by comparing the two temperatures (one allowing relatively
strong tuber induction and the other one delaying tuber formation), which is illustrated
in Fig. 11.7.

A striking phenomenon in the physiology of the potato crop at higher latitudes is
the fact that there is a long overlap between stolonization and tuberization (Vreugdenhil
and Struik, 1989). Tuber formation already starts when stolon formation is still in full
progress. This illustrates that there is not a sudden and complete switch in the level of
induction at plant level but that the trigger to stop longitudinal growth and start radial
growth and expansion is local. This is crucial for determining tuber hierarchies, allocation
of resources and final size distributions.

How plastic the order of events in the potato crop, is illustrated in Table 11.2.

Signalling the Induction of Tuber Formation

12.1 INTRODUCTION

The mechanism of tuberization has been the subject of considerable investigation by plant
scientists in the past several decades. However, the precise controlling factors involved
in this growth process are not entirely clear. A tuber is a shortened, thickened stem with
leaves reduced to scales or scars subtending the axillary buds known as eyes. Potato
tubers form from modified shoots called stolons. Tuberization is also used to describe
the formation of the underground storage organs of dahlia, Jerusalem artichoke and
begonia. Tuber formation in potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a complex developmental
process that requires the interaction of environmental, biochemical and genetic factors.
It involves many important biological processes, including carbon partitioning, signal
transduction and meristem determination (reviewed by Ewing and Struik, 1992). Gregory
(1965) has considered the development of potato tubers in three general stages: (1)
tuber initiation, which is characterized by differentiation and the development of tuber
primordium without evidence of any visible swelling; (2) tuber enlargement, characterized
by rapid cell division, starch accumulation and visible swelling of the stolon tip and (3)
tuber maturation, when the organ passes into the dormant period. This chapter will focus
on those factors that affect the initial stages of tuber development and the signal that
activates growth in the stolon tip.

In wild potato species such as S. tuberosum ssp. andigena, short-day (SD) photoperiods
are required for tuber formation. This species tuberizes only under SD conditions (less
than 12 h of light) and does not produce tubers when grown under long days (LDs) or
SD supplemented with a night break. The main site of perception of the photoperiodic
signal is in the leaves. Under inductive conditions, a transmissible signal is activated
which initiates cell division and expansion and a change in the orientation of cell growth
in the subapical region of the stolon tip (Xu et al., 1998a). In this signal transduction
pathway, perception of the appropriate environmental cues is mediated by phytochrome
and gibberellins (GAs) (Jackson and Prat, 1996; Jackson et al., 1996). High levels of
GAs are correlated with the inhibition of tuberization, whereas low levels are associated
with induction both at the site of perception (the leaf) and in the target organ, the stolon
apex, site of the newly formed tuber (Jackson and Prat, 1996; Xu et al., 1998b). Although
some excellent molecular work has been done characterizing the process of tuberization
(Bachem et al., 1996; Macleod et al., 1999; Viola et al., 2001; Martinez-Garcia et al.,

2002b; Raices et al., 2003), the exact mechanism for inducing tuber formation is unknown.
This chapter will focus on specific molecular switches that mediate the activation of the
morphological events associated with the tuberizing stolon.

12.2 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

One of the earliest studies of tuberization was made by Bernard (1902), who believed that
tuberization in potatoes was caused by a symbiotic relationship between the plant and a
mycorrhizal fungus. This was disproved by Magrou (1943) who produced tubers from
seed-grown plants under sterile conditions and explained the process as an increase in
osmotic pressure at the tip of stolons caused by a high carbohydrate concentration supplied
by the culture medium or photosynthesis. Werner (1934) supported these conclusions
by establishing that environmental and cultural factors, such as SDs, low temperatures
and low supply of nitrogen, that raised the carbohydrate/nitrogen ratio also promoted
tuberization. Driver and Hawkes (1943) suggested that increased respiration stimulated
by LDs and high temperatures (both of which can be inhibitory for tuberization) decreases
the quantity of carbohydrates available for translocation to underground parts and that
this can prevent the onset of tuberization. Under these conditions, active vegetative
growth is favoured and uses a greater proportion of photosynthates. Studies showed
that by enhancing carbohydrate accumulation at stolon tips, initiation of tuberization is
promoted by factors such as high radiation, low temperature and a low nutrient supply
(Werner, 1934; Borah and Milthorpe 1962; Burt, 1964). Those that favoured the ‘nutrient
theory’ postulated that the availability of carbohydrates and, consequently, the carbon/
nitrogen ratio were more important than the action of a specific tuber-inducing growth
substance.

(cid:2)

C night temperature) and noninduced (16-h day and 20

Garner and Allard (1920, 1923) first established the significance of environmental fac-
tors in the regulation of tuberization. Their work demonstrated the effects of photoperiod
on several tuberous species, and they suggested that tuberization is induced by a specific
photoperiodic stimulus. The foliage was considered to be the receptor of this stimulus.
Work by Gregory (1956) and Chapman (1958) suggested the existence of this specific
tuber-forming stimulus. Gregory (1956) took cuttings from potato plants grown under
C night
induced (8-h day and 17
temperature) conditions and grafted them on to noninduced plants. Cuttings from induced
plants produced tubers on scion plants, whereas those from noninduced plants produced
no tubers. Using in vitro culture techniques, Gregory further showed that soluble sugars
must be present in the medium for tuber formation from stem cuttings to occur. Using
differential daylength treatment of plants with two stems, Chapman (1958) showed that
unilateral formation of tubers occurred only on the SD half of the stolon system. Several
other workers (Madec and Perennec 1959; Madec 1963; Kumar and Wareing 1972)
have presented further evidence for a tuber-inducing stimulus. Scions from S. tuberosum
ssp. andigena plants grown under SD and grafted on to potato stocks grown under LD
can induce tuberization (Kumar and Wareing, 1973). In an eloquent grafting experiment
(Fig. 12.1), a graft-transmissible substance was transported from the induced shoot tips
of both LD- and SD-flowering tobacco plants to the potato stock grown under LDs to

long day (LD)- or short day (SD)-flowering tobacco plants grown under inductive conditions were grafted on

induce tuber formation (Chailakhyan et al., 1981). These results imply that flowering
and tuberization may be mediated by the same phloem-transported signal. The conclu-
sions drawn from this work may be summarized as follows: (1) under conditions of low
temperature and SDs, leaves undergo a change that results in the production of specific
metabolites that stimulate tuber induction; (2) the tuber-inducing stimulus appears to be
transmitted through a graft union and (3) soluble sugars appear to be essential for the
initiation of tuberization but are not the only essential substance. What then is the exact
nature and composition of this putative tuber-inducing stimulus?

Under the inductive conditions of an SD photoperiod and cool night temperatures,
the leaf perceives the environmental cue and activates an inducing signal. This signal is
then transmitted through the phloem to the target organ, an elongating stolon tip. The
signal activates changes in cell growth activity in the subapical region of the stolon
apex to create a strong sink organ. Informative studies of this latter process have been
undertaken by using in vitro model systems (Xu et al., 1998a; Vreugdenhil et al., 1999).
These changes include the induction of cell division, cell enlargement and a change in the
orientation of cell division from transverse to longitudinal. Cells in the pith and cortex
enlarged and divided longitudinally. Overall, these changes result in the retardation of
stolon elongation and an increase in the radial expansion of the subapical region, leading
to tuber formation (Fig. 12.2). Most of the cell growth that leads to an increase in tuber
size occurs in the perimedullary region of the stolon (Fig. 12.3).

The creation of this strong sink, the newly formed tuber, results in the accumulation
of a specific set of storage proteins and massive amounts of starch (reviewed by Fernie
and Willmitzer, 2001).

12.2.1 Photoregulation

Phytochrome B (PHYB) is known to mediate the photoperiodic control of tuberization in
a negative regulatory mechanism. Transgenic plants with suppressed levels of PHYB lose
the capacity to respond to a LD photoperiod. These plants tuberize under LD conditions as
efficiently as SD (Jackson et al., 1996). Grafting experiments with PHYB antisense plants

and wild-type potato plants showed that PHYB regulates the transmission of an inhibitor
of tuberization. Wild-type stocks grown under LD conditions tuberize when PHYB anti-
sense scions were grafted on to them (Jackson et al., 1998). In Arabidopsis, CONSTANS
is a putative transcription factor (TF) that accelerates flowering in response to LDs. Con-
stitutive overexpression in potato of the Arabidopsis gene constans impairs tuberization
under SD (inductive) conditions (Martinez-Garcia et al., 2002b). These transgenic lines
exhibited a delayed tuberization phenotype, suggesting that CONSTANS has a function
in the photoperiodic pathway controlling tuber formation. A constans orthologue exists
in potato, which may mediate the photoperiod control of tuberization (González-Schain
et al., 2003).

In an attempt to isolate genes with a role in photoperiodic control of tuber formation,
a photoperiod responsive cDNA was isolated from leaves of subspecies andigena and
designated PHOR1 (Amador et al., 2001). PHOR1 encodes a novel arm-repeat protein
with homology to the Drosophila segment polarity gene, armadillo. Expression of PHOR1
is enhanced in leaves of plants induced for tuberization. Transgenic antisense plants
with reduced levels of the PHOR1 protein exhibited a phenotype characteristic of plants
with an altered response to GAs. These lines exhibited reduced stem length, earlier
tuberization under SDs and enhanced insensitivity to applied GAs. Subcellular localization
studies showed that the PHOR1–green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion had a cytoplasmic
localization and a rapid migration of the fusion protein into the nucleus on treatment with
GAs. PHOR1 is a novel component of the GA-signalling pathway with a function in the
perception of the GA response.

12.3 THE ROLE OF GROWTH REGULATORS IN CONTROLLING

TUBERIZATION

Similar to flower induction, numerous physiological studies have implicated both an
inhibitor and a promoter working coordinately to control tuber induction. Early investiga-
tors presented evidence for phytohormones acting as the chemical regulators, with GAs
acting as the inhibitor and cytokinins as the promoter (Hammes and Nel, 1975). This
model envisions control by the regulatory effects of inhibitors on GA and subsequent
activation of cytokinins leading to cell division and the mobilization of carbohydrates
during tuber initiation.

Tuber initiation is accompanied by a reduction in dry weight of haulms, stolons and
roots (Hammes and Nel, 1975) and an increase in stem height and the production of
anthocyanin (Martinez-Garcia et al., 2002a). Such correlated growth reactions would
seem to indicate that the induction stimulus is present throughout the plant and that inter-
dependent control mechanisms stop stolon growth, induce tuber formation and increase
the rate of photosynthesis, possibly by mobilizing carbohydrates from leaves to tubers.
The possibility of a hormonal balance controlling tuberization has been proposed (Palmer
and Barker, 1973; Tizio and Biain, 1973; Hammes and Nel, 1975). One explanation is
the existence of a direct balance between endogenous GA and inhibitors. These inhibitors
may readily control the level of active GA. As GA concentrations are lowered below a
critical level, this stimulates the synthesis of cytokinins or another specific substance that
activates tuberization. Let us examine what evidence exists to support this hypothesis.

12.3.1 Gibberellins

GAs have been implicated in inhibiting tuberization under LD photoperiods. GA levels in
the leaf decreased under SD photoperiods and increased under LD conditions (Railton and
Wareing, 1973). High levels of GA in the stolon tip favour elongation of stolon meristems,
whereas decreasing levels of GA are required for the initiation of tuberization (Xu et al.,
1998b). Several workers have shown that the noninduced state in potato plants is correlated
with high endogenous GA levels (Okazawa, 1959, 1960; Pont-Lezica, 1970; Railton
and Wareing, 1973) and that the exogenous application of GA inhibited tuberization
(Kumar and Wareing, 1974; Hammes and Nel, 1975). Menzel (1980) demonstrated that
the inhibitory effects of high temperatures (32
C night) and exogenous
GA were similar: both promoted haulm growth and suppressed tuberization. He also
showed that low temperature (22
C night), abscisic acid (ABA) and
2-chloroethyltrimethylammonium chloride (CCC) had the opposite effect. ABA and CCC
are both inhibitors of GA (Moore, 1979). In this case, Menzel speculates that temperature
exerts its influence by altering the balance between GA and inhibitors or other substances
that act directly on the stolon tips. Photoperiod may play a similar role. Kumar and
Wareing (1974) reported that GA levels were highest in LD plants and very low in SD
plants. Applications of GA on SD cuttings inhibited tuberization, and CCC applications
stimulated tuber formation on LD cuttings and lowered GA levels. GA is also reported
(Palmer and Barker, 1972) to regulate enzyme activity. Invertase activity, associated with
stolon elongation, is positively correlated with exogenous GA concentrations in vitro.

Enzymes involved in starch synthesis, characteristic of tuberization, were most active
when GA levels were low (Obata-Sasamoto and Suzuki, 1979). GA can act as antagonist
to the proposed mobilizing effect of natural cytokinins. Lovell and Booth (1967) showed
that application of GA on potato plants at an early stage of tuber development resulted
in greatly reduced transfer of assimilated 14C to the stolons.

Although there are examples of both promotive (El-Antably et al., 1967; Zaib and
Rafig, 1980) and inhibitory effects (Palmer and Smith, 1969) of ABA on tuberization,
it is likely that promotive effects are due to inactivation of GA. Zaib and Rafig (1980)
offered proof that ABA could reverse the inhibitory effects of GA on stem cuttings
in vitro. In this study, ABA promoted tuberization, decreased total fresh weight and
chlorophyll content and increased total protein. GAs have long been known to play an
important role in regulating tuber formation. High levels of GA in leaves are associated
with the noninduced state, whereas low levels of GA are associated with the induced
state. High levels of GA are detected in the apices of noninduced, elongating stolons.
−1(cid:4) decrease precipitously on 4 days of culture on
These high levels of GA (cid:3)>500 ng g
an inductive medium (8% sucrose). Concomitant with the formation of a new tuber, the
reduction in GA in stolon apices can be as great as 50-fold (Xu et al., 1998b). Using
transgenic S. tuberosum ssp. andigena lines, Carrera et al. (2000) showed that changing
the expression level of the GA20 oxidase1 gene, encoding for a key enzyme in the GA
biosynthetic pathway, strongly affected tuber induction and yield. Suppressed levels of
GA20 oxidase expression enhanced tuber production, whereas increased levels of GA20
oxidase expression retarded tuber development. The BEL/KNOX tandem of TFs discussed
in Section 12.5 regulates tuber development by lowering bioactive GA levels through the
repression of GA20 oxidase1 gene activity (Rosin et al., 2003a; Chen et al., 2004)

In summary, support for a control role of GAs in tuberization comes from several lines
of research: (1) the higher levels of GA in noninduced potato plants; (2) the inhibition
of tuberization in whole plants, stem cuttings and stem segments treated with GA and
(3) the promotion of tuberization by inhibitors and suppressors of GA activity. Although
it is clear that GAs have an important function in controlling tuber formation, the site
of synthesis for these GAs is not known. GAs contribute to the change in orientation of
cell growth in the subapical region of the tuberizing stolon but also act in the leaf as a
signalling mechanism.

12.3.2 Cytokinins

Early studies demonstrated that kinetin was incorporated into stolon tips prior to tuber
formation (Smith and Palmer, 1969, 1970). Stolons cultured on medium with kinetin
formed tubers, whereas those without kinetin formed none. Kinetin eliminated the need
for photoperiod induction of tubers on stem sections of S. tuberosum, demonstrating the
same propensity for tuberization as SD induction (Forsline and Langille, 1976). Using
actinomycin D, chloramphenicol and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, Palmer and Smith (1969)
showed that kinetin-induced tuber formation was independent of protein and nucleic acid
synthesis. They postulated the existence of a tuberization switch that induces cytokinin
activity. The presence of zeatin riboside was positively correlated with the induced state

244

Hannapel

in potato plants. In vitro studies produced 75% tuberization with zeatin riboside treatment
compared with 0% for controls (Mauk and Langille, 1978).

Cytokinins indirectly affect

tuberization by enhancing the activation of starch-
synthesizing enzymes to support continuing starch deposition (Obata-Sasamoto and
Suzuki, 1979). Mingo-Castel et al. (1976) demonstrated that applications of exogenous
kinetin in vitro stimulated accumulation of starch, possibly by activation of ADP glucose
phosphorylase and pyrophosphorylase during tuberization. In a study on the effects of
kinetin and ethylene (Palmer and Barker, 1973), kinetin-treated stolons showed increased
starch synthesis with decreased invertase activity, RNase activity and lower levels of
soluble sugars at the stolon tip.

By activating cell division, cytokinins may be locally involved in the initial creation of
the strong tuber sink. Li et al. (1992) showed that cytokinin activity can create a nutrient
sink and that both 14C-labelled sucrose and amino acids are mobilized to localized sites
of high cytokinin accumulation. Amyloplast development and the increased transcription
of starch biosynthesis enzymes are specifically induced by cytokinins in cultured tobacco
cells (Miyazawa et al., 1999). Local synthesis of cytokinins in axillary buds of transgenic
tobacco resulted in an increase in starch accumulation in the lateral shoots that formed
(Guivarc’h et al., 2002). An increase in cytokinin levels mediated by suppression of the
MADS box TF, POTM1, resulted in an increase in starch accumulation and active cell
division in specific cells of meristems and leaves (Rosin et al., 2003b).

As a useful experimental approach, the Agrobacterium ipt gene has been introduced
into plants to overproduce cytokinin (Barry et al., 1984). These cytokinin overproduction
phenotypes include loss of apical dominance, decreased leaf size and internode length and
poor root growth. Tuberization is also affected by the expression of the Agrobacterium
ipt gene, with high levels of cytokinins inhibiting and moderate levels promoting tuber
formation (Gális et al., 1995; Romanov et al., 2000). As illustrated by Sergeeva et al.
(2000), the ratio of cytokinin to auxin is important for tuberization. A slight increase in
the cytokinin to auxin ratio promotes tuberization. A large change in the ratio, however,
inhibits tuberization, in favour of the formation of truncated shoots that accumulated
high levels of starch. Local expression of the ipt gene in axillary buds of transgenic
tobacco created a strong sink and resulted in the formation of truncated, tuberizing
lateral branches (Guivarc’h et al., 2002). These swollen, lateral branches were similar in
morphology to those produced from axillary buds of POTM1 suppression lines (Rosin
et al., 2003b).

The following points support the role of cytokinins as a regulatory factor for tuber
induction: (1) There is a requirement for cell division during tuberization, a process
known to be promoted by cytokinins (Skoog and Miller, 1957). Cytokinin accumulation
is associated with the promotion of tuber formation (Gális et al., 1995; Romanov et al.,
2000). (2) Tuber initiation requires the inhibition of cell elongation and the promotion of
lateral growth or swelling (Vanderhoff and Key, 1968; Scott and Liverman, 1956). Local
accumulation of cytokinins in axillary buds of transgenic tobacco produced truncated,
tuberizing lateral branches (Guivarc’h et al., 2002). (3) Starch accumulation is an impor-
tant component of tuberization, and cytokinins promote the mobilization of carbohydrates
(Mothes, 1964). The transformation of stolon cells to tuber cells (Xu et al., 1998b) may

Signalling the induction of tuber formation

245

be facilitated by the presence of cytokinins. TFs discussed in Section 12.5 enhance tuber
formation and regulate cytokinin levels (Chen et al., 2003).

12.3.3 Lipoxygenase activity and the role of jasmonates

Plant lipoxygenases (LOXs) are a functionally diverse class of dioxygenases implicated
in physiological processes such as growth, senescence and stress-related responses. LOXs
incorporate oxygen into their fatty acid substrates and produce hydroperoxide fatty acids
that are precursors of jasmonic acid and related compounds. Oxylipin products of this
pathway, jasmonic and tuberonic acids, have been implicated as tuber-inducing com-
pounds (Koda et al., 1991; Pelacho and Mingo-Castel, 1991). Specifically, jasmonic acid
is involved in the induction of radial cell expansion in tuber cells (Takahashi et al., 1994)
and tuber buds (Castro et al., 1999).

Studies by Kolomiets et al. (2001) showed that tuber-associated LOXs, designated
the Lox1 class, are involved in the control of tuber growth. RNA hybridization analysis
showed that accumulation of Lox1-class transcripts was restricted to developing tubers,
stolons and roots and that mRNA accumulation and enzyme activity correlated positively
with tuber initiation and growth. In situ hybridization showed that Lox1-class transcripts
accumulated in the apical and subapical regions of the newly formed tuber and specifically
in the vascular tissue of the perimedullary region, the site of the most active cell growth
during tuber enlargement (Kolomiets et al., 2001). Suppression mutants produced by
expressing antisense coding sequence of a specific tuber LOX, designated POTLX-1,
exhibited a significant reduction in LOX activity in stolons and tubers. The suppression of
LOX activity correlated with reduced tuber yield and a disruption of tuber formation. No
morphological changes were observed in the vegetative shoots of any of the suppression
lines. These results indicate that the pathway initiated by the expression of the Lox1-class
genes of potato is involved in enhancing tuber enlargement.

Jasmonic and tuberonic acids are products of the 13-LOX pathway (Gardner, 1995).
Because the tuber LOXs have predominately 9-LOX activity (Royo et al., 1996), it is
possible that some of the 9-hydroperoxide derivatives may have a specific role, as yet
unclear, in the regulation of tuber growth. Hamberg (2000) identified a novel cyclopen-
tenone, 10-oxo-11-phytodienoic acid, produced by 9-LOX activity from young tubers,
that is an isomer of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, the precursor to jasmonic acid. This new
9-LOX cyclopentenone could be the precursor of an undiscovered compound similar to
tuberonic and jasmonic acids that regulates tuber growth. Low levels of expression of the
13-LOX of potato, designated H3, were detected in tubers (Royo et al., 1996). Transgenic
antisense plants of LOX-H3, however, exhibited an increase in tuber yield in plants with
suppressed H3 expression, indicating that LOX-H3 has no inductive role in the regulation
of tuber development (Royo et al., 1999).

12.4 GENE ACTIVITY DURING EARLY TUBER FORMATION

To examine gene expression during the early stages of tuber formation, in conjunction
with The Institute For Genomic Research (TIGR) Potato Genomics Project, microar-
ray analysis was performed on RNAs extracted from stolon tips grown under SD

246

(cid:2)

photoperiodic conditions. Tissue culture stock plants of S. tuberosum ssp. andigena
were grown in soil in growth chambers under either SD (inductive conditions) or SD
plus a 60-min night break (noninductive conditions) with 22/18
C day/night temper-
atures. Stolon tip samples, approximately 2.0 cm in length, from plants grown under
both photoperiods were harvested at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 days after the beginning of the
photoperiod regime. Visible tuber formation under these SD conditions was observed at
10–12 days. The experiment consisted of two biological replicates with two hybridiza-
tions per replicate. Lighting in the replicate growth chambers consisted of twelve 110-W
fluorescent bulbs and four 25-W incandescent bulbs. RNA from plants exposed to the
night break at each timepoint was used as the control hybridization probe and the SD
samples as the test probe. Microarray data were scanned, normalized and catalogued
by using the Gene Traffic software package (http://pga.swmed.edu/gene_traffic_2.htm).
The potato microarray chip contained 12 000 cDNA clones and was made avail-
able by the Potato TIGR project. The gene list and microarray data are available at
http://www.tigr.org/tdb/potato/.

There is very little difference in gene activity in stolon tips grown under inductive and
noninductive conditions up to day 8 (Fig. 12.4). From day 8 to 16, over 600 genes are up-
or down-regulated more than twofold. This coincides with the visible onset of swelling in
the stolon tip. As expected, a number of genes involved in the synthesis and processing
of starch are activated to very high levels (Fig. 12.5A). GA- and auxin-activated genes
are repressed in their expression, whereas a cytokinin-induced gene exhibited enhanced
expression (Fig. 12.5B and C). Numerous TFs are regulated, and an example of several

12.5 THE ROLE OF SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS IN TUBER

DEVELOPMENT

12.5.1 A MADS box protein that regulates axillary branching and affects tuber

formation

MADS box genes are an example of a family of highly conserved TFs that have diverse
roles in plant development. Although these TFs play a pivotal role in determining floral
organ identity (Weigel and Meyerowitz, 1994; Theißen, 2001), they are also important
regulators of vegetative development. POTM1 (potato MADS box, GenBank accession
number U23757) is a member of the SQUA-like family of plant MADS box genes isolated
from an early-stage tuber cDNA library (Kang and Hannapel, 1995) and is expressed in
apical and axillary meristems. Transgenic lines with reduced levels of POTM1 mRNA
exhibited decreased apical dominance accompanied by a compact growth habit and a
reduction in leaf size. Suppression lines produced truncated, shoot clusters from stem buds
(Fig. 12.7) and, in a model system, exhibited enhanced axillary bud growth instead of
producing a tuber (Rosin et al., 2003b). Cytokinin levels in these axillary buds increased
twofold to threefold, leading to the activation of cell division and starch accumulation
(Rosin et al., 2003b). These results imply that POTM1 mediates the control of axillary
bud development by regulating cell growth in vegetative meristems, including stolon tips.
Suppression of POTM1 led to activation of branching and an approximately sevenfold
reduction in tuber yield (Rosin et al., 2003b).

Fig. 12.7. Suppression of POTM1 RNA accumulation alters shoot morphology. Suppression lines of POTM1
exhibited shoot clusters growing from the axillary buds of stems. Growth of these axillary buds was prolific,
but limited, forming a dense cluster of truncated shoots and stolons as well as small tubers.

12.5.2 Transcription factors from the TALE superclass

Another important family of TFs involved in regulating the developmental events in apical
meristems is the knox (knotted-like homeobox) gene family (Reiser et al., 2000). Knox genes
belong to the group of TFs known as the three amino acid loop extension (TALE) superclass
(Bürglin, 1997). These TFs are distinguished by a very high level of sequence conservation
in the DNA-binding region, designated the homeodomain, and consist of three (cid:5)-helices
similar to the bacterial helix–loop–helix motif (Kerstetter et al., 1994). The third helix,
the recognition helix, is involved in DNA-binding (Mann and Chan, 1996). TALE TFs
contain a TALE, proline–tyrosine–proline, between helices I and II in the homeodomain
that has been implicated in protein interactions (Passner et al., 1999). There are numerous
TFs from plants and animals in the TALE superclass, and the two main groups in plants
are the KNOX and BEL types (Bürglin, 1997). From early tuber cDNA libraries of potato,
we have isolated two groups of TFs, KNOX and BEL types, that physically interact (Chen
et al., 2003). BEL-type proteins are involved in floral architecture and development in
several plant species (Smith and Hake, 2003; Bhatt et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2004).

12.5.3 Overexpression of POTH1 negatively regulates GA levels

The KNOX protein of potato, designated POTH1 (GenBank accession number U65648),
regulates plant growth by controlling GA synthesis (Rosin et al., 2003a). Transgenic
overexpression of POTH1 produced plants that were characterized by distorted, smaller
leaves and reduced internode lengths (Rosin et al., 2003a). Both internode length and
overall plant height were reduced approximately threefold in these mutant plants relative
to controls. The mutant leaf traits are designated ‘mouse-ear’ or ‘curled’ phenotype as
reported previously in other knox mutants (Parnis et al., 1997; Tamaoki et al., 1997).
Application of GA3 produced a partial reversal of the leaf phenotype and completely
rescued the dwarf phenotype (Rosin et al., 2003a).

Because of the similarity of this POTH1 phenotype to those reported in tobacco
(Tanaka-Ueguchi et al., 1998; Tamaoki et al., 1999), we examined the effect of GA20
oxidase mRNA accumulation in these POTH1 overexpressers. GA20 oxidase is a key
biosynthetic enzyme in the GA pathway, catalyzing the conversion of GA53 to GA20
through GA44 and GA19 (Heddens and Kamiya, 1997). GA 20-oxidase1 mRNA was
decreased in shoots of these overexpression lines. Biochemical analysis showed that the
levels of GA53 and GA19 increased, whereas the levels of GA20 and GA1 decreased in
shoot tips of these plants (Rosin et al., 2003a).

12.5.4 POTH1 protein interacts with seven unique potato BEL transcription

factors

Making use of the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation, the interaction of the
POTH1 protein with all seven members of the BEL1 family of TFs in potato was verified
(Chen et al., 2003). Using deletion mutant analysis, we identified the first 80 amino acids
of the BELL domain (Bellaoui et al., 2001) as the region involved in protein interaction
with POTH1 (Chen et al., 2003). The existence of so many unique BEL partners that bind

Signalling the induction of tuber formation

251

to POTH1 implies that they are involved in a complex system of developmental control
in potato. One of the BEL1 partners, StBEL5 (GenBank accession number AF406697),
consistently exhibited enhanced RNA levels in stems, leaves and stolons (but not roots)
in response to a SD photoperiod (Chen et al., 2003). In situ hybridization results have
placed the RNA of both POTH1 and StBEL5 in the vascular tissue of tuberizing meristems
(D.J. Hannapel and A.K. Banerjee, unpublished data).

12.5.5 Over-expression of POTH1 and StBEL5 produces an enhanced capacity

to form tubers

Overexpression of StBEL5 produced transgenic plants with an enhanced capacity to form
tubers (Chen et al., 2003). These StBEL5 sense lines were able to produce more tubers at
a faster rate than controls under both inductive (SD) and noninductive (LD) conditions on
soil- and in vitro-grown plants. POTH1 also enhanced tuber formation when overexpressed
in transgenic plants (Rosin et al., 2003a). StBEL5 lines exhibited normal leaf and stem and
actually grew faster than controls, with select lines exhibiting as much as a 50% increase
in the rate of growth (Chen et al., 2003). These results indicate that POTH1 and StBEL5
may act through an identical signalling pathway to mediate tuber formation. The interaction
between KNOX and BEL proteins appears to be ubiquitous in the plant kingdom (Bellaoui
et al., 2001; Müller et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2002).

12.5.6 Mechanism for transcription factors in regulating tuberization

Our results indicate that these molecular switches control growth by modulating levels
of phytohormones. For POTM1, suppression results in an increase in cytokinin levels.
For StBEL5 and POTH1, overexpression results in an increase in cytokinins (Table 12.1)
and a reduction in GA (Fig. 12.8). Clearly the effect on cytokinin levels, for at least
the POTM1 suppression lines, resulted in disrupted source/sink relations in these lines.
Starch accumulation occurred in leaves and axillary buds in preference to the normal sink
of a forming tuber. This abnormal preferential redistribution of photosynthate resulted in
reduced tuber yields. StBEL5 and POTH1 appear to affect tuber growth by lowering GA
levels and activating cell growth with increased cytokinins in the stolon tip.

Owing to the presence of conserved DNA-binding domains for the three families of
TFs described here, it is very likely that these proteins target specific genes to regulate
their expression. DNA-binding assays demonstrated that StBEL5 and POTH1 bind to
the regulatory region of ga20 oxidase1 from potato, a gene encoding a key enzyme
in the GA biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 12.9). In tandem, StBEL5 and POTH1 had a

greater binding affinity for the ga20 oxidase1 promoter than either protein alone (Chen
et al., 2004). The StBEL5-POTH1 heterodimer bound specifically to a composite 10-bp
sequence, containing two TTGAC cores in the P1 region of the promoter (Fig. 12.9).
Transcription assays with the BEL and KNOX proteins indicate that, in tandem, they
bind specific DNA sequences of ga20 oxidase1 to repress its activity by more than 50%
(Fig. 12.10). These results indicate that the tandem interaction of StBEL5 and POTH1 is
essential for regulation of the expression of their target gene, ga20 oxidase1. In summary,
POTH1/StBEL5 regulation on gene activity involves both protein/protein interaction
and protein/DNA interaction (Fig. 12.11). The control of tuberization is mediated by
a pathway that activates growth in the subapical region of the stolon tip. Cytokinins
enhance cell division, and decreased GA levels favour radial growth over elongation of
the stolon tip. POTM1 is putatively involved in regulating genes involved in cytokinin
synthesis in specific meristematic cells, whereas the tandem StBEL5/POTH1 complex
mediates an increase in cytokinin synthesis and a decrease in GA synthesis by targeting
the promoters of specific genes. Based on the microarray results, however, it is clear that
numerous other TFs and signalling molecules, such as micro-RNAs and flowering-time
gene products, are likely involved in the pathways that regulate the initial stages of tuber
formation.

Fig. 12.10. The repression effect of StBEL5 and POTH1 on the ga20 oxidase1 promoter in tobacco protoplasts.
The ga20 oxidase1 promoter (1028 nt) drives beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression. The construct with the
luciferase (LUC) gene under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter was used as control.
Protein effector constructs were generated by using pBI221 vector as a backbone, with the GUS gene replaced
by the full-length cDNAs of either StBEL5 or POTH1. The protoplasts were subjected to electroporation with
the various mixtures of plasmid DNA. Transfections were performed three times for each effector combination.
Relative GUS-LUC activity was calculated by dividing the ratio of GUS activity to LUC activity from different
effectors with the ratio from reporter plasmid alone. No suppression of transcription was observed with the
CaMV 35S/GUS construct. Relative activities calculated from three transfection replications were presented as
a mean ± SE[Source: Chen et al. (2004)].

13.1 INTRODUCTION

All biomass production depends on photosynthesis. Plants assimilate CO2 from the atmo-
sphere and reduce it to the level of triose phosphates, which can then be used to produce
carbohydrates, mainly sucrose and starch. Photosynthetic carbon assimilation provides
the driving force for biomass production but is only one of many factors influencing plant
growth and development. There are other critical steps, such as sucrose synthesis and
transport from the mesophyll tissue, phloem transport and carbon partitioning throughout
the plant, that have considerable impact on these processes. Complex regulatory networks
allow parallel responses to changes in environmental, metabolic and physiological limita-
tions. The widespread adoption of transgenic approaches since the early 1990s has greatly
advanced our understanding about the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, and the
potato (Solanum tuberosum) represents a particularly well-characterized example for this
central part of plant metabolism.

Past improvements of yield potential have been derived largely from an increase in the
proportion of accumulated dry weight which is invested into harvestable organs, i.e. the
harvest index. In case of the potato, the harvest index has been increased from 0.09
in wild species to up to 0.81 in modern cultivars (Inoue and Tanaka, 1978). In plants,
carbohydrates are produced in photosynthetically active tissues, primarily in the chloro-
plast containing cells of leaves. The conversion of photoassimilates into sucrose allows
the transport via the phloem from these source tissues to support the growth of sink
tissues such as roots or developing tubers which themselves are unable to produce assim-
ilates. During development, sink-to-source ratios change, which implies that assimilate
production must be adjusted to the changing needs of distant tissues. Past research
has greatly advanced our understanding of the factors controlling the synthesis of car-
bohydrates and their partitioning within and between organs. In particular, the use of
transgenic plants altered in the activity of single enzymes provided important infor-
mation concerning metabolic control steps but also revealed the enormous flexibility
of plant metabolism often bypassing single-site manipulations through the induction of

alternative pathways. Thus, a successful manipulation of biochemical pathways requires
a thorough understanding of the regulatory properties of individual enzymes as well as
of the regulatory networks linking entire pathways. In this chapter, we summarize the
current understanding of the central pathways of carbohydrate metabolism, including cur-
rent hypotheses concerning possible mechanisms underlying source-to-sink interactions
involving sugars as signalling molecules.

13.2 PHOTOSYNTHETIC CARBON METABOLISM

13.2.1 CO2 fixation

During photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy, namely ATP and
NADPH, which is then used to reduce atmospheric CO2 to carbohydrates via the reductive
pentose phosphate (RPP) cycle (or Calvin cycle). The overall reaction can be described
as the fixation of three molecules of CO2 into a three-carbon sugar phosphate, triose-P,
with the incorporation of one molecule of inorganic phosphate (Pi). To remobilize Pi,
which is sequestered in the direct products of photosynthesis, assimilates are converted
either to sucrose in the cytosol or to transitory starch, which is synthesized in the plastids
and remobilized during periods when photosynthesis does not occur. The reactions of the
Calvin cycle occur in the chloroplast stroma, and the cycle itself comprises 13 reactions
catalysed by 11 enzymes (Fig. 13.1). Three phases can be distinguished:

(1) Carboxylation: Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) cataly-
ses the addition of CO2 to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) yielding two molecules
of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).

(2) Reduction of the two molecules of 3-PGA to triose-P at the expense of two ATP and
two NADPH molecules. This reaction is catalysed by the successive action of two
enzymes, 3-PGA kinase (PGK) and NADP:glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydroge-
nase (NADP:GAPDH).

(3) Regeneration of the primary acceptor, RuBP, from triose-P, by which five C3
molecules are rearranged to three C5 molecules. Each molecule of ribose-5-P must
be converted to ribulose-5-P, which is, in turn, converted to RuBP at the expense of a
molecule of ATP. Each molecule of CO2 fixed in the Calvin cycle therefore requires
three ATP and two NADPH to be provided by photosynthetic electron transport.

Although the activity of the Calvin cycle could in principle be merely governed by
the availability of ATP and NADPH, provided by the light reaction, interaction between
CO2 fixation and photosynthetic electron transport occurs at multiple levels. Several
enzymes of the Calvin cycle are subject to light/dark regulation. Light-dependent acti-
vation of these enzymes occurs rapidly upon illumination through a process that is
coupled to photosynthetic electron transport via a ferredoxin/thioredoxin soluble electron
transport system (Buchanan, 1980). Activation of target enzymes occurs when specific
disulphide bonds (between sulphide groups contained in cysteine residues of the polypep-
tide) are reduced and hence cleaved. This is accomplished through reduced thioredoxin,

which in turn is reduced by reduced ferredoxin, and the reaction is catalysed by the
enzyme ferredoxin–thioredoxin reductase. Ferredoxin itself is reduced by the electron
transport chain, and hence, illumination brings about the rapid activation of several
Calvin cycle enzymes including fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), sedoheptulose-
1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase), GAPDH and R5P kinase. Another level of regulation is
represented by light-driven changes in stromal pH and Mg2+
concentration. For example,
the pH of the darkened stroma is around 7 with an Mg2+
concentration of 1–3 mM,
whereas the pH is around 8 and the Mg2+
concentration 3–6 mM in the illuminated
stroma. These electron-transport-driven changes in the stromal environment are close
to the optimum for the operation of the enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle. Photo-
synthetic carbon fixation is also regulated at the level of Rubisco activation. Enzyme
activity requires that Mg2+
and CO2 be bound to a lysine residue adjacent to the active
site (carbamoylation). RuBP binds very tightly to the non-carbamoylated (inactive) form
of Rubisco; this prevents carbamoylation of the enzyme and renders it effectively inac-
tive until displaced (Portis, 1992). Furthermore, another naturally occurring inhibitor of
Rubisco has been identified (2-carboxy-arabinitol-1-phosphate, CA1P) that is found in
abundance during the night and is degraded during the photoperiod (Portis, 1992). This
nocturnal inhibitor also binds tightly to the active site of Rubisco. Displacement of these
inhibitory molecules is required to restore enzymatic activity. This is brought about by

260

Hofius and Börnke

the activity of an enzyme called Rubisco activase (Portis, 1995). The process requires
ATP and is inhibited by ADP; hence, the activation of Rubisco is in part dependent on
the availability of ATP generated during photosynthetic electron transport (Portis, 1995).

13.2.2 Carbon partitioning in mesophyll cells

The principal product of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in the chloroplast is triose-P.
This can be either exported to the cytosol to make soluble sugars or retained within the
chloroplast to be fed into starch synthesis or to regenerate RuBP, respectively (Fig. 13.2).
The rate of consumption of triose-P by either of these pathways has to be balanced with the
momentary rate of photosynthesis to ensure that the correct proportion is cycled back into
RuBP. Therefore, communication between the stromal compartment of the chloroplasts
and the cytosol is essential for adjusting the rate of photosynthesis to the demands of
various parts of the plants for photoassimilates. This communication is supposed to take
place at the membrane system of the chloroplast. Two membranes enclose the plastidic
stroma, an outer membrane that is permeable with an exclusion limit of 10 kDa and an

inner membrane that controls the substances entering and leaving the plastid. A specific
transport system, the triose-P translocator (TPT), located in the inner membrane of the
chloroplast envelope catalyses the export of triose-P into the cytosol in strict counter
exchange for Pi (Flügge and Heldt, 1991). The rate of triose-P export catalysed by
the TPT is thought to be primarily regulated by cytosolic processes liberating Pi from
phosphorylated intermediates, particularly by sucrose synthesis (Stitt and Quick, 1989).
When the export of triose-P from the chloroplasts is limited by the availability of cytosolic
Pi, for example, due to decreased sucrose synthesis, fixed carbon can be deposited in the
chloroplasts in the form of transitory starch. The TPT gene is nuclear encoded and the
respective cDNA has been cloned from potato (Schulz et al., 1993), among other plant
species. In accordance with the role of the protein in photosynthetic carbon metabolism,
expression of the TPT gene was predominantly observed in green (chloroplast-containing)
tissues and was shown to be light-responsive.

Transgenic potato plants transformed with the TPT cDNA in antisense orientation
expressed under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter displayed a reduction
in transport activity by approximately 30% (Riesmeier et al., 1993a). Under ambient light
and CO2 conditions, reduced TPT activity did neither impair photosynthesis nor affect
growth and tuber yield. However, a detailed physiological analysis of the plants revealed
profound changes in the allocation of carbohydrates and the distribution of metabolites
between chloroplast and cytosol. The reduction of export of triose-P led to a three- to
four-fold increase in starch accumulation during the day. This increase in starch synthesis
and the resulting release of Pi within the chloroplast avoid Pi-limitation of photosynthesis
and thus metabolically compensate for the reduced levels of TPT (Heineke et al., 1994).
Moreover, the surplus starch, accumulated during the light period, was efficiently degraded
during the night. Because starch degradation results partly in the release of glucose or
maltose, sugars not requiring TPT activity to be exported from the chloroplast, the reduced
availability of carbohydrates during the day is compensated for by an increased export
rate during the night and thus prevents stronger phenotypic effects (Heineke et al., 1994).
Taken together, the studies on transgenic potato plants with reduced TPT activity have
established the central role of this translocator in the integration of assimilate partitioning
during photosynthesis; however, they also demonstrate the enormous flexibility of plant
metabolism, allowing the induction of metabolic bypasses in many cases.

13.2.3 Sucrose biosynthesis in source leaves

As outlined in the previous section, triose-P leaving the Calvin cycle can be exported
from the plastid into the cytosol via the TPT and is then distributed between glycolysis
and amino acid, lipid and sucrose biosynthesis (Fig. 13.2). Sucrose is the major transport
form of carbohydrates in most higher plants and as such forms the interface between
photosynthetically active source tissue and heterotrophic sink tissue, where it serves as
an energy source for growth and development or feeds into the synthesis of storage
compounds such as starch. Starting from triose-P, the sucrose biosynthetic pathway
comprises seven enzymatic steps. The genes for all enzymes involved have been isolated
from potato, and the in planta function of most of them has been assessed by reverse

262

Hofius and Börnke

genetic studies. The entry molecule is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), which is produced
from the condensation of two molecules of triose-P catalysed by the enzyme aldolase. In a
subsequent reaction, a phosphate group is cleaved from the C1 carbon by FBPase to yield
fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). This reaction is essentially irreversible and is supposed to
represent one of the key regulatory steps within the pathway of sucrose synthesis. Glucose-
6-phosphate (G6P) and glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) are maintained in equilibrium with
the F6P pool by the action of phosphoglucoseisomerase (PGI) and phosphoglucomutase
(PGM), respectively. Uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-Glc) and pyrophosphate are then
formed from uridine triphosphate (UTP) and G1P catalysed by the enzyme UDP-glucose-
pyrophosphorylase (UGPase). UDP-Glc is then combined with F6P to form sucrose-
6-phosphate (Suc6P), catalysed by sucrose-6-phosphate synthase (SPS); subsequently,
Suc6P is hydrolysed to form sucrose by a specific sucrose-6-phosphate phosphatase (SPP).
The reaction catalysed by SPP is essentially irreversible and displaces the reversible SPS
reaction from equilibrium into the direction of net sucrose synthesis (Stitt et al., 1987).
SPS has been identified as the second major control point of the whole pathway, and the
enzyme is subject to a complex regulation on multiple levels.

13.2.3.1 Regulatory enzymes of the pathway

In source leaves, sucrose synthesis has to be balanced with the momentary rate of photo-
synthesis. If sucrose synthesis is too fast, photosynthesis is inhibited because intermediates
are withdrawn from the Calvin cycle too rapidly and RuBP regeneration is inhibited (Stitt
et al., 1987). If sucrose synthesis is too slow, Pi is sequestered from the chloroplast into
phosphorylated intermediates, and ATP synthesis, PGA production and photosynthesis
are inhibited (Stitt et al., 1987).

Three enzymes of the pathway of sucrose synthesis are known to catalyse reactions
removed from thermodynamic equilibrium in vivo. At these sites, the flux depends on the
current activity of the enzyme, and such enzymes also often possess regulatory properties,
including allosteric regulation and/or post-translational regulation, so they are viewed
as potential control sites. The current view of how sucrose synthesis is regulated by
coordination of these enzymatic activities is discussed below.

Cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Cytosolic FBPase (cytFBPase) irreversibly con-
verts F1,6BP into F6P and thus catalyses the first committed step in the pathway of sucrose
synthesis. The enzyme is also active in non-photosynthetic tissues where it controls the
rate of F6P production in the gluconeogenetic pathway. Its crucial role for photosyn-
thetic carbon partitioning has been established in mutant Flaveria linearis plants with a
reduction of cytFBPase activity of 75% (Sharkey et al., 1988) and in transgenic potato
plants expressing an antisense FBPase gene under control of the CaMV 35S promoter
(Zrenner et al., 1996). The analysis of the transgenic potato plants revealed that 45%
reduction of the cytFBPase activity did not cause any measurable change in metabolite
concentrations, growth behaviour or photosynthetic parameters of the transgenic plants
(Zrenner et al., 1996). The inhibition of cytFBPase activity below 20% of the wild-type
activity led to an accumulation of triose-P, 3-PGA and F1,6BP in source leaves. This
resulted in a reduced light-saturated assimilation rate and a decreased photosynthetic rate

Photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and source–sink relations

263

under light- and CO2-saturated conditions. The measurement of photosynthetic carbon
fluxes under these conditions revealed a 53–65% reduction of sucrose synthesis, whereas
starch synthesis decreased only around 20%. Despite these changes, steady-state sucrose
levels were not affected in cytFBPase antisense plants. Starch accumulated by a factor of
3 as compared with the wild type and was degraded during the night. This situation very
much resembles that observed in TPT antisense potato plants (see 13.2.2; Riesmeier et al.,
1993a) in that the surplus of starch accumulated during the day was efficiently mobilized
during the night, thereby circumventing the limitation of sucrose synthesis caused by a
reduced cytFBPase activity (Zrenner et al., 1996).

The biochemical properties of the cytFBPase are highly complex and involve the action
of several regulatory metabolites (Stitt, 1990; Daie, 1993). In the absence of effector
= 4–6 (cid:3)M(cid:4). It
molecules, the enzyme has a high affinity for its substrate F1,6BP (cid:2)Km
is strictly Mg2+
dependent, weakly inhibited by F6P, Pi and adenosine monophosphate
(AMP) and strongly inhibited by the regulatory metabolite fructose-2,6-bisphosphate
(F2,6BP). F2,6BP is an important regulator of FBPase activity in mesophyll cells, and
nano-to-micromolecular concentrations of the molecule are effective in substantially low-
ering the affinity of FBPase to its substrate F1,6BP. The concentration of F2,6BP is
determined by the relative in vivo activities of fructose-6-phosphate,2-kinase (F6P,2-K)
and fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F2,6BPase). Both of these activities reside on a bifunc-
tional enzyme (F2KP), which in potato appears to be encoded by a single gene (Draborg
et al., 1999; Nielsen et al., 2004). The ratio between the two enzymatic activities is
allosterically regulated by metabolites representing intermediates of primary metabolism
(Villadsen and Nielsen, 2001). F6P,2-K activity is enhanced by F6P and Pi and is inhib-
ited by 3-PGA and triose-P, whereas F2,6BP activity is inhibited by F6P and Pi. Upon
the onset of photosynthesis, rising 3-PGA and triose-P and decreasing Pi lead to a rapid
decline in F2,6BP levels which, together with rising F1,6BP, stimulate cytFBPase. In
addition to allosteric control by metabolites, F2KP from Arabidopsis has recently been
shown to be subject to post-translational control by phosphorylation and binding of 14-3-3
proteins (Kulma et al., 2004). Phosphorylation and binding of 14-3-3 proteins regulate
the activity of enzymes such as nitrate reductase and SPS. Although the mechanism of
F2KP regulation by these post-translational events is currently unknown, it appears to
link the regulation of key metabolic enzymes.

Studies on transgenic plants with modified F2,6BP levels have enabled a closer eval-
uation of the in vivo function of this signal metabolite. Potato and Arabidopsis plants
harbouring F2KP antisense constructs have a decreased F2,6BP content and display
changes in photosynthetic carbon partitioning in favour of sucrose, increasing the sucrose
to starch ratio in 14CO2-labelling experiments at least two-fold (Draborg et al., 2001;
Rung et al., 2004). In Arabidopsis, this resulted in a 20–30% higher level of sucrose and
a delay in diurnal starch accumulation (Draborg et al., 2001). However, in potato, the
extra sucrose was mainly cleaved and hexoses accumulated in the leaves (Rung et al.,
2004). All these studies prove that F2,6BP contributes significantly to the regulation of
leaf carbon partitioning during photosynthesis.

SPS and SPP. The last two steps in the synthesis of sucrose are unique to the pathway;
they are catalysed by SPS and SPP. Owing to the rapid removal of Suc6P by SPP, the
reaction catalysed by SPS is considerably displaced from equilibrium in vivo (Stitt et al.,

264

Hofius and Börnke

1987), and thus, it is thought that SPS activity contributes to the control of flux into
sucrose. SPS is regulated in a sophisticated manner by various mechanisms that operate
at different levels and in different time frames (Stitt et al., 1987; Huber and Huber,
1996; Winter and Huber, 2000). Gene transcription is developmentally regulated and
can be influenced by environmental factors such as light. Allosteric regulation, involv-
ing activation by G6P and inhibition by Pi, allows sucrose synthesis to be immediately
increased in response to the increasing availability of precursors. SPS is also regulated
by protein phosphorylation on multiple serine residues (McMichael et al., 1993; Toroser
et al., 1998, 1999). Phosphorylation of serine-158 (Ser158) of the spinach enzyme leads
to a reduced substrate (F6P) and effector (G6P) affinity and most likely is responsible for
the light/dark regulation of the enzyme, which is thought to be one of the mechanisms
to adjust the capacity for sucrose biosynthesis in relation to the rate of photosynthesis
(McMichael et al., 1993). After the onset of photosynthesis, rising G6P and falling Pi acti-
vate SPS allosterically, and rising G6P inhibits SPS-kinase leading to dephosphorylation
and post-translational activation of SPS (Huber and Huber, 1996). SPS dephosphorylation
is further promoted by light-dependent stimulation of SPS-phosphatase (Weiner et al.,
1992). Phosphorylation of Ser424 activates the enzyme and might be involved in the
activation of SPS during osmotic stress (Toroser and Huber, 1997).

Besides the two phosphorylation sites discussed above, additional phosphorylation
site(s) are proposed to be involved in the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to SPS. 14-3-3
proteins constitute a highly conserved eukaryotic family of regulatory proteins, binding
as dimers to phosphorylated motifs in their diverse target proteins, generally functioning
as adaptors, chaperones, activators or repressors (Aitken, 1996; Fu et al., 2000; Roberts,
2000). A phospho-peptide comprising the sequence surrounding Ser229 of SPS from
spinach has been shown to bind 14-3-3s in vitro (Toroser et al., 1998), but it is not
yet known whether this site is involved in the SPS:14-3-3 interaction in vivo, because
substitution of Ser229 by alanine does not affect 14-3-3 binding to SPS in the yeast
two-hybrid system (Börnke, 2005). The effect on SPS activity of binding of a 14-3-3 is
also not clear. Both partial inhibition of the enzyme (Toroser et al., 1998) and activation
(Moorhead et al., 1999) have been reported. Alternatively, 14-3-3 binding may modulate
the rate of proteolytic degradation of SPS in response to changes in cellular carbohydrate
status (Cotelle et al., 2000). Future experiments will have to clarify the function of
14-3-3 binding to SPS and whether binding is involved in signal transduction processes
regulating sucrose synthesis in source leaves according to sink demand.

The role of SPP in the regulation of photosynthetic carbon partitioning has been
relatively neglected. Earlier reports that SPP activity in vivo is substantially higher than
SPS activity suggested that SPP is unlikely to play a regulatory role in sucrose synthesis
(Hawker and Smith, 1984). However, recent evidence that SPS and SPP might form a
complex in vivo (Echeverria et al., 1997) opened the possibility that SPP could have a
role in metabolite channelling between the two enzymes and thus could contribute to
control of flux through the pathway. It was not until recently that the enzyme has been
purified to homogeneity from rice leaves and the gene cloned (Lunn et al., 2000). Genes
encoding SPP-like sequences have as yet been described from several plant species,
including Arabidopsis, maize, rice, tomato, potato, tobacco and wheat (Lunn, 2003; Chen
et al., 2005), and it appears that they encode small gene families with, for example, four

Photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and source–sink relations

265

members in Arabidopsis and three in rice, respectively (Lunn, 2003). A recent study on
transgenic tobacco plants expressing an SPP RNA-interference construct revealed that
SPP is abundant in source leaves and does not exert significant control of sucrose synthesis
under normal conditions (Chen et al., 2005). The SPP activity in those transformants
could be reduced to less than 10% of wild-type SPP activity before any effect on sucrose
biosynthesis and photosynthetic carbon partitioning was observed. Similar results have
been obtained in potato plants with reduced SPP activity in their source leaves (Chen and
Börnke, unpublished).

13.3 STARCH METABOLISM IN SOURCE LEAVES

13.3.1 Starch synthesis within the chloroplast

As much as half of the triose-P produced during photosynthesis may be retained in the
chloroplast to synthesize starch. Leaf starch represents a transient store for assimilates,
which is mobilized during the night to support leaf metabolism, and continued synthesis
and export of sucrose (Geiger and Servaites, 1994). Regulation of sucrose synthesis in the
cytosol is the critical factor in determining the supply of triose-P available for allocation
to starch during photosynthesis (Stitt and Quick, 1989). A consensus has developed that
leaf starch synthesis is regulated by changes in the levels of phosphorylated metabolites
and Pi that are generated when the rate of photosynthesis increases or when rising levels
of sugars lead to feedback regulation of sucrose synthesis.

Starch synthesis requires three consecutive enzymatic reactions catalysed by ADP-
glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), starch synthase (SS) and starch branching enzyme
(SBE) (Martin and Smith, 1995). The first committed step in the pathway of starch
synthesis is the formation of ADP-glucose (ADP-Glc) from G1P and ATP in a reaction
that is catalysed by AGPase and liberates pyrophosphate. In chloroplasts, ATP is derived
from photosynthesis, and G1P can be supplied by the Calvin cycle via the plastidial
isoforms of PGI and PGM. The pyrophosphate that is produced during the reaction is
removed by an inorganic alkaline pyrophosphatase (PPase) which effectively displaces
the equilibrium of the AGPase reaction in favour of AGPGlc production.

Potato AGPase, as the enzyme from other higher plants, is a heterotetramer that contains
two ‘regulatory’ (AGPS, 51 kDa) and two slightly smaller ‘catalytic’ (AGPB, 50 kDa)
subunits (Okita et al., 1990). AGPase is exquisitely sensitive to allosteric regulation, with
3-PGA acting as an activator and Pi as an inhibitor (Preiss, 1988). This ensures that
the rate of starch synthesis is always balanced with other pathways consuming triose-P,
especially sucrose synthesis in the cytosol. For example, feedback regulation of sucrose
synthesis will lead to the accumulation of phosphorylated intermediates, depletion of
Pi and activation of AGPase by the rising 3-PGA:Pi ratio, resulting in a compensatory
stimulation of starch synthesis (Herold, 1980; Stitt et al., 1987). A number of recent studies
reported that AGPase is subject to post-translational regulation in non-photosynthetic and
photosynthetic tissues in a range of plant species (Fu et al., 1998; Tiessen et al., 2002;
Hendriks et al., 2003). This mechanism involves the redox-regulated formation of an
intermolecular Cys bridge between the AGPB subunits of the AGPase heterotetramer.

266

Hofius and Börnke

Monomerization as a response to light or rising sugar levels leads to an activation of the
enzyme. It is assumed that the main significance of the allosteric control of AGPase by
the 3-PGA:Pi ratio is to rapidly increase Pi recycling in the stroma in case of a transient
imbalance between photosynthesis and triose-P export (Hendriks et al., 2003). The redox
regulation of AGPase seems more likely to participate in the direct light activation of
starch synthesis and allows AGPase activity to be stimulated in response to rising sugar
levels in leaves (Hendriks et al., 2003).
SSs catalyse the transfer of the glucosyl moiety of the soluble precursor AGPGlc to the
reducing end of a pre-existing (cid:5)(cid:2)1 → 4(cid:4)-linked glucan primer to synthesize the insoluble
glucan polymers amylose and amylopectin. SBE then forms the (cid:5)(cid:2)1 → 6(cid:4) linkages found
in amylopectin by cleaving internal (cid:5)(cid:2)1→ 4(cid:4) bonds and transferring the released reducing
ends to other glucose residues (Martin and Smith, 1995; Tetlow et al., 2004).

13.3.2 Starch breakdown in leaves

The complex metabolic network regulating photoassimilate partitioning between the dif-
ferent pathways during the photoperiod and the regulatory properties of the enzymes
involved is fairly well characterized. What is surprising is the lack of understanding
how transitory starch is remobilized at night and how this process is regulated. Recently,
considerable progress has been made in understanding starch degradation in leaves (for a
recent review, see Lloyd et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2005), and the current understanding
of the pathway is summarized below.

The process of starch degradation is initiated by the release of soluble glucans from the
semi-crystalline starch granule surface. An essential prerequisite for starch mobilization
is the phosphorylation of a small proportion of the glucosyl residues, catalysed by the
enzyme glucan–water dikinase (GWD, formerly known as R1; Lorberth et al., 1998; Ritte
et al., 2002). GWD transfers the (cid:6)-phosphate of ATP to either the C3 or the C6 position
of the glucosyl residue of amylopectin (Ritte et al., 2002). Reduction of GWD activity in
transgenic potato and Arabidopsis plants, respectively, leads to decreased starch phosphate
levels and causes a drastic starch-excess phenotype in leaves (Lorberth et al., 1998; Yu
et al., 2001). However, it is not yet known whether it is the starch-bound phosphate or
the GWD protein itself that is important in mediating starch breakdown.

Because of their role in cereal endosperm starch degradation,

it has long been
assumed that (cid:5)-amylases are important in initiating granule degradation in leaves (Beck
and Ziegler, 1989). (cid:5)-Amylases are endoamylolytic enzymes that hydrolyse the (cid:5)-1,4-
glucosidic linkages of starch. However, recent evidence from Arabidopsis suggests that
(cid:5)-amylases are dispensable for this process. T-DNA knockout mutants of AtAMY3, the
only (cid:5)-amylase isoform localized to the plastid, have the same diurnal pattern of transitory
starch metabolism as the wild type (Yu et al., 2005). Evidence from potato demonstrates
a role for (cid:6)-amylase in leaf starch degradation in this species (Scheidig et al., 2002).
(cid:6)-Amylases are exoamylases that yield maltose almost exclusively as a product. Down-
regulation of a plastidial isoform of (cid:6)-amylase in transgenic potato led to a reduction
in leaf starch degradation and a starch-excess phenotype. In addition, the recombinant
protein was shown to release maltose from starch granules (Scheidig et al., 2002).

Photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and source–sink relations

267

(cid:5)-Amylases and (cid:6)-amylases cleave (cid:5)-1,4 but not (cid:5)-1,6 bonds which represent between
4 and 5% of the linkages in amylopectin. The involvement of the so-called debranching
enzymes (DBEs) is therefore essential to ensure the complete breakdown of starch. DBEs
can be divided into two classes, isoamylases and limit dextrinases, both being hydrolases
whose activities lead to the release of linear malto-oligosaccharides (MOSs). These are
probably further metabolized by (cid:6)-amylases and a protein known as the disproportionating
enzyme (D-enzyme). The D-enzyme catalyses the transfer of (cid:5)-1,4-linked MOSs from
the end of one glucan chain to the end of another. It preferentially acts on maltotriose
transferring a maltosyl residue to an acceptor glucan while releasing glucose. According
to the current model, the D-enzyme metabolizes glucans that are too short for the actions
of other starch degrading enzymes, creating longer chains on which these enzymes can
act (Smith et al., 2003).

Alternatively to being broken down hydrolytically via (cid:6)-amylase, it has long been
hypothesized that starch breakdown occurs phosphorolytically by the action of (cid:5)-glucan
phosphorylase releasing G1P (Beck and Ziegler, 1989). G1P can then be converted to
triose-P and exported from the plastid via TPT (Häusler et al., 1998). Several lines of
evidence suggest that this is not the case. For instance, antisense repression of TPT in
potato and tobacco demonstrated that reduced TPT activity was correlated with increased
transitory starch synthesis and increased capacity of the hydrolytic pathway (see 13.2.2;
Riesmeier et al., 1993; Häusler et al., 1998). Moreover, transgenic potato plants with
antisense expression of cytFBPase do not export carbon from the leaves during the day
but store all assimilated carbon as starch. Starch is mobilized during the dark period using
a pathway not involving cytFBPase (Zrenner et al., 1996). These results indicate that
polyglucans are primarily broken down by amylolytic activity and that maltose might be
an important product of leaf starch degradation.

There is now strong evidence that maltose is the major metabolite exported from
chloroplasts during the night. Arabidopsis mutants lacking a plastidic maltose transporter
accumulate high levels of maltose in their leaves, are severely impaired in growth and
display a starch-excess phenotype (Niittylä et al., 2004). Genes encoding maltose exporter
homologs appear to be present in a wide range of plant species (Niittylä et al., 2004)
including potato (e.g. GenBank accession CX162346).

In addition to the maltose produced by (cid:6)-amylase, glucose accumulates during starch
breakdown, produced by either D-enzyme acting on MOSs or (cid:6)-amylase acting on mal-
totriose. A specific transporter that could mediate glucose export from the plastid into
the cytosol has been identified in potato and several other plant species (Weber et al.,
2000), although studies concerning the in planta function of this protein are currently
lacking.

In Arabidopsis, maltose imported into the cytosol is further metabolized by a trans-
glucosidase named DPE2 because it shows the greatest similarity to the D-enzyme (Chia
et al., 2004). DPE2 catalyses the transfer of one of the glucosyl moieties of maltose to
branched polyglucans such as glycogen and releases the other as glucose. Arabidospsis
mutants carrying a knockout for DPE2 accumulate high levels of maltose and show
impaired starch breakdown, suggesting that metabolism via DPE2 is the major route for
maltose in the cytosol (Chia et al., 2004). Similar results have been obtained from trans-
genic potato plants in which the DPE2 protein was repressed using an RNAi construct

268

Hofius and Börnke

(Lloyd et al., 2004). However, the DPE2 protein of potato was reported to reside within
the chloroplast (Lloyd et al., 2004), whereas that of Arabidopsis was found to be in the
cytosol (Chia et al., 2004). A chloroplastic location for this transglucosidase would imply
a different, yet unknown, route for starch degradation to be present in potato.

13.4 CARBON EXPORT AND LONG-DISTANCE TRANSPORT

Sucrose is the major transported form of fixed carbon in plants. Its coordinated transloca-
tion to and partitioning between different heterotrophic tissues is essential for the supply
of carbon energy and carbon skeletons required to support growth and storage. Within the
leaf, sucrose is transported from the sites of synthesis across several cell layers towards the
vascular tissue where it is loaded into the minor veins of the phloem and then distributed
throughout the plant. Recent advance in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms
associated with sucrose transport and allocation in solanaceous species has been mainly
achieved by cloning and characterization of membrane transporters involved in phloem
loading (for recent reviews, see Kühn, 2003; Lalonde et al., 2003, 2004). Additionally,
new insights into the structure and function of plasmodesmata (PD) have expanded our
knowledge as to how these intercellular cytoplasmic channels may contribute to the con-
trol of symplastic assimilate transport and the regulation of carbon distribution between
source and sink (Lucas and Wolf, 1999; Schobert et al., 2000; Roberts and Oparka, 2003).

13.4.1 Pathway from the mesophyll to the phloem

Although direct evidence is still lacking, it is widely assumed that sucrose moves symplas-
tically via PD from mesophyll cells towards the minor vein tissue. Electron microscopic
observations of high plasmodesmal frequencies between cells along this route and microin-
jection studies with small fluorescent dyes suggested the potential for symplastic solute
transport at least to the bundle sheath/vascular parenchyma (BS/VP) cells (Robards and
Lucas, 1990). However, the presence of PD between individual cells does not necessarily
indicate that these intercellular channels are constantly available for solute movement. It
is now well established that PD undergo structural changes during sink–source transition
and that the formation of secondary branched PD in the mesophyll and minor veins
of exporting source tissue correlates with a decrease in plasmodesmal permeability and
transport capacity compared with simple PD of importing sink tissue (Ding et al., 1992;
Evert et al., 1996; Oparka et al., 1999; Oparka and Turgeon, 1999). Additionally, PD
are known to alter their conductivity in response to various abiotic and biotic stimuli
(summarized in Roberts and Oparka, 2003), which agrees with the recent finding that
the leaf contains a heterogenous mixture of cells where PD apertures fluctuate accord-
ing to changes in the environment (Crawford and Zambryski, 2001; Zambryski, 2004).
Thus, it is likely that changes in plasmodesmal permeability act as an important control
mechanism over the capacity of symplastic sucrose transport into the phloem.

Compelling evidence for this hypothesis has been provided by the analysis of viral
movement proteins (MPs), which are well known to interact with PD components and
to substantially increase the plasmodesmal size exclusion limits (SELs) (Lazarowitz and

Photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and source–sink relations

269

Beachy, 1999; Roberts and Oparka, 2003; Oparka, 2004). Ectopic expression of MPs
from various viruses in transgenic plants resulted in significant changes in carbohydrate
metabolism and biomass partitioning (Olesinski et al., 1995; Lucas et al., 1996; Shalitin
and Wolf, 2000; Hofius et al., 2001). For instance, sucrose transport and carbon allocation
were specifically altered in potato by expression of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-MP
under the control of tissue-specific promoters. Phloem-restricted expression of TMV-
MP in transgenic potato plants resulted in carbohydrate accumulation and decreased
sucrose export from source leaves (Almon et al., 1997), whereas mesophyll-specific
expression from the ST-LS1 (S. tuberosum Rubisco large subunit 1) promoter caused
lower carbohydrate contents and higher sucrose export rates (Olesinski et al., 1996).
Interestingly, these effects were in both cases under developmental control and observed
only after tuber initiation, giving rise to a model, in that MPs interfere with the symplastic
trafficking pathway for signal molecules involved in source–sink regulation (Lucas et al.,
1996; Lucas and Wolf, 1999).

Additional support for an important role of the symplastic pathway for assimilate
transport has previously been derived from the analysis of the sucrose export defective1
maize mutant, which exhibits stunted growth and carbohydrate accumulation in source
leaves paralleled by ultrastructural alterations and callose occlusion of PD between BS
and VP cells (Russin et al., 1996; Botha et al., 2000). This suggested an inhibition of
symplastic continuity at the BS/VP boundary leading to a block of sucrose transport into
the phloem. Surprisingly, cloning of the maize sxd1 locus and the respective orthologue
in Arabidopsis (vte1) revealed that sxd1 is not affected in a structural PD protein but
disrupted in a gene encoding tocopherol cyclase, which resulted in a complete absence
of tocopherols (Provencher et al., 2001; Porfirova et al., 2002; Sattler et al., 2003). Such
unexpected link between tocopherol deficiency, source leaf-specific callose occlusion of
PD and the subsequent blockage of carbohydrate export could also be demonstrated in
transgenic potato plants expressing an RNAi construct targeted at the potato sxd1 homolog
(Hofius et al., 2004). On the basis of these results, it was proposed that tocopherol
deficiency may indirectly affect callose synthesis and assimilate transport capacity by
disturbance of cell-redox homeostasis and membrane lipid peroxidation (Hofius et al.,
2004; Munné-Bosch, 2005). Although experimental proof for such mechanistic link is
still lacking, the recent findings may give rise to a better understanding of the control
of PD permeability and assimilate export, especially under conditions of environmental
stress and leaf senescence (Munné-Bosch, 2005).

13.4.2 Phloem loading

In some plant families, a high degree of plasmodesmal connectivity extends even into the
minor vein sieve element–companion cell complexes (SE-CCC), indicating the presence
of an entirely symplastic route for sucrose transport into the phloem. In contrast to these
so-called symplastic loaders, the abundance of PD has been described to drop remarkably
between phloem parenchyma cells and the SE–CCC of potato leaves, suggesting the require-
ment of an apoplastic step in phloem loading (McCauley and Evert, 1989; van Bel et al.,
1992) (Fig. 13.3). Since the beginning of the 1990s, extensive studies were performed to
isolate and characterize membrane carriers providing transport activity for cellular efflux

or vesicular transfer of sucrose into the apoplasm as well as uptake into the phloem
cells. Although there is currently still insufficient knowledge regarding sucrose release
into the extracellular space, the subsequent steps of phloem loading by sucrose trans-
porters are well characterized (Williams et al., 2000; Lalonde et al., 2004). The first genes
for sucrose transporters were identified by an artificial complementation system using a
modified yeast strain, SuSy7, which was defective in all forms of invertase secretion but
able to metabolize ingested sucrose due to expression of an introduced sucrose synthase
(SuSy) (Frommer and Sonnewald, 1995). This strategy led to the identification of sucrose
transporters (SUT1) from spinach and potato (Riesmeier et al., 1992, 1993b), later fol-
lowed by the isolation of SUT1 paralogs from Solanaceae and homologs (also called
SUCs) from many other plants including Arabidopsis, Plantago and Ricinus (summarized
in Kühn, 2003). Transport studies in yeast and electrophysiology experiments in Xenopus
oocytes provided persuasive evidence that SUT1 class transporters function as high-
affinity H
-cotransporters with a 1:1 proton/sucrose transport ratio (Zhou et al., 1997).
Electron microscopic localization of solanaceous SUT1 protein and mRNA revealed

SE-specific localization of the protein, whereas SUT1 transcripts were detectable both in
SEs and in CCs, especially at the orifices of the interconnecting PD (Kühn et al., 1997).
This suggested trafficking of SUT1 mRNA from CCs into SEs, which is supported by
the detection of SUT1 RNA in the phloem sap of a range of different plant species (Kühn
et al., 1997; Ruiz-Medrano et al., 1999; Knop et al., 2001). However, it still needs to
be verified whether this SUT1 RNA is indeed translated on specialized ribosomes within
the sieve tubes or rather subject to long-distance translocation and unloading in distant
tissues. The provision of SUT1 protein to SE plasma membranes of phloem-loading sites
could equally be obtained by symplastic trafficking of SUT1 protein as suggested for
most of the proteins present in the sieve tube sap (Oparka and Santa Cruz, 2000; van Bel,
2003a).

Genetic proof for a critical role of SUT1 in phloem loading at the CC/SE boundary has
been accumulated from studies on transgenic plants and mutants with reduced transporter
activity. Antisense inhibition of SUT1 in tobacco and potato resulted in leaf carbohydrate
accumulation and a curled bleached leaf phenotype due to a severe reduction of sucrose
export capacity. These phenotypic alterations were coupled to a reduced assimilate supply
of sink organs as evident by stunted growth and impaired root development as well as,
in the case of potato, by a reduced tuber yield (Riesmeier et al., 1994; Kühn et al., 1996;
Bürkle et al., 1998). Similar to the situation in solanaceous species, knockout mutation
of the Arabidopsis SUT1 ortholog (AtSUC2) led to a starch-excess phenotype, impaired
growth and sterility (Gottwald et al., 2000), which overall indicated that sucrose transport
mediated by the SUT1/SUC2 type of transporters represents the major translocation
pathway for photoassimilate supply of sink organs. However, plants are able to survive
without this major loader, suggesting the existence of SUT1 paralogs, which may take
over part of the function in mutant plants. Indeed, solanaceous plants contain at least
two other distinct sucrose transporter proteins, SUT2 and SUT4 (Lalonde et al., 1999;
Barker et al., 2000; Weise et al., 2000), that showed overlapping expression pattern and
co-localized with SUT1 in the same enucleate SEs of tomato and potato (Barker et al.,
2000; Reinders et al., 2002). SUT4 has been suggested to represent the low-affinity/high-
capacity component of the sucrose transport and loading system in minor vein phloem
(Weise et al., 2000), whereas SUT2 was postulated to function as putative sucrose sensor
based on the specificity of extended cytoplasmic domains that structurally resemble the
yeast sugar sensors SNF3 and RGT2 (Barker et al., 2000). Interestingly, all the three
functionally different sucrose transporters have the capability to form homo- and hetero-
oligomers as demonstrated by the use of the yeast split-ubiquitin system, suggesting that
sucrose transporters may also function in higher order complexes (Reinders et al., 2002).
However, the concept of oligomerization of sucrose transporter in plasma membranes,
potentially with a regulatory role in phloem loading and assimilate transport, has not
been confirmed in planta, which seems to be specially needed, because the situation in
other species differs from the situation in Solanaceae. Schulze et al. (2003) showed in
similar yeast experiments a potential interaction between AtSUC2, AtSUT2 (= AtSUC3(cid:4)
and AtSUT4 from Arabidopsis. However, it could recently be demonstrated that AtSUC3
is targeted to SEs (Wellmer et al., 2004) and, therefore, does not co-localize with the
CC-confined AtSUC2 (Stadler and Sauer, 1996). Such spatial separation excludes the
possibility of physical interaction in vivo and strongly questions the proposed regulation

272

Hofius and Börnke

of AtSUC2-dependent phloem loading by AtSUC3 (Wellmer et al., 2004). In conclusion,
the observed species-specific differences in localization and functionality of sucrose
transporters suggest significant variations in the mechanisms and regulation of apoplastic
phloem loading.

13.4.3 Long-distance transport in the phloem

Long-distance translocation of sucrose occurs in the sieves tubes, representing arrays of
SE modules, each of them closely associated with one or more CCs. SEs are enucleate
and devoid of almost all organelles, which implies that CCs provide the genetic and
metabolic processes to ensure SE viability and transport functions (Oparka and Turgeon,
1999; van Bel and Knoblauch, 2000). The massive exchange of energy-carrying sub-
stances and macromolecules between CCs and SEs is largely mediated by a distinct class
of PD, characterized by multiple branches on the CC side and a single branch on the SE,
and commonly referred to as PD pore units (PPUs) (Fig. 13.3). It is now well established
that most of the 150–200 proteins detected in the sieve tube sap are synthesized in the
CCs and then are trafficked to SE via PPUs (Schobert et al., 1995, 1998; Ruiz-Medrano
et al., 2001). Similarly, it is assumed that the large number of RNA species present
in the phloem translocation stream, probably involved in long-distance signalling, are
transported through PPUs with the help of specialized RNA-binding chaperones, resem-
bling viral MPs (Xoconostle-Cázares et al., 1999; Lucas et al., 2001). The molecular
SEL of PPUs was shown to be in the range of 20–30 kDa using fluorescence-tagged
macromolecules (Kempers and van Bel, 1997) and transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis
plants expressing the freely diffusible 27-kDa green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the CCs
(Imlau et al., 1999). It is likely that the unusually large plasmodesmal SEL of PPUs
is mediated by the permanent gating activity of phloem-specific proteins, which were
previously shown to enlarge the SEL of mesophyll PD up to 30 kDa after microinjection
(Balachandran et al., 1997; Ishiwatari et al., 1998).

+

In addition to the supply with macromolecules, maintenance and functions of SEs fully
rely on energy produced in CCs, which apparently is the reason for the particularly high
number of mitochondria present in CCs (Oparka and Turgeon, 1999). Phloem loading
requires energization of the plasma membrane by a proton gradient that is generated
through the activity of phloem-specific H
-ATPase to drive the proton-coupled sucrose
uptake (Frommer and Sonnewald, 1995). Similar to the situation in sink organs, energy
supply in the CC is based on the reversible turnover of sucrose into UDP-Glc and
fructose, catalysed by a CC-specific SuSy (Nolte and Koch, 1993). Interestingly, blocking
of the subsequent conversion of UDP-Glc to G1P by expression of a bacterial PPase in
phloem cells resulted in impaired phloem loading and increased assimilate loss along
the translocation pathway in transgenic tobacco plants (Lerchl et al., 1995; Geigenberger
et al., 1996). This strongly suggested that a small proportion of the incoming sucrose
is required as fuel to supply the ATP for the H
-ATPase involved in sucrose uptake
and retrieval. In agreement with this assumption, sugar metabolism could be restored in
PPase-expressing plants by additional transformation with a cytosolic invertase, leading
to similar phloem loading and sucrose loss as observed in wild-type controls (Lerchl
et al., 1995).

Photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and source–sink relations

273

The long-distance translocation in the phloem is generally thought to be driven by
mass flow generated by a pressure gradient between sink tissues and source tissues. In
the classical concept, the sieve tubes forming the translocation pathway between source
and sink ends were considered to be osmotically isolated. However, this model has
been adapted to a rather dynamic concept, suggesting that sieve tubes are essentially
leaky and that the transported substances are released and retrieved along the phloem
pathway (van Bel, 2003a). Sucrose, for example, is lost from the phloem at considerable
rates but constantly retrieved from the apoplast by the activity of sucrose transporters
decorating the phloem path (Kühn et al., 1997). Recent experimental data obtained by
Ayre et al. (2003) support the view that small solutes in the CC enter the translocation
stream indiscriminately but are then subject to mechanisms that control retention and/or
reclamation along the transport pathway (for details, see van Bel, 2003b).

13.5 CARBON UNLOADING INTO SINK ORGANS

In contrast to the extensively investigated mechanisms of phloem loading, only a few
studies have focussed on the processes involved in phloem unloading of the carbon
translocated into sink organs. This might be due to the fact that the mode of unloading
varies considerably not only between species but also in a tissue- and developmentally
regulated manner. Therefore, several different unloading mechanisms were assumed to
coexist in the plant (Frommer and Sonnewald, 1995). Since 1997, much knowledge was
added to the field by a series of elegant studies that combined biochemical and/or molec-
ular analyses with non-invasive imaging techniques using phloem-imported fluorescent
dyes or transgenically expressed GFP (Roberts et al., 1997; Imlau et al., 1999; Oparka
et al., 1999; Ruan et al., 2001; Viola et al., 2001). In the following section, we summarize
the different models discussed for phloem unloading and then concentrate on the situation
found in potato tubers.

13.5.1 Symplastic and apoplastic routes of unloading

In principle, four different pathways for SE unloading and post-phloem transport are
proposed (Fig. 13.4), and the nature of the predominant route in sink tissues of many
species is still under intense investigation and discussion (Herbers and Sonnewald, 1998;
Lalonde et al., 2003). Evidence has accumulated that in many sink types such as root
apices, expanding leaves or Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced tumours, photoassimi-
lates primarily follow a symplastic route formed by PD between the phloem and the sink
parenchyma cells (Roberts et al., 1997; Imlau et al., 1999; Pradel et al., 1999; Haupt
et al., 2001). It is assumed that symplastic unloading is controlled to a great extent
by the frequency, structure and permeability of PD connecting the different cell types
along the unloading pathway. Importantly, microscopic studies using transgenic tobacco
or Arabidopsis plants that expressed GFP (27 kDa) or fusion proteins up to 50 kDa in
CCs revealed free unloading of these proteins from sieve tubes and extensive move-
ment along the post-phloem pathway in various sink organs including young leaves,

root tips and ovules (Imlau et al., 1999; Oparka et al., 1999). These observations indi-
cated that PD involved in assimilate import possess an unusually high molecular SEL
compared with other PD, most likely to accommodate high-assimilate fluxes but also
non-specific import of macromolecules with potential signalling functions. However,
comparable to the situation in source leaves, the genes responsible for the structural
composition of sink PD and for the regulation of their conductance are still largely
unknown. It has recently been suggested that phytohormones and calcium-regulated
signalling may contribute to the regulation of sink PD aperture, especially by the mod-
ification of callose deposition and physicochemical states of cytoskeleton components
located around and in the neck regions of PD (Baluška et al., 2001). In this respect,
myosin VIII and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-based calreticulin, both shown to specifi-
cally accumulate in sink PD, were proposed as candidate molecules to participate in the
modulation of sink strength via plasmodesmal gating (Baluška et al., 1999, 2001; Reichelt
et al., 1999).

In contrast to the symplastic route, all other pathways discussed for phloem unload-
ing contain an apoplastic step either directly at the boundary between the SE–CC and
parenchyma cells or at the boundary between different types of parenchyma cells dur-
ing post-phloem transport (Patrick, 1997; Herbers and Sonnewald, 1998). The release
of sucrose from the SE–CC into the apoplastic space might occur by leakage/diffusion
down the concentration gradient but could likewise involve sucrose efflux proteins (Kühn
et al., 2003). The subsequent uptake of sucrose into parenchyma cells could follow three
different routes. Firstly, sucrose import is mediated by an active mechanism involving
sucrose/proton symporters. Secondly, sucrose is cleaved by a cell wall invertase into hex-
oses, which are then transferred by sink-specific monosaccharide transporters into sink
cells. Thirdly, sucrose could be taken up by endocytosis as indicated by earlier studies
using fluorescent dyes in storage tissue of potato tuber (Oparka and Prior, 1988). Depend-
ing on the mode of phloem unloading, the incoming sugar is further metabolized by

Photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and source–sink relations

275

different enzymatic routes, such as sucrose breakdown by either SuSy or neutral invertase
in the cytosol, or alternatively by a soluble acid invertase after sucrose import into the
vacuole. Hexoses derived from apoplastic sucrose hydrolysis are either taken up into the
vacuole or phosphorylated in the cytosol to enter glycolysis (for details, see Herbers and
Sonnewald, 1998).

13.5.2 Phloem unloading in the tuber

Despite many studies on sink–source relations and carbon partitioning in potato plants,
the mode of phloem unloading in the tuber remained unresolved for a long time. Early
observations of numerous PD connections between SE–CCC and the surrounding storage
parenchyma cells indicated a structural basis for the occurrence of a symplastic mode
of phloem unloading (Oparka, 1986). This view was supported by subsequent work on
growing tubers showing that plasmolysis had an inhibitory effect on the unloading of
sucrose into the tuber (Oparka and Prior, 1987). Several experimental data, however,
suggested the involvement and importance of an apoplastic step for sucrose delivery into
the tuber. For instance, as already mentioned, studies with fluorescent dyes indicated that
endocytosis could provide a potential route to translocate metabolites from the apoplast
into the cytosol (Oparka and Prior, 1988). Also, isolated tuber discs were demonstrated
to have the capacity for sugar uptake from the surrounding medium (Oparka and Wright,
1988; Fernie et al., 2001b), and finally, transgenic potato plants that expressed a yeast-
derived invertase in the apoplast of growing tubers displayed significant alterations in
tuber yield (Heineke et al., 1992; Sonnewald et al., 1997). Nevertheless, definite evidence
for the mode(s) of phloem unloading during tuber development could only recently be
provided by Viola and co-workers (2001). A combination of confocal imaging with
the membrane impermeant marker carboxyfluorescein (CF) and autoradiography with
14C-labelled assimilates was used to follow phloem unloading during different stages
of tuber induction and growth. The authors convincingly showed that during very early
stages of tuber development, i.e. during the elongation phase of stolon growth, the
phloem-mobile tracer was confined to the phloem strands, whereas 14C unloading was
detectable on audioradiographs of the growing stolon, indicating that apoplastic phloem
unloading predominated. However, during the first observable phases of tuberization,
a transition occurred from apoplastic to symplastic transport as indicated by identical
unloading pattern of both CF and 14C sugar. Finally, during the remaining phases of tuber
growth, the symplastic route of phloem unloading predominated. Apparently consistent
-cotransporter
with such a developmental switch in unloading mechanisms, the sucrose H
StSUT1 was recently found to be present in SEs of sink tubers (Kühn et al., 2003).
Antisense inhibition of StSUT1 using the B33 promoter suggested that SUT1 may play
a crucial role in the unloading process at early stages of tuber development. Such a
function might be related either to the retrieval of sucrose from the apoplast, thereby
regulating the osmotic potential in the extracellular space, or to the transfer of sucrose
from the SEs into the apoplast, thereby acting directly as a phloem exporter (Kühn
et al., 2003).

13.6 SUCROSE TO STARCH CONVERSION IN THE TUBER

The major flux in potato tuber carbon metabolism is the conversion of sucrose through
hexose phosphates to starch. The pathway by which this conversion occurs and the sub-
cellular location of the enzymes involved are well documented (Fernie et al., 2002; Fernie
and Willmitzer, 2004). An array of transgenic potato plants with reduced expression of
most of the genes involved in this process has been generated. In this section, we intend to
summarize the current understanding of this central pathway of carbohydrate metabolism
while putting some stress on recent developments in understanding the regulation of
starch synthesis.

13.6.1 Production of hexose phosphates in the cytosol

Sucrose delivered to the tuber can be cleaved in different ways. It can be either hydrolysed
by apoplastic or cytosolic invertase, respectively, resulting in glucose and fructose, or
converted into UDP-Glc and fructose by SuSy. The prevailing way of sucrose cleavage
depends on the developmental stage of the tuber and is coordinated with the route of
unloading. At the onset of tuberization, a switch from an invertase-dominated hydrolytic
sucrose degradation route to a SuSy catalysed one occurs (Appeldoorn et al., 1997). The
products of sucrose cleavage enter metabolism by the concerted action of UGPase or fruc-
tokinase and hexokinase (HK) in case of the SuSy and invertase pathways, respectively.
As a result, the end products of sucrose degradation will enter the hexose-P pool, which
consists of an equilibrium mixture of F6P, G6P and G1P, because of readily reversible
reactions catalysed by the cytosolic isoforms of PGI and PGM (Fernie et al., 2001a).

The crucial role for SuSy in sucrose breakdown during the storage phase has been
established from transgenic potato plants expressing a SuSy antisense construct driven
by the CaMV 35S promoter (Zrenner et al., 1995). In transgenic tubers, a reduction in
SuSy activity of up to 95% resulted in a reduction in starch and storage protein content of
mature tubers, but surprisingly, sucrose levels remained unchanged. There was, however,
a significant increase in the levels of hexoses, which was paralleled by a 40-fold increase
in invertase activity. The fact that the induction of invertase activity could not compensate
for the loss in SuSy activity argues for metabolic channelling of sucrose via the SuSy-
dominated pathway into starch and thus indicates that SuSy plays a predominant role in
determining potato tuber sink strength (Zrenner et al., 1995). Accordingly, expression of
a yeast-derived invertase either in the apoplast or in the cytosol of transgenic tubers did
not result in increased sink strength in these tubers despite their higher sucrolytic capacity
(Sonnewald et al., 1997).

Although the net flux in the tuber is towards sucrose cleavage, the rate of sucrose
(re)synthesis in this tissue is considerable (Geigenberger et al., 1997). This process can
proceed either by the reversed SuSy reaction or by the reactions catalysed by SPS and
SPP (Geigenberger and Stitt, 1993). It is thought that the combined operation of these
pathways in concert with the degradative pathway allows the cell to respond sensitively
to both variations in sucrose supply and the cellular demand of carbon for biosynthetic
processes (Hatzfeld and Stitt, 1990). Several studies have shown that SPS is also present
in potato tubers and that the tuber enzyme is regulated in an analogous manner to the leaf

enzyme (Geigenberger and Stitt, 1993; Reimholz et al., 1994). The complex regulation
of the enzyme (see discussion in 13.2.3.1) suggests that it plays an important metabolic
role. The reduction of SPS activity in potato tubers by antisense transformation revealed
only a minor influence of the enzyme on starch metabolism but a major role of sucrose
synthesis via SPS in response to water stress (Geigenberger et al., 1999).

Beyond their role as intermediates in the conversion of sucrose to starch, hexose
phosphates also serve as substrates for glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate
pathway in potato tubers (Neuhaus and Emes, 2000; for a recent review of the subject,
see Stitt and Sonnewald, 1995).

13.6.2 Uptake of carbon into the amyloplast

Because starch synthesis in potato tubers is confined to amyloplasts, it relies entirely on
translocation of metabolites from the cytosol through the amyloplast envelope. The form in
which carbon enters the amyloplast has long been a matter of contention. Although potato
tuber amyloplasts posses some TPT activity (Schünemann et al., 1996), it seems clear that
triose-P is not the substrate taken up to support starch synthesis. In contrast to chloroplasts
in photosynthetic tissues, they lack plastidial FBPase activity and thus cannot convert
triose-P into F1,6BP (Entwistle and ap Rees, 1990). Consequently, other metabolites have
been considered as cytosolic precursors for starch synthesis in the amyloplast. Studies on
highly enriched amyloplasts from potato tubers provided evidence for uptake of carbon in
the form of either G1P (Naeem et al., 1997) or G6P (Wischmann et al., 1999). However,
the cloning of a hexose monophosphate transporter from potato and the finding that the
cauliflower homologue is highly specific for G6P provide evidence for the latter being
the major compound imported into the amyloplast (Kammerer et al., 1998). Furthermore,
transgenic potato lines in which the activity of the plastidial isoform of PGM was reduced
by antisense were characterized by a large reduction in starch content (Tauberger et al.,
2000). This adds further weight to the view that interconversion of G6P to G1P for starch
synthesis occurs inside the chloroplast, although G1P import might represent a minor
route because the PGM antisense tubers were not completely starchless (Tauberger et al.,
2000) (Fig. 13.5).

13.6.3 Starch synthesis in potato tubers

Following the uptake of carbon into the tuber amyloplast, starch synthesis proceeds via
the concerted action of plastidial PGM, AGPase and the polymerizing reactions already
described for the synthesis of transitory starch in chloroplasts (see Section 13.3.1). The
important role of AGPase for starch synthesis in potato tubers has been proved by
antisense studies in which a reduction of AGPase activity led to a dramatic reduction
in the level of starch (Müller-Röber et al., 1992). Potato tuber AGPase resembles the
leaf enzyme in being allosterically activated by 3-PGA and inhibited by Pi. In contrast
to leaves, however, the levels of phosphorylated intermediates are remarkably constant
on a diurnal basis and through development, respectively (Geigenberger and Stitt, 2000).
During environmental perturbations such as wounding and water stress, this balance
is disturbed, and consequently, changes in 3-PGA occur in the tubers that are well

correlated with changes in the rate of starch synthesis and thus provide evidence for
allosteric regulation of potato tuber AGPase in vivo (summarized in Geigenberger, 2003).
Potato tuber AGPase is also subjected to post-translational redox regulation involving the
mechanism described above for the leaf enzyme (Fu et al., 1998; Ballicora et al., 2000).
This regulatory mechanism was found to be operating in vivo under a range of conditions
that modify carbon supply and sucrose levels in growing potato tubers (Tiessen et al.,
2002). Redox activation of AGPase was high at the beginning of tuber development and
decreased as tubers matured. The decrease in AGPase redox state was paralleled by a
decrease in sucrose levels and by a decline in the rate of starch synthesis in these tubers.
At all events, a strong correlation was observed between the endogenous levels of sucrose
and the redox activation state of AGPase (Tiessen et al., 2002), suggesting a link between
sucrose levels and redox modulation of the enzyme.

Whereas in chloroplasts the ATP necessary for starch synthesis can be readily provided
through photosynthesis, potato tuber amyloplasts have to import ATP from the cytosol
via an ATP/ADP transport protein (AATP) located on the inner-envelope membrane
(Neuhaus and Emes, 2000). Tjaden et al. (1998) recently showed that a relatively small
decrease in ATP/ADP transporter activity leads to a reduced level of total starch content
and a lower amylose-to-amylopectin ratio. By contrast, increased transporter activity
correlated with higher starch contents and a higher amylose-to-amylopectin ratio. In total,
these observations indicated that the rate of ATP import exerts considerable control on
the rate of starch synthesis and affects the molecular composition of starch in potato
tubers.

Although the later polymerizing reactions of starch synthesis catalysed by the var-
ious isoforms of SSs and SBEs do not appear to play a role in the control of starch
accumulation, they are crucial in determining the structure of starch (Kossmann and
Lloyd, 2000; Tetlow et al., 2004).

13.7 SOURCE–SINK REGULATION BY SUGARS

The plant life cycle is accompanied by source–sink transitions as well as changes with
respect to sink strength of individual organs. Thus, complex mechanisms have to be
assumed, which integrate the expression and activity of enzymes involved in carbohydrate
synthesis in source tissues with those involved in carbon utilization in sink tissues on a
whole plant level. The molecular mechanisms by which these complex interactions are
achieved are far from understood, but many lines of evidence suggest the existence of
sink signals that adjust source metabolism according to sink demand (Paul and Foyer,
2001). Mainly two concepts have been put forward to explain these sink signals: hor-
monal regulation and end-product inhibition of photosynthesis. According to the model
of hormonal regulation, the variation in the activity of sink tissues will be translated into
changes in the content of phytohormones which then will transmit appropriate messages
to photosynthetic cells eventually adjusting photosynthesis to sink demand. This concept
is supported by the observation that the application of cytokinin can partially overcome
down-regulation of photosynthesis caused by the removal of sinks (Wareing et al., 1968).
According to the second model, assimilate accumulation in source tissues is supposed
to be responsible for the inhibition of photosynthesis. In support of this hypothesis, a
negative correlation between assimilate content and leaf photosynthetic rate has been
observed in many plant species (Goldschmidt and Huber, 1992). Down-regulation of
photosynthesis may be governed by fine regulation of biosynthetic enzymes or by the
adjustment of gene expression. Fine regulation of photosynthetic sucrose biosynthesis
may be initiated by the sucrose-mediated inhibition of SPS and the resulting changes in
carbon partitioning between cytosol and chloroplast (see also Section 13.2.3.1). This fine
regulation of carbon metabolism by metabolites is considered as short-term response to
changing demands for assimilates. In case of continuous changes of assimilate demand,
e.g. after the onset of tuberization, altered gene expression will accompany metabolic
adjustments. The underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown, but several
lines of evidence suggest that sugars play a role as signalling molecules in the down-
regulation of photosynthetic genes. In agreement with this hypothesis, several genes have
been shown to be regulated by external sugars (for a recent review, see Koch, 1996;
Smeekens, 2000; Rolland et al., 2002). Depending on their response to sugars, plant genes
have been grouped into three classes: down-regulated, up-regulated and non-responding.
Photosynthetic genes belong to the class of down-regulated genes, which is in agreement
with the hypothesis that sugars are involved in sink regulation of photosynthesis, whereas
genes involved in carbon utilization, e.g. SuSy, are classified as up-regulated by sugars.
In general, mechanisms underlying sugar-sensing and sugar-mediated signal transduc-
tion in plants are poorly understood. It appears that separate sensing systems are present
for hexoses and sucrose. Several lines of evidence suggest a prominent role of HKs in
hexose-sensing. In Arabidopsis, two HK isoforms (AtHK1 and AtHK2) have been iso-
lated (Jang et al., 1997). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants with reduced and elevated levels
of AtHK1 or AtHK2 mRNAs have been constructed, and the sugar response of the respec-
tive seedlings was investigated. Overexpression of HK resulted in enhanced sensitivity
to glucose, whereas reduced levels of HK led to reduced glucose sensitivity of seedlings,
providing evidence for the involvement of HK in hexose-sensing (Jang et al., 1997).

280

Hofius and Börnke

In a recent study, using catalytically inactive AtHK1 mutants, Moore et al. (2003) were
able to separate the metabolic and signalling function of AtHK1. For potato, however,
the situation is far less clear. Transgenic potato plants transformed with S. tuberosum
hexokinase-1 (StHK1) in sense or antisense orientation have been generated (Veramendi
et al., 1999). Despite a wide range of HK activities, no evidence could be found that StHK1
is involved in sugar-sensing in potato. Interestingly, reduced StHK1 activity in leaves of
potato plants led to a starch-excess phenotype, suggesting a role for this enzyme in the
degradation of transitory starch rather than in hexose-sensing (Veramendi et al., 1999).

The SNF1 protein kinase has been shown to be an integral component of the sugar-
sensing pathway in budding yeast (Carlson, 1999). SNF1-related protein kinases have
also been identified in plants, and it has been proposed that they act as global regulators
of carbon metabolism (Halford and Hardie, 1998). In support of this notion, antisense
suppression of an SNF1-homologue in potato (SnRK1) prevents transcriptional activation
of a sucrose-inducible SuSy gene and results in reduced SuSy activity in transgenic tubers
(Purcell et al., 1998).

In addition to their importance in modulating gene expression, SNF-like proteins in
plants also play a role in the post-translational regulation of metabolism by directly phos-
phorylating key enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA reductase, nitrate
reductase and SPS (Sugden et al., 1999). Recently, SnRK1 was also shown to be involved
in the redox activation of AGPase in potato tubers (Tiessen et al., 2003). When tuber
slices from either wild-type plants or SnRK1-antisense lines were supplied with exoge-
nous sucrose, redox activation of AGPase was much stronger in the wild-type than in the
antisense lines. Interestingly, SnRK1-antisense repression did not affect AGPase activa-
tion in response to external glucose feeding, which implies the existence of independent
signalling pathways for glucose and sucrose possibly involving HK (Tiessen et al., 2003).
Yet an additional mechanism of sugar-sensing seems to occur at the plasma membrane
and does not seem to require uptake or metabolism of the compound sensed. The feeding
of the non-metabolizable and non-transportable sucrose analog palatinose has been shown
to lead to a direct stimulation of starch synthesis in potato tuber slices without requiring
an intervening increase in metabolite levels (Fernie et al., 2001b). Later, it was shown
that this could at least partially be explained by a palatinose-mediated redox activation
of AGPase, suggesting that metabolism of sucrose is not a necessary component of
the sucrose-induced redox activation of AGPase (Tiessen et al., 2003). The mechanism
by which sugar signals are perceived at the plasma membrane is currently completely
unknown, but it has been suggested that sugar transport proteins might be involved in
these processes (Lalonde et al., 1999; Xoconostle-Cázares et al., 1999).

Taken together, it seems evident that many independently operating sugar-sensing
pathways exist in plants, and current models are shown in Fig. 13.6. Sucrose, synthesized
in photosynthetically active tissues, is translocated to growing tubers via the phloem.
In sink tissues, sucrose can either be hydrolysed by cell wall-bound invertases (cwInv)
to glucose and fructose or be transported into sink cells by SUT proteins or through PD.
Alternatively, hexoses derived from sucrose hydrolysis can be translocated into sink cells
via hexose transporters (HT). In the cytosol, the hexoses trigger a signal via HK leading
to transcriptional and post-translational regulation of several enzymes, including AGPase.
A symplastic sucrose-specific signal is triggered by an SnRK1-dependent mechanism.

14.1 INTRODUCTION

At some point during their life cycle, all sessile organisms must cope with adverse
environmental conditions by adjusting their physiological/developmental status. The phe-
nomenon of dormancy or developmental/metabolic arrest is a common strategy that
enhances survival during times of environmental stress. Examples of dormancy can be
found throughout the five kingdoms of life from single-cell bacteria to more complex
multicellular organisms (Stearns, 1992). The existence of dormancy in primitive Archaean
phyla suggests that dormancy was a very early adaptation to environmental extremes
(Henis, 1987).

In plants, dormancy has been defined as ‘the temporary suspension of visible growth
of any plant structure containing a meristem’ (Lang et al., 1987). Plant dormancy has
been further subdivided into three distinct (but often overlapping) types: endodormancy,
paradormancy, and ecodormancy (Lang et al., 1987). In endodormancy, a meristem is
arrested by physiological factors arising from within the affected structure; in parador-
mancy, a meristem is arrested by external physiological factors; and in ecodormancy,
a meristem is arrested by external environmental factors. During their life cycle, potato
tubers can exhibit all three types of dormancy (Fig. 14.1). Immediately after formation
and for an indeterminate period after harvest, tuber meristems (eyes) are endodormant and
will not sprout. During extended storage, tubers exit endodormancy and begin to sprout,
with (typically) one eye/sprout becoming dominant and inhibiting the growth of the other
(cid:2)
C or lower will not sprout
eyes that are paradormant. Tubers stored at temperatures of 3
regardless of physiological dormancy status and are in a state of ecodormancy. In this
review, unless specified otherwise, the term dormancy refers to the endodormant state.

As stated above, dormancy is thought to be a physiological adaptation to intermittent
periods of environmental limitations and is therefore a survival mechanism. As such, many
dormant organs or organisms exhibit enhanced resistance to otherwise lethal abiotic stress
(Hand and Hardewig, 1996). For example, seeds of many frost-sensitive plants readily
survive freezing temperatures that would certainly kill the entire plant (Osborne, 1981).
Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants are not frost tolerant (Li, 1977). No data have been
published demonstrating enhanced low-temperature resistance in dormant tubers versus
their non-dormant counterparts or parent plants. However, tuber dormancy prevents the
emergence of sprouts in late summer/early fall when they would be exposed to the

subsequent killing temperatures of winter. This characteristic alone may confer a survival
advantage in temperate climates. Interestingly, tuber dormancy has been associated with
increased resistance to pathogen attack (Ladyzhenskaya and Protsenko, 2002).

In this review, the internal factors that accompany and possibly regulate dormancy

progression and early sprout growth will be described.

14.2 TUBER DORMANCY CHARACTERISTICS

The tuber is a determinate organ with a finite functional lifespan. At what point during
development does the tuber become dormant? In many studies, the length of tuber dor-
mancy has been measured using harvest date as the starting point. Under field conditions,
harvest date can vary widely and is dependent on many unrelated parameters including
planting date, weather, field conditions, equipment availability, and intended use to name
a few. Clearly, these factors have nothing to do with the physiological state of the tuber.
Following a series of studies with several cultivars, Burton (1989) concluded that the
inception of tuber dormancy occurs at or about the time of tuber initiation, and this view
has been recently reemphasized (Claassens and Vreugdenhil, 2000). Thus, in indetermi-
nate varieties such as Russet Burbank, the post-harvest duration of dormancy is longer for
smaller (younger) tubers than it is for larger (older) tubers. The length of tuber dormancy
in cultivars released for production is quite variable, ranging from essentially 0 to well
over 9 months. Most cultivars grown for processing possess relatively short dormancy
periods, necessitating the use of sprout-suppressing chemicals for successful long-term
storage.

Tuber dormancy is affected by both genetic (i.e. genotype) and environmental influ-
ences. Protracted tuber dormancy is generally found in wild (non-domesticated) potato
populations, whereas the reverse is often true in potato lines developed by modern
breeding programs. One exception to this rule is the Phureja group, which, as a whole,

Dormancy and sprouting

is characterized by very short tuber and seed dormancy. Early studies by Simmons
(1964) demonstrated that the inheritance of both (true) seed and tuber dormancy in
potatoes was polygenic with at least three genes involved (Flewelling, 1987). Inter-
estingly, a strong correlation between seed and tuber dormancy was observed in
these studies (Simmons, 1964). Analyses for quantitative trait loci (QTL) have found
between six (Freyre et al., 1994) and nine (Van den Berg et al., 1996) QTL that
affect tuber dormancy, either alone or through epistatic interactions. Three of these
dormancy-related QTL coincided with loci previously associated with photoperiodic
sensitivity, suggesting that they may represent genes affecting tuber hormone content
(Ewing et al., 2004). Further studies demonstrated that two of the dormancy-related
QTL coincided with loci associated with tuber abscisic acid (ABA) content (Šimko
et al., 1997).

Both pre- and post-harvest environmental factors can affect tuber dormancy duration.
Unusually cold or hot weather during tuber development in the field often results in pro-
tracted or shortened (respectively) dormancy (Burton, 1989). Depending on the cultivar,
(cid:2)
C(cid:3) field temperatures can result in the immediate termination of
extremely hot (cid:2)>35
tuber dormancy, a physiological disorder known as heat sprouting (Van den Berg et al.,
1990). Tuber dormancy is restored as field temperatures moderate back to more seasonal
norms. The overall effect of this loss and restoration of dormancy is malformed, knobby
tubers with reduced starch content and lowered market value (Van den Berg et al., 1991).
Varying the photoperiod over the range of 13–18 h during tuber development had no
effect on the length of tuber dormancy (Emilsson, 1949). Under field conditions, the
effects of photoperiod are difficult to determine, and any effects observed may relate more
to the timing of tuber initiation or rate of maturation than to dormancy per se (Burton,
1989). Dormancy duration in microtubers was significantly reduced when microtubers
were exposed to 8-h photoperiods instead of being held in complete darkness during tuber
induction (Tovar et al., 1985).

(cid:2)

Tuber dormancy is unlike that of other plant meristems in that there are no specific
environmental cues required for dormancy exit. Nevertheless, post-harvest environmental
conditions can have a dramatic quantitative effect on tuber dormancy. Between 3 and
C, the length of tuber dormancy is inversely proportional to temperature (Burton,
25
1989). Prolonged exposure to temperatures ≤2 or ≥30
C abruptly terminates tuber dor-
mancy, and sprouting commences upon return to moderate temperatures (Wurr and Allen,
1976). The presence or absence of light during post-harvest storage has little effect on dor-
mancy duration but dramatically affects the morphology of emerging sprouts. Excluding
biogenic volatiles that will be discussed later, the composition of the gas phase can affect
tuber dormancy. As with temperature, storage gas phase composition has little effect
on tuber dormancy, provided extremes are avoided. Both hypoxic and anoxic conditions
that result in temporary anaerobiosis in the tuber can break tuber dormancy (Burton,
1989). Treatment of dormant tubers with non-physiologic concentrations of CO2 (20%)
and oxygen (40%) has been reported to effectively terminate tuber dormancy (Thornton,
1933; Reust and Gugerli, 1984; Coleman, 1998). By contrast, CO2 concentrations ≤10%
have no effect on dormancy duration per se but do stimulate subsequent sprout growth
perhaps by antagonizing ethylene action (Burton, 1989).

14.3 CELL BIOLOGY OF DORMANCY

Metabolic depression is a general characteristic of dormant tissues (Hand and Hardewig,
1996; Guppy and Withers, 1999), and despite their fully hydrated condition, dormant
potato tubers are no exception. Tuber respiration (a gross indicator of metabolic activity)
is generally high immediately after harvest, declines rapidly thereafter, remains low during
tuber dormancy, and rises dramatically as sprout growth is initiated (Burton, 1974).
During storage, the contents of starch, amino acids, protein, nucleic acids, and lipids in
tuber parenchyma either remain constant or decrease slightly (Burton, 1989). The onset
of sprouting is accompanied by declines in most macromolecules and a corresponding
increase in their monomeric constituents, which is especially evident in the starch/sugar
ratio. These changes are consistent with the shift in tuber physiology from a sink/storage
organ to a source tissue providing nutrients and biochemical precursors to the developing
sprout.

Wholesale changes in macromolecular (DNA, RNA, and protein) syntheses also occur
in tuber meristems during dormancy progression. When expressed on a weight basis, the
total content of DNA, RNA, and protein increases in buds as dormancy ends and sprout
growth commences (Tuan and Bonner, 1964; Désiré et al., 1995). Early studies with
radiolabeled precursors indicated that eyes excised from dormant tubers exhibited very
limited incorporation of labeled tracers into DNA and RNA (Tuan and Bonner, 1964;
Rappaport and Wolf, 1969). Others have found that tuber dormancy is characterized by
low (but measurable) rates of net RNA synthesis that increase substantially as dormancy
ends (Korableva et al., 1976; MacDonald and Osborne, 1988). Sprouting is accompanied
by increases in the synthesis of all classes of RNA, with the largest increases observed
in rRNA (Korableva et al., 1976).

Although cell division is arrested in dormant tuber meristems, modest levels of thymi-
dine incorporation into DNA have been observed that have been attributed to DNA repair
processes (MacDonald and Osborne, 1988). By contrast, net protein synthesis is more
active in dormant meristems and increases only modestly during dormancy exit (Korabl-
eva et al., 1976). As judged by electrophoretic mobility of the extracted proteins, the onset
of sprouting is accompanied by wholesale qualitative changes in protein synthesis patterns
(Désiré et al., 1995; Espen et al., 1999). Although the identity of many of these up- and
down-regulated proteins has been determined, their role in tuber dormancy progression
is largely unknown.

Chromatin preparations isolated from dormant eyes were essentially incapable of sup-
porting net RNA synthesis either without supplement or when supplied with an excess
of exogenous bacterial RNA polymerase (Tuan and Bonner, 1964). By contrast, chro-
matin prepared from tubers chemically forced to exit dormancy readily supported net
RNA synthesis. This situation mirrored that found in dormant seeds (Deltour, 1985) and
suggested that some component(s) in chromatin prepared from dormant tissues either
inhibited polymerase activity or restricted template availability. Template availability of
chromatin is known to be regulated by a number of reversible enzyme-catalyzed cova-
lent modifications of both DNA and proteins collectively known as remodeling (Dobosy
and Selker, 2001; Li et al., 2002). Two of the better characterized modifications are
DNA–cytosine methylation and histone–lysine acetylation (Bender, 2004; Loidl, 2004).

Dormancy and sprouting

291

Increased cytosine methylation and histone deacetylation inhibit transcription by alter-
ing nucleosome structure and inhibiting polymerase access to DNA, whereas increased
template availability accompanies decreased DNA methylation and increased histone
acetylation (Wu and Grunstein, 2000). Although genome-wide 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC)
content in DNA isolated from tuber meristems was relatively constant during tuber dor-
mancy progression, a significant transient decrease in 5mC levels was observed in certain
sequence motifs as tubers exited dormancy (Law and Suttle, 2002). Similar declines in
selected sequence-specific 5mC content were observed in both in vitro-generated micro-
tubers and tubers chemically forced to prematurely terminate dormancy. In addition, tuber
dormancy exit was accompanied by sustained increases in histone H3.1 and H3.2 multi-
acetylation and transient increases in histone H4 multi-acetylation (Law and Suttle, 2004).
The treatment of dormant tubers with bromoethane resulted in the rapid (<9 days) loss of
dormancy and transient increases in histone H3.1, H3.2 and H4 multi-acetylation. Collec-
tively, these results demonstrated that a defined sequence of epigenetic changes beginning
with transient cytosine demethylation and followed by increased histone multi-acetylation
accompanied the reactivation of tuber meristems during dormancy exit. Further studies
are needed to identify changes in chromatin composition (nucleosome structure) in pro-
moter regions of specific genes known to be up- or down-regulated during dormancy
progression.

Tuber dormancy is defined by the absence of visible bud growth. Periodically, the
cellular basis for the absence of macroscopic growth has been questioned (Coleman,
1987a; Burton, 1989). Some researchers (Leshem and Clowes, 1972) considered tuber
dormancy to be a reflection of reduced (but not absent) cellular growth, whereas others
concluded that visible tuber meristem dormancy was a result of total cell division arrest
(Goodwin, 1967). A recent study using both destructive microscopic and non-destructive
morphological observations concluded that tuber dormancy is indeed characterized by
a cultivar-dependent period of meristematic inactivity (Van Ittersum et al., 1992). Cell
division or mitosis is the final phase of a series of highly coordinated biochemical
processes collectively referred to as the cell cycle (De Veylder et al., 2003; Dewitte and
Murray, 2003). The absence of mitotic figures in dormant tuber meristems suggested
that cell division was arrested in a pre-mitotic phase (Leshem and Clowes, 1972). Using
histological methods, MacDonald and Osborne (1988) concluded that dormant tuber
meristems were largely arrested prior to DNA synthesis in a 2C (Somatic cell DNA
content) state. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry (Fig. 14.2) demonstrated that nuclei
isolated from dormant tuber meristem cells were in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and
release from dormancy was accompanied by an increase in both S- and G2-phase nuclei
(Campbell et al., 1996). Bud dormancy of aspen (Populus tremula L.) and tuber dormancy
of Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) are also characterized by cell cycle
arrest in the G1 phase (Rohde et al., 1997; Freeman et al., 2003).

Cell cycle progression is controlled by both transcriptional and post-translational pro-
cesses (De Veylder et al., 2003; Dewitte and Murray, 2003). Non-dividing cells can
arrest at one of two checkpoints (G1/S or G2/M) of the cell cycle. Passage through these
checkpoints is controlled in part by changes in activities of a group of heterodimeric,
cyclin-dependent serine/threonine kinases (cdk). The activities of these enzymes are reg-
ulated by a combination of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and association with other

regulatory proteins such as cyclins and inhibitors (Inzé, 2005). Studies from several
plant systems have demonstrated that passage through the G1/S checkpoint is cytokinin
dependent and requires an active cdc2a/cyclin D kinase complex that phosphorylates
and inactivates a retinoblastoma-like protein which in turn de-represses the transcrip-
tion of many S-phase genes (den Boer and Murray, 2000; Murray et al., 2001). A
cdc2a gene has been cloned from potato tuber meristems (Campbell et al., 1996).
Northern analysis indicated that no significant changes in cdc2a gene transcription
occurred during tuber dormancy progression. Immunoblot (western) analysis demon-
strated that an increase in p34cdc2a kinase protein occurred coincidently with the resump-
tion of meristem growth in non-dormant tuber meristems. Preliminary studies found
that an increase in tuber meristem histone H-1 kinase activity in PSTAIRE immuno-
precipitates accompanied the onset of meristem growth following dormancy termination
(Suttle, unpublished). The effects of dormancy status on cyclin D or cdk inhibitors
in potato tuber meristems have not been reported. In the physiologically similar case
of tuber dormancy in H. tuberosus L., an increase in cyclin D transcript levels was
observed during re-initiation of cell cycle activity induced by hormone treatment (Freeman
et al., 2003).

Although dormancy is defined by the absence of visible growth of meristematic tissues,
it appears that non-growing tissues also display dormancy-related metabolic depression.
The treatment of excised discs of potato tuber cortex with GA3 increased the reducing
sugar content only when discs were prepared from non-dormant tubers (Bailey et al.,
1978). These results suggest that both the meristematic (bud) and storage tissues exhibit
metabolic depression during dormancy.

14.4 GENE EXPRESSION DURING DORMANCY TRANSITION

The numerous reports describing qualitative and quantitative changes in tuber biochem-
istry and protein composition indicate that dormancy progression is accompanied by
significant changes in gene expression. However, to date, there have been surprisingly
few published reports describing such changes. In general, most of the published stud-
ies have been comparative survey analyses of global gene-expression patterns in cDNA
libraries prepared from dormant and sprouting tissues. Because these studies are correla-
tive in nature, generally encompass two end points (dormant and sprouting), and may use
different tissues for each analysis, care must be exercised when interpreting these data.

Changes in gene expression from initiation through sprouting were assayed using whole
microtubers generated in vitro from single-node explants and an amplified fragment-
length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting technique (Bachem et al., 2000). In total, an
estimated 40 000 genes were expressed throughout the microtuber life cycle. Gene expres-
sion was highest during tuber initiation, was lowest during dormancy, and rose again as
sprouting commenced. A total of 1300 transcript-derived cDNA fragments (TDFs) were
followed during dormancy progression. Of these, only 13% were observed to change
during dormancy, with 4% of the genes exhibiting decreased expression during early dor-
mancy and 3% showing increased expression coincident with sprouting. The vast majority
of genes either displayed no change during dormancy or displayed an irregular pattern
of expression independent of physiological state. Following isolation and sequencing of
75 TDFs exhibiting dormancy-related changes in expression, it was found that 64% of
these had no sequence similarity to any known genes in the databases but most were
similar to anonymous cDNA sequences in expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. In a
follow-up study (Trindade et al., 2004), putative promoters located upstream of the trans-
lation start site of 12 differentially expressed genes were isolated and analyzed. Response
elements in the promoters identified confer light, sugar, and hormone responsiveness in
other plant species and may do so in tuber tissues as well.

In another study involving EST sequencing from multiple libraries representing differ-
ent potato tissues, Ronning et al. (2003) identified just under 20 000 unique expressed
sequences, of which 44% were similar to known genes. Of these, approximately 2200
library-specific sequences from sprouting eyes and 851 from dormant tuber cortex (exclud-
ing buds and periderm) were identified. Just over 50 genes were more highly expressed in
dormant tuber cortex versus actively growing microtubers, and over 40 genes were more
highly expressed in sprouting eyes versus dormant tuber cortex. Because the libraries
analyzed were prepared from very different tissues, it is not clear whether the expres-
sion patterns observed were the result of tissue or developmental specificity. Regardless,
perhaps the most surprising aspect of the data presented is the paucity of differentially
expressed genes. This was unexpected, given the wholesale changes in protein profiles
noted in the earlier electrophoretic analyses (Désiré et al., 1995; Espen et al., 1999).
Of the genes up-regulated in sprouting versus dormant tuber libraries, genes coding for
ribosomal proteins constitute the largest group, and genes typically associated with cell
cycle activity [cdk2, cyclins, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), etc.] are notably
absent.

294

Suttle

More recently, a subtractive hybridization approach was used to generate a library
enriched with genes up-regulated in tuber apical meristems during sprouting (Faivre-
Rampant et al., 2004a). A total of 385 up-regulated ESTs were identified, of which
36% showed no significant similarity to known genes. Of the remainder, 12, 9, and 3%
were similar to ribosomal protein genes, stress-related genes, and transcription factor
genes, respectively. One gene coding for a member of the auxin-response factor (ARF6)
family was identified and analyzed more closely. StARF6 expression was greatest in
tuber meristems during the initial stages of sprouting and StARF6 expression seemed
to parallel changes in meristem growth rate. These results are consistent with the role
for endogenous auxins in tuber sprout growth (see 14.5.1). In a related study, a potato
TCP-like transcription factor has also been identified and exhibited the inverse pattern
of expression (Faivre-Rampant et al., 2004b). StTCP expression was highest in dormant
meristems and could not be detected in libraries prepared from sprouting buds or in buds
released from apical dominance (paradormancy). Interestingly, all members of the TCP
family characterized seem to function as either positive or negative regulators of cell
proliferation (Cubas et al., 1999).

Collectively, these studies are beginning to assemble an increasingly detailed descrip-
tion of differential gene expression during dormancy progression that will only become
more refined as additional research is reported. In addition to these studies, sporadic
reports describing changes in expression of various genes during tuber dormancy have
appeared. However, the studies reported to date shed no light on the specific mechanisms
of tuber dormancy control. It is possible that the ‘master’ control genes are very low
abundance genes and therefore will escape detection using global survey techniques. The
central question remains: will we know the control (master) genes when we find them?

14.5 HORMONAL REGULATION OF TUBER DORMANCY

Dormancy is a highly regulated phase of development that is crucial to plant survival.
Successful progression from active growth to dormancy and, finally, to sprouting involves
all tuber tissues and therefore requires physiological coordination. Integration of plant
developmental cues is dependent on the synthesis and action of growth regulators or
hormones. In Sections 14.5.1–14.5.7, the role(s) of all major classes of plant hormones in
tuber dormancy control will be discussed. This topic has been the subject of several recent
reviews (Coleman, 1987b; Wiltshire and Cobb, 1996; Suttle, 2004a). At first glance,
much of the data reported in the literature appears fragmented and contradictory. This
confusion is largely the result of disparate methods of hormone analysis (bioassay vs.
physio-chemical analysis) and the choice of tissues for analysis. Where possible, these
discrepancies will be explored and (hopefully) resolved.

14.5.1 Auxins

Using an Avena bioassay, Guthrie (1940) found that the content of auxin rose in tubers
whose dormancy had been terminated by ethylene chlorohydrin treatment. However, this
increase was observed only after the tubers began to visibly sprout, and he concluded that

Dormancy and sprouting

295

the increase in indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content was a reflection of sprout growth rather
than the cause. The content of bioactive acidic auxin during natural tuber dormancy pro-
gression was lowest during the initial period of dormancy, rose as storage was extended,
and reached a maximum immediately prior to visible sprouting (Hemberg, 1942).

The introduction of more sophisticated methods of hormone analysis has not greatly
clarified this situation. Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled
with fluorometric detection, Sukhova et al. (1993) found that the content of IAA remained
constant during tuber dormancy rising only after sprouting commenced. In more recent
studies using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) together with internal
standards, Sorce et al. (2000) determined that the content of free, ester- and amide-linked
IAA in eye tissues isolated from tubers stored at 23
C increased during storage and
(cid:2)
reached a maximum coincident with 50% sprouting. In tubers stored at 3
C (where sprout
growth is suppressed), loss of tuber dormancy (in the absence of sprout growth) was
accompanied by only a small increase in free IAA, and maximum IAA content coincided
with the commencement of sprout growth. These observations suggest that IAA content
reflects sprout growth rather than bud dormancy.

(cid:2)

Exogenous auxin has no apparent effect on dormant tubers (Hemberg, 1985). In non-
dormant tubers, exogenous auxin elicits a bi-phasic response. The application of high
concentrations of IAA to non-dormant tubers results in a dose-dependent temporary inhi-
bition of sprout growth (Guthrie, 1940). Synthetic auxins (i.e. 1-naphthalene acetic acid
and 2,4,-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid) elicit a more pronounced and protracted inhibition
(Suttle, 2003). By contrast, the application of lower (cid:2)≤1 mg L
−1(cid:3) concentrations of IAA
to single-eye tuber pieces resulted in a modest stimulation of sprout growth (Hemberg,
1949a). There have been no reports describing the effects of ectopic expression of bac-
terial auxin biosynthesis genes on tuber development or dormancy. However, ectopic
expression of the Agrobacterium rhizogenes rol C gene under the control of a CaMV 35S
RNA promoter in potato resulted in increased IAA content and altered tuber morphology,
but no effects on tuber dormancy were noted (Fladung, 1990; Schmülling et al., 1993).
In addition, expression of a bacterial IAA-lysine synthetase gene under the control of
the CaMV 35S promoter in potatoes resulted in phenotypic changes and reduced IAA
content, but again, no effects on tuber dormancy were noted (Spena et al., 1991).

Taken as a whole and as first proposed by Guthrie (1940), these results suggest that
endogenous auxins are not cognate regulators of tuber dormancy but may play a role
in the regulation of subsequent sprout growth. This is consistent with the proposed role
of auxins as essential mediators of plant cell cycle progression at the G-2/M transition
(Francis and Sorrell, 2001; Del Pozo et al., 2005), which is beyond the position of cell
cycle arrest in dormant tubers (MacDonald and Osborne, 1988; Campbell et al., 1996).

14.5.2 Abscisic acid

Bioassay of plant extracts following paper chromatography typically results in zones of
growth-promoting (auxin-like) and growth-inhibiting substances. Hemberg (1949a) was
the first to recognize the potential significance of the growth-inhibiting substances in
tuber dormancy. In a series of thorough studies, it was shown that the loss of tuber
dormancy (through both natural progression and premature chemical termination) was

296

Suttle

accompanied by a dramatic decline in acidic (but not neutral) inhibitors (for review, see
Hemberg, 1985). Similar observations were made in studies on winter bud dormancy
in Fraxinus (Hemberg, 1949b). With the identification of ABA as a component of
the inhibitor complex (Cornforth et al., 1966), attention was focused on the role of
ABA in dormancy. The application of crude potato extracts containing ABA (and other
inhibitors) temporarily inhibits sprout growth (Blumenthal-Goldschmidt and Rappaport,
1965; Franklin and Hemberg, 1980). Exogenous ABA transiently inhibits sprout growth
in non-dormant tubers in a dose-dependent manner (El-Antably et al., 1967; Holst, 1971).
ABA content in potato tubers has been determined using both bioassay and, more
recently, very sensitive and specific instrumental analyses. In one of the earliest inves-
tigations using instrumental analysis, Korableva et al. (1980) reported that tuber ABA
content was highest in growing points (buds?) and periderm and lowest in storage tissues
and that termination of dormancy was accompanied by substantial declines (>85%) in
ABA content in all tissues examined. Similar results were reported by Coleman and King
(1984) and Cvikrová et al. (1994). However, in the former study, significant declines
in tuber ABA were observed in only two of three cultivars examined, whereas in the
latter study, tuber ABA content was highest during mid-dormancy and declined dra-
matically thereafter. The ABA content of thin (1–2 mm) periderm discs containing the
apical bud complex was highest at harvest and declined steadily during storage (Suttle,
1995). ABA content in stored tubers was inversely proportional to storage temperatures,
C(cid:3) storage temperatures. Consistent
whereas the rate of decline was lowest at cooler (cid:2)3
with earlier observations (Coleman and King, 1984), no definite minimum threshold level
of ABA required for commencement of sprouting was identified. Similarly, in a study
of six cultivars with varying lengths of dormancy, Biemelt et al. (2000) reported that
ABA content declined in all varieties during storage but found no correlation between
final ABA levels and sprouting behavior. Breakage of tuber dormancy with the synthetic
cytokinin thidiazuron and heat stress was also accompanied by a decline in ABA content
(Ji and Wang, 1988; Van den Berg et al., 1991). By contrast, Sorce et al. (1996) measured
ABA content in several tissues of potato during storage at two temperatures and found
that the concentration of ABA in ‘eyes’ was at a minimum at harvest and exhibited a
modest rise coincident with sprouting. Recent studies from our laboratory using liquid
chromatography (LC)–MS–selected ion monitoring (SIM) have demonstrated that a sub-
stantial decline in ABA content of tuber eyes occurred during dormancy progression,
whereas the ABA content of the surrounding periderm and underlying cortex exhibited
only modest reductions (Destefano-Beltrán et al., 2006a).

(cid:2)

An ABA-deficient mutant of potato was identified and given the trivial name ‘Droopy’
(Quarrie, 1982). Biochemical analysis suggested that
this mutant was impaired in
the oxidation of ABA aldehyde to ABA (Duckham et al., 1989). Unfortunately, the
effects of this mutation on tuber dormancy cannot be determined because this mutation
occurs in Solanum phureja, a species known for its near-total lack of tuber dormancy
(Hawkes, 1992).

Definitive proof of a role for endogenous ABA in potato tuber dormancy was obtained
using a single-node, in vitro microtuber system and the phytoene desaturase inhibitor
fluridone (Fig. 14.3). Under the culture conditions used, microtubers were harvested after
9 weeks of growth and remained dormant for approximately 15–20 weeks thereafter

(Suttle and Hultstrand, 1994). Continuous exposure to fluridone during development
resulted in premature sprouting after only 3–6 weeks of in vitro culture. The inclusion
of (cid:2)±(cid:3) ABA in the fluridone-containing medium restored endogenous ABA content
to control levels and suppressed microtuber sprouting. Furthermore, the application of
fluridone to fully developed and dormant microtubers after 9 weeks of culture also resulted
in premature sprouting. These results are consistent with an essential role for endogenous
ABA in the induction and maintenance of tuber dormancy.

ABA is synthesized from an oxygenated C40 carotenoid (xanthophyll) precursor through
a series of cleavage and oxidation reactions (Seo and Koshiba, 2002; Nambara and
Marion-Poll, 2005). In most plants, the rate-limiting step of ABA biosynthesis is catalyzed
by either zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) or 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED).
Transgenic down-regulation of ZEP expression through either antisense or co-suppression
resulted in numerous transformants with greatly elevated tuber contents of zeaxanthin
(up to 134-fold), violaxanthin (approximately 4-fold), and neoxanthin (approximately
3-fold), all of which had normal ABA contents (Römer et al., 2002). Similarly, the

298

Suttle

transformation of potatoes with a bacterial phytoene synthase gene under the control of
a tuber-specific promoter resulted in tubers with greatly elevated contents of zeaxanthin,
violaxanthin, and neoxanthin and normal levels of ABA (Ducreux et al., 2005). These
observations suggest that regulation of tuber ABA biosynthesis occurs downstream of ZEP
activity.

(cid:5)

Recent studies from this laboratory have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
regulating ABA content during tuber dormancy (Destefano-Beltrán et al., 2006a). Genes
encoding proteins catalyzing the final post-zeaxanthin steps of ABA biosynthesis and the
-hydroxylase have been cloned and characterized from tuber
catabolic enzyme ABA-8
tissues (Fig. 14.4). Analyses using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain
reaction (qRT–PCR) have demonstrated a highly dynamic and tissue-specific pattern of
expression during dormancy progression and have tentatively identified key regulatory
steps. In particular, ABA biosynthesis in tuber meristems appears to be regulated at the
level of NCED 2 expression, whereas ABA catabolism is temporally correlated with
(cid:5)
-hydroxylase genes. Changes in meristem ABA
expression of two of four putative ABA-8
content following chemically forced termination of tuber dormancy were also accompa-
-hydroxylase genes (Destefano-Beltrán

et al., 2006b).

14.5.3 Ethylene

The involvement of ethylene in tuber dormancy is incompletely understood. The effects of
exogenous ethylene on dormancy are dependent on both cultivar and duration of treatment.
Long-term (approximately 4 weeks) treatment with ethylene hastened the sprouting of
tubers once the gas was removed (Rosa, 1925). Subsequent studies failed to confirm
this observation (Denny, 1926). Rylski et al. (1974) demonstrated that a 72-h treatment
with ethylene shortened the length of dormancy, but continuous exposure to ethylene
inhibited sprout growth. These observations were corroborated by Prange et al. (1998),
who also showed that sprout number (per tuber) was increased by long-term ethylene
C, reducing ethylene concentrations in storage below
treatment. In tubers stored at 20
0.01 ppm (v/v) increased the duration of dormancy and reduced total sprout number after
35 days (Wills et al., 2003). Post-harvest treatment with ethylene-releasing compounds
has been reported to either hasten or delay tuber sprouting (Rama and Narasimham, 1982;
Cvikrová et al., 1994).

(cid:2)

Ethylene production is very low in intact dormant tubers but rises as sprout growth
commences (Poapst et al., 1968; Creech et al., 1973; Okazawa, 1974). Wounding of
tubers induced a substantial increase in ethylene production that persisted for 72 h (Lulai
and Suttle, 2004). Because of this, ethylene production from excised (i.e. wounded) tuber
tissues cannot be used to assay the situation in undamaged tubers during dormancy.
Cvikrová et al. (1994) reported a transient surge in ethylene production in freshly har-
vested tubers followed by a very low rate of production that persisted for the duration
of dormancy and then rose again as sprouting commenced. Although intact tubers were
used in this study, it is possible that the initial transient rise in ethylene production was
a response to the stresses and tissue damage that often accompany harvest. Exposure
to various dormancy-breaking agents resulted in increased ethylene production coinci-
dent with the onset of sprout growth (Suttle, unpublished). Despite these observations,
the significance (if any) of this sprouting-associated increase in ethylene production is
unclear.

Potatoes (cultivar Russet Burbank) have been transformed with the Arabidopsis ETR1
gene in both the sense and the antisense orientations (Haines et al., 2003). Regardless of
transgene orientation, transformed plants exhibited many phenotypic alterations including
modified leaf size and shape and malformed tubers with swollen eyes. When stored at
C, no change in tuber dormancy was noted in any of the transformants, but when
20
C, two of the antisense lines failed to sprout after 2 years. It is not clear
stored at 4
whether this indicates a change in tuber dormancy duration or reflects an exaggerated
sensitivity to cold temperatures.

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

Ethylene has been shown to play a critical role in the induction of tuber dormancy.
Following subculture of single-node explants under tuberizing conditions, the rate of
ethylene production was highest during the initial 2 weeks of in vitro culture and declined
precipitously thereafter (Suttle, 1998a). Continuous exposure of tuberizing explants at
the time of transfer to the non-competitive ethylene antagonist silver nitrate or the com-
petitive antagonist 2,5-norbornadiene (NBD) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in
precocious sprouting (Fig. 14.5). Exposure of NBD-treated explants to ethylene inhibited
precocious sprouting. Interestingly, the period of ethylene sensitivity was observed only

during the initial period of in vitro culture. These results are consistent with a role for
endogenous ethylene in the induction of tuber dormancy. Its role thereafter remains purely
speculative.

14.5.4 Gibberellins

Together with ABA, gibberellins (GAs) have been posited to play a critical role in the
processes of seed dormancy and germination (Raz et al., 2001). As first reported by Brian
et al. (1955) and verified by others (Rappaport et al., 1958), application of GAs to tubers
typically breaks dormancy and results in precocious sprouting. GA-like activity is low in
dormant tubers and increases as sprouting commences (Smith and Rappaport, 1961; Boo,
1962; Bialek and Bieli´nska-Czarnecka, 1975). Interpretation of these bioassay results
is complicated by the presence of large amounts of interfering phenolic acids in tuber
peel extracts. Nevertheless, GAs have long been considered to play a role as cognate
dormancy-terminating hormones in tubers (Hemberg, 1985).

→ GA1

→ GA20

Recent evidence does not support a role for endogenous GAs in tuber dormancy control.
The endogenous GAs of potato are members of the early 13-hydroxylation pathway
→ GA8 (Hedden
arranged in the following biosynthetic sequence: GA19
and Phillips, 2000). GA1 is considered to be the bioactive hormone and GA8 an inactive
metabolite (Jones et al., 1988; Van den Berg et al., 1995; Carrera et al., 2000). Consistent
with this view, injection of GA19(cid:4) GA20, or GA1 but not GA8 prematurely terminated
tuber dormancy (Suttle, 2004b). The endogenous contents of GA19(cid:4) GA20, and GA1 were
relatively high immediately after harvest, declined during storage (when dormancy was
deepest), and rose to the highest levels during the period of robust sprout growth (Suttle,
2004b). Interestingly, at the time of initial sprouting, internal levels of these bioactive
GAs were lower than those found in deeply dormant tubers. Tuber dormancy progression
in a dwarf mutant of potato was similar to that of the normal phenotype despite the

Dormancy and sprouting

301

absence of detectable levels of tuber GA1 at any stage of dormancy (Fig. 14.6), and the
application of various GA biosynthesis inhibitors to developing microtubers was found to
stimulate precocious sprouting (Suttle, 2004b). In addition, although artificial elevation
of endogenous GA content by ectopic expression of GA 20-oxidase resulted in premature
tuber sprouting, reduction of endogenous GAs in potato plants using an antisense approach
had no effect on tuber dormancy but reduced subsequent sprout elongation (Carrera et al.,
2000). Collectively, these results do not support a role for endogenous GAs in tuber
dormancy per se but are consistent with a role in subsequent sprout growth.

14.5.5 Cytokinins

The role of cytokinins in seed and bud dormancy has not been clearly defined. Cytokinins
are thought to play a permissive (rather than essential) role in seed dormancy especially
under suboptimal conditions (Thomas, 1990). Although cytokinins have been implicated
in the release of buds from apical dominance (Chatfield et al., 2000), their role in sea-
sonal endodormancy is uncertain (Powell, 1987). The application of natural and synthetic
cytokinins to dormant tubers rapidly breaks dormancy and results in sprouting of multiple
eyes (Hemberg, 1970). Ectopic expression of the bacterial shoot-inducing Ti TL-DNA in
tubers resulted in massive wholesale increases in cytokinin content and increased pre-
mature sprouting (Ooms and Lenton, 1985). Cytokinin-like bioactivity is low in dormant
tubers, and sprouting is accompanied by increased cytokinin-like activity (Engelbrecht
and Bieli´nska-Czarnecka, 1972; Van Staden and Dimalla, 1978; Koda, 1982; Banas et al.,
1984). As in the case of GAs, the interpretation of bioassay results using crude extracts of
potato tubers is complicated by the presence of large amounts of interfering substances.
Furthermore, endogenous cytokinins are chemically diverse and readily interconvertible
and require significant purification prior to meaningful analysis.

Despite these concerns, more recent immunological techniques have largely confirmed
the bioassay data and have provided a more thorough understanding of the complex
metabolic dynamics of these hormones during dormancy progression. An increase in
total immuno-reactive cytokinins in un-fractionated tuber extracts occurred coincident
with sprouting (Turnbull and Hanke, 1985b; Sukhova et al., 1993). Additional studies
with HPLC-fractionated extracts and side-chain-specific monoclonal antibodies found
an increase in bioactive isopentenyl- and trans-zeatin-type cytokinins immediately prior
to the onset of sprouting in tubers stored under both growth-permissive (cid:2)20
C(cid:3) and
(cid:2)
growth-inhibiting (cid:2)3
C(cid:3) temperatures (Fig. 14.7, left panel; Suttle, 1998b). Interestingly,
the content of cis-zeatin also increased prior to sprout growth (Fig. 14.7, right panel;
Suttle and Banowetz, 2000). Tuber dormancy was rapidly broken by treatment with either
cytokinin isomer, suggesting a potential role for cis-cytokinins in dormancy regulation.
Cytokinins are rapidly metabolized in plant tissues (Auer, 2002). Immediately after
harvest and during the initial period of storage, exogenous cytokinins have no effect on
dormancy (Turnbull and Hanke, 1985a; Suttle, 2002). As storage was extended, tubers
developed a time-dependent increase in cytokinin sensitivity. The acquisition of cytokinin
sensitivity was not accompanied by significant changes in the qualitative or quantitative
pattern of cytokinin metabolism, which suggested that other aspects of signal transduction
were affected by tuber dormancy status (Suttle, 2002).

Cytokinins are defined by their ability to stimulate cell division (Mok and Mok,
2001). In addition, cytokinins appear to be required for cell cycle progression through the
G1/S transition (Francis and Sorrell, 2001; Del Pozo et al., 2005). These characteristics,
together with the observed changes in cytokinin content during dormancy and the ability
of exogenous cytokinins to terminate dormancy and stimulate sprouting, suggest that
cytokinins are cognate regulators of tuber dormancy exit in potatoes.

14.5.6 Other endogenous growth substances

It has become clear that, in addition to the five original classes of hormones, plant
development is regulated by a diverse array of endogenous signaling molecules (Davies,
2004). The role of these ‘non-classical’ hormones in tuber dormancy control has received
only limited attention.

The original studies of Hemberg and associates found a correlation between tuber
dormancy and the activity of a chromatographic zone known as inhibitor ß (Hemberg,
1985). Although ABA was shown to be a component of this fraction (Milborrow, 1967),
inhibitor ß is a complex mixture of many compounds, most notably phenolic acids
(Köves, 1957; Holst, 1971). Additional chromatographic fractionation demonstrated that
the decline in growth-inhibiting activity of inhibitor ß isolated from tuber peels during
storage could not solely be ascribed to a decline in ABA content (Holst, 1971; Franklin
and Hemberg, 1980). Thus, other uncharacterized inhibitors in tuber extracts decline
during storage and may play a role in dormancy control.

Jasmonates (JAs) and biosynthetically related compounds (oxylipins) have pronounced
effects on potato development, and a hydroxylated derivative of JA (tuberonic acid) is
one of the most potent inducers of in vitro tuberization and may play a role in tuberization
in planta (Yoshihara et al., 1989). Although exogenous JA has been reported to inhibit
sprout growth during storage and JA occurs in non-wounded tubers and sprouts (Abdala
et al., 2000; Fauconnier et al., 2003), its role as a cognate regulator of tuber dormancy
is uncertain. The endogenous content of JA in potato plants has been elevated by ectopic
expression of a flax allene oxide synthetase gene and reduced by expression of an (cid:5)3
fatty acid desaturase in an antisense orientation (Harms et al., 1995; Martin et al., 1999).
In neither case was there any mention of any effects of transformation on tuber JA content
or dormancy progression. Similarly, brassinolides are a distinct class of bioregulators with
numerous effects on plant development (Clouse and Sasse, 1998), and although treatment
with brassinolide suppressed tuber sprouting (Korableva et al., 2002), the effects of tuber
dormancy on endogenous levels of this class of bioregulators and their possible role(s) in
tuber dormancy control are unknown.

Tubers (especially the periderm) contain a number of compounds that can affect
sprout growth (Burton and Meigh, 1971). Several of these compounds are volatile and
can accumulate in storage atmospheres at growth-inhibiting concentrations. In particular,
tubers produce 1,4-dimethylnaphthalene and 1,6-dimethylnaphthalene, both of which are
potent growth inhibitors (Meigh et al., 1973). The effects of dormancy status on the
production of these inhibitors and the role of these compounds in tuber dormancy are
unknown.

14.5.7 Hormonal regulation of tuber dormancy: an overview

A model incorporating current knowledge of the role of endogenous hormones in tuber
dormancy is shown in Fig. 14.8. At formation and generally extending well-past harvest,
tubers are highly dormant. During storage, dormancy gradually weakens and, ultimately,
terminates resulting in sprouting. Both ABA and ethylene are required for the induc-
tion of dormancy, but only ABA appears necessary for the maintenance of dormancy.
Endogenous contents of bioactive cytokinins are low in dormant tubers, and tubers
are insensitive to exogenous cytokinins. Dormant tubers actively metabolize ABA and
cytokinins throughout storage. As storage is extended and dormancy begins to weaken,
ABA content in meristems declines and tubers acquire cytokinin sensitivity. An increase
in cytokinin content slightly precedes or accompanies the onset of tuber sprouting. Sprout
growth is accompanied by increases in GA and IAA contents. As currently envisioned,
ABA and cytokinins are the principal regulators of tuber dormancy.

14.6 SPROUT GROWTH AND PHYSIOLOGICAL AGING

The rate and pattern of sprout growth (vigor) change with time (Krijthe, 1962). Immedi-
ately following the termination of dormancy, sprout growth rate is low, and this may reflect
the lingering effects of dormancy-imposed growth inhibition. As storage is extended, the
rate of sprout growth increases to a maximum, and typically, one sprout becomes domi-
nant in an uncut tuber. At this stage, the inhibited buds are in a state of paradormancy or
correlative inhibition.

From a biological standpoint, seed tuber longevity need not exceed 8–9 months, and
during storage extending beyond this point, sprout number and vigor change dramatically.

Dormancy and sprouting

305

With extended storage, initially correlative inhibition between eyes is lost and uncut
tubers exhibit multiple sprouts. Later, apical dominance within an eye is weakened and
individual eyes display multiple sprouts that branch profusely. In the final stage, sprout
growth is supplanted by the formation of small tubers, a condition known as little tuber
syndrome.

The entire process (from tuber formation to little tuber disorder) is known as physio-
logical aging, and it has dramatic effects on subsequent plant growth and tuber yield (Van
der Zaag and van Loon, 1987). Physiological aging of tubers is affected by both pre- and
post-harvest conditions, most notably temperature (Jenkins et al., 1993). The application
of GA dramatically increased the elongation of sprouts in tubers recently emerged from
dormancy (Suttle, 2004b), and exogenous auxin restored apical dominance and reversed
age-induced effects on subsequent plant field performance (Mikitzel and Knowles, 1990).
The deteriorative changes seen with extended storage are accompanied by wholesale
changes in tissue permeability, membrane lipid composition, tissue free radical content,
and lipid peroxidation (Kumar and Knowles, 1993; Fauconnier et al., 2002; Zabrouskov
and Knowles, 2002; Zabrouskov et al., 2002). Thus, the process of physiological aging
can be divided into two phases: the initial changes in seed tuber performance and sprout
growth, which appear to result from changes in hormone balance, and the latter changes
leading to seed tuber deterioration and, ultimately, death, which resemble changes seen
in other forms of plant senescence.

14.7 CONCLUSIONS

Despite tremendous progress in the past decade, the primary cognate processes control-
ling potato tuber dormancy remain an enigma. Much has been learned about the effects
of tuber dormancy status on gene expression, protein levels, enzyme activities, and hor-
mone content. However, the fundamental processes that control the transition between
cell cycle arrest/metabolic depression and resumption of meristem growth and metabolic
activity remain unknown. Unlike the situation in a number of other plant and non-plant
systems whose life cycles include a period of metabolic depression and growth arrest,
release from tuber dormancy is not dependent on specific environmental cue(s). Further-
more, the dormant tuber meristem is fully hydrated and metabolically competent. Thus,
it is entirely possible that primary control of tuber meristem dormancy is metabolic in
nature, with changes in gene expression secondary. In this scenario, dormancy exit would
occur as a result of a progressive decline in one or more inhibitory factor(s) or the grad-
ual accumulation of growth-promoting factor(s). Sprouting would occur once a specific
threshold concentration was achieved. This hypothetical metabolic trigger could be a
specific chemical entity (hormone, covalently modified protein/enzyme) or physiologic
state such as redox potential (Claassens et al., 2005), energy charge (Bonhomme et al.,
2000), intracellular pH (Robert et al., 1999), ion content, or membrane function (Aue
et al., 2000; Rinne and van der Schoot, 2003).

The application of molecular genetics and biotechnology to dormancy research will
undoubtedly reveal new insights into dormancy-control mechanisms. The selective over-
and under-expression of candidate genes may greatly aid in this endeavor, but care must

306

Suttle

be taken in interpreting the results of these studies. The ectopic over-expression of genes
has been shown to induce non-physiological responses in other tissues. Conversely, down-
regulation of genes can lead to non-specific growth inhibition unrelated to dormancy-
imposed arrest. Thus, pleiotropic effects of single-gene manipulations are common. For
example, ectopic expression of a bacterial pyrophosphatase gene in potatoes results in
dramatic increases in tuber pyrophosphatase activity, marked declines in pyrophosphate
content, and either accelerated or completely inhibited sprouting behavior (cf. Hajirezaei
and Sonnewald, 1999; Farré et al., 2001).

Regardless of the approaches taken, new information concerning the internal processes
controlling potato tuber sprouting will result in improved storage technologies, enhanced
market and nutritional value, and reduced post-harvest losses due to physiological and
pathogen-induced deterioration.

15.1 INTRODUCTION

Around 95% of the potato biomass is constituted of the elements carbon (C), hydrogen
and oxygen that the plant absorbs through the assimilation of carbon dioxide and the
uptake of water. The rest of the biomass is composed of a range of elements that have
to be absorbed from the soil solution, where they are usually delivered through the
application of fertilizers. The beneficial effect of adding mineral nutrients to soils to
improve plant growth has been exploited in agriculture for more than 2000 years, but
only in the nineteenth century was the scientific discipline of plant nutrition established
by Justus von Liebig. Since then, large amounts of potash, superphosphate and inorganic
nitrogen (N) have been applied to improve crop yield, and this practice contributes
largely to the increase of crop productivity that was achieved in the past century. The
excess use of fertilizers, however, also negatively impacts the environment, whereas
developing countries usually cannot afford to provide sufficient nutrients to ensure food
security. In addition, the production of N fertilizers through the Haber–Bosch procedure
is extremely energy demanding, giving agricultural production systems usually a negative
energy balance. For all these reasons, people are trying to breed or genetically engineer
crops to optimize their nutrient acquisition and utilization efficiency. Especially some
potato varieties are extremely nutrient inefficient due to their adaptation to high-input
production systems (Sattelmacher et al., 1990). To achieve more nutrient-efficient plants,
a general understanding of the molecular physiology of nutrient uptake, distribution
and utilization is needed. In this chapter, these issues will be discussed with special
emphasis on potato. An overview of plant nutrients, their occurrence and their functions
is given in Table 15.1. They are grouped into macro- and micro-nutrients depending on
the concentration that can be found in plant tissues. Focus will be given to our current
knowledge on the uptake and utilization of the macro-nutrients N and phosphate, which
are most often limiting potato yield.

15.2 NITROGEN

Nitrogen is the most abundant element after carbon, oxygen and hydrogen in biomass.
The reason for this is that N is a constituent of amino acids, proteins, nucleotides and
nucleic acids to name the most important molecules. Sub-optimal N supply immediately
leads to growth retardation, whereas super-optimal supply leads to unwanted increases
in the shoot/root ratio that might negatively impact the acquisition of other nutrients
and water (Marschner, 1995). Fertilizer N is almost exclusively synthesized from N and
hydrogen gas by the Haber–Bosch process that generates ammonia. Of the energy required
to produce the three major fertilizer nutrients, 87% is consumed in ammonia synthesis.
Fertilizer N represents the largest fossil-derived energy input for crop production in
developed countries and represents one of the major barriers for energy crop production.
However, if farmers stopped using fertilizer, crop yields would drop to a low level
(Mengel, 1992).

The demand for fertilizer N could partially be covered by rotation or intercropping
with N-fixing leguminous species (such as beans, clover, lupins or peas). Such sustainable
cropping systems also are established for potato production, which could be optimized
if it was possible to enhance the N acquisition and utilization efficiency of the potato
varieties. Also potato plants are inefficient in their uptake and use of fertilizer N, with
only about 50% of the applied N taken up.

The N not recovered by the crop may cause environmental problems such as pollution

of ground water and run-off to surface waters.

15.2.1 Nitrogen uptake

Nitrogen fertilizers are supplied in three forms, ammonia, nitrate and urea. Urea usually is
readily hydrolyzed by the ubiquitous enzyme urease to release ammonia. Uptake systems
for all three forms of inorganic N have been described in higher plants (Williams and
Miller, 2001; Liu et al., 2003). Most of the genes encoding such transporters have been
biochemically characterized in the model organisms Arabidopsis and rice and, to a lesser
extent, in tomato, but none of them in potato. However, because the uptake systems are
in general quite similar between plant species, it can be assumed that similar systems are
also operating in the potato, also given the close relationship of potato to tomato.

The nitrate uptake system of higher plants consists of a constitutive, low affinity
transport system (LATS) and an inducible, high affinity transport system (HATS). The
HATS are distinguished by whether they are substrate induced (iHATS) or constitutively
active (cHATS) (Aslam et al., 1992). In Arabidopsis there are two genes encoding
LATS, AtNRT1.1 and AtNRT1.2, respectively. The AtNRT1.1 gene (formerly called CHL1)
was originally isolated by T-DNA tagging, but the mutant phenotype was described
much earlier and had been selected by resistance to the toxic nitrate homologue chlorate
(Doddema and Telkamp, 1979). Again in Arabidopsis, there are seven genes that encode
proteins for HATS, designated AtNRT2.

Nitrite is also transported by two systems, of which the low-affinity system may play a
greater role than in nitrate uptake. By uptake competition studies, the high-affinity system

314

Bucher and Kossmann

has been shown to be identical with that of nitrate transport, although not in all of the
cases studied (Ullrich, 1992).

For ammonium again, HATS and LATS exist. Ammonium ions are taken up by a
saturable, but apparently constitutive, carrier system with high substrate affinity, which
may carry out ammonium uniport as long as H
-ATPases establish a proton gradient.
The low-affinity component of transport is stimulated by high external pH and probably
reflects diffusion of uncharged NH3 across the lipid phase of the plasmalemma. Three
ammonium transporters have been identified in Arabidopsis roots: constitutive, diurnally
regulated and starvation-induced (Gazzarrini et al., 1999).

+

Only recently a high-affinity uptake system for urea has been identified in Arabidopsis
that was designated AtDUR3 (Liu et al., 2003). This was identified based on homologies
to a corresponding yeast gene ScDUR3, complementation of the corresponding yeast
+
mutant and through expression in Xenopus oocytes, and was shown to be an urea/H
symporter.

15.2.2 Nitrogen assimilation

The nitrogenous compounds that are taken up from the soil solution need to be assimilated
to enter metabolism. Ammonia is probably released from urea due to the action of urease,
an enzyme that is present in sufficient amounts and not rate-limiting in the process of
urea assimilation (Witte et al., 2002). Ammonia will then be incorporated into organic
compounds by a range of enzymes (Section 15.2.2.2). Nitrate first needs to be reduced
to form ammonia by the consecutive action of nitrate and nitrite reductases (NiRs).

15.2.2.1 Nitrate reduction

Nitrate reductase (NR) catalyzes the first reaction in nitrate assimilation, the reduction
of nitrate to nitrite. Nitrate reductase requires molybdenum (Mo) as cofactor. Nitrate
reductase in higher plants is proposed to be a homodimer, with two identical subunits
joined and held together by the Mo cofactor (Kleinhofs et al., 1989).

Two cDNAs representing two alleles of the NR from potato have been described (Harris
et al., 2000), which closely resemble the respective Arabidopsis encoding sequences and
the ones from other plant species.

Ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (Fd-NiR) subsequently catalyzes the six-electron reduction
of nitrite to ammonia, using reduced Fd as the electron donor. The Fd-dependent NiRs
of plants, algae and cyanobacteria are monomeric proteins with molecular masses near
63 kDa which contain a single [4Fe-4S] cluster and a single siroheme (which serves as
the binding site for nitrite) as prosthetic groups (Dose et al., 1997). Ferredoxin-NiR has
been cloned from several higher plant species; however, no corresponding sequence so
far has been isolated from potato.

In higher plants, nitrate reduction is highly regulated. A range of environmental factors
influence the expression of the corresponding genes as well as the enzyme activity levels.
NR activity expression and activity is controlled by light, temperature, pH, CO2(cid:2) O2,
water potential and N source. Drought for instance causes increased NR protein turnover
and accelerated mRNA turnover (Ferrario-Mery et al., 1998; Foyer et al., 1998).

Mineral nutrition of the potato

Spinach leaf NR undergoes a reversible phosphorylation in response to light/dark
transitions, which leads to an inactivation of the enzyme (Huber et al., 1992). The
low-activity, phosphorylated form of NR from darkened leaves of spinach is activated
during purification, because it is separated from a approximately 110-kDa NR inhibitory
protein (NIP). Re-addition of NIP inactivated the purified phosphorylated NR, but not
the active dephosphorylated form of NR, indicating that the inactivation of NR requires
both, phosphorylation and interaction with NIP. In addition, NR that had been inactivated
in vitro through phosphorylation, and interaction with NIP could be reactivated either by
dephosphorylation or by dissociation of NIP from NR (MacKintosh et al., 1995).

NIP has been shown to be a member of the family of 14-3-3 proteins. 14-3-3 proteins are
chaperone proteins that modulate interactions between components of signal transduction
cascades and enzymes, which finally results in the activation or inactivation of the
interacting proteins (Aitken, 1996; Wu et al., 1997). 14-3-3-protein-binding proteins in
plants amongst others also include NR and sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS). Extensive
work has been performed in potato to modulate the expression level of different isoforms
of the 14-3-3 proteins (Zuk et al., 2003, 2005). Transgenic potato plants with lowered
levels of five isoforms of the 14-3-3 proteins show increased NR as well as SPS activities,
which ultimately leads to an increased productivity of the plants as they accumulated
more starch in their tubers in greenhouse experiments. These experiments were done
using a constitutive promoter. The authors therefore speculate that the increases in starch
accumulation are a result of enhanced sucrose supply from the source leaves.

These results are in agreement with observations made with transgenic tobacco plants
carrying an NR with an N-terminal deletion and hence an enzyme that is not subjected
to phosphorylation, which results in the abolishment of post-transcriptional regulation
of NR by light and higher NR activities (Nussaume et al., 1995). This could be due to
a difference in dissociation of the NR–NIP complex (Lillo et al., 1997) or a different
way of binding for 14-3-3 in the truncated NR (Provan et al., 2000). The truncated and
deregulated form of NR also was over-expressed in transgenic potato plants. In agreement
with the experiments where the 14-3-3 protein expression was reduced, under some
environmental conditions the plants showed an increased productivity (Djennane et al.,
2002, 2004). The only change that was seen, however, was a reduction of the nitrate
contents of the transgenic potato tubers, which might support the speculation that rather
the higher activation status of SPS is the reason for the enhanced productivity of plants
with reduced 14-3-3 protein levels.

Our understanding of the regulation of the close coordination of N and carbon
metabolism is only now emerging. Metabolite levels are often determined in order to
provide information about responses to physiological or environmental changes. In the
past, this has been applied to isolated aspects of metabolism, but today methodology is
being developed that allows measuring increasing amounts of different metabolites simul-
taneously. In an example where a group of isolated metabolites were analyzed, e.g. in
tobacco transformants with very low NR activity, it has been shown that nitrate acts
as a signal to induce organic acid metabolism and repress starch metabolism (Scheible
et al., 1997). These transformants show changes similar to those seen in nitrate-limited
wildtype plants except that they accumulate large amounts of nitrate. The high lev-
els of nitrate induce genes that encode NR, NiR, a cytosolic glutamate synthase (GS)

316

Bucher and Kossmann

(glutamine: 2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase or Fd-GOGAT), phosphoenolpyruvate car-
boxylase, cytosolic pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase,
whereas ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase transcript abundance and activity decreases.
In the plants with reduced NR activity, nitrate probably acts as a signal to initiate coordi-
nated changes in carbon and N metabolism (Scheible et al., 1997). These kind of studies
are now extended to a broader range of metabolites, transcripts and ideally also pro-
teins (Stitt and Fernie, 2003; Usadel et al., 2005), mainly in the model Arabidopsis, but
increasingly also in other species as the functional genomics toolboxes become available.
In a comparison of potato tubers from several genotypes altered in the import or degra-
dation of sucrose, many relationships between metabolites in carbon and N metabolism
were uncovered (Roessner et al., 2001a,b). Some of the relations were expected, because
they occurred between close neighbours in metabolic pathways. Other relations, however,
were between less-related groups of metabolites or occurred only in certain genotypes
indicating novel regulatory mechanisms. These techniques should now also be applied to
transgenic potatoes with modifications in N metabolism, e.g. the plants with enhanced
NR activity. It will be exciting to see how this will further our understanding of the
interrelation of carbon and N metabolism.

Interestingly, it was recently shown that potato tubers are autotrophic for N under
conditions where high nitrate levels are supplied (Mäck and Schjoerring, 2002; Lin et al.,
2004). The tubers can take up nitrate through the skin and have the full capacity to reduce
nitrate and assimilate ammonia for the biosynthesis of all amino acids and do not rely on
the import of amino acids from the phloem sap.

15.2.2.2 Ammonia assimilation and recycling

The ammonia derived from direct uptake or through reduction of nitrate needs to be
incorporated into organic compounds for further metabolism. The primary pathway of
ammonia assimilation in higher plants occurs through the GS-GOGAT cycle that operates
in leaves. Only minor portions of ammonia are assimilated through glutamate dehydro-
genase (GDH). The reactions are the following:

GS-GOGAT

+ glutamate+ ATP—> glutamine+ ADP+ Pi

NH3
glutamine+ 2-oxoglutarate+ NADPH+ H
GDH

+

(cid:3)ferredoxin(cid:4)—> glutamate+ NADP

+

+ 2-oxoglutarate+ NADPH+ H

+

<—> glutamate+ NADP

+

NH3

In the GS-GOGAT pathway, glutamate acts as the acceptor for ammonia and glutamine
is formed by GS. Glutamate synthase has a very high affinity to ammonia and is therefore
able to incorporate ammonia into organic molecules also if it is present in very low
concentrations. In a reductive transamination, one amino group from glutamine is then
transferred to 2-oxoglutarate to form glutamate by the enzyme GOGAT. This process
is more energy consuming than the reaction catalyzed by GDH, where ammonia is

Mineral nutrition of the potato

317

incorporated into 2-oxoglutarate, as an extra molecule of ATP is needed. However, the
GS-GOGAT cycle is the major pathway in leaves, where energy balances do not play a
major role in efficiently coordinating metabolic pathways. The high affinity of GS towards
ammonia prevents the accumulation of ammonia to toxic concentrations, which could
lead to an uncoupling of oxidative photophosphorylation and hence to the production of
reactive oxygen species.

Higher plant GS is an octameric enzyme, as in yeast, but is apparently not regulated by
dissociation/association (Stewart et al., 1980). The subunit size is approximately 40 kDa
for all isoenzymes. Different isoenzymes can be resolved by isoelectric focusing and/or
ion exchange chromatography. In leaves there are two forms of GS, a cytosolic form
(GS1) and a chloroplastic form (GS2). Glutamate synthase 2 contains two additional
cysteine residues per subunit – this may account for the higher susceptibility of this
isoenzyme to sulfhydryl reagents (Stewart et al., 1980). Sequences of the chloroplastic
GS genes indicate that they contain cysteines in the putative ATP and substrate binding
sites, whereas in the cytosolic forms these positions are occupied by alanine residues
(Baima et al., 1989).

Glutamate synthase from higher plant sources is subject to cumulative feedback inhi-
bition by amino acids and nucleotides (e.g. ADP and AMP are inhibitory) (Stewart and
Rhodes, 1977).

In potato, there is one gene encoding plastidic GS2 and two encoding cytosolic GS1
(Stgs1a and Stgs1b) that are differentially expressed at the cellular and organ level
(Teixeira et al., 2005). Potato GS-encoding genes seem to be regulated at the transcrip-
tional or mRNA stability level. Glutamate synthase 2 is expressed in leaves and decreases
when the leaves are senescing, which is also true for Stgs1a. Glutamate synthase 1 tran-
scripts and proteins are the only forms of GS present in non-photosynthetic tissues and
senescing leaves (Stgs1b). Both of the GS1 proteins are also found in vascular tissues.
Stgs1a is expressed only in the phloem companion cells, whereas Stgs1b is expressed
in both phloem and xylem. These expression patterns indicate that GS2 is probably
involved in ammonia assimilation in leaves, whereas GS1 fulfills this function in non-
photosynthetic tissues and probably is mainly involved in the mobilization of N from
leaves to other tissues.

Mutants of barley have been obtained which are deficient in GS2, the chloroplastic form
of GS. In barley, GS1 is capable of maintaining normal growth under non-photorespiratory
conditions. Mutants of barley lacking GS2 accumulate high levels of ammonia in the
leaves when placed in air (Lea et al., 1989). Similar studies have not been undertaken
with potato, but they could be simulated with compounds that are inhibitors of GS,
e.g. methionine sulfoximine or phosphinothricin.

No genes encoding GOGAT have been described for potato. Two ESTs, which probably
represent the identical allele, were found encoding NADH-GOGAT and one encoding
Fd-GOGAT in tomato, but no further analysis has been performed so far. It seems likely
also that Solanaceous species have similar genes for GOGAT as Arabidopsis, where two
genes for Fd-GOGAT and one for NADH-GOGAT are present (Lam et al., 1995). Mutants
of Arabidopsis defective in GOGAT exhibit markedly impaired ammonia assimilation,
especially under photorespiratory conditions (Lea et al., 1992).

318

Bucher and Kossmann

Again, no genes encoding GDH have been described for potato. One EST has been
described from tomato. However, again it is probable that the situation for the genetic
structure of the GDH-encoding genes in potato resemble the situation in Arabidopsis. Two
distinct genes (designated GDH1 and GDH2) encoding NADH-GDH have been identified
in Arabidopsis. Both gene products contain putative mitochondrial transit polypeptides and
NADH- and 2-oxoglutarate-binding domains. Subcellular fractionation confirms the mito-
chondrial location of the NADH-GDH isoenzymes. Glutamate dehydrogenase 1 encodes
a 43.0-kDa polypeptide, designated alpha, and GDH2 encodes a 42.5-kDa polypeptide,
designated beta. The two subunits combine in different ratios to form seven NADH-GDH
isoenzymes (Turano et al., 1997). In wildtype Arabidopsis, GDH1 mRNA accumulates
to high levels in dark-adapted or sucrose-starved plants; light or sucrose treatment each
repress GDH1 mRNA accumulation. These results suggest that the GDH1 gene prod-
uct functions in the direction of glutamate catabolism under carbon-limiting conditions.
Low levels of GDH1 mRNA present in leaves of light-grown plants can be induced by
exogenously supplied ammonia. Under such conditions of carbon and ammonia excess,
GDH1 may function in the direction of glutamate biosynthesis. The recessive Arabidopsis
GDH-deficient gdh1-1 mutant displays only a conditional phenotype. Seedling growth
is specifically retarded on media containing exogenously supplied inorganic N, suggest-
ing that GDH1 plays a non-redundant role in ammonia assimilation under conditions of
inorganic N excess (Melo-Oliveira et al., 1996). As in Arabidopsis, GDH in potato is
localized to the mitochondria and seemingly fulfils similar functions in providing carbon
skeletons under carbon-limiting conditions (Aubert et al., 2001).

15.2.3 Transport of organic N between source and sink

As N is usually limiting plant growth, it is a stringent necessity that, after assimilation,
N is made available to the organs that are developing or that are deficient for N and
therefore not able to fulfil their physiological function. Amino acids seem to represent
the principal long-distance transport form for organic N in higher plants. Proteogenic
amino acids accumulate to concentrations of 100–200 mM in the phloem sap and to
approximately 10-fold less concentrations in the xylem, where amines and acidic amino
acids predominate. Organic N transport in plants is highly complex, because the transport
substrates are extremely diverse, encompassing the 20 proteogenic amino acids, their ana-
logues GABA and oligopeptides, amines, as well as many uncharacterized N-containing
compounds that are found in the phloem sap. Physiological studies using whole tissues,
individual cells or plasma membrane vesicles indicated that amino acid transport is medi-
ated by carriers with overlapping specificity, coupling electrochemical potential to active
accumulation of amino acids (Lalonde et al., 2004).

As N metabolism is compartmentalized in cells, many transporter genes are needed.
cDNAs encoding amino acid transporters for cellular import were originally isolated
through functional expression in yeast uptake mutants (Frommer et al., 1993; Kwart
et al., 1993). Excluding mitochondrial transporters, the Arabidopsis and rice genomes
each encode more than 50 putative amino acid transporters as based on sequence sim-
ilarity. For most of these genes, a precise function still needs to be established. By
sequence similarities, they are grouped into at least four superfamilies: (a) the amino

Mineral nutrition of the potato

319

acid-polyamine-choline transporter superfamily (APC), (b) the amino acid transporter
superfamily 1 (ATF1), (c) the amino acid transporters belonging to the major facilitator
superfamily (MFS) and (d) members of the mitochondrial carrier (MC) family (Lalonde
et al., 2004).

The only organic N transporter from potato that has been characterized on the molecu-
lar level, StAAP1, falls into the superfamily ATF1. Amino acid transporter superfamily 1
members contain 9–11 putative membrane-spanning domains with cytosolic N and extra-
cellular C termini (Chang and Bush, 1997). The members of the best-studied amino acid
-independent,
permeases are preferentially expressed in vascular tissues and mediate Na
proton-coupled uptake of a wide spectrum of amino acids (Fischer et al., 2002). The
role for StAAP1 in mediating amino acid transport between organs is supported by the
fact that potato tubers from plants with reduced expression of the transporter accumulate
lowered levels of all free amino acids except aspartate (Koch et al., 2003). The reverse
experiment, to overexpress this type of transporter to enhance amino acid levels in potato
tubers, has so far not been undertaken. However, it seems more likely to achieve the
enhancement of the amino acid composition of potato tubers by engineering specifically

15.3 PHOSPHORUS

Phosphorus (P) is an essential macro-nutrient for growth and development in all living
organisms. It serves various basic biological functions as a structural element, in energy
metabolism, in the activation of metabolic intermediates, in signal transduction and in the
regulation of enzymes. The prevalent form of available P in the soil is the oxidized anion
phosphate. Although the total amount of P in the soil may be high, the preferred form
for assimilation, orthophosphate (Pi), is often not readily available, because of several
reasons. Pi can be adsorbed to soil particles and clay minerals and surfaces of calcium
(Ca) and magnesium (Mg) carbonates, or it is converted to organically bound forms or
insoluble precipitates with common cations like iron (Fe), aluminium (Al) and Ca (Welp
et al., 1983; Holford, 1997). More soluble minerals such as N move through the soil
through bulk flow and diffusion, whereas Pi is moved mainly by diffusion in the soil
solution. As the rate of diffusion of Pi in soils is slow, high plant Pi uptake rates create
a Pi depletion zone around the root (Jungk, 1991; Marschner, 1995). Therefore, the low
availability of Pi in the bulk soil affects its uptake into roots.

Furthermore, the way in which Pi is metabolized in storage organs is a key determinant
for the accumulation of storage carbohydrates and the quality of the harvested organ.
Therefore, Pi efficiency is of crucial importance for the growth and development of plants
and a key component of the genetic yield potential of crops.

Pi efficiency can be divided into two different parameters, the Pi acquisition (PAE) and
the Pi utilization efficiency (PUE). The PAE is characterized by the unit of P absorbed
per unit of root length and relates to the different mechanisms by which plants are able to
release Pi from insoluble fractions and to incorporate soluble forms available in the soil
solution. The PAE is of major importance for plants growing on soils containing only

320

Bucher and Kossmann

low levels of Pi, which is the case for most of the soils under agricultural exploitation.
But even in soils which are rich in Pi, e.g. in central Europe, Pi is not always available
in sufficient amounts in the soil solution, due to the fact that most of it is present in an
immobile form. The PUE, i.e. the unit of P per unit of dry matter, relates to the distribution
of Pi to different organs, cells and subcellular compartments as well as the metabolism
of Pi into different intermediate pools. The PUE must be optimal at the organismic,
cellular and subcellular level for crop yield to be maximized. A plant that is supplied with
sufficient Pi may still suffer from what is known as Pi limitation of photosynthesis, due
to the fact that most of the Pi present in photosynthetically active cells is sequestered in
the vacuole and not metabolically available during short-term limitations (Mimura, 1995,
1999). Besides allocation within the plant, another key process involved in PUE is the
deficiency-induced remobilization of Pi from older leaves, critical for plants to overcome
periods of malnutrition. A large variability of PAE and PUE has been observed between
plant species and within varieties of the same species indicating that P efficiency is under
genetic control (Sattelmacher et al., 1994; Marschner, 1995; Horst et al., 1996; Fageria
and Baligar, 1997). In contrast to the crucial importance of Pi for plant growth and
development, little is known about the underlying mechanisms determining Pi efficiency.
However, improving the PUE of plants by breeding or genetic engineering strategies
would require not only an appropriate knowledge on genes coding for P transport within
the plant but also on genes controlling photosynthate allocation, growth, senescence, etc.
This makes the PUE far more complicated and difficult to fully understand as opposed
to the PAE of which key genes have meanwhile been identified. This chapter’s focus is
on a basic process involved in both PAE and PUE, i.e. the molecular and biochemical
processes involved in Pi transport across membranes.

15.3.1 Phosphate uptake

Plants have developed numerous morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecu-
lar responses to cope with Pi limiting conditions, including changes in root morphology
and architecture, accumulation of anthocyanins, secretion of phosphomonoesterases
and organic acids into the rhizosphere, improved Pi uptake efficiency and changes
in metabolism (Raghothama, 1999). The consequence of these adaptive changes is
increased Pi availability in the rhizosphere, enhanced Pi uptake and maintenance of plant
metabolism. To optimally exploit the soil Pi, plants respond to low P conditions with an
increased root–shoot ratio and an enlargement of the absorptive surface area relative to
the root volume (Marschner, 1995). The increase in root surface area can be attributed in
part to the enhanced production of root hairs, their length being especially important for
Pi uptake (Bates and Lynch, 1996; Jungk, 2001). Alternatively, arbuscular mycorrhizal
(AM) associations between symbiotic soil fungi from the phylum Glomeromycota and
plant roots have to be taken into consideration. In these associations, which are also
established in potato plants (Bhattarai and Mishra, 1984; McArthur and Knowles, 1993),
the absorbing surface area of the colonized roots is extended due to the large extraradical
fungal mycelium exploiting soil volumes which are otherwise not accessible to the root
(Smith and Read, 1997). Subsequently, available Pi is rapidly absorbed by an efficient
uptake and transport system.

Mineral nutrition of the potato

321

Among other mineral nutrients, plants are able to selectively and actively accumulate Pi
in their cells. The transport of Pi across cellular and intracellular membranes is mediated
by membrane-spanning transporter proteins with specific binding sites. Pi allocation on
the cellular, tissue and organ level occurs through short- and long-distance transport
including several membrane transport steps.

15.3.2 Molecular biological analysis of Pi transport systems

15.3.2.1 The Pht1 family of plant Pi transporters
Molecular biological studies in the past decade eventually made it possible to identify and
investigate, similar to N-transport systems, membrane proteins exhibiting typical features
of transport systems involved in Pi uptake from the soil solution.

The isolation of the first cDNA clones and genes encoding Pi transporters (PiTs) from
vascular plants was based on sequence information of an Arabidopsis thaliana expressed
sequence tag clone (Muchhal et al., 1996; Leggewie et al., 1997; Mitsukawa et al., 1997;
Smith et al., 1997; Daram et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1998b), which became available in
1995 from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Remy et al., 1994) and exhibited
homology to the yeast high-affinity PiT PHO84 (Bun-Ya et al., 1991). The Pht1 family
presently consists of >80 proteins from both monocot and dicot species including A.
thaliana, Solanum tuberosum, Lycopersicon esculentum, Nicotiana tabacum, Medicago
truncatula, Oryza sativa, Hordeum vulgare (Karandashov and Bucher, 2005) and sev-
eral others. Plant Pht1 transporters are integral membrane proteins predicted to contain
12 membrane-spanning domains separated into two groups of six by a large charged
symporter
hydrophilic region (Muchhal et al., 1996). They belong to the phosphate: H
(PHS) family within the MFS. The MFS consists of at least 29 distinct families present
in bacteria, archaea and eukarya, each of which generally transports a single class of
compounds (Saier et al., 1999). The three-dimensional structures of three MFS members,
i.e. the oxalate (OxlT), lactose (LacY) and glycerol-3-phosphate/inorganic phosphate
(GlpT) transporters from Oxalobacter formigens and Escherichia coli, respectively, have
been elucidated; these demonstrate the presence of 12 transmembrane domains, substan-
tiating the structural model of MFS proteins (Hirai et al., 2002; Abramson et al., 2003;
Huang et al., 2003). Although it can be assumed that Pht1 proteins are structurally simi-
lar to these three well-characterized MFS proteins, experimental evidence clarifying the
structure of Pht1 proteins is still lacking. Multiple alignments of Pht1 and homologous
non-plant transporters have revealed the presence of several highly conserved sites for
post-translational modification, as well as a highly conserved region, the Pht1 signa-
ture GGDYPLSATIxSE, in the fourth putative transmembrane domain (Karandashov and
Bucher, 2005). Elucidating the function of these sequences is a future challenge. Func-
tional complementation of different yeast mutants and overexpression of Pht1 proteins
in plant cells have demonstrated great variability in affinity for Pi ranging from 3 to
∼700 (cid:5)M. This also supports the presence of both high- and low-affinity PiTs within the
Pht1 family in plants (Leggewie et al., 1997; Harrison et al., 2002; Rausch and Bucher,
2002; Rae et al., 2003; Nagy et al., 2005).

+

Expression analysis and the proposed function of Pht1 genes in different plant species
have been published. Overall, the expression patterns of the respective genes in different

322

Bucher and Kossmann

organs suggest involvement of Pht1 proteins in Pi uptake at the root periphery from
the soil solution and subsequent allocation to sink tissues in the plant (Schachtman
et al., 1998; Raghothama, 1999, 2000; Smith et al., 2000; Bucher et al., 2001; Poirier
and Bucher, 2002; Rausch and Bucher, 2002; Karandashov and Bucher, 2005). Clear
evidence for a role of Pht1 genes in Pi uptake was provided by detailed analysis of
loss-of-function mutations in the model plant A. thaliana where mutations in Pht1;1 and
Pht1;4 alone or in combination resulted in strongly reduced Pi uptake rates at both low
and high P conditions (Misson et al., 2004; Shin et al., 2004). While the genomes of
A. thaliana and rice contain 9 and 13 Pht1 genes, respectively (Mudge et al., 2002;
Paszkowski et al., 2002), five members of the Pht1 family have been identified so far in
potato and tomato (Leggewie et al., 1997; Daram et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1998a; Nagy
et al., 2005). The respective orthologous pairs of PiTs LePT1 and StPT1, and LePT2 and
StPT2, are predominantly expressed in the rhizodermis including root hairs, the former
rather constitutively, the latter inducible by Pi deprivation. While mRNA of the respective
orthologous pairs of PiTs LePT1 and StPT1 was detectable in both root and shoot tissues
(and transcript levels increased slightly in both tissues upon Pi starvation), LePT2 and
StPT2 mRNA was exclusively detectable in roots, and its concentration was strongly
enhanced during Pi deprivation (Daram et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1998a; Gordon-Weeks
et al., 2003; Zimmermann et al., 2003). After resupply of Pi in the medium, transcript
abundance decreased again to control levels (Liu et al., 1998a; Zimmermann et al., 2003).
Using anti-LePT1 antibodies, Muchhal and Raghothama (1999) demonstrated that the
fluctuations in LePT1 transcripts under changing Pi supply to the plant were concurrent
with the levels of the transporter protein. These data strongly suggest a predominantly
transcriptional regulation of PAE, although post-translational modification of Pi transport
activity cannot be excluded. In situ hybridization studies localized the LePT1 transcript
to rhizodermal cells including root hairs and root cap cells (Daram et al., 1998), and
mRNA signals were also detected in leaf palisade parenchyma cells (Liu et al., 1998a).
LePT1 transcripts and protein accumulated along the entire root, and the respective
protein was detected primarily in the plasma membrane (Daram et al., 1998; Muchhal
and Raghothama, 1999). LePT2 transcripts were primarily observed in root epidermal
cells under Pi-limiting conditions (Liu et al., 1998a). Similarly, strong accumulation of
StPT2 mRNA was shown to occur in root hairs of Pi-deprived potato roots (Zimmermann
et al., 2003). Moreover, StPT2 protein localization in root transverse sections showed that
StPT2 labelling is confined to the apical plasma membrane of epidermal cells indicating
cellular polarity of Pi transport (Gordon-Weeks et al., 2003). Thus, similar to the situation
in Arabidopsis, the expression pattern and localization of the two PiTs from tomato and
potato support a primary role of these Pht1 transporters in PAE at the root–soil interface.
Enhanced PiT gene expression under Pi-limiting conditions leads to an increased number
of transport sites and thus most likely to an increase in Vmax of Pi uptake per root area,
which is in agreement with data obtained in physiological experiments.

15.3.2.2 Pi transport in mycorrhizas
A widespread form of adaptation to low P soil conditions is the formation of symbiotic
associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Eighty per cent of vascular plants undergo interac-
tions with AM fungi (Smith and Read, 1997). These are often mutualistic interactions,

Mineral nutrition of the potato

323

in which the plant acquires Pi and other nutrients from the fungus in exchange for pho-
tosynthetic carbohydrates. This symbiosis is especially effective for plant growth during
Pi-limited conditions and is thought to have facilitated the colonization of terrestrial
ecosystems by plants about 400 million years ago (Remy et al., 1994). In the years
1996–2006, the use of molecular physiological and genetic tools has greately promoted
our understanding of the molecular and biochemical processes involved in PAE at the
symbiotic root–fungus interface (Rausch et al., 2001; Harrison, 2005; Oldroyd et al.,
2005). While root hairs represent important cellular structures involved in the ‘direct Pi
uptake pathway’, the ‘mycorrhizal Pi uptake pathway’ expands from extraradical fungal
hyphae to the root cortex cells of a mycorrhiza harbouring fungal structures, i.e. arbus-
cules and hyphal coils. It was demonstrated that the mycorrhizal Pi uptake pathway can
dominate Pi supply to plants irrespective of whether colonized plants exhibited improved
growth and/or total P uptake (Smith et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2004). Detailed expression
studies performed with mycorrhized plants of different species allowed the identification
of several AM fungus-inducible plant PiT genes from the Pht1 family in potato (Rausch
et al., 2001; Nagy et al., 2005), tomato (Nagy et al., 2005), M. truncatula (Harrison
et al., 2002) and the cereals such as rice (Paszkowski et al., 2002), maize, wheat and
barley (Glassop et al., 2005; Nagy et al., 2006). The cloning and characterization of
the PiT StPT3 from potato provided the first molecular and biochemical evidence for
plant Pi uptake at the AM fungus–root interface in mycorrhizas (Rausch et al., 2001).
Sequence analysis revealed the close relationship between the StPT3 protein and other
members of the plant Pht1 family and high-affinity PiTs of fungal origin. Biochemical
evidence for the function of StPT3 was obtained by complementation of a yeast mutant
defective in the two high-affinity PiT genes PHO84 and PHO89. Pi uptake mediated
by StPT3 in the mutant yeast cells followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics, exhibiting an
apparent Km value of 64 (cid:5)M (Rausch et al., 2001). In accordance with previous work
(Daram et al., 1998), it was concluded that StPT3 functions as a high-affinity PiT at
the plasma membrane. StPT3 expression was shown to be locally induced upon col-
onization by the AM fungus Glomus intraradices, and mRNA levels correlated with
arbuscule formation in the roots. Additionally, in situ hybridization studies resulted in
StPT3 mRNA labelling in arbuscule-containing cells, which is consistent with the pre-
sumed function of StPT3 as a mycorrhiza-inducible PiT localized at the peri-arbuscular
membrane. Subsequently, a second AM fungus-inducible PiT, StPT4, has been described
from potato (Karandashov et al., 2004). Orthologues of StPT4 were also found in other
species, thus indicating the presence of two non-orthologous mycorrhiza-responsive Pi
transport systems (Karandashov and Bucher, 2005). The cloned promoter regions from
StPT4 and its tomato orthologue LePT4 exhibited a high degree of sequence identity
and were shown to direct expression exclusively in colonized cells when fused to the
GUS reporter gene, in accordance with the abundance of LePT4 and StPT4 transcripts in
mycorrhized roots (Nagy et al., 2005). Furthermore, extensive sequencing of StPT4-like
clones and subsequent expression analysis in both potato and tomato revealed the pres-
ence of a close paralogue to StPT4 and LePT4, named StPT5 and LePT5, representing a
third Pi transport system in Solanaceous species which is upregulated upon AM fungal
colonization of roots. The existence of the latter two genes can be explained by genome
duplication. Knock-out of LePT4 in the tomato variety MicroTom indicated considerable

324

Bucher and Kossmann

redundancy between LePT4 and presumably LePT5 and/or LePT3 (Nagy et al., 2005).
Similar to StPT4/LePT4, the M. truncatula PiT MtPT4 is expressed only in mycorrhizal
roots, and the MtPT4 gene promoter directs expression exclusively in cells containing
arbuscules. MtPT4 protein is located in the membrane fraction of mycorrhizal roots, and
immunolocalization revealed that MtPT4 colocalizes with the arbuscules, consistent with
a location on the peri-arbuscular membrane. The transport properties and spatial expres-
sion patterns of MtPT4 are consistent with a role in the acquisition of Pi released by
the fungus in the AM symbiosis (Harrison et al., 2002). Recently, experimental evidence
was provided for a mycorrhizal Pi transport function of the Lotus japonicus PiT LjPT3
(Maeda et al., 2006) that is orthologous to StPT3 from potato (Rausch et al., 2001). At
a meeting on mycorrhizas in March 2006 on the Monte Verità (Ticino, Switzerland),
it was reported that loss-of-function mutations in MtPT4 resulted in reduced shoot Pi
content and premature degeneration of fungal structures in the mycorrhiza (Brachmann,
2006; Harrison et al., personal communication), a phenotype which was also described
in the work on LjPT3 published by Maeda et al. (2006). This is strong evidence for an
important role of mycorrhizal Pht1 PiTs in the regulation of mycorrhiza development and
functioning.

15.3.3 Pi translocation on the whole plant level: long-distance transport

After uptake of Pi in the root symplasm through rhizodermal cells, including root hairs
(Drew et al., 1984; Sentenac and Grignon, 1985; Ullrich and Novacky, 1990), Pi is
transported symplasmically to the xylem parenchyma cells and subsequently secreted into
the xylem (apoplast) for long-distance translocation to the above-ground organs (Jeschke
et al., 1997). Xylem transport is driven by the gradient in hydrostatic pressure and by the
gradient in the water potential. The gradient in water potential between roots and shoots
is particularly steep during the day when the stomata are open, and solute flow in the
xylem is therefore unidirectional (Marschner, 1995). Several studies provide a picture of
Pi distribution patterns on the whole plant level (Koontz and Biddulph, 1957; Biddulph
et al., 1958; Jeschke et al., 1997). Pi is described as a phloem mobile element (Marschner,
1995) and it was suggested that Pi is the primary form in which P moves in the phloem
(Bieleski, 1969; Jeschke et al., 1997). In Pi-sufficient plants, most of the Pi absorbed by
the root is transported in the xylem to the young leaves. Pi mobilization, net export and
retranslocation from older leaves to the root through the phloem were calculated to greatly
exceed the requirements of the root under high Pi supply; thus, massive transfer of Pi
from phloem to xylem for Pi transport back to the shoot was expected to occur in the root
(Jeschke et al., 1997). In potato, sink–source relationships for P on the whole plant level
have been demonstrated by feeding radioactive Pi to young and old leaves, respectively
(Rausch et al., 2004). While the nutrient was retained in young sink leaves, it was rapidly
distributed from old leaves to actively growing tissue indicating strong source capacity
of old potato leaves. The question arises whether expression patterns of Pht1 genes in
potato suggest involvement of the encoded proteins in P-related source–sink interactions
in planta. In fact, the data do not support this hypothesis. During high P conditions in
fertilized soils, StPT1 transcripts were more abundant in old leaves as compared with

Mineral nutrition of the potato

325

young leaves (Leggewie et al., 1997; Rausch et al., 2004). This can be explained by low
P levels in old leaves triggering a local response to P deprivation.

Three Arabidopsis mutants impaired in Pi translocation within the shoot have been
identified, i.e. pho1, pho2 and pht2;1-1. The pho1 mutant exhibited a defective mech-
anism of xylem loading with Pi. As a consequence, total Pi concentrations in the
leaf tissue were strongly reduced, and root Pi uptake rates were similar to wildtype
plants, whereas translocation rates to the shoot were reduced (Poirier et al., 1991). The
PHO1 gene was identified and characterized (Hamburger et al., 2002) and was shown
to be a membrane protein involved either directly or indirectly in Pi transport across
membranes.

Contrasting the phenotype of pho1, the pho2 mutation affects a function normally
involved in regulating the concentration of Pi in shoots of Arabidopsis. Compared to
wildtype, pho2 mutants had greater Pi concentrations in stems, siliques and seeds, but
roots of pho2 mutants had similar or lower Pi concentrations than either pho1 mutants
or wildtype seedlings (Delhaize and Randall, 1995). Later, it was shown that a mutation
in the target gene of a micro-RNA (miR399) is responsible for the Pi overaccumulator
phenotype in the pho2 mutant (Aung et al., 2006; Bari et al., 2006). The miR399 target
gene encodes a putative ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBC) which was also shown to
be involved in the regulation of Pht1;1 gene expression by Pi availability (Fujii et al.,
2005). Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes play an important role in the protein degradation
pathway. Overexpression of miR399 in A. thaliana resulted in downregulation of UBC
and exagerated accumulation of Pi in the shoot (Chiou et al., 2006).

The pht2;1-1 mutant is impaired in the expression of the Pht2;1 PiT. Pht2;1 was
the first member of the Pht2 family of plant PiTs to be identified (Quigley et al.,
1996; Daram et al., 1999). The protein belongs to the inorganic PiT family of the
MSF (Section 15.3.2.1). Functional analysis of the Pht2;1 protein in mutant yeast cells
/Pi symport activity dependent on the electrochemical proton and potassium
suggested H
gradient across the yeast plasma membrane (Daram et al., 1999). Three orthologues
from other plant species have been published, Pht2;1 from potato (Rausch et al., 2004),
MtPHT2;1 from M. truncatula (Versaw and Harrison, 2002) and Phtc from spinach
(Spinacia oleracea) (Ferro et al., 2002). Evidence was presented for developmental and
light-dependent control of the Pht2;1 gene and for localization of Pht2;1 protein to both
photoautotrophic and heterotrophic plastids in Arabidopsis and potato and, moreover, to
the inner membrane of spinach chloroplasts (Ferro et al., 2002; Versaw and Harrison,
2002; Rausch et al., 2004). Thus, molecular evidence for light-regulated unidirectional
Pi transport in plastids mediated by Pht2;1 exists. Moreover, functional complementation
studies in yeast indicated low-affinity Pi transport through Pht2;1 (Daram et al., 1999;
Versaw and Harrison, 2002).

+

Steady-state transcript levels of Pht2;1 slightly increased during growth at high Pi
concentrations (Versaw and Harrison, 2002; Zhao et al., 2003; Rausch et al., 2004).
In potato, Pht2;1 expression levels were highest in young sink leaves correlating positively
with sink strength in Pi allocation to growing tissues and inversely with expression levels
of StPT1 being highest in old Pi source leaves exhibiting reduced P content (Rausch
et al., 2004). The T-DNA insertional Pht2;1 loss-of-function mutant pht2;1-1 exhibited
an interesting phenotype with respect to interorgan Pi homeostasis (Versaw and Harrison,

326

Bucher and Kossmann

2002). Pht2;1-1 displayed reduced growth compared with the wild type, and the leaf Pi
content was reduced by >20% at high external P conditions. At low Pi conditions, the
root Pi content of pht2;1-1 was strongly reduced as compared to control plants, whereas
the shoot Pi level was markedly increased. Moreover, in contrast to the wild type, a
redistribution of Pi from older to younger leaves under conditions of low external Pi was
not observed. This finding indicated an important role of Pht2;1 in the allocation and
partitioning of Pi at the whole plant level.

Overall, Pht2;1 expression analysis suggested multifactorial regulation, and the
physiological context in which Pht2;1 could play a role was difficult to imagine. With the
Arabidopsis genome sequenced, high-throughput gene expression analysis has become a
frequent and powerful research tool in plant biology. Using Genevestigator, a database
and Web-browser data mining interface for Affymetrix GeneChip data (Zimmermann
et al., 2004), the gene expression profiles of more than 22 000 Arabidopsis genes can
be obtained. Meta-analysis of 228 microarrays from a large number of genome profiling
studies covering 83 different experimental conditions in Arabidopsis allowed one to ask
‘which genes are regulated in a similar manner to Pht2;1 and could therefore be involved
in the same physiological process?’. The analysis suggested a role of Pht2;1-mediated
Pi transport in maintaining Pi homeostasis in plastids during periods of high demand for
intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism (Rausch et al., 2004).

15.4 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

The identification and molecular characterization of numerous genes encoding proteins for
N and Pi transport and metabolism have largely furthered our understanding of resource
utilization and allocation in plants and also in potato plants. A range of different transgenic
potato plants that all are impaired in various critical steps in nutrient acquisition, allocation,
intracellular transport or assimilation have been generated and analysed. Even more
knowledge has been obtained from the work with functional genomics model species,
which represents a rich resource for technologies that also could be applied to potatoes.
More mutants will eventually be identified, and the study of interactions of individual
genes will even contribute more to our understanding of mechanisms contributing to
the nutrient efficiency of plants. The main challenge that remains is to elucidate the
mechanisms that establish Pi homeostasis under variable P conditions, as no tonoplast PiT
protein has been identified until now. In the future, modifying the biochemical parameters
of N and Pi transport systems and metabolizing enzymes may lead to enhanced N and PAE
and utilization efficiency or changed Pi concentrations within cellular compartments, thus
affecting for example plant development, photosynthetic capacity and starch synthesis
or responses to stress (Marschner, 1995; Hurry et al., 2000). The ultimate goal will be
to generate crops with high yield in low N and P soils to allow low input of N and P
fertilizers. A more complete understanding of N and Pi uptake and utilization in plants
will thus eventually have significant implications with respect to both the environment
and world agriculture.

16.1 INTRODUCTION

Globally, the demand for fresh water increases due to increased population pressure and
altered food habits. Water is increasingly becoming a scarce resource. About 80 countries
with 40% of the world population suffer from serious water shortage. Worldwide 85%
of fresh water is used in agriculture. The efficiency of the use of available water, i.e. the
proportion of available water directed towards plant transpiration, is often less than
50% (Hamdy et al., 2003), but there is a large variety of different options to reduce
water losses and enhance water productivity, including micro-management such as drip
irrigation (Chawla and Narda, 2001), improved varieties, growing alternative crop species
and better timing of the crop cycle in the season.

Potato is a crop that uses water relatively efficiently. Its high harvest index of about
0.75, compared with approximately 0.5 for cereals, contributes to this property as does
its agro-ecological character, characterized by relatively low evaporative water demand.
Potato is best grown at places and in periods where average daily temperatures are above

translocation of dry matter to the tubers is much reduced. Plant-available water primarily
depends on amount and distribution of rainfall, water-holding capacity of the soil and
the rooting depth. Limiting dependable rainfall is supplemented by irrigation in many
potato-producing areas, but not all. Water shortage limits yield and also the associated
use efficiencies (or productivities) of other limiting resources, including land, nutrients,
fossil energy and labour; economic returns may also be reduced by poorer product quality.
The importance of ensuring sufficient availability of water is illustrated in Fig. 16.1,
comparing potential and water-limited potato yields in Africa.

Agricultural research can help mankind in several ways to cope judiciously with global
problems of producing sufficient food from limiting supplies of water. Firstly, research
generates insight into how the soil–plant–atmosphere system works. Such analyses gener-
ate ideas on the potential and the relative successes of options for improvement (e.g. soil
improvement, irrigation and plant breeding). Secondly, such research provides reference
standards for performance, including models of crop production in relation to environ-
ment, and helps to set realistic goals for improvement. While, lastly, research provides

itoring the water status, (iii) presents the crop responses to drought and (iv) addresses
environmental and genetic differences in water-use efficiency and product quality.

16.2 DETERMINANTS AND CONTROLS OF WATER MOVEMENT

16.2.1 The transport of water in the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum

Since the 1960s, the concepts have been well established describing the driving forces
and controls governing the transport of water in the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum
(SPAC). Plant transpiration can be described by analogy with Ohm’s law on the flux of
charge in an electrical circuit. According to this concept, the rate of flow of water through
the entire SPAC is directly proportional to the total difference in pressure head between
the soil–root interface and the leaf–atmosphere interface and is inversely proportional to
the total water transport resistance of the system under steady-state conditions. Ignoring
the very small proportion of water taken up by the plant that is stored, the general equation
describing this relation can be repeated to describe the fluxes in the several parts of the
SPAC [Eq. (16.1); Fig. 16.2]. The rules for summarizing an electrical system of resistors
in parallel or in series can be applied to these transport resistances.

it is preferable to use conductance (the reciprocal of resistance, with units of mm s
instead of resistance because the flux is directly proportional to the conductance. (The
choice may be determined by the balance between resistances in series and in parallel in
the system being studied.)

The common units of resistance to water flux are s cm

Hydraulic conductance is a common term to refer to the ‘ease’ of transport of water.
It is a limitation of Eq. (16.1) that steady-state conditions seldom exist in a plant.
Throughout the day, the water content of the plant changes and the resistances to water
flow are not constant either but may appear to depend on evaporative demand. It is difficult
to determine the hydraulic conductance of different parts of roots of an extensive root
system in a natural soil, although various techniques are available to measure hydraulic
conductance, pressure heads and water uptake at detailed levels (Sanderson, 1983; Steudle,
1993). Again, it is difficult to relate these measurements to overall hydraulic conductance

336

of the entire root system at a particular time or to translate laboratory findings to root
systems grown under natural conditions (Steudle, 2000).

The soil water potential at the soil–root interface is not the same throughout the rooted
soil volume. There are vertical gradients in average soil moisture potentials and gradients
from the more remote points in the bulk soil to those nearest the root surface. The
transport of water from the bulk soil to the root surface is also governed by the difference
in pressure head and soil hydraulic conductance. The latter can be quantified as functions
of soil water potential (cid:4)(cid:7) (cid:5) or soil water content, the form of these relations being strongly
influenced by soil texture (Van Genuchten, 1980). Spatial heterogeneity of soil water and
roots and the difficulty of measuring each of the resistances from root surface to stomatal
cavity make it impractical to solve Eq. (16.1) to obtain the transpiration rate. Yet, the
concept is sound and still very useful as a basis to guide thinking about the collection of
water from the soil and water flow in the SPAC.

16.2.2 Plant water relations

Soil holds water against gravity. Plant tissue also binds water: if one cuts a potato shoot
at the soil surface, water does not drip from the open ends of the xylem vessels. The
water potential, (cid:7) , is a measure of the ‘strength’ with which the tissue holds the water.
Basically, water potential is expressed in energy per unit water, but in practice, it is more
convenient to use pressure units or equivalent lengths of columns of mercury or water. As
the water potential of free water is 0 MPa, water in plants has negative water potential:
one has to exert pressure to make the water exude from the cut end of a shoot. This is
precisely what is done in a pressure chamber to measure the water potential (Scholander
et al., 1965). A plant organ is fixed in the chamber with the cut end protruding through
a hole in the lid into the open air. The chamber is pressurized, and the pressure required
to make water appear at the cut surface, i.e. the pressure needed to compensate for the
‘water binding force’ of the tissue, is taken as a measure of the water potential. The
water potential is the resultant of component potentials, the most of important of which
are two opposing ones, namely the turgor, P (positive values), and the osmotic potential,
(cid:8) (negative values). In soil, the water retention curve describes the relation between soil
water content and soil water potential. Plant water relations serve the same purpose for
plant tissue. By definition, water relations are those between the relative water content
(RWC), water potential (cid:4)(cid:7)(cid:5), osmotic potential (cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:5) and turgor (cid:4)P(cid:5). Relative water content
expresses the water content of a plant or an organ as a proportion of the water content
that it could have if in equilibrium with free water at 0 MPa. At RWC = 1, the plant is
maximally saturated with water, seen, for instance, pre-dawn in well-watered plants.

A representative, quantitative example of the relations between these variables is
depicted in Fig. 16.3. Such associations have been explored from the working hypoth-
esis that genetic differences in slopes and intercepts would be associated with drought
tolerance, but such differences were not found.

Osmotic adjustment, i.e. active lowering of the osmotic potential because of the accu-
mulation of solutes, seems to be absent in potato (Vos and Groenwold, 1988), whereas it
is still expected that genetic variation in this property can be exploited to improve drought
resistance in wheat (Skovmand et al., 2001). The osmotic potential at the point of full

functions of relative water content (fraction). When P > 0 MPa, the osmotic potential, (cid:8) = (cid:7) − P (MPa), i.e. the
negative value of the distance between the lines for P and (cid:7) . When RWC < 0(cid:9)912 (i.e. less than point of turgor
loss), (cid:8) ≈ (cid:7) . The slope (cid:10) is a measure of the elasticity of the cell walls. [Source: Vos and Oyarzún (1988).]

turgor was found to decline (be more negative) with leaf insertion number on the stem
(Vos and Groenwold, 1988), i.e. there is an osmotic gradient along the stem, spanning
the range from approximately −0(cid:9)6 to −1(cid:9)0 MPa. Such a gradient in the plant explains
why – even in full sunlight – the lower leaves on the plant and not the top leaves show
wilting symptoms first when water supply falls short of evaporative demand. At the verge
of turgor loss, which occurs at an RWC of approximately 0.91, the osmotic potential does
not fall below −0(cid:9)9 to −1(cid:9)0 MPa at the top of the plant. There are three implications of
these features.
(1) The permanent wilting point of potato crops is typically −0(cid:9)6 MPa in young crops,
falling to −1(cid:9)0 MPa in older crops, both of which are higher than the commonly
accepted value of −1(cid:9)6 MPa. These figures imply that potato has a weaker capacity
to dry out the soil than crops that wilt at −1(cid:9)6 MPa or lower. However, the practical
significance of this difference depends on the amount of water that is available to
the plants in soils with water potentials between −0(cid:9)6 and −1(cid:9)6 MPa that, in turn,
depends on soil texture and rooting depth.

(2) Relatively small imbalances between uptake of water and transpiration lead to loss of
−1 of fresh leaves with 15% dry matter, wilting is reached
turgor. For each 1000 kg ha
when there is a net loss of approximately 77 kg water. Expressed in millimetres of
water that loss is only 0.0077.

(3) The gradient in osmotic potential up the plant implies that drought resistance increases
somewhat with ontogeny and that late varieties (producing higher levels of apical
branches) acquire somewhat better drought resistance over time than early varieties
that produce relatively fewer branches and leaves.

Since the mid-1980s, it has become clear that responses to drought, including stomatal
reactions, are triggered by root signals rather than – or at least in addition to – leaf water

338

potential per se. Gollan et al. (1986) pressurized root systems of wheat and sunflower
and showed that drought reactions were not associated with leaf water status. Several
lines of evidence support the idea that abscisic acid (ABA) plays a central role in stress
signalling, inducing stomatal reactions (Wilkinson and Davies, 2002). Such reactions can
be brought about even if only part of the root system is in dry soil (Gowing et al., 1990).
Abscisic acid and root signalling has not been explored in potato. One could speculate on
possible triggering of drought responses due to potato hills that dry out while the subsoil
is still moist. However, in their extensive study on water uptake in potato in relation to
the distribution of roots and water in the soil, Stalham and Allen (2004) did not find
indications for such plant responses triggered in pockets of dry soil.

16.3 ASSESSING PLANT WATER STATUS

De Neve et al. (2000) reviewed several methods to assess water use and water status. Water
potential, (cid:7) , can be measured directly by pressure chamber or indirectly by the use of
psychrometers. Stem flow gauges are sensors that allow direct measurement of the water
used by plants as it moves up the stem; however, the potato stem has a strongly angled
cross-section that makes it difficult to effect and maintain a good thermal contact between
stem and sensor. Stomatal aperture is the dominant factor in the stomatal conductance
of leaf surfaces, which controls both the water loss from plant leaves and the uptake of
CO2 for photosynthesis. Measurements of stomatal conductance are therefore important
indicators of plant water status and provide valuable insight into plant growth and plant
adaptation to environmental variables. A porometer measures the stomatal conductance
or resistance. There are two general designs, equilibrium and dynamic, that differ in their
control philosophy. Both require a chamber to be clamped onto a leaflet. Water loss from
the enclosed leaf then tends to increase the humidity in the chamber. In the equilibrium
porometer, dry air is added at a measured rate to maintain a stable humidity close to the
ambient conditions. In the dynamic porometer, the chamber is purged with dry air, and
the transit time is measured while the leaf wets the air between two threshold values, dry
and wet, either side of ambient conditions. Porometer estimates of stomatal conductance
depend on the rate of transpiration, i.e. on radiation and humidity. Therefore, porometer
readings can only be interpreted in relation to measurements from well-watered control
plants.

The measurements just described are not useful for scheduling irrigation, but sensing
of leaf temperature may be. Where stomata are open, water evaporates from the leaf and
so cools it. The greater the evaporation rate, the greater the cooling of the leaf. Where
the supply of soil water is limited, less water is evaporated and there is less cooling of
the leaves, and the canopy temperature is higher than one would expect for a crop with
an adequate water supply. That is, the difference in leaf–air temperature is less than it
would be in an unstressed crop. Temperatures of air and canopy can be measured with
infrared thermometers that are commercially available. Using the humidity of the air
and the difference in leaf–air temperature, one can calculate a Crop Water Stress Index
(CWSI) that can be used to schedule irrigation (Idso et al., 1981; Ben-Asher et al., 1989;
McBurney, 2003). Critical values of the CWSI (i.e. values where yield reduction can be

Water availability and potato crop performance

339

expected) are derived from field measurements on crops growing under a range of water
stress. This technique is now reaching beyond development and is approaching the stage
where it can be used in commercial applications (Shae et al., 1999).

16.4 POTATO PLANT RESPONSES TO DROUGHT AND BIOTIC STRESS

16.4.1 Leaf expansion

Water influx into a growing plant cell powers its expansion. Reduced expansion is one
of the first symptoms of water limitation. As water moves down a gradient in potential,
expanding cells attract water only if the local water potential is lower than elsewhere
in the soil–plant system. As influx of water increases the water potential, movement of
solutes into the cell expansion zones is a phenomenon that also powers cell expansion
(Fricke and Flowers, 1998; Boyer and Silk, 2004).

Most early studies on cell and leaf expansion used water potential and its components
as independent variables. The relative rate of cell expansion, R, has been described as a
linear function of turgor (cid:4)P(cid:5) above a threshold value (cid:4)Pt(cid:5), below which there is no cell
growth. This association is represented by

R = m(cid:4)P − Pt(cid:5)(cid:3)

(16.2)
where m = the extensibility factor of the cell wall. Limitation of water supply results
in lower leaf water potentials (Vos and Groenwold, 1988), and Eq. (16.2) shows how
reduced leaf growth is also an early symptom of water limitation. Early work by Gan-
= 0(cid:9)5 MPa for potato. If Pt and m had conservative
dar and Tanner (1976) indicated Pt
values, this would offer practical options for relating rates of extension processes to
(soil) water potential. However, reality is more complex: according to Passioura and
Fry (1992), these coefficients are not conservative at all, in several cases being func-
tions of P, themselves. That makes doubtful the application of Eq. (16.2) to practical
problems.

Leaves that expand during a period of limited water supply grow to smaller sizes and
show lower specific leaf area (SLA) than leaves of well-watered controls. The magnitude
of effects is illustrated in Fig. 16.4. Reduced SLA implies a larger effect of water limitation
on area than on leaf dry weight.

Jefferies (1989) measured the rates of leaf length extension on drought stressed and
control potato plants. The relative leaf extension rate (stressed/control) showed a quadratic
association with soil moisture deficit (SMD) (Fig. 16.5A) and a linear relation with leaf
water potential (Fig. 16.5B). Associations such as that in Fig. 16.5A are specific to soil
type and root distribution and depend on weather conditions. Furthermore, one can apply
the associations of Fig. 16.5 to particular potato crops only if the rate of leaf extension of
well-watered plants is known or estimated in some way. Wider application of Fig. 16.5B
seems justified (because leaf water potential reacts to both weather and soil conditions),
provided leaf water potential is monitored exactly as described by Jefferies (1989): top
leaves of plants measured between 1300 and 1400 h. This short review indicates that the

relation between water limitation and leaf expansion is not general and clear cut at all.
As for stomatal reactions, evidence is accumulating that responses of extension growth
to water limitation are not simply controlled by water potential.

16.4.2 Effect of drought on plant calcium and 13C concentrations

Two indicators provide a cumulative reflection of the degree of drought stress a potato
plant has been subjected to during its lifetime: its concentrations of calcium and 13C.

The calcium concentration in plant parts is decreased when plants are subjected to
drought. This is because the plant takes up less water per unit dry matter production
(its water-use efficiency increases), whereas calcium is exclusively transported through
the transpiration flow. Supply of calcium to plant roots can be accounted for by mass
flow in most soils (Brewster and Tinker, 1970). Haverkort et al. (1996) tested dozens of
genotypes varying in earliness in a dry and a wet year.

sampling date 21 June and closed symbol 29 July 1991. (B) Open symbol sampling date 17 July and closed
symbol August 1992. [Source: Haverkort et al. (1996).]

The foliar calcium concentrations were between 0.5 and 2% in the dry year (1991) and
more than double that level in the wet year (1992) (Fig. 16.6). Later sampling dates also
showed higher calcium concentrations than at earlier sampling dates, indicating that more
calcium-containing water was transpired, leaving calcium behind, as time progressed.
Finally, the later the genotype, the longer it continues to form new leaves, and the younger
the average age of such leaves is, hence the lower their calcium concentration.

Whereas potato plants subjected to drought have a lower foliar calcium concentration
than unstressed plants, they have a higher concentration of 13C. Like all higher plants with
conventional C3 pathways, potato has a 13C (cid:11) 12C ratio about 20% less than carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere (Farquhar et al., 1982). Potato plants discriminate against 13CO2 during
its diffusion from the air to the intercellular spaces. Also the primary carboxylation enzyme
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) discriminates against 13CO2.
If a plant is subjected to drought, discrimination is less because the 13C accumulates in the
intercellular cavities and more of it is carboxylated. Changes in 13C content are expressed
in isotope fractionation or isotope discrimination units, (cid:4)13E(cid:5) (‰) , commonly assuming
negative values between −22 and −14‰ in potato, with less negative numbers indicating
less discrimination (Vos and Groenwold, 1989a; Haverkort and Valkenburg, 1992).

Figure 16.7 shows the relation between 13C discrimination and water-use efficiency:
dry spells lead to increased water-use efficiencies and less 13C discrimination. With time,
the effect of an early drought wears off, especially in the leaves some of which were
formed after the drought treatment was discontinued. The effect remained stronger in the
tubers than in the green leaves. The authors reported that 13C discrimination increased
with plant age but that older plants were less efficient users of water because of increased
respiration.

Changes in calcium and 13C concentrations leave lasting marks in the plant’s chemistry,

revealing water limitation during (part of) the plant’s life cycle.

16.5 WATER USE, LEAF DYNAMICS AND POTATO PRODUCTIVITY

16.5.1 Water-use efficiency in different climates

Uptake and assimilation of carbon dioxide are intimately linked with transpirational loss
of water, and a linear relation between potato production and water use is commonly
found in very divergent agro-ecological conditions (Shalhevet et al., 1983; Feddes, 1987).

observed a slope of 35 kg ha
variation in the slopes of such relations that are observed among different studies can be
attributed to systematic differences in the average water vapour pressure deficit (VPD) of
the air. The effect of this climatic variable can be mediated by scaling the water use by
the VPD, giving a fairly conservative estimate of the productivity per unit transpiration,
−1 kPa, as reported by Feddes (1987) (Fig. 16.8). That value is equal
2740 kg ha
to the one quoted by Tanner (1981) and Tanner and Sinclair (1983) if one adjusts for
the different units used. In those papers, Tanner and Sinclair set an upper limit for the

Plots of production versus water use commonly show a positive intercept with the
x-axis, representing water use at zero production. The magnitude of that intercept is
associated with non-transpirational, evaporative losses from the soil. For instance, Shal-
hevet et al. (1983) observed similar slopes but different intercepts between sprinkler- and
drip-irrigation systems; the intercept with the x-axis, i.e. non-transpirational losses, was
112 mm for drip irrigation versus 197 mm for sprinkler irrigation. Especially when irri-
gation water is expensive, non-transpiration losses need to be minimized, e.g. by drip or
trickle irrigation with subsurface tubes. Large evaporative losses should also be avoided
on soils that are prone to salinity problems.

Under (mild) water limitation, transpiration is more reduced than photosynthesis result-
ing in 33% higher water-use efficiency under water limitation (50% regime) than in
controls (Vos and Groenwold, 1989a). On a seasonal basis, the effect of water limitation
on water-use efficiency depends on the fraction of the season over which plants were
subjected to stress.

16.5.2 Relative transpiration and leaf dynamics

Although plant dry matter production per unit water transpired is up to 33% higher during
water limitation than with optimal water supply, the following linear relation still holds
as an approximation:

Ya
Yp
where Y = dry matter production (cid:4)kg ha
−1(cid:5) and T = transpiration (mm) over a particular
period of time or until maturity and the indices a = actual and p = potential (no water
limitation).

Vos and Haverkort

Equation (16.3) implies that the loss of production is directly proportional to the deficit
between actual (cumulative) transpiration and the transpiration that would be achieved by
a crop provided with non-limiting supply of water. There are two categories of responses
behind Eq. (16.3), namely the effects of water limitation on instantaneous gas exchange
and the effects of water limitation on the dynamics of production and senescence of
leaves. Equation (16.3) reflects that, at the stomatal level, entry of carbon dioxide is not
possible without water loss. One simply cannot have the one without the other. Declining
stomatal aperture is among the earliest signs of drought.

Ta depends on the amount of solar energy absorbed by the crop. Therefore, Ta depends
on leaf dynamics over the season. There are three ways in which transient water limitation
affects seasonal leaf dynamics. First, leaves that expand under water limitation grow to
smaller sizes and show lower SLA than leaves of well-watered controls (Fig. 16.4). The
immediate effect of smaller leaf sizes on radiation absorption depends on the amount
of leaf already present and on whether the crop already intercepts all the solar radiation
[leaf area index (LAI) >3–4]. Second, water limitation will slow down the rate of
leaf appearance or will postpone the appearance of particular orders of apical branches
(Fig. 16.9). Prolonged drought will not only hamper the production of new leaves but
enhance leaf senescence in an acropetal direction. Unfortunately, as yet, accelerated
leaf senescence in response to drought stress has not been quantified. Third, there is
slowed maturation and compensatory leaf production upon recovery from transient water
stress. Such effects are illustrated in Fig. 16.10. During water limitation [50–83 days
after planting (DAP)], drought-treated plants produced much less leaf area on apical
branches than did controls. However, at 131 DAP, i.e. some 50 days after returning to
full water supply on 83 DAP, it turned out that treated plants had significantly more
leaf area remaining on the main stem than the controls had, implying a reduced rate of
senescence of existing leaves in plants subjected to transient stress. Between 83 and 131
DAP, leaf area on the first-order apical branches of treated plants caught up with controls
and showed much more leaf area than the controls on the second-order apical branches,
i.e. leaves that appeared after the treatment period. Slowed senescence of existing leaves

and enhanced growth of new leaves after recovery from transient drought are features that
are not well quantified, and further study is needed in this area, particularly in relation to
maturity class.

The interaction between drought and temperature is another aspect that has had inad-
equate treatment in drought research. In rainout shelters, one can study effects of water
regime on leaf dynamics for plant configurations as in a field canopy. Interruption of
water supply will eventually induce stress in plants, even if the temperature is cool and
the sky is overcast. However, it is questionable whether the effects of drought stress,
observed in such systems, are the same as those occurring under the combination of
drought stress, high temperature and exposure to full sunlight. Here again, there are no
data available.

16.5.3 Interactions between drought and biotic stresses

Pests and diseases may reduce the growth and production of potato crops partly through
their impact on the plant water economy. Haverkort et al. (1990a) and Bowden and Rouse
(1991) studied the interaction between drought and effects of Verticillium dahliae (caus-
ing ‘wilting disease’). Symptoms such as reduced stomatal conductance and reduced rates
of transpiration and photosynthesis appeared 1 month after the inoculation of plantlets.
Table 16.1 summarizes the results of a container experiment in which stomatal conduc-
tance and transpiration of individual leaves was measured with a handheld porometer.
Wilting disease caused drought symptoms especially in the lower leaves, corroborated
with high levels of V. dahliae infection in the corresponding nodes. Compared with the
highest leaves along the stem, droughted control plants also showed reduced transpiration
and stomatal conductance in the lower leaves as might be expected as they are subjected
to less sunlight and they are older than the upper ones.

Potato cyst nematodes are also known to affect water collection as nematodes infest
roots. Evans et al. (1975) reported a decrease of the leaf water potential and an increase
of the stomatal resistance of leaves of potatoes infected with the potato cyst nematode
Globodera rostochiensis. Haverkort et al. (1991) showed that both drought and potato
cyst nematodes reduced plant water potential (Table 16.2) but that the effects were less
than additive. A similar response was found in their trials for gas exchange and water-use
efficiency. Both drought and nematodes led to increased dry matter concentrations in
all plant components. Schans (1991) infected roots with juvenile 2 stages of Globodera
pallida cyst nematodes and measured reduced gas exchange (CO2 and H2O) within 3 days,
putatively through a signalling function of ABA. Schans and Arntzen (1991) reported that
photosynthetic and transpiration rates were severely reduced 30 days after infection but
that thereafter the difference between infected plants and control diminished, probably
because a new equilibrium was reached between supply and consumption of water. Also,

it should be noted, infected plants take up less water (Haverkort et al., 1991) depleting
soil water at a lower rate than controls. Compared with controls, Haverkort et al. (1994)
−3 in the
found root length density of infected plants to decline from about 2 to 1 cm cm
topsoil and from about 0(cid:9)5 cm cm

−3 to almost 0 in the subsoil.

Whereas drought and cyst nematodes or V. dahliae proved to exert less than addi-
tive negative impacts, free-living nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans) and Verticillium
showed synergism manifested by reduced gas exchange in potato (Saeed et al., 1997).

16.6 VARIETAL DIFFERENCES IN DROUGHT TOLERANCE

Varieties may vary in their tolerance of drought, expressed as the relative yield of
crops subjected to drought compared with crops optimally supplied with water. Drought
tolerance can also be defined as the relative ability of a variety to produce potato tubers
from a limiting amount of water. Different aspects of tolerance may assume importance,
depending on the timing of water limitation, e.g. early in the season before establishment
of stem and tuber numbers, or in the middle of the season when shoots and tubers are
growing, or during maturation when no more leaves are being produced and tuber bulking
is the main growth process. Spitters and Schapendonk (1990) evaluated drought situations
and crop behaviour in a simulation model. Characteristics that assumedly may vary when
genotypes are subjected to water limitation include the light-use efficiency, SLA and leaf
senescence rate (leaf longevity). The simulated instantaneous effects of drought on such
characteristics were substantial, but the ultimate effect on tuber yield was much less and
correlated best with the total amount of water transpired [Eq. (16.3)]. Short periods of
early drought (up to mid-June) especially affected early genotypes that typically allocate
more dry matter to the tubers early in the growth cycle and less to the foliage than
late varieties. An early drought led to leaf shedding, and no recuperation was possible.
Severe late droughts favoured the early varieties as the later varieties had not allocated
similar proportions of dry matter to the tubers. Late genotypes generally tolerated short
periods of transient drought relatively better than early ones. Haverkort et al. (1992)
examined effects of transient drought on varieties differing in maturity class (Table 16.3)

Fresh tuber yield (Y) equals the product of intercepted solar radiation (R), the

matter concentration (DMC). Varieties are ranked in increased lateness. [Source:

and found that the factor affected most by transient drought switched from radiation
interception to radiation-use efficiency across the spectrum of early to late varieties.
They noted that varieties that shed their leaves (early varieties) before others (late ones)
maintained a higher radiation-use efficiency, and vice versa. The results summarized in
Table 16.3 were corroborated by Tourneux et al. (2003) who compared six Solanum and
Andigenum genotypes that represented a great diversity in morphological characteristics
such as number of leaves and stem length. These characteristics led to varying degrees of
ground cover and hence intercepted radiation that was the main determinant of the yield
differences because of drought.

That tolerance of drought depends mainly on the time of drought and on the lateness of
the genotype was also concluded by DeBlonde et al. (1999). They found early genotypes
to escape a late drought, suffering relatively less than late ones, whereas late varieties
tolerated an early drought period better. Moreover, they found that the harvest index
is reduced by drought indicating that it is one of the factors reducing yield as shown
hypothetically by Spitters and Schapendonk (1990) in their modelling exercise.

Genetic differences in water-use efficiency are in the order of 15% between extremes
and were found to correlate with 13C discrimination (Vos and Groenwold, 1989a). Superior
water-use efficiency would be a valuable trait, implying larger production from a limited
amount of water, or conversely a lower requirement for irrigation water to achieve a par-
ticular level of production. In wheat, also, lower 13C discrimination correlates with higher
water-use efficiency. This led to research, exploring the benefit and feasibility of varieties
with improved water-use efficiency. However, it appeared that in the absence of water
limitation, water-efficient genotypes generally performed less than ‘water spending’ types
(Condon et al., 2004). Yet, commercial wheat varieties were developed that combine good
productivity and improved water-use efficiency. In potato, Tourneux et al. (2003) found
the relative yield to correlate with 13C discrimination, but the variation explained less than
42%. Jefferies and MacKerron (1997) arrived at the conclusion that assessing 13C discrim-
ination is not a useful breeding tool as differences among varieties did not significantly
correspond with either water-use efficiency or final yield over a growing season.

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are expected to rise. Higher water-use efficiencies
are found under raised CO2 levels because higher CO2 concentrations result in (transient)
increase in the rate of leaf photosynthesis in potato and because stomatal conductance is
lower (Lawson et al., 2001). The latter results in reduced transpiration. The varietal differ-
ences in water-use efficiency observed under current atmospheric CO2 concentrations are
associated with differences in stomatal conductance, too (Vos and Groenwold, 1989a,b),
and it would be interesting to explore how these genetic differences are modulated by
raised atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

16.7 EFFECTS OF WATER AVAILABILITY ON QUALITY

The two factors most determining quality of potato are dry matter concentration and
tuber size distribution. Dry matter concentration always increases with the duration of
growth and ranges from about 10% at tuber initiation to anywhere between 15 and 25%
at harvest. The latter range depends on variety of causes, such as length of the growing

Water availability and potato crop performance

season, variety, average temperature during the growing season and the availability of
water especially at the end of the growing season. The dry matter concentration of the
tubers correlates well with the harvest index (DeBlonde et al., 1999). Too severe a drought
reduces the harvest index, and the dry matter concentration then is lower than in crops that
continue to grow to full maturity. A moderate drought at the end of the growing season
usually leads to an increase of the dry matter concentration [Table 16.3 (Haverkort et al.,
1992) and DeBlonde et al. (1999)].

The tuber size distribution of a potato crop depends on the yield and the number
of tubers per square metre, which in turn depends on the number of stems per square
metre and the number of tubers per stem. The stem number is independent of the water
availability during the growing season as it is determined by factors prior to emergence
such as variety, tuber size and the physiological age of the seed tubers. Haverkort et al.
(1990b) subjected potato plants to early drought and counted the number of stems,
stolons, tuber initials and tubers. A drought period before stolon appearance greatly
reduced the number of stolons, but the subsequent number of tuber initials and tubers
was unaffected (variety Radosa) or even increased (variety Bintje). A drought period
after stolon and tuber initiation hardly affected tuber numbers in controlled conditions.
The authors analysed 13-year experimental data of cultivar Bintje from a particular
experimental station. Figure 16.11 shows the relation between the number of tubers
per stem and precipitation during the first 60 days after planting. The relation can be
represented by

Tubers
Stem

= 0(cid:9)0196 P + 1(cid:9)44(cid:4)R = 0(cid:9)93(cid:5)(cid:3)

(16.4)
where P = precipitation in millimetre. Although the final yield did not correspond signif-
icantly with the amount of rainfall during the first 60 days, the final tuber size did: higher
tuber numbers led to smaller average tuber size at final harvest. Especially, when high
numbers are aimed for – in seed production – adequate moisture availability at stolon
formation is essential.

The effects of water availability on quality are known but are less easily influenced
by growers than is final yield, which correlates well with the amount of light intercepted

by the crop (if water is not limiting) and correlates well with the amount of water
transpired by the crop. Dry soil conditions at the end of the growing season lead to
higher dry matter concentrations of the tubers, which may be an advantage where tubers
are produced for the processing industry that usually desires higher ranges of solids to
increase the recovery rates in the production of chips and crisps. Growers then are given a
bonus for high concentrations of solids. Jefferies et al. (1989) analysed data from several
experiments with three varieties over several years to derive relations between tuber dry
matter concentration and thermal time and water supply. Their model uses a quadratic
relation in thermal time and a linear relation with SMD. The relation takes the form:

D = a+ bT(cid:12)

+ cT(cid:12)

2 + dSMD(cid:3)

(cid:2)

= thermal time (K days) from 50%
where D = tuber dry matter concentration (%), T(cid:12)
C and a− d = all coefficients. The relation
emergence above a base temperature of 0
was validated against an independent data set where the relation accounted for 79.3%
of the variance in the observed data. A sensitivity analysis showed that every change of
10 mm in SMD produces a change of 0.6 percentage points in dry matter concentration.
Higher dry matter concentration is undesirable for the fresh potato market, and in such
production conditions, an additional final irrigation may increase the tuber water content
and the total fresh weight of the crops and thus their market value.

The number of tubers per plant is even more difficult to steer in practice than dry
matter concentration. In general, larger seed tubers lead to more stems per plant, and
moist soil conditions generally lead to increased tuber numbers per stem. How many
stems are formed per seed tuber and how many tubers per stem cannot be predicted with
certainty. Growers aiming at producing large tubers for processing using varieties that
generally produce a lot of tubers (e.g. Bintje) cannot plan to withhold water around tuber
initiation. Instead, they should plan their seed rates on the assumption that the soil will be
moist between planting and tuber initiation. Then, if the rainfall is inadequate, irrigation
can be used to return the soil to the planned condition. This approach is valid whether
growing ‘shy’ varieties or ones that produce many tubers and whether growing for seed
(small tubers required) or bakers (large tubers required) as it removes one variable from
the procedure and allows the seed rate to be chosen to suit the variety and the market
requirements.

Potato crop response to radiation and

daylength

A.J. Haverkort

As Monteith (1969) interpreted crop growth in terms of radiation interception, dry matter
accumulation was described less and less as a function of actual dry matter and its relative
increase over time. The fraction of light passing through the canopy without interception
by the leaves depends on the leaf area index (LAI) which in turn determines the proportion
of ground covered by green leaves. Intercepted radiation has been found to be linearly
correlated with the quantity of dry matter produced which, in the case of potatoes, is
distributed over the tubers and the other parts of the plant. Of the total incoming radiation,
plants use only wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm for photosynthesis (McCree, 1972)
which is about 0(cid:2)5× global solar radiation (Monteith, 1969). Since Scott and Wilcockson
(1978) first related measurement of light interception in potato crops to dry matter
accumulation, there has been a steady flow of publications on how to measure intercepted
radiation, on radiation use efficiency (RUE), and how it is influenced by biotic and
abiotic environmental influences, for example, Khurana and McLaren (1982) to Shah et al.
(2004). Moreover, it was recognized increasingly that development, driven by genotype,
seed age, temperature and photoperiod, could be quantified partly in combination with
radiation-driven growth. The concept also provided the basis for three international potato
modelling conferences held in 1990, 1994 and 2003, of which the proceedings were
published. In Kabat et al. (1995), the authors compared the performance of potato growth
models, mainly simulating potential yields but also yields limited by water and nutrients.
In Haverkort and MacKerron (1995), more environmental effects were simulated, and
some applications (e.g. climatic change and agro-ecological zoning) were reported. In
MacKerron and Haverkort (2004), the quantitative approaches and their use in decision
support systems for policymakers and growers were shown.

17.1 RADIATION

17.1.1 Development of radiation interception

Radiation interception by the canopy can be described conveniently in four phases during
the development of the crop over the growing season (Fig. 17.1). Throughout these
phases, the crop growth rate can be calculated using the foliar expansion rate, whereas

the light-use efficiency determines the total amount of dry matter produced. During Phase
0 – between planting and emergence – the crop does not intercept radiation, and its
development (sprout growth) only depends on soil temperature. There is no increase in
dry matter. Phase 1 covers the period between emergence (usually defined as the moment
when 50% of the plants have emerged) and tuber initiation. Its duration depends on the
development rate until tuber initiation.

Phase 2 covers a period between tuber initiation and the stage when 90–100% of the
daily acquired assimilates are partitioned to the tubers. This level of partitioning is only
reached asymptotically and, as such, cannot be determined precisely. The length of Phase
2 depends on the relative tuber growth rate, which determines partitioning of dry matter
between the tubers and the rest of the plant. The duration of Phase 3 is determined by
the rate of leaf senescence and end of crop growth (EC) (Kooman and Haverkort, 1995).
As will be shown in Section 17.1.2, there is a close correlation between the proportion
of intercepted solar radiation, the LAI and the proportion of the ground covered by green
leaves. The LAI [area of leaves (cid:3)m2(cid:4) per area of soil (cid:3)m2(cid:4)] is determined by the amount
−2(cid:4) and by the specific leaf
of dry matter produced and partitioned to the leaves (cid:3)g m
area [area of leaf formed (cid:3)m2(cid:4) per weight of leaf dry matter (g)]. When a potato crop
emerges, its initial foliar growth is entirely due to temperature-dependent translocation
of dry matter from the mother tuber to the emerging shoots. Usually potato crops have
−1. Prior to emergence, the leaves are
leaves with a specific leaf area of about 200 cm2g
much thicker, and they expand after emergence, leading to a greater specific leaf area
and a strong increase of the early LAI. The rate of leaf expansion is also determined by
temperature (Fig. 17.2).

Once the mother tuber is exhausted or when dry matter translocation stops for other
reasons, all growth is autotrophic. To determine the transition from translocation-driven
growth to autotrophic dry matter accumulation through intercepted radiation, Van Delden
et al. (2001) compared the performance of a model simulating the increase in LAI (cid:3)L(cid:4)

in turn, depended on intercepted radiation, that is the model simulated radiation-limited

of L at the switch to autotrophic growth, was equal to 1 (cid:3)R2 = 0(cid:2)91(cid:4). The sensitivity
analysis in Fig. 17.3 also shows that the value of 1 for Ls gave close to the minimum
rates of change in leaf area expansion and crop dry weight.

17.1.2 Measurement of radiation interception

Solar radiation intercepted by green leaves is used for dry matter production. As explained
in the introduction, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is only about half of the
incident solar energy. Several methods exist to assess the proportion of solar radiation
that is intercepted by the crop.

Figure 17.4 represents two courses in the development of ground cover and, hence,
radiation interception. One where full ground cover is achieved and sustained and one
where the crop does not achieve 100% ground cover. Proper measurement of radiation
interception by the canopy is essential for interpretation of the influence of the envi-
ronment on the crop, although measurement of ground cover by the canopy provides
an approximation. Simulation of the effects of the environment on crop growth and
development hinges on good estimates of both incident and intercepted solar radiation.

An appropriate estimate of the proportion of PAR that is intercepted by the foliage
can be made using tube solarimeters above and below the canopy with a length equal to
the distance between the rows of the crop so as to sample all parts of the row equally.
Tube solarimeters measure total solar radiation, and so, an assumption is made that any
changes in the spectral composition above and below the canopy are non-significant.
Other instruments (e.g. Ceptometer) are available that will measure PAR rather than total
solar radiation, but these are more expensive and tend to be used as portable devices to
make spot measurements across a crop. Using the cheaper tube solarimeters in permanent
locations allows measurements to be integrated across the whole day.

The proportion of the ground covered by green leaves can provide an acceptable
estimate of intercepted radiation. Proportional ground cover (PGC) can be estimated using
a grid divided in 100 equal sections viewed directly from above (Burstall and Harris,
1983). The dimensions of the frame should be a multiple of the planting pattern. When
rows are 75 cm apart and plants are spaced at 30 cm within the row, a frame of 75×90 cm

is appropriate. A measurement consists of counting the sections more than half filled with
green leaves.

Measurements of the amount of incoming infrared radiation reflected by the canopy
have been found to correlate well with the PGC (Birnie et al., 1987), offering a third non-
destructive estimate. A radiometer may be multispectral, but for estimating canopy cover,
the radiometer is fitted with filters allowing wavelengths between 836 and 846 nm to pass.
The hemispherical irradiance and the crop reflectance are measured nearly simultaneously.
The downward angle of view of the system is such that the estimate is based on about
1 m2 of the canopy.

Light entering at the top of the canopy is extinguished with different extinction coef-
ficients of the several radiation components (e.g. Spitters et al., 1986; Monteith, 2000).
The light profile within the canopy can be characterized experimentally by destructive
means in which light is measured above and below the canopy, and the leaf area is
determined by detaching leaves and determining their area with a commercially available
−kL where
leaf area meter. The proportion of PAR intercepted is calculated as PPAR
L stands for LAI and k for the extinction coefficient that, typically, has a value of about
0.4 (Khurana and McLaren, 1982; Burstall and Harris, 1983; Haverkort et al., 1991).

= 1−e

Haverkort et al. (1991) compared PGC measured with the grid, LAI and infrared
reflectance. They found highly significant correlations between the various methods
(Fig. 17.5). The authors found that a disadvantage of the solarimeter is that it does
not distinguish between green leaves and brown leaves and stems. The method tends
to overestimate intercepted radiation in the second half of the growing season. The
relationship between PGC measured with the grid and LAI was linear up to LAI = 3 after
which full ground cover was reached.

17.1.3 Environmental effects on interception of solar radiation

crop. Total incident PAR depends on the place on earth, time of the year and length of
the growing season. Figure 17.6A shows that, in summer in a northern temperate climate,
−2 per day during the growing season, possibly
incident PAR varies widely around 9 MJ m
between day 130 and 270, and then it declines. Crops in that part of the world will have
been harvested by then. Figure 17.6B shows the development of PAR over time in a
Mediterranean autumn growing season where its value declines strongly from about 15
to about 3 MJ m

−2 per day between planting on day 250 and harvest on day 350.

The highest amounts of radiation intercepted by potato crops are achieved when the
length of the crop cycle matches closely the available length of the growing season.
The latter is usually determined by the suitable temperature window for potato produc-
tion between about 5 and 30
C (MacKerron and Haverkort, 2004). The most common
instrument potato growers have to match cycle and season is the choice of the variety.
The length of time to maturity (its earliness or lateness) should suit the length of the
available season, and subsequently, growers take care that the period when solar radiation
is intercepted is not shortened by lack of inputs such as water and nutrients nor by pests
and diseases.

(cid:2)

Many abiotic factors such as supply of nitrogen (Fig. 17.7) or of water or early or late
frosts may reduce soil cover and so radiation interception to varying degrees. Similarly,
biotic factors such as potato cyst nematodes (Shah et al., 2004) and late blight caused
by Phytophthora infestans may cause drastic reduction of yield even as the sole cause of
reduced radiation interception (Haverkort and Bicamumpaka, 1986; Van Oijen, 1991).

after the appearance of the flag leaf, potato crops may shed leaves when conditions
are unfavourable (drought and exhaustion of nutrients) yet are able to form new leaves
when conditions for growth improve. Therefore, the dynamics of the ability to intercept
radiation (Fig. 17.7) is greater. Even so, a great spread in RUE values has been reported
−1. Part of this spread may be due to the methodologies used
varying from 1.5 to 4 g MJ
to measure PAR and its interception, but a large part is due to environmental, abiotic,
and biotic factors (Sinclair and Muchow (1999)).

Manrique et al. (1991) referred to light use efficiency and showed these values to
−1, with
be negatively correlated with total solar radiation between 10 and 25 MJ m
C and with increased vapour
increased mean daily temperature between 13 and 26
pressure deficit between values of 0.4 and 1.5 kPa. In their model for potato growth under
tropical highland conditions, based on experiments near the equator at elevations between
1300 and 2400 m above sea level, Haverkort and Harris (1987) corrected the conservative
RUE for high temperatures and high levels of solar radiation with quantitative routines.
Kooman and Haverkort (1995) elaborated this further to modify light use efficiency
according to light intensity (roughly equivalent to PAR) as shown in Fig. 17.8.

(cid:2)

RUE may or may not be affected by biotic factors such as pests and diseases. Late
blight caused by P. infestans only reduces radiation interception but not the RUE as was
shown conclusively by Haverkort and Bicamumpaka (1986) and by Van Oijen (1991).
Inferences from that are that late blight did not influence photosynthesis or respiration.
Some other pests and diseases influence the crop other than by removing foliage and
may influence the RUE. For example, Haverkort et al. (1992) showed that potato cyst
nematodes reduced the amount of intercepted radiation and the RUE. They observed
disrupted water relations inferred from changes in water use efficiency and discrimination

17.2 DAYLENGTH

17.2.1 Morphology

Menzel (1985a,b) cited several authors – mainly from the first half of the twenti-
eth century – who reported that compared with short photoperiods, long photoperiods
increase stem elongation and stem weight. The numbers of leaves and their weight
are also increased while the size of the leaves and leaflets are less. Struik and Ewing
(1995) reported a lot of research, both published and unpublished, on the influence
of temperature and daylength on a number of crop characteristics. These are summa-
rized in Table 17.1. Struik and Ewing (1995) demonstrated the effect of photoperiod
(and temperature) on number of lateral stems per sympodium and per entire shoot
(Table 17.2) for a short day variety, Atzimba, and a long day variety, Van Gogh. Long
days stimulated the development of the sympodium, particularly in Atzimba and espe-
cially at the lower temperature. The higher temperature stimulated development at both
photoperiods.

17.2.2 Tuber initiation

In Menzel’s (1985a) review of previous literature, he defined a critical photoperiod (CPP)
of a cultivar. The change from short to long days is associated with changed growth
response in morphology and tuberization. As photoperiod increases towards the CPP,
tuberization becomes irregular, then is retarded and finally is inhibited. Although all
potatoes have a short-day reaction, there is a strong genotype × environment interaction.
Bodlaender (1963) found the CPP to increase at high temperatures and at low irradiance.
In general, Solanum tuberosum subsp. andigena varieties have a CPP of about 12 h and
S. tuberosum subsp. tuberosum a CPP of about 16 h.

Following the early work on the timing of tuber initiation, emphasis shifted to the
consequences of (early) tuberization and early tuber growth. Van Dam et al. (1996) sub-
jected two varieties in controlled conditions with varying lengths of day and average
daily temperatures (Table 17.3) and recorded the number of days until tubers appeared
and the initial proportion of daily accumulated dry matter partitioned to the tubers.

Longer days retarded tuberization, especially at higher temperatures, and also decreased
the relative partitioning rate of dry matter to the tubers. These findings are in line with
other studies (Wolf et al., 1990) and Lorenzen and Ewing (1990) who subjected potato
plants to changes in photoperiod and followed their dry matter partitioning through 14C
distribution and periodic harvests. Kooman et al. (1996a,b) carried out field trials on
variety × temperature × daylength in the Tunisian spring (11 h daylength at emer-
gence) and the northern European summer (17 h). They defined the development rate
as the inverse of duration from emergence until tuberization. Figure 17.9 clearly shows

higher rates of development (indicative of earlier tuberization) at the shortest daylength.
The figures corroborate Van Dam’s finding that higher temperatures enhance daylength
effects.

17.2.3 Short day sensitivity

Tuberization in the wild-type potato is sensitive to daylength, requiring short days. The
expression of the characteristic is less evident in the cultivated S. tuberosum but is not
absent. Phytochrome is known to be involved in this because the effects of a night break
of red light can be reversed by a far-red light treatment given immediately afterwards.
Jackson et al. (1997) demonstrated which of the several phytochromes that are known to
exist is responsible for the photoperiodic response in potato. They produced transgenic
anti-sense short-day-requiring S. tuberosum subsp. andigena plants which had much lower
levels of phytochrome B. These plants were able to tuberize under short and long days;
the tuber inducing signal was present. In contrast, through grafting, the tuber-inducing
signal in the wild-type was present only under short days.

Arabidopsis CONSTANS (AtCO) is a putative transcription factor known to accelerate
flowering in long-day conditions. Martínez-García et al. (2002) have shown that constitu-
tive overexpression of that gene in potato impairs tuberization under short-day inductive
conditions. AtCO overexpressing lines of S. tuberosum subsp. andigena required longer
exposure to short days before they could tuberize. Using grafts of these lines proved
that AtCO exerts its action (prohibiting tuber formation) through the leaves. In potato, it
delays tuberization. Development of improved understanding of the factors influencing
tuberization promises to lead to the breeding of cultivars with the timing of tuberization
matched to the growing season of diverse locations.

17.2.4 Earliness

Potato crops mature earlier if a greater proportion of daily dry matter is allocated to
the tubers leaving less for the foliage. When all daily assimilates are allocated to the
tuber, leaf growth ends and after a temperature-dependent period of time (Kooman
et al., 1996b) the foliage dies. Hence, earlier tuber initiation and subsequent early dry
matter partitioning to the tubers led to earlier maturing crops. So, tuberization induced
by short photoperiods has an effect on the earliness of crop maturity. Kooman et al.
(1996b) showed that the longer the duration between emergence and tuber initiation
(Fig. 17.1, Phase 1) the longer the two subsequent phases last (from tuber initiation
until end of leaf growth and end of leaf growth until crop death, Fig. 17.1). This is
shown in Fig. 17.10: later tuber initiation is correlated with later maturing crops over
a wide range of cultivars and environments. The authors found the length of Phase 1
(Fig. 17.9) to depend strongly on radiation and temperature, the length of Phase 2 also
on these two factors but to a lesser extent, and the length of Phase 3 was shortened by
higher temperatures and higher levels of solar radiation. Clearly, the photoperiod-induced
timing of tuber initiation is the factor most determining the earliness or lateness of a
potato crop.

Responses of the Potato Plant to Temperature

18.1 INTRODUCTION

The production and quality of a potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plant is determined by the
dynamics of the development of many organs (including stems, leaves, stolons, tubers and
roots), the total dry matter production and the dry matter partitioning. Yield is determined
by the number of plants per square metre, the number of tuber-bearing stems per plant, the
number of stolons per tuber-bearing stem, the number of tubers per stolon and the average
tuber weight. These parameters are all a result of a sequence of complex physiological
events, many of them strongly influenced by temperature. The relative response of potato
to temperature differs greatly between physiological processes.

18.1.1 Background and warnings

When discussing the literature on the effects of temperature, it is essential to discriminate
between different parts of the plant exposed to certain temperatures, the period of exposure
to specific temperature treatments and the range over which the temperature effects
are investigated. For example, temperature effects on tuberization are very different for
increases in temperature in the air, in the nutrient solution where the roots are grown or
in the stolon environment where stolons and tubers are kept. Effects are also different for
short or long exposure and for exposure during specific developmental stages. Finally,
effects of increases in temperature can be opposite for different ranges.

The general literature on temperature on plant and crop physiology discriminates
between a base temperature (i.e. the temperature below which a certain process does
not occur), an optimal temperature (i.e. the temperature at which the process reaches its
maximum rate) and a ceiling temperature (i.e. the temperature above which the process
halts completely). In the range from the base temperature to the optimal temperature,
an increase in temperature will result in an increase in the rate of the process. In the
range from the optimal temperature to the ceiling temperature, the process will be slowed
down by an increase in temperature. Below the base temperature and above the ceiling
temperature, the process will not occur at a noticeable rate. Naturally, the changes in
the rates of developmental processes with changes in temperature between the base
temperature and the ceiling temperature are not always linear. Also, if the function is non-
linear, then the development rates will differ between temperature regimes with the same

daily mean but with different diurnal fluctuations. The night temperature (usually being
the lower one) is also considered to be more important for the rates of certain processes
than the day temperature. This could simply be associated with the fact that the night
temperature usually lies within the range of temperatures where the temperature response
is still large and linear, whereas many of the day temperatures are in a range where the
response to temperature is much smaller and curvilinear. This means that temperature
sum (or thermal time, i.e. the integral of the product of time and temperature) is not
always a useful concept. This is more so when the response to temperature also depends
on plant age or stage of development.

18.1.2 Reader’s guide

In this chapter, the focus will be on the temperature range between the base temperature
and the ceiling temperature as experienced by a plant in the field or in facilities of
climatic control. Temperatures at which the plant can no longer function or is even
directly damaged (e.g. temperature at which the plant is killed by frost or scorched by
heat) are not taken into account. The contribution starts with a description of the effects of
temperature during the several phases of the potato plant (from seed tuber planted to seed
tuber stored) and applying the morphological description of above-ground and below-
ground development given elsewhere in this book (Chapter 11, Struik, this volume) as a
guideline. For a proper understanding of the terminology, the readers are referred to that
chapter. Subsequently, effects of temperature on the basic plant processes (photosynthesis,
dry matter production and dry matter partitioning) are described, followed by sections in
which partial exposure to specific temperatures, temporary exposure to certain temperature
treatments and the effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations are described. Finally, we
briefly describe the effects of temperature during storage on the physiology of seed tubers
used to produce the next progeny.

18.2 SPROUT GROWTH, EMERGENCE AND CROP ESTABLISHMENT

The focus in this section is on soil temperatures.

Firman et al. (1991) showed that 20–40 leaf primordia may be produced on sprouts
of ageing sprouted seed tubers kept in storage for a long period, before these sprouts
start flower initiation. This suggests considerable variation in leaf number. However, in
practice, the number of leaves on the main stem is rather constant, although the number
of below-ground nodes may be variable. In normal agricultural practice, in most potato-
growing areas, the seed tuber planted is no longer dormant and often has started sprout
growth. Usually, the seed tubers have not been pre-sprouted for so long that there are
already flower primordia present. This means that the final number of leaves of the
main stem until the first inflorescence is influenced by conditions during storage, pre-
conditioning of the seed, soil temperatures after planting and ambient conditions after
emergence. However, the year-to-year variation in number of leaves of the main stem
until the first inflorescence is much smaller than the variation in number of basal lateral
branches, sympodial branches and number of leaves on those branches.

Soil temperature after planting drives sprout growth. Klemke and Moll (1990) stated
on the basis of a literature review that the optimum growth rate of the sprout is about
20
C or slightly higher. They produced a model for sprout growth which included the
effect of physiological age of the seed tuber.

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

According to this model, emergence requires about 116 K d (Kelvin days, base temper-
ature 2(cid:2)9
C) under optimal soil moisture. The model of MacKerron and Waister (1985)
assumes that seed tubers require 125 K d (base temperature 5
C) for sprouting. Once the
seed tubers have sprouted, sprout extension proceeds at a rate of 1 mm per K d (base

Squire (1995) used data of Sale (1979), Headford (1962) and Kirk et al. (1985) to
analyse the relation between rate of emergence, rate of sprout extension and rate of leaf
primordia formation. He showed clear maximum rates around 25
C for 1/time (expressed
−1) to 50% emergence and sprout extension rate up to 20 mm in length. However, the
in d
optimum temperature for 1/time to 20 leaf primordia was above the highest temperature
tested in the experiment he cited (i.e. above 30
C). These optimal temperatures are well
above normal soil temperatures in temperate regions, but, in semi-tropical and tropical
zones, actual soil temperatures may be well above these optimum temperatures. Sale
(1979) and Midmore (1984) showed that soil temperatures above 25
C delay or even
impede emergence, reduce plant survival and reduce the number of main stems per
plant. Under such conditions, it might be advantageous to grow potato as an intercrop
or relay-crop. The shading of the companion crop reduces soil temperature and damps
temperature fluctuations and therefore advances and improves plant emergence (Midmore
et al., 1988). Later during the growing season, the shading by the intercrop may also
advance tuberization and enhance tuber bulking, although Midmore et al. (1988) observed
a delay in tuberization despite the earlier emergence. Similar effects on soil temperature
can be obtained by mulching (Midmore et al., 1986a,b).

(cid:2)

Rapid emergence and rapid early shoot growth advance the time when maximum light
interception starts. When the duration of the growing season is fixed by haulm killing
or adverse conditions at the end of the growing season, this will result in higher yields.
Rapid emergence and early growth may also increase yields by allowing a higher fraction
of light intercepted during periods when light is abundantly available.

Table 18.1 summarizes data from Van Delden et al. (2000), indicating the thermal
time required from planting until emergence under temperature conditions for different
cultivars, mulch treatments, seed tuber treatments and planting depth.

18.3 THE SHOOT SYSTEM

In this section, the effects of temperature on the development of the shoot system are
described. Effects include leaf appearance rate, the number of leaves per stem, the size of
the leaves, the number of basal and sympodial lateral branches and other morphological
and physiological aspects.

18.3.1 Leaf appearance

C). Above 25

According to the older literature, the rate of leaf appearance peaks at a daytime temperature
C irrespective of night temperature (Borah and Milthorpe, 1962; Vos, 1995). Kirk
of 20
and Marshall (1992) observed that the rate of leaf appearance increased linearly over the
C. The temperature coefficient for the leaf appearance rate was
temperature range 9–25
C, they did not observe a further
0.032 leaves per K d (base temperature 0
increase in rate. However, recent literature gives different results (Fleisher et al., 2006).
Table 18.2 summarizes the results of a recent, thorough study on the effects of temperature
on leaf appearance rate, in which also the leaves of the uppermost apical lateral stems,
including all secondary and tertiary branches, were included. Note that Struik (Chapter 11,
this volume) indicated that the rate of leaf appearance on apical, sympodial branches is
lower than that on the main stem. Table 18.2 summarizes that leaf appearance shows
C. Temperatures above that
optimal values at an average daily temperature of about 28
value show a longer phyllochron (measured in K d). The maximum rate of leaf appearance
is 0.98 leaves per stem (the main stem and the uppermost apical lateral stems including
all secondary and tertiary branches) per day.

18.3.2 Final leaf number

The final number of leaves of the main stem below the first inflorescence is affected by
air temperature, but the effects are rather small within normal temperature ranges (Firman
et al., 1991; Almekinders and Struik, 1994). High temperatures extend the period of leaf
formation through their positive effects on sympodial growth (Marinus and Bodlaender,
1975). Although this temperature effect results in a lower harvest index under higher
temperatures than under lower temperatures, it prolongs the life of the crop if weather
conditions permit continued growth.

The final total number of leaves per plant may be increased greatly by an increase in
temperature, because of the combined effects of an increase in number of basal and apical

lateral branches (Struik et al., 1989a) and an increase in the number of leaves on those
branches. The effect of temperature on the number of leaves per lateral branch at two
photoperiods is summarized for the main stem and three types of branches in Table 18.3.
Indeed, the relative effect of temperature on the number of leaves on the main stem is
smaller than the relative effect on the number of leaves on either the low lateral branch
or the total sympodium. The effects of temperature on the number of leaves of the entire
shoot, however, are mainly brought about by the effect on the number of branches as
the effect on the total shoot is much larger than the effect of one entire sympodium, at
least in short days. Note the interaction between photoperiod and temperature for total
leaf numbers: at higher temperature, there is a negative effect or only very small positive
effect of long day on leaf number, whereas at low temperature, the long-day effect is
large. This interaction is – again – mainly caused by the effects on number of branches
(see also Section 18.3.7).

Increases in air temperature are particularly effective in increasing the number of
leaves present by a given date, but, in some cultivars, higher root temperatures may

have an additional effect because they shift the dry matter partitioning to the haulm
(Struik et al., 1989a). The final number of leaves per plant may be highest at about 30
C
(Mosille, 1985).

(cid:2)

18.3.3 Leaf growth and leaf size

Kirk and Marshall (1992) showed a clear relationship between mature leaf size and
leaf position on the main stem: the mature leaf size first increases with higher leaf
insertion number and subsequently declines. The duration of leaf expansion is much
more conservative than the rate of leaf expansion. Not only the time of appearance of
each individual leaf but also the moment that an individual leaf reaches mature size
can be calculated on the basis of thermal time (Jefferies, 1989; Kirk and Marshall,
1992). Leaf expansion is very sensitive to water stress (Jefferies, 1989; Jefferies and
MacKerron, 1993).

Ewing and Struik (1992) claimed that when plants have been exposed to higher
temperatures, leaves are smaller (shorter and narrower), more abundant (total dry weight
increases), also the leaflets are smaller, and the angle of the leaf to the stem is more acute
and the leaf: stem ratio decreases.

Kirk and Marshall (1992) illustrated the effect of temperature on individual leaf growth.
According to Benoit et al. (1983), the rate and duration of individual leaf growth show an
optimum at a temperature of 25
C, that is slightly below the optimum temperature for the
rate of leaf appearance reported by Fleisher et al. (2006). However, Vos (1995) reported
a lower optimum temperature for rate and duration of leaf growth, in agreement with his
lower optimum temperature for leaf appearance rate. Final leaf size (the product of rate

(cid:2)

Responses to temperature

373

and duration of individual growth) is optimal at relatively low temperatures, especially
because the duration of leaf growth has a low optimum temperature. Individual leaf size
tends to increase with a decrease in temperature well below the optimal temperatures for
leaf appearance rate and leaf expansion rate, that is well below 25
C. Despite the positive
effect of high temperatures on leaf appearance and final leaf number, the negative effects
of high temperature on individual leaf size result in a reduced total leaf area at high
temperature.

(cid:2)

18.3.4 Life span of leaves and specific leaf area

(cid:2)

Vos (1995) inferred from literature data that leaves may have a life span of 60 to more
than 80 days. Struik (Chapter 11, this volume) mentioned a life span between 30 and over
100 days. Vos (1995) also indicated that leaves of the main stems of cv. Bintje senesced
(i.e. turned yellow) at a rate of 0.17 leaves per day when average temperature was 15
C.
Clear data on the effect of temperature on the life span of the individual leaf are scarce.
However, it is generally assumed that the leaf ages physiologically faster under higher
temperatures within a wide range of temperatures (Menzel, 1985). Optimum temperatures
for life span of individual leaves are probably relatively low (Burton, 1972). However,
the life span of the entire plant may be prolonged by an increase in air temperature (Struik
et al., 1989a), certainly when expressed in terms of thermal time, because of the large
positive effect on number of leaves. Stolon and root temperatures may also affect the life
span of the canopy to some extent (Struik et al., 1989a). Under long days, the life span of
the shoot is increased by high temperatures compared with low temperatures, but under
short days, high temperatures may decrease the whole-shoot life span. The development
of the shoot is mainly affected by the number of basal and apical lateral stems. Ewing
and Struik (1992) indicated that senescence may be either accelerated or slowed down by
increasing temperature, depending on photoperiod and other environmental conditions.
Above 30
C, however, senescence is usually accelerated by higher temperatures (Fahem
and Haverkort, 1988; Midmore, 1990; Kooman et al., 1996).

(cid:2)

Kooman et al. (1996) showed that the variation in the duration of the period of
crop senescence is much larger than the variation in the duration of the period between
emergence to tuber initiation or of the period between tuber initiation and the end of
leaf growth. They confirmed that the effects of temperature during this period were
contradictory, although the effect of higher temperature was mostly in the direction of
faster senescence. They explained this contradiction by identifying two opposite effects
of an increase in temperature: (1) higher temperatures may reduce the sink strength of
the tubers, thus slowing down the rate of leaf senescence, and (2) higher temperatures
hasten leaf senescence, thus advancing crop senescence.

Given the effect of temperature on the rate of haulm development, tuberization and
sink strength, it is likely that temperature effects on whole-plant life span interact with
maturity type and with the indeterminate or determinate behaviour of different cultivars.
To some extent, the maturity class of a cultivar can be defined on the basis of the thermal
time required to complete its life cycle naturally. However, the ranking of the cultivars
based on the duration of their life cycle may not be consistent across different ecological
zones. There are large differences between cultivars in their response to temperature

during different phases of development (Kooman et al., 1996), and there are strong three -
way interactions between cultivar, photoperiod and temperature (Ewing and Struik, 1992;
Almekinders and Struik, 1994, 1996) (Tables 18.3 and 18.4). This could result in the
phenomenon that some cultivars that are indeterminate in the North are nearly determinate
in the South.

Temperature affects the specific leaf area (SLA): SLA of plants grown under high

temperatures is higher than that under cool temperatures (Midmore and Prange, 1991).

18.3.5 Number of stems

The number of stems is mainly determined by the seed size, the physiological age of the
seed tubers and their pre-treatment (Struik and Wiersema, 1999) and by the soil conditions
during emergence (see Section 18.2). High temperature during crop establishment can
result in stem death before production takes place. Temperature, however, has a much
larger effect on stem morphology and on the number of basal and apical lateral stems
(see Sections 18.3.6 and 18.3.7).

18.3.6 Stem morphology

Stem morphology is affected by temperature: higher temperatures enhance branching,
both lower branching and sympodial branching. Both root and shoot temperatures have
an effect on these phenomena (Struik et al., 1989a).

Stem growth has a higher optimal temperature than leaf growth, resulting in a decline
in the leaf: stem ratio with an increase in temperature above the optimum for leaf growth.
Lafta and Lorenzen (1995) reported that supra-optimal temperatures resulted in taller
plants, higher stem dry weights and smaller leaves compared with optimal temperatures

for potato growth. Similar results were observed by Prange et al. (1990). Ewing and
C and day
Struik (1992) stated that at higher temperatures (night temperatures above 20
C), stems are taller, because the internodes are longer and because
temperatures above 30
there are more sympodial branches. Furthermore, higher temperatures tend to enhance
the auxiliary branching at lower nodes.

(cid:2)

The optimum temperature for rate of stem elongation is above 25

C (Borah and
Milthorpe, 1962). Also stem dry matter production has a high optimum temperature, at
least considerably higher than leaf production, resulting in a decline in leaf: stem ratio
with an increase in temperature (Bodlaender, 1963; Wheeler et al., 1986; Ewing and
Struik, 1992).

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

18.3.7 Stem branching

One of the most significant effects of temperature on the shoot system is the effect on the
formation of basal lateral and apical branches. The shoot system is described in great detail
by Struik (Chapter 11, this volume). Here, we describe the effects of temperature on the
formation of branches. Table 18.4 illustrates the effect of temperature and photoperiod on
the total number of stem segments (i.e. main stems plus lateral stems) with inflorescences
(i.e. completed stem segments) for two cultivars. The effects of temperature on stems per
symposium are relatively small, but the effects on the number of stems per shoot are large,
especially for cv. Atzimba. Note the interactions between temperature and photoperiod
and between temperature and cultivar at the longer photoperiod.

18.4 STOLONS

Usually the potato cultivars grown in temperate regions do not require a strong induction
to produce stolons. The first stolons may already be produced shortly after or even
before emergence, although this depends on the physiological status of the seed tuber.
Stolon formation is usually enhanced by an increase in temperature over a wide range
of temperatures. Higher temperatures not only stimulate the development of stolons
(Bodlaender et al., 1964; Burt, 1964; Saha et al., 1974; Moorby and Milthorpe, 1975)
but also favour stolon branching, thus increasing the number of potential tuber sites both
per main stolon and per plant (Struik et al., 1989b,c). Very high temperatures, however,
may partly or even almost completely impede the stolon formation (Struik et al., 1989b).
Indeed, some reports indicate that high soil temperatures tend to reduce the number of
stolons or the stolon yield (Randeni, 1980; Lemaga, 1986). Midmore (1984) showed that
stolon development was delayed by higher temperature. However, the final stolon number
was increased by higher temperature, probably because tuber initiation was more delayed
than stolon initiation, thus allowing more time and providing more assimilates for further
stolon formation.

Table 18.5 summarizes the effects of two levels of temperature in the environments of
the shoot (air temperature), root (nutrient solution temperature) and stolons (temperature
of a separate stolon chamber) on number of stolons, stolon weight and the potential
number of tuber sites (tips of stolons or stolon branches). For stolon numbers, the effects

of increased temperatures in only one of the three compartments did not have a large effect
on cv. Bintje, although increased air temperature alone decreased the stolon number of cv.
Désirée. Combining high shoot temperature with a high root temperature had a detrimental
effect on stolon number of cv. Bintje, an effect further aggravated by an increase in
the stolon temperature. The weights of four selected stolons increased in response to an
increase in temperature in any environment for cv. Bintje. Only when an increase in air
temperature was combined with an increase in root temperature or stolon temperature (or
both), a severe reduction of stolon weight was observed. In cv. Désirée, an increase in air
temperature (alone but especially in combination with an increase in temperature in the
root or stolon compartments or with an increase in both) strongly reduced stolon weight.
A combination of high shoot and root temperatures (with its associated relatively high
normal temperature in the stolon chamber) reduced the dry weights of the four selected
stolons virtually to zero. In cv. Bintje, the number of potential tuber sites per plant was
increased by an increase in the temperature of the shoot, root or stolon environments. A
combination of high root and stolon temperatures however reduced the number of potential
tuber sites, especially when the stolon temperature was increased also. In cv. Désirée,
the control treatment (cool temperatures in all environments) gave the largest number of
potential tuber sites, with the largest detrimental effects of high air temperatures.

Note that in these experiments, the increase in stolon temperature was not independent

of the root temperature (Struik et al., 1989a).

Table 18.6 summarizes the stolon and tuber characteristics in a growth chamber exper-
iment with cv. Désirée associated with two levels of root temperature. Although the
number of tuber-bearing stolons was not affected over this range of root temperature, the
number of tubers per tuber-bearing stolon and thus the total number of tubers per plant
were higher for the higher root temperature. However, the total tuber yield was unaffected
by the root temperature treatments. The combined result of no effect on total yield and

an increase in tuber number was that the tubers were smaller in size. In this experiment,
a higher root temperature was probably associated with a higher stolon temperature.

18.5 TUBERS

The formation of tubers can be separated into different processes or steps, including tuber
induction, tuber initiation, tuber set, tuber bulking and tuber maturation. During tuber
induction, the plant translates the environmental and internal signals into a readiness to
form tubers, without any visible signs of tuberization yet. Tuber initiation is the process
underlying the first swelling of the stolon tips into tuber initials that may later grow out.
In fact, they are the visible signs that tuber induction has taken place, and therefore, tuber
induction and tuber initiation will be taken together in this contribution. During tuber
set, those tuber initials that will grow out into marketable sizes are determined, although
the actual number of tubers present may go down later during tuber bulking due to
resorption and decay. Tuber maturation is characterized by suberization and an increase in
dormancy. Temperature affects all these processes related to tuber formation. For many of
them, there is a strong interaction between temperature and other environmental factors,
especially photoperiod.

18.5.1 Tuber induction and tuber initiation

Photoperiod plays an important role in the induction and initiation of tuber formation in
the potato plant. The traditional potato species grown worldwide is a quantitative short-day
plant for this process, meaning that tuberization is faster when the photoperiod is shorter
than a critical value. Temperature modifies the response of potato to photoperiod (Ewing
and Struik, 1992; Struik and Ewing, 1995). Higher temperatures delay, impede or even
inhibit tuberization in comparison with lower temperatures (Wheeler et al., 1986; Snyder
and Ewing, 1989; Ewing and Struik, 1992; Jackson, 1999). In particular, night temperature
has a strong influence (also see Section 18.11). In particular, high air temperatures
impede induction and initiation. High soil temperatures do not prevent stolons from being

378

Struik

formed (often seen as the first step towards tuberization) but prevent stolons from forming
tubers (Ewing and Struik, 1992).

Kooman et al. (1996) reported that when temperatures increase to about 22

C, the
duration of the developmental phase from emergence to tuber initiation shortens. At
temperatures above that value, the development will be slower (Ewing and Struik, 1992).
As a consequence, high temperatures will prolong the period from emergence until tuber
initiation and will result in a larger plant when tuberization starts.

(cid:2)

Heat may completely impede tuber induction and the subsequent tuber formation.
There is an enormous genetic variation in the ability to express tuber formation under
heat (Ben Kheder and Ewing, 1985).

18.5.2 Tuber set

At the initial stages of tuberization, the balance of dry matter partitioning starts to
shift from the shoot to the tubers. At the early stages of this shift, tuber initiation is
most probably source regulated. Removal of tubers will enhance the tuberization of any
remaining stolon tips. Presence of tubers lacking the ability to synthesize starch (e.g. in
transgenic plants) will greatly increase the number of tuber initials. During tuber set,
tuber formation will gradually become more determined by sink regulation and sink–sink
competition. Struik et al. (1991) defined tuber set at the level of the individual tuber initial
as the final phase of the early tuber development after which the small tuber definitely has
the ability to produce a marketable tuber. Tuber set at the plant level may be defined as
the onset of rapid bulking and is completed when the maximum number of tubers growing
at a high rate is fixed. Beyond that moment, the number of tubers can still decline when
(changes in) conditions do not allow the support of all growing tubers. Internal factors
regulating tuber set and tuber size distribution have been extensively discussed by Struik
et al. (1990, 1991).

Thermal time functions for the onset and rates of tuber bulking have been developed
both for temperate regions (Jefferies and MacKerron, 1987; Spitters, 1990) and for
tropical conditions (Manrique and Hodges, 1989). However, these relations are strongly
cultivar-specific and are also affected by the photoperiod (Kooman and Haverkort, 1995).
Table 18.7 summarizes several parameters relating to the effect of temperature on tuber
set based on curve fitting using data from frequent harvesting. Tuber set expressed in days
C, but
after planting is delayed by higher temperatures, the effect being large above 23
C. The thermal time required to reach the onset

C) doubles when the average temperature
of tuber growth (OTG) (base temperature 0
C. Later during tuber growth, there is a shift from exponential to
increases from 23 to 27
linear tuber growth. Linear tuber growth starts about 16–28 days after OTG, depending
on temperature and cultivar. There is a caveat attaching to the data in Table 18.7: The
data are based on growth cabinet experiments, and so, the light intensity may have been
limiting at some temperatures.

Temperature may influence the competition among tuber initials and among tubers and

Ben Kheder and Ewing (1985) investigated the dry matter partitioning of a set of

18.5.5 Tuber yield

C for Russet Burbank and 18(cid:2)7

The tuber yield of potato is very sensitive to temperature. Table 18.7 summarizes that
the tuber yield decreased when average temperatures were increased in the range of
C. Yandell et al. (1988) indicated that the optimum temperatures for tuber yield
15–27
C for Norland. Other authors report higher
were 17(cid:2)5
C (Burton, 1981). Optimum
optimum temperatures or temperature ranges, for example 22
C (Yamaguchi et al.,
temperatures reported, however, usually lie in the range of 14–22
1964; Marinus and Bodlaender, 1975; Sands et al., 1979; Timlin et al., 2006), a range
that may be in agreement with the data reported in Table 18.7, although the lower end of
the temperature range is lacking in that data set.

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

Optimal temperature, however, is strongly dependent on the photoperiod (Wheeler
et al., 1986; Wheeler, 2006). This phenomenon is illustrated in Table 18.8. The optimum
(cid:2)
C under short day and 16
C under long day, but both were within
temperature was 20
(cid:2)
C given earlier. However, the value for optimum temperature under
the range of 14–22
a 12-h photoperiod is not consistent with the results in Table 18.7. There are interactions
between not only temperature and photoperiod (Table 18.8) but also these and cultivar
(and, possibly, irradiance) (Table 18.7 vs. Table 18.8). Menzel (1985) stated that tuber
yield is also determined by a balance between temperature and irradiance.

(cid:2)

18.5.6 Tuber number

Given the effects of temperature on the structure of the stolon system, and thus on the
number of potential sites for tuberization, and given the effect of temperature on the
size of the shoot system at first tuber initiation, tuber number may be enhanced by an

increase in temperature even though tuber growth may be slowed down. Indeed, Borah
and Milthorpe (1962) and Struik et al. (1989b,c) reported more tubers being formed at
higher temperatures. Lafta and Lorenzen (1995), however, observed that high temperatures
caused fewer tubers to be formed. Other reports indicate a low optimum temperature for
number of tubers, especially under long days (Wheeler et al., 1986) and strong interactions
between genotype and temperature (Van Dam et al., 1996). Some of the discrepancies
may be associated with the definition of a tuber, that is the minimum size at which a
swelling is still considered a tuber.

(cid:2)

Table 18.7 provides some data on the effect of temperature on the number of tubers per
plant. In cv. Spunta, at 23
C and below, there was no effect of temperature on number
of tubers. In cv. Désirée, there was an increase in number of tubers with an increase in
temperatures within the range 15–23
C, consistent with the prolonged stolon formation
and enhanced stolon branching associated with the higher temperatures.

(cid:2)

18.5.7 Tuber size distribution

Tuber size distribution is determined by the yield, the number of tubers and the relative
variation in tuber size. High temperatures increase the within-plant variation in time of
tuber initiation and in the rate and duration of tuber growth. In addition to the effects on
tuber number, average tuber weight and tuber yield as discussed earlier, temperature may
therefore have a large but complex effect on tuber size distribution.

18.5.8 Tuber quality

High temperatures cause an increase in abnormal tuber behaviour. Frequency and extent
of knobbiness, chain-tuber formation and secondary growth and frequency of growth
cracks, heat sprouts, heat necrosis and translucent ends are all increased by an increase
in temperature (Lugt, 1960; Bodlaender et al., 1964; Lugt et al., 1964; Marinus and
Bodlaender, 1975; Ben Kheder and Ewing, 1985; Hiller et al., 1985; Smith, 1987; Burton,
1989; Struik et al., 1989c; Van den Berg et al., 1989; Ewing and Struik, 1992; Ewing and
Sandlan, 1995). The most important effects, however, are the reduction in starch content
and the increase in sucrose content in tubers produced under high temperatures (Krauss and
Marschner, 1984). Associated with this effect, the dry matter concentration of the tubers
is also very low at high temperatures (Haynes et al., 1988; Van den Berg et al., 1989).

18.5.9 Tuber enzyme activity

The carbohydrate metabolism in potato tubers responds strongly to low temperature
because of the cold-induced sweetening phenomenon (Kruger et al., 2003; Malone et al.,
2006). This phenomenon is caused by a conversion of starch into sugars at low tem-
peratures above freezing. The mechanism is not clear, especially given the commonly
accepted theory that the cold lability of enzymes catalysing the conversion of fructose
6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-biphosphate is not a major factor in cold-induced sweeten-
ing in plants. Sugar accumulation in cold-stored tubers is not a direct consequence of a
constraint in carbohydrate oxidation (Malone et al., 2006). Supra-optimal conditions for

382

Struik

starch synthesis are also frequent in potato production, and such conditions may cause
low dry matter concentration and thus poor tuber quality.

(cid:2)

Wolf et al. (1991) observed that high temperatures reduced the incorporation of 14C
into starch but increased the amount of labelled sucrose. Obviously, temperature affects
the carbon metabolism in different plant organs, and as a result, there is a change in
the partitioning of assimilates (Wolf et al., 1990). Also within tubers, supra-optimal
temperatures affect the carbohydrate metabolism. Mohabir and John (1988) observed a
sharp temperature optimum for 14C sucrose incorporation into starch. The optimum was
C. This means that there is a relatively low temperature optimum for starch synthesis.
21(cid:2)5
It also means that the sink strength of tubers is already decreased at relatively low soil
temperatures. This sharp optimum is also in agreement with the optimum temperature of
C. Mohabir and John, however, assessed
tuber growth under adequate light of about 22
the optimum temperature by measuring carbohydrate metabolism in tuber slices. Their
results are in contrast with the findings of Frydman and Cardini (1966) and Kennedy and
Isherwood (1975) who observed temperature optima for adenosine diphosphate glucose
C. Geigenberger et al. (1998)
(ADPG) pyrophosphorylase and starch synthase above 35
C, higher than the
showed that the optimum temperature for starch synthesis was 25
optimum temperature for tuber growth. At elevated temperature levels, hexose-phosphate
levels were increased, and the levels of glycerate-3-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate
were decreased. They suggested that elevated temperatures result in increased rates of
respiration, and the resulting decline of glycerate-3-phosphate then inhibits the ADPG
pyrophosphorylase and starch synthesis.

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

Lafta and Lorenzen (1995) reported enzyme activities in potato tubers after exposure
C
to a heat treatment imposed 10 days after tuber initiation. The heat treatment (29/27
C) showed much lower activities of sucrose synthase
compared with the control 19/17
after 2 weeks of heat. A smaller but still significant reduction was observed for ADPG
Pyrophosphorylase, but no effect was observed for uridine diphosphate pyrophosphory-
lase. Effects after 3 days of treatment were not statistically significant.

18.6 INFLORESCENCES AND FLOWERS

Potato (Solanum tuberosum spp. tuberosum) is a quantitative short-day plant for tuber-
ization and also for flowering (Almekinders and Struik, 1996). However, the effect of
temperature on flowering seems stronger for the lateral branches than for the main stem.
Table 18.9 summarizes the thermal time (in K days) from planting until flowering of
the primary inflorescence (i.e. the inflorescence of the main stem) and of three types of
secondary inflorescence. The average effect of photoperiod on the timing of flowering is
rather small, with a delay in flowering in long days compared with short days. Secondary
stems need more thermal time to produce flowers than the main stem, and the effect of
photoperiod is strongest for the apical lateral branches. Under higher temperatures, the
several types of stem segments require more thermal time than under lower temperatures.
The effect of lengthened photoperiod on time of flowering is very slightly greater at
higher temperature than at lower temperature. The temperature effect is slightly larger at
long days than at short days.

The effects of temperature on the number of flowers per individual inflorescence are
illustrated in Table 18.10. More flowers are produced at a longer photoperiod than at
a shorter photoperiod and at a higher temperature than at a lower temperature on the
primary inflorescence and the apical secondary inflorescences. For the lower secondary
inflorescence, there was an interaction between temperature and photoperiod, and the
higher temperature gave fewer flowers than the lower temperature.

The effects of temperature on number of flowers of the entire shoot are complex
(Table 18.10). Temperature has a significant effect on the basal and apical branching
and on the dry matter partitioning over shoot and tubers. Therefore, temperature affects

the potential number of inflorescences. Furthermore, more flowers may be initiated per
inflorescence, and flower bud abortion may be reduced by an increase in temperature
within a certain temperature range. The overall effect of temperature on the number of
flowers of the entire shoot is also summarized in Table 18.10. Both long days and high
temperatures increase the number of flowers per shoot.

18.7 ROOT SYSTEM

(cid:2)

If the temperature of the root zone is varied, but air temperature is kept constant at 20
C,
root growth has a distinct temperature optimum of 15–20
C (Sattelmacher et al., 1990a).
This agrees with findings of Saha et al. (1974): raising night temperatures from 0 to 20
C
increases root length. Higher temperatures, however, may strongly reduce or even inhibit
root growth (Sattelmacher et al., 1990a) and root activity (Sattelmacher et al., 1990b).
Root diameter and root hair formation, however, are enhanced by heat (Sattelmacher et al.,
1990a). Root respiration is not severely affected by heat (Sattelmacher et al., 1990b).
There is a negative relation between plant age and heat susceptibility of the roots, because
of a decrease of the shoot: root ratio with age (Sattelmacher and Marschner 1990).

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

Supra-optimal temperatures in the root zone also limit the allocation of assimilates to
the roots, especially in heat-sensitive cultivars (Sattelmacher et al., 1990b). This reduces
root activity such as the export of nitrogen to the shoot.

18.8 PHOTOSYNTHESIS, DRY MATTER PRODUCTION AND DRY

MATTER PARTITIONING

Leaf photosynthesis has an optimum temperature of about 24
C (Ku et al., 1977). It
rapidly decreases with an increase in temperature beyond that optimum (Leach et al.,
1982; Wolf et al., 1990). Prange et al. (1990) stated that this temperature effect was
mainly caused by a reduced efficiency of photosystem II.

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

Dwelle et al. (1981) found the optimum temperature of gross photosynthesis to be
in the range of 24–30
C. However, the optimum temperature for net photosynthesis is
(cid:2)
lower, not more than 25
C (Winkler, 1971; Ku et al., 1977; Dwelle et al., 1981). Recent
literature (Timlin et al., 2006) presents a more detailed view. Whole plant (canopy)
photosynthesis showed no temperature effect during very early stages of plant growth
(up to 12–14 days after emergence). Thereafter, 31 days after emergence, an optimum
temperature was detectable at 24
C, partly associated with a larger leaf area because of
more (but smaller) leaves at higher temperatures. The optimum temperature for canopy
photosynthesis appeared to be 24
C for most of the growing period. The rate of photo-
synthesis at 24
C declined during the growing period but remained more or less constant
for lower temperatures. In mature leaves, a temperature increase reduces photosynthesis.
Therefore, the optimum temperature shifted to 16–20
C later during the growth period.
Total end-of-season biomass had an optimum temperature of 20
C. Tuber yields and
harvest index declined when temperatures increased above 24

C (Timlin et al., 2006).

Responses to temperature

385

A low photosynthetic rate at very high temperatures was the result of accelerated
senescence, chlorophyll loss, reduced stomatal conductance, inhibition of dark reactions at
high temperature (Reynolds et al., 1990) and also damage to photosystems and poorer sink–
source relations. The photosynthesis system of potato seems to have a high adaptive capacity
to high temperatures but not to very high temperatures. Photosynthesis is higher following
tuber initiation than before (Moll and Henninger, 1978; Lorenzen and Ewing, 1990).

The rate of net photosynthesis has a relatively low optimum temperature, but leaf area
duration is not reduced until much higher temperatures. At intermediate temperatures, the
size of the aerial shoot may be much larger than that at cool temperatures. Even though there
may be a positive effect of high temperature on the size of the shoot, this does not contribute
to additional dry matter production as the leaf: stem ratio is reduced and the partitioning to
the tubers is delayed and impeded at high temperatures compared with low temperatures
(see Section 18.5.4). High temperatures will therefore reduce total dry matter production.

High temperatures also result in delayed and impeded tuberization and so in a later
and lower production of sinks. This in itself may directly affect the photosynthetic rate
later during the growth period (Prange et al., 1990). This inference is supported by the
findings of Lafta and Lorenzen (1995) who observed that high temperatures caused fewer
tubers to be formed, thus causing a reduction in sink size and in photosynthesis.

Even when the rate of dry matter production is sufficient and an adequate number
of tubers are formed, tuber yield is much reduced by heat, because of the effect of air
temperature on dry matter partitioning (Struik et al., 1989c). Even when only the tuber
temperature is increased, tuber growth can be reduced through a reduction in the activity
of the starch synthesizing enzymes (see Section 18.9).

18.9 PARTIAL EXPOSURE

Earlier in the text, frequent reference was made to the effects of partial exposure to certain
temperature treatments. In this section, we therefore restrict the discussion to the effects
of exposing different parts of the plant to certain temperature treatments on tuber growth
and bulking.

Tuber initiation is sensitive to temperature in different plant organs. Growing plants at
high temperatures gives poor tuberization in cuttings taken from these plants, independent
of soil temperature during subsequent plant growth (Reynolds and Ewing, 1989). Exposing
below-ground plant parts to high temperatures also inhibits tuber formation. Cuttings
taken from similar plants when air temperatures are low may tuberize, even if soil
temperatures are high, and there are no other tubers on the plant. Intact plants will not
tuberize when stolons are exposed to high temperatures because the expression of the
signal to tuberize is blocked (Reynolds and Ewing, 1989). Menzel (1983) however stated
that exposing plants to high soil temperatures causes about the same reduction in tuber
yield as increasing air temperature.

As described earlier in Section 18.4 and in Table 18.5, Struik et al. (1989a–c) varied

smaller than the differences in temperature in the other compartments and not entirely
independent of the root temperatures. The results indicated that high root and stolon
temperatures may enhance the number of stolons, yet inhibit their diageotropic growth
(data not shown), whereas high shoot and stolon temperatures may constrain stolon
growth. Earliness of tuberization was particularly affected by shoot temperature, although
the expression could be inhibited by a combination of high root and stolon temperatures
(data not shown). Numbers of tubers, including very small ones, were much higher when
stolon temperatures were high (data not shown), but tuber yields were reduced by a
temperature increase in any compartment (Table 18.11). Second growth was enhanced by
a high temperature in any compartment, but an increase in the stolon compartment was
particularly effective (data not shown). Dry matter partitioning was mainly influenced by
air temperature (data not shown).

Exposing a single tuber to high or low temperatures affects its growth but also the
growth of the other tubers. Engels (1983) showed that cooling of a single tuber reduces its
growth rate but increased the growth rate of other tubers. Krauss and Marschner (1984)
showed that heating single tubers to 30
C for 6 days reduced tuber growth and could
finally result in a complete halt of the growth of that tuber. It also resulted in a faster
growth of the other tubers or even in the initiation of bulking at other tuber sites.

18.10 EFFECTS OF SHORT PERIODS OF CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE

The complex nature of the yield formation in the potato crop and the fact that different
plant processes show different sensitivities to temperature have consequences for the
effects of the timing of a short period of high temperatures. Warm temperatures early
during the growth followed by cool temperatures later during growth give better tuber-
ization than the reverse treatment (Cao and Tibbitts, 1994). Tibbitts et al. (1984) showed
that warm temperatures during the first weeks of growth, that is before tuber initiation,

Responses to temperature

387

followed by cooler temperatures increased tuber yield compared with maintaining the
cool temperatures during the entire growth period. This effect was probably caused by
the larger plant size after warmer growth. Delaying the warm period to later phases of
growth, however, reduced tuber yield, whereas delaying a short cool period from early
growth until after the onset of tuber bulking greatly increased tuber yield.

Burt (1964) could advance tuber initiation by a 1-week period of low temperatures in

the range of 3–9

C.

(cid:2)

Mild or short increases in temperature may enhance the number of tubers per stem,
because of positive effects on the number of stolons, the rate and duration of longitudinal
stolon growth – thus increasing the number of potential tuber sites –, the number of
tubers per tuber-bearing stolon and on second growth. Under those temporary warm
conditions, the period of tuber formation will be prolonged, resulting in larger variation
in the initiation date of the individual tubers from one stem. Tuberization will also be
delayed resulting in a larger canopy and a lower harvest index. The effects of a short
period of heat on number of tubers, tuber yield and average tuber weight of cv. Désirée
are summarized in Table 18.12. Short periods of temperature increases (from 20/15 to
32/27
C for 1 week) usually increased tuber number, but especially so when these short
periods were applied during or shortly after tuber set. These changes in tuber number were
related to changes in shoot growth. When Désirée plants were exposed to heat during
tuber set or during initial tuber growth, there were both lower dry matter production and

unpublished data). However, in a different set of experiments, we observed only minor
effects of the timing of the heat on the yield and the number of tubers in cv. Bintje.

18.11 DIURNAL TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS

Providing a thermoperiod (i.e. diurnal fluctuations) may improve tuberization (Steward
et al., 1981; Tibbitts et al., 1990; Bennett et al., 1991; Cao and Tibbitts, 1992). Night
temperature is particularly important for tuberization (Slater, 1968). However, diurnal
fluctuations are only beneficial for tuber initiation in certain cultivars (Steward et al.,
1981; Bennett et al., 1991). Moreover, Bennett et al. (1991) also showed that diur-
nal fluctuations provide better growth and yield of tubers in some cultivars but not in
others.

18.12 PHYSIOLOGICAL BEHAVIOUR OF SEED TUBERS

Temperature during seed tuber bulking has a small and cultivar-dependent effect on the
physiological behaviour of the harvested seed tubers (Van Ittersum and Scholte, 1992a).
Van Ittersum and Scholte (1992a) showed that even temperature fluctuation during the day
was relevant: seed lots exposed to the same average temperature during their production,
but with different diurnal patterns, gave different physiological behaviour of the seed
tubers. The specific effects, however, depended on cultivar.

As long as tubers remain attached to the haulm, the effects of higher tempera-
tures seem to be reduced by a dampening effect of the shoot. Once the tubers are
detached (after haulm killing), there is a much larger effect of an increase in temperature;
whether the tubers are still in the soil or already in store. Nevertheless, the number of
sprouts produced shortly after the breaking of dormancy is larger when the tubers are
grown under high temperatures. Such effects may disappear during the later stages of
storage.

There is abundant information on the effects of temperature during storage and phys-
iological ageing. For reviews, see Van der Zaag and van Loon (1987) and Struik and
Wiersema (1999).

Dormancy can be shortened by warm storage (Struik et al., 2006) but also by a short
treatment of heat (Van Ittersum, 1992) or in some cultivars also by a short treatment of
cold storage (Van Ittersum and Scholte, 1992b). Optimum temperatures for dormancy
break and sprout growth differ: the optimum temperature is higher for dormancy break
than for sprout growth. Table 18.13 provides a classical example of the effects of storage
temperatures on the duration of dormancy of seed tubers from several cultivars pro-
duced in 2 years. With an increase in storage temperature, the breaking of dormancy is
faster.

Storage temperature also affects sprout growth on tubers that are no longer

et al., 1983).

There is usually a close relation between thermal time from tuber initiation to use and
the performance of the tuber. However, Struik et al. (2006) showed that the sensitivity to
temperature may differ for the various stages of physiological development of the seed

tuber. Similar thermal times differing in the timing of a short period of high temperatures
result in different seed performance. A higher temperature after the end of dormancy
advanced and accelerated the process of ageing of seed tubers, especially in certain
cultivars sensitive to rapid ageing. Resulting differences in seed performance may be
extreme, in terms of stem numbers emerged, tuber numbers produced and in yield and
tuber size distribution (Struik et al., 2006). Table 18.14 summarizes some relevant results.
The table summarizes that the relative yields in both the laboratory test and the field test
were lower with an increase in thermal time for seed lots exposed to constant storage
temperatures. When storage temperature was varied, the treatments with periods of storage
C all performed better in the laboratory test than the seed tubers stored
at both 4 and 20

18.13 SUMMARY

Table 18.15 summarizes the optimal temperatures for various processes described in
this chapter. The table summarizes that for the initial growth, optimum temperatures
are rather low. For the creation of many leaves (leaf primordial development and leaf
appearance rate), the optimum temperatures are rather high, but they are significantly
lower for individual leaf growth and canopy development. Stem elongation, stem growth
and flowering, however, have much higher optimal temperatures. Production is maximal
at temperatures even below the best temperatures for leaf area development. The early
processes in tuberization have rather high optimal temperatures, but the tuber formation
processes themselves have low optima.

19.1 INTRODUCTION

Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is of major importance for human nutrition in many parts
of the world. At the end of the twentieth century, the area cropped with potato decreased
slightly in Western Europe, but remained fairly stable in Asian countries and increased
considerably in developing countries with exception of South America (Beukema and
Van der Zaag, 1990). In the future, potato is likely to become increasingly important for
human nutrition as the ratio of edible to non-edible components [harvest index (HI)] is
much greater than in wheat, rice and maize and because of the high potential for increased
production in Europe and especially in developing countries.

−1 and is expected to reach 540–970 (cid:2)l l

Potato production will be influenced by future climatic changes. The European climate
of the twenty-first century is likely to change, resulting in warmer summers, wetter
winters and more variable patterns of rainfall and temperature. The major cause of this
climate change is the increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The ambient
−1 in pre-industrial times to current levels of
concentration has increased from 280 (cid:2)l l
−1 by the end of the twenty-first
about 370 (cid:2)l l
century if emissions continue at current rates (IPCC, 2001). These changes will affect
the growth, development and yield of most important agronomic crops including potato.
Positive effects of elevated CO2 on the growth and yield of plants have been observed
over many decades, and during this time, hundreds of experiments, under laboratory or
controlled environmental conditions, have shown that crop yields are generally enhanced
by elevated CO2 (Kimball, 1983). However, studies so far have shown that the increases
in yield achievable under elevated CO2 are highly species-dependent (Kimball, 1983).
This is not surprising as it is well documented that carbon flux to yield components is a
whole-plant property, which depends on the co-ordination between the activity of source
organs, transport and sink activity (Farrar, 1996). It has been shown that elevated CO2
enhances photosynthetic rates in the leaves of almost all C3 species that are well supplied
with nutrients (Long and Drake, 1992). Transport capacity and the presence of small or
large sinks for assimilates may promote or impair the capacity of the plant to invest the
extra carbon fixed under elevated CO2 into more structural growth or long-term survival
storage (Schnyder and Baum, 1992; Körner and Miglietta, 1994).

De Temmerman et al.

Experiments with potato in Italy and Germany (Miglietta et al., 1998; Craigon et al.,
2002) have shown that such positive CO2 effects occur when crops are grown in the
field under realistic conditions in free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) systems,
in the absence of modifications caused by artificial enclosures. The positive effect of
CO2 on the yield of potato has recently been confirmed in a series of open-top field
chamber (OTC) and FACE experiments in different countries during the European CHIP
(Changing climate and potential impacts on potato yield and quality) project (Craigon
et al., 2002; De Temmerman et al., 2002a). The results suggest that the expected increases
in CO2 concentration may enhance agricultural production in at least some areas of the
world, although it must be emphasized that changes in other climatic factors have the
potential to offset such a beneficial effect (Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994).

In this review, we report the effects of CO2 on potato phenology, physiology and yield.
We explain how the effects are caused, their interactions with other variables and how
the acquired information can be integrated in predictive models.

19.2 EFFECTS OF INCREASED CO2 ON CROP GROWTH AND

DEVELOPMENT

Commonly reported responses of several plant species to a CO2 doubling are earlier
flowering, increased leaf area, specific leaf weight, canopy density and plant height, as
well as accelerated crop maturation rate (Krupa and Kickert, 1993) and senescence that
causes a shortened growth period (Manning and Tiedemann, 1995). Although it is diffi-
cult to distinguish any statistically significant changes in phenological development rate
(Hacour et al., 2002), some changes have also been reported in potato. Crop phenological
development was found to be advanced by elevated CO2 in the two consecutive years
of OTC experiments carried out in Belgium as part of the CHIP project (Hacour et al.,
1998, 2000). Miglietta et al. (1998) observed that the date of flowering of potato plants
(cultivar Primura) was progressively advanced by increasing CO2 concentrations (460,
560 and 660 (cid:2)l l

−1(cid:3) compared to ambient air.

To clarify the impact of elevated CO2 on the rate of crop growth and development, it
is essential to make a distinction between the three main developmental stages: canopy
expansion, during which tuber initiation (TI) occurs; full canopy, when maximum leaf area
(MLA) is attained and the senescence phase when leaf area and chlorophyll concentration
begin to decline. Although there was no indication of any changes in leaf area or leaf
formation during initial growth and full canopy, the average number of green leaves was
significantly reduced by elevated CO2 during crop senescence. Owing to an earlier leaf
shed, elevated CO2 caused a more rapid decline of the leaf area index (LAI, leaf area per
unit ground area) after MLA had been reached (Hacour et al., 2002). Interestingly, halfway
through the growing season, at MLA, Lawson et al. (2001a) found an increase in green
−1 CO2, but a decrease at
leaf number and LAI when plants had been growing at 550 (cid:2)l l
−1. This may be a consequence of the fact that the highest concentration induced
680 (cid:4)l l
a more serious temporal shift in crop development. Kimball et al. (2002) reported that
in four of five FACE experiments with potato, elevated CO2 caused a decrease in peak
LAI (Bindi et al., 1998, 2000; Miglietta et al., 1998). Leaf area index peaked earlier

Response to the environment: carbon dioxide

397

and already started to decline, whereas at ambient CO2, it continued to rise for another
couple of weeks. Plant height and the number of leaves were not significantly affected in
the FACE experiments of Miglietta et al. (1998). Earlier decline of LAI, as well as the
decrease of final plant height (Donnelly et al., 2001; Hacour et al., 2002; Persson et al.,
2003), indicated a premature ending of active vegetative, aboveground growth followed
by an earlier senescence. Accelerated leaf senescence has also been reported for other
crops and considered to be an effect of increased canopy temperature due to stomatal
closure (Kimball et al., 1995; Miglietta et al., 1998; Vaccari et al., 2001).

Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area per leaf mass) determines how much new leaf
area to deploy for each unit of biomass produced. Under elevated CO2, any storage of
the extra carbohydrate in the leaves, or any reallocation of biomass to thicker leaves,
would tend to increase leaf mass more than leaf area, thereby decreasing SLA (Kimball
et al., 2002). Potato showed a fairly consistent reduction in SLA due to elevated CO2
(Bindi et al., 1998, 2000; Miglietta et al., 1998; Schapendonk et al., 2000; Vaccari et al.,
2001). Most probably, a decrease of SLA has also been the cause of a slight stimulation
of aboveground dry biomass at MLA during the CHIP experiments, despite the height
decrease and absence of any significant changes in leaf number and LAI (Donnelly et al.,
2001; Hacour et al., 2002). Lawson et al. (2002) did indeed report an increase in leaf
thickness and also in leaf area. The extra photosynthate, produced by an initial stimulation
of CO2 assimilation, is not used primarily to create a larger leaf area (thereby increasing
light interception) but seems to be used in the development of thicker leaves, possibly by
the accumulation of starch in the chloroplasts (Schapendonk et al., 2000).

A detailed assessment of the number of leaves, LAI and plant height, in combination
with intermediate biomass measurements during the European CHIP experiments, made
it clear that the influence of elevated CO2 concentrations on plant growth was very
dependent on the developmental stage of the crops. On the whole, elevated CO2 induces an
increase in growth rate that will lead to a biomass increase at full canopy, but at the same
time, the active growing period is reduced, and there is an earlier onset of senescence that
counteracts final biomass accumulation. The balance between these processes and changes
in assimilate partitioning (influenced, e.g., by source–sink imbalance) is responsible for
the final yield response.

19.3 EFFECTS OF INCREASED CO2 ON POTATO PHYSIOLOGY

The effect of increased CO2 on crop productivity is mediated through its interaction with
photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, assimilate partitioning and plant or leaf senescence.
A plant’s photosynthetic performance is determined by chlorophyll concentration, effi-
ciency of the photosystems (light reactions), stomatal regulation of CO2 uptake and the
actual CO2 incorporation through the Calvin cycle (dark reactions). (A detailed descrip-
tion of photosynthesis and related carbohydrate metabolism is given in Chapter 13, Hofius
and Börnke, this volume). Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)
plays an essential regulatory role in the plant’s CO2 response because it is the entry
point for inorganic C into the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle. It is a bifunctional
enzyme, and atmospheric O2 is a competitive inhibitor with respect to CO2 as a substrate

398

De Temmerman et al.

(cid:2)

for the mono-oxygenase activity of Rubisco to produce phosphoglycolate, which is par-
tially metabolized to CO2 in the photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycle (Bowes, 1991).
Through O2 inhibition and photorespiration, the present atmospheric CO2/O2 ratio causes
a 35% reduction of the maximum photosynthetic capacity of C3 plants at 25
C, and higher
temperatures amplify this inhibition. Owing to competitive interaction, as CO2 rises, it
will diminish the inhibitory effects of O2, a doubling of the present CO2 concentration
would more than halve photorespiration (Bowes, 1996). However, this enhancement of
photosynthetic efficiency is mostly not maintained during long-term growth at elevated
CO2 (Allen, 1990; Long, 1994). A doubling of atmospheric CO2 often induces an initial
increase in net photosynthesis of approximately 50% in C3 species, followed by a decline
to approximately 30% (Cure and Acock, 1986). This so-called photosynthetic acclimation
is a common response to CO2 enrichment (Sage et al., 1989; Barnes et al., 1995; Stirling
et al., 1997) and has been defined as the difference in photosynthetic rates for ambient
and elevated CO2-grown plants when measured at the same CO2 partial pressure (Long,
1991). A further increase of the ambient CO2 concentration has also been reported to
reduce stomatal conductance, enhance water use efficiency (WUE), increase C/N ratio
and lower dark respiration. The impact on each of these processes is dependent on the
plant and leaf developmental stage that may in turn interact with CO2, increasing the com-
plexity of predicting plant growth and performance in response to future global changes
(Besford et al., 1990; Miller et al., 1997; Osborne et al., 1998; Backhausen and Sheibe,
1999; Adam et al., 2000; Kalina et al., 2001; Marek et al., 2001).

Despite the obvious agronomic importance of potato, only a limited number of studies
deal with the effects of elevated CO2 on the photosynthetic properties of this plant.
Most of these studies do confirm an initial stimulation of CO2 assimilation, followed
by a steady decrease to the level of photosynthetic performance comparable to that
at ambient CO2 concentrations. So despite the indeterminate growth pattern of potato
with its large sink capacity, acclimation still occurs, and a simulation model indicated
that this phenomenon reduced the positive effect of elevated CO2 on tuber yield by
50% (Schapendonk et al., 2000). Vandermeiren et al. (2002) reported that a season-long
−1 CO2 resulted in an initial increase
exposure of S. tuberosum cultivar Bintje to 680 (cid:2)l l
of light-saturated photosynthesis (cid:5)Asat(cid:3) of the fully expanded upper canopy leaves by 40%
at the time of TI. A 30-day exposure of high- and low-altitude potato species, Solanum
−1 CO2 from TI onwards induced
curtilobum and S. tuberosum, respectively, to 720 (cid:2)l l
an average increase in net photosynthesis of 56 and 53% (Olivo et al., 2002). Increases
up to 80% have been established in cultivars Gloria and Elles (Schapendonk et al., 2000).
Photosynthetic acclimation may set in from the early start of crop growth (TI), and Asat
is steadily reduced to that at the ambient CO2 level as the crop reaches maturity. The
acclimation mostly coincides with a parallel decline in stomatal conductance (Sicher and
Bunce, 1999; Bunce, 2001; Donnelly et al., 2001; Finnan et al., 2002; Vandermeiren et al.,
2002; Heagle et al., 2003), resulting primarily from reductions in stomatal aperture rather
than stomatal number (Lawson et al., 2002). An increase in CO2 assimilation combined
with a relative decrease of stomatal transpiration leads to a higher WUE. Olivo et al.
(2002) did indeed report an increase in instantaneous transpiration efficiency of 80% in
S. tuberosum and 90% in S. curtilobum. Such an effect may have important beneficial
implications for crop production under future climatic conditions, which are expected

Response to the environment: carbon dioxide

The decrease in net assimilation of the upper leaves was more rapid at 680 (cid:2)l l

to be warmer and drier with increased atmospheric CO2 concentration. On the other
hand, the stomatal closure may increase leaf temperature which can cause a shift in leaf
ontogeny and crop senescence. An increase of the non-photorespiratory mitochondrial
respiration (cid:5)Rd(cid:3) after the crop reaches MLA may be considered as an increased demand
to support maintenance processes resulting from this earlier senescence (Vandermeiren
et al., 2002).
−1 CO2
−1 CO2 (Lawson et al., 2001b), but the acclimation response was
in comparison to 550 (cid:2)l l
not found for older shaded leaves farther down the canopy, demonstrating the existence
of compensatory flexibility whereby the older leaves may further support tuber growth
(Lawson et al., 2001b; Vandermeiren, 2003). Sage et al. (1989) and Ludewig et al.
(1998) reported little or no photosynthetic acclimation of S. tuberosum under greenhouse
or controlled environmental conditions, but the authors do not provide any details on
the leaf position and/or plant age. In comparison to ambient conditions, the maximum
carboxylation rate of Rubisco (cid:5)Vc(cid:6)max(cid:3) and light-saturated rate of electron transport (cid:5)Jmax(cid:3)
are reduced at a similar rate during the early stages of the season. So the decrease in
Rubisco activity is related to a comparable reduction in ribulose-1.5-biphosphate (RuBP)
regeneration by a decreased rate of non-cyclic electron transport. These observations
suggest that Rubisco activity and/or amount may be important in determining maximum
photosynthetic capacity under elevated CO2 and that adjustment in the quantity or activity
of Rubisco is involved in acclimation (Donnelly et al., 2001; Lawson et al., 2001b;
Vandermeiren et al., 2002). Sicher and Bunce (1999) did not find changes in Rubisco
concentration during acclimation, but they proposed that the decrease in Rubisco activity
was potentially due to the presence of inhibitory compounds bound to the active site of
the enzyme. Vaccari et al. (2001) did not find any changes in Vc(cid:6)max and Jmax of potato
cultivar Primura during early growth, although elevated CO2 did finally lead to a faster
decrease in photosynthetic capacity of the leaves. The photosynthetic acclimation is mostly
accompanied by a higher carbohydrate concentration in the leaves (Schapendonk et al.,
1995, 2000; Miglietta et al., 1998; Sicher and Bunce, 2001; Vaccari et al., 2001), decrease
in nitrogen concentration (Ludewig et al., 1998; Sicher and Bunce, 2001; Fangmeier
et al., 2002) and lower levels of soluble proteins (Kauder et al., 2000), especially Rubisco
(Sicher and Bunce, 2001).

A frequently proposed explanation for this photosynthetic acclimation is that CO2
enrichment causes an imbalance between source and sink capacity, particularly when
sink capacity is insufficient to cope with the additional carbohydrates produced (Farrar
and Williams, 1991; Stitt, 1991). Schapendonk et al. (2000) reported that photosynthetic
acclimation in potato was indeed accompanied by a reduced Rubisco concentration and
was more correlated with the accumulation of sucrose than of starch. The surplus carbohy-
drates produced, which cannot be transported and metabolized in sink tissues, would lead
to a feedback accumulation in source leaves and reduce the expression of photosynthetic
genes by a mechanism involving sugar sensing. Several studies argue against the role
of sugar accumulation itself for the reduction of Rubisco concentration and photosyn-
thetic down-regulation because leaf starch synthesis functions as an efficient buffer for
photoassimilates (Ludewig et al., 1998; Heineke et al., 1999). Potato leaves have a large
capacity for starch synthesis to transiently store most of the carbon assimilated during the

400

De Temmerman et al.

light period in the chloroplast (Heineke et al., 1994; Casanova, 2003), although this may
not be sufficient under very high CO2 concentrations (Kauder et al., 2000). In the dark
period, starch is degraded and possibly exported by a hexose transporter (Schäfer et al.,
1977). Large starch granules may however also cause chloroplast deformation (Cave
et al., 1981). Potato also features very large sink organs for carbohydrates and uses an
apoplastic mechanism for phloem loading based on a sucrose transporter (Riesmeier et al.,
1994), all of which are important prerequisites for a large CO2 response. Insufficient sink
strength of the tuber can even be compensated for by stimulated growth of other sinks,
i.e. the shoot (Zrenner et al., 1995).

Photosynthetic acclimation and associated metabolic changes have, on the other hand,
also been related to an accelerated development and earlier senescence (Heineke et al.,
1999; Kauder et al., 2000; Vaccari et al., 2001). In tobacco, Miller et al. (1997) observed
that during acclimation, lower photosynthetic rates appear to be the result of a shift of
the normal photosynthetic stages of leaf ontogeny to an earlier onset of natural decline
associated with senescence. A similar conclusion was put forward with regard to tomato
(Besford et al., 1990). This implies that the reduction in the Rubisco concentration and/or
activity possibly reflects the developmental stage of the investigated leaves rather than
the environmental conditions. A more rapid decrease of the leaf chlorophyll concentration
confirms this hypothesis for potato (Lawson et al., 2001b; Bindi et al., 2002). In senescing
leaves, a marked decrease of protein-containing components can be seen as the result of
nutrient remobilization (Kolbe and Stephan-Beckmann, 1997). An earlier onset of such a
reassignment caused by a prolonged exposure to elevated CO2 would explain the more
rapid decline in Rubisco content/concentration/activity after MLA. It has been argued,
however, that the Rubisco concentration in general remains in excess of that required
to support the measured photosynthetic rates, also at elevated CO2, and that acclimation
would be caused by other limiting factors such as the regeneration of orthophosphate in
the chloroplasts (Sage et al., 1989). It has also been suggested that under elevated CO2,
earlier leaf senescence may be induced by nitrogen limitation (Nie et al., 1995; Stitt and
Krapp, 1999).

On the basis of the present literature, it is clear that acclimation and senescence are
difficult to separate. They are both regulated by ontogenetic and environmental factors,
and it is often impossible to distinguish cause and consequence in these discussions.

19.4 EFFECTS OF INCREASED CO2 ON YIELD AND QUALITY

Doubling of the ambient CO2 level results in tuber yield (dry matter) increases ranging
from 0 to 60% (Table 19.1). A negative value is ignored here but will be discussed in
Section 19.4. Owing to its large sink capacity, it is clear that potato has a high potential
to increase yield at more elevated CO2 concentrations, but there appear to be many
limitations to reaching those high yields. On average, the total, as well as the marketable
(cid:5)> 35 mm(cid:3) tuber yield, increased by about 22% in OTC experiments and about 30%
in FACE systems (Table 19.1). In the CHIP project, the yield increase was linked to a
significantly higher total number of tubers as well as marketable ones (Craigon et al.,
2002). The increase in tuber number is likely to be the result of the large increase in

Table 19.1 Percentage increases in potato tuber yield (marketable > 35 mm and total) relative to the response at ambient CO2 and the

photosynthetic capacity of the young potato plant. However, there are large differences
between individual sites. Up to 60% yield increase can only be reached under specific
conditions that are largely beneficial to promote tuber yield differences between exposure
to ambient and elevated CO2. A deterministic simulation model of potato growth that
considered the stimulatory effect of elevated CO2 on photosynthesis predicted that yield
might be increased by 20–30% by a doubling of atmospheric CO2 depending on the
earliness of the cultivars involved (Schapendonk et al., 1995). Experiments with potato
cultivar Katahdin, grown in a glasshouse, did indeed confirm an increased tuber growth
rate of 36% (Chen and Setter, 2003). These results are in agreement with the data presented
in Table 19.1, but doubling the CO2 concentration appears not to be necessary to reach
the maximum yield increase. Craigon et al. (2002) did not find a significant difference
−1 CO2. They concluded that
in tuber yield between OTC exposures at 550 and 680 (cid:2)l l
−1. Mackowiak and
the CO2 effect had saturated or was close to its maximum at 550 (cid:2)l l
−1,
Wheeler (1996) reported that tuber yield enhancement was at maximum at 1000 (cid:2)l l
but probably under more optimal conditions.

Predictions of potato yield stimulation by 20–30% (Schapendonk et al., 1995) have
partly been based on the increase of light interception by CO2-induced formation of
more leaf area, which is obviously not always the case (Schapendonk et al., 2000).
Consequently, the most important attribute to explain observed yield increases is the
photosynthetic stimulation on a leaf area basis. Accordingly, the hypothesis can be made
that increased sucrose availability under elevated CO2 feeds forward to the production
and the activity of the sink organs, thus resulting in a substantial enhancement of final
tuber yield. Late and early cultivars respond differently to elevated CO2. Stimulation of
photosynthesis appeared to be maintained longer in late cultivars, which have greater sink
activity than early cultivars because of their prolonged tubering capacity (Schapendonk
et al., 2000).

The climate itself has a large influence on potato yield. The highest potential and
actual tuber dry matter production are obtained in areas with temperate climates in north-
western Europe and northwest of the USA (Van der Zaag, 1984). This was also clearly
confirmed in the European CHIP project for field-grown potato exposed to ambient CO2
concentrations. There was linear increase of yield from Italy to Finland as a function of
decreasing daily total solar radiation during the growth period (De Temmerman et al.,
2002b). This seems contradictory to the statement of Kooman et al. (1996) that potential
yields of potato depend on the cumulative amount of radiation intercepted over the length
of the growing season. However, as summarized in Table 19.1, the growing period in Italy
is much shorter than in northern Europe. Early senescence of the potato crop is mainly
temperature driven (Kooman et al., 1996; Vaccari et al., 2001), and because high radiation
is linked to high temperatures, it coincides with the shorter growing period (Fig. 19.1).
As such, light use efficiency (LUE) is lowest in warm environments and highest in cooler
sites (Nelson and Midmore, 1986). Other essential prerequisites for obtaining high yield
are clearly water and nitrogen (Haverkort et al., 2003). However, irrigation is not able
to completely counteract drought stress. In spite of irrigation, the air humidity remains
rather low in dry regions such as in Italy (Table 19.1), limiting stomatal opening and CO2
uptake at present ambient concentrations.

As the environmental conditions such as temperature (Lawlor and Mitchell, 1991),
photoperiod and irradiance (Wheeler et al., 1991) vary between sites and years, the
absolute as well as the relative CO2 response will depend largely on those climatic
differences. In addition, most of the CO2 enrichment experiments have been carried out
in OTCs, and typically, these facilities increase ambient temperature, reduce incident
radiation and increase vapour pressure deficit (VPD). For wheat, van Oijen et al. (1999)
found that cooling the air entering the OTC to obtain the ambient level delayed senescence,
while the LUE was not affected. Cooling also increased the magnitude of the CO2
effect. Moreover, increased CO2 and VPD reduce stomatal opening, resulting in decreased
losses of water and heat. In combination with increased OTC temperature, this additional
stomatal closure causes increases in leaf temperature (Kimball et al., 1993) by a reduced
transpirational cooling of the leaves. CO2 itself causes partial stomatal closure, and
consequently, increased canopy temperatures were measured in Italy on FACE plots with
CO2 enrichment (Magliulo et al., 2003). Increases in foliage temperature are probably
beneficial if present temperatures are below the optimum for the crop but could be
harmful if they exceed this optimum. Vaccari et al. (2001) observed that the increased
canopy temperature in their FACE exposure of potato crops to CO2 coincided with
an accelerated chlorophyll breakdown and senescence (Bindi et al., 2002) and could
limit yield. However, the beneficial effects of increased CO2 supply on photosynthesis
and WUE remain much larger and result in an important yield increase. Changes in
radiation experienced by the plant growing in OTCs are probably even more important
than temperature as a factor modifying the response to elevated CO2 concentrations.
Schapendonk et al. (2000) found a faster decline of LAI at elevated CO2 under warm
conditions and high irradiance, but other factors may also be responsible. Radiation also
plays an important role in the allocation of assimilates, expressed as HI. The reduction of
radiation in OTCs may increase the retention of assimilates in the aboveground biomass
at the expense of the tuber biomass (De Temmerman et al., 2000). The effects on the
aboveground biomass are also reflected in the canopy height. Reduced radiation increased

Response to the environment: carbon dioxide

405

height growth in the OTCs compared to the ambient air plots on average by more than
55% in the CHIP project (Hacour et al., 2002). Radiation measurements carried out in
the Tervuren (Belgium) OTC system used for exposure of potato revealed a reduction
of radiation by 30% below the air duct suspended along the chamber walls above the
canopy, compared to the centre of the chamber where the reduction was almost zero for
a large part of the day (unpublished results). It must be stressed, however, that OTCs
are good tools for estimating CO2 effects on crops, as homogeneous CO2 enrichment is
straightforward, but for potato, it is probably not the ideal method due to the important
interactions of temperature and radiation on senescence and assimilate partitioning and
probably also on yield.

Elevated CO2 influences not only yield but also tuber quality: starch concentration
was increased under elevated CO2, but the reducing sugar concentration was not affected
significantly (Vorne et al., 2002), whereas the nitrogen concentration was decreased
(Fangmeier et al., 2002; Heagle et al., 2003). The increased starch concentration can be
attributed to increased photosynthesis, which appeared to have more impact on starch
than on reducing sugars. It is also a rather general CO2 effect on many crops that the
nitrogen concentration is decreased and consequently so is the protein concentration such
as in wheat (Fangmeier et al., 1999).

19.5 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YIELD AND STRESSES AT

ELEVATED CO2

In spite of a partial closure of the stomata, a rather general effect of increased CO2
exposure, plants are able to maintain an increased photosynthetic rate during the main
part of the growing season. Indeed, owing to the elevated ambient CO2 concentration,
the internal leaf concentration remains fairly high with limited effects on photosynthesis,
whereas this partial closure can have important negative effects on photosynthesis at
normal ambient levels (Van der Mescht et al., 1999). In addition, stomatal closure also
has beneficial effects as the plants evaporate less water. As a consequence, it could be
expected that dry soil conditions and/or high VPDs would be much more harmful for
potato crops growing at ambient than at elevated CO2. Apart from an overall decreased
yield, the relative CO2 effect will be much more important for water-stressed than for
well-watered crops because of the better WUE. In the CHIP project, the option was
taken to provide the plants with ample water to avoid drought stress. This may be the
most important reason for the lack of CO2 response in some experiments as reported by
Craigon et al. (2002). As summarized in Table 19.1, yield increase due to elevated CO2
exposure was high in Italy and rather low in Belgium, Sweden, Germany and Finland.
Irrigation is important in dry conditions, but a high leaf to air water vapour pressure
difference may continue to be a major limitation to CO2 uptake even at twice the current
concentration (Bunce, 2003). This is probably one of the reasons for a generally lower
yield in Italy compared to the other sites, even at ambient levels of CO2, but the relative
yield increase at elevated CO2 is higher. Indeed, in spite of ample water supply, the VPD
remains high in Italy (Table 19.1). In temperate climate regions, the beneficial effect
of ample water supply on stomatal opening is more important, and photosynthesis is

406

De Temmerman et al.

less reduced compared to elevated CO2. However, other stresses than drought might be
involved, and moreover, if comparisons are made with other experiments than CHIP, the
response to CO2 increases appears to be highly cultivar dependent (Schapendonk et al.,
2000) and largely variable from year to year.

Contrary to drought, stress caused by nutrient shortage will most likely reduce the
effect of elevated CO2. It appeared from several studies that elevated CO2 decreases the
nitrogen concentration in the plant, which is reflected in reduced protein concentrations
(Fangmeier et al., 1999, 2002). It was suggested that earlier leaf senescence leading to a
reduced yield may be induced by nitrogen limitation under elevated CO2 conditions (Nie
et al., 1995; Stitt and Krapp, 1999). This is probably the reason for the reduced yield at
elevated CO2 compared to ambient CO2 in Sweden during the CHIP project (Table 19.1).
To avoid any effect of drought stress on stomatal opening of the leaves, the well-drained
OTC soils were abundantly irrigated, probably causing leaching of nitrates. The nitrogen
shortage was reflected in the low yields at ambient CO2 (De Temmerman et al., 2002b)
and a negative yield effect of increased CO2 supply. As CO2 enrichment is increasing the
nitrogen demand of the crop, the availability of the nutrient could become the limiting
factor for the CO2 effect on yield.

Elevated CO2 is, to some extent, protecting plants from ozone effects (De Temmerman
et al., 2002c), but elevated CO2 did not directly protect against yield losses in the CHIP
experiments, indicating that O3-induced losses of potato yield will still occur in a future
climate conditions even under elevated CO2. The yield increases observed in response to
elevated CO2 far exceed ozone-induced losses (Craigon et al., 2002). Elevated CO2 causes
stomatal closure and thus protects plants from air pollution and water loss. Moreover,
the increased carbohydrate status of the plants may benefit detoxification and repair
mechanisms (van Oijen et al., 2004).

19.6 MODELLING FUTURE POTATO PRODUCTIVITY

The physiological and morphological responses of potato to elevated CO2 have been
discussed in the previous sections 2 to 5, as have some of the interactions with other
environmental factors. In this section, we shall review how this knowledge has been
incorporated in dynamic models of potato growth.

Crop modelling started in the 1960s (Bouman et al., 1996), and the earliest potato
models were developed in the late 1970s (Ng and Loomis, 1984). Many models have
been produced since that time; already in 1992, MacKerron (1992) was able to list 23
potato simulation models. However, none of these models was developed to account for
elevated CO2, their main purposes being to assist in potato breeding, assess the scope for
growing potato in new areas or estimate the implications of limited water supply or high
temperature (MacKerron, 1992; Haverkort and MacKerron, 1995). The earliest potato
models attempted to represent the typical characteristics of the potato crop: indeterminate
growth pattern, timing of TI dependent on temperature, day length and cultivar, a large
carbohydrate sink in the tubers and only little allocation to seeds (Ng and Loomis, 1984).
Later potato models tended to be simpler, re-parameterized instances of general crop
growth models.

Response to the environment: carbon dioxide

407

In the last decade, various reviews of crop modelling have appeared in the context of
global change, including elevated CO2 (Kickert et al., 1999). Here, we focus on modelling
approaches that have been, or could be, applied to potato. The simplest vegetation models
that represent the effect of CO2 use the concept of the biotic growth factor (cid:8) (Gifford,
1980) as follows:

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

= 1+ (cid:8) ln

G
G0

Ca
Ca(cid:6)0

(cid:6)

(19.1)

where G and G0 are growth rates at elevated and reference levels of ambient carbon
dioxide (cid:5)Ca(cid:6) Ca(cid:6)0(cid:3). Goudriaan and de Ruiter (1983) varied Ca in greenhouses and found
a value of 0.7 for (cid:8) for different crops including potato.

The approach using the biotic growth factor is entirely empirical and, in contrast to
more mechanistic approaches, cannot be used to study the variation in response to CO2
among cultivars and growing conditions.

19.6.1 Source-driven potato growth models

In many potato models, growth rate is calculated as the product of light interception
and LUE (Haverkort and MacKerron, 1995). Such models generally assume that LUE
and allocation are independent of the carbohydrate status of the plants, growth thus
being solely source-determined. This approach does not lend itself easily to incorporating
complex effects of elevated CO2. The effect of CO2 on LUE could be represented using
the biotic growth factor (Eq. 19.1), but no examples of this approach exist. Alternatively,
the dependence of LUE on the photosynthetic capacity of the leaves (light-saturated
photosynthetic rate, Asat, and quantum yield, (cid:9)) can be formulated as follows (van Oijen
et al., 2004):

LUE =

(cid:10)(cid:9)

1+ kI0/Asat

(cid:6)

(19.2)

where (cid:10) is the efficiency with which gross assimilated CO2 is converted to biomass
−1(cid:3)(cid:6) k is the light extinction coefficient (about 1.0 for potato,
(typically about 0(cid:7)4 g g
Spitters and Schapendonk, 1990) and I0 is photoperiod irradiation. Schapendonk et al.
(2000) used Eq. (19.2) to quantify the reduction in LUE brought about by acclimation
of Asat to elevated CO2. In their OTC experiments, CO2 doubling increased the biomass
yield of two potato cultivars by 20%, after initially increasing Asat by about 80%. The
increase in Asat was only temporary – it gradually decreased to the level of the ambient
CO2 treatment. The observed time courses of Asat were translated, using Eq. (19.2), into
time courses of LUE, and these explained the observed yields well when used in an
LUE-based potato model (Schapendonk et al., 2000). The model was then used to show
that the yield increase would have been about 36% if acclimation had not taken place.

Equation (19.2) was also at the heart of the potato model used by Wolf and van Oijen
(2002, 2003) to simulate the possible effects of elevated CO2 and other environmental
factors on potato yields in Europe. However, these authors had insufficient data on
photosynthetic capacity to parameterize Eq. (19.2) directly, so they inferred changes in

408

De Temmerman et al.

Asat and (cid:9) from relationships between LUE and CO2 and other factors, as observed in the
CHIP project referred to above (De Temmerman et al., 2002a). Their modelling analysis
suggests that environmental change expected for the year 2050 is likely to increase potato
yields across the EU by 1000–4000 kg dry matter per hectare, mainly because of an
expected 50% increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration and with little interaction of
CO2 with other factors.

Instead of using an empirically determined dependence of Asat on CO2, we may employ
a mechanistic equation that can be derived from the photosynthesis model of Farquhar
et al. (1980):

(cid:4)
I→ A = Vc(cid:6)max (cid:5)Ci

+ KmC

Ci

Asat

(cid:5) (cid:6)

(19.3)

− (cid:11)

where Vc(cid:6)max is maximum carboxylation velocity, Ci is the leaf internal CO2 concentration,
∗
is the CO2 compensation point, O2 is the oxygen concentration and KmC and KmO are
(cid:11)
the Michaelis–Menten constants of Rubisco for CO2 and O2(cid:7) Vc(cid:6)max is proportional to leaf
Rubisco concentration, so photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2, but also damage
to Rubisco by O3, can be modelled using Eq. (19.3), by including Rubisco as a state
variable in the model. Moreover, the parameters in Eq. (19.3) have shown temperature
dependencies (Farquhar et al., 1980; Medlyn et al., 2002), so interactions of CO2 and
temperature can be assessed as well (van Oijen et al., 2004).

19.6.2 Source–sink-based potato growth models

The models described above do not represent sink strengths explicitly. The growth rates
of leaves, stems, tubers and roots are assumed to be calculable by multiplying overall
photosynthetic rate with organ-specific allocation factors that depend on thermal time and
day length. In source-driven models, photosynthetic acclimation can only be represented
as a direct reduction, by elevated CO2, of growth, LUE, Asat or Rubisco concentration.
However, acclimation is the consequence of source strength exceeding sink strength, and
mechanistic models of this phenomenon have been made. In fact, one of the earliest potato
models (Ng and Loomis, 1984) explicitly simulated the accumulation of carbohydrates
in case of sink limitation and a negative feedback of the carbohydrates on photosynthetic
rate. This model and others that make growth a function of temperature-dependent, organ-
specific sink strength (Ingram and McCloud, 1984) have not been very successful in
practice because at the time of model development, data were lacking to support model
parameterization and testing. However, the fact that photosynthetic acclimation to elevated
CO2 has recently been demonstrated in potato (Schapendonk et al., 2000; Vandermeiren
et al., 2002), with sucrose accumulation the more likely signal as opposed to starch,
renews the case for such source–sink-based modelling. Source–sink-based models have
already proved successful in other crops such as grasses and maize (Höglind et al., 2001),
although we still face difficulties in assessing and modelling the adaptability of sinks to
prolonged excess source strength (Chen and Setter, 2003; van Oijen and Levy, 2005).

The leaves form a sink for carbohydrates whose strength is critical for the overall
response to elevated CO2 (Ewert, 2004). If leaf growth is enhanced by elevated CO2, the

Response to the environment: carbon dioxide

409

capacity of the crop to intercept light will increase, thereby further enhancing growth.
However, much recent evidence suggests that this positive feedback response to elevated
CO2 does not occur because of reduced allocation of carbohydrates to foliage (Ewert,
2004) or reduced SLA (Bindi et al., 1998, 2000; Miglietta et al., 1998; Schapendonk
et al., 2000; Vaccari et al., 2001). For potato, recent modelling studies have found that,
until LAI exceeds a value of 1.0, leaf growth rate is determined by temperature rather
than source strength (Van Delden et al., 2001). This is likely to reduce the impact of
elevated CO2 on potato production.

19.6.3 Applications of potato models to CO2-related issues: towards integrated

assessment

As indicated above, potato models have mainly been developed to assist in plant breeding,
scoping studies or estimating the effects of water stress or high temperature. The focus
has been on modelling growth and yield, rather than the quality of the product. There
have been efforts to model tuber size distribution (Nemecek et al., 1996), but tuber
quality, and how it is affected by growing conditions such as CO2, has not yet been
modelled. Applications in breeding have focused on identifying potato cultivars with
drought tolerance or disease resistance (Spitters and Schapendonk, 1990; van Oijen, 1992;
Jefferies, 1993; Ellisèche and Hoogendoorn, 1995), but changes in atmospheric CO2
concentration have not been considered. Potato models have been used to determine the
scope for profitable potato production across the world (Van Keulen and Stol, 1995), but
these studies have neglected global change including changes in atmospheric CO2.

19.7 CONCLUSIONS

Potato has a high potential to increase yield at increasing ambient CO2 concentrations.
On average, 20–30% yield increase is reported by exposure of the crop to 1.5 or 2 times
the actual ambient concentration. Under specific conditions such as interactions between
environmental stress (drought) and increased CO2, yield can increase by more than 60%.
In temperate climate regions, where drought effects are less likely, fertilizer availability
could become limiting to reach large yield differences between ambient and elevated
CO2 exposure. Accurate predictions of the effects of changing climatic variables on plant
productivity will be dependent on the development of robust dynamic mechanistic models
that are built on a sound understanding of the mechanisms by which environmental factors
can influence photosynthetic processes (Baker, 1996). Although potato has some very
specific features that would allow a large CO2 response, the photosynthetic acclimation
shows that this crop does not profit at full capacity from the increased CO2 supply.
Further investigations on the molecular background of this phenomenon may provide
valuable information for further crop improvement. If photosynthetic acclimation can be
decreased through breeding or management, potato could benefit more from an increase in
the atmospheric CO2 concentration than determinate crops such as cereals (Schapendonk
et al., 2000).

410

De Temmerman et al.

The studies by Wolf and van Oijen (2002, 2003), referred to above, did include the
effect of elevated CO2, but focused only on one cultivar, ‘Bintje’. In short, potato models
have been used to determine what types of potato to grow, where to grow potatoes and
how potatoes will respond to environmental change, but these questions have been studied
in isolation. We suggest that we move towards integrated assessment. Potato breeding
and cultivar selection may profoundly alter the geographical distribution of areas suitable
for potato growth. Climate change may improve or worsen conditions, but elevated CO2
is likely to increase yields and WUE (Wolf and van Oijen, 2002). It thus makes sense
to address all these issues together, and the complexity of the combined problem will
require models to identify solutions. The advances in mechanistic understanding of the
physiological impact of elevated CO2 on potato, outlined in this chapter, will be an
essential ingredient in this integrated assessment of potato growth.

20.1 INTRODUCTION

Agricultural sustainability, where salinity stress is a major problem, depends on a
collaborative and integrative approach. This involves water management engineering
and remedial cultural practices combined with crop improvement
(Tester and
Davenport, 2003). In 2006, there were no commercially important potato cultivars with
outstanding salinity tolerance. However, significant variation for salinity tolerance exists
among wild Solanum species and their accessions and among Solanum tuberosum culti-
vars. This salinity tolerance may be increased through conventional breeding efforts, tissue
culture or molecular technologies. Improved or modified cultural and water management
practices can enhance potato crop productivity. The application of these technologies to
potato is reviewed, accomplishments to date are summarized, and possible strategies to
accelerate the development of salinity tolerant potato are discussed.

Soil salinity, usually excess sodium chloride (NaCl) in soil, adversely affects the
productivity of most crop plants. Although all crop plants tend to be affected by salt,
they exhibit varying levels of yield depression in their response to saline soils or saline
irrigation water. In this discussion, the relative terms ‘sensitive’ or ‘tolerant’ are used
to suggest a continuum of decreasing injury caused by the exposure of crop species to
. The uppermost spectrum of tolerance would approach the resistance demonstrated
Na
by halophytic species that have evolved in saline environments. For example, most crop

plants cannot tolerate soil salinity levels that exceed 10 dS m
−1 (Ahmad, 1997). This review is focussed on cultivated

potato (S. tuberosum L.) and is not intended to encompass the multiplicity of salt effects
on plants. The reader is referred to recent comprehensive review articles on sodium
tolerance and salinity effects (Parida and Das, 2005), potential biochemical indicators of
salinity tolerance (Ashraf and Harris, 2004), cellular basis of salinity tolerance (Mansour

methods for salinity tolerance (Munns and James, 2003), sodium tolerance and trans-

20.2 SALT-AFFECTED AGRICULTURAL LANDS – WHERE ARE THEY?

World population is increasing steadily, and as a result, demand for food is increasing.
Meanwhile, world arable land is declining due to industrial development and settlements.
These have put tremendous pressure on agricultural activities. Irrigated lands occupy
about 15% of the total cultivated land area of the world but produce as much as 30%
of the world’s food (Flowers and Yeo, 1995; Munns, 2002). Production can be increased
two-to-three-fold under irrigated land as compared with rain-fed lands. Therefore, it is
necessary to develop irrigation potential by at least 2.25% per annum to cope with the
food demand (FAO, 1992). Although land exploitation is becoming more imperative,
the expansion of irrigated land is slow because most of the favourable land and water
resources have already been exploited. Although more land areas are continually being
put under irrigation, wide-scale abandonment of vast tracts of arable land in the order
of 6–10 million hectares of irrigated land also occurs every year (Szabolcs, 1987, 1994;
Umali 1993; FAO, 1995). This secondary salinization and waterlogging continues to
expand due to inefficient execution of irrigation projects, improper or wasteful irrigation
techniques and lack or mismanagement of drainage systems (FAO, 1995; Flowers and
Yeo, 1995; Thomas and Middleton, 1993; Umali, 1993). Of the world’s irrigated land,
a frightening 30% overall (Munns, 2002) including 30% in the USA (Ward et al., 2003)
and 50% in some countries (Thomas and Middleton, 1993; Ahmad, 1997) is affected by
excess salinity. It is estimated that 6–10% of the total world land mass is now affected by
excess salinity (Thomas and Middleton, 1993; Szabolcs, 1994; Flowers and Yeo, 1997;
Munns, 2002). Salt-affected land is unevenly distributed around the globe. Most of these
salt-affected lands are located in Australia and Asia (69%), and the rest are scattered
around the world (Ahmad, 1997).

20.2.1 Is potato grown in salt-affected areas?

The major potato-growing countries, and their production areas, were listed by Hijmans
(2001, 2003). Potato is grown all over the world, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere
and in temperate regions; the top producers include China, Russia, Ukraine, Poland and
India. It is estimated that 79% of countries in the world grow potato (Woolfe, 1986).
Global distribution of potato is shown in the World Potato Atlas on the International Potato
Center (CIP) website and is reproduced, with permission, as Fig. 20.1. For comparison
purposes, the global distribution of stress-affected soils, including saline soils, is shown
in Fig. 20.2. It is clear from these maps that most of the area under potato cultivation
is in countries that are not overly affected by salinity. The exceptions are countries
in southern and southeastern Asia, where coastal or inland salinity is more common
(Ghosh et al., 2001). The weather has a direct impact on potato yield. Global climate

change predictions were recently applied to potato to estimate changes in growing area
and yield by mid-century (Hijmans, 2003). Total potato yield is predicted to decrease by
18–32%. Most predicted yield reductions were attributed to temperature change alone,
although changes in radiation (primarily due to shifts in planting time) could be responsible
to some degree. However, higher temperatures will lead to greater water demand for
agricultural production at a time when increased consumption for domestic and other use
is expected due to industrial development and population growth (Elkhatib et al., 2004b).
Scarcity of water would further decrease potato yield. Not only would there be scarcity
of water, the quality of water would also deteriorate. To maintain potato production at
the present level, an increase in cultivated area, the exploitation of brackish water sources
and improved water management technology will be necessary. In this future scenario,
potato with improved stress tolerance, including heat, drought and salinity tolerances,
will be of increasing importance.

20.3 INTEGRATED APPROACH TO CROPPING SALINE SOILS

The case of potato is typical of other temperate crop species with moderate sensitivity to
salinity. Cultural practices are important in determining the growth and productivity
of such crops under salinity stress. Considerable engineering and cultural management
expertise has emerged to enable the growth of crops such as potato under saline soil and
brackish water conditions in developing countries [Ashraf, 1994; Flowers and Yeo, 1995;
Ahmad, 1997; and many others, including field lysimeter studies (Patel et al., 1999, 2001;
Katerji et al., 2000, 2003; Elkhatib et al., 2004a,b)].

The economic burden of soil reclamation, drainage and water desalination is increasing
and often prohibitive. For this reason, it is important to improve farm management
practices. This includes the use of drip irrigation to optimize water use where irrigation
is practiced (Munns, 2002). Munns also suggests that rotation of annual crops with
deep-rooted perennials could control rising water tables that bring salts up to the soil
surface in the rain-fed zone. It is also essential to incorporate increased salinity tolerance
into crops (Flowers and Yeo, 1995). However, both screening and breeding for salinity
tolerance in crops have turned out to be intensely challenging.

To determine what real accomplishments had occurred in the development of
salt-tolerant plants, Flowers and Yeo (1995) conducted a survey of the plant patent
literature, the Science Citation Index and various scientific journals in which plant breeders
register new varieties (such as Crop Science). Their survey showed that few salinity
tolerant or resistant cultivars of any crop had ever been released. We repeated these
searches in the summer of 2005. We were also disappointed; few crops were listed and no
salinity tolerant potato releases had occurred. In 1987, Epstein and Rains (1987) observed,
‘the number of breeders addressing the problem of salt tolerance is as yet minuscule’.
Almost 20 years later, the observation of Epstein and Rains is still true for potato. Few
potato breeders have considered salinity tolerance as a priority. In addition, the complexity
of breeding for this multigenic trait may seem overwhelming to an individual breeder
with limited resources; a team approach is essential (Flowers and Yeo, 1995).

20.4 MECHANISMS OF SALINITY TOLERANCE IN PLANTS

Salt stress imposes a complex metabolic disorder in glycophytic crop plants, such as
potato, which is a combination of drought stress (lowering of water potential), specific
ion toxicity, mineral (cation) deficiency, oxidative stress and other harmful effects
which together reduce plant growth and productivity (Fidalgo et al., 2004; Netondo
et al., 2004a,b). All major biochemical processes are depressed by salinity, including
photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and energy and lipid metabolism (Parida and Das, 2005).
Salt-tolerant plants appear to use a wide spectrum of adaptive, interactive biochemical
and molecular mechanisms that act additively and synergistically. These mechanisms
involve ions (selective accumulation or exclusion, compartmentalization in cells or organs,
control of root-uptake or transport into leaves), synthetic activities (compatible solutes,
antioxidative enzymes and hormones) and altered photosynthetic pathways and membrane
structure (Parida and Das, 2005). It has not been possible for plant physiologists to
identify any one single trait for exploitation by plant breeders or geneticists (Ashraf and
Harris, 2004; Mansour and Salama, 2004).

20.4.1 What is known of salinity tolerance mechanisms in potato?

Relatively little is known of salinity tolerance mechanisms specific to potato. The only
physiological parameter that has been studied to any extent is in the category of compatible
solutes. Correlations between relative salt tolerance and proline levels have been examined
in potato plants grown in the field (Levy et al., 1988; Heuer and Nadler, 1995, 1998) and
in vitro (van Swaaij et al., 1986; Potluri and Prasad, 1993; Martinez et al., 1996; Rahnama
and Ebrahimzadeh, 2004) including in transformants tested in vitro (Evers et al., 1999).
Findings have been inconsistent. No relationship was found between salt tolerance and
proline levels in seven cultivars grown under salinity stress (Levy et al., 1988). However,
in cv. Désirée, leaf water and osmotic potentials declined significantly with increased
stress, and positive turgor was apparently maintained by osmotic adjustment to salinity
stress through chloride and proline accumulation (Heuer and Nadler, 1995, 1998).

In vitro studies were also inconsistent with respect to proline accumulation in the
presence of salinity stress. van Swaaij et al. (1986) used resistance to hydroxyproline
to screen mutant cell lines of a diploid S. tuberosum clone for proline overproduction.
Following growth for several months on non-selective medium, callus lines were tested for
salinity tolerance and proline levels. Of four callus lines with elevated salinity tolerance,
three showed greater concentrations of proline, whereas one line did not. No plants were
regenerated from these calli. One variant line regenerated shoots that showed increased
frost tolerance and elevated shoot proline levels, but its relative salinity tolerance was not
reported. Of six potato varieties (from CIP) grown from axillary buds on MS basal medium
(Murashige and Skoog, 1962) with various salt levels in vitro, some showed significantly
increased proline concentration in stems and less in the leaves but not in the roots (Potluri
and Prasad, 1993). Other varieties had increased protein but not proline content, and
one showed increased shoot carbohydrate levels. Martinez et al. (1996) used four wild
potato genotypes with varying frost tolerance (from CIP) to examine salinity tolerance
in vitro. The genotypes included the highly frost-resistant Solanum juzepczuckii cv. Pinaza

and Solanum curtilobum cv. Ugro shiri, the moderately frost-resistant Solanum andigena
cv. Compis and the sensitive S. tuberosum cv. Baronesa. Based on the survival and
shoot length, the two highly frost-tolerant genotypes performed better in vitro on elevated
salinity levels than the other two genotypes. In addition, foliar proline concentrations
increased in S. juzepczuckii and S. curtilobum but not the other two genotypes exposed to
frost and NaCl stress in vitro (Martinez et al., 1996). In contrast, no relationship between
proline levels and salinity tolerance occurred in shoots and callus from four cultivars
exposed to salinity stress (Rahnama and Ebrahimzadeh, 2004).

In summary, salinity tolerance mechanisms in potato seem not to have been investigated
in any detail, with the exception of proline, a compatible solute. Proline studies with potato
showed inconsistent results in the field and in vitro. If proline overproduction is involved
in some wild Solanum species, this would not be the only mechanism of salinity tolerance.
Overproduction of osmo-protectants is insufficient to protect against salinity; regulation
of uptake and compartmentalization is necessary to prevent accumulation and toxicity
in photosynthesizing organs (Munns, 2002; Tester and Davenport, 2003).

20.5 CLASSIFICATION OF SALINITY TOLERANCE IN POTATO

The relative salinity tolerance of a long list of crop plants was compiled from early
literature (Maas and Hoffman, 1977; Maas, 1985). Mediating factors in crop response to
salinity included varietal differences, stage of growth, soil fertility, soil water and aeration,
irrigation frequency and climate. Potato was described as moderately salt-sensitive, based
on data from cv. Early Rose, which was cultivated under flood irrigation on loam soil
(Bernstein et al., 1951). Reliant on substrate salinity and relative crop yield in field-based
lysimeters, Katerji et al. (2000, 2003) also grouped potato (cv. Spunta) with the moderately
salt-sensitive crops.

Katerji et al. (2000, 2003) proposed a more discriminating method of classification,
the water stress day index (WSDI). This classification was based on measurement of
pre-dawn leaf water potentials. The WSDI decreased as salinity levels increased. In
this classification, potato was placed with the salt-tolerant crops; its sub-grouping was
‘moderately sensitive’. What distinguished potato from species in the more sensitive group
was its constant water-use efficiency as the salinity levels increased. Factors that affected
transpiration did not determine salinity tolerance. No correlations occurred between leaf
area, osmotic adjustments and yield reduction. For modelling crop response to salinity, it
is preferable to use a reliable indicator of plant water status, such as pre-dawn leaf water
potential, instead of stress coefficients that depend on the soil water status as the latter do
not accurately express the water available to the plant (Katerji et al., 2000, 2003).

Potato could one day be classified on the basis of physiological mechanisms relating
to salinity tolerance, including (1) concentration of organic solutes at the cellular level,
such as glycinebetaine and proline (Ashraf and Harris, 2004), (2) transport proteins (Man-
sour et al., 2003) and (3) cytoplasmic viscosity (Mansour and Salama, 2004). However,
these criteria are still under investigation for their effectiveness and efficiency. For this
reason, classification of salt tolerance based on field performance and criteria such as
WSDI appears to be more definitive.

20.6 EVALUATIONS OF SALINITY TOLERANCE IN POTATO

relative salinity tolerance of crops (compiled by Maas and
Determinations of
Hoffman, 1977; Maas 1985; reported by Katerji et al., 2000, 2003) were made using
only one potato cultivar. It is important to note that, consistent with findings in other
crops (Ashraf, 1994), significant variation in response to salinity has been found among
S. tuberosum cultivars, wild Solanum species and among accessions from these wild
species. Evaluation of salinity tolerance in cultivated and wild potato has been performed
in the field, in the greenhouse and in tissue culture systems. In some cases, screening
served to identify genotypes of potato that exhibited less impact of salt on growth and/or
yield parameters and various physiological indices. As such, these studies are of interest
to the present treatise and are summarized below.

20.6.1 Field and greenhouse evaluations of salinity tolerance in potato

Field trials (Bernstein et al., 1951; Barnes and Peele, 1958; Paliwal and Yadav, 1980;
Levy, 1992; Heuer and Nadler, 1995; Nadler and Heuer, 1995), outdoor pot trials
(Ahmad and Abdullah, 1979; Levy et al., 1988) and greenhouse studies (Bilski et al.,
1988a, 1988b; Bruns and Caesar, 1990) explored the effects of salinity on potato plants
or evaluated the salt tolerance of one or several cultivars. Few of these experiments used
the same cultivars. Different studies used various salt mixtures, but NaCl was consistently
used as the main salt. Salt tolerance was determined based on relative plant dry weight
and/or relative reduction in tuber yield. Yield was assessed as mean tuber fresh weight per
unit area (field trials) or mean fresh weight per plant (outdoor or greenhouse pot trials).
These studies contributed much useful information on the response of potato to saline
irrigation water. Salinity affected plant emergence, reduced haulm growth and accelerated
maturity (Levy, 1992). However, no consistent relationship was found between maturation
time and salinity tolerance (Levy, 1992). Salinity had a direct effect on tuber yield, as
plants were most sensitive to salinity during tuber initiation and tuber bulking (Shannon
and Grieve, 1999). This resulted in reduced tuber numbers overall or reduced number
of over-large tubers. There were large differences in response to salinity stress among
S. tuberosum cultivars. For example, relative yield increased for three of six cultivars
as salt levels increased from 0.2 to 0.8%. However, at 1% mixed salts, relative yields
decreased by 20–85% for all cultivars (Ahmad and Abdullah, 1979).

Wild Solanum species that evolved in dry South American habitats were suggested
as potential sources of stress tolerance, with several
listed as heat and drought
tolerant
(Solanum acaule, Solanum bulbocastanum, Solanum chacoense, Solanum
megistacrolobum, Solanum microdontum, Solanum papita, Solanum pinnatisectum and
Solanum tarijense) and a longer list as frost tolerant (Hawkes, 1990). In this regard, in
vitro testing of some of the CIP selections was done by Elhag (1991). However, there
are few published studies in which wild species were evaluated for salinity tolerance
under field or greenhouse conditions. Solanum kurzianum shoot growth was superior to
that of the two S. tuberosum cultivars Alpha and Russet Burbank in a salinized hydro-
ponic trial (Sabbah and Tal, 1995). There were clear differences in response to salinity
stress among Solanum species and between accessions of the same species. For example,

Towards the development of salt-tolerant potato

423

11 accessions of six species were evaluated for survival and growth (haulm dry weight)
in greenhouse pot trials (Bilski et al., 1988b). S. chacoense (PI# 320285 was the only
accession tested) was the most tolerant, Solanum gourlayi, S. microdontum, Solanum
sparsipilum and S. bulbocastanum were moderately tolerant, and S. papita was the least
tolerant. Although these studies provided information on salt tolerance from a vegetative
growth perspective, inferences could not always be drawn on the effect on tuber yield.

20.6.2 In vitro evaluations of salinity tolerance in potato

Pioneering studies on in vitro screening for salinity tolerance evaluated a limited number
of potato species and cultivars (Arslan et al., 1987; Morpurgo and Silva-Rodriguez,
1987; Morpurgo, 1991). In vitro assessments involved the addition of NaCl to MS
basal medium. In most cases, stem cuttings with one or more axillary buds were taken
from micropropagated plantlets and subjected to one or more levels of salt stress. The
precise concentration of NaCl suitable for effective in vitro screening and useful growth
parameters for evaluation were both uncertain. For example, one relatively high level of
NaCl (103–154 mM) compared with MS control medium could not quantify differences in
relative salinity tolerance between potato cultivars (Morpurgo and Silva-Rodriguez, 1987;
Morpurgo, 1991).

The nodal-cutting bioassays were subsequently validated based on correlations between
in vitro growth parameters and either haulm growth (Naik and Widholm, 1993)
or yield parameters (Elhag, 1991; Morpurgo, 1991) in the field under salinized irrigation
conditions. Elhag (1991) compared a large number of potato genotypes (86, including
11 cultivars and 36 wild species) at four NaCl levels (0, 40, 80 and 120 mM NaCl) in vitro
and in the field. Evaluation of in vitro performance was based on the sum of the ranking
of the relative growth parameters at 40, 80 and 120 mM NaCl. Two growth parameters
(shoot length and fresh weight) decreased progressively with increase in salinity level.
These two parameters were significantly correlated with each other in culture, in the field
and with tuber yield in the field. However, Zhang and Donnelly (1997) did not find a
consistent relationship between these two growth parameters at different salinity levels.
For thirteen genotypes tested in a similar manner, salinity exposure depressed growth
parameters from 30 to 100% (Zhang et al., 1993). Single-node cuttings from six
hybrids derived from S. tuberosum × three wild species (S. chacoense, S. gourlayi and
S. microdontum; received from Dr. H. de Jong, AAFC, Fredericton, NB) were also tested.
In preliminary trials, two S. tuberosum × S. chacoense hybrids were more tolerant than
the other hybrids but less tolerant than the wild accessions and some of the cultivars.

Responses varied widely in different accessions of some wild species tested in vitro
(Elhag, 1991; Khrais, 1996). The six top-ranked wild Solanum species in Elhag’s
study were S. chacoense (PI# 16979), S. gourlayi, S. sparsipilum, Solanum spegazzinii,
S. tarijense and Solanum vernei. The response of different accessions from one species
was sometimes dramatically different. For example, while one S. chacoense accession
was the most tolerant, two others did not perform well. Thirteen S. chacoense accessions
varied from sensitive to very tolerant (Khrais, 1996). Based on germination and early
seedling growth under salinity stress, four of these S. chacoense accessions (PI# 275139,
320285, 320290 and 458309) were identified as outstanding. These studies highlighted

424

Donnelly et al.

the need to identify the accessions tested and to evaluate a representative number of
accessions within each species. Many of the 36 wild species tested by Elhag (1991) were
represented by only one to three accessions; some performed moderately well, suggesting
that a greater number of accessions from these species should be evaluated.

In later studies, single-node cuttings were compared with other in vitro bioassays,
including the growth of apical root segments (Naik and Widholm, 1993; Zhang and
Donnelly, 1997), suspension cultures (Naik and Widholm, 1993) and microtubers
(Kim et al., 1995; Zhang and Donnelly, 1997; Silva et al., 2001). Naik and Widholm
(1993) used six levels of NaCl (0, 5, 100, 150, 200 and 250 mM) in the greenhouse
(at 70% sprout emergence) or in vitro. Comparisons were based on vegetative growth, but
not greenhouse yield parameters, and analyzed as a percentage of the control. Correlations
were found between root length in the root segment bioassay and plant fresh weight
in vivo, when averaged over the salt levels, excluding the control. Three types of in
vitro bioassays (single-node, root tip segment and microtuberization) were verified using
tuber yield criteria from field lysimeters under subsurface irrigation with salinized water
(Zhang and Donnelly, 1997). Of these three bioassays, microtuberization is useful from a
yield perspective. It is particularly important to extend understanding of salinity–nutrient
relationships beyond plant shoot growth parameters to yield-related growth events. For
this reason, effects of nutrients on microtuberization in salinized medium, including stolon
formation and growth, induction and bulking steps, are of special interest. Microtuber fresh
weights at any treatment level were not useful in predicting salinity tolerance, although
the means across a range of salinity levels were predictive for the three genotypes tested
(Zhang and Donnelly, 1997). The biggest drawback to the use of this bioassay was that
not all wild species or hybrids could be tuberized in vitro (Zhang and Donnelly, 1997).
The single-node bioassay was simplest to perform and was applicable to Solanum
species that were not readily microtuberized in vitro. However, of six growth parameters
used in the single-node bioassay, none could be recommended individually for salinity
tolerance ranking (Zhang and Donnelly, 1997). Accordingly, 130 European and North
American potato cultivars were screened for relative salinity tolerance and vigour using
the single-node bioassay for NaCl levels from 0 to 120 mM (Khrais et al., 1998). The
sums of the relative values for six growth parameters (shoot and root length and fresh
and dry weights), at each salinity level, were subjected to multivariate cluster analysis and
used to partition the cultivars into eight groups. The cultivars with the greatest salinity
tolerance included Amisk, BelRus, Bintje, Onaway, Sierra and Tobique. Tobique ranked
as less vigorous than the other cultivars in this group. Chavez et al. (1997) evaluated ten
advanced clones from CIP with potential for coastal Peru. These were examined using the
single-node bioassay and under field salinity conditions. A moderate correlation between
in vitro growth and yields in the field occurred. Cultivars with potential for growth
in coastal soils of Peru were recommended, including Tacna (high tolerance), Basadre
(medium-high tolerance), Costanera, Primavera and Desertica (medium tolerance).

In vitro evaluations of relative salinity tolerance have contributed useful knowledge
about the various effects of salinity on growth parameters and the relative tolerances of dif-
ferent potato cultivars, species and accessions. The relative rankings of cultivars compared
with these bioassays were confirmed in field or lysimeter studies (Elhag, 1991; Zhang
and Donnelly, 1997), although correlations were not always strong (Chavez et al., 1997).

Towards the development of salt-tolerant potato

425

Reports by Elhag (1991) and Khrais et al. (1998) with the single-node cutting bioassay
were particularly revealing. They showed that earlier studies, in which fewer genotypes
were evaluated, had to be reinterpreted now and genotypes that were ‘top ranked’ among
small populations needed to be benchmarked against these much larger populations. These
studies also underlined the necessity of evaluation at a range of salinity levels in vitro; it
was not possible to predict the growth response for individual genotypes as salinity levels
varied. It has been suggested that differential gene expression may occur at different stress
levels (Ashraf, 1994). Similar conclusions were drawn from work that involved short-
and long-term screening of potato seedling populations (Jefferies, 1996). Jefferies found
that potato seedling survival, even at 150 mM NaCl, was not predictive of long-term
yield performance at 50 mM NaCl. Culture ventilation improved the accuracy of in vitro
screening of tomato seedlings for salinity tolerance (Mills and Tal, 2004). Use of better
ventilation may increase the effectiveness of in vitro screening for potato.

There are logistical problems in applying single-node cutting or microtuberization
bioassays as screening tools on a large population of genotypes. This requires a
significant amount of work in terms of tissue culture manipulations, measurement of
growth parameters and analysis. As no single growth parameter accurately predicts
salinity tolerance, labour-intensive multiple growth measurements are necessary. Despite
the challenges, micropropagation systems have potential for screening genotypes capable
of nutrient uptake under different environmental stress regimes, which apart from salinity
could include water stress, high CO2, high light or temperature extremes. Genotypes
identified in vitro would need to be further tested in the greenhouse and/or field.

20.7 ENGINEERING AND CULTURAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR

MODULATION OF SALINITY STRESS

There is little doubt that increasing the sustainability of irrigation and drainage systems
will contribute most towards agricultural productivity in a future faced with increased
pressure on water resources. This is best done in an integrated context where engineers
and growers work together based on knowledge of the most vulnerable growth stages of
each crop.

Crops are affected by salinity stress partly due to water stress and partly due
to imbalance or deficiency of nutrients under osmotic stress conditions (Maas and
Hoffman, 1977). A few studies have been done towards a better understanding of water
and nutrient relationships of potato during NaCl stress. These may lead to improved pro-
ductivity during the most vulnerable growth stages (Bruns and Caesar, 1990; Levy, 1992)
and improved fertilisation to modulate salinity stress (Silberbush and Lips, 1991; Elkhatib
et al., 2004a,b).

20.7.1 Water management for potato crops under salinity stress

It is apparent that at moderate or high salinity levels, certain potato growth stages are
more vulnerable than others. Different water management strategies have been evaluated
for potato growing under saline regimes in the field (Levy, 1992) and greenhouse

426

Donnelly et al.

(Bruns and Caesar, 1990). Yield reductions were less when shoot emergence occurred
before salt application (Levy, 1992). Applied 1 week after emergence, salinity delayed
shoot development, especially at the higher salt concentrations (Bruns and Caesar, 1990).
When salt was applied at the onset of tuberization, plants showed earlier senescence and
reduced yields especially at the higher salt levels. Applied during tuber development,
salinity treatments only marginally affected shoot development but downgraded tuber
quality and accelerated plant senescence. Typical symptoms of salt stress on tubers include
discolouration and fissures (Fig. 20.3).

Practices that may reduce salt stress to the crop could include green sprouting to
promote early emergence and use of better-quality irrigation water during early-season
growth, including during shoot emergence and tuber induction. If saline irrigation can be
delayed to later in the season, impact on yield may be proportionally less.

Towards the development of salt-tolerant potato

Irrigation methods play an important role in potato production. Although saline water
can be applied using surface irrigation methods, it can cause leaf burn, depress yield and
increase soil salinity due to greater saline water usage. Paliwal and Yadav (1980) reported
−1 can cause reduction in yield. They also
that water with salinity as low as 20 meqL
−1 when irrigated
found that salinity in the topsoil layer increased from 2.1 to 14(cid:2)75 dS m
−1. Drip irrigation can be used to apply water
with water having salinity of about 9 dS m
−1 and a water saving of up to 30% compared with surface
with a salinity of 4(cid:2)5–5(cid:2)5 dS m
irrigation methods (Netafim, 2006). Frequent application of water with drip irrigation will
also reduce water stress on the crop. Nadler and Heuer (1995) demonstrated that water
−1 could be used with drip irrigation without affecting
with salinity levels of 1(cid:2)5–6 dS m
potato yield.

In North America, sub-irrigation is quite often used to apply fresh water. In this
method, water is applied from below the root zone through existing subsurface drainage
systems. This method has not often been used to apply saline water for irrigation, although
studies have shown that this is feasible. For example, Hanson and Carlton (1985) used
saline water in open ditches for sub-irrigation purposes. Patel et al. (2004) used saline
water in sub-irrigation for green peppers grown in lysimeters. Hanson and Carlton (1985)
and Patel et al. (2004) reported that water present in the soil profile above sub-irrigation
water was pushed upwards by sub-irrigation with brackish water. This is beneficial
because water with lower salinity, present in the soil profile, can effectively be used
during the early stages of crop growth. Patel et al. (1999, 2001) also used saline water
to sub-irrigate lysimeter-grown potato. Yield of cultivars Russet Burbank and Atlantic
was not affected by water table depth, but number of grade A tubers was increased for
Russet Burbank (not Atlantic) when the water table was maintained at 40 cm compared
with 80 cm below the soil surface (Patel et al., 1999). Yield of Norland, a short-season
cultivar, was more affected compared with the two long-season cultivars, Kennebec and
Russet Burbank (Patel et al., 2001). These studies showed that sub-irrigation with water
having salinity as high as 9 dS m

−1 could be effectively used for growing potato.

20.7.2 Fertiliser management for potato crops under salinity stress

Salinity–nutrient relationships are difficult to determine under field conditions but can
be resolved more readily in vitro or through the use of lysimeters. Micropropagation and
cell culture systems contribute a controlled environment in which nutrient relationships
under salinity stress can be compared. Exploration of potassium, phosphorus and nitrate
relationships of potato plantlets or cells in vitro was conducted using salinized medium.
Wu et al. (1996) demonstrated that potassium (K) acquisition was critical to salt tolerance
in glycophytes and suggested that increased K
fertilisation could potentially alleviate
salt stress. This concept was tested using micropropagated potato (Alhagdow et al.,
1999). Single-node cuttings were grown in MS basal medium containing 0, 40 or 80 mM
NaCl and 6, 20 or 30 mM K. After 1 month of growth, tissue Na levels were greater
when medium K
concentrations were 6 mM compared with 20 mM (MS control level).
However, medium K
concentrations of 30 mM did not limit tissue Na levels or pro-
mote growth. This study concluded that while K
deficiency increases salt damage, its
addition beyond the usual fertiliser recommendations was not likely to be beneficial in

+

+

alleviating salinity stress. Similar results were found in field lysimeters that were salinized
−1(cid:4) (Elkhatib et al., 2004a,b). Elkhatib et al. characterized yield
with NaCl (cid:3)9(cid:2)38 dS m
response to salinity stress using polynomial equations and used these to predict optimal
K

fertilisation rates.
In vitro studies have also promoted understanding of sodium–phosphate relationships.
High NaCl reduced inorganic phosphate uptake by several crops (summarized in Kalifa
et al., 2000) including potato (Zhong, 1993). Using radiophosphorus (cid:3)32P(cid:4), it was demon-
strated that as MS basal medium was increasingly salinized, phosphorus translocation to
micropropagated potato plantlet leaves was decreased (Kalifa et al., 2000). At high and
constant NaCl levels (120 mM), translocation of phosphorus into the leaves improved as
basal medium phosphorus levels were increased up to 2.5 mM.

Cell suspension cultures of Alpha and Désirée were depressed in biomass when NaCl
was present in the medium at 75 mM, although the addition of 4 mM CaCl modulated this
response (Hawkins and Lips, 1997). In salinized medium, salt-stressed cells took up only
45% of the amount of NO3
of control cells. This was not affected by addition of CaCl2 to
the medium. Reduced nitrate uptake during salinity stress was attributed to reduced plasma
membrane ATPase activity in the presence of salinity (at least during the short term of these
experiments), which reduced the proton gradient necessary for nitrate uptake.

−

20.7.3 Climatic conditions modulate salinity effects on potato

The response of plants to salinity is affected by climatic conditions. In a limited number
of studies, potato response to salinity was better under cooler, more humid conditions
(Bruns and Caesar, 1990) or under mild compared with high temperatures (Ferreyra
et al., 1997; Bustan et al., 2004). When temperatures were higher, tuber yields decreased,
and the differences were less between yields of controls and plants treated with salt
(Bruns and Caesar, 1990). Potato and other crops performed well beyond predicted
−1(cid:4) drip-irrigated soils, even when boron
expectations on highly salinized (cid:3)3–9 dS m
levels were excessive, under mild daily temperatures and cool nights (Ferreyra et al.,
1997). Similarly, Bustan et al. (2004) showed that current classifications of potato crop
response to salinity underestimated potato crop yields under mild climatic conditions.
In drip-irrigated (pulsed) fields in Israel, when the climate was not otherwise stressful,
relatively high potato yields were possible even when irrigation water reached salinity
−1. However, heat wave events, and especially their timing
levels as high as 6(cid:2)2 dS m
with respect to tuber development, had an increasingly critical impact on yield as salinity
stress increased. Following a heat wave, plants irrigated with saline water were slower
to recover; leaves were more likely to wilt permanently, and new leaf regeneration
was slower or absent compared with plants irrigated with fresh water. While sodium
levels tended to be greater in stems and older leaves than in young leaves, this ion
compartmentalization appeared to break down, and sodium levels increased dramatically
in young leaves compared with older tissues following a heat wave. Injury to young
expanding leaves was less critical before tuber initiation, at a time when these leaves could
be regenerated, or during declining tuber growth at the end of the season. Yields collapsed
when heat waves caused leaf injury during early tuber formation (40–60 days after
planting in cv. Désirée).

20.8 PRODUCING SALINITY TOLERANT POTATO

Salinity tolerance is complex and multigenic. Breeding for salinity tolerant crop plants
can be difficult and slow for many reasons (Munns, 1993). Breeding for salinity tolerance
in potato seems to be in its infancy. By comparison, understanding of salinity tolerance in
some model species such as Arabidopsis is relatively advanced. Great progress has also
been made in certain crop species related to potato, such as tomato. These works may
contribute strategic insights towards breeding for potato with salinity tolerance.

20.8.1 Salinity-tolerant wild and/or primitive potato species

Conventional breeding efforts for development of salinity tolerance in potato will require
parental material with documented salinity tolerance or resistance.

20.8.1.1 Where can a plant breeder find wild and/or primitive potato species with

potential salinity tolerance?

‘Major Genebanks’

A list of genebanks currently holding collections of wild and/or primitive potato
species is posted on the website of the Centre for Genetic Resources, The Netherlands
(CGN) under
(http://www.cgn.wageningen-ur.nl/pgr/collections/
crops/potato/genbanks.htm). On this website are listed databases held in Europe and The
Americas as well as Inter-genebank databases. The Association of Potato Inter-genebank
Collaborators (APIC) links the major potato genebanks from around the world (Europe,
Russia, USA and South America) and maintains the Inter-genebank Potato Database
(http://www.potgenebank.org). In 1996,
there were no descriptors relating to salin-
ity tolerance in potato. Some databases, such as GRIN, show evaluation data that
include ‘frost’ and ‘heat’ in their list of stress descriptors (http://www.ars-grin.gov/
ars/MidWest/NR6/evaluation.html), but salinity is not listed. Only the CGN has ‘Eval-
uation data’ for salt tolerance (http://www.genebank.nl/collections/crops/potato/). This
website has tabular data on the best clones identified through in vitro screening and
greenhouse pot trials by Elhag (1991). Salinity screening at 80 and 120 mM NaCl
identified four wild species (one accession each) as tolerant from among 58 acces-
sions of 36 wild species and 11 cultivars of S. tuberosum. The most tolerant genotypes
were S. chacoense PI#16979 (CGN#17898), S. sparsipilum PI#24687 (CGN#18099),
S. gourlayi PI#16837 (CGN#17853) and S. vernei PI#15451 (CGN#17836). When
retested at 120 and 160 mM NaCl, the S. chacoense and S. sparsipilum accessions were
tolerant, but S. tarijense was only moderately tolerant.

20.8.2 Domestication of wild salt-tolerant potato

Flowers and Yeo (1995, 1997) suggested that domestication of a wild salt-tolerant species
might be less expensive than breeding existing cultivars for salinity tolerance.

430

Donnelly et al.

20.8.2.1 Are there salt-resistant wild relatives of potato?

There are no apparent halophytic relatives of potato, although many accessions have been
collected (Huamán et al., 2000) from countries where saline soils are prevalent such as
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Peru, to name only a few. A few field and greenhouse
studies (Section 20.6.1) and several in vitro trials (Section 20.6.2) have compared the
relative salinity tolerance of wild species or accessions. Only the in vitro screening trials
of Elhag (1991), Khrais (1996) and Khrais et al. (1998) have compared large numbers
of species, many accessions of an individual species, or many cultivars, respectively.
Despite the limited number of comprehensive investigations of this subject, there is no
doubt that considerable variation exists among the wild species and their accessions and
among the cultivars of S. tuberosum.

20.8.2.2 Do drought or temperature tolerance contribute salt tolerance?

+

−

and Cl

A two-phase growth response characterizes the relative yield response (percentage of the
yield under control conditions) of any crop to salinity levels (Maas and Hoffman, 1977;
Munns and Termaat, 1986; Munns, 1993, 2002). The first phase (with a time frame of
minutes or days) results from low water potential of the medium and results in osmotic
effects on roots, root hormonal signals and reduced plant growth. During this phase,
compartmentalization of ions (Na
) in cell vacuoles occurs, and direct toxic
effects are avoided. In the second phase, salt toxicity is involved; vacuoles are saturated,
salts accumulate in the cytoplasm and cell walls and may result in tissue death. Long-term
rather than short-term testing was advocated as a means of detecting the real salt tolerant
not just osmotically tolerant selections as it was felt that all glycophytes reacted similarly
to short-term water stress. Long-term effects (with a time-frame of days or weeks) include
features of leaf injury and plant growth or biomass production that correlate with yield
and are more likely to distinguish genotypes with salinity tolerance (Munns, 1993, 2002).
Neumann (1997) argued that it is desirable to consider the osmotic effects of external
salinity separately and to select for this in the short term, in addition to screening for
increased tolerance to salt accumulation. The rational presented is that diversity has often
been found in the first phase of crop response. This diversity may have particular value in
areas of intermittent irrigation when irrigation water is moderately saline. For this reason,
response to both salinity and polyethylene glycol (PEG) or another osmotic agent should
be evaluated.

No relationship was found between salt tolerance and heat or drought tolerance in
a greenhouse pot trial of several wild potato species, although few accessions were
tested (Bilski, 1988b). However, frost tolerance and salt tolerance appeared related in
two wild species tested in vitro (Martinez et al., 1996). As few studies of this sort have
occurred with potato, independent screening for osmotic and temperature stresses will be
necessary.

20.8.3 Breeding for increased vigour and yield

As maximal plant productivity is affected by quantitative traits, there were some concerns
that yield potential would decrease if a trait was introduced to improve salinity tolerance

Towards the development of salt-tolerant potato

431

(Bohnert and Jensen, 1996; Winicov, 1998). This has not been discussed in any detail for
potato. Breeding for increased vigour, rather than salinity tolerance per se, is one strategy
that has been advocated for lands where salinity levels vary (Munns, 1993).

It is possible to screen in vitro for both salinity tolerance and vigour at the same time.
Screening activities indicated clear differences in relative vigour among S. tuberosum
cultivars in the most salinity tolerant group, where one of the six top-ranked cultivars
was less vigorous (Khrais et al., 1998).

20.8.4 Obtaining salinity tolerance through cell and tissue culture techniques

Screening at the cell level cannot identify whole-plant response mechanisms (Rains
et al., 1986). Increased salinity tolerance of cultured plant cells does not necessarily lead
to expression of salt tolerance in regenerated plants, primarily due to failure to understand
the tolerance mechanisms operating at the cellular and whole-plant levels (Dracup, 1991).
This was true for potato, where salinity tolerance relationships did not correspond between
callus cultures and greenhouse-tested plants (Sabbah and Tal, 1995). However, in some
cases, the salt-sensitive potato cultivar and the less-sensitive cultivar may have been too
similar in response to salinity at the whole-plant level to expect major differences at the
cellular level (Hawkins and Lips, 1997).

Another attempt to derive salinity tolerant plants from potato callus was described
by Hannachi et al. (2004). Adventitious shoots of cv. Claustar were collected from
control callus from MS basal medium or callus adapted to growth medium containing
−1 NaCl. Plants derived from control or salt-adapted callus were field-evaluated
3 g L
−1 NaCl(cid:4) irrigation water. Yield parameters
under conditions of clean or saline (cid:3)4 g L
(number and mean weight of tubers per plant) were similar in both groups. Reduced
number of eyes and reduced tuber diameter in the salt-adapted plants occurred. Deep
fissuring of tubers resulted from exposure to saline irrigation water and was worse in the
salt-adapted plants than in the adventitiously produced control plants. It is not always clear
from such studies whether adventitious shoots (caliclones) produced on callus exposed to
elevated salt levels are ‘escapes’ from the high salt environment or truly produced under
conditions of elevated salt. It is also unclear to what extent these caliclones might vary
from the original cultivar and how stable this variation might be.

In a unique report of salt tolerance at the cellular level translating to tolerance at
the whole-plant level, a salt-tolerant caliclone (clone 150) from potato, cv. Kennebec
was developed using a callus culture system (Ochatt et al., 1999). Callus cells were
subjected to recurrent selection on medium salinized with 150 mM NaCl followed by
adventitious regeneration in the continued presence of NaCl. A sensitive caliclone was
produced through recurrent selection and regeneration on control medium without NaCl.
Selected tolerant and sensitive caliclones were multiplied on medium without salt for
8 years prior to transfer to the greenhouse. Clone 150 that performed well when exposed
to 150 mM NaCl in culture did not grow well when exposed to iso-osmotic levels of
PEG-600 in culture but performed well when watered with 90 mM NaCl in the greenhouse.
Clone 150 demonstrated stable salinity tolerance maintained over many years. It was
different both phenotypically (more lobed leaves, oval tubers with reddish periderm and
flesh compared with yellow periderm and flesh of Kennebec or the sensitive clone) and

432

Donnelly et al.

genotypically (polymorphic for 1 of 70 primers used for RAPDs) from the sensitive
clone. Comparative growth analysis using salinized (100 mM NaCl) hydroponic culture
distinguished the two clones after 28 but not 14 days. Clone 150 had greater fresh and
dry weights than the sensitive clone and greater relative accumulation rate of water at
all salt levels tested. The sensitive clone accumulated very high levels of Na
and high
levels of K
into both roots and shoots
(Marconi et al., 2001).

and K

Later work determined that chlorophyll concentration was reduced in the salt-sensitive
clone but not clone 150 (Benavides et al., 2000). Glutathione concentration and all
enzymatic activities measured (SOD, APOX, GR, DHAR and CAT) were constitutively
elevated in clone 150 compared with the sensitive clone grown at 0 mM NaCl. Under
salt challenge (100 or 150 mM NaCl) chlorophyll concentration and antioxidant param-
eters were unaffected in clone 150. However, in the sensitive clone, chlorophyll levels
were reduced, antioxidant defence enzyme levels were reduced or unaltered, and salinity
damage was apparent. Acquired salt tolerance appears to have resulted from improved
resistance to oxidative stress through increased soluble and enzymatic antioxidant systems.
The relationship between antioxidant defence systems and salinity tolerance could possibly
be exploited as a screening tool to further increase salinity tolerance. In 1999, clone 150
was under evaluation for economic relevance. To the best of our knowledge this clone
has not been released.

Spontaneously occurring somaclonal variation has led to many reports of salt-tolerant
or salt-resistant plant cells, usually with no increase in the salinity tolerance of plants
derived from these cells (Tal, 1990). There are a few reports of acquisition of salinity
tolerance in potato cells through somaclonal techniques. Potato cells selected for resistance
to proline analogues were relatively more resistant to stress, including cold and salt
stress (van Swaaij et al., 1986). Potato callus and suspension cultures were selected with
improved resistance to NaCl and mannitol (Sabbah and Tal, 1990). However, these studies
did not lead to recovery of salt-tolerant plants (Tal, 1996). More recently, somatic embryos
were reliably produced from a range of potato tissues, genotypes and ploidy levels
(Seabrook and Douglass, 2001; Seabrook et al., 2001). These techniques should have
application in the development of commercially interesting salinity tolerant intraclones
of established cultivars or wild species.

Shepard et al. (1980) were first to demonstrate the possibilities of wide hybridization
using protoplast fusion in potato breeding. Only recently, this technology has been applied
in the development of potato plants with stress tolerance. Plantlets of salt-tolerant S. vernei
(origin unstated), the drought-tolerant S. tuberosum cv. Sahel, drought- and salt sensitive
S. tuberosum cv. Belle de Fontenay and disease-resistant S. stenotomum (PI#1234013),
as well as two somatic hybrids made from fusing cells of cv. Belle de Fontenay and
S. stenotomum, were challenged in vitro with salt (200 mM) or PEG (10% PEG 8000) for
2, 24 or 48 h (Akossiwoa Quashie et al., 2004). Various enzymes and aquaporins were
examined that might distinguish biochemically or physiologically between osmotic and
salinity stress in micropropagated plantlets. Preliminary results suggested that aquaporin

Towards the development of salt-tolerant potato

433

expression may be useful in distinguishing stress responses. Aquaporin expression is
initially reduced under salinity stress and is thought to explain resistance to osmotic
stress – as a mechanism of reducing water loss and excluding sodium. In halophytes, aqua-
porin expressin is less affected. In the presence of salt stress, the salinity tolerant S. vernei
initially showed little disturbance of plasma membrane aquaporins of either 26 or 19 kDa
but after some time, overexpression occurred in the 19-kDa group. Hybrids with inter-
mediate tolerance over-expressed aquaporins in the 17–19-kDa range, but the 26-kDa
aquaporins were not affected. In response to osmotic stress, it was the 26-kDa aquaporin
that was affected; less in the drought-tolerant cv. Sahel than in the other genotypes.

Nabors (1990) provides a comprehensive discussion of the constraints slowing the use
of tissue culture selection. He pointed out the need for relative growth measurements
compared with control cells for putatively tolerant cells grown on salinized medium and
the necessity for regeneration of putatively tolerant cells to plantlets for demonstration of
stable and inheritable tolerance. The latter does not apply to many cultivated potato. He
also suggested that a working link be established between laboratories that identify stress-
tolerant germplasm and plant breeders capable of field-testing this material. Without this
link, potentially useful germplasm and much scientific effort will be wasted. Fifteen years
later, there is still no obvious mechanism in place for this type of communication or help
available for testing putatively salinity tolerant potato. It would certainly seem appropriate
that scientists who feel they have produced a salinity tolerant plant communicate with a
germplasm repository to assist them in preserving this material. In addition, plant breeders
working on salinity tolerance in potato should identify themselves to one of the potato
germplasm repositories. Coordinates of these plant breeders could be clearly posted on
the website to facilitate transfer of the material for suitable field-testing and incorporation
into a breeding program.

20.8.5 Obtaining salinity tolerant potato through genetic engineering

Some scientists believe that salinity tolerance of crop plants must be accompanied by
plant transformation (Bohnert and Jensen, 1996). The basis for this argument is that lack
of success through conventional breeding may have resulted from outdated concepts.
For potato, we can safely conclude that the basis for failure in achieving salinity toler-
ance has involved the complexity of this multigenic characteristic, the apparent lack of
outstanding salinity tolerance in wild Solanum species, the lack of coordinated effort and
the modest effort invested to date.

Molecular engineering has resulted in major improvements in salinity tolerance in
model plants such as Arabidopsis (reviewed in Apse and Blumwald, 2002; Ward et al.,
antiporter
2003). Some of these traits, such as overexpression of a vacuolar Na
protein has now been transferred to tomato, which has become a model species for
pyramiding quantitative trait loci (QTL) through marker-assisted selection (reviewed by
Foolad, 2004). The development of commercial cultivars of tomato with salinity tolerance
is almost at hand; breeding efforts are far ahead of studies with potato and may serve as
a beacon of hope in the development of potato with salinity tolerance.

20.9 SUMMARY

Salinity is a serious threat to world agriculture that may intensify under proposed global
warming scenarios. Potato is widely grown around the world and some of these growing
areas are threatened by increase in salinity levels and increase in the saline land area. An
integrated approach involving engineering and improved cultural management as well as
increased salinity tolerance of potato genotypes is necessary. This chapter summarizes the
little that is known of water and fertiliser management for potato growing under salinity
stress and how climatic conditions modulate salinity effects on potato. In 2006, there
were no known commercially important S. tuberosum cultivars with outstanding salinity
tolerance. For this reason, emphasis must be placed on improved water management
techniques for potato production. This will become increasingly important in the context
of predicted climate change.

Efforts to classify and evaluate the salinity tolerance of cultivars and wild species in the
field and in vitro are reviewed as is the scanty literature on salinity tolerance mechanisms
specific to potato. The one physiological parameter that has been studied to any extent in
potato is proline accumulation. However, correlations between relative salinity tolerance
and proline levels were inconsistent both in field and in in vitro studies.

Breeding for salinity tolerance in potato may draw on a wealth of wild Solanum species
and accessions held in germplasm repositories around the world. The web coordinates
for the major repositories of potato germplasm are listed; only the CGN (Netherlands)
provides evaluation criteria for salt tolerance and lists salt-tolerant genotypes. Some
wild species with relative salinity tolerance have been suggested as potentially useful
to breeding efforts, but only a few accessions of these were tested. However, it should
be noted that no wild Solanum species have been found with salinity tolerance levels
beyond that of some cultivars. In vitro testing has been well correlated with results from
field or lysimeter studies but is labour intensive and time consuming. Numerous growth
parameters must be measured at various growth stages and salt levels; tolerance at one
growth stage or salt level was not necessarily predictive of tolerance at other growth
stages or salt concentrations.

Few studies have examined the relationship between salt tolerance and other abiotic
stress tolerances in potato. Independent screening for various abiotic stresses will be
necessary. Screening at the cell level has not usually led to expression of salt tolerance
in regenerated plants. A notable exception involved a somatic variant with excellent
salinity tolerance regenerated from salt-tolerant potato callus (Ochatt et al., 1999). Some
mechanisms of tolerance in this clone involved improved resistance to oxidative stress
in shoots and roots
(Benavides et al., 2000) and less accumulation of Na
(Marconi et al., 2001). Recent improvements in somatic cell technology (Seabrook and
Douglass, 2001; Seabrook et al., 2001) may increase the likelihood of identifying a
somaclonal variant with improved salinity tolerance that also has suitable commercial
characteristics. The same may be said for protoplast fusion technologies that have recently
led to the development of potato plants with increased stress tolerance (Akossiwoa
Quashie et al., 2004). In the near future, we are likely to see these two in vitro technologies
more fully exploited for the development of salinity tolerance in potato. Ideally, we
would see them coupled to in vitro screening systems that are less cumbersome than

at present. Molecular engineering has resulted in major improvements in salinity tolerance
of Arabidopsis (Apse and Blumwald, 2002; Ward et al., 2003) and tomato; commercial
cultivars of tomato with salinity tolerance will soon be available (Foolad, 2004). These
major advances will also lend impetus to the development of potato with salinity tolerance.

21.1 INTRODUCTION

The importance of the potato as one of the world’s major staple crops is increasingly
being recognized because it produces more dry matter (DM) and protein per hectare than
the major cereal crops (Burton, 1989).

Globally, production (2005) is an estimated 321 million tonne per annum (FAOSTAT,
2006) from an area of 18.6 million hectares. Average production in the 5-year period
2001–05 was 16.76 tonnes per hectare compared with 12.34 tonnes per hectare for the
period 1961–65. The largest producer in the world is China with 73 million tonnes (2005);
Europe and the Russian Federation account for about 40% of the world hectares harvested
and about 40% production. Within the EU, Germany and Poland are the largest producers,
each with about 11 million tonnes, but there is a large amount used for animal stock-feed.
Ireland, Portugal and Great Britain have per capita consumption about 100 kg per annum.
Overall, in Europe, consumption of fresh potatoes is greater than that of processed potato
products. By contrast, North America has a higher proportion of processed consumption,
and although it has less than 2.5% of global area, the USA accounts for 6% of production.
Despite a global production increase over the past 45 years of some 50 million tonnes, the
area has declined from an average of approximately 21.9 million hectare in 1960–65 to a
current area of 18.6 million hectare. This increased productivity per unit area, however,
has been offset by a population increase from 3.1 to 6.4 billion people, and hence globally,
per capita availability of potatoes has decreased by almost 40%.

With a burgeoning global population, the International Potato Centre (CIP) aims to
increase potato production further, particularly in subtropical and highland tropical regions
throughout the world and also in the developing countries to meet UN Millenium Targets
(CIP, 2003). The nutritional value of the crop is the key driver for this growth, linked to
the economic benefits it can bring to developing economies, and provides the international
impetus for breeding programmes and improving production technologies.

In contrast to many developing countries where the nutritional status of the potato is
the key driver, there is increasing sophistication in developed economies in the market
for fresh potatoes and increasing consumption of processed potato products including
chips (crisps in the UK), French fries and an increasingly wide range of frozen and
chilled products. This is being driven by the changing lifestyles of consumers who are
looking for greater convenience. The opportunities presented by new culinary experiences

and changed eating patterns, more snacking, are resulting in a higher proportion of out-
of-home consumption. The food service sector is of increasing importance, and in the
UK, it represents approximately 50%, with the balance from retail sales. Whilst the
consumer drive for convenience is happening, there is also greater awareness of issues
such as obesity and the increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and the value of potatoes
in a healthy balanced diet is being promoted. Several national programmes have been
developed around the ‘five-a-day’ type initiative, some of them including potatoes in the
count, others categorizing potatoes as a starchy carbohydrate within the ‘balanced plate’
(Produce for Better Health Foundation, USA, http://www.5aday.org; UK Department of
Health, http://www.5aday.nhs.uk).

Consumers’ requirements for fresh market potatoes are often associated with the visual
characteristics such as the shape and appearance of the tuber with good freedom from
defects and disorders. Blemish diseases such as silver scurf (Helminthosporium solani) and
black dot (Colletotrichum coccodes) may be superficial and detract from the appearance
but not necessarily the culinary acceptability of the potato. The culinary qualities are
increasingly important in differentiating potato products in a commodity market. For
the processed potato crop, the size and uniformity of the harvested crop, in terms of
for example tuber shape, dry matter (DM) content or reducing sugar level, is crucial to
product-manufacturing efficiency. Defects resulting from harvest and handling – damage
and bruising – detract from crop quality for all markets.

End-use acceptability for markets is also influenced by quality characteristics associated
with preparation and cooking attributes. These include enzymic browning resulting from
the oxidation of tyrosine (Storey and Davies, 1992) and the non-enzymic, after-cooking
blackening, also known as stem-end blackening. This results from chlorogenic acid com-
bining with iron during cooking to form a complex that is oxidized on cooling to give
the coloured ferri-dichlorogenic acid responsible for the blue-grey discolouration at the
normal pH (6.0–6.5) of cooked potatoes (Hughes and Swain, 1962a,b). These attributes,
together with taste and flavour, which are increasingly important to the consumer, are
covered in detail elsewhere (Chapter 23, Sowokinos, this volume).

The nutritional value of the crop is a major impetus for breeding and development
programmes in developing countries and also from a consumer’s perspective in more
sophisticated markets. Improved protein content and nutritional value can be affected
by growth and development and by subsequent storage (Chapter 24, Taylor et al., this
volume). This chapter therefore considers the nutritionally important characteristics of
the harvested crop and some of the morphological and biochemical aspects associated
with quality and defects that affect suitability for the market place.

21.2 NUTRITIONAL VALUE

The chemical composition of the potato is fairly conservative, and variation depends
largely on the genetic features of the variety, although tubers of the same variety, and even
tubers from the same plant, can vary in levels of particular contents. The chemical com-
position is also affected by environmental conditions during production and subsequent
storage of the crop.

The harvested crop

443

Analyses of the nutritional value have been carried out for many years and have been
reported in several reviews (e.g. Woolfe, 1987; Burton, 1989; Lisi´nska and Leszczy´nski,
1989; Burton et al., 1992).

Carbohydrates, which constitute about 75% of the total DM, are the main energy
source, and the potato provides significant amounts of protein, vitamins and dietary fibre.
Overall, the harvested potato is a very good source of vitamin C (ascorbic acid), with the
average 175 g serving providing 44% of Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA), a good
source of vitamins B6 (29%) and B1 (16%), a source of folate (16%), and potato also
provides potassium, iron and magnesium for the diet (BPC, 2004).

The energy value of boiled potatoes, 72–75 kcal, is about only half of that of rice
(138 kcal) and pasta (159 kcal) and about one-third of that of bread (207–219 kcal). The
almost total absence of fat in potatoes, which has twice the calorific value of carbohydrate,
means that a considerable amount of boiled potato would need to be eaten to meet total
daily energy requirements. However, the potato’s total contribution to diet depends on
the cooking method. Roast and chipped potatoes act as a carrier for absorbed and surface
fat, and with the dehydration that results from the cooking process, these preparations
have a higher calorific value. A summary of nutritional information (FSA, 2002) used
for potatoes in dietary assessments in the UK is given in Table 21.1.

The potato is one of the richest sources of antioxidants in the human diet (Lachman and
Hamouz, 2005). The main antioxidants are polyphenols (123–441 mg/100 g), ascorbic acid
(8–54 mg/100 g), carotenoids (up to 0.4 mg/100 g) and tocopherols (up to 0.3 mg/100 g).
l-Tyrosine, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid are amongst the main polyphe-
nols, which have about twice the level in the skin compared with the flesh of the potato.
Flavonoids are especially effective antioxidants (Bors and Saran, 1987). In the USA,
potato consumption ensures a daily intake of about 64 mg polyphenols, which places
potatoes second to tomatoes (Al-Saikhan et al., 1995).

Potato is also an important source of dietary fibre, and a 175 g serving contributes
about 14% of UK’s daily requirement. This, together with the energy that potato provides,
the important vitamin contribution, the quality of the tuber protein and the nutritional
benefits of antioxidants, means that potato, as a recognized starchy carbohydrate, is an
important dietary component in many parts of the world.

21.3 DRY MATTER

The DM content of most varieties selected for commercial usage ranges from about 18 to
26% (Burton, 1989); it is an important aspect of tuber quality and is affected by a wide
range of factors, including most importantly, environmental factors during growth of the
crop and development of the tuber, such as intercepted solar radiation, soil temperatures,
available soil moisture and cultural treatments. See Chapters 17 (Haverkort, this volume)
and 16 (Vos and Haverkort, this volume) and the study by Allen and Scott (2001) for
a description of the agronomic principles involved in DM production and accumulation
and the practical management of DM content in potato crops. In general, cool dull
years and short growing seasons reduce DM production, whilst the reverse occurs in
warm, sunny locations with long growing seasons and an adequate water supply. DM
accumulates during growth of the crop, and tuber DM content often declines from a peak
after defoliation of the haulm if the root systems remain active in moist soils (Wilcoxon
et al., 1985). There is variation in the level of DM accumulated between tubers within a
crop and within individual tubers (Gaze et al., 1998; Kumar and Ezekiel, 2004).

The variation can have a considerable impact on the end-user acceptability for both
the fresh and the processed markets. The DM content and distribution has implications
for bruise susceptibility during harvest and effects on cooking type, e.g. a waxy or mealy
texture when boiled, organoleptic characteristics and, in processed potatoes, the final
product texture (Chapter 24, Taylor et al., this volume).

The level of DM is generally highest in the storage parenchyma between the cortex
and the vascular ring, is lower for the periderm and cortex and decreases towards the
pith, and longitudinally, the stolon end is usually higher than the rose end (Fig. 21.1).

The specific gravity (SG) of tubers, determined from the underwater weight of a
sample or by hydrometer readings, is extensively used as a measure of DM, and this
often provides an indication of the suitability of the crop for a particular, e.g. processing,
usage. With the methods used, anything that affects the density of the water or solution
(e.g. temperature or suspended solids) must be accounted for. The relationship between
SG and percentage of DM is usually described as linear, but several authors have obtained
different regression equations for this relationship (Lisi´nska and Leszczy´nski, 1989).
Differences are reported for cultivars (Vanesse et al., 1951) and on crops grown under
different environmental conditions (Schippers, 1976). Varietal differences may, in part,
be the result of differences in the intercellular spaces or the composition of the DM, and
internal disorders such as hollow heart can affect measurements. The SG can also provide
an estimate of the starch content of the tubers, which is the major component of the tuber
DM and usually constitutes about 65–75% of total solids.

The DM content of early maturing cultivars is usually lower than that of mature full

season crops. The total DM content of a tuber is made up of different components.

21.3.1 Carbohydrates

21.3.1.1 Starch

Starch is the main component of the tuber DM content. The starch is a polymer of
glucose molecules and occurs in two main forms, amylose, which is a linear chain of

glucose monomers linked by 1,4-glycosidic bonds, and amylopectin, in which the chains
are branched by the addition of 1,6-glycosidic bonds. Potato starch is about 20% amylose,
the balance being amylopectin. There are several forms of starch synthase, and these
are grouped into two classes of soluble and granule-bound starch synthase. Shewmaker
and Stalker (1992) reported that the granule-bound starch synthase is responsible for
the synthesis of amylose. The pathways for sucrose degradation and starch synthesis are
well known, the enzymes mediating it are well characterized and most genes encoding
them have been cloned (Geigenberger, 2003). Teissen et al. (2002) provided evidence
for a novel mechanism involving post-translational regulation acting through redox-
modification of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase that regulates the rate of starch synthesis
in response to sugars.

During crop development, starch accumulates in amyloplasts within tuber cells forming
single or complex granules with size ranging from approximately 15 to 75 (cid:3)m. The starch
granules contain alternating zones of semi-crystalline and amorphous material known
as growth rings. Both diurnal and circadian rhythms have previously been suggested as
contributing to the development of the rings (Buttrose, 1962) by changing the relative
activities of the starch-synthesizing enzymes, but Pilling and Smith (2003) recently sug-
gested that there was a more complex interplay with physical mechanisms and speculated
that this was due to the structured packing arrangements of the branched amylopectin
molecules. It has been suggested that differences in starch rheological properties may
partly explain differences in organoleptic qualities (Dobson et al., 2004), and the starch
structure will have a bearing on these properties. The starch distribution in the tuber

446

Storey

is uneven, generally following that of the total DM content with the lowest levels in the
medullary tissue of the pith. The influence of starch levels on the quality parameters may
also be mediated through cell size as higher starch content is associated with larger cell
sizes (Chen and Liao, 1993), and these follow trends in DM concentration with tuber size
and the increase from apical to stolon end.

The structural composition of the starch and the grain number, size and distribution
within the tuber cells have implications for several quality factors, including bruise
susceptibility of tubers and crop acceptability in both the fresh and the processed sectors
(Chapter 6, van Eck, this volume) where authors make associations with the mealiness
of cooked potato, the mash quality and the texture of finished product, e.g. bite and
mouth feel of chips (crisps). Modification of the amylose: amylopectin ratio, of chain
lengths, or increasing the level of starch biosynthesis offers the potential to modify these
characteristics for both consumer and industrial attributes.

With recent attention (BPC, 2004) on the nutritional quality of the diet, and in particular
the contribution of carbohydrates, the focus is on the potato because of its relatively high
starch content and its Glycaemic Index (GI) contribution.

21.3.1.2 Glycaemic Index

The GI (Jenkins et al., 1981) is a classification of the blood glucose-raising potential of
carbohydrate foods. It is defined as the incremental area under the blood glucose curve
of a 50-g carbohydrate portion of a test food expressed as a percentage of the response
to 50 g of carbohydrate of a standard (reference) food taken by the same subject, on a
different day (FAO/WHO, 1998).

Carbohydrate foods produce different glycaemic responses depending on many factors,
such as particle size, cooking and food processing, other food components (e.g. fat, protein
and dietary fibre) and starch structure (Bjorck et al., 1994). The principle is that the
slower the rate of carbohydrate absorption, the lower the rise of blood glucose level and
the lower the GI value (Augustin et al., 2002). Indeed, high-GI foods are characterized
by fast-release carbohydrate and higher blood glucose levels. A GI value≤ 55 is low,
a GI value 56–69 inclusive is medium and a GI value≥ 70 is considered high (where
glucose=100).

The GI of foods may have important implications for the prevention and treatment of
the major causes of morbidity and mortality in Western countries, and recent data support
the preventive potential of a low-GI diet against the development of type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease (Frost et al., 1999; Meyer et al., 2000).

Potatoes generally have one of the highest GI values of any food, although some
varieties appear to be lower than others (Table 21.2). Published GI values for boiled
potatoes are highly variable. A GI value range of 56–101 for boiled potatoes, where the
type of potato has been specified, and a GI value range of 23–76 for unspecified potato
varieties have been reported (Foster-Powell et al., 2002). GI values related to preparation
also need to be interpreted with care as variety is usually not identified, with reports of
GI ranging across new potatoes 57, white skinned mash 70, French fries 75, baked 85,
instant mash 86 and red-skinned boiled 88 (K. Brown, 2006, personal communication).
As varieties have different starch levels, it is necessary to clarify the GI of different
varieties of potatoes as they make a considerable contribution to total starch intake in the

diet. The GI values of seven commercially available potato varieties in the UK ranged
from 56 to 94 (medium to high), and all were similar in their satiating capacities (Henry
et al., 2005). Other workers found no difference in GI values between three varieties
(Sebago, Pontiac and Desiree) of potato (Soh and Brand-Miller, 1999). However, it has
been demonstrated that young or ‘new’ potatoes have a lower GI than more mature
potatoes, which may be attributed to differences in starch structure. If a low-GI potato
variety can be identified, it could be used to lower the overall glycaemic load of the
western diet and thus decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and
obesity.

The high-GI rating for potato has been seen as a disadvantage in comparison with
other carbohydrate foods, but as potatoes are rarely eaten alone, the GI rating of a meal is
more appropriate, and the addition of toppings to baked potatoes, e.g. cheese, can reduce
GI classification from high (cid:4)93± 8(cid:5) to low (cid:4)39± 5(cid:5) (Henry et al., 2006).

21.3.1.3 Sugars

The sugar content of potatoes is variable depending on variety and physiological status of
the tuber, and the relative contributions and levels of the different sugars change during
crop development and subsequent storage. The main sugars present are the monosac-
charides, glucose (0.15–1.5%) and fructose (0.15–1.5%), which are reducing sugars, and
sucrose (0.4–6.6%), a non-reducing disaccharide. The dynamics of the change in sugar
levels during tuber development vary between varieties, but when tubers reach maturity,
the ratio of sucrose to reducing sugars reaches a minimum value. The management of
sugars for harvest and during storage is a particular concern for the processing sector,
where high levels of reducing sugars can make crops unacceptable for processing. This is
due to a typical Maillard reaction between the reducing sugars and the (cid:6)-amino groups of
nitrogenous compounds (Schallenberger et al., 1959). The level of reducing sugars that
are generally acceptable for processing for chips is 0.2–0.3% and for French fries is
0.3–0.5%, although fry colour charts, e.g. USDA, IBVL or British Potato Council (BPC),
are used to determine colour acceptability. The sugar content of the harvested crop is
also important for the fresh market, and sucrose levels above 1% fresh weight (FW)
are reported to give an unacceptably sweet taste to the boiled potatoes. This sweetening
is more likely to occur after a period of storage, particularly at holding temperatures

448

(cid:4)

(below 4
C) that promote low-temperature sweetening. Conversely, it has been reported
for cultivars Carlingford and Maris Peer that the increased sucrose levels after low tem-
C(cid:5) and modified atmosphere 5% O2/5% CO2 storage (up to 1.8% FW for
perature (cid:4)3(cid:2)5
cultivar Carlingford) are not reflected in tasting assessments (Mawson, 1998). However,
with all taste perceptions, a range of genetic, physiological and metabolic variables can
influence consumer acceptability (Drewnowski, 1997), and it is important to relate any
preferences to the characteristics of the test group. The low-temperature accumulation of
sugars may be reduced by reconditioning the crop for a period of time (2–6 weeks) at
an elevated holding temperature (Storey and Davies, 1992). Senescent sweetening is an
irreversible accumulation of reducing sugars resulting from prolonged storage and cannot
be ameliorated by reconditioning. Variety selection and management of the sucrose levels
in the crop at harvest, with monitoring of conditions in store, minimize the risk of adverse
effects (Chapter 23, Sowokinos, this volume).

21.3.1.4 Crude fibre and dietary fibre

The cell wall and intercellular components of the tuber, which are mainly cellulose, hemi-
cellulose, pentosans and pectic substances, are often termed crude fibre and contribute
about 2.3% of the tuber weight.

Dietary fibre consists of the insoluble and soluble polysaccharides associated with
the cell wall, but also lignin and resistant starch. The dietary fibre is not digested by
enzymes of the small intestine, and so is ‘non-available’; however, some components
may be fermented by micro-organisms in the large intestine. The distribution of dietary
fibre is not uniform, and cooking the potatoes and the resulting pectin breakdown may
change some of the fibre properties and the amount of resistant starch. During cooking,
the apparent level of dietary fibre increases. The skin of the tuber contains more dietary
fibre than the flesh, for example 22.6% dry basis for micro-waved skin compared with
7.5% dry basis for micro-waved flesh (Mullin and Smith, 1991).

21.3.2 Protein

The protein content of potatoes is in the range 1.7–2.1 g per 100 g of FW for boiled new
(in skin) and maincrop potatoes. Because there is a low total protein content on a FW
basis, potatoes are not usually considered as a protein source compared with other foods;
however, in countries with a high per capita consumption of total potato, they can make
a significant nutritional contribution to the diet because of its high nutritional value. This
high quality of the dietary nitrogen means that potatoes can supply a high proportion of
international RDA for children and adults and 100 g of boiled potato supplies 8–13% of
FAO/WHO RDA of nitrogen for children and 6–7% for adults, respectively. In the UK,
potatoes have been estimated to contribute 3.4% of protein intake compared with 4.6, 4.8
and 5.8% from eggs, fish and cheese.

The major potato tuber protein, patatin (Racusen and Foote, 1980) is a family of
40–42 kDa glycoproteins that constitute 40% of the soluble protein in tubers but is
generally undetectable in other tissues. It has been characterized as an esterase enzyme
complex (Park, 1983). There are also three abundant proteins with approximate molecular

masses of 22, 23 and 24 kDa (Suh et al., 1990). Potato tuber protein contains high
levels of the essential amino acids – lysine, leucine, threonine, phenylalanine and valine
(Table 21.3). However, there are lower concentrations of sulphur amino acids – methionine
and cysteine (Woolfe, 1987). This means that foods low in lysine, e.g. pasta and rice,
can be supplemented in mixed diets with potatoes to provide an improved amino acid
balance in the diet.

21.3.2.1 Amino acids

The quality of the protein depends on the amount and quantity of different amino acids
and can be measured by its biological value. This is a measure of how much body nitrogen
can be formed if renewed by 100 g of absorbed food nitrogen. If the protein provides all
that is required for protein synthesis at a rate equal to protein turnover, then the biological
value is 100. The standard is whole chicken egg protein. A comparison of potato protein
with other sources is summarized in Table 21.4, and this also shows that because of the

high quality of potato protein, combination with other protein sources can improve the
overall biological value of the food.

Manipulation of amino acid levels for the harvested crop can potentially enhance the
nutritional quality of tubers. Increased levels of free methionine (2.66 times that of Russet
Burbank control) have been produced in tubers of selected protoclones grown from regen-
erated callus, which was derived from leaf protoplasts cultured in the amino acid analogue
ethionine (Langille et al., 1998). Labelling approaches, such as those used by Roessner-
Tunali et al. (2004) using incubation in 13C isotopes with GC-MS, have provided signifi-
cant information on the pathways and kinetics of sugars, organic acids and amino acids that
will help understanding the effects of manipulating particular systems either through con-
ventional breeding or transgenic approaches. Comparisons using transgenic lines exhibit-
ing enhanced sucrose mobilization or where sucrose supply to tubers was restricted by
environmental perturbation has provided evidence of partitioning towards several amino
acids, with de novo biosynthesis being regulated by sucrose levels (Roessner-Tunali et al.,
2003). Analysis of proteome diversity (Lehesranta et al., 2005), investigated with the
application of ‘omic’ technologies, has demonstrated clear and qualitative differences in
protein patterns of a range of varieties and landraces with over 95% of 1111 protein
spots analysed showing significant differences. The potential of such methods to estab-
lish intended or detect unintentional effects of modifications is apparent, as in the same
analysis much less variation was found between genetically modified (GM) lines and
their non-GM controls, where only nine proteins of 730 showed significant differences.
The organic nitrogen fraction in tubers contains the free amino acids and amides,
glutamine and asparagine. The free amino acid pool accounts for about 40–60% of the
total nitrogen, and the factors affecting protein content, such as variety and crop maturity
and fertiliser usage, also affect the levels of free amino acids and amides. Attention has
been given to these effects on asparagine levels and more particularly on reducing sugar
levels in the harvested crop and during subsequent storage because of their key role in the
Maillard reaction as precursors for acrylamide formation (Mottram et al., 2002; Stadler
et al., 2002).

21.3.2.2 Acrylamide

Acrylamide was reported as occurring in baked and fried foods by the Swedish National
Food Administration (Tareke et al., 2002), and as a probable human carcinogen (IARC,
1994), there has been concern about the implication of acrylamide in the diet. However,
population-based case–control studies have found no positive association between acry-
lamide food exposure and cancer risk, nor have any increases in cancer been identified in
cohort studies of humans occupationally exposed to acrylamide, with only one possible
exception of an increase in pancreatic cancer (Marsh et al., 1999). Acrylamide forms in
carbohydrate-rich foods cooked (baked and fried) at temperatures of above 120
C, but it
has not been detected in boiled foods (Table 21.5).

(cid:4)

Although the mechanism is not yet fully understood, the Maillard reaction, in particular
a reaction between the amino acid asparagine and reducing sugars, accounts for most
acrylamide production (Mottram et al., 2002; Stadler et al., 2002). However, in potato,
more acrylamide is formed for a given concentration of sugars and asparagine than with

wheat flour or cornstarch, which led Mottram et al. (2002) to suggest that other factors,
such as availability of ammonia, may be involved. In the harvested potato crop, as the
concentration of reducing sugars is the most important factor influencing acrylamide
formation, limiting the levels is an option for reducing cooking-mediated acrylamide for-
mation. Selection of cultivars with low sugar levels and subsequent storage management
to limit sugar accumulation provides a major opportunity to reduce acrylamide formation
(BPC, 2001). Other mitigation measures can include reducing concentrations of the reac-
tants during early stages of food processing, minimizing heating conditions that result in
excessive heat/low moisture conditions and modifying the thermal profile of the cooking
process, all of which are being actively adopted by the potato industry (CIAA, 2005).

21.3.3 Vitamins

Vitamin C is the main vitamin in potatoes. Global dietary contribution of vitamin C
from potatoes is important with an estimated 40% of daily-recommended intake (OECD,
2002). It is present in both the reduced state as ascorbic acid and in the oxidized state as
dehydroascorbic acid (12–15%). There is a wide range of vitamin C in tubers, with the
usual range for freshly harvested tubers reported as 10–25 mg/100 g FW. Brown (2005)
reported an average level of 20 mg/100 g FW, which may account for up to 13% of the
total antioxidant capacity of the tuber. The highest levels of vitamin C are found in the
central pith region (25–29 mg/100 g FW) rather than in the outer cortex (22–26 mg/100 g
FW) (Munshi and Mondy, 1989).

There are significant differences between cultivars and germplasm, and Tarn (2005),
reviewing the heritability estimates that range from 0.45 for narrow-sense heritability
(Sinden et al., 1978) to 0.71 for broad-sense heritability (Love et al., 2004), suggested
that as the interaction between genotype and environment is low, there is potential to
exploit this and increase ascorbic acid levels and improve the nutritional status of tubers.
Storage is known to reduce vitamin C content, but not all varieties show the same
rate of decline during holding (Dale et al., 2003). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated
by Davies et al. (2002) that a Solanum phureja × Solanum tuberosum hybrid retained
a two-fold higher level of ascorbic acid after storage, and this identifies the opportunity
that could be exploited using novel germplasm in breeding programmes.

a Freshly dug potatoes contain average 21 mg/100 g FW. This falls to 9 mg/100 g FW, after 3 months storage
and to 7 mg after 9 months storage.

The GM modification of the starch component (a higher amylopectin: amylose ratio)
of cultivar Prevalent has also resulted in increased levels of vitamin C [67 mg/100 g in the
altered line (EH92-527-1) compared with 49 mg/100 g in the parental line (EFSA, 2006)].
Although this difference is significant, a change is not unexpected given the alteration in
carbohydrate metabolism and it is within the background ranges reported in the literature.
The other vitamins that occur in the potato, mostly in the vitamin B group, are at
much lower concentrations than vitamin C (Table 21.6), but they can make a significant
contribution to daily nutritional requirements.

21.3.4 Allergens and anti-nutritionals

21.3.4.1 Allergens

Potatoes are not usually considered a source of allergens. Cooked potato is usually well
tolerated, but adverse reactions have been documented for both raw and cooked potatoes
(Quirce et al., 1989; Majamaa et al., 2001). This is because both heat-labile and heat-stable
allergens can be present, and although thermal processes largely inactivate the protease
inhibitors, anti-nutritional reactions can occur if raw or inadequately cooked potatoes are
consumed or fed. Allergic reactions, including atopic dermatitis, induced by patatin have
also been reported in sensitive children (Seppälä et al., 1999).

21.3.4.2 Protease inhibitors

The protease inhibitors found in potatoes inhibit the activity of trypsin, chymotrypsin and
other proteases, decreasing the digestibility and biological value of ingested protein. They
represent approximately 50% of the total soluble proteins in potato juice of cultivar Elkana
(Pouvreau et al., 2003) and have been classified into seven different families: potato
inhibitor (PI)-1, PI-2, potato cysteine protease inhibitor (PCPI), potato aspartate protease
inhibitor (PAPI), potato Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (PKPI), potato carboxypeptidase
inhibitor (PCI) and ‘other serine protease inhibitors’. The most abundant families were the
PI-2 and PCPI families, representing 22 and 12% of all proteins in potato juice, respec-
tively. Exposure to light, sufficient to induce greening over a 20-day period, did not alter
the levels of inhibitors in cultivar White Rose (Dao and Friedman, 1994).

21.3.4.3 Lectins

Potato lectin, sourced from cultivar King Edward, is a glycoprotein that contains about
47% (by weight) l-arabinose, 3% d-galactose and 11% hydroxyproline (Allen et al.,
1978). The lectins have a common property of binding to specific carbohydrate structures
on cell surfaces, e.g. on intestinal or blood cells, and some, e.g. from beans, are known
to cause serious health effects when ingested by humans or animals. However, heating
inactivates them and only consumption of raw or inadequately cooked potato may have an
adverse effect. Based on the sequencing of a complete cDNA encoding a potato lectin, the
molecular structure has been determined and has provided insight into the physiological
role of Solanaceae lectins (Van Damme et al., 2004).

21.3.5 Glycoalkaloids

Glycoalkaloids occur in nearly all potato tissues. Structurally, one or more sugar molecules
(usually three) are linked to the steroidal alkaloid solanidine. The principal glycoalkaloids
are (cid:7)-chaconine (solanidine-glucose-rhamnose-rhamnose) and (cid:7)-solanine (solanidine-
galactose-glucose-rhamnose) and generally contribute about 90–95% total glycoalkaloids
(TGAs) (Maga, 1980; Jadhev et al., 1981). Other glycoalkaloids that occur in smaller
quantities include (cid:8)-chaconine, (cid:9)-chaconine, (cid:8)1-solanine, (cid:8)2-solanine and (cid:9)-solanine.
TGA levels in most commercial crops range from 2 to 10 mg/100 g FW. Because of the
association of TGA with a bitter astringent taste and their relative toxicity, a generally
accepted safe level is 20 mg/100 g FW (Sinden and Webb, 1972), although some indi-
viduals can detect a bitter taste in tubers with levels as low as 10 mg/100 g FW. The
glycoalkaloids are not evenly distributed throughout the tuber. Higher concentrations are
at the periphery (Smith et al., 1996) and in the vicinity of the eyes. The skin, comprising
about 2–3% of the tuber, contains 30–80% of TGAs. Preparation by peeling can con-
siderably reduce levels (Haase, 2002). However, the TGA are not broken down during
cooking and frying.

Early potato varieties have reportedly higher levels of TGA, which may reflect growing
conditions, the relative immaturity and smaller size tubers in these crops (Verbist and
Monnet, 1979). Variation occurs in TGA levels between varieties, and this can be affected
by conditions during production (Sinden and Webb, 1972) and subsequently in store
(Love et al., 1994; Griffiths et al., 1997). However, in a comparison for two varieties,
Saba and Asterix, grown either conventionally or organically, no significant effects of the
type of production system were found in the TGA level of the crops (Strömberg et al.,
2004.), although Hajšlová et al. (2005) reported that elevated TGA levels occurred in some
potato varieties throughout a 4-year series of experiments grown under an organic farming
system. The (cid:7)-solanine level was about 40% of TGA content in the freshly harvested
organic crops, and this is similar to 40:60 ratio for (cid:7)-solanine: (cid:7)-chaconine reported for a
range of controlled growing conditions for cultivars Norland, Russet Burbank and Denali
(Nitithamyong et al., 1999).

High levels of TGA are found in the tuber sprouts, and there are enhanced lev-
els in greened tubers where they have been exposed to light. After harvest, the TGA
levels may be increased, and this is dependent on duration of exposure to sunlight

454

Storey

(Percival et al., 1996) or artificial light (Dale et al., 1993), with the magnitude of increase
being cultivar dependent (Griffiths et al., 1994). However, the TGA formation is inde-
pendent of greening (Gull and Isenberg, 1960), so greened tubers do not always have
high levels of TGA and vice versa. Patchett et al. (1977) report that immature tubers form
larger amounts of glycoalkaloids when exposed to light compared with mature tubers. At
harvest, bruising of tubers also increases TGA levels, and Dale et al. (1998) demonstrated
that the rates of TGA synthesis for the varieties after bruising were in good agreement
with their response to other stresses, light and low temperature. However, for one variety,
cultivar Torridon, which exhibited severe internal damage in response to the impacts, the
extensive cell death curtailed TGA and chlorogenic acid synthesis.

21.3.6 Other tuber metabolites

A review of ethno-botanical databases suggests that about 700 entries are chemicals
documented as being present in potatoes. The levels of individual metabolites are variable
and are likely to be linked to cultivar and production management. Although there is no
evidence of high-value chemicals being extracted from potato, it has the potential to be a
good source of high-value products for both food and non-food uses. Metabolite profiling
is identifying new compounds, and non-targeted metabolomics have recently identified
the occurrence of kukoamine and its allies in tubers (Parr et al., 2005). Kukoamines, found
previously only in Lycium chinense, have been associated with reduced blood pressure,
and they selectively affect a chemotherapeutic target for trypanosome diseases such as
sleeping sickness (Ponasik et al., 1995).

The compositional characteristics of the tuber affect the nutritional quality, but to
fully meet end-user requirements, morphological characteristics are also important for
consumer and processor acceptability.

21.3.7 Minerals

Minerals contribute about 1.1% of total tuber weight. Potassium is the major cation, and
the potato is a major source for the diet (Table 21.7).

Higher concentrations of potassium are found in the skin and the cell layers immediately
below the skin and levels increase during the growing season. Potassium levels in tubers
are known to have a consistent effect on levels of bruising, with crops grown with low
potassium more susceptible to bruising (Van der Zaag and Meijers, 1970).

Phosphorus has the second highest level in tubers and is present in various forms with
large amounts in inorganic compounds (12–39%) and contained within starch (20–48%).
Although there are lower levels of iron and zinc in the tuber, the potato provides an
important contribution of these elements to the diet. The iron content is also involved
in the development of after-cooking blackening, as it forms a complex during cooking
with chlorogenic acid, which then oxidizes on cooling to give the tuber tissue a blue-grey
discolouration (Hughes and Swain, 1962a,b). Selenium is present at very low levels in
tubers but does contribute to the antioxidant potential of potato (Lachman and Hamouz,
2005). Supplementing fertilisers with sodium selenate is used in Finland to increase
selenium levels in vegetables (Eurola et al., 1989), and the use of foliar selenium sprays

21.4 FLESH AND SKIN COLOUR

In many markets, consumers are becoming less discriminating about the flesh colour of
the raw potato with greater emphasis being placed on the appropriateness for its intended
end use (BPC, 2004), although there are invariably local or regional preferences. In most
of Europe, the preference for fresh market potatoes is for varieties with yellow/light-
yellow-coloured flesh. There are also very definite preferences for the processing industry,
depending on the type of product being produced. For the chip (crisp) sector, varieties
with light-yellow and yellow flesh predominate, e.g. in the UK this includes cultivars
Hermes, Saturna and Lady Rosetta, whereas for French fries, cultivars Maris Piper, Russet
Burbank and Shepody with white or cream flesh colour are preferred.

Skin colour of potatoes is also a varietal characteristic, and preferences are evident
in many countries. The skin finish is also important, and russet varieties with a netted
reddish brown skin are popular for most uses in the USA and whites and small reds are
used for boiling. In most of Europe, a cream to light-yellow skin colour is preferred,
whereas in many Arabic countries, varieties with a red skin colour are popular.

21.4.1 Carotenoids

Carotenoids are present in the flesh of all potatoes, and carotene contents in the literature
(reported by Brown, 2005) range from 50–100 (cid:3)g per 100 g FW for white-fleshed varieties
to 2000 (cid:3)g per 100 g FW in deep yellow-orange-fleshed varieties. Lu et al. (2001), exam-
ining 11 diploid clones of a hybrid breeding population and two tetraploid cultivars, Yukon

456

Storey

Gold (yellow flesh) and Superior (white flesh), showed that both total and individual
carotenoid contents are positively correlated with tuber yellow intensity. Yellow-fleshed
varieties obtain their colour from xanthophyll carotenoids. Many have been identified,
including lutein, violaxanthin, neoxanthin, antheraxanthin and (cid:8)-cryptoxanthin, with deep
yellow pigmentation due to the presence of zeaxanthin (Nesterenko and Sink, 2003;
Morris et al., 2004; Brown, 2005). There are usually just trace levels of (cid:7)- or (cid:8)-carotene
meaning that potato is not a source of pro-vitamin A carotenes.

Antioxidant activity, measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), in
a range of material with differing degrees of yellowness, with total carotenoid content
ranging from 35 to 795 (cid:3)g per 100 g FW, has ORAC values from 4.6 to 15.3 nmoles
(cid:7)-tocopherol equivalents per 100 g FW with the total carotenoid content correlated with
lipophilic ORAC values (cid:4)r = 0(cid:2)77(cid:5) (Brown et al., 2005). The antioxidant values of potato
can be enhanced by exploiting conventional breeding (Bradshaw and Ramsay, 2005) or
using transgenic approaches. Ducreux et al. (2005) produced transformed S. tuberosum L.
cultivar Desiree × phureja group cultivar Mayan Gold crosses that expressed an Erwinia
uredovora crtB gene encoding phytoene synthase. The carotenoid content increased from
approximately 5(cid:2)6 (cid:3)g carotenoid/g dry weight (DW) in the untransformed Desiree to
35 (cid:3)g carotenoid/g DW in the transgenic Desiree lines; with Mayan Gold, the increase
was typically from 20 (cid:3)g carotenoid/g DW to 78 (cid:3)g carotenoid/g DW in the most affected
transgenic line. There were also significant changes in the balance of carotenoids, with
(cid:8)-carotene in the transformed Desiree reaching approximately 11 (cid:3)g/g DW and lutein
19-fold higher than in the untransformed control. The identification of genes that are
consistently up- or down-regulated opens opportunities for improved selection of material
with higher carotenoid contents and antioxidant levels.

During tuber development and DM accumulation, carotenoids are reported to decrease
(Haynes et al., 1994), but this does not occur in all varieties, as reported by Morris et al.
(2004) for the S. tuberosum group phureja variety, Inca Dawn. During storage, levels are
stable, but there is a change in relative components.

21.4.2 Anthocyanins

Like ascorbic acid and carotenoids, anthocyanins are antioxidants and if their level can
be increased, this can add to the nutritional quality of the potato. Diets rich in antioxidant
flavonoids and carotenoids have been associated with lower incidence of atherosclerotic
heart disease, certain cancers, macular degeneration and severity of cataracts (Hertog
et al., 1993; Knekt et al., 1996; Stintzing and Carle, 2004).

The anthocyanins are responsible for the red, blue and purple colours of the skin and
flesh. In the Andes, highly coloured flesh and skin is common in potato germplasm
but deep coloured flesh has been unusual in most modern cultivated potatoes. How-
ever, because of increasing interest in antioxidants (Espin et al., 2000), this is changing
and information has been comprehensively reviewed by Lachman and Hamouz (2005).
Antioxidant levels are about two to three times higher in red- and purple-coloured flesh
varieties than in white-fleshed potato. Indeed, highly coloured flesh is exploited in selec-
tion programmes, for example in China, where it is traditionally considered to have
medicinal benefits and also within developed market economies, where flesh colours are

The harvested crop

457

used to differentiate some fresh and processed potato products, particularly chips (crisps).
Colour is retained during baking and microwaving but leaches out during boiling, as
anthocyanins are water-soluble.

Anthocyanin contents have been found to range from 2 to 40 mg/100 g FW in 33
red-fleshed breeding lines and cultivars (Rodriguez-Saona et al., 1998), and Brown et al.
(2003) reported 6.9 mg/100 g FW in red-fleshed and 5.5–17.1 mg/100 g FW in purple-
fleshed tubers, with predominantly acylated glycosides of pelargonidin in the red-fleshed
and in addition acylated glycosides of petunidin and peonidin but also malvidin and
delphinidin in the purple-fleshed tubers. The colour of their pigment depends on the
presence and number of hydroxyl and methyl groups on the molecule, and the number
of free hydroxyl groups determines the antioxidant activity, so petunidin has greater
antioxidant effects in comparison with malvidin, peonidin or pelargonidin, respectively
(Lachman and Hamouz, 2005). The hydrophilic antioxidant activity of solidly pigmented
red or purple potatoes is comparable with Brussels sprouts or spinach (Brown, 2005).
In red and purple potatoes with solidly pigmented flesh with levels of total anthocyanin
ranging from 9 to 38 mg per 100 g FW, ORAC ranged from 7.6 to 14(cid:2)2 (cid:3)mole/g FW of
Trolox equivalents.

Changes occur in total anthocyanins during tuber development, with levels during
growth reported to decrease in the cultivar Norland (Hung et al., 1997), whereas Lewis
et al. (1999), for an intensely coloured variety, Urenika, reported an almost constant level
of anthocyanin as biosynthesis matched increase in tuber weight, whereas with a less
intensely coloured variety Desiree, anthocyanin concentrations increased gradually. In
store, an increase in anthocyanin level occurred during holding of cultivars Desiree and
Arran Victory at 4

C but a decrease at 10

(cid:4)

(cid:4)

C.

Phenolic acids, such as chlorogenic acid, which can constitute about 80% of total
phenolic acids, caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid and p-coumaric acid amongst several
others have been identified in purple- and red-fleshed potatoes (Lewis et al., 1998;
Brown, 2005) and contribute to the antioxidant capacity of potatoes. There is a similarity
in phenolic composition among potato varieties irrespective of periderm colour. High
positive correlations have been found between antioxidant capacity (cid:4)R2 = 0(cid:2)879(cid:5) and
total anthocyanins (cid:4)R2 = 0(cid:2)910(cid:5) with total phenolic content (Reyes et al., 2005), and this
is important for researchers and breeders to increase antioxidant capacity and functional
value of coloured varieties for food and nutraceutical industries.

Anthocyanins and total phenolics have higher concentrations in the peel than in the
flesh, but the overall contribution of the peel is estimated at approximately 20% of the
total, as the peel only accounts for about 10% of tuber weight. There is also a longitudinal
distribution with higher anthocyanins at the stem end of the tuber during development, but
on reaching maturity, the concentration becomes approximately the same (Lewis et al.,
1999). By contrast, after cold storage, tubers had a higher concentration of anthocyanins
at the bud end.

Changes in the colour of tubers also occur in store and may be related to deterio-
ration in skin bloom, where an increase in periderm phenolics and decrease in antho-
cyanins per given surface area may lead to darkening of skin during storage (Anderson
et al., 2002).

458

21.5 GREENING

Storey

Crops may contain greened tubers at harvest, leading to grading rejections of the harvested
crop by processors, pre-packers and merchants. Amongst the main reasons for this are
insufficient soil cover at planting and exposure of the tubers due to heavy rainfall, which
lead to the synthesis of chlorophyll at the exposed tuber surface. Modification of potato-
ridge profiles needs to be considered for higher yielding varieties, those with larger
tuber cluster size or longer tubers. Increasing the internal ridge height and top width
can minimize the risk of greening to these crops (Kouwenhoven et al., 2003). Whilst
rejections from the harvested crop can be a problem, exposure to light during subsequent
storage and retail distribution can also result in greening, and this may also be associated
with increased levels of glycoalkaloids in the tubers (Section 21.3.5). Pigment synthesis
is influenced by the wavelength of the light, with blue light being more effective than
red in starting the greening process in cultivars King Edward and Bintje (Virgin and
Sundqvist, 1992). The pigment formation is greatest in the cells just below the periderm,
and maximum chlorophyll level accumulated over a 20-day period in cultivar White Rose
was 0.5 mg/100 g FW (Dao and Friedman, 1994). However, differences occur between
varieties in the rate of greening (Dale et al., 1993) with, for example, significantly
lower rates of chlorophyll accumulation in cultivars Ailsa and Eden than in Brodick and
Torridon, the latter varieties accumulating approximately three-fold more chlorophyll over
a 7-day period when all varieties were stored in bright light (cid:4)140 (cid:3)mol/m2/s(cid:5) at 20
C.
Grunenfelder et al. (2006) also reported differences in chlorophyll development for several
US varieties, White Rose, Yukon Gold, Dark Red Norland, Russet Norkotah and Reba
over a 5- to 7-day interval and have quantified the colour differences objectively using
optical measurements. The changes in chlorophyll content affected darkness (L value)
and colour (hue angle) of the periderm producing a characteristic off-colour for each
variety.

(cid:4)

Although Dale et al. (1993) reported some apparent relationship between chlorophyll
and glycoalkaloid synthesis in light and darkness, this may be attributed to damage and
heat stress. However, there is no direct metabolic link between chlorophyll biosynthesis
and TGAs, and Edwards et al. (1998) have demonstrated that the chlorophyll biosynthesis
inhibitor 4-amino-5-fluoropentanoic acid (AFPA) reduced total chlorophyll synthesis by
50–70% in cultivars Pentland Dell and Record and that there was no effect of the inhibitor
on light-enhanced TGA accumulation. Temperature also influences rate of chlorophyll
accumulation, and during holding cultivar King Edward for 8 days at temperatures
C (Edwards and Cobb,
between 5 and 25
1997), and conversely, lower rates of synthesis occurred in cultivars Kerrs Pink, Peik and
C (Kaaber, 1993). Although
Troll when holding at 6
optical measurements can differentiate the development of unique colours between vari-
eties experimentally, the commercial detection and elimination of greening defects during
grading and potato preparation is essential to maintain the quality of fresh or prepared
potato products for consumers. Visual grading and enhanced optical systems provide
that facility for fresh potatoes, and Noordam et al. (2005) demonstrate the benefits of
multi-spectral imaging in detecting latent greening in prepared French fries.

21.6 MECHANICAL DAMAGE AND BRUISING

Mechanical damage, including bruising, is a major concern for the potato industry world-
wide. For example, Brook (1996) estimated that a 1% reduction in impact damage was
worth approximately $7.5 million annually for the US industry, and in the UK, a survey
by the BPC in 2004 estimated that the cost of bruising to growers was £26 million in
an average year, equivalent to £200 per hectare. Packers and processors incur additional
costs when loads are rejected or downgraded, and several businesses reported the annual
cost of bruising to them at £1–2 million.

Peters (1996) highlighted the extent of damage caused during harvesting and grading
operations. Improvements in field preparation and potato crop agronomy can contribute
to reductions in overall damage levels of the harvested crop. Mechanization methods have
also improved significantly, with increased emphasis on better-designed and operated
harvesters, where cumulative damage can be minimized with, for example, better share
and web design and managed horizontal web agitation (Witney and McRae, 1992; Baheri
and de Baerdemaeker, 1997; Kang and Wen, 2005). Although improved management at
store loading and grading has also contributed to overall damage reduction, by minimizing
drop heights and use of cushioning materials, there are still opportunities for improvement,
as Molema et al. (2000), monitoring instrumented sphere (IS) impacts during different
phases of representative Dutch ware potato-handling chains, found that of the 340 impacts
above 30 g, 79% of the impacts occurred during packaging.

The distinction between external damage and internal damage is important because
the internal defects cannot be readily seen. The visibly damaged tubers, which includes
scuffing of the skin, cuts or gouges and splits or cracking, can be physically removed at
harvest, but handling during store loading, unloading and grading can add to the internal
damage incurred at harvest.

Various classifications of damage types have been published (Hughes, 1980; Hiller
et al., 1985; Bouman, 1996; Baritelle et al., 2000), the latter presenting a modification
(Fig. 21.2) of the comprehensive classification proposed by Hughes (1980) that included
a description of the tuber characteristics that influenced the type of damage. Consistent
and accurate descriptions of damage and bruise types are important for comparative
assessments and for understanding the relationships between the type of impact, the energy
absorbed and the interaction of the physical condition of the tuber with the biochemical
propensity to discolouration of the tuber tissue.

In the Washington State University (WSU) classification system (Baritelle et al., 2000),
six different bruise types were identified: (1) blackspot, typically showing no visible cell
separation, although the cells are often damaged, and a typical blue-black discolouration;
(2) internal crush damage, where there is obvious cell wall or cell separation in addition
to blue-black discolouration; (3) white spot, which is similar to a crush, except that the
damaged tissues are not discoloured; (4) internal shatter, which is normally in the per-
imedullary tissue, has distinct failure planes where tissue has sheared and where damage
to cells results in discolouration; (5) external shatter, where failure planes extend through
the cortex to the skin and the discolouration is brown rather than blue-black because air
enters the shatter and dries tissue before complete oxidation occurs and (6) external crack-
ing, which is mostly the result of cell separation, with little or no tissue discolouration.

and ring shatter (Noble, 1985). The WSU description from type (1) blackspot through
to type (6) external cracking largely reflects an increasing degree of hydration of the
tuber tissue. The understanding of skin set and factors affecting the scuffing damage of
potatoes are dealt with in detail in Chapter 22 (Lulai, this volume).

21.6.1 Enzymic browning

The discolouration of potato flesh arising from mechanical impacts through enzymic
browning is well documented (Walker, 1977; Matheis, 1987). The pigment melanin
formed in bruised tissue results from initial oxidation of the substrate tyrosine by the
enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO E.C. 1.10.3.1) to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA).
Intracellular membrane disruption is needed to allow the substrate in the vacuole to come
into contact with the enzyme that Cobb (1998) suggests is located in the amyloplast.
DOPA then oxidizes to DOPA quinone. The polymerization to the blue-black melanin
pigment occurs over about 24 hours, although some of the intermediary dopachromes,
with reddish-orange pigments, are evident within a few hours of impact. PPO is a doublet
of molecular weights of 60 and 69 kDa and has a reported michaelis constant (Km) of
4.3 mM using L-DOPA as a substrate (Partington and Bolwell, 1996). This implies the
need for considerable substrate for the melanin formation to proceed and is an important
consideration in relation to crop maturity and bruise development for the harvested crop.
Laerke et al. (2002b) reported increasing abundance of the red- and yellow-coloured
intermediaries during tuber growth and a high correlation coefficient (cid:4)r(cid:5) of the final

black-coloured compounds with free tyrosine levels for cultivars Dali (0.69) and Oleva
(0.67). Tyrosine is synthesized in the tuber through the shikimic acid pathway, and Sabba
and Dean (1994, 1996) demonstrated that the principal determinant of raised tyrosine
concentrations in the tuber results from increased proteinase activity and that this activity
was more apparent following prolonged storage at 3
C. The detrimental effect of low
temperature is not explained by changes in PPO activity, catalase activity or ascorbic
acid content (Brierley et al., 1998). Chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid are also potential
substrates for PPO and in vivo they are rapidly oxidized, but their concentrations are too
low to influence the bruising process (Cobb, 1998).

(cid:4)

The chemical control of enzymic browning, which also occurs in cut or prepared
potatoes, involves inhibition of PPO activity or prevention of tyrosine oxidation, most
commonly by adding bisulphite or hypochlorite compounds (Brecht et al., 1993). Alter-
natives such as citric acid or ascorbic acid have been assessed for minimizing tuber
discolouration (Molnar-Perl and Friedman, 1990). The recent classification of sulphite as
an allergen has added impetus to this interest, particularly as a number of countries require
the level of sulphur dioxide and sulphite in foods to be declared, for example in the UK,
if the content exceeds 10 mg/kg of SO2 in the finished product. Muneta (1981) has shown
that sodium sulphite and diethyldithiocarbamic acid (DIECA) inhibit browning by restrict-
ing oxidation of tyrosine and that DIECA also causes enzyme inactivation. Ascorbate and
dihydroxyfumarate inhibit discolouration by reducing DOPA quinone to DOPA. Reducing
synthesis of phenols such as chlorogenic acid, which may be oxidized to produce lighter
brown o-quinones, may also limit discolouration, and there is evidence that phenoxyacetic
acids such as 3,5-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid inhibit browning (Burrell, 1984).

21.6.2 Structural and cellular changes

The ultra-structural sequence of events in tubers following a bruising impact have been
observed in cultivar Pentland Dell using a falling bolt with known energy (0.7 J) (Edgell
et al., 1998). Typically, there was collapse of intracellular compartmentation, increased
abundance of ribosomes and mitochondria in the cytoplasm, an increase in granular den-
sity of the cytoplasm adjacent to cell walls and amyloplasts and, as a result of mixing
of enzymes and substrates, development of melanin as a dark amorphous layer adjacent
to cell walls and amyloplasts. This intercellular membrane disruption may occur as an
immediate effect of impact, or the membranes may undergo physiological deterioration
over time (Partington et al., 1999; Laerke et al., 2000). Changes occur in cell membrane
permeability and lipid content following harvest. Marked changes in glycolipid composi-
tion take place during storage at 5
C (Spychalla, 1994), and oxygen free radical build up
in stored tubers contributes to a progressive deterioration of the cell membranes (Kumar
and Knowles, 1993). The effects of any impact on the tissue mechanical properties and
internal structural changes are influenced by the tuber-cell size and packing arrangements,
cell wall strength and cell–cell cohesion. At the stolon end of the tuber, a dense zone of
lignified xylem and tracheids are positioned close to the tuber surface, near to the point
of stolon attachment, and discontinuities in starch packing in parenchymatous cells may
concentrate pressure shocks in this zone (Croy et al., 1998). By contrast, the sides of the
tuber have less sub-surface lignified tissue and possible greater dissipation of impact.

(cid:4)

462

Storey

Externally, the strength of the periderm will also have an effect on the type of resulting
damage depending on the size and site of the impact on the tuber. The speed and
propagation of a shock wave created by a pendulum impact is influenced by the tuber
turgor (Bajema et al., 1998c), and that affects the type and degree of damage at both
tissue and cellular levels, but the effects on blackspot development differ depending on
the stage of crop growth (Laerke et al., 2002a) and the biochemical potential of the tuber.
The size, number and angularity of starch granules in the cells may also contribute to the
disruption of membranes and cell walls (Gray and Hughes, 1978), but the magnitude of
these effects on membrane and cell walls could be modified depending on tissue turgor, as
Scanlon et al. (1998) suggested that for flaccid tubers that had been osmotically adjusted,
starch granule movement in viscous protoplasm dissipated shear strain energy.

At the cellular level, an early response to mechanical stress on tuber tissue is a
significant and rapid synthesis of superoxide radicals. This burst of radical production
distinctively displays a reproducible biphasic pattern over time (Johnson et al., 2003) with
differences in superoxide production between impacted bruise-susceptible and bruise-
resistant cultivars (Fig. 21.3).

A consequence of the free radical generation is elevated levels of oxidatively modified
tuber proteins. Both radical generation and protein modification vary between cultivars,
but both are directly proportional to the amount of melanin pigments produced. This
proportionate generation of superoxide radicals has provided the basis for the development
of a diagnostic kit that has the potential to predict, prior to harvest, the susceptibility of
tubers to bruising. A standard 0.7-J impact is imposed on tubers and, using a colorimeter,
the test quantitatively measures the level of oxygen free radical production in the tissue
that can be related to crop bruise susceptibility (Fig. 21.4).

21.6.3 Field factors and tuber water status

Practical application of such technology requires an appreciation of the status of tubers
at the time of the assessment and the ability to identify and implement crop management
options for remediation.

Bruise susceptibility

Fig. 21.4. Relationship between levels of superoxide generation and bruise susceptibility of potato tissue (BPC
Bruise forum 2006 – courtesy of R.R.D. Croy and S.M. Johnson).

Commercially, the susceptibility of a crop to bruising is often not established until an
assessment is made of damage and bruise levels at harvest, and that assessment reflects
the soil conditions at the time and efficiency of the harvesting operation as well as the
physical and biochemical condition of the tuber. Hot-box treatments, where a harvested
tuber sample is held at an elevated temperature for 8–12 hours to enhance bruise develop-
ment prior to assessment, are used frequently to inform harvesting operations. However,
in attempts to characterize the bruise susceptibility of varieties and determine experimen-
tally the effects of different field factors that may predispose crops to damage, a wide
range of other tests have been adopted, including impacting tubers with a known energy
using pendulums and falling bolts, using a shaking table or alternatively dropping tubers
from a given height. The use of different bruise tests in the literature makes comparisons
and interpretation between evaluations difficult (Aeppli et al., 1981; Pavek et al., 1985;
Dean et al., 1993; Laerke et al., 2002a). Genotypic variation does exist in the extent of
enzymic browning and has been widely exploited through the adoption of new varieties,
but the incidence of bruising is affected by climatic and edaphic factors. Information on
soil-related factors affecting bruise susceptibility has been widely reported, but most of
the effects are inconsistent. However, there is fairly compelling evidence of a reduction
in susceptibility with increasing application rate of potassium fertiliser, but the effect is
not large and is primarily observed for the potassium-deficient range of concentrations
(Chapman et al., 1992; McGarry et al., 1996). The effect of potassium on bruise suscepti-
bility is not mediated through changes in tuber DM content, as many studies demonstrate
that there is no relationship between tuber DM and bruise susceptibility (Rogers-Lewis,
1980; McGarry et al., 1996; Craighead and Martin, 2002). However, it has been suggested
the effect may be mediated through the hydration status of the tuber (Van der Zaag and
Meijers, 1970) or lower phenol levels and PPO activity (McMabnay et al., 1999).

The effect of soil temperatures at harvest on bruise susceptibility has been widely
reported, with lower temperatures increasing the bruise susceptibility of the tuber and
recommendations that soil temperature should be approximately above 10
C and prefer-
ably 12

C before harvesting begins (Allen and Scott, 2001).

The importance of soil condition at the time of lifting has also been recognized, but the
emphasis has usually placed on having sufficient soil on the harvester webs to provide a
degree of cushioning to the tubers being lifted. Surveys reviewing field crop agronomy
have been related to information on the incidence of bruising assessed post-harvest, but the
challenge has been identifying specific field factors pre-harvest that affect susceptibility.
One approach has involved discriminative analysis of a total of 180 commercial crops
of cultivars Cara, Marfona and Maris Piper over a 3-year period (2001–03). This work
identified that dry soil conditions at crop defoliation were consistently associated with
greater bruising susceptibility at harvest (Fellows, 2004). The soil moisture level in the
period prior to harvest will affect the hydration status of the tuber and potentially affect
damage susceptibility.

There has been an appreciation since the 1960s that tuber water status has a significant
influence on tuber damage and the occurrence of a shatter or blackspot bruise. Smittle et al.
(1974) hypothesized that highly turgid tubers were more susceptible to shatter damage than
the flaccid tubers that were susceptible to bruising (Fig. 21.5). The relationship suggested
that there was an optimum level of tuber hydration at which total damage was minimal.
Despite the knowledge that tuber hydration was implicated in bruise and damage
susceptibility, the practical application for active crop management has been limited
because of the complexity of the inter-relationships between the different parameters that
affect tissue susceptibility and blackspot colour development.

Bruising is known to be affected by cultivar and the crop maturity, tuber mass and
tuber shape, temperature, tuber turgor but not DM content per se, although this is fre-
quently incorrectly associated with bruise susceptibility by many researchers, advisors
and potato growers. Integrating this information so that hypotheses can be tested has been
a crucial step, and studies at WSU have examined the different components: tuber impact
thresholds (Mathew and Hyde, 1997), temperature and tissue strain rate (Bajema et al.,
1998a), turgor and temperature (Bajema et al., 1998b), turgor and failure stress and strain

and Hyde, 2003) within a biological and mechanical context (Baritelle and Hyde, 2001).
Experimentally, work on cultivars Russet Burbank and Atlantic (Bajema et al., 1998b)
had demonstrated that progressive dehydration of tubers to reduce turgor affected the
tissue stress–strain relationship and that there was an optimum level for tissue hydration
that was linked to the physical characteristics determining bruise susceptibility.

At a threshold when bruising is about to occur, the induced stress (cid:4)(cid:10)i(cid:5) on the tuber will
be equal to the tissue failure stress (cid:4)(cid:10)f (cid:5); when the induced stress is then increased, the
threshold is exceeded, tissue failure happens and bruising occurs. The amount of stress
that the tissue can withstand is related to the elasticity of the tissue, and the following
elasticity-based equation has been developed for potato to explain the relationship between
the bruise threshold (cid:4)h(cid:5) and tissue failure stress (cid:4)(cid:10)f (cid:5) and strain (cid:4)(cid:11)f (cid:5), the radius at the site
of impact (cid:4)R(cid:5) and the force of the impact (m and g):

h ≈ 7600(cid:10)f (cid:10) 4

where h = potato tuber bruise threshold (the drop height at which bruising just begins
to occur);
= tissue failure stress (strength);
= tissue failure strain (elasticity – ability to deform before failure);

(cid:10)f
(cid:11)f
R = radius of curvature at point of impact (mm);
m = tuber mass;
g = acceleration due to gravity.

The equation has provided an indication of the relative importance of the different compo-
nents as they relate to the condition of a tissue and its bruise threshold. Baritelle and Hyde
(2001) report that, in general, higher temperature and/or lower relative turgor (within
limits) in potato tubers resulted in improved bruise threshold. Preliminary validation work
using the model predicted apple and potato bruise thresholds within 23% of experimental
values or better for assumed values of Poisson’s ratio (Baritelle and Hyde, 2001). The
importance of small changes in tissue elasticity is identified by the equation and the under-
standing of where, and to what extent, changes in tissue turgor impact on the relationship
with the bruise threshold have been central to making progress on crop management.

At the time of harvest, the DM concentration in the tubers will have been influenced
by length and conditions during the growing season. By managing soil moisture levels, a
range of different tuber turgor levels has been generated experimentally for varieties of
differing bruise susceptibility. Stalham and Allen (2006) manipulated the tuber hydration
status during the development of field grown crops and have shown that internal impact
damage could be predicted from measurements of tuber water potential with reasonable
accuracy in cultivar Lady Rosetta but not in cultivars Maris Piper or Smith’s Comet.
Actively altering the tuber turgor level prior to harvest to improve the level of bruising
will be dependent on the hydration status of the tuber at the given point as it will have
been affected by soil water availability over the growth period to that time; the degree of
change in turgor that can occur in the tuber will depend on whether the crop has senesced,

466

Storey

whether it has been defoliated and whether it has an active rooting system that can take
up water. Whether the active intervention in tuber hydration management to minimize
blackspot will be effective will also depend on the maturity of the crop, as immature
tubers are less susceptible to enzymic browning (Pavek et al., 1985; Corsini et al., 1999).
However, there are also reports that some young, small tubers, e.g. of cultivar Maris
Peer, can be very susceptible to blackspot bruising (E.J. Allen, personal communication).
If the crop does not have the biochemical propensity for discolouration, there may be no
observed effect on blackspot levels, but other forms of internal damage such as whitespot
may still occur (Baritelle et al., 2000). Active intervention may be more readily achieved
in other situations, e.g. with cultivar Smith’s Comet; as the tuber became more turgid it
was increasingly susceptible to cracking, and Stalham and Allen (2006) have suggested
this could be reduced by maintaining higher Soil Moisture Deficits (SMDs) late in the
season.

21.7 CONCLUDING COMMENTS

Storey and Davies (1992) considered that although little could be done that affected tuber
tissue structure, a range of cultural practices adopted during growth and subsequent storage
could have a significant effect on damage levels. The maintenance of optimum tuber
turgor, avoidance of unfavourable harvesting temperatures and reducing impacts were
the three key areas identified that would produce marked benefits. Practical progress has
been achieved since then by greater attention to temperatures at harvesting and reducing
numbers and size of damaging impacts. More could still be done in this respect in relation
to improving soil condition for crop growth and harvest (Stalham et al., 2005), and in
many production scenarios by improving seed selection and appropriate fertiliser use to
manage the harvest window. The understanding of the relationship between bruising and
tuber turgor is beginning to lead to a better understanding of the practical potential that
could be available to growers to minimize bruising through crop water management.
If this could be integrated, in the future, with diagnostic systems that reliably predict the
biochemical potential of crop to bruise susceptibility, then there are real opportunities
to improve the quality of potatoes delivered to end users. This improvement in defect
management will need to be applied within both existing and new cropping situations to
enable potato to meet the nutritional demands that will be required of it as a crucial food
resource in developing economies and for consumers within more developed markets
who are demanding a wider range of quality potatoes and potato products.

Skin-Set, Wound Healing, and Related Defects

Edward C. Lulai

USDA-ARS, Northern Crop Science Laboratory, 1307 18 Street N, Fargo, ND, USA

22.1 INTRODUCTION

The physiology and biochemistry of the development of resistance to tuber skinning injury
(idiom = skin-set), wound healing, and wound-related defects are of global importance
because of the magnitude of food and financial losses impacted by these processes. The
amount of these losses is difficult to determine because of the large range of infections,
bruise defects, water vapor loss, and various quality issues that are affected by inad-
equate skin-set and slow wound healing. Collectively, minor to serious wounding and
bruising can average 40%, resulting in serious food quality and loss problems and the
creation of grower–processor contracts with stringent incentives to reduce these losses
(Hampson et al., 1980; Brook, 1996). This chapter will discuss important physiological
and biochemical research that impacts these costly wound-related problems.

This chapter will discuss the formation and maturation of native tuber periderm and its
relationship to tuber skin-set development in section 22.2. Skinning wounds are difficult
to control during harvest unless the tuber periderm has matured so that the skin is set
and resistant to skinning injury. The structure of tuber periderm and the maturational
changes that result in resistance to tuber skinning injury are of fundamental importance
in developing physiological approaches to enhance skin-set and reduce associated losses.
The current status of this relatively young research area is described.

The following section, 22.3, discusses tuber wound-healing in detail. The process of
wound-induced suberization to heal skinned, cut, and so-called bruised areas covers a
vast research plane. Sections 22.3 includes information on the induction and regulation
of suberization, and the composition, biosynthetic pathways, assembly, and molecular
structure of suberin. These areas of suberin physiology and biochemistry are not fully
understood, but they are of great importance in mitigating infection, defect development,
and other losses. Suberin is somewhat of an enigma that is often misunderstood and
poorly described in conjunction with wound healing and wound periderm development.
Consequently, the section covers what is currently considered appropriate terminology
and description of suberin.

The final section, 22.4, discusses wound-related defects including shatter bruise,
blackspot bruise, growth cracks, and skinning. These defects directly affect food losses
and market quality. The physiology and biochemistry of these defects are discussed in
relation to wounding and suberization.

22.2 NATIVE PERIDERM AND SKIN-SET

22.2.1 Native periderm formation

A well-developed intact periderm with its suberin biopolymer provides the primary barrier
against disease, insects, dehydration, and physical intrusions for the potato tuber (Lulai,
2001a). These critical roles of protecting and preserving the tuber are indicative of the
importance of the native periderm and wound periderm development.

Prior to development of the native periderm, an epidermis exists for a short time on the
youngest tubers of approximately 1 cm or less in diameter. Epidermal tissues are created
as the underground stem of the potato plant, i.e. the stolon, swells to form the nascent
potato tuber (Artschwager, 1918; Peterson and Barker, 1979). Stomata are scattered in
the epidermis and permit gas exchange.

The native periderm forms from epidermal tissues of the nascent potato tuber. Tuber
periderm consists of three distinct types of cells; each cell type is grouped into separate
layers: (1) phellem, (2) phellogen, and (3) phelloderm (Fig. 22.1). Periderm formation in
the emergent tuber is initiated by periclinal division of the epidermal and subepidermal
cells, but the meristematic layer of periderm cells, referred to as the phellogen or cork
cambium, is formed from the hypodermis (Peterson and Barker, 1979). The phellogen then
divides outwardly forming the phellem of the periderm. The phellem is a corky material
consisting of several layers (approximately 4–10, depending on genotype, environment,
and stage of growth) of well-organized, rectangular suberized cells located at the very
surface of the tuber. The innermost layer of periderm cells, the phelloderm, neighbors the
phellogen which utilizes substrate sources and starch collectively found in the phelloderm
and neighboring cortical cells as is evidenced by the lack of starch granules in these
cells. The phellem and phelloderm cells are derivatives of the phellogen and as such
are organized into the same rectangular file as that of the original phellogen cell from
which the file originates. During periderm development, the meristematic action of the

(1) exceeding the tensile strength of the phellem resulting in a fracturing of the phellem cell walls and tearing
of the fabric-like skin (phellem tensile component) and (2) a fracture of the phellogen cell walls (phellogen
shear component). (Courtesy: E.C. Lulai, Am J. Potato Res. 2002).

T.J. Wirta).

phellogen also forms lenticels below stomata that existed in the previous epidermal tissues
(Artschwager, 1918; Peterson and Barker, 1979) (Fig. 22.2).

As the tuber grows, the radial and longitudinal dimensions increase, thereby requiring
commensurate growth of the periderm tissues to maintain the protective suberized cov-
ering on the tuber surface. The meristematic action of the phellogen layer continues to
form cells necessary to replace sloughed cells and maintain the native periderm on the
expanding surface of the growing tuber. During tuber growth, the surface of the periderm
may remain smooth, as it does in red- and white-skinned genotypes, or it may develop
a rough surface. These rough surfaces of the potato tuber are referred to as russeted or
netted skins.

The biology of native periderm and wound-induced suberization to heal wounds and
bruises that breach or damage the native periderm are of great importance in minimizing
disease, tuber rot during storage, and the development of various defects. Among the most
common and yet problematic types of tuber wounds are those created by tuber skinning
injury.

22.2.2 Skin-set: a part of native periderm maturation

During growth and for a period during potato plant senescence, the periderm covering the
tuber is immature and as such is fragile and susceptible to abrasion. These abrasion-type
wounds are frequently referred to as scuffing, skinning injuries, or skinning wounds. This
type of periderm damage can be extensive during harvest and handling operations, and
results in costly disease, dehydration, and defect development that adversely affects all
sectors of the potato industry including processing, fresh market, and seed (Hampson
et al., 1980; Lulai and Orr, 1993, 1994). The ensuing losses are consistent with the

474

Lulai

250- to 1000-fold increase in the initial rate of water vapor loss from skinned areas
compared with non-skinned areas of freshly harvested tubers (Lulai and Orr, 1995). Water
vapor loss from freshly harvested tubers that are damage-free is up to 28 times greater
than that from mature tubers (Lulai and Orr, 1994). The process of periderm maturation is
initiated after growth ceases, and the potato vines die or begin to die in the field (Murphy,
1968). The decades-old approach employing vine/haulm killing or desiccation remains the
standard means of promoting periderm maturation and related development of resistance
to skinning injury. However, results are varied, and reasonably good skin-set development
generally requires about 3 weeks of periderm maturation following vine-killing treatment
(Lulai and Orr, 1993). Cultural practices and conditions, such as excessive amounts of
fertilizer applied or remaining in the soil because of dry growing conditions followed
by rain near the time of harvest, may drastically increase the time required for skin-
set (Stark and Love, 2003). In addition to cultural conditions, potato genotype is a
major factor in skin-set development; this can be broadly illustrated where russeted
genotypes generally mature more quickly whereas red-skinned genotypes often develop
skin-set slowly (Lulai and Orr, 1993). Some potato genotypes are deemed unacceptable
for commercial production because inherent skin-set development is exceedingly slow,
leading to excessive skinning wounds, disease, and development of related defects.

The term ‘skinning’ has often been loosely used to imply that the entire periderm
becomes physically detached from the underlying tuber cells; this is not the case as will
be discussed in this chapter. The term excoriation (Latin: ex – out of; corium – skin) has
been used to describe this same type of skinning wound but with emphasis that the entire
periderm does not become detached (Lulai and Freeman, 2001). The terms excoriation
and skinning will be used interchangeably to streamline this discussion. The development
of resistance to excoriation, or skin-set, is an important part of periderm maturation that
occurs during and after potato vine senescence as well as postharvest (Lulai and Orr,
1993, 1995; Bowen et al., 1996; Pavlista, 2002). Although slow or hindered development
of resistance to excoriation during periderm maturation is a serious and costly problem,
little is known about the physiology of susceptibility and resistance of the potato tuber to
skinning injury.

22.2.3 Skin-set and native periderm physiology

Tuber periderm is composed of (1) phellem (suberized cells), (2) phellogen (cork cam-
bium), and (3) phelloderm (parenchyma-like cells derived from the phellogen) tissues
(Reeve et al., 1969). Analysis of mature tuber periderm, however, may not produce easily
identifiable phellogen or phelloderm (Lyshede, 1977). A study of all three periderm cell
types in immature and mature periderm was needed to determine maturational changes.
Only recently have these periderm cell structures been clearly illustrated for easier iden-
tification and associated morphological description (Lulai and Freeman, 2001; Lulai,
2002). The suberization processes involved in phellem development are only partially
characterized (Kolattukudy, 1980, 2001; Lulai and Morgan, 1992; Thomson et al., 1995;
Bernards and Lewis, 1998; Lulai and Corsini, 1998; Lulai, 2001a; Bernards, 2002).

Considering the long history of potato cropping and the breadth and depth of global
potato research, it is surprising that earlier identification was not made of the type of

Skin-set, wound healing, and related defects

periderm cells and cellular changes involved in susceptibility and resistance to tuber exco-
riation. The lack of fundamental information, particularly at the cellular level, describing
the simplest aspects of susceptibility and resistance to excoriation, has hampered the
development of effective, rational approaches to describe periderm maturation and asso-
ciated skin-set development. In turn, there has been a lack of technological advancements
necessary to move toward solving the costly problem of tuber skinning injuries that
occur during harvest and that hinder successful long-term storage of tubers. The lack of
research led to non-scientific explanations for skinning and skin-set, which resulted in
postulates incorrectly ascribing skin thickness, periderm thickness, and suberization as
determinants of susceptibility and resistance to tuber skinning in immature and mature
tubers. These characterizations of skin-set often incorrectly refer to the skin, i.e. phellem,
as the periderm of the potato tuber even though the skin constitutes but one of the three
types of cells that make up the periderm (Reeve et al., 1969). Because these postulates and
idioms arose without scientific investigation or verification, they have become entrenched
as descriptive vernaculars and they have been appropriately found in various reviews
(Hiller et al., 1985; Peterson et al., 1985; de Haan, 1987; Hiller and Thornton, 1993).
Research advancements have moved toward new information and hypotheses describing
periderm maturation and excoriation. The ability to objectively measure the status of
skin-set development is an important requisite for this research.

A few techniques have been developed to objectively measure the total resistance to
skinning during periderm maturation (Ostby et al., 1990; Halderson and Henning, 1993;
Lulai and Orr, 1993; Muir and Bowen, 1994; Bowen et al., 1996). All of these techniques
rely on measurement of the physical resistance to skinning injury, i.e. the tangential or
torsional force required to mechanically shear the phellem from the tuber. Results obtained
using the basic principle for these techniques were quantitatively related to observed
tuber skinning injury (Pavlista, 2002). The ability to objectively measure the development
of resistance to skinning injury is essential for assessing the effectiveness of cultural
practices intended to address skin-set development and for uncovering physiological
factors associated with susceptibility and resistance to excoriation. However, a uniformly
acceptable means of objectively measuring skin-set has not been adopted.

Postharvest controlled environment studies, in conjunction with objective measure-
ment of skin-set, have shown that for some genotypes low relative humidity may hasten
periderm maturation and the development of resistance to excoriation in freshly har-
vested tubers (Lulai and Orr, 1993). Periderm maturation was more rapid in tubers from
cultivars with characteristically higher water vapor loss, particularly russeted genotypes
(Lulai and Orr, 1994). Periderm maturation and skin-set development did not relate to
phellem/skin thickness, phellem/skin weight, or phellem histology. Also, the method of
haulm destruction did not influence skin morphology (Lulai and Orr, 1993, 1994; Bowen
et al., 1996). These results suggested that the first layer of fully hydrated cells within the
periderm, i.e. the phellogen, should play an important role in tuber periderm maturation
and skin-set development. Until recently, there was no published information available
on the changes that occur within the cork cambium/phellogen of potato tuber periderm as
growth ceases and as the periderm matures (Lulai and Freeman, 2001). Extensive studies
had been conducted on the structure, ultrastructure, cytology, and biochemistry of the
vascular cambium of perennial woody plants and taproots as the plants cycle through

476

Lulai

growth and dormancy. These are periods when the vascular cambium correspondingly
cycles from being meristematically active to inactive (Catesson, 1994; Catesson et al.,
1994; Chaffey et al., 1998; Lachaud et al., 1999). The changes in cell wall architecture of
the vascular cambium from perennial plants may be a poor model for the changes in cork
cambium/phellogen from periderm tissues of annual plants such as potato tubers. In potato
tuber, the cells of the lateral meristem irreversibly change from meristematically active to
inactive. However, as noted in section 22.2.4, the overall changes in cell wall morphology
occurring in the vascular cambium as it enters dormancy are very similar to those found
in tuber phellogen as it becomes meristematically inactive upon periderm maturation.

22.2.4 Periderm architecture and skinning injury

Lulai and Freeman (2001) investigated the cellular architecture of immature and mature
tuber periderm at the light and electron microscope levels and developed a new paradigm
for susceptibility and resistance to tuber skinning injury. They confirmed that the perid-
erm consisted of phellem, phellogen, and phelloderm cells and defined the physiology of
skinning by showing that the phellem portion of the periderm comprises what had been
loosely referred to as the skin. They further showed that skin thickening and suberiza-
tion are not the source of development of resistance to skinning injury upon periderm
maturation. Instead, the tissue separation responsible for skinning injury occurred solely
within the phellogen layer (cork cambium) of immature periderm. As discussed earlier,
in section 22.2.1, the phellogen is a lateral meristem from which the periderm is formed
(Artschwager, 1918, 1924; Peterson and Barker, 1979). The cell walls of the phellogen
mechanically connect and hold the phellem, i.e. skin, to the underlying phelloderm cells,
which are tough and rigidly connected to the neighboring cortical tissues. The phellogen
cells of immature periderm are meristematic and have thin walls that are easily fractured.
This fracturing was found to be synonymous with skinning injury. The walls of these cells
were shown to strengthen and thicken considerably and were no longer susceptible to
fracture upon development of full resistance to skinning injury and periderm maturation.
Although the changes that occur in tuber phellogen cells during periderm maturation and
the susceptibility of immature phellogen cell walls to fracture prior to periderm matura-
tion are only beginning to be studied, the biomechanics and fracture of plant cell walls
in general have been described (Niklas, 1992a,b).

During tuber skinning, two physical fractures or breakages occur within the periderm.
The modulus associated with each of these fractures consists of the stress and strain related
to (1) tearing of the fabric-like phellem/skin when the tensile strength is exceeded and
(2) shearing type of fracture incurred by the radial cell walls in the phellogen. Lulai and
Freeman (2001) showed that the phellogen is the specific area of contiguous fracture upon
skinning and that phellogen cell wall strengthening is a determining factor for skin-set
development. Lulai (2002) quantitatively determined the role of phellem/skin tensile-
related fractures and shear-related fractures in susceptibility and resistance to skinning
injury and in skin-set development (Fig. 22.1). The relative strength of the phellem tensile
component was nearly constant for the time points tested during periderm maturation for
each cultivar and did not measurably increase as the periderm approached maturation.
These results indicated that the phellem tensile component did not significantly contribute

Skin-set, wound healing, and related defects

477

to skin-set development. However, the force required for fracture of the phellogen shear
component did increase upon periderm maturation. Results indicated phellogen shear was
the major determinant for development of resistance to skinning injury and confirmed
phellogen cell wall strength as the determinant for susceptibility and resistance to tuber
excoriation. Collectively, this information showed that the nature of tuber phellogen cell
wall strengthening is of major importance to tuber excoriation and skin-set.

22.2.5 Cellular changes associated with skin-set

Research has been conducted to determine maturational changes that occurred in phellem,
phellogen, and phelloderm cell walls in native periderm in comparison with changes
observed in wound periderm (Sabba and Lulai, 2002, 2004, 2005). As the wounded tuber
tissue began to heal, it formed a closing layer (Fig. 22.3) where the walls of existing
parenchyma cells became suberized. In conjunction with the formation of the closing
layer, a wound phellogen formed under the closing layer. The meristematic action of the
wound phellogen formed a wound phellem and a wound phelloderm. This newly formed
wound periderm was subject to similar susceptibility and later resistance to excoriation as
that of the native periderm. Thickening of wound phellogen cell walls, after meristematic
activity ceased, was evident at the light microscope level. Both the phellogen and the
phelloderm are often difficult to discern. Sabba and Lulai (2004, 2005) resolved this
difficulty by developing a technique employing toluidine blue O, which differentially
stained periderm cell walls. The technique proved to be useful in immunolocalization

visible under these AF conditions; and (3) phelloderm, derived from phellogen, does not suberize and is weakly
AF, and therefore not visible. Under the wound periderm are parenchyma cells; in this case, cortical parenchyma
cells that weakly AF and are therefore not visible. (Courtesy R.P. Sabba and E.C. Lulai).

studies where, in separately stained parallel sections, the orthochromatic staining (blue)
of phellem walls could be used to identify these cells (Sabba and Lulai, 2004, 2005).
Adjoining phellogen and neighboring phelloderm layers, which stained metachromatically
(violet) in native and wound periderm, could then be separately identified based on their
location within the file of periderm cells and their morphology. Identification of these
cells in native and wound periderm is essential in the interpretation of immunolocaliza-
tion data and other biological investigations that involve wound healing and periderm
maturation.

Results from histological and immunolabeling studies of immature and mature native
periderm indicated that pectin and extensin depositions are associated with the processes
involved in the thickening and related strengthening of phellogen walls upon meristematic
inactivation of the phellogen and development of resistance to skinning injury (Sabba and
Lulai, 2004). Histological and immunolocalization data indicated that native periderm
maturation and associated development of resistance to skinning injury are accompanied
by an increase in unesterified pectin in the walls of phellogen cells (Sabba and Lulai,
2002, 2004, 2005). Unesterified pectin can impart rigidity to the cell walls through
calcium bridges. Similar processes have been shown to occur in the cambium of aspen
in association with cessation of meristematic activity and the onset of dormancy and
thickening of cambial walls (Micheli et al., 2000). Pectins are methyl-esterified before they
are transported into the wall, and as such, immature cells tend to be characterized by highly
esterified pectins that prevent calcium pectate cross-linking and associated strengthening
of the cell wall. Older, fully differentiated cells have more rigid walls that are characterized
by less esterification and more calcium pectate cross-linking (Goldberg et al., 1989).
Interestingly, pre- and postharvest skin-set measurements of maturing tubers in some
instances actually show a decrease and later an increase in the resistance to skinning injury
(Lulai, 2002; Rolf Peters, personal communication, EAPR, 2005). These mechanical
measurements indicated that phellogen cell wall strength may at times decrease prior to
cell wall thickening and further skin-set development. The biochemical nature of these
anomalies is not known, but they are likely related to reversible compositional changes in
the thin cell walls of the phellogen as the tuber undergoes some form of stress imparted
by pre- and/or postharvest practices or conditions.

Immunocytological analysis showed that some changes occurred in the localization of
pectin and extensin epitopes in periderm cell walls during native periderm maturation
(Sabba and Lulai, 2005). The antibodies JIM5 and JIM7 recognize a range of homogalac-
turonan (HG) epitopes (50% and less esterified, and up to 90% esterified, respectively);
LM5 and LM6 recognize rhamnogalacturonan (RG)-I epitopes ((cid:2)-galactan tetrasaccha-
ride and (cid:3)-l-arabinan pentasaccharide, respectively); and LM1 recognizes an extensin
epitope. The walls of the three types of potato periderm cells labeled differentially for
these pectin and extensin epitopes. While the phelloderm labeled equally well for all
the epitopes tested, most of the phellem only labeled abundantly for the HG epitope
recognized by JIM7 and was lacking in the HG epitope recognized by JIM5, as well as
the RG-I and extensin epitopes. Most significantly, labeling of the phellogen layer varied
between immature and mature periderm. Cell walls of meristematically active phellogen
were lacking in (1,4)-(cid:2)-galactan and extensin epitopes, as well as those for HG. Upon
maturation of the periderm and development of resistance to excoriation, labeling for all

Skin-set, wound healing, and related defects

479

these epitopes increased dramatically in phellogen cell walls. These results imply that
an increase in the presence of HG, RG-I, and extensin polymers in these walls coincide
with meristematic inactivation and periderm maturation. HG would be expected to form
calcium pectate and extensin would be expected to become cross-linked in phellogen
walls to provide increased strength and reinforcement once meristematic activity is ter-
minated (Sabba and Lulai, 2005). The (1,4)-(cid:2)-galactan epitope recognized by LM5 in
phellogen walls at the end of periderm maturation may also be involved in the strength-
ening of these walls. By contrast, the (1,5)-(cid:3)-l-arabinan epitope recognized by LM6
is present in phellogen walls before and after periderm maturation, and is apparently
not specifically associated with periderm maturation or a discernable role in the thick-
ening of phellogen walls upon meristematic inactivation. The changes in the epitopes
associated with these cell wall polymers provide special insight into the maturational
processes that occur during periderm maturation and skin-set development. Collectively,
these immunolocalization responses for the targeted cell wall polymers indicate pectin
deposition and de-esterification, and extensin depositions are associated with phellogen
cell wall strengthening upon inactivation of the phellogen layer as a lateral meristem and
maturation of the periderm in potato tuber.

Interestingly, both histological and immunolabeling analyses, distinctly different
chemistries, indicated differences between phellogen cell walls of wound versus native
periderm. Results from both immunolocalization and histochemical techniques indicated
that in wound periderm there is no increase in phellogen cell wall pectin upon wound
periderm maturation (Sabba and Lulai, 2004). The reason for these apparent differences
remains to be determined.

Although various studies have been conducted to characterize tuber parenchyma cell
walls (Li and Showalter, 1996; Bush and McCann, 1999; Oomen et al., 2002; Oomen,
2003; Obro et al., 2004), information on the physiology of periderm maturation remains
sparse. Determination of the biochemical nature and regulatory mechanisms for strength-
ening of radial phellogen cell walls is important in the development of technologies to
hasten skin-set and reduce associated market quality problems. The mechanisms regulat-
ing development of resistance to excoriation and biological markers for progress have
not been determined. In conjunction with these knowledge gaps, the physiological and
biological basis for slow/hindered skin-set development is not known, nor are the mecha-
nisms known for the unpredictable reversal of skin-set development. Much more needs to
be learned about the biology of potato periderm maturation so that effective technologies
may be created to enhance skin-set development.

22.3 WOUND HEALING

22.3.1 The process of tuber wound healing

Tubers that are skinned, nicked, or bruised during harvest or cut for seed lack the robust
protection provided by the suberized layer of the native periderm, i.e. native phellem.
Rapid wound healing is essential to avoid infection, desiccation/shrinkage, and defect

480

development after injury. Tuber wound responses and wound healing involve many bio-
logical processes, perhaps the most important of which is wound-induced suberization
(suberin biosynthesis). Regardless of the type of cells and associated polymeric structures
covering the plant surface, wounding induces suberization to protect the damaged area
(Dean and Kolattukudy, 1976). Wound-induced suberization of tuber tissue involves two
stages during which two types of cells are suberized. The first stage involves forma-
tion of a ‘closing layer’ whereby the walls of existing cells at the wound site suberize,
i.e. accumulate suberin biopolymers; ‘closing layer formation’ is also often referred to
as ‘primary suberization’. Following the formation of the closing layer, the second stage
involves development of a ‘wound periderm’ whereby files of new cells are formed and
suberized below the closing layer; ‘wound periderm development’ is also often referred
to as ‘secondary suberization’ (Section 22.3.6). A fully suberized tuber wound is resistant
to infection by both bacteria and fungi (Lulai and Corsini, 1998). Suberin is a complex of
suberin poly(phenolics) (SPP) and suberin poly(aliphatics) (SPA) that are cross-linked by
glycerol, embedded with soluble waxes, and laminated to the interior side of the plant cell
wall (Bernards, 2002). The terms wound healing and suberization are often loosely used
interchangeably. Other forms of resistance are required to provide some degree of protec-
tion against infection and rot until suberization of the wound has been completed. These
resistance processes and associated mechanisms are not fully understood, are generally
temporal, and include various hypersensitive responses, the oxidative bursts, phytoalexin
production, pathogenesis-related proteins, and other mechanisms (Lyon, 1989; Beckman,
2000; Pérombelon, 2002). Some resistance responses at the wound site appear to be
related to the appearance of phenolic compounds (Lyon, 1989; Nolte et al., 1993; Beck-
man, 2000), some of which may be precursors of SPP (Bostock and Stermer, 1989). This
observation is consistent with the correlative relationship found between strong temporal
resistance and the rapidity of suberization across diverse genotypes (Lulai and Corsini,
1998, unpublished results). Importantly, a fully suberized surface provides the final, most
durable, and broad ranging barrier for protectin against pests, desiccation, and infection
(Lulai and Corsini, 1998). Rapid suberization is essential for protecting tubers that are
injured during growth, during harvest and handling, and upon seed cutting. Suberization
is also responsible for closure of lenticels as orifices for gas exchange and as a portal
of entry for pests (Wigginton, 1973; Banks and Kays, 1988; Scott et al., 1996; Tyner
et al., 1997) (Fig. 22.2). The soluble waxes embedded in the suberin matrix control water
loss and prevent desiccation (Soliday et al., 1979; Lulai and Orr, 1994; Schreiber et al.,
2005a). For the sake of conciseness, the discussion in section 22.3.2 will be primarily
directed to potato tuber suberin and suberization.

22.3.2 Induction of suberization

Upon cellular damage incurred during wounding or stress, a wide range of signals is
perceived, which induces various protective or wound-related responses including suber-
ization (de Bruxelles and Roberts, 2001; Kolattukudy, 2001; Leon et al., 2001; Schilmiller
and Howe, 2005; Wasternack et al., 2006). A four-fold increase in translational activity
is induced within 1 h of wounding, and a range of transcripts appears including those
involved in primary suberization (Vayda and Morelli, 1994). Despite their importance,

Skin-set, wound healing, and related defects

481

the signal(s) that induce suberization are enigmas that require further study. Several
mitosis-related signals were hypothesized to be involved (Rosenstock and Kahl, 1978).
Although induction of cell division is an essential part of wound periderm formation, it
does not address the critical induction of suberin accumulation on the existing cell walls
in the closing layer, i.e. during primary suberization resulting from a wound or from
other stresses. Suberization of existing tuber parenchyma cells, i.e. similar to closing layer
formation/primary suberization, has been demonstrated without mechanical wounding
(Lulai, 2005; Lulai et al., 2006). The hollow heart disorder is a different type of example;
it may be described as an internal growth-related wound with no cells exposed to the
external environment; yet, cells neighboring the hollow heart area are suberized and are
compositionally and ultrastructurally similar to that of wound periderm (Dean and Kolat-
tukudy, 1977; see Chapter 23, Sowokinos, this volume, for more information on hollow
heart). The signals involved in wound-, pathogen-, and other stress-induced suberization
have not been determined. Rosenstock and Kahl (1978) asked the fundamental question
‘what is the primary event after mechanical disturbance of a tissue?’ and whether a pri-
mary event triggers the sequence of reactions in a wound cell. They hypothesized that
one of the first primary changes upon wounding is that of a change in osmotic potential
of the cell at the wound site. Many wound-related or wound-induced signals have been
studied (de Bruxelles and Roberts, 2001; Leon et al., 2001; Schilmiller and Howe, 2005).
However, the signal(s) and related mechanism(s) that induce suberization in potato tuber
have not been identified.

22.3.3 Regulation of suberization

In association with induction, the regulation of suberization is of equal importance, yet
poorly understood. The plant hormone ethylene has been shown to be involved with
various kinds of plant stress including wound response (Abeles et al., 1992; Bleecker
and Kende, 2000; Ciardi and Klee, 2001; de Bruxelles and Roberts, 2001). However,
the involvement of ethylene in wound-induced suberization had not been determined
until recently. Using various inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis and action, Lulai and
Suttle (2004) determined the involvement of ethylene in wound-induced suberization.
Ethylene biosynthesis was found to be stimulated by tuber wounding. Separate analysis for
accumulation of SPP and SPA on wound-induced cell walls showed that ethylene is not
required for wound-induced suberization of the closing layer or subsequent suberization
associated with wound periderm development.

Soliday et al. (1978) employed a gravimetric technique, diffusive resistance, to mea-
sure water vapor loss in wound-healing tissue. Results from this technique reflected
wax deposition as an indirect assessment of wound-healing responses and the effect of
various hormone treatments. They found that the development of resistance to water
vapor loss during wound healing was inhibited by indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and
cytokinin treatments, but stimulated by abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. They further
found that ABA and other ‘suberization induction factors’ could be washed from the
tuber tissue, thereby inhibiting suberization. ABA treatment of cultured potato cells
also resulted in increased accumulation of suberin components, waxes, and enzymes
involved in suberin biosynthesis including peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase

482

Lulai

(PAL), and (cid:4)-hydroxy-fatty acid dehydrogenase (Cottle and Kolattukudy, 1982b). Lulai
and Orr (1995), using a sensitive porometric technique for direct electronic measure-
ment of water vapor loss, found that ABA treatment hastened development of resistance
to water vapor loss during the first day of wound healing but made little difference
after that time point when SPP and later SPA began to accumulate. Schreiber et al.
(2005a) conducted detailed analysis of wax deposition during periderm maturation and
obtained results consistent with that of Lulai and Orr (1995). Schreiber et al. (2005a)
also found that even though periderm permeability quickly approached a nearly con-
stant value during periderm development and maturation, significant wax formation
continued. These results suggest that regulation of wax accumulation was still active
even though water vapor loss had been minimized. Collectively, the above results
indicate that ABA is involved in the regulation of wax accumulation and that water
vapor loss is controlled by wax accumulation during wound healing, but water vapor
loss may not be quantitatively used for assessing suberization. Lulai and Suttle (2005)
employed other technologies to determine the involvement of ABA in tuber wound-
induced suberization. Liquid chromotagraphy-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to
determine changes in tuber ABA content during wound healing. A specific xenobiotic
inhibitor of carotenoid (ABA precursor) biosynthesis was used to determine the effect
of metabolically blocking ABA biosynthesis during wound healing. Specific cytological
techniques were used to directly assess accumulation of SPP and SPA on suberizing
cell walls of inhibitor-treated tuber tissue during wound healing. The ability to block
ABA biosynthesis provided a non-correlative approach to help determine the role of ABA
in the regulation of wound responses. Tuber wounding resulted in an increase in ABA
concentration. Inhibition of ABA biosynthesis resulted in a diminution of tuber wound-
healing responses including reduced PAL activity, a mild delay in SPP accumulation,
a more noticeable delay in SPA accumulation on suberizing cell walls, and a signifi-
cant hampering in the reduction of water vapor loss. These results clearly indicate that
ABA has a role in wound-induced suberization but that other signaling factors could be
involved.

Jasmonic acid (JA) is included in the wide range of signaling/regulatory compounds
induced upon wounding and is involved in a range of wound responses such as insect
and disease resistance (Choi et al., 1994; Koda and Kikuta, 1994; Negrel et al., 1995;
de Bruxelles and Roberts, 2001; Schilmiller and Howe, 2005; Wasternack et al., 2006).
Yet, information on the involvement of JA in wound-induced suberization is sparse.
Two hydroxycinnamoyl transferases involved in suberin biosynthesis were shown to be
influenced by treatment with ABA; however, JA treatment did not significantly modify
the time course or intensity of the induction of these enzymes during wound healing
(Negrel et al., 1995). Wound-induced PAL activity and the associated accumulation of
phenolics in purple-flesh tubers with varying anthocyanin concentrations did not show
a response to methyl jasmonate treatment unless anthocyanin concentrations were low
(Reyes and Cisneros-Zevallos, 2003). Although under current investigation, there is little
other information available concerning the involvement or regulatory roles of JA in
tuber wound healing and suberization. Many signaling compounds, in addition to those
discussed in this section, are induced upon wounding, yet their involvement in the
regulation of suberization has not been determined.

Skin-set, wound healing, and related defects

483

22.3.4 Environmental effects on suberization

After induction, the rate of suberization is influenced by genotype (Lulai and Corsini,
1998), type or severity of wound or bruise (Lulai and Orr, 1995; Thomson et al., 1995),
physiological age (Thomson et al., 1995; Kumar and Knowles, 2003), a range of possi-
ble chemical treatments (Nolte et al., 1987; Gronwald, 1991; Oosterhaven et al., 1995),
and environmental conditions (e.g. relative humidity, temperature, and aeration includ-
ing oxygen/carbon dioxide concentrations) (Artschwager, 1927; Wigginton, 1974; Dean,
1989; Morris et al., 1989; Schaper et al., 1993). Relative humidity above 80%, preferably
90–95%, is needed to ensure that the cells at the wound site do not desiccate and die.
Low relative humidity after wounding may lead to tissue dehydration and result in a layer
of dead non-suberized cells over the wound. A layer of dead desiccated cells will not
resist penetration by pathogens or prevent water vapor loss and should not be confused
with suberized cells. Excessive humidity may result in a film of water over the wounds,
thereby restricting oxygen supply and causing cell proliferation both of which inhibit
suberization. If relative humidity and oxygen supply are favorable, the most important
environmental factor affecting suberization is temperature. Suberization increases from
2.5 to 25
C. The rate of suberization increases approximately three-fold between 5 and
10
C
(Artschwager, 1927; Wigginton, 1974; Dean, 1989; Morris et al., 1989). Suberization is
prevented at temperatures of 35
C and above. Excessively warm storage temperatures
directly after harvest can hamper suberization and result in infection and rapid decay.

C, increases another three-fold between 10 and 20

C, and is greatest near 25

Ample oxygen (air is approximately 21% oxygen) is required for suberization. Low
oxygen concentrations and carbon dioxide concentrations above ambient (air is approxi-
mately 0.03% carbon dioxide) inhibit suberization and wound periderm formation. Tuber
wounding from harvest and seed-cutting operations can quickly result in a three- to five-
fold increase in respiration, which within 24 h can increase another three- to five-fold
(Laties, 1978). Wound respiration may be 25 times that of the intact tuber by 24 h after
wounding. Fresh wound respiration is derived primarily from lipid. Within 24 h after
wounding, carbohydrate becomes the respiratory substrate. Carbon dioxide concentrations
increase while oxygen concentrations decrease within the potato storage; both conditions
inhibit suberization. Proper ventilation of freshly harvested tubers or cut seed is essen-
tial in maintaining oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations that promote suberization.
Unless properly ventilated, the carbon dioxide concentration in a storage bin of freshly
harvested skinned and bruised tubers can increase to well over 100 times that of ambient
air (Schaper et al., 1993).

22.3.5 Characteristics of the biopolymers that form suberin

The identification and description of suberin has been confusing in part because of its
complex and poorly understood composition and ultrastructure, and its similarities to
the plant polymers lignin and cutin (Kolattukudy, 1980; Cottle and Kolattukudy, 1982a;
Kolattukudy, 2001; Bernards, 2002). Lignin is composed of a dense polymeric matrix
of aromatic/phenolic monomers, and cutin is composed of hydroxy and epoxy aliphatic
monomers (Kolattukudy, 1980; Lewis et al., 1999). The biopolymer suberin is composed

484

Lulai

of both phenolic/aromatic and aliphatic/hydrophobic polymeric domains (Kolattukudy,
1980, 2001), which are spatially separate (Lulai and Morgan, 1992) and cross-linked by
glycerol (Moire et al., 1999; Graca and Pereira, 2000; Bernards, 2002). Because of the
polymeric and compositional nature of the phenolic/aromatic and aliphatic/hydrophobic
domains, they are now referred to as the suberin poly(phenolic) domain (SPPD) and
suberin poly (aliphatic) domain (SPAD) (Bernards, 2002). The SPPD had been referred to
as lignin-like (Kolattukudy, 1980; Cottle and Kolattukudy, 1982a). The complex biosyn-
thesis and macromolecular assembly of the SPP biopolymer on the cell wall may have
similarities to that of lignin and involve dirigent proteins and sites (Lewis et al., 1999;
Davin and Lewis, 2000). However, the SPPD lacks the dense matrix of guaiacyl and
syringyl phenylpropane units characteristic of lignin (Lapierre et al., 1996). Detailed
labeling and spectroscopic studies clearly showed that the phenolic domain of suberin
has a very low monolignol content, about one-tenth that of wood or straw, and instead is
largely composed of hydroxycinnamic acids and associated derivatives (Bernards et al.,
1995; Lapierre et al., 1996; Bernards, 2002). Also, confusion arises because lignin and
the SPPD react similarly to histological analyses, such as phloroglucinol and other treat-
ments, and both autofluoresce under commonly used epifluorescent microscopy. Results
of Lulai (2005) may be interpreted to indicate that, in some cases, pathogen-induced
accumulation of SPP on the cell wall may have been mistaken for lignification in other
published reports. SPAs, like cutin, are composed of fatty acid monomers. However,
unlike cutin, suberin aliphatics are made up of (cid:4)-hydroxy and (cid:3)(cid:5) (cid:4)-dicarboxylic acids,
which can be of equal or longer chain length than cuticular aliphatics and lack the char-
acteristic cuticular epoxy and internal chain hydroxy groups (Kolattukudy and Dean,
1974; Dean and Kolattukudy, 1977; Kolattukudy, 1980). Bernards (2002) indicated a
possible role for epoxy fatty acids in hydroxylation reactions involved in SPA biosyn-
thesis. Although SPP and SPA accumulations are tightly coupled, if conditions are not
favorable, SPP accumulation on the cell wall may terminate before completion and SPA
accumulation will not occur as has been demonstrated in tuber pink-eye tissues (Lulai
et al., 2006). There have been no reports of wound-induced SPA accumulation on the
primary cell wall without first accumulating SPP about the entire cell wall nor have
there been demonstrations of SPA accumulation on a polyphenolic matrix that had been
fully characterized as lignin. These features help define the two biopolymers, SPP and
SPA, that form the phenolic/hydrophilic and aliphatic/hydrophobic domains of suberin.
Molecular genetic similarities and differences between cutin and suberin continue to be
uncovered (Yephremov and Schreiber, 2005).

22.3.6 Suberization: closing layer and wound periderm formation

The hierarchy for wound-induced accumulation of SPP and SPA on the suberizing cell
walls also differs. The process of closing layer formation, i.e. primary suberization, is cell
specific, occurring one cell layer at a time beginning with the first layer of viable cells
neighboring the wound site. SPP accumulates on the cell walls in a segmented fashion,
first on the outer tangential walls of the cells in the first layer followed by accumulation
on the radial cell walls and then the inner tangential cell walls (Lulai and Corsini,
1998). After SPP accumulation on the cell wall is complete, SPA begins to accumulate

and does so relatively uniformly about the inner perimeter of the cell. SPA does not
accumulate in a pronounced segmented fashion like that of SPP. As SPA accumulates,
presumably in conjunction with glycerol, over the SPP in the cells of the first layer, SPP
accumulates in a segmented fashion on the walls of the cells in the second cell layer.
SPA accumulation follows completion of SPP deposition on the second layer and so on.
Generally, under favorable conditions, primary suberization will continue until there are
about two or three layers of suberized parenchyma cells forming the closing layer. At
this time, the wound phellogen will have sufficiently developed and will form additional
suberized cells, i.e. wound phellem, directly beneath the closing layer. In addition, a layer
of wound phelloderm cells is formed beneath the wound phellogen (Lulai and Corsini,
1998; Lulai, 2001a). These three cell types, i.e. phellem, phellogen, and phelloderm,
comprise the wound periderm (Reeve et al., 1969), but it is the suberized cells of the
closing layer and wound phellem that provide the durable protective barrier (Lulai and
Corsini, 1998).

It is important to note that primary suberization, i.e. formation of the closing layer,
involves suberization of existing cell walls. Therefore, these suberized cells do not derive
from progenitor cells in meristems, i.e. not from a distinct cambium/meristematic layer.
Arguably, these suberized cells may play a more important role than those of the wound
phellem because they provide the first suberized form of durable and broad-ranging resis-
tance to infection over the wound (Lulai and Corsini, 1998). Interestingly, the biological
differences involved in suberization of closing layer cells and that of wound phellem cells
derived from the wound periderm, i.e. secondary suberization, are not known. Develop-
ment of the closing layer provides a unique perspective compared with that of wound
phellem development because SPP accumulation must occur in conjunction with the
existing primary cell wall. Whether there are fine biosynthetic and structural differences
between suberized cell walls of the closing layer and wound phellem is not certain.

22.3.7 Suberin biosynthesis and structure

Suberization requires biosynthesis of phenolic, aliphatic, and glycerol monomers and
assembly of these monomers into the two separate biopolymeric domains, the SPPD
and the SPAD. Together, the SPPD and the SPAD comprise the suberin barrier. The
composition, biosynthesis, and associated macromolecular assembly of these phenolic
and aliphatic biopolymers into their respective domains on the cell wall continue to be
described through hypothetical models and schemes because the pathways and mecha-
nisms of assembly are only partially elucidated. Suberin biosynthesis is an important area
of research that is complicated by the distinctly different biochemical pathways required
for SPP and SPA syntheses, assembly, glycerol cross-linking, and placement on/in the
cell wall. Detailed issues associated with SPP and SPA biosyntheses have been reviewed
and will not be repeated in this chapter (Bernards and Lewis, 1998; Bernards, 2002).
The SPPD and SPAD have been shown to be spatially separate and their time courses
for wound-induced accumulation on the cell wall initiated at distinctly different times
(Lulai and Morgan, 1992; Lulai and Corsini, 1998). SPP biosynthesis occurs prior to
that of SPA (Kolattukudy, 1980). Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data
(Stark and Garbow, 1992) and ultrastructural analysis also show that the SPAD is distinct

and spatially separate from the SPPD and primary cell wall (Fig. 22.4). Although spatial
features and architecture of the SPPD accumulated on/into the primary cell wall are not
clear, spectroscopic data indicate that the aromatic carbons of the SPPD and glycosidic
carbons of cell wall polysaccharides are in proximity, perhaps 0.05 nm (Yan and Stark,
2000). Wound signals induce enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway to provide the
phenolic precursors for the biosynthesis of SPP (Kolattukudy, 1980) (Fig. 22.5A). The
first enzyme of this pathway, PAL, which produces cinnamic acid for further biosynthesis,
is essential and its inhibition prevents formation of the SPP barrier (Cottle and Kolat-
tukudy, 1982a; Hammerschmidt, 1984; Bostock and Stermer, 1989; Bernards and Lewis,
1998). Hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, primarily ferulic acid and N -feruloyltyramine
in wound-induced suberin, are channeled to comprise a major part of the SPPD (Bernards
and Lewis, 1992; Bernards et al., 1995, 2000; Negrel et al., 1996). Ferulate esters of
long-chain fatty alcohols, hypothesized to act as bioplasticizers, are found in the wound
periderm (Bernards and Lewis, 1992; Bernards, 2002); however, little has been indi-
cated about the presence of these alkyl ferulates in native periderm. Information on the
composition of the SPPD has largely been obtained by analysis of end products from
harsh chemical degradation treatments, which inherently alter the structure of the final
monomers to be identified. NMR analysis of wound periderm confirmed that sinapyl and
guaiacyl structures are part of the SPPD (Yan and Stark, 2000), and LC-MS techniques
have been developed, which quantitatively show that there are differences in the biosyn-
thetic flux of phenylpropanoids, i.e. formation and conversion of specific monomers into
SPP during tuber wound healing (Matsuda et al., 2003).

Peroxidases and H2O2 formation are induced upon wounding and are required for
suberization, possibly in a peroxidase-mediated coupling process cross-linking phenolics
within the SPPD and attachment to the cell wall (Espelie et al., 1986; Bernards et al.,
1999, 2004; Bernards and Razem, 2001; Razem and Bernards, 2003). A model has been
constructed whereby phenolics are synthesized in the cytoplasm, transported to the cell
wall (by an unknown mechanism), and polymerized by a wall-associated peroxidase
into the SPPD (Bernards and Razem, 2001). The polymeric attachments to the cell wall
are at discrete sites (Stark and Garbow, 1992). Specific peroxidases have been deter-
mined to preferentially cross-link suberin phenolics but not monolignols (Bernards et al.,
1999). In vitro studies have shown that there are several specific combinations of cross-
coupling products formed by peroxidase-catalyzed polymerization of hydroxycinnamic
acids (Arrieta-Baez and Stark, 2006). The identity of these coupling products provides
important insight into the molecular architecture of suberin and the structural requisites
that impart durable protective properties to the barrier. The construction of the SPPD is
particularly perplexing when the ambiguities of SPP biosynthesis, phenolic transport, and
polymeric assembly are combined with polymeric attachment at discrete sites on the cell
wall in conjunction with the segmented hierarchy for SPP accumulation on the cell wall.
the SPAD involves fatty acid synthesis and the creation of
aliphatic monomers from palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0), and oleic (18:1) acids
(Fig. 22.5B). The suberin aliphatics are composed primarily of (cid:4)-hydroxy acids and the
corresponding dicarboxylic acids and smaller amounts of long (cid:6)>C20(cid:7) chain acids and
corresponding alcohols (Kolattukudy, 1978). Fatty acid monomers are substrate to a
chain elongation system (Kolattukudy, 1978), which now appears to be microsomal and

is covalently attached to carbohydrate units of the cell wall. Glycerol units are used to cross-link suberin
poly(aliphatic) monomers and account for the lamellae found within the suberin poly(aliphatic) domain SPAD.
The SPAD is illustrated using two lamellae and is covalently attached to the SPPD through easily hydrolyzed
ester linkages. Very long-chain fatty acids and waxes are not illustrated within this diagram but are thought to
be embedded in the aliphatic domain. Ferulates esterified to long-chain fatty alcohols are integrated into the
aliphatic domain and are thought to act as plasticizers. The constituents are connected to C, carbohydrate; P,

elongate through malonyl-CoA as substrate (Schreiber et al., 2000, 2005b). The fatty acids
are presumed to undergo (cid:4)-hydroxylation, similar to cutin, and then further conversion
to dicarboxylic acids in reactions that may have some uniqueness to SPA biosynthe-
sis (Kolattukudy, 1980). The (cid:4)-hydroxy fatty acids are converted to (cid:4)-oxo fatty acids
through an NADP-dependent oxidoreductase (i.e. (cid:4)-hydroxy fatty acid dehydrogenase)
that is wound inducible. A constitutive (cid:4)-oxoacid dehydrogenase catalyzes the conver-
sion of the (cid:4)-oxoacid to the dicarboxylic acid. These enzymes have been separated and
the dehydrogenase enzyme purified and characterized. The catalytic properties of the
(cid:4)-hydroxy fatty acid dehydrogenase appear to be distinct from alcohol dehydrogenase
(Agrawal and Kolattukudy, 1977, 1978a,b; Kolattukudy, 2001). Kinetic studies involving
chain-length substrate specificity suggest that the pocket of the active site of the (cid:4)-fatty
acid dehydrogenase enzyme limits binding of longer chain (cid:6)>C18(cid:7) substrate, which may
explain the presence of dicarboxylic acids in the range of C18 and (cid:4)-hydroxy fatty acids of
longer chain length (Kolattukudy, 2001). Tracking the flux of aliphatic monomers of the
SPAD during wound healing further demonstrated that the newly formed acids had two
possible metabolic fates: (1) desaturation and oxidation to form suberin C18 (cid:4)-hydroxy
and dioic acids, and (2) elongation to form very long-chain fatty acids (cid:6)C20–C28(cid:7) asso-
ciated with reduction to 1-alkanols, decarboxylation to n-alkanes, and minor amounts
of hydroxylation (Yang and Bernards, 2006). In some plant tissues, fatty 9,10-epoxides
may be hydroxylated during suberization, thereby creating a hypothetical role for these
compounds in SPA biosynthesis (Bernards, 2002). Glycerol is brought into the SPA
biosynthetic scheme and incorporated into the polymer at about the same rate as that
of the major/diagnostic suberin monomers, (cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:4)-alkanedoic acids (dicarboxylic acids),
thus suggesting cross-linking of aliphatic and aromatic domains (Moire et al., 1999). The
cross-linking hypothesis is supported by ultrastructural data, which show that the alter-
nating electron-transparent regions found within the electron-dense areas of the suberin
aliphatic domain have dimensions similar to that created by a C-22 hydrocarbon located
between two glycerol molecules (Schmutz et al., 1996; Moire et al., 1999). The lamellae
dimensions match with the tentative model for the structure of potato suberin (Fig. 22.6).
The source for glycerol in the suberin model is hypothesized to be dihydroxyacetone
phosphate (Fig. 22.5B) (Bernards, 2002). However, the complete pathway for these pro-
cesses is not fully known including how these specialized fatty acids and glycerol are
assembled to form the SPAD. Nor is it clear how these monomers or oligomers are
transported on to the cell wall after some apparent resident time elsewhere while construc-
tion of the SPPD is being completed. As with the SPPD, the construction of the SPAD
becomes more complicated and perplexing when attempting to integrate the biosynthesis

and coordinated macromolecular assembly of the SPA biopolymer as it accumulates in a
non-segmented fashion over the SPPD on the cell wall.

22.3.8 Suberization and resistance to infection

Suberization and loosely defined wound periderm development have been suggested
to play various roles in resistance to tuber infection (Nnodu et al., 1982; O’Brien and
Leach, 1983; Nolte et al., 1987; Bostock and Stermer, 1989; Lyon, 1989; Vaughn and
Lulai, 1991; Pérombelon, 2002). However, resistance to bacterial and fungal infections
was often poorly related to the various definitions for suberin and wound periderm;
consequently, the roles of suberin in resisting bacterial and fungal infections had not been
clearly resolved. Lulai and Corsini (1998) determined that the hierarchy for SPP and SPA
accumulations during wound healing is responsible for the differential development of
resistance to bacterial and then fungal penetration. Total resistance to bacterial infection
occurred after the SPP accumulation was complete along the contiguous outer tangential
walls of the first layer of cells (2–3 days) in the closing layer. However, the SPP
accumulation offered no protection against fungal infection even after SPP accumulation
advanced to the adjoining radial and inner tangential cell walls. Fungi could breach the
SPP barrier and thereby provide an entry for bacterial infections such as Erwinia caro-
tovora ssp. carotovora. Lulai and Corsini (1998) indicated that this process is responsible
for the confusing development of resistance to bacteria, followed by fungal infection
and subsequent susceptibility to bacterial infection. Resistance to infection by the fungal
agent that causes dry rot, Fusarium sambucinum, began to develop after accumulation
of SPA was initiated. The final form of full resistance to fungal infection occurred upon
completion of SPA accumulation on the first layer of cells. The specificity of the SPA
domain as a barrier to fungi has been further demonstrated at the cellular level by blockage
of advancement of fungal hyphae within pink-eye-afflicted tubers (Lulai et al., 2006).

The knowledge gaps and ambiguities associated with wound healing and wound-
induced suberization are of great importance because of the critical roles that rapid
suberization plays in minimizing food-quality deterioration, shrinkage, defects, and per-
haps the most easily and widely recognized problem of infection by a wide range of
bacterial and fungal pathogens.

22.4 RELATED DEFECTS

22.4.1 Wound-related tuber defects

Various forms of wound-related defects, i.e. those caused by different types of bruising
and growth anomalies, are responsible for a range of tuber quality problems and losses.
Reviews indicate that bruising and associated defects may range from 9 to 40% and that
they are influenced by genetics, cultural conditions/practices, and handling procedures
(Storey and Davies, 1992; Brook, 1996; McGarry et al., 1996). The types of defects and
associated disorders that may fit this general category are variable. Many of these defects
and disorders are poorly described because of the dearth of published information and

Skin-set, wound healing, and related defects

493

the frequent use of untested hypotheses as fact. The discussion herein will primarily deal
with the wound-related issues of these defects and will not delve deeply into other details.

22.4.2 Shatter bruising and tuber cracking

Shatter bruising and cracking results from mechanical impact stresses incurred during
potato harvest and handling operations (Thornton, 2001). The internal shattering or crack-
ing of tuber tissue to the surface is a serious problem because of the impaired suberization
inherent with this type of wound. This type of bruise damage results in a combination of
problems including disease, severe defects created by discoloration, and the development
of scars from the wound. The impairment of suberization in these cracks is inherent and
is a significant cause for the exacerbation of the defect. The impaired suberization of
these bruise wounds exemplifies the differences in wound healing created by irregular
versus smooth wound surfaces, and altered oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations
at the wound site (Section 22.3.4). Wound healing in the microenvironment of a shatter
bruise or tuber crack can be especially hindered because of the irregular wound surface
and the confinement of the narrow wound crevasse compared with that of a smooth cut.
The amount of cell damage and respiration increases proportionally with the larger wound
surface area created by the irregular fracture of the shatter bruise. The carbon dioxide
concentrations would be expected to increase and the oxygen concentrations decrease
in the confined area formed by the wound crevice of a shatter bruise. Ventilation into
the confined area of a tuber crack is difficult. Roughened or irregular wound surface
areas severely hamper development of contiguous SPP accumulation in the formation
of a closing layer and consequently also impair formation of a wound periderm. The
irregular surface area and likelihood of a hypoxic environment predispose shatter bruises
and cracks to hindered suberization and increased susceptibility to infection (Vayda et al.,
1992; Lulai and Corsini, 1998; Lulai, 2001a,b).

Higher tuber turgor appears to increase susceptibility to dynamic failure, i.e. shattering
and cracking, whereas higher temperature decreases failure rates (Smittle et al., 1974;
Bajema et al., 1998). Tuber size also influences failure properties; tubers weighing more
than 340 g are significantly more likely to undergo dynamic failure in the form of shat-
ter bruise/cracking whereas tubers of 170–340 g showed little difference in failure rates
throughout their range (Baritelle and Hyde, 1999). Managing tuber turgor, especially on
rain-fed land, and managing harvest temperature can create unworkable approaches to
minimize shattering. Further improvement of mechanical harvesting procedures and bio-
logically improving the rate of suberization and cell–cell adhesion are feasible approaches
to develop technologies to reduce shatter bruise/cracking defects. For example, poly-
galacutronic acid of low ester content has been shown to play a role in cell–cell adhesion
at ‘edge-of-face regions’ of tuber parenchyma cells (Parker et al., 2001).

22.4.3 Blackspot and pressure/crush bruising

Blackspot is an internal discoloration of the tuber cortical parenchyma found beneath
an impact or pressure bruise. A significant amount of research has been conducted
on impact-induced blackspot bruise development, while there has been less research

494

Lulai

on pressure bruising and pressure bruise-induced blackspot development. In general,
tubers of higher specific gravity have a lower bruise threshold, a lower bruise resistance,
or both (Baritelle and Hyde, 2003). Depending on the genotype, less severe impact
bruising and impact bruising sustained by tubers at warmer temperatures or by tubers
with lower turgor tend not to result in tuber shattering or cracking (Smittle et al., 1974;
Brook, 1996; McGarry et al., 1996; Bajema et al., 1998; Baritelle and Hyde, 1999,
2001). Instead, these impact bruises result in cellular damage or physiological disruption
and the development of blue-black or gray-black discoloration in tissues beneath the
tuber surface. These dark bruise discolorations are referred to as blackspot. Although
other secondary mechanisms have been implicated, further evidence indicates that the
discolorations are primarily a result of oxidation of tyrosine by polyphenol oxidase and
subsequent reactions to form melanin, which in combination with cysteine influences
coloration of the pigment (Dean et al., 1992, 1993; Stevens and Davelaar, 1996, 1997;
Edgell et al., 1998; Stevens et al., 1998; Partington et al., 1999; Laerke et al., 2002).
Antioxidants normally found within the tuber, such as ascorbic acid, may be involved
in limiting the enzymatic formation of melanin (Delgado et al., 2001b; Pawelzik et al.,
2005). Intracellular compartmentation is an important factor in determining susceptibility
to blackspot development (Laerke et al., 2002). McGarry et al. (1996) pointed out that
these wound-related discolorations involve compromising the integrity of intracellular
membranes and bringing the polyphenol oxidase enzyme, located in the plastid membrane,
i.e. amyloplast, into contact with phenolic substrates that are putatively in the vacuole.
There is evidence that certain field applications of soluble calcium during plant growth will
enhance tuber calcium concentrations and reduce blackspot bruising presumably through
improved cell membrane stability and stronger cell walls (Karlsson et al., 2006). Although
blackspot development is indicative of cellular disruption within the tuber, indications of
wounding on the surface of the tuber are often difficult to detect. Blackspot detection is
accomplished by peeling to expose the darkened areas within the cortical parenchyma.
Surface detection of wounds, including less obvious bruised areas that involve damaged
periderm, which may develop into blackspot or a surface blemish, may be detected in
freshly harvested tubers by testing with catechol or other peroxidizable substrate that
produces a detectable color difference. Freshly bruised tubers are submerged in a solution
of catechol and then visually inspected for oxidative color change of the catechol on the
tuber surface (Gould, 1989). Methods have been developed to assess the biochemical
potential of potato tubers to discolor and darken in vitro. However, it appears that the
conditions for in vitro analysis, possibly including oxygen concentration, are not always
fully consistent with the biochemical potential of tubers to discolor and develop blackspot
(Delgado et al., 2001a; Laerke et al., 2002). Although the mechanisms associated with the
development of blackspot discoloration have been partially characterized, little is known
about other wound responses that may or may not be induced by bruising including
suberization of cells in the proximity of this type of internal wound.

Pressure bruising or crushing occurs at the tuber–tuber contact points or tuber–storage
structure contact points during storage and is caused by excessive pressures created by
potato pile heights of 3.5–4.0 m or greater (Schaper and Yaeger, 1982). The constant
pressure created by the weight of the pile on tubers located at lower depths in a potato
storage bin may cause the tuber surfaces at the points of contact to become flattened or

Skin-set, wound healing, and related defects

495

indented creating a surface blemish. Cellular damage in the cortical parenchyma under
the pressure bruise area may result in the development of blackspot discolorations (Lulai
et al., 1996). Although this periderm damage may not be visible to the eye, the pressure
often creates a layer of crushed cells and debris, presumably from the phellogen and
possibly phelloderm. This layer is found under the tough phellem cells that are also
often damaged. High water vapor conductance resulting from wounding normally rapidly
declines during the first 24–36 h after the tuber is cut (Lulai and Orr, 1995). However,
water vapor conductance through the pressure bruised areas was approximately three
times higher than that of control areas and remained high, without decline, for up to
4 days after removal from the pressures created by the storage environment. These results
indicate that there was no induction of wax biosynthesis/accumulation as these cells were
damaged by storage pressures. Nor was there induction of wax biosynthesis/accumulation
at these bruise points after the tubers were removed from the pressures created by the
storage environment and after atmospheric oxygen was readily available. Most, but not
all, of the pressure bruise areas showed no induction of suberization. Wound healing
responses, including suberization and reduced water vapor conductance, as an indication
of wax deposition, were inhibited in tuber cells damaged by pressure bruising and in
neighboring cells (Lulai et al., 1996). The continued pressure and tight tuber contact at
the pressure bruise site would restrict the supply of oxygen from the ventilation stream
to the damaged cells. However, oxygen would be available to the pressure bruise areas
after removal from the bin. The changes in oxygen availability to cells compromised by
pressure bruise could influence blackspot development during and after removal from
storage. Proper humidification to reduce loss of turgor is important in minimizing cellular
damage and defect development associated with pressure bruising.

22.4.4 Growth cracks

Tuber growth cracks are fully healed wounds that develop during tuber growth. These
cracks occur after rain or irrigation prompts rapid water uptake resulting in increased
tuber turgor pressure and growth (Storey and Davies, 1992; Hiller and Thornton, 1993;
Thornton, 2001). Internal pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the surface tissues
during tuber enlargement; the resulting tissue failure results in a physical cracking of the
tuber surface. The cracks frequently occur on the bud end of the tuber, usually extend
lengthwise in the tubers, and vary in length and depth. There is little published information
describing the physiology of growth cracks and associated wound healing. The apparent
lack of disease associated with growth cracks suggests that these wounds heal readily as
the tubers grow in the soil. Growth cracks may also result from various infections and
chemical treatments.

22.4.5 Skinning

Tuber skinning injury is a superficial wound generally inflicted by mechanical forces dur-
ing harvest and handling, which results in the fracture of fragile radial phellogen cell walls
of the native periderm and loss of the protective layer of phellem cells (Section 22.2).
Radial phellogen cell walls connect and physically hold the tuber phellem (skin) in place.

496

Lulai

These cell walls are thin and fragile while the phellogen of the native periderm is meris-
tematically active during growth; tubers are susceptible to skinning/excoriation during
this time. As the potato plant senesces and growth terminates, phellogen meristematic
activity ceases, the phellogen cell walls strengthen/thicken, and the tuber becomes resis-
tant to skinning, i.e. skin-set develops. Skinning results in discoloration of the wounded
area, release of water sequestered within tuber cells, loss of turgor and increased sus-
ceptibility to associated pressure bruising and blackspot development, and creation of
areas that are open to infection. Red-skinned genotypes are generally most susceptible to
skinning injury and require more time for periderm maturation and proper skin-set devel-
opment. The reason for red-skinned genotypes being predisposed to hindered skin-set
development is not known. The red-skin pigment is not synthesized and replaced during
wound healing, thus leaving a light off-color blemish amid the red skin. Depending on
the maturity of the potato plant at the end of the growing season, no less than 10 days and
generally 21 days of periderm maturation are routinely recommended for proper skin-set
before harvest (Lulai and Orr, 1993; Struik and Wiersema, 1999; Olsen et al., 2003; Stark
and Love, 2003). The wounding caused by skinning injury is frequently categorized as
a bruise and can contribute to significant increases in carbon dioxide concentrations in
storage bins directly after harvest (Mazza and Siemens, 1990; Schaper et al., 1993). The
increased carbon dioxide concentration adversely affects suberization and can increase
the reducing sugar concentrations and darkening of processed food products (Mazza and
Siemens, 1990). Skinning injuring is among the most common yet troublesome and costly
problems of the potato industry.

22.5 SUMMARY

A healthy intact periderm is essential for protecting the potato tuber from desiccation,
infection, pests, and other intrusions that cause food quality and supply problems and
financial losses. A comprehensive understanding of the physiological and biochemical
processes associated with skin-set, wound healing, and wound-related responses to bruis-
ing is essential for the development of technologies to minimize these problems. Advances
have been made; however, the understanding of these processes is far from complete.

Research has shown that skin-set development is not caused by skin thickening, suber-
ization, or increased tensile strength of the skin. Instead, phellogen cell wall strengthening
and cell wall thickening within the periderm have been shown to be responsible for
the development of resistance to tuber skinning injury. Immunolocalization data indicate
that accumulation and modification of specific cell wall polymers are among those pro-
cesses involved in skin-set development. Further information is needed on the biological
processes that are involved in tuber phellogen cell wall strengthening and skin-set devel-
opment. The biological signals that initiate and regulate skin-set development have not
been elucidated. This lack of biological information hinders development of technologies
to predict, initiate, and/or enhance the development of resistance to skinning injury.

Wound-induced suberization is perhaps the most important facet of wound healing.
Tubers cut for seed, wounded by various means including harvest/handling processes,
and tubers challenged by various biotic and abiotic stresses utilize suberization as the

Skin-set, wound healing, and related defects

497

most durable form of protection. A competent suberized barrier protects the tuber from
infection, dehydration, and various intrusions. The SPPD has been shown to provide
resistance to bacterial but not fungal infection. The SPAD is architecturally distinct and
spatially separate from the phenolic domain and is required to provide the final barrier to
fungal infection. Associated waxes are part of the protective mechanism that controls water
vapor loss. The induction and regulation of suberin biosynthesis, the biosynthetic pathways
as well as the assembly and molecular architecture of the suberin biopolymer are of
fundamental importance in enhancing wound healing and solving wound-related problems.
A better understanding of these processes and the structure of suberin is on the horizon.
However, it is obvious that further research is required in all these areas to provide the
basis for the development of new technologies that will enhance suberization and mitigate
associated food quality and loss problems. Lastly, wound-related responses are crucial
elements of the various bruise-related problems and losses described in section 22.4.

Internal Physiological Disorders

and Nutritional and Compositional Factors

that Affect Market Quality

23.1 INTRODUCTION

‘Potato quality’ is a diverse term covering features such as texture, colour of raw and pro-
cessed product, external and internal tuber morphology, general appearance and nutritive
value. Potato tubers are made up of hydrated, highly respiring, mainly parenchymatous
cells that are metabolically responsive to their environment (Peterson et al., 1985). Inter-
nal physiological tuber disorders that reduce the market quality of potatoes originate from
abiotic stresses that are non-infectious in nature. Although the qualities of tubers are pre-
set by their genetic limits, their final compositional and nutritional value is influenced by
variables such as fertility, soil type and agronomic practices, as well as by environmental
conditions experienced during growth and development in the field. Just as biotic stress
(e.g. bacteria, fungi, viruses, phytoplasms and nematodes) can severely affect crop yield
and tuber quality, internal physiological disorders can impact the salability of fresh and
processed potato products. Economic loss from biotic stress can range from minor to
complete loss dependent on the severity of the disease. Losses resulting from internal
physiological disorders are more indeterminate in nature as they are influenced not only by
severity and percentage of tubers affected but also by supply and demand. Economic loss
due to internal physiological disorders may be greatest during years when potatoes are in
abundant supply. Although tubers with external defects can be graded-out going into stor-
age, internal damage is not visible until the tuber is peeled or sliced. Generally, internal
physiological disorders are relatively slow in expression. Considerable time may elapse
between the initiation or induction stage and the manifestation of symptoms, making it
difficult to identify the causal factors and the time of initiation (Hiller et al., 1985).

Although there is extreme genotypic variation in a cultivar’s ability to resist internal
physiological disorders (Collier et al., 1980; Rex and Mazza, 1989; Davies and Monk-
Talbot, 1990; Wannamaker and Collins, 1992; Lambert et al., 1996; McGarry et al.,
1996), such variation has not been previously exploited fully to dissect the genetics and
biochemistry of the key processes affected (Davies, 1998). Since 1985, some advances
have been made into the biological features of brown centre (BC), hollow heart (HH),
internal brown/rust spot, internal heat necrosis (IHN), stem-end discolouration (SED),

translucency and mottling disorders. Black heart is a condition where the supply of oxygen
to the tuber is deficient or impaired leading to dark, necrotic cavities that develop within
its centre. As this disorder is easily diagnosed and chiefly leads to cellular disruption and
death (Olsen et al., 2003), it will not be discussed further in this chapter.

Primarily, this chapter will attempt to identify key biological and molecular changes
that accompany the establishment of certain internal physiological disorders in potatoes
used for crisp (chip) and French fry production. An effort will be made to look for
possible biological traits peculiar to resistant cultivars to aid in the selection of plants with
superior genotypes and/or with which existing genotypes can be enhanced for improved
tolerance. Secondarily, gross tuber compositional and nutritional elements that have a
major effect on post-harvest market quality of potatoes will be discussed along with a
description of a commercially used method to manage the ‘chemical maturity’ (sugar
levels) of potatoes from harvest through storage. Owing to the vast amount of literature
on some of the above topics, appropriate reviews are cited for the sake of brevity.

23.2 GENERAL NATURE, INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF INTERNAL

PHYSIOLOGICAL DISORDERS

Many of the internal physiological disorders in potatoes are related in that they produce
coloured (rust or brown) or translucent (TransL) (devoid of starch) areas in distinct parts
of the tubers, which in time become necrotic resulting in cellular death. It is obvious from
the literature that some, if not all, of these internal physiological disorders are induced,
in part, or exacerbated by high temperature. A fluctuation in moisture availability is also
a recurring factor that is suggested to initiate or increase the magnitude of many internal
physiological disorders. Inducing conditions are complex and result from uneven tuber
growth affected by irregular temperature/moisture relationships (Sowokinos et al., 1985;
Lulai et al., 1986; Olsen et al., 2003), substandard fertilization regimes and/or soil types
(Nelson, 1970; Simmons and Kelling, 1987; Lambert et al., 1996), excess nitrogen (Kallio,
1960; Rex and Mazza, 1989) and an inadequate supply of calcium (cid:2)Ca2+
(cid:3) (Collier et al.,
1980; Kratzke and Palta, 1985, 1986; Monk and Davies, 1989; Davies and Monk-Talbot,
1990; Olsen et al., 1996; Kleinhenz et al., 1999; Ozgen et al., 2006). The type of soil,
rainfall, planting date and seedling rate have more influence on the magnitude of the
disorder than on its incidence (Iritani et al., 1984; Lambert et al., 1996). The impact of
these factors on the magnitude of the disorders also varies widely across cultivars. In
this chapter, key internal physiological disorders of potatoes are discussed in an attempt
to clarify major causal factors as well as to identify metabolic changes that may be
distinctive to their development.

23.2.1 Calcium nutrition and tuber quality

Several recent studies have demonstrated that the severity and incidence of some internal
physiological disorders can be mitigated by in-season calcium application (Tawfik and
Palta, 1992; Olsen et al., 1996; Kleinhenz et al., 1999; Karlsson et al., 2001; Ozgen et al.,
2006). Lack of calcium has been documented to cause severe deficiency symptoms in

Internal physiological disorders, nutritional and compositional factors

503

the tissues and organs of numerous plants (Bangerth, 1979). Calcium is involved not
only in maintaining the structural integrity of the cell but also in regulating metabolic
processes (Burstrom, 1968). Over 30 physiological plant disorders have been associated
with calcium deficiency as originally reviewed by Shear (1975) and Maynard (1979).
The important role of calcium as a second messenger in the signal transduction process
in plants has been reviewed by Poovaiah and Reddy (1993). Calcium contributes to the
maintenance of cell membrane permeability and cell wall structure by forming stable
but reversible linkages between the polar head groups in the membranes and pectic acid
fraction in the cell wall (Clarkson and Hanson, 1980; Hanson, 1984; Palta, 1996).

Recently, it has been suggested that calcium moves predominately (if not exclusively)
with water through the zylem (Palta, 1996). The discovery of functional roots present
on the tuber at the tuber–stolon junction and on the stolon associated with the tuber has
helped to modify the view of calcium nutrition of potato tubers (Fig. 23.1) (Kratzke and
Palta, 1985; Struckmeyer and Palta, 1986). By feeding a water-soluble dye, these authors
demonstrated that these tiny roots were able to supply water to the tuber. In a follow-up
study using a divided pot system, where supplemental calcium could be applied either
in the tuber area or to the main root system, Kratzke and Palta (1986) found that adding
calcium to the main root system did not increase calcium concentration of the tuber tissue.
However, applying calcium to the tuber and stolon area resulted in a three-fold increase in
calcium concentration in the tuber peel and medullary tissue. More recently, by studying
simultaneous transport of a water-soluble dye and 45Ca2+
, Busse and Palta (in press) have
demonstrated that tiny roots on the stolons can supply water and calcium to the tuber.
In support of these studies, Simmons and Kelling (1987), Simmons et al. (1988) and
Kleinhenz et al. (1999) found that maximum increase in tuber calcium occurred when

it was applied in the hill where the tubers develop. Similarly, using an artificial system,
Krauss and Marschner (1971) reported higher calcium content in potato tubers when it
was applied to the tuber and stolon area as opposed to the basal root system. Using this
concept, a number of studies have also demonstrated that in-season application of calcium
around the tuber and stolon area not only increased tuber calcium but also reduced the
incidence of internal physiological disorders (Tawfik and Palta, 1992; Kleinhenz et al.,
1999; Karlsson et al., 2001).

Internal physiological disorders due to calcium deficiency are usually associated with
tissues that experience a low rate of transpiration, such as fruits, underground storage
organs and enclosed leafy structures (Bangerth, 1979). Potato tubers, being storage organs
and surrounded by moist soil, also have very low transpiration. Thus, a very small amount
of water moves to the tubers resulting in relatively low calcium concentration in the tuber
tissue as compared with leaves and above-ground stems (Palta, 1996). Calcium deficiency
in tuber tissue is even greater for potatoes grown in sandy soil because of the low level of
exchangeable calcium in these soils. Internal physiological disorders are induced, in part,
and/or are exacerbated by temperature stress. There is considerable evidence that calcium
can mitigate plant responses to temperature stress (Palta, 1996). This is especially true
for heat stress in potatoes (Tawfik et al., 1996; Kleinhenz and Palta, 2002). Furthermore,
Vega et al. (1996) found an improvement in freezing stress tolerance of wild potato
germplasm by supplemental calcium fertilization.

Selection of potato genotypes with superior stolon and tuber root systems may also help
to increase post-harvest potato quality. Bamberg and coworkers (1993) screened tuber-
bearing Solanum germplasm for their ability to accumulate tuber calcium when a control
level is available and for ability to respond when higher levels are available. Solanum
species Solanum gourlayi and Solanum microdontum had the ability to have higher
tuber calcium content than Solanum tuberosum in one or both of these measurements.
This material may provide a valuable resource for breeding cultivars that are more
efficient calcium accumulators. Variation in resultant progeny may provide the germplasm
necessary to clarify the biological, genetic and molecular traits directly responsible for
tuber resistance to internal physiological potato disorders. In addition to bringing desired
genes from the wild germplasm, it appears that variation in cultivated germplasm could
also be exploited to improve calcium concentration of desired genotypes (Vega et al.,
1996).

23.2.2 Brown centre and internal brown spot

Necrotic lesions of BC are localized in the central area of the potato tuber, whereas internal
brown spot (IBS) is primarily found in the phloem-rich perimedullary region between the
pith and vascular ring (Hiller et al., 1985; Davies, 1998). The BC disorder can also be
a precursor to HH development as cells collapse and, in certain types, are layered with
suberin (Dean et al., 1977). Non-wound-induced suberization of parenchyma cells can
also develop in response to pathogen infection, e.g. that caused by Verticillium dahliae
(Lulai, 2005). van Denburgh et al. (1980) demonstrated that there was an optimal soil
(cid:2)
temperature (i.e. 10–15
C) for the expression of BC in cultivar Russet Burbank potatoes.
Tubers grown at temperatures below or above this range had decreased incidence of the

Internal physiological disorders, nutritional and compositional factors

505

BC disorder. IBS has been referred to as internal brown fleck, internal browning, internal
rust spot, internal necrosis and chocolate spot (Iritani et al., 1984; Hiller et al., 1985;
Olsen et al., 1996).

Calcium availability during the early tuber growth of cultivar Russet Burbank potatoes
was shown to be an influential factor in reducing the development of IBS (Olsen et al.,
1996). In-season application of calcium during tuber development and bulking has been
shown to reduce BC (Kleinhenz et al., 1999) and IBS (Ozgen et al., 2006). In a recent
study, an inverse relationship between calcium and IBS was found (Fig. 23.2, Ozgen et al.,
2006), suggesting a linkage between tuber calcium concentration and IBS. If calcium was
withheld during tuber initiation, symptoms of BC were observed (Davies, 1998), whereas
symptoms of IBS were evident if calcium was reduced from 20 mM to 1 mM after tubers
reached 5 cm in diameter (Davies and Monk-Talbot, 1990). Calcium deficiency in potato
tubers can lead to rapid metabolic changes leading to a loss of membrane integrity and a
series of uncontrolled oxidative reactions (Monk et al., 1989). These investigators used
electron spin resonance (ESR) to explore the formation of paramagnetic species during
the development of IBS in potato tubers. Disruption of cellular organization causes leaki-
ness of deleterious reactive species from mitochondria that may expose membrane lipids
to peroxidation. The resulting changes in membrane permeability and subcellular com-
partmentalization could expose membrane lipids to endogenous lipase and lipoxygenase
(LOX) action, resulting in the generation of free radicals (Davies, 1998). Using optical and
electron microscopy, Baruzzini et al. (1989) observed groups of IBS cells to be spongy,
suberized and absent of starch. Separation and degeneration of the plasmalemma and the
death of the cells were observed in tissues in the final stages of damage. Osmiophilic
granules attached to the tonoplast were suggested to be catabolic products of a disturbed
metabolism (Table 23.1).

Differences in antioxidant status of tubers could not unequivocally explain their differ-
ences in susceptibility to IBS (Davies, 1998). Superoxide dismutases (SOD: EC 1.15.1.1)
are a group of metallo-enzymes that catalyse the disproportionation of superoxide free

radicals to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. A negative correlation (cid:2)R > −0(cid:4)73(cid:3) between
the percentage of tubers affected by necrotic lesions and the maximum catalytic activity
of SOD was observed (Monk-Talbot et al., 1991). Isozyme analysis revealed extensive
polymorphism for SOD among cultivars. However, there was no indication that restricted
supplies of calcium induced or repressed the synthesis of specific isoforms. They con-
cluded that although SOD may contribute to resistance for IBS, it is not the primary
mechanism involved.

Resistance to IBS may be related to a plant’s ability to distribute and maintain calcium
in soluble form for physiological processes in fast tuber growing areas that have a
minimum of vascularized connections (Peterson et al., 1985). Certain environmental
conditions may cause a disruption in the calcium supply needed for a cell’s metabolic
requirements resulting in tissue necrosis. Collier and coworkers (1980) showed in tubers
of 10 potato cultivars that the incidence of IBS increased when the concentration of
calcium chloride supplied to the plants fell from 9 mM to 1 mM. They suggested that in
the field, factors that reduced the availability and uptake of calcium would enhance the
development of IBS. In any case, a cultivar’s susceptibility to IBS did not depend simply
on tuber calcium concentration as other cellular factors are apparently implicated.

Climatic/cultural factors that regulate calcium homeostasis within the growing tuber
cell could play an important role in BC and IBS (Davies, 1998). It has been reported
that over 90% of the calcium in potato tuber cells is in a physiologically active form
and very little is in the form of insoluble components, such as calcium oxalate (Davies
and Millard, 1985). Autoradiographs of potato tubers (cultivar Maris Piper) grown in the
presence of 45Ca2+
revealed high activity in the periderm, vascular ring (predominantly
xylem), phloem bundles and pith. They reported that 40% of tuber calcium entered
directly through the periderm and that the localization of calcium in the region of phloem
bundles in unsprouted tubers raised the possibility of import through the phloem. Their
data also indicated that 45Ca2+
is associated with both xylem and phloem when tubers and
only a small section of a stolon are directed into moist compost containing this isotope.
Calcium uptake through the roots present on the stolon could account for this result. Other
investigators have suggested that calcium moves predominately (if not exclusively) with
water through the xylem (Wiersum, 1966; Tibbits and Palzkill, 1979; Clarkson, 1984;
Palta, 1996). The discovery of functional roots present on the tuber at the tuber–stolon
junction and on the stolon associated with the tuber has helped to modify the view of
calcium nutrition of potato tubers (for more details, see Section 2.1). Therefore, very low
calcium content in the tuber may be due to a relatively small amount of water that is
transported to the tuber as compared with leaves (Palta, 1996). This would be particularly
critical during drought conditions.

23.2.3 Hollow heart

Hollow heart is characterized by the formation of an irregular cavity in the flesh (pith) of
the tuber, typically surrounded with brown, discoloured tissue that causes serious losses in
crop quality and economic return to the grower and processor following harvest. Numerous
factors have been implicated in the initiation and manifestation of HH as reviewed by
Hiller et al. (1985). Investigations into the causal factors of HH, however, are often

508

Sowokinos

conflicting or inconclusive. HH has frequently been reported to be most prevalent in large
tubers (Kallio, 1960; Nelson and Thoreson, 1986; Jansky and Thompson, 1990). It was
suggested that HH was due to tissue tension associated with tuber enlargement (Nelson
and Thoreson, 1986). Crumbly and coworkers (1973) observed that tuber growth rate was
related to HH occurring within a variety but could not account for differences among
varieties. They also reported that small tubers can experience the disorder under certain
growing conditions. These conditions were (1) moisture stress resulting in conversion of
starch to sugar followed by a rapid influx of water leading to a rapid enlargement and
separation of pith cells and (2) injury to some cells in the tuber due to reabsorption of
minerals and carbohydrates or depletion of food reserves followed by tuber enlargement.
Early initiation of HH appears shortly after tuber set and can follow from the same factors
that cause BC (Olsen et al., 2003). HH in larger tubers may primarily be associated with
excessive rapid tuber enlargement, without the involvement of reabsorption or depletion
of food reserves. Conditions favouring rapid vine growth (excess nitrogen) during rapid
tuber bulking lead to a physiological imbalance in the plant increasing the incidence of
HH (Kallio, 1960; Rex and Mazza, 1989). It was suggested that important nutrients may
be temporally insufficient resulting from cellular instability of pith cells that eventually
collapse and/or separate as growth conditions and moisture availability improve. Excess
moisture during field growth in August and September, which reduces specific gravity,
tends to increase the incidence of HH, and in some years IBS (Silva et al., 1991).
Growers in the Pacific Northwest of the USA limit HH development in russeted potatoes
by subjecting plants to slight water stress during the last part of the growing season.
Researchers in Idaho concluded that late season irrigation practices have a significant
impact on HH in varieties susceptible to late-season development. An experiment was
conducted comparing irrigation regimes in which full evapo-transpiration (ET) was either
met or irrigation was reduced to 75% of ET replacement on July 20 and further reduced to
50% replacement on August 10. For the cultivars Russet Norkotah and Gemstar Russet,
limiting late-season water supply in a step-down fashion reduced HH from 16 to 5% and
from 18 to 2%, respectively, while having minimal effect on yield (S.L. Love, personal
communication).

Although the incidence of HH is influenced strongly by the environment, there is also
an effect by genotype. High estimates of general combining ability in both male and
female parents for expression of HH have been reported (Veilleux and Lauer, 1981).
Jansky and Thompson (1990) conducted an experiment to study HH in segregating
populations from parents in a breeding programme. The highest levels of HH were found
in families with susceptible parents, but susceptible clones were obtained in families
with two resistant parents. Regardless of the type of cross, selection of clones with large
tubers increased the probability of selecting for susceptibility to HH. Ehlenfeldt (1992)
evaluated HH frequency and leaf transpiration rates in nine potato cultivars from an
irrigated and dry-land location. He reported that 88% of the total variation in HH was
explained as a quadratic function of transpiration. The positive correlation suggested that
varieties that have high levels of transpiration may be more likely to undergo severe
cycles of dehydration and hydration, which can result in rapid and severe expansion stress
in tubers. It was suggested that measurement of leaf transpiration rates might be used as

Internal physiological disorders, nutritional and compositional factors

a tool to select for advanced potato selections that have the genetic capability of resisting
HH development.

Early studies by Levitt (1942) showed reduced concentration of many nutrients, includ-
ing calcium in tubers with HH. Later, electron microprobe and neutron activation analysis
were used to evaluate the distribution of elements within potato tubers having the physi-
ological disorder HH (Arteca et al., 1980). Both methods of analysis correlated well for
all elements tested. In HH tubers, there were significantly higher calcium levels in the
stem end than in the bud end; however, a calcium gradient in the control was not evident.
In support of the role of calcium in HH, Kleinhenz et al. (1999) found a significant
reduction in this incidence with in-season application of soluble calcium fertiliser during
bulking. This reduction in HH was associated with an increase in non-periderm tissue
calcium concentration. A Cl
gradient from stem to bud end was present in both the
HH and control tubers. The low levels of calcium in HH tubers may be involved in the
weakening or destruction of cell walls and membranes, subsequently leading to the HH
disorder. These observations are consistent with the concept that tubers are generally low
in calcium and that the incidence of internal defects can be reduced by increasing its
concentration in the tuber (Palta, 1996; Kleinhenz et al., 1999).

−

In general, conflicting reports are widespread in the literature regarding the effects
that nutrients have on the occurrence of HH. These differences are likely because of
variation in cultivar selection, soil types, cultural practices and environmental conditions
(Nelson, 1970; Rex and Mazza, 1989; Lambert et al., 1996). Excess nitrogen has been
reported to increase HH, whereas higher applications of potassium reduce its occurrence
(Kallio, 1960; Nelson, 1970). Varying phosphorus applications showed no effect on HH
occurrence (Kallio, 1960). As there are many factors that act synergistically to cause
variation in the incidence of HH outside the scope of this chapter, the reader is referred to
a comprehensive review by Rex and Mazza (1989), who discuss the formation, methods
of control and means of detecting HH in potatoes.

23.2.4 Internal heat necrosis

There are several synonyms for IHN, including internal necrosis, IBS and others as listed
by Sterrett et al. (2003). Here, however, IHN will be described as a distinct internal
physiological disorder as it can vary in form, severity and time of injury from IBS.
Symptoms of IHN in the tuber include round to irregular, light tan to reddish-brown
spots or blotches that appear first towards the apical end of the tuber (Olsen et al., 2003;
Sterrett et al., 2003). This necrotic tissue occurs primarily in the parenchymal tissue
associated closely with the vascular ring. Hiller et al. (1985) indicated that location of
the necrotic areas across the tuber is used by some authors to distinguish IHN from IBS.
IBS lesions are generally more localized throughout the parenchymal tissue internal to
the vascular ring.

It is generally accepted that IHN tissue occurs at/or near the time of harvest in the
largest tubers (Sterrett and Henninger, 1997). Both the colour intensity and the tuber area
affected increase over time (Sterrett et al., 1991a). On the contrary, IBS has been reported
to occur at various times throughout the period of potato growth (Hiller et al., 1985).
The influence of environment and cultural management practices on the development of

510

Sowokinos

IHN has been discussed in detail by Sterrett and Henninger (1997) for the IHN-sensitive
cultivar Atlantic. The genetic and molecular factors involved in the development of
IHN, however, have been difficult to determine. Although cultivar selection is important,
the soil type and soil composition influence the effectiveness of nitrogen and calcium
treatments. Minimum and maximum temperatures exceeding the optimum for potato
growth, rainfall events and tuber size distribution have been used in modelling to predict
occurrence and development/severity of IHN in cultivar Atlantic in the mid-Atlantic states
(Sterrett et al., 1991b). The variables appearing in the regression models for incidence,
rating and distribution suggested that the development of IHN is not necessarily a simple
response to high temperature (Sterrett et al., 1991a). Sterrett et al. (1991b) developed a
predictive model for onset and development of IHN. This model was designed to allow
farmers to predict when their potato crop is estimated to go off-grade because of IHN
and thus suggest an earlier harvest to minimize the economic impact.

Studies of cultural and management practices to alleviate IHN have included delayed
planting, use of straw mulch to reduce soil temperature, decreased in-row spacing, appli-
cation of additional calcium and application of various substances to prolong vine growth
(Wannamaker and Collins, 1992; Sieczka and Thornton, 1993). Because IHN is associated
with heat stress and calcium, nutrition has been shown to mitigate heat stress in potatoes
(Tawfik et al., 1996; Kleinhenz and Palta, 2002), it may be interesting to investigate
whether the incidence of IHN can be reduced by targeted calcium nutrition. Regardless,
cultural and management practices have been limited in their success in reducing the
occurrence of IHN. This is, in large part, due to the general lack of understanding of the
biology responsible for IHN resistance. Wannamaker and Collins (1992) suggested that
the most economical practice for a potato grower would be to plant a cultivar resistant
to IHN. They cite a number of researchers who have demonstrated genetic variability
to IHN in S. tuberosum. In a 3-year study of 19 genotypes at two locations, Henninger
et al. (1994) found that broad-sense heritability (additive + dominance components) was
86% for incidence and 88% for severity of IHN with most of the remaining variation
in this population due to genotype × environment interaction. Henninger et al. (2000)
reported that the genetic potential exists for developing new cultivars that are high in
specific gravity and yield and free of IHN. In retrospect, it appears that the best avenue
for attaining resistant genotypes to IHN in the future may be through the development of
more efficient breeding strategies (Wannamaker and Collins, 1992).

23.2.5 Stem-end discolouration

A serious problem for French fry manufactures is an internal physiological disorder known
as sugar ends, also referred to as dark ends, jelly ends, TransL ends and/or glassy ends
(Olsen et al., 2003). The losses due to this disorder have never been quantified but can
be serious for growers because of crop rejection and trim loss and product downgrades
by processors. The most common occurring type of SED is located at the stem or basal
end of ‘russeted’ tubers and is characterized by reduced starch content along with a high
concentration of reducing sugar (RS) (Sowokinos et al., 2000) (Table 23.1). A more rare
form of the SED condition leads to the development of dumbbell-shaped tubers induced
by a mid-season moisture stress (Iritani and Weller, 1980).

Internal physiological disorders, nutritional and compositional factors

511

As with most internal potato physiological disorders, heat and drought stress at specific
growth stages are implicated in causing SED. Although temperature exacerbates the
physiological and biochemical changes characteristic of the SED condition, research has
suggested that a transient moisture deficiency during tuberization may be the primary
initiator (Shock et al., 1993; Eldredge et al., 1996). Timing of moisture stress appeared to
be critical to the incidence of SED development. Plants stressed before tuber initiation had
fewer tubers with dark stem-end fry colours and demonstrated an increased percentage of
US No. 1 potatoes (e.g. smooth, uniform-shaped tubers and independent of size) (Shock
et al., 1992). A single transitory soil water potential stress (i.e. –69 kPa to –80 kPa)
episode during early tuber bulking has been associated with an increased incidence of
SED at harvest (Eldredge et al., 1996). The incidence and severity of dark ends increased
with the duration and intensity of transitory soil water potential stress. The concentration
of RSs in the stressed tubers continued to increase after storage (cid:2)9
C(cid:3) for 6 weeks as did
the darkness of the fries. Owing to the latency of the tuber in developing a noticeable
decrease in solids and an increased concentration of RSs following a transient moisture
stress period, the successful use of these parameters to screen commercial potato fields
for SED potential is unavailable at the present time.

(cid:2)

Research has shown that heat and moisture-deficit stress lead to a plethora of changes
affecting whole plant metabolism and phenotypic characteristics including (1) changes
in photosynthetic and respiration rates (Owings et al., 1978; Dwelle, 1985; Lulai et al.,
1986; Wolf et al., 1990, 1991), (2) aberrations in source–sink relationships that affect
tuberization, tuber number, yield and tuber quality (Rufty and Huber, 1983; Sowokinos
et al., 1985; Levy, 1986) and (3) development of irregular-shaped tubers (see Shock et al.,
1993, and references therein). A study was conducted to determine how moisture deficit,
during early tuberization, affected tuber composition and activity of enzymes involved
with the synthesis and degradation of starch and sucrose (Sowokinos et al., 2000). It was
apparent that compositional and enzymatic changes associated with SED development
had, in time, shifted the tuber from a starch-storing tissue to one actively involved
in starch mobilization. A decrease in the activity of adenosine diphosphate ADP-Glc
pyrophosphorylase (−2.1-fold) compared with an increase in starch phosphorylase (+1.7-
fold) seemed to favour an environment for starch mobilization rather than starch synthesis.
This shift in carbohydrate metabolism was supported by the observation that total solids
and starch decreased in SED tissue (Table 23.1). The vacuolar enzyme, acid invertase,
demonstrated the largest change in activity (i.e. increase) in SED tissue. Although its
activity increased gradually, prior to harvest, it continued to increase (seven-fold) in
storage (Sowokinos et al., 2000). Kinetic analysis suggested that following SED induction,
apparent invertase activity increased and/or the level or effectiveness of the endogenous
invertase inhibitor decreased. There was no significant difference in the specific activity
of sucrose 6-P synthase (SPS) whereas that of UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) and
sucrose synthase (Susy) both decreased from that observed in normal, healthy tissue. Other
changes in tissue composition and enzyme activities in the SED tissue compared with
data available with other internal physiological disorders are summarized in Table 23.1.
A genetic component to the expression of sugar-ends under stressful environments
has been demonstrated. Following severe moisture stress, cultivar Lemhi Russet tubers
showed little to no sugar gradient from basal to stem end of tubers, whereas Russet

512

Sowokinos

Burbank developed a high incidence of SED (Love et al., 1991). The numbered selec-
tion A082260-8 was relatively SED free compared with Russet Burbank following a
severe moisture-deficit condition (Shock et al., 1993). Although several wild species have
demonstrated the ability to tolerate heat and drought stress (Reynolds and Ewing, 1989),
the biological parameters responsible for this increased resistance were not investigated.
SED resistance is likely inherited in a polygenic, additive manner, and through the selec-
tion of appropriate parents, breeding progress for SED resistance should be fairly rapid
(Thompson-Johns, 1998).

23.2.6 Translucency

In principally non-irrigated growing areas, a ‘translucent disorder’ has periodically been
observed that seems to be primarily induced by extreme growing temperatures. Although
SED translucency occurs in oblong, russeted potatoes, this translucency defect occurs in
more spherically shaped potatoes of a non-russeted skin type. These TransL areas occur
at random, internal to the vascular ring. When a thin tuber slice is held to a light source,
a definite TransL area devoid of starch can be seen. Upon frying, this area becomes dark
brown to black in colour indicating a high concentration of RSs (Sowokinos et al., 1985).
In this respect, this TransL disorder is similar to SED tissue described above, but differs
from BC, IBS or IHN, where discolouration is evident prior to frying.

Starch phosphorylase in TransL tissue experienced a marked 5.4-fold increase in
specific activity, and this was reflected by a significant drop in total solids and starch.
Although some compositional and enzymatic changes in TransL are common to SED
tissues, obvious differences are apparent (Table 23.1). In the TransL tissue, total acid
invertase activity did not experience the significant change as observed in SED tissue,
and UGPase showed a positive 1.6-fold increase in activity. This may explain, in part, the
major difference observed in the sucrose/glucose ratio between TransL and SED tissue
of 2.1 and 0.2, respectively (Sowokinos et al., 1985, 2000) (Table 23.1). The respective
increase in both UGPase (+1(cid:4)6-fold) and SPS (+3(cid:4)8-fold) (coupled with only a slight
increase in invertase activity) may account for the large positive change in sucrose content
(+seven-fold) observed in the TransL tissue (Table 23.1).

Lipid content of potato is only 0.1% on a fresh weight basis and is primarily membrane
in nature (Galliard, 1973). Potato tubers contain sufficient lipolytic acyl hydrolase (LAH)
and LOX to rapidly hydrolyse all membrane lipids (phospholipids and galactolipid) and to
rapidly peroxidize the endogenous liberated linoleic and linolenic acids (Galliard, 1970).
Normally, LAH and LOX are necessarily sequestered, probably in the tuber vacuole
(Galliard, 1978) or LAH may exist in an inactive form in vivo (Walcotot et al., 1982).
Changes in lipid-metabolizing enzymes along with changes in mitochondria and starch
granule morphology were examined in relation to the loss of tuber quality associated with
the TransL disorder (Lulai et al., 1986). It was shown that a reduction in LAH (−3(cid:4)7-
fold) and LOX (−1(cid:4)4-fold) activities occurred in TransL tissue suggesting a possible
alteration in lipid metabolism compared with that in healthy tubers. The effects of these
reduced activities are uncertain, but they may have influenced composition, turnover
and/or permeability of cellular membranes. Electron micrographs of the TransL tissue
revealed a discernible decrease in the number of starch granules (amyloplasts) compared

Internal physiological disorders, nutritional and compositional factors

with healthy tissue. The few remaining amyloplasts possessed a large electron-dense
stroma area that surrounded the remainder of the starch granule (Lulai et al., 1986)
(Fig. 23.3). Mitochondria from TransL tissue were aggregated in large numbers, were
irregular is size and shape and had fewer cristae than mitochondria found in healthy tuber
tissue (Fig. 23.4). The defective mitochondria resembled those present in aged tissue
slices of beetroot and rutabaga as described by van Steveninck and Jackman (1967).
It appeared that TransL tissue was experiencing an exaggerated or accelerated form of
senescence/ageing.

23.2.7 Mottling

Since 1990, a less severe colour defect has been recognized in the French fried potato
industry that has been termed ‘mottling’. This disorder is expressed as a non-uniform
surface browning (i.e. streaking) of French fries. Mottling appears following storage
(i.e. 2–4 months). The incidence and severity of mottling is sporadic from year to year
but leads to losses of several hundred thousand dollars annually for major processing
plants. Increased temperature with time intensifies the disorder, and the streaking is not
evident until the product is finished-fried at the foodservice establishment. The only study
addressing the nature of this internal physiological disorder was conducted by Jankowski
et al. (1997). Mottling appeared to lead to the heterogeneous distribution of RSs along the
potato tissue strips, giving rise to enhanced Maillard browning in localized areas during
finished-frying (Fig. 23.5). Fresh and processed tissue areas that are prone to mottling
have significantly (P < 0(cid:4)01 to P < 0(cid:4)05) greater levels of glucose and fructose than
do areas lighter in colour. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed no apparent

differences in microstructure of potato tuber tissue sections prone to mottling as compared
with that described above for TransL (Sowokinos et al., 1985; Lulai et al., 1986) and SED
tissues (Sowokinos et al., 2000) (Table 23.1). This disorder was similar to TransL, in that
they both appeared to involve localized differences in RS concentration that increased
in storage. In addition to a lack of microstructure changes, mottling did not lead to any
significant decrease and increase in total solids and inorganic phosphate, respectively
(Table 23.1). At this point in time, the cause of mottling cannot be speculated on. It
appears to be a unique disorder when both tissue appearance and constituent changes
are compared. Jankowski et al. (1997) suggested that staining of raw potato strips with

Internal physiological disorders, nutritional and compositional factors

515

a solution of glucose oxidase/peroxidase enzymes might be used as a predictor of the
incidence of mottling.

23.3 SUMMARY OF INTERNAL PHYSIOLOGICAL DISORDERS

Collectively, internal physiological disorders may be initiated by abiotic stresses that
affect singly or in combination: (1) hormonal levels, (2) membrane composition, structure
and function, (3) gene induction or repression, (4) endogenous enzyme activity and (5) the
compartmentalization and/or concentration of key metabolites, ions/minerals, enzymes
or other effectors (i.e. antioxidants) (Lulai et al., 1986; Sowokinos, 1990; Davies, 1998;
Sowokinos et al., 2000). Although cultural and environmental factors giving rise to such
disorders have been studied extensively, little information is available on the underpinning
physiological, molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved (Davies, 1998). Of those
internal physiological disorders where a few biological changes have been examined
(i.e. TransL, SED, Mottling and IBS), distinct differences are noted in their expression
(Table 23.1). Less biological information is known about BC, HH and IHN related to their
‘causal factors’ or in relation to their ‘putative’ metabolic response profiles. Considering
internal physiological disorders in their entirety, it is expected that several ‘biological
alterations’ that lead to necrosis and eventual death of the tissue are ‘shared’ among these
disorders. Future research is needed to better understand internal physiological disorders
on a molecular basis. Until then, it is apparent that developing resistant lines of potatoes
may be the best initial step to minimize the impact that internal physiological disorders
have on post-harvest potato quality. Such resistant germplasm could be an important
source for the identification of the key genes involved. Meanwhile, the potential for
developing most internal physiological disorders may be decreased by (1) managing
the choice of cultivar, (2) establishing uniform plant spacing and planting depth to
encourage uniform emergence, (3) managing the rate and timing of fertiliser application,
(4) controlling soil moisture and temperature and (5) conducting other cultural practices
in an effort to promote steady, uniform growth rates. For details of the symptoms, cultural
variation, distribution and control of internal physiological disorders in potatoes beyond
the scope of this chapter, see reviews presented by Hiller et al. (1985), Rex and Mazza
(1989), McGarry et al. (1996) and Olsen et al. (2003).

23.4 COMPOSITIONAL AND NUTRITIONAL CHANGES AFFECTING

END-USE QUALITY

The potato is one of most nutritious crops that man currently grows. In addition to supply-
ing abundant starch reserves as an energy source, the potato is an important contributor
of fibre, nitrogen and high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals, which support human
growth and health (Storey and Davies, 1992). A medium potato (cid:2)150 g/5(cid:4)3 oz(cid:3) with the
skin contains a mere 100 calories and provides 45% of the daily value (DV) for vitamin C,
has more potassium than bananas (720 mg or 21% of DV) and contains trace amounts of
calcium, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, folate, magnesium, phosphorus and iron

516

Sowokinos

(0(cid:4)12–24 mg/150 g potato) (Beals, 2004). Lesser amounts of copper, cadmium, lead and
selenium (0(cid:4)02–0(cid:4)07 mg/150 g potato) are also present (Dugo et al., 2004). Moreover,
the fibre content of a potato with skin (3 g) equals or exceeds that of many whole grain
breads, pastas and cereals (Beals, 2004).

The potato is an important component of healthy diet plans created by many heart and
dietetic associations. The cooking method used, however, can significantly impact the
nutrient availability of the potato. Significant losses of water-soluble vitamins (particularly
Vitamin C), amino acids, potassium and calcium can occur. A substantial loss of vitamin C
occurs when potatoes are fried in oil (55–79%), which is second only to losses experienced
when potatoes are boiled in water (77–88%) (Han et al., 2004). Potatoes cooked in a
microwave retain more of the vitamin C content compared with baking or boiling (Beals,
2004). In general, baking a potato with the skin is the best overall cooking method to
retain the nutrition of the potato (Beals, 2004).

The remainder of this chapter will be concerned with factors that influence changes
in post-harvest carbohydrate balance (i.e. starch–sugar) as they affect the final colour
quality of crisps and French fries. A commercial method to manage the sugar levels in
potatoes before harvest through delivery to the processor is also described.

23.4.1 Carbohydrates – starch

Starch comprises approximately 80% of the total solids found in potato tubers. Specific
gravity is an indirect measure of the potato solids content (Stark and Love, 2003). High
specific gravity (HSG) potatoes are important to the processing industry as they yield
more product per unit of raw material and the product obtained is more rigid, crisp and
less oily (Lulai and Orr, 1979; Storey and Davies 1992). It has been reported that HSG
potatoes lose less amino acids during processing than low SG potatoes (Jaswal, 1973). One
disadvantage of HSG potatoes is that they are more susceptible to bruising during harvest
handling and transport (Gray and Hughes, 1978; Killick and Macarthur 1980). Although
starch is the major component of a potato and the source of free RSs that interfere with
the final colour of fried potato products, variation in its post-harvest concentration is not
an efficient predictor of the final colour quality (O’Donoghue et al., 1996).

23.4.2 Carbohydrates – sugars

The 12-carbon, non-RS ‘sucrose’ is the major form of carbon translocated to the tuber
from the leaves and therefore becomes the predominant sugar found in potatoes during
growth and development (Burton, 1965; Sowokinos, 1978, 1990; Mares et al., 1985;
ap Rees and Morrell, 1990). The presence of a specific inhibitor of the enzyme ‘acid
invertase’ prevents sucrose from being hydrolysed into its two 6-carbon RS components,
glucose and fructose, during tuber growth (Pressey, 1969). As a result, the high energy
of the glucosidic bond of sucrose (6.6 kcal/mole) is conserved as ‘chemical energy’ to
drive all biosynthetic reactions that occur in the developing potato rather than being
dissipated as useless heat energy (Mares et al., 1985). As the foliage dies (either induced
or naturally), or as tubers are harvested, acid invertase commences to convert any excess
sucrose to the RS. Frying of potatoes with excess RS produces a brown to black colour

Internal physiological disorders, nutritional and compositional factors

517

pigmented product due to the Maillard reaction with free amino acids in the potato
cell (Shallenberger et al., 1959). These dark-coloured products are unacceptable to the
consumer because of their appearance and bitter taste (Roe et al., 1990). Substantial
economic loss occurs for both potato growers and processors when RS accumulates in
a potato resulting in the manufacture of unacceptably dark-coloured products. Although
several factors contribute to a slight variation in crisp or French fry colour (Habib and
Brown, 1956, 1957; Ashoor and Zent, 1984; Leszkowiat et al., 1990; Khanbari and
Thompson, 1993; Rodriguez-Saona and Wrolstad, 1997; Rodriguez-Saona et al., 1997),
variation in the content of RS is the most critical determinant of the colour quality of
fried potato products (Fuller and Hughes, 1984; Roe et al., 1990; Mann et al., 1991;
Roe and Faulks 1991; Pritchard and Adam, 1994; Putz and Lindhauer, 1994). Blenkinsop
and coworkers (2002) studied changes in sucrose, RS, nitrogen, protein, vitamin C and
dry matter content in relation to processing colour from low-temperature storage. Using
Pearson correlation analysis of the data, they found that crisp colour was most closely
correlated with RS concentration. Although fructose and glucose are equally formed as
the result of sucrose hydrolysis, glucose is the main sugar measured as an indicator of
crisp colour (Brown et al., 1990). Light crisp colour has been found to be directly related
to tuber glucose content regardless of the detection method, cultivar, growing site or
storage temperature (Coleman et al., 1993).

23.4.3 Factors affecting RS concentration in stored potatoes

It is commonly known by crisp processors that the more chemically and physically mature
potatoes are when harvested, the easier they are to handle, store and condition to a light-
coloured product. Immature tubers not only lose more weight and shrivel in storage, but
their chemical composition is different (Yamaguchi et al., 1966). The concentration of RS
is genetically determined (Lauer and Shaw, 1970; Coffin et al., 1987; Ehlenfeldt et al.,
1990; Loiselle et al., 1990; Jakuczun et al., 1995), and selection for low RS germplasm
is possible through breeding evaluation. The final content of sugars in a potato, however,
is influenced by planting date, growing location, biotic and abiotic stresses experienced
during development, fertility, vine-kill and harvesting conditions, handling and storage
practices, e.g. see reviews by Smith (1967, 1977), Burton (1989) and Sowokinos (2001b).
It is important for potatoes to be ‘physically mature’ before harvest (i.e. adequate
yield, high solids and firm skin-set), but attainment of ‘chemical maturity’ is a necessary
feature of a successful processing potato. Chemical maturity is reached when a potato crop
reaches its minimum free-sugar (sucrose) content (Burton, 1965). Following vine death or
harvest, excess sucrose is efficiently converted to RS through the activity of the enzyme,
acid invertase (Pressey, 1969). The more chemically immature a potato is at harvest
(i.e. higher the sucrose concentration), the greater is the potential for RS accumulation
in storage for crisps (Sowokinos, 1978) and French fry potatoes (Pritchard and Adam,
1992, 1994). Santerre et al. (1986) indicated that changes in sucrose levels of more
recently developed cultivars, as tubers matured, were helpful in evaluating their chemical
maturity compared with those already established. A reciprocal relationship has been
shown between a cultivar’s harvest sucrose content and its ability to produce acceptably
coloured crisps from 8(cid:4)9
C storage (Sowokinos, 1978). This relationship was determined,

(cid:2)

518

Sowokinos

however, with cultivars previously screened for a similar range of invertase activity,
e.g. low to moderate. Variability in sucrose content of ‘immature tubers’ explained greater
than 70% of the variation in crisp colour observed among cultivars following 9
C for 4–6
months (Nelson and Sowokinos, 1983). Sucrose values, obtained following harvest, have
not been a reliable indicator of fry colour with potatoes grown in the UK (Briddon and
Storey, 1996) or Ireland (Burke et al., 2005). Variation in invertase activity, however,
is known to be an over-riding factor in determining the hexose: sucrose ratio in stored
potatoes (Zrenner et al., 1996; McKenzie et al., 2005). Sucrose concentration was shown
to be a better predictor of crisping quality following moderate to long-term storage when
measured during early tuber development, when the differences in sucrose concentration
among cultivars was the greatest (Nelson and Sowokinos, 1983).

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

It is well known that the RS content of the tuber is affected by storage temperature
and by time in storage (Isherwood, 1973, 1976; Dwelle and Stallknecht, 1978). Although
there are several advantages for storing potatoes at colder temperatures (e.g. 3–5
C), a
process known as cold-induced sweetening (CIS) occurs (ap Rees et al., 1981; Storey and
Davies, 1992; Sowokinos, 2001b), which renders processed potato products unacceptably
dark. The normal compromise is to store processing potatoes for the short term at 10
C,
or warmer, where CIS is avoided. Holding potatoes at warmer temperature, however,
decreases the time to rapid sprout growth and irreversible senescent sweetening (Burton
and Wilson, 1978). Although biochemical mechanisms have been suggested to explain
why different potato genotypes accumulate RS at differential rates in storage, the molec-
ular events leading to the initiation and subsequent regulation of CIS process in potato
tubers needs further investigation (Sowokinos, 2001b). A potato’s ability to sweeten in
storage varies markedly among genotypes. The advanced selection ND3828-15 differed
100-fold in its sweetening potential following 7 months storage at 5
C compared with
cultivar Picasso [i.e. 0(cid:4)4 (cid:7)mol/g fresh weight (FW) and 47(cid:4)1 (cid:7)mol/g FW, respectively]
(Sowokinos, 2001b). It is therefore critical to evaluate a new potato cultivar for CIS
potential before being selected for storage and crisp processing.

(cid:2)

23.4.4 Chemical maturity monitoring

A commercial system has been developed, which has permitted the monitoring of the
free-sugar content (i.e. sucrose and glucose) of processing potatoes. The theory, technique
and application of chemical maturity monitoring (CMM) were initially described by
Sowokinos and Preston (1988). This system has proved valuable in assisting the potato
industry in predicting and maintaining processing quality of potatoes from harvest and
throughout the storage period. CMM involves the measurement of the sucrose rating
(SR = mg sucrose/g tuber FW) and glucose (mg/g tuber FW) content of potatoes using
the Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI), Model 2700 Select, Industrial Sugar Analyzer
(Sowokinos, 2001a). CMM has also been utilized to maintain the long-term storage
quality of potatoes used for the production of French fries (Pritchard and Adam, 1994).
The proper chemical maturity necessary to be reached before harvest has an upper limit
for sucrose of l.0 mg/g (0.1% FW) or less for both crisps and French fries (Santerre et al.,
1986; Sowokinos and Preston, 1988). The upper limits for glucose are 0.35 mg/g (0.035%
FW) and 1.0 mg/g (0.1% FW), or less, for crisp and French fry production, respectively

(Sowokinos and Preston, 1988; Coleman et al., 1993). Higher glucose values are generally
tolerated with French fry potatoes due, in part, to a blanching process that takes place
before cooking. Experience has shown that superior processing cultivars have the genetic
ability to reach and maintain glucose concentrations in storage markedly lower than the
‘upper limits’ described above, e.g. in the range of 0.01–0.1 mg/g (0.001–0.1% FW). For
a reliable prediction of processing performance from storage, the concentration of both
sucrose (i.e. source for new RS following harvest or vine death) and the RS currently
available must be considered.

If ‘chemically mature’ potatoes are placed into storage and stressed (principally influ-
enced by temperature and ventilation parameters), RS can accumulate from the vast starch
reserves resulting in the production of unacceptable, dark-coloured products. Addition-
ally, if ‘chemically immature/high sugar’ potatoes are placed into storage and suberized
C, or below, they will maintain their sugar level and process with
at temperatures of 10
a dark colour long into the storage season. To minimize this colour problem, potatoes are
usually subjected to ‘pre-conditioning temperatures’ early in storage ranging from 13 to

C. At these temperatures, RS levels usually drop to acceptable levels within a 2- to

long-term holding (Sowokinos and Preston, 1988). Prolonged exposure to high tempera-
ture will decrease the storage life of the potato by increasing potential for disease loss and
by decreasing the time to ‘irreversible’ senescent sweetening. Sprouting can be delayed
by applying a natural or synthetic sprout inhibitor, but an unnecessarily prolonged period
at a high temperature can diminish their effectiveness. Outside air must be intermittently
circulated through the pile (to replenish oxygen supply) each day to allow for this sugar-
removal process to occur successfully. At pre-conditioning temperatures, RS levels drop
as carbons are recycled back into starch, whereas others are directed into respiratory path-
ways (Isherwood, 1976; Smith, 1977). The temperature used for pre-conditioning must be
compromised (i.e. decreased slightly) if soft-rot or other infectious organisms are detected.

Intermediate storage temperatures can be maintained (cid:2)10–12
stored short term before processing (1–3 months). Long-term holding of potatoes (4–10
C. The actual temperature
months) requires temperatures ranging between 5.5 and 8(cid:4)9
tolerated depends on the CIS potential of the cultivar used (Sowokinos and Glynn, 2001).
During a period of extended storage, the concentration of sucrose in potatoes can
serve as an ‘indicator’ of their holding potential (Sowokinos and Preston, 1988). In a
stress-free storage environment, the sucrose content should remain well below the upper
limit of 1.0 mg/g FW. Potatoes maintaining a continuous low level of sucrose display
the potential for long-term holding. This is due to the fact that starch must first be
converted into sucrose before RS can accumulate. Experience has shown that sucrose
levels need to increase to a concentration of near 1.5 mg/g FW in storage before RS
accumulates, leading to a significant degree of visual browning of crisps or French fries.
If sucrose is monitored often enough (bimonthly or weekly), this may allow time for the
storer/processor to move potatoes in a more timely manner. During the storage period,
outside air must be intermittently circulated through the pile to allow respiratory processes
to continue. If sugars increase because of a decrease in oxygen content or an increase
in carbon dioxide, relieving these stresses will aid the reversal of this condition and will
allow colour quality to return. Success for regaining colour quality is limited, in part,

(cid:2)

by the duration and severity of the stress, the physiological age of the potato and the
cultivar used. If tuber sucrose begins to approach and surpass 1.0 mg/g FW while the
bin environment is relatively stress free, this could be an indication that the potatoes are
approaching senescence and should be processed as quickly as possible.

By minimizing the harvest of chemically immature or stressed potatoes and with a
careful assessment of their sugar concentration in storage, the quality of fried products
can be controlled with a minimum loss of raw material (Sowokinos and Preston, 1988).
CMM has not eliminated all the colour problems that the industry faces in maintaining
the post-harvest quality of processing potatoes, but it has helped the industry fine-tune
its efforts to minimize the detrimental effects that RS levels have on final colour quality.

Potato Flavour and Texture

Quality, Health and Nutrition, Scottish Crop Research Institute, Invergowrie, Dundee DD2 5DA, UK

24.1 INTRODUCTION

Increasingly tuber quality traits are assuming a greater
importance in breeding
programmes, as consumers demand greater variety and retailers wish to market cultivars
that have distinctive commercial advantages. However, as with many food crops, potato
flavour and texture are difficult to assess in breeding programmes. Assessments are highly
subjective and require trained sensory panels. These have a low sample throughput and
are consequently expensive. As a result, flavour and texture are generally only assessed
in the later stages of a breeding programme after selection for more easily quantifiable
traits. In fact, most of the potential flavour and texture improvements are likely to be
discarded, and to a large extent, the market place determines whether a new cultivar is
acceptable to consumers (Wang and Kays, 2003).

Means of analytically determining flavour and texture that can be efficiently applied to
germplasm are obvious requirements for improvement of the potato crop. In this chapter,
we shall review progress that has been made in understanding these complex traits and
opportunities that are arising, particularly from the Omic technologies that are now being
applied to potato.

24.2 POTATO FLAVOUR

24.2.1 Non-volatile components

Flavour is a complex trait and depends on the interaction of volatile compounds and
soluble cellular constituents. The soluble compounds define the basic taste parameters,
sweet, sour, salty or bitter. In the early twentieth century, a glutamate-like taste was
proposed as a fifth basic taste quality (Ikeda, 1912). There is a growing recognition of
this taste as umami (from the Japanese word meaning delicious). Compounds including
monosodium glutamate, several process-derived glutamate glycoconjugates, adenosine-
(cid:2)
-monophosphate (GMP)
5
are well known to show umami-like sensory characteristics (Bellisle, 1998). Umami
compounds generally enhance flavour and mouthfeel, giving the impression of creaminess
and viscosity to savoury dishes (Halpern, 2000).

As early as 1971, it was suggested that the flavour of boiled potato was largely due to
the natural mixture of glutamic acid and other amino acids in combination with GMP and
other 5
-ribonucleotides produced on cooking (Solms, 1971). Thus chemicals that impart
an umami flavour are likely to be an important component of potato flavour. Indeed, some
authors claim that there is only a small contribution from volatile (olfactory) components
and that chemicals representing the so-called sweet, sour, salty and bitter tastes do not
make a major contribution to potato flavour (Solms, 1971; Solms and Wyler, 1979). Thus,
the presence of salt, sugars or alkaloids does not enhance potato flavour although their
presence at high levels may decrease palatability. With the discovery of umami-tasting
glutamate glycoconjugates, produced by a Maillard reaction (Beksan et al., 2003), the
potential indirect effects of sugars on potato flavour should not be overlooked.

Data on the levels of several umami compounds in potato tubers have been published
(Solms and Wyler, 1979). Although raw potatoes contain only very small amounts of

GMP, cooked potatoes contain appreciable levels, higher than
most other plant foods examined. Thus, these nucleotides accumulate because of the
action of nucleases during cooking processes, particularly due to RNA degradation.
Ribonucleases are active under the pH and temperature conditions that occur during
heating, being particularly active at around 50
C. As the temperature of potato tissues
increases slowly from 40 to 60
C during some cooking processes (e.g. boiling), nuclease
activity may be significant (Solms and Wyler, 1979).

Several studies have addressed the levels of free amino acids (including glutamic
acid) in potato tubers and also examined changes in amino acid levels during storage
(Brierley et al., 1996, 1997). It is clear that the soluble protein and amino acid contents
of potato tubers are modified substantially during storage, with larger effects observed
after 3 months of storage at 10
C (Brierley et al., 1997). At harvest, the major
free amino acids are asparagine, glutamine, glutamic acid, arginine and aspartic acid,
with some cultivar-dependent variations in the contribution of these amino acids (Brierley
et al., 1997; Davids et al., 2004). Additionally, the soil nitrogen fertilization regime
impacts on amino acid content, a high level of nitrogen fertilization being associated
with increased glutamine content (Burton, 1989). After storage, the profile of free amino
acids that can be extracted in potato juices changes significantly depending on the storage
temperature. For example, in one study, the combined levels of glutamine and asparagine
contributed 34% of the amino acid pool at harvest but up to 90% after 25 weeks of storage
at 10
C (Brierley et al., 1997). In fact, it has been suggested recently that flavourings
may be extracted from potato juice and that the amino acid content and hence the flavour
characteristics of the juice may be manipulated by controlling the storage temperature of
the potato tubers prior to extraction (Davids et al., 2004). Treatment of the extracted juice
with glutaminase may increase the glutamic acid content and, consequently, the umami
character of the extract.

(cid:3)

Only limited taste panel data are available to support the importance of umami com-
pounds in defining potato flavour. However, the effects of supplementing boiled potato
with glutamic acid and glutamic acid and nucleotides both resulted in a ‘stronger’ potato
taste as assessed by a trained panel of 18 individuals. Additionally, an aqueous mixture
of amino acids and nucleotides that reproduces the levels found in boiled potatoes ‘had
practically no odor, but an agreeable basic potato-like taste’ (Solms, 1971). Furthermore,

a mixture with components replicating the amino acid and nucleotide concentrations of
a preferred boiled potato was judged to taste better than that replicating a less preferred
boiled potato (Buri and Solms, 1971).

Although potato starch probably has no taste of its own, the interaction of volatile and
non-volatile components with starch may influence flavour. In a recent study, it has been
suggested that starch-thickened products have a preferable taste to those prepared with
other thickeners because of an ‘in-mouth’ viscosity decrease caused by amylase action
(Ferry et al., 2004). The decrease in viscosity per se may enhance flavour perception
or, alternatively, volatile components complexed with starch may be released during this
process providing additional stimulation of the olfactory receptors. Interestingly, starch
can form inclusion complexes with decanal, a volatile derived from fatty acids that is
produced during cooking (Solms and Wyler, 1979).

24.2.2 Glycoalkaloids and flavour

the major

forms being
Potato tubers are well known to contain glycoalkaloids,
(cid:2)-chaconine and (cid:2)-solanine, which represent approximately 95% of the total (Slanina,
1990). The level of tuber glycoalkaloids varies according to cultivar (Ramsay et al.,
2004) and is also influenced by growth and storage conditions (Sengul et al., 2004).
Tuber glycoalkaloids are toxic to humans if present at levels in excess of 20 mg/100 g
(Osman, 1983). Additionally, high levels of glycoalkaloids are responsible for off-flavours
in potato tubers (Zitnak, 1961; Sinden et al., 1976; Ross et al., 1978). The emerging
consensus is that potato glycoalkaloids at elevated levels are responsible for flavours
described as bitter, burning, scratchy or acrid and are thus generally undesirable com-
ponents of flavour. In one study, taste panels correlated glycoalkaloid content in excess
of 10 mg/100 g fresh weight with a burning taste. However, at levels between 0.76 and
4.98 mg/100 g, no correlation was found (Ross et al., 1978). Other taste panel studies
described how tubers with glycoalkaloid contents greater than 14 mg/100 g had a bitter
taste (Sinden et al., 1976).

24.2.3 Volatile compounds

Recent studies on potato flavour have focused almost exclusively on the volatile com-
ponents released from raw and cooked potato tubers, despite earlier claims that potato
flavour was largely due to soluble matrix-associated components and the lack of convinc-
ing sensory panel data in support of the volatile components being of primary importance
to flavour. The volatiles produced by raw and cooked potatoes have been studied exten-
sively (reviewed by Maga, 1994), and over 250 compounds have been identified in potato
volatile fractions. Since then, attempts have been made to discriminate which of these
components are important for potato flavour, which are specific to the method of cooking,
cultivar differences, the effects of agronomic conditions and effects of storage (Duckham
et al., 2001, 2002; Oruna-Concha et al., 2001, 2002a,b; Dobson et al., 2004).

Although potato tubers are only consumed after cooking, there is an advantage to
determining analytically the volatiles arising from the raw product. The determina-
tion of a favourable analytical profile in raw potatoes would enable a rapid evaluation

528

Taylor et al.

of a given product free from artefacts arising from differences in cooking profiles.
Raw potato volatiles are derived from biosynthetic processes in the tuber or associated
microorganisms rather than thermally catalyzed reactions and include compounds such as
methoxypyrazines (Buttery and Ling, 1973). The presence of relatively high amounts of
methoxypyrazines in peeled tubers may argue against this compound being synthesized
by soil microflora associated with the tuber and indicate that a biosynthetic route for their
production is present in the potato tuber. The most prevalent methoxypyrazine present in
raw potato volatiles was 2-methoxy-3-isopropylpyrazine (Murray and Whitfield, 1975).
Sesquiterpenes are also present in raw potato volatiles, and in general, their levels are
much higher following tuber damage or microbial attack (Desjardins et al., 1995).

Lipid oxidation products contribute to the spectrum of volatiles from raw potato – on
slicing or shredding potato tubers, there is a large increase in classical lipid oxidation
products such as hexanal, octenal and isomeric forms of 2,4-decadienal (Josephson and
Lindsay, 1987).

The volatile profile obtained from cooked potatoes contains many process-derived
compounds that undoubtedly contribute to the overall potato flavour (Maarse, 1991).
Important thermally driven reactions include the Maillard reaction between reducing sug-
ars and amino acids, the Strecker degradation of methionine to produce methional and
the thermal and enzymatic degradation of fatty acids (Fig. 24.1). The Maillard reaction
takes place when compounds possessing a carbonyl group, typically reducing sugars,
react with components with a free amino group such as amino acids. The Strecker
degradation of methionine involves the interaction of (cid:2)-dicarbonyl compounds, interme-
diates in the Maillard reaction, with methionine, resulting in the formation of methional
(Lindsay, 1996). Autooxidation (Frankel, 1998) and enzymic (hydroperoxide lyase) action
on hydroperoxides derived from linoleic and (cid:2)-linolenic acids (Gardner, 1995) produce
a range of flavour-active volatile aldehydes, ketones, alcohols and alkyl furans. The
other major classes of cooked potato volatiles include methoxypyrazines and terpenes. In

addition, several specific compounds have been directly related to desirable flavour and
aroma characteristics with methional (Lindsay, 1996), methoxypyrazines (Murray and
Whitfield, 1975) and the lipid degradation product, cis-4-heptenal (Josephson and Lind-
say, 1987), all reported to exhibit ‘a cooked potato odour’. This provides some evidence
that these compounds may be significant contributors to potato flavour. To generalize the
findings of several studies, in boiled potatoes, the most important volatile constituents are
likely to be those derived from lipid degradation, the Maillard reaction and the Strecker
reaction and include methional, aliphatic alcohols and aldehydes, thiols and sulphides and
methoxypyrazines.

As the volatiles derived from potato tubers are greatly altered on cooking, it is important
to assess the changes in profiles associated with different cooking methods. Distinctive
quantitative and qualitative differences in volatile profile were observed in a comparison
of tubers (cultivars Estima and Maris Piper) cooked by boiling, baking or microwaving
(Oruna-Concha et al., 2002b). Although for all three methods of cooking the main sources
of flavour compounds were from lipid degradation and the Maillard reaction and/or sugar
degradation, there was a characteristically different ratio of the contribution of each class
to the total volatile fraction. For boiled potatoes, volatiles formed by lipid degradation
were judged to be the most important, whereas for baked potatoes, those arising from
amino acids contributed more significantly (Oruna-Concha et al., 2002b). A much lower
amount of volatile aroma compounds was produced from microwave-cooked potatoes
than for the other cooking methods, possibly indicating that microwave-cooked potato
products are blander in flavour than potato products produced by boiling or conventional
baking. The cooking-dependent differences in volatile profiles have been attributed to
variations in heat and mass transfer processes associated with the different cooking
methods (Wilson et al., 2002a,b). For example, during conventional baking, initially the
surface temperature of the tuber increases to 100
C with significant water evaporation
(Wilson et al., 2002a). As baking progresses, the surface temperature increases above
100
C isotherm moves towards
the centre of the tuber. Water loss during baking is typically 20% but with most of the
moisture loss (approximately 57%) from the outer 3 mm of the tuber. Boiling tubers
resulted in negligible water loss and a more rapid migration of the 100
C isotherm to the
centre of the tuber than conventional baking (Oruna-Concha et al., 2002b). Microwave
cooking proceeds by a different heating mechanism (Fryer, 1997); all parts of the tuber
reach 100
C within a few minutes except for the outer surface that remains cooler
because of evaporative cooling. Starch gelatinization is complete throughout the tuber after
2–2.5 min of cooking. Although water loss is similar during conventional and microwave
baking, the loss was more uniform with microwave cooking and an outer crust was not
formed. During microwave cooking, water boils explosively in the intercellular spaces
rupturing the surrounding tissue. It has been hypothesized that the greater proportion
of lipid degradation products measured in boiled potato volatiles may be because of
more significant lipoxygenase activity during this mode of cooking (Oruna-Concha et al.,
2002b). As tuber slices were boiled, the lipoxygenases may have been able to come into
contact with their substrates more readily. Additionally, as the tubers were placed in cold
water and heated to boiling, lipoxygenase activity may have persisted longer on boiling
than on baking. For baked potatoes, lipid degradation compounds arise probably as a

result of thermal degradation and so account for a smaller proportion of the total volatiles
produced.

In view of the large differences in volatile profiles arising from different cooking
methods, it is significant that trained sensory panels can detect differences between
microwave and conventionally baked potatoes (Maga and Twomey, 1977; Brittin and
Trevino, 1980).

Significant effects of storage time on volatile flavour components of baked potatoes
have been investigated (Duckham et al., 2002). As described above for amino acids,
other flavour precursors, including fatty acids and sugars, change in levels during stor-
age. Although potato lipids account for only 0.8–1.3 mg/g dry weight (Galliard, 1973),
70–75% of lipids are the relatively reactive polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic acids,
precursors of a wide range of volatile compounds (Galliard, 1973). Some studies report
an increase in total fatty acid levels on storage (Cotrufo and Lunsetter, 1964; Cherif and
Ben Abdelkader, 1970), whereas other studies report genotypic variations in fatty acid
levels depending on the duration of storage (Dobson et al., 2004). Changes in tuber-
reducing sugar during storage are well characterized (Finglas and Faulks, 1984; Brown
et al., 1990) and generally increase during storage although the extent of the increase is
cultivar-dependent (Blenkinsop et al., 2002).

24.2.4 Molecular and genetic approaches to the study of potato flavour

From this brief summary of our knowledge of potato flavour, it is clear that there
are still large gaps in our knowledge. Although substantial progress has been made in
describing the chemical composition of raw and cooked potato volatiles and of raw
potato composition, studies that correlate extremes in these profiles with taste-trial data
are sparse. Consequently, it is still uncertain which volatile and non-volatile components
should be targeted in an attempt to manipulate potato flavour for particular consumer
groups. It would be useful to correlate profiles with flavour preferences in populations that
segregate for diverse potato flavour and produce quantitative trait locus (QTL) maps from
these data. Potato germplasm, particularly diploid accessions of Solanum phureja, has
been identified with a distinctive flavour. Compared with Solanum tuberosum cultivars,
sensory analysis revealed that S. phureja tubers have a distinctive mouthfeel (high in
smooth and low in grainy and floury traits) and a higher intensity of flavour attributes
(De Maine et al., 2000). In an attempt to explore reasons for the difference in flavour, the
fatty acid and polar lipid contents in tubers from S. phureja and S. tuberosum have been
compared (Dobson et al., 2004). The absolute levels of linoleic and (cid:2)-linolenic acids were
significantly higher in four S. phureja accessions than in four S. tuberosum accessions,
perhaps providing a partial explanation for the taste-trial data although differences in
amino acid and sugar content may also contribute to the different taste. Genetic crosses
using S. phureja accessions, in combination with analytical and sensory analysis, may be
particularly valuable in determining the relative importance of aspects of the flavour trait.
Identifying QTL in potato is becoming more routine (Bradshaw et al., 2004; Gebhardt
et al., 2004) and may lead to the discovery of genes underlying the QTL.

24.2.5 Molecular approaches to dissecting key constituents of tuber flavour

Although the precise contribution of individual volatile and non-volatile components to
overall potato flavour remains to be clarified, circumstantial evidence implicates several
metabolites. In some cases, the biosynthetic routes for the production of the flavour
compound or its precursor is known. For example, the key enzymatic steps that regulate
methionine biosynthesis are now known (Hesse et al., 2004, Fig. 24.2), and using a
transgenic approach, the level of soluble tuber methionine can be manipulated. In one
example, antisense inhibition of threonine synthase leads to a 30-fold increase in tuber
methionine content (Zeh et al., 2001), and in another, over-expression of an Arabidop-
sis cystathionine (cid:3)-synthase gene in potato tubers leads to a six-fold increase in tuber
methionine content (Di et al., 2003, Fig. 24.2). Furthermore, in the latter study, the
increased methionine content resulted in an increase in methional content (up to 4.4-fold)
in baked tubers.

Other transgenic experiments have demonstrated that

tuber fatty acid levels can
be increased by over-expressing an Arabidopsis acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene (Klaus
et al., 2004). In this study, over-expression led to approximately 40% increase in total
fatty acid content and changes in the ratio of linoleic and (cid:2)-linolenic acid. A third
class of volatile metabolites, the sesquiterpenes, have also been manipulated transgeni-
cally in Arabidopsis, again demonstrating the potential of metabolic engineering for
re-designing the profile of flavour compounds (reviewed in Dudareva and Negre, 2005).
The transgenic approach clearly offers an opportunity to dissect the various elements
contributing to overall flavour; however, this approach has not been carried out in
conjunction with sensory analysis, making calibration of analytically derived profiles
impossible.

Although transgenic routes may provide a means to manipulating potato tuber flavour,
acceptability with consumers remains a problem. This may make molecular breeding
strategies a more commercially attractive route to flavour improvement. Such an approach
could exploit germplasm with diverse flavour characteristics and aim to identify alleles
of naturally occurring genes that may account for different flavour profiles. These alleles
can then be introgressed into germplasm with good agronomic traits. With our increased
knowledge of the biochemical pathways leading to flavour compounds and the genes
encoding the key enzymes in these pathways, it may be possible to identify such alleles in
the near future. The combination of metabolically profiling raw and cooked tuber material
with microarray analysis of germplasm, exploiting germplasm with wide phenotypic
variation, has great potential for making further progress in understanding this complex
trait. Indeed some headway has been made with regard to achieving this aim. For example,
Dobson et al. (2005) have shown some correlations between the metabolic profiles of the
raw tuber and that of the volatiles from the cooked material of potatoes already reported
to exhibit distinct flavours (S. tuberosum and S. phureja, Fig. 24.3). Significant species
differences were evident with regard to the relatively elevated levels of leucine, isoleucine
and valine in S. phureja, and in turn, these were shown to be related to the subsequently
increased levels of branched chain aldehydes, esters and alcohols. Such compounds are
associated with desirable potato flavour and aromas (Oruna-Concha et al., 2002a,b). This
was supported by further studies that showed that as the metabolites changed during
storage, so did the corresponding putatively related volatiles.

24.3 POTATO TUBER TEXTURE

Potato tuber texture is a key quality determinant of cooked potato and a major trait that
influences consumer preference. As with flavour, texture is a complex trait to analyse
as it depends on the interaction of many factors, and defining texture that is attrac-
tive to consumers currently depends on sensory panel analysis rather than analytical
measurements. Lugt (1961) proposed a scheme for describing cooked potato texture
(Table 24.1), including aspects related to the degree of disintegration, the consistency,
mealiness and structure of the cooked potato. This scheme provides a basis for compar-
ison between subjective assessments. Other terms are also commonly used to describe

potato texture: flouriness, synonymous with mealiness, describing a dry, soft texture and
waxiness describing a moist firm texture (Jarvis and Duncan, 1992).

Different consumer groups prefer different textures. For example, a dry boiled potato
texture is preferred in Scotland, whereas a waxy texture is preferred in the Netherlands.

Furthermore, boiled potatoes should not disintegrate even if slightly overcooked, a prop-
erty that is difficult to combine with a dry texture (Jarvis and Duncan, 1992).

Factors that have an impact on cooked potato texture include starch content
and distribution within the tuber (Barrios et al., 1963; Burton, 1989; Storey and
Davies, 1992; Matsuura-Endo et al., 2002a), starch swelling pressure (Hoff, 1973; Jarvis
et al., 1992; Shomer, 1995a,b), cell size (Barrios et al., 1963; Linehan et al., 1968; Hoff,
1972), cell-wall structure and composition (Hoff, 1973) and the breakdown of the cell
wall middle lamella (Hughes et al., 1975a,b,c; Burton, 1989; Van Marle et al., 1994;
Matsuura-Endo et al., 2002b) during cooking.

The specific gravity and dry weight of tubers, parameters that are easy to measure, are
often used as a predictor of the degree of cooking disintegration. Within a variety, there is
often a good correlation between specific gravity and cell separation on cooking, but this
relationship does not extend between varieties (Storey and Davies, 1992; Matsuura-Endo
et al., 2002b), indicating other factors are involved. Specific gravity and dry weight mea-
surements in tubers are indicators of starch content. The gelatinization of starch on cooking
may be a factor in cell separation; gelatinized starch swells resulting in an increase in the
internal pressure within tuber cells that may lead to cell separation (reviewed by Reeve,
1977). Although some studies concluded that starch could not generate pressure when it
swelled (Linehan et al., 1968; Hoff, 1972), Jarvis et al. (1992) quantified starch swelling
pressure directly and demonstrated that this pressure could contribute to cell separation
following weakening of the middle lamella by pectin degradation and subsequent cell
wall deformation.

The uncertain nature of the relationship between starch content and degree of dis-
integration on cooking was illustrated by the study of Matsuura-Endo et al. (2002a,b).
Although the degree of tuber disintegration generally increased with starch content within
each of three cultivars tested, there was a wide difference in the degree of disintegration
between the cultivars for a given starch content. A cultivar that contained high starch con-
tent in the area outside the vascular ring was more prone to disintegration than a cultivar
with high starch associated with the vascular ring despite similar overall starch contents.
Larger cell size and intracellular spaces were also evident in tubers from the cultivar
that disintegrated most readily suggesting that cellular architecture plays an overarching
role in cell disintegration (Matsuura-Endo et al., 2002a). Ormerod et al. (2002) measured
thermal weakening of potato parenchyma tissue from tubers containing a range of high
amylose contents and reduced starch-swelling properties. No amylose content-dependent
differences in thermal weakening could be detected leading these authors to conclude that

Potato flavour and texture

thermal degradation of the middle lamella exerts the major influence on disintegration
during cooking. To summarize, the relationship between starch content and composition
and cooked texture is not simple. It may be that most commercially grown tubers contain
enough starch to generate sufficient swelling pressure to drive or initiate cell separation,
and other factors such as starch distribution within the tuber may be more important, but
further study is required.

Cell size has also been implicated as a determinant of cooked potato texture as larger
cells appear to separate more readily during cooking (Barrios et al., 1963; Linehan et al.,
1968; Gray, 1972). Tuber cell size varies according to variety (Linehan et al., 1968)
and increases during tuber development (Gray, 1972; Reeve et al., 1973). As with starch
and amylose content, the correlation between cell size and cooking texture is not always
strong but is another factor that should be considered as contributing to overall texture
(Gray, 1972).

The primary cell walls of the dicotyledonae have been modelled as a composite
of two phases. An insoluble framework of cellulose micro-fibrils hydrogen-bonded by
xyloglucans, which coat and partly span the spaces between the microfibrils (Selvendran
et al., 1987; Carpita and Gibeaut, 1993), provides rigidity and strength. The cellulose–
xyloglucan framework is embedded in a matrix of pectic polysaccharides (Fig. 24.4). The
pectic polysaccharides are thought to perform many functions, such as the definition of
cell wall porosity and the provision of charged surfaces capable of modulating the cell
wall pH and ion balance (Carpita and Gibeaut, 1993). The middle lamella is the interstitial
layer of the cell walls of two adjacent cells and is characterized by its relatively high
level of pectin (Jarvis et al., 1981). Three classes of pectin have been described (Carpita
and Gibeaut, 1993), homogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan I and rhamnogalacturonan
II. The distribution of pectic epitopes in the cell walls of potato tubers has been studied
in detail using monoclonal antibodies specific for different pectic epitopes (Bush and
McCann, 1999; Bush et al., 2001; Parker et al., 2001). The distribution of the pectic
epitopes changes both during tuber development and during storage (Bush et al., 2001).
Homogalacturonans with low levels of methyl esters are capable of binding divalent
cations (such as Ca2+
) and are particularly abundant in the middle lamella of
potato parenchyma cells (Bush and McCann, 1999; Parker et al., 2001). These cation-
binding homogalacturonan polysaccharides can form electrostatic bridges with multiple
divalent cations producing egg-box structures that can lead to the formation of pectin gels
(Carpita and Gibeaut, 1993). The dissociation of these electrostatic bridges by treatment
with calcium chelators, a method which is used to selectively extract pectins (Selvendran,
1985; Brett and Waldron, 1996), may explain the separation of cells along the middle
lamella (Jarvis et al., 1981; Burton, 1989). It is also notable that Ca2+
ions are specifically
located in the middle lamella of potato parenchyma cells (Bush et al., 2001).

and Mg2+

During cooking, it is generally considered that pectin in the middle lamella is solu-
bilized leading to softening of the potato (Storey and Davies, 1992). Release of pectic
polysaccharides into the cooking medium is closely correlated with a decrease in cell firm-
ness (Van Marle et al., 1994). The release of pectic material during cooking was compared
in tubers with different textural properties (mealy cultivar Irene compared with non-mealy
cultivar Nicola). With both cultivars having equivalent cell size, the release of pectic
material and cell sloughing were higher for cultivar Irene. Similar results were obtained

with the release of pectic polysaccharides into the cooking medium when potato discs of
a uniform starch content and cell size had been cooked for varying times. The degree of
cell separation on cooking is also dependent on the nature of the cooking medium as this

will affect the degree and rate of leaching of depolymerized pectic substances. Conditions
that disrupt interactions of pectic polysaccharides with calcium and magnesium bridges
by ion exchange, hydrogen bond breakage or chelation will reduce cell adhesion. Thus,
inclusion of chelating agents such as sodium hexametaphosphate (Hughes et al., 1975c)
or EDTA (Matsuura-Endo et al., 2002b) induces cell separation. Conversely, soaking
tubers in a solution of calcium chloride prior to cooking reduces cell separation probably
as a result of stabilizing or enhancing linkages between homogalacturonan acid chains in
the middle lamella (Storey and Davies, 1992).

(cid:3)

Attempts have been made to dissect the various factors that contribute to cell separation
during cooking (Matsuura-Endo et al., 2002b). This study compared three cultivars with
tubers that disintegrated to different extents on cooking. The swelling power of isolated
starch was determined and found to be greatest in the cultivar that exhibited the lowest
degree of cooking-dependent cell separation, indicating that this parameter was not of
primary importance in the process. Tuber cell separation was induced by treatment of
tuber slices for 32 h in the presence of EDTA at 50
C. At this temperature, starch is not
gelatinized and cannot contribute to cell separation. The cultivar that exhibited the greatest
degree of cell separation under these conditions also exhibited the highest degree of
boiling-induced cell separation. Additionally, the cultivar that exhibited the highest degree
of cooking-dependent cell separation contained significantly lower levels of calcium and
galacturonic acids, possibly reflecting differences in middle lamella structure. However,
studies by Van Dijk et al. (2002) have suggested that there was minimal relationship
between cell wall and texture. They studied two potato cultivars with very distinct cooked
textures that had been segregated into small, medium and large tubers with low and
high dry matter and which were stored for set periods. They found that there were no
significant differences in pectin composition and amount between the cultivars and that
despite large changes in pectin during storage there were minimal changes in sensory-
perceived texture of the cooked potatoes following storage. Indeed, they found that dry
matter (starch content) was the dominant factor with regard to texture.

Cell cleavage is also an important factor in determining texture after cooking (Jarvis
and Duncan, 1992). A soft texture arises from both cell separation and cell cleavage,
whereas a dry texture results from a high degree of cell separation with lesser degree of
cell cleavage.

With the advent of metabolic profiling technologies, potato microarrays, transgenic
technologies and improved knowledge of potato genetics, we are poised to build on the
studies outlined above in order to produce potato cultivars with improved texture. As
with flavour, potato germplasm that exhibits major differences in tuber texture exists
(De Maine et al., 2000). It is now possible to establish genetic populations that segregate
for aspects of tuber texture and to carry out QTL analysis of these populations. As many
of the genes involved in starch and cell wall biosynthesis and turnover are known, it
may be possible to use microarray technologies to identify candidate genes by correlating
their expression patterns in tubers that show differences in texture. Candidate genes can
then be function-tested in transgenic models by modulating their expression levels and
examining the effects on tuber texture. Already, attempts have been made to engineer
potato cell-wall structure by the down-regulation of endogenous genes (Pilling et al.,
2004) or the over-expression of bacterial genes (Oomen et al., 2002). Ultimately, it may

538

Taylor et al.

be possible to identify alleles of genes associated with particular aspects of texture and
to design molecular markers for such alleles to assist their introgression into commercial
germplasm.

There are various insect pests of potato capable of causing tuber yield or quality reductions
of 30–70% if not routinely controlled (Raman and Radcliffe, 1992). Losses of this magni-
tude can occur in potatoes unprotected from Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decem-
lineata (Say) (Chrysomelidae); aphid (Aphididae)-transmitted viruses, e.g. potato leafroll
virus (PLRV) (Luteoviridae, Genus Polerovirus) and potato virus Y (PVY) (Potyviri-
dae, Genus Potyvirus); potato tuber moths (potato tuberworm), Phthorimaea operculella
(Zeller) (Gelechiidae); Symmetrischema tangolias (Plaesiosema) (Gyen) (Gelechiidae);
Guatemalan moth, Tecia (Scrobipalpopsis) Solanivora (Polyvon´y) (Gelechiidae) and
tomato leafminer, Tuta (Scrobipalpula) absoluta (Meyrick); pea leafminer, Liriomyza
huidobrensis (Blanchard) (Agromyzidae); Andean potato weevils, Premnotrypes spp.
(Curculionidae) and potato leafhopper, Empoasca fabae (Harris) (Cicadellidae).

25.1 YIELD AND QUALITY EFFECTS

25.1.1 Defoliators

Of the multitude of leaf-feeding insects attacking potato, the best known and most destruc-
tive is Colorado potato beetle. Numerous researchers have reported on the effects of
defoliation imposed at various stages of potato growth (Elkinton et al., 1985). These
studies were consistent in that plant damage inflicted before tuber bulking delayed haulm
and tuber growth rates but plants could recover, whereas damage during tuber bulking
permanently reduced growth rates indicating decreased assimilation efficiency (Dripps
and Smilowitz, 1989). Ratio of leaf area to plant dry matter weight appeared to explain
this temporal shift in sensitivity to damage, with vegetative plants having greater leaf area
to dry weight ratios than tuber-bulking plants. Early season damage to upper younger
portions of the plant, typical of most defoliating insects, can actually increase assimilation
efficiency and tuber yields, presumably because opening the canopy promotes develop-
ment of axillary buds which permits greater light interception by lower leaves. In general,
potato growers tend to have a lower tolerance threshold for insect-inflicted defoliation
than does potato, often resulting in unnecessary application of insecticide.

25.1.2 Sap feeders

Insects with piercing-sucking mouthparts damage potatoes by direct physical injury,
extracting phloem, injecting toxic saliva and transmitting pathogens or facilitating their
establishment on the host. Although potato has considerable ability to compensate for
early season loss of foliage by defoliators, there is little compensation for adverse effects
on plant health, e.g. disruption of nutrient transport, reduced photosynthetic efficiency or
infection with plant pathogens. Direct physical injury by sap-feeding insects often results
in premature leaf senescence.

25.1.3 Pathogen transmission

Many insect pests are potential vectors of potato pathogens. This association can be
casual with the insect serving as a mechanical vector or providing entry for invasion
by pathogens present in the environment. Of greatest importance are instances in which
the insect is the principal or sole means of pathogen transmission. Aphid-transmitted
viruses probably cause greater economic loss in potato production than all other insect-
related damage. Some 40 virus species are known to infect potato, and of these, 13 are
aphid-transmitted (Salazar, 1996, Chapter 28, Valkonen, this volume).

The aphid-transmitted potato viruses of most common occurrence and greatest eco-
nomic importance are PLRV and PVY. Planting seed tubers with a high incidence of
secondary (tuber borne) PLRV or PVY infection can result in yield losses exceeding
50–80% (Beemster and de Bokx, 1987). Primary infection (current season) with either
PLRV or most PVY strains tends to have little effect on tuber yield. However, primary
infection with PLRV can affect tuber quality in certain cultivars, most notably Russet
Burbank, by causing a phloem defect termed ‘net necrosis’ that develops in storage.

Other aphid-transmitted potato viruses include potato virus A (PVA, genus Potyvirus),
potato virus M [PVM (paracrinkle), genus Carlavirus], potato virus S (PVS, genus
Carlavirus), potato latent virus (PLV, genus Carlavirus), Alfalfa mosaic virus [AMV
(calico), genus Alfamovirus] and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, genus Cucumovirus).

Most plant viruses occur in nature as variants, which if they differ sufficiently from
type are designated as strains. A number of PVY strains have been described that vary
in symptomology in potato. PVYN (the ‘tobacco Veinal necrotic strain’ of PVY) appears
increasingly common worldwide and is predominant in Europe (Weidemann, 1988).
PVYN causes severe necrosis in tobacco but in potato is usually mild compared with
PVYO (‘ordinary’ PVY) and is essentially asymptomatic in many cultivars. PVYNTN
(tuber necrosis subgroup) infection can induce a rapid and severe systemic veinal necrosis
and severely damaged tubers that cannot be marketed or stored. This disease, potato tuber
necrotic ringspot disease (PTNRD), is now distributed worldwide (Nie and Singh, 2002).
Co-infection of PVY with other viruses, e.g. potato virus X (PVX, genus Potexvirus) or
PVS, may influence the severity of symptom expression. In North America, recombinants
of PVYN and PVYO (designated as PVYN(cid:2)O) are now more common than PVYO (Piche
et al., 2004). All PVY strains are transmitted by aphids, but PVYC, stipple streak strain,
is transmitted only in the presence of a helper component the vector acquires feeding

Insect pests in potato

on PVY- or PVA-infected plants. Within vector species, populations differ in ability
to transmit (Gray and Gildow, 2003; Basky and Almási, 2005). Virus infections not
readily detected by visual symptoms because of virus strain or asymptomatic cultivars
make it difficult for seed certification programmes to purge virus inoculum (Mollov and
Thill, 2004).

25.1.4 Root and tuber feeding

Insect damage to potato roots and tubers is usually caused by feeding of larval stages
with adults generally causing little or no subterranean damage. Soil insects tend to
have minor effects on potato yields, but the damage caused can greatly reduce tuber
quality. Damaged tubers may necessitate post-harvest sorting, reduce saleability or market
price and create storage problems. Some insects damage potato seed pieces or roots
of developing seedlings resulting in weak plants or stand loss. Others, e.g. seedcorn
maggot, Delia platura (Meig.) (Anthomyiidae), can transmit bacterial cells of Erwinia
spp. (Enterobacteriaceae), causal agents of such potato pathogens as blackleg, aerial stem
rot and tuber soft rot (see Chapter 27, Van der Wolf and De Boer, this volume).

Each region and potato production system has its own complex of tuber-infesting pests.
In the high altitudes of South America, the Andean weevil complex, primarily Premnotrypes
spp. (Curculionidae), can be extraordinarily destructive. Other regions contend with white
grubs (Scarabaeidae), wireworms (Elateridae), weevils, subterranean cutworms (Noctuidae)
or others of a host of potential tuber pests. In worldwide economic importance, no tuber pest
equals potato tuber moth. This insect damages both foliage and tubers, but potential for loss
is greatest in storage. Larvae entering storage in infested tubers can continue their develop-
ment filling the tubers with frass and enabling entry of decay organisms.

Larvae of most tuber-infesting potato pests are generalist herbivores. Thus, knowledge
of previous crop rotation is helpful in assessing risk and need for insecticidal control.
Planting into warm soil to assure rapid plant growth is recommended. To protect devel-
oping tubers from damage by soil insects, insecticides must be applied at-planting, either
in-furrow or as seed treatments, but control is often incomplete. There is little that can
be done to protect the potato crop after planting other than to assure that seed pieces and
developing tubers are well covered with soil.

25.2 INSECT PESTS OF WORLDWIDE IMPORTANCE

25.2.1 Aphids

25.2.1.1 Occurrence and damage

High aphid densities can cause significant yield losses and even direct plant injury, but
because of their role as virus vectors, aphids are of paramount concern to seed potato
producers. Severe losses of tuber yield and quality in ware production can result when
potato plants are propagated from virus-infected seed pieces (Marshall et al., 1988; Hamm
and Hane, 1999; Hane and Hamm, 1999).

546

Radcliffe and Lagnaoui

In plants grown from infected tubers, PLRV is found almost exclusively in phloem tis-
sues and most abundantly in companion cells (van den Heuvel et al., 1995). Thus, vectors
must feed on phloem to acquire the virus. Potato leafroll virus is only transmitted by aphids
that colonize potato and not by all colonizing aphids. Green peach aphid (peach–potato
aphid), Myzus persicae (Sulzer), is the most efficient and important vector of PLRV.
Most populations of potato aphid (green and pink potato aphid), Macrosiphum euphorbiae
(Thomas), transmit PLRV poorly if at all, but this species occasionally has been implicated
in early season spread (Woodford et al., 1995). Other potential PLRV vectors include
black bean aphid, Aphis fabae Scopoli; buckthorn aphid (buckthorn–potato aphid), Aphis
nasturtii (Kaltenbach); the melon (cotton) aphid complex, Aphis gossypii Glover [includ-
ing Aphis frangulae (Kaltenbach)]; shallot aphid, Myzus ascalonicus Doncaster; violet
aphid, Myzus ornatus Laing; mottled arum aphid, Aulacorthum (Neomyzus) circumflexum
(Buckton); foxglove aphid (glasshouse–potato aphid), Aulacorthum solani (Kaltenbach);
damson–hop aphid, Phorodon humuli (Schrank); the stolon-infesting bulb and potato
aphid, Rhopalosiphoninus latysiphon (Davidson) and mangold aphid, Rhopalosiphoninus
staphyleae (Koch). It should be noted that M. persicae is a species complex with two
other described species, Myzus nicotianae (Blackman) and Myzus antirrhinii (Macchiati).
Genetic marker research has cast doubt on validity of M. nicotianae as a distinct species
but confirmed validity of M. antirrhinii (Blackman and Spence, 1992).

Over 50 aphid species are known to transmit PVY (Ragsdale et al., 2001). Green
peach aphid, the most important vector of PLRV, is also the most efficient vector of PVY
(Bourdin et al., 1998), but the greater abundance of some less-efficient vector species, or
their propensity to develop alatae, can make them more important in PVY epidemiology
(Harrington and Gibson, 1989; DiFonzo et al., 1997; Heimbach et al., 1998; Davis et al.,
2005). Most potential PVY vectors have only transient association with potato, alighting
and probing, but not colonizing. Aphid species implicated as important PVY vectors
include potato and pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris); black bean aphid; melon
aphid; buckthorn aphid; soybean aphid, Acyrthosiphon glycines (Matsumura); leaf-curling
plum aphid, Brachycaudus helichrysi (Kaltenbach) and several species of cereal aphids,
the most important being bird cherry–oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.).

25.2.1.2 Life cycles

Aphid life cycles often involve clonal polymorphism (morphs). Polymorphism allows
aphids to allocate resources efficiently to accomplish specific functions but imposes
constraints, e.g. resources allocated to flight muscles are not available for reproduction.
In 97% of aphid species, reproduction is both asexual (parthenogenetic) and sexual,
with multiple generations of asexual, viviparous reproduction between each occurrence
of sexual reproduction (Blackman, 1980). Most aphid species have four larval instars
(nymphs) before becoming adults. In temperate regions, most aphid species show seasonal
alternation of hosts (are heteroecious) and overwinter as fertilized eggs (are holocyclic).
The overwintering (primary) host is often a woody plant, whereas summer (secondary)
hosts are usually short-lived herbaceous species. The primary host range typically is
highly specific, whereas the secondary host range may be broad. Alternation of hosts is
an evolutionary adaptation that has permitted aphids to exploit agricultural crops more
successfully perhaps than any other insect group (Moran, 1992).

Green peach aphid eggs are deposited in fall on the primary host, peach, Prunus
persica (L.) Batsch (Rosaceae), and closely related Prunus species. In spring, eggs hatch
producing nonwinged (apterae), parthenogenetic, viviparous stem mothers (fundatrices).
Winged progeny (alatae) appear by second generation, and the number and proportion
of winged progeny peak in the third generation on the primary host (Boiteau and Parry,
1985). Winged green peach aphid invading potato can be true spring migrants from the
primary host or alatae produced after several generations of parthenogenetic, viviparous
reproduction (virginoparae) on secondary hosts, which include many common crops and
weeds. Progeny of spring migrants are invariably apterous, but some proportion of each
succeeding generation is winged. In late season, fall migrants, male and female, are
produced. Female migrants that reproduce asexually on the primary host (gynoparae) give
birth to apterous, sexual female progeny (oviparae). Oviparae mate with male migrants
(androparae) and produce fertilized eggs. In harsh climates, wintering outdoors is not
always possible. In milder climates and glasshouses, continuous asexual reproduction can
occur. In some parts of the world, particularly in the tropics, clones that have lost the
ability to produce sexually can persist. The parthenogenetic life style of aphids coupled
with a rapid completion of generations (typically 7–10 days) allows for spectacular rates
of population increase. Under ideal field conditions, green peach aphid populations can
double in as little as 1.7 days.

25.2.1.3 Transmission of viruses

Numerous authors have reviewed the role of aphids in transmitting potato viruses
(Ragsdale et al., 2001; Robert and Bourdin, 2001; Radcliffe and Ragsdale, 2002). A com-
mon theme of these reviews is that aphids possess biological attributes that make them
especially effective in acquiring and transmitting plant viruses. Among the most impor-
tant of these attributes are complex life cycles with specialized morphs, alternation of
host plants and exceptionally short life cycles facilitated by parthenogenetic reproduc-
tion. Movement of virus into a potato field from an outside inoculum source is almost
exclusively by winged aphids (Boiteau, 1997). Within field, spread of PLRV is often
by apterae walking from plant to plant (Hanafi et al., 1989), but movement of PVY is
thought to be almost exclusively by alatae (Ragsdale et al., 1994). Green peach aphid
apterae tend to be more efficient vectors of PLRV than are alatae, and nymphs are more
efficient than adults (Robert, 1971).

Aphid-transmitted viruses differ in how they are acquired, whether they circulate
within the body of the vector, how they are transmitted to healthy plants and how long
a vector remains infective following virus acquisition (Nault, 1997). Potato leafroll virus
is circulative in the vector and transmitted persistently. A latent period (typically 24 h or
more) exists between acquisition of PLRV by the vector and onset of ability to transmit.
This lag occurs because PLRV must pass through the gut into the hemocoel and enter
accessory salivary glands before transmission can occur. Potato leafroll virus does not
replicate in aphids. Both acquisition and transmission take minimum feeding times of
minutes to hours with maximum acquisition requiring about 12 h. Once a vector acquires
PLRV, it usually remains infective for life and capable of transmission even following
moults. Green peach aphid acquires more PLRV and tends to transmit sooner when it

548

Radcliffe and Lagnaoui

feeds at higher temperatures (Syller, 1994). Potato leafroll virus is acquired more readily
from the top leaves of young, secondarily infected plants than from older plants, but
acquisition is not correlated with virus titre or feeding activity (van den Heuvel et al.,
1993). Bacterial endosymbionts, Buchnera spp. (Lepraliellidae), play a role in PLRV
transmission (van den Heuvel et al., 1994). Potato leafroll virus has a strong affinity for
symbionin, the major protein synthesized and released into the hemolymph by Buchnera.
Potato leafroll virus cannot be transmitted mechanically.

All known aphid-transmitted potato viruses other than PLRV are transmitted in a non-
persistent manner. Transmission of nonpersistent viruses is unique to aphids and occurs
during short duration surface probes required for host recognition (Pollard, 1973). With
nonpersistent viruses, e.g. PVY, no latent period occurs, and the aphid remains virulif-
erous only for a few feeding probes following acquisition and never following a moult.
Nonpersistent viruses are described as stylet borne, but clearly, more dynamic processes
are involved than mere stylet contamination as not all aphid species can transmit nonper-
sistent viruses. Electrical penetration graph (EPG) recording has been used to associate
specific aphid-feeding activities with Potyvirus transmission. Results show that Potyvirus
inoculation occurs during the first subphase of stylet intracellular puncture (Martín et al.,
1997), whereas acquisition occurs primarily in the last subphase (Powell, 2005).

Association of aphid flight activity and spread of potato viruses is well documented.
Aphid trapping networks have been established in many potato seed-producing areas to
monitor aphid flight activity and issue risk advisories. A European consortium operates
12-m suction traps at 73 sites in 19 countries ‘to provide an integrated, standardised, long
term, consolidated, Europe-wide database on aphid incidence’ (Harrington and EXAMINE
Consortium, 2004). Trap captures were found to be representative of green peach aphid
abundance patterns over large areas of Northwestern Europe and to be associated with
climatic gradients and land use patterns (Cocu et al., 2005b). High temperatures and low
rainfall had a weak-positive association with abundance (Cocu et al., 2005a). Mild winters
and early springs favour green peach aphid, e.g. an increase of 1
C in mean January–
February temperatures advances spring migration by 2 weeks in the UK (Harrington
et al., 1995). However, local crop landscapes were the factors most strongly associated
with local abundance, e.g. area of oilseed rape (canola), Brassica napus L. (Cruciferae),
was positively correlated with green peach aphid abundance, whereas first capture was
associated with rainfall (Cocu et al., 2005c).

25.2.1.4 Control

Insecticides are the only practical means of suppressing colonizing aphids on crops but are
of inconsistent benefit in controlling virus spread. Among reported successes in controlling
virus spread with insecticides (all crops and insect vectors), 94 of 119 cases involved
persistent and semi-persistent viruses (Perring et al., 1999), whereas most failures, 32 of
48 cases, involved nonpersistent viruses. Viruliferous alatae are seldom killed quickly
enough to prevent virus transmission, even of PLRV. In contrast, spread of PLRV from
within-field sources can be interrupted because of the extended post-acquisition latent
period before an aphid can transmit. Systemic insecticides applied at time of planting or
plant emergence can reduce within field spread of PLRV significantly (Woodford et al.,
1988; Boiteau and Singh, 1999).

Insect pests in potato

Insecticide resistance is a worldwide problem in green peach aphid (Devonshire et al.,
1998; Dewar et al., 1998), and resistance has developed to all major insecticide classes except
neonicotinoids and pymetrozine (Nauen and Elbert, 2003). Resistance to organophosphates
was first documented in green peach aphid from Washington State in 1952. Resistant pop-
ulations spread rapidly, and within 10 years, aphids with the identical resistance genes, E4
and FE4, were found in Europe and elsewhere leading to the conclusion that migration of
winged aphids and transport of aphid-infested plants had spread resistance throughout the
world. Impairment of aphid control has not been reported to neonicotinoids, but susceptibil-
ity of green peach aphid can vary 20-fold among populations (Nauen and Denholm, 2005).
Most organophosphate, carbamate and pyrethroid insecticides registered for use on potato
tend to flare outbreaks of green peach aphid (ffrench-Constant et al., 1988; Harrington
et al., 1989). Secondary outbreaks are usually attributed to disruption of natural enemies and
insecticide resistance in the secondary pest, but in some instances, there is a direct stimula-
tion of reproduction (Gordon and McEwen, 1984).

Mineral oils applied to plants can substantially reduce PVY transmission. Limitations
to crop oils include weathering of oil deposits, new plant growth between applications and
incomplete coverage. The mechanism by which oils inhibit aphid transmission of viruses
is still not known. Bradley et al. (1966) suggested that oil interferes with adherence of
the virus to receptors on the mouthparts. Crop oils can be mildly repellent to aphids, and
some cause direct mortality, but the latter effect is unlikely to occur quickly enough to
prevent transmission of a nonpersistently transmitted virus (Martín et al., 2004).

Current potato cultivars differ too little in aphid susceptibility for host plant resistance
to be useful in preventing virus spread. Through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation,
various potato lines were generated expressing genes conferring resistance to viruses
(Berger and German, 2001). Transgenic lines have been developed that are highly resis-
tant, but not immune to infection by PLRV, PVY and PVX. Although aphids can still
acquire virus from low-titre plants, efficiency of transmission is greatly reduced (Thomas
et al., 1997). This technology was far more effective than any previously used tactic, but
these cultivars have been withdrawn because of concerns over a public backlash against
genetically modified food (Thornton, 2003).

Ideally, seed potato increase should occur in localities well isolated from potential
sources of virus inoculum. However, in many countries, there is little isolation of late-
generation seed and commercial potato production. The question then is what is the
minimum separation from sources of virus inoculum or crops producing large vector
populations required to reduce risk of virus spread to acceptable levels? Halbert et al.
(1990) suggested that 400 m–5 km could provide effective isolation from known PVY
sources but that 32 km might be required for isolation from PLRV sources, because the
vector remains infective for life. In England, minimum separation of 800 m from potential
sources of PVY is recommended (Harrington et al., 1986), although just 40 m reduced
spread of PVY in Denmark (Hiddema, 1972). Isolation can also be achieved by early
planting and haulm destruction (‘vine-kill’).

Physical removal of symptomatic plants from seed potato fields has long been an
important virus management tactic and is most practical when virus incidence is low
and the field is small enough that every plant can be inspected several times during the
growing season. Roguing is easiest to accomplish before the canopy closes and must

550

Radcliffe and Lagnaoui

be accomplished before secondary infection occurs. If the seed field is heavily infected
(>1% virus), roguing is often ineffective because some infected plants are almost certain
to be missed and will remain as sources of inoculum. When vector pressure is high, even
initially low levels of seed-borne infection can result in explosive spread (Sigvald, 1989).
Polymer webs can provide a high degree of protection against aphid-transmitted viruses
(Harrewijn et al., 1991). However, the cost and inconvenience of row covers limit their
application to seed potato fields of very high value and small size (e.g., first-generation
field increase after tissue culture). Barrier crops are more widely adaptable than mulches
or floating row covers; they are easier to install and keep in place and do not lose
effectiveness because of weathering or when the crop canopy closes. Barrier crops should
have a fallow outside border with no gap between barrier crop and the potato field,
because winged aphids tend to alight at the interface of fallow ground and crop canopy.
If immigrating alatae carrying PVY feed first on the border crop, they will probably lose
their virus inoculum before moving into the potatoes (DiFonzo et al., 1996). Barrier crops
need be only a few metres wide to be effective. In Lower Saxony, oat borders just 1 m
wide reduced the number of winged aphids, e.g. R. padi, caught in potato fields and were
more effective in reducing PVY spread than intensive use of insecticides (Thieme et al.,
1998). However, crop borders will not be effective if there is virus inoculum within the
field being protected.

In temperate climates, most known weed hosts of PVY or PLRV are annuals, and as
transmission through true seed does not occur, these species are not virus sources. In
the Souss Valley of Morocco, jimsonweed, Datura stramonium L. (Solanaceae), supports
green peach aphid before the winter potato crop emerges. This weed and volunteer
potatoes were implicated as being principal sources of both viruliferous aphids and PLRV
inoculum (Hanafi et al., 1995). Volunteer potatoes that emerge as weeds in rotation crops
in the Columbia Basin are important PLRV reservoirs (Thomas, 1983), as are potatoes
sprouting in cull piles in Canada (Frazer, 1987). Annual weed hairy nightshade, Solanum
sarrachoides (Sendtner), is both a reservoir of PLRV and a preferred host of green peach
aphid in the US Pacific Northwest (Alvarez and Srinivasan, 2005). However, because
ware producers often plant tubers with 1–5% virus, potato generally overshadows weeds
as a source of potato viruses. In regions where winter frost extends below the root zone of
potatoes, volunteer potatoes are rare and usually inconsequential sources of potato viruses.
Static action thresholds in the range of 20–100 green peach aphid apterae per 100 leaves
have been proposed to control PLRV spread in potatoes grown for fresh market or pro-
cessing. The threshold concept may be less applicable to seed potato production because
of the biological complexities involved and stringent phytosanitary standards that must be
achieved, but thresholds in the range of 1–10 apterae per 100 leaves have been proposed
for cultivars susceptible to net necrosis and in seed production (Flanders et al., 1991).

25.2.2 Colorado potato beetle

25.2.2.1 Origin, occurrence and damage

The genus Leptinotarsa apparently originated in central Mexico, where the primary host
of Colorado potato beetle is still buffalobur, Solanum rostratum Dunal, and Solanum

Insect pests in potato

551

angustifolium Mill. Westward expansion of agriculture into the US central plains intro-
duced potato production within the range of Colorado potato beetle distribution by 1820,
but the beetle was unknown as a potato pest until 1859. Over the next 25 years, Col-
orado potato beetle extended its range north into Canada east to the Atlantic and became
permanently established in Europe prior to 1922 (de Wilde and Hsiao, 1981). Its spread
eastward was rapid, reaching Germany in 1936, Poland in the mid-1950s, the western
borders of the USSR by 1959 and the Caucasus and Turkey by 1976. Colorado potato
beetle has since spread to Iran, the Central Asian Republics, western China, Siberia and
Russian far east.

(cid:2)

In temperate climates, Colorado potato beetle passes winter as adults in the soil. The
developmental threshold for this species is about 10
C, but a considerable range of values
have been reported for different populations. Emergence in spring usually occurs before
potatoes have broken ground. The insect is remarkably fecund, with females typically
laying 300–500 eggs in masses of 20 or more. At constant temperatures, development is
C, with the beetle going from egg to adults in as little as 20.7 days (Ferro
optimal at 28
et al., 1985). At optimal temperatures, larval development can be completed in 7.1 days.
There are four larval instars, with 75% of total foliage consumption by larvae occurring
in the final instar. The insects are voracious feeders, and complete defoliation and even
haulm destruction can result.

(cid:2)

Throughout most of its range, Colorado potato beetle has one or two generations per
year, but in southern latitudes and mild climates, three or even four are possible. Even
where two generations are the rule, a significant portion of newly emerged first-generation
adults burrow directly into the soil and enter diapause (Tauber et al., 1988; Senanayake
et al., 2000). Photoperiod at time of emergence from pupation is critical in determining the
onset of diapause in summer adults. In northern latitudes and at high elevations, Colorado
potato beetle is a typical long-day insect. Photoperiodic-induced adult diapause appears
to be a recent adaptation to the insect’s expanded distribution range (Hsiao, 1981). In its
southern range, Colorado potato beetle populations are not photoresponsive.

25.2.2.2 Control

Colorado potato beetle has been the object of numerous innovations in crop protection.
The first success of the agricultural insecticide era was the use of Paris green, cuprous ace-
toarsenite, against Colorado potato beetle in midwestern United States in the 1860s. Many
advances in insecticide application equipment were in response to this pest, including first
hand-operated compression sprayers, first wheel-drawn sprayers, first traction-operated
dusters, first engine-operated sprayer and first air-blast sprayer (Gauthier et al., 1981).
Potatoes were also one of the first crops to be treated by airplane.

Colorado potato beetle is legendary for its capacity to develop insecticide resistance
(Forgash, 1981). Colorado potato beetle has developed resistance to all major classes
of synthetic insecticidal classes, including the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (Zhao et al.,
2000). Imidacloprid resistance is still localized in the United States, but the trend is of
concern as worldwide neonicotinoids are the insecticide class most used on potato.

Recommended thresholds for application of insecticidal sprays to control Colorado
potato beetle are often based either on beetle densities or on defoliation. For example,

552

Radcliffe and Lagnaoui

treatment has been recommended if beetle densities reach 0.5 adults, 4 small larvae (1st
and 2nd instar) or 1.5 large larvae per stem (Ferro, 1985), exceed 20 larvae per plant
(Martel et al., 1986) or if defoliation exceeds 10% (Holliday and Parry, 1987). However,
treatments at or shortly after egg hatching tend to give best control. Sprays applied later
may not control large larvae that are much more tolerant of exposure. Also, if spray
applications are delayed, some larvae may have already quit feeding or dropped to the
ground to pupate.

With the introduction of the neonicotinoids, a common approach to Colorado potato
beetle control has been to apply the insecticide in-furrow or as seed piece treatments.
Treating only border rows or some proportion of rows within fields could make for
more efficient use of at-planting treatments and conserve susceptibility in the population
(Dively et al., 1998).

Crop rotation can be effective in delaying establishment of Colorado potato beetle in
new plantings (Wright, 1984; Sexson and Wyman, 2005). Overwintered Colorado potato
beetles need to regenerate their flight muscles and do not oviposit until they have fed on
a nutritionally adequate host plant. Rotating a planting by as little as 200–400 m from
last year’s location can delay colonization of the new planting by 1–2 weeks, generally
resulting in lower population densities than in nonrotated fields and can save 1–2 sprays
for first-generation larvae. Reducing the need for repeated insecticide applications has the
indirect benefit of reducing selection for insecticide resistance. In some situations, field
rotation will sufficiently delay emergence of most summer adults until day lengths are
short enough to induce diapause.

25.2.3 Potato tuber moths

25.2.3.1 Origin, occurrence and damage

Tuber moths are the most damaging lepidopteran pests of potato throughout the tropics and
subtropics. The tuber moth complex consists of four species that are pests of potato: potato
tuber moth; Andean potato tuber moth, Symmetrischema tangolias (plaesiosema) (Gyen);
Guatemalan moth, Tecia (Scrobipalpopsis) solanivora (Polvoný) and tomato leafminer,
Tuta (Scrobipalpula) absoluta (Meyrick). Tuber moths are believed to have originated
in the humid subtropics of South America where their principal host plants, potato and
tobacco, Nicotiana tabacum L. (Solanaceae), are indigenous and where potato tuber moth
is associated with a rich parasite complex and is of minor economic importance.

Potato tuber moth is the most widely distributed species of the complex, and despite
quarantine efforts, it has spread worldwide. In warm climates, potato tuber moth can
complete 8–14 generations per year (Trivedi and Rajagopal, 1992). Survival is optimal
from 20 to 30
C (Sporleder et al.,
2004). Potato appears to be the preferred host, but many plant species, cultivated and
wild, are attacked. Potato tuber moth damages both foliage and tubers, but the major
damage occurs when larva feed on stored tubers.

C, and optimal population increase occurs at 28–30

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

Potato tuber moth eggs are deposited on upper leaf surfaces and emerging larvae
mine leaflets. As leaflets are consumed, larvae may leave their tunnels and web together
adjacent leaflets. Larvae sometimes mine stems causing entire terminals to die. Partially

Insect pests in potato

553

grown larvae sometimes invade tubers in the field, particularly when the soil is dry and
deeply cracked.

Potato tuber moth is particularly damaging in North Africa. In Tunisia, 60–70% of the
main season potato production is kept for 3–4 months in rustic, nonrefrigerated stores. In
the absence of control measures, tuber infestations can reach 100% within 2–3 months
of storage (von Arx et al., 1990). In Peru, tuber infestation of over 90% was recorded
following 4 months of rustic storage (Raman et al., 1987).

Guatemala moth is a devastating and increasingly important potato pest in Central
America, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. The risk is great that Guatemala moth will
move southward to Peru and Bolivia. Larvae of this species primarily attack tubers.
Ecuador had severe infestations in 2001 with tens of thousands of hectares of potato unfit
to harvest and 0.5 million bags of harvested potatoes that had to be discarded (IRD, 2002).
The insect is an aggressive invader. In 2000, Guatemala moth was found in the Canary
Islands and is now on the red list of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection
Organization. It is considered to be a major threat to potato crops throughout southern
Europe.

Andean tuber moth causes significant economic losses in potato stores in Peru and
Bolivia. It has been reported in Tasmania, Australia and more recently in Indonesia and
New Zealand. In the field, Andean tuber moth larvae mine foliage and bore into stems
making chemical control extremely difficult. In storage, tubers are destroyed by larval
mining, have a foul odour and are unfit for consumption or seed. Tuber damage in 51
farm stores surveyed in Peru ranged from 2 to 78% (Raman, 1988b).

Tomato leafminer damages only above ground portions of the plant. It is a pest of
both potato and tomato, Solanum lycopersicon L., in temperate coastal locations of Peru,
Chile, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil (Moore, 1983). Susceptible potato genotypes can
be completely destroyed by this pest. Tomato leafminer has developed resistance to a
wide range of insecticides, including methamidophos, deltamethrin and even abamectin
(Lietti et al., 2005).

25.2.3.2 Control

Sex pheromones have provided a useful tool for managing populations of potato tuber
moth. In severe field infestations, mating disruption can be effective (Bosa et al., 2005).
Water pan and funnel traps were effective in mass trapping to reduce potato tuber moth
damage in storage (Raman, 1988a). Thresholds are cultivar dependent, but a general
recommendation is for insecticide application when moth captures exceed 40 moths in
any one night or a cumulative mean of 15–20. In Israel, trap captures of potato tuber moth
proved useful in predicting first appearance in the field and correlated with infestations
in foliage, but the latter only on dry sandy soils (Coll et al., 2000).

Potato tuber moth pheromone consists of two components, E-(trans-)4, Z-(cis-)7-
tridecadien-1-ol acetate (PTM-1) (Roelofs et al., 1975) and trans-4, cis-7, cis-10-
tridecatrien-1-ol acetate (PTM-2) (Persoons et al., 1976). Blends of PTM-1 and PTM-2
were more effective than either alone, but the ratio was not critical (Voerman and
Rothschild, 1978). For Andean tuber moth, the pheromone consists of a 2:1 mixture of
(cid:3)E(cid:4) Z(cid:5)-3,7 tetradecadienyl acetate and (cid:3)E(cid:5)-3-tetradecenyl acetate (Griepink et al., 1995),

554

Radcliffe and Lagnaoui

for Guatemala moth, a blend of (cid:3)E(cid:5)-3-dodecenyl acetate and (cid:3)Z(cid:5)-3-dodecenyl acetate
(Nesbitt et al., 1985) and for tomato leafminer, a blend of (cid:3)E(cid:4) Z(cid:5)-3,8,14 acetate and (cid:3)E(cid:5)-3,
(cid:3)Z(cid:5)-8,11,14 acetate (Michereff Filho et al., 2000).

Extensive efforts have been undertaken to identify potential sources of genetic resis-
tance to the tuber moth complex. Lack of knowledge about resistance mechanisms and
their genetic expression has obstructed efficient selection of wild potato genotypes with
promising traits. Also, selection of hybrid progenies for the expression of desirable agro-
nomic traits often leads to loss of resistance inherited from wild progenitors. The glandular
trichomes of Solanum berthaultii (Hawkes) confer resistance against potato tuber moth
egg-laying and larval mobility (Malakar and Tingey, 2000). This trait appears to have a
great potential, but to date, resistant selections have not been widely adopted.

Genetic transformation with, for example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) genes has opened
new opportunities for pest control (Cañedo et al., 1999). Expression of Bt genes encoding
different proteins (Cry1A(b) and Cry5) conferred resistance to both potato tuber moth
and Andean tuber moth (Jansens et al., 1995; Lagnaoui et al., 2000). Bt-Cry5 Spunta
potato lines were highly resistant to potato tuber moth under field and storage conditions,
with over 90% damage-free tubers (Douches et al., 2004). The same study demonstrated
that potato clone NYL235-4.13 combining glandular trichomes with a Bt-Cry5/gus fusion
construct had field resistance to potato tuber moth infestation. Toxic crystal proteins from
Bt have proved highly effective against potato tuber moth larvae. The challenge is to
manage this transgenic material to avoid selection for resistant moth genotypes and to
preserve Bt insecticides as a tool for managing potato tuber moth in storage where control
is most needed.

Cultural practices can greatly reduce potato tuber moth infestations. Sprinkler irrigation,
deep planting, reshaping planting beds (hilling), preharvest defoliation and prompt harvest
all reduce infestations in tubers entering storage (Shelton and Wyman, 1979; von Arx
et al., 1987). Timely sanitation is effective in control of Andean tuber moth as the pest
survives in crevices and crop residues (Palacios et al., 1999). Modern storage technology
can essentially eliminate losses in storage to potato tuber moth. In Tunisia, producers
were found to benefit most from investments in technologies that reduced marketing
inputs (e.g.
labour, depreciation and interest costs), whereas consumers benefited most
from reduction of losses in storage (Fuglie, 1995).

Exposing male potato tuber moths to substerilizing doses of gamma irradiation has
shown promise for management. In follow-up studies, Saour and Makee (2004) showed
that gamma irradiation induced a high level of sterility and a reduction in female mating
ability and fecundity.

25.2.4 Leafminers

25.2.4.1 Occurrence and damage

Leafminers (Agromyzidae) are important insect pests worldwide. Of greatest economic
importance are the highly polyphagous pea leafminer; vegetable leafminer, Liriomyza
trifolii (Burgess) and serpentine leafminer, Liriomyza sativae (Blanchard) (Parrella, 1987).
These species tend to have overlapping host ranges, and several species may occur within

Insect pests in potato

555

the same field. Liriomyza species attack a wide variety of vegetable and horticultural crops,
including potatoes and many other field and greenhouse crops. Pea leafminer is the most
destructive leafminer on potato, but American serpentine leafminer is an important potato
pest in Africa, from Senegal to Kenya and Mauritius (Bourdouxhe, 1982). Liriomyza
species are morphologically similar and extremely difficult to tell apart. DNA sequence
data of putative pea leafminer populations from the United States and elsewhere suggest
that L. huidobrensis consists of at least two cryptic species (Scheffer, 2000).

Pea leafminer is indigenous to South America but was not considered to be an impor-
tant potato pest there before the 1970s as it was generally held in check by natural
enemies. More than 40 species of endo- and ecto-parasitoids have been reported from
Liriomyza larvae and pupae, but most are not highly host specific (Izhevskiy, 1985).
Pea leafminer populations developed insecticide resistance when exposed to intensive
spraying for tomato leafminer control in coastal locations of Peru and Chile. Spray costs
for pea leafminer became the most expensive component of potato production in the
Cañete Valley, Peru (Cisneros and Mujica, 1999). Insecticide-resistant populations of pea
leafminer since have spread to Europe and Israel (Weintraub and Horowitz, 1995). Pea
leafminer is now present in China, Indonesia and has a foothold in Africa. Distribution
of pea leafminer in China ranges from southern subtropical to northern temperate zones,
but apparently, the species cannot persist through winter in nonsheltered environments
beyond ∼35

N (Chen and Kang, 2004).

(cid:2)

25.2.4.2 Control

Liriomyza pest species have been the subject of management efforts using a variety
of tactics. Pea leafminer control has traditionally depended on chemical insecticides;
however, in many places, leafminer flies show significant levels of resistance to all major
classes of insecticides commonly used against them. In early season while plants are still
actively growing, natural enemies may provide sufficient control. As plant growth slows,
greater levels of protection are required, and selective use of pesticides is often necessary.
In the tropics, potatoes are commonly intercropped with maize, beans or other crops.
By the choice of intercropped species and appropriate agronomic practices, it is possible to
reduce populations of various potato pests. Potato intercropped with wheat, Triticum spp.
(Poacea), is less damaged by pea leafminer because wheat attracts leafminer parasitoids
(Raymundo and Alcázar, 1983). Yellow sticky traps have been used to achieve direct
control of adult pea leafminer in both Asia and South America. In other parts of the
world, sticky traps are used mainly for monitoring purposes. Trapping will reduce fly
populations, but more importantly, when fly populations are low, trapping can convince
farmers that insecticides are not necessary.

Pea leafminer attacks potato shortly after plant emergence. Adult females puncture
the leaves to feed or lay eggs. Eggs are inserted individually on lower leaf surfaces and
hatched within 3 or 4 days. Larvae tunnel into the leaflets making characteristic serpentine
mines. Pea leafminer eggs laid in growing leaves often produce a hypersensitivity reaction
causing many neonate larvae to be unsuccessful in burrowing into the leaf tissue. Tissue
surrounding the encrusted egg starts an abnormal multiplication of cells that push the egg
to the surface exposing them to greater risk of dehydration and predation. Breeding at

556

Radcliffe and Lagnaoui

Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP) resulted in selection of potato genotypes with good
levels of tolerance to leafminer fly infestations, high yields and good processing qualities.
Clone CIP-282 gave high yields in both low elevations and highlands of Peru and when
officially released as ‘Maria Tambena’ was quickly adopted by growers (Mujica and
Cisneros, 1997).

25.3 REGIONAL PESTS

25.3.1 Leafhoppers

Leafhoppers [Cicadellidae (Jassidae)] are abundant in the tropics and subtropics. Repro-
duction is usually sexual, and most species are multivoltine. Eggs are typically inserted
into the main vein or petiole on the underside of leaves. In warm weather, a generation
typically takes about 30 days. The most destructive leafhoppers are those whose feeding
causes ‘burning’ (‘hopperburn’) of foliage (Backus et al., 2005). Among the leafhoppers,
most destructive to potato are Amrasca biguttala biguttala Ishida and Amrasca devastans
Ghauri in India, Pakistan and China, Austroasca virigrisea (Paoli) in Australia, Empoasca
decipiens (Paoli) in Europe, Central Asia and North Africa and potato leafhopper in North
America. Most other leafhopper species cause only mild stippling in potato.

Leafhoppers employ a ‘lacerate-and-flush-feeding’ strategy. Feeding leafhoppers move
their stylets continuously or intermittently, secreting watery saliva, rupturing plant cells
and then ingesting the resulting slurry. Burners tend to make repeated, contiguous, short
duration probes in the vascular bundle, whereas stipplers tend to make fewer probes of
longer duration and mostly in mesophyll-parenchyma cells (Backus et al., 2005).

Potato leafhopper is a consistently important pest in central and eastern North America.
Potato leafhopper overwinters along the Gulf Coast. In spring, flying adults are caught in
updrafts and transported north on upper level airstreams. Northward influxes of leafhop-
pers are associated with southerly winds of 36 h or more duration and precipitation in
the fallout area. These long-distance migrants often arrive before potatoes have emerged.
Significant populations seldom appear on potato until a generation of new adults has
been produced locally on alternative hosts (Flanders and Radcliffe, 1989). For potato
leafhopper, treatment has been recommended if densities exceed 10–30 nymphs per 100
leaves (Johnson and Radcliffe, 1991).

Yield loss in potato can occur before visual symptoms of potato leafhopper damage are
obvious. Damaged plants show large increases in respiration that deplete photosynthates
required for haulm and tuber development. These initial effects are reversible if leafhop-
pers are controlled before leaf tissue is destroyed, but any impairment of photosynthetic
efficiency is irreversible. Hopperburn affects plant biomass accumulation by reducing
green leaf area and efficiency of solar radiation capture. Potato is most susceptible to
damage by leafhopper in early tuber bulking.

25.3.1.1 Phytoplasma transmission by leafhoppers

Certain leafhopper species transmit phytoplasma (Class Mollicutes). Various phyto-
plasma occur on potato, and these are difficult to separate or group. In North America,

Insect pests in potato

557

aster leafhopper, Macrosteles quadrilineatus (fascifrons) Forbes, transmits a phytoplasma
belonging to the aster yellows complex that causes potato purple-top wilt (purple top)
(Banttari et al., 1993). Potato stolbur phytoplasma (aster yellows group), vectored pri-
marily by the planthopper Hyalesthis obsoletus Signoret (Cixiidae), occurs on potato in
southern and central Europe (Cousin and Moreau, 1977). In India, potato marginal flaves-
cence phytoplasma and potato toproll phytoplasma are important leafhopper-vectored
diseases (Khurana et al., 1988). Phytoplasma diseases on potato appear to increase in
importance worldwide. An emerging problem in the Pacific Northwest USA is a ‘purple-
top’ disease caused by a clover proliferation group phytoplasma vectored primarily, but
not exclusively, by beet leafhopper, Circulifer tenellus (Baker) (Crosslin et al., 2005).
Vector relationships are not well known for the phytoplasma on potato, but all appear to
be leafhopper transmitted.

25.3.2 Potato psyllid

Potato psyllid, Bactericerca (Paratrioza) cockerelli (Sulc.) (Psyllidae), occurs throughout
the western United States, especially the Mountain states. Losses caused by potato psyllid
sometimes are catastrophic. The saliva of psyllids is toxicogenic and induces a condi-
tion called psyllid yellows. The primary symptoms diagnostic of this disorder in potato
include stunting, increasing chlorosis, basal cupping and erectness of leaflets, and reddish
colouration of new foliage and aerial tubers (Cranshaw, 1994). Affected plants tend to set
excessive number of tubers, most close to the stem, often misshapen tubers attributed to
internal necrosis and premature sprouting. This pathology has been attributed to disrupted
hormonal regulation of plant growth. Progress of psyllid yellows can be interrupted and
even reversed if psyllid infestations are controlled early. Only the nymphs cause psyllid
yellows. Symptoms are detected with as few as 3–5 nymphs per plant.

Psyllids overwinter as adults in Texas and New Mexico and migrate northward in early
spring. Psyllid adults are attracted to yellow traps. When adults are detected, monitoring
should begin for the nymphs. Nymphs are found mostly on middle to lower leaves.
Control is recommended when nymphs exceed one per 100 sweeps. Psyllids are readily
controlled by most insecticides.

25.3.3 Thrips

Palm (melon) thrips, Thrips palmi Karny (Thripidae), is highly polyphagous, and popula-
tions can build quickly on potato. Both larvae and adults feed gregariously along midribs,
veins and stems, particularly at bud terminals, leaving numerous scars and deformities
and finally killing the plant. Palm thrips was first found in Indonesia in 1925 and has
since spread widely throughout the Pacific. In Indonesia and the Philippines, severe
infestations of palm thrips and Megalurothrips usitatus (Bagnall) have been reported in
lowland potato production. It is likely that palm thrips is present in most countries in
south and southeastern Asia. Palm thrips has been present in the Caribbean region since
1985, and there have been several limited outbreaks in the Netherlands. Neonicotinoid
insecticides are effective but can disrupt natural enemies (Nemoto, 1995).

25.3.4 White grubs

White grubs are larvae of scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae). White grubs are creamy white,
medium to large, with a distinct brown head capsule, C-shaped body with prominent
legs and a slightly enlarged abdomen. Scarabs have long life cycles, typically 1–4 years.
Species that are potato pests cut roots and stems and make large, clean, shallow circular
surface wounds in tubers. Infestations are usually worse when potatoes are planted in
weedy fields or fields previously in sod. White grubs have become increasingly trou-
blesome in Asia and Central America since the phasing out of chlorinated hydrocarbon
insecticides. Major pest genera in India include Anomala spp. and Melolontha spp. In the
Americas, Phyllophaga is the most economically important genus.

25.3.5 Wireworms

Wireworms are the larval stage of click beetles (Elateridae). Wireworm larvae are slender,
yellowish to brown orange, with short legs. The tip of the abdomen is flattened and has
a pair of short hooks. Mature larvae range from 12 to 25 mm in length, depending on
species. Wireworms typically have life cycles of 1–3 years, so it is important to know the
cropping history of a particular field. Wireworms are usually present following pasture,
small grain cereals, maize, beans or weedy fields. Wireworm infestations tend to be spotty
and often reoccur in the same locations within fields for several years. Wireworms feed
on seed pieces in the spring and occasionally damage emerging shoots. Damaged seed
pieces can become secondarily infected with bacteria or fungi and either fail to emerge or
produce weak plants. Later in the summer, wireworms bore into the new tubers, making
a clean, round entry hole, about 2–3 mm in diameter. The tunnel often enters straight
into the tuber and is lined with periderm. Wireworm damage does not reduce yields but
lowers tuber value and can make the crop unmarketable.

There is great local variation in the extent to which wireworm species are important.
Usually, no one wireworm species can be regarded as a key pest, but collectively wireworms
can represent a serious problem (Jansson and Seal, 1994). In many potato-producing
regions, relative importance of the various wireworm species has not been documented.
It is possible to sample for wireworms either by putting soil samples through screens
or by baiting traps with carrot. Unfortunately, action thresholds usually are not based
on empirical data nor are they species specific. Wireworms tend to be worse on light
soils. In dry years, wireworms tend to be more destructive because the larvae will burrow
into tubers seeking moisture. Insecticides applied in-furrow give fair to good control
but seldom are as effective as the broadcast-chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides they
replaced. Treating cereal crops grown in rotation preceding potato can reduce wireworm
populations in potato.

25.3.6 Ladybird beetles

In India, Epilachna beetles (Coccinellidae), e.g.
twenty-eight-spotted potato lady beetle
Henosepilachna (Epilachna) vigintioctopunctata Motschulsky and Henosepilachna ocel-
lata Jadwiszczak and Wegrzynowicz, are important defoliators that often limit successful
potato cultivation. Both adults and grubs skeletonize leaves.

25.3.7 Flea beetles

Flea beetles (Chrysomelidae) are economic pests in the Americas and Asia. In Peru, there
are at least five species important on potato, Epitrix parvula (Fab.), Epitrix subcrinita (Le
Conte), Epitrix ubaquensis Haarold, Epitrix harilana rubia Bech. and Bech. and Epitrix
yanazara Bech. In North America, the most important species are potato flea beetle,
Epitrix cucumeris (Harris), common throughout the eastern half of the continent, and
tuber flea beetle, Epitrix tuberis Gentner, which occurs primarily in the Northwest.

Flea beetles overwinter as adults in or near potato fields. Potato flea beetle has one
generation per year, whereas tuber flea beetle generally has two. Adult flea beetles are
1–2 mm long and feed on foliage, producing numerous minute circular holes. Damage
is most serious on young plants. Heavy flea beetle infestations may cause substantial
yield losses, but flea beetles are usually controlled incidentally by insecticides targeted
against other potato insect pests. Flea beetle-damaged leaves often become desiccated. The
feeding wounds can serve as entry point for potato pathogens, including bacterial diseases
and early blight, Alternaria solani (Ell. and Mart.) Jones and Grout (Pleosporaceae).
Larvae of all flea beetle species feed on roots, stolons and tubers, but most species cause
only superficial injury. Tuber flea beetle makes deep tunnels; one or two larvae can do
enough damage for a tuber to be unmarketable. New adults emerging from the soil may
carry Verticillium wilt, Verticillium dahliae Kleb. (Clavicipitaceae) and Fusarium spp.
(Hypocreaceae). Common scab, Streptomyces scabies (Thaxter) Waksman and Henrici
(Streptomycetaceae), infection is also associated with flea beetle injury.

25.3.8 Andean potato weevils

The Andean potato weevil complex is a group of closely related curculionids attacking
potatoes grown above 2500 m. The most important species are Premnotrypes latitho-
rax (Pierce) limited to Chile, Bolivia and southern Peru, Premnotrypes suturicallus
Kuschel in central Peru and Premnotrypes vorax (Hustache) distributed over the northern
Andes (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and northern Peru) (Alcázar and Cisneros, 1999).
Less abundant species include Premnotrypes fractirostris Marshall, Premnotrypes piercei
Alcalá, Premnotrypes pusillus Kuschel, Premnotrypes sanfordi (Pierce), Premnotrypes
solani Pierce, Premnotrypes solanivorax (Heller), Premnotrypes clivosus Kuschel, Prem-
notrypes zischkai Kuschel, Premnotrypes solaniperda Kuschel and Amitrus jelskyi (Kirsh).
Other potato weevils of economic importance, but primarily in Bolivia, are Rhigopsidius
tucumanus Heller occurring above 2500 m and Phyrdenus muriceus Germar in mesother-
mic valleys.

Adult Andean weevils feed on young potato plants, and severe infestations may com-
pletely denude fields. Life cycles of the three common species differ only in detail. There
is usually one generation per year, except for P. vorax that has two generations per year
in parts of Ecuador and Colombia where potato is produced year round. Eggs are laid
in plant debris. Neonate larvae bore into potato and remain there feeding until ready to
pupate. Larvae leave the tubers to make their pupal cells in the soil where they pass
the winter. P. muriceus also pupates in the soil, but R. tucumanus pupates inside potato
tubers. When rains start, adults emerge and feed mainly on leaves and stems of potato

560

Radcliffe and Lagnaoui

plants. Eggs are laid on potato, weeds or in the soil. In fields not protected by insecticides,
loss of marketable yield can be total (Cálvache, 1986).

No significant sources of host plant resistance have been found in primitive cultivars
or wild potato species. Similarly, there are no known parasitoids, and predators are few
and seemingly ineffective. Management practices are mainly based on cultural control
measures, including selection of clean seed, deep planting, hilling, careful soil cultivation,
border crops (lupine or small grains) and chemical barriers, removal of weed hosts, early
harvest and ditches to protect fields from invasion by migrating adults.

Adult weevils are nocturnal and tend to take refuge under plant debris during the day.
This behaviour is exploited for monitoring and control purposes. Weevils can be monitored
using pit fall traps and insecticides applied upon first capture of adult weevils. However,
the most widely used trapping technique is ‘shelter traps’ baited with insecticide-drenched
potato foliage (Alcázar and Cisneros, 1997). Shelter traps are particularly effective just
prior to the emergence of potato plants in new fields.

As Andean potato weevil larvae leave tubers to pupate, infested tubers can be stored
on plastic sheets to collect emerging larvae that can then be destroyed or fed to chickens.
An entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria brongniartii (Sacc.) (Clavicipitaceae), is mass-
produced as a biopesticide in cottage-type facilities in several Andean communities of
Peru, Bolivia and Colombia (Cisneros and Vera, 2001). Use of B. brongniartii in potato
stores can achieve up to 90% weevil mortality under moist conditions.

25.3.9 Cutworms

Numerous cutworm (Noctuidae) species attack potato. Cutworm larvae are nocturnal,
living just below the ground surface. Larvae can cut the stalks of young growing
plants, with severely infested fields appearing grazed. On more mature plants, cut-
worms can damage tender stems. After tuberization, cutworm damage is largely con-
fined to the tubers. Among the most cosmopolitan and destructive species attacking
potato are Agrotis spp., e.g Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) and Agrotis segetum (Denis and
Schiffermüller).

25.4 INSECT CONTROL TACTICS

Potatoes are grown in most countries of the world and under an extraordinary range of
environmental conditions. Production systems and pest issues vary greatly among and
within geographic regions. This complex of pest problems is dynamic, changing within
and across years. The relative importance of particular pest problems can vary with culti-
var, cultural practices, weather, intended market, storage conditions and other variables.
Given such management complexities, it is understandable that pesticides continue to
play a dominant role in potato pest management. There seems little question that the most
pressing need in potato pest management worldwide is to find ways to reduce the present
dependency on pesticides (Yanggen et al., 2004).

Insect pests in potato

25.4.1 Insecticides

Worldwide, economic return on investment in potato insecticides (1988–1990) was esti-
mated to be about 6:1, but overall effectiveness of crop protection was less than 44%
(Oerke et al., 1994). Effectiveness of crop protection tended to be greatest in production
systems that use insecticides most intensively, e.g. 60% in North America. Estimated
potato yield losses to insects in 1988–1990 were more than 10% higher worldwide than
corresponding estimates 25 years earlier (Cramer, 1967), despite much greater insecticide
inputs in terms of applications per hectare and product cost.

Development of insecticide resistance can severely limit insecticide options. Two key
potato pests, Colorado potato beetle and green peach aphid, rank among the most noto-
rious of all insects for their capacity to develop insecticide resistance, with resistance
reported to 41 and 68 insecticide chemistries, respectively (Whalon et al., 2004). Another
important vector of potato viruses, melon aphid, is reported to have developed resistance
to 39 different insecticides, including methamidophos, the insecticide of choice for green
peach aphid control in many seed potato production systems. The alarming rate at which
insecticide resistance has evolved, the consolidation of agrochemical companies world-
wide and a slowing rate of development of new insecticides are persuasive arguments for
active development and promotion of sound insecticide resistance management (IRM)
programmes.

To slow the development of insecticide resistance, it is desirable to avoid sequential
use of products with the same mode of action that exposes more than one generation of
the target pest to selection. To assist crop professionals practicing IRM, the Insecticide
Resistance Action Committee (IRAC), an interagrochemical company committee whose
mission is to ‘promote the development of resistance management strategies in crop
protection’ (IRAC, 2005), has developed a classification system and tentatively assigned
all insecticides to one of 28 unique groups based on their mode of action. This numbering
system when included on the label for insecticides (fungicide and herbicide labels already
indicate mode of action codes) will make it easier to implement IRM programmes as
practitioners will not have to be conversant in insecticide toxicology to make appropriate
decisions on product rotation.

25.4.2 Host plant resistance

Potato is unique among crop plants in the diversity of its wild relatives. More than 150
species of potato have been described, and many present potentially useful sources of
insect resistance. Insect resistance appears to be a primitive trait in the wild potatoes but is
also characteristic of the most advanced species, whereas susceptibility is characteristic of
cultivated species and their nearest relatives (Flanders et al., 1992). Wild potatoes possess
a wide variety of defence mechanisms that can protect against insects. These include
glandular trichomes (Gregory et al., 1986), foliar and tuber glycoalkaloids (Tingey, 1984)
and a hypersensitivity response (Balbyshev and Lorenzen, 1997).

European workers in the 1930s discovered that resistance to Colorado potato beetle
was associated with presence of foliar glycoalkaloids, as in Solanum chacoense Bitter,
but breeding efforts to exploit this resistance met little success. Two major problems

562

Radcliffe and Lagnaoui

were encountered: levels of tuber glycoalkaloids tended to be highly correlated with
levels in the foliage and resistance always declined in backcrosses. Colorado potato beetle
resistance is now known to be associated with specific glycoalkaloids, especially leptines,
commersonine and dehydrocommersonine (Sinden et al., 1986; Lorenzen et al., 2001),
suggesting that it may be possible to make greater progress.

Breeding for trichome-conferred resistance began at Cornell University in 1977 when
S. berthaultii accessions were crossed with cultivar Hudson. Hybrids have since been
selected with high levels of resistance to Colorado potato beetle and potato leafhopper.
When the Cornell University potato-breeding programme released an advanced breeding
line, NYL235-4, it was said to be the first near cultivar quality insect-resistant potato
clone developed by traditional plant breeding (Plaisted et al., 1992). In 1992, CIP was
awarded the King Baudouin International Agricultural Research Award for ‘innovative
research in integrated pest management’ and the creation of a hybrid potato population
(the ‘hairy potato’) with resistance to a range of insect pests.

25.4.3 Biological control

Despite the extensive research that has been done on insect pests of potato, comparatively
scant attention has been given to exploiting natural enemies and microbial agents. The
biological control information available has in only a few instances been integrated into
successful pest management strategies. Intuitively, it might seem unlikely that biological
control agents could be effective given the intensive use of pesticides in potato production.
However, the tremendous outbreaks of pests, such as aphids, leafminers, spider mites and
thrips occasionally induced by inappropriate use of pesticides provide indirect evidence
of the importance of natural enemies. Future success with biological control for potato
insect control is likely to depend on finding ways that insecticides can be used selectively.

25.5 CONCLUSIONS

With each passing year, potato pest management becomes more sophisticated. Consid-
erable progress has been made in understanding pest biology and ecology and applying
this knowledge to management of the crop. Examples include establishment of economic
thresholds for key pests, development of strategies for managing insecticide resistance,
increased understanding and quantification of multiple pest interactions and elucidation
of vector–virus relationships.

Integrated pest management (IPM) has been defined variously, but the common theme
is that reliance on pesticides should be reduced by use of alternative control measures
substituting a coordinated, systems approach. For potato, IPM measures may include use
of resistant or tolerant varieties, introduction or enhancement of natural enemies, cultural
manipulations of the crop and pest environment and careful selection and timing of chem-
ical applications (Cisneros, 1984). The argument is often advanced that in developing
countries there usually is not enough information available on the various components to
formulate IPM programmes. A counterpoint to that argument is that IPM implementation
efforts often reveal knowledge gaps that in turn serve to focus research resources where

Insect pests in potato

563

they are most needed. Integrated pest management in the tropics will become reality
only when the component technologies are taken by farmers and adapted to their condi-
tions (Morse and Buhler, 1997). Sponsored pest surveys and on-farm research can play
important roles in facilitating this process. National and international programmes should
encourage such activities (Ezeta, 1988). Farmers’ perceptions and knowledge of pests
are an important source of information and can be very useful in formulating IPM pro-
grammes. There will always be need for additional research. However, in most situations,
considerable knowledge of pest management components already exists, and practical
IPM programmes at some level of complexity already are in place or could be formulated.
Modifications to Integrated Post Management programmes to incorporate more or better
information and to integrate more complex interactions can proceed as the knowledge
base expands.

The Nematode Parasites of Potato

Numerous nematodes are able to feed and to reproduce on potato. The majority
withdraw nutrients from cells in the epidermis of the roots, without
inducing any
measurable damage. However, some of these nematodes, for example Trichodorus and
Paratrichodorus species, are extremely noxious, firstly because their saliva is toxic to
the roots and secondly because they transmit viruses. Some species penetrate and migrate
into the roots, destroying the cells by removing the cytoplasm. Some nematodes may
cause little direct damage but may facilitate secondary infections with fungi, which
can be extremely destructive. Some genera are highly specialized and induce cellular
changes resulting in feeding sites that are called giant cells for the genera Nacobbus and
Meloidogyne and syncytia for the genus Globodera. The first two genera are extremely
polyphagous, whereas Globodera species are highly specific for Solanaceous species. The
last type of nematode causing damage in potato is the polyphagous species, Ditylenchus
destructor, which directly damages the tubers by causing a specific dry decay. All these
principal genera have specific parasitic methods (Fig. 26.1) and belong to different classes
in the phylogenetic tree of the Nematoda (Baldwin et al., 2004).

26.1

POTATO CYST NEMATODES (GLOBODERA ROSTOCHIENSIS
AND GLOBODERA PALLIDA)

Among the four species of Globodera that develop on Solanaceous species, G. rostochiensis,
G. pallida, G. tabacum and G. mexicana, only the first two develop on potato. Present in
Central and North America, G. tabacum spreads to Europe (France and Italy) where it may
be sympatric with G. rostochiensis and G. pallida. G. mexicana is found only in Mexico.
Listed as quarantine pests in almost all countries, G. rostochiensis and G. pallida are specific
parasites of the Solanaceae. It is assumed that these species originate from South America
where G. pallida is found more to the North of Lake Titicaca, whereas G. rostochiensis is
found more to the South. They were probably introduced into Europe during the nineteenth
century where they multiplied and have subsequently been spread all around the world with
infested tubers. They are known to be present in North, Central and South America, North and
South Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The only exceptions are the warm tropical
areas. The European populations of G. pallida are likely to have originated from the south of
Peru (Picard, 2005).

Characterization of G. rostochiensis and G. pallida based on morphological and
morphometric traits of the juveniles and cysts is difficult and only feasible for specialists.
Monoclonal antibodies recognizing species-specific thermostable proteins are used as
a routine method in the Netherlands to distinguish the two species (Schots et al.,
1989, 1992). Burrows (1990) and Fullaondo et al. (1999) developed diagnostic protocols
using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify species-specific DNA sequences.
In order to differentiate these two species from each other and from the related species
G. tabacum and G. mexicana, Thiéry and Mugniéry (1996) developed a PCR-RFLP
(Restriction Fagment Length Polymorphism) methodology. Marshall and Crawford (1992)
and Mulholland et al. (1996) differentiated G. pallida from G. rostochiensis by a multi-
plex PCR diagnostics. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) may be used to distinguish
different populations of G. rostochiensis (Bakker and Gommers, 1982).

All these species reproduce by obligate amphimixis. However, whatever the criteria

used, their physiological, biochemical or molecular variability is extremely high.

26.1.1 Host range

G. rostochiensis and G. pallida have the same host range. They are able to develop
on all tuberous species of Solanum. Among the cultivated plants, they freely develop
on Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) and are able to reproduce on Solanum melongena

(egg-plant). Among the wild Solanaceae, bittersweet (Solanum dulcamara) is a fairly good
host, but the nightshade Solanum nigrum allows the juveniles to hatch and to penetrate
into the roots but not to develop. Stelter (1971) gives a list of putative hosts. In Table 26.1,
common and differential hosts of the four species of Globodera are given. It is shown
that the two potato cyst-nematode species have the same host range. This specificity is
due to two main factors. The first is that only the root exudates of Solanaceous plants
are able to induce the juveniles to hatch from the cysts. But there also exists a strong
interaction between type of exudates and species of Globodera, which partly explains
this specificity (Table 26.2). So, egg-plant is never attacked in natural conditions by the
two potato cyst nematodes, although artificially hatched juveniles penetrate and develop
freely on this plant. The second factor is a result of the specific recognition of the roots
by the hatched juveniles because of specific carbohydrate-binding lectins. The ability of
both G. rostochiensis and G. pallida to penetrate the roots of potato, tomato and egg-plant
is extremely strong, whereas it is extremely low in roots of pepper. In all cases, the
penetration of juveniles occurs in the root zone of elongation and in the area where there
is formation of auxiliary rootlets.

26.1.2 Diseases

Mugniéry and Phillips

The growth of attacked plants is retarded. In the field, it is common to observe foci
of smaller plants, which correspond with areas having high nematode densities. The
symptoms are not specific to nematode damage and may be confused with many other
causes, such as soil structure, effects of herbicides, lack of fertilizers and other biotic or
abiotic stress factors. The consequence of nematode attack is that tuber yield losses are
sustained as a result of a reduction in the size of tubers and therefore total weight per
hectare. Different mathematical models describing the relationship between the reduction
of the yield and the density of the soil population of nematodes before planting have
been described (Seinhorst, 1965; Oostenbrink, 1966; Elston et al., 1991). Some cultivars
are more or less tolerant, that is to say that at similar levels of nematode population
density some cultivars are damaged more than others irrespective of their resistance. Some
tolerant cultivars such as cultivar Cara develop a very large leaf canopy that enables the
crop to achieve 100% ground cover and thus maximum light interception despite damage
(Trudgill et al., 1990). Consequently, the amount of actual yield loss is not as high as that
if light interception is reduced. Commercial yield is also less affected in cultivars that
produce few but very large tubers. Qualitative damage to the tuber skin can also occur and
is seen as numerous small spots on the tuber surface due to penetration of juveniles into
the epidermis of potato cyst nematodes (Hide and Read, 1991), mainly due to G. pallida
(Fig. 26.2).

As for practically all phytoparasitic nematodes, the amount of disease is propor-
tional to the log of the initial population density expressed as the number of sec-
ond stage juveniles (J2s) per gram of soil. Total plant yield reduction cannot be
detected below a certain minimum density called the tolerance threshold. Above this
threshold, the yield reduction may be considered as proportional to the log (J2/g)
until a yield minimum lower than the asymptote is reached. Many models have been
developed: sigmoid (Seinhorst, 1965), linear (Oostenbrink, 1966) and inverse linear
(Elston et al., 1991). The general slope of the curves may be modified by many fac-
tors. In general, all agronomic factors favourable to the crop (water supply, fertiliz-
ers, etc.) reduce the nematode damage. Some cultivars as Multa possess a tolerance
threshold higher than others, whereas other cultivars are characterized by having a
high relative minimum yield. Finally, some potato cyst populations are more or less
pathogenic.

Association with fungi such as Verticillium dalhiae (Harrison, 1970) or Rhizoc-
tonia solani (Grainger and Clark, 1963) may increase the amount of damage. The
wilt due to V. dalhiae appears sooner than it otherwise would in the presence of
G. rostochiensis.

Quarantine regulations are of essential economic importance for

In
most countries, potato seed production is strictly forbidden on infested land. This
prohibition is generally maintained for 5–7 years. All potato seed has to be cer-
tified to have been produced from non-infested fields, and a phytosanitary pass-
port must accompany all shipping. For consumption and ware potatoes, a potato
crop may be authorized if soil disinfection, resistant cultivars or early harvest are
practised.

26.1.3 Biology

The J2 hatch and mechanically penetrate the elongation zone of the roots. They migrate into
the roots to the vascular vessels. With their stylet, they pierce a cell and induce a syncytium
that is characterized by thickened cell walls, a dense cytoplasm, a reduced vacuole and mul-
tilobate nuclei (Fig. 26.3A). This syncytium, which may be formed from up to 15 cells, acts
as a nurse cell providing a metabolic sink from which the nematode feeds and develops.

Mugniéry and Phillips

Induction and maintenance of such syncytia is presumed to be regulated by proteins
produced by the nematode. Some enzymes have been detected, but the real mechanism
of induction is as yet unknown. Once the syncytium has been induced, the J2 looses its
mobility and grows through three successive moults [third stage juveniles (J3s), fourth
stage juveniles (J4s) and adult]. Sexual determination is under the influence of envi-
ronmental factors and is apparent at the J4 stage. Factors unfavourable to syncytium
development and thus nematode development result in a change in sex ratio with an
increase in the production of males. The factors that affect this are high densities of nema-
todes in the roots resulting in high rates of competition and damage and the production
of syncytia in small lateral roots where development is limited by space and in resistant
plants where syncytial development is restricted by the resistance response.

On reaching J4, the immature female swells and bursts through the root epidermis.
Finally, the females are visible on the root surface as small spheres (Ø 500–750 (cid:3)), white
for G. pallida and yellow to golden for G. rostochiensis (Fig. 26.3B). Adult males emerge
from the roots and are attracted to females by the female cuticle pheromones. After copula-
tion, the females lay numerous eggs inside their uterus and subsequently die. The female’s
cuticle darkens and becomes a cyst containing up to 1000 eggs. Embryogenesis occurs
inside the female/cyst: a first moult occurs inside the chorion, producing a new J2 that
enters into diapause. At 20
C, the life cycle needs 15 days from penetration to copulation
and 16 days for embryogenesis. In the natural conditions of Western Europe, a generation
requires about 3 months from potato planting to the formation of cysts. Generally, one
generation occurs per potato crop, but a partial second one is observed on late potatoes.
After harvest, the cysts remain in the soil. The diapause, generally stronger for
G. rostochiensis than for G. pallida, requires cold conditions for it to be broken but shows
large variability among populations. Some populations are able to develop on volunteers
that may start to grow from September and achieve their cycle during winter. If a second
potato crop is grown in the same season, i.e. in July after the harvest of a crop in June,
the new J2s of some populations are able to hatch immediately while others do not.

26.1.4 Dormant stage

The cyst protects the eggs and J2s for many years. In the absence of potatoes, the J2s
remain alive in the cysts. Annually, a small proportion hatch freely and die in the soil.
The climatic conditions may act to decrease the survival of the J2. Adverse conditions are
mainly high temperatures and soil dryness. Generally, the annual decline has been found
to be extremely variable. In Ireland, the Plant Protection Service considers an annual
decline not more than 10%. In Brittany, this percentage reaches 18%, whereas in the
South of France, it is about 50%. In North Algeria, it was estimated as 80%. In Agadir
(South Morocco), the annual decline of 95% balances exactly the annual multiplication
on the potato crop (Schlüter, 1976).

The cysts are an unusual means of dissemination. Very light, they can be spread locally
by water, wind, machinery (wheels) and man (shoes) as well as in soil attached to potato
tubers. On a larger scale, they accompany potato seeds from country to country and from
continent to continent. These characteristics explain the very wide distribution of these
species despite the very severe quarantine regulations.

26.2 ROOT-KNOT NEMATODES (MELOIDOGYNE SPP.)

In contrast to the potato cyst nematodes, root-knot nematodes are extremely polyphagous.
They are able to develop on thousands of species, cultivated or wild, belonging to all
botanical families. Approximately 80 species of Meloidogyne have been described, of
which only a few are pathogenic on potato. In warm and tropical areas, as well as in
glasshouses, the economically important species are Meloidogyne incognita, M. arenaria,
M. javanica and M. mayaguensis, whereas in temperate areas, the most important species
are M. hapla, M. chitwoodi and M. fallax.

Specific identification of Meloidogyne species is extremely difficult. Various criteria
have been used including the host range (Hartman and Sasser, 1985), the morphology
of females, males and juveniles (Jepson, 1983; Eisenback, 1985;), isoenzyme patterns of
soluble proteins from females (Esbenshade and Triantaphyllou, 1985) and specific PCR
markers (Zijlstra, 2000; Zijlstra et al., 2000; Wishart et al., 2002). No system exists other
than biological host range tests to differentiate pathotypes (Table 26.3) and biological
races (Table 26.4).

Genetically, M. incognita, M. arenaria and M. javanica are a very closely related group
and more distantly related to M. mayaguensis, M. hapla and the closely related group of
M. chitwoodi and M. fallax.

Reproduction of the tropical species and of the race B of M. hapla is by mitotic
parthenogenesis, with between 41 and 48 chromosomes. The other species reproduce
by facultative meiotic parthenogenesis and have between 14 and 18 chromosomes.
This means that males are potentially able, but probably only in a small proportion
of cases, to contribute to the genetic flow (Triantaphyllou, 1985). As a consequence,
the variability, worldwide, of the tropical species is extremely small in contrast to the
temperate species.

26.2.1 Disease

All Meloidogyne species induce galls on the root system. On potato, they are able to
induce galls on tubers (Fig. 26.4A). The presence of Meloidogyne in the roots limits
the water supply of the plants, disrupts their physiology and, as a direct consequence,
decreases yield. Galled tubers are not marketable. When tubers are used for processing,
e.g. for French fry production, the presence of females, mainly of M. chitwoodi, on the
tubers leads to holes reducing quality and can result in the rejection of a whole crop
(Fig. 26.4B).

Yield reduction is correlated with the initial density of nematodes before planting.
Disease on the tubers tends to be more correlated to the soil temperature, which influences
the number of generations and then the number of juveniles present at tuber induction.
Disease symptoms on tubers can be very variable (Griffin, 1985; Pinkerton et al., 1991).
Disease may increase when soil fungi are present. This is the case with Streptomyces
scabies (Mehiar et al., 1984) and with R. solani (Scholte and s’Jacob, 1990). The inter-
action with the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum has been demonstrated for tomato but
is not so clear with potato.

26.2.2 Biology

In contrast to Globodera, no real resting or dormant stage exists. All eggs are deposited in
an external gelatinous matrix, in which the embryos develop rapidly to hatch at the J2 stage
whereupon they invade the roots. Mechanical and biochemical penetration occurs in the
elongation zone of a growing root. Intercellular migration, facilitated by the breakdown
of the intercellular membrane, takes place through the cortical cells to the root apex at
which point the J2s turn round and migrate back up the root deep inside the vascular
cylinder (Wyss et al., 1992). The J2s stop and pierce up to 6–7 adjacent cells that are
then induced to form the giant cells from which the nematode feeds.

Fig. 26.5. Giant cells (A) and root galls in Petri dish (B) induced by Meloidogyne incognita in a susceptible
potato genotype.

In each one, the cell walls thicken, the vacuole disappears, the cytoplasm becomes
extremely dense and nuclear division occurs without cell wall formation (Fig. 26.5A).
Around these nurse cells, the adjacent cells divide rapidly, which results in the formation
of a root gall (Fig. 26.5B). Three moults occur and the mature female starts to deposit eggs
outside the root if the gall is small, inside the roots if the gall is large and in the tubers.

Sex determination is strictly determined by environmental factors. Males are produced
under unfavourable conditions. Again in contrast to Globodera, reversal of sex is possible
throughout the developmental cycle, producing normal males with one testis, males with
two testes or with two testes and a vestigial vulva when unfavourable factors act during the
third or the fourth stage. Males of meiotic species may mate and participate in producing
the new generation.

(cid:2)

The number of annual generations depends on the temperature. At 20

C, the time
taken from penetration to the deposit of the first eggs is about 40 days for M. chitwoodi
and 30 days for M. incognita. In glasshouses and in tropical countries, three to four
annual generations may be observed. In temperate areas, M. chitwoodi may produce three
generations on late potatoes.

Some tropical populations, mainly those of the Sahelian area, have an embryonic
diapause (de Guiran, 1979). Eggs enter diapause at an early stage and remain viable
during the dry season.

In the stored tubers, all tropical species develop and produce multiple generations. This

has not been observed with M. chitwoodi and M. fallax.

578

26.2.3 Spread

Mugniéry and Phillips

Meloidogyne species are spread over short distances by water and wind. Long-distance
spread is facilitated by exchange of contaminated soil, root-stocks and tubers. In Europe,
M. chitwoodi and M. fallax are listed as quarantine pests on potato. That means that
tuber seeds must be certified free of these species. It is essential to keep in mind that
in case of a low infestation, without any symptoms on tubers, these nematodes are quite
undetectable. This means also that, in Europe, root-stocks, ornamental species, etc. in
infested soil could enable undetected spread of these species.

26.3 THE FALSE ROOT-KNOT NEMATODE NACOBBUS ABERRANS

This species (or this species complex) originates from America. Some populations orig-
inating from North America develop on sugar beet. The populations originating from
South America develop on potatoes. Named ‘El Rosario’ by the Andean farmers, it dam-
ages potato crops in the Peruvian, Bolivian and Argentinean mountains from 2000 m
above sea level. The populations found at lower altitudes do not develop on potatoes and
are mainly found on tomatoes. It was introduced into Russia through the Netherlands
and Finland but disappeared later. This species is listed on the European quarantine list.
A PCR diagnosis has been described, which is able to recognize all the South American
populations (Anthoine and Mugniéry, 2005).

26.3.1 Host range

Nacobbus aberrans is extremely polyphagous. Among the cultivated plants, it may be
found on potato, tomato, sugar beet, carrot, lettuce, spinach, pepper and cucumber.
Numerous wild species are hosts, among them Chenopodium album and Amaranthus
hybridus. Other hosts, such as Brassica campestris and Erodium cicutarium, are hosts in
the Central Peruvian Mountains but not in the Altiplano of Puno (Gomez Tovar, 1973).
Physiological races have been described (Manzanilla-López et al., 2002) according to
their ability to complete their cycle on differential hosts (Table 26.5). These races, all
amphimictic, are able to interbreed and to give viable and fertile progenies. Reid et al.
(2003) suggested the existence of a species complex and advocated separating N. aberrans
into three species.

The nematode parasites of potato

579

26.3.2 Disease

N. aberrans may be considered as the most damaging nematode of the potato in the high
Andes. The symptoms are typically the development on the root system of numerous
small and spherical galls, very often accompanied by small rootlets (Fig. 26.6). Reduction
of yield may reach up to 60–90% (Gomez Tovar, 1973).

26.3.3 Biology

The biology of this species is extremely complex and partly unknown. The J2s penetrate
everywhere along the root. They migrate into the cortex where they create a large cavity
in which they develop to the pre-adult stage. The cells around the cavity are extremely
enlarged, with a dense cytoplasm, and contain numerous starch particles. The internal cells
are close to the pericycle and the vascular vessels (Fig. 26.7). The form and distribution
of the starch particles depend on the host and nematode race.

On potato, the pre-adult stages enter a strong diapause. The occurrence of this is
rather uncommon and is characterized by nematodes having a black colouration, showing
no movement and with their internal organs difficult to distinguish. This stage may be
encountered in soil and dry roots. Cold conditions are necessary to break the diapause.
After winter, the pre-adult stage becomes male or pre-female. The pre-females penetrate
into the roots and induce a giant cell. This giant cell is characterized by a dense cytoplasm,
hypertrophied nuclei and nucleoli with adjacent cells storing numerous starch particles
(Manzanilla-Lopéz et al., 2002). The females enlarge while at the same time the cortical
and vascular systems show hypertrophy resulting in gall formation. With the shape of an
elongate lemon, the female remains embedded in the root, except for its posterior part.
After mating, eggs are deposited in an external gelatinous matrix where embryogenesis
occurs. Up to 500 J2s are produced, which then hatch, though not all of them immediately.
However, a proportion of the eggs is able to stop their development at the morula stage.
The hatched J2s penetrate the roots, but in the absence of host plants, they are able to
survive for a long time. At 25
C.
The whole cycle requires 37–48 days at 22–24

C, embryogenesis takes 9–10 days and 51 days at 15

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

Whatever the race, the J2s are able to develop to the pre-adult stage. The race specificity
is measurable only at the adult stage. The tomato race pre-female does not penetrate
potato roots.

26.3.4 Spread

This nematode is mainly spread in infested tubers. All the juvenile stages are able to
penetrate the developing tubers and develop just under the epidermis. During storage, the
majority of the nematodes found in tubers are J2 and J3, seldom females. In Argentina,
infested seed tubers, produced in the mountains, are mainly transported to the Pampas,
i.e. where the tomato race occurs. Despite this fact, the potato race has been unable to
establish at low altitudes.

26.4 VIRUS VECTOR NEMATODES (TRICHODORUS SPP.)

Numerous species of the genera Trichodorus and Paratrichodorus, belonging to the
Dorylaimidae, feed on potato roots. When population densities are high, they can cause
damage to the root system by inhibiting growth.

However, their main damaging effect on potato is due to their ability to transmit
tobacco rattle virus (TRV), with the typical symptoms of a cork ring in the tuber flesh.
According to Decraemer (1991), the main species are Trichodorus primitivus, mainly
found in Europe but also found in the USA and New Zealand; T. similis, a European
species, found in Michigan; T. viruliferus, found in Europe and in Florida; Paratri-
chodorus minor, worldwide species; P. pachydermus, a European species, found in Canada
and in the Northwest of the USA and P. teres, a European species, found in South Africa
and in Oregon. All these species are parasites in temperate climates, except P. minor.

The nematode parasites of potato

581

They live preferentially in sandy soils though, where they can colonize all the arable soil.
Each species lives in the soil at its own preferred depth with some living as far as 70 cm
below the soil surface.

26.4.1 Disease

The nematodes ingest viral particles when feeding on the roots. The attachment of the
particles on the inner part of the oesophageal lumen and viral transmission are specific
for the nematode species and the isolates of TRV (Brown et al., 1989a).

If the population level is low, damage is only visible on tuber slices. In case of
heavy infestation, the potato skin may appear cracked, and the tuber symptoms may be
confused with those of mop top viruses (Fig. 26.8). When virus-infected potato plants
are growing at low temperatures, necrotic striations are visible on leaves, veins and
stems (Joubert and Dalmasso, 1974). Some cultivars are relatively tolerant and show few
symptoms (Dale et al., 2004).

There is no direct relationship between the density of Trichodorus and Paratrichodorus
and the percentage of infected tubers (Fritzsche et al., 1986). If the nematodes are not
viruliferous and if the seed tubers and other plants in the same soil are virus free, then
the only disease will be the direct nematode damage to the roots, which can reduce yield.

26.4.2 Biology

Except T. primitivus, all species prefer very sandy soils. They are extremely susceptible
to desiccation and migrate only to near the soil surface during rainfall or other favourable
moisture conditions. The majority of species are amphimictic: the eggs are deposited in
soil and hatching occurs without diapause. The newly hatched juveniles are infective and
may survive for up to a year.

All these species are highly polyphagous and can feed on cultivated plants, such as
potato, sugar beet, cauliflower, clover, alfalfa, pea, barley, oats, maize, tobacco and carrot.
They are also able to feed and reproduce on numerous weeds, and the population densities
are often extremely high in grassland.

26.5 THE ROOT LESION NEMATODES (PRATYLENCHUS SPP.)

Numerous species of the genus Pratylenchus, mainly P. coffeae, P. scribneri, P. brachyu-
rus, P. penetrans and P. neglectus, feed and reproduce on potato roots and may be
responsible for damage, especially in the USA. Their identification, mainly based on mor-
phological characters, is difficult. All these species, among 13 others, may be identified by
PCR-RFLP of the ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) region (Waeyenberge et al., 2000).

26.5.1 Disease

In case of a heavy soil infestation, potato growth and consequently total tuber yield
may be strongly adversely affected. Depending on the environmental and soil conditions,
yield reduction may reach 19% (Olthof, 1990). Furthermore, the presence of multiple
pimples on the tuber surface, mainly attributed to P. scribneri, depreciates the product
that becomes unmarketable.

The most damaging effects seem to be due to fungal interactions. The early dying of
potato crops in the USA is attributed to the interactions between Verticillium dahliae and
P. penetrans (Kotcon et al., 1985) or with P. neglectus (Scholte and s’Jacob, 1990).

26.5.2 Biology

All the above species of Pratylenchus are polyphagous. Juveniles and adults penetrate
into the roots without any preferential locus. They feed on the cortical cells and migrate
in the roots, destroying cell after cell. Necrotic lesions appear along the roots and are
visible in case of high infestation levels that may reach as high as 30,000 nematodes per
gram of root.

Egg laying occurs either inside the root or in the soil. As the root system becomes
invaded by soil microorganisms, it becomes unfavourable for Pratylenchus. They leave
the roots and migrate to the rhizosphere. After crop harvest, they survive in the soil,
in the remaining root debris or feed on weeds. During winter, population decline varies
between 15 and 86% (MacGuidwin and Forage, 1991). This winter decline is generally
insufficient to decrease population levels to a point at which in the following season
potato or other host plants can be grown without risks.

26.6

DITYLENCHUS DESTRUCTOR AND DITYLENCHUS DIPSACI

The genus Ditylenchus consists of about 80 species with a range of food sources includ-
ing fungi and plants, with some species being both plant parasitic and mycophagous.
Among them, two species are extremely polyphagous, namely Ditylenchus dipsaci and
D. destructor, and able to damage potatoes. D. dipsaci develops mainly in stems and
leaves, whereas D. destructor develops only in underground organs. Correct identification,
mainly based on morphological traits, is important but difficult (Viscardi and Brzeski,
1993). Molecular tools are not yet available to distinguish all the known species (Wendt
et al., 1994).

The nematode parasites of potato

583

D. dipsaci is an occasional parasite of aerial parts of the potato. In tubers, it may be
found in the presence of Phoma exigua var. foveata. The growth of potato is reduced,
the leaves remain small and the stems become thickened. Brown pustules are visible
on attacked tubers. This type of infection is exceptional and has been observed in the
Netherlands, Russia and Romania.

D. destructor is much more serious and a frequent pest on potato. It has been observed
in Europe, (mainly in Russia), Asia (Iran, Pakistan, China and Japan), America (Canada,
USA and Peru), New Zealand and South Africa. In Europe, it is listed as a quarantine
pest on potato and bulbs.

26.6.1 Host range

D. destructor is able to cause diseases on numerous cultivated plants, including potato,
sugar beet, carrot, hop and rhubarb. It is also able to multiply on an extremely large
number of cultivated plants (sweet potato, lupin, clover, tomato, wheat, barley, etc.) and
weeds but without disease symptoms. In the laboratory, it can be multiplied on fungi, but
it is not clear whether it can survive on fungi in natural conditions.

26.6.2 Disease

D. destructor penetrates directly into the tubers through the stolons, wounds and eyes. The
first symptoms are initially only visible on the tubers where on the skin small translucent
spots are seen. Later, these spots darken, enlarge, coalesce and the tuber skin cracks.
Finally the typical symptom is a dry rot (Fig. 26.9).

Fig. 26.9. Dry decay caused by Ditylenchus destructor.

584

Mugniéry and Phillips

Very often, microorganisms such as fungi – Fusarium sp. (Rojankovskii and Ciuera,
1986) – and bacteria – Clavibacter sepedonicus, Erwinia atroseptica, Erwinia carotovora
(Polozhenets, 1984) – colonize the infected tubers, increasing the disease. Cold conditions
during storage limit the aggravation of diseases.

26.6.3 Biology

During winter, D. destructor stays in the soil and remaining roots as juveniles and
eggs (Andersson, 1971). It does not survive temperatures below 4(cid:4)5
C. In a host plant,
C. Its thermal optimum is
cultivated or not, its generation time is less than a month at 20
C as minimum and maximum. In natural conditions,
between 20 and 27
the annual number of generations may be six to nine.

During tuber storage, it continues its cycle with a rate of multiplication of about 6.
Curiously, these nematodes are unable to multiply on carrot, beet and onion during storage
(Ivanova, 1975).

26.7 CONTROL

26.7.1 Prophylaxis

The key point is to avoid infestation of healthy areas and where they already exist to avoid
the introduction of new populations. This last point is extremely important to consider
for potato cyst nematodes, characterized by a large gene pool: the introduction of new
genotypes in an infested area may increase the heterogeneity with regard to virulence,
which may cause serious problems to control of nematode populations by means of
resistant cultivars. The first step in avoiding spread and infestation is to use only certified
seed tubers, accompanied by a phytosanitary passport. This passport certifies that the
shipment is free of quarantine nematodes and/or that the tubers originate from soil in
which, after official analyses, nematodes could not be detected. Despite the phytosanitary
passport, it is extremely important that the grower themselves ensure that the seed tubers
meet high phytosanitary standards. Tubers may be disinfected using sodium hypochlorite,
for example, in order to destroy the Globodera cysts (Sarakoski, 1977) or by ethoprophos
against N. aberrans (Costilla and Basco, 1985). In the areas where potato nematodes
are known to be present, the publication of infested farms should be available to avoid
spread, e.g. by exchange of infested soil from different fields or on machinery that is
lent or hired. Within a farm, because of the risk of carrying infested soil on cultivation
machinery, it is highly recommended to plough the uninfected fields first followed by
the fields that may be or are known to be infested. Following cultivation of the latter, all
machinery should be cleaned.

Rotation and control of volunteers are probably the most efficient preventative methods
that can be used against the monophagous potato cyst nematodes. In case of accidental
introduction of cysts of Globodera, it prevents the population from increasing if no host is
present. When light infestations are present, growing seasons without a suitable host will
limit the build-up of the population both to the detection level and to the point at which

The nematode parasites of potato

the Southern root-knot nematodes (M.

the tolerance threshold is reached. As mentioned above, the length of an effective rotation
will depend on the climatic conditions. It is generally recognized that a minimum period of
7 years without a potato crop is required, but this duration may be shortened under warm
conditions or if resistant varieties and soil disinfestation are included as part of the control
strategy. The efficiency of rotation sensu stricto is much more questionable against all the
other polyphagous species because of their large host range. In these cases, the farmers
will incorporate in the rotation cultivated plants that are a non-host or, better, resistant.
incognita, M. arenaria and
M. javanica), non-hosts, such as cereals, are grown. In Europe, where only race 1 of
M. chitwoodi is found, 1 year of alfalfa greatly lowers the Meloidogyne population.
Against these two types of Meloidogyne, resistant cultivars may be used, like, respec-
tively, the Mi tomato and some fodder radishes. Growers need to be aware that some
cultivated crops, while suffering no noticeable damage, are in fact hosts. Examples of
these are pea for D. dipsaci and wheat for M. chitwoodi and M. fallax. In contrast, some
crop rotations are extremely efficient even when the intermediate plants are considered as
good hosts. For instance, D. destructor seems not to produce symptoms on potato when
grown following a carrot, lupin or buckwheat crop. Three or four years rotations with
rye, alfalfa and rye-grass result in 70–100% decrease of the diseases (Andersson, 1971).
Weed control is another crucial factor to consider. Firstly, because they allow the
multiplication of polyphagous species, such as Meloidogyne, N. aberrans, Ditylenchus
and Pratylenchus, and consequently reduce the positive effect of the rotation. Secondly,
many of them are hosts of TRV on which the different species of Trichodorus are able
to feed and recover the viral particles.

26.7.2 Cultural methods

Three main types of cultural methods for control may be distinguished. The first is
to obtain the maximum vigour of the plants in order that they are able to obviate the
damaging effects of nematode attack. Increasing the levels of soil fertilization may mask
the effect of the nematodes, and heavy dressing of nitrogen is generally used to balance
the decrease of the yield. Although this strategy may result in little or no yield loss, it
has the consequence that unless the cultivar used is resistant, there will be a higher rate
of nematode reproduction as larger amounts of roots will be available for colonization.
Fertilizers may in certain cases act directly or indirectly on the nematodes themselves.
It has been reported that there may be a possible lethal effect of calcium ammonium
nitrate on the juveniles of D. destructor (Sepselev and Glez, 1973). Soil pH can affect
populations of P. penetrans that are higher in acidic soils than in basic ones. Increasing
the pH by liming may be a possibility (1) to allow the potatoes to grow in more favourable
pH conditions, (2) to reduce nematode populations and (3) to attenuate the damage,
when they are present alone or in association with Verticillium (de Pelsmaeker and
Coomans, 1987).

The second type is aimed at decreasing the soil population before growing potatoes.
Deep ploughing, mainly during summer, can greatly reduce the soil populations of Tri-
chodorus sp. nematodes, which are extremely susceptible to desiccation. Intercropping
with nematicidal plants has been advocated as a means of decreasing the soil populations.

586

Mugniéry and Phillips

Against the polyphagous species of Pratylenchus, Meloidogyne and Trichodorus, numer-
ous plants have been evaluated for their nematicide activities and reviewed by Gommers
(1973). Among them, the best known plant is the marigold with three species Tagetes
minuta, T. patula and T. erecta. Heterocyclic sulphur-containing molecules occur in their
roots and are thought to be toxic to the nematodes. Compounds such as alpha-terthienyl
accumulate in nematodes that have penetrated the roots. After 2–3 months of cultiva-
tion followed by burying the aerial parts, decreases in populations of Pratylenchus and
Meloidogyne may reach 70–95% (Lung et al., 1997). It is important to note that the
efficiency increases with the length of cultivation.

The third type Manipulating the potato plants directly which can have a significant
effect on the nematode populations. To control Globodera spp., harvesting the crop before
female maturity may result in a huge decrease of the population. Using the potato as trap-
crop may be valuable (1) in seed production areas in order to avoid any new generation
of the nematodes to develop by destruction of the plants at mating time (Mugniéry and
Balandras, 1984) and (2) in early potato crops when harvest is done during the period
of nematode embryogenesis, which prevents a new generation being produced and for
the grower to obtain a reasonable yield (Grainger, 1964). Predicting optimal time of
harvest is possible, using accumulated day degrees (Mugniéry, 1982). However, there is
a potential risk that where such methods are used intensively it may be possible to select
populations. It has been reported, for example, that intensive growing of early potatoes
resulted in populations able to hatch at lower temperatures, i.e. sooner than normal, and
develop faster thus completing their life cycle by harvest time (Hominick, 1979, 1982).

26.7.3 Physical methods

The main physical methods for nematode control are solarization and flooding. In warmer
locations, solarization has been tested against Meloidogyne with efficiency found to be
good if the treatment duration is at least 4–8 weeks. When flooding is used, the nematodes
die of asphyxiation during long periods of soil flooding, which induces anaerobic condi-
tions. In certain type of tropical soils, flooding favours the activity of sulphur-reducing
anaerobic bacteria, which product sulphurous compounds toxic to the nematodes (Jacq
and Fortuner, 1978).

26.7.4 Chemical treatments

Three groups of chemicals may be used to disinfest soils. The first are the fumigants (or
the precursors of fumigants). These products belong to the organo-halogens, and the most
commonly used on potato is 1,3-dichloropropene.

These chemicals kill nematodes by contact, but as well as being nematicidal, they
are also bactericidal, fungicidal and herbicidal; with regard to the latter, they must
be injected into the soil a long time before sowing or planting. As they are strongly
adsorbed by organic matter, they are generally used to disinfect low organic matter soils.
A consequence of their biocidal effect on the microflora and fauna is that yields may be
noticeably increased even in absence of nematodes because of the availability of extra
nutrients.

The second group belongs to the organophosphorus family of chemicals with the most
commonly used being Ethoprophos. The third group belongs to the carbamate family with
three well-known representatives: Oxamyl, Carbofuran and Aldicarb. These chemicals,
which are also insecticidal, act directly on the acetylcholinesterase receptors and lead to
the paralysis of the nematodes. They are partly or completely systemic, but their systemic
activities are only effective against insects. They have to be applied at planting or sowing
time either in the totality of the soil or in the rows. They limit the penetration of nematodes
into the roots.

All these chemicals can be extremely efficient. When they are normally used, they
lead to a direct (fumigants) or indirect (organophophorus and carbamate) mortality of
between 80 and 90%. However, this rate of mortality is seldom able to decrease the
multiplication rate of the nematodes, except Trichodorus spp., because at low-population
densities, reproduction rates can be very high resulting in a level of infestation, after
harvest, very often higher than before sowing. Their use for population control, therefore,
needs to be in conjunction with other methods, such as rotation and resistant varieties.

Furthermore, in Europe, the regulations now limit or suppress their utilization. In
numerous European countries, the carbamates are now prohibited on many food plants
(and on potatoes). The programmed prohibition of methyl bromide (probably in 2007)
will most likely lead to the banning of 1,3-dichloropropene, and we speculate that in a
very near future, the only nematicide authorized on potato will be Ethoprophos.

26.7.5 Biological methods

Meloidogyne are, in practical terms, the only nematodes that may be controlled by
microorganisms. Among them, two fungi, one predator, Arthrobotrys irregularis (Cayrol,
1983), and the other parasitic, Paecilomyces lilacinus (Jatala et al., 1981), may be used.
A. irregularis traps the juveniles before penetration into the roots. Therefore, it must be
applied a long time before sowing to give it time to colonize the soil before the hatching
of the juveniles. P. lilacinus parasitizes the females and the egg masses, destroying the
eggs and limiting their hatching. This fungus is also used against Globodera spp. in
Philippines. These two fungi are manufactured in some countries.

The most promising biological agent is probably the bacteria (or the actinomycete)
Bacillus sp. The spores of these bacteria bind to the cuticle of the nematode, and some
species are known to parasitize Meloidogyne, Globodera and Pratylenchus. The most
famous is B. penetrans, a specific parasite of Meloidogyne species. The specificity of
this species is variable, from very strong to weak. Once the juvenile is inside the roots,
the spores germinate and invade the juvenile. The spores multiply inside the developed
female of Meloidogyne, which eventually bursts producing millions of spores. The main
practical problem of this antagonist is that its culture in artificial medium is not yet
possible on an industrial scale. Consequently, practical application is limited to small
areas such as glasshouses.

The fungi P. lilacinus and Verticillium chlamydosporium have been investigated for
the control of potato cyst nematodes, but for many reasons, difficulty of application,
price, variable results and commercial sensitivity, little information is available.

26.7.6 Resistant varieties

Host resistance may be considered as the most valuable form of control. A plant is
considered as resistant when the number of nematodes able to develop to female is
reduced compared with a control. Then all degrees of resistance may exist from absolute,
i.e. zero female development to a few females reaching maturity. Resistance has been
found in a number of wild potato species against the sedentary nematodes, i.e. those that
have a very close relationship with their host.

26.7.6.1 Globodera spp.

Numerous genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) of resistance are known, and some
have been mapped (see Chapter 7, Simko et al., this volume). Against G. rostochiensis,
the first discovered was the H1 gene from Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigena. Found by
Ellenby in 1954 in the genotype CPC 1673, this dominant gene was introgressed into
S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum and is now present in many commercial varieties. It acts
when the J2s are inducing the syncytium and around which a strong necrotic reaction
occurs. As a consequence, the J2s cannot develop and die or become male. Thus, the
resistant varieties act as a trap-crop, and the annual decrease of the nematode population
is directly related to the hatching rate that is usually between 70 and 90%.

According to the Flor’s theory, a dominant resistance gene corresponds with a recessive
virulence gene in the nematode. So virulent pathotypes – Ro2/3/5 versus Ro1/4 (Janssen
et al., 1991) – were observed, mainly in the Netherlands and in Germany. Curiously, this
was not observed in the UK despite the selection pressure exercised by the very popular
resistant cultivar Maris Piper. As the H1 gene does not act against G. pallida, the main
consequence of such selection pressure has been largely to eliminate G. rostochiensis but
to allow the multiplication of G. pallida, which is now the major problem.

Following the discovery of the H1 gene, a second major gene (H2), which confers
resistance to a limited number of G. pallida populations in Northern Ireland and Scotland,
was found. As a consequence, some pathotypes were described by their ability to develop
on these major genes. In Europe, G. rostochiensis and G. pallida consist of two pathotypes
(Table 26.6) different from those described in Peru (Canto and Scurrah, 1977).

Other sources of resistance which have mainly been derived from Solanum vernei
and Solanum spegazzinii tend to exhibit quantitative resistance that is measured by the
number of females that develop and that is never absolute but dependent on a number of
environmental factors, including the initial population density. It acts, firstly, by restricting
the development of the J2s and, secondly, by limiting the development of the juveniles,
whereby they are only able to mature as males. The second effect is much more important
than the first. The resistance is partial and some females always succeed in developing
to maturity. Faced with this quantitative resistance, we observe the existence of diverse
degrees of aggressiveness as measured by the number of females that can develop. Thus, it
is possible to rank populations, and the ranking obtained is extremely consistent (Phillips
et al, 1989). However, different sources of resistance, e.g. S. vernei, S. spegazzinii or
S. tuberosum ssp. andigena, will rank populations in different ways.

Breeding against potato cyst nematodes has mainly been conducted using polygenic
resistance from S. vernei and has led to release of partially resistant varieties, which are
mainly starch potatoes.

More recently, resistance has been found in numerous wild Solanum species, such as
S. spegazzinii and Solanum sparsipilum. Genes and QTL are currently being mapped,
and the use of PCR-specific markers will greatly facilitate breeding for resistance. The
durability of such resistance is yet unknown. Against major genes, the speed of selection
mainly depends on the relative proportion of virulent nematodes in the populations (Franco
and Gonzales, 1990). Against polygenic resistance, circumventing resistance should be
slower (Forrest and Phillips, 1984). However, results from Turner et al. (1983) seem to
invalidate this theory. Recent and not yet published results show that this phenomenon
may be extremely slow if very resistant varieties are used.

26.7.6.2 Meloidogyne spp.

Numerous resistance genes are known and used against root-knot nematodes, mainly
the tropical species. Commercial varieties of cotton, peanut, watermelon and beans
(Hartmann, 1970; Ginoux et al., 1979; Castagnone-Sereno et al., 1996) are available.
Breeding is in progress for sweet potato (Jones and Dukes, 1980). Some varieties of
fodder radish appear resistant to both M. chitwoodi and M. fallax, although the gene(s)
characterization is still unknown. The first rape, resistant to M. chitwoodi, has just been
released in France in 2004.

In the Solanaceous family, numerous resistance genes have been identified. Seven
genes are found in pepper (Hendy et al., 1985) and two are mapped. The gene Rk of
tobacco acts against the tropical species and is available in numerous varieties, although
it loses its efficiency in mixed infestations with M. hapla (Eisenback, 1983). The most
famous gene of resistance is the Mi gene from Lycopersicon peruvianum, discovered
in the 1940s and subsequently introgressed in many cultivars of commercial tomatoes.
As with many resistance genes, Mi acts during penetration and migration. The J2s remain
embedded in necrotic cells and are unable to reach the vascular cylinder and induce nurse
cells. This hypersensitive reaction is lost at high temperatures above 25–28
C. The wild
aubergines bear resistance against the tropical species, and Solanum torvum is used as
root-stock for commercial egg-plant in Africa.

Fig. 26.10. Resistance from Solanum sparsipilum (gene Mh) to Southern root-knot nematodes.

In potato, the resistance gene Mh (Berthou et al., 1993) was found in S. sparsipilum
and introgressed into tetraploid progenitors (Fig. 26.10). This gene acts in the same way
as the Mi gene. Against M. chitwoodi, total resistance was found by Brown et al. (1989b,
1998) both in S. bulbocastanum and in S. hougasii, by Janssen et al. (1998) in S. fendleri
and by Berthou (unpublished) in S. schenckii. Against M. fallax, the main source of
resistance has been found in S. sparsipilum, and a QTL associated with this resistance
has now been mapped (Kouassi et al., 2005). The mechanism of resistance appears very
different against these temperate species. The main effect of the S. sparsipilum resistance,
and to some extent that found in S. schenkii, is that there is a much later reaction, which
appears not during penetration and migration but after the induction of the nurse cells
around which a necrotic reaction appears and isolates them from the vascular cylinder
(Fig. 26.11).

The durability of such resistance is unknown but has to be discussed species by species.
With the mitotic species, there is evidence that few natural populations exist, which are
naturally fully virulent and are called race B. They were found in Europe and elsewhere
in Africa, but there is no evidence that they were always selected by natural selection
pressure. Notwithstanding, it has been possible to artificially select some populations for

virulence by continuous rearing on hosts with the Mi gene. Experimental results show that
this is not possible from some populations but that in other populations it was possible
but needs 50–60 generations before virulence is selected.

At the other end of the spectrum, with the highly variable temperate species such as
M. chitwoodi, it has been shown that few females are able to develop on the resistance
gene from S. bulbocastanum and subsequently produce fully virulent progenies. Thus
there is a paradox in that the resistance is much more durable against the mitotic species
than against the meiotic species.

A consequence of the use of resistant cultivars, mainly in Africa, with the Mi gene has
been the decrease of M. incognita, M. arenaria or M. javanica in favour of the virulent
M. mayaguensis, where this species has now become predominant.

26.7.6.3 Nacobbus aberrans

Some native Andean cultivars with different diverse degrees of ploidy seem to have
fairly good resistance. According to Alarcón and Jatala (1977), the native variety Huaca
Laira (Solanum andigena) is resistant to the Peruvian populations of N. aberrans. More
recently, Finetti-Sialer (1990) bred a hybrid in which the nematode is unable to induce
syncytia. Necrosis appears soon around the female’s cuticle. Up until now, no modern
resistant tetraploid cultivar is yet available.

26.8 CONCLUSIONS

As the potato is cultivated at all latitudes and in many different climatic regions, numerous
and very different nematodes are known to cause much damage in the crop.

The potato cyst nematode, in temperate areas, is the main problem as a consequence
of intensive and modern agriculture. Long rotations of 7 years in northern Europe to
3 years in Mediterranean Europe are generally long enough to solve or contain the
problem, but this often seems incompatible with modern intensive agriculture. The use
of chemical soil treatment has to be strictly limited and will probably be prohibited
in the near future. The success of the G. rostochiensis-resistant varieties grown in
nearly all infested areas has led to its replacement by G. pallida against which the first
resistant varieties have only recently become available and for which the durability of
resistance is still uncertain. As numerous new resistance genes have recently been found
and genetically mapped, it is hoped that, with the help of marker-assisted breeding,
combinations of genes can be constructed and limit or delay the nematodes’ ability to
circumvent these resistances. If and when accepted, genetically modified varieties would
be a supplementary hope (Urwin et al., 2003).

The problems caused by Pratylenchus sp. and Verticillium sp. seem to be restricted
to the USA. In Europe, where these two pests are often found, disease does not occur.
Probably, soil improvement would be enough to reduce the problem.

M. hapla is common but, although this species is known to attack numerous cultivated

plants, disease on potato is rare.

The vector virus nematodes are generally present in sandy soils, in which the efficiency
of fumigants is optimal. Weed control, summer ploughing and use of certified seed and

592

Mugniéry and Phillips

varieties unsusceptible to TRV are enough to reduce the problem. Against D. destructor,
prophylactic methods have reduced the problem to a minimum.

Now in 2007, the most potentially dangerous nematodes are M. chitwoodi and M. fallax.
Fortunately, they are not widely spread, but were they to become so, their importance
is great. Due to their high variability, it is unlikely that resistant potato varieties will be
durable. The most promising control method would probably be the use of horizontal
resistance as found in fodder radish.

In tropical and Mediterranean areas, the two main problems are due to the southern
root-knot nematodes and N. aberrans. Faced with the highly polyphagous Meloidogyne
species, control must favour biological antagonists such as B. penetrans integrated with
the use of resistant cultivated plants. The recent introgression of the Mh gene in modern
tetraploid potatoes would be a supplementary tool not only to protect the potato but also
to protect the other susceptible crops of the rotations. Although we have no estimate of
the durability of this new resistance, the fact that it behaves as the very durable Mi gene
is extremely encouraging.

In the mountains of tropical South America, the problem caused by N. aberrans is
not yet resolved. This nematode is serious, because it occurs in very poor areas and few
studies had been made. It is an urgent requirement that resistant varieties be developed
and released in order to help the Andean farmers.

27.1 INTRODUCTION

Diseases caused by bacterial pathogens are major threats to potato production. Pathogenic
bacteria, once introduced, may persist and spread in agricultural environments. Moreover,
their inadvertent and unnoticed spread as contamination or in latent (asymptomatic) infec-
tions of seed potatoes is particularly important. Under conditions favourable for disease
development, bacterial phytopathogens multiply rapidly and cause significant yield loss
and economic damage. In general, bactericides are ineffective as crop protection agents,
and their usefulness for disinfecting seed tubers is limited. Immunity to bacterial diseases
is generally not available, although some cultivars show tolerance and various levels of
resistance. Control of some bacterial diseases such as those caused by the quarantine
pathogens, Ralstonia solanacearum and Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus, can
only be achieved by costly statutory measures.

In this chapter, the biology and pathology of the major bacterial diseases includ-
ing blackleg, stem rot, bacterial soft rot, bacterial wilt, bacterial ring rot and common
scab will be discussed. Thereafter, measures to control bacterial diseases by produc-
tion of pathogen-tested seed, reduction of inoculum and helpful agronomic practices are
addressed.

27.2 PATHOGEN BIOLOGY

27.2.1

Ralstonia solanacearum

R. solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al. (formerly Pseudomonas and Burkholderia
solanacearum) causes bacterial wilt, also known as potato brown rot (Hayward, 1991).
This disease is a major constraint for potato production in tropical and subtropical regions,
but it has also become a threat in temperate European countries (Janse, 1996). The bac-
terium is Gram-negative non-spore-forming, aerobic, motile and rod-shaped. It grows
relatively fast, with colonies becoming visible within 2 days when cultured on agar
medium. Upon isolation, colonies are mucoid, but when subcultured they readily convert

into non-mucoid forms that have reduced virulence (Wallis and Truter, 1978; Hayward,
1991). The bacterium has a diverse and broad host range. Traditionally, it has been
informally classified into five races on the basis of differences in host range and into
six biovars on the basis of biochemical and physiological characteristics (He and Hua,
1985; Fegan and Prior, 2005). Biovars 1–4 and race 1 and 3 strains cause bacterial wilt
in potato. Biovar 2 is nearly synonymous with race 3 and includes strains adapted to
temperate and cooler regions at high altitudes in (sub)tropical areas. Biovar 2 strains
are mainly seed-borne on potato and are genetically and phenotypically homogeneous.
Potato strains of biovars 1, 3 and 4 are grouped into race 1 and are mainly soil-borne
in tropical regions. They show wide variations in host range and have high genetic
and phenotypic diversity. Biovar 1 is primarily found in North and South America and
Africa, whereas biovar 3 is primarily found in Asia. Recently, R. solanacearum has
been classified into four phytotypes (subspecies level) on the basis of the nucleotide
sequence of the internal spacer region of the ribosomal gene operon. Twenty-three
sequevars (infrasubspecific groups) have also been identified on the basis of genetic
fingerprinting methods and the sequence of an endoglucanase gene (Fegan and Prior,
2005). This classification offers a more stable and meaningful taxonomy than the division
into races.

The typical wilting of plants caused by R. solanacearum seems to be largely due to
clogging of the vascular system by large amounts of extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs)
produced by the bacterium (Schell, 1996; Genin and Boucher, 2002). EPS-deficient
mutants are much less virulent, although they are not entirely non-pathogenic. It has
been suggested that EPS, apart from interfering with water transport, also contributes
to protecting bacterial surface structures from the plant defence system. Extracellular
cell-wall degrading enzymes may also be involved in the induction of wilt symptoms, as
they cause disintegration of vascular tissue, limiting water transport. The role of cell-wall
degrading enzymes, such as endopolygalacturonase, pectin methylesterase (PME) and
glucanase, in pathogenesis of R. solanacearum, however, is minor compared with the role
these enzymes play in pathogenesis of pectolytic erwinias. Extracellular enzyme-deficient
mutants of R. solanacearum are pathogenic although symptom expression is delayed
when they are inoculated into host plants.

Pathogenicity factors are under control of two cell-density–dependent quorum sens-
ing systems controlled by different signal molecules, 3-hydroxypalmitic acid methyl
ester and acylhomoserine lactone, that interact in complex ways (Von Bodman et al.,
2003). The quorum sensing mechanism allows bacteria to respond to population density
and thereby delay production of the extracellular enzymes until a critical cell density
has been achieved. It has been suggested that the genetic regulatory apparatus post-
pones enzyme production until bacterial cell numbers are high enough to overwhelm
the plant’s defence response. The quorum sensing mechanism allows the bacterium to
modulate expression of factors important in the early phase of pathogenesis such as
motility and production of siderophores when bacterial density is low and, at high den-
sities, to produce factors such as EPS, PME and glucanases that are required in a later
phase of disease development. It is anticipated that further analysis of the complete
R. solanacearum genome will further unveil the secrets of its pathogenesis (Salanoubat
et al., 2002).

27.2.2 Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus

is the
C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus (Spiekermann and Kotthoff) Davis et al.
causative agent of bacterial ring rot. The disease was reported for the first time by
Appel (1906) after an outbreak in Germany. The pathogen has been described under the
following names: Corynebacterium sepedonicum, Bacterium sepedonicum, Aplanobacter
sepedonicum, Phytomonas sepedonica, Mycobacterium sepedonicum and Pseudobacter
sepedonicum. C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus is a Gram-positive, non-motile, slow-
growing, aerobic, coryneform bacterium (Slack, 1987). On laboratory media, colonies
become visible only after 3–7 days and remain small. C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus
does not form spores and cannot resist high temperatures but survives well under cool
and dry conditions. It forms a relatively homogeneous group. In BOX-PCR analyses,
a genetic fingerprinting technique based on primers that anneal to repetitive sequences
dispersed over the entire bacterial genome, C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus strains
form a tight group with a similarity of over 80% (Smith et al., 2001). Also in analyses
of fatty acid methyl esters, C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus forms a tight group with
profiles that overlap with profiles of related subspecies (Henningson and Gudmestad,
1991). There is little variation in the serological specificity among C. michiganensis ssp.
sepedonicus strains. Polyclonal antibodies generated against whole cells and a monoclonal
antibody selected against a cell wall component reacted in immunofluorescence antibody-
staining procedures with all strains tested (De Boer and Wieczorek, 1984). A monoclonal
antibody produced against the soluble EPS, suitable for use in ELISA, reacted with all
strains except those that were non-mucoid. The poor reaction of non-mucoid strains is
presumably due to a low level of the polysaccharide antigen (De Boer et al., 1988).

The pathogenicity factors of C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus and their genetic con-
trol are largely unknown, in part, because the genetics of coryneform, Gram-positive
bacteria remain unexplored (Metzler et al., 1997). Thus far, only the plant cell-wall
degrading enzyme, cellulase, and evidence for a hypersensitivity gene operon have
been identified as pathogenicity factors. A cellulose-negative wild-type strain was nearly
non-virulent, but virulence could be restored by transformation with a cloned cellu-
lase gene (Laine et al., 2000). Virulent C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus strains pro-
duce a hypersensitive response in tobacco, a non-host plant for C. michiganensis ssp.
sepedonicus, and used widely to bioassay for the presence of hrp genes (Nissinen
et al., 2001). With the recent availability of the genome sequence for C. michiganen-
sis ssp. sepedonicus, it may now be possible to explore similarities and differences of
pathogenicity factors of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria on a molecular basis
(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/C_michiganensis).

27.2.3 Pectolytic erwinias

Pectolytic erwinias are responsible for the bacterial foliage diseases known as blackleg,
aerial stem rot and stem wet rot, as well as bacterial soft rot in tubers. Until recently, the
causative agents were distinguished as Erwinia carotovora ssp. atroseptica (van Hall)
Dye, Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora (Jones) Bergey et al. and Erwinia chrysanthemi

598

van der Wolf and De Boer

Burkholder et al. (Pérombelon and Kelman, 1980). In 2004, atypical strains of E. caro-
tovora causing blackleg in Brazil were described as Erwinia carotovora ssp. brasiliensis
(Duarte et al., 2004). E. carotovora ssp. brasiliensis strains grow at higher temperatures
than E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica and are considerably more virulent. They are distin-
guishable by characteristic serological, genetic and biochemical features. On the basis of
DNA–DNA hybridization studies, serology and numerical taxonomy, E. carotovora ssp.
atroseptica and E. carotovora ssp. carotovora were recently reclassified, respectively,
as Pectobacterium carotovorum ssp. atrosepticum and Pectobacterium carotovorum ssp.
carotovorum (Hauben et al., 1998). In a further study, E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica was
given species status as Pectobacterium atrosepticum (Gardan et al., 2003). In this chapter,
we have retained the familiar Erwinia taxons used in most recent scientific publications.
The host range of E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica is mostly limited to potato in which
it incites the blackleg disease. The subspecies is genetically and phenotypically homoge-
neous. In contrast, E. carotovora ssp. carotovora is a far more heterogeneous subspecies.
It causes aerial stem rot and is often responsible for bacterial soft rot of tubers dur-
ing storage (De Boer and Kelman, 1978; Bartz and Kelman, 1984). E. carotovora ssp.
carotovora also has a broad host range, reflecting its polyphagous nature. Analysis of
restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of a recA gene fragment revealed 18
groups among 56 E. carotovora ssp. carotovora strains compared with 2 RFLP groups
among 13 E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica strains (Waléron et al., 2002). Similarly, RFLP
analysis of the pel gene revealed 16 groups among 40 E. carotovora ssp. carotovora strains
and 2 groups among 32 E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica strains. In the field, E. carotovora
ssp. carotovora strains are often secondary invaders, colonizing and macerating plants
wounded by other pathogens.

E. chrysanthemi, the causal agent of stem wet rot, like E. carotovora ssp. carotovora,
has a wide host range and is phenotypically diverse. On the basis of biochemical and
serological features, E. chrysanthemi has been divided into nine biovars (Samson et al.,
1987; Ngwira and Samson 1990). Biovars 1, 5 and 7 have been found associated with
disease in potato (Samson et al., 1987; Janse and Ruissen, 1988). Some relationship
was found between biovar and host specificity, but most biovars induce symptoms of
decay in potato under conditions favourable for disease expression. E. chrysanthemi has
recently been redistributed among six genomic species in a new genus, Dickeya (Samson
et al., 2005). Potato strains of E. chrysanthemi are found within the new species Dickeya
zeae, Dickeya chrysanthemi and Dickeya dianthicola (Samson et al., 2005; unpublished
results). D. dianthicola (biovar 7) grows relatively well at low temperatures and is mainly
found in temperate zones. It is unknown to what extent the species further differ in their
biology and pathogenesis.

Production of cell-wall degrading enzymes, including pectinases, cellulases, proteases
and xylanases, is a dominant factor in pathogenesis of erwinias. The pectinases, that
degrade pectin in the middle lamella between plant cells, are considered to be the most
important for pathogenicity (Collmer and Keen, 1986; Pérombelon, 2002; De Boer, 2003).
Of the various pectolytic enzymes that are produced, many are present in multiple forms
(isoenzymes), each with different optimal pH values and active on substrates with differ-
ent degrees of methylation. The multiplicity of isoenzymes allows plasticity in metabolism

Bacterial pathogens of potato

and thereby enhances the erwinias’ ability to survive in and colonize different environ-
ments. The production of pectolytic enzymes is regulated in a cell-density–dependent
manner (Pirhonen et al., 1993; Von Bodman et al., 2003). Only when populations reach a
particular threshold level does enzyme production commence. It has been suggested that
in this way the bacteria can thrive unnoticed at lower densities without triggering plant
defence mechanisms. Subsequent bacterial multiplication and initiation of decay com-
mences when host resistance is impaired in some way by physiological or environmental
changes. Several other determinants have been implicated as important in pathogenesis,
although they may not be clearly distinguished from functions of general housekeeping
processes. For instance, flagellar motility may be important during tuber lenticel infection
when free soil water is available. Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), a major component in
the bacterial outer cell wall, inhibit the hypersensitivity response of plants; LPS mutants
of E. chrysanthemi have considerably reduced virulence. The plant-inducible peptide
methionine sulphoxide reductase protects E. chrysanthemi against active oxygen species.
The exact role of some pathogenicity-related genes such as hrp and avr is only par-
tially understood. Recently, the genome sequence of E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica has
become available and has already revealed the presence of novel pathogenicity determi-
nants, including a putative synthetase system similar to that associated with phytotoxin
production in other plant pathogenic bacteria (Bell et al., 2004).

27.2.4 Streptomyces scabies

Streptomyces scabies is also to be reckoned among the significant prokaryote pathogens
of potato although it differs from the other phytopathogenic bacteria in its hyphal-like
filamentous growth pattern. S. scabies is the principal causal agent of the common scab
disease of potato, but other species of streptomycetes including Streptomyces acidiscabies
and Streptomyces turgidiscabies also cause the disease under varying conditions (Lambert
and Loria, 1989a,b; Miyajima et al., 1998). Streptomycetes are atypical, high G + C,
Gram-positive, filamentous bacteria that produce vegetative spores by fragmentation
of aerial filaments. The grey, smooth spores of S. scabies are borne in spiral chains.
This phenotypic characteristic plus utilization of specific sugars characterize the species
(Lambert and Loria, 1989a). S. scabies itself is a heterogeneous species, and other scab-
inducing streptomycetes are only distantly related on the basis of genotypic and phenotypic
criteria (Bouchek-Mechiche et al., 2000). The main virulence factor common to all the
pathogenic streptomycetes is the phytotoxin thaxtomin, which is a nitrated dipeptide toxin
(Lawrence et al., 1990). Most strains carry a second virulence factor, the nec1 gene, which
encodes a necrogenic protein (Bukhalid et al., 1998). Both the nec1 and the thaxtomin
synthesis genes, txtABC, along with other virulence-associated genes, are carried on a
325-kb chromosomal element known as a pathogenicity island (PAI). PAIs are known
to carry clusters of pathogenicity-related genes in other plant and animal pathogenic
bacteria (Kers et al., 2005). Pathogenicity can in some cases be passed on to related
strains by horizontal gene transfer involving the entire PAI. Mobilization of the PAI gene
cluster into Streptomyces diastatochromogenes transferred the scab-inducing phenotype
to this non-pathogenic species, whereas transconjugants of Streptomyces coelicolor did not
produce thaxtomin or necrotize potato tuber tissue (Kers et al., 2005). Horizontal transfer of

600

van der Wolf and De Boer

the PAI from S. scabies into specific receptive Streptomyces spp. perhaps accounts for the
variability of apparent species associated with induction of the scab disease.

27.3 PATHOLOGY

27.3.1 Symptoms and factors favouring symptom expression

Field symptoms caused by R. solanacearum are wilting, stunting, yellowing of foliage
and collapse of stems (Fig. 27.1A). Virulent strains of R. solanacearum colonize the
vascular tissue in which they produce large amounts of EPS (Fig. 27.1B). The occlu-
sion of vascular tissue interferes with the movement of water and results in wilt-
ing. By placing sections of infected stems in water, fine white strands of bacterial
slime can be observed to ooze from cut vascular bundles, a diagnostic character-
istic of the disease. Vascular bundles of infected cross-sectioned tubers also exude
drops of greyish slime without the application of pressure (Fig. 27.1C). In advanced
infections, parenchymatous tuber tissue disintegrates, resulting in a progressing rot
(Fig. 27.1D). Symptoms of bacterial wilt develop with high bacterial densities at high
humidity and temperatures exceeding 25
C. Resistance of some cultivars to bacterial
wilt is temperature dependent and varies with bacterial strain. Some potato cultivars
that show resistance at low temperatures become susceptible at higher temperatures
(French, 1994).

(cid:2)

Early symptoms of bacterial ring rot caused by C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus
are characterized by wilting of leaves and slight rolling of leaf margins (Fig. 27.2A).
Interveinal spaces of the leaves become light green to pale yellow. As the disease
progresses, leaves become necrotic, starting at the margins or in interveinal tissue and
continues to spread until the entire stem collapses. Development of necrotic lesions has
been described at high inoculum levels that expand to cover entire leaves in susceptible
cultivars, whereas they are arrested in resistant ones, which may suggest a hypersensitive
response (Romanenko et al., 2002). Tuber symptoms are characterized by decay in the
vascular ring (Fig. 27.2D). Prior to the onset of decay, infected vascular tissue may have
a glassy appearance and take on a dark colour at the heel end (De Boer and Slack, 1984).
In advanced infections, the vascular tissue becomes creamy and cheesy in texture, and
milky exudate can sometimes be squeezed from it (Fig. 27.2C). Eventually, the entire tuber
usually decays. As rot progresses, surface cracks and dark blotches immediately beneath
the periderm sometimes become visible (Fig. 27.2B). Secondary infections by saprophytic
bacteria can mask typical ring rot symptoms. Recently in Europe, it was observed that the
central cortex decays at the same time as the vascular ring in infected tubers, perhaps a
characteristic of some European cultivars. Symptom development follows the acquisition
of high bacterial densities in potato tissue and varies with cultivar susceptibility and
temperature (van der Wolf et al., 2005a). Symptoms in susceptible cultivars are generally
observed 90–100 days after planting (Hukkanen et al., 2005) while they rarely develop in
tolerant cultivars. To avoid aphid transmission of virus diseases, haulms of seed potato
crops are often destroyed prior to the appearance of ring rot symptoms. This practice
leads to the persistence of latent ring rot infections and the inevitable consequences for

disease dissemination. Ring rot foliar symptoms can also be masked by other diseases
and natural senescence (van der Wolf et al., 2005a).

When Erwinia-infected seed tubers are used for planting, they sometimes decay
before sprouts emerge or a plant is established creating a condition known as non-
emergence or seed piece decay (Pérombelon and Kelman, 1980). Non-emergence is
exacerbated by heavy rainfall that causes soil compaction and saturation leading to
anaerobic conditions that favour bacterial soft rot. Post-emergence symptoms of E. caro-
tovora ssp. atroseptica and E. chrysanthemi infections often start with dark colouring
of upper leaves, followed by chlorosis and wilting (Fig. 27.3A and B). As the dis-
ease progresses, stems wilt or show blackleg symptoms and ultimately the entire stem
dies (Fig. 27.3C). Contamination of foliage and subsequent crop damage due to heavy
rainfall, hail, insects or human activities can result in aerial stem rot. The identity of
the Erwinia species or subspecies cannot usually be reliably established on the basis
of symptomology alone. At high field temperatures, E. carotovora ssp. carotovora
can be the primary source of infection and result in wilting of plants. In temperate
zones, some E. carotovora ssp. carotovora strains can cause blackleg-like symptoms
(D. Stead, personal communication).

Bacterial soft rot of potato tubers is favoured by anaerobic conditions and a high relative
humidity (Fig. 27.3D and E). The temperature determines largely whether erwinias are
able to infect tubers and which (sub)species will dominate (Pérombelon and Kelman,
1980). At temperatures below 15
C, E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica is primarily involved
in decay, whereas at higher temperatures, it is primarily E. chrysanthemi and E. carotovora
ssp. carotovora, possibly in association with other pectolytic bacteria.

(cid:2)

Although the erwinias are the primary causal agents of bacterial soft rot of tubers,
other pectolytic bacteria from the soil environment contribute to the development and
progression of post-harvest decay. In particular, anaerobic Clostridium spp. are effective
soft rotters of oxygen-deprived potato tissues and are responsible for the slimy, foul-
smelling characteristic of tuber decay (Campos et al., 1982). Although there are many
pectolytic clostridial species, only one species, Clostridium puniceum, has been well
characterized as a component of bacterial soft rot (Lund et al., 1981). Clostridium spp.
produce long-living endospores that are commonly present in soil and on potato tuber
surfaces. Water on tubers in storage resulting from inappropriate storage conditions
or leakage from decaying tubers creates hypoxic conditions favourable to the growth of
pectolytic clostridia.

Pectolytic fluorescent pseudomonads also form a component of the soil microbial
flora and are associated with soft rot of fleshy vegetables including potato (Cuppels and
Kelman, 1980). These bacteria, a biochemically diverse group identified as Pseudomonas
fluorescens, have also been reported to be the causal agent of the pink eye disease of potato
(Folsom and Friedman, 1959). The pink eye disease is characterized by discolouration
of cortex cells that appear as pink blotches on the skin. Pink eyes may break down into
watery lesions that turn brown and become sunken and cracked when dry. Underlying
tissue may develop soft rot with concomitant infection by other organisms (Hagar and
McIntyre, 1972). Symptoms of pink eye occur only when soil moisture content is high
and the disease is particularly enhanced by the presence of Verticillium wilt (Goth
et al., 1993). Although pink eye symptoms were induced by artificial inoculation with P.

fluorescens (Folsom and Friedman, 1959), a subsequent attempt to confirm the association
of the bacterium with the disease by isolation and completion of Koch’s postulates
was unsuccessful (Nolte et al., 1993). Because mature pink eye lesions are similar in
appearance to corky patch syndrome that has multiple aetiologies, it has been suggested
that pink eye is just one manifestation of corky patch characterized by the accumulation
of fluorescent phenolic metabolic products of plant defence and wound healing processes
(Nolte et al., 1993).

Common scab is characterized by superficial rough, circular or irregular lesions on the
tuber skin (Fig. 27.4A and B). Symptoms may vary with the particular strain of Strepto-
myces involved. When lesions are particularly superficial, the disease is sometimes called
russet scab, and when particularly deep called pitted scab (Fig. 27.4C). S. turgidiscabies
is specifically associated with erumpent scab in which the lesion perimeters are slightly
raised above surrounding peridermal tissue. The pathogen invades lenticels or wounds
on the surface of developing tubers. Initially, infections appear as tan or brown-coloured

604

van der Wolf and De Boer

circular lesions of 5–8 mm in diameter. As the lesions mature, they may increase in
size to 10 mm and coalesce into irregular patches that, in severe infections, cover a sig-
nificant portion of the tuber surface. Although tuber infections are the most common
manifestation of the disease, root infection can occur but is not known to decrease yield
significantly.

27.3.2 Economic importance

R. solanacearum and C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus are considered of quarantine
significance throughout the old world, e.g. by EPPO, APPPC and IAPSC, and also in
the new world by NAPPO and COSAVE. A zero tolerance has been established for
these pathogens. They cause economic damage in three different ways: (i) by direct crop
loss during growth and storage, (ii) by rejection of infected seed lots and the cost of
control measures and (iii) by loss of export markets and difficulty in developing new
markets. The finding of only a single infected tuber can result in enormous economic
consequences, not only for an individual grower but for an entire seed potato-producing
area.

From a global perspective, R. solanacearum is, after Phytophthora infestans (late
blight), probably the most economically important pathogen of potato. In temperate zones
of Europe, the economic consequence is mainly a result of statutory measures that are
imposed upon the detection of the bacterium in asymptomatic tubers. Symptoms of
bacterial wilt or brown rot rarely occur in commercial potato production in temperate
regions of Europe. In contrast, in tropical and subtropical regions, the incidence of
bacterial wilt disease can be very high and result in high yield losses. There is a linear
relationship between yield loss and wilt incidence in these areas (Elphinstone, 1989).
In Nepal, the average incidence of bacterial wilt was 33% of potato crops raised from
farmer-saved seed. The incidence of latent infections in seed was found to be as high
as 15–19% (Pradhanang et al., 2000). Also in African countries, wilt disease incidences
of up to 100% have been reported in heavily infested soils planted with farmer-saved
seed (Lemaga et al., 2001). Before certified seed was used, extensive crop losses were
also reported in subtropical areas such as Israel and Greece (Zachos, 1957; Volcani and
Palti, 1960).

It is claimed that statutory control measures for control of C. michiganensis ssp.
sepedonicus cost more than the actual yield losses due to the ring rot disease (De
Boer, 1987; Stead and Wilson, 1996). However, the potential for direct losses caused
by C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus should not be underestimated. Without appropriate
precautions, C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus can rapidly disseminate through seed
tubers and cause considerable yield loss. Even without visible symptom development,
tuber yield (number and weight) of C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus-infected plants is
considerably lower than of healthy plants (R. Karjalainen, unpublished results). In the
1940s, the pathogen was present in all major potato-producing districts of Canada and
the USA. In particular, the use of picker planters and the practice of cutting seed were
largely responsible for the high incidence of bacterial ring rot. The lack of adequate
detection methods for asymptomatic infections hampered control of the disease in those
years. Incidentally, during that time, up to 80% of seed lot rejections in parts of the USA

Bacterial pathogens of potato

605

were due to bacterial ring rot (Eddins, 1939; Kreutzer and McLean, 1943). In Maine
(USA), in 1939 and in 1940, respectively, 11.5 and 7.5% of all certified seed lots were
rejected due to bacterial ring rot (Baribeau, 1948). In Canadian surveys conducted during
1943–47, 9–16% of the farms in Ontario and Quebec were found to be infected with ring
rot (Richardson and Goodin, 1949). As recently as 1978, 60% of the total seed rejected
for certification in the USA was rejected due to infections with C. michiganensis ssp.
sepedonicus (Slack et al., 1979). Only by implementation of an intensive eradication
programme could the incidence of ring rot be reduced. The incidence of bacterial ring rot
in eastern Canada dropped from 5.1% in 1983 to only 0.04% in 1992 (De Boer, 1999).
Also in Western Europe, where C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus was frequently found
in Scandinavian countries and in Germany, functional eradication is being achieved by
targeted campaigns. Only an occasional reoccurrence happens, which is now followed by
immediate action to mitigate its impact.

Blackleg and stem wet rot cause large annual economic losses in some geographic
areas due to rejection and declassification to a lower grade of seed. In the Netherlands,
for example, declassification to a lower grade costs on average E2/100 kg of seed. From
2002 to 2004, on average 9% of the seed potato hectarage was declassified and 3% was
rejected due to blackleg or stem wet rot. In 2003, when weather conditions were very
favourable for disease expression in the Netherlands, the economic loss due to erwinia
infections was estimated at E17 million. Thirty years ago, blackleg was estimated to cause
losses of 5–10% in some potato-growing regions of the USA with losses as high as 40%
in individual fields (Stanghellini and Meneley, 1975). Today, however, the incidence
of blackleg, in particular, has been significantly decreased by the use of erwinia-tested
minitubers for the initiation of seed stocks.

Loss of agricultural produce due to bacterial soft rots is difficult to estimate but is
known to be large. An estimate of 10% loss caused by post-harvest decay of root crops is
realistic, and much of it is due to decay initiated by the pectolytic erwinias. In 1980, potato
crop loss due to bacterial soft rot on a worldwide basis was estimated to be in the range
of $US50–100 million (Pérombelon and Kelman, 1980). Improvements in harvesting
equipment and better controlled storage have undoubtedly curbed losses in storage over
the last 25 years, which likely still exceed $US100 million at today’s currency levels.
Seed piece decay causing failure in crop stands have been recorded as high as 50%
(Pérombelon et al., 1988).

Although common scab does not generally affect yield, it is an economically impor-
tant disease on account of its impact on marketability of affected tubers. Scab-infected
tubers have decreased value on the fresh market because infections are unsightly and
decrease value for processing due to decreased quality. Grade-out of scabby tubers
can be significant and seriously diminish profit margins for both seed and ware pota-
toes. Actual estimates of economic losses due to common scab are not available,
however.

27.3.3 Geographic distribution

R. solanacearum is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world.
Biovars 1, 3 and 4 are present in the warmer areas, whereas biovar 2 is present in temperate

606

van der Wolf and De Boer

zones and cooler areas at high altitudes in tropical regions (Anonymous, 2005a). Recently,
biovar 2 has become widespread in temperate regions of Europe. C. michiganensis ssp.
sepedonicus occurs chiefly in temperate zones and is not known to occur in tropical
or subtropical areas. Bacterial ring rot has been reported from at least 31 countries
distributed over five continents (Stead and Wilson, 1996; Anonymous, 2005b). Some
reports are unclear, however, on whether the disease reported is due to R. solanacearum
or C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus because of similarities in symptomologies and
inadequacy of microbiological resources in developing countries. The disease has never
been found in Australia. It was first described in Germany in 1906 and first found in North
America in 1931 in Quebec (Canada). Subsequently, it has been reported in most potato-
growing areas of Canada and the United States. C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus occurs
in the Scandinavian countries and Eastern Europe. It is occasionally reported in Western
European countries. The disease has fortunately never been found in Scotland, a major
producer of seed. A few occurrences have recently been reported in the Netherlands, the
other major seed potato-producing area of Europe. E. chrysanthemi and E. carotovora ssp.
carotovora, having a wide host range, are worldwide in distribution. E. carotovora
ssp. atroseptica is found in all potato-producing areas in the Northern Hemisphere, but
the finding of E. carotovora ssp. brasiliensis in Brazil as the causal agent of blackleg
raises questions about the identity of blackleg-causing strains elsewhere. Scab-inducing
streptomycetes are widespread and occur wherever potatoes are grown. Specific species
or metabolic types may vary from region to region.

27.4 ECOLOGY

27.4.1 Plant colonization

Bacterial pathogens lack the enzymatic repertoire to penetrate intact plant tissue directly.
They depend on wounds or natural entrances, such as stomata, lenticels and hydathodes,
or regions of secondary root emergence to enter plant tissues. Once inside the plant,
however, bacterial pathogens can remain latent in asymptomatic infections and be spread
in vegetative plant propagules. In this way, seed potato tubers serve as the major primary
inoculum source for most of the bacterial potato diseases. After planting, bacteria from the
seed tuber are transported through the xylem vessels of the vascular tissue and colonize
sprouts and the growing plants. The vascular pathogens such as C. michiganensis ssp.
sepedonicus and R. solanacearum, in particular, infect successive generations of potato
plants from infected tubers that are often symptomless and used inadvertently for seed.
This may also be true to a lesser extent for E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica (De Boer,
2002). In tropical areas, R. solanacearum is known to be soil-borne, and disease can be
initiated directly from root infection.

In active infections caused by C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus, R. solanacearum
or E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica, bacterial populations achieve very high levels and
result in decay of the seed tuber or early death of the plant. Alternatively, bacteria from
the seed tuber may invade and colonize the stem and proceed to infect progeny tubers,
only causing symptoms of disease when cultivar characteristics and growing conditions

Bacterial pathogens of potato

607

are appropriate for their manifestation. Bacterial slime, consisting of EPSs, occludes the
plant’s water transport system, resulting in wilting symptoms typical of vascular diseases.
Scab-inducing streptomycetes are not systemic invaders of potato plants. Rather they
infect tubers, and to a lesser extent roots, through lenticels and remain localized to
superficial tissues. Some strains do, however, cause necrosis deep into tuber tissue to
cause a condition know as deep-pitted scab.

27.4.2 Survival

(cid:2)

The bacterial pathogens of potato are weak competitors among the microbial flora in soil
and other natural habitats. Although they survive while confined in infected potato debris,
in general they do not survive for long periods of time in unprotected environments with
high microbial activity. C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus and some of the erwinias such
as E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica survive for less than a year in soil at temperatures higher
than 10
C. E. carotovora ssp. carotovora survives better in soil than does E. carotovora
ssp. atroseptica and can often be detected in potato field soil with appropriate enrichment
techniques. Survival data for European potato strains of E. chrysanthemi are not available
although the bacterium survived in association with detritus in alpine streams in Australia
(Cother and Gilbert, 1990). However, it was not detected in soil and bog samples near
E. chrysanthemi-positive streams. C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus only survives in soil
for prolonged periods in a dried state or at temperatures below −10
C. R. solanacearum is
a soil resident in tropical areas, where in many soils relatively high densities are found. In
temperate regions, R. solanacearum survival periods never exceeded 2 years, even in the
presence of high numbers of overwintering tubers (Elphinstone, 1996). It survived longest
when protected from microbial antagonism and desiccation in deep soil layers (75 cm)
and in association with plant host tissue. Soils that are flooded annually (e.g. sugar cane
fields) and river flood plains generally do not harbour populations of R. solanacearum
(Hartman and Elphinstone, 1994).

(cid:2)

Alternate hosts, including weeds and field crops, play a role in the survival of
R. solanacearum and erwinias between two successive potato crops. However, they seem
to be of little importance in the epidemiology of C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus, which
has a restricted host range (van der Wolf et al., 2005b). In particular, biovars 1, 3 and
4 of R. solanacearum have a broad host range and infect many crops grown in rotation
with potato and in a number of solanaceous weeds, such as Solanum carolinense in the
USA and Portulaca oleracea in Australia (Moffett and Hayward, 1980). Biovar 2, which
is responsible for brown rot in Europe, survives during the winter in roots of bittersweet
(Solanum dulcamara), a perennial riparian weed (Janse, 1996). During the spring when
temperatures rise and exceed 15
C, R. solanacearum cells in infected S. dulcamara roots
multiply and are released into adjacent streams at high densities. In Australia, Solanum
cinereum, another perennial weed, may be involved in overwintering of biovar 2 (Graham
and Lloyd, 1978). In Scotland and the USA, both E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica and
E. carotovora ssp. carotovora were found in the rhizosphere of different crops and weeds
(Mendoca and Stanghellini, 1979; McCarter-Zorner et al., 1985). In Scotland, infected
weeds were even found in fields where no potatoes were grown for 2 years or more,
although at low frequency.

(cid:2)

608

van der Wolf and De Boer

C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus, but not the pectolytic erwinias and R. solanacearum,
survives for long periods on the surfaces of farm equipment, tools and storages (Nelson,
1980). Survival of C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus is particularly enhanced by low
humidity and low temperature. Survival on various surface materials for more than 10
months under conditions of widely fluctuating temperatures and relatively low humidity
has been recorded. Consequently, contaminated storage bins and farm equipment that are
not adequately cleaned and disinfected serve as sources of inoculum for disease spread.
The erwinias and R. solanacearum do not persist for long periods on surfaces of farm
equipment but do survive for sufficient periods of time to spread infections during potato
handling operations such as harvesting and grading.

Streptomyces spp. are common soil inhabitants and also the plant pathogenic strains
survive in soil and plant debris for more than 10 years. However, potato tubers are also
an important source of inoculum. Propagules of pathogenic Streptomyces spp. have been
estimated to be as high as 109 colony forming units/g of scab lesion and at 105 colony
forming units/g of healthy potato tuber periderm (Wang and Lazarovits, 2004). Tuber-
borne inoculum is an important means by which the pathogen is introduced to new areas
and also contributes directly to disease severity (Wilson et al., 1999).

27.4.3 Dissemination

27.4.3.1 Through potato tubers

The chief means by which the bacterial potato pathogens are dispersed over long dis-
tances are in or on infected and contaminated potato tubers. Dissemination of pathogens
occurs mostly on seed potatoes, but there are also examples of ware potatoes being used
as tablestock for fresh consumption or production for processing into starch or other
products that served to introduce the bacteria into formerly pathogen-free regions. There
is good evidence that during the mid-1970s surface water in Sweden became infested
with R. solanacearum through waste water from a potato processing factory (Olsson,
1976). Similar scenarios may have happened more recently in other European countries,
contributing to the widespread occurrence of R. solanacearum in temperate European
countries today.

27.4.3.2 Through soil

The erwinias and R. solanacearum are motile bacteria and thus readily move through
water films in soil and contaminate progeny tubers from decaying seed tubers and other
infected plant tissues. The spread of the pectolytic erwinias, released by decaying seed
tubers, to progeny tubers resulting in lenticel infections, has been well documented as
an important infection route. Erwinias have been detected in soil at distances of 1–3 m
from the source of a decaying seed tuber. There is no evidence that dissemination of
C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus, being non-motile, occurs through soil to play a role
in the epidemiology of the ring rot disease. Infections largely, if not entirely, are a result
of internal colonization from infected seed tubers or from contaminated equipment used
for planting, harvesting, grading, transporting or storing the crop.

Bacterial pathogens of potato

609

27.4.3.3 Through surface water

There is good evidence that overhead irrigation with contaminated surface water has
resulted in initial infections of seed lots with R. solanacearum in several countries in
Europe. Erwinias have also been found in both salt and fresh surface water, although they
are found at relatively low densities of 1–1000 cells/ml. Of the erwinias, E. carotovora ssp.
carotovora is most commonly found, but in one study E. carotovora ssp. atroseptica- and
E. chrysanthemi strains together comprised up to 10% of the erwinias in surface water. It is
speculated that some aquatic plants might serve as reservoirs for the erwinias and perhaps
their survival is enhanced in natural biofilms that form on rocks and other surfaces within
bodies of surface water. As with R. solanacearum populations detectable in water, the
C. Contamination
population of erwinias was higher at water temperatures above 10–15
of surface water with erwinias may result from entry of drainage water from fields
harbouring decayed tubers. In contrast to R. solanacearum, no data are available on
whether there is a relationship between irrigation with contaminated surface water and
incidence of blackleg, aerial soft rot or stem wet rot. C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus
survives for less than 2 weeks in surface water (van der Wolf and van Beckhoven, 2004).
Contaminated water will only create a risk when there is a source, such as a susceptible
host, that constantly releases high densities of the bacterium into the water. The existence
of such a source is unlikely as C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus has never been found
in surface water.

(cid:2)

27.4.3.4 Through aerosols and rain

Heavy rainfall on infected crops and mechanical destruction of haulms before harvest
cause aerosolization of the erwinia bacteria. Even at low densities of diseased plants, the
density of erwinias in aerosols can be as high as 108 cells/ha. Erwinas have been detected
in aerosols at great distances from infected hosts, indicating that if relative humidity is
high, aerosols persist and can transport the bacterium over long distances. Erwinias were
present in more than 90% of rain samples collected at different times during the year
in Oregon (USA) (Franc et al., 1985). There is no evidence to suggest that the other
bacterial pathogens of potato are also dispersed by aerosols or rain.

Erwinas deposited on leaf surfaces from aerosols may be further distributed to the
below-ground portion of the plant during summer rains. Even symptomless plants may
carry relatively high concentrations of erwinias of 4 × 106 cells/g of plant material
(N.J.M. Roozen, personal communication). The bacteria may multiply to even higher
populations during subsequent decay of contaminated leaves after senescence or after
intentional haulm destruction. As rain water percolates through the soil, the bacteria are
washed on to progeny tubers and serve as an inoculum source for subsequent generations
of potatoes.

27.4.3.5 Through insects

Insects transmit various bacterial pathogens to initiate new crop infections, although
their role in disease epidemiology is limited. Insects acquire contamination with bacterial
phytopathogens simply by mechanical contact, but the bacteria may survive on insects

610

van der Wolf and De Boer

for several days. There is no indication that persistent infections of insects with plant
pathogenic bacteria occurs in the same way as persistent plant viral infections of insect
vectors. Insects can travel large distances in a few days and are specifically attracted
to plant wounds that serve as ideal infection loci. Plant wounds are created by insect
feeding and if the insect mouth parts are contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, it is
an ideal means of spreading infections. In Scotland and Colorado (USA), 15% of flies
in potato-growing areas carried pectolytic erwinias, and those captured near potato cull
dump piles contained up to 106 cells/insect.

27.5 CONTROL

The vascular bacterial diseases of potato can only be controlled by integrating measures
based on exclusion and reduction of seed- or soil-borne inoculum. These measures
include the use of clean seed and implementation of appropriate agronomic practices
during planting, growing, harvesting and storage of potato crops. No chemical compounds
or treatments are available that effectively cure plants from bacterial diseases, but
some physical treatments or bactericides may be useful for reducing inoculum load.
Potato cultivars differ in susceptibility to the various bacterial diseases, but none are
immune. The use of resistant cultivars, therefore, has not been an important component
of strategies to control these diseases. Avoidance of particularly susceptible cultivars is
recommended. Disease-tolerant cultivars present a special hazard in that they may serve
as a reservoir of inoculum unless specific measures are taken to prevent infection.

27.5.1 Use of clean seed

The use of pathogen-free certified seed is the most important element in strategies for
controlling bacterial diseases. Potatoes are not usually propagated from true botanical seed
but rather are propagated from vegetative tubers. It is these vegetative propagules that are
much more likely to carry pathogens from the parent plant than true seed. Not only are
the vascular pathogens present in parent plants likely to be transferred to tubers, but also
are the surface pathogens such as S. scabies migrate from parent plant to progeny tubers.
Because all the bacterial pathogens of potato may be borne on seed tubers, seed
production should preferably start with pathogen-tested stem cuttings or minitubers, for
which risks of contamination with pathogens are considerably reduced. The number of
subsequent field generations should also be limited. In an 8-year survey in the USA,
seed stocks from stem cuttings resulted in 54% of crops being free of symptoms of
bacterial disease compared with an average of 8% for lots not produced from stem cuttings
(Knutson, 1985). When the two groups were compared, 6% of lots grown from stem
cuttings contained at least 0.5% infected tubers, compared with 41% of lots produced
from tubers. With the advent of minituber production technologies, stem cuttings are
rarely used today, but the starting of seed stocks from pathogen-free material remains an
important principle. Because bacterial infections may be latent, it is important that all
plant material used to initiate seed stocks be tested. Many protocols based on serological
or molecular tests are available for each of the bacterial pathogens of potato.

Bacterial pathogens of potato

611

Seed stocks become contaminated with bacterial pathogens during the growing season
in agricultural fields to varying degrees depending on the presence of the pathogen in the
geographic area and inoculum load if present. The level of contamination and infection
increases with each field generation. Hence, field inspections combined with laboratory
assays are required to identify lots that become contaminated or infected beyond tolerance
levels. Elimination of positive lots minimizes the risks for dissemination of bacterial
pathogens through seed.

R. solanacearum and C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus are considered quarantine
pathogens in many countries and are under strict statutory control. There is a zero tolerance
for these pathogens in most seed potato certification programmes. Export of potatoes
into controlled areas usually requires laboratory testing of tubers to ensure freedom from
these pathogens. For detection and identification of R. solanacearum in samples of potato
tubers within the European Union, both dilution plating on a semi-selective agar (SMSA)
medium and immunofluorescence (IF) cell staining can be used for initial screening. The
use of ELISA and TaqMan-PCR tests are optional (EU Council Directive 98/57/EC). For
final verification, R. solanacearum should be isolated and characterized by physiological,
biochemical and pathogenicity tests.

In the European Union, IF is used for initial screening of tubers for C. michiganensis
ssp. sepedonicus, whereas the ELISA test is used in North America. In North America, IF
or PCR is used to confirm the presence of C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus in ELISA
positive lots. However, in the European Union, IF positive samples need to be confirmed
by bioassay in eggplant. Subsequent isolation of C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus from
eggplant and characterization of isolates by serology, PCR using TaqMan chemistry and a
pathogenicity test are required to verify the presence of C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus.
In Europe, the standard sample size for detecting C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus
or R. solanacearum in a lot of seed potatoes is 200 tubers/25 tonnes of potatoes. In North
America, tests for C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus (R. solanacearum does not occur
in the North American potato industry) is usually based on 400 tubers/seed lot. The
probability of detecting C. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus or R. solanacearum, assuming
random distribution of diseased tubers, is a function of sensitivity of the laboratory test,
sample size and incidence of infection. If the sensitivity of the laboratory test is considered
to be 100%, even then there is only a 0.95 probability of detecting these bacteria in a
potato lot with a 200 tuber sample size if more than 1.5% of the tubers in the lot are
infected. Freedom from bacterial infections, therefore, cannot be guaranteed based on
laboratory testing alone (Janse and Wenneker, 2002).

With few exceptions, the pectolytic erwinias are not considered to be quarantine
pathogens. Most seed certification inspection programmes include only an obligatory
field inspection for the foliage manifestations of infections. In some instances, however,
laboratory tests are used to evaluate the health of seed potatoes. Available tests for
specific Erwinia (sub)species include plating on a SMSA medium (e.g. crystal violet
pectate medium), ELISA, enrichment ELISA, immunofluorescence cell or colony staining
and (enrichment) PCR techniques. Serological testing for the erwinias is limited by their
serological heterogeneity; only subpopulations are detected with any one antiserum or
antibody preparation.

27.5.2 Inoculum reduction

Seed tuber treatment for reducing seed-borne inoculum has been considered. Tuber-borne
inoculum can be reduced but not eliminated by heat treatment using hot water, steam
or air or exposure to ultraviolet light. Such treatments are often not practical, however,
and only address surface contamination. Bacteria located internally in tuber tissue are
protected from disinfection. Seed treatment to reduce R. solanacearum and C. michiga-
nensis ssp. sepedonicus contamination levels is not recommended, but such treatments
have been explored for reducing erwinia inoculum. Treatment with hot water for 5 min at
(cid:2)
C followed by forced air-drying resulted in a 99.9% reduction of E. carotovora ssp.
55
atroseptica in artificially contaminated seed tubers (Pérombelon et al., 1989). Similarly,
steam treatment reduced blackleg incidence from 46 to 3% (Afek and Orenstein, 2002).
Longer exposures to high temperature resulted in sprout damage. It is unknown whether
heat treatment can be used for E. chrysanthemi, which is more heat resistant. Treatment
with steam and hot air are preferred to hot water treatment because there is less risk for
cross-contamination and avoids the need for drying after treatment. Efficacy of heat treat-
ment may be due to the direct eradication of surface located pathogens, but it may also
stimulate the production of antibacterial compounds in potato tubers and thereby increase
tuber resistance. Ultraviolet light, even at low dosages, effectively reduced storage rot in
erwinia-inoculated tubers (Ranganna et al., 1997).

Treatment of seed tubers with fungicides provides some control of seed piece decay
and common scab. The fungicides may directly reduce the inoculum level of streptomyces
as well as pathogenic fungi that provide infection sites for the pectolytic erwinia.

In tropical countries, reduction of soil-borne inoculum is particularly important as a
control strategy for R. solanacearum (French, 1994). Soil populations of R. solanacearum
can be reduced by a number of measures including crop rotation, fumigation, solarization,
application of soil amendments, flooding and the roguing of volunteers and weeds that
serve as hosts to the bacterium. To achieve effective control, a combination of different
measures may be integrated.

Crop rotation is used to promote natural decline of soil inoculum. The effect of crop
rotation on bacterial wilt is dependent on the level of inoculum in the soil and the crops
used in the rotation scheme. In Uganda, a 1-year crop rotation with wheat or maize
reduced the bacterial wilt incidence in mildly infested fields from 62 to 13%, but for
heavily infested fields, a two-season rotation was required (Lemaga et al., 2001). In
this study, the greatest wilt reduction was obtained with a potato–beans–maize–potato
rotation. Similarly, in India, a 5-year rotation with wheat, lupin and maize reduced the
wilt incidence considerably (Verma and Shekhawat, 1991), whereas, in Indonesia, a two-
season rotation with pulses, cereals and root crops was effective (Gunadi et al., 1998).
Crop rotation also reduces inoculum levels of scab-inducing streptomycetes. Rotations of
3–4 years reduce the incidence of scab to a relatively constant level but seldom completely
eliminate soil populations of the pathogen.

Some soils are naturally suppressive, due to the presence of a specific, possibly
diversified, microbial community, that results in low incidences of bacterial wilt despite
the presence of the bacterium (Shiomi et al., 1999). The use of soil organic amendments
such as pig manure (Gorissen et al., 2004), sewage sludge (Prior and Beramis, 1990) and

Bacterial pathogens of potato

613

mixtures of agricultural and industrial wastes (Sun and Huang, 1985; Anith et al., 2004),
which contain active compounds such as urea and mineral ash, helps to accelerate the
decline of R. solanacearum populations. Organic amendments have particular potential
for controlling common scab (Lazarovits et al., 2001). Incorporation of high nitrogen-
containing amendments such as soy and bone meal reduced the severity of scab by 90%,
but the disease rebounded in subsequent years. Evidently, soil amendments of this type
not only kills pathogenic bacteria but also enhances the overall soil microbial population
that selectively displaces some organisms and enriches for others.

Soil fumigation with synthetic chemical crop protection agents can reduce soil-borne
R. solanacearum, although results may be variable (Chellemi et al., 1994). Jones et al.
(1995) reported that soils treated with methyl bromide/chloropicrin, chloropicrin, metam-
sodium, dazomet or dichloropropene reduced bacterial wilt incidence in tomato from 92 to
20–48%. Various attempts have been made to reduce soil populations of R. solanacearum
with natural compounds. Thyme, palmorosa and lemongrass oil, volatile essential oils
with antimicrobial properties, are reported to have eliminated R. solanacearum in soil
treated with a concentration of 700 (cid:2)g/l of soil (Pradhanang et al., 2003).

Solarization of soil prior to planting has also been used successfully in reduc-
ing R. solanacearum populations, but it does not achieve eradication of the pathogen
C
(Chellemi et al., 1994; Pradeep and Sood, 2001). Soil temperature increases of 5–12
under polyethylene film used for the solarization treatment have been reported. Reduction
in R. solanacearum populations may be caused, in part, by direct heat killing of the
bacterium, but increased activity of microbial antagonists may also be a factor in reducing
pathogen populations (Pradeep and Sood, 2001). An impact of solarization was found up
to a depth of 15 cm.

(cid:2)

27.5.3 Agronomic practices

As there is a zero tolerance for bacterial ring rot and bacterial wilt (brown rot), seed
stocks in which these diseases occur are normally not used for planting. However, good
agronomic practices are recommended to avoid losses because of pectolytic erwinias
and scab-inducing streptomycetes. Potato production should start with small undamaged
tubers, carefully checked by an experienced inspector. Small tubers disintegrate more
readily than large tubers, thus reducing risks for contaminating progeny tubers during
harvest. When cut seed is used, tuber size is less important as seed pieces usually
disintegrate during the growing season if they contain pectolytic bacteria.

Potatoes should be planted in soils that are well drained and aerated as anaerobic
conditions in the soil negatively affect tuber resistance to decay (Pérombelon and Lowe,
1975; Bain and Pérombelon, 1988). Maintenance of high soil moisture, however, helps
to suppress the incidence of common scab.

Fertilization should be optimized to promote healthy plant growth. Low nitrogen
content will make the crop susceptible to infection, whereas high nitrogen levels will
result in a high nitrate content that promotes multiplication of erwinias (Smid et al.,
1993). High nitrogen levels also stimulates growth of foliage that in turn increases

614

van der Wolf and De Boer

leaf wetness in the canopy providing conditions that are favourable for develop-
ment of aerial stem rot. Soil amendments that increase soil pH should be avoided to
control scab.

Damage to potato haulms must be avoided during hilling and spraying operations as all
injuries or wounds to potato haulms provide places of entry for pathogenic bacteria. As
it is usual to apply fungicides to control late blight up to 4–12 times/season, considerable
crop damage can be done if extreme care is not exercised. Pest control is important,
however, as fungal infections, nematode damage and insect feeding sites allow entry of
bacterial pathogens.

Spread of bacterial contamination within seed stocks often occurs during harvesting
and grading of tubers. The presence of decayed mother or progeny tubers can hardly be
avoided and results in the contamination of equipment with bacteria-laden tuber debris.
A single decayed tuber can contaminate up to 100 kg of potatoes during mechanical
grading (Elphinstone and Pérombelon, 1986). During harvesting and grading, a high
percentage of tubers are damaged or bruised and become particularly susceptible to
infection from contaminated equipment (Pérombelon and Kelman, 1980). Wet harvest
conditions exacerbate tuber damage and spread of inoculum.

(cid:2)

For the first 10–14 days after harvest, potato storage temperature should be modulated
to promote wound healing. Subsequently, the temperature should be decreased to below
C to prevent the growth of fungal and bacterial pathogens. Storages should be well
10
ventilated to prevent formation of condensation on tubers and provide adequate aeration.
Oxygen depletion can be favourable for growth of soft rot bacteria and be inhibitory to
the resistance response of tubers.

27.6 PERSPECTIVES

Globalization has resulted in an increase in international trade of seed potatoes with
concomitant, albeit inadvertent, dissemination of bacterial pathogens in latently infected
tubers. The chances for control and eradication of bacterial diseases after introduction
into new areas largely depend on the available infrastructure enabling their detection
and trace back to source. Availability of adequate instruments to detect and identify the
pathogens along with the means to contain and eradicate infection sources is an important
consideration for addressing new pathogen incursions.

To minimize the impact of bacterial diseases in potato, producers of seed need to
specialize by separating seed production from ware production, optimize agronomic
practices and use strict hygienic measures in both the field and storage components of
their operation. The use of pathogen-tested minitubers should be favoured, and the number
of field generations reduced to limit the build-up of bacterial populations. Monitoring of
inoculum carried in or on seed by laboratory testing is recommended if it can be done in a
cost-effective manner. For seed testing, sampling strategies and robust sensitive detection
methods need to be designed and optimized within quality control systems.

It

is anticipated that advances in knowledge of the genomics, proteomics and
metabolomics of potato and bacterial pathogens will further enhance the possibilities for
control. Genome sequencing has already resulted in the identification of several hitherto

Bacterial pathogens of potato

615

unknown pathogenicity factors (Salanoubat et al., 2002; Bell et al., 2004). Microarray sys-
tems for analysing gene expression and high-throughput systems for protein analysis will
increase understanding of pathogenesis, including factors involved in bacterial survival
strategies, host specificity and the transition from latent to active phase. Deciphering of
genome sequences and extending knowledge of plant pathogen interactions will facilitate
marker-assisted resistance breeding. Additionally, increased knowledge may suggest new
strategies for designing more effective and perhaps systemic bactericides to combat the
bacterial diseases that are so harmful to optimizing potato production.

Viruses: Economical Losses and

Biotechnological Potential

Jari P.T. Valkonen

Department of Applied Biology, University of Helsinki, PO Box 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland

28.1 INTRODUCTION

‘Viruses, because of their tuber-perpetuation and the heavy yield losses they cause, are
the most dangerous parasites of the potato’ (Ross, 1986). The threat of economic losses
caused by viruses is still there, although programmes for the production of certified
seed have drastically reduced the prevalence of viruses in potato crops in many areas.
Detection and identification of viruses have improved with the application of molecular
methods. Efforts to breed for virus-resistant potato cultivars utilizing genes derived from
wild potato germplasm were strongly enforced by Ross, Cockerham and others since
the 1950s. New cultivars with resistance to the most important viruses have helped to
reduce yield losses. However, there are new emerging problems and threats that need
attention. The current negative impact of potato viruses can be illustrated using Potato
virus Y (PVY) as an example. A positive aspect, however, is that potato viruses can be
converted to gene vectors and utilized as tools possessing economic potential. Thus, the
new methods of biotechnology provide these pathogens with positive features, of which
exploitation has just begun.

28.2 VIRUSES INFECTING POTATO

There are some 40 viruses infecting cultivated potatoes in the field. Most of them are
listed in Table 28.1. The polerovirus Potato leafroll virus (PLRV), the potyviruses PVY
and PVA (Fig. 28.1), the carlaviruses PVM and PVS and the potexvirus PVX are widely
distributed in potato-growing areas in different parts of the world. Many other viruses
listed in Table 28.1 also occur in many parts of the world, but in potato only occasionally
or locally. Wild potato mosaic virus (genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae) is not included
in Table 28.1, because it is not known to infect cultivated potatoes (Jones and Fribourg,
1979; Spetz et al., 2003). The vectors and means of transmission of all viruses have
not been studied in potato. Table 28.1 provides information referring to studies carried
out on potato or presumes that the vectors known for a virus also transmit it on potato.
Symptoms caused by viruses in potato are illustrated elsewhere (Jeffries, 1998).

The taxonomy and genome organization of viruses are explained and illustrated in
Fauquet et al. (2005) and at the official home page of the International Committee
on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Most potato-infecting viruses (Table 28.1) have a
positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome that is replicated in cytoplasm
by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Virions are assembled from hundreds to
thousands of viral coat protein (CP) molecules that encapsidate the viral RNA. However,
tospoviruses exemplified by Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) (genus Tospovirus, family

622

Valkonen

Bunyaviridae) contain a negative-sense ssRNA genome of an ambisense nature: open-
reading frames (genes) exist in both reading directions. A third type of RNA genome is
possessed by nucleorhabdoviruses (family Rhabdoviridae) such as Potato yellow dwarf
virus that has a negative-sense ssRNA genome replicated in the nucleus. Tospo- and
nucleorhabdoviruses differ from most RNA viruses also in that their virions are enveloped
by a lipid membrane. A few viruses such as curtoviruses and begomoviruses (family
Geminiviridae) have a single-stranded ambisense DNA genome replicated in the nucleus
by the host DNA polymerase. Their virions are not enveloped.

Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd, Pospiviroidae) is one of the 27 known viroids
(Flores et al., 2005). It is a severe pathogen of potato distributed worldwide. Although
no vector is known for PSTVd, it is readily transmitted by contact and in true potato
seed (Jeffries, 1998). Viroids are the smallest known pathogens and only found infecting
plants. Molecular details of PSTVd will be discussed at the end of this chapter.

28.3 NEW AND EMERGING VIRUSES AND THEIR DETECTION

28.3.1 Molecular detection and identification

Because most potato viruses originate in the Andes, the evolutionary centre of potato
species (Hawkes, 1990; Ochoa, 1999), movement of virus-infected cultivated and wild
potato germplasm constitutes a risk for the dissemination of yet unknown viruses to other
parts of the world. Systematic detection and characterization of viruses infecting potato
species in their natural habitats in Central and South America would be important to
continue, to develop antibodies, primers and probes needed for virus detection during
international movement of germplasm. The International Potato Center (CIP) in Peru has
worked for the characterization of many potato viruses since its establishment 30 years

Viruses

623

ago (Salazar, 1996, 2005). Biology and aetiology of the new viruses are best studied in
the native geographic area, not least for reducing the risk of inadvertant dispersal of the
viruses. The past and continuing efforts of CIP and other institutes in South America are
therefore important.

Contributions of gene banks and virology laboratories in different parts of the world
are needed for the characterization of the less-studied potato viruses. The latest tech-
nologies available for virus detection and characterization have made it increasingly
feasible. Sequence analysis of large numbers of virus isolates is feasible using robotics-
assisted automated sequencing facilities (Ala-Poikela et al., 2005; Allander et al., 2005).
Microarray-based approaches offer the possibility to detect many viruses and virus iso-
lates simultaneously and to distinguish them (Boonham et al., 2003; Bystricka et al.,
2003; Zhang et al., 2005).

Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of viral genes and genomes have become
the most important single criteria used in viral taxonomy (Fauquet et al., 2003, 2005;
Adams et al., 2005). Sequence data alone are sufficient to group virus isolates and often
to determine whether they should be considered the same virus species. Accordingly,
Nisbet et al. (2005) have recently concluded that potato rough dwarf virus and PVP,
independently described in Argentina and Brazil, are isolates of the same carlavirus.
However, sequence data cannot yet be used to predict more than a few biological prop-
erties in a limited number of viruses. Basic research needs to be continued even with
the best characterized potato viruses before the sequence–function relationships are ade-
quately understood. Therefore, biological characterization of viruses and virus isolates in
conjunction with molecular studies remains an important topic.

28.3.2 New viruses

Only a few reports have been published on new viruses in potatoes during the past
10 years. Sequences homologous to Apple latent spherical virus, a nematode-transmitted
virus with a wide host range, were found while analysing a potato cDNA library (Thomp-
son et al., 2004). The host range or other properties of the virus isolate have not yet been
reported. A new isometric virus designated as SB26/29 was found in potatoes in the Andes
in 1990s. It is transmitted by a psyllid vector (Russeliana solanicola) (Salazar, 2005).

One may claim that the reason for lack of reports on new viruses from potato crops
grown outside the Andean region is that most viruses causing economically significant
losses in potato crops have already been detected and described. Also, the economically
insignificant viruses that cause conspicuous symptoms, such as the calico mosaic symp-
toms in potato leaves infected with Alfalfa mosaic virus (Fig. 28.2), have probably been
noticed.

The few reports on new potato viruses may, however, also be a sign of little effort put
on the detection of new viruses in potato crops. There may be viruses that cause mild
or no symptoms and are hard to notice when occasionally infecting potatoes. However,
such viruses could become a considerable problem if agricultural practices, cultivars or
climatic conditions or other agroecological factors change. One possible threat could be
Columbian Datura virus (CDV) (Verhoeven et al., 1996) that was recently found in
PVY-resistant tobacco cultivars in Poland, Germany and Hungary. It has also been found

in Datura plants in gardens in Poland. Of more than 50 potato cultivars tested by Prof.
M. Chrzanowska at IHAR, Poland, 30 were systemically infected, displaying necrosis,
yellowing and conspicuous collapse or breaking of stems, depending on the cultivar. The
virus is tuber-transmitted (M. Chrzanowska, personal communication). As tobacco and
potato cultivation coincide temporally and spatially in Poland and many other areas, virus
transmission between the crops is possible. It would be worthwhile to pay more attention
to viruses that infect potatoes occasionally.

28.3.3 Emerging viruses

Viruses transmitted by whiteflies or thrips have become more and more prevalent in crops
grown in tropical and subtropical parts of the world (Anderson et al., 2004). Reasons are
not fully understood, but the increased abundance of viruses is associated with increasing
prevalence of their whitefly vectors. Another example of emerging diseases, albeit not
caused by a virus, is the relatively fast expansion of insect-transmitted phytoplasma in
potato crops grown in the USA, for which reasons are unknown (Secor et al., 2005).

28.3.3.1 DNA viruses

Members of the genus Begomovirus (family Geminiviridae) cause vast yield losses in
solanaceous and leguminous crops, such as tomato and beans, in Central and South
America. They are transmitted by the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius). The number
of approved and tentative virus species in genus Begomovirus has increased to nearly 200
and approaches the number of potyviruses, the largest group of plant-infecting viruses

Viruses

625

(Fauquet et al., 2005). Taxonomy of begomoviruses is complicated by recombination
between virus strains and species in co-infected plants. Recombination results in new
strains and species that are sometimes hard to classify taxonomically because they show
the closest sequence homology with different viruses, depending on which genomic region
is used for comparison (Rojas et al., 2005). New virus recombinants may acquire an
ability to infect new hosts (Monci et al., 2002).

In Cuba, the begomovirus Tomato mottle Taino virus infects potatoes in the field and
is tuber-transmitted (Cordero et al., 2003). Potato yellow mosaic virus (PYMV), another
begomovirus, causes yellowing and leaf malformation in potatoes in Venezuela. It is
probably synonymous to tomato yellow mosaic virus described in the Caribbean region
(Morales et al., 2001; Fauquet et al., 2003; Urbino et al., 2004). Potato deforming mosaic
virus is a tentative begomovirus that was described in potato in Brazil. It is probably
synonymous to tomato yellow vein streak virus (Ribeiro et al., 2005). Solanum apical
leaf curl virus is a tentative begomovirus infecting potatoes in Peru (Table 28.1).

Until now, there are relatively few reports on begomoviruses infecting potato crops.
For example, no begomovirus was detected in potatoes in a recent survey in Nicaragua
where tomato production has been devastated by begomoviruses (Ala-Poikela et al.,
2005). The native wild vegetation acts as a reservoir of the begomoviruses, but specific
hosts are unknown. Some of the begomoviruses in tomato infect also potatoes and are
tuber-transmitted when experimentally inoculated (Rojas et al., 2005).

Taken together, recent data suggest that begomoviruses may threaten potato crops
in warm climates where potato growing is currently expanding. It would be important
to understand why begomoviruses have not yet caused epidemics in potato, despite an
abundance of the same whiteflies in potato crops and the adjacent begomovirus-infected
tomato cultivations in potato growing areas, for example in Nicaragua. Understanding
the reasons might help to plan precautionary actions to prevent begomoviruses from
becoming a problem in potato.

28.3.3.2 RNA viruses

Potato yellow vein is a disease known for a long time in cultivated potatoes in the
Andean region, but the disease has only recently become widespread and devastating
(Salazar et al., 2000). Potato yellow vein virus (PYVV) is the causal agent and was
identified as a member of family Closteroviridae, most closely resembling members
of genus Crinivirus (Salazar et al., 2000; Livieratos et al., 2004). PYVV is transmit-
ted by the whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood. It is also tuber-transmitted,
albeit not very efficiently. Many infected tubers produce symptomless plants (Salazar
et al., 2000).

Tomato spotted wilt virus has the largest host range of known plant viruses and occurs
in all continents (EPPO, 1997). It is transmitted by western flower thrips, Frankliniella
occidentalis, and infects many solanaceous hosts, including potato. Introduction of this
vector species to new areas has led to problems also with TSWV. The virus is one of the
most important potato pathogens in Australia (R.A.C. Jones, personal communication)
and infects potatoes also in many other parts of the world (e.g. Al Shahwan et al., 1997;
Abad et al., 2005). Other tospoviruses have also recently begun to occur in potato crops
in warm climates (C. Jeffries, personal communication).

28.4 ECONOMIC IMPACT OF PVY

PVY is the type member of genus Potyvirus, the largest group of plant viruses containing
128 approved and 89 tentative species (Rajamäki et al., 2004; Fauquet et al., 2005).
Many potato viruses, including PVY, are transmitted non-persistently by many aphid
species. In non-persistent transmission, only a few seconds to minutes are needed for
virus acquisition and inoculation. Therefore, the most important vectors for these viruses
in potato crops are often those that do not colonize potato. The aphids only land to
probe, reject the leaf as a site for feeding and move further and hence disseminate the
viruses efficiently. Aphicides do not efficiently prevent transmission but may increase
the restless behaviour of aphids and thereby virus transmission. Therefore, the spread of
PVY is difficult to control in the field unless resistant cultivars (Fig. 28.3) are grown
(De Bokx and van der Want, 1987). Repeated treatment of foliage with mineral oil reduces
virus transmission but may also reduce plant growth (Kurppa and Hassi, 1989). Helpful
guidelines for control of aphid-transmitted viruses in potatoes have been provided by
Evans (2000).

PVY is considered to be economically the most harmful virus in cultivated pota-
toes, a position that used to be held by PLRV. Relative importance of PLRV has
decreased owing to the statutory production schemes for healthy seed and breeding for
PLRV-resistant varieties. In the northernmost areas of Europe, PVY is the only aphid-
transmitted virus still causing yield losses in potato crops (Fig. 28.4) (Tapio et al.,
1997). Also in South America, the origin of cultivated potato, relative importance of
PLRV has decreased as compared with PVY (L.F. Salazar, personal communication). At
the same time, new strains of PVY have evolved or spread to new geographical areas
(Beczner et al., 1984; McDonald and Kristijansson, 1993; Le Romancer et al., 1994;
Piche et al., 2004). Australia is exceptional in that PVY has never caused significant
problems to potato production there (Bald and Norris, 1945; R.A.C. Jones, personal
communication).

The evidence for viruses being an important cause of cultivar degeneration
(Salaman, 1921) gave a shove to systematic breeding for new, virus-resistant potato
varieties (Davidson, 1980; Ross, 1986; Bradshaw and Mackay, 1994). Crosses
made by J. Wilson in St. Andrews, Scotland,
in 1912–1919 resulted in cv. Cru-
sader
that marked the beginning of a new generation of PLRV- and PVY-
resistant potato varieties bred using genes from wild potato species (Davidson,
1980). PLRV and PVY (and also PVX) have been ever since the main targets
because of their high ability to reduce yields (Andersen, 1956; Arenz and Hunnius,
1959; Kolbe, 1981), but combining resistance to them with the desired agronomic traits
has been challenging (Davidson, 1980; Ross, 1986).

Only a few recent studies provide quantitative data on the yield losses caused by viruses
in potato and even fewer on losses specifically caused by PVY in the field. Perhaps,
once the negative impact of viruses was generally accepted, it became gradually less
important to do trials for demonstrating the yield losses. However, there are also well-
known difficulties in quantifying yield losses caused by viruses in the field (Waterworth
and Hadidi, 1998). To fill in the gap of recent data on the economic impact of PVY,
30 potato virologists and seed potato experts were contacted in different parts of the

world. The information obtained is quoted in the following sections, with permission. In
a few countries, no detailed data were available, but as such, even this was significant to
know because it revealed that more information is needed about the local impact of PVY
in some areas.

28.4.1 Mixed infections

Mixed virus infections are common in the field, which complicates the estimation of the
proportion of losses caused by PVY (Lihnell et al., 1975; Kolbe, 1981), because PVY and
other potyviruses may synergize unrelated viruses in co-infected plants. Consequently,
symptoms and yield losses caused by the other viruses may be enhanced (Anandalakshmi
et al., 1998; Moissiard and Voinnet, 2004). Interactions between PVY and PVX in tobacco
are the classical examples of viral synergism (Rochow and Ross, 1955; Vance, 1991) and
have been reported also in potato plants (Stone, 1936; Bald, 1945).

28.4.2 Impact of primary and secondary infection

Growth reduction, yield losses and the proportion of progeny tubers that becomes infected
following the current season (primary) infection with PVY depend on the time of infection
in relation to the growth stage. The impacts of cultivar and virus strain are discussed in
Section 28.4.4.

Multiplication and subsequent translocation from the initially infected cell are the
steps of viral infection cycle needed for significant symptom development (Fig. 28.3).
Virus transport occurs according to the source–sink partitioning of photoassimilates and
results in systemic infection of the sink tissues (Haywood et al., 2002). Consequently,
symptoms such as mosaic, rugosity, epinasty and malformation are induced in developing
leaves and leaf tissues. The symptoms are a manifestation of the disturbed physiology and
development, which potyviruses cause by interfering with host gene expression (Wang
and Maule, 1995; Teycheney and Tepfer, 2001; Kasschau et al., 2003). Young plants are
most susceptible and severely affected in their growth and development. Indeed, infection
at an early growth stage results in the biggest yield losses. During maturation, plants
become gradually less susceptible to infection, less suitable for virus propagation and less
efficient in transporting the virus from leaves to tubers (Gibson, 1991). The phenomenon
has been coined as mature plant resistance (Beemster, 1987). Thus, delayed infection in
relation to the developmental stage reduces yield losses.

The biggest losses are experienced when the crop is grown from PVY-infected seed
(secondary infection; Fig. 28.4) (Kurppa and Hassi, 1989; Anonymous, 1999; Locke
et al., 1999; Hane and Hamm, 1999). Combined data from 31 cultivars indicated that
the yield obtained using PVY-infected seed (incidence of infected tubers not reported)
was 50–85% less than the yield of non–PVY-infected plants in a pot trial (Arenz and
Hunnius, 1959). If all seed tubers of cvs Bintje, Matilda and Sabina were infected with
PVYO or PVYN, yield reduction was 29–59% depending on the cultivar–virus strain
combination (Kurppa and Hassi, 1989). Cultivars Shepody and Russet Norkotah show
only mild symptoms when infected with PVY; however, plants grown from PVY-infected

Viruses

629

tubers suffered approximately 30–50 and 45–50% yield reduction, respectively, depending
on the trial and year (PVY strain was not specified). Marketable yield was reduced by
approximately 55–80 and 65%, respectively (Hane and Hamm, 1999).

In the field, a low PVY incidence does not always result in yield reduction because the
poor growth of infected plants may be compensated for by the neighbouring healthy plants
that gain from the additional space (Kurppa and Hassi, 1989; Anonymous, 1999). Hence,
in Sweden, it is considered that yield reduction (%) caused by PVY= 0(cid:2)5×(cid:3)(cid:4)−10(cid:5), where
(cid:4) is the percentage of PVY-infected plants in the crop (H. Bång, personal communication).
This agrees well with the estimated 10–15% yield reduction that would be expected if
the incidence of PVY-infected seed tubers was 30% in Spain (J. Legorburu, personal
communication). It also agrees with the negligible yield loss with 10–20% PVY-infected
seed tubers in Finland (Kurppa and Hassi, 1989). However, no yield compensation was
observed in a study carried out in North America where PVY was found to spread quickly
to the neighbouring virus-free plants. The neighbouring plants that were infected also
suffered from yield reduction, albeit to a much lesser extent than the plants that grew
from PVY-infected seed (Hane and Hamm, 1999). With a high incidence of secondary
infection (poor-quality seed), no compensation is expected.

Taken all aforementioned variables to consideration, PVY is estimated to account for
45% of the losses because of diseases in potato production in the UK (Anonymous, 1999).
Many authors have independently arrived at an estimated annual loss of £30–40 million
there (Anonymous, 1999; I. Barker, personal communication).

28.4.3 Costs to seed production

Owing to the devastating effect of secondary infections on yield, there is a threshold
for incidence of PVY (or ‘severe viruses’ including PVY) allowed in certified seed. The
threshold value is set according to the anticipated yield loss caused by PVY under the
local conditions. Infection pressure and possibilities to control the spread of PVY also
need to be considered. For example, the naturally low virus infection pressure in the
seed production zone close to the polar circle in Finland allows setting the limit to 2%
PVY-infected tubers in the highest class (class A) of certified seed. Despite the stringent
threshold value, less than 1% of the seed crops are usually rejected due to virus infections
(statistics of the Finnish Seed Testing Institute; H. Kortemaa, personal communication).
On the contrary, in the Czech Republic, 5–20% of the seed potato crops are rejected
because of a too high incidence of viruses, PVY being the predominant one (P. Dˇediˇc,
personal communication). If the crop cannot be certified for seed, it may be used for ware
potato or other commercial purposes, depending on the market situation. However, the
price depends on the purpose of use and is the highest for seed potatoes. Therefore, to
avoid rejection, seed crops need to be inspected and symptomatic plants rogued during the
growing season. Symptomless infections in some cultivars, especially by PVYN, hamper
this practice. Haulm killing may also be needed to decrease virus translocation from
foliage to tubers (Beemster, 1987). The costs related to virus-control measures (roguing,
mineral oil sprays and haulm killing) may be E300 per hectare in France (Y. Le Hingrat,
personal communication). Following harvest, tuber lots must be virus-tested and certified
in accordance with official regulations, causing additional costs to the seed grower.

630

Valkonen

Taken together, certification of seed crops for sufficient freedom from PVY (and
the other important potyvirus, PVA, and other severe viruses) causes significant costs
in the potato production chain before the actual main crop is grown for other pur-
poses. Although these costly effectors are necessary for maintaining high productivity of
potato crops, they are a burden to the economic profitability and accumulate in product
prices.

28.4.4 Yield loss depending on cultivar resistance and PVY strain

Potato varieties expressing extreme resistance (ER) that inhibits multiplication of all
PVY strains (Barker and Harrison, 1984; Ross, 1986), or strain-specific hypersensitive
resistance (HR) (Fig. 28.3) that restricts infection to the inoculated leaves (Jones, 1990),
are protected against growth reduction and transmission of PVY to progeny tubers (Ross,
1986; Valkonen, 1994; Anonymous, 1999). Cultivars that develop mature plant resistance
quickly are less prone to suffer from a high incidence of virus-infected progeny tubers
(Beemster, 1987; Gibson, 1991). Therefore, production of qualified, certified seed is more
feasible from resistant than susceptible varieties.

However, in many varieties and under elevated temperatures, HR may fail to restrict the
movement of PVY. Consequently, systemic infection with strains PVYO(cid:6) PVYC or PVYZ,
recognized by different resistance genes (Jones, 1990), will cause extensive necrosis,
leaf-drop symptoms (Fig. 28.4) and even plant death (Dykstra, 1939; Bald and Norris,
1945; Valkonen et al., 1998). Potato cultivars do not express HR to the tobacco veinal
necrosis strain of PVY (cid:3)PVYN(cid:5), which, in general, causes mild or no foliar symptoms
in potato plants. However, growth reduction and yield losses caused by PVYN may be
substantial, similar to those observed with other PVY strains that induce more severe
foliar symptoms (Kurppa and Hassi, 1989; Anonymous, 1999).

Variants of PVYN designated as PVYNTN can induce superficial necrotic symptoms on
tubers, which causes quality losses (Beczner et al., 1984). The symptoms are different from
those of two soil-borne viruses: the corky ringspot symptoms caused by the nematode-
transmitted Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) and the spraing symptoms caused by Potato
mop-top virus (PMTV) that is transmitted by the powdery scab pathogen, Spongospora
subterranea (Jeffries, 1998). Symptom development following PVYNTN infection depends
on many factors, all of which are not yet fully elucidated (Le Romancer et al., 1994;
Browning et al., 2004). The biological and genetic variability of PVY has been recently
reviewed (Glais et al., 2002a), but until now, it is unclear which genomic region of PVY
is responsible for the tuber necrosis symptoms. Thus, specific detection of PVYNTN using
molecular methods is not yet possible.

Certain cultivars typically respond with tuber necrosis to infection with PVYNTN
(Browning et al., 2004). Tolerance to PVYNTN has become an important criterion in the
selection of new cultivars. Sensitive varieties are avoided (Y. Hingrat, personal commu-
nication). For example, cv. Yukon Gold was abandoned from use in France because of its
high sensitivity to PVYNTN (C. Kerlan, personal communication). The physiological basis
of tuber necrosis waits to be elucidated. A host mechanism that resembles interferon-
mediated virus defence in mammals recognizes dsRNA (replicative form of virus) and
triggers death of virus-infected cells in plants. However, potyviruses can suppress this

Viruses

631

mechanism with their helicase (CI) protein, and, consequently, infected plants develop
only mild symptoms (Bilgin et al., 2003). PVYN typically causes only mild symptoms
in potato plants. Therefore, one possibility is that PVYNTN contains mutations in CI
and cannot inhibit host defence and cell death, unlike PVYN. The second possibility is
that potatoes recognize dsRNA and defend against viruses also by a mechanism called
RNA silencing (Voinnet, 2005). RNA silencing targets viral RNA to degradation without
disturbing cellular physiology. However, viruses suppress RNA silencing with specific
proteins, such as the helper component proteinase (HCpro) of potyviruses (Brigneti et al.,
1998). The viral silencing suppressors sometimes induce necrosis when over-expressed or
expressed from a heterologous viral genome in plants (Yelina et al., 2002; Kreuze et al.,
2005). Indeed, tobacco veinal necrosis symptoms caused by PVYN are attributable to
HCpro-mediated physiological effects (Tribodet et al., 2005). It is therefore not excluded
that HCpro is the virulence factor of PVYNTN causing tuber necrosis symptoms. The
third possibility is that the necrotic symptoms are associated with an HR-like response
controlled by as yet unknown resistance-like genes recognizing PVYNTN. This would not
be unexpected because many potato cultivars currently grown are offspring from inter-
specific hybrids (Davidson, 1980; Ross, 1986; Bradshaw and Mackay, 1994) including
wild potato species that respond with HR to PVYN (Singh et al., 1994; Valkonen, 1997).
The unexpected occurrence of PVYNTN in imported potato seed in northern Italy
in 1997 illustrated the economic losses caused by this virus strain (Tomassoli et al.,
1998; L. Tomassoli and A. Sonnino, personal communication). The crop was grown for
chips. Yield was reduced by 28% (6000 tonnes) because of the secondary virus infection
(percentage infected seed tubers unknown). Increased waste during processing resulted
in an additional 5% loss of the yield. Owing to poor quality, 17% of the yield was
processed to flour or flakes instead of chips. In total, economic losses were estimated to be
E1(cid:2)4 million.

28.4.5 Aetiology and evolutionary perspectives

PVY is hard to eradicate because potatoes are also widely grown in home gardens.
Subsistence crops may act as reservoirs of PVY in many production areas. However, the
most important initial PVY sources for vectors are the PVY-infected potato plants within
the crop. These plants may originate from infected seed tubers or the volunteers remaining
in the field from the previous crop. Other solanaceous crops and weeds infectible with
PVY are potential reservoirs (Glais et al., 2002a). Transmission of PVY from tobacco
crops to potato and vice versa may be a significant problem in some areas (Glais et al.,
2002a; M. Chrzanowska, personal communication). However, usually, the PVY isolates
infecting, for example tomato and pepper, show reduced virulence in potato (Gebre
Selassie et al., 1985; Marte et al., 1991).

Exchange of PVY isolates between host species and genotypes is likely to increase
genetic and biological variability of PVY, because host-driven selection (host adaptation)
is one of the major forces shaping virus populations (García-Arenal et al., 2001). Mutations
occur at a high rate during RNA virus replication, which results in a population of nearly
identical genotypes, the so-called quasispecies (Smith et al., 1997). The viral genotypes
most fit in the host will become predominant over time (Drake and Holland, 1999;

632

Valkonen

García-Arenal et al., 2001). Recombination between nearly identical viral mutants and
genotypes of a viral quasispecies may result in new virus strains that cause distinctly
different symptoms, as shown with PVA (Paalme et al., 2004). This is also evidenced
with the PVY variant ‘Wilga’ found in the field (Glais et al., 2002b) and the artificial
chimeras of PVYN and PVYO (Tribodet et al., 2005).

Clonal propagation of potato by tubers and tuber transmissibility of viruses allow
viruses to remain in the same potato plant for years, and viral quasispecies may be
genetically stabilized. However, the use of virus-certified seed enforces the more typical
potyvirus infection cycle involving aphid-transmission from plant to plant. Exchange of
PVY isolates between potato cultivars (genotypes) exposes the virus to host selection,
which is accelerated by the introduction of new cultivars.

Taken together, properly executed potato production reduces the prevalence of PVY,
which is crucial for economical profitability, but it also includes elements that may
increase the variability of PVY. Evolution of PVY in cultivated potato could be largely
prevented by breeding and using potato cultivars that carry genes for ER and inhibit
PVY multiplication in the initially infected cells (Barker and Harrison, 1984; Ross, 1986;
Jones, 1990; Valkonen, 2002).

28.5 INFECTIOUS cDNA CLONES OF POTATO VIRUSES AND THEIR

USE AS BIOTECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS

Potato viruses are an economical burden and a risk factor in potato production. However,
they also possess some potential as biotechnological tools. They can be used to express
heterologous proteins in plants, for example for pharmaceutical purposes. They can
also be used to reveal functions of plant genes based on a reverse-genetics approach,
which is achieved by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) (see chapter 30, Millam, this
volume). Thus, potato viruses can be considered as a valuable natural resource for certain
purposes.

28.5.1 Use of potato viruses as gene vectors

PVX was the first potato virus tagged with marker genes. A bacterial (cid:4)-glucuronidase
(cid:3)(cid:4)-GUS) gene and an Aquorea victoria (jellyfish) gene for green fluorescent protein
(GFP) (Chapman et al., 1992; Baulcombe et al., 1995) were inserted in the PVX genome
to study the viral infection process. Similarly, PLRV (Nurkiyanova et al., 2000), PVA
(Ivanov et al., 2003; Rajamäki et al., 2005) and PMTV (Zamyatnin et al., 2004) have been
tagged with GFP to monitor the viral infection cycle non-invasively. Hence, cells and
tissues infected with the GFP-tagged virus can be detected and monitored under hand-held
UV light or using fluorescence microscopy during the course of infection (Roberts et al.,
1997). Sub-cellular localization of the virus or specific viral proteins can be detected with
confocal microscopy (Zamyatnin et al., 2004).

Expression of non-viral proteins from viral genomes demonstrates the possibility of
using potato viruses as biotechnological tools. For example, production of biopharma-
ceutical proteins in plants reduces production costs and allows utilization of a eukaryotic

Viruses

633

cellular environment free from human pathogens (Gleba et al., 2004). Biopharmaceuticals
can be produced in transgenic plants, but utilization of a viral vector allows much faster
production (a few days to weeks) and is versatile because production can be carried out
in different species and cultivars, depending on the needs.

PVX has been used for many applications, for example production of human epidermal
growth factor (Wirth et al., 2004) and a partial lactoferrin protein (Li et al., 2004).
The foreign protein can be expressed on the surface of the PVX particle, which allows
harvesting the recombinant protein in high yields using virus purification protocols (Santa
Cruz et al., 1996). PVA has been utilized to express human catechol-O-methyltransferase
(S-COMT) in plants, yielding 0.9% of S-COMT in the total leaf proteins (Kelloniemi
et al., 2006).

Vector viruses can be used in transgenic plants to remove selectable marker genes
that are unnecessary after plant regeneration and sometimes risky for environmental
reasons. This is achieved using the Cre–lox recombination system. Expression of the Cre
recombinase from a PVX vector in transgenic plants catalysed recombination between
the repeated lox sequences, which removed the bar marker gene inserted between the lox
sites (Kopertekh et al., 2004).

PVX-based vectors are used in studies on RNA silencing (e.g. Brigneti et al., 1998;
Thomas et al., 2001; Kreuze et al., 2005) and functional genomics (Lu et al., 2003).
VIGS is used for the inhibition of gene expression, which allows elucidating functions of
the genes. PVX suits for this purpose in potato (Faivre-Rampant et al., 2004). Infectious
cDNA of TRV is used for similar purposes (Ratcliff et al., 2001). Using the TRV vector,
silencing of endogenous potato genes, including several disease resistance genes, was
achieved (Brigneti et al., 2004).

One of the future applications of potato viruses and PSTVd sequences may be their
utilization in the regulation of plant gene expression, owing to the ability of certain viral
proteins to suppress or interfere with specific stages of RNA silencing (Voinnet, 2005)
and the ability of specific PSTVd sequences to direct RNA silencing against host genes
(Wang et al., 2004).

28.5.2 Studies on viral infection cycle using infectious cDNAs of potato viruses

The primary reason to prepare infectious cDNA clones of viruses is to construct chimeric,
point-mutated and/or marker gene-tagged variants that can be used to critically show
which functional roles are played by the different genomic regions and viral proteins dur-
ing the infection cycle. The knowledge on these molecular details will enable combating
the infection cycle at different stages using natural or engineered virus resistance and
may also turn out to be useful for control of virus transmission.

Preparation of an infectious cDNA of new viruses is no trivial task, despite the expe-
rience gained on many unrelated viruses over the past 20 years. A significant invention
was made by Johansen (1996) who inserted a plant intron to the viral cDNA, to interrupt
an open-reading frame and to alleviate problems during cloning in bacterial cells. This
strategy is now used for cloning large viral cDNAs.

28.5.2.1 Potato virus Y

The important questions on avirulence factors, symptom determinants and virus–host
interactions have recently become possible to be resolved in PVY from which an infectious
viral cDNA is now available (Moury et al., 2004). Many attempts with limited success
were made by many researchers in the past. The construct that finally marked a break
through was relatively cumbersome in use because it was difficult to clone in the bacterial
vectors (Jakab et al., 1997). However, it was used to elucidate the viral determinants
associated with veinal necrosis caused by PVYN in tobacco plants. This was accomplished
using chimeric viruses made of PVYN and PVYO, which revealed that amino acids 400
and 419 of HCpro were critical for the induction of vein necrosis in tobacco (Tribodet
et al., 2005).

This intron insertion strategy worked to solve the problems with cloning of PVY
cDNA. Three introns were required for overcoming cloning problems in Escherichia coli
(Moury et al., 2004).

Two infectious PVY cDNAs were made by Moury et al. (2004), one from a PVY
isolate obtained from tomato and another one from pepper. Subsequently, mutagenesis of
the cDNAs identified the viral genome-linked protein (VPg) as an avirulence determinant
corresponding to the recessive PVY resistance genes pot-1 and pvr2 in Lycopersicon
hirsutum and pepper (Capsicum annuum), respectively (Moury et al., 2004). No studies
on potato plants have yet been published using the infectious PVY cDNA.

28.5.2.2 Potato virus X

Potato virus X was the first potato virus, of which an infectious cDNA was made
(Chapman et al., 1992). The infectious cDNA was instrumental in identifying the PVX
avirulence genes corresponding to the potato resistance genes Nx, Nb and Rx. The CP
of PVX elicits Nx and Rx (Goulden and Baulcombe, 1993; Santa Cruz and Baulcombe,
1995), whereas the 25K movement protein triggers Nb (Malcuit et al., 1999). The data
provided a molecular explanation from the viral side to the gene-for-gene resistance
conferred by these resistance genes (Cockerham, 1970) and also to the PVX strain group
concept (Cockerham, 1955).

The non–protein-encoding regions of PVX control viral replication, which was revealed
using mutated infectious PVX cDNAs (Kim and Hemenway, 1996; Pillai-Nair et al.,
2003). Cell-to-cell movement of PVX requires co-ordinated activities of three viral pro-
teins encoded by the so-called triple gene block (TGB), as shown with infectious chimera
of PVX (Morozov et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2000; Tamai and Meshi, 2001; Schepetilnikov
et al., 2005).

PVX is contact-transmitted between plants and has no vector. However, only a few
amino acid substitutions in PVX CP would be needed for aphid transmissibility from
plants also infected with PVY. The CP DAG motif is known for its essential role in
transmission of potyvirus particles by aphids (Atreya et al., 1991). However, for particles
to be transmitted, the potyviral HCpro has to be acquired before the virions (Govier and
Kassanis, 1974), which materializes in PVY-infected cells. The N-proximal end of PVX
CP was substituted for that of Potato aucuba mosaic virus (PAMV), a potexvirus which
contains a DAG amino acid motif. Consequently, the chimeric PVX (Baulcombe et al.,

Viruses

635

1993), like non-engineered PAMV (Kassanis and Govier, 1971), was aphid transmissible
if aphids were first fed on a PVY-infected plant.

28.5.2.3 Potato virus A

Mutagenesis of the infectious cDNA of PVA (Puurand et al., 1996) confirmed that the
DAG motif in CP is necessary for aphid transmissibility (Andrejeva et al., 1999). The
VPg of PVA regulates accumulation and movement of PVA in plants, but the amino
acids that are significant differ depending on the host species (Rajamäki and Valkonen,
1999, 2002). Several PVA proteins have co-ordinated activities during viral propagation
and movement (Andrejeva et al., 1999; Hämäläinen et al., 2000; Paalme et al., 2004). On
the contrary, the small break 6-kDa protein (6K2) of PVA controls viral long distance
movement and symptom induction functions independently (Spetz and Valkonen, 2004).
All protein-encoding and non-coding regions of PVA contain essential and non-essential
sites for virus propagation, which was revealed by the analysis of 1125 mutants of the
infectious PVA cDNA (Kekarainen et al., 2002).

28.5.2.4 Potato leafroll virus

Infectious cDNAs of PLRV are available (Nurkiyanova et al., 2000; Kawchuk et al., 2002).
However, relatively little has been reported about transmission or virus–host interactions
of PLRV using them. Recently, Lee et al. (2005) showed that a loop protruding from the
surface of PLRV CP controls many viral functions, such as virus assembly, long-distance
movement in cultivated potato (cv. Russet Burbank) and indicator plants and movement
through the aphid vector.

Spread of PLRV and other members of genus Polerovirus in the field is dependent on
aphids that transmit PLRV in a persistent manner (i.e. for their lifetime) (Taliansky et al.,
2003; Stevens et al., 2005). Vector aphids are specifically attracted to PLRV-infected
potato plants, probably because of volatiles that are induced following PLRV infection.
In contrast, aphids are not attracted to plants infected with PVY or PVX (Eigenbrode
et al., 2002). It would be worthwhile to resolve, using the infectious cDNA of PLRV,
which PLRV proteins are responsible for induction of the aphid attractant. It would help
identification of the host factors involved and their removal or suppression using methods
of molecular breeding.

28.5.2.5 Potato mop-top virus

PMTV is a soil-borne virus that induces necrotic symptoms (spraing) in potato tubers,
causes heavy yield losses in northern Europe, especially in Scandinavia, and is very
difficult to control (Sandgren et al., 2002). An infectious cDNA made of the tripartite
genome of PMTV has been used to show that PMTV can spread cell-to-cell and sys-
temically in plants without CP, virions or even the CP-encoding RNA2 (Savenkov et al.,
2003). The TGB proteins 2 and 3 of PMTV show co-ordinated functions, as they mediate
the subcellular localization and cell-to-cell movement of TGB protein 1. These results
were validated using the infectious PMTV cDNA from which a GFP-tagged TGB pro-
tein 1 was expressed in the infection foci (Zamyatnin et al., 2004). Hence, experimental

636

Valkonen

artefacts sometimes experienced with over-expressed viral proteins could be excluded.
The necrosis-inducing capacity of the PMTV 8K protein in Nicotiana spp. (Lukhovit-
skaya et al., 2005) suggests that this protein may be a virulence factor involved in the
induction of necrotic symptoms also in potato tubers.

28.5.2.6 Potato spindle tuber viroid

The viroid PSTVd was the first potato pathogen for which the whole genomic sequence
was cloned and determined (Gross et al., 1978; Dickson et al., 1979). The genome of
PSTVd consists of a rod-shaped, circular ssRNA molecule of 356–360 nucleotides that
contains characteristic secondary structures with functional importance (Flores et al.,
1999). Viroids are the smallest known plant pathogens, but still many of their functions
remain unknown. One of their most puzzling features is that they do not encode proteins
but mediate their functions through direct viroid RNA–cellular factor interactions. Muta-
tional analysis of PSTVd (cDNA) has revealed several genomic regions important for
replication and symptom induction (Qi and Ding, 2003; Wang et al., 2004; and references
therein).

The use of a PSTVd cDNA allows the initiation of infection with a single viroid
genotype. Thus, the factors affecting viroid variability during replication can be addressed
critically. Studies on influence of the host and temperature on variability of PSTVd
showed that the viroid quasispecies is dynamic: higher temperatures increased the number
of mutants, and a new population of viroid quasispecies developed following transmission
of the old population to a new host species (Matoušek et al., 2004).

Potato spindle tuber viroid is transmitted in true potato seed by contact, besides the
infected seed tubers. However, there is evidence indicating that PSTVd RNA can get
encapsidated in the particles of velvet tobacco mottle virus (genus Sobemovirus) (Francki
et al., 1986) and PLRV (Querci et al., 1997) in plants co-infected with PSTVd and the
virus. Heteroencapsidation of PSTVd in virus particles would allow the transmission of
PSTVd with the virus vectors, which in turn has important epidemiological implications.
It would seem worthwhile to re-address these questions as infectious cDNAs of PLRV
are currently available and determinants for virion assembly are being elucidated, as
discussed above.

Taken together, the application of molecular methods on research of potato viruses
using infectious viral cDNAs continues to reveal many important details and mecha-
nisms, which can be used to enhance virus control and exploitation of the viruses in
biotechnological applications.

Fungal and Fungus-Like Pathogens of Potato

Aad J. Termorshuizen

Biological Farming Systems Group, Wageningen University, Marijkeweg 22, 6709 PG Wageningen,

The Netherlands

There are several fine and recent overviews of fungal and fungus-like pathogens of potato
(Stevenson et al., 2001; Mulder and Turkensteen, 2005). In addition, several monographic
assays of the major pathogens are available (referred to in this chapter). Here, I intend to
provide a concise overview of these pathogens including the correct names, names used
as synonyms, major references and a short characterization of each pathogen.

Among the 33 species listed, Puccinia piettieriana, Phoma andigena, Thecaphora
solani and Septoria lycopersici var. malagutii are considered A1 and Synchytrium
endobioticum A2 quarantine organisms according to EPPO (2004). All A1 pathogens
are limited to the region of origin of the potato. Among these quarantine organisms,
P. andigena and S. endobioticum are soil-borne pathogens and the other species are
air-borne. It is remarkable that only little research has been performed on the A1 quar-
antine species. Two other species occurring only in South America might receive quar-
antine status, namely Aecidium cantense and Phoma crystalliniformis, although current
regulations for the already quarantined species probably will prevent spread of these
pathogens too.

A minority of eight (24%) of the described species is air-borne. Of these, five species
inflict great actual (Alternaria solani and Phytophthora infestans) or potential (P. piet-
tieriana, S. lycopersici var. malagutii and T. solani) damage. Among the 25 species
listed as soil-borne, the majority has a worldwide distribution (only two Phoma species,
P. andigena and P. crystalliniformis, are restricted to South America). Of the 25 soil-borne
species with a worldwide distribution, nine are restricted to solanaceous hosts (Fusarium
coeruleum, Fusarium sambucinum, Phoma foveata, Polyscytalum pustulans, Rhizoctonia
solani anastomosis group-3 (AG-3), Spongospora subterranea and S. endobioticum), and
these species have probably been spread by infested soil or infected seed tubers. No cor-
relation seems to exist between the magnitude of actual damage incited by a pathogen and
its host specificity. So, pathogens that probably have not co-evolved with Solanum spp.
may inflict great damage on potato (e.g. Phytophthora erythroseptica and Verticillium
dahliae) or not (e.g. Helicobasidium brebissonii and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), whereas
other pathogens that are specifically linked to solanaceous hosts may inflict great damage
(e.g. P. infestans) or not (e.g. Passalora concors).

For the correct names of pathogens, I mainly followed the publications of Boerema
et al. (1993; published in different issues in Netherlands Journal of Plant Pathology as

indicated in the text and collected in one monograph). Under the heading ‘synonyms’,
those names are mentioned that may still be found in present-day literature, irrespective
of whether they are used as real synonyms or whether their status is taxonomically
illegitimate.

In the overview given below, references to taxonomic literature are made. Frequently

used literature is listed in Table 29.1.

Several pathogens that are able to infect nearly any weakened tissue, for example due
to extraordinary weather circumstances, severe nutrient deficiencies or other diseases,
are excluded. These include Alternaria alternata (Fr. : Fr.) Keissl. (infecting shoots and
tubers; distribution worldwide), Botrytis cinerea Pers. : Fr. [Teleomorph Botryotinia fuck-
eliana (de Bary) Whetzel] (grey mould; infecting all tissues; distribution worldwide),
Choanephora cucurbitarum (Berk. and Rav.) Thaxter (shoot rot; distribution worldwide),
Phoma huancayensis Turkenst. (probably a saprophyte on potato leaves; South Amer-
ica and New Zealand; Boerema et al., 2004: 88), Phoma subherbarum Gruyter et al.
(probably a saprophyte occurring on potato leaves and other plant species; North and
South America; Boerema et al., 2004: 113), Pleospora herbarum (Fr. : Fr.) Rabenh.
(anam. Stemphylium herbarum E.G. Simmons) (leaf lesions; distribution worldwide),
Rhizopus stolonifer (Fr.) Lind (soft rot of potato tubers; distribution worldwide) and
Ulocladium atrum Preuss [≡ Stemphylium atrum (Preuss) Sacc.] (leaf lesions; South
America). Also excluded are some anomalous diseases, occurring only under extraordi-
nary circumstances and even then inciting only limited damage, such as Armillaria spp.
The species dealt with in this chapter are listed in Table 29.2 and described below in
alphabetical order.

taxonomic position not clear); forms aecia containing aeciospores. For distinguishing
from the only other rust species occurring on potatoes, see Puccinia pittieriana. Major
literature: Comp. APS: 21. Selected illustrations: Comp. APS: pl. 28.

Hosts and distribution. Potatoes, although research may reveal other solanaceous hosts.
Host specialization unknown. Reported only from Peru and more recently from northern
Argentina at high altitudes (2300–3200 m).

Epidemiology. Established in areas where potatoes are grown the year round. It is
unknown to what extent the fungus can persist in the absence of a host.

Management. Unknown.

2 Alternaria solani Sorauer (Common disease name: Early blight)

Original description in Z. PflKrankh. 6 (1896): 6. Synonyms [Boerema and Ver-
hoeven in Neth. J. Plant Pathol. 82 (1976): 197]: A. solani Sorauer, Macrosporium

solani Ellis & G. Martin, Alternaria porri (Ell.) Cif. f. sp. solani (Ellis & G. Martin)
Neergaard 1945. For a discussion on the correct citation, see Simmons (2000: 48). Clas-
siﬁcation: Anamorphic Lewia, Pleosporaceae, Pleosporales, Ascomycota, Fungi. Sexual
stage unknown; forms hyphae and conidia. Major literature: CMI Descr. 475 (1975),
Comp. APS: 22, EHPD: 368, M&T: 19, Chelkowski and Visconti (1992), Rotem (1994;
monograph on Alternaria), Simmons (2000: 36). Selected illustrations: Agrios: 454,
Comp. APS: pl. 31–34, M&T 19, 20.

Hosts and distribution. Solanaceous hosts; other hosts such as Brassica may become
infected but are probably of limited importance. No host specialization. Considerable
variation in genetic composition and virulence exists but could not be related to geographic
origin of isolates (van der Waals et al., 2004). Distribution worldwide but important
mainly in warm and dry regions.

Epidemiology. Surviving in infected plant material as mycelium and conidia (infected
seed, crop residues left on the field or solanaceous weeds) and in soil for approximately
1 year as chlamydospores (Basu, 1971). Dispersal mainly by wind or rain splash. Tuber
infections occur post-harvest.

Management. Use of tolerant cultivars; avoid tuber wounding; application of fungicides.

3 Colletotrichum coccodes (Wallr.) S. Hughes (Common disease name:
Black dot)

Original description in Fl. Crypt. Germ. 2 (1833): 265 as Chaetomium coccodes by
Wallroth. Synonyms [Boerema and Verhoeven in Neth. J. Plant Pathol. 82 (1976): 75]:
Colletotrichum atramentarium (Berk. & Broome) Taubenh. 1916, Vermicularia atra-
mentaria Berk. & Broome 1850. Classiﬁcation: Anamorphic fungi, anamorphs of
Glomerella, Ascomycota, Fungi. Forms hyphae, sclerotia and conidia in acervuli. Major
literature: CMI Descr. 131 (1967), Comp. APS: 16, Bailey and Jeger (1992), EHPD:
330, Jeger et al. (1996; review). Selected illustrations: Comp. APS: pl. 24, M&T 13.
Hosts and distribution. Mainly on Solanaceae, Cucurbitaceae and Leguminosae. Dis-
tribution worldwide. Large variation in pathogenicity between isolates, but no ‘formal’
infraspecific classification has been proposed.

Epidemiology. The pathogen is an opportunist that incites problems only under subopti-
mal growing conditions or in the presence of other pathogens. The sclerotia can survive
for a few years in soil. Potato seed can be infected.

Management. The pathogen can be avoided by creating optimal growing conditions and
using disease-free planting material.

4 Erysiphe cichoracearum DC. (Common disease name: Powdery mildew)

Original description in Fl. fr., 3rd ed., 2 (1805): 274 as Erysiphe cichoracearum by
de Candolle. Synonyms: see Braun (1995: 130). Classiﬁcation: Erysiphaceae,

648

Termorshuizen

Erysiphales, Ascomycota, Fungi; forms hyphae, conidia and rarely ascomata. Major lit-
erature: Comp. APS: 34, EHPD: 256, Braun (1995: 130). Selected illustrations:
Comp. APS: 35, pl. 57, 58.

Hosts and distribution. Wide host range (approximately 230 hosts in nine families).
Some host specialization occurs: for example strains from Compositae do not infect other
hosts, but those on cucurbits do not specialize. Strains of potato tend to specialize as well
(Hopkins, 1956).

Epidemiology. The disease develops strongly under dry conditions, at moderate to high
temperatures and high levels of available nitrogen. If ascomata are formed, the fungus
may survive a limited period of time in soil.

Management. The disease of minor importance only. Application of fungicides.

5 Fusarium coeruleum Lib. ex Sacc. (Common disease name: Fusarium dry rot)

Original description in Syll. Fung. 4 (1886): 705 (short description). Synonyms:
Fusarium caeruleum (Lib.) ex Sacc., F. coeruleum (Lib.) ex Sacc., Fusarium solani
(Mart.) Sacc. var. coeruleum (Lib. ex Sacc) C. Booth. Classiﬁcation: Anamorphic Nec-
triaceae, Hypocreales, Ascomycota, Fungi; forms chlamydospores. Major literature:
Comp. APS: 23, Comp. Soil Fungi: 499, EHPD: 282. Selected illustrations: Comp.
APS: 24 and pl. 35, Gerlach and Nirenberg (1982: 371; also monograph).

Hosts and distribution. Reported to occur specifically on potato in central and northern
Europe and North America.

Epidemiology. Dry rot is often followed by infection by secondary pathogens such
as Erwinia spp., but F. coeruleum can also invade lesions caused by other pathogens.
Mechanical damage at harvesting increases damage. Most proliferous development at
15–20

C and high humidity.

(cid:3)

Management. Harvest tubers from dead stolons, optimize storage conditions, reduce
mechanical damage in combination with usage of cultivars that are tolerant to mechanical
damage, reduce tuber handling at low temperatures. Application of fungicides.

Note: Fusarium solani is an aggregate of very similar but genetically and pathologically
distinct species. Fusarium coeruleum is often confused with purple colonies of Fusarium
oxysporum.

mainly post-harvest. The pathogen spreads especially fast during warm (cid:2)15–20
C(cid:3) and
humid storage.

(cid:3)

Management. Use of clean seed tubers. Slightly infected seed tubers usually result
in relatively heavy infections, as these nearly healthy seed tubers can produce much
inoculum. Cool and dry storage of tubers.

olina (Tassi) van der Aa 1981. Classiﬁcation: Anamorphic Ascomycetes, Ascomycota,
Fungi; sexual stage unknown; forms dark brown, one-celled conidia in pycnidia and
microsclerotia. Major literature: CMI Descr. 275 (1970), Comp. APS: 19, EHPD 404,
M&T: 36, Dhingra and Sinclair 1978. Selected illustrations: M&T: 36.

Hosts and distribution. Extremely wide host range. Limited to countries with a hot
climate, mainly tropical countries. Infraspecific groups not known.

Epidemiology. Microsclerotia infect the plant roots under the influence of root exudates,
from where it spreads up into the shoot, where it forms numerous new microsclerotia in
decaying tissue. The pathogen is strongly favoured by predisposing factors such as a hot,
dry periods after periods of good growing conditions. Microsclerotia survive in soil for
several years.

Management. Elimination of predisposing factors, especially maintenance of irrigation
during periods of hot weather may be an effective management option. Rotation with
unsusceptible crops. N-rich soil amendments may suppress the pathogen. Use of disease-
free planting material.

Hosts and distribution. Reported from the northern hemisphere from potatoes, in notably
Europe and Russia, as well as some parts of India and Africa.

Epidemiology. Prefers cool and humid climate.

Management. Fungicide application; it is likely that cultivars differ in tolerance.

Note: A leaf spot pathogen with lesions constricted by the veins and forming conidia and
mycelium underneath the leaves. Of minor importance only but becoming more prevalent
according to Mulder and Turkensteen (2005).

14 Phoma andigena Turkensteen (Common disease names: Potato black blight
and Leaf spot; Phoma leaf spot)

Original description in Fitopatología 13 (1978): 67 as Phoma andina. This name was
an illegitimate homonym because this binomial had already been introduced in 1904 by
Saccardo and Sydow in Ann. Mycol. 2: 170 for another fungus (Boerema et al., 2004).
Classiﬁcation: Anamorphic Pleosporaceae, Pleosporales, Ascomycota, Fungi; sexual
stage unknown; forms pycnidia containing unicellular conidia of two different sizes and
chlamydospores. Major literature: Comp. APS: 32, Boerema et al. (2004): 130, EPPO

Hosts and distribution. Restricted to wild and cultivated Solanum spp. in Bolivia and
Peru (EPPO, 2005a) at altitudes more than 2000 m. It is unclear whether tomato is a host.
Considered an A1 quarantine organism by EPPO (2004).

Fungal and fungus-like pathogens

653

Epidemiology. Survival in the form of pycnidia on infected plant debris, but persis-
tence time unknown. The importance of chlamydospores is unknown. Infection takes
place under moist conditions below 15
C. Only the larger conidia have been shown
to be infective. The fungus is splash-dispersed over short distances. Tubers are not
infected.

(cid:3)

Management. Not well investigated. The application of fungicides and the use of resistant
cultivars are recommended (Comp. APS: 47).

15 Phoma crystalliniformis (Loer. et al.) Noordel. & Gruyter (Common disease
name: Potato and tomato black blight and leaf spot)

Original description in Fitopatología 21 (1986): 100 as P. andina var. crystallini-
formis by Loerakker, Navarro, Lobo and Turkensteen. Classiﬁcation: Anamorphic
Pleosporaceae, Pleosporales, Ascomycota, Fungi; sexual stage unknown; forms pycnidia
containing unicellular conidia of two different sizes. Formally described as a variety of
P. andigena but differing in host range (primarily occurring on tomato), morphology (the
large-type conidia are larger) and culture characteristics (growing faster) (Boerema et al.,
2004). Major literature: Boerema et al. (2004: 136).

Hosts and distribution. Reported from tomato and Solanum tuberosum ssp. andigenum
in Colombia and Venezuela at altitudes more than 1500 m.

Epidemiology. No details known.

Management. No details known.

16 Phoma eupyrena Sacc. (Common disease names: Dry rot; Damping-off)

Original description in Michelia 1 (1879): 525 by Saccardo. Classiﬁcation: Anamor-
phic Pleosporaceae, Pleosporales, Ascomycota, Fungi; sexual stage unknown; forms pyc-
nidia containing unicellular conidia and chlamydospores. Major literature: Comp.
Soil Fungi: 632, M&T: 37 (as Phoma eupyrina), Boerema et al. (2004: 75). Selected
illustrations: Comp. Soil Fungi: 633, M&T: 37, Boerema et al. (2004: 66).

Hosts and distribution. Wide-spread (probably cosmopolitan) soil-borne fungus. For-
merly considered to be restricted to potato, but currently at least 30 hosts are known
(including various monocotyledonous hosts).

Epidemiology. The disease is favoured under wet conditions. The fungus colonizes
quickly disinfested soils.

Management. Usually not needed, but the fungus is sensitive to fungicides.

17 Phoma exigua Desm. var. exigua (Common disease name: Thumbmark rot)

Note 1: For P. exigua var. foveata, see P. foveata.
Note 2: The common disease name ‘gangrene’ is reserved for the symptoms inflicted by
P. foveata.
Original description in Ann. Sci. Nat. (Bot.) Sér. III 11 (1849): 282–283 as P. exigua
Desm. The first notion of a strain of P. exigua pathogenic on potato was made by Prillieux
& Delacroix in Bull. Soc. Mycol. Fr. 6 (1890): 179 (as Phoma solanicola). Synonyms:
The synonymy of this species is very complicated and extensive (>300 synonyms), see
Boerema et al. (2004: 240). Classiﬁcation: Anamorphic Pleosporaceae, Pleosporales,
Ascomycota, Fungi; forms hyphae, pycnidia and unicellular and 1–2-septate conidia.
Major literature: Comp. APS: 25, Comp. Soil Fungi: 634, EHPD: 399, M&T: 23,
Boerema et al. (2004: 240). Selected illustrations: M&T: 24.
Hosts and distribution. Cosmopolitan, opportunistic plant pathogen isolated from more
than 200 different host genera.

Epidemiology. The disease is promoted under wet and cool conditions but may occur
especially when wounding occurs during or after harvesting.
Management. Promote wound healing by maintaining the tubers after harvest for 1 week
at elevated temperature (cid:2)∼15–18
C(cid:3). Avoid tuber wounding. This pathogen is much less
important than P. foveata.

ter) Malc. 1958. Classiﬁcation: Anamorphic Pleosporaceae, Pleosporales, Ascomy-
cota, Fungi; sexual stage unknown; forming hyphae, pycnidia, uni-, sometimes bicellular
conidia. Formation of chlamydospores and pseudosclerotia is induced by the bacterium
Serratia plymuthica (Camyon and Gerhardson, 1997). Major literature: Comp. APS:
57, EHPD: 399, M&T: 23, Boerema et al. (2004: 266). Selected illustrations:
M&T: 24.

Hosts and distribution. Occurs wherever potatoes are grown, mostly in areas with a
cool and wet climate. Originates from South America, where it causes brown stalk rot of
Chenopodium quinoa.

Epidemiology. Stems, leaves and tubers may become infected. Harvested tubers have
latent infections. Gangrene of tubers develops during tuber storage and is promoted when
C(cid:3). Generally persists in soil no longer
tubers are wounded and at low temperatures (cid:2)<4

Pethybridge. Classiﬁcation: Pythiaceae, Pythiales, Oomycetes, Oomycota, Chromista;
forms hyphae (without septa), oospores and zoospores in sporangia. Major literature:
CMI Descr. 593 (1978), Comp. APS: 33, EHPD: 204, M&T: 39, Erwin and Ribeiro
(1996; monograph on Phytophthora). Selected illustrations: Comp. APS: pl. 55,
M&T: 39, 40.

Hosts and distribution. Various hosts including non-solanaceous plants but economically
significant only on potatoes. Distribution worldwide.

Epidemiology. May survive several years in the form of oospores. Can be transmitted in
apparently healthy planting material. Disease progress is favoured by circumstances that
promote soil wetness.

Management. Cultivars vary in tolerance (Peters et al., 2004) but no complete resistance.
Improve soil drainage and avoid potato growing on infested soils.

Note: Also other soil-borne Phytophthora spp. are able to cause similar disease symp-
toms (Phytophthora cryptogea) Pethybr. and Laff. (very wide host range; distribution
worldwide; of minor importance for potatoes), Phytophthora drechsleri Tucker (like
P. cryptogea but preferring higher temperatures), Phytophthora megasperma Drechsler
(very wide host range; limited to warm countries) and Phytophthora nicotianae Breda de
Haan (= Phytophthora parasitica Dastur) (very wide host range, limited to areas with a
hot climate; of minor importance for potatoes).

tions: Comp. APS: 28, 29, pl. 43–47, M&T: 28, 29.
Hosts and distribution. Various members of the Solanaceae, most notably potato and
tomato. Heterothallic; the A1 mating type has a wide distribution since the 1840s. The
A2 mating type has become common in many areas since the 1980s (Hohl and Iselin,
1984). Since then, the sexual spores (oospores) are found, and as a result, the diversity
of genotypes has drastically increased and epidemics have become more severe (Smart
and Fry, 2001). Distribution worldwide.

656

Termorshuizen

Epidemiology. Onset of an epidemic is by spread of sporangia from infected volunteers
or uncovered potato heaps. Infection may also occur from soil-borne oospores, but its
importance for the onset of disease is unknown. Sporangia may germinate either directly
C(cid:3). In either case, free water is necessary for
(cid:2)18–24
infection. Appearance of new sporangiophores halts under dry weather conditions. Under
optimal weather conditions, 5 days are needed from infection till sporulation.

C(cid:3) or first form zoospores (cid:2)<18

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

Management. Partial resistance can reduce disease spread. Early planting and cropping
of early cultivars may limit disease. Conventional growers apply metalaxyl and dithio-
carbamates on the basis of disease forecasting systems. Before harvest, an infected potato
crop can be burned to prevent Phytophthora infection of tubers.

21 Polyscytalum pustulans (Owen & Wakef.) M.B. Ellis (Common disease
names: Tuber skin spot; Skin spot)

Original description in Kew Bull. (1919): 297 as Oospora pustulans by Owen
and Wakefield. Classiﬁcation: Anamorphic Ascomycetes, Ascomycota, Fungi; forms
septate hyphae, mainly unseptate conidia and microsclerotia. Major literature:
Comp. APS: 41, EHPD: 408, M&T: 7. Selected illustrations: Comp. APS: 41,
M&T: 57.

Hosts and distribution. Only of importance on potato, but infecting other solanaceous
hosts, including tomato, as well. Distribution worldwide but important mainly in Europe
and Russia. Limited to areas with a cool temperate climate.

Epidemiology. The disease is tuber-borne, but microsclerotia, formed on decaying plant
material, may survive in soil up to 7 years.

Management. Use of disease-free planting material; fungicide treatment of planting
material; avoidance of humid conditions during tuber storage.

22 Puccinia pittieriana Hennings (Common disease name: Common potato rust)

Original description in Hedwigia 43 (1904): 147 by Hennings. Classiﬁcation: Puc-
ciniaceae, Uredinales, Urediniomycetes, Basidiomycota, Fungi; forms teliospores and
basidiospores. Major literature: CMI Descr. 286 (1971), Comp. APS: 20, EHPD: 497,
Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 11 (Thurston, 1973): 40, EPPO (2005c). Selected illustra-
tions: Comp. APS: pl. 29, M&T: 69.
Hosts and distribution. Solanaceae, including potato. Also reported from tomato but
without heavy damage. Reported only from South America (EPPO, 2005c) at high ele-
vations (2700–4300 m). Considered an A1 quarantine organism by EPPO (2004).

Epidemiology. Teliospores are formed in infected leaf tissue. They germinate at tem-
C, which
peratures below 15
become easily air-borne. As basidiospores are generally more sensitive to desiccation than

C to give rise to basidiospores at temperatures below 10

uredospores (the spore type mostly associated with dispersal in the rusts), transcontinental
transport is not expected by this means. The persistence of teliospores is unknown, but
they may very well persist for 1 year or so on infected debris, as many other rust fungi
do. The fungus does not infect belowground tissue.

Management. Application of carbamate fungicides (Diaz and Echeverria, 1963). Destruc-
tion of infected shoot tissue and control of solanaceous weeds.

Note: The only other rust species occurring on potatoes is A. cantense (see entry 1), which
forms aecia (5–10 mm diameter) on the leaves, whereas P. pittieriana forms smaller
(3–4 mm diameter) telia.

23 Pythium spp. (Common disease names: Leak or Watery wound rot)

Various species have been associated with diseased potato tubers, including Pythium
splendens Hans Braun (warm areas) and Pythium ultimum Trow (temperate areas), but
given the complex taxonomy and problems associated with the identification of Pythium
spp., other species may be involved as well. Classiﬁcation: Pythiaceae, Pythiales,
Oomycetes, Oomycota, Chromista. Forms hyphae (without septa), oospores and sporan-
gia. Many, but not all, species form zoospores. Major literature: Comp. APS: 30,
EHPD: 200, M&T: 34, van der Plaats-Niterink (1981; monograph including illustrations).
Selected illustrations: Comp. APS: pl. 48–50, M&T: 34, 35.

Hosts and distribution. Distribution worldwide but mostly a rare disease.

Epidemiology. Opportunistic pathogens, infecting only weakened, usually wounded,
tubers.

Management. Avoid mechanical injury during tuber handling and avoid humid storage
conditions.

658

Termorshuizen

Hosts and distribution. Rhizoctonia solani has an extremely wide host range. Currently
12 AGs are known, each exhibiting its specific ecology including host range. At least
AG-3, -5 and -8 may infect potato, of which AG-3 is the major cause of black scurf and
the only AG inciting stem canker. Contrary to most other AGs, AG-3 is fairly limited
to potatoes. Vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) within AG-3 have been reported
(Jeger et al., 1996). Cosmopolitic.

Epidemiology. Rhizoctonia solani is able to translocate its cytoplasm through its hyphal
system, enabling the fungus to grow very fast even under nutrient-deprived circumstances.
In addition, the fungus may colonize fresh organic matter. The function of basidiospores
that are formed at the stem base is not understood. Arthropods grazing on hyphae of R.
solani are significant antagonists (Lartey et al., 1994).

Management. Use disease-free planting material. Fresh organic matter should not be
applied shortly before planting potato tubers. There exist various selective fungicides
against R. solani including pencycuron. Separation of the haulms from the tubers before
harvesting limits production of sclerotia on the tubers. This method, called ‘Green Crop
Lifting’ (Mulder et al., 1992), may be combined with the application of the hyperpara-
site Verticillium biguttatum, which is effective against R. solani (van den Boogert and
Luttikholt, 2004).

25 Rosellinia necatrix Prill. (Common disease names: Rosellinia wilt; Rosellinia
black rot)

Original description in Bull. Soc. Mycol. Fr. 20 (1904): 34 by Prillieux. Asexual stage:
Dematophora necatrix Hartig. Classiﬁcation: Xylariaceae, Xylariales, Ascomycota,
Fungi; forms hyphae, rhizomorphs and sclerotia; in culture, it also forms conidia on
synnemata and ascospores in perithecia. Major literature: Comp. APS: 37, EHPD:
333, M&T: 52. Selected illustrations: Comp. APS: 38, 39, pl. 68, M&T: 52, 53.
Hosts and distribution. No host specialization. Occurs worldwide but mainly in areas
with higher temperature and humid conditions.

Epidemiology. May occur severely on cleared forest or pasture.

Management. Use of uninfected planting material; proper drainage.

26 Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary (Common disease names: White

Fungal and fungus-like pathogens

659

Hosts and distribution. Very wide host range, limited to dicotyledonous hosts. Special
forms are not known. Infections in potatoes are not common, and the resulting damage
is limited. Distribution worldwide.

Epidemiology. Ecologically obligate, unspecialized and soil-borne pathogen. Survives in
the soil in the form of black sclerotia that germinate and give rise to an aboveground-
formed apothecium. The resulting ascospores become air-borne and may infect host tissue,
notably the stems. The disease progresses most under cool and moist conditions.

Management. Heavy attacks rarely occur in potatoes. Soil inoculum build-up can be
avoided by proper rotations. Certain crops such as lettuce, beans and chicory can contribute
to inoculum build-up significantly. Soil infestations can also be reduced by metam sodium
and biological soil disinfestation (Blok et al., 2000). The hyperparasite Coniothyrium
minitans may provide biological control, and a commercialized product ‘Contans’ is based
on this (de Vrije, 2001).

27. Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. var. rolfsii (Common disease names: Southern blight;
Stem rot)

Original description in Ann. Mycol. 9 (1911): 257 as Sclerotium rolfsii by Saccardo.
Teleomorph: Athelia rolfsii (Curzi) C. Tu & Kimbrough 1978 [originally described as
Corticium rolfsii Curzi in Boll. Staz. Patol. Veg. Roma II 11 (1931): 306]. Classiﬁ-
cation (A. rolfsii): Atheliaceae, Polyporales, Basidiomycota, Fungi; forms hyphae and
brown sclerotia; in culture, rarely in nature, also basidiospores. Major literature: CMI
Descr. 410 (1974) (as C. rolfsii), Comp. APS: 42, EHPD: 509, M&T: 58. Selected
illustrations: Comp. APS: 42, 43, pl. 72, 73, M&T: 58.

Hosts and distribution. Very wide host range. Worldwide occurrence but limited to
areas with a hot climate.

Epidemiology. Ecologically obligate and unspecialized plant pathogen. Sclerotia can
survive many years in soil.

Management. Management of fields infested with S. rolfsii is difficult. Removal of plant
residues and weed control; use of disease-free planting material. Also deep-ploughing
and soil fumigation have been advised.

28 Septoria lycopersici Speg. var. malagutii (Common disease names: Septoria

Original description in An. Soc. Cient. Argent. 12 (1881): 115 by Spegazzini. The
variety malagutii was described in Phytopathologia Mediterranea 17 (1978): 87 by Cic-
carone and Boerema. Classiﬁcation: Anamorphic Mycosphaerella, Mycosphaerellales,
Ascomycota, Fungi; sexual stage unknown; forms pycnidia containing unicellular conidia.

Major literature: CMI Descr. 89 (1966), Comp. APS: 39, EPPO (2005f). Selected
illustrations: Comp. APS: 39, EPPO (2005g).
Hosts and distribution. Occurs on cultivated and wild potatoes. Limited to Central
and South America. The variety malagutii infects mainly, or only, Solanum spp. var.
lycopersici, causes leaf spot on tomato and is more widely spread. Var. malagutii is
considered an A1 quarantine organism by EPPO (2004).

Epidemiology. The pathogen thrives well at cool temperatures and moist conditions.

Management. Use of resistant cultivars and application of fungicides [Carrera and Orel-
lana in Fitopatología 36 (2001): 37].

29 Spongospora subterranea (Wallr.) Lagerh. f. sp. subterranea (Common disease
name: Powdery scab)

Original description in Linnaea, Halle 16 (1842): 332 as Eryisiphe subterranea by
Wallroth (but there erroneously written as Erysibe subterranea). Classiﬁcation: Plas-
modiophoraceae, Plasmodiophorales, Plasmodiophoromycota, Protozoa; forms zoospores,
cystosori (= spore balls) consisting of cysts (= resting spores) and zoosporangia. Major
literature: CMI Descr. 477 (1975), Comp. APS: 35, EHPD: 245, M&T: 42, Harrison
et al. (1997; review), Jeger et al. (1996; review), Karling (1968: 71), Merz et al. (2005;
detection). Selected illustrations: Agrios: 407, Comp. APS: 35, pl. 59–65, Karling
(1968: 73; microscopic drawings).

Hosts and distribution. There are two formae speciales known of S. subterranea: f.
sp. nasturtii specific to watercress and f. sp. subterranea specific to potato. The f.
sp. subterranea infects a wide range of hosts, but resting spores are formed only in
various solanaceous hosts. Economic damage occurs only in potatoes. Probably occurring
wherever potatoes are grown in cool and wet regions.

Epidemiology. Resting spores may survive 6–10 years in the absence of a host. Infection
is favoured strongly by cool temperatures and wet soil conditions. In addition to causing
powdery scab, S. subterranea vectors potato mop top virus.

Management. Avoidance by using uninfected potatoes, no transport of infested soil.
There is variation between cultivars in susceptibility, but new cultivars are not necessarily
tolerant. Complete resistance seems non-existent.

Hosts and distribution. Infects only solanaceous hosts, in particular tuber-forming
species, but also tomato. No host specialization. About 40 pathotypes have been distin-
guished that differentially affect potato cultivars of which pathotypes 1, 2, 6, 8 and 18
are internationally of great significance. Cosmopolitan but significant damage is mainly
limited to regions with moderate temperatures and moderate to high rainfall. Considered
an A1 quarantine organism by EPPO (2004).

Epidemiology. The persistence of the resting spores in the absence of hosts is extremely
long: 10–20 years. In the presence of hosts, zoospores arising from the resting spores
infect the plant and form summer sporangia that subsequently form zoospores. This may
occur repeatedly in one growing season. For their transport, zoospores depend on
free water.

Management. Against pathotype 1, fully resistant cultivars are widely available, and for
all other pathotypes, this is not or hardly the case. For these other pathotypes, refraining
from cropping potato for several years is necessary. In addition, cropping of agricultural
products that bring about transport of soil should also be forbidden.

32 Verticillium alboatrum Reinke & Berth. (Common disease names: Potato
Early Dying; Verticillium wilt)

Note: Verticillium dahliae (entry 33) and V. alboatrum, although genetically distinct
species, have not been differentiated for some time when V. dahliae was designated as
V. alboatrum ‘microsclerotial form’.
Original description in Unters. Bot. Lab. Univ. Göttingen 1 (1879): 75 as V. alboatrum
by Reinke and Berthold. Classiﬁcation: Anamorphic Ascomycetes, Ascomycota, Fungi,
related to Glomerella; sexual stage unknown; forms hyaline hyphae, dark hyphae (in
contrast to V. dahliae), conidia and yeast cells. Major literature: CMI Descr. 255
(1970), Comp. APS: 62, Comp. Soil Fungi: 830; EHPD: 299, Pegg and Brady (2002;
extensive monograph). Selected illustrations: M&T: 62.

Hosts and distribution. Host range not precisely known but much narrower than V.
dahliae, causing damage mainly in lucerne, hop and tomato. Damage in potatoes is
generally less than that caused by V. dahliae. Distribution worldwide in temperate zones.
A strain highly pathogenic to hop has been reported (Sewell and Wilson, 1984).

Epidemiology. Prefers cooler temperatures than V. dahliae. An interaction with root-
infecting nematodes has been reported (see V. dahliae, entry 33). For a discussion on
significance of air-borne inoculum, see Pegg and Brady (2002: 68).

Management. Cultivars of many crops evidently differ in tolerance to the disease but
less so in susceptibility. The black mycelium is able to survive a short host-free period.
A proper rotation with non-hosts adequately controls the pathogen.

33 Verticillium dahliae Kleb. (Common disease names: Potato Early Dying
(PED; see note 2); Verticillium wilt)

Note 1: See also under V. alboatrum (entry 32).
Note 2: The common disease name Potato Early Dying (PED) is often used when both
root infecting nematodes and V. dahliae or V. alboatrum are involved.
Note 3: Verticillium longisporum (Stark) Karapapa et al. (= V. dahliae var. longisporum
Stark) causes wilt exclusively on crucifers and is most likely a hybrid (amphihaploid) of
V. dahliae × V. alboatrum (Barbara and Clewes, 2003; Collins et al., 2003).
Original description in Mycol. Centbl. 3 (1913): 66 as V. dahliae by Klebahn. Syn-
onyms: Verticillium alboatrum Reinke & Berth. 1879 ‘microsclerotial form’. Classiﬁca-
tion: Anamorphic Ascomycetes, Ascomycota, Fungi, related to Glomerella; sexual stage
unknown; forms hyphae, microsclerotia, conidia and yeast cells. Major literature:

Fungal and fungus-like pathogens

Hosts and distribution. Very wide host range but monocotyledonous plants (except
barley) are immune. Limited host specialization. VCGs have been described from many
parts in the world, and there are differences in pathogenicity to potato (Rowe et al.,
1997). Some VCGs do not infect potatoes, but VCGs pathogenic to potato are very
common. In Europe, two VCGs have been recognized, and both are pathogenic to potato
(Hiemstra and Rataj-Guranowska, 2003). Distribution worldwide but absent in regions of
high temperatures, because its development is suppressed at temperatures above 28–30
C.

(cid:3)

Epidemiology. Damage because of Verticillium wilt is strongly increased by nematode
infection (Globodera rostochiensis, Meloidogyne spp. and Pratylenchus spp.). Presence
of nematodes doubles the number of infections and the degree of colonization because of
biochemical rather than mechanical damage (Bowers et al., 1996; and more references in
Pegg and Brady, 2002: 85–86). For a discussion on significance of air-borne inoculum,
see Pegg and Brady (2002: 68).

Management. There are evident differences in tolerance of cultivars of many crops to
the disease but less so in susceptibility. Wide rotation with non-hosts or hosts that do not
build up inoculum, such as sugar beets, is necessary. Soil disinfestation with nematicides
or metam sodium is effective. Irrigation and fertilization affects disease severity.

30.1 INTRODUCTION

Plant biotechnology has, in the last 20 years, made a significant impact on world
agriculture, with over 81 million hectares of genetically modified (GM) crops being
grown worldwide in 2005 (http://www.isaaa.org). The transformed traits of the GM crops
currently cultivated can be generalized as ‘first-generation’ targets, largely based on
single-gene modifications. This is due to the substantial timescale from laboratory to
field-scale commercial cultivation. Recent rapid developments in technology may allow
much more sophisticated and complex transgenic crops to be grown in the future. The
major component of the current total is herbicide-resistant soya; indeed, over 50% of all
soya cultivated is GM. In addition to the commercial applications of GM technology,
which are increasing in both total area and the number of countries growing GM crops,
gene transfer methods can be used for a wide range of fundamental studies, contribut-
ing to a better understanding of the mechanisms of plant : pathogen interactions and
biosynthetic pathways in plants.

Examples of in vitro manipulation technology in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) vary
from the low-input and widely adopted (and non-GM) technology of micropropagation to
the complex manipulation of multi-gene biosynthetic pathways through transgenic inter-
vention. Potato is considered, due to its high in vitro regeneration capacity, a model species
for methods such as somatic hybridization and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In
addition, the related technology of micropropagation is an important component of many
breeding schemes, and anther culture methodology has been adapted recently to enable
the production of dihaploid lines from an increasing number of lines (Millam et al., 2005).
Furthermore, recent advances in somatic embryogenesis in this species have increased
the scope for the rapid propagation of novel material (Sharma and Millam, 2004).

Clearly, the lengthy breeding programmes and the problems of tetrasomic inheritance
involved in the creation of potato lines with improved characters establish potato as a
leading target for enhancement through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Indeed,
historically, potato was one of the first crop plants to be successfully transformed (Ooms
et al., 1986). Considerable scientific and commercial progress has been made since these
early reports, and a large number of single-gene and multiple-gene traits have been

engineered into a wide range of potato and related germplasm (Millam, 2005). The
development and large-scale adoption of GM technology has not, however, been trouble-
free due to both scientific and ethical issues. Problems in scientific areas include alleged
problems with gene flow (Snow, 2002) and the toxicity of introduced traits (Malarkey,
2003). There has also been considerable public concern over GM technology in general,
and to allay many of the perceived problems, substantial scientific advances have been
made in such areas as developing ‘clean-gene’ technology (see section 30.3.3.2), studies
on resistance breakdown (Bates et al., 2005), large-scale studies of gene flow in the
environment (Conner et al., 2003) and the actual composition and safety of introduced
traits (Rischer and Oksman-Caldentey, 2006).

The changing emphasis in target traits has been a key feature in the development of
transgenic technology in potato, which has been at the forefront of progress in crop plants
due to the relative ease of transformation of this species. Early targets were mainly input
traits, e.g. herbicide resistance (Eberlein et al., 1988), pest resistance (Cheng et al., 1992)
and virus resistance (Kawchuk et al., 1991). Fungus/bacteria resistance was introduced
at a later stage (Lyapkova et al., 2001), largely due to the complexities of developing
durable systems for such traits. The trend today is towards the generation of crops with
output traits, e.g. modified starch (Vardy et al., 2002), carotenoids (Ducreux et al., 2005a)
and the production of pharmaceuticals in tubers (Park and Cheong, 2002). These more
complex traits have been facilitated by the development of increasingly efficient and
sophisticated approaches (Section 30.3.2), including the vastly increased knowledge of
genomes and gene function. Furthermore, such output traits are considered to be more
acceptable to consumers and have thus been the focus of commercially funded as well as
academic projects.

30.2 GENETIC TRANSFORMATION OF POTATO

Since the development of the first transgenic plant (tobacco) reported in 1983, by four
groups simultaneously (although historically the actual first publication was in May of
that year by Herrera-Estrella et al., 1983), over 120 plant species have been successfully
transformed with a wide and increasingly sophisticated range of traits. The historical
development of transgenic technology in potato follows a familiar route for most of the
first plant species investigated (Table 30.1).

One of the key requirements for an efficient transformation system is the ability to
rapidly regenerate plants from an isolated explant, and in potato, a number of strategies
have been successfully employed for a wide range of germplasm (Wheeler et al., 1985).
Early work on potato transformation focused on infection of potato tissue by strains of
Agrobacterium rhizogenes, and the first direct evidence of the uptake of foreign DNA by
transformation was obtained by Ooms et al. (1986), where clones of the potato cultivar
Desirée were regenerated from A. rhizogenes-infected tissue. This work was extended
to include several other cultivars by Ooms et al. (1987) and further to monohaploids
and diploids of S. tuberosum (Devries and Gilissen, 1987). The use of A. rhizogenes
has a number of technical drawbacks, however, not least the requirement to be able to
regenerate intact plants from isolated root tissues. Thus, the use of Agrobacterium tumefa-
ciens became more widespread in the mid-1980s, as this approach facilitates regeneration
from more amenable explants such as leaf, tuber and stem. Cultivars Desiree and Bintje
were transformed using A. tumefaciens by Stiekema et al. (1988) (interestingly, these
remain the ‘model’ cultivars for potato transformation), and DeBlock (1988) reported a
largely genotype-independent method for transformation, using leaf discs as the target
tissue. This work was extended by Visser et al. (1989) who published a two-stage regen-
eration/transformation method using stem and leaf explants and binary A. tumefaciens
vectors, which is the basis for many protocols in use today.

These early reports were devoted to the establishment and development of protocols,
but as technology became established more widely, reports appeared describing signifi-
cant scientific and commercial applications of transformation technology in potato, e.g.
resistance to potato leafroll virus (PLRV) in the major variety Russet Burbank (Kawchuk
et al., 1991). The ultimate objective of a transformation project would be to transfer the
transgene into an existing cultivar in order to produce an enhanced version. However,
the directed integration of an introduced gene into a unique and characterized position on
the genome, despite many advances (section 30.3.2), has proved to be virtually impos-
sible. Thus, many transformation projects have created large populations of independent
transformants which have been screened (a time-consuming and expensive process) for
the lines of interest. The first stage of screening would be the use of a selectable marker
during the regeneration process. Following this, the resultant population of independent
lines could be grown on and analysed further for the gene/phenotype of interest.

Historically, a survey of the literature reveals rapid application of the novel transforma-
tion technologies of the time, e.g. the use of antisense approaches (Kawchuk et al., 1991).
In reports of that time, antisense could be defined as the insertion, by genetic engineering,
of a gene in a reverse or backwards orientation. The antisense gene interferes with the
operation of the same gene naturally found in the organism. This approach was used to
switch off, delay or slow down the operation of a natural process such as softening in
tomatoes and other fruits (Smith et al., 2002). In terms of tuber characters, Visser et al.
(1991) reported inhibition of expression of the gene for granule-bound starch synthase
(GBSS) in potato by antisense constructs, with implications for the starch : sugar balance
in the tuber of transgenic lines and the production of amylose-free starch similar to that
found in waxy mutants. For another key target, that of virus resistance, Mackenzie et al.
(1991) reported genetically engineered resistance to potato virus-S in the US processing
cultivar Russet Burbank. Virus resistance was among the first traits investigated for the

672

Millam

genetic enhancement of potato, and the first report of antisense RNA-mediated resistance
(to PLRV) was made by Kawchuk et al. (1991) again using the variety Russet Burbank.
It became apparent, however, that Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was not a
simple ‘one plus one’ approach, and one of the first reports of the effect of transgene
insertion was made by Brown et al. (1991), citing findings on insert copy number where
it was shown that the range of T-DNA insert number could be from one to seven among
a small population of transgenics. The same authors also showed that around one-third
of the diploid regenerants had doubled their chromosome number (see also Ducreux
et al., 2005b). Pollen stainability revealed that the tetraploid regenerants were male-sterile,
thus affecting the crossability of the Agrobacterium-transformed diploid potato. This was
important information, and because of the random nature of insertion, many projects aim
to produce large numbers of independent transformants, undertake preliminary screenings
and select a small subset of the desired lines for further analysis. The downside to this
strategy is that many of the large number of transgenic lines created are discarded, some of
which may be of great biological interest. Further refinements in improving the efficiency
and applicability of potato transformation methodology, mainly by adjustments to in
vitro conditions and modifications to the plant tissue culture media formulations, were
made by Hulme et al. (1992) who reported an efficient genotype-independent method for
the regeneration and transformation of potato plants from leaf tissue explants. This was
extended to the report of a total of over 35 potato varieties that were assessed for their
morphogenic and transformation efficiency in a review by Dale and Hampson (1995).
A range of tissue explants have been successfully used for regeneration and transformation
in potato. These include leaf discs (DeBlock, 1988), the advantages of which are the
ease and rapidity of production and reproducibility and the disadvantage being the high
incidence of damage during handling, internodal stem sections (Visser et al., 1989) that
are also easy to produce and more robust than leaf sections for handling purposes and
microtubers (Snyder and Belknap, 1993) that are technically more complicated and time-
consuming to produce. The target of much of this work was to increase the efficiency of
transformation across a wide range of cultivars. A widely applicable method has recently
been published (Millam, 2005) based on the use of internodal sections as an explant source
and successfully demonstrated for model cultivars such as Desiree, more recalcitrant
cultivars such as Saturna and Stirling, breeding lines and diploid material. With regard
to the plant tissue culture media formulations, nearly all methods utilize the widely
used Murashige and Skoog (1962) plant tissue culture medium or minor modifications.
There has been a range of growth regulator components commonly used in regeneration
and transformation systems, but most protocols utilize a two-stage regeneration system.
The first stage (approximately 10–14 days duration) stimulates callus formation, and the
second stage is designed to induce de novo shoot outgrowth. In the first media, cytokinin
(often in the form of zeatin riboside or less commonly benzylaminopurine) ratio to auxin
(often naphthalene acetic acid) is between 20 and 200:1. In many protocols, gibberellic
acid is used in the second media to enhance shoot outgrowth. Many variations exist in
precise media formulations, and if introducing novel germplasm into a transformation
system, some degree of optimization may be required.

Variation in transgene expression among the progeny is a commonly reported problem
in potato transformation and has been attributed to the random integration of the transgene

Developments in transgenic biology

into different sites of the plant genome. A detailed analysis of significant populations of
transgenic lines of potato has additionally revealed a number of phenotypic changes and
substantially reduced tuber yields in field trials. Such alterations have been attributed to
epigenetic and genetic events occurring during the regeneration phase of transformation.
Depending on the potato cultivar, the frequency of these off-types has been recorded as
15–80%, and these often do not become apparent until plants are field grown (Kuipers
et al., 1991; Jongedijk et al., 1992). It is apparent that data derived from glasshouse trials
or first-generation tubers derived from microplants need to be treated with caution.

Thus, for the unequivocal analysis of introduced traits, it is important to generate
sufficient experimental material and trial it under field conditions. The first report of
a field evaluation of transformed potato was by Kuipers et al. (1991), who described
an evaluation of the antisense RNA-mediated inhibition of GBSS gene expression in
potato. Conner et al. (1994) reported findings from a field trial of transgenic potatoes
undertaken in New Zealand. On a commercial basis, Monsanto’s ‘New Leaf’ potato,
which was initially the variety Russet Burbank (but later included the varieties Atlantic
and Superior), was transformed to contain a Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) CryIIIA gene
(Perlak et al., 1993) conferring resistance to the Colorado potato beetle (CPB) and was
first approved by US regulatory agencies in early 1995. This first line was followed,
in late 1998, by a second type of transgenic potato, a Russet Burbank marketed as
‘New Leaf Plus’, which combined the Bt resistance trait with resistance to the PLRV
(Thomas et al., 1997), and a third version, ‘New Leaf Y’, combining Bt with resistance
to the potato virus Y (PVY). Despite being grown commercially between 1995 and 2001,
plantings of these lines never amounted to more than 2–3% of the total US potato market
and were discontinued, one reason cited being the premium price of the seed tubers
(http://www.geo-pie.cornell.edu/crops/potato.html). In our own work, we successfully
field-trialled over 10 000 transgenic potato plants of the model cultivar Desiree as well
as the commercial crisping cultivar Saturna on two sites in Scotland between 1996
and 1998 (http://www.biomatnet.org/secure/Fair/S1140.htm). This study also included
‘double-transformants’ where selected lines transformed for one gene were re-transformed
with another (using a second selectable marker), and populations comprising a range of
promoters, sense and antisense constructs and substantial somaclonal controls were grown
in replicated field plots. Material was assessed in the field for phenotypic differences,
and in one line, it was found that the tetraploid had doubled to octoploid, which is in line
with previous findings (Brown et al., 1991). Generally, the vast majority of the transgenic
material was phenotypically indistinguishable from the control plants and was stable
over the several tuber generations tested. Although the outcome of the work was the
generation of a number of improved crisping quality lines, due to patent and ownership
issues and a reluctance of the industry to commit to the use of GM potatoes, this work
was discontinued.

The first report of transgenic potato was in 1986, and by 1995, extensive field trials
in several countries and commercialization of GM potato crops had occurred. This rapid
development was largely attributable to the amenability of potato to first-generation
transformation methodology. Some of the important traits that have been engineered
will be discussed in Section 30.5. However, there have been a number of advances (see
Sections 30.3.2.2 and 30.3.2.3) and breakthroughs in gene transfer technology, many

674

Millam

of which have been applied to potato. Additionally, the extensive information that has
become available from genomics has enabled more precise and advanced transformation
targets to be addressed. These will be discussed in the rest of this chapter.

30.3 DEVELOPMENTS IN TRANSGENIC BIOLOGY

Many transformation protocols, in a number of species including potato, are still largely
based on the methods detailed in the original papers (DeBlock, 1988; Visser et al., 1989).
There have been some developments to enable a wider range of related germplasm to
be transformed, for example to the cultivated diploid species Solanum phureja (Ducreux
et al., 2005b), and to increase overall transformation efficiencies. These improvements
have been principally based on protocol refinements (Section 30.3.1). Gene transfer
strategies have widened since the early work on Agrobacterium, and alternative systems
have been developed for introducing novel genetic material into plants and for the transfer
of multi-gene traits (Section 30.3.2).

30.3.1 Protocol refinements

30.3.1.1 Improved vectors

Early vectors used for transformation were closely based on wild-type strains of Agrobac-
terium and were deletion derivatives of Ti plasmids (co-integrative vectors tended to be
large and were problematic in enabling efficient plant regeneration and for assembling
the transgene constructs). It was found that the only features of the Ti plasmid actually
necessary for integration into the host genome were the short border sequences and also
that the removal of the natural oncogenic features enabled plants to be more easily regen-
erated using plant growth regulators. Several key features are necessary for the efficient
design of a vector. The plasmid needs to be able to replicate in Escherichia coli (thus
enabling easy DNA ‘cut and paste’ manipulations), additional selectable markers need
to be incorporated for plant selection, border sequences need to be incorporated into the
design of plasmid vectors to ensure efficient integration into the plant’s genome and the
‘foreign’ genes (even though they may be from potato itself) need to have appropriate
terminators and promoters to ensure correct expression. The development of binary vec-
tors (Bevan, 1984) enabled the transfer system and the T-DNA to be located on separate
plasmids. This enabled the vectors to become much smaller and easier to manipulate.
A wide range of Agrobacterium vectors has been used for transformation of potato (for
an extensive guide to currently available Agrobacterium vectors, see Hellens et al., 2000).
There have been very recent reports that bacteria other than Agrobacterium may be used
as vectors for gene transfer (Broothaerts et al., 2005), although this has not, at the time
of writing, been applied to potato yet.

30.3.1.2 In vitro conditions

This is an aspect that has been strangely neglected over the years. Most protocols utilize
plant tissue culture media formulations developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and there have

Developments in transgenic biology

675

been no apparent technical advances on these. The development of new growth regulators
has also been slow. Possibly, the only developments in this section are the use of refined or
alternative gelling agents such as Phytagel™ (Sigma Aldrich) in place of agar and in using
vented culture vessels such as Magenta® (Sigma Aldrich) containers. This is an area where
it is quite conceivable that improvements to conditions, e.g. light spectra and modified
day–night conditions, could make a significant impact on the efficiency of transformation.

30.3.1.3 Improvements in selection

The first-generation transformation vectors utilized a number of antibiotic resistance
genes for selection, and such methods have a number of advantages and disadvantages. In
the majority of transgenic potato plants developed to date, kanamycin resistance, which
is cheap to use and, in potato, proves to be highly discriminatory (Millam, 2005), has
been used for selection. Other selectable markers that have been successfully used for
potato transformation include methotrexate resistance, hygromycin resistance and, inter-
estingly, ‘benign’ markers such as galactose mediated by xylose isomerase (Haldrup et al.,
2001) or a UDP-glucose: galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase gene (Joersbo et al.,
2003). Herbicide-resistant genes have been used but have been found to be less effective
(DeBlock, 1988). However, owing to public opinion, the use of antibiotic-resistant genes
is being phased out (Section 30.3.2.2). Practically, after the initial transformation and
regeneration, selectable markers are no longer required for transgene expression.

30.3.2 Enhanced or alternative transformation strategies

30.3.2.1 Strategies for transgene pyramiding

Although single-gene traits have been successfully introduced into potato by transfor-
mation, the range of characters (e.g. quality, yield and drought resistance) and their
consequent uptake would be significantly enhanced if multiple genes could be expressed
or manipulated. Considerable progress has been made in recent years in elucidating
biosynthetic pathways in plants by the modern tools of metabolomics and gene sequenc-
ing. Thus, this information could be used in transformation programmes if methodologies
were available for the stable transfer of multiple-gene traits into plants. The simplest
strategy for combining two or more transgenes would be crossing one transgenic with
another, but this would be a time-consuming approach in potato. Another strategy could
be re-transformation of an existing transgenic with another gene construct. This is again
a time-consuming approach and necessitates the use of two different selectable markers.
Such an approach has other limitations, in terms of potential co-suppression of transgenes,
but has been used successfully in a number of commercial potato projects (http://www.nf-
2000.org/secure/Fair/S1140.htm). Many methods for combining transgenes have disad-
vantages. One of the main problems is that transgenes introduced by the above methods
will not be linked and will be sited at different loci in the plant’s genome. In a commercial
crop-breeding programme, each unlinked transgenic locus to be introduced would double
the size of the breeding population needed, and the introduction of a third gene would
potentially require eight times the population (Hitz, 1999). The second key constraint
would be the need to use a number of selectable markers. Although methods exist for their

676

Millam

removal, they are time-consuming and inefficient (Hare and Chua, 2002). The approach
of co-transformation with multiple transgenes has a number of variants: mixing two
(or more) different Agrobacteria each carrying a different binary vector, combining two
T-DNAs on a single plasmid within an Agrobacterium strain or using one Agrobacterium
carrying two compatible plasmids each with a different T-DNA. These approaches were
investigated in our group using potato, with some success in generating transgenic lines
at expected rates containing both genes of interest. These approaches have been discussed
by Komari et al. (1996) and Daley et al. (1998).

30.3.2.2 Clean gene technologies

There has been considerable interest in the development of systems for the production
of marker-free transgenic plants, which are considered more acceptable to consumers.
Indeed, EU legislation will necessitate the removal of such ‘extra’ DNA sequences in
transgenic plants in the near future. The range of options used is wide, ranging from
attempts to transform without using selectable markers and screening the regenerants by
phenotypic or molecular markers to highly sophisticated transposon-based gene removal
systems. The first approach relies on a very high transformation efficiency and low
cost of screening and has yet to be widely adopted. Transformation rates, in potato,
using such an approach have been cited at 0.2% (De Vetten et al., 2003) compared with
40% using selection (Millam, 2005). Marker removal systems have been developed, but
problems include the complexity of methods such as inducible recombination systems
(Zuo et al., 2001). Other approaches tend to be scientifically complex and not yet suitable
for widespread adoption (Halpin, 2005).

30.3.2.3 ‘Vectorless’ transformation systems – vectors assembled only from

potato-derived sequences

There have been several recent reports of a potentially useful variant of transformation
technology, whereby native genes and regulatory elements can be reintroduced into plants,
in this instance, potato, without the need to use selectable markers (Rommens, 2004;
Rommens et al., 2004). These findings offer some new approaches. By combining the
rapid increase in the use of native plant genes for transformation targets (rather than those
derived from bacterial or viral sources), the use of native regulatory elements (promoters
and terminators) and the avoidance of foreign markers, the system offers a number
of advantages over existing transformation methodologies. A problem in conventional
transformation methodologies is the unwanted transfer of ‘backbone’ DNA from the
Agrobacterium vector, containing bacterial genetic elements such as origins of replication
and antibiotic-resistant genes used for bacterial selection. Rommens (2004) describes
the discovery of plant transfer DNAs (P-DNAs) that resemble Agrobacterium T-DNA
borders and were demonstrated to support DNA transfer from Agrobacterium to plant
cells creating ‘intragenic’ plants. The second report by the same authors describes the
first example of genetically engineered plants that contain only native DNA, including
potatoes engineered to have reduced the expression of a tuber-specific polyphenol oxidase
(PPO) gene. This work clearly has great potential for future studies.

Developments in transgenic biology

30.3.2.4 Plastid transformation

Most transformation methodologies are targeted towards nuclear transformation although
some elegant work has been done using chloroplast transformation, largely limited to
tobacco, although one earlier report exists in potato using a selected breeding line (Sidorov
et al., 1999). Plastid transformation offers some advantages in that there would be no posi-
tion effects as the genes of interest are introduced into the plastome through homologous
recombination. This approach is an alternative method for the generation of marker-
free lines, but is complex. The approach transforms plants with constructs that contain
reconstitution elements and a gene of interest cloned within flanks used for homolo-
gous recombination and marker gene outwith these flanks. With the removal of selection
pressure, a process known as ‘loop out’ recombination leads to the loss of co-integrates
(Klaus et al., 2004). The generation of homoplastic transformants of a commercial cultivar
(Desiree) of potato was reported by Nguyen et al. (2005). In this work, integration and
expression of foreign genes into the plastid genome of potato was achieved.

30.3.2.5 Particle bombardment

The technique of particle bombardment (syn. biolistics) was developed in the late 1980s
and is widely used in the transformation of cereals and legumes. The principal rationale
for using biolistics for plant transformation is in its use for species that are problematic
to regenerate in vitro, and potato does not fall into such a category. However, there
have been reports of its use to transform potato (Romano et al., 2001, 2003), but such a
system has not been widely adopted due to the more complex integration patterns that
occur. These, of course, could be simplified if a passage of meiosis occurs, but due to
the vegetative propagation system in potato, this is not possible. Furthermore, efficiency
of transformation by this method is 0.1–10%, whereas by Agrobacterium, it can be up
to 100%. However, a recent report (Romano et al., 2005) describes how the synthesis of
microbial polyesters has been attempted in transgenic potato using this approach, offering
possibilities for a novel application of transgenic potatoes.

30.3.2.6 Gene silencing

Potato viruses cause significant economic losses to crops, and the avoidance of virus
infection is a major factor in the design and application of seed potato production pro-
grammes. However, potato viruses also have the potential to be used as biotechnological
tools for the introduction of novel traits into the crop (Chapter 28, Valkonen, this volume).
Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a tool that exploits an RNA-mediated anti-viral
defence mechanism, triggered by incoming viruses, to target individual genes for silenc-
ing. In plants infected with unmodified viruses, the process is specifically targeted against
the viral genome. However, with modified virus vectors carrying inserts derived from the
host genes, the process can be additionally targeted against the corresponding mRNAs.
The discoveries, that plants co-suppress their own genes if they are transformed with
homologous transgenes and that plants recognize and degrade invading viral RNA, have
resulted in new models for plant intercellular communication and defence mechanisms
(Robertson, 2004). Historically, transgene expression in plants was not found to be pre-
dictable, and in some cases, transgene expression was lost during development or in

678

Millam

subsequent generations (Allen et al., 2000). It was further found that not only the trans-
gene but also the endogenous gene expression was subject to silencing, and despite active
transcription, mRNA levels for both genes were found to have decreased (Napoli et al.,
1990). This process was termed post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Both anti-
sense and sense-mediated suppression of gene expression were commonly used as a tool
for the down-regulation of target genes in plants, including potato (Romer at al., 2002).
Two recent developments associated with such technology are RNAi (interfering RNA
from dsRNA) and siRNA-mediated (the use of 22-nt oligonucleotide dimers) silencing in
plants. Virus-induced gene silencing has been used to silence a wide variety of genes in
plants (Robertson, 2004). It has been used to generate transient loss-of-function assays and
also has potential as a powerful reverse-genetics tool in functional genomic programmes,
as a more rapid alternative to stable transformation. There have been recent reports of
the use of VIGS for dissecting signalling factors in disease resistance, such as the in
N-mediated resistance against tobacco mosaic virus (Peart et al., 2002). Until recently,
most applications of VIGS have been in Nicotiana benthamiana; however, a potato virus
X (PVX) VIGS vector was shown to be effective in triggering a VIGS response in both
diploid and cultivated tetraploid Solanum species. It was shown (Faivre-Rampant et al.,
2004) that a systemic silencing of a phytoene desaturase gene was observed and main-
tained throughout the foliar tissues of potato plants and, significantly, was also observed
in tubers. It was further reported that VIGS can be triggered and sustained on in vitro
micropropagated tetraploid potato for several cycles and on in vitro-generated microtu-
bers. Another paper (Brigneti et al., 2004) produced similar findings but used a tobacco
rattle virus (TRV) vector. In terms of risk assessment, the use of recombinant viruses
requires approval from the relevant plant pathogen licensing authorities. Notably, the use
of entire RNA viruses requires a high level of containment to avoid accidental trans-
mission. However, in the future, VIGS approaches will facilitate large-scale functional
analysis of potato expressed sequence tags and provide a non-invasive reverse-genetic
approach to study mechanisms involved in developmental processes in potato.

30.4 THE GENETIC ENGINEERING OF USEFUL TRAITS

The genetic modification of potato cultivars by Agrobacterium (or any of the other
methods described above in Sections 30.3.2.3, 30.3.2.4 and 30.3.2.5) offers the possibility
of introducing genes into the potato genome that are not present in cultivated potatoes, and
their wild relatives, and hence of the introduction of novel biochemical and desirable traits
into this important crop plant. Since the first reports of the genetic manipulation of potato
in 1986 and the development of more efficient model systems, the range of introduced
genes has significantly increased, as has the complexity and durability of the traits altered.
The genes used to date in transformation studies have mainly coded for proteins
that are toxic to pests and pathogens, sequences whose expression interferes with virus
multiplication in host cells and genes that code for key enzymes in biochemical pathways
in other organisms, often, but not always, derived from other plant species. With the
increasing amount of metabolomic and genomic information becoming available, the

Developments in transgenic biology

679

precise mechanisms of biochemical and host plant: pathogen interactions are becoming
more clearly understood, and thus, transgenic intervention strategies can be designed
more precisely.

30.4.1 Resistance to major pests and diseases

The major driver for research and development into this aspect is evident, due to the
substantial crop losses attributable to the effect of pathogens, not only during the growing
season but, in the case of potato tubers, also during storage. However, a secondary
factor in the substantial research effort made in this area is that many of the resistance
mechanisms could be introduced by a single gene, which was the only available strategy
until the development of methods for introducing multiple genes was demonstrated on an
efficient scale in the late 1990s. A further consideration is that much of the (expensive)
research has been undertaken in laboratories associated directly, or indirectly, with the
major agrochemical manufacturers.

30.4.1.1 Colorado potato beetle

Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) is a major pest in North America
and elsewhere. The CPB is notorious for its ability to rapidly develop resistance to
insecticides that are used repeatedly for control. Insecticides having the same class of
chemical structure will often have the same mode of action. Consequently, resistance
develops more rapidly to an insecticide when used repeatedly as the only control measure.
Additionally, the repeated use of one class kills the susceptible beetles, leaving those that
are resistant, i.e. selecting for the resistant population. Consequently, to delay or prevent
resistance, a complicated and expensive crop protection strategy involving insecticide
rotation is necessary. Transgenic resistance was developed with the introduction of a
gene that encodes the Cry3A protein derived from the bacterium B. thuringiensis var.
tenebrionis and expressed in potato using the constitutive 35S cauliflower mosaic virus
(CaMV 35S) promoter. The strategy was so successful that such plants were the first GM
potato varieties to be commercialized by Monsanto using the varieties Russet Burbank,
Atlantic, Snowden and Superior in North America from 1995 to 2001 (Duncan et al.,
2002). Extensive testing of the Bt-protected crops had established their safety for humans,
animals and the environment, but (Section 30.2) the product was withdrawn in 2001
mainly for commercial rather than agronomic reasons.

30.4.1.2 Potato tuber moth

Potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) is a troublesome pest of potatoes and is
found in warm tropical and subtropical climates. It is the most damaging pest of potatoes
in fields and stores in warm, dry areas of the world, such as North Africa and the
Middle East, Mexico, Central America and the inter-Andean valleys of South America.
Transgenic resistance has been provided by the Bt protein encoded by the cry5 gene
(Mohammed et al., 2000) and by the cry1Ac9 gene (Davidson et al., 2004), again using
the constitutive 35S CaMV promoter. Davidson et al. (2004) demonstrated that their
transgenic potato lines exhibited stable resistance to larvae across field seasons, between
affected plant organs and between plant organs of different ages.

680

Millam

30.4.1.3 Potato cyst nematodes

Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pallida [potato cyst nematodes (PCN)] are the
major pests of potatoes in Great Britain and elsewhere. A recent survey of soil samples
taken by UK growers revealed that up to 60% of the land cropped with potatoes in the UK
is infested with PCN. The annual loss to the UK potato industry as a direct consequence
of PCN has been estimated at approximately 9% of crop value, worth around £43 million
in 2004. It has been found that in highly infested soil, there may be several thousand
nematodes per gram of potato root. Furthermore, even in low to medium infestations,
some degree of crop loss will result and the numbers of PCN will multiply, thus increasing
the problem for subsequent potato crops. In the worst case scenario, in fields with
high PCN infestations, complete crop loss is possible (http://www.syngenta-crop.co.uk).
A number of transgenic strategies have been proposed to control nematodes, but due to
the complexity of the life cycle and infestation methods, control has been difficult. Urwin
et al. (2003) were able to demonstrate that constructs based on a cysteine proteinase
inhibitor (cystatin) from sunflower and a protein-engineered variant of a rice cystatin
conferred similar levels of resistance to PCN as chicken egg white cystatin (CEWC) under
the control of CaMV35S, and in a field trial, these levels of resistance were similar to
that provided by the natural partial resistance of cultivar Sante. Transformation of Sante
and the South American cultivar Maria Huanca with CaMV35S/CEWC raised the status
of both cultivars from partial to full resistance.

30.4.1.4 Viruses PLRV and PVY

Potato leafroll (PLRV) and potato Y (PVY) are the two most serious virus diseases
of potatoes worldwide. PLRV causes both qualitative and quantitative damage and is
transmitted in a persistent manner by several aphid species. Also, the virus infects other
Solanaceous crops and weeds. Potato virus Y is readily spread by aphids in a non-
persistent manner as well as mechanically by human activity and may result in severely
depressed yields. Sense and antisense RNA-mediated resistance to PLRV was engineered
into Russet Burbank potato plants in 1991 (Kawchuk et al., 1991), and this work was
expanded to generate Russet Burbank potatoes in which CPB resistance was combined
with resistance to PLRV provided by a construct designed to prevent virus replication
using the constitutive Figwort mosaic virus (FMV) promoter. Russet Burbank and Shep-
ody potatoes have also been produced with combined CPB and PVY resistance, the latter
provided by the PVY coat protein gene, again using the FMV promoter. In both these
examples, the process started with about 3000 original transgenic potato clones in 1991
from which six were finally selected for commercialization in 1998 (Davies, 2002). Trait
stability has been demonstrated in field trials over a number of years, as has the greatly
reduced use of pesticides (Duncan et al., 2002).

30.4.1.5 Bacteria and fungi

Owing to the complexity of the host: pathogen response, progress in engineering bacterial
and fungal resistance into potato (and other crop plants) has been less rapid than with other
traits. Genes coding for lytic enzymes from bacteriophage to humans are being evaluated

Developments in transgenic biology

681

in a number of laboratories worldwide as a method to achieve transgenic resistance
to a number of bacteria and fungi. For example, the gene chly encoding the enzyme
lysozyme from chicken has been introduced into cultivar Desiree through Agrobacterium-
mediated transformation and shown to enhance resistance to blackleg and soft rot caused
by infection with Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Serrano et al., 2000).

30.4.2 Tuber quality traits

30.4.2.1 Anti-bruise potatoes

Bruise resistance is important in potatoes, as mechanical damage initiates enzymic brown-
ing which results in the production of black, brown and red pigments and either crop
rejection by processors or waste during processing. A transgenic solution to the problem
can be provided by the down-regulation of PPO gene expression so that the reaction
leading to pigment production is no longer catalysed by the enzyme PPO (Bachem et al.,
1994). The results of a 4-year field trial of transgenic Desiree showed that the average
rotting caused by Ec-bacteria was diminished in tubers of pectic lyase (PL)-transgenic
lines by 34.1%, and the resistance of tubers to Ec soft rot was significantly correlated
with the PPO activity in tuber tissue (Wegener, 2001).

30.4.2.2 Reduced glycoalkaloid content

Steroidal glycoalkaloids are a class of potentially toxic compounds with a bitter taste,
which are found throughout the family Solanaceae. Cultivars vary with regard to their
inherent tuber glycoalkaloid content. Levels above 20 mg per 100 g fresh weight are con-
sidered unsuitable for human consumption as they can cause various symptoms typically
associated with food poisoning. Although breeders check potential cultivars for unaccept-
ably high levels, particularly where pedigrees involve wild species, a transgenic option
for further reduction would be useful. Initial reports of down-regulating a gene encoding a
sterol alkaloid glycosyltransferase (Sgt1) and an almost complete inhibition of (cid:2)-solanine
accumulation which was compensated by elevated levels of (cid:2)-chaconine (McCue et al.,
2005) have been made; however, further transformation will be required to inhibit cha-
conine accumulation. Of more general interest, transgenic potato plants overexpressing a
soybean [(type 1 sterol methyltransferase (GmSMT1)] cDNA were generated and used to
study sterol biosynthesis in relation to the production of toxic glycoalkaloids (Arnqvist
et al., 2003). The results show that glycoalkaloid biosynthesis can be down-regulated in
transgenic potato plants by reducing the content of free non-alkylated sterols and support
the view of cholesterol as a precursor in glycoalkaloid biosynthesis.

30.4.3 Nutritional value

30.4.3.1 Protein and amino acid content

Chakraborty et al. (2000) reported improvements in the nutritive value of potato through
transformation with a non-allergenic seed albumin gene (AmA1) from Amaranthus
hypochondriacus. The seed protein has a well-balanced amino acid composition with

682

Millam

no known allergenic properties. Five- to ten-fold increases in transcript levels in tubers
were achieved using the tuber-specific GBSS promoter compared with the 35S CaMV
promoter. Significant two- to four-fold increases were achieved in the lysine, methionine,
cysteine and tyrosine content of the protein amino acids, and a 35–45% increase was
achieved in total protein content.

30.4.3.2 Inulin

Inulin is a mixture of linear fructose polymers with different chain length and a glucose
molecule at each C2 end. Inulin belongs to the fructan group of polysaccharides and serves
as a carbohydrate storage in many plant species. Compounds such as inulin reduce the
energy density of food and are used to enrich food with dietary fibre or to replace sugar and
fat. Hellwege et al. (2000) have developed transgenic potato tubers which synthesize the
full range of inulin molecules naturally occurring in globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus).
High-molecular-weight inulins have been produced by expressing the sucrose : sucrose
1-fructosyl transferase and the fructan : fructan 1-fructosylhydrolase genes from globe
artichoke. Inulin made up 5% of the dry weight (DW) of the transgenic tuber.

30.4.3.3 Carotenoids

Yellow and orange flesh colour comes from a class of pigments known as carotenoids
(e.g. zeaxanthin) which are also antioxidants with health-promoting attributes. Hence,
their enhancement by breeding provides an opportunity to improve the nutritive value of
potatoes and processed foods made from potatoes (Brown, 2005). Transgenic approaches
are also possible as Romer et al. (2002) discovered that tuber-specific down-regulation
of the zeaxanthin epoxidase gene in S. tuberosum increased not only the amount of
zeaxanthin that accumulated but also the total carotenoid level by up to 5.7-fold of the
controls. Recent work on the underlying mechanisms of carotenogenesis during tuber
development and storage in potato has been reported (Morris et al., 2004), and in further
work by the same group, it was found that in developing tubers of transgenic Desiree
(using an Erwinia uredovora crtB gene encoding phytoene synthase) lines, carotenoid
levels reached 35 (cid:3)g carotenoid g DW, and the balance of carotenoids changed radically
compared with controls (Ducreux et al., 2005a). The crtB gene was also transformed
into S. phureja (cultivar Mayan Gold), again resulting in an increase in total carotenoid
content to 78 (cid:3)g carotenoid g DW in the most affected transgenic line (Ducreux et al.,
2005a,b).

30.4.3.4 Starch

Starch is the primary storage compound in tubers. It is also widely used for a range of
industrial processes. The physical properties of starch vary with plant source, but there
are considerable opportunities to generate novel starches for use in food and non-food
market sectors (Davis et al., 2003). Genetic engineering has already generated novel
potato starches of which the two extremes are high amylopectin starch and high amylose
starch. High amylopectin starch was produced by the down-regulation of the GBSS
gene that controls amylose synthesis (Visser et al., 1991). In contrast, to produce high

Developments in transgenic biology

683

amylose starch, it was necessary to concurrently down-regulate two starch branching
enzymes, A and B (Schwall et al., 2000). Field trialling confirmed the stability of the
modification over years and demonstrated an increased tuber yield, reduced starch content,
smaller granule size and an increase in reducing sugars (Hofvander et al., 2004). Potatoes
containing starch with a very low degree of branching, such as 0.3%, were not suitable for
commercial cultivation due to severe starch yield reduction and other effects. However,
with slightly more branching, the effects were much reduced, and the modified starch
was considered suitable for biodegradable plastics, expanded products and film-forming
operations.

30.4.3.5 Reducing sugars

(cid:2)

C)
Ideally, the potato industry would like to store tubers at low temperatures (about 4
to minimize sprout growth and eliminate the need to use chemicals to suppress the
sprouting process. However, low temperatures induce glucose and fructose accumulation,
and these reducing sugars are primarily responsible for non-enzymic browning through
a typical Maillard reaction that occurs at temperatures required to generate potato chips
(crisps) and French fries. Whilst breeders have been able to select for lower levels of
reducing sugars out of cold storage, transgenic approaches are also possible based on an
understanding of primary carbohydrate metabolism. Stark et al. (1992) increased tuber
starch content and lowered the levels of reducing sugars by expressing an E. coli glgC16
mutant gene that encodes for the enzyme ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase and increases
the production of ADPglucose, which in turn becomes incorporated into the growing
starch granule. Greiner et al. (1999) were able to minimize the conversion of sucrose to
glucose and fructose by expressing a putative vacuolar invertase inhibitor protein from
tobacco, called Nt-inhh, in potato plants under the control of the CaMV35S promoter. See
also http://www.nf-2000.org/secure/crops/potato.html for a report on the field trialling of
a range of transgenic potato lines engineered for modified reducing sugar content.

30.5 SUMMARY AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

Since the first report of transformation in potato in 1986, the technology has developed
considerably, both in terms of the range of germplasm and the number and complexity
of traits successfully introduced into the potato. The potato has been a model crop for
transformation, due to the relative ease of A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation, but
developments in areas such as VIGS may lead to hitherto unconsidered possibilities for
testing genes and host: pathogen interactions. Potato is an important staple food crop,
the fourth most important in the world, and one with great potential for development in
developing countries. Transformation projects have been designed to enhance the nutri-
tional quality of potato tubers with some success in the lab and glasshouse (Chakraborty
et al., 2000; Ducreux et al., 2005a), but many field trials of such material have been
precluded due to the constrictive legislation regarding transgenic crops in Europe. Never-
theless, such approaches towards the nutritional enhancement of such an important crop
will continue in future as knowledge of the potato genome and the processes controlling
pathways increase.

Other areas for future transgenic progress will be in using tubers as biorefineries for
valuable products, either by conventional transformation, for example the expression and
production of recombinant human interleukin-2 in potato plants (Park and Cheong, 2002)
and the expression of antibodies and Fab fragments in transgenic potato plants (De Wilde
et al., 2002), or by biolistics (Romano et al., 2005) or plastid transformation (Nguyen
et al., 2005). Biological processes and biosynthetic pathway elucidation will also be
enhanced, and further insights into the mechanisms of disease resistance such as the role
of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in blight resistance (Yamamizo et al., 2006),
tuber life cycle and dormancy will be mediated by the transformation of this important
species.

Potato will continue to be at the forefront of transformation technology, and develop-
ments in this area offer exciting challenges for future crop improvement, sustainability
and scientific advancement.

31.1 INTRODUCTION

For many years, the cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) has been at the forefront
of genetic engineering developments in crop plants. Many research institutes and private
companies have targeted potato improvement through the transformation of existing
cultivars with specific genes. This is a consequence of the importance of the potato
crop throughout the world, the relative ease with which the crop can be transformed
and genetic limitations associated with traditional potato breeding (Conner et al., 1997).
Improvements in characters such as resistance to pests and diseases and specific quality
attributes are widely anticipated to allow potato breeders to respond much more quickly to
the market need for new and improved cultivars. The anticipated result is higher quality,
blemish-free tubers with reduced chemical residues as demanded by the processors and
consumers (Conner et al., 1997).

Despite the considerable potential for highly targeted improvement of potato cultivars,
the release and agricultural deployment of transgenic crops have raised public concerns
on environmental issues and food safety (Nap et al., 2003). This is well reflected in
potatoes, with only a very limited number of transgenic events receiving full approval
for commercial release (Nap et al., 2003). Two of these events involve potatoes with
resistance to Colorado potato beetle (cry3A gene), with other events involving this trait
plus resistance to potato leafroll virus (putative viral helicase and replicase genes) or
resistance to potato virus Y (PVY) (viral coat protein gene) (Nap et al., 2003). Despite the
considerable promise of potatoes possessing these traits and the anticipated environmental
benefits from reduced pesticide applications, these events have essentially failed in the
market place due to consumer perception issues.

The limited commercial success of transgenic potatoes to date has not deterred the
ongoing development of transgenic potato cultivars with improved agronomic and qual-
ity traits. Such research continues throughout the world, primarily in research insti-
tutes. This is well evident by the ongoing activity associated with the field-testing of
transgenic potatoes. Records of approvals/permits issued for experimental field tests
of transgenic crops around the world can be found in various databases, although
there are many discrepancies between different sources of information. The Biotrack
database of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)

(http://www.webdominol.oecd.org/ehs/biotrack.nsf) contains approvals/permits issued for
experimental field tests of genetically modified (GM) organisms in its 30-member
countries until 1999. It currently records over 1185 permits issued for field-testing of
transgenic potatoes between 1986 and 1999 (Table 31.1). The European Summary Noti-
fication Information Format (SNIF) database on Biotechnology and genetically modified
organisms (GMOs) (http://biotech.jrc.it/deliberate/gmo.asp) lists 256 field tests on potato
within the EU, whereas the database of the Information Systems for Biotechnology
(http://www.isb.vt.edu/cfdocs/fieldtests1.cfm) lists 764 field tests in the USA till May
2006. This latter figure includes 162 field tests on potato from 2000 and is therefore
notably inconsistent with the 830 field tests listed in the OECD database for the USA
before 2000.

The numbers of approvals/permits in databases do not necessarily reflect the actual
number of field releases performed due to the varying approval procedures in different
countries (Nap et al., 2003). Some countries require separate applications for every
specific modification in a specific plant for each location and year. In contrast, other
countries will issue a single approval/permit for applications involving groups of GM
crops with a range of different transgenes over multiple sites and/or years. In many non-
OECD countries of Asia, Africa, South America and eastern Europe, the number of field

tests on transgenic crops, including potatoes, has rapidly increased in recent years (Nap
et al., 2003). The total number of field tests on transgenic potatoes is likely to exceed two
thousand between 1986 and 2006. The vast majority of field tests on transgenic potatoes
has occurred in the USA, with considerable activity also occurring in Canada, Germany
and the Netherlands (Table 31.1).

The motivation for the ongoing development of transgenic potato cultivars lies in the
immense opportunities provided by genetic engineering for the efficient genetic improve-
ment of potatoes to mitigate many global problems associated with the potato industry. The
field-testing of transgenic potatoes is a key component of all research programmes inves-
tigating genetic engineering for potato improvement. This chapter summarizes important
considerations for field-testing transgenic potatoes. The intention is to illustrate these
issues with key examples, rather than to provide an exhaustive survey of the scientific
literature.

31.2 TRANSGENIC POTATOES IN THE CONTEXT OF POTATO

BREEDING

Potato breeding has been highly successful over the past century. Traditional breeding
methods involve the hybridization of parental clones and the subsequent selection among
large seedling populations for superior individuals with the desired combination of traits
(Plaisted et al., 1994). Single-plant selections are then propagated vegetatively and eval-
uated as clones for relevant agronomic and quality attributes. This general approach
to potato breeding has resulted in the development of many elite clones, which have
become highly successful potato cultivars. More information can be found in Chapter 8
(Bradshaw, this volume).
The autotetraploid status (cid:2)2n = 4x = 48(cid:3) of virtually all commercial potato culti-
vars presents one of the major difficulties associated with traditional potato breeding.
The resulting tetrasomic inheritance, in conjunction with the associated high heterozy-
gosity, adds considerable complexity to potato breeding (Conner et al., 1997). These
difficulties require exceptionally large populations of potato seedlings to be screened
to recover individuals for evaluation as potential cultivars. Initial selection for many
desirable characters can often be inefficient and/or time consuming. Potato breeders
often have to screen up to a million seedlings to find one clonal line that survives
through to the release of a successful cultivar (Plaisted et al., 1994). The main objec-
tives of most potato breeding programmes involve the improvement of specific pro-
cessing attributes and resistance to pests and diseases, while maintaining or improving
traits such as tuber colour, shape and yield. Since the 1950s, achieving many of these
traits has been greatly assisted by the transfer of genes from related Solanum species
(Ross, 1986).

Potatoes were one of the first crop plants in which transgenic plants were successfully
regenerated (An et al., 1986; Shanin and Simpson, 1986). Potato transformation has
since become routine in many laboratories and offers new opportunities to transfer genes
for cultivar improvement. The introgression of new genes through the development

690

Conner

of transgenic potatoes has several advantages over other breeding methods for potato
improvement:

1. the widening of the germplasm base from which new characters can be transferred to

any source of DNA;

2. the effective transfer of new genes directly into existing elite cultivars without many

generations of additional crosses;

3. the ability to limit gene transfer to discrete genes without many unknown closely

linked genes often associated with negative traits (linkage drag); and

4. the opportunity to develop new gene formulations involving promoter-swapping to
target gene expression in a specific manner and/or using gene knock-down strategies
such as RNA interference.

Using genetic engineering approaches has allowed the successful transfer of numerous
transgenes into elite potato cultivars. These transgenes confer a wide range of traits,
including pest and disease resistance, quality attributes for improved processing and
nutrition and appearance and novel protein production for biopharming (Vayda and
Belknap, 1992; Conner et al., 1997). Many further examples of transgene expression
conferring specific traits, too numerous to mention here, have been published since 1997
(Chapter 30, Millam, this volume).

Plant transformation is highly unpredictable with respect to the nature of transgene
integration, the magnitude, specificity and stability of transgene expression and the fre-
quency of off-types observed within populations of independently derived transformed
plants (Conner and Christey, 1994). Potatoes are no exception (Conner et al., 1997). In
this context, the use of transformation for crop improvement and the intended release of
superior cultivars involve ‘playing the numbers game’. It is important to select a large
population of independently transformed individuals in the laboratory and then screen the
population to identify the lines with the desired expression of the transgene, while main-
taining the phenotype and yield performance of the parental cultivar. In this respect, plant
improvement through transformation is very similar to traditional breeding. A greater
chance of success results from a larger programme with thorough evaluation of the lines.
If the ‘numbers game’ is played correctly, potato transformation offers a highly effec-
tive means of adding single genes to existing elite clones with no, or very minimal,
disturbances to their genetic background. This is virtually impossible through traditional
breeding because the genetic integrity of potato clones is instantly lost due to allele segre-
gation upon sexual reproduction. This is a direct consequence of the high heterozygosity
in the tetraploid potato genome. As a consequence, in potato and other clonal crops,
transformation represents the only effective way to produce isogenic lines of specific
genotypes/cultivars (Conner and Christey, 1994). For these reasons, transgenic potato
cultivars will most likely be maintained as clonal lines from the primary transformants
initially regenerated from tissue culture through to commercial release. Such cultivars will
therefore be hemizygous for transgene insertion events. For tetraploid potato cultivars,
this means that the transgenes will be represented in the simplex state (Aaaa) (Conner
et al., 1997).

Although transformation provides a mechanism for gene transfer to existing potato
cultivars without compromising existing attributes, in reality, it is not quite that simple.
The insertion and expression of transgenes, as well as the tissue culture processes asso-
ciated with gene transfer, can all impose important constraints that limit the performance
of the resulting transgenic line.

31.3 THE IMPORTANCE OF FIELD-TESTING TRANSGENIC POTATOES

31.3.1 Field confirmation of transgenic phenotype

Many of the first reports on field tests of transgenic potatoes were largely focused on
confirming that the phenotypic performance conferred by the transgene was maintained
under field conditions. A high correlation between greenhouse and field performance
of transgenic traits was frequently reported. For example, for transgenic potato lines
expressing a cry1Ac9 gene conferring tuber moth resistance, a correlation coefficient of
r = 0(cid:4)98 was obtained for larval growth indices from bioassays on foliage from greenhouse
and field-grown plants (Davidson et al., 2002a). High correlations between the greenhouse
and field are especially common when a large population of independently derived
transgenic lines are compared. However, such high correlations represent a summary of the
response at a population level and provide no guarantee that the greenhouse performance
will translate to field conditions for any specific transgenic line. For example, when
evaluating a large number of transgenic potato lines expressing a cry1Ac9 gene conferring
tuber moth resistance, exceptions were noted where insect resistance on greenhouse
foliage was not matched with field resistance (Davidson et al., 2002b).

The failure of specific transgenic lines to exhibit the expected transgenic phenotype
under field conditions has been frequently reported across a wide range of transgenic
phenotypes. The frequency of plants developing viral infection was greater under field
conditions, compared with prior experiments in growth chamber, in three of four trans-
genic lines expressing the viral coat protein genes of potato virus X (PVX) and PVY
(Kaniewski et al., 1990). Similarly, one of three transgenic lines with high herbicide
(chlorsulfuron) resistance in laboratory and greenhouse studies exhibited slight toxic-
ity symptoms following herbicide applications in the field (Moses et al., 1993). Stable
expression in field-grown tubers of an antisense granule-bound starch synthase gene con-
ferring amylose-free starch (red staining with iodine) was only apparent in one of four
transgenic lines selected from in vitro and greenhouse assays (Kuipers et al., 1992; Heeres
et al., 2002).

These results illustrate the critical importance of verifying that transgenes confer the
desired phenotype under field conditions. This is especially important when identifying
specific transgenic lines for further research. The failure of some transgenic lines to
perform under field conditions may be related to position effects associated with specific
integration events (Conner and Christey, 1994). Because transgene expression can vary
with environmental conditions (Broer, 1996), the choice of promoter for transcriptional
regulation of the transgene may be an important consideration. It is also possible that the
greater fluctuations of environmental conditions associated with growth in the field result

in subtle dynamic changes in the flux of biochemical pathways towards the biosynthesis
of many interacting metabolites. As a consequence, a higher threshold of transgene
expression at the molecular level may be necessary to maintain a specific phenotype in
the field.

In some cases, it is not possible to perform meaningful assessment of transgenic pheno-
types under laboratory or greenhouse conditions. For example, when expressing transgenes
encoding antimicrobial peptides in potatoes for soft rot resistance, it was necessary to use
field-grown tuber for bioassays against Erwinia (Barrell, 2002). New Zealand regulatory
guidelines require transgenic plants to be container-grown in containment greenhouses.
Potato plants grown in pots or bags are expected to produce tubers that vary markedly
in physiological properties within and between tubers as a consequence of the physical
constraint imposed on tuber growth and expansion, especially for tubers developing near
the sides of the container. In the case of tuber bioassays against Erwinia, this resulted
in a high variance within and between plants of the same clone, which overshadowed
any statistical differences between transgenic lines and non-transgenic parental controls.
It is likely that analysis of other transgenic traits in tubers is also obscured by such
limitations.

31.3.2 Occurrence of off-types

Most of the early studies reporting yield performance of transgenic potato in field tests
involved only a small number of transgenic lines, for example, four lines expressing
viral coat protein genes of PVX and PVY (Kaniewski et al., 1990); four lines expressing
a herbicide (glufosinate/bialaphos) resistance gene (de Greef et al., 1989); four lines
expressing an antisense granule-bound starch synthase gene (Kuipers et al., 1992); three
lines with herbicide (chlorsulfuron) resistance (Moses et al., 1993) and one line expressing
PVY coat protein gene (Malnoë et al., 1994). These studies generally report tuber yield
of transgenic lines similar to the non-transgenic parental cultivar, although in some cases,
a few transgenic lines had slightly reduced yield (Kuipers et al., 1992; Moses et al.,
1993). It is not clear in these studies the extent to which the transgenic lines tested in
the field had been pre-selected for phenotypic appearance similar to the non-transgenic
control under either greenhouse conditions or previous field trials. Although these studies
were important to establish that transgenic potatoes could be developed without changing
the intrinsic properties of elite commercial potato cultivars, the results presented do not
represent the performance of most transgenic lines developed in the laboratory.

The first field evaluations of transgenic potatoes involving large numbers of indepen-
dently derived transgenic lines commonly reported marked phenotypic changes in plant
appearance and/or significantly reduced tuber yield in many transgenic potato lines (Dale
and McPartlan, 1992; Jongedijk et al., 1992; Belknap et al., 1994; Conner et al., 1994). In
some instances, dramatic changes in plant appearance involving stunted growth, altered
shoot morphology, markedly reduced yield and/or plant death were reported (e.g. Dale
and McPartlan, 1992; Belknap et al., 1994; Conner et al., 1994). Typical foliage off-
types include short internodes, pronounced rolling of apical leaves, small cupped leaves,
wrinkled leaf surface, smaller rugose leaflets and twisted petioles, whereas typical tuber
off-types include a large number of small tubers, small and elongated tubers, deep eyes,

Field-testing of transgenic potatoes

693

knobbly tubers from secondary growths, loss of skin colour and russetting (Belknap et al.,
1994; Conner et al., 1994; Davidson et al., 2002b). In general terms, the appearance of
aberrant foliage is usually accompanied by reduced tuber yield (Fig. 31.1).

At the time, it was important to understand the basis for these unexpected phenotypes
in transgenic potatoes. Although many of the phenotypic changes in foliage were similar
to symptoms of viral infection, virus testing quickly established that they occurred inde-
pendent of the presence of viruses (Conner et al., 1994). When field-tested for the first
time, transgenic potatoes are usually established from transplants micropropagated in tis-
sue culture. The observed off-types were consistent when transgenic lines were replanted
in the second year from tubers harvested in the first year (Belknap et al., 1994; Conner
et al., 1994), thereby eliminating a transient response to tissue culture. Other possible
explanations for the unexpected phenotypic changes included pleiotropic effects of trans-
gene expression, insertional mutagenesis resulting from random integration into the plant
genome and/or somaclonal variation arising during tissue culture. It is often difficult to
discern between these options when phenotypic changes are observed in transgenic plants
such as potato, which are highly heterozygous and already segregate for a multitude of
other genes affecting phenotypic appearance (Conner and Christey, 1994).

If the unexpected phenotypes result from pleiotropic effects of transgene expression,
then all the transgenic lines expressing the same transgene are expected to show a similar
phenotypic change. The recovery of some transgenic lines with high transgene expression
in the field as well as a phenotypic appearance identical to the ‘parental’ cultivar suggests
that phenotypic changes in other lines are unlikely to result from pleiotropic effects
of transgene expression (Dale and McPartlan, 1992; Conner et al., 1994). Transgenic
potato cultivars are usually maintained as clonal lines from the primary transformants
through to commercial release (Section 31.2). Deviant phenotypes resulting from gene
disruption generally require the transgene to be in a homozygous state, which does not
occur in the initial transformants regenerated from tissue culture. Therefore, insertional
mutagenic events are not expected to be observed among the plants originating as the
primary transformants regenerated from tissue culture, except in very rare instances of
gene activation (Conner and Christey, 1994).

The appearance of off-type transgenic potato lines in field tests has been commonly
attributed to ‘somaclonal variation’ (Dale and McPartlan, 1992; Belknap et al., 1994;
Conner et al., 1994). The occurrence of somaclonal variation among plants regenerated
from cell culture has been well documented for many years, including field-grown pota-
toes (Shepard et al., 1980; Secor and Shepard, 1981; Potter and Jones, 1991). These
events arise from random epigenetic or genetic events during the cell culture and plant
regeneration phase of transformation and are often apparent in the primary transgenic
plants initially regenerated following transformation (Phillips et al., 1994; Veilleux and
Johnson, 1998). Therefore, the occurrence of some transgenic potato lines that differ
in the phenotypic appearance of the ‘parental’ cultivar is to be expected. The spectrum
of off-type appearances is expected to vary markedly between different independently
selected transgenic lines (Conner and Christey, 1994).

A comprehensive study on the frequency of off-types among field-grown transgenic
potato lines was undertaken by Jongedijk et al. (1992). They compared the field perfor-
mance of tuber-grown progeny from independently derived transgenic lines of cultivars

Fig. 31.1. Summary of yield performance for transgenic potato lines resulting from Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation using a binary vector containing a component of the coat protein gene from potato virus Y
(PVY) and a kanamycin-resistant selectable marker gene. The 54 transgenic lines were field-tested in single
plots of 10 plants, randomly interspersed with replicated plots of the non-transgenic control (cultivar Iwa). All
data points represent the mean of the 10 plants in each plot. The red arrowheads mark the point on the scale
for each yield parameter at which all lines below the arrowheads are significantly different from the control at
the 5% probability level as determined by Duncan’s multiple range test. Data points displayed in red represent
the six non-transgenic control plots (cultivar Iwa). Data points in green represent 32 transgenic Iwa lines, with
at least one of the three yield parameters significantly deviating from the control. Data points in blue represent
22 transgenic lines determined to be equivalent to the control for all three yield parameters. Lines indicated
with an asterisk exhibited an off-type appearance in foliage traits.

Bintje (39 lines) and Escort (22 lines), all constitutively expressing the coat protein of
PVX, with non-transgenic control cultivars. Each was evaluated for total yield and grading,
plus 50 different UPOV (Union pour la Protection des Obtentions V´eg´etales) morpholog-
ical traits used in official cultivar registration procedures. The frequency of ‘true-to-type’
transgenic lines was 18% for Bintje and 82% for Escort (Jongedijk et al., 1992). Other
studies have also reported the frequency of off-types among transgenic lines varying
between potato cultivars (Belknap et al., 1994; Davidson et al., 2002b; Heeres et al., 2002).
The elimination of transgenic lines with an off-type appearance is therefore one of the
main objectives of initial small-scale field trials with a new series of transgenic potato
lines. Some studies on transgenic potato lines have reported a good correlation of yield
attributes and phenotypic appearance between greenhouse and field conditions (e.g. Bones
et al., 1997). However, this association does not always hold. In our experience, transgenic
lines that exhibit off-type appearances in the greenhouse generally exhibit a more severe
off-type in the field. Furthermore, it has been commonly reported that transgenic lines that
appear ‘true-to-type’ under greenhouse conditions can show phenotypic deviations when
grown in the field (Conner et al., 1994; Davidson et al., 2002a,b; Heeres et al., 2002).
Because off-types cannot be reliably identified under laboratory or greenhouse conditions,
the critical importance of field-testing transgenic potato lines is further illustrated.

31.4 THE DESIGN OF A FIELD-TESTING PROGRAMME

When developing transgenic potatoes for cultivar improvement, the aim is to recover a
line with the desired expression of the transgene, while retaining the elite genetic attributes
of the parental clone. Clearly, these attributes must be maintained under field conditions.
Consequently, field-testing of transgenic potato lines is a highly important and critical
part of the research programme. Furthermore, such field-testing must be conducted at
an early stage in the programme to eliminate all the lines performing at a sub-optimal
level. Because research space and resources are usually finite, this allows efficient use of
resources.

In any new breeding cycle of a traditional potato breeding programme, field evaluation
begins with screening one to a few plants from many hundreds or thousands of progeny
lines (Plaisted et al., 1994). Many lines are discarded after one season and retained tubers

696

Conner

from a reduced number of selected lines used to establish replicated trials the next year.
As selection further reduces the number of lines over successive years, the plot size and
replication are increased, until a few highly promising lines are incorporated into regional
trials (Plaisted et al., 1994).

The strategy for field-testing transgenic potato lines is very similar. In the first year,
a well-designed field-testing programme will plant many transgenic lines in small plots,
followed by increasingly larger, replicated plots in subsequent years. For any combination
of potato cultivar with a specific vector or transgene, a large number of independently
derived transformed lines generated in the laboratory are established as single-field plots
in the first year. In our field-testing programme, we routinely establish single 3-m plots
of 10 plants for each transgenic line (e.g. Davidson et al., 2002b). For convenience,
plots are separated by 1-m gaps within rows, with rows a standard 0.75 m apart. Lines
derived from the same cultivar are always planted in a block of neighbouring plots,
with replicated non-transgenic plots of the parental cultivars positioned randomly among
the single plots of numerous independently derived transgenic clones. We generally
establish one non-transgenic control plot for every 5–10 plots of transgenic lines. In
this manner, any statistically significant variance components between plots of the same
cultivar can be determined. Our first-generation field tests are usually established from in
vitro micropropagated plants initially hardened-off under greenhouse, then screen-house,
conditions.

The field expression of the transgene and the phenotypic value of the conferred
transgenic trait as well as the appearance of deviant phenotypes can be readily determined
from such small-plot field tests. Consistent results among transgenic lines have been
reported over successive field seasons using this approach (Davidson et al., 2004; Douches
et al., 2004). Such initial field assessments could be determined with only 3–5 plant
plots; indeed, others have successfully conducted such trials with only three plants per
plot (Heeres et al., 2002). However, the key advantage of 10 plants per plot is that when
promising lines are identified, more tubers are harvested and are therefore available for
establishing large-scale replicated field trials in the subsequent season. This provides a
seed source in which tubers are treated in the same manner as commercial crops and
represents a more realistic cycle of storage and dormancy breaking for more advanced
field tests.

From these first-season field tests, selections are made of high-performing lines for
incorporation into larger-scale field trials with more rigorous experimental plot design
and statistical analysis. For the efficient use of resources, it is important to define how
many lines should be produced for initial field evaluation and how many plants per plot
are required to allow meaningful selection between the transgenic lines. The number
of required lines is controlled by two independent components: the frequency of lines
with the required transgene expression and the frequency of off-types. Another impor-
tant consideration is to determine whether the potato cultivar influences either of these
estimates.

In a thorough study by Heeres et al. (2002), field-testing was conducted on 995
transgenic lines from 14 potato cultivars that expressed an antisense granule-bound starch
synthase gene conferring amylose-free starch. After small-plot field tests assessing both
expression of the transgenic trait and true-to-type appearance, it was estimated that,

Field-testing of transgenic potatoes

697

depending on the cultivar, between 70 and 500 transgenic lines are required for initial
field tests to identify 10 transgenic lines in each cultivar worthy of subsequent scale-up
field tests (Heeres et al., 2002). Likewise, we have field-tested transgenic potato lines
expressing a cry1Ac9 gene determined to exhibit resistance to tuber moth and have a
normal phenotypic appearance under greenhouse conditions. Of 56 transgenic lines from
seven cultivars, only 13 lines from five of the cultivars were identified with sufficient
insect resistance as well as true-to-type appearance and yield to merit planting in the
following year (Davidson et al., 2002b).

Promising lines identified from the first-season field tests are established in replicated
plots the following season. We usually aim to evaluate up to 10 high-performing transgenic
lines and the non-transgenic control for each combination of cultivar and transgene or
vector. At this stage, we increase plot size to five rows of 10 plants, with plots replicated
three to four times (e.g. Davidson et al., 2006). Often, tubers harvested from the 10
plants of the previous season need to be divided to produce sufficient ‘seed tubers’,
especially when some tubers are sacrificed for analysis of the transgenic trait the previous
season. If necessary, it is also possible to establish field tests of this size using tissue
culture transplants. This experimental design permits more rigorous statistical analysis
of performance. For each replicated plot, we record performance measurements of the
transgenic phenotype and yield from only the three inner rows of each replicated plot.
In this manner, plants are evaluated when surrounded by other plants of the same line.
However, the tubers from all five rows are harvested to provide multiplied ‘seed tubers’
for further scale-up field trials of lines worthy of further evaluation. Transgenic lines
recorded as being equivalent to the parental cultivar in the single-plot field tests of
the previous season often exhibit slightly reduced yield in larger-scale field trials when
evaluated using more rigorous experimental plot design and statistical analysis (Moses
et al., 1993; Davidson et al., 2006).

31.5 STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY OF OFF-TYPES

It is clear from Section 31.3.2 that the appearance of off-types among populations of
independently derived transgenic lines is an inherent feature of potato genetic engi-
neering. In highly heterozygous clonal crops such as potato, the genetic integrity of
cultivars is instantly lost on self- or cross-pollination and sexual crossing. Therefore, in
most instances, transgenic potato cultivars will be clonally propagated from the primary
transformant arising in tissue culture through to commercial release (Section 31.2). Con-
sequently, the possibility of segregating the transgenic insertion event away from any
independently arising somaclonal event following sexual crosses is not appropriate. From
the perspective of potato improvement, any strategy to reduce the frequency of off-types
among primary transformants is important.

The extent and frequency of phenotypically variant plants from tissue culture varies
markedly under different culture conditions and is generally understood to increase when
the time to plant regeneration is longer (Cullis, 1983; Karp, 1991; Veilleux and Johnson,
1998). Efficient plant regeneration systems are therefore a key component of plant trans-
formation. During our first field tests in 1988, all the transgenic potato lines exhibited

698

Conner

deviant phenotypes for at least one morphological trait (Conner et al., 1994). In subse-
quent field tests, the frequency of true-to-type plants substantially increased following
improvements in our transformation protocol (Fig. 31.1). This emphasizes the importance
of initiating field-testing early in a research programme to ensure that the laboratory
protocols being employed are capable of producing true-to-type plants in the field.

When recovering any transgenic line in tissue culture, the first shoot to regenerate from
each transformation event is usually selected. This is based on a widely held premise
that the frequency of somaclonal variation increases with longer periods in cell culture
and the resulting assumption that the longer time a shoot takes to regenerate, the greater
chance that an ‘off-type’ will appear. However, an important experiment by Barrell (2002)
established that this assumption is not necessarily correct. Using our standard potato
transformation protocol, Barrell (2002) regenerated multiple shoots from a series of trans-
formation events and used Southern analysis to confirm that each of the multiple shoots
arose from a single transformed somatic potato cell. The analysis of phenotypic variation
in field tests demonstrated marked differences between these multiple regeneration events,
the origin of which must have occurred after T-DNA insertion and consequently during
the tissue culture phase. This result unequivocally demonstrates that somaclonal varia-
tion occurs during tissue culture and happens independent of transgene insertion. Most
importantly, the first shoots recovered did not necessarily exhibit less deviant phenotypes
(Fig. 31.2). Plants exhibiting a true-to-type appearance were occasionally derived from
later regeneration events. Therefore, one strategy to assist recovery of true-to-type plants
when developing transgenic potato lines is to regenerate and evaluate multiple shoots
from each transformation event.

Tissue culture is generally recognized as a stress environment (Madlung and Comai,
2004), and the extent and frequency of off-type plants arising from tissue culture increases
when stress is applied in cell culture (Cullis, 1983; Karp, 1991). Selectable marker genes
are routinely used during the recovery of transformed plants in tissue culture to facilitate

Fig. 31.2. An extreme example illustrating the value of evaluating multiple shoots regenerated from each potato
transformation event. Southern analysis established that both clones were derived from the same transformation
event. The poorly growing clone on the right was derived from the first regenerated shoot, whereas the clone
on the left was derived from a later regeneration event.

Field-testing of transgenic potatoes

the identification of rare transformation events among a large population of wild-type
cells. For potato transformation, kanamycin resistance is almost universally used (Conner
et al., 1997), although other possibilities are available (Barrell et al., 2002). Under such
selection systems, transformed cells are selected as the rare survivors among many dying
or dead cells. This can result in greater stress in the culture environment as a consequence
of the release of toxic metabolites and volatiles from the large population of dying wild-
type cells (Conner, 1986). It is therefore not surprising that the frequency of off-types in
field tests is greater among populations of transgenic potato plants than that among non-
transgenic plants regenerated without selection (Dale and McPartlan, 1992; Belknap et al.,
1994). A recent alternative approach for the recovery of transgenic potato lines, without
the use of selectable marker genes, involves the PCR screening of plants for the gene-
of-interest following regeneration from potato tissue co-cultivated with Agrobacterium
(de Vetten et al., 2003). It is to be expected that the recovery of transgenic lines in this
manner may substantially reduce the frequency of off-types during field tests of transgenic
potatoes.

31.6 ASSESSMENT OF BIOSAFETY ISSUES

The deployment of transgenic crops in global agriculture has raised a diverse range of
perceived environmental and food safety issues (Conner et al., 2003). Many of these
issues are relevant for the commercial release of transgenic potatoes (Conner, 1994) and
include

1. the incidence of transgenic volunteer or ground-keeper potatoes and their potential

invasiveness or weediness;

2. the incidence of pollen-mediated gene flow to other potatoes and related species;
3. the impact on non-target invertebrates and microflora, especially on species considered

beneficial;

4. the potential increased selection pressure on pest and disease populations to become

more virulent;

5. the evaluation of transgene expression products on food safety of the edible tubers; and
6. the impact on nutritional composition and concentration of natural toxins (e.g. gly-

coalkaloids).

Plants growing under field conditions are the most appropriate environment in which to
assess such biosafety issues. Consequently, initiating biosafety assessments in conjunction
with field tests of transgenic potatoes must be considered important. This represents an
opportunity to gather valuable data to help address issues of public concern over the
deployment of transgenic potatoes. For example, during some of the early field tests
on transgenic potatoes, data were recorded on the frequencies and distance of pollen-
mediated transgene dispersal (Tynan et al., 1990; McPartlan and Dale, 1994), as well
as nutritional composition and animal feeding studies (Monro et al., 1993). Examples
of various biosafety evaluations conducted on field-grown transgenic potatoes can be
for transgenic lines with herbicide (chlorsulfuron) resistance (Conner, 1995), antisense

700

Conner

granule-bound starch synthase gene conferring amylose-free starch (Heeres et al., 1995)
and cystatin expression for nematode resistance (Celis et al., 2004).

The large number of field tests on transgenic potatoes conducted around the globe
over the past 20 years (Section 31.1) provided an opportunity to repeatedly verify the
validity of the biosafety data over a wide range of environments and with a wide range
of potato cultivars. In some respects, this has been a wasted opportunity. In many cases,
a relevant set of data has not been recorded, or if it has, it has not been published or
made available to the wider scientific community. This would have greatly increased the
confidence in the conclusions made to date and facilitate future applications for field-
testing transgenic potatoes. A good example is pollen-mediated gene flow from field tests
of transgenic potato. Early studies established that the frequency of transgenic progeny
from non-transgenic potatoes growing in rows adjacent to transgenic potatoes ranges from
1 to 24% and rapidly falls to negligible within 3–5 m (Tynan et al., 1990; McPartlan
and Dale, 1994). Based on this and similar data, it was recommended that a distance of
20 m is generally adequate for containing novel gene constructs during initial field tests
of transgenic potato (Conner and Dale, 1996). If this data had been repeatedly verified in
many environments and for additional potato cultivars, some regulatory bodies may no
longer require the removal of flower buds during field tests of transgenic potato or set
more realistic isolation distances.

There has been a much greater emphasis on gaining knowledge on the impacts of
transgenic crops since the late 1990s. However, too many of these studies are still
performed under laboratory or greenhouse conditions, rather than under a more appro-
priate field environment. It is unfortunate that field tests on transgenic crops are often
limited by the containment controls imposed by regulatory authorities to manage the
perceived risks. The resulting field designs are not always conducive to critical experi-
mental evaluation of biosafety issues. This is ironic because the information that could be
obtained would be especially valuable to assist regulatory bodies to make better informed
decisions.

When conducting experiments to assess the ecological risk or food safety evaluation
of transgenic potatoes, it is critical to use appropriate controls (Conner et al., 2003). The
transgenic lines should be compared to the isogenic non-transgenic ‘parental’ cultivar.
Ideally, such transgenic lines should be selected from previous field trials and established
to be ‘true-to-type’ with the desired expression of the transgene. This allows unambiguous
assessment of the impact of the transgene during biosafety assessment, because the
comparison is between lines that differ only by the presence/absence of the transgene.
In highly heterozygous crops such as potato, transformation represents the only effective
way to produce such isogenic lines (Section 31.2).

It is also important that biosafety assessments include other non-transgenic potato
cultivars as additional controls to determine the relevance of any slight changes in
the performance of the transgenic line. For example, in conjunction with field tests
on transgenic potatoes secreting an antimicrobial peptide (magainin II) for improved
resistance to Erwinia carotovora isolates that incite soft rot diseases, we have investigated
the impacts of the transgenic plants on microbial communities on the root, tuber and
leaf surfaces and during decomposition of the plant material (O’Callaghan et al., 2004;
Conner and O’Callaghan, 2005). In all experiments, comparisons were made between

Field-testing of transgenic potatoes

701

transgenic line, the non-transgenic parental cultivar and another unrelated non-transgenic
cultivar. In some instances, minor differences were apparent between the transgenic lines
and the non-transgenic parent cultivar, but these were usually negligible relative to the
differences between the two non-transgenic cultivars. Similarly, when comparing the
compositional similarity of tubers from transgenic potato and the isogenic non-transgenic
parental cultivar, metabolomic profiling revealed subtle differences (Catchpole et al.,
2005). However, these were very minor relative to the large variation in metabolite profile
between conventional non-transgenic cultivars (Catchpole et al., 2005).

31.7 CONCLUSIONS

Transgenic potatoes have been widely field-tested around the world since 1986. Although
most of the activity initially occurred in North America and western Europe, since the turn
of the century this has become a global activity extending into many Asian, African, South
American and eastern European countries. In general terms, field-testing of transgenic
potatoes has three key components:

1. Verifying that the transgene confers the desired phenotype under field conditions;
2. Identifying transgenic lines that retain all the phenotypic traits, including yield and

quality attributes characteristic of the parental cultivar and

3. Initiating biosafety assessments on transgenic potatoes under realistic experimental

conditions.

When developing transgenic potatoes for cultivar improvement, the aim is to recover a
high-performing line with the desired expression of the transgene, while retaining all the
elite genetic attributes of the parental clone. From the perspective of potato improvement,
an important limitation is the frequency of off-types due to somaclonal variation arising
during the tissue culture phase of plant transformation. Consequently, field-testing must
be conducted at an early stage in the research programme to eliminate transgenic lines
performing at a sub-optimal level. The majority of these off-types can be easily eliminated
using single-field plots with up to 10 plants. A smaller number of high-performing lines
are subsequently established in larger-scale field trials with more rigorous experimental
plot design and statistical analysis. These latter field tests are the most appropriate stage
to initiate the assessment of biosafety issues.

32.1 INTRODUCTION

The use of soil-free techniques provides unique opportunities for producing seed potatoes
at enhanced rates in a controlled environment with no, or a highly reduced, incidence of
pests and diseases.

The most important applications of soil-free methodologies can be considered to be in
the commercial production of disease-free potato seed tubers. Potato is infected by more
than 30 viruses and virus-like agents. Being systemic pathogens, potato viruses are able
to disseminate through the tubers thus leading to substantial levels of crop degeneracy
with every increase in the number of crop cycles. Thus, the yield losses attributed to
virus infection are not only confined to a particular year but also accumulated with each
successive propagation cycle for as long as the infected tubers are used as seed. To check
this spread of viruses and other pathogens, most seed potato certification schemes in use
today are largely based on a uni-directional principle, whereby a certified nuclear stock
is used to initiate a seed multiplication scheme, and after many in vitro, semi-in vivo and
field multiplications, a much larger quantity of certified seed is subsequently generated for
further use. Enhanced propagation rates using fewer field generations reduce the seed’s
exposure to field-borne diseases, minimize the accumulation of tuber-borne diseases and,
additionally, facilitate the rapid introduction of new varieties enabling early initiative
market gains for the producer. Soil-free techniques play an increasingly important role in
these activities, and the critical in vitro and semi-in vivo phases almost invariably rely
on the use of one or more of the range of soil-free techniques that have been developed.
Historically, many of the techniques related to the production of high-quality planting
material have evolved concurrently with the increasing sophistication of the potato indus-
try and of scientific advances in related areas. Potato seed certification was initiated in
Europe in the early 1900s (Appel, 1934). In the USA, the National Plant Quarantine Act
was adopted in 1912, and the importance of disease resistance among potato varieties
was also recognized as a crucial factor towards improving crop productivity. The history
of seed potato certification has been extensively reviewed (Shepard and Claflin, 1975).
It was demonstrated that virus diseases could be transmitted from plant to plant, and the
crucial role of aphids in transmitting plant viruses was further established (Schultz and
Folsom, 1923). In 1926, the transmission of spindle tuber viroid was demonstrated (Goss,

1926). In the 1920s, the first greenhouse indexing services were set up, to assist growers
in isolating disease-infected seed sources, and this was a significant step in improving
seed quality because of the subsequent reduction in mosaic virus disease and potato bac-
terial ring rot. The first truly ‘virus-free’ potato programmes were developed in Scotland
and the Netherlands in the 1950s.

Meristem tip culture (first reported by Morel and Martin, 1955) is a fundamental tool
in the production of virus-free potatoes. An apical meristem, together with one to three
adjacent leaf primordia measuring 0.1–0.5 mm, can be referred to as a meristem tip. The
typical meristem dome is generally free of viruses or, in some cases, may carry a very
low concentration of the viruses. Although not proven unequivocally, this concept arises
from several different hypotheses, including that the mitotic chromosome replication and
high-auxin content found in the meristem interfere with viral nucleic acid metabolism
and, thus, are inhibitory to virus multiplication. Possibly, as compared with other regions
in the plant, the apical region possess more active virus-inactivating systems, and a further
hypothesis is to suggest that although virus particles proliferate through the plant vascular
system, the meristem, being a zone of actively dividing cells, is devoid of vascular system.
In the production of virus-free material, the meristem tip from the infected plants is excised
aseptically and cultured on a defined media to obtain virus-free mericlones. Although the
process is principally used for virus elimination, it often also has the additional benefits
of the simultaneous elimination of other pathogens such as mycoplasmas, bacteria and
fungi (http://cropandsoil.oregonstate.edu/fpsp/psf5.htm). Viruses can also be inactivated
C(cid:3)
by thermotherapy, a process of growing the plants at higher temperatures (cid:2)35–37
for a period of up to 4–6 weeks. The process of thermotherapy disrupts the production
and activity of virus-encoded movement proteins and coat proteins, thus restricting their
movement through plasmodesmata and the plant vascular system, and their reconstitution
from replicated viral nucleic acids, respectively. In potato, the apical meristems are often
free of viruses, but some viruses actually invade the meristematic region of the growing
tips. Moreover, potato virus S (PVS) and potato virus X are difficult to eliminate by
thermotherapy or meristem-tip culture alone. In these cases, it has been possible to obtain
virus-free plants by combining meristem-tip culture with thermotherapy. Additionally,
chemotherapy, i.e. the treatment of plants with anti-viral chemicals such as ribavirin or
acyclovir, has also been used to eliminate viruses, either alone or in combination with
meristem culture and/or heat treatment (Sanchez et al., 1991).

(cid:2)

The virus-indexed and pathogen-free mericlones are subjected to a rapid tissue culture
plant propagation method to generate abundant clean (pathogen-free) cultures. Several
facets of the generic science of plant tissue culture have both current and potential future
applications. These include micropropagation, i.e. clonal propagation through axillary
shoot proliferation using explants (isolated plant tissues, e.g. leaf sections or stem intern-
odes used in in vitro culture) containing pre-existing meristems, de novo shoot production
following the induction of adventitious meristems by the application of plant growth
regulators and somatic embryogenesis, which is the process of embryo initiation and
development from vegetative or non-gametic cells. All these processes hold significant
applications in potato biotechnology. The widespread introduction of plant tissue culture
to seed potato production during the 1970s enabled the rapid multiplication of disease-
free seed material and resulted in more productive seed stock. Micropropagation now

underpins many seed potato production systems and specifically provides the nuclear
stock material, in the form of microplants (plants derived through in vitro axillary bud
proliferation) or micro-tubers (in vitro produced tubers) for their subsequent use in a
chain of potato seed production programmes. The microplants and/or micro-tubers are
specifically used to increase the number of first-year clones. These can be either planted
directly in the field or more preferably used as the planting stock for the production of
pre-basic seed comprising small seed potato tubers (mini-tubers). For producing mini-
tubers, the in vitro propagated propagules are planted at a high density, and the production
can be carried out all year round in a glasshouse environment. Although micro-tubers
were first described in the mid-1950s (Barker, 1953; Mes and Menge, 1954), they have
generally been under-utilized as a propagule, mainly due to physiological constraints, but
offer a fascinating and highly informative system for a number of basic studies on tuber
formation. Micro-tubers are resting structures, and their packaging requires much less
space when compared with microplants. They can be conveniently used for long-distance
shipments without any need for specialist light conditions, growth medium and immedi-
ate/intermittent subculturings. These features are useful in meeting quarantine restrictions
from different countries and thus make micro-tubers a favourable option for international
germplasm exchange.

The term hydroponics is used to describe many different types of system for growing
plants without soil but is far from being a new concept. It has been suggested that the
hanging gardens of Babylon and the floating gardens of the Aztecs of Mexico were
early examples of ‘Hydroponic’ culture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponic). The
scientific principles of hydroponics were established in the 1930s, when researchers of
plant metabolism discovered that plants absorbed nutrients as simple ions in water. The
definition of hydroponics has been extended to include the use of an inert medium, such
as gravel, sand, peat, vermiculite, perlite, rock wool or sawdust, to which is added a
nutrient solution, containing all the essential elements needed by the plant for its normal
growth and development. The productivity of these technologies can be greatly advanced
by increasingly sophisticated methods that have been developed for the accurate control
of both the gaseous atmosphere and the light intensity in enclosed hydroponic systems to
ensure optimal production. Due to the very high density of planting, increased yields per
unit area can be obtained, and pest and disease measures tightly controlled. Additionally,
the previous limitations of seasonality no longer become a problem, as production can
be maintained all year round. The use of a continuous flowing nutrient film technique
was demonstrated for actual tuber production with acceptable yields in studies at NASA
(Wheeler et al., 1990) as part of the Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems (CELSS)
studies.

Aeroponics is a variation (generally attributed to work by NASA in the 1960s and
1970s, where research was undertaken on food production in low-gravity situations) on
the fundamental hydroponic technique that has been enhanced by the use of nebulizers,
foggers or other devices to create a fine mist of solution to enable nutrient delivery to
plant roots. In many systems, the plant roots are suspended above a reservoir of nutrient
solution or inside a channel connected to a reservoir. Nutrient solution is delivered to the
roots through sprayer nozzles, which then drips or drains back into the reservoir. It is
generally considered that such systems have advantages due to the increased aeration of

708

Millam and Sharma

nutrient solution and its consequent effect on increased oxygen availability to plant roots,
stimulating growth and preventing algae formation.

It will be apparent that many of the above techniques are closely inter-related, and in
many cases complementary. Technical developments are constantly being evolved and
introduced into commercial seed production programmes worldwide. With the increasing
emphasis on energy conservation, the need to reduce production costs per unit area and to
maintain output quality, the techniques of soil-free culture of potato are likely to increase
in importance.

32.2 MINI-TUBER PRODUCTION

Although the definition given above that mini-tubers are small seed potato tubers that
can be produced year round in glasshouses from in vitro propagated plantlets planted at
a high density is fundamentally correct, a more modern definition would include that the
propagule itself would be grown in a soil-free medium, within a facility for which there
are appropriate procedures and physical barriers to prevent the entry of plant pathogens
and insects. This technology package is a fundamental component of many seed potato
production companies.

The basis of mini-tuber production is to rapidly facilitate the stage between the delivery
of virus-free material derived from meristem culture nuclear stock and the production
of tubers destined for field planting. Although schemes can vary between countries and
markets, the format remains constant. The basic starting point is the nuclear stock that
comprises in vitro pathogen-tested microplants to ensure that the starting material is
pathogen-free, according to a programme of official testing for indigenous and non-native
pathogens. Microplants or micro-tubers derived from the nuclear stock can then be grown
in a pathogen-free medium to produce mini-tubers or, less commonly, can be grown in
the field to produce tubers under protected environments. Production rates vary between
systems and the method of harvesting. Some commercial companies quote rates of up to
1000 mini-tubers per square metre with tuber weight ranging from 1 to 5 g following a
non-destructive harvesting every 40–50 days from a crop derived from a single microplant
under optimum glasshouse conditions (http://www.quantumtubers.com/techinfo.htm).

The effectiveness of using mini-tubers for the selection of agronomic characters was
reported by Gopal et al. (2002), suggesting that the selection for tuber yield can be prac-
tised at the mini-tuber crop level in potato-breeding programmes. The effectiveness of an
early stage selection for quality traits in the potato-breeding population was also demon-
strated by the selection for low-glucose content in mini-tubers by Xiong et al. (2002).

In a theme that will recur throughout this chapter, the production of mini-tubers under
low-gravity situations has also been the subject of considerable interest. Kordyum et al.
(1997) first reported the cultivation of microplants grown for 8 days on board the ‘Mir’
orbital space station. Spherical mini-tubers were formed with no statistically significant
differences in either the frequency of tuber formation or the tuber size during this period
under space flight and stationary conditions. The authors reported, however, that the grain
size of starch was decreased and lamellae within the amyloplasts were locally enlarged.

Soil-free techniques

709

In summary, although many mini-tuber production systems exist, they are all based on
the rapid propagation of nuclear stock microplants in vitro, described below in Section
32.3.1, and the subsequent planting out, often in enhanced environmental conditions
(including hydroponic or derived technologies) for the rapid production of mini-tubers,
which are generally used as the starting point for a field multiplication system.

32.3 IN VITRO MULTIPLICATION TECHNIQUES

32.3.1 Axillary-bud proliferation

Micropropagation is the rapid vegetative propagation of plants under in vitro conditions
of high light intensity, controlled temperature and a defined nutrient medium. The tech-
nique has been applied to a substantial number of commercial vegetatively propagated
plant species. The cost and efficiency of production are the key issues in the commercial
micropropagation of potato, and different modes adopted for potato micropropagation
have different implications over these issues. In vitro propagation of potato by the serial
culture of single-node cuttings (containing axillary buds) has been widely used in the
rapid multiplication of disease-free material in elite seed potato programmes (Goodwin
et al., 1980). The in vitro produced microplants are uniform, true-to-parent type and reli-
able propagules of choice. They are extensively used by the industry for the production
of mini-tubers, almost exclusively in greenhouses, although direct planting into the field
can also be employed. In many situations, a relatively low-technology facility can be
assembled and utilized – costs can be cut by using generic systems such as supermar-
ket shelving for lighting racks, the use of household sugar rather than laboratory-grade
sucrose, replacing distilled water by de-mineralized water and the use of inexpensive
food containers as culture vessels. These, although not technically sterile, are produced as
food quality items and can reduce operational costs considerably. However, an area that
requires careful attention is the matrix used for culture, which, when expensive laboratory-
grade agar is used, accounts for more than 75% of the total media cost. Regarding the
use of less-expensive agar alternatives, one report cited the use of sago, a processed
(gelatinized) edible starch, as a replacement for agar in potato in vitro systems (Naik
and Sarkar, 2001), but the economics of this approach need to be determined. Another
critical factor is the need for some form of aeration for the growing cultures. The use of
cheaper food-grade vessels does not allow proper aeration, so a form of ‘venting’ using
micropore-tape may be needed. Several commercial micropropagation companies have
devised ingenious systems for carbon dioxide enrichment of the in vitro culture vessels.
Additionally, there are low-cost lighting systems on the market. A recent technical report
on manipulation of the culture environment on in vitro air movement and its impact on the
process of photosynthesis carried out by potato plantlets (Kitaya et al., 2005) described
how enhancement of the air movement in the culture vessel promoted photosynthesis of
the in vitro plantlets. Photoautotrophic micropropagation using sugar-free medium is an
area of potential utility to scale-up potato micropropagation for commercialization, and
recent advancements in the development and utilization of large culture vessels and case
studies concerning photoautotrophic micropropagation were described by Zobayed et al.

710

Millam and Sharma

(2004). Manual handling is a major requirement for all conventional micropropagation
systems, and it has been estimated that labour costs may represent 65–85% of the total
costs; consequently, it has been proposed that the introduction of methods for the automa-
tion of specific stages in the whole micropropagation process may assist in reducing total
operating costs (Kondo and Ting, 1998). One specific area that may in the future lead to
a reduction in the total number of handling steps is the use of aeroponic or bioreactor sys-
tems. The use of temporary immersion techniques to enhance production in vitro has been
the subject of recent interest and was first reported in potato by Teisson and Alvard (1999)
and further advanced by Piao et al. (2003). This methodology has seen widespread uptake
in many other species, and this may be an area for further study and refinement in potato.
Microplants, however, tend to be non-functional in terms of normal physiological
processes. Certainly, microplants have malfunctioning photosynthetic apparatus, reduced
epidermal wax, are fragile and photoheterotrophic in nature and lack completely functional
roots. To overcome these limitations, the weaning of plantlets under an intermediary ex
vitro hardening phase involving conditions of high humidity and reduced light intensity,
until the emergence of true and photosynthetically active leaves, is critical to the success
of this stage. This hardening phase of microplants requires careful execution to minimize
or eliminate losses at this crucial stage of micropropagation. The maintenance of the
high health status of the material is paramount, and the microplants are vulnerable at this
stage. The use of sterilized media, or non–soil-based substrates, greatly facilitates the
avoidance of subsequent pathogen problems. The careful design of the facilities used for
these procedures is important, and attention is needed to assure aseptic conditions as far
as possible. Many production facilities use protective clothing, filtered air and detailed
hygiene procedures, as clearly any contamination at this stage would prove to be costly
for the company in terms of loss, or the disruption of production.

32.3.2 Micro-tuber production

Micro-tubers are miniature tubers and differ from mini-tubers in that they are produced
under aseptic conditions designed to simulate the normal conditions of tuber-induction
in vitro. The subject was previously extensively reviewed by Donnelly et al. (2003).
Although there is some uncertainty regarding the uptake and utility of micro-tubers for any
reliable evaluation of agronomic characters, the application of micro-tubers in the area of
germplasm conservation is widely accepted, and, as a research tool, this biological system
has many further applications (Coleman et al., 2001). A recent example was the use of an
in vitro micro-tuber system as an important component of a virus-induced gene-silencing
method in potato (Faivre-Rampant et al., 2004). Micro-tubers may be utilized commer-
cially for mini-tuber production in greenhouses or screenhouses and, less commonly, can
be directly field planted. One problem with the wider commercial uptake of micro-tubers
is the requirement for a minimum fresh weight of 0.50 g to enable the tuber to perform
adequately. Although most protocols fail to generate micro-tubers that meet this criteria,
several reports do state that micro-tubers of 0.5–1.0 g can be consistently generated (Akita
and Takayama, 1994; Leclerc et al., 1994). Large micro-tubers are generally easier to
handle, are less subject to excessive shrinkage and degeneration in cold storage, also have
a shorter dormancy period and exhibit greater survival rates when planted out directly

Soil-free techniques

in the field (Leclerc et al., 1994). Most commonly used micro-tuber production systems
are based on the use of single-node cultures, from which generally one tuber per node is
obtained. However, larger micro-tubers can be obtained by culturing whole plantlets or
cuttings composed of several nodes on a semi-solid medium, but this takes more resources
in terms of cultured plant tissues, media and glassware. It has been shown that larger
micro-tubers can be produced by growing potato plantlets in liquid culture (Leclerc et al.,
1994). However, as compared with their aerial counterparts, the micro-tubers remaining
submerged in liquid cultures are considered to store poorly and tend to be very soft, with
open lenticels that become the site of entry for pathogenic microorganisms.

The biological basis for the induction of micro-tuberization in potato is strongly related
to the artificial simulation of the natural tuber-inducing conditions found in the field. Fac-
tors employed in an in vitro system in many cases include a high sucrose and cytokinin
supply in the medium, the provision of short days (or complete darkness), lower tempera-
tures or the application of anti-gibberellins such as chlorocholine chloride (CCC). The spe-
cific carbon source and its concentration within the tissue culture medium have great sig-
nificance, with sucrose being the favoured substrate, largely because of its translocation to
the developing micro-tubers (Khuri and Moorby, 1995). The optimum sucrose concentra-
tion for micro-tuber production ranges from 60 to 80 g/l, which is up to three to four times
the normal amount used for micropropagation. It has been suggested that sucrose plays a
dual role in micro-tuber development by providing a favourable osmolarity for tuber devel-
opment in addition to its role as a carbon source (Khuri and Moorby, 1995). Jasmonate is
a growth regulator normally produced by plants that have been exposed to stress and has
previously been found to be highly effective in the induction of micro-tubers (Koda et al.,
1991; Van den Berg and Ewing, 1991). However, although the use of jasmonate has been
widely advocated, the response was shown to vary with cultivar (Pruski et al., 2003).

The process of micro-tuberization can be adapted to a culture production system within
bioreactors (Yu et al., 2000), and methods for the automation of the technology have
been further described (http://www.osmotek.com/PotatoProtocol.html). Also, there have
been proposals to adapt micro-tuber technology to some form of large-scale mechanized
planting process (Ranalli et al., 1994; Struik and Lommen, 1999). The growth and the
yield of potato plants grown from micro-tubers in field trials has been investigated
(Kawakami et al., 2003), and it was found that the micro-tuber-derived plants had a lower
initial increase in root and leaf area index than conventional seed tuber plants. The first
tuber formation in micro-tuber plants was about 7 days later than in conventional seed
tuber plants, and tuber bulking occurred about 14 days later in micro-tuber plants. At
harvest, the tuber fresh weight of micro-tuber plants was 82% that of conventional tuber
plants, suggesting the potential for using micro-tubers for direct field planting, although
with certain limitations.

Micro-tubers are also convenient for handling, storage and transport of germ plasm
(Estrada et al., 1986) and in comparison with in vitro plantlets do not need a hardening
period in the greenhouse or field (Ranalli, 1997; Coleman et al., 2001). However, a
major constraint to the wider uptake of micro-tubers is that micro-tubers, after in vitro
tuberization, are generally very dormant (Tabori et al., 1999) and will not sprout unless
stored for 4 months or more at low temperatures.

Millam and Sharma

As previously stated, micro-tubers have great utility as an experimental tool for research
studies, reviewed by Coleman et al. (2001). These applications have been extended to
several biochemical studies on the temperature effects on starches (Debon et al., 1998;
Tester et al., 2004). There are obvious constraints to the widespread uptake of micro-
tubers as a commercial tool, but significant research is ongoing on the optimization of
systems and future applications.

32.3.3 Somatic embryogenesis

A potentially novel method of producing high-quality potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)
nuclear seeds is through the process of somatic embryogenesis. Somatic embryo formation
has been successfully reported in many plant species, but in potato, reliable systems
were, until recently, only reported at the experimental stage (De Garcia and Martinez,
1995). The process of somatic embryogenesis can be defined as the development of a
bipolar structure, with both root and shoot poles, from any sporophytic part of the plant
occurring, through the same key stages of embryo development as zygotic embryogenesis
(i.e. globular, heart and torpedo stages). This is yet another example of the potential of
totipotency that can be exhibited by plant cells, whereby the cells first de-differentiate
and then re-determine towards the embryogenic pathway. Recent reports (Seabrook and
Douglass, 2001; Sharma and Millam, 2004) offer the prospect of developing and utilizing
an efficient somatic embryogenesis system in potato. In the somatic embryogenesis system
demonstrated by these authors, the in vitro potato internodal segments were subjected to a
three-stage culturing regime of shoot multiplication, induction of somatic embryogenesis
and regeneration/expression of somatic embryos using modified culture media. Somatic
embryos were visible within 3 weeks of explant transfer to auxin-free medium, after an
initial incubation for 2 weeks on medium containing auxin (alone or in combination with
a cytokinin). The characteristic developmental stages observed during potato somatic
embryogenesis were unequivocally confirmed using histology, and the development of
somatic embryos was suggested to be through a unicellular mode of origin (Sharma and
Millam, 2004). The transfer of potato somatic embryos to a plant growth regulator-free
medium resulted in the observation of growth patterns similar to those expected from
potato seedlings, in contrast with those observed for in vitro propagated shoots. The
successful transplantation of emblings (plantlets derived from somatic embryos, a term
similar to seedlings for zygotic embryos) to glasshouse conditions resulted in good quality
potato plants and tubers with normal morphology (Fig. 32.1).

The somatic embryogenesis system in potato offers a potentially novel method for pro-
ducing nuclear seed material, the propagation of transgenic plants through a unicellular
mode and also as a novel biological system for many studies on gene expression and
regulation. As a comparison of the potential of this mode of propagation versus other
methods previously discussed (Sections 32.3.1 and 32.3.2), micro-tubers, theoretically,
can be produced throughout the year in the controlled and non-seasonal environment of a
laboratory, but the dormancy problems of micro-tubers and their physiological age limit
their continual production and utilization. Practically, micro-tubers are produced in such
a way that their dormancy period coincides with, or ends just before, the normal crop sea-
son. Microplants are free of such dormancy and of physiological age-related constraints,

but are fragile, and existing production methods are labour-intensive and need substantial
in vitro and ex vitro storage space for bulking-up. Additionally, upon prolonged storage,
the plants become tall, thin and etiolated which adversely affects transplantation success
rates. However, somatic embryos have the significant advantages that they are also free
from dormancy and physiological constraints and require substantially less manual labour
input and specialized storage space; dormancy can be induced and released at will (under
optimized systems) aiding the bulking and harvesting of embryos in a programmed man-
ner. Additionally, somatic embryos could be encapsulated as synthetic seeds thus greatly,
and advantageously, facilitating their handling, storage and transportation. Thus, somatic
embryos combine many of the distinct advantages of microplants, micro-tubers and seed
propagation systems. However, they do require a hardening phase before transplantation,

714

and, for the initial post-hardening period, growth is uneven and less vigorous when com-
pared with micro-tuber- and microplant-derived plants. At the time of maturity, these
differences tend to disappear, and all the three described systems of micropropagation are
generally comparable in terms of overall and individual mini-tuber yield.

32.4 HYDROPONICS AND AEROPONICS

These techniques offer many interesting opportunities for developing enhanced production
systems, mainly for mini-tubers. Although requiring a degree of technical sophistication
to design, establish and run, the benefits offered are sufficient for such systems to have
been widely adopted by seed production companies worldwide.

One aspect of both types of systems is the potential to continually harvest tubers of
the required size. However, both types of system operate in high-humidity conditions,
and problems associated with open lenticels such as increased penetration of pathogens
may need special attention and additional costs. Specific details of production rates have
been cited in a number of papers, from a range of modifications of the basic protocols.
Two contrasting culture systems for propagating first-generation potatoes were compared
by Muro et al. (1997), a conventional system using a peat/sand mixture with mineral
fertilizer and a hydroponic culture method using perlite as the matrix and nutrient solution.
The authors stated that the total production and number of tubers produced through the
hydroponic system were significantly higher than using the conventional system. It was
further reported that the tuber yields from in vitro plants and mini-tubers were variable
depending upon the time of year. Interestingly, it was shown that during the autumn/winter
cycle, yield from mini-tubers was approximately double that from in vitro plants, whereas
the reverse was reported during the spring/summer cycle. The work was extended to
assess the effects of four hydroponic test cultures to study the influence of seed density,
and although the number of tubers obtained increased significantly with seed density,
there was no concurrent decrease in the number of large-diameter tubers. A soil-less
production technique using clay balls as a substrate has been previously reported (Rolot
and Seutin, 1999), and the system further employed a recycled and disinfected nutritive
solution as the source of nutrients but was set up using micro-tubers as an in vitro starting
material. Results varied according to cultivar but were reported to be in the magnitude
of 1:8–1:13, giving 470–760 mini-tubers per square metre instead of a multiplication
rate of 4–8 as observed in the conventionally grown controls (230–470 mini-tubers per
square metre).

It has been claimed by many companies that an aeroponic-based multiplication system
(see Section 32.2) has the potential to eliminate all but one generation of seed potato
multiplication in the field, thus, lowering costs and raising the plant health quality of
the first field-generation clones, although these claims have not been published in detail.
Clearly, however, there are several obvious advantages of applying the aeroponic culture
system, mainly for the avoidance of soil pathogens or contaminants, but importantly
by increasing the availability of water and minerals in the root zone, and optimizing
aeration around roots. Returning to the theme of generating plant material in low-gravity
situations, it was shown that plant-derived nutrients could be successfully recycled in

Soil-free techniques

a presumably closed-cycle CELSS set up using biological methods (Mackowiak et al.,
1997). The majority of the essential nutrients were recovered by microbiologically treating
the plant biomass in an aerobic bioreactor. Effluent containing the nutrients was then
returned to the biomass production component through a recirculating hydroponic system.
All nutrient solutions were continually recirculated during the entire 418-day study. In
general, tuber yields with reclaimed minerals were within 10% of control solutions.

A direct comparison of the hydroponic and aeroponic systems for the production of
mini-tubers in greenhouse beds was made by Ritter et al. (2001). It was demonstrated that
plants raised in the aeroponic system showed increased vegetative growth, delayed tuber
formation and an extended vegetative cycle of about 7 months after transplanting. Their
study further reported the accomplishment of two production cycles using the hydroponic
system as compared with only one with the aeroponic system in a definite time span. Sig-
nificantly, however, compared with the total production in hydroponics, the per plant tuber
yield and number in the aeroponic system were almost 70% and 2.5-fold higher, respec-
tively. Thus, the aeroponic system provides a higher overall tuber yield and increased
efficiency per cropping cycle. This positively compensates for the loss of one crop cycle,
which in itself means reduced resource inputs while at the same time maintaining a higher
output. However, the mean tuber weight from tubers produced in the aeroponic system
was reported to be reduced by 33%. Further advantages and possible problems with the
aeroponic system for mini-tuber production were also discussed in this report, and there
has been substantial, but largely unpublished, commercial research activity in this area.

32.5 FUTURE PROSPECTS

The development of methods for the soil-free production of potato has a long and
interesting history. The technological developments described have enabled an increase
in mini-tuber production, with substantial effects on reducing the cycle of seed tuber
production and increasing seed quality while reducing the incidence of disease. Clearly,
in terms of the need for a greater efficiency of seed potato production and for a reduced
energy input, research into soil-free techniques will continue to be the subject of focus
in both established and developing potato-producing areas, in the near and distant future.
Advances in engineering technology will also assist in the development of more automated
and controlled seed propagation systems. However, there are also options for simplifying
the seed potato production systems for adaptation to low-technology situations, which
has greater scope and relevance towards the increasing trends of potato production in
developing countries.

33.1 INTRODUCTION

Production of potatoes for the demanding markets of developed countries in the twenty-
first century increasingly requires growers to revise agronomic practices frequently to
provide potatoes of suitable specification at low cost. The trend towards larger growers
and producer groups in many countries (e.g. British Potato Council, 2006) has aided rapid
adoption of new techniques, but traditional husbandry remains important and policies
that provide short-term gains can place sustainable future production at risk. The value
of potato crops has become more dependent on meeting quality requirements than on
the total yield, and many practices are adopted or revised in an attempt to achieve these
requirements. The diverse markets for which crops are grown often have contrasting
requirements, so that all aspects of crop production must be tailored to the particular
market, and this may require individual growers to specialize in production for a single
market to remain profitable. Potato production has often been highly profitable, albeit
subject to variable yields and crop prices year to year, and high input costs have been
accepted, but currently, economic and environmental pressures require the use of all inputs
to be constantly reviewed. The information that growers need to make rational decisions
in relation to many of their production practices is not always known or available, and
although crop growth models and decision support systems (DSS) offer opportunities
to aid in this, the trend to turn the research focus away from experimental data and
towards simulation is not entirely wise. It presents growers with a challenging future
for they increasingly require accurate knowledge of the major individual disciplines that
contribute to the agronomic management of the potato crop, and this demands improved
understanding of growth and development.

33.2 PLANNING AND PREPARATION

Many of the opportunities to influence a potato crop occur prior to planting as there
is limited opportunity during growth to influence key crop parameters; so, effective
planning is vital to ensure that these are not compromised. Inputs and interventions to the
growing crop then enable the potential of the planned crop to be achieved. In practice,
planning individual crops is usually not made in isolation but as part of a target production

comprising many crops, and this increases the complexity of the task. The scope of crop
planning is considerable as it includes everything from choice of variety and procurement
of seed through site selection, nutrient requirements and establishing a sequence of
operations from soil preparation until the end of crop storage.

33.2.1 Market

The choice of market for a potato crop determines the varieties that are suitable, quality
traits that affect crop value and other related aspects of planning. The main markets
(Chapter 1, McGregor, this volume) for processed products, fresh potatoes, seed and starch
have very different requirements, and within these sectors, distinct crops with particular
specifications exist. Although some varieties can be used for both fresh and processed
products, the more sophisticated markets often dictate a narrow choice of suitable varieties,
so that traits of disease and drought resistance are generally secondary. Varieties are
chosen also on the basis of their suitability for processing or marketing immediately
following harvest or after various periods of storage, this being a particularly important
consideration for chip (French fry) and crisp production. Size specifications of particular
products for fresh market production are an important influence on variety choice with
premium markets for both very large and very small tubers. Newly bred varieties generally
account for a small proportion of the planted area, and several widely grown varieties were
bred more than 40 years ago (Russet Burbank was introduced before 1890) (Table 33.1).

Market choice may dictate site selection, the requirement to control particular diseases
and the calendar of crop production. Sites where irrigation is available may be essential
for certain markets, and soils differ in suitability for particular crops as, for example skin
appearance is adversely affected at harvest by abrasive soils. Soil type also affects the
period over which crops may be grown as sands and light soils remain workable in wetter
conditions than heavier soils; so, clay soils may be unsuitable for early-spring production
or for crops destined for late harvest dates in wet climates. Rigorous control of seed-borne
diseases is often required for production of seed crops to meet certification standards and
also for fresh market crops where infection detracts from the appearance and thus from
crop value. Control of diseases and disorders causing internal discolouration is particularly
important for some processed products. The high value of fresh crops for some premium
markets (e.g. salad and baking potatoes) can justify the cost of practices and inputs of
agrochemicals and irrigation that are not economically viable for other crops.

The tonnage of crop to be produced affects other important planning considerations,
and estimating this may require a combination of historical data and predictions based
on a range of factors influencing yield. Significant over-production may be unprofitable
if product cannot be sold to the target market, whereas under-production can lead to
contractual and other problems.

33.2.2 Calendar

In some locations, potato crops can be planted and harvested at almost any time of year,
but for most parts of the world, there are climatic limitations mainly associated with frost
damage or heat stress, but excessive or inadequate seasonal rainfall may also be important
in affecting crop growth directly and in limiting opportunities to prepare seedbeds or to
harvest. Although the interval from emergence to tuber initiation in some varieties may be
slightly less in short days than in long days (e.g. 12 versus 16 h, Demagante and Van der
Zaag, 1988a) at high temperatures, the effect of photoperiod on tuber initiation in field-
grown potatoes is generally limited (O’Brien et al., 1998), and daylength per se is not an
important constraint to potato production in most of the areas where the crop is produced.
Successful potato production can be carried out in latitudes above 60
N in Europe and
North America (e.g. De Temmerman et al., 2002; Walworth and Carling, 2002) and 45
S
(cid:2)
but also <15
N and S in Africa, South America and Asia (e.g. Hay and Allen, 1978;
Midmore, 1988; Demagante and Van der Zaag 1988b; Ifenkwe and Odurukwe, 1990). As
these environments have major differences in almost all aspects of climate, pathology and
infrastructure, a great range of agronomic practices have been adopted to accommodate
these. Potential and actual yields differ considerably, but commercial varieties of Solanum
tuberosum show remarkable adaptability.

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

In practice, limitation to the window for growing the crop may result from the require-
ment to plant and then to harvest a large area of crop with the same machinery or labour.
Full season crops of some varieties have the potential to grow far longer than many
climates allow, so that even crops planted in early spring can retain near complete crop
cover up to normal harvest dates in the autumn (>180 days after planting) when grown in
fertile conditions (Fig. 33.1). Although such long-season crops maximize the opportunity
to grow the largest crop biomass, in practice, many crops are grown for shorter periods,

and very profitable crops of small potatoes can be harvested within 60 days of plant-
ing. Cropping plans for a single market may consist of a sequence of plantings suitable
for sequential harvesting or combinations of plantings and varieties differing in growth
pattern to provide a staggered harvest. Particularly early or late season availability often
attracts premium prices, and such crops often require special husbandry. Crops destined
for use without storage require production cycles appropriate to achieve market criteria
by the planned harvest date, whereas crops destined for storage are best grown, so that
the period of growth, skin set and date of harvest do not compromise crop quality at the
intended date of use. Sophisticated production systems can be integrated in such a way
that seed and ware production cycles are matched, so that seed of the most appropriate
physiological state is used for ware production.

33.2.3 Seed

Seed is one of the most expensive and important inputs, and effective planning should
make best use of seed by accurately establishing the quantity required and ensuring it is
suitable for the intended crop. Although seed certification standards in many countries may
simply restrict marketing of seed affected by diseases only to the extent that substantial
yield loss does not occur, procurement of seed with lower disease thresholds may be
justified for premium markets. Some blemishing diseases (e.g. silver scurf) are ignored
for seed certification purposes, and for other diseases (e.g. black scurf), tolerances may
allow up to a quarter of the surface area of tubers to be affected (Great Britain, 2006),
although the incidence of less severe infection on seed may provide sufficient inoculum
for blemishing diseases to affect the value of the ware. An increasing range of diagnostic
tests (Barker et al., 2005) can provide data on the incidence and severity of infection by
bacteria, fungi and viruses to guide the choice of seed.

33.2.3.1 Seed rate

The quantity of seed required varies considerably according to different markets, expected
yields and seed size (mean weight) with a range from <1 to >6 t/ha being used. Although

seed requirements are generally expressed as ‘seed rate’ (tons of seed per hectares planted),
the effective unit of density for the potato crop is the stem (Holliday, 1960; Bleasdale,
1965). Each seed tuber may produce from one to eight or more stems depending on the
variety, the weight and physiological state of the tuber. The number of stems produced
tends to increase with increase in seed weight but smaller seed produces more stems per
unit weight than large seed, so that a lower seed rate of small seed is required to achieve
a given stem population. In some countries, most seed is used whole, but in others, seed
tubers may be cut into two or more pieces prior to planting, and this generally results in
a greater stem population than from planting whole seed at the same rate. A very wide
range of seed tuber size, from <20 to >120 g, is used, but grading by size or weight into
several divisions is recommended to reduce the variation in stem production within lots
that would otherwise result. The mean tuber weight or tuber count (i.e. number of tubers
per 50 kg) of seed lots may vary considerably, especially if they are divided into few
size classes, and because seed weight is an important determinant of the stem population
likely to be produced, a wide range of values compromises accurate determination of
seed requirements.

Very low stem populations result in low yield as ground cover is slow to develop
(Chapter 17, Haverkort, this volume) but over a wide range in stem density, there is
little or no difference in total yield (Wurr, 1974) as shown in Fig. 33.2A. In practice,
an important effect of increasing stem density is an increase in the number of tubers
formed per square metre (Fig. 33.2B), resulting in a reduction in the mean tuber size
(Fig. 33.2C). Tuber populations generally continue to increase up to greater stem densities
than yield, but the rate of increase declines with increase in stem density (Fig. 33.2). For
crops with no requirement to limit tuber size, the optimum stem density is the minimum
required to achieve maximum yield, although the most economic yield may be somewhat
less than the maximum, particularly where seed is costly. For markets where very large
tubers are of low value or are unmarketable, and particularly for crops where a narrow
range of quite small tuber sizes are required, optimum stem densities are greater than the

minimum required to produce maximum yield (Fig. 33.3). For these crops, the optimum
stem density increases with increase in yield as more tubers are required to limit mean
tuber size. The optimum seed rate is thus determined by the number of stems expected per
seed tuber and the optimum stem density required for the target crop and expected yield.
In practice, seed rates are planned for many crops without direct reference to the
principles in Section 33.2.3.1 but based on the average economic return from prior

experience or according to empirical recommendations from experiments where a range
of seed rates have been examined (e.g. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, 1982).
In the future, optimum seed rates are increasingly likely to be determined by DSS where
mechanistic models based on the key principles can provide more accurate estimates for
specific crops, but to date, systems that have been developed (e.g. MacKerron et al., 2004)
have not been widely adopted by growers. Quantification of the changes in numbers of
stems with seed age has enabled better prediction of stem populations (Firman et al.,
2004), so that recommendations for planting densities can be improved.

33.2.3.2 Seed storage, handling and grading

(cid:2)

Seed production in many countries is carried out in regions distinct and geographically sep-
arate from those mainly used for ware (e.g. British Potato Council, 2006), with seed often
stored in the area of production until shortly before planting. For ware producers with lim-
ited facilities for seed storage, co-ordinating delivery of seed with planting requires effec-
tive logistics, and the ability to store seed locally is an advantage in unpredictable climates
where planting may be interrupted. Seed is often stored for long periods after the natural
dormant period has ended, and sprout growth must be prevented by keeping the seed
cold (typically 2–4
C) unless sprouting is desired and suitable systems implemented (see
Section 33.2.3.4). Unintended sprouting of seed in bulk often causes difficulty in handling
and planting, and damage to the fragile sprouts causes variable emergence and is associ-
ated with loss of yield and increased susceptibility to some diseases (e.g. Erwinia spp.).
Some preparation of seed for ware production by size grading may be carried out
prior to storage, or seed may be stored initially ungraded and then be prepared during
the storage period or immediately prior to dispatch for planting. Grading may be used to
divide seed into two or more fractions for better control of seed rates, and the process also
provides an opportunity to remove diseased or damaged tubers and to apply fungicidal
seed treatments. Inspection of seed may be required for certification prior to sale and
labels or plant passports issued to identify seed lots when prepared for transport. Seed

726

Firman and Allen

may be transported in bulk, large wooden boxes or polypropylene bags (often 1 t) or
smaller hessian bags (often 25–50 kg).

33.2.3.3 Seed fungicides

Seed fungicides are usually applied in a liquid spray onto tubers carried on a roller table
or as powders applied to tubers during loading into hoppers at planting. Soil adhering
to tubers adversely affects the efficacy of these treatments, and an even coverage is best
achieved with powered rollers, so that tubers are rotated to expose all surfaces to the
spray. Early application of fungicide (i.e. prior to storage) is beneficial for controlling
diseases that develop in store (e.g. Fusarium spp., Polyscytalum pustulans, Carnegie et al.,
1990), but later application can provide effective control of diseases that develop after
planting (e.g. Rhizoctonia solani, Adam and Malcolm, 1988). Many seed fungicides can
inhibit emergence particularly when applied to seed tubers after sprout growth has just
begun; so, indiscriminate use of such treatments should be avoided.

33.2.3.4 Seed sprouting

Sprouting seed prior to planting results in more rapid emergence (Headford, 1962) and,
in some varieties, production of fewer stems (Toosey, 1964), so that economic yields
can be obtained earlier than from unsprouted seed (Allen et al., 1979). Substantial sprout
development limits the maximum yield, however, as early development is at the expense
of canopy longevity. The increased cost and constraints that sprouting imposes on mech-
anization now limit its widespread adoption, but it is practised where the effects lead to
advantages for production. Typically, seed is loaded into wooden or plastic boxes each
holding <20 kg and placed in a warm well-illuminated environment (e.g. cool glasshouse
or shed with vertical hanging fluorescent strip lighting). Semi-mechanized systems for
sprouting have been developed allowing sprouting of tubers held in large suspended
nets. Insufficient light results in weak etiolated sprouts particularly at high temperatures
(cid:2)
C), and such sprouts are readily damaged during handling and planting, reducing
(>15
the advantages of sprouting and increasing variation between plants (Jarvis and Palmer,
1973). Recording the accumulation of heat units (Kelvin days) after sprout growth begins
provides a quantitative measure of sprout development proportional to the effects on crop
growth (O’Brien et al., 1983).

33.2.3.5 Seed cutting

Cutting seed is widely practised in some countries (e.g. the USA) but is not favoured in
others (e.g. the UK) as, although seed costs can be reduced by cutting, there is a cost
associated with the process, and crop establishment is often more variable particularly if
cutting allows rotting diseases to develop. Seed may be cut by hand or by machinery,
some of which is fitted with hot knives to reduce the risk of disease spread. Normally,
only large seed is cut, and the largest seed may have up to three cuts to produce as
many as six pieces, although cutting such large seed results in a wide size range of seed
pieces which increases variation in numbers of stems as some may have no eyes. Seed is
usually warmed prior to cutting, and coating the cut face of seed with lime or fungicides

Agronomic practices

727

can inhibit disease development and aid handling. Cutting a few weeks prior to planting
spreads the workload, but seed must be cured to allow cut surfaces to suberize, and,
instead, seed is often planted immediately following cutting (the same day).

33.2.4 Site selection

Potatoes can be grown on a wide range of soils, but heavy clay soils are generally
unsuitable for seedbed preparation and difficult for harvesting, whereas soils with a high
stone content result in excessive damage at harvest. Shallow soils may be unsuitable
unless ample irrigation is available, and for premium fresh market products where skin
appearance is important, abrasive soils are unsuitable with clay loams and silt soils often
giving best results. Short intervals (<4 years) between successive potato crops risk effects
of soil-borne pathogens on the succeeding crop (e.g. Hide and Read, 1991), and longer
rotations are usually practised in the UK (Minnis et al., 2002), although monoculture
of potatoes is not unknown. Inadequate intervals between crops may lead to such high
populations of some organisms, for example potato cyst nematodes (PCN), that potato
production is unsustainable. For seed and high-value crops, land with no history of potato
cropping may be sought to minimize the risk of contamination with soil-borne pathogens.
Other site considerations include availability of irrigation, access for farm operations and
the distance through which produce must be transported for storage and marketing. The
high cost of haulage is an increasingly important consideration for processing factories
and packhouses, and changes in the location of potato production may accompany the
building or expansion of facilities.

33.2.5 Soil analysis

Soil samples are often taken to provide an estimate of nutrient availability for crop
growth, and soil may also be analysed for pH, soil texture and presence of pathogens.
The amount of P, K and Mg required as fertiliser is dependent on the availability of
these elements in the soil, and analysis may also indicate a requirement for other minor
elements. In contrast, the content of organic matter affects the mineralization of N, but
soil mineral N content varies with date of sampling, and a practical, predictive relation
with N requirement has not been demonstrated. For nutrient analysis, soil in the top 30 cm
is usually sampled from several points in each field and sub-sampled to provide a single
composite sample for analysis. Texture analysis of the soil to a depth of a metre or more
may be carried out to determine the water holding capacity of the soil (Hall et al., 1977)
for irrigation scheduling in addition to determining characteristics of the topsoil which
have wider importance. Sampling for PCN is routinely practised where this pathogen is
endemic and the detection and quantification of other soil-borne pathogens and diseases
are of increasing interest as diagnostic techniques improve (Barker et al., 2005). Detecting
a low incidence of infestation requires rigorous and costly sampling particularly where
distribution is patchy and the relation between measures of soil inoculum and their
consequences for crops are currently unknown for many diseases.

728

33.2.6 Fertiliser

Firman and Allen

Fertiliser requirements are affected by soil type and nutrient content, previous cropping,
the expected length of the growing season and variety grown (e.g. Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, 2000). Where the cost of excess fertiliser is marginal in relation to
any loss of yield from inadequate application, fertilisers may be applied at a rate equal
to or above that required for maximum yield. However, excess fertiliser N can decrease
yield, make haulm destruction more difficult and reduce quality as well as increasing
N residues susceptible to leaching. Fertilisers can affect many aspects of the crop other
than yield (e.g. number of tubers, dry matter concentration, susceptibility to bruising and
disorders), but there is little evidence that such effects are of great importance where crops
are grown with levels of nutrients at or near that required for optimum yield. Fertiliser
application may also be made to maintain or improve soil reserves, so that removal of
nutrients (particularly P and K) over time does not deplete the soil, although the slow
rate of change of soil reserves is only important over long time frames (decades). On
many soils in Great Britain, there is little or no effect of P or K fertiliser on potato yield
(Allison et al., 2001a,b), and although rates of application have declined over the 1990s,
these remain high (Fig. 33.4) and greater than required for maximizing potato yield or
maintaining soil indices in the medium term.

Although requirements for P, K, Mg and minor elements can be determined quite
accurately from soil analysis, requirement for N generally cannot be determined, even
though it often has the greatest effect on crop growth. Nitrogen requirements are least
following crops where there is much residual N (e.g. lucerne) or where large amounts
of farmyard manure or slurry were applied to the preceding crop. Indeterminate varieties
require less N than determinate varieties to produce and maintain a persistent leaf canopy
(Firman et al., 1995), and short-season crops require relatively little applied N or none.
Nitrogen requirements are greatest for crops following cereals, poor quality permanent
pasture or where N has been depleted by the previous crop and high winter rainfall.

Britain (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2004).

Agronomic practices

729

More N is required for crops where a long period of growth is anticipated and for
determinate varieties that produce relatively few leaves (Allen and Scott, 2001).

Fertiliser is often applied by broadcasting just prior to planting and then incorporating it
as part of the soil preparation. Despite the conclusion of Cooke et al. (1957) that there was
no justification for applying top-dressings of nitrogen to potatoes that received adequate
amounts at planting, there remains much interest in sequential applications of N during
crop growth especially in North America. Even on light soils where leaching might be
expected, there are few data to support the use of split N applications. Fertiliser can be
applied around the seed tubers, but such placement is unlikely to be beneficial unless
root growth is restricted and high local concentrations of fertiliser may be deleterious.
Liquid application of major and minor nutrients to growing crops is practised, sometimes
using irrigation water (fertigation), and is often combined with systems for establishing
nutrient requirements from analysis of plant nutrient status. The uptake of nutrients
through foliage is often limited particularly as crops mature, and the relation between
various measurements of plant nutrient status (e.g. petiole N, see MacKerron et al., 1995)
and optimal status at any time is complex and may not be amenable to augmentation, so
that such systems may be of limited benefit.

33.3 SOIL MANAGEMENT

33.3.1 Cultivation

Soil cultivation is a very important aspect of potato production as effects of the tilth of the
seedbed and resistance of soil to root penetration may be very significant for many aspects
of production including growth of the crop, tuber quality and incidence of disease (Van
Loon and Bouma, 1978; Rosenfeld, 1997). Planting may be preceded by four cultivations,
ploughing, bed-forming, bed-tilling and destoning or declodding, so that a large volume
of soil may be moved although fewer cultivations are preferable where possible, saving
energy and reducing risk of damage to soil structure. Between 1978 and 2007, there has
been almost universal adoption of this sequence of cultivations in the UK with a great
increase in the depth of working. In many other countries, levelling and cultivating to
c. 30 cm suffice prior to planting (Stalham et al., in press).

Ploughing is often carried out in winter, but on light soils, ploughing immediately
prior to planting is possible unless there is appreciable trash to bury and decompose.
Excessively deep ploughing or cultivation of wet soil results in compaction and smearing.
Compaction may impede drainage leading to poor root growth, increase diseases favoured
by wet conditions (e.g. blackleg and many tuber-rotting diseases) and can lead to lenticel
eruption and difficult harvesting conditions. Compacted soil also inhibits root penetration
directly, adversely affecting the rate of plant development and the availability of nutrients
and water.

Bed-forming produces a mound of soil between furrows where the tractor wheels run,
and depending on the soil type, this bed may require further cultivation to produce a
suitable seedbed for planting, but rotary bed-tillers can produce an over-fine tilth and
ridges with unstable, structureless soil. Destoning or declodding separates stones and

730

Firman and Allen

large clods from the top soil through a web or series of fingered ‘stars’ and deposits
them in windrows (furrows), whereas smaller clods are broken up through a series of
oscillating blades, stars or fine webs. This can reduce severe tuber damage during harvest
by up to 50% and allow up to a 40% increase in the spot rate of harvesting (Whitney and
McRae, 1992), although mechanisms for separation have improved on modern harvesters.
Separation and breakdown of clods also enables a fine seedbed to be produced, so that
close contact between soil and tubers occurs. This is beneficial for early growth of seed
tubers, and as dry pockets of soil are less likely to occur, control of common scab may
be improved. A fine seedbed may also aid efficacy of herbicides and reduce greening of
tubers from penetration of light into the soil, but on some soils, slumping may occur if
excessive cultivation destroys soil structure.

33.3.2 Control of soil-borne pests and diseases

The survival of several important pests and diseases between potato crops allows these to
increase to economically damaging populations with the relatively short rotations often
practised. For soil pests, fumigant chemicals (e.g. metham sodium) are occasionally used
to treat soil some weeks prior to planting using specialist machinery. More commonly,
non-fumigant chemicals (e.g. aldicarb and fozthiazate) are incorporated immediately prior
to planting as part of seedbed preparation using bed-tilling machinery to provide partial
control of free-living nematodes and PCN as well as wireworm larvae (Agriotes spp.). For
control of free-living nematodes, in-furrow application is sometimes recommended as the
aim is to inhibit transmission of tobacco rattle virus to daughter tubers by the nematode
vectors rather than overall control of the nematode population as is the case with PCN.
Use of soil-applied fungicides is generally less common than seed treatments, but these are
sometimes used for soil-borne R. solani (e.g. pencycuron) and Colletotrichum coccodes
(e.g. azoxystrobin) and in-furrow application with specialist equipment is practised to
provide the most efficient control.

33.3.3 Weed control

Control of weeds by mechanical means is rarely practised except by producers of ‘organic’
crops as in most situations very effective control can be achieved by use of herbicides.
Mechanical control by harrowing down of ridges and re-ridging two or three times can
be effective during early growth, and weeds are subsequently suppressed by the crop,
provided adequate foliage is produced, but damage to plants and soil compaction can
reduce yield. Pre-planting cultivations usually obviate the requirement for pre-planting
herbicides, but these may be used (generally systemic products such as glyphosate) in
autumn or spring where perennial species are present and for control of potato weeds from
previous crops. Soil-acting pre-emergence treatments applied after planting, but before
potatoes and weeds have emerged, are generally the most important herbicides. These
remain active for several weeks after application in undisturbed soil and are absorbed
by shallow roots of weed species. Soil-acting pre-emergence herbicides do not usually
affect potatoes, but shallow-planted minitubers (used for seed multiplication) may be
damaged by some products particularly if they are washed down to rooting depth. Contact

Agronomic practices

731

pre-emergence treatment may be required along with soil-acting products where weed
seedlings have grown sufficiently to be insensitive to the residual herbicides. Application
of pre-emergence herbicides is often delayed, so that products remain effective until
weeds are suppressed by the crop. Applications may be made after some plants have
emerged resulting in good weed control but at the expense of some check to early crop
establishment. Post-emergence treatments may be active through foliage and soil and
depend on physiological selectivity between potatoes and the weeds but can generally
only be used on relatively small potato plants without causing significant damage.

33.3.4 Irrigation

Irrigation is widely practised both to increase yield and to improve the quality of potatoes.
Irrigation affects the severity of several diseases (e.g. Adams et al., 1987) with some
increased (e.g. black dot caused by C. coccodes) and others reduced (e.g. silver scurf
caused by Helminthosporium solani), so that irrigation is generally applied mainly to
increase yield. For premium markets, irrigation is applied for control of common scab
(Streptomyces scabiei) as very little disease develops if a low soil moisture deficit is
maintained in the soil surrounding developing tubers for approximately 6 weeks following
tuber initiation (Lapwood et al., 1973). Irrigation to achieve this is often in excess of that
required to maintain soil moisture deficits less than those limiting crop growth. Irrigation
may also be applied prior to harvest to reduce the tuber damage that can result from
harvesting in dry conditions when insufficient soil is present on the harvester web to
cushion tubers. Irrigation can also be used to protect crops against frost damage when
short periods of frost occur (e.g. in Mediterranean countries).

For large fields, irrigation is usually carried out using either centre pivot sprinkler
systems or hose reels coupled to rain guns or booms, but several other systems are used
particularly for smaller fields, including grids of sprinklers, drip tape and flood irrigation.
Centre pivot systems require a high initial investment, and as these are fixed, the other
crops in the rotation should require irrigation so as to justify the expense. Sprinklers
mounted on booms that are not fixed are also used but, for mobile irrigation systems,
readily transported rain-guns are more common, although their distribution of water is
less uniform (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2005), and they are
unsuitable for the application of small quantities of water (approximately <15 mm).

Efficient use of irrigation depends on supplementing soil water and rainfall with the
minimum amount of water to ensure that crop growth rates are not limited by soil
water availability. In arid environments (e.g. parts of South Africa and the USA) where
potatoes are grown on light soils, the frequency of irrigation is high, and stored soil water
makes only a limited contribution to crop growth. In wetter environments, a soil water
deficit is allowed to accumulate, so that soils contribute more to the overall water need
and can accept some rainfall without exceeding field capacity. Scheduling of irrigation
aims to balance crop demand (evapotranspiration) with the supply of water from the
soil, and the basic calculations are well documented (Penman, 1948; Monteith, 1965;
Thom and Oliver, 1977). More recently, irrigation requirements have been determined
from measurement of soil moisture, but adequate accurate instrumentation (e.g. using
neutron probes) is difficult to achieve (Gaze et al., 2002), and so calculating soil moisture

from inputs and evapotranspiration using meteorological and crop data is generally more
successful. The trigger for irrigation applications may be based on the requirement for
control of common scab (i.e. soil moisture in the ridge surrounding daughter tubers)
or to maintain the soil moisture deficit above a critical value, so that plant growth
is not adversely affected. The limiting soil moisture deficit for plant growth increases
with rooting depth (Fig. 33.5) and scheduling systems making allowance for this enable
the most effective use of water (Stalham et al., 1999). Where irrigation is based on
average crop requirements (e.g. 25 mm per week) rather than scheduling, crops may
become dry or be over-irrigated during periods according to prevailing meteorological
conditions and crop development. In practice, the ability to meet irrigation demand may
be limited by the available equipment or by water supply. Improved efficiency in use
of irrigation is increasingly likely to be required in Europe and elsewhere to conform
with regulations such as the European Water Framework Directive (European Parliament
and Council, 2000) that recognizes the importance of controlling abstraction of surface
and groundwater. As a significant amount of the irrigation of potatoes is not scheduled
quantitatively, there is much improvement to be made.

33.4 CROP ESTABLISHMENT AND MANAGEMENT

33.4.1 Planting

Although early spring planting has the potential to maximize the growing season in some
climates, the start of planting may be delayed to avoid soil damage from working wet
soil or the risk of frost damage after emergence. Seed planted early in cold soil emerges
slowly, and small canopies may result, but the requirement to plant large areas may
necessitate planting to begin earlier than is optimal for crop growth.

Agronomic practices

733

Potatoes are usually planted into relatively widely spaced ridges (typically approxi-
mately 0.9 m apart) with two to four rows planted at a time by placing tubers into a furrow
created by an opening body after which a closing body forms the ridge of soil over the
tuber. Planting into beds (typically 1.8 m wide) comprising three or more rows is also
carried out, reducing the rectangularity of plant spacing and allowing for staggered spac-
ing to reduce early competition between plants. Use of beds is often adopted where large
numbers of tubers are required (seed and salad crops) or to improve conservation of soil
moisture. Planters require systems for singulating seed tubers and adjusting the spacing
to plant single tubers or seed pieces at the required spacing. Singulation is achieved by
using cups, by forming a stream of touching tubers in belt planters or by pick machines.
Shallow planting can delay emergence if soils dry near the surface (Firman et al., 1992)
and can increase the proportion of green tubers at harvest, whereas overly deep planting
also delays emergence and may result in harvesting problems, so that tubers are generally
planted approximately 15 cm deep with allowance made in some soils for slumping or
erosion of the ridge.

33.4.2 Crop protection

Subsequent to application of seed fungicides (Section 33.2.3.3) and products to control
soil-borne pests and diseases (Section 33.3.2), fungicides, insecticides and molluscicides
may be applied throughout crop growth. The number of sprays and active substances
applied to potato crops has tended to increase although rates of application (kg/ha) have
generally decreased (e.g. Garthwaite et al., 2005). Control of late blight (Phytophthora
infestans) is often the most important crop protection consideration for potato crops
worldwide, and with 15 or more foliar applications on some crops (e.g. Bradshaw et al.,
2000), it represents a significant input of active substances. Products used for protection
against late blight also control other diseases that would otherwise be important (e.g. early
blight, Alternaria solani). Application of fungicides for late blight may begin shortly
after emergence and be repeated at intervals of 7 days or less where conditions are
highly conducive for blight. In many countries, a proportion of Phytophthora isolates
are resistant to widely used phenylamide fungicides (Gisi and Cohen, 1996), but many
other very effective protectant and systemic products are available (Whitehead, 2005),
and application usually prevents significant development of foliar blight, whereas without
fungicides total crop loss may occur. Even with only limited development of foliar blight,
there is a risk of tuber blight developing in store particularly where tubers are harvested,
while active spores remain in the soil, and a delay in harvest following crop desiccation
may be justified to reduce this.

Applications of foliar sprays are often conducted with tractor-mounted sprayers but
aerial spraying is practised in some regions. Sprays cannot be applied effectively during
rainfall or high winds, and when soils are very wet, spraying by tractor may be difficult.
Prolonged periods of unsuitable spraying conditions may allow infection to occur, and
some appreciation of practical constraints to application of pesticides is necessary for
effective application of DSS for crop protection. DSS are used for scheduling blight sprays
(Chapter 36, Marshall, this volume) in the Netherlands, UK and elsewhere, and adoption

734

Firman and Allen

may enable a reduction in the number of applications and input of active ingredients
(Bouma, 2003).

Insecticides are used to control pests that defoliate the crop (notably Colorado beetle)
in some regions but also may be applied to control pests causing tuber damage or vectors
of virus diseases such as aphids. Control of virus spread is particularly important in
seed crops, but use of aphicides to limit virus spread may be of limited efficacy where
non-colonizing vectors are important (e.g. with potato virus Y). Molluscicides may be
applied as pellets broadcast by spinning disc applicators with some growers making repeat
applications at the same time as application of blight sprays.

33.4.3 Covers, mulches, soil amendments and intercropping

Crop covers are used in some climates to avoid frost damage and advance crop growth
by raising soil and air temperatures. Non-woven agricultural fleece generally allows
for greater penetration of water than perforated polythene that may also be subject to
condensation. Covers are generally applied at planting in strips covering one or more
beds each and held in place by burying the edges with soil. Covers of fleece or fine net
may also be used as a barrier to aphid vectors of viruses for seed multiplication.

Mulching and incorporation of soil amendments are not widely practised but can be
used to retain moisture and reduce temperature (Midmore et al., 1986) for soil amelioration
and to provide some control of pests and pathogens. Intercropping with maize (Zea mays)
or other crops is practised in some countries, and although contrasting growth habits of
potato and other plants can enable more efficient utilization of resources, intercropping
is not necessarily more profitable than a sole potato crop (Ifenkwe and Odurukwe, 1990;
Liu and Midmore, 1990).

33.4.4 Defoliation

Crops left to senesce naturally may be harvested without defoliation but, where yield and
tuber size are sufficient, defoliation is frequently carried out to end growth. Defoliation
may also aid harvesting and advance the date of skin set, enabling earlier harvesting
of undamaged tubers. Large quantities of haulm on harvesters may interfere with tuber
separation and, where tubers remained attached to stolons, damage can be increased.
Green top harvesting is carried out where set skins are not required, but it may still require
haulm to be mechanically pulverized immediately prior to harvest. Following defoliation,
the tuber periderm becomes progressively more resistant to removal (Bowen et al., 1996),
but depending on variety and conditions, an interval of 2–6 weeks may be required before
significant damage can be avoided by harvesters.

Defoliation may be achieved mechanically, chemically, by burning or indirectly by
undercutting the roots. Desiccation with sulphuric acid, often as two sequential appli-
cations, is usually very effective but requires specialist contractors to apply it, whereas
herbicides such as diquat and glufosinate ammonium can be applied by farm sprayers.
Risk of stem-end necrosis and vascular discolouration of tubers resulting from desicca-
tion can be minimized by sequential applications of relatively low doses or by adopting
combinations of mechanical and chemical treatment.

Mechanized harvesters separate tubers from haulm, soil, clods and stones on a series
of rollers and webs and collect the tubers for transport from the field. The design and
settings of the harvester affect the efficiency with which tubers of the required size are
harvested with minimal damage. Failure to optimize the harvesting process can result
in damage in numerous ways; tubers may be crushed by over-sized tractor wheels, cut
by inadequate depth of the share, pinched by haulm removal rollers and scuffed and
bruised by bouncing and rolling on the webs. It is important that the forward speed and
main web speed are sufficient to carry some soil to the top of the main web, so that
tubers are cushioned (e.g. Bentini et al., 2006). Separation is improved by agitation of the
webs, but excessive agitation results in bouncing or rolling of tubers. Significant bruising
may result where tubers fall from the elevator into a box or trailer, and the height of
this drop should be minimized. Regular monitoring of potatoes for scuffing and bruising
during the harvesting period allows problems to be identified and appropriate action to

be taken. Samples placed in a ‘hot box’ (high humidity and approximately 35
early warning of bruising, so that changes can be made to avoid future storage problems,
and electronic potatoes with impact sensors can be used to identify the position on the
harvester where tubers are most likely to be damaged. Some harvesting problems can be
related to the beginning of the season with poor seedbed preparation resulting in cloddy
soils (Campbell, 1982) and excessive planting depth necessitating digging shares to be
set deeply. Two-stage harvesting, where the crop is dug and two or more rows deposited
in a windrow prior to lifting, may offer advantages over single-stage harvesting under
some conditions including faster lifting rates of low yielding crops, and is practised in
parts of the USA but use elsewhere is limited.

33.5 POST-HARVEST HANDLING AND STORAGE

A significant quantity of potatoes is processed or consumed soon after harvest (see
Section 33.2.1), but most crops are stored prior to use. For almost all markets, some
grading and sorting of the crop is carried out, and for premium markets, sophisticated
facilities are used to prepare and package ‘pre-pack’ potatoes. Potatoes are washed
to remove soil and graded by size (diameter) or weight according to the particular
market requirements. Damaged, green and diseased tubers can be removed by manual or
computerized detection systems to meet high quality-thresholds provided the proportion
of tubers rejected is relatively low. Some preliminary grading and application of fungicide
may be carried out prior to storage, but generally this is not done.

Scuffed surfaces of potatoes harvested without set skins cure within a few days of
harvest, so that for the fresh market, efficient supply chains are used to ensure products
reach retail outlets without losing quality. For some products, hydro-cooling is used to
reduce the temperature of the potatoes within hours of harvest before transport to packers
and retailers. Washing of potatoes prior to transport is advantageous for processors, and
waste remains near the site of production.

Firman and Allen

Potatoes are stored in bulk and box stores, and although bulk stores are generally
cheaper, they do not readily allow segregation of different lots. The risk of pressure
bruising can limit the depth of piles in bulk stores to 4 m although in the USA piles 7 m
deep are stored. Fans are used to provide controlled ventilation through the crop (positive
ventilation), and air can be vented through apertures for cooling and be re-circulated to
prevent condensation. Automated controls optimize the use of re-circulated and fresh air
for storage in relation to external conditions (e.g. use of cool night air for cooling), but
refrigeration and heating may be required depending on the climate.

Stores are ideally loaded within 7–10 days to limit differences in initial storage condi-
tions for early and later harvested tubers. Within the first few hours of potatoes entering
the store, ventilation is important to remove surface moisture. Increased moisture loss
and risk of disease resulting from unset skins and wounds can be reduced by holding
tubers above 10
C for 10–14 days (Wigginton, 1974) before storage at lower tempera-
tures, but this curing period may be reduced or eliminated where loss of quality through
development of blemishing disease is more important. Once wound healing of the last
crop into store is complete, store temperatures are reduced to holding temperatures at
(cid:2)
approximately 0(cid:4)5

C per day.

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

For stored potatoes, maintaining quality requires control of sprouting, dehydration and
disease. Over long periods of storage, changes in tuber composition, notably in reducing
sugars, also occur affecting taste and processing characteristics, and these changes may
limit the duration of storage even in the absence of deterioration from other causes. Storage
temperature, relative humidity, ventilation and composition of the storage atmosphere may
all be controlled to optimize storage for periods of 10 months or more. Once the dormant
period has passed, sprout growth will occur unless storage is below approximately 2
C
or control measures are used to suppress sprouting. For table potatoes, storage for more
than 6 months is possible without the use of control measures where temperatures of
(cid:2)
approximately 3
C are used, and this has been widely adopted to avoid use of chemical
sprout suppressants such as chlorpropham. Modifying storage atmospheres with ethylene
and other volatile compounds can also be used to limit sprouting in table potatoes,
although their use is not currently widespread. For processing crops, potatoes are generally
stored between 6 and 10
C with lower temperatures used for the longer periods of
storage (8 months or more), and use of chlorpropham to suppress sprouting is normal
(e.g. Anderson et al., 2004). Usually, products are first applied within a few weeks of
filling stores and several applications may be made, although long-term storage without
sprouting can be achieved from a single application as is widely used in the USA. Foliar
application of growth regulators such as maleic hydrazide may be made several weeks
prior to harvest to suppress sprouting during storage although these are frequently used
in conjunction with products applied in store. In well-sealed stores, a bulk of potatoes
maintains a high humidity (approximately 96%), but humidification is used to limit
moisture loss particularly in dry climates.

33.5.1 Crop monitoring

During the life of a potato crop, considerable information is recorded, particularly in order
to meet the requirements of various national and commercial crop assurance schemes

Agronomic practices

737

(e.g. Assured Produce, 2006). Most of these records are documentations of the practices
and agro-chemicals used and contribute nothing to the management of the crop. A body
of crop-specific meteorological data is collected by some growers, and this may be used
in DSS to support disease forecasting. There is, as yet, generally only limited recording
of the growth of the crop and of the key parameters determining success – number of
stems and tubers, time course of leaf canopy and quality attributes. As a result, many
growers do not know the results of their planning and the reasons for their success or
failure, and no managerial decisions are taken during the crops’ life based on measurement
of the crops’ true state. This is likely to change as understanding of crop growth and
development has improved to allow prediction of future events – yield and tuber size
distribution (e.g. MacKerron et al., 2004) – to be made with sufficient accuracy to have
commercial value. Electronic transmission of images and data allows remote access to
crop production intelligence for an increasing number of growers to facilitate this.

34.1 INTRODUCTION

Potato plants require over 14 essential mineral elements (Table 34.1), which include both
macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) and trace elements (Cl, Fe, Mn, B, Zn, Cu, Mo and
Ni). These are generally acquired from the soil solution by the root system. For adequate
nutrition and, to avoid mineral toxicities, the concentrations of these elements in plant
tissues must be maintained within certain limits. Insufficient tissue mineral concentrations
limit potential growth and can affect tuber quality, whereas excess mineral concentrations
may inhibit growth through toxicity.

Often, the soil solution lacks sufficient mineral elements for optimal plant growth, and
to achieve maximal tuber yields, fertilisers are added to soils. Typical responses in tuber
yield to N, P and K fertilisation are shown in Fig. 34.1. The amounts of fertiliser required
for maximal yields will depend on environmental factors such as soil type, soil mineral

concentrations and weather conditions, agronomic factors such as timing, location and
chemical form of the fertiliser applied and genetic factors such as longevity, growth rate
and tissue mineral requirements of a potato variety (Defra, 2000; Dampney et al., 2002;
White et al., 2005b).

Currently, potato production in Great Britain occupies 141 000 hectares, represent-
ing about 3% of its arable land (Defra, 2005), and about 18 600 000 hectares world-
wide (FAO, 2006), representing approximately 1.2% of all cultivated land. However,
although N fertilisation rates are similar to other tillage crops, a disproportionate amount
of P fertiliser and K fertiliser is applied to the potato crop, which, for example, con-
sumes about 9.4% of the inorganic P fertiliser and 11.8% of the inorganic K fertiliser
applied to tillage crops in Great Britain (Defra, 2005). Although appropriate mineral
fertilisation is necessary to maintain tuber yields, excessive fertiliser applications are
not only an unnecessary financial burden but can also lead to reduced yields, due
to mineral toxicities, and environmental pollution. The contribution to eutrophication
of watercourses through the use of N and P fertilisers in agriculture is of particular
concern for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) in
the EU, which aims to deliver good ecological status in European waters by 2015,
and similar legislation in other countries, such as the USA where the Clean Water
Act (PL-95-217; 1977) is enforced. Unfortunately, inefficient N (Zebarth et al., 2004)
and P fertilisation (Dampney et al., 2002) is a particular problem for the potato crop,
which generally recovers <70% of broadcast N fertiliser and <10% of broadcast P
fertiliser in the year it is applied (Tran and Giroux, 1991; Dampney et al., 2002). To
address this problem, agronomists aim to devise protocols to reduce fertiliser losses
to the environment, and plant breeders aim to develop varieties that acquire and uti-
lize mineral elements more efficiently (Davenport et al., 2005; White et al., 2005a).
In addition, microbiologists aim to identify and foster soil microbial communities
that improve mineral acquisition by crops (McArthur and Knowles, 1993; Morgan
et al., 2005).

34.2 OPTIMIZING THE APPLICATION OF FERTILISERS

Plant roots take up most mineral elements in their ionic forms (White, 2003, Chapter 15,
this volume). Because the relative concentrations of different ions in the soil solution
vary greatly, their speed of movement in the soil and availability to plant root systems
differ considerably. Some ions, such as nitrate and potassium, are sufficiently avail-
able and mobile in fertilised soils to supply plant demand, but the root system must
forage for less readily available ions, such as phosphate (Barber, 1995). Conversely,
leaching through the soil profile is of concern for nitrate and potassium, but not for
phosphate. Most P is lost from fields in infrequent, discrete runoff events (Sharpley
et al., 2002). Thus, agronomic strategies to optimize the use of N, P and K fertilisers
differ.

34.2.1 Nitrogen

and NO3

−1, sugarbeet 120 kg N ha

The initial N requirement of the potato crop can usually be met from the mineral-N
present in the soil at planting and further N made available from transformation processes
in the soil. However, although the surface layers of most cultivated soils generally contain
between 0.1 and 0.5% N, which means that the 3500 tonnes of soil in the top 25-cm
layer of a 1-ha field contains between 3.5 and 17.5 tonnes of N, mineralization rates of
this N into forms that can be acquired by the plant (NH4
) are too low to
sustain growth throughout the season and certainly not enough to provide maximal yield.
At planting, this N is present in soils as soil organic matter (SOM), at various degrees
of humification, and in the incorporated residues of the previous crop. The amount of
N in these residues is dependent on the identity of the previous crop. For example,
−1 and
potato residues may contain the equivalent of 35 kg N ha
−1 (Velthof et al., 1999). Although the N in these residues
wheat residues 25 kg N ha
will be gradually mineralized to plant available forms, not all of this N will become
available to the following crop. Significant losses are associated with the transformation
of soil organic N to mineral N, both as NOx gasses during nitrification and through
leaching of the NO3
and uptake by
soil microorganisms will also reduce the amount of N available to plants. The rates of N
mineralization and immobilization respond to cultivation and soil disturbance: maximal
rates of both N mineralization and N immobilization follow ploughing or formation of
ridges. Hence, predicting the amounts of N fertiliser to apply to a particular crop requires
an accurate estimate of the N that will be available from previous residues and the SOM
(Fig. 34.1). Soil type and winter rainfall are also important parameters in this calculation.
To optimize tuber production, N must be added in the form of organic or inorganic
fertilisers. Organic manures used as a source of N will also contain P, K and other mineral
elements. Some of the N present in such manures will be as NH4
, but most requires
microbial transformation from an organic form to NH4
and possibly also conversion
to NO3
before it becomes available to the crop. Interestingly, the crop itself appears
to promote the availability of mineral N (Fig. 34.2). On most soils, fertilisation with
−1 is recommended for
inorganic NH4
maximal tuber yields. This can be broadcast over a field before furrow formation, placed

formed. Immobilization of both NH4

application is critical to achieve optimal plant uptake and subsequent yield, with minimal
negative environmental impact. For example, more N is lost to the environment, and yield
may be reduced, if N fertilisers are applied unnecessarily early (Fig. 34.3).

this is exchangeable, water soluble and available for uptake by plant roots. Typical K

concentrations in the soil solution lie between 0.01 and 0(cid:2)2 mg K ml
However, because K is comparatively mobile in the soil solution, its movement through
the soil rarely limits plant growth. Hence, K fertilisation is an effective method to supply
the demand of a potato crop for K, and soil analysis is an effective guide for K-fertiliser
application rates (Vos, 1996). It has been observed that the K concentration in the soil
solution required for optimal growth is much greater for potato than for many other
crops. For example, sugar beet and wheat achieved 90% of their maximum growth at
a K concentration of about 5 (cid:3)M under conditions when potato required at least 50 (cid:3)M
for maximum growth (Steingrobe and Claassen, 2000). Thus, K fertilisation of potato is
generally greater than that of other crops (Allison et al., 2001b; Defra, 2005). The large
applications of K fertiliser to the potato crop, coupled with the mobility of K through the
soil profile, may present an environmental challenge. Under continuous potato cultivation,
K inputs are significantly greater and the K-input/K-offtake quotient is much higher than
in a conventional rotation (Vos, 1996). However, absolute K offtake is greater under
continuous potato cultivation than in a conventional rotation, because potato tubers have
higher K concentrations than tissues of other crops, such as wheat (Vos, 1996). The
−1. Over-application
optimum K-fertiliser application rate in most soils is 170–210 kg K ha
of K fertiliser may cause a reduction in tuber dry matter concentrations. In a conventional
rotation, the excess K inputs to the potato crop will probably be used by the following

−1 were also applied

crops, but it would be more desirable to balance the inputs better during potato cultivation.
This might be achieved by better positioning of K fertilisers to improve their availability
and uptake by roots of young plants. The timing of the application of K fertilisers may
also be significant, but it will be much more difficult to modify cultivation techniques to
accommodate this.

34.2.3 Phosphorus

The effects of P fertilisation on tuber yield are thought to be a direct consequence of
increased leaf area index, ground cover and radiation absorption (Harris, 1992; Jenkins
and Ali, 1999, 2000; Allison et al., 2001a; Dampney et al., 2002; White et al., 2005b).
The application of P fertiliser results in increased ground cover at tuber initiation and,
often, also throughout the season. Because yield is dependent on photoassimilate and
radiation absorption during the period of tuber initiation is one of the factors influencing
the number of tubers found at harvest, P fertilisation produces not only greater yields but
also more tubers.

Minerals, soils and roots

745

Plant roots take up P from the soil solution as phosphate. Because phosphate is
present at low concentrations in the soil solution and is relatively immobile in the soil,
agronomic strategies to improve P-fertiliser use efficiency (PUE) have focused on placing
concentrated P-fertilisers close to seed tubers at planting. A typical potato plant will have
access only to the P fertiliser placed close to its roots during its initial growth period,
when most P is accumulated and P is in greatest demand for tuber production (Simpson,
1962; Asfary et al., 1983; Van Noordwijk et al., 1990; Kolbe and Stephan-Beckmann,
1997; Dampney et al., 2002). Thus, placing P fertilisers close to the seed tuber often
results in more efficient capture of fertiliser P, accelerated early growth and a small
increase in final tuber yield (Prummel, 1957; Verma and Grewal, 1979; Harris, 1992;
Lewis and Kettlewell, 1992; Sparrow et al., 1992), although care must be taken to avoid
high salt concentrations in the rhizosphere (Harris, 1992; Hegney and McPharlin, 1999).
In a recent field-plot experiment at Warwick HRI (Wellesbourne, UK), equivalent yields
of tubers to those achieved by broadcasting the amount of P fertiliser recommended in
the UK (Defra, 2000) were obtained by placing half this amount at a distance 3 inches
below and 3 inches to the side of the seed tuber (P.J. White, H.C. Bowen, R. Hayden,
M.C. Meacham, W.P. Spracklen and J.P. Hammond, Warwick HRI, UK, unpublished
data). It is thought that P fertiliser placed close to the seed tuber will be acquired most
efficiently by a vigorous plant with a rapidly developing, extensive root system and that
this phenotype will subsequently exploit the entire soil volume most effectively (White
et al., 2005b). Indeed, higher root length density (RLD = root length per unit volume
soil) and specific root length (SRL = root length per unit root mass) are correlated
with improved soil exploration, increased P acquisition, faster canopy development and,
ultimately, a greater tuber yield (Opena and Porter, 1999). Eventually, the ability of the
potato root system to exploit the soil volume will be limited by competition with its
neighbours and by physical constraints. In particular, the depth to which the potato root
system can explore the soil is restricted by its inability to penetrate beneath the plough
pan (Lesczynski and Tanner, 1976; Gregory and Simmonds, 1992). Thus, agronomic
practices such as deep tillage of compacted soils have been advocated that might increase
P acquisition and, thereby, increase tuber yields (Gregory and Simmonds, 1992).

34.3 OPTIMIZING PLANT PHYSIOLOGY FOR MINERAL ACQUISITION

AND UTILIZATION

One strategy to reduce fertiliser inputs and the loss of minerals to the environment is to
develop potato varieties that acquire or utilize mineral elements more efficiently. There
are many definitions for mineral use efficiency in the literature, which can be divided
into three conceptual categories (Gourley et al., 1994; Baligar et al., 2001; Greenwood
et al., 2005; White et al., 2005a).

The first category is concerned with productivity. Definitions include (1) yield on
low-mineral soils, (2) yield obtained with insufficient fertilisation divided by the yield
obtained with sufficient fertilisation, (3) increase in yield per unit of added fertiliser,
which is often referred to as agronomic efficiency, and (4) amount, or concentration, of
a mineral element in the rooting medium required for a given percentage of maximum

746

White et al.

yield, which may be expressed as either the ‘Km’ value required for half-maximal yield
or the ‘critical’ value required for 90% yield. Crops and varieties with low values for Km
and critical mineral supply will achieve their maximal yield with minimal fertilisation.

The second category is concerned with mineral acquisition from the soil. Definitions
include (1) amount of a mineral element in a plant at a given concentration of the mineral
element in the rooting medium, (2) amount of a mineral element in a plant divided by root
biomass, both of which are referred to as mineral acquisition efficiency in the literature,
(3) amount of a mineral element in a plant divided by the amount of the element applied in
fertiliser and (4) percentage of the element added in fertiliser that is present in the crop at
harvest, which is referred to as the fertiliser recovery efficiency. Crops with high mineral
acquisition efficiencies generally grow well on soils with low mineral availability, and
crops with high fertiliser recovery efficiencies reduce pollution.

The third category is concerned with the internal mineral economy of plants. Definitions
include (1) yield divided by the amount of a mineral in the plant, which is referred to
as the mineral efficiency ratio, (2) yield divided by tissue mineral concentration, which
is referred to as tissue, or physiological, mineral use efficiency, and (3) tissue mineral
concentration required for a given percentage of maximum yield, which is referred to as
the ‘critical’ tissue mineral concentration if this is 90% of maximum yield. Crops and
varieties with lower critical tissue mineral concentrations are likely to tolerate growth on
soils with low mineral availability.

In the context of this section, reference will be made to varietal differences in (1)
agronomic efficiency, as yield with low fertiliser inputs or per unit fertiliser supply,
(2) acquisition efficiency, as the amount of an element in a plant divided by the root
biomass, and (3) tissue utilization efficiency, expressed as the reciprocal of tissue mineral
concentration.

34.3.1 Nitrogen

Potato varieties differ in their agronomic N-fertiliser use efficiency, their N acquisi-
tion efficiency and their tissue nitrogen utilization efficiency (Kleinkopf et al., 1981;
Sattelmacher et al., 1990a; Errebhi et al., 1999; Govindakrishnan et al., 1999; Saluzzo
et al., 1999; Zebarth et al., 2004; Love et al., 2005).

In general, early maturing (determinate) varieties have the lowest agronomic N-fertiliser
use efficiency (Zebarth et al., 2004), which has been attributed to their shorter growth
period. This is reflected in the recommendation by Defra that more N fertiliser be
applied to determinate varieties than indeterminate varieties (Defra, 2000). However,
potato varieties capable of good yields with low N inputs have been identified within
groups of varieties with similar longevity. For example, the early maturing variety Kufri
−1 to yield 33(cid:2)4 t ha
−1 compared with the standard variety
Ashoka required only 65 kg N ha
−1, and the medium maturing variety
Kufri Chandramukh, which needed 194 kg N ha
−1 compared with the standard
MS 78-46 required only 133 kg N ha
−1 (Govindakrishnan et al., 1999). In the
variety Kufri Bahar, which required 211 kg N ha
experiments of Saluzzo et al. (1999), the agronomic efficiency (here defined as the yield
without N fertilisation/maximal yield) of Jaerli potatoes was lower than that of Spunta,
Huinkel and Mailén potatoes. Similarly, when four related cultivars, Bannock Russet,

−1 to yield 41(cid:2)7 t ha

Minerals, soils and roots

747

Gem Russet, Summit Russet and Russet Burbank, were grown with four N rates, 0, 100,
−1 using two different application timings, each of the four showed a
200 and 300 kg N ha
unique response (Love et al., 2005). Maximum yields and net returns for Bannock Russet
were achieved with relatively small N applications, but Gem Russet required a larger
application of N fertiliser for maximum returns and had a similar N requirement to Russet
Burbank. Differences between varieties in their tissue N concentrations can be illustrated
by data on petiole N concentrations in Russet Burbank and Shepody (Fig. 34.4) (Porter
and Sissons, 1993). Although petiole N concentrations declined through the growth period
in both varieties and responded to both the amount and the timing of N fertilisation,
absolute petiole N concentrations at a particular time point and N fertiliser treatment were
generally lower in Shepody (Porter and Sisson, 1993). Similarly, tissue N concentrations
differ among potato varieties grown under identical conditions.

34.3.2 Potassium

In general, potato is less efficient in acquiring and utilizing K fertiliser than many other
crops (Trehan and Claassen, 1998; Steingrobe and Claassen, 2000) and, as a consequence,

is fertilised heavily with K. Nevertheless, potato varieties do differ in their dry matter
accumulation when grown on low K soils, and there is, therefore, scope to reduce the
K-fertiliser requirement of commercial varieties (Trehan and Sharma, 2002; Elkhatib
et al., 2004; Moinuddin et al., 2004; Trehan et al., 2005). It is observed that varieties
yielding most on low K soils maintain higher shoot K concentrations and acquire K more
effectively by releasing more non-exchangeable K from the soil (Trehan and Sharma,
2002; Trehan et al., 2005). It is noteworthy that an increased ability to acquire K is not
attributed to an increase in root length, which is consistent with the high mobility of K
in the soil solution.

34.3.3 Phosphorus

Potato is less efficient than many crops in acquiring P and does not yield well on low P
soils (Sattelmacher et al., 1990b; White et al., 2005b). The yield of a particular variety on
soils with low P availability depends greatly on its maximum yield potential (Sattelmacher
et al., 1990b; Trehan and Sharma, 2005). Although potato varieties differ in their tissue
PUE (Dampney et al., 2002; Trehan and Sharma, 2003), which appears to correlate with
haulm longevity (White et al., 2005b), differences in their yield responses to P supply
are associated largely with differences in their P acquisition efficiency and correlate
with root growth parameters rather than with the phosphate uptake capacity of root cells
(Sattelmacher et al., 1990b; Trehan and Sharma, 2005). In addition, potato varieties with
greater P acquisition and yield on low P soils are better able to increase P availability in
soils (Trehan and Sharma, 2005).

Because phosphate is relatively immobile in the soil and is taken up effectively by
all parts of the potato root system, the P nutrition of the crop will be governed by the
volume of soil explored by the root system and the distribution of phosphate within
the soil profile. Thus, the development of a rapidly growing, extensive and deep root
system should improve P acquisition, plant growth and tuber yield. Consistent with this
hypothesis, simulation models indicate that P acquisition by a potato plant is dominated
by the morphological characteristics of its root system and the maximal rate of P uptake
by root cells (Dechassa et al., 2003), and field trials of 36 tuber-bearing Solanum species
have shown that tuber yield is significantly correlated with root dry weight (Sattelmacher
et al., 1990b). Incidentally, the root system of the potato displays a surface-foraging
phenotype (White et al., 2005b) that is considered to be most effective for the acquisition
of mineral elements located in the topsoil (White et al., 2005a).

Breeding strategies to improve the response in potato yield to P fertilisation might
focus on the development of varieties with the greatest vigour and root growth. Greater
root growth rates per se are likely to benefit early maturing (determinate) varieties, and
deeper rooting will benefit later maturing (indeterminate) varieties (White et al., 2005b).
Although commercial potato varieties show little variation in their maximal root growth
rates, the ultimate depth of rooting differs between varieties because the duration of root
growth varies and is particularly extended in indeterminate varieties (Allen and Scott,
1992; Stalham and Allen, 2001). For example, Cara, a variety with exceedingly long haulm
longevity, produces a deeper root system than the indeterminate varieties Maris Piper or
Hermes, which, in turn, have deeper root systems than the partially determinate varieties

Minerals, soils and roots

749

Estima or Wilja (Harris, 1992; Stalham and Allen, 2001). Morphological characteristics
also differ between commercial potato varieties. For example, King Edward produces
large numbers of fibrous roots, and Pentland Crown produces fewer thicker and longer
roots (Steckel and Gray, 1979). Thus, there is genetic potential for the selection or
breeding of genotypes with appropriate rooting phenotypes to exploit the soil volume and
acquire P more effectively.

34.4 SOIL CONDITIONS AND POTATO GROWTH

Crop yield is affected by many factors such as crop type, soil type, degree of compaction
and moisture status, drought and waterlogging. Rooting volume is the major factor,
because, as this increases, so will the ability of a plant to take up the water and both major
and minor mineral elements necessary for plant growth and tuber formation. Different
cultivars have different potential rooting volumes, but achievement of these is dependent
on the soil type and its physical condition. Soils can frequently become compacted because
of the use of heavy machinery and powered cultivation implements, particularly when
the soil is too wet, in an attempt to plant earlier and extend the growing season. During
such practices, the soil is sheared by compressive rather than brittle failure, causing a
smeared profile at the cultivation depth. Compaction reduces the number and size of
macropores and increases their tortuosity, consequently reducing the movements of air
and water through soil. An increase in soil bulk density restricts the rate of downward
and lateral extension of roots, so effectively reducing the volume of soil from which the
potato plant can acquire water and nutrients, resulting in a reduction in yield. A lighter
textured soil may not compact so readily, and so, the potato roots can extend more easily.
However, as these soils may hold less water, this increase in rooting volume may not
result in increased crop yields. Attempts to relieve the depression of plant yield caused by
compaction by sub-soiling below the plough depth are not always successful. Frequently,
the compaction occurs at a relatively shallow depth during seed-bed preparation, an
operation that has to occur after sub-soiling. Shallow compaction is frequently caused
by bed-tilling and de-stoning. As de-stoning is usually the rate-limiting step during seed-
bed preparation, it frequently occurs when conditions for cultivation are marginal. The
subsequent compaction, at about 30 cm in wet soil, will slow early root growth and
development. Soil compaction is a serious issue in potato cultivation, potentially causing
severe reductions in crop yield. Such losses are a result of the reduced efficiency in the
use of resources such as water and nutrients.

Soil compaction can also affect senescence in the potato crop. More rapid senescence
was reported in a deeply compacted soil (Van Loon and Bouma, 1978) than in a loose soil
as root growth had been restricted later in the season. However, Van Oijen et al. (1995)
reported that compaction did not significantly advance senescence but that senescence was
delayed because of the smaller number of leaves in the canopy and, consequently, less self-
shading. Such compaction effects on leaf development can cause significant reductions
in both tuber number and yield, together with other unwanted effects, such as secondary
growth cracking (Table 34.2) (Van Loon and Bouma, 1978; Stalham et al., 1997).

34.5 SUMMARY

Potatoes need at least 14 essential mineral elements. Six of these (K, N, P, Ca, Mg and
S) are required in large amounts and are often supplied as inorganic fertilisers. However,
although fertilisation with these elements may be necessary for adequate tuber yields,
there is concern that the use of fertilisers, especially those containing N, P and K, can
lead to environmental pollution. The N fertiliser requirement of the potato is similar to
that of many other field crops. However, the potato crop is fertilised heavily with K and
P, because potato plants acquire both P and K extremely inefficiently. For this reason,
agronomists are working to optimize the application of N, P and K fertilisers for uptake
by the crop, and plant breeders are searching for varieties that acquire and utilize these
elements more efficiently.

Agronomic strategies to optimize N and K fertilisation include the use of computer
models to inform the amount and timing of organic and inorganic fertilisation, whereas
recent strategies to optimize P fertilisation have focused on techniques for placing P
fertiliser close to the roots of the seed tuber. In addition, practices that increase rooting
depth and, thereby, the availability and acquisition of both major and minor mineral
elements are being promoted. Plant breeders are seeking to quantify the genetic diversity
and heritability of traits in potato impacting on mineral acquisition and utilization and
their effects on plant growth and tuber yield (Davenport et al., 2005; White et al., 2005b).
In tandem, knowledge of chromosomal loci that impact on the acquisition and utilization
of mineral elements could be used to develop molecular markers for use in breeding
programmes and/or to screen existing germplasm for mineral-efficient varieties. Such
chromosomal loci could be identified using genetic mapping populations of Solanum
tuberosum (Bradshaw et al., 2004) or of more distant interspecific crosses (Brouwer et al.,
2004). Alternatively, trait-to-genotype association mapping using germplasm collections
could be used (Simko, 2004). Indeed, it is already possible to genotype Solanum accessions
using markers for genes known to improve the acquisition and utilization of mineral
elements in other plant species (Vreugdenhil et al., 2005; Amtmann et al., 2006; Bucher
and Kossmann, 2007, Chapter 15, this volume) and to test for allelic associations with
the acquisition and utilization of mineral elements, plant growth and tuber yield. In the

Minerals, soils and roots

future, it is expected that the fertiliser requirements of the potato crop will be reduced
through both improved agronomy and the development of mineral-efficient genotypes.

35.1 INTRODUCTION

Models are not reality. Properly, they do not even represent reality. Rather, models
represent abstractions taken from reality. Their primary functions are to formalize our
knowledge of a subject in a manner that allows us to understand and quantify some
aspects of the system that we are studying, to test that understanding and hence make
inferences beyond our first studies and to show us where there are gaps in our knowledge.
A worked example is seen in MacKerron and Waister (1985) where gaps found in the
existing knowledge stimulated new experimental work to allow the generation of functions
necessary for the model and in MacKerron (1985) where among other things the model
was used to quantify the sensitivity of the potential yield of the crop to changes in the
timing of management operations. These points are among those considered by Sinclair
and Seligman (2000) in their debate on criteria for publishing papers on crop modelling.
As a bonus, models allow us also to communicate our understandings with others.

For the purposes of this chapter, I propose to dismiss or ignore all ‘models’ that are
based on a single statistical relation. An example of those could be one to estimate yield
as a single defined function of air temperature in June, solar radiation in June and solar
radiation in July. Such a ‘model’ has no explanatory powers and, quite simply, only
describes the data set from which it was derived. Further data from the same area in
further years would almost certainly not agree with the same statistical relation. I shall
not cite examples. Sinclair and Seligman (2000), in their article, give a more detailed
critique of types of growth models, whereas Karvonen et al. (2000) consider the role of
simulation and other modelling approaches in decision making.

The models that we will consider here treat the potato crop, its growth and develop-
ment and its interactions with its environment and with other organisms. Largely, they
are mechanistic. That is, they describe the operation of the system at one level of orga-
nization by providing an estimate of processes operating at a lower level (Haverkort and

MacKerron

MacKerron, 1995; Kabat et al., 1995b). No models attempt to describe the whole system
of the crop and all the influences on it, although some decision support systems (DSSs)
(cf. Chapter 36, Marshall, this volume) have been designed to draw on two or more
models within the one system to suggest responses of the crop to a wider range of input
variables than are normally treated by single models. Instead, mechanistic models are
usually designed to quantify a few specified output variables in terms of another specified
set of input variables that have appeared to be relevant to the modellers and, if done
properly, that have been shown experimentally to modify relevant processes towards the
output variables (Kabat et al., 1995b).

The boundaries between mathematical models and DSSs may be blurred and hard to
define, but for the purposes of this chapter, we will restrict ourselves to simulation models
that take a maximum of two classes of inputs to describe the behaviour of the crop:
e.g. environmental factors and management decisions or management decisions and eco-
nomic variables. A mathematical system that handles three or more such sets of variables
will be considered a DSS and will be considered in Chapter 36 (Marshall, this volume).

35.2 AIMS AND APPROACHES

The aims of simulation models of the type being considered here are to simulate and explain
crop development and behaviour, yield and quality as functions of environmental and man-
agement conditions or disease pressure or (possibly) of genetic variation. Then, if the values
of the variables are known, output variables of the model – e.g. yield (e.g. Fishman et al.,
1985; Jefferies and Heilbronn, 1991; Kooman, 1995), quality (e.g. Jefferies and Heilbronn,
1991; Hertog et al., 1997a,b) or risk of disease (e.g. Spitters and Ward, 1988; Phillips et al.,
1998; Elliott et al., 2004) – may be estimated rather than measured. The important point in
that declaration is ‘to explain’. By ‘explain’, I mean to provide a description of the opera-
tion at one level of organization through the quantification of operations at another lower
level. If the design and parameterization of the model are successful, then it may be used to
analyse certain questions and provide answers, on a specific crop in the field, for example.
What constitutes a successful design will be considered later.

Several different approaches have been taken since the 1960s on how best to tackle the
simulation of aspects of the crop. Most crop modelling within that time has been what
I will call ‘definitive’ – that is, one set of values for the input variables produces one
answer for each of the output variables. These models do not offer estimates of natural
variation or of sampling error, and most of those to be considered in this chapter are of
that nature. More recently developed kinds of models are able to deal specifically with
uncertain values in both the input and the output variables. Examples include rule-based
models with flexible querying and causal models based on Bayesian probability theory
(e.g. Gu et al., 1994, 1996; Marshall et al., 1995). Problems inherent in this latter style
of model include how to assemble a chain of uncertain processes in a way that avoids
unlikely outcomes and how to present answers in a style that is meaningful to others
than scientists engaged in the same exercise. To inform a grower or an agronomist that
a particular well-grown crop has a 50% chance of exceeding 60 t/ha, a 75% chance
of exceeding 50 t/ha and a 95% chance of exceeding 40 t/ha is to invite the response,

Mathematical models of plant growth and development

755

‘I could have told you that myself!’. For these reasons, it is likely that developments in
those kinds of models will be targeted towards economists and policy makers rather than
growers (e.g. Schans, 1991; Abbaspour et al., 1992; Abbaspour, 1994). These models
will not be discussed further.

Another basic division in approach to modelling is between what can be called
‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ approaches. Within these subdivisions, approaches can be
classified as ‘source-driven’ or ‘sink-based’.

35.2.1 Top-down/bottom-up

Some of the earliest mechanistic models of crop behaviour were of the bottom-up kind:
for example, those of De Wit (1965) in which understandings of photosynthesis and of
canopy structure, each at the organizational level of the leaf, were tested by aggregating
and organizing that knowledge to simulate the behaviour of a canopy of leaves and hence
the level of production in their canopy. Given the underlying generality of photosynthesis,
it can be difficult to introduce meaningful factors that constrain the next level of the
system to reflect differences between species, let alone cultivars. However, an early
example of modelling the production of potatoes was provided by Rijtema and Endrödi
(1970) based on the work of De Wit (1965), coupled with some necessary but notably
arbitrary assumptions such as those on diffusive resistances and that the respiration rate is
25% of the production rate. Some time later, the development of a universal mechanistic
model applicable across many species of crop was still the aim of some workers, e.g. Van
Keulen and Wolf (1986) and Spitters et al. (1989).

A more recent development of a bottom-up model was developed by Fishman et al.
(1984, 1985, 1995), in which the basic process is the photosynthesis of individual leaves
as a function of the intensity of photosynthetically active radiation. However, the levels of
organization that need to be climbed impose unrealistic demands on the user of this model.
For example, this model does not use even daily totals of radiation but requires daily
integration of hourly calculations of the rate of photosynthesis per unit ground area for
each of 10 layers. Furthermore, to derive daily dry matter production from photosynthesis,
the model has embedded in it several functions that are not readily assessed independently
to estimate the effects of temperature, respiration, water stress and nitrogen supply on
reducing the contribution from photosynthesis (Fishman et al., 1995). The performance
of potato crops growing in three fields in the spring season was used to ‘calibrate’ the
parameters in the model. The model was then ‘verified’ fairly successfully against an
autumn-sown crop in the same area.

For models intended to produce values for output variables at the upper level of orga-
nization, plant population or field, it has generally been more productive to take the
top-down approach. Then, the modeller, knowing the target level for his/her answers, has
the task of identifying the important variables within the system that is to be studied and
what factors modify these from a lower level. For example, Spitters and colleagues devel-
oped a model to analyse variation in yield between cultivars in terms of differences in light
absorption and use and dry matter partitioning (Spitters, 1987; Spitters and Schapendonk,
1990), whereas MacKerron and colleagues did the same for potential yields as functions
of management operations – planting dates and depths and times of harvesting – and

756

MacKerron

standard measurements of weather variables (MacKerron, 1985; MacKerron and Waister,
1985) with the important design criterion that all the input variables should be readily
available. If such models are then successful, then they may be developed for further appli-
cations by addition of further relations. So, Kooman (1995) and Kooman and Haverkort
(1995) developed the model of Spitters (1987) by the addition of relations between tuber-
ization and both day length and temperature. Jefferies and Heilbronn (1991) developed
MacKerron and Waister’s model (1985) by redefining canopy expansion to permit the
inclusion of new experimentally derived functions describing the effect of constraints in
water supply on leaf expansion. Other functions newly derived from experimental data
were also included to improve the generality of the model (Jefferies et al., 1991).

35.2.2 Source-driven/sink-based

The subdivision between source-driven and sink-based models is not always clear-cut.
(Source-driven implies that the more of a resource is captured the faster the growth rate,
whereas sink-based suggests that growth will be determined by the rate at which the plant
can use the resources that are potentially available.) Some models may be source-driven,
essentially, and yet include one or more sink-based functions or, more confusingly, some
may include functions that become sink-based as the simulated crop develops. In these
circumstances, it is better to examine critically the balance between source and sink and
the simulations of them. It is not part of the purpose of this chapter to offer a firm
conclusion on what is the correct balance. Rather, it is the intention to draw attention to
the question and to encourage readers to be aware of the inherent problems and to come
to an informed opinion on what is appropriate in each circumstance.

For example, some models simulate leaf expansion as a function of assimilate supply
and specific leaf area (SLA, the amount of leaf area per unit leaf biomass) (De Wit et al.,
1970; Van Keulen and Seligman, 1987). Other models use functions of temperature to
determine leaf expansion in early season then limit leaf area expansion by assimilate
supply (i.e. radiation interception) and a function of SLA, later in the growing season,
e.g. Spitters et al. (1989). So, Van Delden et al. (2001) examined the sensitivity of the
timing or developmental stage of switching between temperature and radiation as the
limitation to leaf expansion. For two data sets on potato, each based on one site, 2 years
and two cultivars in each year, they found the leaf area index (LAI) at which the switch
was best introduced (Ls) to be 0.26 and 1.41. The disparity between these numbers
suggests that the variation in Ls would need to be explored further if that approach were
to be generally adopted.

In the model of Spitters and Schapendonk (1990), incident solar radiation is conditioned
by fractional interception and efficiency, which then drives the increase in dry matter.
Some of that dry matter is partitioned into leaves, and so, through an estimate of SLA,
conditions the estimated leaf area, which in turn influences fractional interception of
radiation. This does indeed reflect one’s understanding of crop growth, but the process, if
not circular, is certainly helical so that if, say, some intermediate functions give a wrong
answer at an earlier time in the season, then the answers will be wrong later even if these
functions are correct later. That is, the rate of assimilation now is heavily dependent on
the rate of assimilation then.

Mathematical models of plant growth and development

757

Models that drive canopy expansion using assimilate can be contrasted with models
that treat leaf expansion as being independent of assimilate supply – that is, they assume
that assimilate supply is ample for the purposes of leaf expansion, at least until canopy
closure – and drive canopy expansion by functions of temperature (MacKerron, 1985)
or temperature and water supply (Jefferies and Heilbronn, 1991; MacKerron and Lewis,
1995; Rijneveld, 1997). A characteristic of this class of model is that it is entirely
independent of assumptions about SLA, which is recognized to be a most variable ratio,
differing within the plant at any one time between younger and older leaves, being
influenced by the radiation environment and being highly sensitive to water status.

In Kooman’s model (Kooman, 1995; Kooman and Haverkort, 1995), there is a clearly
defined progression after tuber initiation in which tuber growth shifts from being sink-
limited, taking a small proportion of daily assimilate production, to being source-limited,
taking all the daily assimilate production. The progression caused by this device is
sensitive to the differing degrees of sink strength attributed to biomass in leaf and tuber.
The shift away from the leaves in partitioning assimilate provides a rational means to
simulate the death of the leaf canopy in the later stages of crop growth.

35.3 APPLICATIONS

The most commonly modelled processes are the growth and the development of the crop.
This is not only because the final outputs are of considerable economic importance but
also because such a model may often offer a basis on which to develop the simulation of
other effects or constraints such as the effects of pests and diseases or of a wider range
of environmental factors such as CO2 concentration, (cid:3)CO2(cid:4), or nutrient supply.

In almost all models of growth and development, growth is driven by intercepted solar
radiation. However, in some models derived in lower latitudes – e.g. Sands et al. (1979)
in Australia and Ingram and McCloud (1984) in Florida – solar radiation plays a less
important role than temperature. Perhaps, this is because at the higher levels of insolation
experienced at these latitudes, the canopy of a potato crop becomes light saturated (Sale,
1974) while high temperatures may be a serious constraint.

Among top-down models, the relation between biomass and intercepted radiation is
taken generally as the principal function driving growth. There have been occasional
questions posed as to the validity of using these relations, e.g. Demetriades-Shah et al.
(1992), but most criticisms of the principle were answered by Monteith (1994). That still
leaves the condition that the values used in the relation between intercepted solar radiation
and biomass should be properly determined with due regard to errors of measurement.

35.3.1 Potential yields

A significant proportion of the models of growth and yield have begun as models of
potential yield. That is, they began by assuming that the crops are free of pests and
diseases and that mineral nutrition is adequate for growth (Ng and Loomis, 1979; Van
der Zaag, 1984). Some even assume that water supply is non-limiting (MacKerron and
Waister, 1985). These are seen as areas of potential development of the model. However,

758

MacKerron

models of potential yield should not be seen simply as drafts for later more detailed
models. They have their own uses.

An early and significant model of the growth of the potato crop was produced by Ng
and Loomis (1979, 1984) in which they set out clear objectives for their study. Their
model included representations of a wide range of influences and responses from the
basic effects of radiation and temperature on photosynthesis to the ‘feed-forward’ effects
of the mother tuber and the ‘feedback’ effects of age on capacity for growth and of
senescence, initiation of branches and the growth of fibrous roots. Ng and Loomis clearly
declared most of the physiological relations that they used as ‘physiological opinions’
and recognized that their model comprises ‘a large set of hypotheses’. Many were derived
from the literature and others from a field experiment. They were clear also that they were
unable to give a true validation of their model, as the data used in the model and those
from the field experiment were not completely independent. Their model was successful,
however, in that it advanced the understanding of integrative crop physiology and offered
a tool to study the action of environmental variables on the crop.

In complete contrast, Van der Zaag (1984) presented an extremely simple model for
the estimation of potential yields based on solar radiation and length of growing season
to estimate potential tuber yield at various locations throughout the world. That, too, had
a useful role in focusing the attention of others on differences in potential yields and in
actual yields and between these two at various locations across the world.

A weakness of the model of Ng and Loomis (1979) is that, in trying to be ‘explanatory’
and to have a ‘high degree of physiological and morphological detail’, it incorporated so
many variables and tried to simulate too much. Many subsequent models have been set
similar targets but with tighter boundaries on the domain within which they apply. The
key to the top-down approach is not to ask ‘What else do we know about?’ but rather ‘Is
there anything else we need to include?’

A successful model of potential yield does not provide an ‘airy-fairy’ estimate of yield
but one which the best of crops in a locality will approximate to (MacKerron, 1985;
Kunkel and Campbell, 1987). MacKerron (1985) took the opportunity presented by a
local competition organized by growers in Angus, Scotland, and test-dug by staff of the
Scottish Agricultural College to assess the comparison between achieved yields in the
best crops and the potential yield calculated for each of them. The four best crops, in
order, achieved 102, 101, 94 and 85% of the calculated potential yields, respectively. The
four achieved yields ranged from 80 to 64 t/ha at a time when the average UK yield of
potatoes was in the order of 40 t/ha.

Kunkel and Campbell (1987) examined achieved yields from 134 field plots from
experiments performed in the Columbia Basin, Washington, over 15 years from 1959
through 1973 and, recognizing that most plots had not given potential yields, used Webb’s
(1972) ‘Boundary Line’ method to indicate the progress of potential yields with time from
planting in the relevant years. They considered a number of models for the estimation of
potential yields and were best satisfied with the relatively simple model of MacKerron
and Waister (1985). They also reported that Van der Zaag’s (1984) estimate of 140 t/ha
potential yield had been confirmed by the models and that actual yields close to that
figure had been achieved. This emphasizes that models do not need to be complex. What
is needed in a model will depend on the task in hand.

Mathematical models of plant growth and development

759

35.3.2 Actual yields

The principal difference between a model of potential yield and a model of actual yields
is that the modeller has included certain constraints on the growth and development of
the crop. The purpose of such developments has to be that the modeller is looking to
provide answers that better reflect actual experience more often. The most widely treated
constraint is water supply. There are, of course, a wide range of models for which the sole
purpose is scheduling irrigation. These may require values for crop-specific parameters
and for crop cover, but these will not be considered in this chapter. Rather, we will
consider those models where it is the crop that is of primary importance.

35.3.2.1 Effects of water supply/water use/water stress/irrigation

The interest in the influence of water supply on growth and development in potatoes can
be subdivided broadly into two categories. First, there are attempts to answer the question
of how the crop will grow in a field soil under rain-fed conditions and then there is the
question of which thresholds need to be avoided, using irrigation if necessary, if growth
and development are not to fall substantially below their potential rates.

Campbell et al. (1976) developed a model of water flow, from soil to plant, to determine
an optimal soil water potential to maximize potato growth. The factors that they included
as variables were transpiration, leaf osmotic potential, root density and distribution and
the hydraulic conductivity of the soil. Their model was developed using growth chamber
experiments and then tested against measurements in field-grown plants. A characteristic
to be noted from the model is that the plant water potential at which transpiration is first
reduced is not constant but is dependent on soil hydraulic properties, transpiration rate and
several plant properties including rooting density. Although the model produced a fairly
adequate description of plant water potential during the day and described the maximum
transpiration rates that could be sustained as a function of soil water potential, the nature
of other plant variables that needed to be defined possibly limited its value. An additional
problem recognized by the authors is that the growth of the crop may not be limited by
stomatal closure but by turgor (Hsiao, 1973). Jefferies (1989) showed that even under
relatively low evaporative conditions, differences in leaf extension rates were detectable
with soil moisture deficits (SMD) as low as 16 mm, and the reductions increased rapidly
with SMD to a minimum when SMD equalled 77 mm. These changes corresponded to
reductions in turgor. In contrast, the conversion coefficient for intercepted radiation into
dry matter (arguably a function of stomatal aperture) was unaffected by SMD less than
47 mm (Jefferies and MacKerron, 1989).

When simulating the growth of potatoes under a constraint such as water supply, an
important advantage of the top-down models becomes apparent – that there are fewer
relations to be modified. However, an adequate treatment of the problem may necessi-
tate invoking another lower level of organization. So, MacKerron and Waister (1985)
simulated the development of LAI, but in addressing the problem of water as a con-
straint on growth, Jefferies and Heilbronn (1991) had to recognize that the stress could

760

MacKerron

be imposed and relieved at various times and that increases in leaf area did not occur
proportionately over all the existing leaf area. Rather, individual leaves appear, grow and
stop growing; other leaves grow in their turn. Therefore, the simulation of the depen-
dence of canopy expansion on water supply had to treat the growth of individual leaves
in turn. A leaf that has matured before water stress is imposed is unaffected. A leaf
that has matured during a period of water stress is not available for further growth.
Jefferies and Heilbronn (1991) therefore related the extension of individual leaves to
thermal time constrained by the level of available soil water. Among the criticisms of
that model are that root growth is not simulated, maximum root depth is defined, and
potentially, all the plant-available water in that depth of soil is available from the start
of growth. Another is that by including a constant water-use efficiency term, normalized
for vapour pressure deficit, dry matter production and water use were firmly coupled
together (Jefferies et al., 1991). There are many sources of information supporting the
relation between these two variables, but the relation is not constant and varies with
site and season. Separate estimation of evaporation by a ‘Penman’-type approach would
have avoided that feature but only at the price of added constants, crop coefficients and
meteorological data.

In later developments of that model (MacKerron and Lewis, 1995; Rijneveld, 1997),
potential evaporation was included as an input variable to the model to avoid the problem
yet minimize the number of inputs.

Others have found it necessary to take equivalent approaches. So, Kooman and Spitters
(1995) for example noted that in their model with differing levels of complexity, the
simpler version was the best for estimating potential yield, but where water supply was
a factor, the more complex version was needed.

All the models presented in the book by Kabat et al. (1995b) treated potato growth
as potential constrained by water supply (De Koning et al., 1995; Fishman et al., 1995;
Jefferies and Heilbronn, 1995; Karvonen and Kleemola, 1995; Kooman and Spitters,
1995; Ritchie et al., 1995; Roth et al., 1995; Van den Broek and Kabat, 1995). Fortunately,
the comparisons and evaluations were made most thoroughly by Kabat et al. (1995a).
In conclusion, they noted that crop simulation models are critically dependent on the
procedures defining partitioning of carbon and its redistribution during senescence. They
noted the particular sensitivity of models where the relative sink sizes of different plant
organs are used to quantify coefficients. They doubted the utility of most models beyond
the environments for which they had been calibrated. Kabat et al. (1995a) not only
considered that the understanding of potato crop development had reached the stage
where yields limited by temperature and radiation alone can be estimated with reasonable
confidence but also considered that proper simulation of the effects of changing water
supply needed better handling.

Unusually, Hamer et al. (1994) modelled the development of the potato crop as a means
to simulate water use by the crop. Tuber growth and yield were not a consideration. In
particular, root growth was calculated in a simple manner and the soil moisture volume
fraction at four levels of matric potential (5, 40, 200 and 1500 kPa) were used as inputs
to the model. Tested against data from four widely separated sites in the UK, a regression
between observed and measured values of soil moisture data accounted for 94% of the
variance in the data.

Other efforts to take account of the growth of roots will be in Section 35.3.3.

35.3.2.2 The effects of nitrogen and the combined effects of water and nitrogen

The nitrogen requirement of a potato crop depends on many factors. One group of these
affects the rate of nitrogen uptake and the total nitrogen uptake by a potato crop. A second
group affects the supply of nitrogen to the crop from the soil. Among the latter group,
the effects of previous cropping and manuring can be very variable, and so, fertilizer
recommendations ought to be field specific. Attempts to develop simulation models (and
DSSs) have been handicapped by that variability, and, at the practical level, there have
been strong arguments for measurements to be made both before and during crop growth
to guide the use of nitrogen fertilizer. Yet, these very difficulties have continued to drive
a perceived need for simulation modelling or DSSs that will be capable of giving realistic
and timely advice.

Greenwood et al. (1985b) produced a model said to be ‘dynamic’ and for ‘practical
purposes rather than understanding’ of the response of potatoes to nitrogen fertilizer.
Although the description of the nitrogen uptake may have been dynamic and although the
model formalized the data collected from 11 experiments (Greenwood et al. 1985a) and
served to explain the response of the crops to nitrogen, the simulation of the underlying
growth of the potato crop was not even semi-mechanistic but was driven by a standard
daily increment. That feature implies that without ‘calibration’ (see Section 35.4.2), the
model cannot be expected to be transportable much beyond the originating data. Neeteson
et al. (1987) did extend the work by testing the model against 61 experiments on nitrogen
fertilizer with potatoes, but there were 99 such experiments in total and those with yields
of less than 55 t/ha were excluded from the study.

In the comparative exercise led by Kabat et al. (1995b), only two models, CROPWATN
(Karvonen and Kleemola, 1995) and SUBSTOR (Ritchie et al., 1995), were applied to
the question of the effects of differing levels of nitrogen supply.

In the model of Karvonen and Kleemola (1995), special attention was paid to combining
physically based sub-models of soil water balance and soil nitrogen balance with the sub-
models of crop growth and crop nitrogen. Being clearly described, the model offers a good
example of how complexity develops as functions are added to a model. Transpiration is
computed following the Penman–Monteith equation, and potential evapotranspiration and
evaporation from soil are calculated following Feddes et al. (1978) and Jensen (1983).
In the soil nitrogen balance sub-model, the uptake of nitrogen by plant roots not only
follows the method of Van Keulen and Seligman (1987) but also includes procedures
for transport of mineral nitrogen and the fates of mineral fertilizers. The sub-model on
potential crop production requires the computation of daily leaf net assimilation after
Goudriaan (1986), which is then integrated over the canopy, adjusted for conversion
from CO2 to glucose, modified for maintenance respiration, partitioned between sinks
and further modified for leaf senescence (Spitters, 1986; Spitters et al., 1986). The sub-
model on nitrogen balance in the crop uses the method of Van Keulen and Seligman
(1987), but that is a model of growth of a crop of spring wheat. The greatest difficulties
were met in predicting the development of LAI as SLA differs under both water and
nitrogen stresses. There were also similar problems of partitioning between root and
shoot.

35.3.2.3 Effects of day length

In the model of Sands et al. (1979), developed under Australian conditions, solar radiation
and day length were inputs for only the first 3 weeks after emergence. Thereafter, tuber
bulking was driven by temperature. However, that model did not transfer to the higher,
European, latitudes because the physiological time to the start of tuber growth was ‘an
unbounded function of day length’. Regel and Sands (1983) then modified the model
to accommodate what they called early and late tuberization so that the start of tuber
growth was independent of day length while it was less than 14.1 hours for cultivar
Russet Burbank and 15.1 hours for cultivar Kennebec. However, in neither version of the
model was day length an explanatory variable. Rather, it was adjusted to set the bounds
for numerical summation.

Possibly, the first versions of a model to treat day length as an input variable were
those of Kooman (1995) and Kooman and Haverkort (1995) in which partitioning of
assimilate to the foliage is a function of day length and temperature until tuber initiation.
Tuber growth rate is independent of day length in this model, but it was used as input to
a function describing development rate until tuber initiation. Once the simulation of tuber
growth has started, the partitioning of dry matter is determined by the demand from the
tubers – sink determined – and only the balance of assimilate is available for the growth
of the foliage. Once the tuber growth rate matches the daily assimilation rate, foliage
growth is stopped.

That approach (Kooman, 1995) where day length influences development rather than
growth directly and so influences a progressive transition between phases of crop growth
is almost certainly a better one than that of the earlier model. Certainly, its developers
have gone on to apply it and its developments to several applications for which timing
of tuber initiation and length of the period for tuber growth are critical (Haverkort and
Kooman, 1997; Haverkort and Grashoff, 2004).

35.3.2.4 Effects of CO2 concentrations
In a comparatively early study of the effects of elevated (cid:3)CO2(cid:4) Yandell et al. (1988)
conducted to establish what might be achievable in space systems, response surfaces for
tuber weight were fitted as functions of temperature and (cid:3)CO2(cid:4) and simulation studies
were promised but do not seem to have been realized.

Van de Geijn and Dijkstra (1995) discussed the expected changes of increased pho-
tosynthetic rates, partially offset by lower stomatal conductance, and the many feedback
systems in the soil–plant–atmosphere system. Schapendonk et al. (1995) assembled a
mechanistic model from several sources including a biochemical model of photosynthesis
described by Farquhar et al. (1980) and presented simulations of some effects of (cid:3)CO2(cid:4).
However, their experimental data, which both fed and tested the model, were all derived
from crops grown under the ambient (cid:3)CO2(cid:4) of 1988. It follows that none of the develop-
mental processes, e.g. partitioning to tubers and the progress of dry matter concentration
following the conversion of sugars to starch, could have been tested.

The simpler of the top-down models in which dry matter accumulation is driven by
experimentally derived relations between biomass and intercepted radiation (e.g. Jefferies
and Heilbronn, 1991; Kooman, 1995) are unable to be applied to the question of the

Mathematical models of plant growth and development

763

effects of elevated (cid:3)CO2(cid:4) on the growth of the potato. Or, at least, it is not valid to
do so as the necessary underlying experimental information for their primary driver
is lacking. However, Schapendonk et al. (2000) devised a modification to the light
conversion coefficient (LCC) that is central to this type of model. The validity of the
device remains to be seen. On the contrary, bottom-up models driven by photosynthetic
rates, e.g. Schapendonk et al. (1995), do not have that limitation and there is quite
extensive experimental evidence available of the effect of (cid:3)CO2(cid:4) on photosynthetic rates.
A serious finding of recent studies of photosynthesis in crops introduced to sustained
elevated (cid:3)CO2(cid:4) is that although the saturated rate of photosynthesis is initially increased,
it later declines or acclimatizes until it is near to the rate achieved under current ambient
conditions. That change is associated with reductions in stomatal conductance. These
observations suggest that neither kind of simulation model is yet suited to addressing the
questions raised by an increasing ambient (cid:3)CO2(cid:4). What are needed are quantities of good,
reproducible experimental data (cf. Chapter 19, De Temmerman et al., this volume).

Even if the problem of quantifying the primary driver of growth at consistently elevated
(cid:3)CO2(cid:4) were to be solved, the problem of assembling an adequate mechanistic model of
growth would not have been solved, as such evidence as is available at present suggests
that there may be changes in a whole range of developmental functions and stages.
For example, leaves may be more dense, SLA may be lower, and partitioning may be
modified. Any model intended to analyse the questions posed by rising (cid:3)CO2(cid:4) will need
to incorporate modified developmental functions of the kind that are currently being
established (cf. Chapter 19, De Temmerman et al., this volume).

35.3.3 Outstanding difficulties and inadequacies – root growth

The growth of roots presents growth modellers with an apparently intractable problem.
Sampling roots is tedious, and when done, generally, it has not been coupled with other
extensive measurements that might facilitate establishment of relations between their
growth and environmental factors. For example, there have been only a few attempts
to couple observations of root growth with progressive changes in soil water profiles
observed using neutron probes or other instruments making equivalent measurements
(Durant et al., 1973; Belmans et al., 1982).

Many modellers, from Ng and Loomis (1979) onwards, have sought to simulate root
mass (Fishman et al., 1995; Kooman and Spitters, 1995). But one should ask why. How
can the mass of roots be derived and what is to be done with that figure once it has been
estimated? Some years later, Kooman (1995) agreed with this point, stating (p. 102) that
the model Lintul-Potato did not take into account root biomass, as precise measurements
of roots in field experiments are rare. In models that work up from photosynthesis, it may
be acceptable to assign a share of the net assimilates to root growth (e.g. Dewar, 1993)
but how big a share? Generally, there is little or no good field data on partitioning that
include mass of root. In those models that estimate the net dry matter production by a
simple relation between biomass and intercepted radiation, there is an even more basic
question to be asked. One ought to ask how the conversion coefficient from intercepted
radiation to biomass was determined. Almost certainly, the observations of biomass
did not include good quality estimates of root biomass. If one returns to the original

764

MacKerron

experimental investigations that gave rise to these relations, then one will find that if
root growth was measured in any of them, they are the exception (e.g. the data used by
MacKerron and Waister, 1985, to derive their LCC did not include root mass, nor did
the data set of Allen and Scott, 1980). Some may have included estimates of the roots
lifted from within the soil ridge, but few if any have seriously extracted roots throughout
the rooting profile. Then, the coefficient used does not include the production that went
into the root biomass, and the estimate of biomass in these cases is ‘biomass without
roots’. To ‘adjust’ the value of the light use efficiency or conversion coefficient to give
a slightly higher biomass production that can then be diverted to root biomass is at best
self-deceiving. In such models, the practice of assigning a proportion of assimilate to root
production is quite invalid.

Presuming that an appropriate value of LCC could be found, the problems of speculative
partitioning between shoot, root and tubers (MacKerron and Peng, 1989, showed that
dry mass of roots could vary between 3 and 17% of the total), converting total root dry
matter into length (specific root weight and length are not constants; Allmaras et al.,
1975; Jefferies, 1993), and of distributing it in the soil remain.

Roots do not function in proportion to their mass (contrary to the assumption in
Fishman et al., 1995; and in Kooman and Spitters, 1995) but in proportion to their length
(Tinker, 1976). When trying to quantify the uptake function of roots, it is not wise even
to try to estimate the length of roots from the (estimate of) root biomass, as the greater
length of roots is in fine roots that represent an almost insignificant fraction of the whole
root biomass. The important feature of a root system is its absorptive surface area. Often,
the total length of root is used as a surrogate for surface area (Hillel and Talpaz, 1976;
Taylor and Klepper, 1978), and this appears to be satisfactory for those plants, such as
potato, that do not have tapering roots (Hamza and Aylmore, 1992). So, the question
that should be addressed is ‘What length of roots is being produced and where?’ Van
den Broek and Kabat (1995) estimated depth of rooting as a function of time, following
Van Wijk and Feddes (1986), whereas Karvonen and Kleemola (1995) avoided the need
to estimate the quantity of roots. An approach that avoids the problems of attributing
biomass to the roots is to simulate root length directly from estimates of numbers of roots
initiated and of root extension rates (Hackett and Rose, 1972) and death rates (Hillel and
Talpaz, 1976). This is the approach taken by MacKerron and Lewis (1995). Monteith
(1986) used root length density (cm of root per cm3 of soil) to estimate the rate at which
a growing root system could extract water from soil. Following Gregory et al. (1978a,b)
and Gregory and Squire (1979), Monteith assumed that root growth was limited to an
advancing front and that there was little change in the root length at a given depth once
that front had moved deeper. (Strictly, these observations were made on cereal crops.)

In the potato crop, a few authors have reported the development of the root system at
only a few stages through the season, determined by sequential sampling (Lesczynski and
Tanner, 1976; Vos and Groenwold, 1986). Parker et al. (1989, 1991) used minirhizotrons
to observe rooting depth on as many as 11 occasions in a growing season. In their
experiments, potato roots extended continuously until the end of July, more than 100
days after planting.

The questions of what lengths of roots were in the soil and when do they get there
were among the questions addressed by MacKerron and Lewis (1995) who divorced root

Mathematical models of plant growth and development

765

growth from assimilate production and, instead, calculated root length densities from
number of roots per stem internode below ground (each stem is rooted independently)
and from root extension calculated as a function of soil temperature. They considered the
root and soil moisture profiles to be distributed over 10 horizons in the soil, the upper
two being in the ridge.

Two limitations were imposed on root extension (MacKerron and Lewis, 1995;
Rijneveld, 1997). One was designed to produce a profile of root length density that
declines linearly with depth from a maximum in the ridge (Vos and Groenwold, 1986;
Parker et al., 1989) to a limiting potential root depth. (Feddes and Rijtema (1972) used an
exponential function to describe the change in root length density with depth, although
they found evidence of a change to a linear pattern with prolonged drought. Van Bavel
and Ahmed (1976) used a linear distribution.) That was achieved (Rijneveld, 1997) by
arbitrarily starting the death of individual, randomly selected roots from 55 days after
emergence (Vos and Groenwold, 1986). These devices (rather than refinements) did not,
of course, allow for the effects of compaction and differing soil strengths (Feddes et al.,
1988), but root extension was prevented below a moisture volume fraction of 0.15 (Sharp
and Davies, 1985; Wraith and Baker, 1991).

35.3.4 Ideotyping

The term ‘ideotype’ is used to label the set of characteristics that would seem best to
suit an organism to its environment. Simulation models are often seen by modellers as a
good means to identify ideotypes for particular environments, although Ng and Loomis
(1979) perceived models as being simply ‘an aid in genotype evaluations’. It must be
said that plant breeders seem to be less enthusiastic about the idea, perhaps because
there is generally no direct link between the characteristics identified as parameters in a
mechanistic model and particular genes that might be selected in a breeding programme.
But the advocates of modelling argue that their systems offer a cheaper means of testing
that changes, in which characteristics might be used to achieve a particular end than
simply conducting a multiplicity of field trials.

So, for example, Spitters and Schapendonk (1990) addressed the question of the
influences of both sustained water stress and a short-duration water stress imposed at
differing times, and they did this for differing maturity classes of potato cultivar. Certainly,
the amount of experimental work that would have been entailed actually to conduct these
studies experimentally would have been enormous, and it would have been difficult, too,
to impose such carefully defined water stresses. However, their results ‘emphasised the
complexity of selection for drought tolerance’. They found that the simulated reduction
in yield from water stress could be lessened when growth was averaged over the whole
season and that the optimal strategy to cope with drought stress varies with timing and
severity of the stress. Their discussion concluded that crop simulations were necessary
for the analysis of breeding strategies for drought tolerance.

On the contrary, Van der Zaag and Doornbos (1987) tried to explain differences
in the ability of several potato cultivars to yield in terms of their ability to intercept
light, to convert that energy into dry matter, and their harvest indices. Their work was
experimental, done in both the Netherlands and Israel, and the authors found differences

766

MacKerron

in light interception and in LCC that were statistically significant for both cultivar and
place, and the interactions were non-significant, suggesting consistent characteristics of
the cultivars. As the authors recognized in their introduction to the work, ‘It is evident
that late cultivars, with a longer duration of leaf area, intercept more light (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ’.

Neither ‘physiological’ approach seems to have identified characters that a breeder

might want to be able to use in a screening programme.

Jefferies (1993), using the model of Jefferies and Heilbronn (1991), considered three
strategies for achieving improved drought resistance: improving water supply, improving
leaf growth and improving photosynthetic performance. He concluded that the greatest
effect on tuber yield was to improve the relation between leaf expansion rate and soil
moisture status. Rather than invoking potato breeding as a motivation for that study,
Jefferies argued that physiological studies should concentrate on examining the basis
underlying the ability to maintain leaf growth in the face of drought.

An idea of the value of modelling from the breeder’s viewpoint was provided by
Ellissèche and Hoogendoorn (1995) who discussed limitations on the use of models in
breeding programmes but foresaw their usefulness in a number of categories of problem
including durability of types of resistance to plant pests and diseases.

A wider application of modelling to defining ideotypes was made by Haverkort and
Kooman (1997) when they applied their model to the estimation of yields of a standard
potato genotype to a wide range of conditions of temperature and day length. They
examined how yield defining, limiting and reducing factors influence the genotypically
determined the length of the growth cycle and then estimated the optimum times of tuber
initiation for potatoes being grown in such conditions. This application of modelling has
been developed further (Haverkort and Grashoff, 2004) to incorporate a wider range of
‘physiological opinions’ to allow the more detailed characterization of the ‘ideal’ cultivar
for a particular environment. The flexible nature of the model in this latest development
poses some risks: values of parameters can be selected that are, potentially, mutually
incompatible, and parameters may be included or required that are not relevant to the
problem in hand. There is, therefore, a serious need for the model to be tested against a
wider range of real crops.

35.3.5 Forecasting

One of the potential strengths of the semi-mechanistic model is the possibility of using it
as a tool for prediction. There are many classes of forecast that can be addressed by such
modelling. Some will operate over only a few days or hours, as for disease forecasting, or
over a whole growing season as for estimates of fertilizer requirements. Other systems lend
themselves to frequent updating and correction of the forecast, e.g. irrigation scheduling.
Still others result in once-in-a-season decisions such as the choice of an appropriate seed
rate. The position of a set of possible applications was outlined by MacKerron et al. (1990)
when the topics of seed rates, yield, nitrogen requirement, pests and diseases were explored
as potential applications of models in forecasts. Several of these topics have since been
the subject of DSSs as mentioned briefly in this sub-section and more fully in Chapter 36.
The possibility of forecasting yields has, itself, three sets of application with very
different possibilities for inputs and requirements for outputs. First, semi-mechanistic

Mathematical models of plant growth and development

767

models can be used to forecast the likely yield from a single crop in the current year
(MacKerron et al., 2004). Second, they can be used to provide estimates of regional yields
in the current year (Heilbronn and MacKerron, 1989; MacKerron et al., 1990; MacKerron,
1992) to provide market information. Third, they can be used in an exploratory manner
to provide estimates of likely yields in other regions and with several putative starts to
the growing season (Haverkort, 1986; Haverkort et al., 2004). The inputs to each of these
applications are necessarily different.

In forecasting the performance of a single specific crop, the inputs appropriate to
that crop are used together with local estimates of forecast weather (or local long-term
averages). Successive updates can be made as the season elapses and the forecast period
shortens. This particular exercise has a feature that is nearly unique in modelling growth
in that the answers from the model are given before the simulated crop is harvested and
the user – a grower – believes that he/she then has the ‘right’ answer. There is little
forgiveness for error. Only the forecasting of the risk of disease (Raatjes et al., 2004) has
a greater pressure from the user.

Forecasting yields at a regional and national level (Heilbronn and MacKerron, 1989)
represents a completely different scale of application from the other examples of fore-
casting being considered here and is worth examination. The method used by Heilbronn
and MacKerron (1989) involved the selection of representative weather stations and mak-
ing successive runs of the model during the growing season, progressively substituting
actual weather as it occurred for values of the long-term-average weather (MacKerron,
1987). There were several difficulties in extending this method to regions of the UK
(MacKerron, 1992). First, it was necessary that the regions examined were the same
as those used administratively so that independent data on actual production would be
available for comparison with the simulations. Second, such regions are large and contain
heterogeneous weather conditions and husbandry practices giving difficulties in selecting
representative meteorological stations. Third, the model is non-linear so that simulations
made using ‘average’ values of, say, planting or harvesting and ‘representative’ weather
conditions do not provide the same answers as averages of simulations made with the sev-
eral sets of conditions. Accepting these limitations, over a period of 12 years, there was a
quite good relation between estimates of regional yields and observed values (MacKerron
et al., 1990; Fig. 35.1A). When averaged across the whole of the UK (MacKerron et al.,
1990; Fig. 35.1B), many of the errors cancelled out (i.e. the differences between regions
were not systematic), but there was an underlying systematic error in that the model over-
estimated yield. When that systematic error was removed, the system allowed forecasts
of yield to be made (MacKerron et al., 1990; Fig. 35.2) that, in most years, correctly
predicted the divergence from long-term average at the end of the growing season by the
end of June. The resulting estimates of national yields can provide a basis for judging the
market supply of potato and for making early assessments of differences from average.
Precise and up-to-date information on agricultural production is an essential component
of a market economy. For a long time, the European Union had a common agricultural
policy, the management of which relied on such market information. The European
Community (as it was called earlier) supported the development of agrometeorological
models for regional monitoring of crop state and for quantitative yield predictions on a

national scale. The potato crop was the topic of several such projects, e.g. MacKerron
(1992), De Koning et al. (1993) and Boons-Prins et al. (1993).

There have been several noteworthy examples where two or more semi-mechanistic
models have been combined into a DSS that is capable of being used in a commercial
context. These include the PLANT-PLUS system for forecasting the incidence of disease,
particularly late blight of the potato, and for providing a scale of changing risk of infection
as time elapses since the previous protection, the crop grows and the weather changes
(Raatjes et al., 2004). That DSS is used on a commercial scale. An educational tool was
developed to allow users to explore the integrated control of potato cyst nematode pro-
gramme (Elliott et al., 2004). Among the reasons why that package did not go further than
the educational use is the difficulty in providing good, field-specific data on existing nema-
tode populations. However, the package has been released to potato growers in the UK for
general use. MacKerron et al. (2004) developed MAPP (Management Advisory Package
for Potatoes), a package to help potato growers optimize their seed rates and harvest dates
in the light of the cultivar being used, the size and cost of the seed tubers and the expected
prices of the harvested crop in a range of sizes. That package combined simulation of
water-constrained growth of the crop with cultivar specific characteristics of tuber multi-
plication and a simulation of tuber size distribution. It also indicates any need for irrigation.
These and other DSSs will not be discussed further here, but the references will provide

a lead for further interest.

35.4 CALIBRATION/VALIDATION AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES

35.4.1 Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis is an important step in the assessment of any mathematical model that
simulates crop growth. In many (most?) cases, the sensitivity of growth models cannot be
tested from the first derivative of their driving functions as several of the variables appear
in several discrete functions. In such cases, sensitivity has to be assessed by running the
model first with ‘typical’ values of the variables and crop husbandry and a standard set
of meteorological data. Then, the model is tested by running it repeatedly with differing
values of the principal variables.

MacKerron and Waister (1985) and MacKerron (1985) recognized two forms of sensi-
tivity that they termed ‘internal’ and ‘external’. MacKerron and Waister (1985) examined
the sensitivity of the output of the model to changes in functions within the model
whether these should originate from a mistaken understanding of the processes or from
differences in performance, e.g. between varieties. They called this ‘internal sensitivity’.
MacKerron (1985) then examined the sensitivity of the output of the model to changes
in the input values, e.g. date of planting or harvest, or changes in insolation. He called
this ‘external sensitivity’. Similarly, Jefferies and Heilbronn (1991) tested the internal
sensitivity of their model and found that it was least sensitive to the changes in the value
of the LCC and most sensitive to values of water-use efficiency. Similarly, Van den
Broek and Kabat (1995) reported that their model was particularly sensitive to water-use
efficiency. Fishman et al. (1995) also found that sensitivity had to be assessed by running

770

MacKerron

their model with controlled variation in values of parameters. Therefore, they tested only
the four parameters that had the greatest effect on calculated yield.

Although all modellers recognize the importance of the sensitivity of their models
to particular variables and/or parameters (e.g. Ritchie et al., 1995; Van den Broek and
Kabat, 1995), it seems that few have set out the sensitivity of their models in as explicit
a manner as did MacKerron and Waister (1985) and Jefferies and Heilbronn (1991). This
relates to suggestions for further work.

35.4.2 Calibration and validation

The contents of this short section are very much a personal view and may be at variance
with what is generally accepted practice in the modelling community. I will take this
opportunity to express that opinion.

The construction of a mathematical model of crop growth involves the formal state-
ment of hypotheses about the real system. Implementation of the model, preferably in a
computer program, leads to a solution of the hypotheses for given inputs and should lead
to the critical step of validation (Loomis et al., 1979). Validation involves comparisons of
predictions with the results from independent experiments. It is a matter of some regret
that so many of the models that are presented in the literature have never been validated
by their authors and that still others have been given only the most cursory check. One
could reasonably take the view that until a model has been validated it has limited worth.
Several models of crop growth contain variable ‘constants’ that can be adjusted to make
the answers fit reality in particular circumstances. This is a dubious practice (variously
called ‘calibration’ or ‘tuning’ by its practitioners) that might be tolerable under stringent,
pre-set conditions. It is believable that a crop may be sensitive to particular variables,
e.g. soil type, which the modeller has not been able to simulate as yet. Under these
circumstances, it might be permissible to use an arbitrary constant or function to make
the model reflect reality, on the firm condition that, once adjusted, these ‘variables’
become constant. Thus, a model might be run in comparison with one set of data that
is associated with a particular area, and the results of the run might then be used to
adjust variables to force agreement between model and reality. The model should then
be run with unchanged ‘tuning variables’ and should be checked against several sets of
independent data from the same area (e.g. from different fields or from different years).
If further ‘tuning’ or ‘calibration’ is needed, then the model should be set aside until it
has been redesigned.

35.4.2.1 An exercise in calibration

A workshop on potato modelling was held in Wageningen in May 1990 (Kabat et al.,
1995b). The key feature of that workshop was that several models were run and tested
against paired data sets. That is, there were four sets of weather, crop and soil data
presented, two were from successive years of one experiment on a similar soil in each
year and the other two sets came from a second experiment also with the same soil
in the 2 years. The participants had each been given access to the first set of each
pair and had been allowed to ‘calibrate’ their models. In general, model calibration

Mathematical models of plant growth and development

771

involved adjusting parameter values until acceptable simulation results were produced
for the calibration data set. The purpose of the exercise was to examine how well the
models then simulated the results of the second data set in each pair. The developers
of each model reported on the performance of their model in both the calibration and
the validation stages. De Koning et al. (1995) showed yield as a curvilinear function of
maximum rooting depth. They ‘calibrated’ their model for maximum rooting depth using
the data from 1 year – that is, they found the value that worked and applied it to the
data from the subsequent year. They found that their model appeared to overestimate
drought stress even though the simulated soil moisture depletion proceeded more slowly
than in the calibration year. In their own words, ‘ (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) caution has to be taken when
applying a calibrated model to other conditions, (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ’. Later, Kabat et al. (1995a) prepared
a most thorough comparison of the simulations and evaluation of the parameterizations.
A few of their observations can be quoted: with the exception of two models, the rate
at which the crop proceeds from one developmental event to another is described by a
function of air temperature (soil temperature before emergence) although the functions
differ. Partitioning of dry matter is one of the most difficult to quantify satisfactorily,
being influenced by a whole range of environmental influences. Four of the models
being compared used a cumulative partitioning coefficient; the others used some form of
instantaneous partitioning coefficient. All the models in the comparison were calibrated
for dry matter partitioning and all but one for senescence processes. The number of other
parameters that were adjusted in the calibration exercise differed between models. The
variations between predicted and measured values of cumulative total dry weight and
cumulative tuber dry weight were large as were the differences between models, with the
exception of two of the models that gave values almost identical to the measured ones.
The model of Jefferies and Heilbronn (1995) was not included in the general set of
comparisons because, it was thought, the model was partly developed on the data set
used for verification of the other models. That was not strictly correct, as the model was
completely independent of one of the pairs of data sets. Jefferies and Heilbronn’s model
was the only one not to be ‘calibrated’ (ever) in the sense that is used here and in the
workshop.

35.4.2.2 Must a model give the ‘right’ answer?

Through all the plethora of efforts to make models ‘work’, it is important to remember
that major purposes of a model are to explain and to confer understanding. Users should
always be aware of the bounds of the models they use. They should think about the
answers that models give, only in terms of the models themselves. Therefore, they have
to know the basic principles of the model. That may be a challenge where the user is not
the developer. For example, when the model predicts a lower yield than the user would
have thought, he/she should be able to explain that by the way the model calculates
this yield and to check whether it was his/her perception that was wrong or has the
model been taken beyond its proper domain. All his/her other knowledge can be used
to qualify the model’s answer. So, for example, Rijneveld (1997) found differences in
the amount of agreement between simulation and reality in two sites: one with a sandy
clay loam soil and the other with a sandy soil. For the site with sandy soil, there was a

772

MacKerron

significant difference between measurement and observation and he was able to indicate
the parameters that led to the disparity. Yet, he concluded that it would be wrong simply
to alter the parameters to make the output of the model fit the data from that site. To
do so would not improve our understanding and would almost certainly make the model
wrong in its simulation of crop growth and water use in soils that are less sandy. This
presumes that the origins of the differences in operation of the model at the two sites are
due to soil-related water supply, and it sets a target to improve the model so that it will
accommodate differing soils without interference in the model.

35.4.3 Modellers tend to believe their models

Developers of models run the risk that they will ‘believe’ in their own models. When
examining or interpreting their results, modellers tend to say ‘is’ or ‘does’ (e.g. Spitters and
Schapendonk, 1990). ‘The effects of water shortage are: (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) less leaf growth (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) (which)
is caused by a lower rate of photosynthesis, (is caused by) a decrease in specific leaf area,
and (is caused by) a lower proportion of assimilates allocated to haulm growth’. Well,
are these things correct? They may well be, but there were no experimental observations
made whatsoever in that particular study. These authors were in no way atypical, but
what they should have written was that their model simulated these effects, or that it
appeared that these would be the effects if the experiments were done. [Or some similar
phrasing to remind the reader (and the authors) that what is being reported is not an
experimental fact.]

One side-issue in the question of calibration is the difference between cultivars. Where
experimental studies show differences between cultivars, e.g. in the base temperature for
sprout growth (e.g. MacKerron, 1984), the modellers must consider whether to include
such genotypic variation in their model. If they do so and the data are not generally
available for all cultivars, then they must offer a default value and then admit that the
output from the model is liable to be ‘wrong’. Is it not better to select a ‘typical’ value
for such a characteristic and accept that it is one source of uncertainty in the model?
If there is general knowledge that a particular characteristic featured in the model does
differ between cultivars, then they must test for the significance of any effect. Is the
effect large or small? Is it linear or non-linear? If the effect is large enough to make a
significant difference to the output, then they must give the option to set a known value
but warn users of the sensitivity.

Such effects are among those that modellers seek to eliminate when they ‘calibrate’
their models for a particular location and cultivar. I argue that it is better to accept that
the model is ‘wrong’.

35.5 FUTURE WORK

Most models, and all that have had any general acceptance or application, have strong
points where they simulate a part of the real world adequately. But, again, all have limits
to their applicability. An associated weakness of modellers and those who use these
models is that they come to believe in the models. When there is a mismatch between

Mathematical models of plant growth and development

773

simulation and observation, there is a tendency to believe either that the observation is
subject to sampling error (which it is) or that a small adjustment of the parameters in the
model is all that is required to produce coherence between simulation and observation.
What is not generally considered is that the model may, quite simply, be inadequate for
the conditions obtaining. This leads to an idea for constructive collaborative work on
simulation models of potato. The idea hinges on accepting that each model has some
validity and then testing them exhaustively against field data such as those sets indicated
in the GCTE Report No. 9 (1997) to establish for each model a domain of conditions
within which the model is capable or relevant or pertinent.

Decision Support Systems in Potato

Production

36.1 DEFINITION

Hayman (2004) reviewed the definition of decision support systems (DSSs) in some
detail. Their purpose is self-evident from the term, namely to support the decision maker
rather than make decisions in themselves. Whether this is what the end user always
expects is debatable – we will come back to this later. DSSs come in many forms, from
the spoken word, pamphlets and booklets, the neighbour, spreadsheets, telephone and
Internet to advanced software. In its broadest definition, there is nothing to separate the
term DSS from the agricultural extension service. For the purposes of this chapter, DSSs
will be restricted to computer-based systems and their role in the wider context of decision
support.

36.2 OPPORTUNITY

Since the introduction of the personal computer in the early 1980s, the sustained expo-
nential growth in computing power has had a profound effect on the way we all work
and not least in the way and speed with which we communicate. The email and mobile
telephone have replaced the written letter and office-bound telephone for most communi-
cations. The quantity, detail and speed with which research data in crop physiology and
agronomy can be captured, analysed and processed have increased many fold. A new
discipline of numerical modelling has emerged and, among many diverse areas, has been
applied to crops to predict effects of weather and husbandry (irrigation, nutrients and
pests) on development, growth and yield and to meteorology, producing more accurate
and longer-range forecasts. MacKerron (Chapter 35, MacKerron, this volume) reviews
many of the developments in potato crop modelling. Weather is a key input in most
models, and its variability from year to year and the uncertainty in forecasting means that
no 2 years are alike and hence husbandry and crop performance will vary. The ability
to forecast the consequences of changes in husbandry and of weather in a timely and
accurate manner creates significant opportunities for computer-based DSSs to assist the
grower in potato production and agriculture in general. Both the public-funded research
and the commercial sector insist on demonstrable knowledge transfer to the industry

and look for public good and environmental benefit. Plant breeders have an output that,
while challenging to produce, is easily quantified in the form of a new cultivar that they
release. New cultivars are independently assessed for a range of traits including yield,
tuber number, maturity date and resistance to a range of pests and diseases. The benefits
of the breeders’ research are clear to the end user (Woodruff, 1992). In contrast, the crop
physiologists have a much more difficult task to demonstrate effective knowledge transfer
(Hayman, 2004). DSSs offer a ‘tempting’ opportunity to facilitate knowledge transfer by
integrating a large body of knowledge together in a ‘user friendly package’. The danger
is that the desire for knowledge transfer, although justifiable and to be encouraged, is
driven more by the provider of the DSS than by the end user. The risk is that the prod-
uct addresses the questions that can be answered rather than the priority needs of the
customer.

Rapid developments in Information Communication Technology (ICT) have brought
large volumes of information through the Internet to our fingertips at speeds that were
not dreamt of a decade or so ago. And while the power of computing has risen, costs
have fallen by orders of magnitude. In the 1980s in the UK, less than one-fifth of farm
businesses had a personal computer that stood alone; now the vast majority have access to
computers and the Internet. The technologies are available for the capture of site-specific
data, for collation with external information sources and for processing it into an easily
digestible form.

36.3 CURRENT AVAILABILITY

A search of the World Wide Web in 2005 for the words ‘potato’ and ‘decision’ and
‘support’ returned over 1.7 million hits. A refinement of the search to ‘potato’ and
‘decision support’ reduced this to 90 000. At the time of the search, Google also provided
an optional means of filtering out similar pages, which brought this figure down to 8000.
Visiting the first 200 ranked best matches and then the first 10 in each 100 thereafter up
to 1001–1010 showed that initially half of all hits were relevant to the topic, and this
fell to less than one-quarter by the 200th hit and to less than 1 in 10 by the 1000th hit
(Fig. 36.1). Sorting the relevant hits by year from this sub-sample of 280 sites visited
indicated that there was little activity in this area reported on the web before 1985, activity
remained small in the next decade before taking off exponentially in the late 1990s and
it was still gaining momentum in 2005. It can be argued that the distribution in time will
be skewed towards current activity as webpages are maintained and updated. A similar
search of CAB Abstracts revealed a much smaller number of scientific publications but
nevertheless reflected a similar time course of relative activity (Fig. 36.2). More detailed
analysis of the websites visited revealed that decision support was dominated by pest and
disease issues and in particular late blight (Table 36.1). Over one-third of all relevant
sites referred to late blight, and nearly three-quarters of all pest and disease issues were
late blight. The next most frequent areas of crop-specific decision support were fertiliser,
dominated by nitrogen, and irrigation. Another significant area of activity was in the use
of modelling for determining the suitability of land, particularly in developing countries,
for the cultivation of potato and alternative crops. Analysis of the CAB Abstracts revealed

a remarkably similar breakdown of activity (Table 36.2). Most abstracts referred to just
one decision area – of the 62 abstracts found, only 12 decision areas specific to potato
were referred to. Overall, late blight was ranked top in both, followed by decisions on
fertiliser and irrigation alongside land use and then potato cyst nematode (PCN) and
tuber size distribution. All of these are common issues in both temperate and warmer
climates. Next ranked came early blight and Colorado beetle, the former being restricted
to the warmer regions. Decisions on seed rate are perhaps lower than one would expect.
However, this decision is often part of the overall management of tuber size, and seed
rate may well be subsumed within it. There is little to choose between the remaining

issues. There has clearly been a significant amount of effort applied in the development
of decision support tools for the potato industry.

The four main areas of current decision support, late blight, fertiliser, irrigation and

tuber size distribution, are presented by way of example.

36.3.1 Late blight

Late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans) is the major disease of potato. It is ever
present and must be managed in all years to avoid premature death of the crop and the
disease entering the tubers with subsequent loss in storage (Chapter 7, Simko et al., and
Chapter 29, Termorshuizen, this volume). As the consequences of failing to control the
disease are so devastating, it would not be surprising for growers to adopt a prophylactic
strategy, with the sole decision being when first to start the spraying programme. Neverthe-
less, there is much activity both in the public and in the commercial sectors in developing
DSSs for the control of late blight. There has been and continues to be an extensive
research effort into all aspects of the disease from epidemiology to genetics of breeding
resistance. The research is highly organized with well-established international networks
exemplified by the Global Initiative on Late Blight (GILB) (http://gilb.cip.cgiar.org/).
Although GILB’s primary aim is to improve management of late blight in developing

782

Marshall

countries, it draws together a worldwide partnership that is well experienced in all aspects
of late blight including its management in both developed and developing countries.
Schepers (2002) presented an overview of DSSs for the control of late blight in industri-
alized countries at the GILB 2002 conference in Hamburg. That paper emphasized that
the control of late blight involves an integrated package of methods including tackling
the sources of inoculum, the effective deployment of disease resistance in cultivars and
the use of DSS tools. This contrasts with the complementary paper for developing coun-
tries where direct education of the grower in the management of late blight is the main
priority, with no significant role for computer-based DSSs (Mizubuti and Forbes, 2002;
Ortiz, 2002). Much more important was to understand the factors that influenced the
farmers in their decision-making. Of the five factors including resources, perception and
prioritization of problems, experience and knowledge, only the fifth related to the actual
agro-ecology of the disease itself. It is the agro-ecology that is usually the main topic
of the DSS in industrialized countries. In Europe, one can find examples of all forms of
delivery of DSSs for late blight from a visit by the extension officer, telephone, fax, email
and text message, to PC and the Internet. Web-Blight (www.web-blight.net), developed
in Denmark and based on the NegFry model, has now been expanded to many of the
countries surrounding the Baltic, including Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway,
Poland and Sweden. It provides an online warning and prediction service. In the UK, there
are at least three websites (DARD BlightNet, British Potato Council and Syngenta-UK)
available to assist in the control of potato late blight. In Germany, a number of websites
(ISIP Demo Daten, Bayerische LFL and Syngenta-DE) provide recommendations based
on the DSS Simphyt. And in Switzerland, an Internet site uses a DSS based on Phyto-
PRE+2000. There are three basic ingredients: monitoring of the incidence of disease in the
current season, weather data and a method of disease prediction. All include direct mon-
itoring of the presence of the disease models, and weather data alone are not sufficient.
A few use monitoring alone. Web-Blight in Denmark is delivered as Pl@nteInfo on the
Internet (www.planteinfo.dk). The map that forecasts outbreaks is shown alongside a map
of the monitoring data for ease of comparison. It describes itself as an information system
and DSS for Danish farmers and agricultural advisers. A subscription system enables
personalized information to be stored and used. For example, because the geographical
location of the user’s home is known after login, local weather data are used for model
calculations. It can also store previously entered information on fields, crops and actions
taken by the user for later use of the system. The Danish Agricultural Advisory Service
(DAAS) organizes about 50 advisors in a formal survey network. The target is to monitor
all conventional and organic fields, field trials and experimental trials. These 50 advisors
cannot monitor all possible occurrences. Therefore, the farmers are also asked to act as
additional scouts and call in an advisor when they suspect an infection. If the advisor
recognizes symptoms as potentially late blight, a plant sample is sent to a specialist for
verification. The advantage of this system is that all information on the Internet site is
guaranteed to be about late blight. They found that even experienced potato advisors
can be wrong in the interpretation of late blight symptoms. In 1998, there was an 8%
error rate. Farmers in Denmark are confident of the verification method, actively support
the survey system and trust the DSS sufficiently to delay fungicide applications until
the warnings are generated, whereas previously, rumours about early attacks could get

many farmers in a region on the tractor and applying their fungicide controls only to find
later that it was a false alarm. The disease forecasts are used to identify the time when
scouting should be intensified. This can differ by up to 3 weeks (mid-June to early July)
for Danish conditions.

Companies such as Dacom, Opti-Crop and Pro-Plant have developed DSSs for control
of late blight and offer these services – after registration and payment. Dacom’s ser-
vice is called Plant-Plus and has been used on-farm since 1994 for the management of
P. infestans. It offers an integrated 5-day weather forecast that provides a predictive risk
assessment for the coming days. The disease models require the availability of on-farm,
automatic, weather data. Plant-Plus uses a biological model that is based on the life cycle
of the fungus and incorporates infection events on an unprotected part of the crop. The
model will recommend when to apply a new spray and what type of chemical to use,
whether contact, translaminar or systemic. Dacom has always closely monitored its per-
formance and the growers’ confidence in it. The benefits are clearly demonstrated in field
trials and commercial evaluations, from northern temperate Europe to the Mediterranean,
up to Scandinavia and across the USA and Japan (Raatjes et al., 2004).

Access to local weather data in a timely fashion is often a problem for DSSs. Whereas
the Danish appear to have an excellent publicly sponsored network of daily weather
data, other countries do not, or users face high commercial charges for access to such
weather information. Some commercial companies have addressed this head-on, providing
a weather collection service alongside their DSS. In the Netherlands, Dacom maintains a
network of about 100 meteorological stations, claiming to provide complete coverage of
the potato-growing regions. Every 15 min, these weather stations measure a large amount
of data, including the temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed
and direction, that is those factors that affect crop performance and disease progression.
They have developed similar networks in other countries where they operate. Anywhere
in the world, wherever a meteorological station is connected to a telephone line or the
Internet, information can be downloaded to the Dacom databank and shared with its
members. Thus, loss of data from one station due to a temporary failure can be replaced
by interpolation from nearby stations.

Opti-Crop has similar services. Opti-Crop claims that farmers need help to assimilate
the plethora of data thrown at them in the precision agricultural industry. Interestingly, in
Australia at least, alongside their DSS, they also provide an agronomist to work closely
with the grower throughout the entire season, allowing appropriate management practices
and technologies to be included in the crop production system.

The European network for development of an integrated control strategy of potato
late blight (EU.NET.ICP) was a 4-year concerted action that delivered in 2000 (for
a project description, see http://ec.europa.eu/research/agro/fair/en/nl0206.html) with the
major objective to review and report on the role of DSSs in integrating all the available
information on the life cycle of P. infestans, the effect of weather both past and future
on the disease progress, its interactions with plant development and growth, the use
of fungicides, cultivar resistance and the sources of inoculum and disease pressure and
improving the control of the disease. As part of the review, several DSSs were validated
over a 3-year period (Hansen et al., 2002). They included Simphyt (Germany), Plant-Plus
(Netherlands), NegFry (Denmark), ProPhy (Netherlands), Guntz-Divoux/Milsol (France)

784

Marshall

and PhytoPre+2000 (Switzerland). The use of a DSS reduced fungicide input by 8–62%
compared with routine treatments. The level of disease at the end of the season was the
same or lower using a DSS compared with a routine treatment in 26 of 29 validations.
Similar results were observed by Dowley and Burke (2003) and Leonard et al. (2001) in
separate studies of four European DSSs. Two were in the public sector and the other two
were available through commercial outlets. Field experiments carried out over a 3-year
period in Ireland showed that a prophylactic 7-day routine applied 13.7 applications
of fungicide, whereas the DSS programmes varied between 5.7 and 12.3 applications.
NegFry and SimPhyt produced the greatest reduction of 50%. ProPhy and Plant-Plus
were more conservative at 10 and 25% reduction. All DSSs controlled the disease as well
as the standard prophylactic, control treatment.

In conclusion, there are both economic justification and environmental benefits to
be gained by using DSSs for late blight control. The variation between DSSs in the
number of applications while all still maintaining control suggests that there is still room
for improvement in some, but this must not be achieved at the cost of significantly
increased risk. A DSS forms part of an integrated management plan. It requires accurate
and extensive monitoring of disease pressure in the region, timely and accurate local
daily weather records and tried and tested models of disease forecasting as well as good
husbandry (cultivar resistance, hygiene, rotation and correct disposal of potential sources
of future inoculum). It can be further improved by also taking into account weather
forecasts looking several days ahead. This is used in some of the commercially available
services to reduce the risk of an unnecessary fungicide application, should the forecast
be confident that weather conditions will not be conducive to propagation of the disease.

36.3.2 Fertiliser

Nitrogen has been the main focus in the development of electronic DSSs for fertilisers.
Of the three major nutrients, crop yield is most responsive to nitrogen and in some cases
can respond to a split application. Environmental concerns related to nitrogen pollution of
ground water, reinforced by legislation, are probably the main drivers for the development
of DSSs for the application of nitrogen in its various forms, both inorganic and organic,
including manures. In the past, cost had been less important, but this is also changing
with the rising cost of fuels. Phosphorus has received less attention, perhaps because it is
less prone to leaching. Once applied, it is quickly bound to the soil structure; typically,
only 10% of that applied is taken up by the potato crop in that year. It can, therefore,
build up in the soil and enter streams through surface run-off and soil erosion resulting
in eutrophication. Algal growth is phosphorus-limited rather than nitrogen-limited.
Phosphorus is already a concern in the USA, with states developing phosphorus indices
to identify and determine phosphorus management measures (Sharpley et al., 2003).
Phosphorus fertilisers will become a concern for all, not only as a source of pollution
but as the world’s supply of inorganic phosphorus runs out over the next few decades.

In more arid regions that rely on irrigation, for example centre pivot irrigation in Idaho,
nutrients are applied throughout the growing season in the irrigation water (fertigation)
in amounts that often follow a tried and tested ‘blueprint’ or prescription.

Crop N demand

–

Soil N supply

=

Fertilizer requirement

Fig. 36.3. Fertiliser requirement is essentially the nitrogen required to achieve the target yield less the nitrogen
supplied from the soil. The greatest uncertainty is estimating the soil supply.

Traditionally, optimum nitrogen fertilisation rates were determined from the average
response of field trials employing a range of nitrogen application rates over several
sites and years. This ignored the variability in soil nitrogen supply (SNS) (Hofman and
Salomez, 2000), and alternative approaches such as the budget method are replacing it.
Whichever nutrient is being considered, the problem of estimating nutrient requirement
is essentially the same; it is equal to the crop demand for that nutrient less the amount
supplied by the soil during the season (Fig. 36.3). Crop nutrient demand is directly
related to yield which in turn is determined by the weather, principally soil and air
temperatures, solar radiation (sunshine), precipitation (rainfall) plus irrigation available
and the length of growing season. Simulation models can be used to estimate water-
limited yield; however, the grower will often have a target-harvested yield based on
past experience. This harvested fresh weight yield of tubers needs to be converted to
an estimate of total crop dry matter first. Adjustments are required for field leavings
(small tubers left in the ground), dry matter concentration of the tubers and finally the
proportion of biomass found in tubers compared to the whole plant. Given this figure,
there is a robust relation determining the average nutrient concentrations and hence
nutrient requirement of the crop. The same relation was shown to hold for nitrogen in
22 crop species (Greenwood, 1982; Greenwood et al., 1985; Lemaire, 1997). The origin
of the relation was demonstrated by Marshall and Porter (1991). It was later extended
to phosphorus and potassium, and at the same time, the optimum time courses of uptake
for the three major nutrients were established (Greenwood and Draycott, 1995). This
highlighted the need for high rates of nitrogen uptake to be maintained during canopy
expansion, with uptake rates falling towards canopy closure. In contrast, there was a
steadily increasing demand for phosphorus throughout canopy expansion.

Estimating soil supply is the major challenge in deriving a nitrogen requirement. There
are two parts to the estimation: the amount of mineral nitrogen in the soil at planting
and the amount of nitrogen that becomes available during the season through nitrogen
mineralization. The latter will depend on soil type, especially the organic matter content.
The simplest approach is a look-up table. In the UK, ADAS (agricultural advisory service
for England and Wales) developed such a table in the 1970s and revised it several times,
with the 7th edition published in 2000 (Anonymous, 2000). A three-level soil nitrogen
index has been replaced by a new seven-level index of SNS. However, in practice, for
potato, these are in fact reduced back to three levels! SNS takes into account soil type
and organic matter content as well as previous cropping in an attempt to estimate current
soil mineral nitrogen and future soil nitrogen mineralization. Combining SNS with annual
rainfall, cultivar maturity type and planned length of growing season results in fertiliser
recommendations ranging from 0 for early-lift, late maturing cultivars with high SNS to
−1 for late-lift early maturing cultivars with low SNS. This ‘field assessment’

786

Marshall

fluctuations that occur among fields with the same soil type and also from year to year.
If these fluctuations are likely to be significant, then it is strongly recommended that
Nmin is measured directly (Neeteson, 1995). ADAS likewise supports this view when soil
mineral nitrogen is likely to have a high and uncertain value. Sampling strategies for soil
nitrogen, the need for DSSs and the incorporation of sampling into DSSs were reviewed
by Johnson et al., (2000), Hofman and Salomez (2000), and Shepherd (2000) all in the
one book.

An alternative strategy to measuring Nmin, or in addition to it, is to apply less than the
recommended rate of nitrogen fertiliser at planting, then measure the crop nitrogen status
once the canopy is established and apply the remainder if it is deemed necessary. This
has the added advantage that one is getting an indication of the combined effects of the
soil mineral nitrogen present at planting and the additional supply of nitrogen through
soil mineralization since planting less any losses by leaching.

Booij et al. (2000) reviewed options for measuring crop nitrogen status and concluded
that invasive techniques that measure nitrogen content directly were not practicable.
The only alternatives were non-destructive surrogates, for example petiole sap nitrogen
measurements, chlorophyll meters (e.g. SPAD meter, Minolta, Osaka, Japan) looking at
individual leaf tissues and crop reflectance methods (CROPSCAN Inc., Rochester, MN,
USA) which can estimate leaf area index and total chlorophyll per unit ground area.
Tractor-mounted crop reflectance methods are being used in the precision farming of
cereals to adjust, in real time, the amounts of nitrogen fertiliser applied as the spreader
passes over the field. So far, there has been no similar commercial development for
potatoes. ‘Blueprints’ of the optimum nitrogen status of the crop over time have been
drawn up, which are used to determine whether the crop is short of nitrogen or not
(MacKerron, 2000). When a shortage is identified, the problem remains as to how much
needs to be applied. With fertigation or foliar application, one can apply a little and often
until the symptoms of deficiency are removed. The window of opportunity to detect,
take remedial action and for that action to take effect is especially narrow for granular
applications, and inevitably, one has to take a cruder action.

The following examples illustrate some of the methods referred to above which are
currently in use in DSSs. Azobil, a DSS developed in France, uses what is referred to as
the ‘forecast balance’ method (Chambenoit et al., 2004). It is essentially an expansion of
Fig. 36.3. The nitrogen absorbed by the crop is equivalent to crop demand, and the soil
supply is broken down into Nmin that is measured and soil mineralization. Mineralization is
a function of soil type and organic matter content, which is divided into active and longer-
term pools depending on management policies for crop residues and the application of
manures. They have one additional term, ‘soil mineral nitrogen not available to the crop’,
which is determined empirically. It, apparently, reflects the roots inability to capture all
the available nitrogen and is dependent on soil type. They have confirmed that the critical
nitrogen curve, developed by Greenwood, Lemaire and colleagues, also applies to their
cultivars. A model predicts potential growth determined by temperature and radiation
and takes account of variation in planting date as a result of changes in soil conditions
from year to year and planned changes to harvest date. Combining the critical curve and
estimated potential growth determines the crop nitrogen demand.

Decision support systems in potato production

787

In Belgium, they also use the same balance method as in Azobil (Goffart and Olivier,
2004) but only apply 70% of the full recommendation at planting. Then between 25
and 55 days after crop emergence, a chlorophyll meter is used to determine the crop
nitrogen status. If it falls below a defined critical level, then the remaining 30% of the full
recommendation is applied, avoiding the issue of how much to apply for remedial action.
In New Zealand, a DSS called Potato Calculator (Jamieson et al., 2004) is currently
being used to reduce the amount of nitrogen applied to early potato crops while still
maintaining yield. The drivers for this, which are common throughout the world, are
three-fold: the cost of nitrogen fertiliser is rising, local and national governments are
increasingly concerned about non-point-source pollution of ground and surface water and
growers need to demonstrate to local and international markets that they are growing
their crops in an environmentally sustainable manner. Interestingly, Potato Calculator
supersedes previous DSSs that were based on crop monitoring of nitrogen status (e.g.
petiole sap testing). The crop-monitoring approach was seen as retrospective, dealing with
the problem once nitrogen deficiency was manifest. The new approach seeks to anticipate
nitrogen deficiency by using a detailed simulation model of the effects of temperature,
light, nitrogen and water supply on potato development, growth and partitioning of carbon
and nitrogen using recent weather and scenarios of future weather to estimate whether and
when water and nitrogen will become limiting. The reliance on crop simulation alone is
an unusual step, but the group has had previous successes in developing the Sirius Wheat
Calculator in close partnership with growers (Jamieson et al., 2003). The experience
gained has been incorporated into the Potato Calculator.

In conclusion, the means of determining a crop’s demand for nitrogen based on
target yield is sound and robust. Measurement of the soil mineral nitrogen present at
planting removes the large uncertainties in estimates based on previous cropping and
soil type alone. Although many models of soil mineralization have been developed by
scientists to achieve the required accuracy, they tend to demand too much data input for
practical purposes. Measurement of crop nitrogen status combined with split application
should improve the accuracy with which supply meets demand and will work best when
combined with small and frequent supplements of nitrogen applied through fertigation.
For supplements applied in granular form, further problems remain, namely how much is
required and how quickly will it take effect will depend on future rainfall or irrigation. The
best response to supplemental nitrogen occurs if the initial supply is adequate to maintain
rapid leaf expansion and canopy closure and if supplements keep the crop growing at
maximum thereafter (Gianquinto and Bona, 2000).

36.3.3 Irrigation

It is perhaps surprising that DSSs for irrigation scheduling did not come out top in the
searches on the Internet and in CAB Abstracts. In part, this may be due to the insistence
that the term ‘potato’ was present. Water is so important that DSSs for irrigation are
probably more frequently developed for a range of crops including potato; ‘potato’ may
not be mentioned explicitly in all texts that were searched.

Irrigation accounts for 60–80% of the world’s fresh water withdrawals applied to 15%
of the agricultural land but accounting for half of total production. In contrast, late blight

788

Marshall

is associated specifically with the potato crop. Water is the single most limiting factor in
potato production, even in cooler climates as in Finland with the short growing season,
and in some countries, the crop receives the largest share of the irrigation (Johnson
and Colauzzi, 2004). Within Europe, there is considerable variation in the amount of
water applied, the proportion of total area under irrigation and method of application,
even within similar climatic regions. For example, whereas England has nearly 80%
of its potato crop under some form of irrigation, Belgium has little (Martins, 2000).
Weatherhead and Danert (2002) reported that the amount of irrigation applied in England
to a potato crop almost doubled in the 1980s as did the area irrigated. The average amount
applied per unit area then stabilized, whereas the irrigated area increased by a further 60%.
The increases have come entirely from the greater amounts applied after 31 July in each
year in maincrop production. The irrigation of grass, cereals and sugar beet has declined
significantly. Overall, the results indicate that growers are prioritizing irrigation on higher
value crops and using water more efficiently. In over half of the irrigated potato crops
in the UK, irrigation is now scheduled ‘scientifically’, reflecting the growing attention
to water conservation. Slightly more growers use in-field soil moisture measurements,
for example neutron probes or tensiometers, with the remainder using water balance
calculations by either hand or computer. These are essentially the two methods for
deciding when to irrigate: water balance and direct measurement of soil moisture. In
the water balance method, the soil is often assumed to be at field capacity at planting,
certainly in temperate regions where this is a reasonable assumption. Evaporation losses
are then calculated on a daily basis by taking the potential evaporation and modifying it
by the amount of ground cover of the crop. Potential evaporation is usually calculated
from daily weather data, for example from dry- and wet-bulb temperatures, maximum
and minimum air temperatures, soil temperature, solar radiation and average wind speed
using the now-standard method of Penman–Monteith or similar method – itself a DSS. It
provides an estimate of what a well-watered crop such as potato would transpire if it fully
covered the ground. In the early stages of growth, much of the soil is bare. Evaporation
from the soil is generally less than that from a crop, especially as the soil surface dries
out, and this is taken into account. Allowances can also be made when water has become
limiting and the crop reduces its rate of water loss. After the appropriate adjustments
have been made, one is left with an estimate of the actual daily evaporation. There are
many models available which have been validated in their own climates and have proved
to be robust. In essence, with a few constraints such as not exceeding field capacity and
capillary rise from water table, by summing the actual daily evaporation estimates and
subtracting any precipitation (rainfall), one is left with an estimate of the soil moisture
deficit, usually expressed in equivalent depth of net amount of water lost. The alternative
is to measure some aspect of soil moisture directly, usually a potential indicating how
much suction pressure has to be applied by the roots to withdraw the water from the
soil. In either case, there are some simple thresholds that are used to determine when to
apply water. The optimum thresholds, maximum soil moisture deficit or minimum water
potential, vary over time. For example, during tuber initiation, too great a soil water
deficit can allow common scab to develop and can reduce the number of daughter tubers
produced. Too wet a soil can make the crop prone to powdery scab. Once the tubers have
set, the crop can tolerate greater deficits before growth is affected.

Decision support systems in potato production

The decision of when and how much water to apply is a tactical one that is made
regularly throughout the growing season. Some examples of tactical DSSs in irrigation are
Plant-Plus (Raatjes et al., 2004), Pl@nteInfo (www.planteinfo.dk), MAPP (MacKerron
et al., 2004) and Potato Calculator (Jamieson et al., 2004). It is not surprising that Dacom
having initially developed Plant-Plus and the associated network of weather stations for
controlling late blight then extended it into irrigation management of potato. Plant-Plus
offers both methods, the soil water balance based on calculations of PE and estimated
actual evaporation and/or direct monitoring through the use of soil moisture sensors. Both
the approaches will require some additional sensors to be attached to their data capture
system, developed originally for late blight, but the basic infrastructure is in place. The
ability to set the levels for field capacity and refill point, combined with the graphical
outputs, allows the user to define when to irrigate and the most appropriate amount of
water to apply.

While one may develop a DSS for irrigation on its own, when developing a DSS
for nitrogen application and especially when considering the use of split applications, it
is sensible to incorporate support for both irrigation and nitrogen because the two are
inextricably linked. Nitrogen will not be taken up unless it is dissolved in the soil solution
surrounding the roots. In fertigation, the two resources are physically packaged together.
In the case of granular application of fertiliser, it is essential that rain and/or irrigation
follow to ensure the nitrogen becomes available to the plant. Haverkort et al. (2003)
describe the building of a nitrogen/irrigation DSS based on LINTUL-Potato which is
intended to be available over the Internet. Another example is the use of SIMPOTATO
in the Pacific Northwest of the USA, with the specific aims of improving the economic
efficiency of production and minimizing the risk to the environment (Alva, 2006).

There are also strategic decisions as to how much and what type of irrigation equipment
to purchase and where to deploy it. Where there is little rainfall, permanently installed
irrigation systems such as centre pivot or drip-lines are preferred. In wetter climates, there
is trade-off between capital investment and the logistics of moving equipment between
fields to meet each crop’s requirements. Indeed, there is a question of whether to irrigate
throughout the growing season or just through the period of tuber initiation or not at all,
set against the increasing risk of tuber disorders and yield loss. This leads to a different
set of DSS tools that cover the range of crops that may be irrigated and is more likely to
be used by an advisor or company selling the irrigation equipment, in discussion with the
grower. Zaliwski and Górski (2001) reported on their evaluation of the cost-effectiveness
of irrigation of potato in Poland using models, weather data and geographic information
systems (GIS) to estimate the risk and degree of drought and impact on potato yields.

Concerns of over-abstraction, reduced flows in the rivers, falling levels of ground water
and increased pollution risk mean that the cost of water is rising in many countries and
new legislation is being imposed to restrict the amount of water that can be abstracted.
This introduces yet another level of DSS, water management at the catchment scale and its
consequences for land use. Although these are not likely to involve the growers directly,
the decisions often have a major impact, for example should one grow potatoes at all. DHI
Water and Environment (www.dhigroup.com), an independent research and consultancy
organization developed from former institutes in Denmark, is a highly focused group

790

Marshall

looking at the availability and management of water on a wide range of scales, both
marine and fresh water around the world.

The increasing concerns about climate change and the increasing demand for water for
domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes mean that governments are introducing tight
controls on its use, and costs are rising. The models of water use are relatively simple,
based on sound physical principles, validated and robust. DSSs have an important role to
play in optimizing the strategic deployment of irrigation and its day-to-day tactical use.
As for control of late blight, local weather is required on a daily basis, and in this case,
direct observations of crop canopy development and/or soil moisture may be required for
some methods.

36.3.4 Tuber size distribution

An estimated 8% of the UK crop failed to meet size specifications, the largest cause
of wastage, in 2000 with an estimated cost to the industry £24 m per annum. The size
of the tuber is usually defined as either the minimum mesh size through which it will
pass or its fresh weight – there is a simple logarithmic relation between the two. The
economic value of a tuber can change dramatically as its size moves from one grade to
another. Potatoes intended for the salad or canning market can halve in value if the size
of the tuber increases by just 5 mm. Even in the potato starch industry, there are financial
penalties if the sample delivered to the factory has too many small potatoes (van Haren,
personal communication). Size specifications frequently change both for existing markets
and when new markets develop. A tool that can predict how changes in husbandry affect
the size distribution would be of help to the grower.

The distribution of tuber sizes in a crop is influenced by a complex of weather and
agronomic variables and intrinsic variation within the plant, so that potato tubers are
produced in a wide range of sizes in most if not all crops. However, the basic concept
of managing tuber size is simple and exploits the fact that the spread of tuber sizes is
proportional to the average tuber size, that is the ratio of the characteristic spread to the
average tuber size is constant when expressed on a fresh weight basis (Sands and Regel,
1983; Marshall et al., 1998). Nemecek et al. (1996) found the same relation between
spread and average tuber size using a slightly different function to forecast the proportions
of seed potato produced. There is some evidence for variation between cultivars in this
ratio, but the variation is small for practical purposes (Marshall and Thompson, 1986).
There is little the grower can do to achieve a tighter more uniform size distribution. It
has been claimed that bed systems or using smaller seed, for example mini-tubers, could
achieve greater uniformity by better control of stem number and greater uniformity of
spacing. At one time, the national list trials in the UK had a character for scoring absolute
uniformity and then it was abandoned. It turns out that wherever a cultivar or treatment
was thought to produce a more uniform size distribution, the effect had come about by
increasing the number of daughter tubers and/or reducing yield. They were uniformly
small! However, if the planting rates of the cultivars or treatments are adjusted, so that
they produce similar numbers of daughter tubers per unit area and similar yields, then
there is little or no difference in the resultant size distributions. The problem reduces to
managing the average tuber size, and the spread will follow.

Decision support systems in potato production

791

Average tuber size is the fresh weight yield of the potato crop divided by the number
of daughter tubers present (see Fig. 3 of Marshall et al., 1998). When making a decision
on what planting density to use, the grower is aiming to match the probable number of
daughter tubers produced to the anticipated yield to achieve the economic optimum size
distribution for the intended market. The number of daughter tubers produced is dependent
on the stem density and on the cultivar but also on external environmental conditions,
many of which are beyond the control of the grower. The one size seed, managed in store
in the one way, may nevertheless produce significantly different numbers of daughter
tubers from one year to the next. The reason is not necessarily that the seed is intrinsically
different from one year to the next. The growing conditions during tuber initiation can
significantly influence the number of daughter tubers produced, even when water is non-
limiting. Experiments manipulating the physiological age of the seed tubers have failed
to resolve the extent to which growing conditions in the previous crop from which the
seed was derived, storage conditions and early growing conditions in the subsequent crop
in which the seed is used contribute to this variation. Likewise, attempts to assess the
condition of the seed at planting by counting the number of eyes that are open, number
of stems per eye, etc. have been equally unsuccessful. Therefore, the aim of the decision
on planting density is to get the crop into the right ballpark. It is then essential to make
direct observations of the number of daughter tubers actually produced in the crop – one
cannot rely on simulation alone.

Fortunately, the final number of daughter tubers to be produced is determined quite
early, shortly after canopy closure and the end of tuber initiation. Once the final number
has been fixed, it should then be a simple matter to take a series of samples to determine
the actual number. Knowing the actual number, one can determine the yield one needs
to achieve the desired size distribution and hence decide any shift in harvest date that
might be needed. These samples can be spread over time: early samples shortly after
canopy closure, then successive samples to confirm that the tuber number has stabilized
and, by combining these stable samples, one can increase the precision of the estimate.
It is common practice to dig such samples, but often, these are done only at end of
the season and with only a visual inspection. By combining models of tuber bulking
over time with models of tuber size distribution and sequentially sampling the observed
tuber numbers, one can determine the optimum time for lifting with increasing precision.
The DSS Management Advisory Package for Potatoes (MAPP) offers such a system for
determining the time to stop the crop growing as well as support for seed-rate decisions
based on target yield and size specification (MacKerron et al., 2004). MAPP physically
prevents the grower from accessing support on when to harvest until at least one sample
dig has been entered.

These calculations can also be done using spreadsheets, but that relies heavily on
past experience, previous combinations of daughter tuber numbers and yields and typical
bulking rates. For a specialist grower group working with a limited number of cultivars
and markets, it is possible to develop suitable tables. Some commercial growers already
use this approach (Anon, personal communication). It works for them because they have
learnt by experience what the optimum combination of average tuber size and total yield
has to be to meet their specific need. If the need changes, for example the target for
total yield is changed or market size specification changes, then, in the absence of an

792

Marshall

underlying model of the size distribution, it is not possible to predict accurately how
much average tuber size and hence plant density may need to change. However, such
changes are readily accommodated by a DSS such as MAPP.

The models of tuber size distribution have been shown to be robust and applicable
across a range of cultivars in Europe and Australia. Apart from the need to calibrate new
cultivars, there is no reason to suspect that DSSs based on this type of model cannot
be used anywhere in the world for supporting decisions on planting density and harvest
dates. They are particularly useful when the system of production is being altered, for
example different size of seed, different cultivar, market specification or yield level. But
again, when it comes to deciding when to lift as the season progresses, data collection is
an issue. In addition to the usual weather data required for predicting water-limited yield
and hence irrigation scheduling, samples of the tubers have to be taken and analysed.
This takes time. A means of semi-automating this process using a simple digital camera
has been proposed and piloted by Marshall and Young (2004), and significant interest
has been expressed by the industry.

36.4 TAKE-UP IN GENERAL

The use of ICT by German farmers increased by nearly 17-fold in the 16 years from
1982 to 1998, four-fold in the 1980s and another four-fold in the 1990s (Kuhlmann and
Brodersen, 2001). All sectors increased as the number one driving force for uptake of
ICT was the legal requirements for financial bookkeeping. Farmers hardly ever used
formal DSSs, not even to exploit their financial accounting data as a means of business
analysis and planning (Ohlmer et al., 1998). Of the 86 000 software installations reported
in the German survey in 1998, 80% were mainly for retrospective calculations split
approximately equally between financial bookkeeping, crop record keeping and livestock
record keeping. Only 20% were installed for anticipative calculations, of which one-
half was for livestock production and only one in seven for crop production, with the
remainder used for marketing. There is some hope for DSS usage for operational planning
which increased by 250-fold over the 16-year period, although the evidence suggested
that the rates of uptake for crop and livestock production had fallen in the second half,
with marketing being in ascendancy.

Clearly, legal requirements for finance and audit trails are inescapable drivers for
computer usage on the farm. So, what are the constraints to the uptake of DSSs for
strategic and tactical decision-making on the farm?

36.5 THE WAY FORWARD

36.5.1 Barriers to uptake

36.5.1.1 Investment

Employing a DSS on the farm requires an investment in both the direct costs of purchasing
the software and the indirect costs of the time required to use the system, which can

Decision support systems in potato production

793

be significant. Unless the return on investment is clearly quantifiable and large enough,
uptake of the product will be small.

36.5.1.2 Training

The initial costs of training in the use of computers and then of the software are potential
obstacles to the uptake of DSSs. The need to use computers for financial bookkeeping,
the increasing need to have accurate record keeping for audit trails and the early exposure
of the children to computers both at home and at school mean that this first barrier, the
use of computers per se on the farm, has all but disappeared in many cultures. Training
costs to use the software remain.

36.5.1.3 Access

The person using the computer may not be the person making the operational decisions.
On smaller farms, the spouse often maintains the computer records, whereas in larger
production units, a secretary is often employed. The computer is generally fixed in the
office, whereas the decision maker may well be out of the office for most of the time. The
ideal would be a simple-to-use system that can be accessed from anywhere. Perhaps, this is
one of the reasons why precision farming has had some success. For example, as referred
to earlier, variable rate of application of nitrogen fertiliser can be achieved by placing
crop detectors and computer processing on board the tractor, and the rate of application
is automated. In fact, it is then no longer decision support: it is decision-making.

36.5.1.4 Credibility and understanding

To plan a set of actions, one needs a set of options, the outcomes of which are predictable.
To make a prediction, one needs a model, but what is an appropriate model? Passioura
(1996) warns against the rush of the enthusiastic scientist to be seen to be actively
delivering knowledge transfer by taking a model developed for scientific purposes and
implementing it directly into a DSS to advise farmers or policy makers – ‘These quite
different aspirations require quite different models (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) The best engineering models are
based on robust empirical relations between plant behaviour and the main environmental
variables. Because of their empirical nature, we should not expect them to apply outside
the range of the environmental variables used in their calibration. Within their calibrated
ranges, however, some have proved useful in providing sound management advice’.

Even given an appropriate model, it is crucial that it does not become a black-box. The
farmer needs to understand how the models work in the language of the farmer – how
a change of inputs interacts and produces a different outcome. Even with relatively few
variables for the grower to manipulate, the range of possible outcomes can rapidly expand.
There is a Catch 22 – if the system is overly simplified, then it is seen not to respond to
local conditions, but if it is overly complex, then its behaviour becomes impenetrable to
all but the developer (Cox, 1996; Kuhlmann and Brodersen, 2001). Both result in a lack of
credibility, trustworthiness and reliability. Cox concluded that DSS technology, intended
to support routine decision-making, is over-engineered. The need was and still is for
models with a degree of resolution, appropriately validated, that cope adequately with the

794

Marshall

emergent properties of systems in the context of substantial background noise. This, Cox
states, argues for simpler models, not more complex ones, if the interpretation of model
output is to be done by people other than those who built the models. Enough complexity
emerges through interaction of the problem owners with the problematic situation. Our
own experiences in the development of MAPP confirm this view. The development of
MAPP involved end users from the very first stage and was tested by them at various
stages during its development. Nevertheless, on its release, some users can have the first
seeds of doubt sown when the predictions of the underlying models apparently differ
from their experience. In their eyes, the model is wrong! ‘I would not use that seed-rate’
or ‘That’s not the tuber size distribution I get from my crop’ might be typical first-time
responses. A few minutes spent reviewing the problem with the grower usually reveals
that an input entered by the user was not the same as on the farm. For example, when
there is a perceived discrepancy on the effect of seed rate (planting density) on the
predicted tuber size distribution, it is not uncommon to find that the anticipated yield
level entered by the grower is not a true reflection of past yield levels. Although advised
of its importance in text that accompanies the entry of anticipated yield, the first-time
user can easily miss the link between an input and its consequence, resulting in a loss of
confidence. Confidence is quickly restored when the cause is recognized, and a change
of input confirms that prediction and experience are after all consistent. The learning
process is an important part of using a DSS. It is not easy to anticipate all the interactions
between a user and a DSS, especially if it supports several decision areas that influence
each other. Human interaction is therefore an important part of the learning process for
all but the simplest DSS.

36.5.2 The customer

‘Who are the users?’, ‘What do they want?’, ‘Why do they want it?’, ‘How do they use it?’
and ‘How do they vary?’ are all important questions to consider before developing a DSS.
Glenz (1994) reported that thousands of copies of DSSs for the selection of cultivars, crop
protection and fertilisation of winter wheat were sold, but cautious questioning revealed
that the clients rarely used them for direct decision-making. They actually used them
as learning machines to explore the decision space they had to operate in (Kuhlmann
and Brodersen, 2001). This was no bad thing as this is one area that was identified as
deficient. For example, when the grower is trying to increase the proportion of the total
yield in a specified market, for example smaller seed or more bakers, or is switching to
a new market with a different set of size specifications, the required change in planting
density is easily underestimated. A DSS allows the grower to explore the consequences
and understand the factors that influence size distribution, what is possible and what is
not. Indeed, some DSSs are built primarily for this purpose. For example, the primary
purpose for a DSS for managing PCN developed by Elliot et al. (2004) is to educate the
grower in how changing the number of years and the cultivars between successive crops
of potato in the one field has dramatic effects on the populations of PCN over several
rotations. Having used the system, the grower is then much more aware of the roles of
resistance and tolerance to PCN, nematicides and length of rotation on managing the pest.
It was released in the UK as a CD through the British Potato Council.

Decision support systems in potato production

795

Hayman (2004) has written an excellent reflection on the experiences with DSSs in
Australian dryland farming, which should be read by all those involved in their devel-
opment. He cites Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1989) who drew important distinctions between
novices and experts; the former are learning, whereas the latter are applying in earnest
and feel deeply responsible for their decisions. ‘Developers of DSSs often point to under-
graduate education as a significant market for their software. The success of DSSs with
19-year-old undergraduate students may give a clue to the lack of success with 50-year-old
farmers; DSSs are more appropriate for novices’. It raises the question of whether the
same tool should be used by an undergraduate and an experienced farmer. There is
also considerable variation within the experienced farming community. We have been
involved recently in developing an online cultivar selection DSS with AveBe for the starch
potato growers in the Netherlands and Germany (Optiras, http://optiras.agrobiokon.eu/).
A primary objective of the DSS is to raise awareness of the management of PCN by
appropriate use of rotation interval and cultivars. The industry has identified differing
grower types, essentially classifying them by performance criteria, low and high quality
of product and low and high yield. They particularly wish to target the lower yield,
lower quality groups. The problem is that these are the least comfortable with the new
technologies. Logging user transactions online, surveys and direct observational studies
are revealing differences in how the four groups use the system. It is not just best practice
that needs to be passed on but the psychology of how different grower groups think,
ask questions and share knowledge. It was concluded that an additional section should
be added which explains the underlying model and its influences. The user then has the
option to learn first through a structured set of pages and then use the DSS. Without these
pages, the user could still experiment and learn, but for some, this could take too much
time and interest is lost. This particular example has a narrow focus, and it is feasible to
provide a ‘training service’ online alongside the DSS.

Kerr (2004) investigating factors affecting the adoption of a DSS called DairyPro in
the Australian dairy industry concluded that developers need to have a good working
knowledge of the target industry and to understand the types of decisions that are made
and the diversity of user types. It is important to have decision makers involved in
the development of a DSS which also encourages a feeling of greater ownership of
the eventual endproduct. Interestingly, they also advocate the use of domain experts to
provide estimates of expected production levels rather than the traditional approach of
using the results from simulation models to make these estimates.

Should DSSs be expected to be used in isolation? The answer is likely to be, ‘not in
the first instance at least’. Despite best efforts, each DSS is unlikely to capture all the
expertise that could be applied nor all the specific circumstances of each farm business
that may be relevant. It is, therefore, likely that DSSs will be used in conjunction with a
consultant, at least in the early stages. Hayman (2004) quotes from Kilpatrick (1999) about
a farmer who was willing to pay someone to travel to his remote farm in the Northern
Territory of Australia. The farmer explained the advantage of one-to-one learning, ‘If you
can talk to them face to face, you can question them and that sort of thing, and (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) they’ll
tend to give you more information and a clearer picture on things, rather than just
reading about things (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) When you’re speaking to someone in person, you’re getting also
their ideas, and different ways of (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) putting together a breeding program, etc. It is very

796

Marshall

useful’. Farm consultants were also seen as people who had seen a range of businesses
operating a particular system and have the ability to apply those experiences to a particular
client’s situation. Another perception by clients was that people who used consultants
were ‘thinkers’, and thus, consultants were coming into contact with a whole range of
innovative ideas. A similar conclusion was reached about growers in the study of the use
of the online potato cultivar selection referred to earlier – growers belonging to the highest
performing group were willing to share their knowledge and ask questions in contrast to
the least performing group who did not share and did not ask penetrating questions.

The grower, after an initial training period, is likely to use DSSs designed for tactical
(day-to-day) decisions on their own, unless the unexpected happens. As mentioned earlier,
differences between model prediction and reality do occur. Interpretation of the reasons
for the discrepancies often requires an expert. The consultant therefore has a key role to
play – at least in the initial, learning phase.

And a final cautionary note: Robinson and Freebairn (2001) re-tell the story of an old
farmer, tinkering with a rusty harrow who is approached by a young advisor offering a
new manual on soil conservation and new farming techniques. After politely listening to
the polished speech, the old farmer replied ‘Son, I don’t farm half as good as I know
how already’.

36.6 CONCLUSION

DSSs are in use and being successfully deployed. Nevertheless, the lessons from Australia
in the late 1980s and 1990s are still very relevant if one is to avoid the same mistakes.
The agro-ecology, the scientific knowledge, is only a small part of the development of a
successful DSS. Understanding the users, knowing who they are, their priorities, how they
approach a problem and how they vary are all important considerations before starting to
develop the DSS. The educational role of a DSS is very important, possibly even more
so than aiding a specific decision. Sometimes education may turn out to be its sole use,
especially with strategic decisions where more information than just the DSS is likely
to be accessed in reaching a final conclusion. DSSs that support tactical decisions that
respond to local conditions that are changing will be used for both purposes. A common
feature of many tactical DSSs is the need for local daily weather data, and many require
some form of monitoring either in the field, such as crop cover, tuber samples, soil
moisture and soil mineral nitrogen, or in the surrounding region as in the case of outbreaks
of disease such as late blight and pests such as Colorado beetle and aphids. How this
information is to be gathered in a timely and efficient way can be a stumbling block in the
uptake of a DSS and needs careful consideration. Finally, the work is not complete once
the DSS has been constructed and distributed. It needs to be supported and evaluated to
identify users’ issues, additional training needs and possible improvements. Support for
the product is probably the most difficult aspect of such projects, requiring significant
resources. A DSS forms part of management strategy and works best alongside the other
sources of information and advice. The farm advisor or local agronomist is an integral
part of the wider decision support. Electronic DSSs are there to enhance, not replace, the
local advisor.

Decision support systems in potato production

797

It is still early days in the development and use of DSSs. Each group seeking to
transfer their knowledge to the industry often specializes in a single crop and/or scientific
discipline and often has to find its own expertise to develop a DSS. Consequently, DSSs
still tend to be developed in relative isolation from each other and to focus on a limited
number of decisions. Typically, a DSS will be built for a single crop and perhaps only one
or two decision areas for that crop. The risks are that the individual DSSs do not integrate
with each other to provide a package that efficiently maps on to the farm business.
With separate DSSs for each crop type, unless developed by the same company, there is
nothing to ensure that data entered into one system can be easily accessed by another.
A farm comprises fields that are probably subject to a rotation, so that soil data entered
in one year, say for growing a wheat crop, should be available the next year when it
is put into potato. If the weather data or soil descriptions entered into one DSS are not
accessible by another, then it can quickly become a significant frustration. This is not a
new problem. In the UK, considerable effort has been put from the mid 1990s onwards
to build an overarching shell that would capture such generic farm data, along with local
and historical weather, and make it available to all compliant DSS modules. However, a
recent search on the Internet did not reveal what the final outcome was. An alternative
approach is for the industry, both commercial interests and agents of the state, to agree to
a set of standards for communication of data, so that products from different sources can
communicate. This would make it easier for smaller, specialist groups to contribute their
knowledge to the industry and would be more efficient and less frustrating for the end user.
The great majority of DSSs are still based on a relatively simple approach of an
underlying deterministic model with a graphical user interface to the end user. A window
pops up asking the user for a set of inputs, the model runs and a set of outputs is created.
A compiled help file or pop-up tips may assist the first-time user in what the various
inputs and outputs are, possibly giving typical examples or ‘tutorials’ as to how it works.
And with packages that deal with more than one topic, an underlying rule-base can ensure
that the user is only asked for information that the DSS does not already know or cannot
compute and yet requires to answer the specific question. This technique is employed in
MAPP, using a rule-based language called CLIPS.

The problem with only using deterministic models is that the DSS is restricted to
only using knowledge that has already been translated into such models. There is much
more information available that is less certain and or less precise. There are methods
to handle this more qualitative and uncertain information, for example rule-based and
Bayesian modelling (Marshall et al., 1995). As yet, there are few examples of such
approaches being used in DSSs. Frito-Lay Inc. has been working with Mindbox Inc. using
ARTEnterprise™ to develop a Potato Expert System (PES) to share the best practices
of their largest growers amongst all their growers (Ownby et al., 2002). Their system
contains modules to assist with new site selection and evaluation, crop management and
disease/disorder diagnosis. A fourth module was planned to provide advice on potato
storage. It employs rule-based reasoning for questions such as site selection and fuzzy
logic to aid the diagnosis of 80-plus potato diseases.

Future weather is a classic example of uncertainty, which has a strong influence on
tactical decision-making. ‘What is the probable yield of the crop and therefore what
rate of fertiliser application and planting density should be used?’, ‘Should I prepare to

798

Marshall

irrigate in three days time or is there a likelihood of significant rain?’, ‘Should a blight
spray be applied or will conditions remain favourable to avoid significant risk of blight
in the next five days?’ and ‘When should I prepare to stop the crop growing in order to
optimise tuber size distribution without significant risk of the tubers becoming infected?’
are all examples of questions the answers to which are influenced by the weather and,
therefore, subject to varying degrees by uncertainty. The problem is not so much how to
calculate the consequences of this uncertainty but rather how to present it to the grower.
Calculation involves some means of generating the probable future weather scenarios,
using either historical weather records or weather generators for longer-term forecasts or
meteorological models for shorter-term forecast, usually no more than 5 days in temperate
climates. Whichever method is employed, the result is a probability distribution of possible
outcomes. How best to convey this information to the user requires further study.

Since the late 1990s the use and content of the Internet has expanded rapidly. With
the faster connections is increasingly becoming the first choice for dissemination of
information, for advisors at least. It has the advantage that information and products
can be updated at a single point and are immediately available to all. However, farm
businesses, being in rural locations, often still find the speed of connection to the Internet
a significant barrier. Portals, locations on the Internet, that link the user to a whole range
of information sources and DSSs are becoming increasingly popular among advisers who
will generally have faster connections. WebInfo, managed by the DAAS, provides an
impressive example of such a portal. Analysis of accesses revealed that the local farm
advisors are the principal users and are the primary if not sole means of keeping up to date
professionally (Hansen, 2004). During a typical month, there are more than 15 000 users.
It holds approximately 70 000 documents including documents concerning legislation
and rules and regulations. Users are able to access more than 50 different DSS tools
covering crop protection, feed planning, irrigation scheduling and more. During the 12
months from August 2003 to July 2004, there were 1.3 million external sessions viewing
6.8 million pages, with close to 50 000 different pages being viewed in total.

In an article in Crop Protection Monthly (Anonymous, 2005) discussing the slow uptake
of DSSs in Europe, David Martin of Plantsystems Limited (www.plantsystems.co.uk)
was cited as saying, DSSs ‘can often increase the complexity of decision making and
sometimes do not fit comfortably into pressurised production situations particularly if they
require detailed attention’. The article continued, ‘Many growers rely for crop protection
advice on agronomists who often see the introduction of a DSS as a threat. Many DSSs
also require the use of real-time weather data and forecasting, all of which involve
additional costs. The full implementation of a DSS also requires training and ongoing
support from the provider, without which usage can decline rapidly’.

The particular DSSs referred in this chapter derive from both commercially and state-
funded work and have been included for illustrative purposes only. The selection is not
exhaustive nor has any value judgement been placed on their suitability for any particular
task. This work has been supported in part by the Scottish Executive Environment and
Rural Affairs Department, Mylnefield Research Services and the British Potato Council.
I also thank Donald MacKerron and Philip Smith for suggested improvements to the
manuscript.
