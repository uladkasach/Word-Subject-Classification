Button handler is a class that is ment to be replicated for each new button. (and even has a function that returns the new coppy for you)

The idea is that each button that you make with html will have the same general atributs, default class, static class, default text, and loading icon

Notable uses are 
- upon using button to submit, disable button and show loading icon while waiting for response
- upon respone, re-enable button if nessesary
